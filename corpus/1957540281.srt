FOREIGN ACTIVISM: A REASON
FOR CONTROVERSY IN MEXICO

4
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,530
{\an8}Several years ago, in Mexico,
a significant number

5
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,990
{\an8}of foreign journalists and activists
moved into our country.

6
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,580
{\an8}Some local groups have shown
hostility towards the activities

7
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,960
{\an8}that these new visitors are carrying out.

8
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,540
{\an8}Fiona Gaertner, an English activist
and wife of U.S. journalist Leam Gaertner,

9
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,710
{\an8}was among the victims.

10
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,800
{\an8}The Gaertners met in Puebla
and later they moved to Mexico City,

11
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,420
{\an8}where their children
Nico and Sebastián were born.

12
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,510
{\an8}As they were still young children, the...

"Closed"

14
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,300
How did you get in, Sebastian?

15
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,050
<i>My name is Nico.</i>
<i>I'm a journalist.</i>

16
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,820
<i>At least, I'm trying to be.</i>

17
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,790
<i>But here I am again
at 5:00 in the morning</i>

18
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,590
<i>in my rented studio
in Puebla,</i>

19
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,190
<i>not sleeping and not
writing a single paragraph.</i>

20
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,160
<i>I think of everything,
obsessively,</i>

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,530
<i>except the article
I have to write.</i>

22
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,670
<i>This is how my story began.</i>

23
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,870
<i>Coming back.
From England to Mexico.</i>

24
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,470
<i>I was just 17 when I came here,
alone,</i>

25
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,370
<i>dying to finally see the
gigantic city</i>

26
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,650
<i>where my mother
said I was born: Mexico City.</i>

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,280
<i>I've been a bundle
of contradictions ever since.</i>

28
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,850
<i>At 17, I was still a sad kid,</i>

29
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,220
<i>a little arrogant, maybe,
but also awkward.</i>

30
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,490
<i>Now I spend my days walking,
looking at everything,</i>

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,490
<i>turning over rocks,
trying to write a good story.</i>

32
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,300
<i>For me, London reemerges
everywhere I look in Mexico.</i>

33
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,560
<i>As Martín Caparrós says,</i>

34
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,810
<i>"We arrive, carrying what we think
we are going to see from somewhere else."</i>

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,845
<i>Like the old Chroniclers
of the Indies, right?</i>

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,080
<i>I live here in Puebla,</i>

37
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,480
<i>and I travel to Mexico City
once a week to work,</i>

38
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,310
<i>so I get the best of both
worlds: beautiful Puebla,</i>

39
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,350
<i>and</i> Joint Visions <i>, a cool</i>
<i>new journal based in el D.F.,</i>

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,510
The 21st century
is characterized by a growing...

44
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,760
a growing movement of trans...

45
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,270
<i>I'm from here.
I was born here.</i>

46
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,470
<i>Hm, how ironic.</i>

47
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,110
<i>I could've stayed in London,
but for what?</i>

48
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,740
<i>They wouldn't even
let me see my mother.</i>

49
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,280
<i>What kind of person does
that to a 16-year-old?</i>

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,880
<i>I'm a hybrid, thinking
in English and Spanish,</i>

51
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,120
<i>a product of development
and underdevelopment,</i>

52
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,290
<i>sometimes coherent,
but usually incoherent.</i>

53
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,720
<i>And then... there's Monica.</i>

54
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,230
<i>Monica is Chilean.</i>

55
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,230
<i>I met her studying journalism
in Puebla,</i>

56
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,670
<i>and she is the best thing
that's happened to me</i>

57
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,130
<i>since I came here.</i>

58
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,940
<i>But like all dreams, love is
subject to brutal awakenings</i>

59
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,840
<i>into silence, fear,
a lack of something more.</i>

60
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,260
When we say that the megacities are

61
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,470
When we say that all megacities

62
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,640
are starting to resemble each other...

63
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,931
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>Fuck!</i>

64
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,617
<i>You're fucking kidding me!
Is this a joke? I can't write anything!</i>

65
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,170
<i>Not this guy in the hat
who's always staring.</i>

66
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,740
<i>I guess it's only fair.
I deserve some payback</i>

67
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,850
<i>for sticking my nose
into other people's lives.</i>

68
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,480
<i>Hello?</i>

69
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,440
I dropped by your house yesterday,
but no one answered the door.

70
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,030
<i>You really came?</i>

71
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,320
Yes, I came by around 3 p.m.

72
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,080
<i>Can you call me later?
I'm kind of busy.</i>

73
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,500
-Okay.
<i>-Cool.</i>

74
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,790
-Okay, later.
<i>-Okay.</i>

75
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,680
<i>Nico... look...</i>

76
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,690
<i>I know you came, but...
you've got me so annoyed!</i>

77
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,270
<i>Nothing flows right with you.</i>

78
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,730
<i>You might want to go on like this,
but what about everyone else?</i>

79
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,110
<i>I came from Chile to study here,
to feel good,</i>

80
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,570
<i>and then I wind up involved with you,
the weirdest guy out there.</i>

81
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,280
<i>You should go back to London,
or the U.S., or, I don't know.</i>

82
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,120
<i>Do as you please.</i>

83
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,330
<i>Nico, don't come back.</i>

84
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,550
<i>And that's how Monica</i>
<i>disappeared from my life.</i>

85
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,560
<i>She got sick of me,
simple as that.</i>

86
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,990
<i>She'll go back to Chile after
she's finished studying here.</i>

87
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,330
<i>I'm sure she'll do well,
unlike my mother.</i>

88
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,740
<i>What happened to my mother
could never happen to Monica.</i>

89
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,140
<i>What could be worse
than ending up</i>

90
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,240
<i>in a mental institution
in London,</i>

91
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,010
<i>the cold city of London,</i>

92
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,780
<i>with its cold streets and
its equally cold psychiatrists.</i>

93
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,650
<i>Monica.</i>

94
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,490
<i>Monica always seems to find
the story that needs telling,</i>

95
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,560
<i>those particular angles
I always miss.</i>

96
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,260
<i>She says Chile is an island
with only seven faces,</i>

97
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,860
<i>and hers is one of them.</i>

98
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,160
<i>I think she got that
from reading</i>

99
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,903
<i>about the films of Raul Ruiz.</i>

100
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:10,840
<i>...and the last Thursday of every month.
We'll be waiting for you!</i>

<i>The people of Puebla shouldn't worry
too much about safety in their state.</i>

103
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,980
<i>With the "Safe Puebla" plan, we will
install more security cameras and lights</i>

104
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,230
<i>to cut danger and crime.</i>

105
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,070
<i>...all night long, three-dollar drinks
all night long.</i>

106
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,847
<i>Contest Thursdays in Rancho Oklahoma City.
We'll be waiting for you!</i>

107
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,110
<i>...see you there...</i>

108
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,860
<i>...Grateful</i>
<i>to God that he allowed me</i>

109
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,590
<i>to be born in
the United States of America.</i>

110
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,660
<i>I love this country.
I love this country! And...</i>

111
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,590
<i>Beginning at 9:00 a.m.,</i>

112
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,220
<i>when the new President gives his inaugural speech...</i>

113
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,920
<i>Members of congress
talk about...</i>

114
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,090
Hello?

115
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,590
<i>Hi, where are you?</i>

116
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,590
Hey, I'm still
in Oklahoma.

117
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,130
<i>You're still here?</i>
<i>Why?</i>

118
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,830
I told you
I was gonna go follow

119
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,130
in my parents' footsteps
and took some back roads.

120
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,670
I can't find anything
to listen to out here.

121
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,570
<i>Babe, you can't follow</i>
<i>in your parents' footsteps.</i>

122
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,300
<i>They travelled 20 years ago.</i>

123
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,970
- I know, but I can try.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

124
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,440
And then,
another 10 hours to Mexico.

125
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,980
But hey, I'm driving.
I'll send you a message later?

126
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,520
<i>Okay, I love you.</i>

127
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,850
Love you.

128
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,907
<i>...will be performing at the inauguration
of the new president...</i>

129
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:43,760
<i>This could mean that not all...</i>

130
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,930
<i>...It's Marxism re-written</i>

131
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,700
<i>and cut to fit a Black context.</i>

132
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,177
<i>Hey, I know you're busy, but...</i>

133
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:55,000
<i>...With</i>
<i>the baptism of the holy spirit,</i>

134
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,700
<i>evidence shows
they were speaking in...</i>

135
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,610
<i>Criticized</i>
<i>by the president elect,</i>

136
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,810
<i>who called climate change
a hoax.</i>

137
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,210
<i>I do not believe that</i>
<i>climate change is a hoax.</i>

138
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,110
<i>Okay, that's important</i>
<i>for the president to hear.</i>

139
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,180
<i>Taking it further,</i>
<i>Johnson told Ferris that if...</i>

140
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,120
<i>My country is falling apart,</i>

141
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,650
<i>and here I am heading
south to Mexico.</i>

142
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,990
<i>What if they build that
damn wall while I am there?</i>

143
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,330
<i>It could be for the best,
really.</i>

144
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,960
<i>Maybe staying in that country
that I don't even know</i>

145
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,300
<i>is just what I need.</i>

146
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,080
<i>Dad,</i>
<i>I am on my way to Mexico,</i>

147
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,180
<i>wondering what made you
and mom settle there.</i>

148
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,520
<i>It's ridiculous
that I'm Mexican!</i>

149
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,220
<i>It's ridiculous that you insist</i>

150
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,060
<i>that my name has
a written accent over the á .</i>

151
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,030
<i>If you only would've had
the decency of telling me more</i>

152
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,760
<i>and not just focus on that,</i>

153
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,430
<i>with your bizarre jokes,
honestly.</i>

154
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,290
<i>What if I was to say
to my brother:</i>

155
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,860
<i>"Nico, I started a letter
for you, but...</i>

156
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,230
<i>"I... I don't know what to say.
I'm so torn.</i>

157
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
<i>How will I approach you
when I get to Mexico City?"</i>

158
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,770
<i>I don't know. I feel that
that's a little too dramatic.</i>

159
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,670
<i>Why don't you just say,</i>

160
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,840
<i>"Hey, this is your brother
Sebastian from Oklahoma?"</i>

161
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,470
<i>Okay, that won't work.</i>

162
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,310
<i>Uh, you could just say,
"What's up jerk?"</i>

163
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,580
Sure, I could say that.

164
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,610
<i>Or I don't know,</i>
<i>just show up at his work.</i>

165
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,410
<i>What is it?</i>
Joint Visions?

166
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,950
Yeah, that's where he works.

167
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,690
That was the only thing
I was able to find online.

168
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,790
I mean, <i>for sure.</i>

169
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,020
<i>Wow, and now you're
on your way to Mexico City.</i>

170
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,590
<i>Does your dad know?</i>

171
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,260
No, I went
to his house this morning,

172
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,160
and of course, he was there
gloomy and mean, as usual.

173
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,400
Uh, can you please just look up

174
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,100
the address
for <i>Joint Visions</i> again?

175
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,100
<i>Yeah, sure, um,
I actually have it right here.</i>

176
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,710
<i>It's on Avenida Juarez
and Revilla...?</i>

177
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,450
<i>How do you say that?
Um, Revillagigedo?</i>

178
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,710
{\an8}<i>This city drags us along.</i>

179
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,340
{\an8}<i>It grows like an animal deformed
by some unknown drug.</i>

180
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,970
{\an8}<i>With no mold, no plan.</i>

181
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,550
{\an8}<i>Like a chain of lights, cars,
and buildings.</i>

182
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,640
{\an8}<i>It is monstrous and beautiful all at once.
But what isn't beautiful in...</i>

183
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,770
<i>What's this guy's problem?</i>

184
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,270
<i>Lost something?</i>

185
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:18,340
<i>I've got to get back to Puebla.</i>

186
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,640
<i>I get so paranoid here
in el D.F.</i>

187
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,980
<i>or Mexico City, or CDMX,</i>

188
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,980
<i>or whatever
they want to call it next.</i>

189
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,700
<i>In the</i> Rear Window,
<i>Jefferies also spied</i>

190
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,770
<i>on his front neighbors,
or did he?</i>

191
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,740
<i>In Hitchcock's film,
Jefferies was a photographer</i>

192
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,540
<i>whose life was paused
because of a broken leg.</i>

193
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,880
<i>I'm more like some
disturbed voyeur,</i>

194
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,440
<i>digging into people's lives</i>

195
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,850
<i>thanks to lack of sleep
and a mental block.</i>

196
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,620
<i>Or in order to turn
my back on my own,</i>

197
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,683
let's say...

198
00:15:03,726 --> 00:15:05,820
<i>"Private Miseries."</i>

199
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,790
<i>That's what my favorite writer,
Leila Guerriero,</i>

200
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,360
<i>would call the things
inside these four walls:</i>

201
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,230
<i>a chair, a table,
a kitchen (inside a closet, )</i>

202
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,130
a bed, and random piles
of books and clothes.

203
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,200
<i>Oh, and the cat of course,</i>

204
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,230
<i>but she is far
from a private misery.</i>

205
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,270
<i>What if I sorted out
all my clothes</i>

206
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,870
<i>in my kitchen drawers
like Slavoj Zizek?</i>

207
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,940
<i>He says it adds
something special to his life.</i>

208
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,980
<i>The Hitchcockian characters
across the street</i>

209
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,220
<i>seem to live normal lives.</i>

210
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,620
<i>I hope no one sees me
and decides to say hello.</i>

211
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,990
<i>I can't hold
a normal conversation.</i>

212
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,260
<i>Here I am again at 5:00
in the morning,</i>

213
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,900
<i>not sleeping and not
writing a single paragraph.</i>

214
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,860
<i>What if I wrote about that
building and the people in it?</i>

215
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,630
<i>I could start with that kid,
staring into space,</i>

216
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,200
<i>looking for something
in the stratosphere.</i>

217
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,700
That could be the start
of a beautiful story.

218
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,620
<i>We walk, we move,</i>
<i>but we never leave home.</i>

219
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,150
<i>This watch is the same one
I asked my mum</i>

220
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,790
<i>to buy for me in London,
a long time ago.</i>

221
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,880
<i>Leila Guerreiro</i>
<i>quotes Rafael Gumucio</i>

222
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,980
<i>from</i> Against Flaubert.

223
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,690
<i>For Flaubert, he says,</i>

224
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,860
<i>Madame Bovary is a vengeance
against her father,</i>

225
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,530
<i>against her uncles, against
the entire city of Ruan,</i>

226
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,360
<i>against books, against nuns,
against Republicans...</i>

227
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,870
<i>almost against everything.</i>

228
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,070
<i>The argument is unsettling
to me, but also intriguing,</i>

229
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,000
<i>like so many others
from Gumucio,</i>

230
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,010
<i>or Leila, or Caparrós,
or Villoro,</i>

231
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,310
<i>or Cadena Martínez,
who I read obsessively.</i>

232
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,600
Hey Nico! How are things?

233
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,980
Pretty good. Well... trying to write.

234
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,860
And you're studying
there in Puebla, right?

235
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,530
I already got a job.
In Mexico City.

236
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,860
Okay, I read what you sent me.

237
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,780
It's pretty good,
but I can tell you are...

238
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,530
tense, stiff.

239
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,420
What's up with that?

240
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,380
You have to tell that story
with a little more...

241
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,920
tenderness.

242
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,510
Tenderness?!

243
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,590
What do you do all day long?

244
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,630
I walk.

245
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,130
But, what else?

246
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,600
Not much more.

247
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,470
I suggest...

248
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,390
you take a chill pill!

249
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,520
You want to write?
Let your hair down, Nico!

250
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:32,060
Ugh.

251
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,530
Stop pulling your hair out when writing!

252
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,850
<i>Today was a good day.</i>

253
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,760
<i>I wasn't able
to start the story</i>

254
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,290
<i>of the kid staring into space,</i>

255
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,160
<i>but something supernatural
did happen.</i>

256
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,960
<i>I finally spoke to Alberto
Cadena Martínez,</i>

257
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,300
<i>all the way from Colombia.</i>

258
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,820
<i>Brilliant!</i>

259
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,150
<i>That really is supernatural.</i>

260
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,610
<i>He called me out though.</i>

261
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,980
<i>Hm, "me retó,"
as Monica would say.</i>

262
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,610
<i>Good thing too, since
I have such writer's block.</i>

263
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,190
<i>Alberto says the key
to writing a good story</i>

264
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,190
<i>is a particular
point of view,</i>

265
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,590
<i>which doesn't just magically
emerge out of research,</i>

266
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,560
<i>out of what I've been doing.</i>

267
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,230
<i>I do fuck all.</i>

268
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,630
<i>I walk around not even
knowing what to look for.</i>

269
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,470
<i>But they say that can be an
advantage for good writers too.</i>

270
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,300
<i>The truth is,
my effort at this story</i>

271
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,340
<i>has become like a tornado
sweeping me along.</i>

272
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,940
<i>Like in Oklahoma.</i>

273
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,907
<i>321?</i>

274
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,830
<i>What is 321?</i>

275
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,890
<i>You're right, Alberto.</i>

276
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,330
<i>I've got to put an end
to this neurosis</i>

277
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,700
<i>and think... think calmly.</i>

278
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
- Good day.
- Yeah.

279
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,330
The usual?

280
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,570
Yeah.

281
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,380
<i>Salud.</i>

282
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,380
Oh, are you from Mexico?

283
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,090
Do I look Mexican?

284
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,030
He says that all the time.

285
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,230
Why?

286
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,100
He used to live in Mexico
for the longest time.

287
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,670
That's why he comes in here.

288
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,840
The music.

289
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,980
Hey, Leam.

290
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,580
How goes it?

291
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,520
I liked it better when Luis
played the old Mexican tunes.

292
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,660
Get him to play
the old Mexican songs.

293
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,860
I'm with you on that.
I'll take your recommendation.

294
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,550
<i>What inhabits</i>
<i>this burning red earth?</i>

295
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,520
<i>Is it abundance,
or the vastness of a desert</i>

296
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,030
<i>plagued by churches,
oil, and highways</i>

297
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,890
<i>that leads to an obscure border</i>

298
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,830
<i>like a blind, mad animal</i>

299
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,700
<i>that crashes into a wall
it cannot see?</i>

300
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,500
<i>The wind blows,
and we are far away,</i>

301
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,870
<i>and every border reminds us</i>

302
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,270
<i>that we cross it only when
we're searching for something;</i>

303
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>otherwise, every cage looks
brilliantly tidy and clean,</i>

304
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>like this one,
where I find myself.</i>

305
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,150
Are you hanging out
or drinking or eating or...?

306
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,320
I'll be back
in a minute for you.

307
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,140
<i>Nico.</i>

308
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,850
<i>I've been unable
to write you a normal letter.</i>

309
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,180
<i>So...</i>

310
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,050
<i>Here's what I really wanna say.</i>

311
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,020
<i>When I found out that you,
Rose, and mom were gone,</i>

312
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,220
<i>all I could do was imagine
where you were.</i>

313
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,660
<i>I spent hours looking
in those geography magazines</i>

314
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,460
<i>that mom brought home
from England.</i>

315
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,000
<i>I was looking
for you guys in them.</i>

316
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,670
<i>Remember that feeling we had</i>

317
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,370
<i>that nothing would happen to us
as long as dad was around?</i>

318
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,170
<i>Well, now he</i> was
<i>the only one around,</i>

319
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,780
<i>but I was six, and he had
shut off completely.</i>

320
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:35,750
<i>I don't know anything about you
or if mom is in Mexico.</i>

321
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,050
<i>But at least I know
where you are.</i>

322
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,120
<i>I'll find you guys.</i>

323
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,820
<i>I can't wait to get down there,
especially now.</i>

324
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,720
<i>Have you seen
what's happening in the US?</i>

325
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,430
<i>Maybe you can get me
a job down there.</i>

326
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,740
<i>I also know that Latin American
cities are gigantic,</i>

327
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,240
<i>one of them being Mexico City,
where I'm headed to find you.</i>

328
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,260
<i>Instead, Ava, our Oklahoma town
is very, let's say, lonely.</i>

329
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,230
<i>In Ava, you don't see
many people walking,</i>

330
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,100
<i>except those loners that
traverse endless pathways</i>

331
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,930
<i>seemingly going from one fast
food joint to a dollar store.</i>

332
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:30,470
<i>And while shiny cars drive
through town anonymously,</i>

333
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,140
<i>other lonely people hit
one bar after the other.</i>

334
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,880
<i>I might sound dramatic,
but this is what I see.</i>

335
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,710
<i>One of those people
that hits those bars</i>

336
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,350
<i>during the day
is our father, Leam.</i>

337
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,160
<i>...Drug lord</i>
<i>is now in U.S. custody</i>

338
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,169
<i>facing several charges...</i>

339
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:35,597
<i>Today began the trial in the case
of the motorcyclist</i>

340
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,530
<i>who drove into a police station
in Laredo.</i>

341
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,200
<i>The trial will take place...</i>

342
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,780
<i>Your call has been forwarded...</i>

343
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,290
<i>...The storm</i>
<i>initiated the conformation</i>

344
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,290
<i>of a tornado
that most likely will pass</i>

345
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,760
<i>near the city of Moore
in the State of Oklahoma.</i>

346
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,400
<i>Residents are already
taking the necessary...</i>

347
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:47,010
{\an8}Federal Highway 85
Mexico

348
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,570
<i>On the other side,</i>
<i>everything sparkles,</i>

349
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,580
<i>bathed in a light
that blinds our eyes.</i>

350
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,380
<i>The lines curve,
the roads become irregular,</i>

351
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:09,420
<i>nature is wild and alive.</i>

352
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,950
<i>Like a party
with no written end.</i>

353
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,920
<i>Like an impossible
and mysterious world.</i>

354
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,450
<i>Why did I decide to write</i>

355
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,720
<i>about the world now,
of all times,</i>

356
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,180
<i>right at the start of the
Post-Truth age...</i>

357
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,120
<i>hm... like Villoro said
in his talk on Tuesday.</i>

358
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,420
<i>Puebla belongs to another time.</i>

359
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,360
<i>It's like a Parisian
city-scape,</i>

360
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,890
<i>frozen in time,</i>

361
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,760
<i>the cover of Benjamin's</i>
Arcade Project,

362
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,060
<i>but in Mexico.</i>

363
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,410
Re-thinking Benjamin
in the context of Latin America

364
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,261
{\an8}The Theorist of the Modern City.
Berlin, Paris, Naples.

365
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:02,530
<i>There's no one
like Walter Benjamin.</i>

366
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,570
<i>He's unique, original,
inexhaustible.</i>

367
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,310
<i>And reading him does me good.</i>

368
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,710
<i>I didn't know that the Parisian
arcades he describes</i>

369
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,380
<i>are so much
like the ones here in Puebla.</i>

370
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,880
<i>But these are tangled, baroque.</i>

371
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,950
<i>Mexico is not the capital
of the world</i>

372
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,720
<i>like Paris was
in the nineteenth century.</i>

373
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,720
<i>But why would anyone
want to live</i>

374
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,560
<i>in the center of the world,
anyway?</i>

375
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:41,210
But why would anyone want to be
in the center of the world anyway?

376
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,210
Here.

377
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,580
<i>I'd love to be</i>
<i>like Benjamin, hm.</i>

378
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,990
<i>To see the world
through these urban surfaces.</i>

379
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,190
<i>Here in Puebla,
everything is exposed</i>

380
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,330
<i>and concealed
at the same time.</i>

381
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,730
<i>And here, in Mexico City,
even more.</i>

382
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,000
<i>In this giant city,
there's no time for fiction.</i>

383
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,540
<i>Anyone who's not wide-awake
gets lost, forever.</i>

384
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,790
<i>To each their own.</i>

385
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,000
<i>Did this guy lose something too?</i>

386
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,710
<i>This is what's called
"The Paranoia of Loneliness."</i>

387
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,790
Chiguagua, Gómez-Palacio, Cananéa.

388
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,963
{\an8}Welcome, sir.
We can give you information.

389
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,700
<i>My children, myself,</i>

390
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,210
<i>are little more
than seeds adrift.</i>

391
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,510
<i>My children, swept away
by the daily winds,</i>

392
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,510
<i>ask themselves questions whose
meaning they've yet to know.</i>

393
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,380
<i>One day, they'll stop, and all
the travelers you now see,</i>

394
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,820
<i>passing other travelers
on foreign soil,</i>

395
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,060
<i>at bus stations,
in the streets,</i>

396
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,360
<i>will be the very proof that
what hurls us into the world</i>

397
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,430
<i>is what also forces us
to endure, to return</i>

398
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,500
<i>to the origin of all things</i>

399
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,340
<i>when my seeds were newly
bursting with light,</i>

400
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,240
<i>like a blameless
and brilliant gift.</i>

401
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,770
<i>...58 to Mérida and Yucatán,
now completing boarding through door 18.</i>

402
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,190
Hello... I'm a little lost,

403
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:34,570
but I'm going to Mexico City.

404
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,370
<i>...3700.</i>

405
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:47,920
<i>Please head immediately
to door number 17.</i>

406
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,390
You bribed him to play
my Mexican music, huh?

407
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,760
Leam.

408
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,660
So, are you a Brit?

409
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,500
Last time, you asked me
if I was from Mexico.

410
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,770
Yeah.

411
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,600
No, I'm from Oklahoma.

412
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,800
What I told you was last summer
I went to England, for school.

413
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,780
Were you in London?

414
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,880
Uh, yeah, for about a month.

415
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,610
I was, like, drinking
a little too much.

416
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,620
Um, why?
Why do you ask?

417
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,420
Don't ask.

418
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,420
It's just a question.
Why, Leam?

419
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,130
What?

420
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,470
<i>In the late sixties...</i>

421
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,370
your dad became totally involved
in the movement of the day.

422
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:48,350
And after the Tlatelolco
Massacre in Mexico...

423
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,490
he kept going back,
returning to cover

424
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,390
the student protests
against the government.

425
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,460
Since he was persecuted here...

426
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,970
He decided to stay there,
in Mexico.

427
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
- He was about your age.
- I don't know...

428
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,140
I know you don't know
much about all this.

429
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,680
Everything your dad, Leam,

430
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,950
struggled for in the sixties
and seventies.

431
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,150
Everything he wrote
as a journalist was brilliant.

432
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,390
And look at the world
today, Sebastian.

433
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:40,830
It's been real hard for me
to witness your dad's downfall,

434
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,270
when so much is happening...

435
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,040
That needs to be analyzed,

436
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,110
contested,

437
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,950
with intelligence.

438
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,880
Look!

439
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,030
What's this catnip stuff?

440
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,400
Ah, the catnip stuff.

441
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,200
It may sound funny.

442
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,530
Even catnip was an issue.

443
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:23,540
But you know,
after he met your mom,

444
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,080
your mother,

445
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,310
their activism became stronger.

446
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,480
<i>She was even tougher.</i>

447
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,490
<i>Fiona... incredible woman.</i>

448
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,220
<i>A short time after you
were born in Mexico,</i>

449
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,260
<i>you and your brother, Nico,</i>

450
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,990
<i>she was kidnapped.</i>

451
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,400
How... how come my dad
never told me about this?

452
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,400
Why are you telling me this?

453
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:53,010
'Cause there has been
too much silence.

454
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,940
We've been quiet for too long.

455
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,080
When y'all came back
from Mexico in...

456
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,190
'98. That's when Mom
was pregnant with Rose.

457
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,590
In nine... yeah,
that'd be right.

458
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,790
The nineties were difficult.
Very difficult in Mexico.

459
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,630
They had no money,

460
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,540
but at least they had a house
here... here in Oklahoma.

461
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,610
And when they came back,

462
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,980
everything seemed so great.

463
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,280
You know, your brother, Nico...

464
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,890
he loved that house,

465
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,050
more so than you.

466
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,890
Your dad...

467
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:50,060
Seems him and little Nico
were like... like this, you know?

468
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,830
They were always playing
at writing stories

469
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,000
for the newspapers
up in the attic.

470
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,010
Remember?

471
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,370
No.

472
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,840
But your parents would not stop,

473
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,310
and vicious people
are everywhere.

474
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,020
Leam, Fiona...

475
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,990
did not have a chance
in Mexico, or even here.

476
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,520
Why didn't she take me?

477
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,130
Why did she only
take Rose and Nico?

478
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,560
She did take Nico, Sebastian...

479
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,100
but she didn't take Rose.

480
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,370
They came back from Mexico

481
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,780
because of that house.

482
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,380
That house!

483
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,710
What!?

484
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:54,530
<i>It happened</i>
<i>on 321 Walnut Rd., in Ava.</i>

485
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,800
<i>The victim has been identified
as 2-year old Rose Gaertner.</i>

486
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,170
<i>Around 6 a.m.,
police responded to a call</i>

487
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,700
<i>of people screaming
outside the Gaertner's home.</i>

488
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,140
<i>When officers got to the scene,</i>

489
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,470
<i>they found Rose lying
on the sidewalk.</i>

490
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,410
<i>She died at the scene.</i>

491

<i>...identified as 2-year
old Rose Gaertner...</i>

492
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,310
<i>Screaming</i>
<i>outside... she died at the scene.</i>

493
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,750
<i>The girl's parents have stated</i>

494
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,210
<i>they were the target

495
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,650
<i>They fear the lack

496
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,920

<i>Participate from now
until the end of the month.</i>

504
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,380
<i>No commitments attached!</i>

505
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,460
<i>Ma'am, we're calling you because your son
has a bullying problem.</i>

506
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,380
<i>Really? Who's bothering him?</i>

507
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,630
<i>No, ma'am, your son
is the one bullying others.</i>

508
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,340
<i>You need to take steps
to modify his behavior.</i>

509
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,850
<i>Our psychologists here in Mexico City
can help you and your son.</i>

510
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,770
<i>Call one of our offices
for a free consultation at 55 52 43...</i>

513
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,240
<i>Participate also in our monthly raffles
where you can win...</i>

514
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:42,000
...I really enjoy it
because it's based on poems

515
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,050
by Mario Benedetti and Oliverio Girondo.

516
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:50,550
The movie has a poem called
"El espantapájaros" [The Scarecrow],

517
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,720
which is what the movie
is based on,

518
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:58,060
that speaks of finding perfect love
or the love that left a mark on your life.

519
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,860
The main character is a prostitute
and the other character is a poet

520
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:08,150
{\an8}who spends more time working on
advertising than on his career.

521
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,990
And the actor Nacha Guevara
plays the role of Death.

522
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,290
She wants to take him away
the day he stops writing poetry,

523
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:24,880
writing about feelings, love, sensations.

524
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,420
I love films.

525
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:32,090
I've seen a cult film
called <i>Blade Runner.</i>

526
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,260
What do you think of <i>Blade Runner?</i>

527
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,310
Oh, you don't understand me, do you?

528
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,796
"No understand."

529
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,060
I've read <i>La muerte del estratega
[Death of a Strategist].</i>

530
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:49,570
It's a beautiful book.
I like how it describes everyday details.

531
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:54,030
The main character of this novel
meets Simón Bolívar.

532
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:58,490
When he enters a room
to meet the Liberator of America,

533
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,040
there is a chair against the wall,

534
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,960
and he describes how the humidity
eats away at the wall.

535
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,500
As a kid, I would see
those drops of humidity

536
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:11,760
that looked like they were made of cotton
and I would play at breaking them apart.

537
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,640
I like that.
Álvaro Mutis is a great writer.

538
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,560
I've read a book called
<i>Stories for After Making Love.</i>

539
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,187
More than anything, I bought the book...

540
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,770
Good afternoon!
How do we get downtown?

541
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,900
We are downtown.
Where do you need to go?

542
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,744
-Right to downtown.
-This is downtown.

543
00:50:29,178 --> 00:50:30,860
After this intersection and the next,

544
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,360
you'll find the Center Square
and the cathedral on your right.

545
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,370
-Oh, okay. Thanks.
-Sure.

546
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:55,550
{\an8}<i>"An imagined woman on the platform
of any metro station in this city.</i>

547
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,430
{\an8}<i>A woman who did not arrive,</i>

548
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:01,680
{\an8}<i>who didn't come
but nonetheless walks among the people</i>

549
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:05,140
<i>searching for the same exits as us.</i>

550
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:09,230
<i>An imagined woman,
lost in the forest of Chapultepec</i>

551
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:11,900
<i>or in the thickness of some dream.</i>

552
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,610
<i>An imagined woman, simply,
running away like all of them</i>

553
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,830
<i>from some photo no one has taken yet.</i>

554
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,370
<i>They walk with us, but don't know it,</i>

555
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:25,120
<i>they don't even imagine it.</i>

556
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:31,340
{\an8}<i>We walk beside them on their behalf,
on the same uneven pavements</i>

557
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:35,420
{\an8}<i>or step on imagined leaves,
perhaps already stepped on by them,</i>

558
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:39,340
<i>who hardly insinuate
the existence of the fall."</i>

559
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,730
Sir... here.

560
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,400
-Here?
-I'm going to that building.

561
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,190
If you are going up the street,
I'll take you. Not a problem.

562
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:56,200
-Sir... No, no, no. Here.
-Okay.

563
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,270
<i>Hello?</i>

564
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,510
Hey.

565
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,510
I got kicked out
of <i>Joint Visions.</i>

566
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,680
<i>Okay.</i>

567
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,180
Yeah.

568
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,880
But I know what I'm gonna do.
I know the city.

569
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,510
I've been walking around.
I've been watching him.

570
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,320
<i>He hangs out with this group
that looks like</i>

571
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:54,790
<i>a modern fucking version of the
Jack Kerouac-Neil Cassidy gang.</i>

572
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,660
They do some kind
of activism or something.

573
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:58,930
I think he saw me.

574
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,860
- Hello?
<i>- It's fine, Sebastian.</i>

575
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,700
<i>Just do whatever
you have to do.</i>

576
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,400
<i>I'll talk to you soon, okay?</i>

577
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,000
<i>Hey, guys.
This is Paige.</i>

578
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,170
<i>Leave a message,
and I'll get back</i>

579
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,570
<i>with you as soon as I can.</i>

580
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,410
<i>Hey guys, this is Paige.</i>

581
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,210
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
back with you as soon as I...</i>

582
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:23,080
<i>It's fine, Sebastian, just do
whatever you have to do.</i>

583
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,420
<i>I'll talk to you soon, okay?</i>

584
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,420
<i>Hey, guys.
This is Paige.</i>

585
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,250
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
back with you as soon as I...</i>

586
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,160
<i>It's fine, Sebastian; just do
whatever you have to do.</i>

587
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,090
This is awkward.

588
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,390
Read this.

589
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,660
<i>...instead, Ava,</i>
<i>our Oklahoma town,</i>

590
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:18,560
<i>is very, let's say, lonely.</i>

591
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,200
<i>In Ava, you don't see
many people walking,</i>

592
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:24,200
<i>except those loners that
traverse endless pathways</i>

593
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,110
<i>seemingly going
from one fast food...</i>

594
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,710
<i>...one of those people
that hits those bars</i>

595
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,140
<i>during the day
is our father, Leam.</i>

596
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,850
I really can't do this
right now, okay?

597
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,150
Maybe later.

598
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,350
Okay.

599
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,790
<i>I think, though,</i>
<i>that, after all,</i>

600
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,460
<i>my friends might be right
when they say</i>

601
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,660
<i>that the US is
a better place than Mexico</i>

602
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,360
<i>with all that violence,
and narcos, and...</i>

603
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,700
<i>but again,
what consolation is that?</i>

604
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:54,230
<i>Ava is a sad little town
that cannot grow</i>

605
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,500
<i>because of the backwardness
of its people.</i>

606
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:58,340
<i>My own backwardness
has kept me here.</i>

607
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,740
<i>And Dad's contempt towards me</i>

608
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,480
<i>is no more than
his unbearable pain.</i>

609
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,580
<i>I am just there
to pick up the pieces.</i>

610
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,660
<i>In the end, our faces</i>
<i>are reflected in a mirror</i>

611
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:24,230
<i>covered in a dust that
the rain cannot cleanse.</i>

612
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,600
<i>A mirror like the one I see
in this tidy and clean cell.</i>

613
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:42,040
November 23, 2016

614
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,460
No place is safe.

615
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,300
Auschwitz, the Tlatelolco Massacre,

616
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,760
the Oklahoma City Bombing,

617
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,590
Hiroshima,

618
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:59,730
horrible just like Alain Resnais
showed in his film.

619
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:04,860
Venezuela, and the police brutality
in the U.S.

620
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:09,360
Conflicts between countries
are as paradoxical

621
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,660
as the ones that can destroy a family.

622
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,760
FOREIGN ACTIVISM: A REASON
FOR CONTROVERSY IN MEXICO

623
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,830
"Closed"

624
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,940
<i>Welcome to skylines,</i>
<i>flight 382</i>

625
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,610
<i>to London Heathrow today.</i>

626
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:14,950
<i>Welcome on board.
Lovely to have you with us.</i>

627
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,720
<i>As we leave
towards the east this...</i>

628
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,350
<i>Dear, brother...</i>

629
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,920
<i>Now, crossing the Atlantic,</i>

630
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:21,390
<i>I can finally answer you,</i>

631
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,190
<i>at least in my head,</i>

632
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,760
<i>but with a sense
that you can hear me.</i>

633
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:27,590
<i>Images cloud my mind</i>

634
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:31,560
<i>while that little Oklahoma
town, Ava, appears in flashes.</i>

635
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,800
<i>The reds and oranges
are what I see the most.</i>

636
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:47,910
<i>So we anticipate</i>
<i>pushing back</i>

637
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:50,280
<i>a few minutes
ahead of schedule.</i>

638
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,990
<i>The cabin crew will demonstrate
the safety equipment procedures</i>

639
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,190
<i>of this aircraft,
and we ask you to...</i>

640
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,660
<i>Now, crossing the</i>
<i>Atlantic, I think of the wall</i>

641
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,390
<i>that's someday meant to divide
Mexico and the US.</i>

642
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:03,560
<i>What a... hm... deplorable idea,</i>

643
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,770
<i>but of course, not surprising.</i>

644
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,970
<i>I'm glad you came
to Mexico, Sebastián.</i>

645
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,610
<i>I'm glad you saw a little of
the place where you were born,</i>

646
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,240
<i>although you came
to save me, I know.</i>

647
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,380
<i>Smart move.</i>

648
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:21,410
<i>I'm glad you didn't just
send me a text, dear brother.</i>

649
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,450
<i>And that your
girlfriend understood,</i>

650
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,850
<i>that she didn't give up.</i>

651
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,740
<i>emanates immense tenderness.</i>

652
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,980
<i>Violence can disrupt your life
without even touching you,</i>

653
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:59,150
<i>like the spinning
winds of a tornado.</i>

654
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,850
<i>While Monica heard
horror stories</i>

655
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:02,990
<i>about the brutality
of Pinochet in her attic,</i>

656
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,890
<i>in another attic,
I invented stories</i>

657
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,130
<i>with my father and Lloyd.</i>

658
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,830
Remember Lloyd?"

659
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,660
<i>They were always</i>
<i>playing at writing stories</i>

660
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,030
<i>for the newspapers
up in the attic.</i>

661
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:14,570
Remember?

662
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,440
<i>It was like a game,
not knowing</i>

663
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:20,240
<i>that something devastating
was coming our way.</i>

664
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:21,668
DEBATE REGARDING TLATELOLCO

665
01:04:21,711 --> 01:04:23,210
<i>Seeing you has
made me think again</i>

666
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,080
<i>about the Tlatelolco Massacre,</i>

667
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,010
<i>which our father reported,</i>

668
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,510
<i>and the Oklahoma City bombing,</i>

669
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,480
<i>which is somehow part
of our own story.</i>

670
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,850
... <i>Believe that</i>
<i>a 1,200-pound car-bomb is what</i>

671
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:36,020
<i>ripped through the nine-story building
shortly after 9:00 this morning.</i>

672
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:38,020
- <i>Many of the victims...</i>
<i>- And years later,</i>

673
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,990
<i>even dad's favorite bar
in Ava burned down.</i>

674
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:43,030
- <i>Hm.</i>
<i>- On Tuesday of last week,</i>

675
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:45,130
<i>a lightning strike
and the fire that followed...</i>

676
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,670
<i>...gutted Leam Gaertner's
"happy place."</i>

677
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,540
<i>Fire grew fast in this beloved bar
of Ava with very little time to...</i>

678
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,710
<i>And thinking</i>
<i>about our mother,</i>

679
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,680
<i>put away in London
for as long as I can remember,</i>

680
01:04:56,710 --> 01:05:00,410
<i>I think of what Tomás
Eloy Martínez once said:</i>

681
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:03,180
<i>'When we read that there were
one hundred thousand victims</i>

682
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:05,180
<i>'in a tsunami in Bangladesh,</i>

683
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:09,460
<i>'the data shocks us,
but it does not move us.</i>

684
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,890
<i>'If we read, instead,
the tragedy of a woman</i>

685
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:15,290
<i>'who has been left alone
in the world after a tsunami</i>

686
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:18,570
<i>'and we followed step-by-step
the history of her losses,</i>

687
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,630
<i>'we'd know everything there is
to know about that tsunami</i>

688
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:23,700
<i>'and all there is to know
about chance</i>

689
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,940
<i>'and about involuntary
and sudden misfortunes.'</i>

690
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:39,050
<i>Your road trip brought all
of this to me, dear brother.</i>

691
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:42,320
<i>It reminded me of the good
life we had in Oklahoma.</i>

February 8, 2017

693
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:56,600
<i>But there are millions
of other stories out there.</i>

694
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,840
<i>Where did the 21st century
go wrong?</i>

695
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:02,470
<i>The planet is full
of dictators, liars, weapons,</i>

696
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:04,140
<i>and yet we cling
to the illusion</i>

697
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,010
<i>that we are moving forward.</i>

698
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,650
<i>That's why I read
Walter Benjamin.</i>

699
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,480
<i>I don't believe
in that progress either,</i>

700
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,020
<i>especially when I walk,
looking around obsessively,</i>

701
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:15,120
<i>trying to understand...
something.</i>

702
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,290
<i>That's what drove
Mónica away, I'm sure.</i>

703
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,990
<i>Maybe as I try to write,</i>

704
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:22,190
<i>a nuclear bomb is
crossing the Atlantic.</i>

705
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:24,260
<i>Maybe, right now, as I walk,</i>

706
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,370
<i>the world is turning
into a mushroom cloud</i>

707
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,800
<i>in which we all burn like
delicate autumn leaves,</i>

708
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,440
<i>slowly growing dark</i>

709
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:36,280
<i>and turning into fragile,
gray, absurd ashes.</i>

{\an8}Oklahoma Mon Amour
By Nico Gaertner

713
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,010
{\an8}For Rose

714
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,010
{\an8}In 1998, Fiona and Leam
Gaertner traveled for nine days

715
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:53,130
{\an8}through the north of Mexico,
the infamous border,

716
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,760
{\an8}the never-ending plains of Texas,

717
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,720
{\an8}until reaching
the reddish Oklahoma territory.

718
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,310
{\an8}Fiona's dry but playful British humor
helped them ease away

719
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,930
{\an8}from their fearless activism.

720
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,390
{\an8}She would say, for instance,

721
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,440
{\an8}"England is an island
with only seven faces,

722
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,940
{\an8}and mine is one of them."

723
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,690
{\an8}Sebastián's, let's say, "road movie"
from 2016, also lasted nine days.

724
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:11,990
{\an8}He was afraid to reach Mexico
and Latin America,

725
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:15,070
{\an8}while thinking that "his" own country
was falling apart.

726
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,990
{\an8}Oklahoma-- who would have thought--

727
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:19,280
{\an8}is the place that unites
and separates them all,

728
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,160
{\an8}as it is the center of so many stories

729
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,960
{\an8}hidden underneath
that reddish land that stretches on...
