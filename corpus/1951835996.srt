[hissing and rattling]

5
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,943
Boys?
Ya'll ready yet?

00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,809
[door opens]

7
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,180
[footsteps]

8
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,015
(boy's voice)
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,987
I'm ready.

10
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:39,149
Where's your brother?

11
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,522
Ohh.

12
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:49,727
Les, honey.
I can see
you breathing.

13
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,430
I don't wanna go!.
I don't wanna!

14
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,530
Ohhh.

15
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,575
I don't wanna go!.
I don't wanna!

16
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,873
It ain't up to
you to decide.

17
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,173
I don't wanna!

18
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,873
The Lord says
you're ready.

19
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,119
I don't wanna go!

20
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,247
Now, Lester,
enough of that.
Come on.

21
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,754
You best not let
your daddy see
you cryin'.

22
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,236
Come on,
get in the car.

23
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,972
We're all set.
Let's go.

24
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,547
(Dad)
SIide over, boys.
There we go.

25
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,319
[hissing]

26
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,163
(male voice)
Praise the Lord!
Hallelujah!

27
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,225
(many)
Hallelujah!

28
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,826
Behold! I give unto
you the power

29
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,338
to tread
on serpents
and scorpions.

30
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,569
Nothing by any means
shall hurt thee! Rise!

31
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,508
Rise!

32
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,671
[clapping]

33
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:15,176
[much shouting, clapping]

34
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,813
(father)
Go over, son.

35
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,490
Come on, Les.

36
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,093
(brother)
Here, Les.
You take him.

37
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,298
Praise God!

38
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,345
(father)
T rust God. Don't
you fear that snake!

39
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,938
Agh!

40
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,747
(brother)
Oh! Oh my God!

41
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,549
Dad! Dad!
No! Dad!

42
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,456
No!
Dad!

43
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,016
It's okay, son.

44
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,654
(minister)
Have praise!
It's God's will!

45
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,967
Somebody help him!

46
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,161
He's dead!

47
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,363
What are you
doing?. Help him!

48
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,738
Call a doctor!
Somebody help him.

49
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,638
[bells toll]

50
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,117
(mother)
Les? Coffee, honey?

51
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,626
(male voice)
Don't do anything
you don't want to.

52
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,322
Just come sit
in the pews.

53
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,489
It's gonna be
a real nice service.

54
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,294
It'd mean
a whole hell
of a lot to Ma.

55
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,925
(Les)
I got to get
to work.

56
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,833
Well, just
this once, Les.

57
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,566
It'd be a decent thing
to do to honor your
daddy's memory.

58
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,404
Ma, best thing
I can do to honor
Daddy's memory,

59
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,034
is stay the hell
away from snakes.

60
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,569
If you feared God
half as much as you
feared that snake,

61
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,910
Dad would still
be alive.

62
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,847
That's enough, Duff.

63
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,647
Your praying
couldn't save Daddy.

64
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,984
Maybe a little
medicine could've.

65
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,115
(female voice, radio)
Les, you copy?

66
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,716
Yeah.
Les, here.

67
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,057
We got something
down by the river.

68
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,063
I'm on my
way outside!
Where are you?.

69
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,501
Morning, partner.

70
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,299
Morning, Faye.
You got the keys?.

71
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:17,002
Sure. Oopsie.
And a good
morning to you too.

72
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,941
I got a girlfriend,
remember that.

73
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,070
[siren]

74
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,206
My brother James,

75
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,876
I was climbing
a tree when he
pulled me down.

76
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,182
Don't blame me,
boogerfoot. You
just fell.

77
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,688
(Erin)
Mr. Jensen, you can't
Ieave your garbage

78
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,724
out like that.

79
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,088
I was gonna
clean it up.

80
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,990
Not only are
you ruining
the environment,

81
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,723
but you can
be attracting
wild animals.

82
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,425
Young lady, I spent six
years in a Vietnamese
prison camp.

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,061
I think l
can handle
a few animals.

84
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:48,096
That ain't gonna
take stitches
now, is it?.

85
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,734
(Les)
A couple of Band-Aids
will do the trick.

86
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,141
See, ya mother
him too much.

87
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,838
"He's gotta go
to the hospital."

88
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,403
"You gotta call
an ambulance."

89
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,847
Actually, you might
want to get him
to a hospital.

90
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,885
It could be
a concussion
or even worse.

91
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,944
Thanks, Doctor.
Walk it off, Billy.

92
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,114
I feel
like fishin'.

93
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,215
(mother)
Poor baby.

94
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,284
(Les)
Erin, wait up.

95
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,387
I've got
work to do.

96
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,227
Alright, l
get it,
I get it.

97
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,789
Sorry about
the other night.

98
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,700
We both said things
we didn't mean.

99
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,137
I meant every
word I said.

100
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,765
Okay.

101
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,972
Les, I love you
but I'm not a
kid anymore.

102
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,412
I wanna get married,
I wanna have
a family.

103
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,110
I don't understand
why you're so afraid
of growing up.

104
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,516
I'm not afraid!

105
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,281
I can't wait around
for you forever.

106
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,685
If you're
not ready
to be a man,

107
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,223
I gotta find
someone who is.

108
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,782
You got a lot
of other offers
on the table right now?.

109
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,327
Many offers.

110
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,863
Yeah?
Like who?

111
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:50,096
Oh, so many.
Like, for example--Bo.

112
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,761
Bo?.

113
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,966
That's Big Bo
to you, Pinky.

114
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,373
Nobody calls me
Pinky anymore.

115
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,469
Big Bo does.
Why don't
you run along?.

116
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,014
Me and the little lady
here have a lunch date.

117
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,481
I'll see you
in town, Erin.

118
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,052
Big Bo?.
You gotta be
kidding me!

119
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,385
Come on, Erin. Give
me another chance.

120
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:50,727
Hey.

121
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,300
Hey, dude!
What the hell?.

122
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,700
(S. Hawk)
Never touch
another man's horse.

123
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,672
You must be lost,
white man.

124
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,869
You, uh, you Leonard
Screamin' Hawk?.

125
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,275
Who's askin'?.

126
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,280
Duff Daniels.
Holy lnspired
Church of Christ.

127
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,440
Snake wranglers?.

128
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,040
That's right.

129
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:16,487
I'm in the market
for some very--
specialized products.

130
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,956
Come on, Officer.
What are you?.

131
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,550
Parks and Rec?.
A nosy ranger?.

132
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,889
No, no.
I'm cool.

133
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,361
Hell, I'm
one-tenth Cherokee.

134
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,457
One-tenth?.
Tell me,
white man,

135
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,399
what kind of products
are you lookin' for?.

136
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,961
Specifically, some,
uh, Carolina pygmies.

137
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,871
I've been to
every wrangler
in town.

138
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,103
They all say you're
the only one who
has 'em.

139
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,943
Carolina pygmies, huh?.

140
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,948
Very deadly snake.

141
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,712
Well, that's kind
of the point.

142
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,315
This way.

143
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,217
How many pygmies
do you want?.

144
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,385
Just a couple.

145
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,361
Fifty bucks each.

146
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,432
You should really
stop by the church
some time.

147
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,902
We'd welcome you
with open arms.

148
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,497
Your faith is
an insult to
nature's power.

149
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,375
Now, what's this?.

150
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:21,387
That--is
called "Unteka. "

151
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,081
Killed a lot
of my people.

152
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,316
Unteka?

153
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,256
Why have I never
heard of this?.

154
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,089
Because my people
are brave enough

155
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,561
and strong enough
to have killed
them all.

156
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,223
Almost all.

157
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,030
You're telling me
this little guy did
all that killin'?.

158
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:41,335
Unteka grows a lot--
and very quickly.

159
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:47,175
If it's so deadly,
how come you don't
just kill it?.

160
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,374
To have Unteka
is to have
great power.

161
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,509
It is a symbol
of pride to
my people.

162
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,146
Yeah, but isn't
that a Iittle risky?

163
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,191
Not if you
observe the rules:

164
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,725
it is harmless.

165
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,385
What rules?.

166
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,326
What does
it matter?.

167
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:08,026
Prr. That's what I thought.
You're making this
stuff up.

168
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,761
There are
three rules.

169
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,805
First,

170
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,207
never let Unteka
out of the jar.

171
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:22,373
Second, never
Iet it eat
anything Iiving.

172
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,076
And finally,

173
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,587
never fear
the heart
of the snake.

174
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,986
Alright. Alright,

Oh, thanks,
I don't feel much
like having a drink.

194
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,291
Well, if you

extremely deadly,
extremely awesome snake.

208
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,726
It killed a whole
bunch of Indians.

209
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,664
Yeah, only the truly wise
and powerful men
can possess it.

210
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,499
Y eah, well, no
snakes in the house.

sweet. In a pathetic
kind of way.

355
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,961
The least I can
do is buy you
some pancakes.

356
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,507
I guess that
will have to do.

357
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,008
[siren]

358
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,305
No way!

359
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,607
Erin?.

360
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,774
I got a report of an
abandoned vehicle.

361
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,819
I guess it wasn't
abandoned after all.

362
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:18,617
Uh, this looks bad
but you have to trust
me on this.

363
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,850
Nothing happened.

364
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,155
You're a
real pig, Les.

365
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,626
What?.

366
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:26,186
You let Big Bo
cram his tongue
down your throat!

367
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,095
That's all I did!

368
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,633
That's all that
happened here!

369
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,431
You must
think I'm real
stupid, huh?.

370
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,464
[sigh]

371
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,504
Mr. Patterson!
Mr. Cooley!

372
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,407
I got a question
about killin'!

373
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,710
You said something
about killin'?.

374
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,913
Now don't Iisten
to a word

375
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,685
that son of
a bitch says.

376
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,750
You wanna know
about killin',
you ask me.

377
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,557
It's about
killin' snakes.

378
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,088
Belly crawlers
are a particular
specialty of mine.

379
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,929
You couldn't
catch a snake

380
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,163
if it had two
tails on it!

381
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,034
I could catch
more than you!

382
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,801
Like hell
you could.

383
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,809
Please! This ain't
your average snake.

384
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,778
It's an Unteka.
Y'all heard of it?.

385
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:52,681
A long time ago.
Never seen
one though.

386
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:56,517
Nobody has.
Just some injun
spook story.

387
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,557
Like the boogie man
for little injun kids.

388
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,421
What's the story?.

389
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,893
A big monster snake
that supposedly

390
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,863
ate up a
bunch of injun
1 00 years ago.

391
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,062
If so, if somebody,
and I'm not saying
it's me,

392
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,331
uh, were to let
the snake loose,

393
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,535
how would that person,
who's not me, go
about killin' it?.

394
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,474
Unless he's
full-grown,

395
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,035
I suppose you
could kill it like
any other snake.

396
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,102
You could
shoot it.

397
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,409
You could
burn it.

398
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,918
Or you could stab it
right in the brain.

399
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:04,178
[hissing]

400
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:09,420

401
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,842

Bow wow, bow wow.

405
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,036
Good girl.

406
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,421
You're drinking?.

407
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,287
Yeah. So?.

408
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,055
What happened
to heaven and hell?.

409
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,221
It's been a pretty
rough day, okay?.

410
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,924
What's wrong
with you?.

411
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:25,527
Oh, you know,
snake troubles.

412
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,594
Ah, sorry, dude.

413
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,230
Where's Ma?.

414
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,969
Mm. Out having
fun, I guess.

415
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,068
Shouldn't you be
out with Erin?.

416
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:38,343
Yeah, well,
girl trouble.

417
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,849
We should get
some more beers.

418
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,380
(Les)
Oh, God,
and her eyes,

419
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,652
don't get me
started on her eyes.

420
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,560
Erin's got the
most beautiful
blue eyes.

421
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:54,723
Yeah, her eyes,
her smile, her
hair! Yeah! Yeah!

422
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,664
I think we've heard
all we want to hear

423
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,828
about the late
great Erin Seymour.

424
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,097
If you love
her so much,

425
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,604
why don't you
just marry her?.

426
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,608
(man at bar)
Yeah! What's
the matter?

427
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,234
It's 'cause
he's afraid.

428
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,938
Shut up.

429
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,038
Yeah. He's afraid
of getting married.

430
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,085
Afraid of movin' out
of his mama's house.

431
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:17,121
Afraid of snakes.

432
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,382
Afraid of everything.

433
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,481

00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,980
what exactly did
you do last night?.

533
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,488
What do
you mean?.

534
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,217
Easy, Bo.

535
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,125
What I mean is,
I find you on my
girlfriend's porch,

536
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:20,755
sunny side drunk,
bloody knuckles,
torn clothes.

537
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,355
Looks a
little fishy,
that's all.

538
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,923
That's enough, Bo!

539
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,992
I was at the bar.

540
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,662
And what about
the blood?.

541
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:32,107
Well, me and Duff,
we kind of fought.

542
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,304
And now
he's dead.

543
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:38,837
What, you--?.
Are you saying
I killed my family?.

544
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,816
I didn't say
it. You did.

545
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,946
Oh, okay, then
Sherlock, who killed
all the chickens?.

546
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,887
Oh, I don't know,
the cat?.

547
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,515
Oh, then
who killed
the cat?.

548
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,559
The dog?.

549
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:50,821
Then who
killed the dog?.

550
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,692
No, don't tell me,
I did that too!

551
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:56,927
That's a formal confession.
I'll need to get my
tape recorder.

552
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,138
You can be
a real ass.

553
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,080
Les, wait!

554
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,087
Don't listen to him.
I believe you.

555
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,558
Last time
I saw him,
we fought.

556
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,255
I'm gonna have
to live with that
the rest of my life.

557
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,525
[sigh]

558
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,198
Come on.
Let's go.

559
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,696
(Les)
I just
can't believe

560
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,498
someone in town
could've done this.

561
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,970
(Erin)
Maybe it
wasn't a person.

562
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,165
What do
you mean?.

563
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,640
It could've been
an animal

564
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,473
Iike a bear,
or cougar, maybe.

565
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:20,142
No, there'd be
bodies, or--
parts at least.

566
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:22,884
Whoa!

567
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,922
[man gasps]

568
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,988
My goats!
My goats!

569
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,219
What is it?.

570
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,125
You folks won't
believe this.

571
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,562
My goats.
My goats.

572
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,540
See? I told you.
Look. My goats!

573
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,770
Oh, God.
It smells awful!

574
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,678
Yesterday, I had
20 of the finest goats
you could ever find.

575
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,478
And today
I've got--

576
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,382
I don't know
what the hell
I've got.

577
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,511
Not much.

578
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,952
What the hell
are these things?.

579
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,286
Remains. Blood,
bones, hair.

580
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,257
Where's it all
coming from?

581
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,657
[bleating]

582
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,024
One's still alive.

583
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,426
That's Gerty!
Come on!

584
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,488
Oh my God!

585
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,158
What the hell
happened to her!

586
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,826
Put her out
of her pain!

587
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:12,630
I don't--

588
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:13,727
[bleats]

589
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,203
Whoa! You
gonna shoot her?.

590
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,637
Why?. You
want to do it?.

591
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,698
No.

592
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,973
We can't just
let it suffer.

593
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:30,915
(Les)
These things,

594
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,478
where could they
be coming from?

595
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,524
Any animal could do it
if it was big enough.

596
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,082
What kind
of animal?.

597
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,323
Well, this might
sound crazy but,
snakes could.

598
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,988
Snakes!?.

599
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,555
When they
swallow their prey,

600
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,760
they lay dormant
and allow their
food to digest,

601
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,234
and whatever
they can't digest,

602
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,295
bones, hair, teeth,
they regurgitate.

603
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:50,931
They puke it up.

604
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,499
Yeah. And then
they go looking for
something else to eat.

605
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,101
What kind
of snake
would eat

606
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,544
a whole herd
of goats?

607
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,377
I got your
call, sweetie.

608
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,110
What the hell
happened down here?.

609
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,709
I don't know, but
something's killed
Getty's goats.

610
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:08,053
Does anybody know
what that something
might be?

611
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,524
Not yet.

612
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,584
I'd like to hear
what Mr. ambulance
driver here

613
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,425
has to say
about what's
going on.

614
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,826
Well, I think
it could be--

615
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,303
a snake.

616
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,170
I'm sorry,
I think l
misheard you.

617
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,141
You said you
think a snake's
done all this?.

618
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,541
Yeah, I did.

619
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:30,774
Your family's dead,
you have a motive.

620
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,043
Circumstantial evidence
all over your knuckles.

621
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,917
No alibi,
say mountain lion,
wolf, something.

622
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,511
But snake?.

623
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,454
I think
he might
be right.

624
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:44,688
I'm gettin' sick
and tired of hearing
all about this snake stuff.

625
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,855
Why don't you come
with me? You're
under arrest.

626
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:47,829
What?

627
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,456
What are
you doin'?.!

628
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,558
Until I find out
what's goin' on
around here,

629
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,865
I'm gonna keep
a close eye
on this one.

630
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,200
Bo, wait!

631
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,263
I ain't waitin'
fer nothin', Erin!

632
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,437
(Les)
Listen to me,
you idiot.

633
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,842
You're making
a big mistake!

634
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,573
You got no
charges here!

635
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,615
I gave you
the right to
remain silent.

636
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,617
Fer God's sakes,
won't you use
it already?.

637
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:11,052
Listen.
You gotta
listen to me.

638
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,385
Now, more people
are gonna start
dyin' here!

639
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,891
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

640
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,397
You arrogant
redneck bonehead!
Listen to me!

641
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,894
There's no
shower in here!

642
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,142
(Mom)
Okay, you
pick one now.

keeps buggin' me!

be a wuss.

646
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,696
James, don't
play dirty.

647
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,701
Hey, come on,
cut it out.

strange noises]

Hey, guys!
Cut it out!

651
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,037
Go wash up
for dinner.

00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:24,293
[gasp]
Kaylee, get the boys
and get in the car.

653
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,157
Why?.

654
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,856
Do it now!

655
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:32,527
[gasp]
Derek! James!
Get in the truck!

656
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:33,763
Hurry up!

657
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:34,667
Mom, why?.

658
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:35,397
Get in the car!

659
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,372
Cool.

660
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,170
Go!!

661
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,370
You are not
gettin' my family!

662
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,454
Alright, bring
it on!

663
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:59,217
This one's for
the good old red,
white and blue!

666
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,164
No no!

667
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,365
Ah! Ah! Ahhh!

670
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,916
Get back!

00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,957
No! No!

[siren]

674
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,424
Bo, I'm glad
you're here.

675
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,725
Something's happened
to the Jensen family.

676
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,493
The campsite's
been abandoned.

677
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,431
Maybe they're hiking.

678
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,595
No. The glass,
it's shattered and there's
blood all on in the inside.

679
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:53,200
Hmm. Maybe they wrecked
their jeep and, uh,
went lookin' for help.

680
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,973
Not likely.
They were probably
hiding from somebody

681
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:58,310
or some thing that
was trying to
attack them.

682
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,442
Something?.
Like a bear?.

683
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:05,454
No, look at these.
There's bite-marks.
Long narrow teeth.

684
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,285
And they're
in pairs.

685
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:09,882
So whatever
we're Iooking for,
it only has two teeth?

686
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,393
Like a snake.

687
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:16,728
Or maybe
even a vampire!
[Iaughs]

688
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,131
[car honks]

689
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:30,374
Now, Bo,
do tell me.

690
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,642
What's the
big emergency?.

691
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:36,584
Well, it seems we
have a real problem
on our hands.

692
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,143
I see
you have.

693
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:41,658
Yeah, but the
boys and I are
all over it.

694
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:45,388
Ha. Sure you
don't need some
bigger guns?.

695
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,623
Maybe I oughta
place a call to
the city.

696
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,099
No, we can
handle this.
I swear it.

697
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,863
Any idea
what you
up against?.

698
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,200
Mr. Kornferry,
I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

699
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,502
but I think we have
a giant snake
on the loose.

700
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,132
You say
we have
a what now?.

701
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,541
A snake.

702
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:02,806
No, I'm serious.

703
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,438
We should alarm
the whole town.

704
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,379
Maybe even call off
the county fair.

705
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,783
Cancel the fair?.
It's only a
day away.

706
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,014
Sir, I have
a PhD. in zoology,

707
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,956
and I know
a lot about animals.
Snakes in particular.

708
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,892
And this is definitely
the work of a
giant snake.

709
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:21,727
Right. Some
magically disappearin'
monster snake?.

710
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:25,131
Okay, that's enough.
You're embarrassing
yourself now.

711
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:28,069
No, I know about
snakes. They hunt
in three ways.

712
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,834
Smells in the air,
vibrations in the
ground and heat.

713
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,671
If there is a giant
snake out there,

714
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,211
that country fair
is gonna be one
big dinner.

715
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:38,112
The fair is the
biggest exhibition
of the year.

716
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,842
It'll be
a bloodbath.

717
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:44,980
Okay, you're officially in
charge of hunting the
phantom snake.

718
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,513
You gather your boys
and find out whoever
did this

719
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,650
or whatever
did this!

720
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,489
I know what
I'm talking about!

721
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:52,926
Simmer down,
little britches!

722
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:54,224
Nobody is
listening to me!

723
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,163
You just let
Big Bo take
care of this.

724
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,224
If you're afraid
of that big bad snake,

725
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,930
then you just stay
out of the woods,
Iittle darlin'.

726
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:01,971
Come on, mayor!

727
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,840
There you go.

728
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:59,322
[birds calling,
wood creaking]

729
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,886
[wood cracks]

730
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,524
Hello?.
Somebody there?.

731
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,675
(female voice)
Where should
I put this?

732
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,076
(Bo)
[indistinct]

733
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:53,082
This one?.

734
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,380
The one on
the bottom.

735
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,524
[Les, whisper]
What are you
doing here?.

736
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:17,233
Getting you
out of here before
Big Bo finds out.

737
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,672
Why?.

738
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,642
Because you're the
only one who
believes me.

739
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,268
I'm the only one
who believes you.

740
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,142
So we might as well
do this together.

741
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,206
What about
Big Bo?.

742
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:30,378
This snake
is a lot bigger
than Big Bo.

743
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:34,049
Bo, can you
look at this?.
Bo?.

744
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,591
Yeah.

745
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:48,597
You know,
Faye, you have,
uh, lovely eyes.

746
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,937
Bo, you're
not lookin'
at my eyes.

747
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,239
What about Erin?.

748
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,610
What about her?.

749
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,444
I thought you two
were together now.

750
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,611
She was all
over you
at the bar.

751
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:07,646
Erin, Iittle miss
perfect, she's a tease.

752
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:12,252
I'm a man, Faye,
and men have needs.

753
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,225
Whoa! What
the hell is that?.

754
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,028
It's a snake skin.

755
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,262
That's a snake skin?.

756
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,271
I found it
about a mile
up the river

757
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,240
from the latest killing.
Do you know how
long it is?.

758
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,468
Yeah, too
damn long!

759
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,636
Thirty feet.

760
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:29,838
Wonderful.

761
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,642
Do you want
to know the
bad news?.

762
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,206
Badder than
a 30-foot snake?.

763
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:35,774
Yeah.
It's growing.

764
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,514
This snake's
gonna get bigger?.

765
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:42,388
By the looks
of these marks,
it's growing fast.

766
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:45,622
What kind of snake
could grow this
big this fast?.

767
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,492
I don't know.
And I know snakes.

768
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:51,694
So whatever it is,
it must be extremely,
extremely rare.

769
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:56,296
Extremely rare,
extremely dangerous,
extremely awesome snake.

770
00:52:56,373 --> 00:53:00,332
Uh, it's something
my brother said to me
before he--disappeared.

771
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,037
I don't get it.

772
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:05,309
See, I know it's
gonna sound crazy,

773
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,816
but the day before
my brother--died,

774
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:10,409
he brought
this thing home.
A snake in a jar.

775
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,853
He said it was
extremely rare
and dangerous.

776
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,756
When that jar broke,
I swear that snake
doubled in size.

777
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,315
You gotta
be kidding.

778
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,089
There was
something different
about that snake.

779
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,993
Know where
it came from?.

780
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:24,431
No, he just kept
it in this disgusting
little jar.

781
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,934
Do you still
have it?.

782
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,197
No, I threw it
in the trash.

783
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,829
I'll bet you
it's still there.

784
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,703
Come on,
it might give
us some clues.

785
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,359
(officer)
Bo!

786
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,923
What the heck
are you doing?.

787
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,730
Can't you see
I got my hands
full here?.

788
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,771
You better come
take a look at this.

789
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,864
[sigh]
Alright.

790
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,374
I don't
get it, Bo.

791
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,741
I thought you said
there was no snake
out there.

792
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:09,938
Oh, shut up.

793
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,947
Whoa, that's
big. Ick.

794
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,482
Les is gone.
I just checked.

795
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,177
Oh, son of a--

796
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,277
I thought somebody
was watching
the cell.

797
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,948
Yeah, somebody
was supposed to be.

798
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:23,618
We aren't really
going out to catch
this thing, are we?.

799
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,890
Maybe it's time
to call in
the cavalry.

800
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:31,093
Break out
the shotguns
and gas up the ATVs.

801
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:35,501
We got ourselves
a big-ass snake
to kill.

802
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,468
[engines running
loud and fast]

803
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,800
(Bo)
Oh, Christ.

804
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,670
It's shedding more skin.
That means it's
still growing.

805
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,504
(officer without hat)
I hope not.

806
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:05,322
What the hell
is that?.

807
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:15,233
Oh, it's what's left
of the Jensen family!

808
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,170
(Bo)
How can this thing
be eating so much?.

809
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,939
(officer with hat)
Come on, guys.

810
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,707
Let's get
out of here.

811
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,147
[scream]

812
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,954
(officer without hat)
Bo, watch out!

813
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:42,157
[screams]

814
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:54,205
(Bo)
[gasping]
No! No!

815
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:56,177
Bo!!

816
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,807
[much gasping]

817
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,219
Oh, G--
Oh, God.

818
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:15,754
[screaming]

819
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,131
[Bo sobbing]

820
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:28,838
[sobbing]
Help me!

821
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:34,976
[shouts with echo]
Somebody, please
help me!

822
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,053
[shrieks]

823
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,639
[sobs]
Please help me.

824
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,212
Help me!

825
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,803
[shrieks with pain]

826
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,307
[dog barking]

827
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,570
What in
the hell--?.

828
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,448
Wait for me!

829
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:43,550
Hey, slow down.

830
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,612
Who's out there?.

831
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,886
I'm over here.
Please help me.

832
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:53,354
PIease.

833
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,624
It's late
and I'm drunk.

834
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,360
You better have
a damn good
excuse for this.

835
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:00,766
Please help me.
Please.

836
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,203
What happened?.

837
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:06,902
Please help me.
Oh, Christ,
please help me.

838
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:10,070
Come on, boy.
Say it!

839
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,170
Snake.

840
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,771
Snake?.

841
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:17,552
I might be
half drunk,

842
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,451
but did he say
a snake did this?.

843
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,183
Snake.

844
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,490
Oh. He's dead.

845
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,261
Snake. That's what
I was afraid of.

846
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,029
That's what it
sounded like to me.

847
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,123
You okay?.

848
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,990
Yeah, I just
don't know
if I can do this.

849
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:00,427
What?.

850
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,932
I haven't been
here since--

851
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,434
I just don't know
if I can see
that again.

852
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:09,164
We gotta
get that jar.

853
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:22,474
[Les sighs deeply]

854
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,213
Okay, where
are we going?.

855
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,152
The kitchen.

856
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,957
Now he had the snake
on the table there.

857
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,496
And it broke
down there,
which means

858
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,862
it's gotta be
back here somewhere.

859
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:41,836
Probably--right here.

860
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,673
Look.

861
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:52,044
Yeah, that's
it alright.

862
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,145
Check this out.

863
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,777
What's it say?.

864
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,321
I don't know.

865
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:03,348
Some sort of native
North American symbols.

866
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:06,486
[creaking footsteps]

867
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:16,796
(Les)
Patterson!

868
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:22,774
Lester, long
time no see.

869
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,939
Yeah, what are y'all
doing here so Iate
at night and--

870
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:26,982
so heavily armed?.

871
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,677
Huntin' snakes.

872
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:29,979
You saw
the snake?.

873
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,884
Not us.
Big Bo.

874
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:33,683
But he didn't live
long enough
to tell.

875
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:34,723
He's dead?.!

876
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,258
Extremely.

877
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:39,192
Folks in town said
something fishy

878
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,695
is going on up
at your place.

879
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,924
We just thought
we'd come and have
a look around.

880
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,695
You're gonna
want to take a
look at this.

881
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,566
Day before he died
my brother brought
a snake in a jar.

882
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,939
It was different.
It grew real big
real fast.

883
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:54,999
Unteka.

884
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,067
Exactly!

885
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:57,077
Unteka?.

886
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:58,670
That's what
Duff said.

887
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:01,308
There's symbols
on the jar.

888
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,215
Y'all know
what they mean?.

889
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,150
Lemme see that.

890
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,278
Recognize it?.

891
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,345
It's Native.
Kitawa.

892
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:08,754
What's that?.

893
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:12,591
Cherokees.
Great warriors.
Lots of legends.

894
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,426
Y'all know any
Kitawa around here?.

895
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:18,763
One, but he's
a real hard-ass.

896
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,531
I suppose you
know where we
can find him.

897
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,337
(Erin)
This can't be it.

898
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,104
I got
a feeling
it is.

899
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:46,593
(Les)
Hello?.

900
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:52,123
Hello?.

901
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:02,374
Hello!

902
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,542
I don't think
anybody's here.

903
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,316
Jeez.

904
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,424
(S. Hawk)
Who are you?

905
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,056
What are you
doing in my shop?.

906
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,498
Are you here
to steal from me?.

907
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:28,366
No, no, look,
I got this.

908
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:33,272
The jar!
It's broken!

909
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:35,003
Why did you
break the jar?.

910
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,942
I didn't.
That was
my brother.

911
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,277
That--Doug!

912
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:40,508
Duff Daniels!

913
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,210
Duff.

914
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,652
That slow-witted,
half-minded--

915
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,484
Yeah, he's dead.

916
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:51,516
So it's already eaten
something living too.

917
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,620
Well, it
gets worse.

918
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,790
How much?.

919
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:58,299
A whole hell
of a lot.

920
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:03,034
(Cooley)
How big you figure
that sonuvabitch is?

921
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,266
According to
legend, 70 feet.

922
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,868
Seventy feet?.
Are you serious?.

923
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,140
This ain't gonna
be enough.

924
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:15,014
Well, I'm fresh
out of dynamite
and plutonium.

925
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:17,609
There's gotta be
something else.

926
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:21,453
I got something.

927
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,684
Yeah?
What?

928
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:25,192
I just hope
you ain't
too attached

929
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,229
to that
there grill.

930
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:01,519
(Les)
They got a bunch of guns
down at the police station.

931
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,758
(S. Hawk)
Guns?.!

932
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,098
One cannot kill
Unteka in flesh.

933
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,603
One must kill
him from within.

934
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:15,838
Right. How exactly
does one kill him
from within?.

935
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:19,348
One must not fear
the heart of
the snake.

936
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,384
Alright. What
the hell does
that mean?.

937
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:26,046
As much as it needs
flesh and blood,
it needs fear.

938
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:29,091
It strengthens it,
gives it power.

939
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:33,117
It is the body he eats,
but it is the fear
he devours.

940
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,062
That's just a bunch of
mystical mumbo jumbo.

941
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,690
Maybe, but it
makes sense.

942
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,098
Think how
snakes hunt.

943
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,363
Through smells,
vibrations and heat.

944
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:42,870
When your body
reacts to fear,

945
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,169
it gives off signals
that would attract
a snake.

946
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:47,675
Only when you
are without fear,

947
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:50,405
can you kill
the snake's heart.

948
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:54,040
One cannot kill
Unteka in flesh.

949
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:57,517
One must kill
him from within.

950
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:00,316
So you're saying
your ancestors

951
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,687
actually went
inside the snake.

952
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,096
You're out of
your mind, let's
get out of here.

953
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,394
Wait, it makes
complete sense.

954
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,162
Snakes use venom,
fangs and constriction

955
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,759
to subdue
their prey.

956
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:16,998
To keep it from running
away before they
can swallow it.

957
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,337
If you don't
fear the snake,

958
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,706
it can swallow
you whole.

959
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:25,474
And then you
could kill it
from within.

960
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:51,395
Yeah?.

961
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:53,669
I feel that
sonuvabitch is
here somewhere!

962
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,712
Maybe we should
draw him out.

963
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:59,373
Yeah, play
something different.

964
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:00,972
What do you
want to hear?

965
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:04,110
Something with
a heap of
bass in it.

966
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:07,212
Something I
wouldn't mind
dying to.

967
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,990
Do it, boy.

968
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:13,926
Y eah, that's right.

969
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:16,430
So are you gonna
help us kill it?.

970
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,558
(S. Hawk)
My people,
the Kitawa,

971
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:22,798
have hunted
and destroyed
the great snakes.

972
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:28,276
My grandfathers
and their grandfathers
protected these lands.

973
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:36,309
Now, generations later
the Unteka has returned.

974
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,877
And brings a horror
of which you
cannot conceive.

975
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:44,392
It is with great pride
that I will help you
kill the Unteka.

976
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,725
And take my place
in Kitawa legend.

977
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,620
Golly! Drive
for it! Drive!

978
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,663
Step on
it, Patterson!

979
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:25,496
I see it!
Y eeha!

980
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:30,602
Speed it up!
He's gaining
on us!

981
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,470
Let's go!

982
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,305
[gasping]

983
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,115
[laughing]
Aghhhh!

984
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,349
Yeeha!

985
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:51,724
[gasping]

986
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,252
Yeeeha!
[laughs]

987
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:01,192
What?. Damn!
What's wrong with
this piece of junk?.

988
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:04,539
Get us out
of here!

989
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,006
Alright!

990
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,566
Don't spare
the squirrels!
Let's go!

991
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,182
[groaning]

992
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,723
Oh, dang it,
come on!

993
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,224
Get it out of here!
Get us out of here!

994
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:25,726
AIright! AIright!
Calm down!

995
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:28,160
There it is!
Come on!

996
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,630
Burn that rubber!
Let's go!

997
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:33,566
Come on, baby!
Come on!

998
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,536
Floor it!
It's a-comin'!

999
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:39,506
I'm gunnin' it!
Oh, crap!

1000
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:42,305
Come on, now!

1001
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:43,572
Hang on!

1002
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:45,671
Keep it going!

1003
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:49,013
Oh, my Ieg!

1004
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:51,382
My Ieg!
Ah!

1005
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:59,219
Run, Patterson, run!
[shouting]

1006
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:02,822
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

1007
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,025
For the Iove of--
Shoot, Patterson!

1008
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,035
Patterson, run!
Run!

1009
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,092
I'm gonna
help you!

1010
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:26,547
[shrieks]

1011
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:45,839
[groans]

1012
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,915
(Erin)
This is your
family's farm.

1013
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:02,921
This here
is old man
Rickenbacker's farm,

1014
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,153
and this is
where we found
the Jensen family.

1015
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:08,128
Remember what I told
you about how snakes
do their digesting?.

1016
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,529
Y eah, they swallow
it, lay around
digesting it,

1017
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,533
and puke the
rest up, right?.

1018
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,502
Right. So if snakes
have lairs and if
this snake has a lair,

1019
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:19,063
then it's gotta be somewhere
between these three
different attacks.

1020
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:21,632
What's between
these three points?.

1021
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:22,768
What?.

1022
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,676
[clears throat]

1023
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:25,645
Oh no.

1024
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:35,681
Welcome to opening night
of the Thornton
County Fair.

1025
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:38,852
And this awfully
unusual cold weather!

1026
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:41,487
[audience boos]

1027
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:44,498
Okay, boys and girls,
we got a big surprise
for you now.

1028
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:49,026
Feedback!
Feedback!

1029
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:57,673
Hi, kids!

1030
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:00,909
(all)
Hi, Feedback!

1031
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:04,009
Tonight I'm gonna teach
you guys about electricity,

1032
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,747
and the ways
to stay safe.

1033
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,763
[laughter]

1034
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:23,066
[thud, breaking glass]

1035
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:24,730
[loud laughter]

1036
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:38,183
(man with cap)
Let's go get
some food.

1037
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:39,948
We're so mad!

1038
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:46,588
You guys.
Where's my stash?.

1039
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:00,674
Ooh.
Ooh.

1040
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:01,937
Kitty-kitty.

1041
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,501
Come here, kitty.

1042
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:11,749
[laughter]

1043
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:17,087
[louder laughter]

1044
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,692
(male voice)
Come on, guys.
Everybody out.

1045
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:33,731
(female voice)
Okay, Katie.
Come on.

1046
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:35,436
Let's go,
Iet's go!

1047
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:38,605
[indistinct]

1048
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:44,744
[happy chatter]

1049
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:48,813
And you're not gonna
eat any food before
