<i>(Phone ringing)
As'salaamu alaikum, Yusef.</i>

2
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:49,667
<i>Wa-alaikum as-salaam Ummi.</i>

3
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,362
<i>We miss you, how's Buffalo?</i>

4
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:56,003
<i>Al'hamdulilah, I'm going to check out a house.
The flier says everyone there's Muslim.</i>

5
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:59,597
<i>Very good bita, you can live with them.
Better than the dorms.</i>

6
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:00,223
<i>Yep.</i>

7
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,335
<i>They will keep you focused
and out of trouble.</i>

8
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:03,792
<i>Insh'Allah.</i>

9
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:05,926
<i>Insh'Allah</i>

10
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:38,584
Yusef?

11
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:39,504
Yeah, Umar?

12
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,896
As'salaamu alaikum.

13
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:44,189
Wa-alaikum as-salaam.

14
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,078
So, is everyone here Muslim?

15
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:52,868
From a certain point of view.

16
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:55,109
Yeah, I didn't expect the
house to look like this.

17
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,644
Your room's over here brother.

18
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:20,708
Sorry.

19
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:29,272
This is Mustafa's old room.

20
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:31,714
He was a brother from Egypt.

21
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:37,753
You know, Mustafa used to get these for
free from the Saudi embassy all the time.

22
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:39,599
Y'akhi when he was here,

23
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,715
that was when we really had it,

24
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:45,111
a house that was true to Islam.

25
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:48,575
Insha'Allah we can return to that.

26
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:50,465
Insha'Allah.

27
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:06,960
Uh..Are you okay?

28
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:10,916
I am, the Amazing Ayyub.

29
00:04:10,943 --> 00:04:12,167
Nice to meet you.

30
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:15,188
Do you live here too or are you, uh….

31
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,139
Yeah. Sort of, man.

32
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:18,436
Cool.

33
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:21,370
Is that a fucking camera dude?
This is like video, right?

34
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,300
Yeah I need to recharge
the batteries for that.

35
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:24,737
If you could please.

36
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,047
Do You know anything about computers?

37
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:28,726
The password, it's, I gotta reset it.

38
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,552
I should really get to studying now. Oh!

39
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:33,763
Ah, no no let me get it, naw, I got it.

40
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:37,295
Aw you're smearing it now.
You're really smearing it.

41
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:42,192
Yusef man! You're gonna fit in….

42
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:46,863
You're gonna fit in my balls!

43
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,849
Welcome to the house.

44
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,968
I feel really welcome, thank you.

45
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:54,910
I'm just gonna….

46
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:08,784
Salaam-alaik.

47
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:09,641
Wa alaikum as…

48
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,466
I was just looking for something to drink.

49
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,953
Aw, well, there's plenty to drink.

50
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:17,993
No, I was thinking something halal.

51
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:21,526
Oh, halal? Well you've gotta
be specific in this place.

52
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,186
Jazakullah khair. (Thank you)

53
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:32,651
You're the new guy, right?

54
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:34,484
Salaam, I'm Yusef.

55
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:35,458
I'm Rabeya.

56
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,692
Have a seat.

57
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:46,290
Um actually I have to be
going because I have, um…

58
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:49,176
I have um class in a bit, so I ….

59
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,560
Oh right, right every time a man and a woman
are alone shaytan is the third present.

60
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,330
Yes, No… I mean no that's not it

61
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,117
I just, uh...

62
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,288
Well did you make your fajr prayer yet?

63
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,113
Sorry… You have to count
me out, I'm ragging it.

64
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,341
Okay.

65
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:09,798
Umar y'akhi?

66
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:13,301
Umar y'akhi?

67
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:18,317
Umar y'akhi, wake up, it's
time for fajr prayer.

68
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,200
Salam Yusef.

69
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:23,395
Go make wudhu, I'll follow after you.

70
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,151
Okay.

71
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,889
Bimillahir rahmanir raheem.

72
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:42,167
La ilaha illa Allah.

73
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:45,423
Fuck.

74
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:48,543
Asalams, man.

75
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:51,607
Wa asalaams. I'm Yusef.

76
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:54,588
Jehangir.

77
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,198
Nice to meet you.

78
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,282
I'm Fasiq.

79
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:02,391
You're the new guy, right?

80
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:03,931
Yeah.

81
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:08,373
You should have been out here
with us last night y'akhi.

82
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:10,631
Oh no, I'm not much of a partier.

83
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,865
No worries man.

84
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:20,611
Come on, get out here, come on.

85
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:22,722
Yeah?

86
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:23,906
Come check out the view, come on.

87
00:08:29,494 --> 00:08:31,330
Wa salaams man.

88
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:42,931
Calling us out to prayer on your guitar?

89
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:46,275
That's bid'ah.

90
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,023
Okay. It's bid'ah.

91
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,716
Hey you know, Umar….

92
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,086
It's only Muslims who use the term
innovation to mean something bad.

93
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:15,594
Don't forget that you're
Muslim too… Aren't you?

94
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,341
La ilaha illa Allah.

95
00:09:33,298 --> 00:09:34,429
Umar….

96
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,079
Y'akhi….

97
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,469
The adhan has been called,
if we're gonna pray….

98
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:44,507
Let's pray….

99
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:03,806
<i>These Muslims don't respect freedom, they don't respect
capitalism, and they don't respect our way of life!</i>

100
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:09,448
<i>We can't coexist with these people.
And, and the liberals, their starting to find that out.</i>

101
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,537
<i>Look, it's a proven fact.
It's been documented!</i>

102
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:16,120
<i>Radical Shiites are coming to America and
going on welfare.</i> Shut the fuck up!

103
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:21,218
<i>Then they send their welfare checks back
to Iran to support its nuclear program!</i>

104
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,750
Y'akhi.

105
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:34,503
It's not a good idea to be drinking tea.

106
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:35,879
Why not?

107
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:38,267
Caffeine is a stimulant.

108
00:10:38,923 --> 00:10:43,162
Know, I wouldn't go as far as calling
tea haram, but it's at least makrooh.

109
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:45,232
Tea is makrooh?

110
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:49,040
Brother, it's a plague amongst
the Muslim world is what it is.

111
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,347
Salam.

112
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:56,890
It's great….

113
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:59,937
All you need to get rid
of Umar is a vagina!

114
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,419
Bro, how do you fix this thing man?

115
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:04,814
What are you doing?

116
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:08,008
Ayyub come on, please, you're gonna break
my camera, that was a present for Eid.

117
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:10,686
Yo, fuck that shit, fix this
and let's go fucking skate!

118
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:11,882
Skate?

119
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:46,794
Move! Move! Move! Fucking nut.

120
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,038
Douchbag!

121
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:53,778
Yo, when you gonna hook it up with
some of these taqwacores tapes bro?

122
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:56,883
Ah man, those fuckers only put
their shit out on vinyl, man.

123
00:11:57,293 --> 00:12:01,531
Yeah, they like to be all orthodox about
it but, uh, for you Amazing Ayyub…

124
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:03,705
I think I can put something together.

125
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:05,083
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

126
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:07,102
- Thanks bro.
- Absolutely brother.

127
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:09,120
What do you guys mean by that?

128
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:10,304
What?

129
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,100
Taqwacores.

130
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:13,810
Aw shit.

131
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:15,224
Yusef jaan.

132
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:19,787
Come on man, how long you been
in the house for, brother?

133
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:22,117
Taqwacore….

134
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:24,520
Taqwacore y'akhi.

135
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:26,636
Vote Hezbollah.

136
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:27,752
The Kominas.

137
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:28,840
One Trip Abroad.

138
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,030
AIThawra.

139
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:31,873
Osama's Tunnel Diggers.

140
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,889
The West coast Muslim punk scene.

141
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,542
Khalifornia.

142
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:38,180
Muslim punk scene?

143
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:38,972
Yeah…

144
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:42,866
all the crazy fuck ups and rejects
of the community, coming together man.

145
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:45,504
Starting bands, putting on shows.

146
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:47,501
Nobody likes em.

147
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:52,263
The Muslims say they're not really Muslim,
the punks say they aren't really punk.

148
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:54,525
What's a punk in the first place?

149
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,362
I mean who knows any more, man.
Some say it's about busting social taboos.

150
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,918
Some say it's about being loud...

151
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:03,813
Everybody's got their own opinion.

152
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:05,980
What do you think it means?

153
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,620
I think it's just about being ugly.

154
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,579
That's why you can't be punk.

155
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:17,450
You look too good.

156
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:25,054
Watch this shit.

157
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:28,746
Shit, shit, shit, yo check
this out, check this out.

158
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,790
Y'akhi!

159
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:40,230
Dude, are you okay?

160
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:42,302
- You alright?
- That was fucking awesome man!

161
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:43,204
Are you alright?

162
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,857
Yeah, holy shit.

163
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:50,123
Fuck, Mash'Allah man, I was in the air so long it
was like I had time to stop being nervous, brother.

164
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:53,171
Yusef, you gotta get that shit
in a skateboard video man.

165
00:13:53,194 --> 00:13:54,407
Fuck that, I'm gonna to land it right now.

166
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,409
Bullshit you are.

167
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:57,374
You okay?

168
00:13:57,861 --> 00:13:59,195
Turn that shit off for a second.

169
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:01,358
Oh, sure.

170
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:02,781
Listen man.

171
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:06,103
Next Friday, we're holding jumauh prayer

172
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,104
and we're gonna do it right at the house.

173
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,240
Are you serious?

174
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:10,455
Yeah, I'm serious.

175
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:13,063
Jehangir, who would come?

176
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,362
These Muslims y'akhi.

177
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,896
The ones who don't quite fit in
at the Muslim center picnics.

178
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:20,575
The boys who miss their prayers.

179
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,203
The girls who date behind
their parents backs.

180
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:26,800
The ones who ask too many
questions during Saturday school.

181
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,776
I can't believe Umar's allowing this.

182
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:38,067
At the end of the day …

183
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:41,354
he'd rather see this than another party.

184
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,884
And you know y'akhi, deep down even Umar knows
he doesn't quite fit in at the masjid any more.

185
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,363
What do you think they see
when he walks in the door?

186
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:54,509
What about an imam?

187
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:57,731
Don't we need somebody to lead this?

188
00:14:58,853 --> 00:14:59,918
That's the best part.

189
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:05,024
It is said in the Quran that Allah
spoke directly to the virgin Mary.

190
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:09,976
It is said that she was instructed
to teach Islam to her people.

191
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:14,776
She was told that something was going to
happen and that thing did indeed happen.

192
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:21,036
And do you know what that sounds like to me?
It sounds like the virgin Mary was a prophet of Islam.

193
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:23,922
So, why do we not consider her one?

194
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,902
She wasn't given a scripture but
I say that her book was her son.

195
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,233
So that's my khutbah.

196
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:36,799
Let's pray.

197
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:38,063
Takbir!

198
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:39,774
Allahu Akbar.

199
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:54,118
Allahu Akbar.

200
00:15:58,101 --> 00:15:59,223
<i>As'salaamu alaikum, Yusef.</i>

201
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:00,652
<i>Wa alaikum as-salaam Abu.</i>

202
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:03,751
<i>How are your classes?
Still straight A's?</i>

203
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:04,921
<i>Yes Abu, al'hamdulilah.</i>

204
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:10,439
<i>How are your housemates? They keeping you in the dean?
You reading your namaz regularly?</i>

205
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:11,910
<i>Yes, Yes Abu.</i>

206
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:13,625
<i>Al-Hamdulilah.</i>

207
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:25,671
Oh, peace.

208
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,133
Hello.

209
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,132
Hi, I'm Lynn, I'm a friend of Fasiq's.

210
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:29,907
I'm Yusef.

211
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:32,263
Nice to meet you.

212
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:33,677
Is he here?

213
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,235
Is who here?

214
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:35,978
Fasiq.

215
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:41,573
I don't know.
I think… I don't think so actually.

216
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:44,758
That sucks, I just thought
I'd try and say hi.

217
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:45,478
Lynn!

218
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,020
- Jehangir!
- Salaam, how are you?

219
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:50,584
So what's the good word?

220
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:52,601
I'm just out for a jog.

221
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,865
You don't come around much?

222
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:58,198
I know. I've just been super
busy with summer classes.

223
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:00,322
But I hear you guys are
having Friday prayer now.

224
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,100
Yeah…everyone's taking turns leading.

225
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,852
It's beautiful, you gotta come out.

226
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:07,512
Oh yeah? Totally, I'm there.

227
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:14,046
Well, um, I better get back to
running but I'll see you guys soon.

228
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:15,585
Yeah, insh'Allah

229
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,707
- bye.
- Salaam sister.

230
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,543
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

231
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,215
What

232
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:35,292
Look at this.
I've got Omar's keys. Beer run?

233
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:49,751
You're frightening me!

234
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:56,937
You're crazy.

235
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,367
You give it a shot man.

236
00:17:58,704 --> 00:17:59,514
Give what a shot?

237
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,619
Come on, yell something.

238
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:01,145
What?

239
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:02,301
Come on.

240
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,470
Here, up ahead. That old dude.

241
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:05,618
- What? No.
- Come on, don't be afraid.

242
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:07,734
Okay, okay. Uh….

243
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:12,656
Hurry up, hurry!

244
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:15,224
You make me really nervous!

245
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:20,920
What'd the guy do?

246
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:24,633
I don't think he understood
what's going on.

247
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:32,522
It's fucking hilarious man.

248
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:39,177
What's up with that girl Lynn?

249
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,288
What do you mean?

250
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:43,414
I mean, like, is she a Muslim?

251
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:48,506
She is a convert.
Or revert as I'm supposed to say.

252
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:53,772
You know, a Catholic girl who loved
Rumi … the whole idea of no priesthood.

253
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,144
One love. One God. All that shit, you know?

254
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:02,808
But I guess she kind of burnt out man.

255
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,809
So she's not a Muslim any more?

256
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,593
You'll have to ask her about that brother.

257
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,158
Here we go, right here.

258
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:15,343
- Right here? - Yeah yeah, pull over.
- Hold on, I have to signal.

259
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,646
Alright, you gotta signal.

260
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:21,479
- Right here, right here. Turn the corner.
- Hold on, let me signal. Let me signal.

261
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:24,689
My mom would be very proud of me right now.

262
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:29,061
- Why?
- Hanging out with a good boy like you.

263
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:35,488
Amazing Ayyub always hooks
up the free booze man.

264
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,650
Five bucks says he isn't wearing a shirt.

265
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:47,884
Give me some! Give me some!

266
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,181
I'm so fucking happy you guys are here!

267
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:55,376
Get on it! Get on it! Get on it!

268
00:19:58,874 --> 00:20:00,309
What the fuck are you fucks doing here man?

269
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:05,475
Well we're here to undermine the fucking U.S.
Economy so fill her up mate! Fill her up!

270
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:06,392
Alright, I'll be right back.

271
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,716
Is it okay he jumped on the…
Umar's not going to notice….

272
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:11,937
Shut the-dude, why do you worry so much?

273
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:13,825
Worrying is a sin.

274
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,325
Aren't you gonna get in trouble for this?

275
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:24,857
Fuck this place man. I get more loot
giving hand jobs at Niagra Falls man.

276
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,203
Great. Umar's gonna kill me.

277
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:30,211
Dude, you want one?

278
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:33,379
- No. - Here. - No, I don't want it.

279
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:37,873
You're just a straight edge guy, huh?
You're just all nice and all.

280
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,492
You guys, I gotta give these cumbuckets
some gas, I'll be right back.

281
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,118
Asalaam. What do you guys want?

282
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,945
- A-Salaama-lick my balls mother fucker.
- What the fuck did you say.

283
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:49,078
Thank you, come again!

284
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:52,571
Stupid mother fuckers. Fucking Dickwads.

285
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,652
Oh shit, you didn't fucking
kick my car mother fucker!?

286
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:04,667
Catch me!

287
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:13,900
The desire for freedom resides
in every human heart.

288
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:19,838
And that desire cannot be contained forever by
prison walls or Marshall laws or secret police.

289
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:23,453
Over time and across the earth,
freedo m will find a way.

290
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:31,789
<i>Hey Yusef, is that you?</i>

291
00:21:32,342 --> 00:21:33,755
Uh, yeah.

292
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,912
<i>Come in here a sec.</i>

293
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:38,772
You want me to come into the room?

294
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:42,727
<i>What the fuck do you think I
mean by, come in here a sec?</i>

295
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,970
Okay.

296
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,308
Hey.

297
00:22:02,678 --> 00:22:04,314
I like your room.

298
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:06,481
It's a ceiling and some walls.

299
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,128
Who's this?

300
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:18,679
Secret Trial Five. They're an all
girl taqwacore band from Vancouver.

301
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,586
So Lynn came by the other day.

302
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,862
She thinks you're cute.

303
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:26,257
Are you serious?

304
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:30,513
Yeah, I was kinda surprised too.
Anyways, do you like her?

305
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:36,863
Oh, I mean, she's nice and stuff.
But I … don't know about liking girls and stuff like that.

306
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:38,349
What.

307
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:42,858
Okay, I mean, like, finding out
if someone likes you, and then…

308
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:45,075
… if you like them, and ask them if
they want to go to the movies ...

309
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:47,611
People don't do that any more Yusef.

310
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:48,987
What do you mean?

311
00:22:49,027 --> 00:22:55,126
Basically, you just hang out with someone and then
sooner or later you hook up with that person.

312
00:22:55,127 --> 00:23:02,267
And then one of the people gets jealous …so you
decide to only hook up with each other… and then….

313
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:07,235
Bam! You're in a relationship.

314
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:08,417
Oh.

315
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:18,495
Why don't you just, like… hang out
with her and see what's gonna happen.

316
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:26,525
Okay. Cool. What's this?

317
00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:28,343
What?

318
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:32,210
This. You, you crossed out a
whole ayat in the Qur'an.

319
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:34,524
Yeah, which one is that?

320
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:36,711
Let me see, um….

321
00:23:37,654 --> 00:23:39,491
Four, Four-thirty four.

322
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:42,725
Right, I didn't need that one any more.

323
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:47,609
What, you just felt like you could cross out
the word of God? I mean, you can't do that.

324
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:51,917
Well that ayat advises men to beat their
wives so what do I need that for.

325
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:56,501
No, you can't do that. And most translators say that
it means to beat lightly and their's a story of Job

326
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,303
where he used a blade of grass.

327
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:02,291
Yeah, Yusef, I know. I read what all the
scholars said okay, even the progressives.

328
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:05,187
I did all the tap dancing around that
verse that a desperate Muslim could do.

329
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:08,013
And in the end, you know what I said?

330
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:15,331
I said fuck it. And now, I feel a
whole lot better about the Quran.

331
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,150
I mean it's kinda weird coming
from a girl in a burqa.

332
00:24:18,151 --> 00:24:19,986
What about my burqa?

333
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:27,631
No, I mean… I meant, uh, you know… It must
be kinda hard to, like, read and stuff.

334
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:30,520
- That's it, that's all I
meant…- Okay - in the burqa.

335
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:32,354
Here.

336
00:24:32,794 --> 00:24:35,039
Came out wrong. Sorry.

337
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,687
Here. This is for you.

338
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:40,892
What am I supposed to do with this?

339
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:44,220
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you wear it?

340
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:47,812
Alright well don't expect me
to wear this thing around town

341
00:24:47,813 --> 00:24:51,554
and like campus and stuff because
people are going to think I'm weird.

342
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:54,215
That's fair. Just so you have it.

343
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:57,002
Okay, well, al'hamdulilah.

344
00:24:57,766 --> 00:24:59,885
Shut the door all the way.

345
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:32,216
Hey. Why does Rabeya wear that full burqa?

346
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:35,053
What do you mean?

347
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:38,279
I mean, it's not for sunna,
we know that much.

348
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:41,869
You ever have a day you didn't
want anybody looking at you?

349
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:43,908
You think that's why she wears it?

350
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,873
Hey, what the fuck is this?!

351
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:51,996
What?! What now?

352
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:53,163
This.

353
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,462
That's my Quran.

354
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:08,447
Yeah? What's it doing in the bathroom?

355
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:10,729
These are the words of Allah
Subhananahu Wa Ta'Ala

356
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:13,864
I left it there because
it's fucking raining.

357
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,062
Weed's haram for a reason.
You do know that, right?

358
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:24,252
No, no, no, no. You see the Qur'an only forbids
alcohol, it don't say shit about weed.

359
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:26,179
Five-ninety man.

360
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:28,089
Two, two-one-nine.

361
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:29,674
That shit is khamr as anything else.

362
00:26:30,251 --> 00:26:32,088
The bathroom is filthy.

363
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:34,546
Well the whole house is filthy.

364
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:42,700
Yeah. You know, yeah, you're right.You know, back when
Mustafa lived here it could have never looked like this.

365
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,339
No, let me tell you
something about Mustafa.

366
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,415
Back when Mustafa lived here Rabeya, could
never sit in the fucking living room.

367
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:49,828
Hey, fuck off!

368
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:51,453
Fuck!

369
00:26:54,729 --> 00:27:00,319
You know… Umar just thinks I'm up here
getting faded, but I know my shit.

370
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:11,545
Here. In Suratual-Hijr.
Ayat 19 and 20.

371
00:27:12,821 --> 00:27:15,482
Allah sent suitable things
to grow on the Earth.

372
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:20,446
And with him are the treasures
of everything in the world.

373
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:24,666
And he only sent them
down in a known measure.

374
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,859
This tells us that things from
nature are a blessing from Allah.

375
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:38,016
And that he only sent us what
we could handle. Embrace it.

376
00:27:42,757 --> 00:27:44,043
Yo, you pumped up for tonight's party man?

377
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:45,852
Yeah.

378
00:27:45,877 --> 00:27:46,515
Dude, I'm gonna get my
dick wet, you're gonna

379
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:49,244
get your dick wet.
It's gonna be fuckin.

380
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:52,283
- Hey, uh… hey, hey, hey.
- Sweet bro.

381
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:56,143
I'm gonna stay back, okay?
I gotta ….

382
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,064
No, it's not like that.
I'm just gonna stay back.

383
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:00,636
Alright then, I'll just get
the forties …

384
00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:04,186
and the blunts and the condoms

385
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:07,425
- don't tell her you got herpes.
- Leave me alone.

386
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:15,988
Hey.

387
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:19,039
Hi. As'salaamu alaikum.

388
00:28:19,553 --> 00:28:20,572
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

389
00:28:21,418 --> 00:28:24,147
Fasiq's awesome, isn't he?
What a great khutba.

390
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:26,412
Yeah, it was really out there.

391
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,576
So is Jehangir having another one of his parties tonight?

392
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:31,077
Yeah, Insh’Allah

393
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:31,956
So cool.

394
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:35,257
 Friday afternoons all these
Muslims come out for khutbas

395
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:38,455
and then at night the punks
come in for beer and ass.

396
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:44,120
I don’t really think they’re Muslims though.

397
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:46,706
Why would you say that?

398
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,697
No, I mean like, from a
traditional stand point.

399
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,486
Personally, I’m not big on the
whole Islam is one way approach.

400
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:57,344
What do you mean?

401
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:01,160
I believe in Allah, you know?

402
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:04,510
I just, I don’t always call it Allah.

403
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:06,161
I pray the way I want to pray.

404
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,627
Sometimes it’ll be in a church and sometimes on a rug.

405
00:29:11,006 --> 00:29:11,955
Interesting.

406
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:14,152
Sorry, I don’t know…

407
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:16,745
- No. - it’s hard to explain, sometimes.
- It’s okay.

408
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:20,378
 It’s fine.
So, do you consider yourself a Muslim?

409
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,859
I don’t know. Why don’t you call
Allah and ask him yourself.

410
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:32,305
Good one.

411
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:40,873
Oh, my ride’s here.
I’ll see you tonight.

412
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:43,475
- Okay.
- Salaam.

413
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,717
- Oh oh oh, Yusef!
- Hi.

414
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,878
You have to meet Fatima.

415
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:18,505
Fatima, this is Yusef.
Hi.

416
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:19,529
Hi, nice to meet you.
I’m Yusef.

417
00:30:19,545 --> 00:30:24,803
Fatima just came back from San Francisco.
She was doing a documentary on the gay Muslim conference out there.

418
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:28,787
Yeah, was is right. I thought it
was going to be this crazy scene but

419
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:31,680
you’d be surprised how fundy some of those dudes were out there.

420
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,375
What do you mean?

421
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:38,483
Well like, okay they’re totally strict about prayers and everything.
And a lot of them will tell you straight up that gay sex is sin.

422
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:45,105
Could you imagine juggling that in your life?
Okay, but there was this awesome kid a guy named Muzzamil.

423
00:30:45,786 --> 00:30:49,687
And he’s starting his freshman year at UB in the fall.
So I’m going to introduce you guys when he gets here.

424
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:50,699
I think you’ll really like him.

425
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:54,992
Um, did you know those
have pork gelatin in them?

426
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,980
Pork Gelatin!

427
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:01,441
Sorry

428
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:03,844
They’re halal you bitch.

429
00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:07,499
I think, uh, Rabeya’s mad at me.

430
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:09,595
Are you okay?

431
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:11,413
Did I ever tell you I
grew up in a house full of women?

432
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:13,328
No, I don’t think so.

433
00:31:13,657 --> 00:31:14,763
Worked out.

434
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:17,861
Always works out.

435
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:20,021
Just give me one little kiss.

436
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:24,348
 Did you meet that girl Fatima?

437
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:26,365
Yes, I met Fatima.

438
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:28,842
It’s funny you should mention Fatima.

439
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:30,410
Why?

440
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:32,017
Because, um…

441
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:38,957
So, uh… we’re making out and whatever.
And uh… I go for her tits.

442
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:44,815
And that’s cool and she’s cool.
So I put my hands between her legs.

443
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:48,164
I mean, she’s liking it so
I go to unbutton her jeans.

444
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:52,806
And the next thing I know she’s putting her hand over
mine, and I’m thinking fuck, that’s it, it’s done.

445
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:55,518
And she just looks at me and you
know what she says?

446
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:58,348
Sorry if this is a dumb question

447
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:03,522
but if you were to, uh uh… and she couldn’t even get
the fucking words out man.

448
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:05,969
So I’m like, finger you?

449
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,807
And she goes, yeah.

450
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:09,934
Would that break the hyme n?

451
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,168
YUSEF Wow.

452
00:32:12,886 --> 00:32:15,335
C’mon what can you do after that, if I would have done
shit I would have felt like a fucking child molester

453
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:21,317
 Fuck. That’s my jihad man.

454
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:22,853
Jihad?

455
00:32:24,296 --> 00:32:26,546
The struggle between me and my nuts.

456
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:29,357
Greatest struggle, right?

457
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:31,267
Jihad against your nuts?

458
00:32:34,545 --> 00:32:36,175
Yusef.

459
00:32:36,226 --> 00:32:40,394
- Oh, hey. - Hi.

460
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:42,197
- Hi.
- How ya doing?

461
00:32:42,197 --> 00:32:43,967
- I’m good, how are you?
- Good.

462
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:45,247
Glad you could make it.

463
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,003
Oh, I live here.

464
00:32:47,707 --> 00:32:49,914
Oh.
Oh my God, that’s right.

465
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:54,531
Duh.
It’s a crazy house.

466
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:55,840
YUSEF Yeah, it’s crazy.

467
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:57,643
He’s drunk

468
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,380
 You should give me a tour.

469
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:06,646
That’s the kitchen.

470
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:10,130
Rabeya’s room is on the other side.

471
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:16,549
Upstairs bathroom and Fasiq’s
room is around the corner.

472
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,657
So Yusef, are you a punk too?

473
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,164
Me? No.
Not really.

474
00:33:21,852 --> 00:33:25,847
Well, maybe Straight edge.
Maybe, yeah.

475
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:27,986
So where’s your room?

476
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,155
- Wow Yusef.
- Yeah.

477
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,490
It’s not as cool
as everyone else’s.

478
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,513
- It’s very nice.
- Thank you.

479
00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:40,901
Is everybody else
as clean as you are?

480
00:33:41,806 --> 00:33:42,901
Umar’s pretty neat.

481
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:52,178
- Pakistan, right?
- Yep.

482
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,374
I know my flags.

483
00:33:58,185 --> 00:33:59,634
So have you ever been there?

484
00:33:59,894 --> 00:34:02,047
I spent a summer there when I was ten.

485
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:04,511
- Oh really? - Yeah.
- How was it?

486
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:07,028
It was a different planet.

487
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,322
I can imagine.

488
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:13,480
Yeah, sometimes, you know I don’t know where I feel more

489
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:00,163
 What the fuck?

490
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:04,072
Nothing.
- This isn’t your first time with a girl, is it?

491
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,567
No, I’ve been with many girls.

492
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:10,375
I think it is.
- Lots and lots and lots of girls. I’ve…

493
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:27,110
You know, I have a question for you. Where’s the romance in Islam?

494
00:35:27,362 --> 00:35:28,581
Romance?

495
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:30,770
Yeah, passion Yusef

496
00:35:31,453 --> 00:35:37,413
Passion. Well, uh, you get, uh…
you, you date after you’re married.

497
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:40,125
Yeah, it’s really hard to explain

498
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,149
But that’s the Islamic way?

499
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:45,319
Yes. I guess so.

500
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:48,579
That doesn’t make any sense to me.

501
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:52,604
Well, making out with random guys,drunk,
at a party doesn’t make sense to me.

502
00:35:55,046 --> 00:35:56,520
Yeah, I hear ya on that one.

503
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:03,807
What’s your major again?
- Engineering. - Okay, why?

504
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,483
What, because, I don’t know. What are you talking about?

505
00:36:07,483 --> 00:36:11,451
Is that something you are passionate about?
Or is it something your parents want you to do?

506
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,702
What are you talking about? Don’t assume you
know anything about me. ‘cause you don’t.

507
00:36:16,753 --> 00:36:22,277
God, bullshit Yusef! You have a penis, a dick
in those pants. I know that you do. - What?

508
00:36:22,328 --> 00:36:23,972
You do, you can’t hide it, Yusef!

509
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:24,975
You know what,
you’re messed up, okay?

510
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:26,520
I’m messed up?

511
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,114
Yeah you’re messed up.
you know, were you ever a Muslim at all?

512
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:57,814

00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:42,066
Yeah he is.

534
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,160

00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:46,628

537
00:38:54,555 --> 00:38:56,655

538
00:38:57,584 --> 00:39:06,449
Insh’Allah. Alright, now hit me one deep alright.
Same way I told you though.

539
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:07,929
Alright.

00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:10,005
Okay, ready? Go.

541
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:14,373
Sorry!

542
00:39:23,475 --> 00:39:26,975
Last night I had a dream I was ah
 … drinking with Johnny Cash.

543
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:29,204
Really?

544
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:33,759
Yeah. You ever listen to Johnny Cash?

545
00:39:34,726 --> 00:39:36,826
No. I don’t listen to country.

546
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:49,449
No, Johnny Cash isn’t country, man. Johnny Cash is bigger than country.
Johnny Cash is the fucking shit man. Johnny Cash rules the world!

547
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:53,106
Well, I didn’t know that.

548
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,592
You didn’t know man, now you know.

549
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:58,084
So what was the dream about?

550
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:03,232
We were in a bar, sitting on a pair
of stools, downing shots. Laughing.

551
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,005
And I just wished I could be him so
fucking bad, man.

552
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:13,001
I wanted to be Johnny
Cash more than anything.

553
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:18,343
He was just sitting there and he
was so fucking old and withered.

554
00:40:21,426 --> 00:40:24,914
See 10,000 years of pain and life in his face.

555
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:29,997
I was hurting on the inside
so bad man, so fucking bad.

556
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:32,736
I wanted to be him so fucking bad.

557
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:39,757
A fucking every man
beyond time and place.

558
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:41,382
That’s what he is.

559
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:49,095
I can’t be that guy, you know.

560
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:52,985
Just talks to everybody.

561
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:59,354
Too wrapped up in my mixmatching
of disenfranchised subcultures man.

562
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,799
Damn.

563
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:09,465
Yeah, I’m small.

564
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:13,407
Fucking small.

565
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:23,666
Fucking small.

566
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:33,936
I’m really gonna do it man.

567
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:35,303
Do what?

568
00:41:35,348 --> 00:41:37,088
Put on a show.

569
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,436
Yeah, a punk show,
a Muslim punk show.

570
00:41:43,488 --> 00:41:46,974
Call the taqwacore bands out west.
Find a date when they can all make it.

571
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:49,032
I think it can work.

572
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:50,433
Yeah, where?

573
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,074
Anywhere, man.

574
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,480
Who would come?

575
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:56,309
a ton of people would come

576
00:41:56,558 --> 00:42:01,930
come on, we got a ton of Muslims coming to
the house Friday afternoon for prayers.

577
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:02,669
Yeah.

578
00:42:02,669 --> 00:42:05,250
A lot of kufr punks coming
to the house Friday nights.

579
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:09,589
Get em all in one place, at the
same time, that’s a lot of heads.

580
00:42:11,682 --> 00:42:13,546
This shit’s gonna happen.

581
00:42:13,936 --> 00:42:15,056
Yeah.

582
00:43:37,902 --> 00:43:41,755
Give it up for Ms. Muzzy

583
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,908
Okay.
Proper introduction.

584
00:43:49,422 --> 00:43:52,663
Yusef, this is Muzzamil.
I told you about him a few weeks ago.

585
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:53,663
Hi, I’m Yusef.

586
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,580
Call me Ms. Muzzy

587
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:59,047
Yusef jaan, you won’t believe it man.

588
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:02,301
Muzzy’s telling us about the
taqwacore scene out in San Fran.

589
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:05,688
Well it’s only a few bands right now
but it’s a lot of good energy.

590
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,259
Yeah? So who are the biggest ones out there?

591
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:11,316
The Ghilman’s mainly.
- Holy shit, they fucking rock.

592
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:13,874
Uh huh.
- I’m trying to get them out to my show this winter.

593
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,182
Oh, that’d be fucking hot.

594
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,410
You know which was another good band to look out for?

595
00:44:18,675 --> 00:44:20,633
The Guantanamo Bay Packers.

596
00:44:20,706 --> 00:44:23,882
They’ve got really good songs so
try and get them out too, okay?

597
00:44:23,882 --> 00:44:25,154
Hey, Insha’Allah

598
00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:30,391
So Ms. Muzzy, tell me. Why the hell would anyone
leave San Francisco for this fucking shit hole?

599
00:44:31,229 --> 00:44:33,998
Well she could have gone
to Berkeley or something.

600
00:44:34,073 --> 00:44:37,041
Well it’s an interesting little
story behind that, ya see…

601
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,489
my parents believe
that…

602
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:43,980
if you could take me out of the gays…
then you could take the gay out of me.

603
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:48,407
So, they’re like
really funny like that.

604
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:59,022
Yusef y’akhi. So you coming with me tonight?

605
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:00,871
Yeah, yeah.

606
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,790
Where you guys going?

607
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:05,769
Rochester Mosque.

608
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:10,275
We aren’t invited?

609
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:13,582
I wanna pray. - Me too man.

610
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:15,901
Huh?

611
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:19,454
I can’t believe I’m taking
you freaks to the masjid.

612
00:45:19,454 --> 00:45:26,083
Whatever dude. At least the girls decided not to come.
Just don’t tell anybody Ms. Muzzy’s gay and we’ll be fine.

613
00:45:26,115 --> 00:45:28,491
Don’t do that around me, let’s go. Let’s go.

614
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:29,891
What the fuck?

615
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:32,111
No beer or weed at the mosque.

616
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:34,861
I wouldn’t smoke in the mosque.

617
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:37,202
No… Thank you.

618
00:45:40,555 --> 00:45:43,028
What’s up daddy, you wanna feel up inside
my pussy, see what’s inside of there?

619
00:45:43,028 --> 00:45:45,118
Shut up, honestly.
Not today.

620
00:45:48,711 --> 00:45:50,037
Take off the make up.

621
00:45:50,037 --> 00:45:53,823
No gay material. No fag porn in my car.
- Shut the fuck up.

622
00:45:55,168 --> 00:46:00,112
Sorry … I had to change my pants and
put my nice pants on. You okay?

623
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:31,510
I love masjids, man. No statues, no pictures.
Nothing’s imposed on you, nothing’s in your way.

624
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:37,506
You know … the only thing that made me
uncomfortable in masjids where the people.

625
00:46:38,344 --> 00:46:40,538
Without them here it’s not so bad.

626
00:46:43,393 --> 00:46:46,293
We should make two nafl rakas …

627
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:48,421
out of respect to the masjid

628
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:11,341
Come here.

629
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:12,829
What’s that?

630
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:18,188
My gift to the masjid. It’s a novel.
First ever punk novel.

631
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:19,588
Punk novel?

632
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:24,184
This kid, Gideon Sams.
He was 14 when he wrote it.

633
00:47:24,662 --> 00:47:30,066
Reading this book… it’s like listening to a sahaba.

634
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:36,081
Who knows who’ll find it, you know?
Maybe someone cool.

635
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,200
Did he write anything else?

636
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,304
Sheikh Sams? - Yeah.

637
00:47:44,943 --> 00:47:46,763
I don’t think so.

638
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:48,926
He died when he was twenty-six.

639
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:50,183
Twenty-six?

640
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,200
Twenty-six?

641
00:47:54,078 --> 00:47:57,018
The punk wasn’t meant to be anything
big ya know, it just kinda happened.

642
00:47:58,593 --> 00:48:02,892
Just kinda happened. Alayhe salaam.

643
00:48:18,072 --> 00:48:22,300
Y’akhi. It’s good to lay
with your head facing qiblah.

644
00:48:24,227 --> 00:48:26,327
Right. Right, right, right.

645
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:39,927
Whatcha got there Pakistan?

646
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,800
It’s a classified section where parents
look for suitable partners for their kids.

647
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:46,907
You’re kidding me, right?

648
00:48:47,932 --> 00:48:52,597
No. Get this one … Egyptian parents looking
correspondence for their daughter.

649
00:48:52,954 --> 00:48:57,553
Looking for Arab origin USA born, never
married and professional in medical field.

650
00:48:58,364 --> 00:49:00,464
Wow … these people are crazy.

651
00:49:01,107 --> 00:49:02,227
Yeah.

652
00:49:02,304 --> 00:49:05,104
Could you imagine if we responded to these posts?

653
00:49:06,883 --> 00:49:08,764
As-salammu alaikum, I;m Yusef

654
00:49:09,312 --> 00:49:13,564
Pakistani, Sunni origin. Engineering student and a good family.

655
00:49:15,454 --> 00:49:22,291
As-salammu alaikum. I’m Fasiq. No
degree but I’m in pharmaceuticals.

656
00:49:23,782 --> 00:49:31,011
As-salammu alaikum auntiee, I’m Jehangir.
I’m here to marry… um… What’s your daughter’s name again?

657
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:35,845
As-salammu alaikum. I’m Umar. Your ad is haram.

658
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:40,206
Marhaba, I’m Muzzy.  I’m here to sit on your son’s face.

659
00:49:41,774 --> 00:49:45,274
Okay. We are turning to the Suratal-Nur, the thirty-fifth ayat…

660
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:03,833
Fasiq, brother.  Please keep awake.

661
00:50:03,905 --> 00:50:05,305
Sorry Umar.

662
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:08,164
Mash’Allah.

663
00:50:09,294 --> 00:50:13,092
Allah Subhana wa Ta’Ala is the Light of the heavens and the earth.

664
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:19,822
Allah Subhana wa Ta’Ala … Light is like a lamp inside a niche.

665
00:50:28,951 --> 00:50:31,051
Let’s just pray Fajr and go home.

666
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,294
Jehangir … you sober?

667
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:40,569
Sober as you are man.

668
00:50:42,027 --> 00:50:43,847
You wanna lead?

669
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:46,413
Yeah.

670
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,840
Allahu Akbar.

671
00:51:03,588 --> 00:51:06,333
<i>Now, they say that your book is
pioneering a whole new Islam.</i>

672
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:10,207
<i>Surely you must be receiving all kinds
of death threats from angry Mohammadans.</i>

673
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:12,772
<i>Well it’s not easy being the
voice of my generation.</i>

674
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:15,633
<i>but I think that my struggle
is to reclaim true Islam</i>

675
00:51:15,633 --> 00:51:18,984
<i>from those who have taken it hostage,
or hijacked it if you will.</i>

676
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,965
<i>Those Muslim men. They just want
to lock you in the house, right?</i>

677
00:51:22,005 --> 00:51:23,496
<i>Absolutely!</i>

678
00:51:23,696 --> 00:51:28,099
<i>If they had their way, I’d be under one of those
hideous burlap sacks that they make their women wear.</i>

679
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:41,290
Hey. Yo. How are you?

680
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:42,979
I’m good.

681
00:51:43,069 --> 00:51:49,672
Listen, I brought you something.
Two Friday’s from now …

682
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,720
I’m gonna give a sermon, I want you there, okay?
- Of course.

683
00:51:53,795 --> 00:51:57,447
And… I want you to present this to Umar and
this is how you’re gonna get back in the house.

684
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:01,614
Read this later, alright? Whatever points
are in here, I want you to bring up.

685
00:52:01,814 --> 00:52:05,664
Alright? You’ll be back in the house
Everything will be good to go. Alright?

686
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,731
Dude, how the fuck is Umar gonna let me back
in the house, man?

687
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:10,179
 He acts like he owns that shit

688
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:14,120
 Fuck that man, fuck Umar.
He’s never gonna let me back in the house, man

689
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,638
No, no, no, no. Fuck Umar?
Okay, fuck you.

690
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,880
Me? Dude, I’m not a fuckin nazi
piece of shit like him, man. - Fuck you.

691
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,430
He called me a Shi’ite piece of
shit, he’s a fuckin Nazi dude. - Fuck you.

692
00:52:25,472 --> 00:52:29,620
He’s a fucking hypocrite. He’s got tattoos all over his
body, that’s haram like a motherfucker, dude. - Fuck you.

693
00:52:30,993 --> 00:52:31,777
Fuck you.

694
00:52:31,977 --> 00:52:35,027
What are you willing to give
up to be in that house?

695
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,888
Think about that man.

696
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:43,953
Read through that, I’ll see
ya in two weeks. okay?

697
00:52:52,513 --> 00:52:55,900
These dumb bitches. With all of this
airbrushing, like any of this is real.

698
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,700
How can that really be someone’s lips?

699
00:53:00,391 --> 00:53:04,211
It’s call collagen, sweetie. Some white chicks do that.
They ain’t got our nice ethnic lips.

700
00:53:05,465 --> 00:53:08,965
Whites just gotta put some pig
shit up in there. That pig fat.

701
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,514
So Yusef, Like, what do you like? Do you like the girls
with the big fat lips like down there or up here?

702
00:53:16,709 --> 00:53:18,171
What do you like to jerk off to sweetie?

703
00:53:20,388 --> 00:53:25,220
I think you touched a nerve!
Yusef, do you not jerk off?

704
00:53:25,851 --> 00:53:29,750
That’s not a nice question
to ask someone. - Oh no!

705
00:53:30,321 --> 00:53:31,261
You like girls, right?

706
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:32,405
Of course.

707
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:33,427
But you’re not doing anyone?

708
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:35,139
No, I’m not doing anyone.

709
00:53:35,139 --> 00:53:40,039
God Yusef! You’re the only sophomore at
this school who’s never touched his penis!

710
00:53:40,423 --> 00:53:42,081
 Yusef, you gotta take care of that.

711
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:45,272
I don’t like to self abuse and you
guys shouldn’t do that either.

712
00:53:45,272 --> 00:53:49,302
Sweetie, it’s not abuse.
It’s… fun.

713
00:53:49,389 --> 00:53:51,876
I’ll tell you what’s wrong with not masterbating Yusef.

714
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:55,834
If you keep that shit inside of you it will
poison you and make you do fucked up things.

715
00:53:55,834 --> 00:53:56,922
 Look at the catholic priests.

716
00:53:56,922 --> 00:54:02,909
Wait a second, wait a second!
Fatima here has been quiet.

717
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,760
Quiet as a mime!

718
00:54:08,394 --> 00:54:13,595
What, I don’t know anything… I think it’s
different for guys than it is for girls.

719
00:54:13,631 --> 00:54:17,471
Oh shut up! - Maybe, but what does that have to do
with being afraid to touch your own freaking anatomy?

720
00:54:18,036 --> 00:54:20,268
Sweetie, you know how it works?
I mean, you’ve look down there…

721
00:54:20,268 --> 00:54:22,368
Stop!
Geez, yeah, I know.

722
00:54:22,422 --> 00:54:24,379
You know you don’t have to like
stick anything in, right? - Yes!

723
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:27,681
Did you not learn anything in sex ed?

724
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:31,312
My mom took me out of school that week.
She did!

725
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:36,212
Of course she took her out! She’s like, oh no, my
daughter’s gonna see a penis. We can’t let that happen.

726
00:54:36,265 --> 00:54:40,127
Alright, we’re gonna have to reframe
and do a little va-ga-ga one-o-one.

727
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,227
Okay.
I should, I should go

728
00:54:42,422 --> 00:54:45,286
I’m gonna write a couple things on the
black-- Oh, we have a fugitive.

729
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:49,002
I should really go and work on my paper.
It’s due tomorrow.

730
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:52,502
No Yusef, stick around.
You could learn a thing or two from me.

731
00:54:52,628 --> 00:54:56,128
Rabeya, Rabeya. We’ve gotta clear out
the cobwebs first. So let him go.

732
00:54:57,935 --> 00:54:59,220
Thanks Ms. Muzzy.

733
00:54:59,317 --> 00:55:04,799
Wait. Hand me that.
You need this more than they do.

734
00:55:05,181 --> 00:55:06,581
God damn it!

735
00:55:06,582 --> 00:55:09,382
Vaginal lesson number one
is this is a tampon.

736
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,385
Oh, that’s a good one.
- Thank you.

737
00:55:10,385 --> 00:55:11,505
I don’t use those.

738
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:15,772
Tampons do not de-virgin-ize you, okay?

739
00:55:15,948 --> 00:55:20,458
 Even if the hymen is broken by a tampon it
doesn’t mean you’re not a virgin anymore.

740
00:55:21,156 --> 00:55:23,956
Say goodbye to the Maxipad!
Tampons’ coming in!

741
00:56:56,683 --> 00:56:57,559
Yusef?

742
00:56:57,559 --> 00:56:58,679
As-salammu alaikum.

743
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:01,284
On what days will you be
coming home this semester?

744
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,780
Abu I think I’m gonna stay in
Buffalo during the breaks.

745
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,084
Why Yusef?
What’s the reason to stay?

746
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,370
I just, I just wanna hang out here

747
00:57:08,404 --> 00:57:10,724
Hang out?
What does that mean, hang out?

748
00:57:10,724 --> 00:57:12,527
Abu, I gotta go.
I gotta catch a bus.

749
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:14,296
Yusef!
Yusef, don’t rush me!

750
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:15,736
Sorry, sorry, I gotta go!

751
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:18,749
Yusef! Astaghfur’Allah!

752
00:57:22,412 --> 00:57:24,232
Stop, stop, stop.

753
00:57:27,019 --> 00:57:28,839
Yusef! Let him go!

754
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:30,785
Let me talk to him, let me talk to him.

755
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:32,885
No, you talk from here.
Alright?

756
00:57:33,816 --> 00:57:35,590
My fucking sheets are still stained because of him.

757
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,616
My fucking sheets are still stained because of you! You know that!

758
00:57:37,616 --> 00:57:40,167
Fuck dude! How many fucking times
do I have to say I’m fucking sorry!

759
00:57:40,695 --> 00:57:44,195
Free themselves from the unrightful
prejudice toward specific sects.

760
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:46,253
I don’t give a fuck about that!

761
00:57:46,253 --> 00:57:49,753
Dude, this is the official fatwa
of Shaykh Mahmud Shaltut!

762
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:52,010
What the fuck are you talking about?!

763
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,347
Umar! Listen to me!
Umar! Listen to me!

764
00:57:54,347 --> 00:57:55,747
Calm down.

765
00:57:56,114 --> 00:57:58,065
You really gonna deny a brother Friday prayer?

766
00:57:59,878 --> 00:58:03,378
You want to answer to Allah for that?
Fucking think about it.

767
00:58:07,135 --> 00:58:09,229
Fuck!

768
00:58:09,843 --> 00:58:10,633
Whatever.

769
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,242
Put a fucking shirt on this guy!

770
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:18,042
Okay. We’ll get a shirt.
We’ll get you a shirt.

771
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,952
Dude, it’s so fucking good to be back man!

772
00:58:45,952 --> 00:58:47,072
Khutba.

773
00:58:56,296 --> 00:58:57,962
Islam is a fucking surrender.

774
00:58:59,614 --> 00:59:00,917
That’s it.

775
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:05,632
Knowing that you don’t run the show, staying
mindful of it in everything you do.

776
00:59:07,521 --> 00:59:10,176
Take your hands off the wheel. See how it feels.

777
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:17,268
Islam isn’t about ayats and hadiths, and niches, and lamps.

778
00:59:18,047 --> 00:59:21,212
 It’s about us. All of us.

779
00:59:23,884 --> 00:59:29,580
Allah’s too big and too open for
my Islam to be small and closed

780
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:36,181
I’m so Muslim … I am so Muslim.

781
00:59:36,438 --> 00:59:38,885
I can say fuck Islam.

782
00:59:40,627 --> 00:59:42,290
You know Imam Husain said…

783
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:49,684
"He has no religion, let him at
least be free in his present life."

784
00:59:58,159 --> 00:59:59,559
Let’s pray.

785
01:00:19,546 --> 01:00:20,946
Jehangir.

786
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:26,382
That was a beautiful khutbah today.
Amazing, I’ve never heard anything like it man.

787
01:00:27,662 --> 01:00:28,388
Yeah?

788
01:00:34,853 --> 01:00:38,353
Bombs away baby!

789
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:42,459
I’m putting on a fucking show baby!
- yeah

790
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:43,839
God damn right.

791
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,548
Been callin all my boys out West, their
coming in a big fucking taqwacore caravan.

792
01:00:48,548 --> 01:00:52,048
We’re gonna set it off.
Set it off real fucking nice. - When?

793
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:53,933
December twenty-first.
- Where?

794
01:00:54,007 --> 01:00:57,093
Right here, baby.
Insha’Allah

795
01:01:07,048 --> 01:01:14,841
I can’t believe you got the Ghilmans to come out.
And Al-Thawra. Like, it’s getting serious.

796
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:19,080
Yes, yes, yes, this place is gonna get over run
with fucking taqwacore and it’s gonna be so good

797
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,480
I'm really excited

798
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:22,516
What about, what about,
what’s her face?

799
01:01:22,516 --> 01:01:27,261
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dee Dee Ali and the guys are in.

800
01:01:27,277 --> 01:01:29,097
Osama’s Tunnel Diggers!

801
01:01:29,161 --> 01:01:32,824
They’re in there.
We just threw them in there for you.

802
01:01:32,852 --> 01:01:34,575
 Another band wants to make it out.

803
01:01:34,575 --> 01:01:35,319
That’s cool.

804
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:37,139
Yeah.
- Which one?

805
01:01:37,344 --> 01:01:39,164
Bilal’s Boulder.

806
01:01:41,922 --> 01:01:45,422
No fucking way Jehangir.
Those guys are bad news.

807
01:01:45,907 --> 01:01:50,540
Yeah, I mean, they kind of are,
but… They’re good at what they do

808
01:01:50,859 --> 01:01:54,359
Bilal’s Boulder? They don’t
even allow girls at their show.

809
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:57,721
Look, I know. But their taqwacore.

810
01:01:58,371 --> 01:02:00,214
They’re gonna piss the
other bands off.

811
01:02:00,214 --> 01:02:05,114
Yeah, and we’re telling them it’s an all gender show right off the bat.
If they don’t like it, they don’t have to come.

812
01:02:05,124 --> 01:02:07,478
Jehangir, they’re a bunch of cocks!

813
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:08,360
Muzzamil jaan.

814
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:14,151
 If we deny a band their spot because we don’t
like their attitude or their interpretations.

815
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:18,351
 Then really it makes us no different
than those who’ve excluded us.

816
01:02:21,919 --> 01:02:25,205
Alright?
- Alright. Bilal’s Boulder, cool.

817
01:02:36,504 --> 01:02:39,304
So, how many people are
gonna to be staying here?

818
01:02:39,493 --> 01:02:42,253
I don’t know, I mean…

819
01:02:42,253 --> 01:02:46,674
with the bands and all of the scenesters making it
out …

820
01:02:46,694 --> 01:02:49,253
a lot of people brother, a lot of people.

821
01:02:49,253 --> 01:02:51,079
Where they all gonna sleep?

822
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:54,288
In the halls, in the basement.
In your bedroom.

823
01:02:54,288 --> 01:02:56,260
Listen, some of these
taqwacores are girls.

824
01:02:56,669 --> 01:02:57,789
Yeah.

825
01:02:57,792 --> 01:02:59,265
You got any liwaticore
bands coming out?

826
01:02:59,265 --> 01:03:00,665
Yeah, we do.

827
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,010
You got them all sleeping together?
Guys, girls, and liwats?

828
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:07,694
Piece of shit, I’m trying to
have a fucking conversation.

829
01:03:08,636 --> 01:03:09,830
Hold this.

830
01:03:11,785 --> 01:03:16,685
Fucking relax, relax. look at me.

831
01:03:17,024 --> 01:03:19,284
I knew the guy and girl
thing was gonna bug you

832
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,196
So I invited the liwats so they could turn all the guys gay.

833
01:03:23,196 --> 01:03:25,945
That way you don’t have anything to worry about.

834
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:27,694
Okay?
Insha’Allah, it’s gonna be fine.

835
01:03:27,694 --> 01:03:31,555
Fucking funny to you isn’t!?
This is fucking funny? It's a fucking joke

836
01:03:31,588 --> 01:03:32,688
Relax, relax.

837
01:03:32,688 --> 01:03:36,002
Listen, listen… you need to fucking listen to me, okay?
You need to be fucking careful.

838
01:03:36,002 --> 01:03:36,805
Hug me.

839
01:03:36,805 --> 01:03:39,590
Anything goes wrong with this
shit and it’s on you this time.

840
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:42,275
I’m not cleaning up your fucking mess.
Get the fuck off me.

841
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:43,256
Give me a hug.
- Piece of shit.

842
01:03:43,256 --> 01:03:44,544
Wait come back, give me a hug.

843
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:48,161
Muzzamil doesn’t want you to leave.
Do you want him to leave?

844
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:49,957
Yeah, he can go fuck himself.

845
01:03:50,388 --> 01:03:52,208
He said he loves you!

846
01:04:01,494 --> 01:04:05,737
Umar. Umar. Are you okay?

847
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:07,815
Everything’s fine.

848
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:09,665
You don’t seem okay.

849
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,126
Is that why you’re here?

850
01:04:16,692 --> 01:04:18,792
 I wanted to ask you something.

851
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,214
Shoot away.

852
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:26,531
Why can’t we all be in the same
room together and get along?

853
01:04:28,422 --> 01:04:30,239
Have you seen the fucking
parties in my hallway?

854
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:33,408
Have you seen the walls in this house?

855
01:04:33,408 --> 01:04:35,918
The people that come into this house.

856
01:04:35,918 --> 01:04:38,718
We have that fucking liwat
hanging out upstairs.

857
01:04:39,862 --> 01:04:41,031
That’s not his name.

858
01:04:41,031 --> 01:04:42,851
Fuck his name.

859
01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:48,826
I just … I just think it’s
really disrespectful.

860
01:04:48,826 --> 01:04:52,326
The way you are to people.

861
01:04:54,566 --> 01:04:56,666
 That’s all I had to say.

862
01:05:01,005 --> 01:05:03,331
What?
Is that Jehangir talking?

863
01:05:03,836 --> 01:05:04,886
Huh?

864
01:05:04,886 --> 01:05:08,170
 It’s not you, Yusef.

865
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,853
It’s not you talking man.

866
01:05:17,324 --> 01:05:18,444
fuck.

867
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:27,752
<i>So Imam, what you’re saying is that the Republican Party
should be doing more outreach to American Muslims?</i>

868
01:05:27,752 --> 01:05:31,273
<i>Yes yes yes, Because Muslims and
Christians share the same values.</i>

869
01:05:31,273 --> 01:05:34,829
<i> We are bother opposed to some of these
crazy social trends that you see today.</i>

870
01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:37,537
<i>These crazy social trends
like what, gay marriage?</i>

871
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:43,233
<i>Absolutely. Christians and Muslims should stand united
against the homosexual agenda invading our country.</i>

872
01:05:43,233 --> 01:05:48,133
<i>Wow, Imam, I gotta tell you. I’m really touched here.
I feel like we’ve built some bridges tonight.</i>

873
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,000
Yusef.

874
01:05:56,763 --> 01:05:57,883
Yeah

875
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,107
Come out here a second.

876
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:01,807
Okay

877
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:13,663
So, what’s up?

878
01:06:15,732 --> 01:06:20,064
One of the bands called up Jehangir from
a gas station. Like an hour ago.

879
01:06:20,629 --> 01:06:21,749
Yeah

880
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:25,701
They’ll be coming
any minute now.

881
01:06:26,091 --> 01:06:27,141
I can’t wait.

882
01:06:29,707 --> 01:06:30,975
Is that all?

883
01:06:31,004 --> 01:06:34,966
No.
I think I figured it out.

884
01:06:35,566 --> 01:06:37,386
Figured what out?

885
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:40,277
Why Rabeya wears a burqa.

886
01:06:40,659 --> 01:06:41,779
Why?

887
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:46,950
For the same reason I got this.

888
01:07:06,477 --> 01:07:07,597
 Shit.

889
01:07:09,815 --> 01:07:12,615
Dee Dee Ali!
The queen of taqwacore!

890
01:07:13,206 --> 01:07:14,326
Hey!

891
01:07:17,229 --> 01:07:22,508
What’s up mama?! Fuck, you look great!
Look at that? Is that Secret Trial Five?

892
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:26,774
We made these on the bus when we were on tour together.
- That’s beautiful. Let me grab that from you.

893
01:07:26,774 --> 01:07:28,998
Will you grab that? What the hell
you got your pants down for, man?

894
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,731
I was on the shit-er. - I knew it.
What the shit is this?

895
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:32,193
What?

896
01:07:32,193 --> 01:07:34,456
What’s this? It’s fucking nuts.
It’s fucking freezing out here.

897
01:07:34,456 --> 01:07:37,909
Come on we’re Buffalo baby!
Coldest fucking Muslim’s on the planet.

898
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:39,478
Well then you better get me inside and warm me up.
- Want me to warm you up?

899
01:07:39,478 --> 01:07:43,088
Tonight we party.
Tomorrow’s the show. bring it!

900
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:05,781
Look at these guys!

901
01:08:05,905 --> 01:08:07,568
Pretty punk rock, huh?

902
01:08:07,568 --> 01:08:09,388
The star of David?

903
01:08:09,429 --> 01:08:11,055
Yeah man, it’s like…

904
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:14,050
It’s like Sid Vicious wearing the swastika.

905
01:08:14,143 --> 01:08:16,601
You know, punk’s all about
pissing people  up and the…

906
01:08:16,758 --> 01:08:20,958
Taqwacore is punk rock for Muslims, so
this is punk up the fucking ass, man!

907
01:08:23,863 --> 01:08:26,632
But what’s the point?
I mean, you’re just offending people.

908
01:08:26,632 --> 01:08:29,432
You’re just getting
everyone riled up.

909
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,686
What do you mean? - I mean...
- Huh?

910
01:08:33,377 --> 01:08:34,979
As-salaamu alaikum!

911
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:35,912
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

912
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,732
Kahif alaikum y'akhi!

913
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,136
Good, good.

914
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:40,628
How you doing?

915
01:08:40,628 --> 01:08:41,407
Good.

916
01:08:41,407 --> 01:08:45,482
Man, I’m the fucking proof of everything
this fucking shit says, the whole shit.

917
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,007
The Qur’an tells you not to drink, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

918
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:51,525
Don’t fucking drink.
I went ahead and I fucked that all up.

919
01:08:51,581 --> 01:08:57,216
I fucked my whole life up. By fucking fingerin little
school girl’s twats and then fucking puking in their hair.

920
01:08:57,487 --> 01:09:00,213
That’s the kinda shit that I do.
That’s my life.

921
01:09:01,703 --> 01:09:04,612
Qur’an tells you to keep your dick
dry til you’re married, right?

922
01:09:04,612 --> 01:09:06,247
You keeping your dick dry?

923
01:09:06,247 --> 01:09:06,797
Yes.

924
01:09:06,797 --> 01:09:08,982
You know how many haram cunts I’ve had?

925
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:10,870
Now I got green shit coming out of my dick…

926
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:13,595
and I’ve got cauliflowers
coming out my asshole.

927
01:09:13,595 --> 01:09:16,200
You want cauliflowers
growing out your asshole?!

928
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,155
No.

929
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:19,370
So read your fucking Qur’an!
Get it right in there!

930
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:23,190
Get your fucking Qur’an right in there!
Right in here! And live it out!

931
01:09:23,324 --> 01:09:25,579
And don’t forget!
Or else you’re gonna end up just like me.

932
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:29,793
Go fucking back to medical school,
be a fucking good Muslim doctor.

933
01:09:35,578 --> 01:09:39,078
Hey! As’salaamu alaikum, man.
Guys it’s fucking Bilal’s Boulder.

934
01:09:39,337 --> 01:09:40,483
What’s going on brother?

935
01:09:40,895 --> 01:09:42,295
Wa alaikum.

936
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:43,878
What’s going on?

937
01:09:43,996 --> 01:09:47,496
Brother we just came to say salaams.
We’re sleeping in the van.

938
01:09:48,386 --> 01:09:50,402
No brother, we’ve got plenty of room here.

939
01:09:50,402 --> 01:09:54,396
I mean, not plenty of room but you know, we
got a big ass house, what’s four more guys?

940
01:09:54,396 --> 01:09:58,770
Brother, al’hamdulilah. Thank you so
much but we are sleeping in the van.

941
01:10:02,044 --> 01:10:05,353
Y’akhi it’s fucking freezing outside. Come on now.

942
01:10:05,353 --> 01:10:07,453
You guys don’t know how Buffalo
- We are okay.

943
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:12,442
Al-hamdulilah.

944
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:18,355
Never seen such scary dudes
with such soft voices.

945
01:10:18,355 --> 01:10:21,309
Yeah, they’re a different bunch.

946
01:10:21,309 --> 01:10:22,512
They’re a bunch of cocks, Jehangir!

947
01:10:22,512 --> 01:10:24,116
They’re decent guys.

948
01:10:25,313 --> 01:10:28,463
They’re just a little rough to
deal with sometimes. Alright?

949
01:10:28,463 --> 01:10:32,663
They’re hate mongers. If they had the chance
they would have thrown me from a minaret.

950
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:34,117
Yeah Muzzamil.

951
01:10:34,687 --> 01:10:35,717
They hate you.

952
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,440
 They hate me too.

953
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:40,385
They hate all of us for something.

954
01:10:41,376 --> 01:10:42,719
Look at us.

955
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,901
We’re the ones that have always been
excluded, afraid to be ourselves.

956
01:10:45,963 --> 01:10:50,991
And now what? We get our own scene and start pushing
people to the sidelines? Does that make sense?

957
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:53,784
Fuck that.

958
01:10:53,784 --> 01:10:55,632
Fuck being as small as they are.

959
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:56,806
Be big.

960
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:59,690
Be bigger than them.

961
01:11:00,932 --> 01:11:03,854
Hey yo, brother.
What’s up man?

962
01:11:04,829 --> 01:11:06,649
Hey, watch it!

963
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:08,834
Man, hey. What’s going on?

964
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,660
I’m going to be
with our guests.

965
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,664
Did I ever tell you about
the band I had out West?

966
01:12:12,664 --> 01:12:14,484
No.

967
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,544
 You had a band?

968
01:12:16,544 --> 01:12:17,602
Yeah.

969
01:12:19,053 --> 01:12:20,660
 We called ourselves…

970
01:12:21,302 --> 01:12:25,480
"Hi, my name is Allah"

971
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:29,701
It’s the most blasphemous
thing we could think of.

972
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:34,888
Though our intentions were pure, we came
off as pretty fucking disrespectful, man.

973
01:12:36,202 --> 01:12:38,302
What happened to the band?

974
01:12:40,692 --> 01:12:45,592
I couldn’t do it anymore, man.

975
01:12:46,344 --> 01:12:50,914
Whenever I sang I used to get these…

976
01:12:50,914 --> 01:12:53,045
Awful fucking stomach aches, man.

977
01:12:53,894 --> 01:12:58,794
Like a mess of fucking
scissors jumbled up inside me.

978
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,940
My own body was
disagreeing with me.

979
01:13:06,978 --> 01:13:08,378
Are you okay?

980
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:15,295
Fuck, Yusef.

981
01:13:21,236 --> 01:13:26,136
There’s all these ayats and hadiths against
about making divisions in your religion.

982
01:13:26,586 --> 01:13:29,545
And there’s gonna be seventy-two sects
of Islam at the end of the world, right?

983
01:13:30,576 --> 01:13:32,279
But only one can be right.

984
01:13:35,086 --> 01:13:37,136
What if we’re another one
of those wrong sects?

985
01:13:37,136 --> 01:13:38,956
No, this is not a sect.

986
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,486
Yeah, that’s why I invited Bilal’s Boulder.

987
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:46,884
Yeah, they’re cocks y’akhi, they’re fucking cocks.
We all know their cocks.

988
01:13:47,432 --> 01:13:49,857
This isn’t a sect if we keep it open, man.

989
01:13:52,575 --> 01:13:54,339
If we don't form
the farqa…

990
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:57,807
Groups.

991
01:14:10,349 --> 01:14:11,699
Please Allah.

992
01:14:15,691 --> 01:14:18,117
I know you have no reason to listen to me.

993
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,800
Because I’m shit.

994
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:28,529
Please...

995
01:14:30,603 --> 01:14:32,423
 Don’t make this a sect.

996
01:17:42,973 --> 01:17:44,793
As-salaamu alaikum

997
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:47,561
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

998
01:17:47,856 --> 01:17:54,247
I’m Harun. I write Ordinance twenty.
Ordinance twenty, the taqwacore zine.

999
01:17:59,983 --> 01:18:02,783
So it really happened like that, huh?

1000
01:18:03,113 --> 01:18:04,233
Yeah.

1001
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,441
That makes him like a martyr, right?

1002
01:18:11,864 --> 01:18:16,577
I mean, I don’t know ..
If I’d put it like that way, exactly.

1003
01:18:18,649 --> 01:18:24,265
Fair enough… what about his stuff?
Is any of it still here? - No. - What happened?

1004
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:26,085
It all got thrown out.

1005
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:34,606
Alright … what was he really like? I mean, you know did
he pray five times a day? What…what, what did he do?

1006
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:39,499
You know what?
Can we please, just let him rest?

1007
01:18:42,372 --> 01:18:45,801
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
