00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:19,690
(gentle upbeat music)

3
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,650

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,410
- [Dispatcher] That's right.

9
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,263
- I'm on my way.

10
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,973

12
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:05,517
(child crying)

13
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:09,295
- Lucky he's okay.

14
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,712
It's okay, really, it's okay.

15
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:19,143
Look what he did to me.

16
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:21,051
- Mrs. Mullins, calm down,
you need to calm down.

17
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:21,884
- I want him out of here.

18
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:22,717
- We're gonna press charges this time?

19
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:23,550
- [Mrs. Mullins] This time I will.

20
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,383
- Okay, all right.

21
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:25,216
What I need you to do is wait to do-

22
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:26,247
- He's gone crazy.

23
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,128
- Is wait over by the side of the road.

24
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:29,124
- He's drunk, he was
breakin' up the whole house.

25
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:30,823
Please help me, please
make sure you get him,

26
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:32,073
please get him.

00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,084
we're gonna need an ambulance out here

29
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:38,485
at 3450 Lola Vista Avenue.

31
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,520
(suspenseful music)

32
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,390
- [Toni] Mr. Mullins?

33
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,750
Mr. Mullins, this is
the police, come on out.

34
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:55,780
- Stroud's goin' in now, do you copy?

35
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,330

- 10-4 dispatch.

37
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,995
- [Dispatcher] Copy that, Heller.

38
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,679
- Stay clear of the house, all right?

39
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:54,512
(suspenseful music continues)

40
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:05,591
(wood thumps)

41
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,123
- Mr. Mullins, step out slowly
with your hands in the air.

42
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,923
Mr. Mullins!

43
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:35,237
Freeze!

44
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:36,070
Freeze!

45
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,993
Drop the pipe, drop the pipe!

46
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:39,791
(pipe clatters)

47
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,810
Hands behind your head,
hands behind your head!

48
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,120
All right, up against the wall.

49
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,583
Up against the wall, feet apart.

50
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,593
Give me those hands.

51
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,860
- Oh, we havin' fun yet, huh?

52
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,764
- Nice backup, Heller.

53
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:00,672
- You want him to give you some trouble?

54
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:02,018
(Mr. Mullins screams)

55
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,320
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

56
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,170
- Would you relax, I know this
guy, he likes to hit people.

57
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,475
You mother-

58
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:08,990
- You hit him again, Heller,
and it goes in my report.

59
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,107
- Yeah?

60
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:12,970
You do that and you'll never
see backup again from anybody.

61
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,960
- Get your hands off of him.

62
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,170
Get your hands off of him!

63
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,999
- Fine, fine, it's your call.

64
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:18,832
- Come on, Mr. Mullins.

65
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,023
- Listen, do you want
me to run him in for ya?

66
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,230
- Hi, smile.

67
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,096
Hey, bright eyes, how'd your shift go?

68
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:43,421
- Hey, long.

69
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:44,610
It must of been a full moon last night,

70
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,460
seemed like all the wacko's were out.

71
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,840
- Hopefully they'll
get back in their cages

72
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,730
before I have to get out there
and make our streets safe

73
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,083
against parking violators.

74
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,020
- I gotta get this stuff
in and get outta here.

75
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,288
I'll see ya at breakfast?

76
00:06:57,288 --> 00:06:58,121
- Oh yeah.

77
00:06:58,121 --> 00:06:59,550
- Okay, see ya later.

78
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,430
- Chili omelet?

79
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,407
- Extra onions.

80
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:04,913
Hey, get decent, I'm comin' through.

81
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:09,110
You know, you think they'd
spend some extra money

82
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,960
for another locker room

83
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,270
so I wouldn't have to go
through this everyday.

84
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,720
- And miss the beef cake?

85
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,203
- You don't hold a candle
to my boyfriend, Charlie.

86
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:18,657
- I don't know about that.

87
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,823
- Two days wear, (sniffs) five days wear.

88
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,107
Oh man, last years softball play-offs!

89
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:28,063
- Oh, you're a sick man, Weisberg.

90
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,113
- Here, burn 'em with
you're done with 'em.

91
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:32,977
- Thanks, Charlie.

92
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:35,069
How do you get 'em like that?

93
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:36,190
- Did you guys see the set on that blond

94
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,080
that Hank was with the other
night at the bowling alley?

95
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,940
- Oh man, she must have been a lot of fun

96
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,880
in the shower, huh?

97
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,350
- Well, you know what they say,

98
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,548
the bigger the breasts,
the dumber the guy.

99
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,430
(men laugh)

100
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,645
- Stroud?

101
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:50,530
- Huh?

102
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,493
- Lieutenant Feuer wants
to see you in his office.

103
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,383
- Uh-oh!

104
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:55,280
It's all over now.

105
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,927
- Another one bites the dust.

106
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,003
Can I have your locker? (laughs)

107
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,470
- Sir?

108
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,370
- Come in, Stroud.

109
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,743
I've marked you meet standards
in all but three categories.

110
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,980
In those; amount of work
performed, coordinating with others

111
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,280
and helpful to fellow employees,

112
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,980
I have rated you exceed standards.

113
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,610
- Thank you, sir.

114
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,280
- Well, Stroud, two more months,

115
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,200
it's coming down to the wire,

116
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,560
this will be your last evaluation.

117
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,199
- I thought I had one
more at the end of review?

118
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:42,870
- I think we can skip it,
unless, of course, you object?

119
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,340
- Oh, no sir, I don't object at all.

120
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,173
- When the time comes,

121
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:49,110
I'll just attach this
eval to my recommendation.

122
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,733
Here, read and sign.

123
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,163
- Thank you so much Lieutenant Feuer.

124
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,190
- By the way, Heller told me how well

125
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,540
you handled the Mullins
situation, keep up the good work.

126
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,390
- Thank you, sir.

127
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,170
- Toni, I hear you might interested

128
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,940
in an administrative service
position when the time comes.

129
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,210
- Yeah, definitely.

130
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,410
- Stop by my office some time,

131
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,840
I'll fill you in on the requirements.

132
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,153
- Well thank you, Captain
Daley, I appreciate that.

133
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,380
- No really, you look fabulous today,

134
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,653
I don't know what it is.

135
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:43,270
- What do you want?

136
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,323
- [Weisberg] Hey, Toni!

137
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,350
What was up with Feuer?

138
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,190
- Evaluation update,
straight A's as usual.

139
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,765
- All right!

140
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:52,947
I told you she was a keeper!
- That's crazy, mazel tov!

141
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:53,780
- Well done.

142
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,875
- A toast, huh?

143
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,070
To officer Stroud, the best.

144
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,480
- To women in uniform.

145
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,930
- Yeah why not, hey, why not.

146
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:02,590
- Got anything for me?

147
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,423
- Stop.

148
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,370
- [Charlie] Another bloody
Mary, keep 'em comin' will ya?

149
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,660
- Oh, gee Charlie, if you
paid a tab or left a tip,

150
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,673
the service might be more to your liking.

151
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,410
What're you tryin' for, a personal best?

152
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,730
It's not even nine a.m.

153
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,946
- She loves me, she loves me.

154
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:20,442
- You're a prize.

155
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:21,294
Oh god!

How was your day?

160
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,010
- I survived.

161
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,280
How was yours?

162
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,900
- My day went very well,
I got a great evaluation.

163
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,282
- Well, congratulations.

164
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:38,809
- Thank you.

165
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,720

166
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,553

168
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:43,296
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:44,129
- You don't smell too bad yourself.

170
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:46,730
- Well, I may be available after dinner.

171
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,127
- Yeah?

172
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:50,066
I'll make sure I keep it open.

173
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,566
(both giggle)

174
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:58,241
I got a little present for ya.

175
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,517

00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,530
- Well, you know I got my sources.

179
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,500
You're welcome.

180
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,690
- Thank you so much.

181
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,356
Do you wanna grab the salad?

182
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:08,734
- Got it.

183
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:09,990
You want a drumstick and a wing?

184
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,140
- Oh yeah, that's good.

185
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:14,103
- Anything come in the mail?

186
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,523
- No.

187
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:20,260
- It's all right.

188
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,896
- Oh honey, it's early,
you still have time.

189
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:25,527
- I dunno, I just, I'm startin' to feel

190
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:27,690
like I'm gonna be a high school
teacher the rest of my life.

191
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,680
- College, high school,
what's the difference?

192
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,730
It's the same smart ass kids, only older.

193
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,563
- You know, Toni,

194
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,953
I really wish you'd take
this a little more seriously.

195
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,360
- Dean, I was kidding.

196
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,570
- I mean, you really take bein'
a cop seriously, don't you?

197
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,720
- Let's not have this
argument again, okay?

198
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,930
Let's just enjoy the evening, all right?

199
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,748
- Yeah, okay.

200
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:53,581
- Okay.

201
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:54,538
- Here, give your plate.

202
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:55,371
- Thanks.

203
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:06,180
How you doin'?

204
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,013
Hey, Charlie.

205
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:14,593
(car tires squeal)

206
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,220
Hey, what's up with Charlie?

207
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,707
Is he in some kind of
trouble or somethin'?

208
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,583
Well?

209
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,690
- His wife called the
department about his drinking.

210
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,523
- Ouch.

211
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,205
- [Weisberg] Ouch is right,
it was a lousy thing to do.

212
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:40,533
- What's gonna happen to him?

213
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,910
- I dunno, probably make
him go get counseling.

214
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,430
You know Charlie, he's gonna love that!

215
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,930
- Yeah well he has been
hittin' it pretty hard lately.

216
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,430
- Yeah, well, that's none of our business.

217
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,150
- Yes it is.

218
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,860
We count on him for backup in the field,

219
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,040
if he's got a problem, we should help him.

220
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,590
- Charlie's a big boy, he
can take care of himself.

221
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,200
That's not the point anyway,

222
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,700
his wife shouldn't of
reported him to the brass,

223
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,750
they should've worked it out in private.

224
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,650
- Maybe she tried.

225
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:07,523
- I don't care if she tried,
what she did was wrong.

226
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,160
Look, Toni, people are
always trying to take us down

227
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,710
and havin' your wife rat on ya,

228
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,300
it's about as low as it gets.

229
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,887
I mean, I'd never rat
on your about anything,

230
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:19,420
I know you wouldn't rat on me, right?

231
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,253
That's the code.

232
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,530
It shouldn't happen, she knows better.

233
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,656
- [Toni] Ah, I almost burnt my finger.

234
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:35,511
- Oh, here, use this,
don't get that in the car.

235
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:36,344
- Hey, does anyone wanna
go to the football game

236
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:37,177
this weekend?

237
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:39,300
Dean and I have a couple extra tickets.

238
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,150
- I wouldn't pay to watch those bums.

239
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,725
- I'll go if that blond
from the bowling alley

240
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:44,720
will come with me.

241
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,450
- Oh come on Charlie, it's not that bad,

242
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,200
your wife's just worried about you.

243
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:50,680
- She's got a hell of a way of showin' it.

244
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,790
- She'll get over it, man.

245
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,490
- Yeah, why don't you
send her some flowers?

246
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,240
- Yeah, maybe I'll send her wreath.

247
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,730
- How 'bout one of those sexy teddies?

248
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,700
Woman love that crap, right Ton?

249
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,053
- No, men love that crap.

250
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:08,669
(children laughing)

251
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:27,526
- [Child] Amanda, you're doing good!

252
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:38,316
(doorbell rings)

253
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,138
- [Charlie] Toni.

254
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:47,838
- Charlie, what're you doing here?

255
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,380
- Well I hate to do this to
ya but I need a little favor,

256
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,910
I was wondering if many I could crash here

257
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,310
for a couple hours?

258
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,610
- Why, what's the problem?

259
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:01,517
- Pam threw me out.

260
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:04,072
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

261
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:05,554
- Well, I'm not.

262
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:06,452
Maybe after tonight's shift,

263
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:09,183
I think I'm gonna start
lookin' for my own place.

264
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:12,150
- Well, come on in.

265
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,265
- Yeah?

266
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:14,098
That's all right?

267
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:14,931
- Yeah, come on.

268
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,730
I hope the couch is okay.

269
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,387
- Oh, that's great, that's great.

270
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:23,220
Go on, go back to sleep.

271
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,670
- Here's a blanket.

272
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,050
- Where's Dean?

273
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,343
- Oh, he teaches today.

274
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,410
- I really appreciate this, Toni.

275
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,245
- Yeah, no problem.

276
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:37,245
Here you go.

277
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,066
Sleep well.

278
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:51,427
(solemn music)

279
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:18,704
(suspenseful music)

280
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:18,109
Charlie!

281
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,652
Charlie, what're you doing?

282
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:20,500
- It's okay.

283
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,333
- Charlie!

284
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,166
- Just relax.

285
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,160
- Charlie!

286
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,993
Get off!

287
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:27,257
No, no!

288
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:29,537
Ow!

289
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:33,143
Please, please don't do this.

290
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,098
Stop!

291
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,813
Charlie, don't!

292
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:38,646
Get off!

293
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:40,668
Get off!

294
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:43,668
(children laughing)

295
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:55,867
(solemn music)

296
00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:01,565
(Toni sobbing)

297
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,380
(phone rings)

298
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:24,621
Hello?

299
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:25,581
- [Dean] Hey, it's me.

300
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:26,994
Guess what, I got great news.

301
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:31,163
Georgia offered me the
professorship, I start in the fall.

302
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:31,996
Hello?

303
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:33,037
Toni, hello?

304
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:33,870
Did you hear me?

305
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,247
- I can't talk right now, Dean.

306
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:52,395
(Toni sobbing)

307
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,310
- "I can't talk right
now, Dean, I'm sorry?"

308
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,187
- Please, Dean, not now.

309
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:14,020
- "Not now?"

310
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,820
What the hell's the matter with you?

311
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,340
I called you with the best news of my life

312
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,473
and you hung up on me.

313
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,080
I think you're supposed to
be happy for me here, Toni!

314
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,380
Jeez, I don't understand you.

315
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,260
You know, if this is about us moving,

316
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,390
you knew all along it
was a possibility, Toni.

317
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,290
If this is about your job,

318
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,600
which of course we know is
much more important than mine,

319
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,130
well, I got news for ya, news flash!

320
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,630
They have cops in Georgia too.

321
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:44,803
Toni?

322
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:55,340
(solemn music)

323
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:03,975
(woman laughing)

324
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:14,550
- Somebody's watching.

325
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,380
- Be right back.

326
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,083
Hey, Toni.

327
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:35,103
So what're you doing here?

328
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,593
Listen, do me a favor, will ya?

329
00:21:39,886 --> 00:21:41,640
You didn't see me here.

330
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,440
I mean, this kinda thing wouldn't go over

331
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,890
really big with the wife, you know?

332
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,723
- Yeah.

333
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,933
- Thanks.

334
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,133
I'll cover for you sometime, okay?

335
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:02,608
(solemn music)

336
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:09,272
- [Charlie] Hey.

337
00:22:09,272 --> 00:22:10,340
- Hey, those'll kill ya.

338
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,380
- You didn't happen to see Toni, did ya?

339
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,763
Don't think she's ever been late.

340
00:22:14,895 --> 00:22:16,245
- Heard she called in sick.

341
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,510
- Hey, Toni?

342
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,790
Wake up, it's three o'clock,

343
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,623
you've been sleeping for 18 hours.

344
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,493
Are you sick?

345
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,520
You want me to call a doctor?

346
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,130
- No.

347
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,180
I told you, I'm okay.

348
00:22:49,732 --> 00:22:50,565
- Your mother called,

349
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:51,920
she said she wants to stop by after work.

350
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,550
- What for?

351
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,350
- Because she wants to see
how you are, that's what for.

352
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,030
Toni, listen to me, we're
gonna have to deal with this

353
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,400
sooner or later.

354
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,150
This job means a lot to me,
I'm not gonna turn it down.

355
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,120
Well, I'm glad we had this little talk,

356
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,220
I feel so much better.

357
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,788
(doorbell rings)

358
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:43,245
- Hey, mom.

359
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:44,140
- Hello, what's the matter?

360
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,150
I heard you weren't feeling well.

361
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,890
- No, I'm just tired.

362
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,880
- Well you don't have a fever.

363
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,863
- Mom, I'm okay.

364
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,650
- Well you look pale.

365
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,500
Jack, she looks awfully pale.

366
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,420
- It's that night shift she's workin',

367
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,140
when are they gonna put ya on days?

368
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,980
- I like the night shift,
it's not a problem.

369
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,450
- Good, maybe I can get a cup of coffee

370
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,700
to go with these cookies?

371
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,983
- I'll help.

372
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,700
Dean told me about the
job offer from Georgia.

373
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,620
He's very excited about it.

374
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,970
- Yeah, I know.

375
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,760
- Well he thinks you're upset

376
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,510
because you don't wanna leave town.

377
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,363
I don't mean to interfere,

378
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,720
you don't have to explain anything to me,

379
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,820
it's one thing to talk about moving

380
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,010
and it's another to do it,

381
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,073
especially now with your wonderful job.

382
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,013
- Mom, I..

383
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:43,869
- What, what?

384
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:49,360
What is it?

385
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,160
- How's that coffee comin'?

386
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,897
- Oh, it's right here, daddy.

387
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:55,903
Those cookies look great.

388
00:25:08,095 --> 00:25:10,262
- Hey Toni, how you doin'?

389
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:29,162
(suspenseful music)

390
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,860
- This is Stroud reporting
an abandoned vehicle

391
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,167
at 7th Park Street.

392
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,553
- Need any help?

393
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,859
Well aren't we a little jumpy tonight.

394
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:00,710
- What're you doing here?

395
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,533
- Hey, I just came to check
ya out, see how ya doin'.

396
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:07,923
It gets a little lonely out here at night,

397
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:10,393
you never know what's gonna happen.

398
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,760
- Nothin's gonna happen.

399
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,867
- Maybe, maybe not.

400
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,100
But, you gotta be careful

401
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,430
when you're all out here by your lonesome

402
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,900
without any backup.

403
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,820
- What, is that a threat?

404
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,970
- Hey, come on, chill
out, Toni, chill out.

405
00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:33,142
I'm just tryna be my usual helpful self.

406
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,323
Night.

407
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,080
- You stay the hell away from me, Charlie!

408
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,187
- We need to talk, Toni.

409
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:15,260
- Dean, it's been a long shift

410
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,640
and I just wanna finish
this up and go to bed.

411
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,310
- Yeah, well see that's all
you've been doin' lately

412
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,410
is working and sleeping.

413
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,990
I don't think we've said a
dozen words to each other

414
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,893
in the past two weeks and god
forbid I try to touch you.

415
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,780
- I said I don't wanna talk about this.

416
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,880
- Yeah, well I do, I
wanna talk about this now.

417
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,210
- Well since when is
everything about you, huh?

418
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,653
When did you become the
center of the universe?

419
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,878
- Look, Toni-

420
00:28:42,878 --> 00:28:44,710
- Don't.
- Let's not do-

421
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,563
- Don't touch me.

422
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,568
- My god, Toni, what is wrong with you?

423
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:52,703
It's like I don't even know who you are.

424
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,570
- I am the same person I've always been.

425
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,140
- No Toni, you're not, somethings changed

426
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,350
and I don't know if it's
me or if it's Georgia

427
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,402
or if it's this crazy job of yours.

428
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:05,509
- You know what, I've about had it

429
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:08,190
with you and your snide remarks
about my job, all right?

430
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,480
And if you were so unhappy here,

431
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,221
I don't see anyone holding
you here against your will.

432
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:13,380
- Oh, so what're you
suggesting now, Toni, huh?

433
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,213
You want me to leave?

434
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:15,700
- Do what you want, Dean, all right?

435
00:29:17,343 --> 00:29:19,283
I just need some time alone, okay?

436
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,720
- Yeah, well you got it.

437
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,160
In fact, why don't you
take the rest of your life.

438
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,633
- Well, we've been drifting
apart lately anyway.

439
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,093
- People change.

440
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,030
- Our biggest fight was
about my being a cop,

441
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,640
he just didn't understand that,

442
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,223
kept tellin' me I was too smart to be cop,

443
00:29:55,223 --> 00:29:57,567
like that was a compliment or somethin'.

444
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,960
Stace-

445
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,940
- [Stacey] Oh no, it's the goon squad.

446
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,923
- Hello, ladies.

447
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,241
Pour 'em quick darlin'
before I die of first.

448
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:09,520
Hey, nice bulge.

449
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,150
- Just because we had
one bad evening together

450
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,540
doesn't mean you can eat my food.

451
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,798
- You want a second chance,
I know you're crazy about me.

452
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:15,410
- Hey, listen you guys,
I got myself a new place.

453
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,075
- All right.

454
00:30:17,075 --> 00:30:17,990
- Havin' a little house
warmin' party on Sunday,

455
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,010
who's comin'?

456
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,493
- I'm in.

457
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:21,326
- [Stacey] Don't you think you oughta wait

458
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:23,090
'til the ink is dry, pal?

459
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,873
- Hey, I'm back on the market, sweetheart.

460
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,430
- [Weisberg] The markets changed, Charlie.

461
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,999
- [Charlie] Oh yeah?

462
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:31,332
- [Weisberg] Changed a lot.

463
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:33,516
- I don't think Charlie's
gonna have a problem.

464
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:35,303
- [Weisberg] He's a man who knows the man.

465
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,491
- So you comin' to my party, Stace?

466
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:40,500
- Only if I don't have
to sit anywhere near him.

467
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,890
- Weisberg, you comin'?

468
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,183
- Only if Stacey goes.

469
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,140
- How bout you, Toni, you comin'?

470
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,389
Maybe come a little early,
maybe help me set up,

471
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:54,780
you know, make it your place,

472
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,653
give it the nice homey touch.

473
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,356
- What the hell got in to her?

474
00:31:04,356 --> 00:31:05,189
- I don't know.

475
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:07,520
- Not that it's any of your business

476
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,320
but her and Dean split up yesterday.

477
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,450
- Another cop relationship bites the dust.

478
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,720
- Thank you Mr. Sensitivity.

479
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,240
- What, it was a joke!

480
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,137
It was a joke!

481
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,023
Stace, come on.

482
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,650
- Heller, will you gimme the plate.

483
00:31:39,788 --> 00:31:40,621
- Before the rumors start flying,

484
00:31:40,621 --> 00:31:42,780
we wanna let you know what's happening.

485
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,960
A young woman in the community

486
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,542
has accused Charlie Lloyd of rape.

487
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:47,375
- [Man] What?

488
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,530
- Now it is just an allegation,
no charges have been filed,

489
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,070
Charlie's still a member
of this department,

490
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,903
one of our own.

491
00:31:52,903 --> 00:31:54,220
He'll be on paid administrative leave

492
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,960
pending the outcome of the investigation

493
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,360
and he's still welcome here.

494
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:00,010
- What's the girls name?

495
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,663
- I'm really not at
liberty to discuss that.

496
00:32:02,663 --> 00:32:03,496
All right everyone,

497
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:04,804
I'd like to introduce Detective Bob Hymes

498
00:32:04,804 --> 00:32:05,637
from the DA's office,

499
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:07,320
he's going to conducting
a joint investigation

500
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,620
with the department.

501
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,017
Now, Bob's gonna wanna talk to most of you

502
00:32:10,017 --> 00:32:11,923
and I expect your full cooperation.

503
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,693
- This is unpleasant business for us all,

504
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,210
I'm a cop myself so I know
how it feels to be questioned

505
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,880
by a police officer,

506
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,320
so I will try to make this
as painless as possible

507
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:32,727
but still try to do my job.

508
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,070
If anybody here has any information

509
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,076
about the matter at hand,

510
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:41,153
I would appreciate you comin' forward.

511
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:47,560
- Bob will be working
with Lieutenant Feuer.

512
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,260
Let's make sure and show
Charlie our support,

513
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,560
we're still a family here.

514
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:54,707
That's it, back to work.

515
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:03,902
- That's a croc,

516
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:06,503
I say it's that slut works at
the bakery or Ralph Lauren.

517
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,323
- Hey, hey, hey, Toni, what's the rush?

518
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,463
What's wrong?

519
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:18,412
- Everybody on Charlie's shift,

520
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:20,100
Detective Hymes wants to see you first,

521
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,343
I got the sign up sheet.

522
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,700
- I feel so responsible

523
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,025
and if I would've come forward earlier,

524
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:28,858
this might not of happened.

525
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,303
- [Captain Daley] Who else have you told?

526
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,580
- No one.

527
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,740
- [Captain Daley] You
haven't told anyone here?

528
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,051
- No.

529
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:37,884
- Not even Stacey?

530
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:39,560
- Mm-mm, I didn't wanna say anything

531
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,810
because I didn't want to guys to find out

532
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,773
and plus I'm still under review.

533
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,760
- How long have you got?

534
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,703
- Three weeks.

535
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,220
I feel so bad about that girl.

536
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,233
- Toni, listen to me, this is
not your fault, you did fine.

537
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,253
I'll take care of things
from here on out, okay?

538
00:34:12,164 --> 00:34:12,997
- Okay.

539
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,900
What about Hymes?

540
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,350
He's gonna wanna question me.

541
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:20,880
- Don't worry about Hymes for now,

542
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,580
let me have a word with the chief.

543
00:34:24,414 --> 00:34:25,247
- Okay.

544
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,990
- [Captain Daley] I'll
straighten things out

545
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,423
and then I'll get back to you.

546
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,963
- Thank you, Captain.

547
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,570
- It'll be all right.

548
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:59,631
(suspenseful music)

549
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,363
- All right.

550
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:21,298
- I'll see you in a few minutes.

551
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:22,131
- Okay.

552
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:24,883
- Office Stroud.

553
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,163
You know it's been a week,

554
00:35:28,163 --> 00:35:31,153
I'm beginning to think that
you're dodging me on purpose.

555
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,220
- No, sir, I'll get in
there as soon as I can.

556
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,730
- Well don't we just
say that you'll see me

557
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,740
before your next shift, okay?

558
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,573
- Yes, sir.

559
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:41,544
- Okay.

560
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,060
- Excuse me, Captain Daley?

561
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,063
- Not now, Toni.

562
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,542
(solemn music)

563
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,173
- Toni, can I see you a sec?

564
00:36:42,058 --> 00:36:43,683
- [Toni] Yeah?

565
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:46,840
- I heard that you took a theft
report down at the bakery?

566
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,673
- Yeah, I did.

567
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:50,850
- Do you know Anne Davis works there?

568
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,800
- Anne Davis, I don't know who that is.

569
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,983
- She's the woman that claims
that Charlie raped her.

570
00:36:58,177 --> 00:36:59,010
- So?

571
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:01,640
- So?

572
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,973
Redo the report, put Anne
Davis down as a suspect.

573
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,453
- On what grounds?

574
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,120
She's one of nine employees,

575
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,343
I don't have any evidence against her.

576
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:16,093
- Find some, come on.

577
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,070
- Excuse me, is the owner around?

578
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,493
- No, what can I do for ya?

579
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,023
- Are you Anne Davis?

580
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:45,093
- Yes, this is about the theft, isn't it?

581
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,363
- Oh, yeah, I just have to
follow up on a couple of things.

582
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,253
- Mr. Shunwai won't be back till four.

583
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,320
- I'm sorry.

584
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,153
- About what?

585
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,993
- About Charlie Lloyd.

586
00:38:02,262 --> 00:38:04,845
(solemn music)

587
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:11,343
It shouldn't of happened
and I'm really sorry.

588
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,923
If only I had done something, anything.

589
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,033
- Now what could you have done

590
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:27,731
that would have been different?

591
00:38:27,731 --> 00:38:28,658
- Well I could have come forward

592
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:29,491
when Charlie first attacked me

593
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:30,510
instead of worrying so much about my job

594
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,860
and what people were gonna say.

595
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,891
- Toni, you gotta stop beating
yourself up about this,

596
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:35,724
you can't-

597
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:37,780
- Stace, if you could've seen
this poor girls face today,

598
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,910
I didn't even know what
to say to her and Heller,

599
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,260
he wants me to alter my report

600
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,170
and make her look like a thief.

601
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,918
- [Stacey] You're not gonna do that?

602
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:46,751
- [Toni] No.

603
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:48,200
- Well why do you have to
answer to Heller anyway?

604
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,470
- I don't, I'm afraid I made a mistake

605
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,683
trusting Captain Daley.

606
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,953
- Daley?

607
00:38:53,953 --> 00:38:54,870
- Yeah.

608
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,480
You know, he hasn't said one thing to me

609
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,940
since I told him about the rape

610
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,270
and Hymes is really
pressuring me for a statement.

611
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,220
- I don't know.

612
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,010
Toni, I think that you
have to talk to Hymes.

613
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,837
- Stace, everybody is backing Charlie up,

614
00:39:08,837 --> 00:39:10,480
all the guys are.

615
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,833
- Welcome to the boys club.

616
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,880
Listen to me, they have to believe you,

617
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,480
first off because you
are telling the truth

618
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,890
and second off, 'cause in case
you forgot, you're a cop too.

619
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,370
- Yeah, that's just it,

620
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,093
I did forget and someone else got hurt.

621
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,810
- There's no way that you could've known

622
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,780
he was gonna do that again.

623
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,173
- That's my job, my job is to know.

624
00:39:43,138 --> 00:39:45,805
(phone ringing)

625
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,120
Hello?

626
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,783
- Toni, hey, it's Charlie.

627
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,458
Hey, how come you didn't show up

628
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:58,291
at kennel with the boys, huh?

629
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:01,093
We had a good time, I missed ya.

630
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,293
- How dare you!

631
00:40:05,924 --> 00:40:07,920
- [Charlie] You know that
we're good pals, Toni.

632
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,920
Now, don't go shoutin'
me out now, you know?

633
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,640
People are gonna start to wonder.

634
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:19,328
- Get it done right now.

635
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:21,411
- [Officer] Yeah, I will.

636
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,600
- Excuse me, chief?

637
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,840
- What is it Stroud, I'm running late.

638
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,610
- Well I've been waiting
to hear from Captain Daley,

639
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,610
he said he was gonna talk to you

640
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,443
about how the department

641
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:35,638
wants to handle this thing with Charlie.

642
00:40:35,638 --> 00:40:36,710
- There's a chain of command here Stroud,

643
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,560
Daley told you to wait, you wait.

644
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,393
- But, sir.

645
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:41,195
Detective Hymes wants to question me

646
00:40:41,195 --> 00:40:42,900
and I don't know how much
longer I can avoid him.

647
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,650
- Well, I'm sorry, I can't help ya.

648
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,493
- Stroud!

649
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,950
- Yes, sir?

650
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,000
- Your daily logs are passed due.

651
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,300
- I put them on your desk this morning.

652
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,201
- I'm talking about last weeks,

653
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,570
you did them on the wrong
forms, do them over.

654
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,403
- We only switched forms yest-

655
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:57,763
- Just do them, Stroud!

656
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,413
- Yes, sir.

657
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,520
Hey Betsy, is Captain Daley around?

658
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,050
- No, I haven't seen him but
have you heard the latest?

659
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,883
- [Toni] What?

660
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:14,070
- The media coverage on
Charlie is stirin' up things,

661
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,143
three more women have filed complaints.

662
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,170
- For rape?

663
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,443
- Two rapes, one sexual assault.

664
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,497
Looks like Charlie's been a busy boy.

665
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,790
- Is Hymes around?

666
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,850
- You just missed him.

667
00:41:31,752 --> 00:41:34,335
(solemn music)

668
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,940
- Saturday the 12th, the
night of the alleged rape.

669
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,540
Let's see, I do believe that
officer Charlie Lloyd and I

670
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,820
were bowling that night,
in fact I'm sure of it.

671
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,690
Weisberg, you were there,

672
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,403
as I recall, you bowled
an outstanding 199.

673
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,280
- Hey Toni, do you hear the latest?

674
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,370
- [Toni] Yeah, I heard.

675
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,270
- That's four now.

676
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,600
You gotta wonder if there's more.

677
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,120
- Well if there are,

678
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,150
we'll just have to deal
with them, won't we.

679
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,690
- What's that supposed to mean?

680
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,870
- It means we're gonna
take care of Charlie,

681
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,527
that's what that means.

682
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:13,550
You know, Toni, he's
been askin' about you,

683
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,543
he needs our help.

684
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,840
Toni, I think that it would be a good idea

685
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,550
to have a female officer
by his side, you know,

686
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,593
showing her support.

687
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,097
- Yeah, right.

688
00:42:27,676 --> 00:42:28,509
- [Weisberg] Come on, let's go.

689
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:44,362
(gentle upbeat music)

690
00:42:48,074 --> 00:42:50,404
- [Dispatcher] 1-12, return to station,

691
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:53,123
report to Lieutenant Feuer.

692
00:42:53,123 --> 00:42:54,623
- 1-12 responding.

693
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,440
You wanted to see me, sir?

694
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,940
- That's right, I did, Stroud.

695
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,633
Where are your logs?

696
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,260
- I've been on patrol, sir.

697
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,807
- I wanted them before you left.

698
00:43:13,807 --> 00:43:14,640
- But I.

699
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,823
- Turn around.

700
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:19,833
Turn around.

701
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,340
Your shirt is all wrinkled.

702
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,540
- Well I've been sitting
in a car all night.

703
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,940
- I don't wanna hear your excuses, Stroud,

704
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,143
just get me those logs.

705
00:43:35,568 --> 00:43:36,401
- What about my shift?

706
00:43:36,401 --> 00:43:37,234
- Now.

707
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,504
- How you doin'?

708
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:52,337
- Urgh, tired.

709
00:43:52,337 --> 00:43:53,920
- Here, I'll take these for you.

710
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,753
- Thanks.

711
00:43:55,749 --> 00:43:57,381
- Man, what a night.

712
00:43:57,381 --> 00:43:59,310
Hey, Stace.

713
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,143
- Heya, Toni.

714
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,893
- Hey.

715
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,073
- Stroud?

716
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,813
Come with me.

717
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,750
- I'm sorry, you didn't make it.

718
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:37,170
- What do you mean?

719
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,622
- It's all detailed in your
performance evaluation.

720
00:44:39,622 --> 00:44:42,205
(solemn music)

721
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:55,520
- What is this?

722
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,820
What happened to the evaluation
that you did two months ago?

723
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,660
When everything was so good

724
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,310
you said I wouldn't have to do another.

725
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,560
- We need you to sign it.

726
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:06,093
- I won't sign it!

727
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,773
This is wrong, I won't sign it!

728
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:13,003
- All right, signature refused.

729
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,460
- Why are you doing this to me?

730
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,663
- [Feuer] I need your
badge and your weapon.

731
00:45:52,645 --> 00:45:55,895
- I don't deserve this and you know it.

732
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:06,553
- Toni, what's up?

733
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:07,673
- I got fired.

734
00:46:07,673 --> 00:46:12,673
- What?

735
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:14,401
- Betsy, what's goin' on?

736
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:15,707
- She said they fired her.

737
00:46:16,656 --> 00:46:18,989
- What're you talkin' about?

738
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:28,990
- Toni, I can't believe
they did this to you,

739
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:29,870
it isn't right!

740
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,900
- Well apparently right has
nothing to do with it, Stace!

741
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,660
I didn't play by the rules, you know?

742
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,250
I ignored the blue wall of silence

743
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,350
and that is why they're getting rid of me.

744
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,183
Well I'll tell ya somethin',
it's not gonna be that easy.

745
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,270
- Her name is Charlene
McCrosky, M-C-C-O-R-S-K-Y,

746
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,870
she runs a flower shop on Kennedy Street.

747
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,810
Seems Charlie asked her
out, they did some drinkin',

748
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:02,650
got back to her house

749
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,950
and Charlie wouldn't
take no for an answer.

750
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,310
- Thanks.

751
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,430
Who else?

752
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,180
- Ingrid Curtis, C-U-R-T-I-S.

753
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,940
This happened back in '92.

754
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,020
- '92?

755
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,850
- Seems her car broke down,
Charlie offered her a ride home,

756
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:17,790
he took a little detour,

757
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,980
she says he raped her in the backseat.

758
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,970
- That's almost two years ago,

759
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:22,990
why did she wait so long to come forward?

760
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,763
- Who was she gonna go to, cops?

761
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,393
- Anyone else?

762
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:33,420
- Lily Davenport, D-A-V-E-N-P-O-R-T,

763
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,740
she's an ex-friend of
Charlie's and his wife.

764
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,990
I don't know the whole story on this one

765
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,900
but apparently it happened during a party

766
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,960
at their house last year.

767
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,820
- '93.

768
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,327
- [Hymes] Mm-hmm.

769
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,010
(buzzer sounds)

770
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:45,867
- Yes, Helen?

771
00:47:51,029 --> 00:47:52,650
There's a Miss Stroud to
see you about Charlie Lloyd.

772
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,310
- Oh, that's the female cop
I've been trying to interview,

773
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,560
they work the same shift.

774
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,033
- Yes, please send her in, Helen.

775
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,160
- Toni, glad you could make it.

776
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,110
This is Pete Maresca, the assistant DA.

777
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,373
- Charlie Lloyd raped me.

778
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,310
- No, it's all right
Toni, I understand that

779
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,240
but specifically, who did you
speak to in the department?

780
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,220
- [Toni] Captain Daley.

781
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,880
- Did you tell him exactly
what you told us here today?

782
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,880
- [Toni] Yes, I did.

783
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:23,970
- And what did he say?

784
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,390
- He said he would figure out the best way

785
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,430
to handle the situation and get back to me

786
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,510
but I never heard from him again.

787
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,140
- [Hymes] Did you try
talking to the chief?

788
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,310
- Yes, I tried but he
wouldn't talk to me either,

789
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:37,460
he made me feel like I was the
one that committed the crime.

790
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,029
- [Maresca] Did he say why
he wouldn't speak to you?

791
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:41,029
- [Toni] No.

792
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,550
- I'm down here investigating every day,

793
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:48,050
knowing that there are more victims

794
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,880
and trying my best to find
out who those victims are

795
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,770
and low and behold, there's
one right here on the force

796
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:57,429
and you knew about it.

797
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:01,643
Well?

798
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:04,643
- Well what?

799
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,240
- Well I'm sure that you're well aware

800
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,940
that withholding evidence
is a serious felony.

801
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,810
- Whoa, you're way outta line, Hymes.

802
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,743
- I'm outta line?

803
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,010
Charlie Lloyd is on paid
administrative leave,

804
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:23,260
Toni Stroud gets fired and
you have the gal to sit there

805
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,630
and tell me that I am outta line!

806
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,820
- You don't know Toni Stroud
the way we know Toni Stroud.

807
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,980
- She wasn't cutting it Hymes,

808
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,361
ask any of the men she works with,

809
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:34,730
the woman was on her way out.

810
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,130
- And she knew it,

811
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,423
that's why she grabbed her
chance when she saw it.

812
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:41,623
- What chance?

813
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,570
- Anne Davis, the girl at the bakery.

814
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,550
When she filed her
complaint against Charlie,

815
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,050
Toni jumped on the band wagon.

816
00:49:51,023 --> 00:49:53,400
- It was her way of putting us on notice.

817
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,347
It was Stroud's way of saying

818
00:49:54,347 --> 00:49:57,340
"You fire me, there'll be hell to pay."

819
00:50:06,593 --> 00:50:07,964
- How can they say that?

820
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:09,640
What about the evaluation that
the Lieutenant Feuer gave me

821
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,660
where he marked excellent and outstanding?

822
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,710
- That's not what they're saying now.

823
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,653
- Well he's lying.

824
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,903
- It's the code, Toni,
they're enforcing the code.

825
00:50:27,585 --> 00:50:30,085
(phone rings)

826
00:50:36,181 --> 00:50:37,586
- Hello?

827
00:50:37,586 --> 00:50:39,730
- [Charlie] You better be
real careful out there, Toni,

828
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:40,623
accidents happen.

829
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:52,838
- Honey, I am so sorry.

830
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,260
I just wish you'd told
me when it happened.

831
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,520
- I know.

832
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,561
I wanted to but I couldn't,
I was so embarrassed

833
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:03,760
and then when all those women
starting coming forward,

834
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,060
I felt like I was responsible.

835
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,408
- No, he's to blame, not you.

836
00:51:08,408 --> 00:51:09,433
- Yeah and I'm the one they fired.

837
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,690
Mom, I gotta warn ya,

838
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,323
everybody in town is
gonna know about this.

839
00:51:16,747 --> 00:51:20,787
- I don't care about them,
my only concern is you.

840
00:51:22,103 --> 00:51:22,936
- I know.

841
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:29,380
- A total of five women
have come forward now,

842
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,363
including the unidentified female officer.

843
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,403
- [News Reporter] Thank you, Bob.

844
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,290
- Do you think they fired
her because of Charlie?

845
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:39,253
- Yeah, embarrassing.

846
00:51:40,175 --> 00:51:41,750
You know, I never did trust her anyway.

847
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,950
- Gimme a break, Heller.

848
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:45,720
Come on, you know she's a good cop.

849
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,990
- If she cared that much
about the department,

850
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:48,040
she wouldn't do this.

851
00:51:50,021 --> 00:51:50,990
- What're you sayin', man?

852
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:51,987
He raped her.

853
00:51:53,371 --> 00:51:54,723
- That's not the way Charlie tells it.

854
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,179
- Hey Jack, how you doin'?

855
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:07,570
- Hey Stacey.
- Hey Stace.

856
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,103
We'll see you guys later, okay?

857
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:09,970
- [Jack] Okay, see ya at home.

858
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,070
- Don't work too hard.

859
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:21,350
It's getting really weird,
they had a meeting yesterday

860
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,220
and they told everybody
not to talk to anyone

861
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,600
outside of the department.

862
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,970
- Yeah, Hymes said that this would happen,

863
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,210
he said they were really
gonna come down on me.

864
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,300
- I hate this, it makes me so angry!

865
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,220
I mean, Charlie's facing
four felony counts

866
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,820
and you're the one they crucify.

867
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,650
- [Toni] Hey, where's Betsy,
I thought that she was comin'?

868
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,000
- Well, you know how it is.

869
00:52:42,782 --> 00:52:45,273
- [Toni] Well, maybe you
shouldn't be here either.

870
00:52:45,273 --> 00:52:48,326
- What're they gonna do,
take away my ticket book?

871
00:52:48,326 --> 00:52:50,110
(both giggle)

872
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,210
- [Toni] I have to find a job, Stace.

873
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,100
- [Stacey] Well, how
about parking enforcement?

874
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,087
You too, 40 days, you can have all this.

875
00:52:56,087 --> 00:52:57,883
- [Toni] You can have this too.

876
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,280
- Sorry, we tried to reach you to cancel

877
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,570
but you already left.

878
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:03,790
- Well I don't mind waiting,

879
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,410
I've come a long way for this interview.

880
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,960
- But the captain might
not be back till nightfall.

881
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,357
- And I shouldn't bother
rescheduling, right?

882
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:29,750
(care tires squeal)

883
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,790
- Sorry, didn't see ya there.

884
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:32,713
- [Toni] Get lost!

885
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:35,147
- Hey!

886
00:53:35,147 --> 00:53:37,560
You know, some of our old
friends are getting very angry,

887
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,563
if I were you, I'd
watch it, things happen!

888
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:45,554
(car tires squeal)

889
00:53:56,941 --> 00:54:00,264
(knock at door)

890
00:54:00,264 --> 00:54:01,500
- Who's there?

891
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,673
- Toni, it's me, Dean.

892
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,800
Hi.

893
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,633
- [Toni] Hi.

894
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,263
- I'm so sorry.

895
00:54:21,048 --> 00:54:22,153
Why didn't you tell me?

896
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:26,099
- I don't know,

897
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,287
I guess I thought that I
could handle it on my own.

898
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,550
I thought that not telling
anyone was the right decision,

899
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,182
who knew that'd it'd turn out

900
00:54:37,182 --> 00:54:38,713
to be the worst decision of my life.

901
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,963
- So, when's the trial?

902
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,447
- Couple of months.

903
00:54:48,072 --> 00:54:49,093
- What're you doing in the meantime?

904
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,970
- Oh, just working in my fathers store.

905
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,180
- You know, if you want.

906
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,420
Can I do anything for ya?

907
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,237
- No, I'm fine.

908
00:55:08,237 --> 00:55:09,276
- You're sure about that?

909
00:55:09,276 --> 00:55:10,403
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

910
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:14,440
None of my friends are talkin'
to me except for Stacey,

911
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,360
she's been great, oh and Heller,

912
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,280
who took time out from
his very busy schedule

913
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,840
to threaten me.

914
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,760
Let's see, what else?

915
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,570
I'm broke, there isn't a police
department that will hire me

916
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:29,433
in the country but other
than that, I am just fine.

917
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,330
So I hear you're off
the Georgia pretty soon?

918
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,623
- Yeah, yeah, semester, I gotta get ready.

919
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:45,020
- I really hope that works out for you.

920
00:55:46,381 --> 00:55:47,214
- Thanks.

921
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,790
(solemn music)

922
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:56,880
Toni, I wish there was somethin' I could-

923
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,713
- You know, if you write,
I'll write you back.

924
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:09,411
- Take care of yourself.

925
00:56:24,018 --> 00:56:27,018
(suspenseful music)

926
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,554
(glass smashes)

927
00:56:38,554 --> 00:56:41,471
(car tires squeal)

928
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:33,930
(care tires squeal)

929
00:57:58,036 --> 00:58:01,036
(car tires screech)

930
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:05,229
(suspenseful music)

931
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,200
- [Maresca] One man got out of the car?

932
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,033
- Yes.

933
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:00,991
- [Maresca] Did he say anything?

934
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,824
- No.

935
00:59:01,824 --> 00:59:02,839
- [Maresca] And you can't identify him?

936
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,010
- It was too dark, I couldn't see.

937
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,040
- We can assign an officer
to protect you, Toni.

938
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,810
- Oh, come on, do you
really think there's a cop

939
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,820
in this town who cares about my safety?

940
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,170
- Where did you stay last night, Toni?

941
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,050
- At my parents.

942
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,440
- Good, you should stay there,
I don't want you to be alone.

943
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,670
- For how long, huh?

944
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:15,660
Until the trial?

945
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,820
For the rest of my life, what?

946
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,410
- We know you've been through a lot, Toni.

947
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,653
- Somebody tried to kill me last night,

948
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,730
I don't think that this
is worth it anymore.

949
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,890
- What happened to your
thirst for justice?

950
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,540
- I didn't think it was
gonna be this difficult.

951
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,040
- Yes you did.

952
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,640
That's why you didn't report
the rape when it happened

953
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,693
in the first place and if you
quit now, they win hands down.

954
00:59:36,961 --> 00:59:37,910
- Do you really think we stand a chance?

955
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,313
- Yes, I do and frankly, I always do.

956
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,723
This ones not my call, it's yours.

957
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:59,743
Hold on, Bob.

958
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:03,060
Toni?

959
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,696
Wait up, Toni.

960
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:05,770
Hey.

961
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,430
I forgot to give you something.

962
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:08,263
- What's this?

963
01:00:08,263 --> 01:00:10,240
- A civil litigator,
a good friend of mine,

964
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,007
I told him about you

965
01:00:12,007 --> 01:00:13,210
and he thinks he might be
able to make a good case

966
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,543
for wrongful termination.

967
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,403
- Really?

968
01:00:16,403 --> 01:00:17,710
- Yeah, see you were never advised

969
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,460
that you were not meeting
department standards

970
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,440
and you never given any formal warning,

971
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,010
that could lead to a
substantial settlement.

972
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,060
But don't take my word
for it, give him a call.

973
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,150
- It's not about the money,
I don't care about the money,

974
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,720
it's about what they did to me.

975
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,260
- I'm on your side, kid,

976
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,110
just tryna help ya nail the bad guys.

977
01:00:35,347 --> 01:00:36,963
- Funny, that sounds
like what I used to do.

978
01:00:38,724 --> 01:00:40,474
Lemme think about it.

979
01:00:48,048 --> 01:00:49,740
- I would just like to know one thing,

980
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,740
how much of this is she supposed to take?

981
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,573
- Yeah.

982
01:00:54,111 --> 01:00:56,003
- Hymes can't guarantee your safety.

983
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:00,260
Let those three other women
testify against Charlie Lloyd.

984
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,970
- I thought there were four women?

985
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:05,270
- One of them backed out,
apparently it was a long time ago

986
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,944
and she's having difficulty
remembering the details.

987
01:01:07,944 --> 01:01:09,132
- Oh.

988
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,632
- I don't like this, Toni,
I don't like it at all.

989
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,850
- Dad, I know that you're worried,

990
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:18,323
I'm scared too but I can't back down now.

991
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,290
- Well at least just get away for awhile.

992
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,400
- Where am I gonna go?

993
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,600
- I spoke to Aunt Sandy.

994
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,163
- I don't wanna go to Seattle.

995
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,280
Why am I running?

996
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,620
I live here.

997
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,150
- She's right, Jack.

998
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,040
- No, wait a minute, think about it.

999
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,107
Two weeks on a beach in
Bermuda, could be great.

1000
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:40,327
- I do have some good news.

1001
01:01:40,327 --> 01:01:41,840
- What?

1002
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,583
- Well, I was thinking about
applying to law school.

1003
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:49,240
I know it sounds crazy
but if you think about it,

1004
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,660
it's not really any
different than being a cop.

1005
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,340
I would still be out there
getting the bad guys.

1006
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,277
- Ladies and gentleman, Toni
Stroud, attorney at law.

1007
01:02:00,566 --> 01:02:03,066
(sirens wail)

1008
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,273
- [Officer] License and
registration please.

1009
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,660
Get out of the car, Miss Stroud.

1010
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,780
- Did I do something wrong, officer?

1011
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,630
- Your taillights busted.

1012
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:36,463
- It is?

1013
01:02:39,824 --> 01:02:40,657
- See?

1014
01:02:45,905 --> 01:02:47,905
Your headlights out too.

1015
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,223
- Yes, you're absolutely right,
officer, how careless of me.

1016
01:02:58,234 --> 01:03:00,008
- Not gonna lose your
temper, are you, Toni?

1017
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:01,920
(suspenseful music)

1018
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,170
I'm gonna have to cite
you on both of these.

1019
01:03:23,454 --> 01:03:24,579
(gun cocks)

1020
01:03:24,579 --> 01:03:26,337
(gunshot fires)

1021
01:03:26,337 --> 01:03:29,087
(glass shatters)

1022
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:37,342
(car tires squeal)

1023
01:03:51,439 --> 01:03:52,272
- Excuse me, Mr. Stroud?

1024
01:03:52,272 --> 01:03:56,049
Mrs. Stroud, my name is Pete
Maresca, this is Bob Hymes,

1025
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:56,882
were from the DA's office,

1026
01:03:56,882 --> 01:03:58,433
we're prosecuting Charlie Lloyd.

1027
01:03:59,281 --> 01:04:00,613
We'd like to speak to
your daughter please.

1028
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:03,903
- [Jack] Haven't you done enough?

1029
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,680
- Very sorry for your trouble.

1030
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,153
Hi.

1031
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,270
- Forget it, I don't have
anything else to say.

1032
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,560
Look what they did to my parents store.

1033
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,220
- Come on, Toni, people play dirty,

1034
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:35,850
doesn't mean that they win.

1035
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:38,290
- Well as far as I am concerned,
they have won already.

1036
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,790
- They've only won if you
give up and let 'em win.

1037
01:04:43,345 --> 01:04:44,333
Is that what you're saying, Toni?

1038
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,003
You're gonna give up now
and let that bastard walk?

1039
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:51,630
- Why is this whole thing up to me?

1040
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,080
What about those other women?

1041
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:58,997
- Well, there have been some developments.

1042
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:01,638
- [Maresca] You see,
several more of the women

1043
01:05:01,638 --> 01:05:03,583
have decided to withdraw their charges.

1044
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,270
- Why?

1045
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,210
- Well, one of them's been
getting a lot of threats

1046
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:10,350
and she just got fed up and withdrew

1047
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,360
and another one has a new boyfriend

1048
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,243
that just proposed to her

1049
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,233
and he doesn't know
anything about the rape.

1050
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,280
- There's more.

1051
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,300
Anne Davis, the woman from the bakery,

1052
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,350
apparently she's had a lot of boyfriends.

1053
01:05:24,235 --> 01:05:25,603
- What does that mean?

1054
01:05:25,603 --> 01:05:28,410
- It means they were planning
to use that against her.

1055
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,243
- Were?

1056
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,243
Are you telling me that
she's not gonna testify?

1057
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,250
Well that's great!

1058
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,720
That doesn't leave much now, does it?

1059
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,583
- Yes, it does Toni, it leave you.

1060
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,170
- One lousy charge, one count
of rape, my word against his.

1061
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:52,860
- That's right, you were always
our most credible witness.

1062
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,360
- Yeah and now I'm your only witness.

1063
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,660
- That's right, you are,
it's up to you now, Toni.

1064
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:00,260
You can put Charlie Lloyd
away where he belongs

1065
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,160
or you can cut him lose to rape again.

1066
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:05,500
- They will do anything
to protect Charlie.

1067
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,470
I don't think that I can do this anymore.

1068
01:06:13,657 --> 01:06:14,490
- What're you saying?

1069
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:16,223
(solemn music)

1070
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:17,460
- That I want my life back.

1071
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:32,720
- [Judge] Counselor?

1072
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,214
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1073
01:06:34,214 --> 01:06:35,870
Ladies and gentleman,
I just wanna remind you

1074
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,670
that we are here today
to try Charlie Lloyd

1075
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:40,170
for the rape of Toni Stroud,

1076
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,350
Miss Stroud is not on trial here today.

1077
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:45,090
Miss Stroud was a exceptional,
young police officer,

1078
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:47,870
she was conscientious,
hard working, dedicated.

1079
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,630
She was the kind of
officer that would always

1080
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:50,490
go the extra mile,

1081
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:52,720
the kind of officer that
you wanted on your team.

1082
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,330
In fact, ladies and gentlemen,

1083
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:57,170
everyone on the force
felt that way about her

1084
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:59,920
until that day that
she had to come forward

1085
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,173
to tell the very painful truth.

1086
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,910
- The truth, ladies and gentlemen,

1087
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:08,340
is that there is no truth.

1088
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:11,810
The truth is that there was no rape.

1089
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:14,840
The truth is that Toni
Stroud wasn't cutting it

1090
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:18,270
as a police officer and that
in a last, desperate bid

1091
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:21,260
to save her job, she simply
fabricated the charges

1092
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:26,040
against Charlie Lloyd, that is the truth

1093
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,860
and that is what we intend to prove

1094
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,460
during the course of this trial.

1095
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:50,510
- [Weisberg] Toni.

1096
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:51,503
- Who's this guy?

1097
01:07:53,685 --> 01:07:54,843
- Can I talk to you for a second?

1098
01:07:56,016 --> 01:07:56,868
- Yeah, it's okay.

1099
01:07:56,868 --> 01:07:57,716
- You sure?
- You're sure?

1100
01:07:57,716 --> 01:07:58,549
- Yeah, it's okay.

1101
01:07:58,549 --> 01:07:59,382
- Be right across the street.

1102
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,553
- How you doin'?

1103
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,633
- Never better!

1104
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,630
- Look, I'm really sorry for everything

1105
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,053
that's happened to you, Toni.

1106
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:14,663
I've been wanting to tell
you that for a long time.

1107
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,050
You're a good cop, you
didn't deserve this.

1108
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,633
- Thanks.

1109
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,213
- I hope they nail him
for what he did to you

1110
01:08:25,113 --> 01:08:26,043
and what he did to our department.

1111
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:28,780
- Yeah, well I wish
everyone felt that way,

1112
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:30,530
maybe then I'd stand half a chance.

1113
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,763
- Well, anyway, I'm rootin' for ya.

1114
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:42,266
Toni, give 'em hell, all right?

1115
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,710
- Has it been 20 minutes yet?

1116
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,053
Our takeout must be ready.

1117
01:08:54,212 --> 01:08:55,045
- I thought I was goin'?

1118
01:08:55,045 --> 01:08:55,878
- No, I need a break.

1119
01:08:57,394 --> 01:09:00,337
- Okay, it's that old place
in the Delancey Mini Mall.

1120
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:02,420
- Oh yeah, right, I know.

1121
01:09:07,985 --> 01:09:09,068
- I love you.

1122
01:09:12,573 --> 01:09:14,364
- I love you too, daddy.

1123
01:09:14,364 --> 01:09:16,947
(solemn music)

1124
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:01,183
- Toni?

1125
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,490
Toni, wait, take it
easy, take it easy now.

1126
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:05,986
Take it easy, I-

1127
01:10:05,986 --> 01:10:06,819
- Don't touch me.

1128
01:10:08,104 --> 01:10:09,010
- Don't get mad at me, all right?

1129
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,110
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

1130
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:13,084
Okay?

1131
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:14,043
I just need to talk to ya.

1132
01:10:16,594 --> 01:10:17,427
Okay?

1133
01:10:20,151 --> 01:10:20,984
Listen.

1134
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,810
In a few days, they're
gonna put you on that stand,

1135
01:10:28,043 --> 01:10:30,780
I'm here to ask you not
to go through with it.

1136
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,590
Come on, Toni, what do you want me to say?

1137
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,450
All right, what do you want me to do?

1138
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:35,981
My life is ruined already.

1139
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:37,407
- Your life?

1140
01:10:37,407 --> 01:10:38,357
What about my life!

1141
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:42,324
Do you have any idea how hard
I worked to become a cop?

1142
01:10:42,324 --> 01:10:44,150
Do you have any idea
what that meant to me?

1143
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:45,910
And then you just come along
and you take it all away,

1144
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:47,510
you bastard.

1145
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,260
- I came here to give you a chance,

1146
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,940
you got no idea what
they're gonna do to you

1147
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,880
when they put you on that
stand, you haven't got a prayer!

1148
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,770
And when this whole thing is
over with, after you lose,

1149
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:00,670
after you've been publicly humiliated,

1150
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,850
it's not gonna be over.

1151
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:08,380
No, you're not gonna be
safe anywhere you go.

1152
01:11:10,615 --> 01:11:12,532
Not here, not anywhere.

1153
01:11:14,574 --> 01:11:16,324
You think about that.

1154
01:11:27,931 --> 01:11:31,850
- Mr. Theriot, sir, you were
quoted in this newspaper

1155
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:36,570
as saying "Charlie and I just
wanna put this behind us."

1156
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,690
Did you make that statement?

1157
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:40,740
- Don't recall making that statement, no.

1158
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:44,330
- Is Charlie Lloyd a good friend of yours?

1159
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:45,820
- Not particularly, no.

1160
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,240
But he's a good officer and a good man.

1161
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,020
- Could you just please
answer the question, see,

1162
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:53,380
because what I'm driving at
here is why you chose not to act

1163
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,840
after you were informed of the rape.

1164
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:56,673
- Why?

1165
01:11:56,673 --> 01:11:58,130
- That is my question, sir.

1166
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:00,470
- Because I was told that her
reasons for coming forward

1167
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:02,230
might be questionable, that's why.

1168
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:03,530
- I see and who told you this?

1169
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:05,170
- Objection, Your Honor, hear say.

1170
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:06,670
- Overruled.

1171
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,113
You may answer the question.

1172
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,130
- Captain Daley told me.

1173
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,810
- And you believed him?

1174
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:16,610
- Who am I supposed to believe, her?

1175
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:20,330
- And why not her?

1176
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:23,030
- Because I know Daley,
I've known him for years,

1177
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:25,360
Stroud was just a rookie,
practically a stranger.

1178
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,440
- But other women in the
community had come forward

1179
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,570
with similar-

1180
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:29,403
- Objection, Your Honor.

1181
01:12:29,403 --> 01:12:30,236
- Sustained.

1182
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,450
That last remark will be
stricken from the record.

1183
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,080
Watch yourself, counselor.

1184
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,220
- I will and I do beg
your pardon, Your Honor.

1185
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,980
So, a newcomer can file a
complaint but because her status,

1186
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:45,180
or lack of status, her
complaint is ignored

1187
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:48,360
and the word of a senior
man is held as gospel,

1188
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,320
is that the way it goes, sir?

1189
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,510
- You don't understand the way
the department works, do you?

1190
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:53,800
- Obviously I do not, sir.

1191
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,240
Please, tell us.

1192
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,960
- You ever heard of a chain
of command, counselor?

1193
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,260
I can't worry about
every cop on the force.

1194
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,560
The only time a cops name comes up

1195
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,720
is when they're in trouble
and I can tell you one thing,

1196
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,970
Toni Stroud's name had
been coming up plenty.

1197
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:13,010
- Please tell us, Captain Daley,

1198
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:17,070
is it not departmental procedure
to report all complaints

1199
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:19,320
involving a felony to
the prosecutors office?

1200
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,000
- Yes, it is.

1201
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,970
- Then why, sir, did you
not follow this policy

1202
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:25,933
in regards to Miss Stroud's complaint?

1203
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,210
- Her story just didn't add up.

1204
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:30,430
- Why is that?

1205
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:31,990
- She seemed more concerned about her job

1206
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,190
than she did about anything that happened

1207
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:34,250
between her and Charlie Lloyd.

1208
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,083
- Well, excuse me sir,

1209
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:36,550
suddenly you're the psychologist here,

1210
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:38,600
suddenly you're the judge
and the jury in this matter!

1211
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,610
- Objection, badgering the witness.

1212
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:41,580
- Sustained.

1213
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,480
Counsel will put questions to the witness,

1214
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,490
refrain from making
derogatory observations.

1215
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:48,530
- I will do so and I do beg
your pardon, Your Honor.

1216
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:50,710
Now, Captain Daley,

1217
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:54,650
after Miss Stroud
reported the rape to you,

1218
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:57,960
there was a staff meeting,
is that not correct?

1219
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,260
- I believe so yes, we
meet every second Monday.

1220
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:02,530
- All right and how many people
attended this staff meeting?

1221
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:03,390
- 11.

1222
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:06,910
- Including yourself and Chief
Theriot, is that correct?

1223
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:07,743
- Yes.

1224
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,120
- All right, now sometime
during this meeting,

1225
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:14,120
someone recommended terminating
officer Toni Stroud,

1226
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,460
is that not correct?

1227
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,764
- Yes.

1228
01:14:16,764 --> 01:14:18,530
- And do you remember
who that somebody was?

1229
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:19,560
- Objection, Your Honor.

1230
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,010
- [Judge] Overruled, you
may answer the question.

1231
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,690
- No, I don't remember

1232
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:27,100
but I do remember that
I seconded the motion.

1233
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,910
- Oh, you did?

1234
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:31,090
And on what grounds, sir?

1235
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,220
- On the grounds that
she didn't do her job.

1236
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,747
- [Maresca] According to whom?

1237
01:14:34,747 --> 01:14:35,580
- According to me!

1238
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:36,413
And according to Chief Theriot

1239
01:14:36,413 --> 01:14:38,633
and according to the nine
other people in that room.

1240
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,040
They all knew Toni and
not one of 'em said a word

1241
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,083
in her defense.

1242
01:14:46,193 --> 01:14:49,193
(suspenseful music)

1243
01:14:59,877 --> 01:15:02,127
- I'll see ya inside, okay?

1244
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:12,883
- Hi Toni, tell me something,

1245
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:14,230
have you thought about what
your life is gonna be like

1246
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:15,530
after Charlie's acquitted?

1247
01:15:20,091 --> 01:15:22,873
- Excuse me, excuse
me, is there a problem?

1248
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:24,803
Boys?

1249
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:28,383
- No, no problem.

1250
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,213
- Good!

1251
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:34,830
- See you on the outside, Stroud.

1252
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,310
- [Maresca] While this was happening,

1253
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:45,340
did you apply any physical
resistance to him?

1254
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:48,300
- Yes I did but he is
a lot stronger than me

1255
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,600
and he had me pinned down.

1256
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:53,400
- [Maresca] I know this is
very painful and difficult

1257
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,233
for you, Toni,

1258
01:15:54,233 --> 01:15:57,453
but you must tell us now
exactly what happened next.

1259
01:15:59,499 --> 01:16:02,627
- Erm, it was very fast.

1260
01:16:02,627 --> 01:16:07,627
He climbed on top of me
and forced my legs apart

1261
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,013
and raped me.

1262
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,860
- [Maresca] Now, prior to this occasion,

1263
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,360
had you ever had any
discussion with Charlie Lloyd

1264
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,600
about having sex with him?

1265
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,190
- No.

1266
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:20,250
- [Maresca] Did you ever have
any sort of romantic interest

1267
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,560
in Charlie Lloyd?

1268
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,780
- No.

1269
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:25,120
- Did you believe prior to this incident

1270
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,600
that Charlie Lloyd ever had
any sort of romantic interest

1271
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,433
in you?

1272
01:16:28,433 --> 01:16:29,490
- No.

1273
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:32,060
- Did you report this
incident to your superior

1274
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,273
in the police department
at the time it happened?

1275
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:36,170
- No, I did not.

1276
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:37,003
- Why not?

1277
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:39,060
- I was afraid.

1278
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,353
- [Maresca] Afraid of what?

1279
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:45,060
- Erm, I was still under review

1280
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,380
and I thought that it would affect my job.

1281
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:50,240
- And how would reporting a
rape by a fellow police officer

1282
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,690
have any effect on your job?

1283
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:55,310
- It would of been my word against his.

1284
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:57,370
He had been on the force for many years

1285
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:00,403
and had many friends in
the department, I was new.

1286
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:04,020
And you depend on the people you work with

1287
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,750
to back you up in the field,

1288
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,520
I was afraid that they wouldn't be there.

1289
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,650
So I decided not to say anything

1290
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,250
and I thought that I
could handle it on my own.

1291
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:18,270
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1292
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,433
- Why did you pick Captain Daley to tell?

1293
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,700
- Because he had always been there for me,

1294
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,530
I trusted him, he let me down.

1295
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:29,760
- Yet you know he would get
in trouble if at some point

1296
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,610
it came out that you had told
him about the alleged rape

1297
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:35,040
and he never reported it, right?

1298
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,090
- No, that thought never crossed my mind.

1299
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,170
- It never occurred to you
that you were putting him

1300
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:42,150
in a delicate situation?

1301
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:43,120
- No.

1302
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,670
In fact, I didn't even have
time to think about it,

1303
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:48,780
he caught me at a bad moment.

1304
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,363
- Let's review some of the
things you told Captain Daley.

1305
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,520
Did Charlie Lloyd make any verbal threats

1306
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,200
during the alleged attack?

1307
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,033
- No.

1308
01:17:58,033 --> 01:18:00,040
- And he never threatened to use a weapon?

1309
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:00,873
- No.

1310
01:18:00,873 --> 01:18:02,430
- [Defense] Or hit you if you resisted?

1311
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:03,623
- No.

1312
01:18:03,623 --> 01:18:04,456
- Did he in fact hit you?

1313
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:05,289
- Not but he is a lot-

1314
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:06,620
- No will suffice, Miss Stroud.

1315
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,210
Now I understand from your deposition

1316
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:10,530
that were quite confused
about how to react,

1317
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:11,990
is that correct?

1318
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:13,390
- Yes, of course I was confused.

1319
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:16,091
- Confused about your
feelings for Charlie Lloyd.

1320
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:16,957
- Objection, Your Honor!

1321
01:18:16,957 --> 01:18:17,809
- About what you wanted-

1322
01:18:17,809 --> 01:18:20,832
- Objection, Your Honor, objection!

1323
01:18:20,832 --> 01:18:21,838
- Counselor!

1324
01:18:21,838 --> 01:18:23,860
- [Defense] I'm sorry, Your
Honor, it won't happen again.

1325
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:25,080
Tell me Miss Stroud,

1326
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,633
what did you do immediately
after the alleged rape?

1327
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:35,063
- I, I took a shower.

1328
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,930
- Is this what you would normally advise

1329
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:39,610
a rape victim to do?

1330
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:40,443
- No but I-

1331
01:18:40,443 --> 01:18:41,870
- Aren't rape victims
supposed to get themselves

1332
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:43,870
to the nearest hospital
and report the crime?

1333
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:44,703
- [Toni] Yes.

1334
01:18:44,703 --> 01:18:48,210
- And yet you showered, you
washed away all the evidence

1335
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:50,340
and waited for your
boyfriend to come home.

1336
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,770
- That's not fair, I told you why I did-

1337
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:53,620
- Yes, we've heard it,

1338
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:55,760
because you were worried about your job.

1339
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,640
- Yes!

1340
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,460
- Well you know something, Miss Stroud?

1341
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,520
I find this very interesting.

1342
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,410
You claim that things
only started falling apart

1343
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:07,660
after you reported the alleged
rape but it seems to me

1344
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,960
that on the very day
you claim it happened,

1345
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,333
you were already worrying about your job.

1346
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,670
I also understand that
you have filed a claim

1347
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:18,560
against the city.

1348
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,080
- Objection, Your Honor, not pertinent.

1349
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,900
- Overruled, you may proceed.

1350
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,100
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1351
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,690
You believe the city terminated you

1352
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,450
immediately after you
reported the alleged rape,

1353
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:31,520
is that right?

1354
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,868
- Yes.

1355
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,100
- So it's fair to say
that you also believe

1356
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,810
that in order to maintain
a successful law suit

1357
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:37,820
against the city,

1358
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:41,336
you have to convince this jury
that you really were raped.

1359
01:19:41,336 --> 01:19:43,919
(solemn music)

1360
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:52,033
- No, that is not fair to say at all.

1361
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:55,130
- Are you trying to tell
me that you actually think,

1362
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:56,750
as you sit here today,

1363
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,690
that if Charlie Lloyd is
acquitted of your rape,

1364
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,930
you will still have a successful lawsuit

1365
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:02,020
against the city?

1366
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,246
- Yes.

1367
01:20:03,246 --> 01:20:04,400
- On the grounds that you were
fired because you were raped?

1368
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,230
- Those are not the grounds.

1369
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:08,450
The grounds are I was fired
because I told a department

1370
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:10,240
person what happened to me

1371
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,270
and that person not only
failed to do anything

1372
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:14,370
but the sanctions that he took against me

1373
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:16,740
resulted in my termination.

1374
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,160
That has nothing to do with whether or not

1375
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,120
Charlie Lloyd raped me.

1376
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,820
It has to do with what they
did with that information.

1377
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,870
Those are two separate and distinct issues

1378
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:28,480
and if this trial proves anything,

1379
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,730
it's that I was right all
along but what would happen.

1380
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:33,710
The minute I came forward,

1381
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:35,790
these people have done
nothing but try to destroy me

1382
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:36,803
and my family.

1383
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:41,770
- [Defense] Very impressive
show, Miss Stroud.

1384
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:42,603
No more questions.

1385
01:20:42,603 --> 01:20:43,993
- Your honor?

1386
01:20:43,993 --> 01:20:44,940
Thank you.

1387
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,110
Now, Toni, before that terrible day,

1388
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,510
you didn't really have a
worry in the world, did you?

1389
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:53,110
- No, I did not.

1390
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:53,943
- If it please the court, Your Honor,

1391
01:20:53,943 --> 01:20:55,420
I refer to state exhibit B.

1392
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:58,011
And isn't it true that you had received

1393
01:20:58,011 --> 01:21:00,620
the best job evaluation of your career

1394
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:02,680
just a few days prior to the rape?

1395
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:03,960
- Yes, that's true.

1396
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,550
- And were you not looking
forward to the fulfillment

1397
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:07,310
of a lifelong dream?

1398
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:11,223
- I was, I love being a police officer,

1399
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:14,023
I was a good officer.

1400
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,533
But I made a mistake,

1401
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:22,770
I kept quiet about something
that I shouldn't have

1402
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,670
and I convinced myself

1403
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:28,300
that that was the only
sensible thing to do.

1404
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,250
Please go on, Toni.

1405
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:31,920
Tell us what happened next.

1406
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,173
- Something..

1407
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:42,780
Something happened that made
me realize that I was wrong

1408
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,813
to keep quiet.

1409
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:50,280
It occurred to me that
there were probably hundreds

1410
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:55,280
of thousands of women out there
who at one time or another

1411
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:03,400
had kept quiet about
something equally horrible

1412
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:05,490
or perhaps even more horrible

1413
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,830
and that they did it
because they were like me.

1414
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:17,040
They were frightened,
frightened for their jobs,

1415
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,970
frightened of their husbands
or their boyfriends,

1416
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,150
frightened by the community

1417
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:30,640
and I thought fear is not a
good reason to keep silent,

1418
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:32,770
it is wrong and it is selfish

1419
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,423
and other women might get hurt.

1420
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:43,220
So I am glad that I
came forward, very glad

1421
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,410
because it has made me realize

1422
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:50,803
that I can never again
afford to be afraid.

1423
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:55,617
(solemn music)

1424
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:09,707
- The jury has a lot to
consider, it could take awhile.

1425
01:23:09,707 --> 01:23:11,770
- I just want this to be over with.

1426
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:12,603
- I know.

1427
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,443
- I've never seen my father cry before.

1428
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:22,740
- I just want you to know, Toni,

1429
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:25,140
no matter what happens,
whatever the verdict is,

1430
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,817
I'm very proud of you.

1431
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,433
- Thanks.

1432
01:24:07,197 --> 01:24:08,847
- Has the jury reached a verdict?

1433
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:11,986
- Yes, Your Honor, we have.

1434
01:24:11,986 --> 01:24:13,986
- May I have it, please?

1435
01:24:15,554 --> 01:24:18,554
(suspenseful music)

1436
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,543
Will the defendant please rise.

1437
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:37,218
The jury finds the
defendant guilty as charged.

1438
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:43,333
(gavel bangs)

1439
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:45,268
Bailiff, please take the
defendant in to custody

1440
01:24:45,268 --> 01:24:49,018
pending sentencing on
the 26th of this month.

1441
01:24:51,151 --> 01:24:52,512
- Thank you.

1442
01:24:52,512 --> 01:24:54,345
- [Maresca] Thank you.

1443
01:25:05,822 --> 01:25:06,822
- Thank you.

1444
01:25:20,805 --> 01:25:24,388
(news reporters clamoring)

1445
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:37,007
- Miss Stroud?

1446
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,007
Miss Stroud?

1447
01:25:40,486 --> 01:25:42,819
Anne Davis, you remember me?

1448
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:45,097
- Yes, I do.

1449
01:25:46,355 --> 01:25:50,188
- I just, I just wanted
to tell you thank you.

1450
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:01,910
- [Toni] In the United States,

1451
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:04,630
a rape is reported once
every five minutes.

1452
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:07,320
In 40% of rapes reported to the police,

1453
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,200
the rapist is someone the victim knows.

1454
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,230
Most rapes go unreported.

1455
01:26:26,964 --> 01:26:30,131
(gentle upbeat music)

1456
01:27:20,647 --> 01:27:23,814
(light heavenly tone)
