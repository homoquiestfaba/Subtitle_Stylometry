( ''One Girl Revolution'')

2
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,171
I wear a disguise,
I'm just your average Jane

3
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:19,276
The super doesn't stand for model
but that doesn't mean I'm plain

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,845
If all you see is how I look,
you miss the super chick within

5
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:26,825
And I christen you ''Titanic, ''
underestimate and swim

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:34,292
And I'm a one-girl revolution
I'm a one-girl revolution

7
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:39,101
(girl) Hey, I have always known there are
some stories that have to be told,

8
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,630
but I never realized
my memoirs would be one of them.

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:47,544
...that I wanna be
I am confidence and insecurity

10
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:51,050
I am a voice yet waiting to be heard

11
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:55,612
I'll shoot the shot bang
that you hear round the world

12
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:58,351
(all cheer)

13
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,052
(laughter)

14
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,958
Hey,

15
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,294
I caII it ''Dance of FamiIy.''

16
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:11,701

17
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:16,505
Yes! Oh!

I was reaIIy abIe to sense the eternaI
struggIe of nature versus. um. nurture,

20
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,520
- Sorry,

21
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,853
Oh. weII,,,

22
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,826
I've decided to do a video documentary,

23
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,829
Oh, Weren't you gonna write a short story?

24
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:40,890
WeII. that was before I was gonna do
the famiIy scuIpture garden,

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,836
Hi. Dad!

26
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,601

28
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:56,076
You know. I've decided to show the worId
the way the famiIy reaIIy works,

29
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:01,587
I've decided to caII it La Familia,

30
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,681

Sudan,

34
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,124
Then over to Myanmar,

35
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,566
(Kelly laughs)

36
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,662
And then ThaiIand!

37
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,671
- I'm gonna miss you. Dad,

38
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,180
But I'II have my ceII phone on aII the time,

00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,715
Yeah. the best Manhattan has to offer,
Ooh,

Dad... my family.

42
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:44,754
Divorced, alone,
yet having a terrific time.

43
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,460
He knows he has me, the light of his life.

44
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:52,665
Ooh,,, oh. I gotta get you back, Taxi!

45
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,970

48
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:03,182

54
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:34,470
KeIIy. honey. you know what? There's

Can I caII you back? Soon,
Thank you, Bye-bye,

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,156

57
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,752
They are so cute together.
especiaIIy when he takes off the hat,

58
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:54,631
Ex-husband. ex-wife,
A nucIear famiIy that once expIoded,

59
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,467
- KeIIy,,,

00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,872
KeIIy,,, KeIIy, No. KeIIy. KeIIy,

65
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,435
Forget about the fishbowI. honey,
The water damage wasn't that bad,

66
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,065
And you know what? You managed
to save most of the fish,

67
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:38,202
I saved them aII.
because every fish's Iife is sacred,

68
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,406
Maybe if you sIow down just a IittIe bit,,,

69
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:46,577
Mom. Dad said you can't think about art,
It's something you feeI and just do,

70
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,487
WeII. your father is a grownup. sweetie,
Sometimes,

71
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:57,257

WouId it be wrong
to ask how your nose is?

83
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,779
- It Iooks worse than it feeIs,
- Mom says she's in Iove,

84
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:57,449
I guess that's why she's aII pink and smiIey
and Iooks Iike she wants to sing,

85
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,085
- KeIIy,

00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,535

106
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:39,256

00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:39,034
- So. what's he gonna do?

00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,218
You can't do this to me. Mom,

158
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,829
- I don't think so,
- What about if I move in with Amanda?

159
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,165
Her parents won't even notice,

160
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,102
KeIIy. you're much too much fun
to Ieave behind,

161
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,234
And you know what?
FamiIies don't Ieave anyone behind,

162
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,040
Yeah. but,,,

163
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,512
I'm not going!

164
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,313
Promise we'II be best friends
aIways and forever,

165
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,547
I promise, Anyway. I'm not going,

166
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,986
And promise you won't Iike it more there
than you Iike it here,

167
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:34,015
No chance of that,
They wear uniforms,

168
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:38,427
They go to a schooI where they Iearn
about miIitary strategy, They sit in desks,

169
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,227
(scoffing)

170
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,459
- No!
- Yes!

171
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:49,070
WeII. it doesn't matter,
Because I'm not going,

172
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:55,073
I'm not going, I am not going,

173
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:07,383
(man, over PA) Welcome to
the George Washington Military Academy.

174
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,486
(continues indistinct)

175
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,798
,,,1 8. 1 9. 20,,,

176
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,839
(woman)
I don't know but I've been toId

177
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,348
(cadets)  I don't know but I've been toId

178
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,352
-  Streets in heaven are paved with goId
-  Streets in heaven are paved with goId

179
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,548
(Kelly) Hello?
Where can I get a cafe mocha?

180
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,986
(cadets) One,,, two,,,

181
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,224
three,,, four,,,

182
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,773
I could not believe
that this was the man we married.

183
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,711
Sir looked a whole lot different
standing there

184
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,877
than when he was kissing my mother
in our living room.

185
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,774
HeIIo, I'm CarIa,

186
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,614
KeIIy, Nice to meet you,

187
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,679
- You're gonna Iike it here. you know,
- I can't beIieve I have to sIeep in a pIace

188
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,589
without a singIe decent piece of art
on the waIIs,

189
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:51,926
Yuck, We got Captain Stone again,
You know. she's going to dismember us,

190
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,330
Who's this Captain Stone anyway?

191
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,767
Just the meanest 1 6-year-oId in America,
She's our squad Ieader,

192
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,067
She's the one who teIIs us
what to do and when to do it,

193
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,472
That can't be possibIe, We've got brains,
We are thinking peopIe,

194
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:07,411
- Not around her. you're not,
- I hear she's got a buzzard for a pet,

195
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,812
She's probabIy gonna be going
with Brad again this year,

196
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,077
Brad? What's a Brad?

197
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,643
He's the best-Iooking.
most perfect boy around,

198
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:19,988
- And he goes to schooI here?
- Why not me?

199
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,461
As if a cadet major wouId
be interested in any of you guys,

200
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,023
(girl) Yeah. right,

201
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,607
I wouIdn't do that if I were you,
It's not reguIation,

202
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,613
It's just a bIanket,
It's not Iike anyone's gonna see it but us,

203
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,775
- Everything here is by the book,
- Thanks for the warning. CarIa.

204
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:48,309
but I'd reaIIy Iike to try and retain
my individuaIity around here,

205
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,379
(girl) Ten-hut!

206
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:33,895
I'm sorry, Did I accidentaIIy snatch
this ratty oId thing away from you?

207
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:39,598
In my experience. peopIe don't snatch
accidentaIIy, And it's not ratty!

208
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,209
It is now,
And keep it out of my barracks!

209
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,081
Why wouId you do something Iike that?

210
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,913
Oh! My bad,
You must be Captain Stone,

211
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,260
Hmm, You're on my Iist,,, maggot,

212
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,634
You'd be on mine if I had a Iist,

213
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,305
I'II pretend that you didn't say that,

214
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,368
As you were,

215
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,641
Ooh! TroubIe ahead. girI,

216
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,776
WeII. there'II be troubIe ahead for her. too,

217
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,880
You don't get it, In her mind.
you're just a IowIy speck of dust,

218
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,618
WeII. that's not how I see it. OK?

219
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:36,492
We may be in miIitary schooI.
but we stiII Iive in a democracy,

220
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,826
Some things are just gonna have
to change around here,

221
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,924
You're gonna change a schooI
that's been around for a hundred years?

222
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,562
I don't think so,
My advice - don't cross Jennifer,

223
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,373
I hated it - the uniformity, the rules,

224
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,474
the khaki of it all.

225
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:02,385
It was totally clear to me
that George Washington Military Academy

226
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:07,188
needed to become a kinder, gentler
school, and it was up to me to do it.

227
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,955
I have to do everything.

228
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,690
(female cadet) Lights out! Ten minutes!

229
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,231
What?

230
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,996
Excuse me,
My mom Iets me stay up tiII midnight!

231
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,629
(drumroll)

232
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,635
( ''Reveille'')

233
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,905
(female cadet) Let's go. Iet's go!
Ladies. roII out of those racks!

234
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,914
Inspection's at 0800 hours,
Let's go! Move!

235
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,576
Come on! Out of those racks now!

236
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,030
(mouthing)

237
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,797
(mouthing)

238
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:09,815
You wiII adhere to the foIIowing scheduIe,
Am I understood?

239
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,754
Sir. yes. sir!

240
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,719
ReveiIIe at 0600 hours!

241
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:20,493
First mess 0645!

242
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:25,435
None of this made sense.
There were 2 4 hours in a day, not 600.

243
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,439
And why, after cleaning,
would you make a mess? (scoffs)

244
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,911
You again,
Everything cIear. maggot?

245
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,712
WeII. now that you ask.
my watch onIy has 1 2 hours on it,

246
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,753
You get dumber by the minute. don't you?

247
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,587
That is aII,

248
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,527
(whispering)
You're forgetting something. maggot,

249
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,727
What?

250
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,795
Oh!

251
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,805
Now. who wouId put that there?

252
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,753
Ma'am. permission to speak. ma'am,
It's about the maggot. ma'am,

253
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,887
Ma'am. this cadet voIunteers
to teach the maggot

254
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,485
miIitary protocoI and terminoIogy. ma'am,

255
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,086
Do it, Fast!

256
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,861
And teII her about the crocodiIe I wrestIed,

257
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,198
First Iesson: zip it and Iisten,

258
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,798
Two things I have never mastered,

259
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:40,243
Everybody has a rank,
BasicaIIy. you saIute officers,

260
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,745
I've heard of generaIs,

261
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:47,184
Uh. weII. you can teII a person's rank
by Iooking at their chevrons or insignia,

262
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,482
Oh. Sergeant. Major!

263
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,424
Sergeant Major, Hi,

264
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:58,088
I'm guessing. but nobody seems to mind,
Hey,

265
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:02,697
Hey. hey. hey, Stone. Stone,

266
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,300
AII right. there he is,

267
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:10,433
- How's my hair?
- Perfect,,, as usuaI,

268
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,569
Whoa. is that Brad?

269
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,377
Or the cutest boy I've ever seen?
Or both?

270
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,442
(Carla) You got it,

271
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,111
Oh. my gosh. he Iooks just Iike a rock star,

272
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:25,749
And I wouId know.
because I've been this cIose to NSync,

273
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,988
Better stay away,
He's the Stone's man,

274
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,529
And you'II be seeing them together
at the WeIcome Back dance on Friday,

275
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,963
- Did you say dance?
- Yeah,

276
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:37,525
- We're invited too, Everybody's invited,
- Do we get to wear reaI cIothes?

277
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,935
Wear 'em if you got 'em,

278
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:44,131
- HaIt!
- I am so there,

279
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,201
Dismissed!

280
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,737
OK. so I'm gonna casuaIIy bump into him

281
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,009
and just bring up
the WeIcome Back dance,

282
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,244
- Yes. ma'am,
- AII right,

283
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,116
- Hair is good?
- Yes. ma'am,

284
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,212
Good,

285
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,744
(squeals)

286
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,865
- (boy) What was that aII about?
- (Brad) I have no idea,

287
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,603
(clears throat)

288
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,688
I thought she'd be happy
about how quickIy I was Iearning,

289
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,444
Oh,

290
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:56,038
It was here. just south of Mont-Saint-Jean
that NapoIeon fooIishIy tried to spIit

291
00:22:56,108 --> 00:23:00,772
the combined forces of WeIIington and
BIucher, Now. the resuIt of this was that,,,

292
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,542
- Can this wait?
- WeII,,,

293
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:08,849
it wouId be dishonest of me not to teII you
right now that I'm a conscientious objector,

294
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:24,158
- I don't think I got anything right,
- It's just a test to gauge your IeveI,

295
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,726
I don't think I've hit a IeveI yet,

296
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,796
At my oId schooI. we onIy had to do math
when we feIt Iike it,

297
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:34,870
It was a reaIIy good system, We didn't have
to sit whiIe we were doing it. either,

298
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,186
- Hey. whatcha got?
- Oh. nothing,

299
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,752
Just my dress for Friday night,

300
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,594
Let me see,
Oh. my gosh. it's so beautifuI,

301
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,726
- You wanna see mine?
- Yeah. yeah!

302
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,134
Let me see,

303
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,731
Is this yours?
It's such a great coIor,

304
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:06,107
Oh. great,
Oh. my God. rhinestones,

305
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:10,012
Oh, Oh. that's great,
And Iook at the IittIe top,

306
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,346
It's so cute,

307
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,426
- Hey,
- Hey,

308
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:32,863
Come on. Iet's go take a waIk - or a march.
or whatever it is you guys caII it here,

309
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,529
Sure,

310
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,473
Whoo, I beIieve in gun controI,

311
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:46,484
Around here. that is gun controI,
Don't worry. they can't be fired,

312
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:51,012
The driII team's a big deaI,
It's Iike our arms footbaII team,

313
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:56,258
You know. miIitary Iife may be
for some peopIe. but it's just not for me,

314
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,319
It's something you have to adjust to,

315
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:02,060
PeopIe Iike Jennifer are used to it,
Both her parents are army,

316
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,967
- Commandant coming,
- There's dust on those boots,

317
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,502
At ease. Cadets,
Where are you young Iadies going?

318
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:14,876
Home. to pick out some dresses
for the dance Friday night,

319
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,079

You cannot taIk to the commandant

324
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:39,267
You see. he's my stepdad,
He and my mom met at a wedding.

326
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,841

327
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,709

00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:15,302
- There she is! Hi. baby!
- Hey. Mom,

334
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,968
One of the great things about Mom
is she always greets you

335
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,874
like you've been gone for three years.

336
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:24,905

What do you think?

340
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,787

341
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:42,266
Hmm, You know. I think the bIue is it,

Hmm,

345
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,107
Maybe there is a feminine side
to miIitary Iife,

346
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,208
Argh!

347
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,824

I'd Iike to see you skip that,

352
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,746
That's right - if I did. you wouId've

372
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,731
You are an embarrassment

377
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,684
So. what are you gonna do when a
member of your team is counting on you?

378
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:50,381
You're gonna Ieave a man behind?
No! You're gonna rappeI down that rope

379
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,856
and you're gonna get him!
No one gets Ieft behind! Is that cIear?

380
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,258
I hate heights,
I'm even hoping not to get too taII,

381
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,966
HeIIo! I faII even
when I'm just waIking around!

382
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,297
Atten-hut!

383
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,169
- Is anyone eIse out there?
- (all) Sir. no. sir!

384
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:19,650
WeII done, The WeIcome Back dance
begins at 1 900 hours,

385
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,380
Dismiss your squads,

386
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:24,922
Dismissed!

387
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,405
Um,,, I'm getting a IittIe hungry,

388
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:51,707
Ooh. how about sending for some Caesar
saIad with a IittIe bit of Cajun chicken.

389
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,547
a touch of ciIantro and a IittIe bit
of Iemon dressing on the side.

390
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,247
with some of those oyster crackers?

391
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,123
Yummy,

392
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,784
Fine,

393
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,526
Oh!

394
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,339
Mommy!

395
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,784
Whoo,

396
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,344
Sergeant Ramos wiII take over from here,

397
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,947
You're gonna do this course
untiI you get it right,

398
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,857
But what about the dance?

399
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:40,990
- Hmm. uh. you're not gonna be there,
- Are you sure you're aIIowed to do that?

400
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:45,366
What are you gonna do about it?
TeII your stepfather?

401
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,564
Hmm?

402
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,438
- I'II teII you what I'm gonna do about it,
- What?

403
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,845
AbsoIuteIy nothing,,, ma'am,

404
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,418
Maggot,

405
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,716
Ten-hut!

406
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,691
Back up! Let's go! Onto the tires!

407
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,925
Go quick! And pick your feet up!

408
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,364
Oh! This is just great!

409
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,569
- Why me?
- Let's go!

410
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:30,911
Sergeant Gloria Ramos,
my own private slave driver, was tough,

411
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,611
but she didn't have
Jennifer's 1 00 percent look of hatred.

412
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:40,386
I decided to try and find the real Gloria,
the one who was craving to be human.

413
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,053
I'm sorry you have to stand over me
Iike this and miss the dance,

414
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:46,859
- I don't dance,
- Don't you wanna Iisten to the music?

415
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:49,958
- I hate music,
- Nobody hates music,

416
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:53,493
It's a primitive instinct which I'm sure
you couId unIeash any time you want,

417
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:54,903
Never happened,

418
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,032
We have got to get to the bottom
of your deniaI,

419
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,134
- Get moving!
- I intend to,

420
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:03,272
I can diagnose and cIimb at the same time,

421
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,815
Under the wire. Cadet!

422
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,479
Ow! Ah!

423
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:14,992
- Your arm is bIeeding!
- Oh. that's what that sticky red stuff is!

424
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,621
- How do you feeI?
- I don't feeI! I just wanna finish!

425
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:22,098
I'm gonna do this.
and it's gonna be my personaI best!

426
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,193
EspeciaIIy since
I've never done this before,

427
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,798
From the haIIs of Montezuma.
to the shores of TripoIi

428
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,399
That's the Marines!

429
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:35,606
How about,,,
Row. row. row your boat. gentIy,,,

430
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,740
Ah! That's the Navy,

431
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:45,684
I don't think I'II ever be abIe to do this,

432
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:52,421
Back home in Ponce.
we have the most beautifuI stars,

433
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:56,456
When I'm crawIing in the mud here.
I pretend I am there.

434
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,800
on the beach.
and the sand is soft and warm,

435
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,704
Oh. GIoria. that is pure poetry,

436
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,642
Let me show you, Use your eIbows,

437
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:13,277
It gives you more stabiIity
and heIps you get there faster,

438
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,581
Use your knees to push,

439
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,680
Then. when you have
to get under some wire.

It stopped raining!
Thanks. GIoria,

445
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:45,073
Maybe sometime I can prove to you
that good times aren't just for chumps,

446
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,710
I'II teII you what - you can try,

WeII. at Ieast somebody knows
how to get down and dirty,

463

It would've been so cool

under any other circumstances.

465

As you know. my father was
commandant of this academy.

so I understand the position you're in,

He was harder on me than the others
just to prove he was fair,

You know. in those days.
peopIe didn't understand

You'II put it behind you someday,

I am not happy about your performance

I'm not exactIy happy with what's going on.
either, Things couId be much better,

473
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:44,626
Did you know that there's this whoIe group
who practice throwing around rifIes?

They're Iike robots or something,

I was one of those robots

Uniformity is something we strive for,

486
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:37,615
- Are you sure that's a good thing?
- I'm positive,

487
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:44,424
AIthough individuaI dignity is respected.
the individuaI is at the service of the group,

488
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:47,158
That's why we caII it the service,

495
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:43,313

497
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,824

00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:01,605

Ta-da!

513
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,719
The baby's room is gonna need those
beautifuI paintings you do so weII,

514
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,123
Oh. I Iove it

519
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,810
I couldn't tell her I wanted to quit school.

520
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,817
We couldn't bring a baby into this world
among even one ounce of chaos.

521
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,944
- HeIIo,

Suddenly, it dawned on me
that Sir wasn't ready to be a father yet.

528
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:43,838
List of things to do.: give Mom

to let people use their own blankets.

531
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,481
I had to do everything.

532
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,047

540
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,325
You know,,,

00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:38,080
So,,, you caII that a shoeshine?

644
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:42,217
You know. we can get gigged for that,

645
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,151
Now. that's how you do it,

646
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,957
You make me Iaugh. Cadet KeIIy,

647
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:27,868
(hawks up spit)

648
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,705
FIip arms!

649
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,377
Reverse fIip arms!

650
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:47,982
Port arms!

651
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:52,490
FIip reverse! Present arms!

652
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,670
At ease,

653
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:06,506
As you know. we have a meet coming up
in two weeks, But it isn't just a practice,

654
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:10,707
It's our first step towards
winning the regionaIs,

655
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,410
So,,,

656
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,179
make me proud,

657
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,949
Atten-hut!

658
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,252

Reverse fIip arms!

661
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,539
That's when it hit me -
this was like ''Swan Lake, ''

662
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:44,911
only, instead of tutus,
everyone was wearing uniforms.

663
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,042
But still, it was so beautiful.

664
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,031
Sure. I'II heIp you with the equipment,

665
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:09,334
Our team may not be the best.
but it'II be the shiniest,

666
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,533
That is so incredibIy nice of you,

667
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,974
Part of what we Iearn here
is to heIp each other,

668
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:17,810
I swear I wouId,
If onIy I'd,,, fit in. you know?

669
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:21,248
- No one fits in at first,
- So. what about you?

670
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:26,080
Me? I'm Iucky to be here,

671
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:31,150
Home wasn't,,,
It wasn't what I wouId've picked out,

672
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:34,720
This is Iike a heaven on Earth
for a girI Iike me,

673
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,762
Hey. CarIa. you think you'd Iike
to have dinner with us Friday night?

674
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,705
- Maybe stay over?
- Hmm,

675
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:47,807
- Sure, I'd Iove that,
- OK,

676
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:07,130
Sir, Can I borrow some spit. sir?
Promise to pay you back,

677
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,197

679
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,866
- Sure,

680
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,531
'Cause I wouId reaIIy Iove

681
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:18,165
and I'm sure you wouId too,

682
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:21,405
I don't mean to brag.
but I aIways bring Iuck to things.

683
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,140

00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,587
Guns. pIease,

694
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:55,867
Everything squared away. Captain?

695
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:03,268

I expect you aII to do
a heck of a Iot better next time,

712
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:46,655
We obviousIy have to practice.
practice. practice,

713
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:49,824
That performance today
was a compIete and totaI,,,

714
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,867
Come on. give it a rest,

715
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,926
It's not practice that we need,

716
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:56,438
In the reguIation phase.
we're as good as anybody,

717
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:59,532
The probIem is the exhibition phase,

718
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:06,640
I mean. we need inspiration,
OriginaIity, Creativity,

719
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:11,915
Anyways. good job. peopIe, We'II get 'em

Shoot,

723
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:59,091
Uh,,, nothing, It's just a IittIe something
I thought wouId cheer you up,

724
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,408
Do it again,

725
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:11,008
- And that's an order,
- Sir. yes. sir!

726
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:16,784
(sighs) OK, here was my to-do list.:
keep Sir and Mom's relationship going,

727
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:22,223
shepherd a baby into the world,
and win a drill team medal for Brad.

728
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,055
I have to do everything.

729
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,089
Wish me Iuck,

730
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,266
- Hey,

731
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,940
- What's this?
- It's a braceIet you tie on your wrist,

732
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:47,414
You make a wish.
and when it faIIs off your wish comes true,

736
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:07,965
I've decided to try out for the driII team,
And I need you to be my coach,

737
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:11,768
It wouIdn't be professionaI
if you didn't Iet me pay you,

738
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,978
Once again, I'd seen it proven true -
accessories are a girl's best friend.

01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:28,357
Who is the Commander in Chief
of the Armed Forces of the United States?

744
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,975

01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:25,967
It's come to my attention.
without my knowIedge or approvaI.

774
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:29,869
that you've tried out for the driII team,

775
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,169
Sir,,, sir. yes. sir,

776
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:40,808

Permission to speak. sir,

782
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:17,112
I admit it was a good idea for you
to sentence me to the driII team,

783
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:22,180
It was a great Iesson for me, But. sir.
you have some Iessons to Iearn. too,

Babies can't saIute, They're IittIe,
They cry even when they don't have to,

787
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:42,074
They're not exactIy cIean. but they
smeII pretty good - most of the time,

788
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,443
They have to be smiIed at constantIy.

789
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:48,109
and you have to carry them around
aII night and day,

790
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,379
If not. they tend to yeII,

01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,085

Iike that into the exhibition phase

827
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,094
at the regionaIs,

828
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:25,725

I don't even remember what I did,

830
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:32,430
Anyway. it doesn't even matter,
I mean. there was fire. spirit,

831
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:37,241
Our team couId use a IittIe more of that,
Do it again - it was good,

832
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:44,614
The BattIe of the Choisin Reservoir
in the frigid winter of 1 950-51

833
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:48,555
was not a retreat
but an advance to the rear,

834
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:52,151
One of the greatest strategic
rescue operations in miIitary history.

835
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:54,662
even if it was the Marines,

836
01:13:56,666 --> 01:14:01,069
- So. advancing to the rear is a good thing,
- In this case. an exceIIent thing,

837
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:05,369
The 1 st Division stayed together.
worked together and survived together,

838
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,807
Wow. It continued to amaze me

839
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:12,371
that the stuff you learn in military school
could actually apply to real life.

840
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:17,442
I suddenly understood why it was
important to stomach Jennifer.

841
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,653

1052
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:29,278
Maybe, just maybe,
I don't quite have to do everything.

1053

We're down by five points,

The super doesn't stand for model
but that doesn't mean I'm plain

1082
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:27,401
If all you see is how I look,

01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:36,032
Present arms!

1143
01:38:46,053 --> 01:38:48,954
Spin order,,, arms!

1144
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:54,854
Since this is my first autobiography,
I might not have gotten everything right.

1145
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:58,990
The events are true,
the feelings are genuine,

1146
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:02,229
and my memoirs are finished.

1147
01:39:03,237 --> 01:39:06,570
But I might have forgotten
what everyone was wearing.

1148
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:08,836
(chuckles)

1149
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:19,879
( upbeat instrumental)
