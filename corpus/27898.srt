1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Mrs. Larson?

2
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
It, uh...

3
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,560
It won't be much longer, Mrs. Larson.

4
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,480
Well, is he in a lot of pain?

5
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,320
No. No, no. There will be
No more pain for your husband.

6
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,720
He's heavily sedated.

7
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,240
OK. I think I'm gonna go
send little Hal in now.

8
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,400
No. No, no. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,560
With all the pain killers, uh...

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,240
the reverend's not exactly himself.

11
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,800
Look, I think my boy has a right
to say goodbye to his father.

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
I mean, the man means
everything in the world to him.

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,480
Well... your call.

14
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Nurse?

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,040
Yes, Reverend Larson?

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,680
- Did you see the cowboy?
- The cowboy?

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,520
The cowboy who gave me
the singing nickel in Pudding Town?

18
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,680
OK. I think it's time
to turn down the morphine drip.

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,280
Reverend Larson, your son is here.

20
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,320
OK, sure. Send her in.

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,280
Ladies? A little privacy.

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
(wheezy coughing)

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
Dad?

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,280
It's me, Dad. Hal.

25
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,160
Oh.

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
Glad you're here, kiddo.
Got a few things to tell ya.

27
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,600
First, I want you to promise
that no matter what you do in life,

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,640
you will never ever settle for average.

29
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,520
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,040
Second, don't be satisfied
with routine poontang.

31
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
Huh?

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,680
Don't do what I did.

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,760
I married for love, and your mother
Betty has been a nightmare.

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,240
But, Dad, Mom's name is Marian.

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Listen to me. I'm giving you pearls here.

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,640
And third, find yourself...

37
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,440
a classic beauty...

38
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,160
with a perfect can... and great totties.

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,360
That will put you in good stead
with the Lord. It's all in here.

40
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Yes, sir.

41
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,240
Hot young tail's what it's all about.

42
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,760
Hot... young... tail.

43
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,680
I'll make you proud, Papa.

44
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,040

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,600

Jackass, can you not hear me down there?

56
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,280
I don't want anything to do with you,
you little warthog.

57
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,760
You had me at "Get lost".

58
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,560
- What's up, Mauricio?
- Hey, Hal.

59
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,120
- How's the crowd tonight?
- Good. I got a few bites.

60
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,160
- Can I get you a drink?
- I won't say no to that.

61
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,400
Two beers.

62
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,000
- Two Buds?
- Two Buds.

63
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,640
So, I didn't expect to see you here.
Where's your new girl Loni?

64
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,640
- Lindy.
- Lindy.

65
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
- She's, uh...
- (bartender) There you go.

66
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,880
Actually, I didn't tell her
I was goin' out tonight.

67
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,000
Why not? Things OK with you guys?

68
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,640
Yeah, a little too OK,
if you know what I'm talkin' about.

69
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,040
- What does that mean?
- Things are going in the shitter real quick.

70
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,200
Jeez, I'm sorry to hear that.
Why is she dumping you?

71
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,360
- She's not. I'm dumping her.
- You're dumping Loni?

72
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,800
- Lindy.
- What, are you crazy? Lindy's gorgeous.

73
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,320
On the surface, but when you get to know her
better, there's a whole other story goin' on.

74
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,440
Yeah? How goes that?

75
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,800
We're sitting there, you know, and
she's got her bare... feet up on the couch,

76
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,600
and I notice that her second toe is, like,
half an inch longer than her big toe.

77
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,960
- That's it? You're breaking up over that?
- Hey, I don't need that circus shit.

78
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,400
Well, couldn't she get the toe
filed down or something?

79
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,120
What, then I'm dating a nub?

80
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm starting to think we're jinxed here.

81
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,160
- Speak for yourself, my friend.
- What, you got the promotion?

82
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,520
I don't hear till tomorrow, but guess who
is now officially going out with Jill.

83
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,640
Jill?! Your neighbour Jill?
You're going out with Jill, your neighbour?

84
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
And she doesn't exactly hate me.

85
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,800
Get out!

86
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,320
You are the luckiest man on the planet.
So what are you doing here?

87
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,200
She's hostessing until 11. I better get going.

88
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,920
I'm gonna try to catch her on the way home,
see if she wants to get a drink.

89
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,000
If I know you, that's not all she'll be gettin'.

90
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,160
See you later.

91
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,920
- I said no.
- No? Why not?

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,360
I don't wanna have a drink with you. I wanna
go home. Is that so hard to understand?

93
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,560
- What's goin' on? Are you mad?
- No, I'm not mad. I just...

94
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,880
Go on, say it. You know what?
No matter what it is, we're gonna work it out.

95
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,160
Hal, I'm not attracted to you.

96
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,200
So what? You think everyone who goes out
is attracted to each other? Get real.

97
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,000
They're attracted to each other
in the beginning.

98
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,640
Oh, come on. That sounds
like a bunch of New Age hooey.

99
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,240
Maybe for some people
there's a little spark in the beginning,

100
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,360
but for most, the attraction part
happens way later. Whoa!

101
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,880
What? That's it?
Just like that, we're breaking up?

102
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,320
Well, we were never going out.
We just had one date.

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
Come on. Hey, let's stay together five days.
That's all I need.

104
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,480
- Why do you need five days?
- Tomorrow I'm finally getting my promotion.

105
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,200
There's gonna be parties, dinners,
this, that. I need you now.

106
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,480
Hal, you're gonna be so busy,
you won't even think about me.

107
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,920
How am I not gonna think about you?
You live right across the hall.

108
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,720
I don't know, Hal. Maybe...
maybe you should think about moving.

109
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,160
Hal, we've made a decision
regarding that wholesaler position.

110
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,040
Yes! It's about time, Dave.

111
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,960
We decided to go with the gal from Merrill.

112
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,440
She's a proven entity. A big producer.

113
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,560
- I'm sorry, man.
- No, it's...

114
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,040
The gal's a proven entity.
What the heck you gonna do?

115
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
- Hal, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, thanks.

116
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,080
- You should have gotten it. You deserved it.
- No, I didn't.

117
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,720
I didn't put them in a position
where they had to promote me or lose me.

118
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,840
It's a good lesson.
Make yourself indispensable, that's the key.

119
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,400
And to make matters worse,
Jill dumped me last night.

120
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,840
Dumped you? Don't you have to be
going out to get dumped?

121
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,760
- What does that mean?
- Well, I just thought it was more of a...

122
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,080
Anyway, why do you care so much?
Jill wasn't right for you and you know it.

123
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,560
How can you say that? She was perfect.

124
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,040
When are you gonna get it?
They're just well-formed molecules.

125
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
And by the way, her tits weren't even real.

126
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,360
Well, I could squeeze 'em.
That's real enough for me.

127
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,960
Hal, I don't understand how a guy

128
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,680
who's as nice and loyal and generous as you
could have such a huge flaw.

129
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
What are you talking about?

130
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,600
It never occurred to you that picking girls
on their looks may not be the best way?

131
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,680
Am I supposed to apologise
for having high standards?

132
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,400
High standards? ln the five years
I've known you, every woman -

133
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,520
I should say girl - you've gone after
has been completely out of your league.

134
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,000
- What's that supposed to mean?
- She doesn't mean anything by it.

135
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,520
She's just saying
you're not that good-looking.

136
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,680
Oh! I thought she was implying
something really mean.

137
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,520
No.

138
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,000
Hey, it's you. You're the TV guru guy.

139
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,840
- Yes, Tony Robbins. Pleased to meet you.
- Yeah! Oh, man!

140
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,000
So, wow! You gave advice
to what chama call it.

141
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,400
- President Clinton? Mandela?
- No, no, no.

142
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,000
- Gorbachev?
- No, no. Pamela Anderson.

143
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,840
Right? Yeah! Give me another handshake.

144
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,320
Wow! Man, look at those mitts!
It's like grabbing a bunch of bananas.

145
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,240
And those dogs. How big are those?

146
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,840
- Size 16, buddy.
- Holy cannoli.

147
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,280
- So you must do pretty good with the ladies.
- Just one.

148
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
- Really?
- Yeah.

149
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,040
(chuckles)

150
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,080
She sounds hot!

151
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,680
- She is an amazing lady.
- I bet.

152
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,520
- So, what are you doin' in my town?
- We're doing a seminar here.

153
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,720
I help people to deal with the challenges
in life with more dignity and courage.

154
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,600
That's my deal, is the courage. I try to...

155
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,400
Hang on a second. Buddy, hang on.
The elevator just stopped. That's weird.

156
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
- Man, yeah. So what do we...?
- Hang on.

157
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,000
- Are you OK? I'm fine.
- You OK?

158
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,280
Yeah, yeah. It's just I feel a little light-headed.

159
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,960
Then she dumped me. Flat out. Without
even the courtesy of a severance pop.

160
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,120
- A severance pop?
- You know, one last...

161
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,400
To ease the pain. The nice ones'll
sometimes throw you that.

162
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,080
It sounds like you've had
some odd relationships.

163
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,320
Yeah. See, the problem is I'm kinda picky.

164
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,200
- What do you mean, "picky"?
- Well, for instance, I like 'em real young.

165
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,320
Like, did you ever see Paulina
in her first Sports Illustrated layout?

166
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,440
- You're looking for a young Paulina type?
- That face, but with better headlights.

167
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,680
You know how hers
have kind of dimmed lately?

168
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,360
Heidi Klum's beams would do. And her teeth.

169
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,640
Or that Britney Spears girl.
She's got great knockers.

170
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,240
But she's a tad muscular.

171
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,360
Actually, you know what? Her ass would do,
too, if she had a better grille.

172
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,240
Like Michelle Pfeiffer
back when she did Grease 2.

173
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,480
But she'd have to be
a little smilier than Michelle.

174
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,920
Like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos,
before she got Stamosed.

175
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,880
But not as skinny. Someone meatier,
like Heidi, but without the accent.

176
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,840
You know those accents: yah-yah-yah-yah.

177
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,440
They really get old fast. You know
what I'm saying. Someone like that.

178
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,760
Don't you think you're being a little bit
shallow in the way you look at women?

179
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Well, no. I mean, you know,
I'd like her to be into culture and shit, too.

180
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,000
OK, hypothetical situation.

181
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,520
Which do you prefer, a girlfriend
missing one breast or half a brain?

182
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,480
Ooh, toughie. That's a toughie.

183
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,640
How's the remaining breast? ls it big?

184
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,640
- How's your relationship with your parents?
- Excellent. I mean, my mom's hilarious.

185
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,840
She golfs every afternoon.

186
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,880
Actually, I don't really remember my dad.
He died when I was nine, so...

187
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,560
If you were nine, you should remember a lot.

188
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,480
Yeah, but I don't.

189
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,400
My mom thinks I might have been
a little traumatised by the whole thing.

190
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,840
Anyway, all I remember is, he was great.

191
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,200
He was a great guy,
and I really loved him, but...

192
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,800
I'm sorry you lost him.
Hey, listen, I know you got a great heart.

193
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,880
You're just fixated on
the outside appearances of people.

194
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,840
- Hal Larson, I'm gonna do you a great favour.
- Really?

195
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,440
This is how it'll work. From this moment on,
whenever you meet someone in the future,

196
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,840
you're only gonna see what's inside them.

197
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,040
So you'll respond to that, because that,
my friend, is where the true beauty lies.

198
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,800
OK, Tony, I think
you're getting a little cabin fever.

199
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
Hold on. What if I told you by doing this,

200
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,600
you could have the most beautiful women
in the world and they'd want you?

201
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,640
- Is this like what you do in your seminars?
- No, no, this is very special.

202
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,760
This is just between you and me.
Let's get up and I'll show you what to do.

203
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,600
Now, you got a pattern of looking at women
and judging them by the exterior.

204
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,440
We gotta break that pattern.
So has there been a time

205
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,560
when you were especially shallow with a
woman, where you thought you were better?

206
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,200
- All the time.
- All the time.

207
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,960
Is there one specific time
where you were really shallow?

208
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,440
- Oh, yeah, I got one.
- Think about that.

209
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,680
Devils, come out!

210
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,200
- What the hell are you doin', banana hands?
- Just hang on.

211
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,200
- We gotta jolt your nervous system.
- Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

212
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,600
It's not just talking about it. Here's what
I want you to do. Just relax for a moment.

213
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,600
- I won't do that again.
- I didn't mean the "banana hands" thing.

214
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,600
Close your eyes. Just relax. And I want you
to imagine that you're on a beach.

215
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,360
It's a warm day and the sun
is just starting to set.

216
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,120
And you're looking in the eyes of a woman,
and you're feeling her heart.

217
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,640
You're seeing her soul.

218
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,280
You're feeling her spirit.

219
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,960
That's it. That's it.

220
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,360
Excellent. Excellent.

221
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Taxi!

222
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,200
Oh.

223
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,840
I'm sorry. I... I thought that...

224
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,920
No, it's my fault. I didn't see you.
This is your cab. I'm gonna get the next cab.

225
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
- OK.
- All right.

226
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,400
Look, I'm just... I'm just
headed over to the East Side.

227
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,200
- Do you wanna share, or...?
- Yeah!

228
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,720
Yeah, let's take this one.
So, awesome. Thank you. Terrific.

229
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,240
- Where to?
- East Side Plaza for me, please.

230
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,720
Likewise.

231
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,960
- What?
- Oh. Huh? Sorry. I just...

232
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,480
I mean, yeah, you're... you're really pretty.

233
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,480
Yeah, right. Jeez,
is everybody in this city so flattering?

234
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,120
I figured you weren't from around here.
Where you from?

235
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
- Boston.
- Bean Town.

236
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
The musical fruit.

237
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,760
The more you eat, the more you... toot.

238
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,840
So, are you here on a shoot or something?

239
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,880
- A shoot?
- I mean, you must be a model, right?

240
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,920
My grandmother's not doing so well, so I
took a year off from school to help her out.

241
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,800
Oh. Helping granny. Cool.

242
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

243
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,800
Bye.

244
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,440
So, nice catchin' up.

245
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:09,120
Listen, um... I know you'll probably think
I'm some kind of wacko for asking, but, um...

246
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
What?

247
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,960
Well, while you're here in town,
I mean, you know...

248
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,440
If you ever feel like taking a break from
hangin' out with your old sick granny,

249
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,040
you know, we could...

250
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,600
- Sure. I mean...
- Really?

251
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,480
Are you kidding? Yeah! That'd be...

252
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,800
I would absolutely love to, if...

253
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,480
OK, yeah. I should get your number, then.

254
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,640
No, no. I'll get yours, because it would...

255
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,000
- With my luck, you'll lose mine, so...
- Oh. I get it.

256
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,960
Very funny. You got me.
That was... No, that was good.

257
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,000
You could've just said no,
but you went the extra mile. That was harsh.

258
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,480
- I don't need this shit.
- Uh...

259
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,520
What?

260
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,760
- I... I do want your number.
- Oh, I'm sorry!

261
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,680
I don't know what... That was dumb.
I was saying something...

262
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,160
I thought you meant... Never mind. Yes. Yes.

263
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,120
Here's my phone number,
and here's my email.

264
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,120
- Email. That's...
- Yeah. That's funny.

265
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,880
- (Mauricio) Hello?
- Mudwhistle, get dressed. We're goin' out.

266
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,960
(* "Roy's Toy" byJeffBeck)

267
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,720
This Robbins guy gave you free therapy
while you were in the elevator?

268
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,840
Yeah. And then - check this out -

269
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,960
he does this thing to me where he makes it
so I can score better with the ladies.

270
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,080
At the time I thought it was a joke.

271
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,000
But this afternoon, the first
beautiful woman I saw went for me.

272
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,440
- Could be coincidence.
- Yeah, but no. This was different.

273
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,720
It was like she went crazy
for me or something.

274
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,320
I think maybe talking to him helped my
confidence, cos I do feel more confident.

275
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,640
Shit. Look who's here.

276
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
What's the matter?
You have a problem with Walt?

277
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,200
- You don't?
- No. Why would l?

278
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,960
- Don't you just get sick of it sometimes?
- Sick of what?

279
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,200
The whole "I walk on all fours
so I own the world" thing.

280
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,800
Plus all that phoney self-deprecating crap.

281
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,240
Jeez... Give the guy a break!
He's got spina bifida!

282
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,480
- He's just playing the hand he was dealt.
- Yeah. Here he comes.

283
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,760
- There's a couple of belt buckles I recognise.
- Hey, Walt. How you doin'?

284
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,640
Do I look like I have
anything to complain about?

285
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,520
Not if you don't mind
bunions on your knuckles.

286
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,920
I gotta go to the can.

287
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,600
- Hey, man, good to see ya.
- Good to see you.

288
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,280
- How you been?
- Good.

289
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,440
There's a pair of panties I recognise.
How ya doing, Deb?

290
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,560
OK, wise guy, what's it gonna be?

291
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,360
- How about a bottle of Dom for my buddy?
- Another? OK, you got it.

292
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,880
- And keep 'em coming.
- What's the occasion?

293
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,360
- You don't read the business section?
- What did I miss?

294
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,800
- I sold my company to Microsoft.
- Yeah? And you cleaned up?

295
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,600
Well, if I had an ass, I'd wipe it with twenties.

296
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,440
All right! Congratulations!

297
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,760
I'm officially retired and on the prowl.

298
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,680
- Hey, Walt.
- Hey, Sally.

299
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,760
I got a leash. Would you like
to take me for a walk?

300
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
Come on, boy.

301
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,280
Catch ya later.

302
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,400
Hi.

303
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,480
Hi.

304
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,320
- Hal.
- I'm Bella.

305
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,280
- So, what's up?
- Nothing.

306
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,440
- My friends are all out on the dance floor.
- Yeah?

307
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,040
- How come you're not spanking the planks?
- Spanking the planks! (snorts)

308
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,960
Are they your roommates, or...?

309
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,040
No, we work together
at the Foundation Fighting Blindness.

310
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,480
- Cool. I used to know a deaf guy.
- (snorts)

311
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,200
- Do you wanna dance?
- Yes!

312
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,520
All right.

turning at the end of the street

316

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,240
* Can't you hear me calling?

323
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,160
* Ooh, yeah

324
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,760
* Everybody's dancing

325
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,880
* Ooh, yeah

326
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,520
* Tonight everything is over

327
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,680
What in the name of all that is holy...?

328
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,720
* I can't lie on my bed
without thinking I was wrong

329
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,000
* But when that feeling calls...

330
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,880
- Do you need help?
- What? Come on!

331
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,520
* Night-time won't hold me in your arms again

332
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,280
* I got a very good friend who says

333
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,520
* He can't believe the love I give

334
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,320
* ls not enough to end your fears

335
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,800
* I guess I couldn't live without the things

336
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,400
* That made my life what it is

337
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,520
Hal?

338
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,000
It's ten o'clock. We gotta go.

339
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,240
- What are you talking about?
- Hal, we gotta go... do that thing.

340
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,600
- You know, at the place.
- What thing?

341
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,960
Hey, sorry, ladies.
I gotta steal your dance partner here.

342
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,280
- What are you doing?!
- I am rescuing you.

343
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
- From what?
- From what?!

344
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,320
From a pack of stampeding buffalo,
that's from what!

345
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,400
Come join us. I'm goin' after the redhead.
You can have your pick of the other two.

346
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,680
You mean you get the hyena, and I choose
between the hippo and the giraffe?

347
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,960
Don't be intimidated, man. They don't bite.
Let's go! I'm gettin' back in there.

348
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,520
Hey... go nuts.

349
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,600
* Tonight everything is over

350
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,800
* I feel too young

351
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Hey, Jill.

352
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,920
* Everybody's shaking...

353
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,440
Mauricio, it's Hal. Pick it up.

354
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,200
Look, man, I don't know what the hell
was the matter with you last night.

355
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,600
First you wouldn't dance with the hotties,

356
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,520
and then we go to the IHOP, and those hotties
are even hotter, and you disappear!

357
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,640
Oh, my...

358
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,120
I gotta call you back. Something came up.

359
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,800
(* "Toxic Girl" by Kings of Convenience)

360
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,200
* ln the sky the birds are pulling rain

361
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,720
* ln your life a curse has gota name

362
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,400
Building a parachute?

363
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,520
- Excuse me?
- They're a little big, aren't they?

364
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,760
Oh, I get it. You ripped the spinnaker
on your sailboat, right?

365
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,080
Sorry. It seemed so funny seeing someone
like you holding up a pair of old-lady trou.

366
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,560
Someone like me?

367
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,040
Yeah. You know, someone so fit.

368
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,040
You are a jackass.

369
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,360
Miss, please. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

370
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,440
Hey, unibrow, why don't you double
your dosage and leave me alone?

371
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,040
Whoa, whoa. Let's start over.
Look, that was really dumb of me.

372
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,160
You were probably buying 'em for
someone close to you, and I insulted them.

373
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,520
However you took it, I want you to know
I didn't mean to piss you off.

374
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,600
I wanted to meet you, and I guess...

375
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,480
I guess I'm not real smooth sometimes.

376
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,960
Let me make it up to you.

377
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,040
Excuse me, Miss. Is everything all right?

378
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,120
So, um... what do you do
for a living, Rosemary?

379
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,200
I'm actually volunteering
at the hospital right now,

380
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,000
cos I'm waiting for this...
re-up thing to come through.

381
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,160
Re-up? What, are you in the army?

382
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,480
- Peace Corps.
- Peace Corps. Wow.

383
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,080
That's very... altrudocious of you.

384
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,800
"Altrudocious"? That's not a word.

385
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,960
Oh! You mean humanidocious, right?

386
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,600
(chuckles)

387
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,520
- Yeah. That's the one.
- All right. Ready to order?

388
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Yeah. Um...

389
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,880
Can I get a double pizza burger, chilli fries
with cheese and a large chocolate milkshake?

390
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,480
Nicely done. I'll have the exact same thing.

391
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,200
You got it.

392
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,000
I am impressed.
It's nice to see a girl order a real meal.

393
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,880
I hate it when you guys order
a glass of water and a crouton.

394
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,480
It ruins the whole point of goin' out.

395
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,040
That's probably what I should be ordering.

396
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,960
But, I don't know, no matter what I eat,
my weight just seems to stay the same.

397
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,720
So I figure, what the hell?
I'm gonna eat what I want.

398
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,560
Totally. If you can get away with it,
more power to ya.

399
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,200
- Don't be a smart ass.
- What are you...? What?

400
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,240
No, I'm just saying, you know.

401
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,960
I feel bad for people who count calories.
It's no way to live.

402
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,480
Yeah. But in return they get to be
a lot thinner than I am.

403
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,480
Are you out of your mind?
What do you weigh? 110, 115 pounds?

404
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,760
Which one of my butt cheeks
are you talking about?

405
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,320
OK.

406
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

407
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,760
Trust me, whatever you're doin',
it's working. It is working.

408
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,200
Go on.

409
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,880
Oh, my God! Are you OK?

410
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,760
Oops.

411
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,560
- Goddang it.
- Don't move. Is your back all right?

412
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,560
- Yeah.
- Is she all right?

413
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,440
Yeah. You gotta get
some decent chairs in here, man.

414
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,840
What's this shit made out of, anyway?

415
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,640
Steel.

416
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,800
Yeah? Well, you should...
get it welded better in the corners!

417
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,760
- All right.
- Rosemary, you sure you're OK?

418
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,240
Yeah. I'm a little embarrassed but...
it's happened before, it'll happen again.

419
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,360
Oh, man. I...

420
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,240
Don't be embarrassed.
Listen, I beef it. Everybody beefs it.

421
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,800
Looks like we're too late.
The food's probably all gone.

422
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,400
- Listen, can you wait here one second?
- Hal, just let it go.

423
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,720
Nah. Nah.

424
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,000
Hal.

425
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
(mock laughter)

426
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,120
You guys are so funny, making fun of me
cos I'm a little pudgy, right?

427
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,000
- No, I wasn't making fun of you. I was...
- Do me a favour. Take a look out the window.

428
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,800
You see that little fox out there?
You see that little number? She's with me.

429
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:21,360
If you took all the women you two have ever
gone out with, they wouldn't equal one of her.

430
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,160
- We're not arguing that.
- No.

431
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
That's right. Laugh it up, fellas.

432
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,680
And tonight, when you're hugging
your pillow, remember, I'm with her.

433
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,880
All right? That's it.

434
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,520
What happened?

435
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,480
Well, let's just say the score's
Hal two, mall rats zero.

436
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,960
Let me walk you to your car.

437
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,920
- Well, thanks for lunch, Hal.
- My pleasure, Rosie.

438
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,880
- My mother calls me Rosie.
- Really?

439
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,320
Yeah.

440
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,720
Gentlemen, can I interest you
in some chilli fries and half a burger?

441
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,480
There's a lot left cos the little guy
couldn't finish his meal.

442
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,560
- Hey, hey.
- Pussy.

443
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,120
- That was nice of you.
- Well, you're all right in my book, too, Hal.

444
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,640
- Can I have your number?
- What number?

445
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,120
Your PIN number. I want your money(!)

446
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,880
Your phone number. What do you think?

447
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,280
Why?

448
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,360
You know, to... go out. Maybe, like, tomorrow.

449
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,400
Uh...

450
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,600
Well, yeah.

451
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,800
I mean, sure. It's in the book
under Rosemary Shanahan.

452
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,080
- I can write it down. It's S-h-a...
- No, I'll remember it.

453
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,000
- My boss's name is Steve Shanahan.
- That's my father's name.

454
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,960
Not JPS Steve Shanahan?

455
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,200
Your father is my boss. I mean,
not my boss, but he's my boss's boss.

457
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,840
I mean, I don't know him,
but I see him around the office.

458
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,760
Well, then you won't forget my name.

459
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
- Hal?
- Yeah?

460
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,600
If I don't hear from you...
I appreciate everything anyway.

461
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Cuckoo!

462
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,080
You sure you don't want a dog?

463
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,720
Yeah, yeah. I'm tryin' to lose a couple of LBs.

464
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,480
- Since when do you care about your gut?
- I don't really, but...

465
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,920
I am a little nervous because of
this girl who's coming to meet me.

466
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,000
- She's incredible.
- Uh-huh?

467
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,920
Like the ones on the dance floor?

468
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,040
Even better, buddy. I'm telling ya,
it's almost beyond belief.

469
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,200
She's funny, she's smart,
she teaches self-esteem to sick kids...

470
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,160
I would never believe a girl as beautiful
could have such a great personality.

471
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,440
- Ugly-duckling syndrome.
- What?

472
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,520
She probably wasn't pretty till high school.
The personality developed out of necessity.

473
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,560
You know what? I bet you're right.
She's way too pretty to be so nice.

474
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,880
Sometimes they're ugly so long,
when they turn pretty, they don't realise it.

475
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,120
The ugly self-image is so well ingrained.
That's a real find.

476
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,640
- Hey!
- Hey!

477
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
I've been looking for you.

478
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,200
Oh, shit. Oh, it's Lindy. The girl with the toe.

479
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,960
- Hey.
- How ya doing?

480
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,400
Good. Did you get my message?

481
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,640
No, no. My phone machine's
not really working there. Did you call?

482
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,560
- I got tickets for that Beatles reunion.
- The Beatles?

483
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,480
Yeah. Well, not the real Beatles,
but Paul, George and Ringo will be there.

484
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,120
But Eric Clapton is filling in for John.
It's an invitation-only acoustic set.

485
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,960
- Only about 70 people, tops.
- Oh, man.

486
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,480
- So you're in?
- Uh...

487
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,880
No. Not a Clapton fan.

488
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,040
I think I'll pass.

489
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,560
OK. Well, I guess I'll see ya.

490
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
- Yeah, yeah.
- Bye, Lindy.

491
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,920
- Did you see the toe?
- Mauricio, I gotta tell you, you got issues.

492
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,640
- Don't even get me started.
- Oh, my God. There she is.

493
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,640
There's Rosemary.

494
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,600
- Where?
- Right there.

495
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,560
- Right where?
- Straight ahead. Across the field.

496
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,400
- Is she behind the rhino?
- She's right there!

497
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,520
Mauricio, I want you to meet someone.

498
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,520
This is Rosemary Shanahan.
Rosemary, Mauricio Wilson.

499
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Hi. Nice to meet you.

500
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,040
Holy cow. I mean, uh... hi.

501
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,680
- Is that a Members Only jacket?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

502
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,920
So, what are you, like, the last member?

503
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,600
Oh, man.

504
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,920
- One-nothing Rosemary.
- (mobile phone)

505
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,560
Excuse me for just one second. Hello?

506
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,440
Oh, hi, Mom. Yeah, hold on.

507
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,600
- Will you guys excuse me?
- Want something from the snack bar?

508
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,960
Yeah, get me a beer
and nachos with all the stuff on it.

509
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
You got it.

510
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,520
- Does she take the cake or what?
- She takes the whole bakery, Hal.

511
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,840
- I told you.
- Yes, you did. And yet I wasn't prepared.

512
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,320
- So, what are you up for?
- I don't know. I like the track.

513
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,080
Ah, so she's a gambler.

514
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,480
Yeah, well, just the dogs.

515
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,800
I hate the ponies. There's too much
human involvement, you know?

516
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,440
You can't trust people
lf you're looking for a fair deal.

517
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,640
- What about you? Do you gamble?
- No, not really.

518
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,360
I bet on pro football now and then,
But just to make the games more exciting.

519
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,520
- I don't really care if I win.
- Huh.

520
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,600
- I've never read that book.
- What book?

521
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,040
Things Losers Say.

522
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,760
(Rosemary chuckles)

523
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,120
Hey, why don't we forget the track, and I'll
introduce you to some good friends of mine?

524
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,760
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

525
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,400
- All right.
- What do you say?

526
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,200
- I say OK.
- You say OK?

527
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,560
Hi, guys. I want you to meet
a very good friend of mine. OK?

528
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,200
This guy here is Hal. And he's really funny.

529
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Hi.

530
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
How ya doing? Good to meet ya.

531
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,640
Hey. Wow. Oh, my God. Look at that face.

532
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,760
She should be doing Keebler commercials.
You're the cutest thing I've ever seen.

533
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,760
- What's your name, beautiful?
- Cadence.

534
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,680
Cadence. That's a pretty name.
You know, my uncle's name is Cadence.

535
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,920
Well, I got news for you, Cadence.

536
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,040
I'm not putting you down
until the cows come home.

537
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,000
Put her down.

538
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,120
The cow came home.

539
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,560
What is he doing here?
These aren't visiting hours.

540
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,880
Oh, Nurse Peeler, we were just
coming by to say hi to the kids.

541
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,480
Fine. Pack it up.

542
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,120
And get these patients back in their beds.

543
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,800
(pager beeps)

544
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
- Should we get going?
- Don't pay any attention to Nurse Sourpuss.

545
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Sourpuss.

546
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,200
Hey! I got an idea. Do you guys
wanna play the kissing game?

547
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,320
- Yeah?
- You want me to go get a bottle?

548
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,720
This is how we play. Wanna get the lipstick?

549
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,600
- Get lipstick.
- Yeah, OK.

550
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,840
What we do is, we put on the lipstick...

551
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,480
and then the kisser kisses as many times
as they can until the lipstick comes off.

552
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,720
Cool! I wanna go first.

553
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,560
- Then I'm going last.
- Jesse.

554
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,520
- Hey, they don't have anything I can catch?
- They don't have anything you can catch.

555
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,480
I didn't think so.
You guys don't even look sick.

556
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,280
You're just a bunch of phoneys
like my Uncle Cadence.

557
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,840
I bet you're here just so you can
get out of school. Is that right?

558
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,720
- Yeah.
- Give me some of that lipstick.

559
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,400
You were incredible in there.
You were. You were so amazing.

560
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,040
I'm serious. A lot of people get
really squeamish in that situation...

561
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,680
- Rosemary? ls that you?
- Dr Sayed! How's it going?

562
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,560
- Good. Who's this?
- This is my friend Hal.

563
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,240
- Good to meet you.
- Be nice to her. She's a good girl.

564
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,120
- All right.
- Bye, Rosemary.

565
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,120
That's what these kids need -

566
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,160
a stranger who isn't afraid to just
be with them and play with them.

567
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,360
- That's what builds their self-confidence.
- Why would anybody be afraid of 'em?

568
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,600
You are off-the-charts adorable.
Do you know that?

569
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,000
Come on.

570
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,080
- This is a nice street you live on.
- Yeah, this is my street.

571
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,280
- You wanna come up?
- Yeah. But I don't think I should.

572
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,640
Why not? It's only 9 o'clock.

573
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,960
- I know. I just don't think it's a good idea.
- Oh, no. Did I do something?

574
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,040
No. You've been really cool.

575
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,880
- Hi, Hal.
- Oh, hey, Jill.

576
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,440
- Rosemary, this is my neighbour Jill.
- Hi. Nice...

577
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,400
- Sorry.
- Nice to meet you.

578
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Nice to meet you too, Jill.

579
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,600
I gotta go and meet some friends,
so I'll see you guys later.

580
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

581
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Come up.

582
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,920
- No.
- What?

583
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,080
I thought we were having a good time.

584
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,440
We were. It's just, you know,
Hal, I'm not used to all this.

585
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,040
Used to what?

586
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,880
Hal, you've been really nice to me today.
I really appreciate it, but...

587
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,640
What, your other boyfriends
aren't nice to you?

588
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,200
- I don't have other boyfriends.
- Bullshit.

589
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,920
Well, I had one boyfriend.

590
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,400
It was kind of recently,
actually, but it didn't work out.

591
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,920
- You've been burnt, huh?
- No.

592
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,840
That's just it. I, um... I've never been
close enough to anybody to get burnt.

593
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,840
Please! With a mug like that?
You must be fighting 'em off daily.

594
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,160
Right(!) I mean, I saw the way
your friend Mauricio looked at me.

595
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,600
I thought he was gonna shoot me
with a tranquilliser gun and tag my ear.

596
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,120
Don't worry. He's been acting really weird
lately, especially around really pretty girls.

597
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:01,280
Hal... do me a favour and stop saying
that I'm pretty and that I'm not fat, OK?

598
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,040
Cos it makes me uncomfortable.

599
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,200
OK. You have a problem with compliments?

600
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,400
Look... I know what I am
and I know what I'm not.

601
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,320
I'm the girl who gets really good grades
and is not afraid to be funny.

602
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,640
And I'm the girl who has a lot of friends
who are boys, and no boyfriends.

603
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,280
I'm not beautiful, OK? And I never will be.

604
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,160
And I'm fine with that. You know?

605
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,960
But when you go around saying
that I'm something that I'm not,

606
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,960
it's just... it's not nice.

607
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,560
Whoa, Rosemary.

608
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,800
You're starting to scare me.
I mean, I really like you,

609
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,280
but I have to assume you're a little nutty
if you really believe you're not beautiful.

610
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,200
Grow up, Hal.

611
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,680
Rosie. Wait a second.

612
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,120
Well, it was too good to be true.

613
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,640
Hm?

614
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,080
Rosemary. Turned out to be a total psycho.

615
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,400
Her self-image is so far off, it's scary.

616
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,440
Well, maybe you had a little
something to do with that.

617
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,840
What are you talking about? All I ever did
was tell her how perfect she was.

618
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,840
Really?

619
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,920
Yeah. Then she got all huffy
and told me to grow up.

620
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,120
Well, that's probably good advice.
You are kind of immature.

621
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,840
You're not serious. You actually
think you're more mature than me?

622
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:41,640
You're right. I'm probably more immature
than you, but at least I have a bigger willie.

623
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,520
Yeah, bigger than a mouse's.

624
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,240
- What the hell was that?
- I said your willie's...

625
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,560
I heard what you said,
but it took you, like, eight seconds.

626
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,120
You can't come back with a comeback after
eight seconds. You got three. Five, tops.

627
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,600
That's why they call it a quip. Not a "slowp".

628
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,360
All right, you got anything better to read?
I gotta fire off a missile.

629
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,680
(knock at door)

630
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,720
Hi.

631
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,960
- Is this a bad time, or...?
- No.

632
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,720
I just wanted to apologise for last night.

633
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,080
- You don't have to apologise.
- Yeah, I do.

634
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,960
I called you, like, immature or sophomoric
or something like that. I know you're not...

635
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,600
(Mauricio) Oh, my God, Hal!
You gotta get in here and look at this turd!

636
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,000
It looks just like Klinger from M*A*S*H.

637
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,640
- Why don't we get outta here?
- OK.

638
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,640
Coffee?

639
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,200
(* "Baby, Now That I've Found You"
by The Foundations)

640
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,840
Excuse me. Are you ready to order?

641
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,560
Yes. Two double cheeseburgers with bacon,
one with relish. Thank you.

642
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,680
(slurping)

643
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,360
Ow.

644
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,840
- Are you OK?
- Brain freeze.

645
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,720
* Baby, now that I've found you
I can't let you go

646
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,320
* I'll build my world around you

647
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,680
* I need you so, baby, even though...

648
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,280
Excuse me, sweetie. Professional.

649
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,680
Hey, Billy, stay over near the ladder.

650
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,360
Weak. So weak.

651
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,240
You wanna see a splash?
I'm gonna show you a splash. Ready?

652
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,880
* Spent a lifetime looking for somebody

653
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,640
* To give me love like you

654
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,680
* Baby, now that I've found you
I can't let you go...

655
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,560
- That was good?
- Bialy?

656
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,400
Bialy? Bialy? Billy!

657
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,600
Daddy!

658
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,920
Sorry.

659
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,000
- What's the matter?
- I should have changed at the beach.

660
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,960
What? Are you crazy? You look great.

661
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,840
I don't normally dress like this
around my parents.

662
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,080
Hey, hey, come on. I'm the one
who should be nervous here, not you.

663
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,920
Hey, you know, I've been meaning to ask you.
Were you adopted?

664
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,040
No. Why?

665
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,520
Cos your dad has that weird accent.

666
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,520
And I've seen him around the office. I gotta
say, I don't see the slightest resemblance.

667
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,920
Really? Everybody says lf you put
a wig on him, he'd look just like me.

668
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,800
(lrish accent) Look at who's here now.
Come here, my darlin'.

669
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,640
Hi, Daddy.

670
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,320
- Rosie, honey.
- Mom.

671
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,320
Good to see ya.

672
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,000
This is Hal Larson,
the guy I was telling you about.

673
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,520
- Great to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.

674
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,600
- Nice to meet you, Hal.
- The pleasure is mine, Mrs Shanahan.

675
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,320
Wow. I can see where
Rosemary gets her figure.

676
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,120
What the hell... What the hell
is that you've got on?

677
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,040
We were at the beach.

678
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,960
Won't you be putting
something else on, darlin'?

679
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,680
Oh, come on. She doesn't have to
do that for me. Let's just keep it casual.

680
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,200
Casual.

681
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:16,160
Hey, Dad, Hal's one of your great
untapped resources down at the company.

682
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,520
- Why don't you tell him some of your ideas?
- Oh, so you've got a few ideas, do ya?

683
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,880
It is risky, but the rewards are greater, too.

684
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,880
Only a company with a solid reputation
like JPS could ever market this product.

685
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,480
- Hal, let me take your plate.
- Thank you. It was delicious.

686
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,800
- Can I get you boys some coffee?
- I'd love a cup of tea, darlin'.

687
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,880
Maybe just a drop of the hard stuff.

688
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,800
Yeah, I'll just have a cup of joe.
That'd be great. Thanks.

689
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,160
I have to say, Hal,
I'm impressed with a lot of your ideas.

690
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,240
Some of them are dog shit, but for the most
part you seem to have done your homework.

691
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,720
- So I'd like you to do something for me.
- OK.

692
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,840
I'm meeting with me executive committee
Monday morning,

693
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,320
and I'd like you to make a presentation.

694
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,760
- Seriously?
- Well, nothing fancy, you understand.

695
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,400
Just talk about the same things
that you talked about here tonight.

696
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,240
Great. I'd love to.

697
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,840
Oh, and by the way,
you can cut out the act now.

698
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,560
Excuse me?

699
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,960
You think I got as far as I did
in me life by bein' a fool?

700
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,840
Now, you've got ambition,
Hal, and I admire that.

701
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,920
Hell, I wish I had a hundred
more like yourself.

702
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,320
We'd be the number one firm in the country.

703
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,240
And me daughter would get
a hell of a lot more dates.

704
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,320
I'm sure Rosemary doesn't have
any problem getting dates.

705
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,280
I told you to cut the shit out, all right?

706
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,080
Look, Rosemary's me daughter,
and God knows I love her dearly.

707
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,720
But I think we both know that we won't
soon be seeing her twirlin' the baton,

708
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,360
marching along with the Dallas cheerleaders.

709
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,000
Uh...

710
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,000
I don't understand.

711
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,920
I'm telling the truth, Hal.

712
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,200
And the truth is I haven't been able to bounce
me daughter on me knee since she was two.

713
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,760
You know, I've read about people like you.

714
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,560
- People like me?
- Super achievers with impossible standards.

715
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,520
Nothing's ever good enough.
Nothing ever measures up.

716
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,040
It never occurs to you that your kids
are people, with their own feelings.

717
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,200
You think they're an extension of you,
like your company,

718
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,320
or your $20-million Learjet
and your Picasso out in the front hall.

719
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,640
Everything reflects on you, so nothing
and no one is ever good enough.

720
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,720
Go on.

721
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,600
When I first met Rosemary, she told me
she knew she wasn't that good-looking.

722
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,120
I could not believe my ears.
I thought how can a person this beautiful

723
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,080
possibly interpret what she sees in the mirror
to be anything other than that?

724
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,200
Well, now I know.

725
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,640
Is everything OK?

726
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,880
Yeah, everything is fine. Just fine.

727
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,360
What?

728
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,320
Nothin'.

729
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,800
I just can't believe how lucky I am.

730
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,000
(* "This ls My World" by Darius Rucker)

731
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,480
You swear to God you're not gonna laugh?

732
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,200
Come on, I'm not gonna laugh.

733
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,800
(whimpers)

734
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,000
Oh.

735
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,840
Daddy like.

736
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,240
* The look on your face

737
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:08,360
* It could never explain your heart

738
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,920
* And the touch of my lips

739
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:19,600
* It could never tell you my thoughts

740
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,800
* And you want me to change

741
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,640
* I can't get used to...

742
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,560
What in the...? How did...?

743
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,440
Get over here, Houdini.

744
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,640
* Cos it's not really me

745
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:46,720
* This is my world, this is who I am
