00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:20,612
[calm music]

00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:30,589
[Damon] The tragedy
of life is not death.

5
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:33,358
For, there's honor in death.

6
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:38,931
Tragedy of life is what
we let die inside of us

7
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:39,832
while we live.

8
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:44,536
This land has nurtured our
people for generations.

9
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:47,539
This land is our mother.

10
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:50,042
It has given us life.

11
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:55,915
It has taught us to
walk, to grow, to hunt,

12
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:57,482
to love, to fight,

13
00:00:58,617 --> 00:01:00,285
to live and to die.

14
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:03,588
And when it was time to
pass from this world,

15
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,461
this land cradled our bones
and absorbed our souls.

16
00:01:12,464 --> 00:01:14,801
So many of our dearly
departed are buried here,

17
00:01:15,835 --> 00:01:16,869
right under our feet.

18
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:21,339
This was our pact with Mother
Earth,

19
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:25,577
from one generation to the
next, for years and years,

20
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:28,948
until until the white man came.

21
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,584
He came to this land,

22
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,688
a land vast enough to
accommodate many.

23
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:40,793
He came with the promise of
friendship.

24
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:43,796
He came with the promise of
peace.

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,599
With this understanding,

26
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:49,836
must one still welcomed the
uninvited.

27
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:59,078
Time has passed and the land has
received

28
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:02,014
many more of the uninvited.

29
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,684
But what the visitors never
understood

30
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:10,522
is that the bond between mother
and child is unbreakable,

31
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:14,894
irrespective of the circumstances
of their separation,

32
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,630
mother and child must be
together.

33
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,136
Time has passed, yeah, but for
my people,

34
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,105
time has also stood still.

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,407
Listen closely.

36
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,078
Can you hear it?

37
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:36,115
The trees.

38
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:38,084
The trees are calling.

39
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,551
Mother Earth is calling

40
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:44,991
It's time for her children
to come back home.

41
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,707

[door creaking]

48
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,273
Hey, how you feeling today?

49
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,808
Not one of my best days.

50
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:51,110
These medical bills really got
me worried.

51
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,812
I know.

52
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:53,645
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:54,914
I hate that you worry about
that.

54
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,018
You've done such a great
job taking care of me.

55
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:01,353
Your parents would be so proud
of you.

56
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:03,389
That means so much to me,
auntie.

57
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:05,958
I really wish I got a
chance to get to know them.

58
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,628
Hey, don't you be going and
saying goodbyes now, okay?

59
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,731
Okay.

60
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,233
I promise

61
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,667
I'll get us through this.

62
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:18,370
Okay?

63
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:19,271
Okay.

64
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,175
I'll be back tomorrow, Auntie.

65
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:28,180
Okay.

66
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:38,090

[party crowd yelling and
chattering]

69
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,416
Hey, has anyone seen Ricky?

70
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,085
Him and Laney went to take a
drive.

71
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:48,254
They said they'd be right back.

72
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:49,421
A drive, huh?

73
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:50,356
I guess that's what they're
calling it

74
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,857
after being apart for months.

75
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,893
My big bro has this Firebird in
park

76
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:56,095
and I bet all you guys

77
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,930
he's with Laney in the back
seat.

78
00:08:57,963 --> 00:08:58,797
[guy laughing]

79
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,498
Oh my God.

80
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,167
Guess that calls for another
beer.

81
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:04,870
[upbeat music]

82
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,821
It's supposed to be right
here.

83
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,457
Why is it so important to you?

84
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:26,358
Goddammit!

85
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,028
I said enough.

86
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:34,033
You know this thing's
nothing but bad luck.

87
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,503
Not sure why you want it so bad.

88
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,305
Oh, technically it isn't for you
right?

89
00:09:39,338 --> 00:09:40,506
It's for those Indians

90
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,208
at the casino on silver lake.

91
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:43,876
Those damn Cherokees

92
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,346
can't let sleeping dogs lie.

93
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,548
I say, leave the past in the
past.

94
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:50,916
What's done is done.

95
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:52,284
What is it with these Indians

96
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:53,919
and their Hocus Pocus bullshit?

97
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:54,953
Am I right?

98
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:56,622
[Damon] Keep digging.

99
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:58,324
I don't believe in that shit.

100
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:02,461
Do you really think
the ring is, is cursed?

101
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,097
Sorry, what's your name again?

102
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,568
That was a hell of a rodeo,
cowboy.

103
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:10,969
I missed you Laney.

104
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,137
I missed you too.

105
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:14,873
Best early Christmas present
ever.

106
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,109
You like that?

107
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:19,044
Just you wait until New Year's
Eve.

108
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,458
Hey, where are you going?

109
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:34,093
I gotta take a leak.

[mysterious music]

111
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:23,542
Did I tell ya?

112
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,644
What did I tell ya?

113
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:27,012
Wait 'til you get a load of
this.

114
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:28,414
It's a pretty sight.

115
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:32,017
[Damon] Where's the ring?

116
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,286
Wait, that's impossible.

117
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,355
Somebody must've taken it.

118
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:37,723
Nobody saw me down here.

119
00:11:37,757 --> 00:11:39,458
Nobody knew I was down here.

120
00:11:41,627 --> 00:11:43,495
I don't see it anywhere.

121
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:45,697
I swear it was in that box.

122
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:47,666
I'll find it.

123
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:50,035
I'll find it somehow.

124
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:51,336
I know it's gonna be here.

125
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:56,141
I know I fucked up, man, please.

126
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,209
Come on, please.

127
00:11:57,242 --> 00:12:00,379
Gimme a chance, gimme a
chance to find it for you.

128
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:01,246
No, please...

Trish, you're counting, honey?

Coming. I'm coming.

late.

No.

Good.

00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:10,830
Good luck, Trish.

156
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:11,964
Now you boys behave

157
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:13,933
and don't do anything I wouldn't
do.

158
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,871
Now, Chase, are you sure
you're going to be okay?

159
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:19,739
Of course.

160
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:21,673
Why wouldn't it be okay?

161

It's a big place, John.

162
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,911
It's a big responsibility.

You guys, I'm gonna be fine.

164
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,614
Just enjoy your weekend, okay?

165
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:32,284
Yeah. Mr and Mrs.
Larson have a great time

166
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:34,586
and I'll, I'll keep good...

167
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,422
I'll keep close, close,
close eye on Chase.

168
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:42,327
Chase, can I speak with
you privately for a minute?

169
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:44,964
Scram.

170
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,399
Now, listen son.

171
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:48,633
Yeah, dad?

172
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,003
I have no problem with your
friend here spending the night.

173
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:52,237
His name is Javon.

174
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:54,741
Right, Javon.

175
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:57,375
But just remember you're
the one in charge.

176
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:58,477
I know.

177
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,511
No funny business.

178
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:01,613
Make sure you lock up
everything before bed.

179
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,448
And then of course, no parties.

180
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,984
Who would I invite to a party?

181
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:05,818
Javon's pretty much

182
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:07,519
my entire social life at the
moment.

183
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:09,387
No one goes into my private
study.

184
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:13,358
Relax, I'm not gonna let
him in, it's off limits.

185
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:14,259
Good.

186
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:16,461
Yeah, have a good weekend.

187
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,329
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

188
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:20,365
Have a great time and Hey Mr.
Larson,

189
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:21,734
don't worry about a thing.

190
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:27,405
It is on bro.

191
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,010
Party at Liberty Manor!

192
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,246
Damn.

193
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:37,349
How have you never invited me
here before?

194
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,886
Oh, we should see if Adrianna
and Kayla

195
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,353
wanna come up here.

196
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:44,791
Yeah.

197
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:47,760
So which way is your dad's study
anyway?

198
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:50,328
Is that where he hides
all the good scotch?

199
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,733
In case you haven't heard his
study is totally off limits.

200
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,400
Why?

201
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,603
it's his little museum to this
place?

202
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:00,940
Liberty Manor was built on
some old Indian grounds.

203
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:03,009
So he keeps all the artifacts in
there.

204
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:06,344
[Javon] That's fucking dope.

205
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,348
Just remember, it's off
limits.

206
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,085
My dad would ground me for like
a month.

207
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,487
[Javon laughing]

208
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,688
Ground you?

209
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,824
Ground you?

210
00:18:17,857 --> 00:18:19,826
You're in college, homie.

211
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:21,326
Man up.

212
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:27,499
All right, so let me get this
straight.

213
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:30,368
So it's you,

214
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:35,908
your sister,

215
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,576
your parents

216
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:39,644
in this big ass house?

217
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:40,880
Pretty much.

218
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,815
We hire a few people
during the peak season,

219
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,483
but the rest of the time, it's
just us.

220
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:47,920
Oh, and Mr. Jenkins,
he's our groundskeeper.

221
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:51,123
Or, was our groundskeeper.

222
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:52,424
What happened to him?

223
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:53,259
We had to fire him.

224
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,393
He had a bad case of sticky
fingers.

225
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:57,529
That sucks.

226
00:18:57,562 --> 00:19:00,933
Yeah, just leaves us
and the Indian ghosts.

227
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,703
What, what, what?

228
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:06,973
The Indian ghosts.

229
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:09,574
You know, sometimes
you can hear him crying

230
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,843
out in the woods at night.

231
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:13,946
I'm just kidding.

232
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:18,017
Truthfully, it just comes
down to what you believe.

233
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,920
The developers of this estate
even found some remains

234
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:24,489
of an old burial ground right
over there.

235
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:25,224
Really?

236
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:26,859
- Yeah.
- That's fucking dope.

237
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:29,929
Not sure exactly what happened.

238
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:32,564
Over the trees though, am I
right?

239
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,699
Sometimes at night they tell the
story.

240
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:38,971
Cool, cool man.

241
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:40,773
Sweet, well, I'll, I'll tell
Eddie

242
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,574
to bring you some peyote

243
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:44,810
and we'll pay some respects.

244
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:45,677
Pay respects?

245
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,079
This is our land now.

246
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:50,682
It's been in my family for
generations.

247
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:52,617
Oh, well...

248
00:19:53,886 --> 00:19:55,922
Guess you're just gonna
have to smoke to that then.

249
00:19:57,056 --> 00:19:59,091
All right, let's get this
started here.

250
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:15,741
Yo, this place is dope!

251
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:18,510
Wow, this place is freaking
huge.

252
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:19,779
Thank you.

253
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,113
Where's the master?

254
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:22,514
Oh, that's my parent's room.

255
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:23,749
So, that one's gonna be off
limits.

256
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:26,085
Oh geez, don't be such a goody
guide.

257
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:28,520
Kayla, I'm sure there's
plenty of other rooms.

258
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:29,188
Lay off.

259
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:30,256
Fine.

260
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:33,092
Do you want me to bring
you down the hall, Becky?

261
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:33,960
Huh?

262
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:34,526
[Chase] I can show you to your
room?

263
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,995
[Becky] Yeah, thanks.

264
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:40,066
Yo. how many rooms they got?

265
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,667
I call dibs on this one.

266
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:45,137
[Eddie] This thing is huge.

267
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:49,075
Yo, this one's mine.

268
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:58,650
[cellphone buzzing]

269
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:02,922
Yeah?

270
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:04,824
David, I want an update.

271
00:21:06,658 --> 00:21:09,561
Now, Mr. Jenkins didn't honor
his word.

272
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:11,696
It's just a setback.

273
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:13,766
Don't let it ruffle your head
dress.

274
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,134
You better find it.

275
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,634
Don't come back without it.

276
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,228
[knocking on door]

277
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:47,565
Adrianna.

278
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,267
Hey Chase.

279
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:51,771
This house is amazing.

280
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:53,873
Finally, now the party can
start.

281
00:21:53,906 --> 00:21:55,808
Let's go put your stuff
away and pour a drink.

282
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:56,942
Sounds good to me,

283
00:21:56,976 --> 00:21:58,878
But chase, where's the master?

284
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:00,678
Oh, it's all the way
down the hall to the left.

285
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:01,347
I'll take you.

286
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,248
Okay.

287
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:06,718
[Chase] And it's just
right around the corner.

288
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:26,704
[mysterious music]

289
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:36,315
Here's the master.

290
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:38,751
Awesome, this worked
perfect, thanks Chase.

291
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:53,933
I'll be out in a minute, Chase.

292
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:55,633
Oh, right, sorry.

293
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:29,401
[upbeat pop music]

294
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:52,091
Yo, man, this party's off the
hook, dog.

295
00:23:52,124 --> 00:23:54,894
I dunno, you guys are
getting pretty loud.

296
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:55,794
Hey boys.

297
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,264
Hey girlfriend.

298
00:23:58,297 --> 00:23:59,932
Hello, Kayla.

299
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:01,767
Well, hello, Mr. Larson.

300
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:05,905
You need to loosen up a bit,
man.

301
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:07,339
I am.

302
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:08,440
Whatever, dog.

303
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:12,745
You're as uptight as a
camel's ass in a sand storm.

304
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:15,080
Wow, Chase, this place is
amazing.

305
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:16,849
I just love the architecture.

306
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:18,984
The ceiling is mahogany, right?

307
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:20,119
I guess so.

308
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:23,989
Great, what were you saying?

309
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:25,357
One large pepperoni pizza.

310
00:24:25,391 --> 00:24:26,859
Is that cool with everybody?

311
00:24:26,892 --> 00:24:27,993
Hell yeah.

312
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:31,964
So what do you want from me?

313
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:36,435
I want you to have
fun at your own party.

314
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:40,973
Javon, I don't think that's...

315
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:42,441
Listen, look man, look, look.

316
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,879
You gotta, you gotta talk
to the people, you know?

317
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:47,846
Look at that vibe.

318
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,383
Socialize, mingle, you know?

319
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:56,155
Have you said anything to anyone
today?

320
00:24:56,188 --> 00:24:57,056
[indistinct]

321
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:58,324
That's what I'm saying.

322
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:00,725
What do you think I should do?

323
00:25:03,963 --> 00:25:05,097
Excuse me, excuse me.

324
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,865
Can I get everybody's attention
please?

325
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:08,267
Real quick, right up here, yo!

326
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,236
Can I just get a quick round
of applause for my man,

327
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:12,504
Chase Larson for opening up his
house

328
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:14,039
and for throwing this little
shindig.

329
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:15,174
Give it up for him, y'all.

330
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:18,110
[cheering and applause]

331
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,012
Now, I bet a lot of you didn't
notice,

332
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:23,249
but my man Chase, he's a mad
Magician.

333
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:25,384
Yeah, nah, shut up, I got you.

334
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:27,353
Yeah, his routine is dope.

335
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:28,921
Yeah, he could do anything.

336
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:31,090
And I mean anything.

337
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:35,227
Yo, Magic Man, make
Kayla's bra disappear.

338
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:38,063
You wish.

339
00:25:38,097 --> 00:25:40,099
All right, all right, settle
down, y'all, settle down.

340
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:44,503
Now, I'm about to introduce
the magician on a mission.

341
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:47,406
The one and only, Chase Larson.

342
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:49,074
Give it up for Chase.

343
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:50,209
Yo, come on man.

344
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:51,443
Come on, y'all show him some
love guys.

345
00:25:51,477 --> 00:25:52,111
Show him some love.

346
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:54,146
Come on man, let's go, dog.

347
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,382
Show the people something, man.

348
00:25:56,415 --> 00:25:57,349
Let's go.

349
00:25:57,383 --> 00:26:00,286
Yeah, show him some love, come
on, y'all.

350
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,987
Cheer him on, yeah!

351
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:04,890
You got this man, you got this,
dog.

352
00:26:04,923 --> 00:26:05,824
Show me some love.

353
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:14,033
Good evening, my friends.

354
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:16,935
I really only have one
question for you tonight.

355
00:26:17,636 --> 00:26:19,471
Do you believe in magic?

356
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:21,373
[all laughing]

357
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:23,876
Magic is no laughing matter.

358
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,978
The land you're on right now,

359
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,480
the earth beneath your feet,

360
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:31,517
the Liberty Manor Estate
resides on hallowed ground.

361
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:34,053
It belonged to an ancient Indian
tribe

362
00:26:34,086 --> 00:26:35,854
that believed in magic.

363
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,023
They believed in the spirit
gods,

364
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:40,893
that they used magic to rule
the heavens and the earth.

365
00:26:40,926 --> 00:26:43,996
That magic could turn life into
death

366
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:46,899
as easily as it could turn day
into night.

367
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:47,966
Oh, shit.

368
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,936
[group chattering]

369
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:53,105
The Indians also believed

370
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:55,341
that every soul is a light

371
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:01,380
and that light will only
continue to burn

372
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:04,950
as long as you believed
in the power of magic

373
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:08,620
for belief in magic is a
belief in the sanctity of life.

374
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:23,435
But if you don't believe in
magic and you lose faith,

375
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,473
well, it's only a matter
of time before the light

376
00:27:27,506 --> 00:27:32,311
in your soul begins to burn up.

377
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:38,951
[applause and cheering]

378
00:27:38,984 --> 00:27:41,120
That's my boy, I know him, I
know him.

379
00:27:41,153 --> 00:27:41,821
Get over here, man.

380
00:27:41,855 --> 00:27:43,489
That was as cool as football.

381
00:27:43,522 --> 00:27:44,390
[Chase] Thank you.

382
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:48,394
Dude, bro, great job.

383
00:27:48,427 --> 00:27:49,395
Thank you.

384
00:27:49,428 --> 00:27:50,062
Great job.

385
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:55,100
Now it time to get some pussy.

386
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:57,936
[Chase laughing]

387
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:03,075
[Becky] Okay, Chase, we get
it.

388
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:05,344
[Adrianna] All right, Magic
Man, lights back on please.

389
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:07,446
[Eddie] Watch out guys, what
was that?

390
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,614
[Becky] Oh my God,
there's something outside.

391
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,115
[Kayla] Dude, what the fuck?

392
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:11,150
Did you see that?

393
00:28:11,183 --> 00:28:12,451
[Eddie] Yeah, what was that?

394
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:13,452
[Adrianna] Chase, this isn't
like,

395
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,320
this isn't cool anymore
dude, like seriously.

396
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:16,455
[Kayla] Yeah, Chase come on.

397
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:17,556
[Eddie] Kinda scared.

398
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,225
[Chase] I didn't do that.

399
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:25,230
Chase, like that was really
not funny.

400
00:28:25,264 --> 00:28:26,365
Yeah, not cool.

401
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:28,634
Javon, that wasn't me.

402
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,536
I didn't turn them off.

403
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:32,538
[Javon] Whatever man, you're
tripping.

404
00:28:34,306 --> 00:28:35,707
Wow, will you look at this?

405
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:38,477
What?

406
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,280
Well, according to this map,

407
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:44,416
not only was the manor
built on Indian property,

408
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,187
but right on top of an
Indian burial ground.

409
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,221
So what?

410
00:28:49,254 --> 00:28:50,088
So what?

411
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:52,191
You don't find that the least
bit odd?

412
00:28:52,224 --> 00:28:54,326
That out of all the property

413
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,061
that they could have built this
manor on,

414
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:59,531
they built it smack on top of a
graveyard.

415
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:01,200
Okay, that's creepy.

416
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,235
That's disrespectful is what
that is.

417
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:04,536
They did it on purpose.

418
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,404
What?

419
00:29:05,437 --> 00:29:06,605
Why would they do that?

420
00:29:06,638 --> 00:29:08,540
To show the Indians that
they're no longer wanted here.

421
00:29:08,574 --> 00:29:10,142
That they no longer matter.

422
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:11,610
Damn straight.

423
00:29:11,643 --> 00:29:12,611
Eddie.

424
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:13,679
What?

425
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:14,747
It's the truth ain't it?

426
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:16,749
It's just like football.

427
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:20,118
You don't wanna just win,
you wanna destroy them.

428
00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:21,553
You wanna embarrass them.

429
00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:24,189
That way they never want a
rematch.

430
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,758
And this is why we broke up.

431
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,392
It's the law of the jungle.

432
00:29:27,426 --> 00:29:30,262
Kill or be killed.

433
00:29:30,295 --> 00:29:31,597
God, you're such an asshole.

434
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,732
What?

435
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:34,600
Yeah, I wouldn't say
you're like a full on asshole

436
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:37,102
but you're kind of an asshole.

437
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:39,438
Yeah, you are, you are.

438
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:40,606
What'd I do?

439
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:43,642
I'm not the one who turned the
lights off.

440
00:29:54,854 --> 00:29:56,655
Oh, whoa, yo, check this out.

441
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:58,390
Hey, Javon.

442
00:29:58,423 --> 00:29:59,792
Yo.

443
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:00,793
Yo.

444
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:03,595
Yo, guys, look at this,
this is dope as hell.

445
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:06,231
Javon, we really
shouldn't be in this room.

446
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:07,366
Yeah, now I know why.

447
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:08,835
Yo, guys come in here.

448
00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:09,802
Look at this.

449
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:12,504
Wow, this room is incredible.

450
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,541
[Eddie] Man, this shit is
tight.

451
00:30:15,574 --> 00:30:17,709
[Chase] Everyone, we really
need to get outta here.

452
00:30:17,744 --> 00:30:19,244
This room is off limits.

453
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:21,014
Guys, take a look at this
ring.

454
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:24,349
[Becky] So unbelievable.

455
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:27,152
Such a rich history this culture
has.

456
00:30:27,185 --> 00:30:30,857
Yeah and this is all that's
left of it.

457
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,991
Listen to this.

458
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:34,626
Apparently that ring belonged
to an Indian princess

459
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,627
named Aiyana.

460
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:38,263
Who gave it to her?

461
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:39,766
Well, according to this, a
white man

462
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:40,900
named Samuel Cook.

463
00:30:40,934 --> 00:30:43,669
He was a union soldier and
he wanted to marry Aiyana.

464
00:30:44,536 --> 00:30:45,738
That's really romantic.

465
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:48,775
Not everybody thought so.

466
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:51,143
Her father, Chief Dohate,

467
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:54,479
he forbade the union
saying that the marriage

468
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:56,415
would bring great shame to his
people.

469
00:30:57,449 --> 00:30:58,751
[Adrianna] Aiyana married him
anyways?

470
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,185
She did.

471
00:31:00,853 --> 00:31:02,889
And her father Chief Dohate

472
00:31:02,922 --> 00:31:05,557
in return declared war on the
locals.

473
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:08,193
War on the locals, what
does that really even mean?

474
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:11,731
Well, he cut off Cook's head

475
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:14,132
and then he scalped several
other soldiers

476
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,735
and then killed his own
daughter.

477
00:31:15,768 --> 00:31:19,772
Cut off her hand and
claimed the ring as his own.

478
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:21,607
[Adrianna] That's horrible.

479
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,442
It doesn't end there either.

480
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:25,344
A lot more of the tribe
was killed after that

481
00:31:25,377 --> 00:31:27,346
by the white men in retaliation,

482
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:28,614
they had overwhelming firepower.

483
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:29,481
What was that?

484
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,349
Did you see that?

485
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:32,551
Something just moved outside the
window.

486
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:34,720
Ooh, someones scared.

487
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:36,455
Relax, Kayla, there's nobody
out there.

488
00:31:36,488 --> 00:31:38,624
Anyway, Chief Dohate was
captured

489
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:41,259
and brought before a
council of union soldiers.

490
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:42,729
He was charged with the
incitement

491
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:44,529
of many people in mass murder.

492
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:47,366
He was hung right here on this
very site.

493
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,334
With the noose fitted around his
neck,

494
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,303
he muttered some words
in an ancient dialect

495
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:54,272
that apparently cast an
eternal curse on that ring

496
00:31:54,306 --> 00:31:56,541
and all of those who
inhabit this sacred land.

497
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:58,577
You don't actually believe

498
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,712
this ring is a curse though, do
you?

499
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:04,182
Well, he was hung on this very
spot

500
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,253
and according to legend his
ghost

501
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:09,521
and the ghosts of all the
slaughtered

502
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,256
still haunt these very woods.

503
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:13,258
It's true.

504
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:15,527
[Adrianna] What's true?

505
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,195
It's true.

506
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:19,464
Sometimes if you're very quiet,

507
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:24,236
you can hear the noises of
the woods penetrate the night.

508
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,405
It's probably just the wind

509
00:32:26,438 --> 00:32:31,443
but sometimes it really sounds
like an Indian drum beat.

510
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:34,379
Soft and low.

511
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,882
It's kind of creepy.

512
00:32:37,683 --> 00:32:39,317
Chief Dohate on the warpath.

513
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:45,792
All right.

514
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:49,594
Let's just, let's take a break
from the stories right now.

515
00:32:49,628 --> 00:32:51,663
How about we have some pizza,
right?

516
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:52,631
Let's have some pizza.

517
00:32:52,664 --> 00:32:53,565
Yeah, yeah.

518
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,599
Yeah.

519
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:56,736
Let's do that, all right.

520
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:01,239
[Addie] Fucking hell, what the
fuck?

521
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:13,318
[upbeat music]

522
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,558
Chase, are you checking me
out?

523
00:33:19,591 --> 00:33:20,459
[all laughing]

524
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:21,326
[Chase] What?

525
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,962
No, no way.

526
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:26,531
It's okay, it happens all the
time.

527
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,541
[girls cheering]

528
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,746
All right guys, I think
I'm gonna go check on Eddie

529
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,647
and make sure he didn't
set the forest on fire?

530
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:43,750
You want me to go with you?

531
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:44,851
That's okay.

532
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:46,052
I think you should stay
here and work on your game.

533
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:47,719
You know what I mean.

534
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,532
I think I'm gonna make sure
Adrianna doesn't get lost.

535
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:01,399
Bye boys.

536
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:02,300
See ya.

537
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:05,637
Did you see that?

538
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:07,305
Adrianna?

539
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,407
See me make a total ass of
myself?

540
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:11,844
You totally did not
pick up on the clues, man.

541
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:12,845
She's into you.

542
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,546
[Chase] Really?

543
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:17,616
Are you both clueless
like, like that clueless?

544
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:19,584
Adrianna just likes taunting you

For many years, this family
has harmed and humiliated

726
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:34,546
the heritage of the native
Americans that belong here.

727
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,448
And one day they're going to
pay!

728
00:47:39,284 --> 00:47:40,853
What is that?

729
00:47:40,887 --> 00:47:42,521
What exactly is that, what did
you do?

730
00:47:42,554 --> 00:47:43,355
Who's out there?

731
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:44,690
We didn't do anything, I don't
know

732
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:47,693
We didn't do anything, I don't
know.

733
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:56,134
[siren sounding]

734
00:48:10,883 --> 00:48:11,851
Good evening.

735
00:48:11,884 --> 00:48:14,152
Is there something I can
help you with, Officer?

736
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:15,487
Well, the Larson's asked me to
come here

737
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,688
and check on Chase.

738
00:48:16,722 --> 00:48:17,689
Is he here?

739
00:48:17,723 --> 00:48:20,292
Well, he probably is
around here somewhere.

740
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:21,593
I can, I can go look for him.

741
00:48:21,627 --> 00:48:24,463
By the way, Mr. Greene,
the new grounds keeper.

742
00:48:24,496 --> 00:48:25,932
Oh, there's a new grounds
keeper?

743
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:27,100
Oh yeah.

744
00:48:27,132 --> 00:48:29,668
I didn't realize they had
anybody since Mr. Jenkins.

745
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:30,569
Oh yeah.

746
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,339
I think he's at the tennis
courts, I can get him.

747
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:36,708
No that's okay, thanks anyway.

748
00:48:36,743 --> 00:48:38,878
I can see Mr. Greene has
everything under control here.

749
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,278
You guys have a good night.

750
00:48:40,312 --> 00:48:41,413
Yeah, I do.

751
00:48:41,446 --> 00:48:43,916
I'm gonna get going too, yeah.

752
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:44,616
You kid's behave.

753
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,652
Yeah, okay, we will, we will.

754
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:50,790
[car engine revving]

755
00:49:08,908 --> 00:49:10,242
Oh, wow.

756
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:13,445
Put this back.

757
00:49:15,347 --> 00:49:17,182
Oh, no way!

758
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:21,253
I always wanted to try one of
these on.

759
00:49:24,656 --> 00:49:27,459
Oh goodness, I need a weapon.

760
00:49:28,928 --> 00:49:32,698
Oh, look at this.

761
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:43,575
Eddie's on a war path.

762
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:48,313
[Eddie yelling Indian chants]

763
00:49:48,346 --> 00:49:49,514
Oh, gosh.

764
00:49:54,821 --> 00:49:58,256
What's so special about
this damn ring anyways?

765
00:49:59,391 --> 00:50:03,830
I'm Chief Dohate and I curse
this ring.

766
00:50:03,863 --> 00:50:04,997
Anybody that touches it

767
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:07,532
and I'll cut your damn hand off.

768
00:50:12,038 --> 00:50:13,338
Who was that?

769
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:17,009
Yo, Chase, was that you?

770
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:18,845
Yo, Chase.

771
00:50:18,878 --> 00:50:20,612
Man, where is everybody?

772
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:30,288
[owls hooting]

773
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:38,330
Dude, this place creeps
me the fuck out, bro.

774
00:50:38,363 --> 00:50:39,866
I told you, you can hear the
crying

775
00:50:39,899 --> 00:50:41,366
out in the woods sometimes.

776
00:50:51,911 --> 00:50:53,712
[Javon] Dude, cut it out.

777
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:55,714
[Chase] I'm trying
to get the lights back.

778
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,906
Javon, are you okay?

779
00:51:23,575 --> 00:51:24,442
Yeah.

780
00:51:25,978 --> 00:51:26,846
Yeah.

781
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:29,816
Let's get the fuck out of here,
man.

782
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:33,953
[fire crackling]

783
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:44,130
Hey dudes!

784
00:51:44,163 --> 00:51:46,398
Get your asses over here.

785
00:51:46,431 --> 00:51:48,333
This peyote's not gonna smoke
itself.

786
00:52:06,484 --> 00:52:09,822
Yo, can I please have some of
that?

787
00:52:09,856 --> 00:52:10,655
Of course, bro.

788
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:12,657
Yo, this place is freaking me
out.

789
00:52:12,691 --> 00:52:15,660
Eddie, where are Adrianna and
Kayla?

790
00:52:15,694 --> 00:52:17,129
We thought they were with you.

791
00:52:17,163 --> 00:52:19,031
They were with me earlier.

792
00:52:19,065 --> 00:52:20,099
You know what I mean?

793
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,667
Such a gentlemen.

794
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:26,105
Hey, have you guys been Kayla?

795
00:52:26,138 --> 00:52:27,740
I can't find her anywhere.

796
00:52:27,773 --> 00:52:28,640
No.

797
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:32,044
I didn't think you'd be
wanting to see her for a while.

798
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:33,145
Okay, asshole.

799
00:52:34,814 --> 00:52:37,449
She's drunk and have you
actually [indistinct] her.

800
00:52:38,217 --> 00:52:40,019
Maybe she's with Becky
somewhere.

801
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,154
No, she's not with me,

802
00:52:42,188 --> 00:52:45,157
but you know, I gotta go
decompress, so

803
00:52:46,092 --> 00:52:47,793
I'll look for her while I'm
gone.

804
00:52:49,095 --> 00:52:49,962
Okay.

805
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:54,166
Ooh, beer, beer?

806
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,034
Yes.

807
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:56,102
Yes.

808
00:52:56,135 --> 00:52:56,936
Gotcha.

809
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:58,703
You don't need to worry about
me.

810
00:52:58,738 --> 00:52:59,638
Yes, leave this here.

811
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:04,010
Do you think she went
to the tennis court?

812
00:53:04,043 --> 00:53:05,978
I truthfully don't know.

813
00:53:06,012 --> 00:53:08,680
When did you see her last?

814
00:53:08,713 --> 00:53:10,016
I mean, it's been a while.

815
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,451
[Chase] When we were
in the bowling alley.

816
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:15,121
I haven't seen her
since she was with me.

817
00:53:17,957 --> 00:53:20,826
[Javon whistling]

818
00:53:30,169 --> 00:53:33,172
[suspenseful music]

819
00:53:46,752 --> 00:53:49,621
[Javon whistling]

820
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:04,971
[Damon] You never know when
the devil can come calling.

821
00:54:23,956 --> 00:54:26,759
[Damon laughing]

822
00:54:35,633 --> 00:54:38,170
[Javon choking]

823
00:55:00,326 --> 00:55:01,193
Javon.

824
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:10,202
Where the hell are you?

825
00:55:26,786 --> 00:55:29,021
So Chase, what's your
favorite type of magic?

826
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:30,923
Well, my favorite type is card
magic.

827
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:34,692
But specialty is making
things appear and disappear.

828
00:55:35,361 --> 00:55:37,096
How did you do that?

829
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:38,330
Let's try something a little
bit harder.

830
00:55:38,364 --> 00:55:39,198
Okay.

831
00:55:39,231 --> 00:55:40,199
So, now you can see

832
00:55:40,232 --> 00:55:41,867
we've got a lot of
different options, right?

833
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:43,135
A lot of different options.

834
00:55:43,169 --> 00:55:44,236
Uh, huh?

835
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:47,807
So, I'm gonna have you
pick out two instead of one.

836
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,808
I'm gonna have you pick out two.

837
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:49,875
Okay.

838
00:55:49,909 --> 00:55:51,877
All I want you to do is
just hold up one finger.

839
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:52,745
[Adrianna] Okay.

840
00:55:52,778 --> 00:55:53,245
You can just drop it down on any
card.

841
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:54,280
[Adrianna] Sure.

842
00:55:54,313 --> 00:55:55,281
Got it, okay.

843
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:56,882
Take that one and take
the one next to it too.

844
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:58,317
[Adrianna] Okay, do you wanna
see it?

845
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,252
Sure, which ones do you have?

846
00:56:00,286 --> 00:56:03,389
So, four of diamonds and 7 of
clubs.

847
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:05,825
Four diamonds and a seven of
clubs.

848
00:56:05,858 --> 00:56:09,361
Now these two cards,
could I use your sleeve?

849
00:56:09,395 --> 00:56:10,262
Sure.

850
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:12,131
Okay, like that, perfect.

851
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:12,832
I'm gonna take these two,

852
00:56:12,865 --> 00:56:16,035
and put them right inside there.

853
00:56:16,068 --> 00:56:17,303
[Adrianna] Okay.

854
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:18,838
Okay, now with your other
hand,

855
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:21,340
can you take out one and
leave the other one inside?

856
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,311
Let's see which one you got?

857
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:26,178
[Adrianna] Four of diamonds.

858
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:27,980
Four of diamonds.

859
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:28,646
So what was the other one?

860
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,714
[Adrianna] Seven of clubs.

861
00:56:29,748 --> 00:56:30,850
Seven of clubs.

862
00:56:30,883 --> 00:56:32,184
Watch the four diamonds.

863
00:56:32,218 --> 00:56:35,054
One, two, three.

864
00:56:36,222 --> 00:56:37,389
Looks like the seven of clubs.

865
00:56:37,423 --> 00:56:38,257
What?

866
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,159
Did you just switch those?

867
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:41,060
Check inside.

868
00:56:43,062 --> 00:56:44,997
[Adrianna] Okay, that's
insane.

869
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,298
Seriously.

870
00:56:46,332 --> 00:56:47,665
But that's not my specialty.

871
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:48,334
[Adrianna] Okay?

872
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:49,235
I said that my specialty

873
00:56:49,268 --> 00:56:52,905
was making things appear and
disappear.

874
00:56:52,938 --> 00:56:55,074
Watch this seven of
clubs, it just disappears.

875
00:56:55,107 --> 00:56:55,941
Like that.

876
00:56:55,975 --> 00:56:57,243
Seven to clubs is gone.

877
00:56:57,276 --> 00:56:57,943
Oh my God.

878
00:56:57,977 --> 00:56:59,812
Not just the seven of clubs.

879
00:57:00,479 --> 00:57:04,750
Also, the entire deck has
disappeared.

880
00:57:04,783 --> 00:57:06,718
All right, that was seriously
amazing.

881
00:57:06,752 --> 00:57:08,287
I don't understand how
you did any of that.

882
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,023
Really crazy.

883
00:57:11,056 --> 00:57:12,224
Remember, if you make a card,

884
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:13,926
like the seven of clubs
disappear,

885
00:57:13,959 --> 00:57:15,895
you've always got to
make it reappear, right?

886
00:57:15,928 --> 00:57:16,562
Right?

887
00:57:16,595 --> 00:57:18,063
Check back in your sleeve.

888
00:57:23,969 --> 00:57:25,304
I don't even know what to say.

889
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:28,140
Okay, now you gotta spill all
the beans

890
00:57:28,174 --> 00:57:29,909
and tell me exactly how you did
that.

891
00:57:29,942 --> 00:57:30,776
I can't tell you.

892
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:31,477
You have to.

893
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:34,346
Wow, okay then.

894
00:57:35,514 --> 00:57:36,448
That was amazing.

895
00:57:36,482 --> 00:57:38,384
I don't know how you
did any of that stuff.

896
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:41,353
Seriously, it's crazy.

897
00:57:41,387 --> 00:57:44,190
Hey, you guys, did Javon come
in yet?

898
00:57:44,223 --> 00:57:46,992
No, we haven't seen him.

899
00:57:47,026 --> 00:57:49,862
Weird, he wasn't outside.

900
00:57:49,895 --> 00:57:50,930
That is weird.

901
00:57:52,164 --> 00:57:53,732
Okay, magic man.

902
00:57:53,766 --> 00:57:55,100
Enough with the tricks.

903
00:57:55,134 --> 00:57:56,435
What are you talking about?

904
00:57:56,468 --> 00:57:59,104
Making things disappear and
reappear.

905
00:57:59,138 --> 00:58:01,874
You really had me freaked out at
first.

906
00:58:01,907 --> 00:58:02,942
No matter how many times
I take off this ring,

907
00:58:02,975 --> 00:58:06,312
it just magically keeps
ending up back on my hand.

908
00:58:06,345 --> 00:58:08,047
Adrianna, I swear I didn't do
that.

909
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,114
Right.

910
00:58:09,148 --> 00:58:10,916
I don't even know how
to do something like that.

911
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,152
You're good, I just watched
it.

912
00:58:13,185 --> 00:58:15,221
It's the ring, it's chosen
you.

913
00:58:15,254 --> 00:58:17,790
What the hell are you
talking about, Becky?

914
00:58:17,823 --> 00:58:19,258
Well, according to ancient
legend,

915
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:22,194
if the ring ever wound up
back with the white men

916
00:58:22,228 --> 00:58:25,364
it would find its way back
through her native bloodstream.

917
00:58:25,397 --> 00:58:26,966
Okay, all of that, that you're
reading,

918
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:28,500
it's just Hocus Pocus bullshit.

919
00:58:28,534 --> 00:58:30,035
None of that's even true.

920
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:31,303
Also, I'm only part Native
American.

921
00:58:31,337 --> 00:58:32,972
It just has to be in your
bloodstream.

922
00:58:33,005 --> 00:58:34,773
When you put the ring on you
activated it.

923
00:58:34,807 --> 00:58:37,376
Okay, enough with this
damn book already, seriously.

924
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,078
Adrianna's right.

925
00:58:39,111 --> 00:58:40,012
We're getting ahead of
ourselves.

926
00:58:40,045 --> 00:58:41,947
Let's just try and find Javon
and Kayla.

927
00:58:41,981 --> 00:58:44,950
Yeah, that sounds like a plan
to me.

928
00:58:46,518 --> 00:58:47,353
[Becky] Okay, Chase.

929
00:58:47,386 --> 00:58:49,888
I didn't turn them off.

930
00:58:49,922 --> 00:58:52,925
[suspenseful music]

931
00:59:22,921 --> 00:59:23,789
Kayla?

932
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:47,332
[Adrianna screaming]

933
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:52,538
Get it off me!

934
01:01:52,571 --> 01:01:54,039
Just get it off!

935
01:01:58,043 --> 01:02:01,046
[Adrianna screaming]

936
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:05,250
Hey, listen.

937
01:02:05,284 --> 01:02:07,553
I'm sure there's an
explanation for all of this.

938
01:02:07,586 --> 01:02:08,387
Oh, like what Eddie?

939
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,122
Where the hell is Kayla and
Javon?

940
01:02:10,155 --> 01:02:11,190
I don't know.

941
01:02:11,223 --> 01:02:13,091
They're probably out
messing around in the woods.

942
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:14,226
You know Kayla.

943
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:16,094
Okay, so what's your
explanation for this damn ring

944
01:02:16,128 --> 01:02:18,263
which I can't even get off my
finger now.

945
01:02:18,297 --> 01:02:20,365
All right, everyone,
let's just calm down.

946
01:02:20,399 --> 01:02:23,001
We'll figure this out together.

947
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:24,603
You know, you seem a little
too calm

948
01:02:24,636 --> 01:02:26,371
if you ask me, Chase.

949
01:02:27,439 --> 01:02:29,508
What are you talking about,
Eddie?

950
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,210
What, you think you can scare
Adrianna

951
01:02:31,243 --> 01:02:33,412
with all your magic bullshit?

952
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:35,714
So you can just be the
hero that saves her?

953
01:02:37,082 --> 01:02:38,684
You're getting out of line
here.

954
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:39,585
Am I?

955
01:02:41,353 --> 01:02:42,588
Or do I have it all right?

956
01:02:44,656 --> 01:02:46,592
What are you doing, man?

957
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,126
Eddie, just please calm down.

958
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,029
No, I won't calm down.

959
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:53,198
If you do anything else to scare
her,

960
01:02:53,232 --> 01:02:54,600
I swear to God.

961
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:56,268
Okay, Eddie, just stop it.

962
01:02:56,301 --> 01:02:57,703
This is not helping anybody.

963
01:03:00,372 --> 01:03:01,707
I warned you.

964
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:04,243
All right, you guys look,

965
01:03:04,276 --> 01:03:05,244
I don't know about you,

966
01:03:05,277 --> 01:03:07,112
but I really could just
use a drink right now

967
01:03:07,145 --> 01:03:09,147
just to calm my nerves down.

968
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:10,148
Come on, babe.

969
01:03:10,817 --> 01:03:12,785
Let's go back by the fire back.

970
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:15,354
I'm sure Javon and Kayla are
back by now.

971
01:03:24,162 --> 01:03:27,232
[sharp horror music]

972
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:25,290
Chief Dohate cut off
his own daughter's hand.

973
01:04:26,425 --> 01:04:27,492
What a royal asshole

974
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:31,530
Hello?

975
01:04:32,832 --> 01:04:34,600
Oh God.

976
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:35,667
Becky?

977
01:04:35,701 --> 01:04:38,704
Jesus Christ, Chase,
you scared me after that.

978
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:40,539
Sorry, I didn't wanna disturb
you.

979
01:04:40,572 --> 01:04:42,374
I just wanted to make
sure you had a towel.

980
01:04:42,407 --> 01:04:45,444
Oh, okay, thanks.

981
01:04:45,477 --> 01:04:46,846
Hey, Chase.

982
01:04:46,879 --> 01:04:48,480
[Chase] Yeah?

983
01:04:48,513 --> 01:04:50,549
Do you believe in ghosts?

984
01:04:50,582 --> 01:04:52,150
Why would you ask that?

985
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:54,152
Well, you believe in magic.

986
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:55,822
I mean like what's the
difference really?

987
01:04:55,855 --> 01:04:57,489
Besides, I think the curse of
chief Dohate

988
01:04:57,522 --> 01:04:59,859
does haunt these woods.

989
01:04:59,892 --> 01:05:01,360
I don't think so.

990
01:05:01,393 --> 01:05:02,361
But what about what you said
about,

991
01:05:02,394 --> 01:05:05,430
you know, before, about
hearing the drum beats?

992
01:05:05,464 --> 01:05:06,799
I was just messing around.

993
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,166
I think that this book has
started...

994
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,134
Hey wait, I wasn't finished.

995
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:10,737
Did you know that in the next
county over,

996
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:12,170
at the Silver Lake Casino,

997
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:14,373
the descendants of
Aiyana and Dohate's tribe

998
01:05:14,406 --> 01:05:15,942
live and work there?

999
01:05:15,975 --> 01:05:17,142
Yeah?

1000
01:05:17,175 --> 01:05:18,845
Well, they can't be very
happy with you guys, can they?

1001
01:05:18,878 --> 01:05:20,312
In their mind, it's the white
bred

1002
01:05:20,345 --> 01:05:22,581
Larson family squatting on their
land.

1003
01:05:22,614 --> 01:05:23,281
Whoa.

1004
01:05:23,315 --> 01:05:25,584
And what about that ring too?

1005
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:27,486
Does that actually belong to you
guys?

1006
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:28,720
Or did you take that too?

1007
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:30,288
Becky, take it easy.

1008
01:05:30,322 --> 01:05:32,724
My family's totally cool with
that casino.

1009
01:05:32,759 --> 01:05:34,693
They make a lot of money off of
the guests

1010
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:36,662
that stay at Liberty Manor.

1011
01:05:36,695 --> 01:05:38,931
As for the ring, I don't know.

1012
01:05:38,965 --> 01:05:40,332
My dad's really protective of
it.

1013
01:05:40,365 --> 01:05:41,768
He never takes it outta the
case.

1014
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:43,335
It's like an antique.

1015
01:05:43,368 --> 01:05:45,570
This is my home you're talking
about.

1016
01:05:45,604 --> 01:05:46,238
Sorry.

1017
01:05:48,908 --> 01:05:51,309
I mean, there are some Indians

1018
01:05:51,343 --> 01:05:55,247
that try to claim this land as
their own

1019
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,784
but my family owns this
property fair and square.

1020
01:05:58,851 --> 01:06:01,754
To the richest go the spoils I
guess.

1021
01:06:01,788 --> 01:06:04,222
Besides, even if there was a
curse

1022
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:05,624
it worked out in your favor.

1023
01:06:06,558 --> 01:06:09,628
You know, sometimes I think

1024
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:11,329
maybe there really is a curse.

1025
01:06:13,265 --> 01:06:15,600
Anyways, I think we're both
getting a little freaked out

1026
01:06:15,634 --> 01:06:17,003
by these stories, so...

1027
01:06:17,036 --> 01:06:17,970
You're probably right.

1028
01:06:18,004 --> 01:06:20,907
We should just relax,
it is winter break.

1029
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,607
You're right.

1030
01:06:22,641 --> 01:06:25,510
I'm probably just, you
know, give me 30 minutes.

1031
01:06:25,544 --> 01:06:29,414
I just need to detox from
my, my chemistry final.

1032
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:30,850
All right, take your time.

1033
01:06:30,883 --> 01:06:31,751
Thanks.

1034
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:15,594
Look, I know you think
I'm crazy right now,

1035
01:07:15,627 --> 01:07:17,730
but something is really going on
here.

1036
01:07:26,371 --> 01:07:27,339
Fuck that guy.

1037
01:07:29,976 --> 01:07:33,012
I don't think Chase had
anything to do with this.

1038
01:07:33,045 --> 01:07:34,312
How do you explain it?

1039
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:35,313
I don't know, dude.

1040
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:36,949
How does this ring just
keep getting on my hand.

1041
01:07:36,983 --> 01:07:39,919
I took this ring off and
I put it back in the study

1042
01:07:39,952 --> 01:07:41,888
and it just keeps ending
up back on my hand

1043
01:07:41,921 --> 01:07:44,723
over and over and over again.

1044
01:07:44,757 --> 01:07:46,358
I know and I'm telling you

1045
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:48,393
Chase has to be up to this.

1046
01:07:48,426 --> 01:07:50,395
There's something else going
on here.

1047
01:07:50,428 --> 01:07:52,364
He's the only one that knows
magic.

1048
01:07:52,397 --> 01:07:53,032
This has to be magic.

1049
01:07:53,065 --> 01:07:54,734
This is not magic.

1050
01:07:54,767 --> 01:07:56,468
Magic, doesn't work that way.

1051
01:07:56,501 --> 01:07:57,369
Then how does it work?

1052
01:07:57,402 --> 01:07:58,503
How do you explain this?

1053
01:07:58,537 --> 01:08:00,807
I don't know how to explain
this.

1054
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,641
This whole place, this whole
house,

1055
01:08:02,674 --> 01:08:04,543
the story, the burial ground,

1056
01:08:04,576 --> 01:08:07,013
everything that's
happening to us, around us.

1057
01:08:09,648 --> 01:08:11,416
None of it makes sense.

1058
01:08:11,449 --> 01:08:12,285
No, it doesn't.

1059
01:08:15,587 --> 01:08:18,925
I just wanna go, dude, I just
wanna go.

This water is now your hell.

1066

Do you hear that?

1067
01:09:36,002 --> 01:09:37,535
Hear what?

1068
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:38,703
Shh, listen.

1069
01:09:44,676 --> 01:09:45,878
What is that?

1070
01:09:48,748 --> 01:09:49,949
Eddie, what's going on?

1071
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:53,618
What the hell?

1072
01:09:53,652 --> 01:09:54,653
Oh my God.

1073
01:09:54,686 --> 01:09:55,553
Stay back!

1074
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:05,064
Don't make me use it!

1075
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,807
Stay back!

1076
01:10:20,212 --> 01:10:21,747
What's happening?

1077
01:11:29,315 --> 01:11:30,783
Oh God, Becky!

1078
01:11:34,353 --> 01:11:35,553
Becky?

1079
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:36,688
Oh my God!

1080
01:11:36,721 --> 01:11:37,589
Oh my God!

1081
01:11:43,362 --> 01:11:44,764
[Adrianna] Eddie, look behind
you!

1082
01:11:44,797 --> 01:11:45,630
Eddie!

1083
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,732
Eddie!

1084
01:11:46,766 --> 01:11:48,100
Eddie, oh my God!

1085
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:50,236
Oh my God!

1086
01:11:55,841 --> 01:11:57,243
[Chase] Adrianna!

1087
01:12:01,646 --> 01:12:03,249
Stop it, just stop!

1088
01:12:28,774 --> 01:12:30,776
[Damon] Get back here!

1089
01:13:12,084 --> 01:13:13,085
Not so fast.

1090
01:13:25,865 --> 01:13:28,367
[Eddie choking]

1091
01:14:13,913 --> 01:14:16,714
[both screaming]

1092
01:14:43,475 --> 01:14:44,343
No!

1093
01:14:47,846 --> 01:14:50,382
[Chase choking]

1094
01:14:55,921 --> 01:14:58,057
[Damon] Don't fight me.

1095
01:15:16,242 --> 01:15:19,979
[Adrianna breathing heavily]

1096
01:15:27,353 --> 01:15:28,354
She has the ring.

1097
01:15:33,859 --> 01:15:35,027
What are you doing?

1098
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:38,063
[Adrianna screaming]

1099
01:15:56,282 --> 01:15:57,349
Get off me, please.

1100
01:15:57,383 --> 01:15:58,917
Please, please!

1101
01:15:58,951 --> 01:16:01,954
[Adrianna screaming]

1102
01:16:16,235 --> 01:16:20,039
[Adrianna muffled screaming]

1103
01:16:20,072 --> 01:16:22,007
Relax and I won't hurt you.

1104
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:24,109
I don't wanna hurt you.

1105
01:16:24,143 --> 01:16:27,880
[Adrianna breathing heavily]

1106
01:16:45,898 --> 01:16:47,833
Just do as you're told.

1107
01:17:17,463 --> 01:17:19,164
Get the fuck off of me!

1108
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:20,065
Relax!

1109
01:17:25,971 --> 01:17:28,173
My father has been expecting
you.

1110
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:29,675
I'll take her from here.

1111
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:30,576
Okay.

1112
01:17:36,382 --> 01:17:37,316
Have a seat.

1113
01:17:45,257 --> 01:17:47,192
Thank you for coming, Adrianna.

1114
01:17:47,226 --> 01:17:49,495
I don't think I had much of a
choice.

1115
01:17:52,197 --> 01:17:53,065
Is that for me?

1116
01:17:53,966 --> 01:17:55,467
What?

1117
01:17:55,501 --> 01:17:56,969
Let me see it, please.

1118
01:17:57,737 --> 01:17:58,604
See what?

1119
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:01,073
My ring you are wearing.

1120
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:05,911
It won't come off, I've tried.

1121
01:18:07,312 --> 01:18:08,380
It will now, try.

1122
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:26,498
Many of my people have died for
this ring.

1123
01:18:27,633 --> 01:18:29,034
Many of mine too.

1124
01:18:29,067 --> 01:18:30,369
Thanks to you, I'm guessing.

1125
01:18:31,503 --> 01:18:33,472
Collateral damage, I'm afraid

1126
01:18:34,373 --> 01:18:37,342
Your friends desecrated hallowed
ground.

1127
01:18:37,376 --> 01:18:39,378
Our forefathers tilled the soil,

1128
01:18:39,411 --> 01:18:43,015
fed our hungry and buried our
slaughtered,

1129
01:18:43,048 --> 01:18:47,186
and what they call deep
irony and great disrespect.

1130
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:49,721
Liberty Manor Estate.

1131
01:18:49,756 --> 01:18:51,523
The Larson family owned that
land.

1132
01:18:51,557 --> 01:18:52,991
Bullshit!

1133
01:18:54,226 --> 01:18:57,329
This land was taken from
my people, illegally.

1134
01:18:58,597 --> 01:19:03,302
For more than 200 years,
we've been regulated to this.

1135
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,505
This God-forsaken casino.

1136
01:19:08,741 --> 01:19:10,209
A government handout.

1137
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:12,611
Do you have any idea what this
does

1138
01:19:12,644 --> 01:19:15,247
to the collective psyche of a
nation?

1139
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,049
A once proud nation of warriors,

1140
01:19:17,082 --> 01:19:19,218
leaders, and heroes?

1141
01:19:21,353 --> 01:19:22,621
I'm sorry about what happened.

1142
01:19:22,654 --> 01:19:24,423
Oh, you're sorry?

1143
01:19:24,456 --> 01:19:26,158
Isn't that rich?

1144
01:19:26,191 --> 01:19:28,060
Everybody's sorry.

1145
01:19:28,093 --> 01:19:31,029
They, they take my land.

1146
01:19:31,063 --> 01:19:32,364
They take my heritage.

1147
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:36,235
You know what we get in return?

1148
01:19:36,268 --> 01:19:37,369
What?

1149
01:19:39,304 --> 01:19:42,708
The jungle room, a guttered
casino,

1150
01:19:43,709 --> 01:19:46,078
a lot of hollow apologies.

1151
01:19:48,313 --> 01:19:50,482
This ring represents
all that has gone wrong

1152
01:19:50,516 --> 01:19:52,217
these last 200 years.

1153
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:56,823
As Chief Tocho, I owe my people

1154
01:19:56,856 --> 01:19:59,725
the chance to honor their
dead the proper way.

1155
01:19:59,759 --> 01:20:02,461
I'm sorry for what happened
to your people but I...

1156
01:20:02,494 --> 01:20:03,428
Our people.

1157
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:05,597
Excuse me?

1158
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,299
You see, the ring chose you.

1159
01:20:08,768 --> 01:20:10,269
The ring brought you to me.

1160
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:15,207
The only way to break that
curse is with true native blood.

1161
01:20:16,809 --> 01:20:19,511
You do know somewhat about
your heritage, don't you?

1162
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,147
I was adopted.

1163
01:20:23,582 --> 01:20:25,752
Well, the one thing
you should know, child,

1164
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:26,853
man does not own the land

1165
01:20:26,886 --> 01:20:28,755
any more than an Eagle owns the
sky.

1166
01:20:30,289 --> 01:20:32,190
The land is a hollowed ground.

1167
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,194
And while not owned, as
the white man defines it.

1168
01:20:37,296 --> 01:20:40,132
It will again be occupied by my
tribe.

1169
01:20:40,165 --> 01:20:41,500
How do you plan on doing that?

1170
01:20:41,533 --> 01:20:44,169
More bloodshed, more killings?

1171
01:20:44,202 --> 01:20:45,370
I hope not.

1172
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:49,842
The only thing that stopped us
until now has been this ring.

1173
01:20:49,876 --> 01:20:52,144
For generations it's haunted my
people.

1174
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:57,382
What are you gonna do with it?

1175
01:20:59,651 --> 01:21:02,321
This rings domain belongs to
no man.

1176
01:21:03,221 --> 01:21:05,257
I don't understand.

1177
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:08,393
Bury the ring, bury the curse.

1178
01:21:13,933 --> 01:21:16,335
This ring will no longer reign
supreme,

1179
01:21:17,402 --> 01:21:19,605
but be given back to the Earth.

1180
01:21:19,638 --> 01:21:20,907
What are you gonna do with me?

1181
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:21,808
Kill me?

1182
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:24,476
No, of course not.

1183
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:29,481
Curse of the ring is broken,
you're to thank for that.

1184
01:21:30,682 --> 01:21:33,151
It's time we write a new
chapter.

1185
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:35,721
No more bloodshed, no more
death.

1186
01:21:36,655 --> 01:21:39,358
Unless of course you and
Javon care to make trouble.

1187
01:21:39,391 --> 01:21:41,560
Javon, he's alive?

1188
01:21:41,593 --> 01:21:42,829
The ring carefully chooses

1189
01:21:42,862 --> 01:21:44,797
who it needs to pay it's debts.

1190
01:21:44,831 --> 01:21:46,833
Didn't want you or Javon.

1191
01:21:46,866 --> 01:21:49,635
Now with the ring no
longer in our possession,

1192
01:21:49,668 --> 01:21:51,203
the tragic events from last
night

1193
01:21:51,236 --> 01:21:52,704
have no ties to me or my people.

1194
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:54,874
I was quite careful about that.

1195
01:21:57,275 --> 01:21:58,410
You will take this.

1196
01:22:02,949 --> 01:22:05,317
I don't want your hush money.

1197
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:07,552
Let me remind you there
are four dead bodies

1198
01:22:07,586 --> 01:22:09,488
at a party that you were at.

1199
01:22:09,521 --> 01:22:11,323
The only one missing is you.

1200
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:14,794
And then there's this,
the security footage.

1201
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,976
I didn't do any of this.

1202
01:22:30,009 --> 01:22:33,211
What kind of fucking sick
game are playing here?

1203
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,280
Of course you didn't,
sweetheart.

1204
01:22:35,313 --> 01:22:37,349
But how do you plan on
explaining that to the police

1205
01:22:37,382 --> 01:22:39,251
that are currently questioning
Javon?

1206
01:22:40,787 --> 01:22:41,687
Let me start again.

1207
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:44,589
My guys will bring you back to
the house.

1208
01:22:44,623 --> 01:22:46,458
You will come running through
the woods

1209
01:22:46,491 --> 01:22:48,460
claiming you were tied up and
beaten

1210
01:22:48,493 --> 01:22:49,494
and you just got free.

1211
01:22:52,397 --> 01:22:54,767
Damon, the man that was
shot dead in front of you

1212
01:22:54,801 --> 01:22:57,804
will take the fall for all the
events that occurred tonight.

1213
01:23:00,773 --> 01:23:03,241
Mr. Greene, the new grounds
keeper

1214
01:23:03,275 --> 01:23:04,609
will collaborate the story

1215
01:23:04,643 --> 01:23:06,946
and take responsibility for
shooting.

1216
01:23:09,048 --> 01:23:10,917
The footage of you will be
destroyed.

1217
01:23:12,417 --> 01:23:15,320
And I will offer the Larson's
an offer they can't refuse.

1218
01:23:16,488 --> 01:23:19,725
To sell their property that's
filled with horrible memories.

1219
01:23:22,427 --> 01:23:25,230
[sinister music]

1220
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:19,578
Help!

1221
01:25:21,147 --> 01:25:22,014
Help!

1222
01:25:26,451 --> 01:25:27,452
Please help.

1223
01:25:32,959 --> 01:25:33,960
Who are you?

1224
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,009
What is this place?

1225
01:25:51,576 --> 01:25:52,577
Who are you?

1226
01:25:53,645 --> 01:25:55,714
What do you want from me?

1227
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:05,157
[neck snapping]

1228
01:26:05,191 --> 01:26:07,927
[intense music]

1229
01:27:20,733 --> 01:27:21,599
What!

1230
01:27:23,803 --> 01:27:26,571
You were never gonna pay me my
money.

1231
01:27:26,604 --> 01:27:30,109
It seems betrayal is not
only a white man's trait.

1232
01:27:32,979 --> 01:27:35,781
[Damon laughing]

1233
01:27:43,956 --> 01:27:45,057
I want my money!

1234
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:48,260
Listen carefully, Chief,

1235
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:51,831
when you dance with the devil,

1236
01:27:51,864 --> 01:27:54,566
it's the devil that picks the
tune.

1237
01:27:55,768 --> 01:27:56,634
Adios!

1238
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:02,574
[soft horror music]

1239
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:21,187
[women screaming]

1240
01:29:28,427 --> 01:29:31,864
Who am I?

1241
01:29:31,897 --> 01:29:33,866
I am the companion.

1242
01:29:35,734 --> 01:29:36,601
The black wind.

1243
01:30:03,462 --> 01:30:04,396
I am Damon.

1244
01:30:05,464 --> 01:30:08,400
[woman whimpering]

1245
01:30:27,153 --> 01:30:30,022
[woman screaming]

1246
01:31:25,044 --> 01:31:27,712
[upbeat music]

1247
01:31:36,188 --> 01:31:37,189
How are you?

1248
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,902
So how have you been?

1249
01:31:49,935 --> 01:31:51,170
Where have you been?

1250
01:31:51,203 --> 01:31:52,838
I know, I'm sorry.

1251
01:31:52,871 --> 01:31:55,140
I think I just needed a
little bit of time, you know?

1252
01:31:55,174 --> 01:31:57,776
It just got really hard there
for awhile.

1253
01:31:57,810 --> 01:32:02,047
I get that, I, I definitely
understand.

1254
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:04,383
So, we should do something this
weekend.

1255
01:32:05,484 --> 01:32:08,254
Not anything that has to
do with any creepy masks

1256
01:32:08,287 --> 01:32:10,356
or weirdos or anything like that

1257
01:32:10,389 --> 01:32:13,259
but, I don't know, nothing, have
fun.

1258
01:32:13,292 --> 01:32:15,027
That actually sounds
like it could be nice,

1259
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,128
but there's actually something

1260
01:32:16,161 --> 01:32:18,063
I gotta go take care of though
first.

1261
01:32:18,097 --> 01:32:19,431
So, I think I'm gonna go head
and do that,

1262
01:32:19,465 --> 01:32:21,233
but I'll be here this weekend
for sure.

1263
01:32:21,267 --> 01:32:26,005
Okay, yeah, that sounds good.

1264
01:33:00,506 --> 01:33:03,509
[mysterious music]

1265
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:43,515
So, here you are.

1266
01:33:43,549 --> 01:33:45,417
What took you so long to find
me?

1267
01:33:45,451 --> 01:33:46,385
You bastard!

1268
01:33:46,418 --> 01:33:49,655
Your hand shakes 'cause you
have doubt.

1269
01:33:49,688 --> 01:33:51,357
You ain't gonna pull that
trigger.

1270
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:52,925
Fuck you, I don't have any
doubt.

1271
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:54,560
You killed my friends.

1272
01:33:54,593 --> 01:33:56,628
Your friends were standing in
my way.

1273
01:33:56,662 --> 01:33:59,298
And you'd kill me too
if given the chance.

1274
01:33:59,331 --> 01:34:03,402
You know what, honey,
if I wanted you dead,

1275
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:06,505
we wouldn't be having this
conversation right now, would we?

1276
01:34:06,538 --> 01:34:08,374
You liked killing them?

1277
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:10,976
Well, that should make no
difference

1278
01:34:11,009 --> 01:34:15,080
because killing comes
easier for some people.

1279
01:34:16,148 --> 01:34:17,015
Like me.

1280
01:34:19,418 --> 01:34:21,553
It was never supposed to be
like this,

1281
01:34:21,587 --> 01:34:23,322
you promised that you
never would've done that.

1282
01:34:23,355 --> 01:34:25,924
It was never supposed to be like
this.

1283
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:28,060
The ring had to be secured

1284
01:34:28,093 --> 01:34:29,928
and your friends got in the way.

1285
01:34:29,962 --> 01:34:31,296
Stop saying that.

1286
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:33,665
Fuck you, stop saying that!

1287
01:34:33,699 --> 01:34:34,900
I needed the ring

1288
01:34:34,933 --> 01:34:38,470
and I couldn't have gotten it
without your help, Adrianna.

1289
01:34:38,504 --> 01:34:40,072
You will be compensated.

1290
01:34:40,105 --> 01:34:42,341
I'm not afraid of you, not
anymore.

1291
01:34:43,475 --> 01:34:45,310
I don't want your blood money.

1292
01:34:45,344 --> 01:34:47,679
Adrianna, put the gun down.

1293
01:34:50,549 --> 01:34:52,251
The chief put a bounty on your
head.

1294
01:34:52,284 --> 01:34:53,619
I kill you and bring him the
mask

1295
01:34:53,652 --> 01:34:55,521
and I'll have all the
money I'll ever need.

1296
01:34:55,554 --> 01:34:58,190
You really think the
chief is gonna let you live?

1297
01:34:58,223 --> 01:35:01,226
First the ring and now the mask.

1298
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:04,196
An evil wind blows through him.

1299
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:06,932
The curse is not buried
in the sand, my child.

1300
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:09,001
I'll take my chances.

1301
01:35:10,402 --> 01:35:13,439
Adrianna, the curse is alive.

1302
01:35:13,472 --> 01:35:16,175
An evil wind blows through you
too.

1303
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:20,479
The weakness of the enemy,
creates our strength.

1304
01:35:20,512 --> 01:35:25,484
from the strength, we can
thrive in life and in death.

1305
01:35:25,517 --> 01:35:30,355
After all, all those before
us are not really dead,

1306
01:35:30,389 --> 01:35:34,159
their hearts can beat in the
souls that they leave behind.

1307
01:35:34,193 --> 01:35:35,394
There is honor in death.

1308
01:35:35,427 --> 01:35:40,199
There is dignity in passing
from this world into the next,

1309
01:35:40,232 --> 01:35:44,102
after all the tragedy
of life is not death.

1310
01:35:44,136 --> 01:35:47,206
The tragedy of life is what
we let die inside of us

1311
01:35:47,239 --> 01:35:48,140
while we live.
