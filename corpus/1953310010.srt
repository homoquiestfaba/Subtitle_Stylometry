THE SVANKMAJERS' lMAGlNlNGS

3
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,790
<i>Jan Svankmajer's work</i>
<i>goes beyond filmmaking.</i>

4
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,830
<i>For more than 30 years</i>
<i>he has worked with his wife Eva,</i>

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,710
<i>and their work</i>
<i>is inseparable from their life.</i>

6
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,910
<i>Engraving, painting, collage,</i>

7
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,870
<i>ceramics, invention of objects</i>
<i>and animals, puppets,</i>

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,750
<i>poetry and so on.</i>

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,910
<i>They work in many different media,</i>

10
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,150
<i>but always as a response to surrealism.</i>

11
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,310
<i>As secret members of the surrealist group</i>
<i>in communist Prague,</i>

12
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,060
<i>since the Velvet Revolution</i>
<i>they have beer working tirelessly.</i>

13
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,550
<i>Last winter they interrupted work</i>
<i>on their new film</i>  Little Otik,

14
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,950
<i>to organise an exhibition</i>
<i>showing their body of work.</i>

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,150
HUMAN ANATOMY

16
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,150
NATURAL HlSTORY

17
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,230
And over there are the collages.

18
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,150
Yes, those are the collages.

19
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,030
Some of them are new,
some are of disjointed anatomy.

20
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,590
- But those are new things?
- Yes, also.

21
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,790
l found inexpensive, second-hand
anatomical atlases.

22
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,380
l couldn't resist cutting them up.

23
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,230
Although it's a bit...

24
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,620
Some objects travel
from one film to another

25
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,390
or from another art form to a film
or conversely from a film to another art form.

26
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,780
l think there is only one sort of poetry

27
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,110
and that the form of expression
of that poetry is not that important,

28
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,790
whether it's film, painting,
engraving, collage or ceramics.

29
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,310
lt's professional laziness
to only use one form of expression.

30
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,110
ln that respect l consider myself
to be a militant surrealist.

31
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,390
<i>The Felaceus Oedipus or 'false Oedipus'</i>

32
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,670
<i>is an extremely rare species found</i>
<i>on the edge of the Australian bush.</i>

33
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,750
<i>Its neck extends</i>
<i>from a giant elastic pouch,</i>

34
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,550
<i>A bony thorax rises</i>
<i>from the upperpart of the neck.</i>

35
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,390
<i>The Australian Aborigenes</i>
<i>call the bird 'Maca Samambo',</i>

36
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,070
<i>which means 'giver of sons'.</i>

37
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,110
<i>They believe that</i>
<i>if a pregnant woman eats one of its eggs,</i>,

38
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,950
<i>she will give birth to a son.</i>

39
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,630
<i>And the Felaceus Oedipus' eggs</i>
<i>hatch into male chicks</i>,

40
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,870
<i>which are born penis first.</i>

41
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,550
<i>There was once a man and a woman</i>
<i>who didn't have any children,</i>

42
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,390
<i>which made them very urhappy.</i>

43
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,300
<i>One day the man went into the forest</i>

44
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,390
<i>and there he found a root</i>
<i>in the shape of a little boy.</i>

45
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,350
<i>He took it back to his wife</i>
<i>and they called it Otesánek</i>

46
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,150
We are cutting various shapes
of Otesánek's body

47
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,150
for different stages of the animation.

48
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,110
We need the legs
to have different positions,

49
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,470
the branches as legs
in different positions

50
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,950
so we can make them move
as Otesánek moves.

51
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,350
And what's that for?

52
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,710
That's to animate the facial expressions.

53
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,590
We choose different shapes
with different orifices

54
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,270
because afterwards they become eyes or teeth,
orifices where light disappears.

55
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,550
We want to make Otesánek's expressions
out of real pieces of wood.

56
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,710
There are still lots of Otesáneks
to be made here.

57
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,870
For example,
this piece of wood has a lovely penis.

58
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,790
We have chosen to create the movement
in different stages.

59
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,110
There are some with their legs apart,

60
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,990
others with one leg
or with both legs together.

61
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,590
And we're going to film all that

62
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,270
in sequences of two images
to create movement.

63
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,510
We made this one sitting down

64
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,500
so the mother can hold it in her arms.

65
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,630
For the animation,
they will be done differently,

66
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,830
clothed and made of lead wire.

67
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,950
Fingers and hands will be animated,
the legs and head will move.

68
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,430
This stage is between that one -

69
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,550
its legs are closer together which is good -

70
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,390
- and this stage.

71
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,830
l think we should have enough stages.

72
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,580
lf we add the two completed Otesáneks
we have over there,

73
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,230
l think that should be enough.

74
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,620
l'll chop it into pieces!

75
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,150
You've gone mad!

76
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,870
You've gone mad. l won't let you.

77
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,790
Martin, there's one there on that side.

78
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,630
There on that side.

79
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,950
A feature of these pine roots
is that they look like little fingers.

80
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,350
We're going to use them
to make Otesánek's fingers and toes.

81
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,110
So we've come here
to look for fingers and toes.

82
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,510
The roots can go up and then disappear.

83
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,110
We can start.

84
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,780
The shoulder!

85
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,550
ls it going?

86
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,470
Otesánek!

87
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,190
We're using classical techniques
to animate <i>Little Otik</i>

88
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,990
We're going to combine animation
in close-up shots

89
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,230
with techniques
using puppets on nylon strings.

90
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,510
And we're going
to combine that with shots

91
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:12,390
where someone is inside Otesánek
with gloves made like little roots.

92
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,110
He moves his hands,
his fingers, the roots.

93
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,860
So we combine
those classical techniques.

94
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,430
That's the best way because...

95
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,110
because before the spectator can grasp
how each picture is made

96
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,550
the technique changes again.

97
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,590
So he's been tricked

98
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,630
and can't work out how we did it.

99
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,150
lf you move something
when animating the roots,

100
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,110
you'll have to work with it...

101
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,910
ls it more difficult to animate
real wood than latex?

102
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,700
ln some ways
it's a bit more complicated

103
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,270
but on the other hand,
the material implies its own movement

104
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,230
so, in a sense, the material cooperates.

105
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,230
lt's not the stylisation of an object.

106
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,470
So it's more difficult.

107
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,150
But l prefer it
because it's kind of natural.

108
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,260
Animating Otesánek
is physically demanding!

109
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,630
<i>Leave that</i>

110
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,310
<i>Don't do that</i>

111
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,030
<i>Why don't you listen to me?</i>

112
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,030
<i>Don't tear it.</i>

113
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,220
<i>What did l tell you?</i>

114
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,680
What do you think
of computer animation?

115
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,950
l haven't used it so far.
What l've seen up to now seems

116
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,110
to be very cold,
very technical, very distant.

117
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,070
All that l've needed
to do up until now

118
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,350
l have done using classical,
manual techniques,

119
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,910
including the film <i>Food</i>
where the characters...

120
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,670
are devouring the tables and chairs

121
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,670
and we see their heads change.

122
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,190
All that was done with modelling clay.

123
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,510
lt's not that l am a lover
of the days gone by

124
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,070
but l don't like these techniques
because there's something missing.

125
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,070
lt's too perfect.
The technique is too garish.

126
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,270
Whereas with manual animation,
it's less precise.

127
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:16,070
There are lots of little
imperfections and mistakes

128
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,950
and for me mistakes are very important

129
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,830
because they make the film subjective.

130
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,100
Like the ancient Hermeticists,

131
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,620
l believe that objects
have a life of their own.

132
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,590
And because
they have witnessed certain events,

133
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,910
or rather because
they've been handled by people

134
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,590
who were in a certain frame of mind,
who were tense or anxious,

135
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,990
and these objects have absorbed all that

136
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:08,590
and in certain situations objects
can convey what they have absorbed.

137
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,550
So based on what l feel they contain,
l collect these objects

138
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,900
and introduce them into my films.

139
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,950
THE CELLAR

140
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,390
Places haunt me as much as themes.

141
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,030
One of the most haunting themes
is the cellar.

142
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,910
l really suffered as a child
when l had to go down there.

143
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,070
The cellar in <i>Alice</i>
and of course in <i>Little Otik</i>  too,

144
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,580
is the cellar from my childhood.

145
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,470
There was a cellar like that
in our block of flats in Vrsovice.

146
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,590
My mother sent me down to the cellar

147
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,910
to fetch coal when l was older
and before that to fetch potatoes.

148
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,070
lt was, of course...

149
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,190
a terrifying experience.

150
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,550
lt was awful.

151
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,030
When my mother asked me
to go down to the cellar for potatoes,

152
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,750
l almost felt like
running away from home.

153
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,870
But at the same time,
it fed my imagination.

154
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,390
Why did you choose to use a little girl

155
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,830
to represent your fear?

156
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,150
lt didn't feel right to use
a little boy in that role

157
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,350
because l thought
that my anxiety was linked

158
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,420
to the feminine side that exists in a man.

159
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,790
So l decided to replace myself

160
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,350
with a sort of childlike
incarnation of my spirit.

161
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,470
These objects are from the film <i>Alice</i>

162
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,980
There you have croissants with nails

163
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,710
and these are eggs with skulls.
lt's marinated in something.

164
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,510
Some eggs are probably bad
and if we were to uncork the bottle,

165
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,150
it would stink.

166
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,790
Look, it's rotten there.

167
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,950
That's from the film <i>Alice</i>

168
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,910
This is classic putrefaction.

169
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,950
These are the shoes worn
by the cameraman on <i>Alice</i>

170
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,230
They've been in here since 1986.

171
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,670
lt's hermetically sealed

172
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,350
and they're slowly rotting inside.

173
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,590
We're going to put this one here

174
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,590
and the other one against the wall.

175
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,510
Here are the king and queen.

176
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,670
Eva has depicted herself
as the wicked queen.

177
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,790
<i>Off with their heads!'</i>

178
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,550
<i>ordered the Queen.</i>

179
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,710
This is the March Hare

180
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,510
and this is the Mad Hatter.

181
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,150
They're the characters in <i>Alice</i>

182
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,150
Eva made the hare and l made this one.

183
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,390
CREATlVE DlALOGUE

184
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,470
Can it be washed?

185
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,750
lt can't. l can scrub it
but water won't clean it.

186
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,070
All along l carry an idea about the film.

187
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,950
l also have an idea

188
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,230
and of where l come in,
what l will do.

189
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,830
l try my hardest
to understand what Jan wants.

190
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,350
I don't know how to copy.

191
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,830
l have my own personal expression.
l've had it for years...

192
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,830
Of course, l give Eva free reign.

193
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,990
What l want from her is

194
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,390
within the framework
of her own thinking, her own creativity.

195
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,000
She fits in
without forcing herself.

196
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,830
l can't say to her,
'l want that redder,' or 'bigger'.

197
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,710
Eva did a lot of work as a painter
on <i>The Pendulum, the Pit and Hope.</i>

198
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,540
She made the moving wall,

199
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,430
the panels which represent hell

200
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,790
and push the condemned into the abyss.

201
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,790
To sum up the collaborative process,

202
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,550
Eva has her own creative programme.

203
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,590
She is a painter,
she writes prose and poetry.

204
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,510
We work independently of each other.

205
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,830
We are linked by surrealism

206
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,950
but that's another matter.

207
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,910
Once l broke one

208
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,990
because people was watching me.
I needed them to go away,

209
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,670
so that l did not have to see
them seeing me.

210
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,910
Leave me alone.

211
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,070
l can see you're very good at group sex!

212
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,750
Oh, no!

213
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,350
Once someone l knew
invited me to an orgy

214
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,470
and l got such a shock

215
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,550
that he never suggested it again.

216
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,590
They are placed around the outside.

217
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,950
- That's impossible.
- Leave it.

218
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,550
l'll position that one.

219
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,790
lf you numbered them they must...

220
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,030
You'll break it.

221
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,710
That's not the way.

222
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,140
That's number five. lt can't go there.

223
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,030
But this one belongs here.

224
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,430
OK, OK.

225
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,430
This one fits in here.
You'll break it.

226
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,180
That's number two. lt goes there.

227
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,310
l put them wrong yesterday.

228
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,590
Right...

229
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,830
Wait!

230
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,750
You're messing it up.

231
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,390
Again. Take them all off.

232
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,430
We'll have to start again.

233
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,350
That one should be in front.

234
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,870
Eva.

235
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,670
Shouldn't they be the other way round?

236
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,700
What?

237
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,470
That one should be in front
and that one behind.

238
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,230
That one has to be in front.

239
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,110
l prefer not to see it.

240
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,590
Well, put some cloth over it.

241
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,380
We're always trying
to say something to each other.

242
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,030
We're always curious
of what the other's attitude will be...

243
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,830
how they will react.

244
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,550
lt broadens the perspective.

245
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,390
There we go. At last.

246
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,310
Why do you sign your ceramics E and J?

247
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,790
The initials E and J
distinguish between things

248
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,430
made by Jan and by me.

249
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,830
We work with the same materials,

250
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,670
we share the same life

251
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,550
but we express ourselves differently,

252
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,590
not in terms of ideas...

253
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,470
nor in terms of our interpretation of life,

254
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,190
but the art we create is different.

255
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,070
Our work is not interchangeable.

256
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,670
How did you work together on <i>Little Otik</i>?

257
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,950
Eva really liked
the story of 'Otesánek'.

258
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,860
She wanted to make it
into an animated film

259
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,070
and she wrote a script.

260
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,670
l tried to dissuade her

261
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,230
but Eva was already working on it,

262
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,790
and because of the transfer
of thought processes

263
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,430
that passes between two people
who live together...

264
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,830
l was very sceptical to start with

265
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,030
about the idea of making a film of a fairytale.

266
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:50,020
Then suddenly l found myself
thinking also about the subject.

267
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,990
lt started taking shape in my head.

268
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,790
And l said to myself,
'Christ, l can't steal this idea from Eva.'

269
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:04,820
But l had delved so deeply
into the subject

270
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,140
that l couldn't stop developing it further.

271
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,550
l was presented with a dilemma
and l didn't know what to do.

272
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,310
So l admitted to her
that l wanted to work on 'Otesánek' too.

273
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,820
She got a bit angry.

274
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,390
Then we realised
that there was no conflict of interests

275
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,060
and that we could incorporate
her film in mine.

276
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,830
<i>One morning the man dug up</i>
<i>a little tree stump in the forest.</i>

277
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,310
<i>It looked like a little child.</i>

278
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,870
<i>He just had to cut the roots</i>
<i>into hands and legs.</i>

279
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,510
These are the preliminary sketches

280
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,270
for the animation of <i>Little Otik</i>

281
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,870
Here's Otesánek in the house.

282
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,870
And that's the old woman
who cuts his stomach open.

283
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,110
<i>But the ohd womar was quick</i>

284
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,910
<i>She took her hoe</i>

285
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,390
<i>and with one blow</i>
<i>split Otesánek's stomach open</i>

286
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,190
These are the different stages
for the father

287
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,750
when he sees the mother
being wolfed down.

288
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,030
That's what it look s like.

289
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,670
Then l put it on a lit table...

290
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,070
l light it so l can copy
the different stages of the image,

291
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,830
with the agreement of the film's director.

292
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,070
But the director is unavailable at the moment
because he's looking after the actors.

293
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,710
These are our children's things.

294
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,550
The little hat, the panties. All of it.

295
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,670
- And look, this one has little buttocks.
- Look at the little bottom!

296
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,750
He has all he needs.

297
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,430
We've come here
to look for the film's protagonist.

298
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,550
l know what l need to look for.

299
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,220
Good.

300
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,830
l have a photograph of Eva at that age.

301
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,910
We're looking for a girl like her for the film.
l don't know if we'll find her.

302
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,710
lt's Jan who's looking for that.

303
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,230
l don't know how he knows
what l looked like as a child

304
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,150
because l'm different now.

305
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,820
Perhaps he has seen photos?

306
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,590
But it's him who's looking for that.

307
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,910
When the photos are ready,
Jan's going to take them.

308
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,270
Then he's going
to sit in a chair and complain.

309
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,070
You're going to say to him,
'You've wet yourself again.

310
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,870
Can't you warn me?'

311
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,150
<i>You have to warn me</i>

312
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,550
<i>You mustn't do that</i>

313
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,110
She's very expressive.

314
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,350
Yes, she's perfect. She's the best.

315
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,670
She doesn't look older there.
She's a big girl. She could be...

316
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,990
<i>You should be ashamed of yourself</i>
<i>Who's going to wash that?</i>

317
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,430
<i>Bed-wetter</i>

318
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,040
He's going to hurl himself at you

319
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,990
and you must be waving your arms about.

320
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,030
He will be fighting with him, won't he?

321
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,780
He is crawling like this into the bed.

322
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,590
This way so that you can stretch them.

323
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,910
How?

324
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,470
Against him.

325
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,070
Like that. Against him. Yes.

326
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,790
THE PERFECT PALACE

327
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,380
<i>Tuesday 17 July</i>

328
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,830
<i>My cameraman and his wife Anna</i>
<i>came to our house in Stankov.</i>

329
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,070
<i>Having done a tour of the castle,</i>
<i>Anna made the following observation:</i>

330
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,060
<i>'You're transforming Stankov</i>
<i>into a puppet theatre'. She had a point.</i>

331
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,390
<i>I think what we had done with Stankov</i>
<i>was an amazing feat in its own way.</i>

332
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,800
<i>I hope we will have the courage</i>
<i>to see it through.</i>

333
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,030
<i>We need to build something</i>
<i>somewhere between Kuks Castle</i>

334
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,590
<i>and the postman Cheval's Perfect Palace -</i>

335
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,470
<i>a kind of surrealist home for sages.</i>

336
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,910
<i>It's going to need ever more concertration</i>

337
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,190
<i>and more intersive work.</i>

338
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,590
<i>We should draw up a plan</i>
<i>for the finished project.</i>

339
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,150
<i>Ever at the stage it's at row,</i>

340
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,350
<i> I think it could be a project</i>
<i>that will take your breath away.</i>

341
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,990
<i>But I don't know what to do.</i>

342
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,870
lt's terribly neglected.

343
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,310
Why do you surround yourself with statues?

344
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,510
That's a stupid question.

345
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,030
How can you live without statues?

346
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,110
Without trees, without water?

347
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,350
Perhaps because life
without sculptures is meaningless.

348
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,390
Perhaps because sculptures,

349
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,390
like trees and things that last,

350
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,390
are essential to life.

351
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,900
l can't say why l put statues somewhere.

352
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,590
l can't.

353
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,310
Why is Jan fascinated by Arcimboldo?

354
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,470
l can't answer that.

355
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,630
You'll have to ask him.

356
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,790
<i>Today I spent all day in the studio</i>
<i>making a new Arcimboldo.</i>

357
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,030
<i>It's terrible but I find this activity</i>
<i>as exciting as ever,</i>

358
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,430
<i>and I'll probably never understand why.</i>

359
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,020
SURREALlSM
AGAlNST THE TlDE

360
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,830
At the end of the '60s,
especially with the Prague Spring,

361
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,550
we were able to organise one or two exhibitions
and publish a few things.

362
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,350
Then with the Soviet occupation
the group went back underground.

363
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,750
Here there was a big table

364
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,500
and we would sit here with the group.

365
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,790
The whole house was given over
to our surrealist activities.

366
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,030
The whole house almost all the time.

367
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,230
There was always someone sleeping there.

368
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,980
We had meetings every week.

369
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,700
We did that for years,
until the revolution.

370
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,990
Before, when we met in a cafe,

371
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,470
we could be sure that at the third meeting,

372
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,820
not the second but the third,

373
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,190
that at the next table

374
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,510
there would be a man in an raincoat

375
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,230
drinking beer slowly,

376
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,390
without looking at us.

377
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,150
So we said, 'We can't talk here.

378
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,870
We'll meet at the house.'

379
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,550
To a certain extent,
we were against Stalinism

380
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,750
as well as against other dissidents.

381
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,060
We were involved,
we communicated

382
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,030
with Havel, for example,

383
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,750
and with dissidents

384
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,950
who now hold political posts.

385
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,590
For 20 years

386
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,070
we illegally created
the real Czech culture.

387
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,460
When the totalitarian system
came to an end,

388
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,070
everyone dispersed.

389
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,030
Dissidents dispersed,
the underground movement broke up,

390
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,640
but the surrealist group stayed together.

391
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,670
ln the '50s

392
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,190
l had a manual and on the back page
there was a portrait of Gottwald,

393
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,830
who was the President
of Czechoslovakia,

394
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,870
as well as a portrait of Stalin.

395
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,430
For me these two men
were personal enemies

396
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,550
because they endangered
my family and my future.

397
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,790
l come from a rich family

398
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,630
and my only prospect was
to become a chimney sweep...

399
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,470
or a miner

400
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,550
and something else like that.
l can't remember.

401
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,830
Equally ghastly.

402
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,910
l'm a hard worker,

403
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,870
l don't mind crawling into a chimney
or digging coal. That's OK by me.

404
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,590
But what l objected to was the terrible...

405
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,190
deculturisation of society

406
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,100
and l felt despair at the idea

407
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,220
that one day someone might wrestle
my pencil or pen out of my hand.

408
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,840
l left school at 14 and said to myself

409
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,190
that no-one would ever snatch my pen off me.

410
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,430
lt was hard, but no-one ever did.

411
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,390
The regime has changed

412
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,390
and for ten years people have been
encouraged to be interested only in money.

413
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,950
lt's the same thing.

414
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,900
Whenever l say l'm a surrealist

415
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,550
l get pitying looks...

416
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,430
People think, 'Those poor people
who lived under communist rule,

417
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,070
they don't know that surrealism
is no longer fashionable.'

418
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,150
They tolerate my declaration

419
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,310
but as soon as we start discussing it,

420
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,630
especially with young people,

421
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,630
they start getting interested

422
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,150
because they understand there's more to it

423
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,910
than Salvador Dalí's paintings.

424
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,030
Young people
are interested in my films.

425
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,910
They realise
that there's more to surrealism

426
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,630
than they've learnt at school
and been told about.

427
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,790
They say to themselves,

428
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,190
'lf that's what surrealism is,

429
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,070
then it's not dead,
because l'm interested in it.'

430
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,870
FOOD

431
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,180
l was a very thin child
who needed to be fed constantly.

432
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,620
l was forced to eat,

433
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:12,110
l was sent to camps to be fed.

434
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:19,100
The only aim of these camps
was to force-feed kids.

435
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,590
lt was terrible.

436
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,110
lf a child put on a kilo in a week,

437
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,350
they got a sweet.

438
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,030
So each week
before we were weighed,

439
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,670
we drank loads of water
so as to put on a kilo.

440
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,190
Of course this was in collaboration
with the political regime

441
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,310
which was there to help everyone,
including skinny children.

442
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,390
lt was terrible.

443
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,430
We were kids separated from our families

444
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,350
and we spent two months there

445
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,870
at the hands of women
who force-fed us constantly.

446
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,270
They even refused to put me
in the top class

447
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,270
because l was too thin.

448
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,790
l even ended up in a wheelchair
because l couldn't walk any more.

449
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,750
lt was a traumatic experience

450
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,340
and of course l used it in my films.

451
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,590
The meal is naturally symbolic.

452
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,540
Food and eating are symbols of...

453
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,590
human aggressiveness.

454
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:47,550
And yet it was only when l had finished
writing the screenplay for <i>Little Otik</i>

455
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,750
that l realised that the whole film
was about my obsession with food.

456
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,460
<i>Otik, drop that! Don't eat that!</i>

457
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,390
We're going to add a bit more bark

458
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,110
to make it more realistic.

459
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,910
Then we'll do a close-up with the teeth.

460
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,150
But l don't have any rational control
over my obsessions.

461
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,990
They behave in an irrational way
and do what they want to do.

462
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,910
Otesánek could of course
also represent our unconscious.

463
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:46,920
We know that fairytales
start out as myths -

464
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,230
either cosmic myths

465
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,380
or social myths,
but myths all the same.

466
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,190
Otesánek is definitely an archetype.

467
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,830
And that's what interests me,

468
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,510
going to the root of what
Otesánek embodied for people.

469
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,430
He's not just a monster who scares kids.

470
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,430
EROTlClSM

471
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,070
Eva has made all these dolls.

472
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,190
They're the main characters
for the film <i>Conspirators of Pleasure</i>

473
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,270
Can you hold it there?

474
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,550
This one's a travelling lady,

475
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,390
like the inflatable dolls

476
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,140
or the dummies that
men get themselves in prisons.

477
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,950
Mr Pivoine, the character in the film,

478
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,790
got himself a doll made
in the image of his neighbour.

479
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,910
And she made a doll of him.

480
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,030
They play out their sadomasochistic
relationship through these figurines.

481
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,790
Erotic fantasies
are figments of the imagination

482
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,950
and generally they aren't played out...

483
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,190
at the level of what we view as sexuality.

484
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,140
These are purely imaginative perversions.

485
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,870
That's why l so meticulously,

486
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,190
almost in a documentary-like fashion,

487
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,390
record the lengthy preparation

488
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,310
to show what people are willing to do

489
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,590
to satisfy their erotic fantasies -

490
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,470
what they're prepared
to be subjected to.

491
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,630
lt's clear that for lots of people

492
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,750
television has become
the only contact they have with the world,

493
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,550
including with eroticism.

494
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,750
l don't know if it's the same in France,

495
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:13,310
but there are erotic films
on Czech television every Saturday night.

496
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,990
Television is the only contact
a lot of people have with the real world

497
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,830
and represents the only reality they know.

498
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:29,350
Clearly, it targets this type of civilisation,

499
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,390
communication of a bawdy kind.

500
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,670
TACTlLlSM

501
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,150
<i>Tactile game</i>

502
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,550
<i>We buy four wooden rolling pins.</i>

503
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,300
<i>We cover one half of a rolling pin</i>
<i>with grains of uncooked rice</i>

504
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,110
<i>and the other half with the scahes</i>
<i>from a broken pine cone.</i>

505
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,590
<i>We get undressed</i>

506
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,830
<i>and so as to heighten the sensibility</i>
<i>of the skin on the stomach and thighs,</i>

507
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,310
<i>we brush it with emery paper.</i>

508
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,070
lt's quite arousing.

509
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,830
And here...

510
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,260
l'm touching a kitten.

511
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,700
l'm putting my hand in its mouth
and it's licking me.

512
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,950
Touch is the first sense
to develop in humans,

513
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,950
even before they see or listen,
they feel the mother's body.

514
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,150
So it is a very important sense

515
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,550
which has never been
shaped in an aesthetic form.

516
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:06,430
lt hasn't been developed
in the same way as sight or hearing,

517
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,310
which have their own forms
of art and poetry.

518
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,510
Watch that she doesn't bite.

519
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,910
And there...

520
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,470
There l'm touching someone's nose.

521
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,150
Touch is always constrained
by utilitarian functions.

522
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,030
l wanted to instigate new research

523
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,980
with the aim of developing
new possibilities for touch.

524
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,460
l wrote a tactile poem
called 'Beside the Tactile Sea'

525
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,380
because we are merely at the edge
of this unexplored ocean.

526
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,630
That's how it's meant to be read.

527
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,670
There's a word,
then a tactile element.

528
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,070
Then more words,
then another tactile element, etc.

529
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,630
These are the tactile objects.

530
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,910
l call it the 'new eroticism'.

531
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,310
lt's for autosexuality.

532
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,030
This is obviously how you use it.

533
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,590
And this one like this.

534
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,260
We know that in its utilitarian function
sight is closely linked to touch.

535
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,990
So sight can serve
as an intermediary for touch,

536
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,910
through imagination,
not in the natural world.

537
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,550
lt opens up new opportunities.

538
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,990
That's what l used
in <i>Conspirators of Pleasure</i>

539
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,030
when they use tactile rolling pins.

540
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,630
l think many people
through their eyes

541
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,830
sensed the rolling pins as if they were
being used on their own bodies,

542
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,180
thanks to the imagination.

543
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,550
l see this as the future for tactile films,

544
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,910
rather than handing out
objects to be touched.

545
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:08,510
For me tactilism is something
very sexual, terribly private...

546
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,430
Jan has opened up a secret chamber

547
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,260
and l have never fully come
to terms with it.

548
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,310
Every time...

549
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,310
it still shocks me.

550
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,190
l wrote the text before making the object.

551
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,630
First l expressed my feelings in words,

552
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,990
the tactile impressions
l would have had

553
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,030
when l put my hand inside Eva.

554
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,940
<i>In the bottom corner</i>
<i>there will be pieces of broker glass,</i>

555
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,150
<i>which mean that you heave</i>
<i>Eva's portrait feelling wounded.</i>

556
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,100
Have you touched your tactile portrait?

557
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,990
l read the notes. That was enough.

558
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,790
lmagine if there had been
a mouse in there.

559
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,510
No, thank you.

560
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,550
<i>Eva and Jan have just finished making</i> Little Otík.

561
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,310
<i>Already in the preparation</i>

562
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,110
<i>an international exhibition</i>
<i>with the various surrealist groups,</i>

563
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,460
<i>a film about the life</i>
<i>of the Marquis de Sade,</i>

564
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,670
<i>several cartoons inspired</i>
<i>by popular Czech fairytales,</i>

565
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,070
<i>a fantasy crockery set,</i>

566
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,110
<i>and busts and portraits of their friends,</i>

567
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,430
<i>a series of new tactile collages,</i>

568
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,430
<i>the publication of a monograph</i>
<i>and a collection of poems,</i>

569
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,940
<i>an anthology of subversive literature,</i>

570
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,990
<i>the conversion of an old barn</i>
<i>into a gothic castle.</i>

571
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,030
We'd like to thank everyone,

572
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,830
particularly Eva Svankmajerová
and Jan Svankmajer

573
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,000
for their availability, kindness and patience
throughout this project.
