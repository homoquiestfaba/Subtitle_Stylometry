IS EXTREMELY ADAPTABLE

McDONALD'S IS PRETTY CLOSE

334
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:37,750
DO YOU EVER HAVE
SUPERSIZED COKES?

335
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,752
NO, IN FRANCE...

336
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:45,758
CE.
THE SMALL SIZE HER
E, IT'S A BIGGER SIZE IN FRAN

337
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:48,261
EVEN THE SMALL SIZE HE
RE, I CAN'T DRINK.

338
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,763
THERE ARE RULES
TO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE

339
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:51,764
IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS.

340
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:55,268
I WILL ONLY SUPER-SIZE IT
IF THEY ASK ME.

341
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:56,769
I CAN ONLY EAT THINGS
THAT ARE FOR SALE

342
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,271
.
OVER THE COUNTER AT McDONALD'S

343
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,772
WATER INCLUDED.

344
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:01,774
IF McDONALD'S DOESN'T SELL IT,
I CAN'T EAT IT.

345
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:03,776
I HAVE TO HAVE
EVERYTHING ON THE MENU

346
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:05,778
AT LEAST ONCE
OVER THE NEXT 30 DAYS,

347
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:08,281
AND I HAVE TO HAVE
THREE SQUARES A DAY --

348
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:09,782

BREAKFAST, LUNCH, AND DINNER

349
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:11,284
NO EXCUSES.

350
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:12,785
OH, I LOVE BIG MACS.

351
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:14,787
E
THIS IS PROBABLY
THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIM

352
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,290
THAT I'VE SEEN A BIG MAC
THAT LOOKS LIKE THE PICTURE,

353
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,792
THAT ACTUALLY ALMOST
LOOKS LIKE THE PICTURE.

354
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:20,793
LOOK AT THAT.

355
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:23,796
BIG MACS NEVER LOOK THIS GOOD.

356
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:27,300
YOU GOT TO COME TO CHINATOWN
FOR THE GOOD BIG MACS.

357
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,801
MMM.

358
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:45,117
YOU'VE HEARD
ABOUT ALL THESE PEOPLE

359
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:47,119
WHO ARE SUING
THESE FAST-FOOD COMPANIES.

360
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,621
YES, I'VE HEARD OF THEM.

361
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,122
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS,

362
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:56,128
BUT IT'S THE AMERICAN 
WAY TO SUE FOR EVERYTHING.

363
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:59,131
I'D THROW THE LAWSUIT OUT
IF I WAS A JUDGE.

364
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:00,633
AND LIKE I WAS SAYING,

365
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,136
IF THESE FAST-FOOD PLACES
CAN PUT THEIR SIGNS UP,

366
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:07,139
IF I CAN WALK BY THEM
AND JUST TOTALLY IGNORE THEM

367
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,642
AND SAY, "I'M NOT HUNGRY.
I DON'T NEED THIS,"

368
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:11,644
THEY CAN DO IT, TOO.

369
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:14,146
.
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE. W
E DON'T HAVE TO SHOP WITH THEM

370
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,649
WE CAN EASILY GO IN McDONALD'S
AND GRAB A SALAD,

371
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:17,650
BUT WE CHOOSE NOT TO.

372
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,153
NOW, IF THE McDONALD'S
REFUSED THEM SERVICE,

373
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:25,157
THEY'D BE IN COURT AGAIN SAYING,
"WE WERE REFUSED SERVICE."

374
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:28,160
SO YOU CAN'T WIN IF YOU TR
Y IN THIS WORLD.

375
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,163
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS
ON THE FAST-FOOD COMPANIES

376
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:33,165
BECAUSE THEY ARE MENTIONED MOR
E

377
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,668
THAN VIRTUALLY
ALL THE OTHER CAUSES

378
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:38,170
IN MOST OF THE ARTICLES
AND BOOKS AND STUDIES

379
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,172
ABOUT WHY IT'S
A SUDDEN EPIDEMIC.

380
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:42,675
AGAIN, IT CAN'T BE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANT.

381
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:44,677
WE'VE HAD
NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANTS

382
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:45,678
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

383
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:47,680
IT CAN'T BE THE FOODS
WE EAT AT HOME.

384
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,182
WE'VE BEEN EATING AT HOME
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

385
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:52,184
SOMETHING IS VERY DIFFERENT.

386
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:57,189
I THINK THE FIGURE IS WE EAT OUT
SOMETHING LIKE 40% OF OUR MEALS.

387
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:59,191
Morgan: JOHN BANZHAF
IS CURRENTLY SPEARHEADING

388
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,693
THE ATTACKS
AGAINST THE FOOD INDUSTRY,

389
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,194
ADVISING MANY OF THE LAWYERS

390
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:04,196
WHO ARE CURRENTLY
GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS.

391
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:05,698
PEOPLE SAY HE'S CRAZY,

392
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:07,700
BUT THAT'S WHAT
THEY USED TO SAY ABOUT HIM

393
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,202
WHEN HE FIRST SUED
THE TOBACCO COMPANIES...

394
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:12,204
UNTIL HE WON.

395
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:14,707
I THINK IN TERMS
OF RESPONSIBILITY,

396
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:17,710
IT'S FAIR TO POINT
THE BIG GUN AT McDONALD'S.

397
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,212
McDONALD'S IS
ONE OF THE BIGGEST

398
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:23,716
BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
IT IS THE ONE WHICH,

399
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:27,219
FAR MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS
, LURES IN YOUNG CHILDREN.

400
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,724
.
THEY HAVE THE PLAYGROUNDS,
THE CLOSED, INDOOR PLAYGROUNDS

401
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,726
.
MANY PLACES,
THERE ARE NO OTHER PLAYGROUNDS

402
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:35,227
YOU'VE GOT TO
TAKE YOUR KID THERE.

403
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:37,229
SO EVEN AT 2 AND 3 AND 4,

404
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:40,232
THOSE KIDS ARE BEING
LURED INTO THERE.

405
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,234
McDONALD'S IS VERY HEAVY
ON BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

406
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:44,737
THEY, OF COURSE,
PIONEERED THE HAPPY MEALS,

407
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:46,238
O
NOW THE MIGHTY KIDS' MEALS ALS

408
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,741
WITH THOSE LITTLE
"GOTTA HAVE 'EM" TOYS.

409
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,242
SO THEY GET THE KIDS IN.

410
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:53,245
AND, OF COURSE, THE WHOLE CLOWN.
McDONALD'S HAS THE CLOWN.

411
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:55,748
A LOT OF THOSE ADS
APPEAL PRIMARILY TO KIDS.

412
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:58,250
THERE'S A CARTOON ON TV
WHICH FEATURES HIM.

413
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,253
SO THEY, MORE THAN OTHERS,
LURE THE KIDS IN.

414
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:04,757
I THINK ALL OF US ARE FAR MORE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE KIDS.

415

S
Morgan: ANOTHER MAN
WHO IS WORRIED ABOUT THE KID

416
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,260
IS SAMUEL HIRSCH.

S WHO ARE SUING McDONALD'S,

418

WITH MUCH ADVISEMENT
COMING FROM PROFESSOR BANZHAF.

419
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:18,270
WHY ARE YOU SUING
THE FAST-FOOD ESTABLISHMENT?

420
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,774
YOU MEAN MOTIVES BESIDES
MONETARY RECOMPENSATION?

421
00:19:21,774 --> 00:19:24,777
YOU MEAN YOU WANT
TO HEAR A NOBLE CAUSE?

422
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:26,278
IS THAT IT?

423
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,281
UM...

424
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:30,783
I THINK THAT FAST FOODS

425
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:33,786
ARE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR
TO THIS EPIDEMIC.

426
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:35,788
Morgan: IN 2000,
DR. DAVID SATCHER

427

BECAME THE FIRST SURGEON GENERAL

428
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,291
TO DRAW ATTENTION
TO THE OBESITY CRISIS,

429
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,293
DECLARING IT
A NATIONAL EPIDEMIC.

430
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:45,798
NOW, REMEMBER,
WE'RE SUPER-SIZING EVERYTHING.

431
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:48,801
YOU GO TO ANY FAST FOOD STORE,

432
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:52,304
AND THEY'RE TRAINED TO TELL YO
U TO BUY A BIGGER SIZE.

433
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,307
.
FOR FIVE CENTS MORE,
YOU CAN GET THE SUPER SIZE

434
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:58,310

WILL DEFINE A PIECE OF MEAT,

435

THREE OUNCES OF MEAT,
AS A SENSIBLE PORTION,

436
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:02,815
AND THAT LOOKS LIKE
A DECK OF CARDS.

437
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:05,818
FEW PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE
TO FIND THIS DECK OF CARDS

438
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:08,821
IF THEY WERE SERVED A PIECE OF
MEAT, A STEAK, IN A RESTAURANT
.

IS GOING TO COMPRISE
FIVE SERVINGS OF BREAD.

443
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:21,834
WHEN FAST FOOD COMPANIES
FIRST OPENED,

444
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,336
THEY GENERALLY
INTRODUCED ONE SIZE.

445
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:26,839
FOR EXAMPLE,
ONE SIZE FRENCH FRIES

446
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:30,342
WHEN McDONALD'S FIRST OPENED
, CALLED "FRIES."

447
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:33,345
THAT SIZE FRIES
IS NOW CALLED "SMALL."

448
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:37,349
.
MEDIUM, LARGE, AND SUPERSIZE

449
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,352
THAT ORIGINAL SIZE
IS STILL HERE.

450
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:41,854
IT'S GOT ABOUT 200 CALORIES.

451
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:45,357
BUT THE SUPER SIZE IS GONN
A PACK IN OVER 600 CALORIES.

452
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:47,359
WHEN BURGER KING FIRST OPENED,

453
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,863
THEY HAD A 12-OUNCE SMALL
AND A 16-OUNCE LARGE.

454
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:52,364
.
THIS 12-OUNCE IS NOW KIDDY

455
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:54,867
THE 16-OUNCE IS NOW THE SMALL...

456
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,870

THE MEDIUM, THE 32, AND THE 42

457
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,873
AND THIS IS ACROSS THE BOARD
WITH ALL FAST-FOOD PLACES.

458
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:03,876
CARS HAVE INTRODUCED
LARGER CUPHOLDERS

TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE HUGE
7-ELEVEN DOUBLE GULPS,

DID YOU WANT LETTUCE
AND MAYONNAISE ON ALL OF THEM?

670
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:34,439
I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY HARD
FOR OVERWEIGHT TEENAGERS

671
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,441
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
GOING TO SEE

00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:38,443
THE THIN, PRETTY,
POPULAR GIRLS,

673
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:40,445
AND YOU CAN'T HELP
BUT LOOK AT THEM

674
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:43,949
"
AND THINK, "I WISH I WAS HER,"
OR, "I WISH I COULD HAVE THAT.

675
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:48,954
AND IT'S DEPRESSING.
IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE CRAP.

676
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:51,456
THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS,

677
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:54,459
AND OF COURSE
IT'S HARD BEING A TEENAGER

678
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:57,963
BECAUSE YOU SEE ALL THE GIRL
S IN THECOSMOGIRL

679

ORTEEN PEOPLE,
AND THEY'RE ALL BEAUTIFUL,

680
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:05,470
AND YOU THINK, "AREN'T I
SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE THAT?"

681
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,472
AND IT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC.

682
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:10,475
IT'S NOT A REALISTIC
WAY TO LIVE.

OBVIOUSLY,
IT WASN'T DOING DRUGS.

I WOUND UP WEIGHING 425 POUNDS

OF THE GREATEST --

I STARTED
PUTTING MY WEIGHT

, ABOUT THIRD OR FOURTH GRADE.

TO KNOW SOMEBODY

TALK ABOUT ACTUALLY
BEING WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW

AND IT'S KIND OF HARD

720
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:43,101
BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD
TO GO THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY

TWO TIMES A DAY,

THE ONLY SOLUTION.

AND I'VE TRIED OTHER WAYS,
AND IT'S KIND OF HURT MY BOD

FROM DOING OTHER WAYS
THAT I'VE TRIED TO DO.

728
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:05,123

TO, LIKE, LOOK AT SOMEONE

WHO SAYS, "HEY, I'VE DONE IT
. YOU CAN DO IT."

Robbins:
I'D BEEN SICK AS A KID.

732
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:13,131
I GREW UP EATING
A LOT OF ICE CREAM,

733
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:14,632
MORE THAN YOU CAN BELIEVE.

734
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:18,136
WE HAD AN ICE-CREAM-CONE-SHAPE
D SWIMMING POOL IN OUR BACKYARD.

735
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:22,140
WE HAD A COMMERCIAL FREEZER WITH
NOT ONLY ALL 31 FLAVORS IN IT,

736
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,643
BUT ALL EXPERIMENTAL FLAVORS
THAT WERE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

737
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,146
AND I MADE MYSELF
THE OFFICIAL TASTER.

738
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:30,648
I HAD TO APPROVE EVERYTHING,
IN MY MIND.

739
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:33,651
AND I LOVED IT.
WHAT KID WOULDN'T?

740
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:36,154
I LITERALLY
HAD UNLIMITED ICE CREAM.

741
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:38,156
I ATE ICE CREAM FOR BREAKFAST.

742
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:40,158
BUT I WAS SICK A LOT.

743
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:42,660

AND I WASN'T VERY ATHLETIC

744
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,662
I WAS REALLY ILL.

745
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:46,664
AND I DIDN'T FEEL GOOD.

746
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:49,167
SO I WOULD KIND OF APPEASE THA
T BY EATING MORE ICE CREAM.

AND WHEN HE DIED,
AS A YOUNG MAN, I ASKED MY DAD

"DO YOU THINK
THERE COULD BE A CONNECTIO

AND THE AMOUNT
OF ICE CREAM HE WOULD EAT?

"NO, HIS TICKER JUST GOT TIRED

760
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,701

HE HAD SOLD MORE ICE CREAM

THAN ANY HUMAN BEING THAT HA
D EVER LIVED ON THIS PLANET.

762

00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:53,584
THE STUDENT
WITH THE FRENCH FRIES

1165
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:55,085
PROBABLY BROUGHT A BAG LUNCH
WITH REAL FOOD.

1166
00:52:55,586 --> 00:52:56,587
THE GIRL WITH THE CHIPS

1167
00:52:56,587 --> 00:52:58,088
IS PROBABLY SHARING THEM
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

1168
00:52:58,088 --> 00:53:00,591
OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND.

1169
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:39,630
Morgan: BARBARA BROWN
IS THE FIELD REPRESENTATIV
E

1170
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,632
FOR SODEXHO, ONE OF
THE COUNTLESS LOWEST BIDDERS

1171
00:53:41,632 --> 00:53:43,634
THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS
HAVE FARMED OUT

1172
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:45,636
THE FEEDING OF YOUR CHILDREN TO.

1173
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:48,138
SODEXHO SERVICES MORE THAN
400 K-12 SCHOOL DISTRICTS

1174
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:50,140
NATIONWIDE EVERY DAY,

1175
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,143
PROVIDING QUALITY FOOD LIK
E LITTLE DEBBIE SNACK CAKES,

1176
00:53:53,644 --> 00:53:55,646
GATORADE, AND CANDY BARS
TO YOUR CHILDREN.

1177
00:53:55,646 --> 00:53:57,147
THEY ALSO OPERATE PRISONS

1178
00:53:57,147 --> 00:53:59,650
AND FEED THOUSANDS
OF INMATES WORLDWIDE.

1179
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:04,154
Brown: PART OF OUR POSITIO
N IS THAT WE'RE HOPING

1180
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:06,156
THAT THROUGH
NUTRITION EDUCATION,

1181
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:09,660
THE STUDENTS WILL LEARN
TO MAKE THE RIGHT FOOD CHOICES

1182
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:15,165
WITHOUT RESTRICTING
WHAT THEY CAN PURCHASE.

1183
00:54:15,165 --> 00:54:18,168
Morgan: AT THIS MIDDLE SCHOO
L IN BECKLEY, WEST VIRGINIA,

1184
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:20,671
THE SCHOOL LUNCHES DON'T HAVE
THE FLAIR THEY DO IN ILLINOIS.

1185
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,673
THIS SCHOOL DOES NOT OUTSOURCE
THEIR FOOD SERVICE,

1186
00:54:23,173 --> 00:54:25,175
BUT THEY ARE ON THE FEDERA
L SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM,

1187
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:28,679
PROVIDING USDA REIMBURSABL
E MEALS TO THE STUDENTS,

1188
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:32,683
.
MOST OF WHICH ARE REHEATED
, RECONSTITUTED PACKAGED FOODS

1189
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:35,185
SOME DAYS THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES
IN EACH MEAL TOPS 1,000.

1190
00:54:35,185 --> 00:54:37,688
D
Morgan: SO, THE USDA
SENDS THIS FOO

1191
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:39,189
FOR YOU
TO PREPARE FOR KIDS.

1192
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,692
Glover: RIGHT.
WELL, NOT ALL OF IT, NOW.

1193
00:54:41,692 --> 00:54:47,197
YOU'VE GOT SLOPPY JOE
BAR-B-QUE SAUCE WITH PORK.

1194
00:54:47,297 --> 00:54:48,365
FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

1195
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:50,867
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO COO
KS ACTUALLY COOKING
?

1196
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:53,370
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
TOO MANY WHINY PEOPLE.

1197
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,372
THEY DON'T WANT
TO WORK HARD.

1198
00:54:55,372 --> 00:54:56,873
IT'S EASY TO COME IN HERE.

1199
00:54:56,873 --> 00:54:59,376
THIS IS THE BEST TOOL
WE GOT RIGHT HERE --

1200
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:00,877
BOX OPENER.

1201
00:55:00,877 --> 00:55:03,380
.
THAT'S YOUR CHEF'S TOOL,
THE BOX CUTTER

1202
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,882
OPEN UP A BOX, SERVE IT,
GIVE IT TO THEM.

1203
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:08,385
ED.
LET'S LOOK AT THE THIN
GS THAT ARE ACTUALLY COOK

1204
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:09,886
HERE'S A MENU.

1205
00:55:09,886 --> 00:55:11,388
MASHED POTATOES.

1206
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:12,889
HAM.
CHILI WILL BE HOMEMADE.

1207
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:14,891
.
THE CHILI
WILL BE HOMEMADE

1208
00:55:14,891 --> 00:55:16,893
WHAT ABOUT
THE TOMATO SOUP?

1209
00:55:16,893 --> 00:55:17,894
CAMPBELL'S.

1210
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:19,396
MEATBALLS?

1211
00:55:19,396 --> 00:55:21,398
.
COMES IN A BOX
. YOU HEAT IT UP

1212
00:55:21,398 --> 00:55:23,400
,
OUT OF THE COURS
E OF AN ENTIRE MONTH

1213
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,902
6 OUT OF 36.

1214
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:29,906
YOU'RE ONLY COOKIN
G 6 OUT OF 36 MEALS?

1215
00:55:29,906 --> 00:55:31,908
APPLETON CENTRAL
ALTERNATIVE HIGH SCHOOL

1216
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:35,412
IS FILLED WITH STUDENTS WHO HAVE
TRUANCY AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS.

1217
00:55:35,412 --> 00:55:37,414
BUT THEY'VE TURNED
THINGS AROUND --

1218
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:39,416
NOT THROUGH DISCIPLINE,
BUT THROUGH DIET.

1219
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:42,919
WE WERE FORTUNATE
TO KIND OF STUMBLE ACROSS

1220
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:47,424
THIS HEALTHY PROGRAM
AS A RESULT OF SOME CONTAC
T

1221
00:55:47,424 --> 00:55:50,427
WITH NATURAL OVEN AND BAKERY
OF MANITOWOC WISCONSIN,

1222
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:54,431
AND THEY BELIEVE
IN LOW-FAT, LOW-SUGAR,

1223
00:55:54,431 --> 00:55:56,933
NON-CHEMICALLY PROCESSED FOODS

1224
00:55:57,434 --> 00:56:00,437
THAT ARE FREE OF DYES
AND PRESERVATIVES,

1225
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:02,439
FULL OF WHOLE GRAINS,

1226
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:05,442
A LOT OF FRESH FRUITS
AND VEGETABLES.

1227
00:56:05,942 --> 00:56:06,943
WE DO NO BEEF HERE AT ALL,

1228
00:56:07,444 --> 00:56:09,446
AND THEN IT'S THE METHOD
OF PREPARATION,

1229
00:56:09,446 --> 00:56:10,947
WHERE WE DON'T FRY.

1230
00:56:10,947 --> 00:56:13,950
A LOT OF BAKING
AND THEN JUST FRESH PREPARATION,

1231
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,452
AS OPPOSED TO OPENING CANS

1232
00:56:15,952 --> 00:56:17,954
OR THAWING THINGS OUT
FROM THE BOX.

1233
00:56:17,954 --> 00:56:20,957
WE GOT RID OF CANDY MACHINES
, SODA MACHINES,

1234
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:23,960
BROUGHT IN BOTTLED WATER,
AND IT WAS JUST A SITUATIO
N

1235
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,463
WHERE WE SAW A MAJOR CHANG
E IN THE KIDS.

1236
00:56:26,963 --> 00:56:29,466
IF YOU WALK THROUGH THESE HALLS,
AND YOU'RE HERE,

1237
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:31,968
THESE DO NOT LOOK LIKE AT-RISK
, OUT-OF-CONTROL KIDS.

1238
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:34,471
.
THEIR BEHAVIORS ARE BETTER

1239
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:36,473
.
THEY SEEM TO BE MORE FOCUSED

1240
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:37,974
TEACHERS WILL TELL YOU

1241
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:40,977
THAT THEY GET MORE
OUT OF THEM IN THE CLASS.

1242
00:56:40,977 --> 00:56:43,480
.
Morgan: KEEP IN MIND,
THIS IS NOT A PRIVATE SCHOOL

1243
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,983
THESE ARE THE "TROUBLE KIDS"
OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

1244
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:49,986
IN APPLETON, WISCONSIN,
THAT ARE EATING SO WELL.

1245
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:51,488
E
AND IT COSTS ABOUT THE SAM

1246
00:56:51,488 --> 00:56:53,990
AS ANY OTHER
SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM.

1247
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,493
SO MY QUESTION IS --
WHY ISN'T EVERYONE DOING THIS?

1248
00:56:56,993 --> 00:56:58,995
There's an awful lot
of resistance

1249
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:01,498
from the junk food companies

1250
00:57:01,498 --> 00:57:04,000
that make huge profits off
schools at the present time.

1251
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,503
They don't want to get kicke
d out of the school system.

1252
00:57:06,503 --> 00:57:10,006
They want to be there to addic
t the children for life.

1253
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:12,509
THE SOFT DRINK COMPANIES,
ESPECIALLY, BOAST ABOUT

1254
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:14,511
HOW THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING
TO AMERICA'S EDUCATION,

1255
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:16,012
BUT, IN FACT, WHAT THEY'RE DOING

1256
00:57:16,513 --> 00:57:18,014
IS THEY'RE DRAINING MONEY
FROM THE COMMUNITY

1257
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:20,517
RATHER THAN CONTRIBUTING MONEY
TO THE COMMUNITY

1258
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:22,018
BECAUSE THE SOFT DRINK COMPANIES

1259
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:24,020
AREN'T PUMPING THOSE DOLLARS
INTO THE MACHINES.

1260
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,022
IT'S THE CHILDREN
IN THE COMMUNITY

1261
00:57:26,022 --> 00:57:28,024
WHO ARE GETTING THE MONEY
FROM THEIR PARENTS,

1262
00:57:28,024 --> 00:57:30,527
AND INSTEAD OF THAT MONEY
GOING DIRECTLY TO EDUCATION,

1263
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:33,029
THE SOFT DRINK COMPANIES
ARE TAKING A CUT OF IT

1264
00:57:33,029 --> 00:57:35,532
AND WALKING AWAY RICH
AS A CONSEQUENCE.

1265
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:38,535
WE JUST BANNED SODA
IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT,

1266
00:57:39,035 --> 00:57:43,540
AND THE SUGAR HERE SHOWS YOU HOW
MUCH SUGAR A STUDENT WILL DRINK

1267
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,542
IN A WEEK OF JUST SODA.

1268
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:47,544
FORGET ABOUT
THE REST OF THE FOOD THEY EAT.

1269
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:52,048
N
AND SOME OF THESE COMPANIE
S ARE REALLY OPPOSING THE BA

1270
00:57:52,048 --> 00:57:55,552
.
FOR REASONS OF
THAT WE WOULD LOSE REVENUE

1271
00:57:55,552 --> 00:57:57,053
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY.

1272
00:57:57,053 --> 00:57:58,555
IT'S NOT ABOUT ECONOMICS.

1273
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:00,056
IT'S ABOUT HEALTH.

1274
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:04,060
OOH.

1275
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:09,065
THE McDONALD'S
TEXAS HOMESTYLE BURGER MEAL.

1276
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:12,068
THAT'S A --
THAT'S A LOCAL SPECIALITY.

1277
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:14,070
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A BIG N' TASTY?

1278
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,073
YES, EXCEPT THE BIG N' TASTY
COMES WITH MAYONNAISE.

1279
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:18,074
OH, THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1280
00:58:18,074 --> 00:58:22,078
I NEED THE McDONALD'S TEXAS
HOMESTYLE BURGER MEAL, PLEASE.

1281
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:25,081
?
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SUPER-SIZE IT TODAY

1282
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:26,583
OH, YES, I WOULD.

1283
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:28,585
DO A LOT OF PEOPLE
SUPER-SIZE IT?

1284
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:30,086
YES.

1285
00:58:30,086 --> 00:58:33,089
SAY YOU ASKED FIVE PEOPLE.
HOW MANY OF THOSE FIVE DO IT?

1286
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:35,091
EM.
ACTUALLY,
I GET MOSTLY ALL OF TH

1287
00:58:35,091 --> 00:58:38,094
MOSTLY ALL OF THEM?
SO YOU'RE BATTING ABOUT 100%?

1288
00:58:38,094 --> 00:58:39,596
I GUESS.

1289
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:41,598
SEE THAT?
SHE'S THAT GOOD.

1290
00:58:42,098 --> 00:58:43,099
DEBORAH'S THAT GOOD.

1291
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:45,602
FIRST MEAL INSIDE THE RESTAURANT
THAT I WENT IN TO GET,

1292
00:58:45,602 --> 00:58:47,604
AND THEY ASKED ME
TO SUPER-SIZE IT.

1293
00:58:47,604 --> 00:58:49,105
,
WE'RE GONNA KEEP A LITTLE TABS

1294
00:58:49,105 --> 00:58:52,108
,
SEE HOW MANY TIMES THEY ASK ME
TO SUPER-SIZE IT HERE IN TEXAS

1295
00:58:52,108 --> 00:58:56,112
'CAUSE TEXAS, OUT OF THE TOP 1
5 FATTEST CITIES IN AMERICA,

1296
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:58,114
TEXAS HAS FIVE.

1297
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:13,630
HERE WE ARE -- HOUSTON, TEXAS,
FATTEST CITY IN AMERICA,

1298
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,633
.
GETTING MY FIRST BREAKFAST

1299
00:59:19,636 --> 00:59:21,137
HI, CAN I HELP YOU, SIR?

1300
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:23,139
WHEN IT COMES
TO THE TOPIC OF OBESITY,

1301
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:25,141
MANY PEOPLE ARE QUICK
TO POINT THE FINGER

1302
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:27,143
AT VARIOUS FOODS
AND FOOD COMPANIES,

1303
00:59:27,143 --> 00:59:29,145
BUT THE GROCERY MANUFACTURER
S OF AMERICA,

1304
00:59:29,145 --> 00:59:31,147
A WASHINGTON, D.C.-BASED
LOBBY GROUP,

1305
00:59:31,648 --> 00:59:33,650
S
WHOSE MISSION
IS TO ADVANCE THE INTEREST

1306
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,652
,
OF THE FOOD, BEVERAGE,
AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRY

1307
00:59:36,152 --> 00:59:37,654
ARE QUICK
TO SHIFT THE FOCUS AWAY

1308
00:59:37,654 --> 00:59:39,155
FROM THE COMPANIES
THEY REPRESENT

1309
00:59:39,155 --> 00:59:42,158
AND TO REMIND EVERYONE
THAT THERE'S MORE AT WORK HERE

1310
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:43,660
THAN JUST EATING POORLY.

1311
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,663
Grabowski: WE BELIEVE
VERY STRONGLY IN OUR INDUSTRY,

1312
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:49,165
AND IN OTHER INDUSTRIES,
I THINK YOU'LL FIND

1313
00:59:49,165 --> 00:59:50,667
THERE'S A GROWING CONSENSU
S

1314
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,669
THAT THE SOLUTION
LIES IN GOOD EDUCATION.

1315
00:59:52,669 --> 00:59:54,671
WE HAVE TO GET GOOD INFORMATIO
N TO PARENTS

1316
00:59:54,671 --> 00:59:56,673
SO THAT THEY CAN
TEACH THEIR CHILDREN

1317
00:59:56,673 --> 00:59:58,675
BETTER EXERCISE
AND NUTRITION HABITS

1318
00:59:59,175 --> 01:00:01,177
AND SO THEY CAN LEAD
THE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES.

1319
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:04,681
.
WE DON'T TEACH PHYSICAL
EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS ANYMORE

1320
01:00:04,681 --> 01:00:07,183
E
Morgan:
IN THE U.S., ONLY ONE STAT

1321
01:00:07,183 --> 01:00:10,186
REQUIRES MANDATORY PHYSICA
L EDUCATION FOR GRADES K-12.

1322
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:12,689
IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE FATTEST -
- ILLINOIS.

01:00:13,189 --> 01:00:14,190
TE?
YOU GOT A HEART RA

01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,981
INTERESTING.

1976
01:30:39,981 --> 01:30:42,484
IN ONLY 30 DAYS OF EATING
NOTHING BUT McDONALD'S,

1977
01:30:42,984 --> 01:30:45,987
I GAINED 24 1/2 POUNDS,
MY LIVER TURNED TO FAT,

1978
01:30:45,987 --> 01:30:48,990
AND MY CHOLESTEROL
SHOT UP 65 POINTS.

1979
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:51,993
MY BODY-FAT PERCENTAGE
WENT FROM 11% TO 18%,

1980
01:30:52,494 --> 01:30:53,495
STILL BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE

1981
01:30:53,995 --> 01:30:55,997
OF 22% FOR MEN
AND 30% FOR WOMEN.

1982
01:30:55,997 --> 01:30:59,000
I NEARLY DOUBLED MY RISK
OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE,

1983
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,003
MAKING MYSELF TWICE AS LIKEL
Y TO HAVE HEART FAILURE.

1984
01:31:02,003 --> 01:31:04,506
I FELT DEPRESSED AND EXHAUSTED
MOST OF THE TIME.

1985
01:31:04,506 --> 01:31:08,510
MY MOODS SWUNG ON A DIME,
AND MY SEX LIFE WAS NONEXISTENT.

1986
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:12,013
I CRAVED THIS FOOD MORE AND MORE
WHEN I ATE IT

1987
01:31:12,013 --> 01:31:14,516
AND GOT MASSIVE HEADACHES
WHEN I DIDN'T.

1988
01:31:14,516 --> 01:31:15,517
IN MY FINAL BLOOD TEST,

1989
01:31:16,017 --> 01:31:19,020
MANY OF MY BODY FUNCTIONS
SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT,

1990
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:22,524
BUT THE DOCTORS
WERE LESS THAN OPTIMISTIC.

1991
01:31:22,524 --> 01:31:24,025
T
I WOULD VERY, VERY MUCH DOUB

1992
01:31:24,025 --> 01:31:26,027
THAT THESE NUMBERS
WILL RETURN TO NORMAL.

1993
01:31:26,027 --> 01:31:28,029
ALTHOUGH IT DID DROP,
IT WAS A SMALL DROP.

1994
01:31:28,029 --> 01:31:31,032
IF YOU KEPT ON THE DIET,
YOU'D DEFINITELY --

1995
01:31:31,032 --> 01:31:34,536
I KNOW THAT YOU'D PROBABLY
DEVELOP CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.

1996
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:38,039
.
...INFLAMMATION
AND HARDENING OF THE LIVER

1997
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:39,541
SHOULD PEOPLE
EAT FAST FOOD?

1998
01:31:39,774 --> 01:31:41,342
NO.

1999
01:31:41,342 --> 01:31:43,845
YOU KNOW, THE ANSWER'S NO.

2000
01:31:43,845 --> 01:31:46,848
IT CERTAINLY NEEDS
TO BE VERY RESTRICTED

2001
01:31:46,848 --> 01:31:49,350
AND BALANCED WITH,
OVERALL, A HEALTHY DIET

2002
01:31:49,851 --> 01:31:51,853
AND, OVERALL, A LOT OF EXERCISE.

2003
01:31:51,853 --> 01:31:53,354
AND THERE'S NO REASON WHATSOEVER

2004
01:31:53,354 --> 01:31:56,357
WHY FAST FOOD
HAS TO BE SO DISGUSTING.

2005
01:31:56,357 --> 01:31:58,359
FAST FOOD CAN BE NUTRITIOUS.

2006
01:31:58,359 --> 01:31:59,861
IT'S A CHEAP FORM OF FOOD,

2007
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:01,863
AND IT DOES KEEP YOU
FULL FOR A WHILE,

2008
01:32:01,863 --> 01:32:03,865
SO YOU GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH.

2009
01:32:03,865 --> 01:32:06,868
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, YOU CAUSE
SOME MAJOR HARM TO YOUR HEART,

2010
01:32:06,868 --> 01:32:07,869
YOUR LIVER, YOUR BLOOD.

2011
01:32:07,869 --> 01:32:09,871
I WOULDN'T SUGGEST
YOU CONTINUE THE DIET

2012
01:32:10,371 --> 01:32:11,372
.
FOR A YEAR TO CHECK THIS OUT

2013
01:32:11,372 --> 01:32:13,374
I DON'T THINK
IT'S APPROPRIATE OR HEALTHY,

2014
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:15,877
.
ESPECIALLY WITH
WHAT SHOWED UP WITH YOUR LIVER

2015
01:32:15,877 --> 01:32:18,379
Morgan: SO I SHOULDN'T EAT
THIS FOOD FOR A YEAR?

2016
01:32:18,379 --> 01:32:19,881
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

2017
01:32:19,881 --> 01:32:22,884
,
WE SEE PEOPLE
WHO GO ON AN ALCOHOL BINGE

2018
01:32:22,884 --> 01:32:24,886
AND THEIR NUMBERS
GO UP LIKE CRAZY,

2019
01:32:25,386 --> 01:32:28,890
BUT TO GO ON A MAC ATTACK...

2020
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:32,894
AND THEY'VE GOT NUMBERS TO SHOW
THAT IT ATTACKS YOUR LIVER, TOO.

2021
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:35,897
HONESTLY, I WOULDN'T HAVE
EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.

2022
01:32:36,397 --> 01:32:37,899
BUT IT MAKES SENSE.

2023
01:32:37,899 --> 01:32:41,903
NOW THAT WE HAVE THE DATA,
IT DEFINITELY MAKES SENSE.

2024
01:32:41,903 --> 01:32:44,405
Morgan: STILL, THE IMPACT
OF THIS INITIAL LAWSUIT

2025
01:32:44,405 --> 01:32:45,907
.
IS BEING SEEN FAR AND WIDE

2026
01:32:45,907 --> 01:32:49,410
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN NEW YORK
, TEXAS, AND SAN FRANCISCO

2027
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:51,913
HAVE BANNED SUGARY SOFT DRINKS
IN SCHOOLS,

2028
01:32:51,913 --> 01:32:54,916
AND ALL-NATURAL, HEALTHY OPTIONS
ARE POPPING UP EVERYWHERE.

2029
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:57,418
McDONALD'S JOINED RIGHT IN
, SPONSORING EVENTS

2030
01:32:57,418 --> 01:32:59,921
THAT SHOWED HOW HEALTH-CONSCIOUS
THEY'D BECOME

2031
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:02,423
AND CREATING A NEW LINE
OF PREMIUM SALADS.

2032
01:33:02,423 --> 01:33:05,426
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER,
THEY ALSO MASTERMINDED

2033
01:33:05,426 --> 01:33:07,929
ONE OF THEIR FATTEST
SANDWICHES TO DATE --

2034
01:33:07,929 --> 01:33:10,431
THE McGRIDDLE,
A PANCAKE-WRAPPED CREATION

2035
01:33:10,431 --> 01:33:11,933
THAT WON MY HEART IN TEXAS

2036
01:33:11,933 --> 01:33:13,935
BUT CAN PACK AS MUCH FAT
AS A BIG MAC

2037
01:33:14,435 --> 01:33:16,938
AND HAVE MORE SUGAR THAN A PAC
K OF McDONALDLAND COOKIES.

2038
01:33:16,938 --> 01:33:19,941
G
IN FACT, THEIR NEW PREMIUM RANCH
CHICKEN SALAD WITH DRESSIN

2039
01:33:19,941 --> 01:33:21,943
DELIVERS MORE CALORIES
THAN A BIG MAC

2040
01:33:21,943 --> 01:33:23,945
AND51 GRAMS OF FAT --

2041
01:33:23,945 --> 01:33:26,948
.
79% OF YOUR DAILY FAT INTAKE

2042
01:33:26,948 --> 01:33:28,950
,
OVER THE COURSE OF MY McDIET

2043
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:31,953
I CONSUMED 30 POUNDS OF SUGA
R FROM THEIR FOOD.

2044
01:33:32,453 --> 01:33:33,454
THAT'S A POUND A DAY.

2045
01:33:33,454 --> 01:33:36,457
ON TOP OF THAT,
I ALSO TOOK IN 12 POUNDS OF FAT.

2046
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:38,459
.
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

2047
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,963
YOU'RE SAYING "NOBODY'S
SUPPOSED TO EAT THIS FOOD

2048
01:33:41,963 --> 01:33:42,964
"THREE TIMES A DAY.

2049
01:33:42,964 --> 01:33:45,466
NO WONDER ALL THIS STUFF
HAPPENED TO YOU."

2050
01:33:45,466 --> 01:33:46,968
BUT THE SCARY PART IS,

2051
01:33:46,968 --> 01:33:49,971
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO EAT THIS FOOD REGULARLY.

2052
01:33:49,971 --> 01:33:51,973
SOME PEOPLE
EVEN EAT IT EVERY DAY.

2053
01:33:51,973 --> 01:33:54,976
,
SO WHILE MY EXPERIMENT
MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE EXTREME

2054
01:33:54,976 --> 01:33:56,477
IT'S NOT THAT CRAZY.

2055
01:33:56,978 --> 01:33:58,980
BUT HEREISA CRAZY IDEA --

2056
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:01,983
WHY NOT DO AWAY
WITH YOUR SUPERSIZE OPTIONS?

2057
01:34:01,983 --> 01:34:05,486
WHO NEEDS 42 OUNCES OF COKE,
A HALF-POUND OF FRIES?

2058
01:34:05,987 --> 01:34:07,989
AND WHY NOT GIVE ME A CHOICE

2059
01:34:07,989 --> 01:34:10,491
BESIDES FRENCH FRIES
OR FRENCH FRIES?

2060
01:34:10,491 --> 01:34:11,993
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT START.

2061
01:34:11,993 --> 01:34:14,495
BUT WHY SHOULD THESE COMPANIES
WANT TO CHANGE?

2062
01:34:14,996 --> 01:34:17,498
THEIR LOYALTY ISN'T TO YOU
. IT'S TO THE STOCKHOLDERS.

2063
01:34:17,498 --> 01:34:20,001
THE BOTTOM LINE --
THEY'RE A BUSINESS,

2064
01:34:20,001 --> 01:34:21,502
NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY.

2065
01:34:21,502 --> 01:34:25,506
AND BY SELLING YOU UNHEALTHY
FOOD, THEY MAKE MILLIONS,

2066
01:34:25,506 --> 01:34:28,009
AND NO COMPANY
WANTS TO STOP DOING THAT.

2067
01:34:28,009 --> 01:34:30,511
IF THIS EVER-GROWING PARADIG
M IS GOING TO SHIFT,

2068
01:34:30,511 --> 01:34:32,013
IT'S UP TO YOU.

2069
01:34:32,013 --> 01:34:35,016
BUT IF YOU DECIDE TO KEEP
LIVING THIS WAY, GO AHEAD.

2070
01:34:35,516 --> 01:34:38,519
OVER TIME, YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF
GETTING AS SICK AS I DID,

2071
01:34:38,519 --> 01:34:40,021
.
AND YOU MAY WIND UP HERE..

2072
01:34:40,021 --> 01:34:41,022
OR HERE.

2073
01:34:41,522 --> 01:34:43,524
I GUESS THE BIG QUESTION IS --

2074
01:34:43,524 --> 01:34:48,029
WHO DO YOU WANT TO SEE GO FIRST,
YOU OR THEM?

2075
01:34:56,537 --> 01:35:00,041
RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE THE URGE
TO EAT SOMETHING.

2076
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:03,044
WHEN IT'S THROUGH,
IF YOU STILL WANT TO EAT,

2077
01:35:03,044 --> 01:35:05,546
THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY
REALLY HUNGRY.

2078
01:35:05,546 --> 01:35:07,048
THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING.

2079
01:35:07,548 --> 01:35:09,550
?? F.A.C., THAT IS ME ??

2080
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:11,052
?? BUT I DIDN'T USE TO BE 
??

2081
01:35:11,552 --> 01:35:13,054
?? I WAS HOT, I WAS HUNGRY
 ??

2082
01:35:13,054 --> 01:35:14,555
?? I WAS LOOSE, I WAS FREE
 ??

2083
01:35:14,555 --> 01:35:16,557
?? THEN I WAITED IN THE LINE
 ??

2084
01:35:16,557 --> 01:35:18,059
?? FOR SOME BURGERS
AND SOME FRIES ??

2085

?? SUPER SIZE, THAT'D BE NICE 
??

2086
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:21,562
?? TAKE A BITE
AND CLOSE YOUR EYES ??

2087
01:35:21,562 --> 01:35:23,064
?? ROUND TWO, WHAT DO I DO? 
??

2088
01:35:23,564 --> 01:35:25,066
?? I CAN BARELY WALK AROUND 
??

?? JENNY CRAIG, RICHARD SIMMONS 
??

2090
01:35:26,567 --> 01:35:28,569
?? BUT I STILL LOVE TO POUND

01:35:28,569 --> 01:35:30,071
?? HAMBURGERS, COCA-COLA,

2092
