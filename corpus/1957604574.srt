[Jay]
I might go if Walt goes.

00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,235
[Sam] I don't know
if he's gonna come.

353
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,976
It's like he won't give me
a straight answer or anything,

354
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,240
it's like, "Yes, I will"
or "No, I won't."

355
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,460
But he's not doing either.

really fucked-up lately.

Are you coming back?
I need a Coke.

360

[Jay] No, I'm going over
to the tower.

[Sam] Jay!

362
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:52,218
I just got a weird,
bad feeling.

<i>He said it looked like one of</i><i>
those hot water heaters</i>

<i>with one of those</i><i>

<i>the kind with</i><i>

<i>And the tank was filled with</i><i>
this saline solution</i>

435
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:06,036
<i>that they kept heated at</i><i>
a steady 98.7.</i>

<i>You breathed off this</i><i>
scuba helmet</i>

437
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:10,171
<i>and they kept the inside</i><i>
of the tank totally dark.</i>

438
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:11,955
<i>After a copy of hours,</i>

439
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:14,044
<i>people would start talking</i><i>
to their dead grandparents</i>

440
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,133
<i>and say all this stuff about</i><i>
Mark Twain</i>

on the cross.</i>

442

<i>And you could hear it</i><i>
all over this mic feed</i>

443
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,964
<i>they had in the helmet.</i>

444
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:23,619
<i>Well, one day,</i><i>
this guy crawls into the tank,</i>

445
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:26,448
<i>and he just doesn't come out.</i>

446
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:29,582
<i>They just couldn't find him.</i><i>
He vanished.</i>

447
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,497
<i>So the university gets</i><i>
all pissed off</i>

448
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,803
<i>and they have to stop</i><i>
the project with the tank.</i>

449
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,023
<i>Weird, huh?</i>

450
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:38,417
<i>Dr. Boaz said they made</i><i>
that movie, </i>Altered States,

458
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,436
<i>Boy, did they</i><i>

00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,699

462
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:06,880
nothing much,
I was just gonna buy something.

463
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:09,796
Something in particular?
Or just a personal need
to move capital?

464
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:11,885
Trickle-down
micro-economics?

465
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:14,931
Or a bold move to seize
a market singularity?

466
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:16,411
[chuckles]

467
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,109
Nothing that fancy,
Dr. Boaz. Oh--

468
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,372
Max!

469
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:24,506
I was--
I was just gonna get a Coke.

470
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,596
But sometimes I do
come down here, you know,

471
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,163
just wanting
to buy something.

472
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,861
Yes.
We can't help ourselves.

473
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,297
Money is movement.

00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,125
Emerging out
of system complexity.

475
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,650
It's fluid dynamics
and turbulent flow.

476
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:41,915
Our wallets have
a predisposition toward
meaningful action.

477
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,830
An auto-poetic impulse.

478
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,919
Wow!

479
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:47,398
Wow, that makes me feel better.

480
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,665
[Max] Is that Coke in the bottle
or from the fountain?

481
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,275
Oh, in the bottle.

482
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:56,103
In a plastic bottle?

483
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:57,800
I find the drink has
a better taste

484
00:24:57,844 --> 00:24:59,149
in the plastic bottle.

485
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:02,065
Oh. Wow, you, too?
I-- I like it a lot better

486
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:05,329
in the plastic bottle than in
the can or from the fountain.

487
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,201

something to do with

long-chain
polymer off-gassing.

Wow.

00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:21,258
Compared to you, I'm loaded.
I'm a professor.

493
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:22,564
Let me spring for the Coke.

494
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:24,827
Oh, thanks, Max!

495
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,090
[coins clatter]

496
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,400
[Jay] <i>
So he gets two 20 oz. cokes</i>

497
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,315
<i>in the injection-molded</i><i>
PVC bottles</i>

498
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:35,664
<i>and we walk outside.</i>

499
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:41,365
Jay. Where you headed?

500
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,411
Oh. Over there.

501
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,849
Good, I'm going your way.
Let's walk.

502
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,085
[Jay] <i>
I wanna open my Coke,</i>

503
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,913
<i>but I notice that</i><i>
he's just holding his</i>

504
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:08,784
<i>with the cap still on.</i>

505
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:11,395
<i>I figure it would be impolite</i><i>
or something to open mine,</i>

506
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,702
<i>so...</i><i>
I just hold mine, too.</i>

507
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:15,748
[birds chirping]

508
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:25,584
<i>So Boaz and I are just</i><i>
strolling along,</i>

509
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,063
<i>holding our Cokes,</i>

510
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:29,588
<i>and it's about 3:30</i><i>
in the afternoon.</i>

511
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,416
<i>People are rolling past</i><i>
on their mountain bikes.</i>

512
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,940
<i>It's real comfortable out,</i>

513
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,594
<i>so most of the girls</i><i>
are wearing shorts,</i>

514
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:38,031
<i>so I'm trying really hard</i><i>
to pay attention to Boaz.</i>

515
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,250
<i>As he was nice enough to buy me</i><i>
the Coke and everything.</i>

516
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:45,081
[drumming]

517
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,487
[Max] Well, Jay, I'm going
over to the computing center

518
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,010
to bag some main frame time

519
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:03,491
for this little virtual reality
number I'm working on.

520
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:06,712
[Jay] Virtual reality?
What kinda VR deal is it?

521
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:10,585
[Max] Cluster Invective 2:
The Tiger Mound Incident.

522
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,196
[Jay] Wow!
Cluster Invective?

523
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,634
You programmed that?
I mean--

524
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,114
That's my favorite game.
It's super-real!

525
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:21,596
You coded that?
I mean, the cows!

526
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,598
[Max] Sure did, Jay.
And I must say,

527
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,557
this one's got a gem of
a random violence algorithm.

528
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:30,866
Line-of-sight microwave link.
I'm adding those to Cluster 2.

529
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,172
[Jay] Cool.

530
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:35,741
Aren't those for
secure point-to-point
ground communication?

531
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:37,830
[Max] Yes, and fully encrypted,
as a matter of fact.

532
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:39,701
[Jay] Wow.

533
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:44,271
If those are up, I bet that's
a complete battlefield edge.

534
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:47,274
[Max] Can't buck C-3,
my young friend.

535
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:48,841
That's the lesson
to be learned there.

536
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,324
Where you headed,
young Jay?

537
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:56,109
Why our parallel paths?

538
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,024
Why the intersecting sets?

539
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:02,376
[Jay] Actually, Dr. Boaz,
this is where I get off.

540
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,594
<i>The two of us</i><i>
are standing</i>

541
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:05,335
<i>in the middle of</i><i>
the big brick plaza</i>

542
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:06,946
<i>that's in the center</i><i>
of campus</i>

543
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:09,470
<i>that everybody calls</i><i>
"The Plaza."</i>

544
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:13,039
<i>I'm pointing across the way</i><i>
to my dorm, Foucault Tower.</i>

545
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:15,650
<i>It's just about</i><i>
the biggest thing on campus.</i>

546
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,260
<i>It's part of the library,</i>

547
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:19,001
<i>a couple of</i><i>
student computer labs,</i>

548
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,655
<i>and a big dorm.</i>

549
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,918
<i>It's my second year there.</i>

550
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:24,441
<i>Dr. Boaz is standing on</i><i>
the bricks,</i>

551
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:25,921
<i>holding his Coke</i><i>
in his left hand</i>

552
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:27,531
<i>and looking like he's gonna</i><i>
twist off the cap</i>

553
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:29,795
<i>any second with his right.</i>

554
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:32,449
<i>He's just standing there,</i><i>
looking up at Foucault,</i>

555
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:35,409
<i>which is pronounced "Foo-COH,"</i><i>
not "Foo-CALT."</i>

556
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:38,194
<i>Which is what I called it</i><i>
for nearly a year</i>

557
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:40,022
<i>before my roommate, Walt,</i><i>
finally taught me</i><i>
the right way.</i>

558
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,112
Foucault Tower.

559
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:44,940
<i>He says it the right way.</i>

560
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:48,727
I remember when they built
this thing almost 20 years ago.

561
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:51,164
The wife and I had
a picnic lunch out here
in the plaza

562
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:52,687
every day for a week,

563
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,515
'cause that's how long
it took 'em to put it together.

564
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:57,474
Incredible feat of
architectural engineering,
isn't it?

565
00:28:58,258 --> 00:29:00,129
Twenty-eight stories tall.

566
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:02,566
Houses 1.5 thousand students.

567
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:06,179
Yep, they built
the whole thing in sections.

568
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:09,095
One story units at this factory
in the Canadian Mid-West.

569
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:13,055
Pittsburgh steel,
North Carolina brick,

570
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:16,580
Texas HVAC system,
Massachusetts glass.

571
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,280
Imagine it, resting out there
on that permafrost.

572
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:22,412
Leviathan in sections.

573
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,806
Think of it, Jay.
See it in your mind.

574
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,591
They don't build a train
big enough to haul these things.

575
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:31,378
These 28 discreet quanta,
soon to become one.

576
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:32,988
So what's to do?

577
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:37,166
Air National Guard
Sikorsky skyhooks,
that's what.

578
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,952
Massive dual counter-rotational
rotor choppers,

579
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:41,649
four to a story.

580
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:43,564
112 of the biggest
damn helicopters

581
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:45,174
you'll ever see in your life.

582
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:49,483
Foucault Tower just
swept down here like
some storm front.

583
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:52,007
The kind that makes
meteorologists weep.

584
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:54,488
An architectural
Alberta clipper.

585
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:57,012
They just stacked them up, Jay.

586
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:59,014
Like the biggest damn
Lego blocks

587
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,886
you've ever seen
in your life.

588
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:04,280

[Walt] Yeah, come on up!

00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,800
[Jay] Oh, hey Sally.

608
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,586
How's it going?

609
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:01,283
Oh, I'm doing all right.

610
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:02,937
There's somebody
shooting out there.

611
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:04,591
Yeah.

612
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:07,420
I know.

613
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:10,249
<i>So then I see Sally Richardson,</i><i>
this really cute girl</i>

614
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:13,078
<i>that sits in front of me</i><i>
in my Systems class,</i>

615

<i>which I guess we won't</i><i>
be having anymore.</i>

616
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,735
<i>Sally's a redhead with</i><i>
real pretty blue eyes.</i>

617
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,956
<i>She's got a nice voice, too.</i><i>
She sings in the choir.</i>

618

<i>She's the third girl in</i><i>

<i>on the second row up from</i><i>
the bottom</i>

<i>when they get</i><i>
everybody on the risers.</i>

621
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,749
<i>Sometimes I work the call</i><i>

on her way out.</i>

622
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:35,056
<i>She's real nice.</i><i>
She always waves "hi" to me.</i>

623
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,754
<i>That could mean</i><i>
she likes me.</i>

624
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:39,843
<i>Or it could mean</i><i>
she's just acting nice.</i>

<i>two Walt simulations</i><i>

<i>One is to get some advice</i><i>
on what to say to Sally,</i>

629
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,295
<i>and the other is to</i><i>
try and figure out</i>

<i>why Walt's up on the roof.</i>

631

<i>some people in danger there,</i><i>

Yeah.

Hey, I'd love to
take cover with you,

Walt, why are you wearing

878
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:58,832
Well, police must've thought

it's pretty shoddy work when
you think about it, I mean,

00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:41,500
No, no!

917
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:43,763

I mean, hell,
you loaned me five bucks

923
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,602

asked for it back.

924

Why do you have "3X5"
written on your hand?

You know, to get some of those
note cards, you know?

931
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:19,277

get organized.

Notes and stuff.

933
00:50:20,843 --> 00:50:22,236
Yeah, I use those
for all my reports.

934

You know, I was using
so many of them, my, uh--

935

them down at the wholesale club

Walt, you don't smoke.

991
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:22,998
-[Walt] The way--
-[coughs]

992
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:24,783
The way I see it...

993
00:54:28,134 --> 00:54:29,614
don't look a gift horse
in the mouth.

994
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:30,832
These were free.

995
00:54:30,876 --> 00:54:32,791
I found them in the elevator.

996
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,316
You don't want one, do you?

997
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,145
-[radio announcer] <i>WLAW.</i>
-No thanks.

998
00:54:39,188 --> 00:54:42,975
<i>West Campus' only</i><i>
AM oldies station.</i>

999
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:53,812
[Jay] I can't believe
you shot those people.

1000
00:55:00,122 --> 00:55:02,734
They were all in the fade
anyway, brother.

1001
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:05,519
Like bad 16mm movies
from the '70s.

1002
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,828
You know, rented video
on the dash in July.

1003
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,135
[Jay] What?

1004
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:16,922
Jay, do you remember Susan?

1005
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,925
Who?

1006
00:55:19,968 --> 00:55:21,840
Do you remember when
I asked you this question
three days ago?

1007
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,149
What are you
talking about, Walt?

1008
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:31,458
We got, uh...

1009
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:34,287
We got Lone Star Beef Stew.
You want some?

1010
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:37,159
No.

1011
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:40,380
I'm still working on
my cupcake.

1012
00:55:45,994 --> 00:55:48,040
[thunder rumbling]

1013
00:55:53,175 --> 00:55:56,222
Jay, I know you're gonna have
a hard time believing this,

1014
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:58,224
I mean, especially given
the circumstances and all,

1015
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:00,182
but I'm talking
straight to you.

1016
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:01,967
I'm speaking the truth.

1017
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,186
I mean...

1018
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,233
the important thing is,
have I ever lied to you?

1019
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:12,194
No, but you've never taken an
elevator to the top of the roof

1020
00:56:12,238 --> 00:56:13,805
and started shooting people,
either.

1021
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:18,723
I'm sorry.

1022
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:21,378
That was kind of
a cheap shot, huh?

1023
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:22,857
I--

1024
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:27,122
Uh...

1025
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,475
It's okay. It's okay,
don't worry about it.

1026
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:35,000
It's like this.
I met...

1027
00:56:35,043 --> 00:56:37,611
Suze at West High.

1028
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:40,397
We were both in band together,
and uh...

1029
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,876
she played bass clarinet,

1030
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,226
and I was just learning
to play bassoon.

1031
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,359
And, uh, she--

1032
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,101
she was just about
the cutest thing you ever saw,
I mean,

1033
00:56:49,144 --> 00:56:52,974
had this really nice
red hair, you know?

1034
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:56,108
Wore it real long,
down her back, uh...

1035
00:56:56,151 --> 00:56:59,198
it was an auburn,
it wasn't that kinda
cheap-looking brassy-red.

1036
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:02,288
And uh...

1037
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:04,595
she had it in a bob, though,
through most of college,

1038
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:06,074
which, I guess,
is when you would've known her.

1039
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:07,859
Do you wanna see a picture?

1040
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:09,164
[Jay] Sure, sure.

1041
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:19,914
Walt, I can't tell who this is.
What's wrong with this picture?

1042
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:23,135
You... took that picture.

1043
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,186
That happened to everything,
you know?

1044
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:33,885
All her photos.

1045
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:36,801
I used to keep all her, uh...

1046
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:40,500
love letters to me in a--
in a big, old ammo box.

1047
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,546
And uh, uh...

1048
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:45,984
left it open one day--
One day!

1049
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,855
Rain came in
through the window.

1050
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:52,120
She wrote them all in that damn
pink felt pen of hers and...

1051
00:57:52,164 --> 00:57:54,209
they're all blurry now,
you know, like she...

1052
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:56,473
cried on them
for eight hours straight.

1053
00:57:57,169 --> 00:58:01,042
I dated this girl for
three years in high school,
you know?

1054
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:05,003
She was the first girl
I ever kissed, the first--

1055
00:58:05,046 --> 00:58:08,485
first girl I ever said
I love you to,
other than my mom.

1056
00:58:09,877 --> 00:58:12,053
Favorite drink was Diet Coke.

1057
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:19,539
Anyway, she, uh--

1058
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:22,934
she gets this big present,
from her grandparents, right?

1059
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:25,589
This trip to New York.
And, uh...

1060
00:58:25,632 --> 00:58:27,678
she's real excited about it
'cause, uh,

1061
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:29,418
you know,
she's an art student.

1062
00:58:29,462 --> 00:58:32,334
She's gonna go see
all the galleries and
studios and stuff.

1063
00:58:32,378 --> 00:58:34,598
And I was gonna go, too,
but, you know,

1064
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:36,861
my dad,
he's kind of a tightwad,

1065
00:58:36,904 --> 00:58:39,951
and I-- I couldn't get
the money together, myself.

1066
00:58:39,994 --> 00:58:42,214
So I'm driving her
out to the airport,

1067
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:44,390
and she turns to me like she's
real frightened and everything.

1068
00:58:44,433 --> 00:58:48,307
And she goes, "Oh, Gosh!
I left that overdue book
down in your room.

1069
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:50,178
Can you take it
to the library for me?"

1070
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:53,268
And I'm like,
"Sure, I'll take it."
And goes--

1071
00:58:53,312 --> 00:58:55,706
You know, she always gets so
preoccupied about that stuff

1072
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:58,404
and I didn't want her
worrying about it while she
was in New York, and so...

1073
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:01,102
I drop her off at the terminal,
and I wave goodbye to her

1074
00:59:01,146 --> 00:59:03,844
and a kiss goodbye and, uh...

1075
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:06,238
I take her book back
to the library, right?

1076
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:08,240
And I'm about to toss it
in the return bin

1077
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:09,981
with all the other books,

1078
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:12,505
and I think it might be a good
idea to, like, look through it,

1079
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,421
you know, see if she left
any note cards in there
or anything.

1080
00:59:15,464 --> 00:59:20,382
And, uh, she had stuck
the printout slip from
the overdue department,

1081
00:59:20,426 --> 00:59:22,080
circulation department...

1082
00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:25,387
in there with it.

1083
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:27,215
It's got her name on it.

1084
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:29,043
Wanna see it?
See?

1085
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:37,704
It's the only thing
left of her.

1086
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:40,881
Was only supposed to be
gone one week.

1087
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:46,017
Fucking overdue slip.

1088
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,455
[man] <i>And we know</i><i>
the speed and distance</i>

1089
00:59:49,498 --> 00:59:51,805
<i>of the furthest galaxies,</i>

1090
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:55,896
<i>and the speed it's moving,</i><i>
the rate it's slowing down.</i>

1091
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,246

like a movie.</i>

1092
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,684

1093
01:00:00,727 --> 01:00:04,035

1096
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:13,914

Fucking overdue slip.

1127
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:46,398
I called her parents.

1128
01:01:47,486 --> 01:01:50,010
They didn't know what the hell
I was talking about.

1129
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:54,449
Tried to hook up
with her roommate.

1130
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:58,236
Figuring that, you know,
she'd know something and...

1131
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:01,674
she didn't know who I wa--

1132
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,894
I mean, she acted like
she'd never seen me before
in her life.

1133
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:11,205
Uh, I'm--

1134
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,468
I'm sorry, man, I--

1135
01:02:14,905 --> 01:02:17,211
I know I'm twisting your ear
pretty bad here.

1136
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:23,391
[Jay] No. It's cool.

1137
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,221
[Walt] Okay. Okay,
yeah, 'cause I mean...

1138
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:29,354
I gotta pull in a tangent here
for this to make any sense.

1139
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:31,704
See, 'cause I'm a Whitman,
right?

1140
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,575
I mean, we've got
a family history.

1141
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:36,970
I mean,
we're real proud of it.

1142
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:38,319
We're riflemen.

1143
01:02:40,669 --> 01:02:42,236
[Jay] What?

1144
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,803
[Walt]
You know, rifleman,

1145
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:46,110
sniper, sharpshooter,
marksman.

1146
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:49,330
You know, hitter,
deadeye, crackerjack.

1147
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:55,075
I'm the latest in a long
family line of snipers.

1148
01:02:58,296 --> 01:02:59,688
My granddaddy,

1149
01:02:59,732 --> 01:03:02,909
he's always talking about
our-- our genealogy

1150
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:05,520
and all that stuff,
and, uh...

1151
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:09,655
he says that my great, great,
great, great, great, great,

1152
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:13,354
great, great, great grandfather,
Augustus Whitman, well,

1153
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:14,834
he was such a crack shot,
I mean,

1154
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:16,880
he was so legendary
all over,

1155
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:19,143
that uh, he became--
his character became

1156
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:21,623
the basis for
James Fenimore Cooper's
Natty Bumppo.

1157
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:23,364
You know,
in the <i>Leatherstocking Tales,</i>

1158
01:03:23,408 --> 01:03:26,977
with <i>The Deerslayer,</i>
and <i>Last of the Mohicans.</i>

1159
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:30,328
And, uh, my great, great,
great, great grandfather...

1160
01:03:30,371 --> 01:03:31,633
was always talking about him.

1161
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:33,548
He was a sniper with
the Confederate Army.

1162
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:38,466
He bagged four majors--
uh, four colonels,

1163
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:42,383
three majors, like uh,
five captains,

1164
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:44,951
like eight or nine lieutenants.
But his best shot,

1165
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:46,648
the one my granddad was
always talking about,

1166
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:49,695
was, you know, he's--
this guy's only like 17, right?

1167
01:03:49,738 --> 01:03:51,262
And he's up in
this big oak tree

1168
01:03:51,305 --> 01:03:53,960
and it's overlooking the
Shenandoah River down there.

1169
01:03:54,004 --> 01:03:56,397
And there's this--
there's this Union
Major General

1170
01:03:56,441 --> 01:03:58,182
and he's moving at
a dead gallop

1171
01:03:58,225 --> 01:04:00,575
right across
this big field, and boom!

1172
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:04,188
Drops him right out of
the saddle, half a mile out.

1173
01:04:04,797 --> 01:04:06,712
Half a mile out!

1174
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,586
And Granddad,
Granddad fought in the Pacific.

1175
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:12,892
And he was always telling me
about how, you know,

1176
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:14,372
he'd be zeroing in on--

1177
01:04:14,415 --> 01:04:16,722
on guys,
Japanese sentries, you know,

1178
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:18,419
by the light of
their cigarettes.

1179
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:20,900
And Dad, before he--

1180
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:23,685
before he started
to sell insurance, well...

1181
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:25,470
he was a sniper in Vietnam.

1182
01:04:25,513 --> 01:04:27,211
Forty-seven confirmed kills,
I mean,

1183
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:29,343
that doesn't even count
the unconfirmed.

1184
01:04:29,387 --> 01:04:30,823
They're really stingy
about that.

1185
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,391
I mean, you gotta
show proof. Proof!

1186
01:04:35,001 --> 01:04:37,699
I grew up with a rifle
in my hand, you know?

1187
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:41,225
But my dad,
he wanted me to be different.

1188
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,010
I mean, that's why they
named me Walt, right?

1189
01:04:44,054 --> 01:04:45,794
They figured a guy named
Walt Whitman,

1190
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:47,535
he's not gonna
grow up to be a sniper.

1191
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,538
Now, I was gonna go to college,
be a-- be a scholar.

1192
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:53,715
But I still wanna be part of
the family heritage, right?

1193
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:56,240
[Jay] Sure.

1194
01:04:56,675 --> 01:04:58,982
Yeah, I understand that,
I mean, my--

1195
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:01,027
my dad wanted me to be
a TV repair man.

1196
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:04,683
Right! So, I became
a history major and...

1197
01:05:05,292 --> 01:05:08,817
my plan was, I was gonna write
the book of our family,

1198
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:12,560
and I was gonna call it, <i>
The Delicate Art of the Rifle.</i>

1199
01:05:12,604 --> 01:05:14,388
And it-- it was gonna
have everything.

1200
01:05:14,432 --> 01:05:17,652
It was gonna have pictures,
and-- and battle diagrams,

1201
01:05:17,696 --> 01:05:21,221
and interviews, and it was
gonna have all the journals

1202
01:05:21,265 --> 01:05:23,789
that my granddad had kept
from his granddad,

1203
01:05:23,832 --> 01:05:26,487
and that guy's granddad.

1204
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:29,186
And you could go into
any library in this country

1205
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:30,839
and you could take that book
off the shelf

1206
01:05:30,883 --> 01:05:32,841
and you could
read about the Whitmans.

1207
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:38,673
It's not gonna happen now,
though.

1208
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:41,415
[Jay] Why?

1209
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:45,506
'Cause I'm on the fade, too.

1210
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:49,641
'Cause what Susan had...

1211
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:51,034
it's catching, see?

1212
01:05:52,905 --> 01:05:54,994
I call her parents
the other day,

1213
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:56,561
and it's disconnected.

1214
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,911
I look 'em up
in the phone book.

1215
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,174
Nothing, not a blank line,
not like it's been blacked out.

1216
01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:03,611
There's nothing there.
Directory assistance.

1217
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:07,441
No listing!
I call her grandparents.

1218
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:10,444
They say they're childless.
Never had kids.

1219
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:12,316
I call her roommate.
She's gone.

1220
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:14,448
I call her parents.
They're gone!

1221
01:06:15,449 --> 01:06:17,669
So I go over
to Housing Residence Life.

1222
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:20,498
I mean, I've been over to
Student Health and finally--

1223
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:22,152
I mean, Public Safety.

1224
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:24,023
And I'm finally over there
and I say, "Look.

1225
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:27,809
"I'm looking for a registered
student of this University.

1226
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:31,074
Her name is
Susan N. Dutchman."

1227
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:35,730
Couple of keystrokes later,
lady comes back to me,

1228
01:06:35,774 --> 01:06:36,993
and she says,
"Oh, yeah,

1229
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:39,125
"we got her right here
in the database.

1230
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:43,303
Susan N. Dutchman.
She's over in Foucault Tower,
room 1973B."

1231
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:48,656
Foucault Tower, right?
Room 1973B, right?

1232
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:52,573
I mean, you know and I know,

1233
01:06:52,617 --> 01:06:58,362
and everybody on this campus
with a brain and ears knows,

1234
01:06:58,405 --> 01:07:03,236
that nobody lives on
the 19th floor, man!

1235
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:19,035
The only thing I had left
was this, right?

1236
01:07:20,645 --> 01:07:22,690
The only thing left for
Whitman on the fade, huh?

1237
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:28,914
Had to make my mark,
make it real big,

1238
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:30,698
'cause I'm not gonna be erased.

1239
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:34,746
You know, it's a--
it's a virus, I mean,

1240
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:36,965
it's communicable.
I mean, it's just like the flu.

1241
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:39,925
I mean, you know how shit gets
around on a college campus.

1242
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:43,276
It's a flu with
a metaphysical vector,

1243
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,497
and a nice, long
latency period.

1244
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:57,421
Better, uh--

1245
01:07:57,464 --> 01:07:59,597
Better listen in on my...

1246
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,860

the getting's good, right?

One more thing for me, huh?

1350
01:15:55,855 --> 01:15:57,553
A little amateur photography.

1351
01:15:57,596 --> 01:16:01,078
This is my dad's old camera.
Vietnam.

1352
01:16:02,296 --> 01:16:03,733
He and his buddy,
a spotter.

1353
01:16:03,776 --> 01:16:06,387
See, snipers work in pairs,
right?

1354
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:09,521
Well, his spotter
would use this camera

1355
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,132
to help him out with
kill confirmation, right?

1356
01:16:12,176 --> 01:16:13,917
They were-- There were doing
all this shooting

1357
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,701
and pictures weren't
coming out for shit

1358
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:17,660
with this ordinary camera
they were using.

1359
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:19,836
So they hooked up
with this techie,

1360
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:21,968
who was in-country
out of Lawrence Livermore.

1361
01:16:22,012 --> 01:16:23,753
And they traded him
a V.C., uh--

1362
01:16:23,796 --> 01:16:26,364
handmade V.C. Tommy gun
for this camera here.

1363
01:16:26,843 --> 01:16:30,324
It uh-- It uses this film,
it's holographic.

1364
01:16:30,368 --> 01:16:33,850
Captures details,
you know, totalities.

1365
01:16:34,372 --> 01:16:38,550
So anyway, what a spotter does
is he scans the jungle,

1366
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,334
or the desert or whatever,

1367
01:16:40,378 --> 01:16:43,076
with a pair of real
high-powered binoculars.

1368
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,862
He's gotta look for movement.
He's gotta acquire the target.

1369
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:48,299
When he's got it,
he goes to his sniper
and he says,

1370
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:50,475
"Here's your elevation.
Here's your windage."

1371
01:16:50,518 --> 01:16:52,477
They take that shot,
you know?

1372
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,913
That's when my dad's buddy,

1373
01:16:53,957 --> 01:16:56,786
he got into doing before
and after shots, you know,

1374
01:16:56,829 --> 01:16:58,570
-for kill confirmation.
