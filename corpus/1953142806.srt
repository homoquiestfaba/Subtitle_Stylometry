1
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:41,529
<i>Late Autumn</i>

2
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,950
<i>7 Years Later</i>

3
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,359
Mom died.

4
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:41,237
Brother's will bail you out,
so you can come.

5
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,574
Will you come?

6
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,645
All right.

7
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,805
Excuse me.

8
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,515
Yes.

9
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,330
Yes.

10
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,380
Where are you?

11
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,260
On the way to Seattle.

12
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,040
What is it?

13
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,770
Want your money from Mrs. Cha?

14
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,550
Her husband looking for me.

15
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,790
If he gets her, she's dead.

16
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,120
Why?

17
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,340
The lady took his money.

18
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,070
You know her husband?

19
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,190
It's no a joke,
he is totally insane

20
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,020
He's looking for you.

21
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,490
Really?

22
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,410
Be careful,
lay low for a bit.

23
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,630
All right.

24
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,810
Well, it's called.

25
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,880
What's up?

26
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,420
Don't you know? 
You owe money!

27
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,910
Better cover for less.

28
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,940
Forget it.

29
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,750
How so?

30
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,050
Enough already.

31
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,580
There everywhere!

32
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,640
If you hide, how will I work?

33
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,510
Oh, my head.

34
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,770
We can run all over the U.S.,
but they will find us.

35
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,190
I'll be fine!

36
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,930
I've lived in the 
States for two years.

37
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,020
Don't worry about me!

38
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,690
I already speak English well.

39
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,940
You'll find new customers.

40
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,100
Wait a minute.

41
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,822
You came!

42
00:19:19,822 --> 00:19:21,153
Anna!

43
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:22,621
Hello!

44
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,193
Anna, sit!

45
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:25,890
We thought you 
would come tomorrow.

46
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,732
They were starting 
to get impatient.

47
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:30,827
You must be tired
 from the trip.

48
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:32,566
Drink your tea.

49
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:36,904
Thanks to our brother
you could come.

50
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,041
Murderers getting a 
pardon is more difficult.

51
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,306
Alex!

52
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,051
Thank you, brother.

53
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,386
Don't thank me.

54
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:51,650
Come on, drink, drink.

55
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,192
Drink it.

56
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,755
That is lost

57
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:06,662
They want to say hi.

58
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:12,604
You haven't met before, right?

59
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:14,946
Hi there.

60
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,418
Grandma, come with us.

61
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,719
I'll go with the children.

62
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:30,753
And I'll answer that.

63
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,558
And I forgot to turn
 off the stove!

64
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:36,433
You talk to her.

65
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:38,431
I'll see whats happening there.

66
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:39,766
Alex.

67
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,473
What is it?

68
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,679
I want to tell you something.

69
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:32,489
After Mom died,
the house was empty.

70
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:36,428
We decided to sell it.
We needed the money.

71
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,432
Naturally we'll
divide the money equally.

72
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,457
And you will have a cut.

73
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,269
You only have to sign here.

74
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:01,347
Would you like more tea?

75
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:04,019
Eat your cookies.

76
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:08,291
What happened to the tombstone?

77
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,293
What happened?

78
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:10,627
Will you correct it?

79
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:13,291
Well said
that can't be right.

80
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,057
How can it?

81
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:16,631
Can't fix it.

82
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:18,468
And what do we do?

83
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,864
Already labeled.

84
00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:22,171
You should correct it!

85
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:24,076
Tell me how do I?

86
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:27,537
This is important
ask Anna.

87
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:29,243
What can she say

88
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:31,217
fresh out of jail?

89
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,417
I had to take care!

90
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,350
I think you have to ask.

91
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,749
If you insist!

92
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:41,350
Anna, listen.

93
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:44,728
Because of your brother the tombstone
has the wrong birthdate.

94
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:46,498
He said he will arrange everything.

95
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,934
Anna's not my fault,
if they engraved it wrong.

96
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,494
It was your fault!

97
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,554
No matter who is guilty
it should be corrected.

98
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:59,875
The funeral is tomorrow
what do you suggest?

99
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:05,216
-You can put it with the wrong date.
- I'm not guilty ...

100
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:10,620
-You should be careful ...
- I was busy selling the house.

101
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,259
Which is more important
 the funeral or mom's house?

102
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,921
Should I cry about it?

103
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,702
How are you?

104
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,347
It's not easy to coming back, right?

105
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:46,112
I thought you would come.

106
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,020
You haven't changed.

107
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,121
Wrong.

108
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,460
I've changed.

109
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:01,857
You still look like a child.

110
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:06,136
Do you remember loving
this child?

111
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,732
What?

112
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:22,144
Time flies by.

113
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,516
Many things have happened to me.

114
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:32,331
Only for me it's always the same.

115
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:48,571
That day I went back.

116
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:51,279
-But ...
- It's in the past.

117
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,780
Hey, Wang Jing!

118
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:03,889
Coming, coming.

119
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,130
Expensive.

120
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,890
Leaving.

121
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,620
I'm leaving the money 
on the table.

122
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,870
Dear!

123
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,260
Don't hurry to leave.

124
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,180
You can stay behind.

125
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,200
The weather is terrible.

126
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,380
I'm leaving.

127
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,600
What did you say?

128
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,040
Honey.

129
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,080
Honey, what did you say?

130
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,240
Everything is fine.

131
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,790
Thank you 
don't worry.

132
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,190
Ah, yes.

133
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,020
I can.

134
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:15,087
I'm Hung.

135
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:13,470
All right.

136
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:26,358
Good.

137
01:00:39,273 --> 01:00:40,968
Good, good.

138
01:00:48,782 --> 01:00:50,841
He was a friend of my brother.

139
01:00:51,818 --> 01:00:53,877
We grew up together.

140
01:00:58,692 --> 01:00:59,852
All right.

141
01:00:59,852 --> 01:01:06,991
And I was so in love
I was ready to die for him.

142
01:01:10,571 --> 01:01:11,663
Bad.

143
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:21,042
One day he just left me.

144
01:01:24,184 --> 01:01:25,344
Good.

145
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:28,919
I married someone else.

146
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:32,654
From the start

147
01:01:33,093 --> 01:01:37,154
my husband beat me.

148
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:40,158
Bad.

149
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:48,036
I realized that I was jealous.

150
01:01:50,777 --> 01:01:52,327
I was weak and doubted myself.

151
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:02,851
Then he stopped.

152
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:05,415
Good.

153
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:10,526
One day

154
01:02:13,534 --> 01:02:15,866
my ex-boyfriend came back

155
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,397
and asked me to go with him.

156
01:02:24,444 --> 01:02:25,468
Good.

157
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:37,818
I do not know how
but my husband knew about it.

158
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:45,491
He was so angry and threatened to kill me.

159
01:02:51,171 --> 01:02:52,229
Bad.

160
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:57,975
That morning ...

161
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:20,760
I don't remember what happened ...

162
01:03:26,006 --> 01:03:27,098
Good.

163
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:45,120
Why is everything so wrong?

164
01:03:49,196 --> 01:03:50,493
Good, good.

165
01:04:53,007 --> 01:04:53,919
Bad.

166
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,718
Where are you?

167
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:46,720
You came?

168
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:49,810
Quickly

169
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,410
Theres as much as you want.

170
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:04,280
Your husband wanted me.

171
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:06,740
I Know.

172
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:08,950
Don't worry.

173
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,730
You just look terrible,

174
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,630
but you look good.

175
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,770
Your husband wants to kill me.

176
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,250
Want to stop seeing me?

177
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:32,230
Everything will be alright.

178
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:36,970
I'll give you money
to open a restaurant.

179
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,540
Let's run away!

180
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:45,830
I'm leaving.

181
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,030
Wait a minute.

182
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:58,500
We'll meet again.

183
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:01,290
I know.

184
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,400
Go on.

185
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:09,520
Go.

186
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:10,870
Quickly.

187
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:47,709
Here you go.

188
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,090
With me you were taken care of.

189
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:58,400
So silly.

190
01:10:59,250 --> 01:10:59,980
Silly.

191
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:06,674
Mom, remember this?

192
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:18,618
Taught me when I was little.

193
01:14:19,626 --> 01:14:21,321
But yours were better.

194
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:29,762
What do you think?

195
01:14:33,774 --> 01:14:35,264
Not bad, eh?

196
01:14:37,778 --> 01:14:38,802
Mom...

197
01:14:42,015 --> 01:14:44,176
Oh, yeah ...

198
01:15:03,704 --> 01:15:04,554
Mom ... look.

199
01:15:10,544 --> 01:15:11,568
Here it is.

200
01:15:12,379 --> 01:15:13,676
See?

201
01:15:14,147 --> 01:15:17,310
You see without glasses?

202
01:15:17,518 --> 01:15:18,507
Here it is.

203
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,687
Now I live there.

204
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:29,428
The weather there is very nice.

205
01:15:59,092 --> 01:16:00,855
Don't worry about me.

206
01:18:11,592 --> 01:18:15,255
Sorry, but I don't remember you.

207
01:18:22,569 --> 01:18:23,661
He is my friend.

208
01:18:24,504 --> 01:18:26,233
Thank you.

209
01:19:32,072 --> 01:19:33,596
All right. That was it.

210
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:35,239
Thank you.

211
01:19:40,914 --> 01:19:43,940
Don't worry about the money.

212
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:45,114
Brother,

213
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:46,643
Come here for a second.

214
01:19:47,754 --> 01:19:49,085
I'll be over there.

215
01:19:55,162 --> 01:19:56,925
Once mom is gone,

216
01:19:56,925 --> 01:20:00,090
you must understand the restaurant.

217
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,200
Half of it is yours.

218
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:07,532
We'll talk later.

219
01:20:08,342 --> 01:20:10,105
When then?

220
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:14,504
When will you decide
what do you want?

221
01:21:45,305 --> 01:21:47,965
Wang Jing, come!

222
01:24:31,972 --> 01:24:33,132
Wang Jing!

223
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:41,472
Anna, come here.

224
01:26:43,601 --> 01:26:44,832
What's up?

225
01:26:45,105 --> 01:26:45,935
What's up?

226
01:26:45,935 --> 01:26:47,031
Sorry, sorry.

227
01:26:47,241 --> 01:26:48,037
How are you?

228
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:50,509
It's nothing. Really.

229
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:51,911
What are you doing?

230
01:26:51,911 --> 01:26:53,072
Nothing.

231
01:26:53,347 --> 01:26:54,439
Everything is fine.

232
01:26:55,182 --> 01:26:56,513
Excuse me, excuse me.

233
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,628
Why did you use his fork?

234
01:28:57,628 --> 01:28:59,003
Can you tell me?

235
01:28:59,003 --> 01:29:01,566
Why use a fork,
since it is not yours!

236
01:29:01,566 --> 01:29:03,803
It was his! Not yours!

237
01:37:55,108 --> 01:37:56,700
Where is Mrs. Cha?

238
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:04,880
