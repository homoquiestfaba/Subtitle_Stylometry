the biggest town around here?

181
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,477
-Youngstown, Ohio.

182
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:08,722
-Youngstown? Youngstown, Ohio.

183
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:11,349
All right, well, I kind
of like the sound of that.

184
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,186
Tired of these old sleepy towns.

185
00:13:13,187 --> 00:13:14,092
-[Cashier] [laughs] Yeah.

186
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,842
-[Grifter] All right, thank you.

188
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:23,163
♪ <i>A little hand, little hand</i> ♪

189
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:23,997
-Hey!

190
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,818
-Yeah?

191
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,569
-You're goin' to Youngstown?

192
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,568
-Yes, I'm goin' to Youngstown.

193
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:32,059
-I'm going to Youngstown.

194
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,669
-Okay, well, I'm definitely
going to Youngstown.

195
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,159
-Well, maybe we could go together.

196
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,049
-All right, well, I got a ride.

197
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,109
-[Sarah] Hey.

198
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,960
-Yes?

199
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,243
-[Sarah] Where are you from?

200
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,120
-I'm from Youngstown.

201
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,559
-You're from Youngstown?

202
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,909
-Born and raised.

203
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,829
-Born and raised in Youngstown?

204
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,123
-[Grifter] Born and raised in Youngstown.

205
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,579
-I think you could help me.

206
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,309
-Well, this baby's goin' to Youngstown,

207
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,423
and, uh, maybe you'd like a ride.

208
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:09,090
[gentle music]

209
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,049
All right, let's go.

210
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,929
-[Sarah] Another white pickup truck.

211
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,187
-[Grifter] Yeah, you like 'em?

212
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,819
-[Sarah] Yeah.

213
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,019
-[Grifter] Yeah, me
too, actually, this truck

214
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,809
has a ton of torque,

215
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,391
the MSRP is incredible, and these, uh,

216
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:25,340
I don't know, these white trucks,

217
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:27,979
they just seem to have a
little bit better resale value.

218
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,029
They accelerate a little bit faster.

219
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,483
They're a little bit more dependable.

220
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,970
Canfield Fair, what's that?

221
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,469
-Obviously you're not from Youngstown.

222
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,539
-And why is that?

223
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,683
-Everyone from Youngstown
knows about the Canfield Fair.

224
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:58,834
-Okay.

225
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,679
Sure, Canfield Fair,
Ferris wheel, funnel cake,

226
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,003
lots of fun, I know the Canfield fair.

227
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,219
So you must be from Youngstown.

228
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,587
-I'm not from Youngstown.

229
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:20,920
-[Grifter] Well, then where are you from?

230
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,529
-Well, I'm part of this program,

231
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,193
and I'm not supposed to tell people that.

232
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,739
-Like the, uh, witness
protection program?

233
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,319
-Exactly.

234
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,319
-[Grifter] You're in the
witness protection program?

235
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,769
-That's right.

236
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,029
-You're definitely
not supposed to tell me

237
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,809
that you're in the witness
protection program.

238
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,129
-Right? I'm trying to
get better at lying.

239
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,753
The only thing I got down so
far is I'm not from Youngstown.

240
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,953
-So you are from Youngstown.

241
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,504
-No.

242
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,509
-Okay, you definitely need
to get better at lying.

243
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,779
The first thing you need to do

244
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,139
is you need to not tell anybody else

245
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,169
that you're in the witness
protection program, okay?

246
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,836
- Right.
- Second thing you need to do

247
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:12,289
is you need to change this whole look.

248
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,039
You're gonna need to go to the salon.

249
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,009
You're gonna need to get your hair done.

250
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,499
You're gonna need to get this whole thing

251
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,429
completely unrecognizable.

252
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,979
Do you think you can do that?

253
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,539
-Yeah, that's some good advice there.

254
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,629
I like the way you think.

255
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,463
-Thank you.

256
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:38,619
-[Sarah] Oh, this is my favorite street.

257
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,749
Belmont Avenue in my favorite street.

258
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,431
I'm so happy to be back here.

259
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:43,982
-[Grifter] What is Monteen's?

260
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:47,709
-[Sarah] Monteen's is
the kind of place you go

261
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,269
when it's Friday night,

262
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,839
and you're maybe gonna have a nice dinner.

263
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,339
Oh, Classic Optical, I got my
first pair of glasses there.

264
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,250
-[Grifter] You wear glasses?

265
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:57,529
-[Sarah] Not anymore.

266
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,633
Goodyear, you can get some tires there.

267
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,919
-[Grifter] I know.

268
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,329
-[Sarah] That's Arby's,
that actually originated

269
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,469
here in Youngstown.
- Did it?

270
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,039
-[Sarah] It was two brothers.

271
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,999
They're R and a B, and then it was Arby's.

272
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,700
Taco Bell, I got my foot run
over in that parking lot.

273
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,669
-[Grifter] Wow.

274
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,427
-[Sarah] They demolished
all that over there. Wow.

275
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,913
That used to be BJ's.

276
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,489
-[Grifter] Tim Horton's used to be BJ's.

277
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,109
-[Sarah] Great rib spot.

278
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,209
Yeah, I'm gonna pretend that
Tim Horton's doesn't exist.

279
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,789
-[Grifter] Hmm.

280
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,489
-[Sarah] This is a
graveyard on the right.

281
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,969
-[Grifter] Wow, look
at all those headstones.

282
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,839
-[Sarah] I know a lot of
people in that graveyard,

283
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,253
a lot of family in there.

284
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:46,809
Oh, Plaza Donuts, donuts and coffee,

285
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,527
they've got both of them there.

286
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:49,799
-[Grifter] Wow, both.

287
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,469
-[Sarah] Blue Ribbon dry cleaners

288
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,350
if you need somethin' clean.

289
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:53,905
Do you need anything cleaned?

290
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,739
-[Grifter] No.

291
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,459
-[Sarah] Golden Hunan,
that is my favorite place

292
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,479
for Chinese food.

293
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,909
Not the original location,

294
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,616
that's a second location right there.

295
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:02,450
-[Grifter] Looks good.

296
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:04,659
-[Sarah] Jimmy's, classic Italian food.

297
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,439
If you need some Italian
food, you go to Jimmy's.

298
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,303
-[Grifter] Good to know.

299
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,443
-[Sarah] Rally's is new.
That did not used to exist.

300
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,426
-[Grifter] Oh, some
new things poppin' up.

301
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,029
-[Sarah] If you need a jersey,

302
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,349
you just go over to Wharmby Sports.

303
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,099
You need a jersey?
- No.

304
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,493
-[Sarah] Kravitz Deli, best
corned beef you'll ever have.

305
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:27,198
-[Grifter] Kravitz.

306
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,749
-[Sarah] That's where
the original Hunan was,

307
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,000
right where that AutoZone is.

308
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:32,700
-[Grifter] Hmm.

309
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:34,639
-[Sarah] Jim Rohan Floor Covering,

310
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,883
they will cover your floors
like you would not believe.

311
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,660
-[Grifter] Nice.

312
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,839
-[Sarah] Touch of Class,
if you need to look nice,

313
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,233
you go there.

314
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:46,170
-[Grifter] Very nice.

315
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:49,519
-[Sarah] Uptown Pizza,
great place for pizza.

316
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,353
-[Grifter] Okay.

317
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:51,409
-[Sarah] You like pizza?

318
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,759
-[Grifter] It's fine.

319
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,029
-[Sarah] Well, you
would love their pizza.

320
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,399
-[Grifter] So you really know this town.

321
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,413
-Yep, and I'm not from Youngstown.

322
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,699
Okay, pull over at that
white sign up there.

323
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,550
-[Grifter] Okay.

324
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,683
-You don't know this,

325
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:08,540
but I know you're not from Youngstown.

326
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,319
-And how do you know that?

327
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,909
-I heard you in the truck stop.

328
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,003
-Huh, interesting.

329
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,263
-Why do you wanna go to Youngstown?

330
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:24,150
-Big city, prizes, seems
like somethin' fun to do.

331
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,999
-Okay.

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,629
Meet me at Plaza Donuts in two hours.

333
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,889
-Okay.

334
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,383
-Okay, yeah, right here.

335
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:41,483
Thanks.

336
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
-Hello.

337
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,113
-Hello.

338
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:55,649
-Welcome to New Dawn Salon
and Day Spa. How are you today?

339
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,483
-Mm.

340
00:19:57,675 --> 00:20:00,063
-All right. What can I do for you?

341
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:04,669
-I need to look a little different.

342
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,869
-A little different?

343
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,639
And what were you thinkin'
about doing today?

344
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,449
-What if we dye my hair blonde?

345
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,749
-Blonde? Mm, that would look pretty.

346
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,750
Can I see your hair?

347
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,699
Blonde would look nice.

348
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,079
So to go blonde all over,

349
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,659
we would have to bleach
and tone your hair.

350
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,493
-Mm-hmm.

351
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,769
-All-over bleach and tone
for your length of hair

352
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,453
would be about $200.

353
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,409
-What if we just do the bangs?

354
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,656
- Just the bangs?
- Mm.

355
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:36,253
-And you wanna do them blonde?

356
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,299
Um, I would say

357
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,743
that we could bleach and
tone your bangs for 50.

358
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,309
-Let's do just the bangs.

359
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,179
-Okay, we do have someone available

360
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,752
that could do that for you today.

361
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:50,750
-Yeah.

362
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:51,929
-All right, I'll grab her for you.

363
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,469
We have a waiting area over there

364
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,679
that you could go ahead and have a seat,

365
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,319
and she'll be right with you.

366
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,153
Sounds good?

367
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,633
[faint upbeat music]

368
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,405
-Hi. How are you?

369
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:10,389
-I'm good.

370
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,909
-Good, so what are we doin' today?

371
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,113
-We are dying my bangs blonde.

372
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,010
-Your bangs?

373
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,843
-Yeah.

374
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,055
-Okay.

375
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:22,639
[gentle music]

376
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,720
My name's Kelly, by the way. What's yours?

377
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,999
-My name's Sarah Jayne.

378
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,267
-Sarah Jayne? Well, nice
to meet you, Sarah Jayne.

379
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:43,291
[curious lighthearted music]

380
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:48,292
Come on over here. [laughs]

381
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:59,588
I'll be back for you in 20 minutes.

382
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:04,413
[moves to suspenseful music]

383
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:36,550
We're gettin' you pretty blonde, girl.

384
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:38,801
Just be a few more minutes.

385
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:46,039
[soft music]

386
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:09,356
[moves to peculiar music]

387
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:45,215
[curious lighthearted music]

388
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:00,992
All right, I think we're ready.

389
00:24:00,993 --> 00:24:03,660
Come on over, we'll shampoo you.

390
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:10,058
[moves to suspenseful music]

391
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,878
[Kelly speaking faintly]

392
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:40,854
[birds cawing]
[distant traffic rushing]

393
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:06,811
[horn blaring]

394
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,817
[tires screeching]

395
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,163
What do you think?

396
00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:56,393
-I love it.

397
00:25:56,394 --> 00:26:01,394
-Looks good.

398
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,913
-Thank you.

399
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:05,330
-Thank you. Have a good day.

400
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,363
- Hey girl.
- Hey.

401
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,619
-How'd that go?

402
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,119
-I mean, it was interesting.

403
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,529
-I can tell.

404
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,149
I'm a little concerned about her

405
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,219
and her, "Just do my bangs."

406
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,299
-[Kelly] Yeah, it's definitely
a different look, so.

407
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,000
-[Receptionist] Yeah, I
hope she's gonna be okay.

408
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:29,001
-[Kelly] Yeah.

409
00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:33,296
[Sarah humming]

410
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:43,591
[bell dinging]

411
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:47,724
[bell dinging]

412
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,836
-Excellent, unrecognizable.

413
00:26:53,837 --> 00:26:57,289
-Great. I like your outfit too.

414
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,123
-Just got it.

415
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,799
-You want one?

416
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,633
-No, I'm okay.

417
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,624
-I love Plaza Donuts.

418
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,999
I haven't been back
here since high school.

419
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,893
-Mm-hmm.

420
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,693
-I miss that place.

421
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,423
The smell of library
books, lockers, hallways.

422
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:18,099
-Okay.

423
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,500
Okay, we can work with that.

424
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,163
Here, come with me.

425
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,162
[bell jingling]

426
00:27:27,163 --> 00:27:27,996
Come on.

427
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,789
Okay, ever seen these before?

428
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,623
-Yeah.

429
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,713
-Uh, you just might need these now.

430
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,419
-But I can walk just fine.

431
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,809
-No, you can't. Okay?

432
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,289
Now, this is what's known
as a visual lie, okay.

433
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,719
There are two types of lies.

434
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,609
There are verbal lies, and
there are visual lies, okay?

435
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,739
Now, what travels faster

436
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,209
than the sound of a lie
entering your ear hole

437
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,989
is gonna be the look of a lie
entering your eyeballs, okay?

438
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,609
You're gonna be walking
around on these crutches.

439
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,769
- Okay.
- Okay?

440
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,189
People are gonna see you comin' in

441
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,940
so red-hot clankety-clank crutching

442
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,749
that even the sound of the crutching is,

443
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,309
they know that you're crutching

444
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:15,679
long before they could even
possibly even hear it, okay?

445
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,973
This is basic walking.

446
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,279
It looks like it hurts, doesn't it?

447
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,419
-Yeah.

448
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,193
-That's a great visual lie. Okay?

449
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:23,971
- Okay.
- Now,

450
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:24,860
once you get good enough at these,

451
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:27,879
you're gonna wanna use
these like a new appendage.

452
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,199
You're gonna be at the grocery store.

453
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,779
You're gonna be saying to yourself,

454
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,009
uh, I would love for somebody to reach up

455
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,759
and grab me those sweet cookie bars.

456
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,829
Now, you're gonna reach up,

457
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,549
and you're gonna point
and say, "Oh, please,

458
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,659
somebody, do that for me.

459
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,039
Somebody, please bring that down.

460
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,899
I would be so grateful."

461
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,959
Guess what? They're not just
gonna hand you the cookies.

462
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,229
They're gonna buy the cookies for you.

463
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,749
They're gonna take you home,

464
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,919
and they're gonna give you a glass of milk

465
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,719
to put the cookies in, okay?

466
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,680
- Wow.
- Now, that,

467
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,009
if you can tell a visual lie good enough,

468
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,649
then the verbal lies start
pouring out right after that.

469
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,929
- Okay.
- Okay?

470
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,180
-So who are we lying to?

471
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,599
-[Grifter] Now, what you've
gotta do is you've got to go

472
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,573
to a place where people recognize you.

473
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:05,299
- Okay.
- Because if your lies

474
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,129
can convince them, then
you can convince anybody.

475
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,230
-[Sarah] Okay, I got.

476
00:29:13,257 --> 00:29:14,130
-[Grifter] So this is your high school?

477
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:16,869
-[Sarah] Yeah, look at
that. Isn't it beautiful?

478
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,770
-[Grifter] It's pretty good.

479
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:19,420
-[Sarah] It's the same
color outside, you know,

480
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:20,254
that didn't change.

481
00:29:20,255 --> 00:29:22,169
-All right, here are
these beautiful crutches.

482
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,003
This is for you.

483
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:26,326
You know what to do.

484
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:28,243
-I mean, yeah. It's easy.

485
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,736
-Remember, what you're
doin' in there is visual.

486
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:32,570
-Okay.

487
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:37,653
Oh man, it feels great to be back here.

488
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,389
Gosh.

489
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,223
This way.

490
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,220
Love these lockers. They repainted 'em.

491
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:49,099
They still look really good.

492
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,373
Oh, the clock's the same.

493
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:55,009
I love it here. It just feels so good.

494
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,419
You know, I feel like I
can really breathe again.

495
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,939
You know, we gotta check out the library.

496
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,346
That's where we're gonna go next.

497
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:02,379
-What happened to you?

498
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,569
-Oh, she, uh, busted her
ankle playin' basketball.

499
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,098
-Oh, that sucks. I hope you get better.

500
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,899
-Thanks.

501
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,349
-Basketball. It's that easy.

502
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,499
When we get to the library,
you do the next one, okay?

503
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,333
-Okay.

504
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:34,219
[Sarah humming]

505
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,063
-Hi. Can I help you?

506
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,399
-Yeah.

507
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,959
I was just walkin' down the
street, and I saw a squirrel.

508
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,179
So I stopped, and then I looked over,

509
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,937
and there was a banana peel.

510
00:30:49,938 --> 00:30:51,723
I slipped right on it.

511
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,429
-Wow, sorry to hear that.

512
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,187
-Yeah, it's okay though.

513
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,223
It's healing.

514
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,559
-Okay, well, let me know

515
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,909
if there's anything I can do for ya.

516
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,399
-Okay. I love this library.

517
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,233
-Well, thank you.

518
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,066
-Yeah.

519
00:31:12,481 --> 00:31:15,148
[Sarah humming]

520
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,383
Mm.

521
00:31:28,111 --> 00:31:31,361
[Sarah inhales deeply]

522
00:31:45,631 --> 00:31:48,048
[bell dings]

523
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,259
Lie, a false statement or action,

524
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,349
especially one made
with intent to deceive,

525
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,923
anything that gives or is meant
to give a false impression.

526
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,773
-Oh, green book, blue book.

527
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,623
Black book, brown book.

528
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,079
Okay, books, books.

529
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,793
So many books.

530
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:30,461
[Sarah humming]

531
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,719
-Did you find what you were looking for?

532
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,049
-I did, right here.

533
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,559
My yearbook, class of '05.

534
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,239
That's me.
- Wow.

535
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,073
-[Grifter] Pretty good.

536
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:51,399
-[Librarian] Yeah, got your haircut.

537
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,233
-[Grifter] I sure did.

538
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:53,066
- That's great.
- That's it.

539
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:54,027
-So what brings ya back here?

540
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:55,989
-[Grifter] I, uh, I'm
actually just passing through.

541
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,096
-[Librarian] Oh wow,
where do you live now?

542
00:32:57,097 --> 00:32:59,639
-[Grifter] I live in
Mission Falls, Wisconsin.

543
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,549
-[Librarian] Huh, I don't
think I've heard of that.

544
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,939
- Well--
- What do you do there?

545
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,869
-Uh, I actually just
opened up a bowling alley.

546
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,129
It's booming.

547
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,509
I have a beautiful
three-year-old son. He's great.

548
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,389
His name is Thomas. He's bouncing
around like a little baby.

549
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,519
You know what I mean?
- Oh, that's great.

550
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,939
-[Grifter] This kid just
finally got out of diapers.

551
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,609
He's completely potty trained.
- Great.

552
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,289
-[Grifter] So when I saw this
kid gettin' potty trained,

553
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,123
I'm thinkin' to myself,

554
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:20,709
this kid just took the first step

555
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,096
towards complete independence.
- Yeah.

556
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:23,269
-[Grifter] And now I'm sendin' him off

557
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,120
to the bowling alley.

558
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:25,409
This kid cleans the balls.

559
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,379
This kid's washin' the dirty
rags that the bowlers use

560
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,429
when they're wipin' off their
hands after greasing 'em up

561
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,909
to stick 'em in the three
holes of the bowling balls.

562
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,743
- Oh.
- Okay.

563
00:33:33,744 --> 00:33:35,369
And these guys come in
with these custom balls,

564
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,069
and my kid loves these custom balls.

565
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,762
Some of 'em have smiley faces on 'em.

566
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:40,799
Some of 'em have, I don't know,

567
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,973
like a bunch of swirly designs on 'em.

568
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:43,930
- Wow.
- Some of the swirly designs,

569
00:33:43,931 --> 00:33:45,479
I'm talkin' about beautiful things here.

570
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,529
They look like dang
tie-dyed T-shirts, okay.

571
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,929
- Is that right?
- That's right.

572
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,819
-Well, that's fantastic.

573
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,079
Well, I'm glad you stopped in.

574
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,029
Let me know if there's anything
else I can help you with.

575
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,885
-Thank you very much.

576
00:33:55,886 --> 00:33:57,059
- All right, have a good day.
- Buh-bye.

577
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,960
-[Librarian] Bye.

578
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,501
-Man, he's good.

579
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,158
[lighthearted music]

580
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,559
They totally believed me.

581
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,889
-[Grifter] Congratulations,
no more crutches.

582
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,165
You've graduated.

583
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,049
-[Sarah] Great.

584
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:15,882
-[Grifter] But you know,

585
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:18,869
with great lies comes
great responsibility.

586
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:22,838
-[Sarah] Yeah. Did I tell
you these ribs are to die for?

587
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:23,735
-You did.

588
00:34:23,736 --> 00:34:27,652
[lighthearted music continues]

589
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:50,504
A full rack in 10 minutes,
that's pretty good for me.

590
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,549
-I told you, to die for.

591
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,109
-Look at this construction
site over here.

592
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,609
That's a 20-man crew.
That's a big operation.

593
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,619
They're puttin' somethin' big up in here.

594
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,529
This is gonna be a new
hotspot. I can feel it.

595
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,949
-I've always loved this area.

596
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,209
-Somethin' big is comin' up.

597
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,150
-Yeah?

598
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:06,779
-Yeah, you like this area.
People like this area.

599
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,143
It's cyclical.

600
00:35:08,144 --> 00:35:10,299
Now we're fed, there anything
else to do around here?

601
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,659
-Oh yeah, there's a million
things to do in Youngstown.

602
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,509
It's really action-packed place.

603
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,789
This neighborhood is amazing.
Look at these houses.

604
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,869
Beautiful, I'd love to
have one of these houses.

605
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,703
-Yeah, these houses

606
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:21,590
are pretty good.
- Man, look at that garden.

607
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:24,359
-Beautiful flowers, beautiful
color, like a dirty green.

608
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,429
-Yeah, dirty green.

609
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,130
-Hey, what do you see right here?

610
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,269
-[Sarah] That one's for sale.

611
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,689
-[Grifter] By owner, okay.

612
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,662
Not by professionals.
- Okay.

613
00:35:35,663 --> 00:35:36,676
-Now, these homeowners, they don't know

614
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,345
how to sell houses.
- Right.

615
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:40,069
-They have no idea what they're doing.

616
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,379
A professional would get in there,

617
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,099
make a million phone calls,

618
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,359
sell that house 25% over market value,

619
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,819
make this homeowner a ton of money.

620
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,079
Now, I look at this house,
and I see a ton of potential.

621
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,913
- Yeah.
- But this homeowner's

622
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:55,199
gonna sell this house, no way. [scoffs]

623
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,469
This guy put his phone number out here.

624
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,479
He doesn't know what he's doing.

625
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,959
You gotta make calls, not receive calls.

626
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,559
I mean, come on, look at that
big, beautiful brown house.

627
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,179
Now, I don't make the rules.

628
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,013
- Yeah.
- But from the moment

629
00:36:05,014 --> 00:36:06,969
that for sale sign went onto that lawn,

630
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,582
there is a grace period
where anybody can go in.

631
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:11,879
-Mm.

632
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,713
-Hmm?

633
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,140
-What are you talkin' about?

634
00:36:17,828 --> 00:36:19,128
-[exhales] Okay, come on.

635
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,629
I'm talking about getting
in there, setting up shop,

636
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,399
helping these good people
out by selling their house.

637
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,913
These people need help,
okay, and we can do that.

638
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,800
-So do you think they left
a key for us or something or-

639
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,653
-Maybe.

640
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,963
Well, that's locked, no key.

641
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,093
- Okay.
- Great shrubs.

642
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,063
Great mulch.

643
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,683
Nice garage for a nice white truck.

644
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,145
[door creaking] Okay.

645
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,049
- Oh wow.
- Okay, okay.

646
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,039
-[Sarah] So they just
left it unlocked for us.

647
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,409
-[Grifter] Well, they left it unlocked

648
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,351
because of the grace period.

649
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:05,119
-[Sarah] Oh.

650
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,030
Okay.
- You know,

651
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,880
these people know what they're doin'.

652
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,463
-Whoa.

653
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,223
I mean, that is such a great thing.

654
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,443
-I know.

655
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,450
-[Sarah] Youngstown really knows

656
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:20,579
how to treat a person, huh?

657
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,680
-[Grifter] Love that.

658
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,323
-Wow, I'm finally home.

659
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,220
-Okay, don't forget, we
gotta sell this thing.

660
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,159
Oh my god, you gotta see this upstairs.

661
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,429
It's like a tiny little
room, but it's great.

662
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,280
-[Sarah] Ooh, let me check that out.

663
00:37:49,796 --> 00:37:52,046
-[Grifter] Okay, choose your room.

664
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:55,646
-[Sarah] Oh, yeah, this one's
my room, the one downstairs.

665
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:56,630
That's my bedroom.

666
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,610
-[Grifter] Okay, I got this upstairs.

667
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:59,069
This is where I'm gonna be sleeping,

668
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,613
and you're probably not allowed up here.

669
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:04,349
[gentle music]

670
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,469
-I love Youngstown.

671
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,739
These are the kind of
mornings I'm talking about.

672
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,309
It's pleasant.

673
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,929
The sun is shining.

674
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,423
I finally feel like myself.

675
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,259
-Blue skies.

676
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,130
- Yeah.
- Oh, look at

677
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:24,363
that barbell cloud.

678
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,033
-[Sarah] Whoa.

679
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,819
-[Grifter] I would love to
see, like, a giant pump that.

680
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,979
-[Sarah] Yeah, that would
be, that would be amazing.

681
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,159
-[Grifter] That would be cool.

682
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,479
See him start to sweat 'cause
he's pumping it so hard,

683
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,380
and then it rains.

684
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:42,139
[Sarah humming]

685
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,659
-Yeah, it's a great day. Wow.

686
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,109
-[Grifter] Beautiful day.

687
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,792
-[Sarah] I love it here.

688
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,330
-This is a great neighborhood.

689
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:51,963
-It's a great neighborhood.
The air here is better.

690
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,743
-Pretty good.

691
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:55,730
-It's excellent.

692
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,563
-Yeah.

693
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,749
This is a great kid.

694
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,272
-That's a great kid.

695
00:39:00,273 --> 00:39:01,439
- I love his look.
- Yeah.

696
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,769
-[Grifter] He's got
this classic kid look.

697
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,613
- Yeah.
- You know?

698
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:06,560
-[Sarah] He's probably really friendly.

699
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,109
-[Grifter] Right.

700
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,589
-[Sarah] This kid knows
how to ride a bicycle.

701
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,779
-[Grifter] You got that right.

702
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,979
-[Sarah] This is the kind of neighborhood

703
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,459
I'm talkin' about.

704
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,579
- Yeah, kids on bikes.
- Yeah.

705
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,329
-[Grifter] This is truly a great kid.

706
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,819
-Yeah, this kid's great. I
mean, we have to say hello.

707
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,653
Howdy, neighbor!

708
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,599
It's pretty, pretty outside, huh?

709
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,559
-Did you just move in here?

710
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,639
-Yes, and we love this house.

711
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,959
Yeah.

712
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,710
-My best friend used to live here.

713
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,943
-[Grifter] Well, what if
we're your new best friend?

714
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,860
-You're too old to be my best friend.

715
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,639
-Well, this is Youngstown, baby.

716
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,909
Ain't nobody too old around here.

717
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,743
-Okay.

718
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,774
-[Grifter] Do you think we
could really be his best friend?

719
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:52,439
-[Sarah] We could be
anybody's best friend.

720
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,179
-To be honest, knowing that that kid

721
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,639
is in this neighborhood

722
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,726
makes me feel really good.

723
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,560
-Yeah.

724
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,902
[bee buzzing]
Wow! [laughs]

725
00:39:59,903 --> 00:40:01,284
It's just a bee.

726
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:02,118
-Hmm.

727
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:08,103
[wind chimes tinkling]
[dog barking]

728
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:12,935
[rooster crows]

729
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,090
-We got a potential buyer.

730
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,649
-Hi, I was just in the
neighborhood here and...

731
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,273
Um, oh.

732
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,519
-Hi, howdy, how are ya? [clears throat]

733
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,571
Would you like a tour of this
house? It's beautiful inside.

734
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:43,405
- One second.
- I would love

735
00:40:43,405 --> 00:40:44,308
to give you a tour.

736
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:45,141
-One second.

737
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:48,159
Yeah, uh, somebody just
came out of the house here

738
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,453
offering to give me a tour.

739
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,499
And who, who are you, honey?

740
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,609
-We are the professionals
selling this house.

741
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,789
-She said that they
were the professionals,

742
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,503
and they're sellin' the house.

743
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,170
I'm not understandin'.

744
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,789
I see.

745
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,099
-There are things about this house

746
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,373
that you really can't see
until you go right on in there,

747
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,689
so if you get in there-
-Okay, honey, he just told me

748
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,949
that you weren't supposed
to be here, so what, what

749
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,009
kind of operation is this?
- There's a grace period

750
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,729
where the house is open,

751
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,610
and you can live there.
- Wait a minute,

752
00:41:26,611 --> 00:41:28,219
wait a minute, she said that there's

753
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,331
a grace period.
- So that's what we did.

754
00:41:29,332 --> 00:41:30,753
And we're selling this-
-Grace period's over!

755
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,259
- What, what, hold on.
- What do you mean?

756
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,949
-Um, um, you know what-
-Time to go!

757
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,209
-Okay, um, enjoy the house.

758
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,256
It was lovely meeting you.

759
00:41:38,257 --> 00:41:40,284
- Get in this truck.
- Is the house still for sale?

760
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:43,069
-Wait, what do you mean
the grace period's over?

761
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,386
-[Grifter] It just ended.

762
00:41:44,387 --> 00:41:45,985
-I loved talking to you!

763
00:41:45,986 --> 00:41:47,059
- I see.
- Congratulations.

764
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,139
You just sold your first house.

765
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,099
-Tell me more about
this, uh, grace period.

766
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,009
They mentioned something
about a grace period.

767
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,349
-[Sarah] So she's gonna
buy that house, you think?

768
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,729
-[Grifter] Oh, I know a
buyer when I see a buyer.

769
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,879
She's already probably signing
the paperwork as we speak.

770
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,933
-[Sarah] Oh, okay.

771
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,089
I really love that house.

772
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,003
-[Grifter] So what else do
you like to do in this town?

773
00:42:07,837 --> 00:42:10,809
-[Sarah] Oh, well, there's
my best friend's house.

774
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,869
-[Grifter] Okay, what's
your best friend like?

775
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,589
-[Sarah] She's nice, smart, and funny.

776
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,592
She's a friend of the family.

777
00:42:17,593 --> 00:42:21,468
-[Grifter] Hmm, nice, smart, and funny.

778
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:23,749
Well, I would love to meet her.

779
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,583
-[Sarah] Okay.

780
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,199
Isn't Lala's house great?

781
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,319
-[Grifter] You said her name is Lala?

782
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,049
-[Sarah] Yeah, Lala.

783
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,269
-[Grifter] Well, how do you
and this Lala know each other?

784
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:37,039
-[Sarah] Oh, her parents
died in a car bomb.

785
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,950
-[Grifter] Car bomb?

786
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,159
-[Sarah] Yeah, so my
great-grandmother took her in.

787
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,159
She was like a sister to my mother.

788
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,399
She's been my best friend my entire life.

789
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,343
-[Grifter] Car bomb? Ooh-la-la.

790
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,439
-[Sarah] Come on, you're gonna love her.

791
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,790
-[Grifter] I believe that.

792
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,017

[Sarah speaking in foreign language]

803
00:43:27,964 --> 00:43:29,039
-What are you guys talkin' about?

804
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,459
-She asked if you were my boyfriend.

805
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,719
-She did?

806
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,412
-Now, I want you to tell
her that you're not my type.

807
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:36,246
-Mm-hmm.

808
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:39,089
-But that she definitely is my type.

809
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,636
And whatever language it
is you guys are talkin' in,

810
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:43,440
I want you to say that
with the utmost sincerity.

811
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:48,029
-I speak English, and
thanks for the compliment,

812
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,983
but I like men a little more mature.

813
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,643
Let's go have a drink. Come on.

814
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,647
Anybody wants coffee and Kahlua?

815
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,439
So what are you doing in Youngstown?

816
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,759
-Went to the salon, sold a house,

817
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,459
been walkin' on crutches.

818
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,869
-Crutches? You're not hurt, are you?

819
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,689
-No. I've been practicing lying.

820
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,159
-Well, good, because you are

821
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,619
a terrible liar.
- Yeah.

822
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,870
-You're not going to
Canfield Fair, are you?

823
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:18,883
-No.

824
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,809
I'm thinkin' about
movin' back here though.

825
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,469
-[Lala] I would like to see you more,

826
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,493
but what would you do in Youngstown?

827
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,419
-Mm, Bob offered me a job.

828
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,849
-Really?

829
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:36,889
-[Sarah] Yeah.

830
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,349
-Bob?

831
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,270
-Yeah.

832
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:40,799
-[Lala] Really?

833
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,259
-Yeah.

834
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,869
-Well, just be safe.

835
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,369
-Okay.

836
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:46,939
-And cheers to Mama.

837
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,773
-To Mama.

838
00:44:48,654 --> 00:44:49,487
-To Mama.

839

[gentle music]

841
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:53,782
Oh, we got it.
[Sarah laughing]

842
00:44:53,783 --> 00:44:54,616
That was--
- I'm sorry.

843
00:44:54,617 --> 00:44:55,940
-I already, you know what-
-I'm sorry.

844
00:44:55,941 --> 00:44:57,069
- The funny thing--
- I'm sorry.

845
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,258
-If I didn't know-
-Because I would've said-

846
00:44:58,259 --> 00:44:59,259
- I would've believed you.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

847
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,753
-You were as stuffed as
I was, I was [indistinct].

848
00:45:02,754 --> 00:45:06,171
[gentle music continues]

849
00:45:19,573 --> 00:45:21,739
Oh, it was so nice to see.

850
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,931
So where are you off to now?

851
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:25,179
-Mm, we're gonna go see Bob.

852
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,479
-Well, tell Bob Lala says hi.

853
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,553
-Okay, I'll tell him Lala says hi.

854
00:45:30,448 --> 00:45:31,700
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

855
00:45:31,701 --> 00:45:32,534
[Sarah speaks foreign language]

856
00:45:32,534 --> 00:45:33,367
Bye, honey.

857
00:45:33,368 --> 00:45:34,770
-Such a pleasure.

858
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:35,604
-Bye.

859
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,033
-Okay.

860
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:44,949
Can I kiss you right now?

861
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,203
-Well, the real man isn't gonna ask.

862
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,444
-You're the best.

863
00:45:52,444 --> 00:45:53,277
-Bye.

864
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,753
[soft curious music]

865
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,586
-This place is really
fun. I grew up here.

866
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:12,699
-You grew up here?

867
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,229
-[Sarah] Yeah, just playin'
around in the scraps.

868
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,369
-[Grifter] You played
around in scraps growin' up?

869
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,083
-[Sarah] Yeah, it's a scrapyard.

870
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,329
These machines, they're huge.
- Yeah.

871
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,692
-There's so many different
things to look at.

872
00:46:26,693 --> 00:46:29,615
-[Grifter] Huh, that's
a big, beautiful crane.

873
00:46:29,616 --> 00:46:31,033
-[Sarah] Mm-hmm.

874
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:34,919
-[Grifter] Oh, check that out.

875
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,199
They're goin' up a huge conveyor belt.

876
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,450
-[Sarah] Sorting metals.

877
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,339
They got these claws, you see.

878
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,429
-[Grifter] The purpose of
a claw is to grab the metal,

879
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,609
crunch the metal, toss the
metal onto the huge heap?

880
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,577
-[Sarah] Yeah.

881
00:46:48,578 --> 00:46:50,769
-[Grifter] And you make
a ton of money like that?

882
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:51,959
-[Sarah] Yeah.

883
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,487
-[Grifter] Okay, now we're talkin'.

884
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,259
So what was that cheers
to Mama. Who's Mama?

885
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,819
-[Sarah] She's my great-grandmother.

886
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,059
She's my favorite person
in the whole entire world.

887
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,719
-Wow, big compliment, and who...

888
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,666
What is all this stuff
about Bob? Who's Bob?

889
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:07,856
-[Sarah] He's a friend of the family.

890
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:09,234
-[Grifter] This is his scrapyard?

891
00:47:09,235 --> 00:47:11,096
-[Sarah] Yeah, this is Bob's place.

892
00:47:11,097 --> 00:47:11,930
-[Grifter] And we're here to see Bob

893
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:14,285
'cause Bob offered you a job?

894
00:47:14,286 --> 00:47:17,469
-[Sarah] Yeah, Bob offered me a job.

895
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,529
-[Grifter] You think
Bob would offer me a job?

896
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,969
-[Sarah] Probably, Bob is really nice.

897
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,409
-[Grifter] I don't want a real job,

898
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,153
just somethin' I could do for like a week.

899
00:47:25,154 --> 00:47:26,264
-[Sarah] That'd be cool.

900
00:47:26,265 --> 00:47:27,098
-[Grifter] I don't really like

901
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:28,909
to stick around any jobs too long.

902
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,449
But I'm lookin' around here like, okay,

903
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,689
there's a lot of possibilities here.

904
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:35,794
I mean, look at that big old
pile of metal. [chuckles]

905
00:47:35,795 --> 00:47:36,628
-[Sarah] Mm-hmm.

906
00:47:36,629 --> 00:47:37,979
-[Grifter] I'd love to
collect that, melt that down,

907
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,733
and put it into a giant sword.

908
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:41,407
-[Sarah] Yeah.

909
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:44,179
-[Grifter] You know, you
get the fires really boilin',

910
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,849
see that turn into liquid hot magma.

911
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:49,253
-Oh yeah, Bob's gonna love you.

912
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,903
This guy is great. He's wonderful.

913
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:58,883
Hey Bob.

914
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,313
-I can't believe you showed up here!

915
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,689
-You offered me a job.

916
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,719
-That was a lifetime ago.

917
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,053
You just being here is
jeopardizing my whole business.

918
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,079
-But Bob.

919
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,339
-But Bob, what?

920
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,889
After what you did, there is no way

921
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:25,103
I would hire little Innocent Isabella.

922
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,103
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

923
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:34,043
You are Innocent Isabella
Domenico, the legendary rat?

924
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:35,870
-Yeah.

925
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,547
-Your father is the Icebox Killer?

926
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,540
-Mm-hmm.

927
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,547
-Your mother is the Red Widow, Fat Ethyl?

928
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:44,399
-Yeah, yeah.

929
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,499
-Your uncle is Flat Top?

930
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,333
-Mm-hmm.

931
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:48,689
-Your brother is Jackie Tonsils?

932
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:49,523
-Yeah.

933
00:48:49,524 --> 00:48:53,182
-And you're telling me that
your cousin is Kissable John?

934
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:54,016
-[Isabella] Yeah.

935
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:56,109
-And you're telling me
that your other cousin

936
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,520
is Moving Company Mary?

937
00:48:57,521 --> 00:48:58,354
-Yeah.

938
00:48:58,355 --> 00:48:59,988
-Your aunt is Lazy Susan?

939
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:00,822
-Yeah.

940
00:49:00,823 --> 00:49:03,079
- Your uncle, Jackie Red Lips.
- Mm-hmm.

941
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,669
-The creator of the
most legendary red sauce.

942
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,503
-Yes.

943
00:49:06,504 --> 00:49:09,149
-Your grandfather is Childish Steven.

944
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:09,983
-Yeah.

945
00:49:09,984 --> 00:49:12,989
-So that means that your
great-great-great-grandfather

946
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,376
is Turkey Back Jimmy.

947
00:49:14,377 --> 00:49:15,210
-Yeah.

948
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:16,439
-You're telling me right now that [sighs]

949
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,569
your frickin' adopted brother

950
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,059
is Tickle Me Thomas?
- Yes.

951
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,929
-[Grifter] Your cousin
is Crinkle Cut Jack?

952
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:21,763
-Yes.

953
00:49:21,764 --> 00:49:24,249
-[Grifter] And your
brother-in-law is Good Guy Ravioli.

954
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,083
-Yeah.

955
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:27,919
-Are you telling me right
now that your frickin' brother

956
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,333
is Tiny Timmy Tincture,
otherwise known as Tinc?

957
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:32,169
-Uh-huh.

958
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:35,469
-You, a member of the Domenico family,

959
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:37,569
the legendary crime family?

960
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:38,403
-Yeah.

961
00:49:38,404 --> 00:49:39,629
-So that means that
your great-grandmother

962
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,769
is Double DD Domenico.

963
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,603
-[Isabella] Yeah.

964
00:49:42,603 --> 00:49:43,570
-That's Mama?

965
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:44,403
-Yes.

966
00:49:44,404 --> 00:49:46,829
-You put your whole family in jail.

967
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,809
Everybody I just mentioned
is in prison 'cause of you.

968
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,789
And that's why you're
in witness protection,

969
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,823
'cause you named names.

970
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,473
Okay, I, this is too much, I gotta go.

971
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,479
-I just wanna be here, Bob.

972
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,609
-Do you have any idea
what Mama went through

973
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,839
to keep you safe?

974
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,590
You have a lot of nerve to come back here.

975
00:50:17,193 --> 00:50:19,610
[door slams]

976
00:50:21,553 --> 00:50:22,386
-Okay.

977
00:50:25,242 --> 00:50:28,325
[soft curious music]

978
00:50:56,998 --> 00:50:59,915
I can't believe you showed up here.

979
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:05,545
[Isabella grumbling]

980
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,320
-[Narrator] On July 15th,
1990, in Spencerport, New York-

981
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:23,916
[switch clicks]
[people moaning]

982
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,184
[switch clicks]
[soft music]

983
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:27,041
-[Man] And what we feel
happened was the, uh-

984
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,965
[switch clicks]
[people moaning]

985
00:51:28,966 --> 00:51:30,366
-[Man] The wall behind the-

986
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:39,775
[horn honks]

987
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,553
[faint upbeat music]

988
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:01,023
[chair squeaking]

989
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,286
-What you drinkin'?

990
00:52:07,287 --> 00:52:09,059
-It's a lager.

991
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,873
-Yum, I love those.

992
00:52:11,874 --> 00:52:13,957
-[Lager Drinker] Uh-huh.

993
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:18,809
-Now, there's like red
lagers and dark lagers

994
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:22,133
and amber lagers and pale lagers.

995
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,489
Do you know what the difference
between any of those are?

996
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,013
-Uh, no.

997
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:29,463
-Well, I do.

998
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,599
It's about density.

999
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,079
It's about purity.

1000
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,689
It's about alcohol content.

1001
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,919
It's about what's really gonna,

1002
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,669
I don't know, hit the taste
buds in just the right way.

1003
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,799
That's what the difference
between all those lagers are,

1004
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,969
not just coloration, but
flavor, and I don't know.

1005
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,709
I just, every time I taste a new lager,

1006
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:51,670
I'm always thinking to myself, like,

1007
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:52,503
how does that compare to the other lagers

1008
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:55,209
I've had in the past? How does
that compare to the lagers

1009
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:58,939
that have really knocked me
on my butt in the taste buds?

1010
00:52:58,940 --> 00:52:59,990
You know what I mean?

1011
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,230
That's kind of the thing
I'm always looking for

1012
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:03,063
in a place like this.

1013
00:53:03,064 --> 00:53:05,359
I mean, don't get me
wrong, I love this place,

1014
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,743
but their lager selection
seems a little bit lacking.

1015
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:10,809
You know what I mean?

1016
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,513
-Maybe you should find
another place then.

1017
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,693
-No, I mean, I love this place,

1018
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:18,477
especially some of these vodkas over here.

1019
00:53:18,478 --> 00:53:21,099
One thing that could really
help this place out is,

1020
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,939
they just don't have
the kind of vodka system

1021
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,439
that would really work
in a place like this,

1022
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,719
where they could take some
of these bottom-shelf vodkas.

1023
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,949
They can put them through a Brita filter

1024
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:32,910
about three or four times.

1025
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:35,229
They're going to taste
exactly like top-shelf vodka.

1026
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:36,063
The only difference

1027
00:53:36,064 --> 00:53:37,379
between a top-shelf vodka
and a bottom-shelf vodka

1028
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,139
is filtration, purity,

1029
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,079
what's gonna give you a
hangover the next day.

1030
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,280
That's kind of the thing

1031
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,359
that most people don't
know about vodkas are, is,

1032
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,439
if you just work 'em,
tweak 'em a little bit,

1033
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,209
you have something that actually is, uh,

1034
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:55,689
really even double, triple,
quadruple your money.

1035
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,750
And, um, I don't know.

1036
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,139
I just kind of like stuff like that.

1037
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,749
Do you mind if I, uh...

1038
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,837
Could I try your lager?

1039
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:08,088
-Yeah, I mind.

1040
00:54:09,856 --> 00:54:12,062
[chair squeaking]

1041
00:54:12,063 --> 00:54:13,527
-All right.

1042
00:54:13,528 --> 00:54:18,528
[faint lonesome country music]
[patrons chattering]

1043
00:54:31,979 --> 00:54:32,875

1044
00:54:32,876 --> 00:54:35,625

1045
00:54:54,414 --> 00:54:57,081
[rooster crows]

1046
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:01,525
[timer ticking]

1047
00:55:04,905 --> 00:55:07,322
[bell dings]

1048
00:55:14,218 --> 00:55:16,718
[tense music]

1049
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:25,755
-Do I look like a Domenico to you?

1050
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:28,506
Do I look like a Domenico to you?

1051
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:32,022
'Cause I'm a Domenico.

1052
00:55:32,023 --> 00:55:34,456
Is that too much for you?

1053
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:39,457

01:04:55,645 --> 01:04:56,562
-Isabella!

1227
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:00,303
Come on, I shouldn't have-

1228
01:05:00,304 --> 01:05:02,152
- No!
- Called you a rat.

1229
01:05:02,153 --> 01:05:04,103
-Yeah, because I'm not a rat.

1230
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:08,129
-Now, I shouldn't have called you a rat.

1231
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:11,026
Technically, you are a rat.

1232
01:05:11,027 --> 01:05:12,299
-I'm not a rat.

1233
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,900
Mama asked me to go to the feds.

1234
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,320
-Double DD asked you to go to the feds?

1235
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:20,219
Why?

1236
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,419
-The family was breakin' all her rules

1237
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,192
and doin' really bad stuff.

1238
01:05:24,193 --> 01:05:25,026
-Well, that's what you guys do.

1239
01:05:25,027 --> 01:05:26,839
You're the Domenicos.
You guys do bad stuff.

1240
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,990
-[Isabella] Even crime
families got rules.

1241
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:32,129
-[Grifter] And what are these rules?

1242
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,969
-No killin' family, no killin' civilians.

1243
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:38,379
No killin' pets, no killin' family pets.

1244
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:41,769
No drugs, no robbing nursing homes,

1245
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,899
no drinkin' milk after 3:00 am.

1246
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,209
I mean, Mama had a lot of rules,

1247
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:48,169
and they were breakin' all of 'em.

1248
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,939
-Well, why doesn't
anybody know about this?

1249
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,390
-[Isabella] Nobody can
know, but it's the truth.

1250
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:58,659
-Well, if this is a lie,
this is a very convincing lie.

1251
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,139
-[Isabella] I'm a terrible liar.

1252
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,093
-That is true.

1253
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,870
But I will tell you, this outfit,

1254
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,679
pretty good visual lie.

1255
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,559
-[Isabella] Thank you.

1256
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,909
-[Grifter] Come on,
let's go back in the fair.

1257
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:14,149
You love the fear. You're
not tryin' to leave now.

1258
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:16,400
-Don't you think I'm
dangerous to be around?

1259
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,539
-And I'm not dangerous to be around?

1260
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,779
I'm Mr. In Bed By Nine O'clock?

1261
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,459
I don't think so.

1262
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,269
Come on, let's get somethin' to eat.

1263
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:28,023
There's gotta be something
you like in there.

1264
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,889
-The cavatelli is excellent.

1265
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:33,369
-There we go, cavatelli.

1266
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,759
Come on.

1267
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,780
-[Isabella] You do need
to try this cavatelli.

1268
01:06:36,781 --> 01:06:37,829
-I don't know what that is, but-

1269
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,069
-[Isabella] It's pasta.

1270
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:39,960
-[Grifter] Like spaghetti?

1271
01:06:39,961 --> 01:06:41,975
-[Isabella] No, it's like cavatelli.

1272
01:06:41,976 --> 01:06:44,115
-Cavatelli and meatball,
cavatelli bread bowl,

1273
01:06:44,116 --> 01:06:45,674
cavatelli dinner.

1274
01:06:45,675 --> 01:06:47,073
Okay, two cavatellis.

1275
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,993
I actually don't have any cash.

1276
01:06:49,994 --> 01:06:50,976
-I have some cash.

1277
01:06:50,977 --> 01:06:53,226
I got it.
- Okay, all right.

1278
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,689
Yesterday, forget about
that. That was so not me.

1279
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:00,289
The one thing I know not
to do is ditch a Domenico.

1280
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:01,629
I love that you're a Domenico.

1281
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:03,149
I love that you're Innocent Isabella.

1282
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:03,983
-[Isabella] Yeah?

1283
01:07:03,984 --> 01:07:06,493
-[Grifter] That's a treat
for me. That's exciting.

1284
01:07:06,494 --> 01:07:07,327
-[Isabella] Really?

1285
01:07:07,328 --> 01:07:08,373
-[Grifter] Yes.

1286
01:07:08,374 --> 01:07:09,765
-[Isabella] I'm a liability.

1287
01:07:09,766 --> 01:07:10,599
-[Grifter] I don't care about liability.

1288
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,659
I'm a walking liability.

1289
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,279
What's the first word in liability? Lie.

1290
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,129
That's all I do. That's
what I teach you how to do.

1291
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:20,089
You know, I just was a little overwhelmed

1292
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:22,226
to hear that you were
a real life Domenico.

1293
01:07:22,227 --> 01:07:23,644
-[Isabella] Hmm.

1294
01:07:25,129 --> 01:07:26,057
Okay, I'm ready.

1295
01:07:26,057 --> 01:07:26,890
-[Grifter] I'm so ready.

1296
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:28,163
- I'm hot.
- I'm red hot.

1297
01:07:28,164 --> 01:07:30,738
-[Carny] On your marks, get set, and go!

1298
01:07:30,739 --> 01:07:33,550
[game whirring]
[lighthearted music]

1299
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:34,989
And we're off to the races, folks.

1300
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:37,235
Look at 'em go, look at
'em go, look at 'em go!

1301
01:07:37,236 --> 01:07:41,112
Number 11, number 11's the lucky winner.

1302
01:07:41,113 --> 01:07:42,055
-[Isabella] I want a corn dog.

1303
01:07:42,055 --> 01:07:42,888
I think we should get a corn dog.

1304
01:07:42,889 --> 01:07:44,954
-[Grifter] I want a corn
dog. Can we get a corn dog?

1305
01:07:44,955 --> 01:07:45,918
Oh yeah.
- You make these

1306
01:07:45,919 --> 01:07:47,128
fresh yourself?

1307
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:48,842
-[Grifter] Cotton candy.

1308
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:49,676
- Hi.
- Hi there.

1309
01:07:49,677 --> 01:07:52,932
-[Isabella] Could I get a
bag of cotton candy, please?

1310
01:07:52,933 --> 01:07:53,857
-[Grifter] You know,
I got a lot of respect

1311
01:07:53,857 --> 01:07:54,690
for you coming here.

1312
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:55,523
I know there's a lot of heat on you.

1313
01:07:55,524 --> 01:07:58,212
-[Isabella] Oh, I'd never
miss the Canfield Fair,

1314
01:07:58,213 --> 01:08:00,249
food, rides, prizes.

1315
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,189
-Hey, speaking of prizes,

1316
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:03,829
I was actually hoping there'd
be a few more adult prizes,

1317
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,052
like a free car or something.

1318
01:08:05,053 --> 01:08:07,369
It's just stuffed animals.

1319
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:08,920
-Mama took me here every year.

1320
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:13,251
-Well, Innocent Isabella
and Double DD Domenico

1321
01:08:13,252 --> 01:08:15,529
at the Canfield Fair, I love that.

1322
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:19,749
-You know, everyone called
me innocent as an insult,

1323
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:20,889
but Mama called me innocent

1324
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:22,790
'cause that's what she loved about me.

1325
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,850
-Cheers to Mama.

1326
01:08:27,328 --> 01:08:28,161
-To Mama.

1327
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:33,067
[light dreamy music]

1328
01:09:46,144 --> 01:09:48,737
I'm very tired. [yawns]

1329
01:09:48,738 --> 01:09:50,792
-[Grifter] I haven't felt this bushed...

1330
01:09:50,793 --> 01:09:53,057
You know how, like, when you,

1331
01:09:53,058 --> 01:09:56,609
after you've eaten, you don't
know what hungry feels like.

1332
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,079
-[Isabella] Mm-hmm.

1333
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,359
-It's like, when you're this bushed,

1334
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,845
how can you ever not be so bushed.

1335
01:10:04,846 --> 01:10:05,679
-Yeah.

1336
01:10:07,014 --> 01:10:10,743
-You know, these white trucks
are designed to be slept in.

1337
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:15,297
This truck is extremely sleepable.

1338
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:19,163
It's extremely sleepable. I sleep in here.

1339
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,057
They make 'em so you can sleep in 'em.

1340
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:26,993
Seat, seat goes back.

1341
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:31,540
This is a great place to sleep.

1342
01:10:36,453 --> 01:10:38,765
[rooster crows]

1343
01:10:38,766 --> 01:10:41,089
Well, that was really fun.

1344
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:43,140
-[Isabella] Yeah, the fair's always fun.

1345
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:50,022
-You know, I spend most of my time alone.

1346
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:56,010
And, um, you were the first
person I met in a long time

1347
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,860
where I feel like I
don't need to lie to you.

1348
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:02,920
-What's your name?

1349
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:04,663
-My name?

1350
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,653
My name is Gary Briggs.

1351
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:11,073
-Gary Briggs.

1352
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:13,859
That's a nice name.

1353
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,810
-[Gary] Thank you.

1354
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:18,169
-What are you gonna
do today, Gary Briggs?

1355
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:20,639
-You know, I think I'm ready to try

1356
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,983
that legendary corned
beef from Kravitz Deli.

1357
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:27,329
What about you?

1358
01:11:28,653 --> 01:11:30,093
-I think I'm ready too.

1359
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,350
-To try the corned beef?

1360
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:34,543
-No.

1361
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,543
I'm ready to go to 125
Churchill Hubbard Road.

1362
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,449
There's someone I gotta see.

1363
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:45,283
-[Gary] Okay.

1364
01:11:47,047 --> 01:11:50,130
[lighthearted music]

1365
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:52,490
-[Isabella] Thanks for the ride.

1366
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:53,740
-[Gary] Yeah, of course.

1367
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:01,949
[door beeps]

1368
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,189
- Hi.
- Hi.

1369
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,349
-[Receptionist] How can I help you?

1370
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,579
-[Isabella] I'm here to see Joe.

1371
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:06,450
-[Receptionist] Okay, I'll let him know.

1372
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:07,700
You can just take a seat.

1373
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:12,343
Hi, Joe, there's someone here to see ya.

1374
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:16,179
I don't think so. I think it's a walk-in.

1375
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:18,469
Yeah. Okay, sounds good.

1376
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:19,570
Joe will be right out.

1377
01:12:20,871 --> 01:12:21,840
[door creaks]

1378
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,690
-[Joe] Hi, I'm Joe.

1379
01:12:22,691 --> 01:12:23,869
- Hi.
- Nice to meet ya.

1380
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:24,703
Come on down.

1381
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,320
All right, come on in and grab a seat.

1382
01:12:38,345 --> 01:12:41,678
All right, how can I help you out today?

1383
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,459
-Do you know who I am?

1384
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,293
-Not yet.

1385
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,659
-I'm Isabella Domenico,

1386
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,810
and I'm here to get
the money Mama left me.

1387
01:12:54,884 --> 01:12:55,717
-Mama?

1388
01:12:56,817 --> 01:12:58,349
-Mama.

1389
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:59,183
-Mama.

1390
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:02,463
-Mama.

1391
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:08,839
-Okay, I'll get that
money transferred over

1392
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,134
from the family's off-shore
bank account right now.

1393
01:13:12,135 --> 01:13:14,718
[gentle music]

1394
01:13:23,749 --> 01:13:26,824
-Corned beef. You said it, Jack.

1395
01:13:44,095 --> 01:13:47,845

-[Isabella] Hi Gary.

1403

-[Gary] Well, if it
isn't Innocent Isabella.

1404
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:08,619
-I'm thinkin' about leaving Youngstown.

1405
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:11,449
-That's amazing. I just
had the exact same thought.

-Hmm.

1407
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,983
What's the MSRP on this white truck?

1408
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,943
-Extremely good.

1409
01:15:18,873 --> 01:15:19,733
-I thought so.

You know, Mama always said,

it's good to keep a liar
around you can trust.

1412
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,203
-Well, full disclosure,

1413
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,479
I'm still on a test drive with this truck.

1414
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,780
It's not technically mine.

1415
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:38,810
-That's not a problem.

[Isabella humming]

1418
01:15:50,384 --> 01:15:51,629
when you said it's not a problem?

1419
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,849
-[Isabella] I mean it's not a problem.

1420
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,399
-[Gary] So you're saying
it's taken care of?

1421
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,849
-[Isabella] I didn't
say it's taken care of.

1422
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:58,699
I said it's not a problem.

1423
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,889
-[Gary] So you are telling
me that it's not a problem.

1424
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:04,429
-[Isabella] I'm telling
you it's not a problem.

1425
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:07,309
-[Gary] Well, then I
guess it's not a problem.

That's a beautiful truck.

1430
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,407
-[Salesman] Well, I'd
have to check the MSRP.

1431
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:23,139
-[Isabella] I'm ready to
buy it right now, cash.
