Subtitle prepared by Girish N Limbad.

2
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:10,299
My name is Brad Cohen

3
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:11,931
But when I was a kid

4
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,436
 people called me by lots of names.

5
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:18,196
My brother Jeff called me Dr. bow bow

6
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:22,784
My mom called me ha..honey

7
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:28,633
And in kids` school, well,
they called me everything.

8
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:30,470
From spares to feet.

9
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:33,576
I didn’t have many friends actually.

10
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,069
But I did have a constant companion

11
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:38,786
I can barely remember a time
 when it wasn’t there.

12
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:47,334
Now sometime it wasn’t
 a problem for me.

13
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:55,536
Other times.....

14
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:57,083
It was.

15
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:01,434
Stop it.

16
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,075
Something scare you now?

17
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:04,081
Roll....

18
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:04,861
uh.

19
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:07,078
Give me a leave baby.

20
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:07,755
uh....

21
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:09,145
Cohen.. Cohen...Cohen...

22
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:11,936
What is going on?

23
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:12,916
Come on. Beat off.

24
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,816
Stop. Stop that fighting right now.

25
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:15,802
Come on.. Come on...

26
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:17,975
Get back to class.

27
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,044
Stop that nonsense.

28
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:21,884
You are in big trouble this time.

29
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:26,379
The girl fell in the mud and got dirty.

30
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:29,434
one thing my constant
companion and I agreed on

31
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:31,767
was that we hated school.

32
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:34,539
I couldn’t wait through I got out.

33
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:36,079
No more home work..

34
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:37,346
No more books...

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,716
No more teachers` dirty looks.

36
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:44,222
Stop.

37
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:50,050
My companion first shoot off
 when I was Six.

38
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:52,243
But it was used when I had an eight.

39
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,035
Now the Psychologists said
 that just I was hyper.

40
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:58,155
I made funny noises, nap and weird,
to draw attention to myself.

41
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:01,987
It was just a phase. I grow out of it
 and be normal...

42
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:05,413
like  everybody else.

43
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:14,774
Through it all, my constant
companion stuck with me.

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,905
Now to my friends
I am just regular old Brad.

45
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,047
The guy who likes baseball.

46
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:23,611
and loves cheesy 80`s music

47
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,054
which they think is much
weirder than the noises I make.

48
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,152
<i>"...... searching low"</i>

49
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:34,580
<i>"Ba ba ba ba baby"</i>

50
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:39,583
<i>"Don’t forget my number......"</i>

51
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:44,463
<i>"Ba ba ba ba baby......"</i>

52
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,147
<i>"Baby don't be stronger than
a thunder..thunder..."</i>

53
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,872
<i>"Ba ba...ba ba... baby...baby.."</i>

54
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:58,633
<i>"Don’t forget my number..number"</i>

55
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:11,996
Good afternoon officer!

56
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:12,923
Was I speedy?

57
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:14,676
12 miles. Over the limit.

58
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:16,249
St. Louis ha..

59
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:17,213
You’re tourist?

60
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:20,291
Uh, no, I live in Atlanta,
I just moved here.

61
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:22,599
I guess I've little bit distracted.

62
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:27,073
So ... you’ve been drinking?

63
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:31,530
No. No.  Sir, I.. I  have
'Tourette syndrome'.

64
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:33,098
Take it easy sir

65
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,837
I need you to sign here.

66
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,109
So what kind of job you look for?

67
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:39,342
Teaching.

68
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:40,564
Gonna be a teacher

69
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:46,506
uh..

70
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:48,591
I get there look a lot.

71
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:52,327
But I never allowed to get in.

72
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:13,172
I haven’t seen anyone
 from Bradley University.

73
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:15,493
Illinois is on ... right?- Yes Madam.

74
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,574
Graduated (with honour)

75
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:19,743
High recommendations

76
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,977
You are a student teaching
about moral  outstanding.

77
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,431
Excellent!

78
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:27,822
What made you decide to go into teaching?

79
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:30,408
It’s all I always wanted to do,

80
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:32,362
Actually I was born to teach.

81
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:34,681
Why did you choose Atlanta?

82
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:36,398
I.. I  mean Missouri is your home.

83
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:37,564
Yeah. No I’m....

84
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,165
I think it's because I’m Braves fan ...

85
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,578
so ... aa....

86
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:45,008
Georgia honoured  my Illino
is teaching certificate .

87
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:46,974
Plus, I fell in love with Atlanta

88
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,399
When I worked down here
as a camp counselor

89
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,860
I live here now.

90
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,523
So live my dad and my step mom.

91
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:58,085
Well, its nice to have family here too.

92
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:59,603
Give you support.

93
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:03,946
Maybe we should talk about the elephant.

94
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:06,205
Elephant?

95
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:07,793
In this room ... my Tourette.

96
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:11,433
No, the  Americans with disabilities
 Act doesn’t allow me to ask.

97
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,540
I know. But I would like to tell you

98
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:16,255
Just like I tell the kinds in my classes.

99
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,827
You see, I explain to
 the that  its a brain thing.

100
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:22,071
That causes middle. Make the
strange noises they are like....sneezes.

101
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:24,079
Irrepressible when you have to...

102
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:25,439
...you have to.

103
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:26,834
How do they react?

104
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:28,627
Once they understand, its fine thing.

105
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:30,676
It never cause a problem in the class room.

106
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:34,023
All I want is a chance.

107
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,403
Just give me the interview and let me
prove to them that I can do the job.

108
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:43,035
The Americans with Disabilities
 Act says I deserve a chance.

109
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:50,598
Ron!

110
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:52,335
They have to go?

111
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:53,609
Aaaa.....

112
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:56,681
You know ... Who wants
a teacher that barks like a dog?

113
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,948
You should try another line of work.

114
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,433
Are you serious?

115
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:04,021
Didn’t they look at your résumé?

116
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:07,451
Aah..... You’re kidding me.

117
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:09,719
They are setting up some
interviews with school principals.

118
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:10,636
Fantastic!

119
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:11,256
when?

120
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:13,062
Eh...I do not know.
I got to wait for the call.

121
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:14,800
Get change and we get to go celebrate.

122
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,959
Haven’t you got a date?

123
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,653
Eh... she.. she’s got a friend.

124
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,841
It is about time you start meeting girls.

125
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:22,215
I cann`t focus on dating right now.

126
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,912
Has anybody told you that you’re obsessive?

127
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,333
Aa... Only every
shrink  I've ever saw.

128
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:31,520
Have fun focusing.

129
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:35,548
Oh, Your dad called again.

130
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:38,692
May be you should came back,

131
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:40,039
you know.

132
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:42,583
I will see you letter.

133
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,536
Returning dad’s call?

134
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:47,351
Eh..

135
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:49,084
I had to prepare for that.

136
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:52,444
See mom and dad had divorced
 when I was a little kid...

137
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:55,167
and my relationship with dad
has always been...

138
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:58,819
Aaa.... let just say complicated.

139
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:05,595
I mean I wore out his patience
 like nails on a chock-board.

140
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:10,961
It didn’t help that my brother
 Jeff was also a little hyper

141
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,779
Dad said he is waiting get back
 to his home Atlanta

142
00:07:13,962 --> 00:07:15,515
He is waiting to say good bye.

143
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:16,462
Byeeee

144
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,591
You gonna make a mad!

145
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,512
Come on, race.

146
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:22,808
Against the Green Dragon?
You gotta be kidding.

147
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:25,557
Sucker. That’s you are.

148
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:41,844
You go on a bike.

149
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:43,779
See you Jeff.

150
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:50,274
Hey.. that’s not fair

151
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,936
You’re not gonna beat me.

152
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:57,081
Oh! that’s not fair.

153
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:59,018
You are one bike.

154
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:00,343
*************

155
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:03,409

168
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:31,902
Hey. Listen I mean it.

okay? ******* your brother may
 think its funny but I do not.

170
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,355
I can not help it.

171
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:39,837
Yes, you can. Its nothing wrong
with you. Little self-control would fix.

172
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:40,799
Now stop it.

173
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:45,879

183
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,622
Remember we talked about.
Self control.

184
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:11,502
Alright?

185
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:18,817
- Do you need any help Mom?-
- Well, now that you mention it.

186
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:33,456
After the divorce Jeff and I
 helped mom with a new business.

187
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,214
Sort of a high class traveling boutique

188
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:40,347
Well, may be help isn’t exactly
 the right word.

189
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:43,272
Oh1 Ellen, these things are exquisite.

190
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,002
You never found style
 like these in San Luis.

191
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,721
That was directly from California
 Beverly Hills.

192
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,750
This is what everybody wear.
Look at.

193
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:53,225
Boys.

194
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:54,011
Boys

195
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:54,992
Hide and Seek ?

196
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:56,058
- Account you- 1, 2, 3 ...

197
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:59,975
Now Ellen, I don’t want to see
 anything from double size.

198
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:03,667
Honey! everything in California
runs small. Go ahead. just try it on .

199
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,568
Brad. Will you please calm down?

200
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,672
Barking like a dog for goodness sake.

201
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:15,803
Now look. Don’t take this in wrong way.
You know I wouldn’t say this to you.

202
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:20,824
We are friends.But have you
 considered an exorcist?

203
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:27,076
You know ... I think you might
accept that your size is 12.

204
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,245
I cut the label if it
makes you feel better.

205
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:40,132
Its a new doctor. Lets just
listen to what he has to say.

206
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,819
You know what you have to say.

207
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:48,392
Do you feel any anger
toward your mother ...

208
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:51,279
...because of a divorce?

209
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:52,979
No.....No....

210
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,133
Do you resent your father because
 he doesn’t live with you?  hum?

211
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,826
No.

212
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,188
Do you blame yourself
for the divorce matter?

213
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,262
It happened when I was
little kid. I can not remember.

214
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,081
Ms. Cohen, Brad has some serious
 denial issues regarding a divorce.

215
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:20,551
What you need at home are some
clear boundaries he needs to understand.

216
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:22,626
that this behavior is totally unacceptable.

217
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:25,888
And that... Ms. Cohen..... is your job.

218
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:29,016
The hardest part was knowing
how tough I made things for mom.

219
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:31,229
I tried it best as I could for her.

220
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:33,173
Make sure that you take
my medications. yeah?

221
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:34,157
And for dad

222
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:36,240
Strike trees.

223
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:38,592
I played sports.

224
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:43,029
In the ball-field I felt right in..

225
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,051
I mean everybody makes funny noises
and has strange tics in a baseball game.

226
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:54,364
Lets Bob... Bob.

227
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:56,296
Come on Hard on them!

228
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,390
Come on Bo..Bo..

229
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,599
 Get him out Brad, get him out!

230
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:04,760
Come on. Brad, come on.

231
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:08,521
Yes, great play!
Come on!

232
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:22,424
Thank you very much.
Alright.

233
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:24,826
Hey guys.

234
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,498
I got some pretty exciting to tell you

235
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,479
Honey, Don’t eat so fast you
so you cant get the hiccups.

236
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,759
- He’s always got the hiccups.
- You're a hiccup.

237
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:36,339
Listen, hey, would you just relax?

238
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,460
Mom says you are not taking your medicine.

239
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,827
How are you ever...

240
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,114
how you ever can calm down if do not
listen to the doctors pills prescription?

241
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:44,359
Pills makes it worse.

242
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:46,188
Oh, I see So your doctor now too. ha..

243
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,520
He is doctor Bo..Bo....

244
00:12:47,614 --> 00:12:48,127
Shut up.

245
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:49,714
Al right guys, listen guys

246
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:52,755
I have a very important
announcement to make.

247
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:53,449
Guys.

248
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,952
Guys. Alright that’s it.
Go back to the car.

249
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:58,514
I am still hungry.

250
00:12:58,654 --> 00:12:59,540
You know what would be nice?

251
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:02,568
One day ...! without you acting up.

252
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:06,918
One.

253
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:09,171
Wait up, Dad!

254
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:32,082
What’s an announcement, Dad?

255
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:33,811
I've been seeing somebody.

256
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:35,719
Why mean seeing somebody?

257
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:37,937
Her name is Diane and ...she..

258
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,197
Brad please.

259
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:41,158
Stop doing that.

260
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,081
I cann`t.

261
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:47,395
I mean nothing happened yet but...

262
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,190
how would you guys feel about
 having a step mom?

263
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:52,231
No way.

264
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:53,641
We already have a mom.

265
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:56,041
Well, now you gonna have two.

266
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:59,125
I talked to mom about it.
She is fine with it.

267
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:02,312
She said... I said stop it..just stop it.

268
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:09,735
See I couldn’t really blame
dad for losing it

269
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:12,520
My tics drove him nuts

270
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,711
Because like my teachers he had
no names for my strange behaviour.

271
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:19,643
Except insufferable.

272
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:25,869
Now somehow, I don’t know how
 I made ok grades

273
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:30,076
But what would take  a normal person
an hour,took me two or three.

274
00:14:30,356 --> 00:14:31,457
I mean I loved learning.

275
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:33,669
But I hated... hated reading.

276
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:37,866
Trying to concentrate brought out
 the worst in my constant companion.

277
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:45,250
Brad.

278
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,863
Come up here please.

279
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:02,608
I know you think the class clown,
but I have headache with you.

280
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:07,187
I cann`t........ help it.

281
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:08,570
That’s what you always say.

282
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,673
I don’t wanna hear anymore excuses.

283
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,692
You’re classmates are
trying to study...

284
00:15:16,354 --> 00:15:18,834
...and your clowning makes it impossible.

285
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:21,971
Sorry.

286
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,412
Don’t apologize to me.

287
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:24,858
Apologize to them.

288
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:26,744
Eyes up here everyone.

289
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:28,444
Sit up straight, please.

290
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,464
Brad has something to say to you.

291
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,557
I am sorry.

292
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:39,234
That you cann`t study because of me

293
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:40,670
And?

294
00:15:43,047 --> 00:15:47,340
You promise never to make
anymore silly noises ever again.

295
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:56,725
Promise to all making no more
silly noises ever again.

296
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:00,289
Take your seat.

297
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:02,383
All of you back to your books.

298
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:14,543
It is difficult to resist.
May be for you, Ms. Cohen,

299
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,643
I assure you that the teachers
are at their wits end.

300
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:19,170
I understand that.... But I will ........

301
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,367
This will be a last chance

302
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,721
I mean the very last chance.

303
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:25,023
Brad

304
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:27,728
I called your mother

305
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,429
because things are just going
out of control for you.

306
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,965
Now she is gonna take you on this day.

307
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,864
You can come back

308
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:37,519
I cann`t help.

309
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:39,088
Sorry,  what did you say?

310
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:41,326
He said he cann`t help it.

311
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:42,126
Right.

312
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,374
What if he is telling the truth?
hum?

313
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,001
You got a right boy Ms. cohen.

314
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:48,136
But making excuses cann`t help.

315
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,383
Making excuses is not going to help.

316
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:55,021
He needs to use this time,
ask himself, this

317
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:57,050
Brad. Hello. Lets go. Lets go.

318
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,660
Why am I sabotaging myself.

319
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:02,440
I do not care if they I expelled me.

320
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:03,988
 I hate that school.

321
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,335
Well, is that school or another.

322
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:07,858
Hate all schools.

323
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:09,352
Why we are going here?

324
00:17:09,556 --> 00:17:10,596
To find some answers.

325
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:13,329
I cann`t go in the library.

326
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:14,663
They will throw me out.

327
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,877
Please mom.

328
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:17,635
Alright.

329
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:18,328
Come here.

330
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,667
Sit over here.

331
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,903
Well, may be we are
going down a wrong track.

332
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:24,783
Who?

333
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:26,829
All of us.

334
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:32,547
Get off me.

335
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:36,507
Chihuahua, Chihuahua.
Ok you are really/

336
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:37,943
Oh No. I am not really.

337
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:39,676
I know you're busy Norman.

338
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:41,647
But I really think that
you should do this.

339
00:17:41,753 --> 00:17:44,199
Boys keep it down.
I’m talking to your Dad.

340
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,120
I wanna talk to....

341
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:47,100
In a minute. Keep it down.

342
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,776
You know those teachers and Dr.

343
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:51,624
To them it is all about bad heritage.

344
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:54,394
Which of course comes down to me
because I am the only one here.

345
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:59,148
No. I am not blaming you, Norman.
In fact I’m gonna stop blaming myself.

346
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:03,266
I was talking to my friend and she
thinks that doctors are missing something.

347
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:05,379
I get to start medical
 books in the library.

348
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,480
And I have been doing
a little bit of research

349
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,983
Stop saying he just needs
a discipline, Norman.

350
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,746
Nothing I do helps.

351
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:15,535
He is out of control and I am at the
end of my rope.

352
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:20,110
Can I talk to Dad.

353
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:23,777
Can you just wait a minute honey?

354
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:24,697
Mom......

355
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,585
Alright, give it back to me
 when you're done.

356
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,179
What is it Jeffrey?

357
00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:30,246
Hi Dad

358
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:33,719
It was a great thing (Game)

359
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:36,287
I managed two base hits and a walk.

360
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:53,166
Sorry because I caused
so much trouble on.

361
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:56,510
I want you to read something
in this book I’ve found.

362
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:59,544
Its a medical book that might
explain why you make all those noises.

363
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,997
I hate reading mom.

364
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:02,421
Read.

365
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,328
Tourette Syndrome.

366
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:10,734
That that’s Brad, isn’t it?
the

367
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:13,761
These ... noises ... and ....tics...

368
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:17,694
 I’ve surely to do more tests.

369
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:21,074
But..... you may be right, and we
have been making a mistake with him.

370
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:27,481
I have never actually seen.....

371
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,313
.....a case Tourette before.

372
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:32,845
So at last my constant
companion  had a name.

373
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:35,464
This says that there is no cure ...

374
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,960
but that may have changed
this is an old book.

375
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:40,795
That hasn’t changed, Ms. Cohen.

376
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,474
I'm really sorry.

377
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,699
If are they still looking
for a cure. Right?

378
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,440
I mean they will find one more day.

379
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:48,662
 They have....

380
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,906
It’s okay, mom. Everything
will be alright.

381
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,767
See? There is a reason, Dad.

382
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:09,830
I haven’t been weird on purpose.

383
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,075
Listen up, Brad.

384
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,298
I am...

385
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:21,183
Alright...that’s all I wanted to say.

386
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:23,550
Bye.

387
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:34,227
Finally my dad believed me.

388
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:38,197
But he never believed in me
that I would succeed.

389
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,356
That I could teach.

390
00:20:47,034 --> 00:20:48,614
Hello! This is Brad.

391
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:53,360
A dog?Aaa.. yes... yes.. madam
 that is... that’s my dog. Aha!

392
00:20:57,003 --> 00:20:58,289
Aaa... Okay.

393
00:20:58,343 --> 00:21:01,406
Yes. Yes I can there be 11:00 a.m.

394
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:03,669
My very first interview.

395
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:05,285
Great. That sounds great.

396
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:07,245
Ok. Thank you.

397
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,964
I tried not overreact.

398
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:12,991
I held in my tics.

399
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,096
Yes! Yes!

400
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:26,816
After the first call, I got two more.
Three interviews with three principals

401
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:32,703
Needless to say, my constant companion
 was more than a little enthusiastic.

402
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,358
Hum!

403
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:45,510
All I see that you have a bachelor degree.

404
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:47,037
Have you thought about the Master?

405
00:21:47,063 --> 00:21:47,950
Yes sir.

406
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:49,132
As soon as I can.

407
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:51,506
We don’t require for interview.
Let hope.

408
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,403
- But if you seriously about......
- I am very serious.....

409
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:56,431
I wanna make teaching my life.

410
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:02,137
I.....

411
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:05,988
I make these noises because
I have Tourette syndrome.

412
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,531
I would like to tell you about it.
It’s a neurological disorder.

413
00:22:09,613 --> 00:22:12,006
Where my brain sends
make signal to my body.

414
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:12,991
It’s like sneeze.

415
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,365
It’s irrepressible.

416
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,846
However, in two week I will you call. Okay.

417
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:18,846
Okay. Thank you very much.
 Take care.

418
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,839
Well, strike one.

419
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:25,871
But, like mom always says
don’t ever give up.

420
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,563
When I was little mom
never stop researching.

421
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:36,758
Because while there was no cure there
 might be ways to live a normal life.

422
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:42,418
Church mom?

423
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:45,777
Honey you are not gonna
 have to get a Bible lesson.

424
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:47,675
It's just a support group.

425
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:50,320
But we have to.

426
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:54,131
You need to connect with other
 people who have Tourette.

427
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:56,017
Find out who they live with it.

428
00:22:56,964 --> 00:22:57,650
Hey...

429
00:22:58,871 --> 00:22:59,804
Lets do it.

430
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,521
I am not going there ...

431
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,252
I had never seen anyone with
 Tourette before.

432
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:19,280
There were eye blinkers
and nose stretchers....

433
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:22,956
..foot stampers and neck chuck er....

434
00:23:23,287 --> 00:23:25,345
..some of them yelped coughed.

435
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,958
Is this what I looked
like to other people?

436
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,535
Come on Bo Bo.

437
00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:33,414
We have to learn. And start learning.

438
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:37,553
The Americans with Disabilities Act
gives us the right to do anything

439
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,745
.. we go on a place we want to.

440
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:41,735
But try to go to the movies.

441
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:44,899
..or consort or restaurant.

442
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:47,531
The law does not mean anything
when people yelling you to shut up.

443
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:50,116
I come home, and my parents
close the windows and blinds

444
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,907
because they don’t want
neighbour to see me...

445
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,938
No one was even trying to be accepted

446
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,345
The adults were out of work,
the kids stayed at home.

447
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:59,289
I knew one thing...

448
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:01,372
I didn’t wanna be like that.

449
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:05,684
Even his coaches and team
wouldn’t accept him.

450
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:08,115
Oh! I cann`t hear it.

451
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:11,116
Of course yours home going too..

452
00:24:11,736 --> 00:24:14,714
No. Brad goes to school
like any other kid.

453
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,455
These kids are like any other kids

454
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,501
School is a waste of time for them.

455
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:23,288
I got it in third grade,
just to save my sanity.

456
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,186
You want my advice.

457
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,406
You will do the same.

458
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:34,144
Lets go Bo Bo.

459
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:39,682
They're supposed to be a  support ...
But where is the support?

460
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:42,055
Just hide away rest of your life?

461
00:24:42,157 --> 00:24:46,230
I am really sorry that I brought
 you here. Honey I just..Forget this.

462
00:24:46,477 --> 00:24:48,073
I don’t wanna forget this, mom

463
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:49,958
 people let Tourette wins.

464
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:51,321
We never gonna do that.

465
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:53,975
Its difficult to imagine
that at the age of 12

466
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,581
I would find a genuine
 philosophy to live by.

467
00:24:57,878 --> 00:25:01,016
But here was this,
the defining moment

468
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:05,292
To always face my adversity head on.

469
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:09,730
When I went my next interview
I decided to be even more across.

470
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:12,097
Get the Tourette theme
 out of the way  first.

471
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:14,947
And then dazzle them with my
approach to teachings.

472
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,656
 ....very successful,
 in spite your Tourette.

473
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:20,045
I worked very harder to become
a best teacher I can be.

474
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,073
Thank you for coming here.
I will let you know.

475
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,333
Thanks.

476
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,939
So much should being a front.

477
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:31,068
For my third interview I decided to
 avoid discussing my Tourette at all.

478
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:35,674
Each week I like to send home a
progress report to my students` parents

479
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:41,985
I like to give my students..through this
they can interact in the classroom.

480
00:25:43,306 --> 00:25:46,640
But also keep to the parents
 closely involved.

481
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,387
Ron it was a huge mistake
not mentioning my Tourette.

482
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:57,123
It was like, you know,
I was trying to hide it.

483
00:25:57,873 --> 00:25:59,212
Okay. That’s the negative.

484
00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:01,959
Now the negative is that
 you get to stop stressing me out.

485
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:05,860
Stressing me out?
But the positive is that.......... Hey.

486
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,813
the other seems that

487
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,830
I just....

488
00:26:09,377 --> 00:26:10,404
I gonna wait for the call.

489
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:12,870
The positive is  you come out with me.

490
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:15,006
My new girlfriend, she has a room mate.

491
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:18,070
Would you stop trying to set me off

492
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,833
When I am ready to date.

493
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,704
I will date.

494
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:22,743
Come on, she's heard all about you.

495
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,510
And she still wants to meet you.

496
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:26,986
Oh thanks. You’re kind.

497
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,592
Listen, I want to relax. Okay
And wanna watch the Braves.

498
00:26:29,739 --> 00:26:31,337
We all wanna watch the Braves

499
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:32,864
Get changed

500
00:26:33,331 --> 00:26:35,205
"Someone like you.."

501
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:39,219
Ron told me that you’re finding
a job,  how are you doing?

502
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:40,953
Aah.. Pretty good!

503
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:44,988
Nobody hired me yet. I guess they
 are busy fighting get to me.

504
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,280
You do this?

505
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:53,793
I am impressed by this.

506
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:54,213
You should be.

507
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,856
I was not expacting this O..

508
00:26:56,924 --> 00:26:57,786
That’s amazing!

509
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,891
- But I’m pretty good.
- You are.

510
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:03,268
So you are really a sport fan?

511
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:05,173
- Aa.. yes big fan.
- Okay.

512
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:08,305
Soccer..... Soft ball.....Tennis..

513
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,581
Yep.. I have (been) learn in the college
but not good enough for the

514
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:15,175
I understand, because I wished I.
It isn’t good enough to him.

515
00:27:15,228 --> 00:27:17,028
- Who?
- Him

516
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:21,943
-  Are you wanna be a "mesca"
- Hmm..

517
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:24,042
- His name is Homer.
- Homer

518
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:26,921
-And it’s a life long ambition.
- Okay. Alright.

519
00:27:31,124 --> 00:27:33,257
Don’t look now. Don’t look now.

520
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:35,859
There is a guys behind us
and I don’t want his problem is

521
00:27:35,973 --> 00:27:37,246
Keep staring.

522
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:39,459
Aah..

523
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:42,356
I actually get that they look a lot.

524
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:44,242
It's a look an envy.

525
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,289
It’s thinking how can I make
all noises like that guys?

526
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:52,418
You’ve such a great attitude about you.

527
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,835
Goodbye Homer. Bye.

528
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:02,349
- Bye Ron.
- Bye Bye.

529
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,301
Bye Homer

530
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,294
So that must have gone well.
Ha?

531
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:09,839
- Did you ask to be seen again?
- Yes I Asked.

532
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:11,778
Yes, but you know the
 second date syndrome.

533
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,358
You know, I'm a great guy,
 it was lot of  fun, but ...

534
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:16,397
Your tics are just too cool for her.

535
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:21,002
I actually said that my
roommate Brad smell so bad.

536
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:23,555
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

537
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,512
This is Brad.

538
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,507
Oh, hi dad.

539
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:41,834
Yeah, No  Ron would be called that
You know I've been so busy ...

540
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:46,694
No. I haven’t had lunch yet.

541
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:49,329
Alright. that sounds great.

542
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:50,853
Where do you wanna meet?

543
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,533
Lunch at Dad's work.

544
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:56,556
He wouldn’t have to worry
 about my noises there.

545
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,924
 Let me know if you need more
 of these trusses. Okay?

546
00:29:03,985 --> 00:29:04,778
Alright.

547
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,184
- Hey!
- Hi Dad

548
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,650
- You could reach.
- Of course.

549
00:29:07,697 --> 00:29:09,570
We have lunch outside my office?
little more private.

550
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,177
Alright.

551
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:14,924
Dianne wondering when
you will come by.

552
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:17,798
- I guess it has pretty busy with job.
-  Have you got?

553
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:19,673
Still  interviewing.

554
00:29:22,484 --> 00:29:23,871
How’s that going?

555
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,364
I think you are in trouble
with those rubbish

556
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,171
You can say the word, dad, Tourette.

557
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:30,634
Some of them mark it.
Some don’t mark.

558
00:29:33,803 --> 00:29:35,889
- And how is your money holding out ?
- I am not asking you for money.

559
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,176
I know that. You never ask
me for anything.

560
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,973
No.

561
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,686
But if you ever do, get sure
 you know you get a job.....

562
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:42,971
I am gonna teach there. Okay?.

563
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:45,238
I can not let anything get with that.

564
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:46,194
Okay.

565
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:50,179
I’m just saying that it is nothing wrong
with keeping other options open in case
things don’t work out.

566
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:52,279
You know there are other
things besides teaching.

567
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,418
Not for me.

568
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:58,926
Dad could never understand my optimism.

569
00:30:00,638 --> 00:30:02,592
Like, when I graduated middle school....

570
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,798
I was really hopeful for things
would be different.

571
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:07,470
What’s a matter Brad? Eating alone?

572
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:12,092
Make a fresh start.
New school. New friends.

573
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:14,562
....and same result.

574
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:17,255
Today we gonna talking about fractions.

575
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,394
Fractions are your friends.

576
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,973
We use fractions in everyday life......

577
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:24,891
......you just don’t realize it.

578
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:28,195
For example, say your mother bakes a cake.

579
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:29,723
She cuts that .......

580
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:33,039
Cohen?

581
00:30:34,054 --> 00:30:35,767
Just go to the principal’s office.

582
00:30:40,568 --> 00:30:43,549
Not the best way to introduce
 myself to the Principal.

583
00:30:55,822 --> 00:30:57,729
What do you think the school for, Brad?

584
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:01,789
- Sorry for disturbing the class.
- You aren’t answering my question.

585
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:03,628
What’s the school for?

586
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:07,054
To educate.
Isn’t it?

587
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:09,931
To use knowledge without ignorance.

588
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:20,049
The school orchestra has a concert
 this afternoon, do you plan to go?

589
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:22,747
No Sir....my tics would ruin the music.

590
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,830
I want you to be there.

591
00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:00,397
Everybody just keep your seats
 for a minute, please.

592
00:32:01,348 --> 00:32:03,927
Thank you. Enjoy the Concert

593
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:06,641
Great job.

594
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:12,621
Did you hear any noises
 during quite breaks?

595
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:14,299
Yes.....

596
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:17,790
Yeah, Sure did I.

597
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,039
The pretty annoying. Aren’t they?

598
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,732
The person makes these
noises is Brad Cohen.

599
00:32:31,746 --> 00:32:32,873
Come on, up here Brad.

600
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:13,682
Do you like making these noises
and upsetting people, Brad?

601
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:15,836
No Sir.

602
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:17,930
Then why do you do it?

603
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:22,408
Because I have Tourette Syndrome.

604
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:23,791
What’s that?

605
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:29,020
It's something in my brain
that causes me make rude noises.

606
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:33,231
But you can control if you wanna, right?

607
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:35,217
No......No Sir.

608
00:33:36,044 --> 00:33:37,817
- It’s a sickness.
- Hum...

609
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:40,765
Well, why cann`t you just get cured?

610
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:42,784
There isn’t any cure.

611
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:48,634
I don’t like making noises anymore....

612
00:33:49,434 --> 00:33:50,602
...then you like hearing now.

613
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:54,161
That’s even  worse when I get stressed,

614
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:57,482
when you do not accept
that I cann`t stop them.

615
00:33:58,541 --> 00:34:02,529
But..when I feel accepted,
not so bad.

616
00:34:04,684 --> 00:34:05,710
What can we do?

617
00:34:07,397 --> 00:34:09,707
And I mean everyone in this school.

618
00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:15,210
What can we do to help you, Brad?

619
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:21,353
I just wanna be treated
like everybody else.

620
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:27,372
Good job!

621
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:28,960
You may sit down.

622
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:07,936
A few words....A little education...

623
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:11,968
....and it was like opening a door
through a brand new world.

624
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:28,137
Now someday, somewhere I knew
Tourette or no Tourette

625
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:30,791
I was going to be a teacher.

626
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:38,314
I had no choice.

627
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:41,128
But to prove Tourette
would never get the best way

628
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:44,368
If  I quit, I would agree everyone....

629
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:47,712
who had ever told me I was
barking  up the wrong tree.

630
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:51,372
Hum.....

631
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:53,250
hum.

632
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:54,728
I am sorry about it.

633
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:56,349
For air conditioning now.

634
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,559
Supposed to be fixed now?

635
00:35:57,628 --> 00:35:58,692
No. It doesn’t concern.

636
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:03,783
Well you’re resume looks okay.

637
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:06,805
And we do have an opening
in 5th grade.

638
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:08,715
Okay.

639
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:13,113
But I do have to tell you
this is a tough place to work.

640
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:16,054
We get some really hard cases.

641
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:18,198
Well I’ll take that as a challenge.

642
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:19,879
I don’t think that
 any kid is hopeless.

643
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:22,871
Nearly all wanna learn.
You cann`t give up.

644
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:24,330
Get to find around a
way to teach them.

645
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:26,367
Ah.. You get stucking your throat.
would you like a drink?

646
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,596
I have Tourette Syndrome.
I like to tell you....

647
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,563
Tourette? Isn’t....

648
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,682
That you yell out obscenities.

649
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:35,367
That is coprolalia.
It’s a rare symptom.

650
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:37,306
It’s a          people Tourettes have

651
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:40,028
Okay. Listen. Did it not tell me
that you are gonna be handicap

652
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,202
How do expect to handover
a bunch of wild students....

653
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:45,613
with handicap like you ?

654
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:46,394
Well...

655
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:48,318
.... by educating them.

656
00:36:48,696 --> 00:36:50,856
I let them know that
it’s ok to talk about it.

657
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:53,643
These students would laugh at you.

658
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,139
Aaa.....

659
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:00,789
Not..Not when they understand
it’s simply....

660
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,316
Okay. I have seen teacher
with disabilities before .

661
00:37:04,698 --> 00:37:06,735
And never with what you get.

662
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,584
I just don’t see how you
could ever teach a class.

663
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:14,060
I can teach.

664
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,774
Look at my resume.
 Look at it.

665
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:18,916
Okay. I was very
 successful student.

666
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:20,433
My Tourette never posed a problem.

667
00:37:21,777 --> 00:37:23,413
- I can teach.
- A bottom line.

668
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:25,679
I need somebody now
 for the 5th grade

669
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:28,576
(If) you wanna teach here.....

670
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:32,049
...you gonna have to refrain from
making these noises in class.

671
00:37:36,995 --> 00:37:38,805
Thank you very much for the
interview.

672
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:40,426
But don’t you want a job?

673
00:37:40,615 --> 00:37:41,737
Yes, Actually.

674
00:37:41,974 --> 00:37:43,522
I want it really.

675
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:44,500
But I would never....

676
00:37:44,748 --> 00:37:46,874
....ever work for man who doesn’t
 care about his students

677
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,568
So I take my port folio
and take no more your time

678
00:37:51,695 --> 00:37:52,871
You got a great boss.

679
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:48,287
It was the worst interview
 I ever had.

680
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:51,354
Only they could like to look at
 my Tourette.

681
00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:52,971
If all any of them see.

682
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:55,983
Well, honey if they cann`t see
what a great teacher you would be.

683
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:58,219
That is their failure not yours.

684
00:38:58,273 --> 00:39:00,140
Well, it should seem like my failure.

685
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:05,558
Well... If you say so... you know what....

686
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,182
Why don’t you just throw
the    and come home?

687
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,350
- I’ll buy you a ticket.
- I am not saying that.

688
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,064
Really? But sounds like that
what you saying.

689
00:39:12,098 --> 00:39:13,871
It sounds like you `re
 letting Tourette win.

690
00:39:14,258 --> 00:39:16,111
I am not letting Tourette win.

691
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:18,278
- Really?
- Yes, Really!

692
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,276
Look. I never gonna give up. Just...

693
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:23,898
I have to find a right school.

694
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,637
You will Bo Bo...... You will.

695
00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:34,903
So I decided it wasn’t Tourette.

696
00:39:35,162 --> 00:39:37,298
I just hadn’t found a right school yet.

697
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:41,524
I would keep working and I wasn’t quitting
until I found there Principal.

698
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:45,719
I made a map of every school
where I hadn’t interviewed.

699
00:40:14,656 --> 00:40:17,669
If the principal wasn’t in,
I gave my resume to a secretary

700
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,980
...or     and asked them to drop it off
when the principal returned

701
00:40:21,243 --> 00:40:23,950
I didn’t care. I needed a job.

702
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:32,761
I wasn’t gonna stop until I had.

703
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:38,076
you will be starting at the bottom
but that’s not a big deal.

704
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,829
That's where I started,
and nearly worked 7 to 4.

705
00:40:40,935 --> 00:40:44,554
I told you this is only  part time,
I need keep my morning open for interviews.

706
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:47,226
- I thought your school had started.
- No. Not at all.

707
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,865
Well, we'll see what happens.

708
00:40:49,785 --> 00:40:53,277
Here are tools for trainee.
At least for the time being.

709
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:54,853
Like I said, from below.

710
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,048
But every job is important here and
know where you can like it.

711
00:40:58,466 --> 00:41:01,360
- And as your time begin ...
- Do not you hear what I just said?

712
00:41:01,844 --> 00:41:04,354
I only work here until
 I get a teaching job.

713
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:08,469
All that stuff has to go to dumpster.

714
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,616
The hiring season was ending.

715
00:41:13,866 --> 00:41:17,257
My interviews had dried up.
School had started.

716
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:20,683
I was running out of time
and money and hope.

717
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:22,477
"DOOR BELL RINGS"

718
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:31,717
Dianne.

719
00:41:32,229 --> 00:41:35,581
I gave up on you ever come to me
so I just came to you.

720
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:36,709
Are you busy?

721
00:41:37,674 --> 00:41:41,683
It was my step mom Dianne,who was
trying to build bridges with Bo Bo.

722
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:44,275
Your dad built his business
 with his own hands,

723
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:46,755
You cannot blame him for wanting
you to be part of it participate.

724
00:41:47,444 --> 00:41:48,758
You just be your dad.

725
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:51,474
He wants you in his life.

726
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:57,281
So, how do you like Atlanta?

727
00:41:57,888 --> 00:41:59,238
Do you meet any nice girl?

728
00:42:02,065 --> 00:42:04,978
just say the typical things, right?

729
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,820
Let me give you a refill.

730
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:08,610
Brad... Brad...

731
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:12,652
Your dad loves you....

732
00:42:13,675 --> 00:42:14,735
..so much.

733
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,210
you just do not want to see get hurt.

734
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,924
The only thing that hurt is the fact that
he has never accepted who I am.

735
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:28,196
See, he’s got this idea for a
perfect son  who is normal....

736
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:29,494
...and does normal things.

737
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:31,684
Well, I never gonna be normal.

738
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:35,084
Or may be that’s not his idea, Brad.

739
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:36,946
May be that’s yours.

740
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:40,371
You’re right. You are not normal.

741
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:42,931
You have the gift....

742
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:45,412
.....to teach.

743
00:42:48,663 --> 00:42:51,062
And it’s not in spite of your Tourette....

744
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,272
.....it’s because of him.

745
00:43:03,942 --> 00:43:05,302
I have to go.

746
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,330
TELEPHONE RINGS

747
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:30,357
Hello, it’s Brad.

748
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:33,931
Aaa.... Yes. That’s a street dog.

749
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:34,635
Aa.. ha...

750
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:37,389
Yep, Brad... Brad  Cohen.

751
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:41,611
10 o’clock is perfect for me.

752
00:43:42,626 --> 00:43:43,346
Absolutely.

753
00:43:43,773 --> 00:43:44,913
Okay. Great!

754
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:10,242
You must be Brad Cohen.

755
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:12,079
Aa.. ha..

756
00:44:13,397 --> 00:44:15,891
- My name is Phil, I'm the principal
around here.

757
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:18,302
- I'm Hillary. Assistant principal.
- Hello.

758
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:19,935
Come on in the office, Brad.

759
00:44:20,062 --> 00:44:22,367
We heard you coming all
the way from the parking lot

760
00:44:23,591 --> 00:44:25,525
You have been making the round.

761
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,402
25 schools so far.

762
00:44:27,743 --> 00:44:28,437
- And....

763
00:44:28,557 --> 00:44:30,220
-  Here, here is my resume.
- Oh here? Oh...

764
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:33,241
We can look at that I mean, Brad,
just come on in and......

765
00:44:33,628 --> 00:44:35,317
 Tell us why do you wanna be a teacher?

766
00:44:35,385 --> 00:44:36,558
 Okay.

767
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:40,055
Well, its a hope. (HE LAUGHS)

768
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:43,231
It’s what I always wanted to be
ever since I was in the school.

769
00:44:43,419 --> 00:44:45,672
You must have pretty inspired in teachers.

770
00:44:45,857 --> 00:44:48,818
Well, I had an inspiring
principal Mr. Mayer.

771
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:50,645
But my teachers,..

772
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:54,666
..they really only inspired me to be
gonna teachers they never were.

773
00:44:55,502 --> 00:44:57,104
What kind of teacher is that?

774
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:01,565
One who makes possible for
kid for learn even if he’s different.

775
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,858
In a way that.... the best teacher
 I ever had was my Tourette.

776
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:10,507
- You don’t have to talk about.
- No No it’s okay.

777
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,347
I make a point of being
 open about it.

778
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:15,251
It’s a never out of my students.

779
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:17,666
They can ask me anything
they want about, anytime.

780
00:45:18,522 --> 00:45:21,068
You must get some pretty
interesting questions.

781
00:45:21,148 --> 00:45:24,595
Oh! Ya.., sometimes
 it gets really personal.

782
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,313
I hope this question is
not too personal, Brad.

783
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,250
Do you make those
noises in your sleep?

784
00:45:34,904 --> 00:45:35,751
I don’t know.

785
00:45:36,731 --> 00:45:37,432
I am in sleep.

786
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:43,296
No. No. I don’t tic in my sleep.

787
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,941
When I am relax the noises
give a little bit of break....

788
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:47,395
....just like now.

789
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,401
Okay Brad. I wanna hear more
about your teaching philosophy.

790
00:45:52,975 --> 00:45:55,201
I would love to tell you
about my teaching philosophy.

791
00:45:55,626 --> 00:45:58,206
We talked for nearly two hours.

792
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:00,724
It was the best interview I ever had.

793
00:46:02,247 --> 00:46:04,269
Well, Brad it was a pleasure
 to meet you.

794
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:05,319
Yeah.. Me too. Me too.

795
00:46:05,354 --> 00:46:07,806
There are still many
teachers to interview..

796
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:09,893
...but I'll let you know
what we made a decision.

797
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,028
Okay. Great

798
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:12,781
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

799
00:46:14,753 --> 00:46:15,593
Yes.

800
00:46:19,054 --> 00:46:23,680
Still my constant companion is always
warned me not to get my hope so.

801
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,389
But hope is a hard habit to break.

802
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:10,043
I was called one last time.

803
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,875
And asked to come in and meet
with 2nd grade students.

804
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:18,242
- Oh. So you student taught
2nd grade. Oh I love 2nd grade.

805
00:47:18,924 --> 00:47:20,624
Because you still so open minded.

806
00:47:21,317 --> 00:47:23,250
They are open to everything

807
00:47:23,452 --> 00:47:26,212
You do manage to maintain
little discipline, right?

808
00:47:26,494 --> 00:47:27,819
 While we being so open...

809
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:30,693
I do let them know what
the boundaries are. Yes.

810
00:47:31,508 --> 00:47:35,685
So Brad what do you think is the most
 important thing you have to teach?

811
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:41,020
Yeah. Well.. Besides the importance
of reading and value of math....

812
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:43,666
...that it’s ok to be yourself.

813
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:48,234
It’s okay to color outside
the lines, if that is who you are.

814
00:47:48,341 --> 00:47:51,428
So it’s okay to ignore
the boundaries?

815
00:47:51,729 --> 00:47:53,603
No I ... I didn’t that.......

816
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:59,282
I am sorry but how could
you expect kids to learn,

817
00:47:59,316 --> 00:48:00,643
when you doing that all the time

818
00:48:00,692 --> 00:48:03,158
- Oh come on, Brenda....
- No. No. It’s okay.

819
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:06,091
It’s a valid question and
 I wanna answer it.

820
00:48:07,486 --> 00:48:12,259
Before they know me kids sometimes do
think I am just weird or even scary.

821
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:14,731
But once I educate them
about my Tourette..

822
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,330
..and they can see
Mr. Cohen is a real person.

823
00:48:17,637 --> 00:48:22,311
Who just happens to make funny
 noises, well, then they accept me..

824
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,151
....as a good teacher.

825
00:48:24,492 --> 00:48:27,085
Just like they accept our view.

826
00:48:29,631 --> 00:48:33,537
Well, may be we should all try
 to be more like 2nd graders.

827
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:36,743
Does anyone have any other
question for Mr. Cohen?

828
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,527
Brad, thanks for coming in.

829
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,884
This school will be in touch
with you and so just be patient.

830
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:47,514
It’s hard to patient when you feel
you're going for a last chance.

831
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,174
And patience was never my constant
 companion strong with me.

832
00:48:51,742 --> 00:48:53,575
I guess you never heard that school.

833
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:56,081
No. Not yet,  they're still interviewing.

834
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:58,023
- No worries.
- Okay.

835
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:01,577
-What that suppose to mean?
- I just said okay.

836
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,956
I know what you mean.

837
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:05,045
You don’t think anybody will
hire me if they have choice.

838
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:06,545
Do you read the mind now?

839
00:49:07,023 --> 00:49:09,840
You know that this is
gonna be my last day here

840
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,696
Why don’t you wait to
if you get the job first?

841
00:49:12,022 --> 00:49:14,064
I’m gonna get the job, dad.

842
00:49:14,354 --> 00:49:15,481
-I just have to stay focused.

843
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,914
Why cann`t you just stay focused
 to realistic at the same time.

844
00:49:17,992 --> 00:49:19,352
What’s wrong with that?

845
00:49:29,649 --> 00:49:31,035
Well, Are you alright man?

846
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,828
- What is that happens while you driving?
- I am fine.

847
00:49:35,968 --> 00:49:37,461
Yeah. I don’t know.

848
00:49:37,862 --> 00:49:39,193
Yes, you see another doctor.

849
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,308
I have seen doctor in whole
 life, Ron. They don’t help.

850
00:49:42,498 --> 00:49:44,487
Well, you think you need to see somebody?

851
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:47,461
I really don’t.

852
00:49:59,649 --> 00:50:02,134
There I was waiting for
the phone ring again.

853
00:50:02,748 --> 00:50:05,527
I tried to convince my self
something good would happen.

854
00:50:06,821 --> 00:50:10,461
DOOR BELL RINGS

855
00:50:15,434 --> 00:50:16,674
My kid brother.

856
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:18,876
Not exactly what I had in mind.

857
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,826
How you doing, Bo Bo.

858
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,804
What.. what are you doing here?
Why didn’t you tell me you’re coming?

859
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:28,429
You know you're         , right?

860
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:31,387
Did mom send you to check up for me?

861
00:50:31,547 --> 00:50:33,054
Why? You need checking upon?

862
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,477
No. but...

863
00:50:34,837 --> 00:50:38,286
Where do I put my stuff?
- That’s great. You get the couch.

864
00:50:38,859 --> 00:50:41,339
Wow, nice club. Is that new?

865
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:43,377
Dad really borrowed.

866
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:45,750
 He thought maybe
you could play little golf.

867
00:50:45,824 --> 00:50:47,243
I am fit to in your club.

868
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:51,971
So what do you think
3 from here little, bro.

869
00:50:52,196 --> 00:50:54,106
By the way thanks for the ride.

870
00:50:54,446 --> 00:50:56,013
Thanks Dad. Oh, wait ...

871
00:50:56,524 --> 00:50:58,331
I forgot that you are not speaking.

872
00:50:58,442 --> 00:51:00,182
I don’t wanna talk about dad right now.

873
00:51:00,322 --> 00:51:04,111
You just saying to distract me because
you know I’m going to beat you.

874
00:51:04,204 --> 00:51:06,924
I am serious Brad.
You and dad are getting along.

875
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:10,376
We get along just fine
as long as we keep a long distance.

876
00:51:10,522 --> 00:51:12,862
Is that you moved down here to
keep a long distance?

877
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,261
I mean, you do not give
 anything to prove, right.

878
00:51:15,314 --> 00:51:18,381
What are you now Jeff, shrink?
Dr. Jeff? Huh?

879
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:20,570
I am sorry sir.

880
00:51:21,149 --> 00:51:23,843
I am going to have ask you
to stop making those noises.

881
00:51:24,091 --> 00:51:26,274
-Look pal, you are not doing.......
- No, no, I cannot, Jeff. I got it..

882
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,041
- Look, that is not fair to other golfers.
.

883
00:51:28,175 --> 00:51:30,865
 I understand, I cann`t help
 making those noises

884
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:34,368
Because I have Tourette syndrome.
 It’s a neurological disorder.

885
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:35,287
- I would like to tell you
 about it. Since I

886
00:51:35,335 --> 00:51:37,335
You get to have leave the course.

887
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:39,624
I get to think about the other members.

888
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,630
Hey Joe, leave these guys alone. It’s fine.

889
00:51:43,879 --> 00:51:47,359
Hey man, we are two and some of our
buddies don’t appeared to be showing.

890
00:51:48,046 --> 00:51:49,166
Would you like to join us?

891
00:51:50,043 --> 00:51:52,762
If you don’t leave, I am gonna
 have to call security.

892
00:51:52,803 --> 00:51:54,063
Okay. Okay. Hmm..... Ok.

893
00:51:55,156 --> 00:51:57,050
Thanks guys. May next time, right?

894
00:51:57,357 --> 00:51:59,937
Jeff, come on. Come on buddy.

895
00:52:00,515 --> 00:52:01,629
Thanks

896
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,990
Come on Jeff, don’t think
 I haven’t seen it before.

897
00:52:08,137 --> 00:52:10,966
How can you stand living in a world
where everybody is so ignorant.

898
00:52:11,259 --> 00:52:12,217
Everybody is not.

899
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:14,745
You saw the golfers back there.
They want to back for me.

900
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,346
- My life is full of people like that.
- That is what my experience.

901
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:20,323
Well, that’s because you’re always
 getting into fight taken up for me.

902
00:52:20,424 --> 00:52:23,744
You and mom. You’ve always been
there for me, and my tics.

903
00:52:24,389 --> 00:52:25,489
- You know what?
- What?

904
00:52:25,572 --> 00:52:27,275
You are getting the tics. Be off.
Oh Ye?

905
00:52:27,322 --> 00:52:28,571
-First in car.
- What? Hey, Trickster.

906
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:31,930
Jeff’s visit did give a break for my words.

907
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,829
And right after he left
 I got call from the school.

908
00:52:36,268 --> 00:52:38,602
The principal wanted to see
me in his office....

909
00:52:40,288 --> 00:52:42,002
.....just like all times.

910
00:52:57,238 --> 00:52:58,671
Pretty noisy, huh?

911
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,033
And yet somehow the kids manage.

912
00:53:04,604 --> 00:53:05,433
Don’t they?

913
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:08,010
Yes they do.

914
00:53:08,711 --> 00:53:09,564
They do.

915
00:53:11,027 --> 00:53:13,808
Hillary and I discussed you
with the teachers.

916
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:19,352
And we talked about how proud
 we are of teaching our kinds...

917
00:53:19,705 --> 00:53:23,052
 to never let anything..
hold them back in life.

918
00:53:25,534 --> 00:53:28,287
And Hillary said if we
gonna talk to talk,.....

919
00:53:29,391 --> 00:53:31,131
..we need walk to walk.

920
00:53:32,987 --> 00:53:34,920
She's waiting for show
you your classroom.

921
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:36,086
HE LAUGHS

922
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,967
Welcome.

923
00:53:40,266 --> 00:53:43,813
The 2nd grade is overcrowded
so we have to create a new class.

924
00:53:44,047 --> 00:53:48,093
Your kids are being taken out of other room
so some of them might be a little confused.

925
00:53:48,376 --> 00:53:50,774
They have already been school
 for three weeks.

926
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,076
There is a students` register.

927
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:05,137
The fun starts on Monday, Brad.
Let me know is there anything you need.

928
00:54:05,895 --> 00:54:07,348
I need everything.

929
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,961
I looked down that register

930
00:54:09,108 --> 00:54:12,684
like I was announcing the starting
 line up for All Star Baseball.

931
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:17,772
- Hillary, this is ... thank you ...
- Hey! We thought you might need these.

932
00:54:19,206 --> 00:54:20,873
Hey everybody, bring them in.

933
00:54:21,898 --> 00:54:24,625
Just put them down anywhere.
We will get them arranged.

934
00:54:24,743 --> 00:54:27,031
Let me help you with that, thank you.

935
00:54:31,473 --> 00:54:33,353
Welcome to Mountain View.

936
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:38,608
Yeah, Mom is phenomenal but you know
 it take me so long to get here.

937
00:54:38,655 --> 00:54:41,683
So I remind myself that I am just
at the beginning.

938
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,726
Honey, that is .....

939
00:54:44,902 --> 00:54:46,535
..that is...wonderful news.

940
00:54:46,775 --> 00:54:49,457
- That’s wonderful.
- Yes, Mom it is absolutely wonderful.

941
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:52,148
But you know they are giving me
a contract for year. Okay.

942
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,829
So I have to prove to them that
they made the right choice.

943
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:57,216
Honey listen, take a moment to enjoy this.

944
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,530
Oh my God.. oh my..

945
00:54:58,598 --> 00:55:01,469
Did you call your father?
He is gonna be so proud of you

946
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:02,172
I will mom.

947
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:04,017

my Master Degree

00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,087
Okay, one thing at a time, alright?

952
00:55:14,173 --> 00:55:16,196
Listen, are there any cute
 teacher at that school?

953
00:55:16,263 --> 00:55:18,287
- Mom?
- I want you to be happy.

954
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:20,801
Okay, alright, yes.. don’t worry.
I am working in that too.

955
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:22,261
I get to go. Good-bye.

956
00:55:42,618 --> 00:55:43,718
You must be Brad.

957
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:46,955
You must be Nancy

958
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:49,995
- Hi, I am Brad.

959
00:55:51,705 --> 00:55:55,332
Right of course. I got some

Okay...me too.

962
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,381
My mom thinks it is dangerous.

963
00:56:03,821 --> 00:56:06,460
Well, Yeah. I mean you never know
what kind of weird you might meet.

964
00:56:07,267 --> 00:56:09,413

965
00:56:11,717 --> 00:56:12,883
Good I am quite.

966
00:56:13,994 --> 00:56:16,174
Actually you’re much
better than normal.

967
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:18,497
Thank you.

968
00:56:19,497 --> 00:56:20,463
So.. Aa....

00:56:21,292 --> 00:56:24,099

970
00:56:24,553 --> 00:56:26,486
Um.. Okay.  did.. did..you?

974
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:37,574
- Do you wanna like a Muffin?
- I am on a diet.

975
00:56:39,231 --> 00:56:40,897
I  would love a muffin.

976
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:52,600
My roommate is driving
me absolutely crazy.

977
00:56:53,131 --> 00:56:57,174
She never makes your
bed’s skirts. Clothes everywhere.

978
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,841
She always blasts in her music

979
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:04,424
Night and day. But, of course. whenever
I want to listen my music she always.......

980
00:57:04,485 --> 00:57:06,071
...says "you need to keep it down".

981
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:09,014
So what kind of music
do you listen to.

982
00:57:10,132 --> 00:57:13,423
Well..I’m... mostly old things.

983
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:19,965
Especially Sting, I love Sting,
 Madonna, Bon Jovi...

984
00:57:20,618 --> 00:57:22,366

- Not even  Milli Vanilli?

985
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:24,953
I love Milli Vanilli.

986
00:57:25,928 --> 00:57:27,025
Really?

987
00:57:27,245 --> 00:57:28,161
Yes. You too?

988
00:57:28,301 --> 00:57:32,363
We got be the only two people
 on earth that loved Milli Vanilli.

989
00:57:40,733 --> 00:57:42,760
Oh,  I had a really nice time,
thank you.

990
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,100
I shouldn’t have that Muffin. But....

991
00:57:47,889 --> 00:57:50,862
- I really enjoyed meeting you.
- Yeah, me too.

992
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:58,222
Okay. Well, thanks again Brad.

993
00:58:13,843 --> 00:58:16,280
I cann`t believe you.
You said she was perfect.

994
00:58:16,783 --> 00:58:19,219
She was perfect and I
 don’t wanna ruin it.

995
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,820
Asking him? seen again?

996
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:23,913
Oh! Right Second
date Syndrome.

997
00:58:24,593 --> 00:58:28,094
- So that can be your life?
- Nothing but first time on a date.

998
00:58:28,468 --> 00:58:30,275
How do you expect to have a relationship?

999
00:58:31,061 --> 00:58:32,195
May be I don’t.

1000
00:59:24,685 --> 00:59:27,107
"Babe, don't be shy
When you're holding my hand"

1001
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:30,884
"Cause this time goes back
You got to understand it's you."

1002
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:36,667
"Ba, ba, ba, baby in your eyes
I see it so clearly."

1003
00:59:36,694 --> 00:59:40,036
"that our love, it's so strong
And you never go wrong."

1004
00:59:40,612 --> 00:59:42,956
"I got the best for you."

1005
00:59:43,603 --> 00:59:49,400
"So I'm waiting down if you need someone
Baby call my line Call me anytime"

1006
00:59:50,377 --> 00:59:52,507
"I'll be there for you you you."

1007
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,399
"I've been searching high high high."

1008
00:59:59,212 --> 01:00:01,781
"I've been searching low."

1009
01:00:03,692 --> 01:00:06,997
"Ba ba ba ba ba baby...."

1010
01:00:08,437 --> 01:00:12,384
"Don't forget my number number........"

1011
01:00:13,351 --> 01:00:15,179
Come on kids. Get in.

1012
01:00:17,435 --> 01:00:18,768
Weird......

1013
01:00:25,898 --> 01:00:29,542
Did your teacher warn you that
Mr. Cohen makes funny noises.

1014
01:00:29,622 --> 01:00:31,813
Yes........

1015
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:35,528
- She said you have Tu....Tour....
- Tourette Syndrome.

1016
01:00:35,773 --> 01:00:39,338
Okay, anything you wanna know
about it I want you to ask.

1017
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:40,623
Yes.

1018
01:00:40,897 --> 01:00:42,064
Is it catching?

1019
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:45,070
No. Absolutely not.
You have to be born with it.

1020
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:46,150
 Like I was

1021
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:47,060
Hm...

1022
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:48,546
Don’t that hurt?

1023
01:00:48,797 --> 01:00:53,432
Well sometimes. When my neck jerks.
But the noises do not hurt at all.

1024
01:00:53,946 --> 01:00:55,880
These are great questions.
 Keep it coming.

1025
01:00:56,582 --> 01:00:58,623
It is okay to ask me anything...

1026
01:00:58,891 --> 01:00:59,762
....about Tourette.

1027
01:00:59,863 --> 01:01:00,556
Yes.

1028
01:01:00,715 --> 01:01:02,001
Can you go to movies?

1029
01:01:02,234 --> 01:01:06,335
Yes, I can go to movies but
sometimes I get kicked out.

1030
01:01:06,451 --> 01:01:08,317
And that makes me sad.

1031
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,225
What’s the bunny’s name?

1032
01:01:12,922 --> 01:01:14,958
Wa ... Wa ... Waffle.

1033
01:01:15,158 --> 01:01:16,672
Wa..wa..waffle?

1034
01:01:18,852 --> 01:01:20,692
His name is just Waffle.

1035
01:01:20,732 --> 01:01:22,259
Alright guys.

1036
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:25,208
Any more questions about Tourette?

1037
01:01:27,075 --> 01:01:28,157
Anyone.

1038
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,395
Are they ever gonna make
you cured Mr. Cohen?

1039
01:01:32,726 --> 01:01:35,453
Well, right now there is no
medicine  that can cure Tourette.

1040
01:01:35,714 --> 01:01:36,554
But its okay.

1041
01:01:36,713 --> 01:01:39,526
Because I’ve learnt to accept it
and I don’t let it ruin my life.

1042
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:41,284
Aha....

1043
01:01:41,604 --> 01:01:43,177
What can you do? Like...

1044
01:01:43,493 --> 01:01:44,607
.....can you not eat?

1045
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:48,175
Oho..oo... I can eat.
Okay I eat a lot in fact.

1046
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:50,812
I can do anything that anybody
 else can do. Except there is.......

1047
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:53,876
....one thing that Mr. Cohen
can never do.

1048
01:01:54,186 --> 01:01:56,667
- What? What is it?
- No I can not..No I just cann`t...

1049
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,300
- No...
- Come on tell us. Tell us.

1050
01:01:59,392 --> 01:02:01,159
Yeah, Tell us....

1051
01:02:01,386 --> 01:02:04,019
Mr. Cohen can never play.....

1052
01:02:04,273 --> 01:02:06,546
....Hide and Go Seek.

1053
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:09,962
Why cann`t you play Hide and Seek?

1054
01:02:10,089 --> 01:02:12,157
Because they hear him, stupid.

1055
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,624
Well that’s the right answer
 but its a wrong word.....

1056
01:02:15,752 --> 01:02:18,630
...because there won’t be  any name
coining in Mr.Cohen`s class.

1057
01:02:19,164 --> 01:02:20,458
Excuse me where are you going?

1058
01:02:20,552 --> 01:02:21,326
To bathroom.

1059
01:02:21,427 --> 01:02:23,126
- And what’s your name?
- Thomas

1060
01:02:23,353 --> 01:02:26,907
Well Thomas, if you wanna leave your
seat  you have to ask for  permission.

1061
01:02:28,504 --> 01:02:29,738
Weird.

1062
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,442
- Bye Mr. Cohen.
- By Calvin.

1063
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:39,009
- Bye Mr. Cohen.
- Oh.. Bye Heather.

1064
01:02:39,203 --> 01:02:40,723
I’ll see you tomorrow.

1065
01:02:43,906 --> 01:02:47,127
- I really like your class Mr. Cohen.
- Oh.. Thank you Amanda.

1066
01:02:47,711 --> 01:02:49,850
- How are you doing Mr. Wright?
- I am fine.

1067
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:55,016
Four eyes! Four eyes!

1068
01:02:55,136 --> 01:02:57,063
Can you leave me alone?

1069
01:02:57,771 --> 01:03:01,356
Eli, Thomas, which one of you guys
thinks that you can help me? Huh?

1070
01:03:01,463 --> 01:03:03,124
I can.... I can....

1071
01:03:03,165 --> 01:03:06,356
Alright. who will decide. I need
to get this ball to put in that bin,

1072
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:10,209
Rock, paper, scissors, sheet.

1073
01:03:10,694 --> 01:03:12,181
Alright Eli You win today.

1074
01:03:12,374 --> 01:03:13,241
I’m leaving....

1075
01:03:13,365 --> 01:03:15,692
It’s okay Thomas you can help him

1076
01:03:22,795 --> 01:03:27,246
Sorry, I stuck you with Thomas.
He was making my class  impossible.

1077
01:03:27,613 --> 01:03:29,065
He’s got a whole out there problem.

1078
01:03:29,276 --> 01:03:32,616
ADD, ADHD, OCD.

1079
01:03:32,854 --> 01:03:35,020
If you want my advice, send him
 to special classes.

1080
01:03:37,796 --> 01:03:39,549
I cann`t.... I cann`t do that.

1081
01:03:39,924 --> 01:03:42,815
See how you feel after it crashes
 some of your classes.

1082
01:03:43,196 --> 01:03:44,249
I will be alright.

1083
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:45,663
I just need to get set off.

1084
01:03:45,803 --> 01:03:47,211
I can wait for tomorrow.

1085
01:03:47,586 --> 01:03:48,406
Okay.

1086
01:04:04,399 --> 01:04:06,586
You make more noise
than my air horn.

1087
01:04:06,716 --> 01:04:08,695
Sounds like you get to have
a case of  Tourette.

1088
01:04:11,133 --> 01:04:13,280
I am just kidding with you, son.

1089
01:04:13,593 --> 01:04:15,567
I got a dispatcher with Tourette.

1090
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:18,537
If you ever need any
crop country all in

1091
01:04:18,924 --> 01:04:19,857
Just call for Maxine.

1092
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:21,986
Hey! Um.. Do you have the card?

1093
01:04:23,466 --> 01:04:25,873
I was not serious, son.

1094
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:27,522
Unless you are in the ship business.

1095
01:04:27,669 --> 01:04:29,316
No I teach in 2nd grade.

1096
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:33,130
- Here is the card.
- Alright.

1097
01:04:33,177 --> 01:04:35,803
Maxine gave me a great
idea for geography lesson.

1098
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:38,018
- Thank you so much, Maxine.
- You’re welcome.

1099
01:04:38,052 --> 01:04:38,899
Safe trucking.

1100
01:04:40,821 --> 01:04:43,481
I found myself focusing
and teaching all the time.

1101
01:04:44,951 --> 01:04:47,031
Well... Almost.

1102
01:05:23,405 --> 01:05:25,398
- You know I’ve just realized.
- What?

1103
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:27,894
All ducks have Tourette.

1104
01:05:28,977 --> 01:05:30,471
Why is that?

1105
01:05:31,779 --> 01:05:34,032
I do not know. But birds
have feather.

1106
01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:51,889
- So it doesn’t bother you . Does it?
- What?

1107
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:55,655
You know what.
My Tourette...my noises.

1108
01:05:57,531 --> 01:06:00,885
Not when I compare them
 to the noises other guys make.

1109
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:05,115
You know like braggers, talkers,

1110
01:06:05,162 --> 01:06:09,946
You know,like ego centric
 humor challenged idiots....

1111
01:06:10,161 --> 01:06:13,114
Seriously you know
it does not bother me at all.

1112
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,875
Thanks to keep me laughing.

1113
01:06:15,069 --> 01:06:17,095
Well, don’t say that. You know how
I get under pressure.

1114
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:19,338
Oh! I’m sorry.

1115
01:06:20,827 --> 01:06:23,617
Dad always said I gonna marry
somebody who made me laugh.

1116
01:06:26,962 --> 01:06:31,188
You know that is anything
 to do with.. with  anything.

1117
01:06:40,395 --> 01:06:42,075
Say something

1118
01:06:44,955 --> 01:06:45,815
Quack!

1119
01:06:46,566 --> 01:06:49,383
Hey! Don’t laugh I was just
doing a serious Quack.

1120
01:06:51,129 --> 01:06:52,466
I got you, Love.

1121
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,834
- Mr.Cohen......
- Hey....

1122
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:05,071
My mom said to ask
 if it is okay.

1123
01:07:05,802 --> 01:07:07,082
It is ok, Heather.

1124
01:07:07,293 --> 01:07:09,125
If I give this to Waffle.

1125
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:13,325
You tell your mom that
 I said that’s fine. Okay?

1126
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:16,572
- Did he say okay?
- Ya..

1127
01:07:17,387 --> 01:07:18,614
Well, then okay.

1128
01:07:19,512 --> 01:07:21,615
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1129
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:24,657
........today. Okay?
Okay.

1130
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,950
- I will see you right after school.
- Okay. Bye Bye!

1131
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:34,534
Are you fine?
Ya.....

1132
01:07:37,372 --> 01:07:39,905
Amanda, is everything alright?

1133
01:07:40,191 --> 01:07:42,771
I wanna be in your class,
Mr. Cohen.

1134
01:07:43,005 --> 01:07:44,724
You are in my class, Amanda.

1135
01:07:45,003 --> 01:07:47,623
No, she made them
 take me out.

1136
01:07:51,626 --> 01:07:53,159
We’ll see after school
 honey. Okay?

1137
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:54,917
Not fair.

1138
01:07:55,377 --> 01:07:58,523
Is everything okay? I am
Amanda`s  teacher Mr. Cohen

1139
01:07:58,689 --> 01:08:00,043
- We met yesterday.
- I know I know that

1140
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:02,758
There is nothing wrong. I just have
to do what’s right for my daughter.

1141
01:08:03,431 --> 01:08:04,551
Come on Amanda.

1142
01:08:05,983 --> 01:08:07,172
Come on.

1143
01:08:10,238 --> 01:08:13,858
He is concerned about
Amanda`s ability to concentrate.

1144
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,775
You just thought that you would make
a little hard effort.

1145
01:08:16,955 --> 01:08:18,768
Can you just give me a chance?

1146
01:08:18,942 --> 01:08:20,267
We’ve only just started.

1147
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:21,991
-I pointed that out.
- And..?

1148
01:08:22,038 --> 01:08:25,432
He said he is sympathetic but
 that...Amanda needs..

1149
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:28,620
....yes he put it,
a normal teacher.

1150
01:08:29,753 --> 01:08:32,144
Don’t take it too hard, Brad.

1151
01:08:32,277 --> 01:08:34,857
Parents are the hardest
part of the job.

1152
01:08:35,485 --> 01:08:37,598
Alright, who can tell me
the names of the capital

1153
01:08:37,658 --> 01:08:39,932
Maxine in her big red truck
 that can pass through?

1154
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:40,922
Anybody?

1155
01:08:41,558 --> 01:08:42,638
Only hands!

1156
01:08:43,431 --> 01:08:45,171
Excuse me....Excuse me....

1157
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:47,266
Aaa..What shall I choose?

1158
01:08:50,118 --> 01:08:52,017
I don’t know ........

1159
01:08:52,564 --> 01:08:53,644
Heather.

1160
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:57,739
Atlanta, Nashville ...
Hmm..Springfield??

1161
01:08:57,791 --> 01:09:00,333
That’s` great because lot
of people think it’s is Chicago

1162
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,407
.. and this is Springfield. Right?

1163
01:09:03,554 --> 01:09:04,808
No........!

1164
01:09:04,869 --> 01:09:06,613
That is Indianapolis.

1165
01:09:06,685 --> 01:09:10,976
Oh! That’s right. I was
thinking this is Springfield.

1166
01:09:11,051 --> 01:09:12,999
No........!

1167
01:09:13,018 --> 01:09:15,901
That’s Columbus, Springfield is
over there Mr. Cohen.

1168
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:17,739
Where is it? Eli over here?

1169
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:19,009
No.......

1170
01:09:19,042 --> 01:09:20,647
Where is Springfield?

1171
01:09:20,893 --> 01:09:22,886
I don’t know. You guys get
to point it out for me.

1172
01:09:22,974 --> 01:09:24,867
Point it out.....Point it out....

1173
01:09:25,007 --> 01:09:27,214
I..I don’t feel it’s there.

1174
01:09:30,988 --> 01:09:33,092
Aah... I see it.

1175
01:09:33,758 --> 01:09:36,392
You tell me this is
 Springfield. Right?

1176
01:09:36,576 --> 01:09:38,443
Yes..........

1177
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,439
You do not have permission
to leave. Sit Thomas.

1178
01:09:41,973 --> 01:09:45,518
That’s right Mr. Cohen has eyes in the back
with head. Go back and sit down please.

1179
01:09:45,952 --> 01:09:47,025
And next time ask.

1180
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:49,409
I need sharpen my pencil.

1181
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:51,301
Now Thomas......

1182
01:09:55,205 --> 01:10:00,043
Alright now where is Maxine in her
Big Red truck gonna be on Tuesday?

1183
01:10:00,841 --> 01:10:03,481
See you quite early tomorrow, David.

1184
01:10:04,067 --> 01:10:04,727
Alright.

1185
01:10:04,841 --> 01:10:06,454
Hey! Remember to walk.

1186
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:09,647
I really like your hat,
 Mr. Cohen.

1187
01:10:09,707 --> 01:10:11,826
Oh! Thank you, Heather.
I like your hair.

1188
01:10:11,946 --> 01:10:13,992
It’s so short because
 of medicines.

1189
01:10:14,413 --> 01:10:15,359
Goodbye.

1190
01:10:16,788 --> 01:10:17,881
Hi, Honey!

1191
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:19,750
Hi, Mom!

1192
01:10:22,111 --> 01:10:23,887
Can you wait right here
for just a minute?

1193
01:10:23,988 --> 01:10:25,274
- Sure.
- Okay.

1194
01:10:27,084 --> 01:10:29,855
- Hey! I’m..There is
something I want to tell you..

1195
01:10:29,929 --> 01:10:31,976
- I think I know.
- Yea.

1196
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:35,103
We were reluctant
to tell you first.

1197
01:10:35,325 --> 01:10:38,594
Of course it was only a matter time
before chemo came up. So......

1198
01:10:41,032 --> 01:10:42,886
Is that...she gonna be okay?

1199
01:10:45,018 --> 01:10:47,414
Um.. Heather just
loves your class.

1200
01:10:47,755 --> 01:10:50,321
She cann`t wait to get
to school everyday.

1201
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:55,356
I’d be grateful if you keep her secret
a little longer.

1202
01:10:56,428 --> 01:10:58,761
I just don’t wanna to be...

1203
01:10:59,614 --> 01:11:00,588
Ya....

1204
01:11:01,021 --> 01:11:02,048
Thanks.

1205
01:11:02,695 --> 01:11:04,629
- Bye Barbie girl.

1206
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:06,855

1207
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:13,274
- How about ... ice cream?
- Yea....

1208
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:15,054
Okay.

1209
01:11:17,214 --> 01:11:19,634
Hello! What do you think.

1210
01:11:19,761 --> 01:11:21,174
- I already have that one.
- What?

1211
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:23,112
But looks great.

1212
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:27,298
Hey, What’s wrong?

1213
01:11:27,878 --> 01:11:31,179
Oh!.. Nothing... I’m just
 focusing on school stuff.

1214
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,456
- Will you focus on me for a minute?
- Sorry.

1215
01:11:35,123 --> 01:11:37,297
Hey... Try this one..
that will make feel better.

1216
01:11:38,045 --> 01:11:38,799
- Ya..
- Okay.

1217
01:11:38,979 --> 01:11:40,594
Yes... Yes.

1218
01:11:40,721 --> 01:11:43,055
- Really?
- Oh my goodness this suits you.

1219
01:11:44,025 --> 01:11:45,419
More than you know.

1220
01:11:46,113 --> 01:11:46,853
I have.....

1221
01:11:47,696 --> 01:11:49,176
decided, that time...

1222
01:11:50,901 --> 01:11:52,521
....to go for Master Degree.

1223
01:11:53,095 --> 01:11:54,121
Wow

1224
01:11:55,547 --> 01:11:58,736
Wow! That’s mean...
you’re going away?

1225
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:00,853
No. I

1226
01:12:00,981 --> 01:12:03,982
Anyhow I have to pass the entrance test
to Graduate School first. So......

1227
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:06,484
Oh! Isn’t that like the S. A. T.?

1228
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:10,666
Do you have to take that in a
big room, with a lot of people....

1229
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:13,111
- Yea, they said to have a room for myself.
- Good.

1230
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:16,243
The Tourette does have its privileges.

1231
01:12:18,704 --> 01:12:20,504
Will it bother if I do go away.

1232
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,976
Of  course Are you kidding?

1233
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:25,883
- Come here I wanna show you something.
- Crazy.

1234
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:28,546
Next...

1235
01:12:28,766 --> 01:12:33,421
- Hey! Aaa....... Brad Cohen.
- Brad Cohen?

1236
01:12:34,422 --> 01:12:37,935
Here's Mr. Cohen. Alright
I need you to take his package

1237
01:12:38,035 --> 01:12:40,309
..and I need to go right in there.

1238
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:42,819
I am supposed to have
special accommodations.

1239
01:12:44,338 --> 01:12:48,775
I don’t have any notation of that
tested under the same conditions today.

1240
01:12:49,093 --> 01:12:51,406
Okay, yea, But I called
and they said.......

1241
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:54,842
...they said I could have
 a space my self.

1242
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,586
You know what I need to talk to
 the Minister about that...

1243
01:12:57,661 --> 01:12:59,834
his office is right over there.

1244
01:13:00,503 --> 01:13:02,277
- I cann`t make an exception.
- Okay.

1245
01:13:02,404 --> 01:13:03,735
For what I set off that way?

1246
01:13:03,815 --> 01:13:06,671
They promised, and I have right to
Special Testing in accommodations.

1247
01:13:06,705 --> 01:13:10,505
Listen, I am sorry about your disability
but there isn’t anything that I can do.

1248
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:13,147
 If you wanna take the
 test go in there now.

1249
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:13,825
Look at me.

1250
01:13:13,858 --> 01:13:16,570
How could anybody pass and
concentrate by me in that room.

1251
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:19,596
Listen, I have to start
the exam now.

1252
01:13:22,332 --> 01:13:24,232
Do you need me to
call your doctor?

1253
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:26,663
Is there anyone who
could call for help?

1254
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:29,796
Brad, calm down.
I cannot understand you.

1255
01:13:30,388 --> 01:13:32,388
What they said you
can take alone?

1256
01:13:32,931 --> 01:13:34,544
Okay. Alright, no problem

1257
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,198
- I will be right there.
- Did something happen?

1258
01:13:44,933 --> 01:13:48,249
You can take the test. And you
have a room to yourself.

1259
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,030
What did you say?

1260
01:13:50,372 --> 01:13:51,459
The magic words.

1261
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,044
I get to get work.

1262
01:13:56,052 --> 01:13:57,598
- Hey Dad!
- Yea.

1263
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:59,265
Thanks.

1264
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:01,883
Good luck on the test.

1265
01:14:07,263 --> 01:14:11,320
As it turned out I needed
more than just Dad’s good luck.

1266
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,883
I needed time.

1267
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:16,423
With the clock and
my Tourette ticking away

1268
01:14:16,868 --> 01:14:19,781
I fail to get all the way
 through the test.

1269
01:14:30,536 --> 01:14:33,507
Good job guys. Thomas I am
so proud of you.

1270
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:34,727
Thank you Mr. Cohen.

1271
01:14:34,826 --> 01:14:38,767
- Wow! Look at that turkey Heather.
- Thank you

1272
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:42,069
So... Are you gonna have
big things giving this year

1273
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:45,355
Aha.. Mom says all my
grandparents get to come.

1274
01:14:45,489 --> 01:14:47,068
Well, that sounds special.

1275
01:14:47,296 --> 01:14:51,887
Except when they cry. They try
to hide it but I always see them.

1276
01:14:55,012 --> 01:14:56,878
Can I paint Waffle?

1277
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:59,736
You bear. You can paint Waffle.

1278
01:15:00,383 --> 01:15:02,830
Are you gonna have good times
giving Mr. Cohen?

1279
01:15:03,121 --> 01:15:07,740
Yes, I am. Me and Waffle are going to take
a little trip to see my mom and St. Louis.

1280
01:15:07,992 --> 01:15:10,753
- I know where that is?
- Oh! Yea!

1281
01:15:14,895 --> 01:15:16,952
Well, that is super, Heather.

1282
01:15:17,318 --> 01:15:19,738
That is exactly where it is.
Now do me a favour. Will you?

1283
01:15:19,893 --> 01:15:23,553
And I’m gonna trust you to
take good care of my friend Waffle.

1284
01:15:23,759 --> 01:15:24,739
- Alright?
- Sure.

1285
01:15:24,826 --> 01:15:26,466
And I will be right back.

1286
01:15:27,298 --> 01:15:30,717
Hi Amanda. Shouldn’t you
 be in your class?

1287
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:34,004
Alright. Come on. I walk
 you to your room.

1288
01:15:35,067 --> 01:15:37,495
Why cann`t I be in
your class Mr. Cohen?

1289
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:41,661
Well, your father has to do
was  best for you Amanda.

1290
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:44,810
And you know what
 you’ve got a great teacher.

1291
01:15:44,923 --> 01:15:47,789
Okay see you later
 Mr. Cohen.

1292
01:16:07,524 --> 01:16:09,633
Where did you learn
those words, Thomas?

1293
01:16:12,711 --> 01:16:15,324
You know, you’re not supposed
to leave the class without asking.

1294
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:18,341
Well, clean that up

1295
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:21,469
And then.. you are on
detention.... no recess.

1296
01:16:23,248 --> 01:16:25,122
For you do get an A in spelling.

1297
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:29,649
You cann`t read it, if you don’t
 open it, Thomas

1298
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:31,459
I hate reading.

1299
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:37,375
- So do I.
- You too?

1300
01:16:37,614 --> 01:16:39,507
Yea, reading is hard for me.

1301
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,375
It’s not hard for you.
You are a teacher.

1302
01:16:44,854 --> 01:16:47,061
Do you wanna bet?
Lets play a game.

1303
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:51,777
You be Mr, Cohen, trying to read
and I will be Tourette Syndrome.

1304
01:16:51,886 --> 01:16:52,653
Okay?

1305
01:16:53,407 --> 01:16:54,580
Read this page.

1306
01:16:55,086 --> 01:16:56,979
Once upon a time....

1307
01:16:57,807 --> 01:16:58,813
Keep reading.

1308
01:17:00,963 --> 01:17:05,170
- Upon a time there was a ......pica..
- Difficult little bit?

1309
01:17:05,331 --> 01:17:06,724
Alright keep reading.

1310
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:10,865
- There was a.....
- Hey...... Thomas

1311
01:17:11,229 --> 01:17:13,362
Alright that’s hard. Isn’t it?
That’s hard to concentrate.

1312
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,726
That’s how hard
reading is for me.

1313
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,731
Is not that hard for you? Is it?

1314
01:17:18,072 --> 01:17:23,742
No. It`s easy for me. But how can
 you be a teacher if you hate  books?

1315
01:17:23,975 --> 01:17:25,475
Hate books?

1316
01:17:25,951 --> 01:17:28,571
I don’t hate books. Everything
in the world  is in books.

1317
01:17:28,624 --> 01:17:31,050
I just have to work
extra hard to get it out

1318
01:17:31,776 --> 01:17:34,303
But I am not gonna
give up, buddy. Okay?

1319
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:37,434
And I’m not let you give yourself.
Now keep reading. Right here.

1320
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:45,284
- Once upon a time there was a magi...
- M A G I C I A N

1321
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:48,818
A magician  who knew
a small boy

1322
01:17:48,851 --> 01:17:53,640
A small boy who....
a big sword of a big rock.

1323
01:17:54,772 --> 01:17:57,936
Weird. Why would be
a sword in a rock?

1324
01:17:58,644 --> 01:18:03,806
Well, I don’t know but.. if you keep
reading you might just find out.

1325
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,270
The magician told
the small  boy..

1326
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:10,366
 that who ever could pull this
sword out of the rock...

1327
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,620
...would be the true king.

1328
01:18:14,817 --> 01:18:16,197
Cool!

1329
01:18:20,146 --> 01:18:22,183
Keep going. What happens next?

1330
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:28,852
Love will see you through.

1332
01:18:33,683 --> 01:18:35,246
I've been searching high

1333
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:37,486
I've been searching low

1334
01:18:38,407 --> 01:18:40,420
I've been searching low

1335
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:46,875

And anybody I’ve ever
 loved  in my entire life.

1342
01:19:09,441 --> 01:19:10,781

1344
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:15,866

Oh! you here. Oh ...Hi...

1346
01:19:28,527 --> 01:19:30,688
You're prettier than I thought.

1347
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,038
Brad told me so much
about you Ms. Cohen

1348
01:19:33,138 --> 01:19:35,451
Oh Ellen that’s what more than
 he tells me about you.

1349
01:19:35,485 --> 01:19:37,896
What? I told you about Nancy

1350
01:19:38,029 --> 01:19:39,923
Oh he never tell me the

1351
01:19:40,017 --> 01:19:42,648
- Bo Bo get the bag, honey.
- Yes, Bo Bo get off that.

1352
01:19:42,715 --> 01:19:44,617
So are you  exhausted?

1353
01:19:44,758 --> 01:19:47,989
Not much. because we had
pedicure point in an hour.

1354
01:19:49,422 --> 01:19:52,534
This is Nancy, gorgeous,
how are you about?

1355
01:19:54,533 --> 01:19:57,671
It’s Nancy. It’s one of the person..

1356
01:19:57,832 --> 01:20:01,011
Mom’s gonna little bit overwhelming
making Nancy feel like family.

1357
01:20:01,387 --> 01:20:03,576
Is that possibility of being family?

1358
01:20:04,037 --> 01:20:05,996
I don’t know.. I mean. You know.....

1359
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:09,025
I know but I don’t... I know...I know....

01:20:09,212 --> 01:20:11,132
Oh! I am serious.

1362
01:20:14,786 --> 01:20:16,737
Hey? Back off. Will you?

1363
01:20:19,663 --> 01:20:23,855
He ended up falling that, and hit
his head straight against the fence.

1364
01:20:24,136 --> 01:20:26,162
There was a bruise.

1365
01:20:26,707 --> 01:20:30,683
Will you excuse me. Nancy needs in the
 kitchen and it will take just one second

1366
01:20:31,172 --> 01:20:33,119
- I go to the kitchen.

1367
01:20:35,684 --> 01:20:38,753
Are you rescuing me again?
I don’t need rescuing.

1368
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,194

1369
01:20:41,652 --> 01:20:43,192
Whats` going on?

1370
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,945
How is your pedicure?

1371
01:20:45,945 --> 01:20:48,373
If you’re wondering when
your mom and I talked about

1372
01:20:48,554 --> 01:20:51,122
I talked about you and us.

1373
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,180
Something wrong?

1374
01:20:55,754 --> 01:20:58,834
I am just wondering
if  I told you......

1375
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:04,303
I love you.

1376
01:21:14,839 --> 01:21:16,812
I mean.. it just scares me...

1377
01:21:17,963 --> 01:21:19,762
I never thought about it before...

1378
01:21:20,087 --> 01:21:21,569
...neither they had think about it.

1379
01:21:21,649 --> 01:21:23,109
Look Brad.

1380
01:21:24,476 --> 01:21:27,793
She understands about
your noises she doesn’t care.

1381
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:30,754
You know. You would make
 her happy. She told me that.

1382
01:21:30,881 --> 01:21:33,154
Brad, you make her laugh

1383
01:21:34,833 --> 01:21:37,219
Of  what about one day
when she stops laughing.

1384
01:21:38,795 --> 01:21:40,022
What of one day...

1385
01:21:40,842 --> 01:21:42,242
...she gets fade off...

1386
01:21:43,084 --> 01:21:46,083
.....of living with someone who...

1387
01:21:56,415 --> 01:21:58,130
I don’t wanna hurt her, Mom.

1388
01:21:58,996 --> 01:22:00,798
Maybe you do not
 wanna get hurt.

1389
01:22:06,772 --> 01:22:09,563
The only thing that can
hurt either of you.

1390
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:12,263
As if you that Tourette
 drive her away from you.

1391
01:22:12,467 --> 01:22:14,140
If you let him win.

1392
01:22:23,376 --> 01:22:24,963
Heather’s mother had called to say

1393
01:22:24,979 --> 01:22:27,859
Heather was no longer
able to attend school.

1394
01:22:28,092 --> 01:22:30,226
So the class all pitched
 in cheer her up.

1395
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,653
Oh wow look at this table.

1396
01:22:33,235 --> 01:22:34,608
Looks very good.

1397
01:22:35,396 --> 01:22:37,436
How they looks great over here.

1398
01:22:50,831 --> 01:22:53,498
The news we all had been
..came  few weeks later

1399
01:23:01,455 --> 01:23:03,842
- Hey? whats up Henry?
- Hi Mr. Cohen.

1400
01:23:04,611 --> 01:23:05,498
Hi.

1401
01:23:06,645 --> 01:23:07,905
- Hey!
Hello Mr. Cohen.

1402
01:23:08,514 --> 01:23:10,060
- Hey Mr. Cohen.
- What’s up Kevin.

1403
01:23:10,217 --> 01:23:12,737
These are my grandparents,
Jane and Charley.

1404
01:23:22,959 --> 01:23:25,399
Sir, they about to
start the sermons.

1405
01:23:25,593 --> 01:23:27,206
You go ahead.

1406
01:23:35,054 --> 01:23:36,327
Mr. Cohen.

1407
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:38,940
why aren’t you coming in?

1408
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,047
I am sorry.

1409
01:23:41,377 --> 01:23:43,110
I thought I could but I...

1410
01:23:43,558 --> 01:23:45,804
I think I will be too disrupted

1411
01:23:47,248 --> 01:23:49,515
You made such a huge
difference in Heather’s life.

1412
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:51,992
You were her favorite teacher.

1413
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,820
Please don’t leave
without... about her.

1414
01:25:01,464 --> 01:25:04,183
Okay, Thomas,  what is
 your team’s word?

1415
01:25:04,418 --> 01:25:05,324
Weird.

1416
01:25:05,538 --> 01:25:06,531
Weird?

1417
01:25:06,704 --> 01:25:09,736
Anybody not in Thomas’s team
know what that word mean?

1418
01:25:10,036 --> 01:25:13,330
Strange. Creepy. Scary

1419
01:25:14,173 --> 01:25:15,391
Very good.

1420
01:25:16,197 --> 01:25:18,053
Who can use the word
 'Weird' in a sentence?

1421
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:24,216
-  Me...Me...Me.....
- 25, 30, 35, 40 ... takes it 50, Galen!

1422
01:25:25,011 --> 01:25:26,642
I like weird movies.

1423
01:25:26,776 --> 01:25:31,178
Sorry Mr. Cohen. I know you can not
 go to the movies because it could
take from there.

1424
01:25:31,344 --> 01:25:32,584
Well that’s ok Galen.

1425
01:25:33,143 --> 01:25:36,924
Boom! Because I can rent movies,
and I also like weird movies.

1426
01:25:37,624 --> 01:25:39,642
So weird is a good word. Right?

1427
01:25:39,963 --> 01:25:42,660
But what if someone
comes up to you and says

1428
01:25:42,947 --> 01:25:46,572
"Hey! you.Yea I’m talking
to you, you weird"

1429
01:25:47,228 --> 01:25:50,507
- Is it still a good word?
- No.....

1430
01:25:52,611 --> 01:25:55,284
What's that? Hey come on.

1431
01:25:56,175 --> 01:25:57,689
Okay everyone
stay in your seat.

1432
01:26:00,043 --> 01:26:01,889
It’s Maxine in Big Red.

1433
01:26:02,183 --> 01:26:04,083
Mr. Cohen, can we go to see.

1434
01:26:05,741 --> 01:26:07,374
Okay. But everyone inside voices

1435
01:26:07,427 --> 01:26:09,861
Everyone line about
the door and no running.

1436
01:26:33,817 --> 01:26:37,055
You got it. Yea exactly.

1437
01:26:37,655 --> 01:26:40,202
Eli, get in there.
Alright be careful.

1438
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:48,754
What do you think about

1439
01:26:49,007 --> 01:26:53,131
 Eli,  what I tell you?
Alright,  No blowing horn.

1440
01:26:53,221 --> 01:26:54,864
Or everyone will have to get down.

1441
01:26:55,111 --> 01:26:56,597
Sorry Maxine.

1442
01:26:56,876 --> 01:26:59,575
That’s alright.
Kids will be kids.

1443
01:26:59,675 --> 01:27:03,048
Yes. Yea..Yea they are well.

1444
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:20,373
I like Nancy.

1445
01:27:20,899 --> 01:27:22,846
She reminds me your mom

1446
01:27:23,512 --> 01:27:24,866
I don’t look anything alike.

1447
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,393
I don’t talk about look.
I’m talking about that.....

1448
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:31,865
...spark, you know,
spirit that..a genius require.

1449
01:27:33,576 --> 01:27:35,003
How is your school?

1450
01:27:35,327 --> 01:27:39,058
You know, you get more books
 than book cases, roof leaks

1451
01:27:45,278 --> 01:27:47,611
There are many teachers with
 lot more experience for me.

1452
01:27:48,993 --> 01:27:50,587
I am prouding you regardless.

1453
01:27:52,218 --> 01:27:53,585
Doesn’t feel that way.

1454
01:27:54,757 --> 01:27:56,847
Why do I feel that you feel
embarrass about me.

1455
01:27:57,954 --> 01:27:59,394
And it’s okay that you admit it.

1456
01:27:59,521 --> 01:28:01,314
- Are you trying to start a discussion?
- No...No.No..

1457
01:28:01,577 --> 01:28:04,789
But you know we `er talking...
And its good lets talk.

1458
01:28:06,154 --> 01:28:08,173
I have always been
embarrassment to you.

1459
01:28:09,342 --> 01:28:13,607
Even when you used to come visit me
you used to scold among others and used
to quick my way.

1460
01:28:14,818 --> 01:28:16,593
You have never been
able to accept it.

1461
01:28:24,475 --> 01:28:25,798
You `re right.

1462
01:28:26,872 --> 01:28:29,138
It is tough to be
with you sometimes.

1463
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,887
I hated when we go to restaurant
and people give you looks

1464
01:28:33,128 --> 01:28:35,083
Sometimes I wanna just.....

1465
01:28:40,201 --> 01:28:42,331
...I just feel so helpless.

1466
01:28:43,295 --> 01:28:45,745
You know I always tried
 to fix things.

1467
01:28:46,292 --> 01:28:48,945
But the one thing I could never fix.
that one thing is hurting you more.

1468
01:28:49,005 --> 01:28:50,615
It doesn’t leave fixing.

1469
01:28:50,988 --> 01:28:52,521
Nobody can fix it.

1470
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,475
I know.....I know..

1471
01:28:59,065 --> 01:29:02,205
But...... may be......

1472
01:29:02,886 --> 01:29:04,329
...it’s my fault.

1473
01:29:06,052 --> 01:29:07,900
May be I gave it to you.

1474
01:29:21,185 --> 01:29:25,053
Come on guys, we only got 2
minutes  closing, hurry up back there.

1475
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,574
Stand to the side,
 Stand to the side. what I tell you ?

1476
01:29:27,763 --> 01:29:29,782
Guys in the back,
come on hurry up.

1477
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:37,046
Dad, what are you doing here?

1478
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,193
Son you needed book shelves.
Didn’t you?

1479
01:29:39,726 --> 01:29:43,004
Your father had built this new
 book shelves for the library.

1480
01:29:43,303 --> 01:29:45,123
Things are slow at the office.

1481
01:29:47,351 --> 01:29:48,984
This way gentlemen.

1482
01:29:50,029 --> 01:29:52,225
Oh! I got you some
 for your collection.

1483
01:29:57,675 --> 01:29:59,315
Put it on Mr. Cohen.

1484
01:30:06,486 --> 01:30:09,846
A hard hat for an
extremely hard Head

1485
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:13,177
Hey class that’s my Dad.

1486
01:30:13,465 --> 01:30:16,507
- Hi Mr, Cohen.
- Hi.

1487
01:30:19,413 --> 01:30:20,803
Come on.

1488
01:30:22,658 --> 01:30:24,012
Come on.

1489
01:30:25,485 --> 01:30:27,409
Hillary didn’t say
what this was about.

1490
01:30:27,549 --> 01:30:28,803
No idea.

1491
01:30:29,089 --> 01:30:31,975
We were in recess and she said she
needs see you in the classroom.

1492
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:34,566
I think that might be
about next year.

1493
01:30:38,658 --> 01:30:40,004
Here it is

1494
01:30:40,164 --> 01:30:43,638
Brad, will you come over here
 a minute please.

1495
01:30:44,698 --> 01:30:47,138
Hillary has got an
announcement to make.

1496
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:52,900
Some of you may have noticed an observer
hanging around school for last few weeks.

1497
01:30:53,233 --> 01:30:57,210
Well, he was here to assess
one of our teachers

1498
01:30:57,323 --> 01:30:58,451
Mr. Cohen.

1499
01:31:00,153 --> 01:31:05,407
And I am here to announce
that our own Brad Cohen

1500
01:31:05,646 --> 01:31:11,218
..has been chosen for amongst all the new
educators in The State of Georgia.....

1501
01:31:11,347 --> 01:31:15,942
..to be Sallie Mae`s first year
Teacher of the Year.

1502
01:31:22,353 --> 01:31:25,644
As I looked at my students
 I felt like a kid inside

1503
01:31:25,805 --> 01:31:29,803
Because children look at life
 differently than most adults.

1504
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:34,652
They see the world
and say I will. Not I cann`t.

1505
01:31:35,012 --> 01:31:36,545
And so did I.

1506
01:31:44,762 --> 01:31:46,688
This shirt is too tight that label
appearing on my necks.

1507
01:31:46,749 --> 01:31:48,089
I can make up the label

1508
01:31:48,495 --> 01:31:50,494
I don’t understand why you’re
so nervous about.

1509
01:31:50,693 --> 01:31:52,100
You face crowd everyday.

1510
01:31:52,227 --> 01:31:54,687
Well, these aren’t 2nd graders,
you know.

1511
01:31:55,706 --> 01:31:57,760
Oh! man I wish I was invisible.

1512
01:31:57,949 --> 01:32:00,939
That's something that
you never have to worry.

1513
01:32:01,093 --> 01:32:02,513
Be still....Be still.....

1514
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:06,557
I love you.

1515
01:32:40,746 --> 01:32:43,040
Come on Bo Bo you
 can get through this.

1516
01:32:43,354 --> 01:32:45,107
Don’t worry, he’s gonna
get through it.

1517
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:51,533
The noise you just heard is
Tourette Syndrome.

1518
01:32:51,785 --> 01:32:54,019
I have been living with
 since six years old.

1519
01:32:57,525 --> 01:32:59,077
I’m standing up here today..

1520
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:02,230
.. because the love and support of
 lot of people put me up here.

1521
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:04,680
My family....

1522
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,993
My school family.....

1523
01:33:08,353 --> 01:33:10,754
My students and all my friends

1524
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:13,421
I owe this toward all of them.

1525
01:33:14,102 --> 01:33:19,577
But I also owe it to the toughest
and most dedicated teacher I ever had...

1526
01:33:19,955 --> 01:33:22,709
My constant companion
my Tourette.

1527
01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:30,445
Now some of you may think
that’s pretty weird to thank Disability

1528
01:33:31,288 --> 01:33:34,173
..and calling it a Great Teacher
that’s really weird.

1529
01:33:34,498 --> 01:33:37,217
What can I possibly learn
 from Disability?

1530
01:33:46,918 --> 01:33:48,151
Yes Galen.

1531
01:33:48,269 --> 01:33:50,036
You learned to keep going.

1532
01:33:55,804 --> 01:33:59,644
- Eli?
- You learned not to leave that stops you

1533
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:05,589
Yes Thomas.

1534
01:34:05,676 --> 01:34:07,676
You learned not to let it win.

1535
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:11,217
That’s right.

1536
01:34:14,043 --> 01:34:16,798
Coping with my Tourette taught
me  the most valuable lesson..

1537
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:20,469
...that anyone could ever
 learn and that is.

1538
01:34:20,649 --> 01:34:23,816
..To never let anything stop
you from chasing your dream.

1539
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:26,650
From working.

1540
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:29,157
While playing

1541
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,277
While falling in love.

1542
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:35,649
That’s right.

1543
01:34:38,627 --> 01:34:42,031
Coping with my Tourette taught
 me the most valuable lesson that..

1544
01:34:43,018 --> 01:34:44,224
Yes, Thomas.

1545
01:34:44,556 --> 01:34:47,782
Can you bring the award
to show on Monday.

1546
01:34:56,570 --> 01:34:57,470
Sure.
