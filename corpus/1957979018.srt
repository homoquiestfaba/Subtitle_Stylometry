(Clattering) (Gentle, ominous music)

188
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,083
This is the police, open the door!

189
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,625
(Child giggles)

190
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,583
This is your last chance!

191
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,875
Open the door, come out with your hands up!

192
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,750

196
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:52,875
This is crazy.

197
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:59,125
Where did they go,
something was walking in here.

198
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,375
Yeah, something's not right here.

199
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,625
God, I don't know.

200
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,625
Someone was in here, man, I seen that.

201
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,625
You see that.

202
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,333
Why are the cabinets open?

203
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,375
That was weird.

204
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,500
I seen someone here.

205
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,708
There was somebody here.

206
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:19,708
You seen that movie, right?

207
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:20,875
I did.

208
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,500
Look.

209
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:25,416
Look.

(Dramatic, jarring music) (Light buzzing)

211
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,541
Let me see your hands!

212
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:36,833
Put your hands up!

213
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,708
Let me see your hands

I'm gonna shoot you, man,

217
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,792
this is your last chance
for this to be peaceful.

218
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:53,958
Put your hands up!

219
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,833
She doesn't have any legs.

220
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,167
(Gasps) She doesn't have any legs.

221
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,833
Put your hands up, now!

222
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:04,916
(Dramatic, jarring music)
(Disembodied whispers)

223
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,042
Ladies first.

224
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,375
Oh, you suck.

225
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,416
(Pattering footsteps)

226
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,041
Is she there or what?

227
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:38,750
(Pattering footsteps)

228
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,458
[Officer] There's nothing here.

229
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,708
It's a dead end!

230
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,167
What do you mean it's a dead end?

231
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,833
It's a dead end... (screams)

232
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,958

(Disembodied muttering)
(Dramatic, menacing music)

235
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,292

(Dramatic, jarring music)
(Officer hyperventilating)

238
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,833
You're all right, you're all right.

239
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:19,750
You okay?

240
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:22,708
(Officer gasping) Are you okay?

241
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:26,500
What the hell, what was
that? (Labored breathing)

242
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,000
Right here, you want some water?

243
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,667
What was that?

244
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,333
I don't know, that wasn't human.

245
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,583
(Officer breathing heavy)

246
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:37,375
I think we should get out of here now.

247
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,083
It's gonna be back, she's not safe.

248
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:43,167
Yeah, what was all that Jesus talk?

249
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,416
My dad, he was a pastor.

250
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:48,792
I think we should get
out of here right now, okay?

251
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,125
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here.

252
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:50,958
- Come on.
- Yeah.

253
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:53,417
Come on, give me your hand, let's go.

254
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,250
Let's go, partner.

255
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,791
Let's go, partner, come on.

256

[Connie] Amber, Amber wait up.

266
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,042
Hey Connie.

267
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,125
Hey, I was hoping I
could borrow your notes

268
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,375
for Thursday's economics class.

269
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:28,500
I was out and I wanna make sure

270
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,083
I'm ready for next week's test.

271
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,000
Don't want to incur the
wrath of professor Stine.

272
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:32,833
No, you don't. (Laughs)

273
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,917
I don't think I can hear his (mutters)

274
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,958
His favorite phrase...

275
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,375
[together] By failing to prepare,

276
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,458
you're preparing to fail. (Laughing)

277
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:41,958
Yeah, and I actually
have them here in this folder.

278
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,667
Hey, a few of us are
gonna hang out tonight,

279
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,958
pizza and a movie, wanna come?

280
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,708
Oh that sounds great, but I
actually have to work tonight.

281
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,125
Oh bummer.

282
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,125
Yeah, I'm babysitting
for professor Torres.

283
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:52,250
No way, really?

284
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,083
Yeah,

285
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,667
I've been babysitting her
kiddos a few times a month.

286
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,542
Since when?

287
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:57,625
Uh, since freshman year.

288
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,500
Oh, I wouldn't do that
whole babysitting thing.

289
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:01,250
Really, it's not so bad.

290
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,333
I was always stuck
babysitting my younger siblings

291
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,875
so I realized early on, I
don't like kids very much.

292
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:08,417
(Laughs) Well, professor
Torres' kids are really sweet.

293
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,708
They're no trouble at all.

294
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:12,125
Plus, once they go off
to bed, I'm able to study.

295
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,125
So it's a win win.

296
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,083
Oh, here they are.

297
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:17,708
Great, thanks.

298
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:18,792
I'll walk you to your car.

299
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:20,208
Sure, let's go.

300
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:23,708

304
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:01,542
(Pattering footsteps) (Children screaming)

305
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,166
Okay guy, go outside, please.

306
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,542
(Door rattles) (Creaks)

307
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,375
Hi Amber.

308
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:07,292
Hi Mrs. Torres.

309
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,875
As you can see, we're
thrilled that you're here.

310
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,042
You brought board games?

311
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:11,875
I sure did.

312
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,000
Did you bring mouse trap?

313
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,625
Mm, why don't you take a look.

314
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:18,417
Okay guys, go outside
so Amber can come inside.

315
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,667
Mr. Torres is picking me up.

316
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,958
He says he's just a few minutes away.

317
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:24,500
My sister will be here in
the morning to take over

318
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,083
and stay further, through the weekend.

319
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:26,917
Okay.

320
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,625
[Mrs. Torres] I left all
the emergency numbers

321
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:31,583
on the fridge and of course,
you have mine already.

322
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,875
Yeah. (Phone buzzes)

323
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:34,791
Hi honey.

324
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,125
Will you play hide
and seek with us later?

325
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,583
That's why I brought my
flashlight for that very reason.

326
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:45,666
(Mrs. Torres chattering)
(Distant horn honking)

327
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,500
Okay kids, time to say goodbye.

328
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,500
Oh, I'm gonna miss my babies.

329
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,583
Thank you, Amber, talk
with you when we land.

330
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:56,708
[Amber] Bye Mrs. Torres.

331
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:58,167
- Bye!
- Bye.

332
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,958
(Door creaks) (Clatters)

333
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,792
All right, who's ready to have some fun?

334
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:03,625
[Katie] Me!

335
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:04,458
Me too.

336
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:05,875
Let's play some games.

337
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,958
(Crickets chirping)

338
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,500
(Die rattles)

339
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:15,375
One, two, three, four, I win, I win!

340
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,167
I get the last cheese!

341
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,125
♪ Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh ♪ - okay, okay,

342
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,875
we get it, you won.

343
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,083
Well that was fun.

344
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,833
Okay guys, time to go brush your teeth.

345
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:28,708
But we haven't played hide and seek yet.

346
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:29,958
Oh that's right.

347
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,958
We'll play hide and seek
after you go brush your teeth.

348
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,333
Sis, I wanna go and brush my teeth first.

349
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,958
Okay, go brush your teeth.

350
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,875
Don't forget to floss.

351
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,833
Are you okay, Katie?

352
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:47,458
Yeah, I'm just a little sad.

353
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:48,833
What's the matter?

354
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,417
I just miss my mom and dad.

355
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,792
It's okay to miss them,
but you know what?

356
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:54,833
What?

357
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,917
You'll see them again
in a couple of days.

358
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,042
In the meantime, you
get to hang out with me

359
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,292
and tomorrow you get to
hang out with your auntie.

360
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:02,792
Yeah, I guess so.

361
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,625
So try not to think about
the sad part too much.

362
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,458
Just think about all the
fun we've been having.

363
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,750
[Katie] Okay.

364
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,750
Oh, and think of a good hiding place

365
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,625
where Sammy and I
won't be able to find you.

366
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:13,875
Okay.

clean up the mess we made.

There couldn't possibly
be a lady at your window.

00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,750
Yeah, I've been telling you
to get some security cameras

542
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,250
for that place for a while now.

543
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:52,875
You're right, that needs to be done.

544
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:54,292
Maybe we should get some here too.

545
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,500
Yeah, that wouldn't
be a bad idea, actually.

546

♪ Sweet as honey, my... ♪

547
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:02,875
Hey sweetie, how was your night?

548
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:04,458
(Sighs) Exhausting.

549
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,083
I'm just gonna get some sleep.

550
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:08,208
You don't wanna have breakfast first?

551
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,000
No, just sleep.

552

555
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:26,916

00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:40,792
Aaron?

567
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:43,792
Mayra, eh, what are you doing here?

568
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,333
I work here.

569
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:47,125
Well, just for the summer.

570
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,750
Oh yeah of course, it's cool, cool.

571
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:55,250
What about you, what
are you up to this summer?

572
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:59,583
Not much, just doing a
lot of yard work and uh,

573
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:01,167
a lot of reading.

574
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,500
Although I did have a
job interview last week,

575
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,958
so I'm really hoping to hear back.

576
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:06,916
That's great!

577
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:09,958
I hope you get the job.

578
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:10,833
Yeah me too.

579
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:13,833
I would definitely love to
make some money this summer.

580
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:17,125
Trust me, I know what you mean.

581
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:18,291
Yeah, I'm sure.

582
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:27,083
Hey um, maybe we can
hang by the pool this weekend?

583
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:29,167
Yeah, uh yeah, that sounds cool.

584
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,292
Let's do it.

585
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,208
Cool.

586
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:36,292
Anyways, it was good seeing you.

587
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,291
Yeah, you too.

588
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,792
I uh, gotta keep
putting these books back.

589
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,708
Oh yeah, sure, of course.

590
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:47,667
Okay, bye.

591
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,583
Bye.

592
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:55,667
Hey um, I'll call you
about setting up a time?

593
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,625
Yeah yeah, that sounds great.

594
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,375
Cool.

595
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,792
Well, I'm off.

596
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:04,666
(Chuckles) Okay, bye.

597
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:06,791

(Aaron knocks)

624
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:27,667
Hey uh, you got a minute?

625
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,000
Yeah sure, what's up?

626
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:36,625
Hey uh, have you been

627
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:39,000
experiencing anything weird at all lately?

628
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,583
You too?

629
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:42,708
So you've seen her.

630
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:46,041
I thought I was going crazy.

631
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,583
So, what do we do about this thing?

632
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:54,083
I don't know, I was hoping you knew.

633
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:57,417
I've never had to deal
with something like this.

634
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,750
This is ed and Lorraine
Warren kind of stuff.

635
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:01,917
Yeah well they're both dead

636
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,541
so that's not going to help us.

637
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:06,750
Well maybe you can try to make contact

638
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:09,333
with whatever this thing
is, to see what it wants?

639
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:11,083
No.

640
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:13,125
Didn't you learn anything
from the horror movies?

641
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,583
You never try to communicate,

642
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:16,875
it only leads to somebody
getting possessed.

643
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:21,625
But we can't just pretend
like this isn't happening.

644
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:22,708
No, of course not.

645
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,583
Maybe grandma will know what to do?

646
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:29,500
Grandma?

647
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:32,791
Got any better ideas?

648
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:35,208
No, I guess not.

649
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:42,333
(Dramatic, suspenseful
music) (Birds chirping)

650
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:47,417
Thank you so much
for meeting me, grandma.

651
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,625
Aye baby, you know
I'm always here to talk,

652
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:53,542
except Wednesday nights after 6:00.

653
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:55,208
That's bingo night.

654
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,292
(Amber chuckles)

655
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:59,000
How's your mother doing?

656
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:03,250
I haven't seen much of
her, since your father left.

657
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:07,416
You know mom, always working hard.

658
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:11,291
Yeah, that's always been your mother.

659
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:13,958
Ever since I can remember,

660
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:19,417
she was making her own
money, always working,

661
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,916
even when she was in school.

662
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:24,375
You remind me so much of her.

663
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:29,125
Unfortunately, not all men

664
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,791
can handle strong women with Patience.

665
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:34,833
Do you think that's why dad left?

666
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:41,166
Your father has always
been battling his demons.

667
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:47,667
I don't think his leaving had
anything to do with anybody,

668
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,583
but himself.

669
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:52,083
Have you heard from him?

670
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:52,958
No.

671
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,833
So angry at him, I wouldn't
wanna talk to him anyway.

672
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:57,666
It's okay to be angry.

673
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:03,833
Just don't let that lead to
bitterness sentiment, okay?

674
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:08,833
So, about this thing

675
00:56:08,916 --> 00:56:11,291
that you were telling
me about over the phone.

676
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:17,708
(Upbeat, cheery music) (Water swishing)

677
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,416
Man, that was fun.

678
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:29,208
I just need to catch
my breath for a second.

679
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:31,000
Yeah, me too.

680
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,708
Man, I just wish I
could lay out here all day

681
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,791
and not go into work, just work on my tan.

682
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,625
Can't you call it off?

683
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:41,708
No, I really wanna start earning

684
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:43,292
as much money as I can this summer

685
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:46,125
so that maybe I can afford to go abroad

686
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:47,958
during the winter break.

687
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:48,792
Really?

688
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:51,167
Yeah, I mean, I would
just love to see the world,

689
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,875
you know, even if it's
just for a week or two.

690
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:55,458
That sounds exciting,

691
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,500
definitely would put something
like that on my bucket list.

692
00:56:57,583 --> 00:56:58,667
You should.

693
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,500
There's a whole world outside of the valley

694
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,458
that I've never experienced.

695
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:03,750
Yeah, I hear ya.

696
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:05,125
Last year I went to the east coast

697
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,250
and I loved the winter experience there.

698
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:11,250
But my favorite seasonal
experience, Autumn in the midwest.

699
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,250
It's not too cold, it's not too hot,

700
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:16,042
and the leaves turn
into this beautiful color.

701
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:18,417
It's really an amazing sight to see.

702
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,041
It sounds like it.

703
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:23,541
Anyway, back to reality.

704
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:25,458
Yeah.

705
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:27,083
Wanna do a few more laps?

706
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:28,125
Let's do it.

707
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:29,833
All right, sounds good.

708
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:34,916
(Water gurgling) (Upbeat, cheery music)

709
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:43,666
(Birds chirping) (Lemonade burbling)

710
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:49,792
So what do you think
of all the strange things

711
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:51,416
that have been happening to us?

712
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:55,917
I am an old lady and I have seen

713
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
a lot of strange things in my lifetime,

714
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:03,416
especially here, in this region.

715
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:07,875
This,

716
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:09,916
this is a haunted valley.

717
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:15,833
Spirits constantly roam through the roads,

718
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:19,167
the streets, and the alleyways,

719
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,083
looking for a dwelling place.

720
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,708
What do you mean, grandma?

721
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:31,292
The ancient scriptures
tells us to stay alert

722
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:34,125
for our great enemy, the devil.

723
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:39,833
He's prowling around, like a roaring lion,

724
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:42,917
looking for someone to devour.

725
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,750
The devil?

726
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:44,666
And his demons.

727
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:49,083
I just thought the devil
is supposed to be in hell.

728
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,166
Then you'd be wrong.

729
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:57,292
Hell was created for him, sure,

730
00:58:57,375 --> 00:59:01,208
but he and his angels dwell amongst us

731
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:04,833
and they are trying to lure as
many souls to hell with them.

732
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:08,750
Jesus himself dealt with demons

733
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:11,208
all the time in the scriptures.

734
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:14,125
He was even tempted by the devil.

735
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:20,250
Well, we're all seeing
some kind of human-like entity,

736
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:23,416
not some kind of devil or demon.

737
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,458
The devil can take any form he wants.

738
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:30,917
Couldn't it just be the restless spirit

739
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,375
of a woman who passed here in the area?

740
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,750
Baby, our souls are
designed to sleep when we die

741
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,000
until awakened by god himself

742
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:43,625
when the day of judgment arrives.

743
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:46,625
When a demon attaches,

744
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:51,708
that demonic force continues
to impersonate that person

745
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:54,750
long after they've passed.

746
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:57,458
It wanders the streets,

747
00:59:57,541 --> 01:00:01,208
looking for someone
else to attach itself to.

748
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:05,333
How do you know if
you have an attachment?

749
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:08,625
Many people don't realize it.

750
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:11,875
They go through an entire
lifetime without ever knowing.

751
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:17,916
Yet, this entity influences
many choices they make.

752
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:25,500
Does this mean we're gonna
become possessed or something?

753
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:30,583
Attachment sometimes leads
to possession, but not always.

754
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:36,375
If you are seeing a physical
manifestation of the spirit,

755
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:38,458
then it's a good sign because it means

756
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:40,125
it is still prowling around.

757
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:45,666
However, it is also very dangerous

758
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:49,167
because it means it has targeted you,

759
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,166
that it has targeted your family.

760
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:53,833
What?

761
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,375
You must remain vigilant.

762
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:56,833
How?

763
01:00:56,916 --> 01:01:01,916
The enemy tries to find ways
to gain access into your home

764
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:05,125
and ultimately your heart,

765
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:10,167
as it is this way that it
can also draw you away

766
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,041
from the love and protection of god.

767
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,208
See, we are empty vessels.

768
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:21,667
We can choose to fill our heart

769
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:26,750
with bitterness, greed, hate, anger, lust,

770
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:31,916
which are open invitations
to unclean spirits of the world.

771
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:38,458
Or, we can choose to be
filled with the presence of god.

772
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:44,083
The choice is ours to make.

773
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:48,208
Remain vigilant.

774
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:55,875
You know, I don't think

775
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:58,083
I've ever taken this path home before.

776
01:01:58,166 --> 01:02:00,292
Yeah, it's a bit faster.

777
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:03,250
You just have to pass
by the old Miller house.

778
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:04,708
The what?

779
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:06,000
The old Miller house?

780
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:10,542
You've never heard of the old Miller house?

781
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:11,958
(Laughs) No.

782
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:13,917
Well, it's only supposed to be

783
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,167
one of the most haunted
places in the valley.

784
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,000
What?

785
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:19,583
Yeah.

786
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:21,083
Why?

787
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:25,375
Well, I mean, I don't
know if it's true or not,

788
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:28,500
but as the legend has it,

789
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:32,208
Mrs. Miller became very depressed

790
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:34,250
after suffering the loss of a child.

791
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:39,500
Her husband, Mr. Miller,
tried to get her help.

792
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,208
She was inconsolable.

793
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:49,791
(Mrs. Miller crying)
(Dramatic, ominous music)

794
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:04,000
She began to hear voices

795
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:06,375
that were telling her to hurt herself.

796
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:11,458
(Water hissing) (Disembodied whispers)

797
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:43,083
(Water hissing) (Dramatic, ominous music)

798
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:50,208
(Flesh squelching)
(Dramatic, ominous music)

799
01:03:55,625 --> 01:04:00,625
Unfortunately, her husband
wasn't able to help her.

800
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:07,625
She became lost in her loneliness.

801
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:11,125
(Dark, eerie music)

802
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:17,500
After that, Mr. Miller was
never the same again.

803
01:04:17,583 --> 01:04:21,000
People said that he
still talked to his wife.

804
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,541
They even saw her on the property at times.

805
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:30,208
Eventually he moved and no
one's lived there ever again.

806
01:04:30,291 --> 01:04:32,917
(Birds chirping) (Dramatic, ominous music)

807
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,541
Anyway, it's just a ghost legend.

808
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,333
Yeah.

809
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:42,916
(Dramatic, ominous music)

810
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,583
(Cheerful, rhythmic music)

811
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:01,333
(Phone ringing)

812
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,583
What do you want?

813
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:08,500
Bethany.

814
01:05:09,791 --> 01:05:12,833
I really wasn't expecting
for you to pick up.

815
01:05:12,916 --> 01:05:14,583
I was just gonna leave a message.

816
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:18,458
How are you doing?

817
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:21,333
Just get to the point.

818
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:24,042
Uh, I'm not uh,

819
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:27,083
quite sure what the best
way to uh, say this is,

820
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:30,833
so, I'm just gonna go
right ahead and say it.

821
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:35,666
Um, I've met someone, Bethany, and um,

822
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,583
we uh, we'd like to get married.

823
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:47,333
Well I hope she knows
what she's getting into.

824
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:48,250
Yeah.

825
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:52,416
So I'm just gonna go right ahead and uh,

826
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:55,167
send you the uh, divorce papers.

827
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,750
That way we can finalize this thing and uh,

828
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,666
we can both move on with our lives.

829
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,333
Listen, I was hoping you
could do me a favor and uh,

830
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:09,125
share the news with the kids for me?

831
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,583
Let 'em know yourself. (Sighs)

832
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:19,041
(Heavy machinery humming)

833
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:26,166
(Dramatic, foreboding music)

834
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:37,958
(Leaves rustling) (Gentle, cheery music)

835
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,208
So um, do you believe any of that?

836
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:44,125
What, the stories?

837
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,041
Yeah.

838
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:49,083
Sure, I believe miss
Miller killed herself.

839
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:52,666
How about the ghost part?

840
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:58,208
I don't know, I'm sure
there's some truth to the stories.

841
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:02,708
Have you ever experienced
anything paranormal before?

842
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,042
I don't know.

843
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:07,333
I can't say I have.

844
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:08,250
Have you?

845
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:10,875
Uh...

846
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:17,458
oh my goodness, you have, haven't you?

847
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:18,292
I'd rather you not think

848
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:19,792
I'm some kind of nut job or something.

849
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:22,583
No, I think that's so cool.

850
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:23,833
I envy you.

851
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:28,042
Trust me, you do not wanna
experience anything paranormal.

852
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:30,625
Well, maybe just a little.

853
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:34,791
Well, this is where we split up.

854
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:38,958
Yeah, I had a really nice time.

855
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:40,042
Me too.

856
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,750
Um, call me?

857
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,458
Yeah, of course.

858
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:44,375
Cool.

859
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:47,417
I'll see you soon.

860
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,500

- Bye.

So, apparently we live down the street

869
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:53,042
from a haunted house.

870
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:54,625
What, how do you know?

871
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:56,167
My friend Mayra just told me.

872
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:57,958
Apparently some lady
committed suicide there

873
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:00,333
after having suffered from depression.

874
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:01,375
When was this?

875
01:09:01,458 --> 01:09:02,750
I don't know, exactly.

876
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:04,792
It sounds like quite a few years ago.

877
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:06,708
Mayra says people claim to have seen her

878
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:08,625
on the property long after she died.

879
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,333
That's it.

880
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:12,208
What?

881
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:14,333
Grandma was telling me that

882
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:16,667
demonic spirits attach themselves

883
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:18,708
to people when they see an opportunity.

884
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,875
What?

885
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:24,500
She was telling me that what we think are

886
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:28,417
human spirits or ghosts
are actually demonic spirits

887
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,041
impersonating the person
that they were attached to

888
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,292
until they can find someone else

889
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:34,875
they can attach themselves to.

890
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,167
Okay.

891
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,708
Don't you see?

892
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:42,750
This entity is probably the same spirit

893
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:45,542
that attached itself to this poor woman,

894
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:47,166
due to her state of depression.

895
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:49,458
Might have been what led her

896
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,958
to commit suicide in the first place,

897
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:54,750
taking advantage of her poor mental health.

898
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:58,041
Now, it's trying to find
someone else to attach itself to.

899
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,708
What?

900
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:03,333
So the spirit wants to
attach itself to one of us?

901
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:05,291
I think so.

902
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,083
How do we stop it?

903
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,791
I don't know, she didn't say.

904
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,458
What?

905
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:17,042
Okay okay, I probably should've asked.

906
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,292
You think?

907
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:22,125
(Gentle, dramatic music)

908
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:27,208
(Humming traffic) (Gentle, dramatic music)

909
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:47,875
(Curtains rustle)

910
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:54,250
(Water hissing) (Gentle, dramatic music)

911
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:16,833
(Water hissing)

912
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:23,916
(Insects buzzing) (Gentle, dramatic music)

913
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,833
(Door clatters)

914
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:37,916
♪ Baby, why did you leave me ♪

915
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:43,708
♪ why did you leave me, leave me behind ♪

916
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:48,791
♪ I don't know that... ♪

917
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,500
(Gentle, strumming music)

918
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:07,917
Here you go.

919
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,792
Thank you.

920
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:09,750
You're welcome.

921
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:12,208
This is good.

922
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:14,667
- Yeah?
- How's yours?

923
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,375
- It's good.
- Isn't it?

924
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,375
I might have to get
another one before we leave.

925
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:20,042
(Mayra laughs)

926
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:22,167
(People chattering)

927
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,625
So, I'm sorry to hear

928
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,833
things aren't going great with your dad.

929
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:28,792
Yeah, thanks.

930
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,458
I just don't like feeling
anger all the time, you know?

931
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:31,708
It's exhausting.

932
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:32,625
I bet.

933
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,792
I know it's easier said than done,

934
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:38,000
but you just have to forgive your dad

935
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:39,541
for putting you through this.

936
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,541
It's just so hard, you know?

937
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:46,791
Well, look at it this way,

938
01:12:47,916 --> 01:12:51,208
just because you love and forgive someone

939
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,750
doesn't mean you always
have to agree with their choices

940
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,541
or even like them for that matter.

941
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:59,875
You just have to release someone that

942
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,333
you've been holding captive.

943
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:03,458
My dad?

944
01:13:04,541 --> 01:13:06,750
No, you Aaron,

945
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:09,417
you need to release what
you've been holding in.

946
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,458
Be free.

947
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:12,458
What do you mean?

948
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:15,625
Well, while your dad made his choices

949
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:19,875
and they have consequences, so do yours.

950
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:23,041
So, I wouldn't let anger in.

951
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:26,333
Bitterness will just eat you up inside.

952
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:27,583
It'll eat you alive.

953
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:30,417
Maybe you're right.

954
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,541
Of course I am.

955
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,792
Be the Aaron I've come to know.

956
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:35,958
Which Aaron's that?

957
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,833
The nice Aaron.

958
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:39,625
The nice Aaron?

959
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:40,833
Stop.

960
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,041
Can I be bad?

961
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:46,500
Stop.

962
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:52,083
(Crickets chirping)

963
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:03,208
(Distant rustling) (Crickets chirping)

964
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:29,458
(Bedding rustling) (Crickets chirping)

965
01:14:55,583 --> 01:15:00,583
(Blankets rustle) (Quiet, ominous music)

966
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,208
(Door clatters) (Creaks)

967
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:34,291
(Dark, eerie music) (Blankets rustle)

968
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:49,208
(Door creaks) (Clatters)

969
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:52,791
(Dark, suspenseful music)

970
01:15:59,041 --> 01:16:01,083
(Wings flutter)

971
01:16:01,166 --> 01:16:03,583
I'm very worried about
you and the children.

972
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:06,583
Yes mom, I know.

973
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,667
We're just trying to figure out

974
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,291
why this thing is following us.

975
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:14,291
You cannot deal with this alone.

976
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,625
(Distant phone rings)

977
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:19,667
Listen mom, I'm gonna have to let you go.

978
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,125
I've gotta get back to work.

979
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,500
Yeah, I know.

980
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:25,541
I love you too.

981
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:33,708
(Birds chirping) (Quiet music)

982
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:38,791
Lord, please help my
daughter and my grandchildren.

983
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:44,416
Illuminate their paths
and deliver them from evil.

984
01:16:47,458 --> 01:16:50,791
Let your spirit fill them
with wisdom and power.

985
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,833
Free them from oppression.

986
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,208
In the name of your son, I pray.

987
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:07,000
(Mutters) Prays for church, huh?

988
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:07,916
Come on.

989
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,083
[Speaker] I haven't
seen you in church lately.

990
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:16,166
(Laughs) Well, not much
sense in my going to church.

991
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:18,583
Do you remember one
time when we were small,

992
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:22,083
and we were out here, it
was from right over there,

993
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:24,208
I jumped out at you from behind the tree.

994
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:26,583
Greg walked out, got all
excited, he shook his fist at me,

995
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:29,000
and he said, "boy,
you're (Mutters) For help."

996
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:32,667
(Chuckles) Remember that, right over there?

997
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,708
We used to really be scared.

998
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:37,333
[Speaker] Johnny.

999
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:39,042
[Johnny] You're still afraid.

1000
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:40,167
[Speaker] Stop it now, I mean it!

1001
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:43,083
Oh mom, I didn't hear you come in.

1002
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,291
Must have dosed off while watching the TV.

1003
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,208
Is Amber back as well?

1004
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,166
She mentioned going out with some friends.

1005
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:56,250
[Speaker] Stop it,
you're acting like a child!

1006
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:59,000
(Phone ringing)

1007
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:09,416
(Deep, ominous music) (Phone ringing)

1008
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:15,042
Hello?

1009
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:17,375
I should be home in
about 20 minutes or so.

1010
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:21,333
Is your sister home from the Torres' yet?

1011
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:22,917
Mom?

1012
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,958
I'm headed home now.

1013
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:26,667
Shouldn't be long.

1014
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:30,000
(Dark, menacing music)

1015
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:55,958
Aaron.

1016
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:58,208
Aaron?

1017
01:18:58,291 --> 01:19:01,541
(Dark, menacing music)

1018
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:05,500
(Bethany gasps) (Dramatic, jarring music)

1019
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:10,583
(Dark, menacing music) (Ghost crackling)

1020
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:23,042
You leave us alone! (Door clatters)

1021
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:25,833
Leave my family alone!

1022
01:19:25,916 --> 01:19:27,375
Stop following us.

1023
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:29,875
You can't have us.

1024
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,125
You can't have my children!

1025
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:36,458
(Dark, menacing music)

1026
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:46,500
(Door clatters)

1027
01:19:47,875 --> 01:19:50,375
(Engine hums)

1028
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:56,667
That thing, grandma,
it's taunting us all the time,

1029
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,166
and I'm sick of being scared.

1030
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:01,083
I know this is difficult,

1031
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,875
but there is only one way to be set free

1032
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:09,291
from the grips of demonic oppression.

1033
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:13,958
Christ told his disciples

1034
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:17,542
that sometimes malignant spirits

1035
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:20,500
can be fought with prayer and fasting.

1036
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:26,416
So I have been praying and
fasting for you and your family.

1037
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:31,333
Now is the time for us to fight.

1038
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:37,750
(Engine humming) (Quiet, eerie music)

1039
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,541
(Keys clink)

1040
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:13,583
(Door clatters) (Quiet, eerie music)

1041
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:23,041
(Rustling grass) (Quiet, eerie music)

1042
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:23,333
(Quiet, shuffling footsteps)
(Quiet, eerie music)

1043
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:50,208
What are you doing?

1044
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:52,541
I'm anointing this house.

1045
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:54,833
What's that?

1046
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:58,250
It's an old biblical practice

1047
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:02,500
used to consecrate
something or someone to Christ.

1048
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:04,666
Consecrate?

1049
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,750
To set apart.

1050
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:13,125
It's not some kind of mystical
thing that I'm doing here.

1051
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:17,291
(Quiet, eerie music)

1052
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,750
Lord, I anoint this house

1053
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:28,250
so that no ungodly spirit may enter.

1054
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:31,167
(Disembodied whispering)
(Quiet, eerie music)

1055
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:34,083
That your angels stand guard

1056
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:38,833
on each side of the
property and all of its corners.

1057
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:42,667
(Disembodied whispering)
(Quiet, eerie music)

1058
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,666
In the name of your son, I pray.

1059
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:50,750
(Disembodied whispering)
(Quiet, eerie music)

1060
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:53,333
Now it's time to anoint you.

1061
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:56,333
What?

1062
01:23:56,416 --> 01:24:01,250
Lord, I anoint Aaron as a vessel

1063
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,792
to be used solely for you.

1064
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:08,000
Protect him from the evil
one and all his demons.

1065
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:13,792
Fill him with your love and compassion,

1066
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:17,750
your kindness, your mercy, your grace.

1067
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:21,083
Peace and forgiveness.

1068
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:25,541
Now, repeat after me.

1069
01:24:26,666 --> 01:24:29,875
I renounce evil. (Lights buzz)

1070
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:31,208
I renounce evil.

1071
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:34,167
I renounce hate. (Dark, ominous music)

1072
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,333
I renounce hate.

1073
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:38,083
I renounce bitterness. (Lights buzzing)

1074
01:24:38,166 --> 01:24:39,917
I renounce bitterness.

1075
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,125
I renounce sin. (Dark, ominous music)

1076
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,583
I renounce sin.

1077
01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:48,583
I renounce the devil. (Lights buzzing)

1078
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,167
I renounce the devil.

1079
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:53,750
(Dramatic, jarring music)

1080
01:24:55,250 --> 01:25:00,250
(Disembodied whispers)
(Dark, menacing music)

1081
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:16,833
(Door slams) (Dark, menacing music)

1082
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:24,041
(Baby crying) (Dark, menacing music)

1083
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:29,291
(Debris clattering) (Baby crying)

1084
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:34,667
[Disembodied voice] Please help me.

1085
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,500
Please help me, help.

1086
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:42,541
(Baby crying) (Dark, menacing music)

1087
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:46,958
(Dark, menacing music)

1088
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:56,291
(Door clatters) (Engine hums)

1089
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,208
Are you all right?

1090
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:06,375
Yeah, I think so.

1091
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:07,917
That is good, (speaks Spanish)

1092
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,250
(Knocking at the door)

1093
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:12,667
(Dark, menacing music)

1094
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,000
(Door clatters)

1095
01:26:14,083 --> 01:26:14,916
Bethany.

1096
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:19,958
- Mom.
- Come in, (speaks Spanish)

1097
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:21,167
Come in.

1098
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:24,666
(Dark, foreboding music)

1099
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:30,750
You know what, mom, I
think I'm just gonna head home.

1100
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:32,542
I've had a rough day.

1101
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:34,375
Nonsense, I'll make you some tea.

1102
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:38,083
No mom, I'm just gonna head home.

1103
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:40,208
I just came to pick up Aaron.

1104
01:26:40,291 --> 01:26:41,611
How'd you know I was here, mom?

1105
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:45,250
Hey uh, GPS tracking app on your phone.

1106
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:46,375
Let's go.

1107
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:47,875
(Fly buzzing)

1108
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:51,417
Come on, you're letting
the flies in, come on.

1109
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,083
The flies are coming in.

1110
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:55,750
(Bethany sighs) (Dark, foreboding music)

1111
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:56,666
Come on.

1112
01:26:58,541 --> 01:26:59,792
You okay, mom?

1113
01:26:59,875 --> 01:27:02,375
Yeah, I'm all right, I just,

1114
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:03,417
I don't know what came over me,

1115
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,333
I started feeling so strange.

1116
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:08,375
(Door clatters)

1117
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:10,667
Come on, mom, take a
seat, you don't look so good.

1118
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:11,958
[Grandmother] Yeah, he's right.

1119
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:14,417
I don't know what's
happening to me, I just,

1120
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,833
oh, I feel faint.

1121
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,041
I'll get you some water.

1122
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:22,125
I think, I think that entity
is trying to take over you.

1123
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:25,583
What?

1124
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:28,542
I saw it again, mom,

1125
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,625
but this time it took your appearance.

1126
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:33,708
Wait, wait what?

1127
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,708
I thought it was you, it was in the house

1128
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:39,416
and I thought it was you.

1129
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:43,125
You know what?

1130
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:46,458
I saw it too, on my way over here.

1131
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:49,208
What?

1132
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:53,167
I have never felt so afraid in my life.

1133
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:54,083
I just...

1134
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,208
[grandmother] Here you go, sweetie.

1135
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:58,917
Thank you, mom.

1136
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,708
Grandma, bring the oil.

1137
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:02,500
What?

1138
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:06,542
I think what she's
experiencing is a spiritual attack.

1139
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:08,167
(Dark, foreboding music)

1140
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:09,083
Oh.

1141
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:14,542
Wait, oil, what oil?

1142
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:15,708
You'll see.

1143
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:19,208
(Dark, foreboding music)

1144
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:25,583
That spirit cannot get a hold of you

1145
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:29,458
if you surrender yourself to god.

1146
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:32,708
You must lay your sorrows by his feet.

1147
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:36,417
(Bethany growling)

1148
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:39,958
Look to god, let go of that resentment...

1149
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:42,625
- die, die!
- You've been holding on to.

1150
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:44,583
Don't let it eat you... (Bethany screams)

1151
01:28:44,666 --> 01:28:46,417
Don't let it consume you.

1152
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:50,333
(Engine humming) (Quiet, menacing music)

1153
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:53,083
(Door clatters)

1154
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:57,583
(Bethany growling)

1155
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,208
Let go of... (Bethany growling)

1156
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:03,833
Let go of that resentment
that you've been holding on to.

1157
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:05,917
Don't let it eat you alive.

1158
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,625
Don't let it consume you... no!

1159
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:12,625
(Grandmother continues) (Bethany growling)

1160
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:13,708
It cannot get a hold of you

1161
01:29:13,791 --> 01:29:16,917
if you surrender yourself to god.

1162
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,792
Lay your sorrows at his
feet, (speaks Spanish)

1163
01:29:21,875 --> 01:29:23,791
That spirit of sadness.

1164
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:28,458

choice to forgive and move on.

1168
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:03,417
He who forgives is much forgiven.

1169

joy, kill your hopes,

1177
