 Yes, eva jones' mother-in-law.

20
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:26,461
       It's been well over
        12 hours now. No.

    [nancy] we haven't heard
            a thing.

     Yes, I suppose this is
    out of character for eva.

   The police are out looking.

        What do you mean?

29
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,082
   From the moment eva called
     to tell me he was gone,

Doesn't drop dead for no reason.

33
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,665
     -He had a heart attack.
-And now your mother disappears.

      for a second autopsy.

     to be working outside?

    -No way, it's refreshing.
              -Ah.

  I'm all caught up on emails.

          from 9 moon?

57
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,125

  like, 20 times the last hour.

 I, uh, I thought you'd given up
          on this one.

61
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:04,528
 No, I, I just figured I owed it
to ryan to get it running again.

62
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:06,621
       If it bothers you,
   I can put it in the garage.

         No, no, it's...

64

  I know how much ryan enjoyed
     rebuilding it with you.

  -Everything okay over there?

68

 Yeah, it's just this guy clint.
     Just can't take a hint.

00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,157
     Uh, first guy I go out
         on a date with,

70
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:28,994
    And it turns out this guy
     is a, uh, total creep.

71
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:30,720
     Yeah, wasn't that date,
        like, weeks ago?

    -He's still calling you?
             -Yeah.

73
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:34,333
       And the worst part
         is that I left

74
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,001
       My favorite earring
     in the back of his car.

75
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:38,653
  Well, you know, if you want,
     I could, uh, make sure

76
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:41,656
      He leaves you alone.
        You know, well...

77
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,567
            Oh, yeah,
   I can be very intimidating.

        -Oh, yeah. Yeah.

79
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:49,997
   Wow, I got this. Actually,
I'm gonna just block his number.

80
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,591
        -So... Thank you.
         - Yeah. Smart.

     After the year you had,
    you can't be too careful.

      Now that your divorce
          is finalized,

84

    Are you gonna finally ask
  my friend ashley out or what?

            -Come on!

86
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:04,196
       What would she want
       with a guy like me?

87
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:06,180
You gotta give yourself a little
          more credit.

-[chuckles] come on, I'm a mess.

   go inside and make dinner.

      to expect your call.

           right here.

    I like what you've done.

101

    Do you want a suggestion?

102
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,999
  Try mirroring this structure
          in the front.

103

     some interesting lines.

    Someone was following me.

  Did you see who was driving?

135
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,802
        I didn't get one.

     maybe I just panicked.

       Maybe it's nothing.

143
00:09:40,138 --> 00:09:42,396
        Clearly, I'm just
   easily rattled these days.

144
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,991
 Eva, you were kidnapped out of
your own driveway and they never

145
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,810
  Caught the guy, if you think
    someone is following you,

146
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:47,811
  You should go to the police.

147
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:48,812
   I think we both know what a

148
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:50,146
  Waste of time that would be.

149
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:51,314
     I mean, if they didn't
        believe me then,

150
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:54,259
 Why would they believe me now?

151
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:56,761
       [sighs] I just wish
       I got my life back.

152
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:58,913
         You don't have
    to go through this alone.

153
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,006
Seriously, if you need anything.

154
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:01,248
      Yeah, no, thank you.

155
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,342
     I really appreciate you

156
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:03,435
       Looking out for me.

157
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:06,253
             -Yeah.
        -[car door shuts]

158
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,606
           -[dane] oh.
              -Wow.

159
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:08,998
      This day couldn't get
           any better.

160
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:11,610
  -Nancy for dinner again, huh?
              -Yup.

161
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,594
  That woman can't go one week
       without telling me

162
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,946
 How terrible of a parent I am.

163
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:17,115
            -Helpful.
         -Very helpful.

164
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:19,676
     So, uh, beers tonight,
     after I get rid of her?

165
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:21,361
         Yeah, yeah, no,
       I-I'm just about to

166
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,346
 Head out, but I should be back
      around 8:00 or 9:00.

167
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:25,940
   Great. Is that a new shirt?

168
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,201
    Oh. Uh, no, it's just...

169
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:29,519
           [chuckling]

170
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:33,280
     -Where are you headed?
            -Nowhere.

171
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,450
  Okay, so did you finally give
    my friend ashley a call?

172
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,544
   -Wouldn't you like to know?
     -I would like to know.

173
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,622
    Text me when you're done.
    I want all the hot goss.

174
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,050
Yeah, I-I think nancy needs you.

175
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:46,870
   I could use some help with
 these, if you're not too busy.

176
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:48,538
         [dane chuckles]

177
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,707
        Yeah. I may have
        some news myself.

178
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:52,466
   I'll be right there, nancy.

179
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,561
[eva] oh, wow, you went all out!

180
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:57,471
    Thank you so much, nancy,
       this is delicious.

181
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:00,158
 My pleasure. Grace, well, have
  a few more vegetables there.

182
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:02,643
    -Please. There's plenty.
       -Grace, just a few.

183
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:04,145
    Mom, what's the big news?

184
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:08,241
  So, 9 moon offered me the job

185
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:11,060
    As the creative director
     for their head office.

186
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,396
   Wait! 9 moon fashion house?

187
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:15,173
              -Yes.
      -Mom, that's amazing!

188
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:17,400
    Well, I mean, we're still
    working out the details,

189
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:21,421
  But, um, it comes with great
 perks and full health benefits.

190
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:23,164
      And the best part is
    they're gonna let me work

191
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,575
       On my own designs.

192
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:28,411
    -It's kind of a win-win.
             -Wait.

193
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,171
     Isn't their head office
          in new york?

194
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,692
            -Mm-hmm.
      -So, we'd be moving?

195
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:36,177
        What about school
        and our friends?

196
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,012
  Well, you'll make new friends
 and you'll go to a new school.

197
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:40,106
 I mean, that's exciting, right?

198
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:41,925
      Plus, this isn't just
     an opportunity for me,

199
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,684
   It's for you girls as well.

200
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:45,203
       Sami, you could go

201
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:47,263
 To the design school after you
            graduate.

202
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:49,782
 -Think about the opportunities.
 -Yeah, but we have a life here.

203
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,026
      -Well, I know, but--
     -if you needed money...

204
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,103
   I wish you would've asked.

205
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,606
        I-I don't, nancy,
         but thank you.

206
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:59,217
           Regardless,
   you can't sell this house.

207
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:01,035
    This was yours and ryan's
           first home.

208
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,556
 It'll be a fabulous first home
       for another couple.

209
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:07,374
 Right? New york's a fresh start
         for all of us.

210
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,286
   Moving across country isn't
  going to bury your past, eva.

211
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:11,545
  What's that supposed to mean,
             nancy?

212
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,972
  There are too many unanswered

213
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:15,567
            Questions
     regarding ryan's death!

214
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:16,809
           Moving away
   while his case is unsolved

215
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,811
    Is simply irresponsible.

216
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:20,387
     Don't you want to know
      what happened to him?

217
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,314
      Girls, do you mind...

218
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,482
    Just go to your room for

219
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,742
         Just a second.

220
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,986
            No, stay.

221
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,729
 -The matter of their father's--
          -nancy, stop!

222
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,898
     He had a heart attack.

223
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:33,585
 Why can't you understand that?
   Why can't you accept that?

224
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,145
     The facts of his death
         remain as murky

225
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:38,256
  As your apparent kidnapping.

226
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:47,840
   So easy for you to believe
      that ryan was killed,

227
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,009
  But it's-it's very difficult
      for you to understand

228
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,752
    That I was, I was taken.

229
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,163
Oh, yes, by someone who happened

230
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:56,941
        To drop you back
     in your own front yard?

231
00:12:57,093 --> 00:13:00,520
I was in a diabetic coma, nancy.
 You think I did that to myself?

232
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:03,356
      Then who did it, eva?
       Who kidnapped you?

233
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,193
   Oh, that's right, you can't
    remember. How convenient.

234
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,270
      Get out of my house.

235
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,622
       [nancy] excuse me?

236
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,084
     You heard me. Get out.

237
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,466
         [intense music]

238
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:40,893
  Congratulations on your job,
          mom. Really.

239
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:43,137
          Girls, wait.

240
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,447
             Grace.

246
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:41,212
        <i> What about you?</i>

247
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,032
     Sami? Everything okay?

248
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:49,036
   Yeah, sorry. My mom dropped
  this bombshell on us tonight.

249
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,056
 I don't know, I'm still trying
     to process everything.

250
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:55,894
    -[gabe]<i> what did she say?</i>
-Wow, it's later than I thought.

251
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,137
    I should go talk to her.
     I'll see you tomorrow?

252
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,231
          <i> Yeah. Night.</i>

       [knocking on door]

255
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:12,410
        Mom, can we talk?

256
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:20,668
         Mom, I'm sorry.

257
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,257
              Mom?

258
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,432
      See you at breakfast.

259
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,185
     I love you. Goodnight.

260
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,772
          -[clattering]
              -mom?

261
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,441
              Mom?

262
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:46,444
              Mom?

263
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:48,780
              Mom?

264
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:51,449
              Mom?

265
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:55,912
              Mom?

266
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:03,035
 Okay, so when was the last time
        you both saw her?

267
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,947
    Uh, around 4:00, I think,
right around when nancy arrived.

268
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,041
     And she didn't seem off
           in any way?

269
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:10,710
     She did say she thought

270
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:12,453
    Someone was following her
        earlier that day.

271
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:14,806
           -What? Who?
     -Sami, go to your room.

272
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:17,291
  -Let the adults handle this.
  -She didn't get a good look.

273
00:16:17,385 --> 00:16:19,602
 But said they drove a dark car.

274
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,371
            -And you?
             -Um...

275
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,399
 I-I left the house around 6:00.

276
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:28,135
           Is that it?

277
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,564
     -They had an argument.
             -About?

278
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,808
           [chuckles]
         family matters.

279
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:36,977
     That's enough from you.

280
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:38,997
           Okay, well,
    I've got your statements.

281
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:42,000
       So I will reach out
    when we've got something.

282
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:46,078
  Wait, you're leaving? You've
  been here, what, 20 minutes?

283
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:48,322
     Well, there's not a lot
      we can do right now.

284
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,174
  What are you even saying? You
 should be out looking for her.

285
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:52,585
         -We all should.
 -I understand you're concerned.

286
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,586
But we don't wanna jump the gun.

287
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:55,254
    Nobody's jumping the gun.

288
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:57,423
            My mom's
   obviously been taken again

289
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,575
    Because you couldn't find
  her kidnapper the first time.

290
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:03,079
     Sami, show the officer
          some respect.

291
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,248
         An open window
    and one knocked-over vase

292
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,433
       Aren't necessarily
      signs of a struggle.

293
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,435
  I mean, you told me you were
   in your bedroom all night.

294
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,678
   She could've just as easily
   walked out the front door.

295
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:13,756
    [sami] without her phone
          or her purse?

296
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:16,275
    Well, you'd be surprised
       how common that is

297
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,036
  For people having breakdowns.

298
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:20,429
          A breakdown?

299
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:23,875
   So she just left and we all
     just have to accept it?

300
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:30,715
  Give it 48 hours, and if your
mom isn't back by then, call me.

301
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:38,447
 -[grace] sami, what's going on?
           -Wonderful.

302
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:40,058
  You've woken up your sister.

303
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:43,352
           Sami, sami!

304
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,023
   [sami] detective campbell!

305
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:52,570
          [dane] sami!

306
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,152
    Hey, it's gonna be okay.

307
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,746
        How do you know?

308
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,707
     You're right, I don't.

309
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:11,506
           Dane, look.

310
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,094
     -[dane] careful. Sami!
      -Hey! [clicks camera]

311
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:18,838
        Sami, stop! Hey.

312
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,340
 Chasing after random cars isn't
   gonna bring your mom back.

313
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:23,392
    What am I supposed to do?

314
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:27,179
      Did you get a picture
      of the license plate?

315
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,607
  Send it to campbell. Come on.

316
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:32,610
            [sobbing]

317
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:35,613

318
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,312
     [cell phone vibrating]

319
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:11,315
        [dramatic music]

320
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,654
       [knocking on door]

321
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,487
        Do you remember,
     after your father died,

322
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,581
       How I came to stay
    with you girls for a week

323
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,592
  Because eva went on vacation?

324
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,829
  She wasn't on vacation, sami.

325
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:45,832
     Your mother fell apart.

326
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,093
     I was grieving my son,

327
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:51,355
  And I had to put that on hold
     to pick up her pieces.

328
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:53,766
I didn't want you or your sister
          seeing that.

329
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:57,695
     But your mother, she...

330
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:02,258
    She deals with stressful
   situations in her own way.

331
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:06,871
 She, um, you know, has trouble
     facing things head-on.

332
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:09,040
            Last year
    was just a practice run.

333
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:11,784
     This is the real thing.

334
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,861
  No. She would never leave us.

335
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:16,631
  I wish I could believe that.

336
00:20:18,443 --> 00:20:19,717
          That's mine.

337
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:23,203
   You leave this mess to me.

338
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:25,948
 I've cleaned it up once before.

339
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,968
     Pretty sure I was there
         last year, too.

340
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,469
      And after everything
  that's happened, you're still

341
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:32,045
    Treating me like a child.

342
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,714
    Get some rest, you girls

343
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,816
     Will be staying with me
       starting tomorrow.

344

      [instrumental music]

345
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:48,371
       Where are you, mom?

349
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:27,952
               Oh.

350
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,461
              What?

351
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:46,637
        [music continues]

352
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:48,639
               Ah.

353
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:00,985
            Ah! Ah...

354
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:05,948
               Oh.

355
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:10,119
         [intense music]

356
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:16,751

357
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:22,673
               Ow!

358
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:29,638
          Hello? Hello?

359
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:33,517
   Let me out of here! Please!

360
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:37,355
        Let me out! Help!
       Please let me out!

361
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:45,654
        What do you want?

362
00:22:48,593 --> 00:22:50,534
       Let me out of here.

363
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:52,036
       [captor on speaker]
       <i> you're not ready.</i>

364
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,690
              Sami?

365
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:27,071
        -I hate it here.
       -Tell me about it.

366
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:29,055
        It's like living
    in a haunted art gallery.

367
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,484
 We should be at home. We're old
  enough to stay by ourselves.

368
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,413
   It's only for a little bit,
      until mom comes back.

369
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,397
         How do you know
       she's coming back?

370
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,159
  Because she'd never leave us.

371
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,645
      You know that, right?

372
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:44,830
 [nancy] sami, grace, lunchtime!

373
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:46,215
            Let's go.

         [intense music]

377
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,944
    My bedroom's off-limits.
   You're not to go in there.

378
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,463
       Do you understand?

379
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,969
       [cutlery clanking]

380
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:38,217
         -Is this fizzy?
            -Mm-hmm.

381
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:39,885
  We haven't had it in forever,
        mom won't buy it

382
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:41,437
      Anymore since dad...

383
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,636
        Yes, well, I know
   how much you two enjoy it.

384
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,155
    Your father did as well.

385
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:52,990
     [cell phone vibrating]

386
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,569
     Has detective campbell
         called you yet?

387
00:24:57,722 --> 00:24:58,829
   -What are the police doing?
         -Rest assured.

388
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,331
          They're doing
      everything they can.

389
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:04,150
 Like what? Are they organizing
         a search party?

390
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,318
         Are they doing
   a press conference to alert

391
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:06,319
   People that she's missing?

392
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,247
     Sami, leave this all--

393
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:10,566
             To you?

394
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:13,402
  Yeah. You said that already.

395
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,347
 I will call detective campbell
 after lunch and get an update.

396
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:19,575
     But you have to promise
         to let this be.

397
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:23,003
  Now, let's finish our lunch.

398
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,523
 Afterwards you girls may watch
  some television if you like.

399
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:35,181
   [sighs]<i> so, how you doing?</i>

400
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,201
  I'm great, thanks for asking.

401
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:40,871
  Sorry, I know this is tough.

402
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,876
         No, I'm sorry.

403
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:47,770
     I feel like I'm in this
     never-ending nightmare

404
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:51,290
 And I can't shake myself awake.

405
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,458
    Do you think your grandma
  would let you have visitors?

406
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:56,278
          I can stop by
and give you some company and...

407
00:25:56,297 --> 00:25:58,538
    -I don't know, we could.
            -[sighs]

408
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,224
             -What?
       -My pencil crayons.

409
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,876
       I must've left them
          at the house.

410
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,395
     Well, couldn't you use
      something different?

411
00:26:04,622 --> 00:26:08,232
       It's not the same.
      I better go get them.

412
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:10,717
       Sami, are you sure
       that's a good idea?

413
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,886
Gabe, I need to get out of here.

414
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,813
     I can't stay cooped up
       for another second.

415
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,557
    Let me come pick you up.

416
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:21,745
  No, that old junker will just
    alert my dungeon master.

417
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:23,396
     It's a quick bus ride.
           It's cool.

418
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,398
      Okay, well, just, uh,

419
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,901
  Shoot me a text when you get
  there, so I know you're okay.

420
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:29,920
          -I will. Bye.
              -Bye.

           Oh. Hello.

424
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:18,302
       -You must be sami.
    -How do you know my name?

425
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:21,046
           Eva told me
    all about you and grace.

426
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,198
         Whoa! Hold on.

427
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,808
             -Wait.
       -Get away from her.

428
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,218
   -Get out! Get out of here.
       -I don't want any--

429
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,145
        Get out of here!

430
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:30,630
  -Are you okay? Who was that?
          -I-I don't...

431
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:32,316
       I don't know, um...

432
00:27:32,543 --> 00:27:35,210
   Wasn't that the car we saw
           yesterday?

433
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:38,805
   Yeah, I think so. Come on.

434
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,640
     [sami] and once again,
 detective, if you can call back

435
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:43,385
As soon as you get this message,
    I'd really appreciate it.

436
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:45,496
  As soon as possible, please.

437
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:50,817
  Hey, I'm gonna head home, but
 thanks for keeping an eye out.

438
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,318
     Yeah, yeah, of course.

439
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:56,340
        Sami, I'm sorry.

440
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:57,841
     I should've been there
           that night.

441
00:27:57,993 --> 00:27:59,659
 I should've been drinking beers
         with your mom,

442
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:02,513
   Not on some lame date. I...
   I could've done something.

443
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,664
      -I could've stopped--
      -no, hey, it's okay.

444
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,592
   It's not your fault. I know
   you would've if you could.

445
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,428
     Yeah, all right. Here.

446
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,430
     Let me give you a ride
     to your grandmother's.

447
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,249
   No, it's okay, bus stop is,
    like, half a block away.

448
00:28:14,268 --> 00:28:16,919
      -All right, come on.

00:40:26,483 --> 00:40:28,407
            But what?

600
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:31,319
    Why would her toothbrush
            be gone?

601
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:33,388
The kidnapper must've come back.

602
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:39,102
      -[doorknob rattling]
        -[intense music]

603
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:41,086
     -Did you lock the door?
       -I don't remember.

604
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,847
         [keys jingling]

605
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,683
        [music continues]

606
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,610
        [door unlocking]

607
00:40:51,024 --> 00:40:53,450
        [music continues]

608
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,527
              -Ah!
