00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:28,677
And with that movie <i>2001,</i> you're
projecting us into the 21st century.

3
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:30,679
- I brought along my son Jonathan...
- Hi.

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,417
who in the year 2001 will
be the same age as I am now.

5
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:39,521
Maybe he will be better adjusted to this
kind of world that you're trying to portray.

6
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,490
The big difference, when he grows up...

7
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,660
In fact, if we wanted to
wait till the year 2001...

8
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:46,762
He will have in his own house

9
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:49,966
not a computer as big as
this, but at least a console

10
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,670
through which he can talk to
his friendly local computer

11
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:55,972
and get all the information
he needs for his everyday life,

12
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,508
like his bank statements,
his theater reservations,

13
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:04,948
all the information you need in the course
of living in a complex modern society.

14
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,052
This will be in a compact
form in his own house.

15
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:12,421
He'll have a television screen,
like these here, and a keyboard.

16
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:14,790
And he'll talk to the computer
and get information from it.

17
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,560
And he'll take it as much for
granted as we take the telephone.

18
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:20,829
I wonder, though, what sort of a
life would it be like in social terms?

19
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,566
I mean, if our whole life
is built around the computer,

20
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,668
do we become a computer-dependent society?

21
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,704
In some ways, but they
will also enrich our society

22
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:32,508
because it will make it possible for
us to live, really, anywhere we like.

23
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,346
Any businessman and executive
could live almost anywhere on Earth

24
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,948
and still do his business
through a device like this.

25
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:43,552
And this is a wonderful thing. It means
we won't have to be stuck in cities.

26
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:47,357
We'll be able to live out in the
country or wherever we please.

27
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:53,930
<i>Screen says it's an
unimplemented trap.</i>

28
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:56,533
<i>But the error code is
wrong. It's a system error.</i>

29
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,734
- <i>So what's the upshot?</i>
- <i>It's not gonna say hello.</i>

30
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,170
<i>It absolutely is gonna say hello.</i>

31
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,638
- <i>It's nobody's fault. It's a system error.</i>
- <i>You built the voice demo.</i>

32
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,674
- The voice demo is flaky.
- Keep your voices down.

33
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:06,742
I've been telling you that
for... This thing is overbuilt.

34
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:09,011
It worked last night. It
worked the night before that.

35
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,347
It worked three hours ago.

36
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,483
- It's not working now, so just skip over the voice demo.
- Fuck you.

37
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:14,818
- Everything else is working.
- Shh.

38
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,519
Skip over the voice demo.

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,021
We need it to say hello.

40
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:21,623
- You're not hearing me. It's not going to say hello.
- Just fix it.

41
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:22,925
- Fix it?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:26,763
- In 40 minutes?
- Fix it.

43
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,630
- I can't.
- Who's the person who can?

44
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:31,335
I'm the person who can, and I can't.

45
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,636
- How bad are you saying?
- It's pretty bad.

46
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:38,441
- I don't know what that means.
- It means the demo is more than likely gonna crash.

47
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:39,842
You have to keep your voices down.

48
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,878
Joel Pforzheimer is
sitting out in the house.

49
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,447
I don't care if... Who's Joel Pforzheimer?

50
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:45,914
<i>GQ.</i>

51
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,617
He's been shadowing you
for a week. Did you notice?

52
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,486
Just look like everything's fine.

53
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,889
He's sitting out in the house.

54
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,425
Hey.

55
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:58,128
What are you guys saying?

56
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,698
Some kind of race condition, but we
haven't been able to track it down yet.

57
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,165
Is the synthesizer sampling fast enough?

58
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,901
No, so the rates are off
and it keeps crashing.

59
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,872
It's 20 seconds out of a two-hour
launch. Why not just cut it?

60
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,507
- We can't cut it.
- Yeah, you just cut it.

61
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:14,510
Two days ago, we ran a Super Bowl ad that
could've won the Oscar for Best Short Film.

62
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:17,880
There are more people who can tell you about
the ad than can tell you who won the game.

63
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,749
I understand, but the ad said
the Mac was gonna save the world.

64
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,885
It didn't say it was gonna say hello.

65
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,687
We open the house in five.

66
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:27,157
Don't open the house.

67
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:28,724
We're taking a quick break.

68
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:30,259
- Part of the problem is...
- What?

69
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,431
We can recompile, but if it's a hardware
problem, we can't get into the back.

70
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:35,998
Why not?

71
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,835
- Do you wanna tell her or should I?
- Don't start with me, man.

72
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:41,204
- Why can't he get into the machine?
- You need special tools.

73
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:43,806
What kind of special tools?
Just take a screwdriver.

74
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,842
He didn't want users to be able to open it.

75
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:48,812
You need special tools.

76
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,347
Is this for real?

77
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:53,483
There are a hundred engineers walking
around here. None of them have the tools?

78
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,985
In fairness, not many of
them were issued the tools.

79
00:03:55,986 --> 00:04:00,156
- What about you?
- I left them at the office. It was 3:00 AM when I...

80
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,758
Oh, Jesus Christ.

81
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,826
- Cut "Hello."
- No.

82
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,028
- What's the first rule of a launch?
- It's not gonna crash.

83
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,597
It just did.

84
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:08,664
Andy!

85
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,532
Which one?

86
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,701
The other Andy. You're right
there. Why would I be calling out?

87
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:14,069
- He needs to talk to you.
- Yeah.

88
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,240
The exit signs need to be off or
we're not gonna get a full blackout.

89
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:20,009
- We've spoken to the building manager and the fire marshal.
- And?

90
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,077
There's no way they're gonna
let us turn the exit signs off.

91
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,247
I'll pay whatever the fine is.

92
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:26,615
The fine is they're gonna come
in and tell everyone to leave.

93
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,884
You explained to the fire marshal
that we're in here changing the world?

94
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:32,855
I did, but unless we can also change
the properties of fire, he doesn't care.

95
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,492
- Steve...
- If a fire causes a stampede to the unmarked exits,

96
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:37,894
it'll have been well worth
it for those who survive.

97
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,497
For those who don't, less
so, but still pretty good.

98
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:43,199
- Look, I...
- I need it to go black. Real black.

99
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,134
Get rid of the exit signs and
don't let me know how you did it.

100
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:48,539
Fix the voice demo.

101
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:54,511
You need special tools to open the Mac?

102
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:56,278
You knew it was a closed system.

103
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,915
I didn't know literally. Jesus.

104
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,117
And if you keep alienating
people for no reason,

105
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:03,752
there's gonna be no one
left for it to say hello to.

106
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:05,120
It's not for no reason.

107
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,658
We blow this and IBM will own the
next 50 years like a Batman villain.

108
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:11,995
Remember the phone company? That's what
Bell was called, "the phone company."

109
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:14,062
IBM will be the computer company.

110
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,766
Ten years later they'll
be the information company,

111
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:19,168
and that's very bad for the human race.

112
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,971
So we don't have time to
be polite or realistic,

113
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:24,540
'cause if we are, this
company's next product launch

114
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,108
will be held in front of 26 people

115
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:28,944
and a stringer from the
Alameda County Shopper's Guide.

116
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,047
We haven't advertised the voice software.

117
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:34,951
We could pull it out of the demo
and no one would be disappointed.

118
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,052
Do you want to try being reasonable,

119
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:41,291
just, you know, see what it feels like?

120
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:47,096
Okay. Pull the voice demo.

121
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,031
Thank you.

122
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:50,165
And then cancel the launch.

123
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,668
I see. You just tricked me a little.

124
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,305
You can tell me how unimportant it is,
but if the computer doesn't say hello,

125
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:59,041
then neither will John Sculley,
who I promise you agrees with me.

126
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:02,711
Sculley's not gonna cancel the
launch 'cause he's not insane.

127
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,947
He's also not a hack, and
when it comes to the Macintosh,

128
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,649
he's gonna do what I ask him to do.

129
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,185
- What's in this box?
- Nothing you need to worry about.

130
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:10,720
Don't even open it.

131
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,754
What the fuck?

132
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:15,692
Why is there a carton of... Who did this?

133
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:17,427
- Somebody thought...
- Who?

134
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:21,697
Doesn't matter. Thought it would be a good
idea to have copies of that <i>Time</i> cover

135
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,233
available at everyone's seat.

136
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:26,302
It was nipped in the bud and all the
copies are being taken out of the building.

137
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,937
So problem solved.

138
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,872
- This isn't a Macintosh.
- I understand.

139
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,975
Somebody thought it would
be a good idea to, like,

140
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:37,747
enthusiastically hand over copies of
<i>Time</i> with a not-a-Macintosh on the cover

141
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:39,382
at the launch of the Macintosh?

142
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:41,283
What are they handing
out at Hewlett-Packard?

143
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:43,286
A bushel of apples with my face on them?

144
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:46,889
I'm sure the thinking was that
since the computer is Man of the Year

145
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,358
that that's good for our business,

146
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:50,759
but like I said, I'm having
them removed from the building.

147
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,129
What I'd like you to do with them
is to take them, all 2,600 copies,

148
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,932
and stack them on Kottke's desk

149
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:58,033
and tell him Steve says,
"Happy New Year to you."

150
00:06:58,034 --> 00:06:58,935
Okay.

151
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:01,204
I gave <i>Time</i> magazine full access.

152
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:03,906
The whole campus: Bandley, Apple II, Lisa.

153
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:08,411
I gave him Sculley, Markkula. I
gave him Woz. I gave him everybody.

154
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:11,781
What should I call the person who thought
it'd be a good idea to hand these out?

155
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:14,016
I'm not telling you who it was.

156
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,386
It was done without malice.
It's been taken care of.

157
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:19,254
You have a half hour and we
have things to talk about.

158
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:20,923
Like what?

159
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:24,793
Like a million in the first 90 days.

160
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,194
- Joanna...
- 20,000 a month after that.

161
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,562
- Look. Those are the forecasts.
- I'm begging...

162
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:33,403
This is my field. I'm begging you
to manage expectations out there.

163
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:37,939
- I'm fanning expectations.
- We're not gonna sell a million in the first 90 days.

164
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,744
Everyone, everyone, everyone,

165
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:44,312
<i>everyone</i> is waiting for the Mac.

166
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:46,115
Maybe.

167
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:49,018
But what happens when they
find out that for 2,495,

168
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,120
there's nothing you can do with it?

169
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:54,423
We were competitive at $1,500,

170
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:58,360
but once you replaced the
Motorola 6809 with the 68000...

171
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:02,098
Which is what supports menus, windows,
point and click, high-res graphics...

172
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,334
Yeah, 'cause everyone needs
rectangles with rounded corners.

173
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:09,907
Coach lands on the runway at the
exact same time as first class.

174
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,778
I don't have the first
fucking idea what that means,

175
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,747
but this is how it got to $2,500,

176
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:21,084
which is the price point on
the PC, which can do a lot more!

177
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:24,353
Who's gonna want a PC?
What idiot is gonna want...

178
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:27,889
If I wanna tell you there's a spot
on your shirt, I point to the spot.

179
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,827
I don't say there's a spot 14
centimeters down from the collar

180
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:33,796
and three centimeters to the
right of the second button

181
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:36,932
while I try to remember what
the command is for club soda.

182
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,934
That's not how a person's mind works.

183
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,740
If the goal was ease of use, maybe
you should've given it some memory.

184
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:46,374
You can complain about memory
or you can complain about price,

185
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,445
but you can't do both at the same time.

186
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,413
Memory is what costs money.

187
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:53,883
I'm glad you're telling me
your feelings about the Mac now

188
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:55,518
because we have a half hour left.

189
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,153
We can redesign it.

190
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:59,889
I'm just asking you to manage expectations.

191
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,857
Look at their faces
when they see what it is.

192
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:05,193
They won't know what they're
looking at or why they like it,

193
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,230
but they'll know they want it.

194
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,999
Not instantly. When people
heard <i>Rite of Spring,</i>

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,235
they tore the chairs out of the theater.

196
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:13,436
They didn't buy the record.

197
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:16,371
<i>Rite of Spring</i> happens
to be the most revolutionary

198
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:18,039
and provocative symphony
of the last century.

199
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,375
Ballet. It was a ballet.

200
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:24,246
But Igor Stravinsky didn't say he
was gonna sell 20,000 units a month.

201
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,883
I don't know why we're
talking about Stravinsky

202
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:31,086
when what I care about is Dan Kottke
sodomizing me in <i>Time</i> magazine.

203
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:35,390
Look. Obviously...

204
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,360
Let me say this to you.

205
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:40,462
Obviously, Daniel didn't think
he was doing anything wrong.

206
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:44,033
- By talking to <i>Time</i> about it?
- Yeah.

207
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:46,067
I don't know what that means.

208
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:48,804
You said, when you told me the story...

209
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:50,907
You said you said to Dan,

210
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:53,842
"Did <i>Time</i> magazine ask you
if I had a daughter named Lisa?"

211
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,378
And Dan said, "Yeah."

212
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,316
My point was that he answered
you simply and honestly

213
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:02,451
because he didn't think
he'd done anything wrong.

214
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:07,222
Except, Joanna... Except I
don't have a daughter named Lisa.

215
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:11,159
And this story is now about how I'm
denying paternity and took a blood test.

216
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,496
And that's why there's a picture of...
I don't know what the fuck that is.

217
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:16,999
That's why there's a
picture of a PC on the cover

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,570
instead of a picture of me and the Mac.

219
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:22,938
I don't know what to tell you.

220
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:26,609
I was supposed to be <i>Time</i>
magazine's Man of the Year.

221
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,279
And then Dan Kottke was born.

222
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:36,085
- Well...
- What?

223
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:40,188
- She's waiting for you.
- Who?

224
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:42,158
- Chrisann.
- Brennan?

225
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,625
They're out in the hall.

226
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:47,129
They've been sitting in the back of
the auditorium since 7:00 this morning.

227
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,566
I'm not having a session
with Chrisann right now.

228
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,269
We issued 335 press
credentials for the launch.

229
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,273
Steve, you piss off Chrisann,

230
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:00,543
she's gonna stand in the
lobby and give 335 interviews,

231
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:05,783
and you, pal, will be longing for
the halcyon days of Dan Kottke.

232
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,219
Let me get this over with.

233
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,520
But don't leave. You're gonna stay here.

234
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:13,956
What? No. I'm not.

235
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:17,426
No. There's less of a chance of a
scene if you stay here. She'll be cool.

236
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:22,298
I find all this excruciatingly
personal and-and...

237
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:24,933
I-I'm... I'm not staying.

238
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,434
No. Come on.

239
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,639
I don't wanna be in a
room alone with Chrisann.

240
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:34,945
This is me and you.

241
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,917
Fine.

242
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,093
Hey.

243
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,931
Steve.

244
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:56,298
This is a surprise.

245
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,600
Why don't you come on in?

246
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,837
Thank you.

247
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:05,474
- You coming too?
- Yes, I'm not gonna leave her in the hallway.

248
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,943
Okay. It's a safe hallway, but anyway.

249
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,712
You remember Joanna Hoffman? She's
the head of marketing for the Mac.

250
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:13,182
Good to see you.

251
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,650
Nice to see you. Hello, Lisa.

252
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,653
We've met before, and you told
me you like the way I talk,

253
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:22,357
and that was my favorite
thing anyone's ever said to me.

254
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,360
- You're from Poland.
- Yes, I am.

255
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:27,129
- Do you know where that is?
- The top of the Earth.

256
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,097
I think you're thinking of the North Pole.

257
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:30,999
Well, we're a little
pressed for time, so...

258
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,402
- I'll leave you guys alone.
- Why do you wanna leave when you just said...

259
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:35,839
I'm gonna check in with Hertzfeld.

260
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:45,548
We're trying to get a
computer to say hello,

261
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:48,116
but right now it's being very shy.

262
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:50,052
Would you come help me? Is that okay?

263
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:51,653
Sure.

264
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:54,123
Thank you.

265
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:56,057
My dad named a computer after me.

266
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:59,495
I'm not your...

267
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:02,731
Actually, do you know what
a coincidence is, Lisa?

268
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:05,169
No.

269
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,404
Like if you met someone.

270
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,706
You made a new friend
and her name was Lisa too.

271
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,576
That would be a coincidence.

272
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:16,578
"Lisa" stands for "Local
Integrated Systems Architecture."

273
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,215
L-I-S-A.

274
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,785
It's a coincidence.

275
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:26,654
- You about done?
- Yeah.

276
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,489
Okay.

277
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,930
Come. Let's make that computer say hi.

278
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:36,097
Go ahead, Lisa.

279
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:39,268
So it was the other way around.

280
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,537
I was named after the computer?

281
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:44,807
Nothing was named after
anybody. It's a coincidence.

282
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:47,144
Come on.

283
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,383
What's the matter with you?

284
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:55,583
What's the matter with you? Why
are you telling her these things?

285
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,552
Why are you still telling
her I'm her father?

286
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:59,455
- A judge told her you're her father.
- No, he didn't.

287
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,322
Where the hell do you get off
telling <i>Time</i> magazine

288
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:03,325
I've slept with 28 percent
of the men in America?

289
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:05,293
- That's not...
- Where do you get off?

290
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:08,130
That's not remotely what I said.

291
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:13,168
It's right here.

292
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,137
First of all, can I tell you
something about <i>Time</i> magazine?

293
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,840
I believe it's a training
facility for paid assassins.

294
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:21,342
- "Jobs insists"... I am quoting...
- I didn't invent math.

295
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:24,480
"...twenty-eight percent of the
male population of the United States

296
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:26,615
could be the father."

297
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,619
I wasn't saying you've slept
with 28% of American men.

298
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,522
I was using an algorithm
based on the blood test

299
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:37,659
which said there was a 94.1%
chance that I'm the father.

300
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,863
You're trying to publicly
paint me as a slut and a whore.

301
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:43,365
Believe me, I'm not trying to
publicly do anything with you.

302
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,067
Two million people read
<i>Time.</i> How am I supposed...

303
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:48,703
It would be more if they put me on the cover,
but Dan Kottke decided to kidney-punch me...

304
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:51,874
- I applied for welfare yesterday.
- I'm sorry?

305
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,878
- Hello!
- I said I applied for welfare yesterday.

306
00:14:56,178 --> 00:15:00,615
The <i>Time</i> article said your
Apple stock was worth $441 million,

307
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:02,750
and I wanted to ask you
how you felt about that.

308
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,587
Well, I feel like Apple stock
has been dramatically undervalued.

309
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,523
This would be a good time to get in.

310
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:10,259
Your daughter and her mother...

311
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,461
- Chrisann...
- are on welfare.

312
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:15,197
We're living in a hovel in Menlo Park.

313
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:16,698
We can't pay the heating bills.

314
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,235
She sleeps in a parka.

315
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:21,537
- Your daughter...
- She's not my daughter!

316
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:24,572
Because, as reported
by <i>Time</i> magazine,

317
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,543
- I've slept with 28% of the men in America?
- No.

318
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:31,148
All of them, exactly nine
months before Lisa was born.

319
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:38,287
I've got Andy here.

320
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,331
Excuse me.

321
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:57,572
We're there?

322
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:59,575
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, Andy.

323
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:01,342
- How are you doin'?
- Terrible.

324
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:02,677
You guys caught up now?

325
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:05,313
Excuse me for saying hello to my
friend, who thinks you're a dick.

326
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:06,715
- I don't think you're a...
- We're there?

327
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,751
- No. It's got a one-in-six chance of working.
- Goddamn it.

328
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:14,590
Well, we're not a pit crew at Daytona.
This can't be fixed in seconds.

329
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,458
You didn't have seconds.
You had three weeks.

330
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,528
The universe was created
in a third of that time.

331
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:22,798
Well, someday you'll have
to tell us how you did it.

332
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:28,736
Here's what I'm gonna do.

333
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,874
I'm gonna announce the names of
everyone who designed the launch demo.

334
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,677
I'm gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up.

335
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,980
The bag was designed by Susan Kare.

336
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,884
The Macintosh font that's scrolling across
the screen was designed by Steve Capps.

337
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:45,221
The starry night and
skywriting was Bruce Horn.

338
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:50,859
MacPaint, MacWrite, Alice,
down to the calculator.

339
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,762
And then I'm gonna say the
voice demo that didn't work

340
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,667
was designed by Andy Hertzfeld.

341
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,238
Steve...

342
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:07,508
Five-in-six is your chance of surviving
the first round of Russian roulette,

343
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,378
and you've reversed those odds.

344
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,580
So unless you wanna be disgraced
in front of your friends,

345
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:14,783
family, colleagues,
stockholders and the press,

346
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,552
I wouldn't stand here arguing.

347
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:19,921
I'd go try and get some
more bullets out of the gun.

348
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:22,258
Do it, Andy!

349
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,397
Stop. You.

350
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:30,299
- What size shirt do you wear?
- Me?

351
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,801
Does anyone know what size shirt
he wears? What size shirt I wear?

352
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,036
Does anyone know where the
closest psychiatrist is?

353
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:37,906
The disk fits in your pocket.

354
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:40,542
I need a shirt with a breast
pocket. I can take it out onstage.

355
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:42,043
- A shirt?
- The disk!

356
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:45,046
I need a white shirt in my
size with a breast pocket.

357
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:48,350
Yes. Which one of the no
stores that are open at 8:45

358
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:51,853
do you want me to have someone run
to and return from in 15 minutes?

359
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:55,724
Go out in the lobby, find someone
my size who's wearing a white shirt.

360
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:58,026
Tell them I'll trade
them for a free computer,

361
00:17:58,027 --> 00:17:59,794
and they get to keep my shirt.

362
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:02,063
Does it have to be a
white shirt? Is blue okay?

363
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:06,802
No. The Mac is beige, I'm beige, the
disk is blue, the shirt has to be white.

364
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:08,237
Andy?

365
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,828
Hello, I'm Macintosh.

366
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:36,732
Bring me the head of Andy Hertzfeld.

367
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,966
I tried to get it to
say hello, but it's shy.

368
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,035
Yeah.

369
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,603
So that's it?

370
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:45,207
That's it.

371
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,110
I don't get it.

372
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:49,745
I know.

373
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:51,612
What are people going to do with it?

374
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,349
Lisa, how old are you now?

375
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,484
- You know how old she is.
- How old are you, Lisa?

376
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:57,254
Five.

377
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,524
Come sit here for a minute.

378
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:06,527
Do you know what this is?

379
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:09,630
- It's a computer.
- It's a computer.

380
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:12,134
Can I borrow your hand for a second?

381
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,139
Point that arrow and click.

382
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,676
You don't have to, but if you
want, you can play with it.

383
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:23,911
Nothing you can do will break it,
so just do whatever you want with it.

384
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,112
What are you doing?

385
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:28,883
I'm paying you exactly what
the court ordered me to pay you.

386
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:31,786
$385 a month.

387
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,755
I'm not the one who decided on that amount.

388
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,657
And I'm asking you how you feel.

389
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:37,158
If you feel all right.

390
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,661
- If it feels all right to you that your daughter...
- She's not my...

391
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:43,399
That your daughter and
her mother are on welfare

392
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,402
while you're worth $441
million for making that.

393
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:50,539
I'm proud to say Apple donates
computers to underfunded schools,

394
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,041
- and we'll be doing more of the same with the Mac...
- What?

395
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:56,844
Apple donates millions of dollars'
worth of computers to schools.

396
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:58,880
What does that have to do with...

397
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:03,752
Imagine an underprivileged kid that has
their favorite teacher with them 24 hours.

398
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:05,687
We're minutes away from
being able to do that.

399
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:08,424
In your head, was that
an answer to my question?

400
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:09,957
Tell me the question again.

401
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,128
I wasn't the one who sued
you for child support.

402
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,697
- No, let...
- San Mateo County sued you.

403
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:18,699
No, let me explain what happened,
'cause I have plenty of time right now.

404
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:22,070
Excuse me. You have a visitor.

405
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:24,639
Just wanted to say good
luck. Hey, Chrisann.

406
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,444
- Hello, Woz.
- Hang on.

407
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,482
- Just wanted to say good luck.
- Thanks. You too.

408
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,882
- It's a big morning.
- Yeah.

409
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,784
You should see this crowd out there.

410
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:39,421
This crowd, it's like, um...

411
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:43,524
I can't really wait for you to
come up with a metaphor, man.

412
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:46,462
- Yeah. So, listen, I want to ask you a favor.
- Yeah?

413
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,231
- Can you acknowledge the Apple II team in your remarks?
- I cannot.

414
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:50,799
Just an acknowledgement.

415
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,768
Have them stand up.

416
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,870
- We're launching the Mac.
- It'd be a morale booster.

417
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:58,040
Just a mention so they could
get a round of applause.

418
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,242
- Just a mention.
- Can we stick a pin in this for a minute?

419
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:01,776
- Sure.
- Thank you.

420
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:04,012
Just talking about an
acknowledgement for the team.

421
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,180
I've got Chrisann in there.
I'll see you in a second.

422
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,649
Yep.

423
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,024
That.

424
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,391
What?

425
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:20,928
You asked me what people are gonna
do with it. They're gonna do that.

426
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,966
One of the engineers.

427
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,937
Thank you.

428
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,146
Do you like it?

429
00:21:39,082 --> 00:21:40,181
I'm sorry?

430
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:42,950
It's an abstract.

431
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:47,289
You used MacPaint.

432
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,529
Push that key and the "S" at the same time.

433
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:58,000
Now type your name.

434
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,580
Do you know which box says "Save"?

435
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:15,217
Right. Go ahead and click on it.

436
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,626
I'll put some money in your account

437
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:27,763
and buy you a new house,
someplace near a decent school.

438
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,732
Thank you.

439
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,735
Woz wants a minute.

440
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:36,204
And Sculley's asking for you.

441
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:39,107
We're done?

442
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:43,277
Could you teach me more things?

443
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,613
On the computer?

444
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,583
Lisa, wait for me in the hall, please.

445
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:53,187
You can put your coat on in the hall.

446
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,623
Bye, Lisa.

447
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:58,327
- Bye.
- Lisa, in the hall. Now.

448
00:22:58,328 --> 00:23:00,762
I wanna know, when you say you're
gonna put money in my account,

449
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:02,164
how much we're talking about.

450
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:04,768
It's a school day. She
needs to be in school.

451
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,239
I'm gonna give you whatever you need.

452
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:30,024
Woz wants me to acknowledge
the Apple II team.

453
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:32,260
You must be able to see
that she looks like you.

454
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:34,830
I don't want to insult Woz. I
just think it's backward-looking

455
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,665
at exactly the wrong moment.

456
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,700
- I know you heard what I said.
- I heard what you said, Joanna.

457
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:42,904
It's just we're about to do this thing.

458
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:48,043
At 9:41, the planet's gonna shift
on its axis nigh and forever.

459
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:50,779
Two most significant
events of the 20th century:

460
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,649
the Allies win the war and this.

461
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,016
This.

462
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,319
So maybe right now isn't the
very best time to scold me

463
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,222
for not being a better father
to a kid who's not my kid.

464
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:03,324
- The test said I...
- I don't care what the test said.

465
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:04,592
I don't care about 94.1%

466
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:07,329
or the insane algorithm you used
to get to 28% of American men.

467
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,430
Buying her a new house.
I'm giving her money.

468
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:12,167
There's a small girl who
believes you're her father.

469
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:16,671
That's all. That's all the math there is.

470
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:20,207
She believes it. What are
you gonna do about that?

471
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,977
God sent his only son on a suicide mission,

472
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:26,682
but we like him anyway
because he made trees.

473
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,918
We're gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days.

474
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,987
20,000 a month after that.

475
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:35,792
So maybe you could give
me a break, Ms. Hoffman?

476
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:29,377
- Woz.
- Hey.

477
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:32,013
There's nothing in that vending
machine that won't kill you.

478
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:34,248
- Just browsing.
- Let's take a walk.

479
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:36,350
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

480
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:39,754
After the meeting in Maui, the Apple
II team was upset and angry and down.

481
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:42,157
- Do you know why?
- Because the Apple II wasn't mentioned even once?

482
00:25:42,158 --> 00:25:44,793
The Apple II wasn't mentioned ev...

483
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,427
Yes, that's it. You have it. Yes.

484
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:49,531
- That wasn't an oversight.
- They know that. They know it wasn't.

485
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:51,766
I don't wanna make a
big deal out of this...

486
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:53,334
That's entirely within your power.

487
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:56,103
- The Apple II is...
- The Apple II is what was, my friend.

488
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:59,808
The Apple II is what pays the bills
around here and has for seven years.

489
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,075
And if you embarrass these people,

490
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:04,044
you are going to see a brain
drain at this company, my brother.

491
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:06,814
Markkula took you off the Lisa, not
them and not me, so don't blame...

492
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:11,319
Markkula took me off the Lisa because of his
strong religious objection to making it good.

493
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,188
Now I gave you everything
you wanted on the Apple II.

494
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:15,924
You don't ask for a lot?

495
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:18,392
There wasn't a single fight you lost.

496
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:20,962
Do you concede the slots are the
reason for the success of the Apple II?

497
00:26:20,963 --> 00:26:23,098
- We can't still be talking about the slots.
- I have a point.

498
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:26,066
It's been seven years. You're still
doing it. You're talking about the slots.

499
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:29,004
There's something wrong with you.
This argument started in the garage.

500
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:33,809
What are you talking about? Why
would you only want two slots?

501
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,811
A printer and a modem.

502
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:37,344
With eight slots, you...

503
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,415
This is a huge deal that we
were able to add eight slots.

504
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:43,318
I appreciate the engineering,
but it's not what we're doing.

505
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,020
- And thank God I won that argument...
- Woz.

506
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,822
because the open system is what
people love about the machine,

507
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,323
and it's why it sold and still sells.

508
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:51,993
An open system. We're
not doing an open system.

509
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:55,964
Of course we are. That's what people want,
and the breakthrough on the Apple II...

510
00:26:55,965 --> 00:26:58,833
People don't know what they
want until you show it to them.

511
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:03,504
Serious users want to customize. They
wanna modify. They wanna jack it up.

512
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:07,042
They want hardware engineers like
me to expand its capabilities, okay?

513
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,976
Keyboards for music, better sound board,

514
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:10,879
better display boards,
improved memory cards.

515
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,215
And it's why there are
3,000 people here right now.

516
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:17,252
The slots are what allowed the Apple II
to run, for just one example, VisiCalc,

517
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:21,356
which from my guess single-handedly sold
between 200,000 and 300,000 machines.

518
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:24,325
- They want slots.
- They don't get a vote.

519
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:27,862
When Dylan wrote "Shelter from the Storm," he
didn't ask people to contribute to the lyrics.

520
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,864
Plays don't stop so the
playwright can ask the audience

521
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,233
what scene they'd like to see next.

522
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:32,200
- Painters...
- Hobbyists...

523
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:35,870
We're on the verge of
a tectonic... Hobbyists?

524
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,806
A printer and a modem. Two slots.

525
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:41,008
The Apple II team has my affection,

526
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:44,478
but I'm not loving up a seven-year-old
product at the Mac launch.

527
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:47,882
- Computers aren't paintings.
- Fuck you.

528
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:51,285
I'm gonna say "fuck you" every time you
say that until you either die or stop.

529
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:52,987
- Steve...
- Try it.

530
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:54,121
- Steve.
- Say it.

531
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:56,925
- Computers aren't paintings.
- Fuck you.

532
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,995
Yes, they are, and what
I want is a closed system.

533
00:27:59,996 --> 00:28:04,100
End-to-end control. Completely
incompatible with anything.

534
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:10,572
Computers aren't supposed
to have human flaws.

535
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:14,009
I'm not going to build this one with yours.

536
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,553
Steve!

537
00:28:26,554 --> 00:28:27,589
Hey.

538
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,225
Today is about the Macintosh.
And the Mac is mine.

539
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:32,994
- I give you that.
- Thank you.

540
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:35,397
I give you that. Just publicly
acknowledge the Apple II team

541
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:36,831
'cause it's the right thing to do.

542
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:40,467
We'll know soon enough if you are
Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are,

543
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,236
but in the meantime, it would be great...

544
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:45,139
In the meantime, the Apple II is done.

545
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,207
Seven years. It was a great run.

546
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,746
You should go out in the
house and take your seat.

547
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,448
The Mac is Jef Raskin's.

548
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,051
Say it for me.

549
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:57,518
- Computers aren't...
- Fuck you.

550
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,486
All right.

551
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:06,062
Five, six...

552
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:09,097
- We're there?
- I need more time.

553
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:11,131
- You can't have it.
- 20 minutes.

554
00:29:11,132 --> 00:29:13,435
- It's 8:58.
- We can start late.

555
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:16,236
Hear me. We're a computer
company. We can't start late.

556
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,305
- Then I have another idea.
- What?

557
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:21,008
It's deceptive and borderline unethical.

558
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,078
- I'm listening.
- It'll run on the 512.

559
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:25,045
- You tested it?
- Yeah.

560
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:29,383
- Wait. You're gonna demo a 128 computer on a 512?
- Nobody's gonna know.

561
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:32,087
And you think that's
<i>borderline</i> unethical?

562
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:34,989
Name my other choices, please.

563
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,693
Please. You have to tell me why it's
so important for it to say hello.

564
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:42,764
Hollywood. They made
computers scary things.

565
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:46,400
See how this reminds you of a friendly
face, that the disk slot is a goofy grin?

566
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:51,072
It's warm and it's playful
and it needs to say hello.

567
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:53,408
It needs to say hello because it can.

568
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,517
We're not committing fraud.

569
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:06,620
The 512 is gonna ship in under a year.

570
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:09,792
Will you absolve me of your
Eastern European disapproval?

571
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,629
The computer in <i>2001</i> said hello all the
time and it still scared the shit out of me.

572
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,967
Absolve me.

573
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,602
Just for this.

574
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:24,104
And just for now.

575
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:30,078
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
founding board member Mike Markkula.

576
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,654
All right. Okay.

577
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:42,256
Go make a dent in the universe, Steven.

578
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,559
See you in a couple hours.

579
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,262
And I'm going to take us through
the formal part of the meeting,

580
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,696
the legal part, if you will.

581
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:52,332
Thank merciful God. The cavalry's shown up.

582
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,469
I hear you've been worse than usual this
morning. I didn't think that was possible.

583
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,206
So I've been dispatched
as the "Steve Whisperer."

584
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:01,609
This is a '55 Margaux.

585
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,245
- It's 9:00 in the morning.
- This is a '55 Margaux.

586
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,820
Is it my imagination or have
you started to dress like me?

587
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:14,722
It was a bad idea to have Markkula
open with quarterly reports.

588
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:16,858
Instead we should have just
dropped water on the audience.

589
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:20,495
You know, just big 10,000-gallon tanks
of cold water, dropped from the ceiling.

590
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:22,362
Save Mike some money on index cards.

591
00:31:22,363 --> 00:31:24,832
- Oh, just relax.
- Why?

592
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,802
I don't know. No one's
ever asked me that question.

593
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,206
There you go.

594
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,379
You're the only one who sees
the world the same way I do.

595
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,217
No one sees the world the same way you do.

596
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,319
I'm like Julius Caesar, John.

597
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,888
- I'm surrounded by enemies.
- No, you're not.

598
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:50,190
- The board...
- Oh, the board. The board's behind you.

599
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:51,825
Only because you see to it they are.

600
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,227
I think it's a good board,

601
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:56,397
but if you want me to push them out
one by one, we can talk about that.

602
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:58,299
I want you to push them out all at once...

603
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,834
through a window, if it's the nearest exit.

604
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,138
The look on their faces
when we showed them the spot.

605
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:05,873
I couldn't see their faces, 'cause they
were banging their heads on the table.

606
00:32:05,874 --> 00:32:09,811
Yeah, yeah. Yesterday, the
day after it airs <i>once,</i>

607
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:12,514
the publisher of <i>Adweek</i> calls
it the best commercial of all time.

608
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:16,148
Of all time! And it is.

609
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:18,785
And if anyone does one better, it's gonna be
Chiat/Day, who the board wanted to replace,

610
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:21,555
and it's gonna be Lee Clow, who the
board thought was out of his mind.

611
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:24,359
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, "1984."</i>

612
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,727
<i>The first glorious anniversary</i>

613
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:29,330
<i>of the information
purification directives.</i>

614
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:33,600
<i>We have created for the
first time in all history</i>

615
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:36,638
<i>a garden of pure ideology</i>

616
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:39,239
<i>where each worker may bloom,</i>

617
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,710
<i>secure from the pests purveying
contradictory thoughts.</i>

618
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:49,883
<i>Our unification of thoughts is more powerful
a weapon than any fleet or army on earth.</i>

619
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,485
<i>We are one people...</i>

620
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:53,220
Did we use skinheads as extras?

621
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,689
- A couple of people have told me that.
- Yeah.

622
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,859
We paid skinheads? I've
got skinheads on my payroll?

623
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,527
- They had a look you wanted.
- The skinheads?

624
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:03,731
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's keep that to ourselves.

625
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,169
<i>We shall prevail.</i>

626
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:15,944
<i>On January 24th, Apple Computer
will introduce Macintosh.</i>

627
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:18,379
- Who else knows?
- Who else knows what?

628
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,482
- That we paid terrorists to be in our TV commercial.
- John...

629
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:24,319
They were wrong about the ad, but
they're a good board. Good people.

630
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,853
Their only problem... Their
problem is that they're people.

631
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:31,225
People. The very nature of people
is something to be overcome.

632
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:36,231
When I was running Pepsi, we had a lot
of success focusing on 18-to-55-year-olds

633
00:33:36,232 --> 00:33:38,632
- who weren't members of violent hate groups.
- I get it.

634
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:40,368
You're not surrounded by enemies.

635
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:42,536
We're almost there.

636
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:45,372
I'm back and forth on the Dylan.

637
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:46,707
I might quote a different verse.

638
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:47,941
What are the choices?

639
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,511
"For the loser now will be later to win,"

640
00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:52,714
- which is what we have.
- Mm-hmm. Or?

641
00:33:52,715 --> 00:33:55,550
"Come mothers and fathers
throughout the land

642
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:57,485
and don't criticize what
you can't understand.

643
00:33:57,486 --> 00:33:58,986
Your sons and your daughters"...

644
00:33:58,987 --> 00:34:00,588
"Are beyond your command."

645
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:02,389
I just lost a hundred
bucks to Andy Hertzfeld.

646
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,260
He said you'd change it to that verse.

647
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:09,165
We got 45 seconds. I want to
use it to ask you a question.

648
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:14,902
Why do people who are adopted feel like
they were rejected instead of selected?

649
00:34:14,903 --> 00:34:16,069
That came out of nowhere.

650
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,538
"Your sons and your daughters
are beyond your command.

651
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,641
Your old road is rapidly aging."

652
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,344
So go fuck yourself, because
my name is Steve Jobs,

653
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:25,347
and the times, they are a-changin'.

654
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,016
I don't feel rejected.

655
00:34:28,017 --> 00:34:30,018
- You're sure?
- Very sure.

656
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:32,687
'Cause it's not like the baby is
born and the parents look and say,

657
00:34:32,688 --> 00:34:35,556
"Nah, we're not interested in this one."

658
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:37,459
On the other hand, someone did choose you.

659
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,132
It's having no control.

660
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:47,969
You find out you were out of the loop

661
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:51,407
when the most crucial events
in your life were set in motion.

662
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,412
As long as you have control.

663
00:34:57,713 --> 00:35:00,216
I don't understand people who give it up.

664
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:05,018
What inspired Hertzfeld to make that bet?

665
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:09,324
He was warning me that being your
father figure could be dangerous.

666
00:35:09,325 --> 00:35:12,726
Keep your 100 bucks. I'm
sticking with the first verse.

667
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:13,560
Good.

668
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:15,996
- What the hell does he mean?
- Nothing.

669
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm proud of you.

670
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:22,402
Thank you, boss.

671
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:26,341
It's my pleasure to introduce
my friend and the CEO of Apple,

672
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:28,076
John Sculley.

673
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:29,743
John?

674
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:31,112
Yeah?

675
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:34,150
Lisa made a painting on the Mac.

676
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:41,054
<i>The Macintosh, Apple's near
mythological home computer,</i>

677
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,659
<i>has gotten off to a rocky start in
its battle with industry titan IBM.</i>

678
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,895
<i>With sales originally projected to
be a million in the first quarter,</i>

679
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,130
<i>Apple has sold only 35,000
of the user-friendly machines</i>

680
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:52,567
<i>in the months since it's
been available to customers.</i>

681
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,000
<i>The insistence by Steve Jobs</i>

682
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,735
<i>that it have what's
called end-to-end control,</i>

683
00:35:55,736 --> 00:36:00,375
<i>which is a way of saying that it's not compatible
with most outside hardware or software,</i>

684
00:36:00,376 --> 00:36:03,578
<i>is the Shakespearean flaw in a
machine that</i> had <i>potential.</i>

685
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,480
<i>Apple Computers closed
two of its factories today</i>

686
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:07,915
<i>in the wake of disappointing sales.</i>

687
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,152
<i>Do you know how many Macs
were sold last month? 500.</i>

688
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:14,054
<i>In a move that surprised some
but not all on Wall Street,</i>

689
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:16,656
<i>the board of directors of
Apple Computers voted today</i>

690
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:19,060
<i>to fire its cofounder Steve Jobs.</i>

691
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:21,094
<i>Did he jump or was he pushed?</i>

692
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,931
<i>His ex-boss, Apple CEO John
Sculley, refused to comment.</i>

693
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,933
<i>However, in an exclusive interview,</i>

694
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:31,038
<i>Steve Wozniak has slammed the
integrity of his old friend Steve Jobs.</i>

695
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,141
<i>He calls Jobs an
insulting and hurtful guy.</i>

696
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:37,677
<i>Jobs is hitting back with a
new company and a new computer.</i>

697
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:39,781
<i>Apple has a new competitor.</i>

698
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:42,482
<i>Steve Jobs's black cube is
aimed at the education market.</i>

699
00:36:42,483 --> 00:36:44,951
<i>Few people have the ability
to make the world wait,</i>

700
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:49,425
<i>but that is just what Jobs is
doing with his new company, NeXT.</i>

701
00:36:57,698 --> 00:36:59,600
<i>Focus seems kind of sharp.</i>

702
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:01,134
<i>On the slide?</i>

703
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,904
The floor. The pin spot.

704
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:04,938
I think we want a sharp focus.

705
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:08,442
Don't take it personally. Just
not a fan of the circus aesthetic.

706
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:12,446
All right, let's hold here. We're gonna
have to go up and refocus the instruments.

707
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,882
Just one. The 30 is fine.

708
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:18,118
While we're holding, there are
well-wishers in the VIP room.

709
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,821
And Woz is here.

710
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,656
Steve Wozniak. Yes. Thank you very much.

711
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,192
<i>And Andy Hertzfeld.</i>

712
00:37:24,193 --> 00:37:26,594
Andy Hertzfeld. Thank you.

713
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:29,496
<i>John Sculley is here too.</i>

714
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,466
It's nice that he's here.

715
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:33,801
Really? I don't think
it's very nice at all.

716
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:36,136
You have to see them. They
wanna pay their respects.

717
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:38,772
If they were respectful, we'd
all still be at Apple right now.

718
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,475
Look...

719
00:37:40,476 --> 00:37:42,576
If they really wished me well,
they'd keep to themselves.

720
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:45,112
- Can I tell you something?
- I don't think they do wish me well.

721
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:47,581
<i>But I'm all right with
that. I'm over Apple.</i>

722
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:49,817
I got over the Mac and Woz and Sculley,

723
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:51,752
the same way you get over
your high school sweetheart.

724
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:53,554
Build a new one.

725
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:55,755
- Can I tell you something?
- Yes.

726
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,558
You said you wouldn't compete with them,

727
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:00,862
but you designed a computer
specifically for the education market,

728
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,929
which they putatively own.

729
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,833
So, I think it's cool they're here.

730
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:09,036
They're suing me.

731
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,605
Still.

732
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:12,707
It was nice they came.

733
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:16,176
They're not being magnanimous.

734
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:18,179
They want it to look
like an amicable divorce.

735
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,047
History doesn't remember Joe
DiMaggio kindly for dumping Marilyn.

736
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,283
Steve?

737
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,920
What's your problem?

738
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:29,123
I don't know, but I'm sure
it can be traced back to you.

739
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:32,792
You know, I'm the one who
has to explain you to people.

740
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:35,830
$100,000 to Paul Rand for a corporate logo

741
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:38,632
when we didn't even know
what our company made.

742
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:42,069
A $650,000 mold for the cube,

743
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,172
because God forbid the
angles be 90.1 instead of 90.

744
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:48,208
I forbid the angles to
be 90.1 instead of 90.

745
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:50,777
That box could be on
display at the Guggenheim.

746
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:53,013
Don't give them reason to say to the press

747
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:54,949
you have a chip on your shoulder.

748
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,717
Will you do that for me?

749
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,319
I don't have a chip on my shoulder.

750
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,953
Okay, okay.

751
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:03,658
But don't give them a reason to say you do.

752
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:05,159
I don't.

753
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,228
- That's the right attitude.
- That's not an attitude.

754
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:09,696
They're gonna call me back in
a minute to look at the light.

755
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:11,866
- Get one out of the way.
- Fine!

756
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:15,335
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

757
00:39:15,336 --> 00:39:17,737
- One more thing.
- Sure.

758
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,040
No questions from the press after.

759
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:22,275
No... Why?

760
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,346
Until I have better
answers, no press avail.

761
00:39:25,347 --> 00:39:29,450
Somebody asks where I am, you just
saw me, and I'll be right back.

762
00:39:31,218 --> 00:39:32,688
Okay.

763
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,857
Who do you want first?

764
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:40,028
Bring me the face of Steve Wozniak.

765
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:51,739
Hang on.

766
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,174
- I thought you went to school.
- Hang on.

767
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:56,911
You were supposed to go to school
an hour ago. I thought you left.

768
00:39:56,912 --> 00:39:59,279
I didn't wake up my mom
on time this morning.

769
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,081
It's happened before too.

770
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:05,152
I wake up with the alarm and then
I get dressed and eat breakfast,

771
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,821
but sometimes I forget to see
what time it is after that.

772
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,690
- Why doesn't your mom just set her own alarm clock?
- It's one of my chores.

773
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:13,893
I don't understand what that has
to do with why you're still...

774
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:15,196
Where's your mother?

775
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:17,297
<i>She went to find a pay phone.</i>

776
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:19,199
An hour ago, she said...

777
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,034
You don't have to raise your hand.

778
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:23,804
- You said it was off by a little.
- It is.

779
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:25,806
- I just measured it.
- Joanna...

780
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:27,775
Exactly a foot on all four sides.

781
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:29,310
There are six sides.

782
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:31,411
But you're not supposed
to be here right now.

783
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:34,681
We know if four of the sides
are equal to each other,

784
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,085
the other two must be equal as well.

785
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,388
The top, bottom, right and left

786
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:42,757
are about a millimeter shorter
than the front and back.

787
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:44,257
They're not. I measured them.

788
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:46,793
Lisa, I'm kind of an expert in design.

789
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:49,897
And that's a 20-cent ruler. You think
there's a chance it could be off?

790
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:53,433
If I had another ruler, I would measure
this ruler, but I really doubt it's off.

791
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:57,337
- When your mother comes back, you have to go to school.
- Because it's a ruler!

792
00:40:57,338 --> 00:40:58,973
Why is it off?

793
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:00,308
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Yes.

794
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:02,877
Because sometimes it seems like
you just keep saying what you want

795
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,880
without listening.

796
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,154
I'm listening.

797
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:16,492
- Is there something you need?
- No.

798
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:21,094
Why isn't it a perfect cube?

799
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,731
- You've asked me before.
- I forget what it is.

800
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:26,567
It's an optical anomaly.

801
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,837
To the human eye, a perfect
cube doesn't look like a cube,

802
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:32,373
so we made it roughly a millimeter
shorter than a foot on two sides.

803
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:33,940
What's an anomaly?

804
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:35,810
You've asked me that before too.

805
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:38,412
I don't know why you keep doing that.

806
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:43,150
It's an exception. Something
that doesn't fit a pattern.

807
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:46,353
You have to go to school. Come in!

808
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:50,324
I think you two have met.

809
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:51,958
Hello, old friend.

810
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:55,029
- You look well.
- So do you. So do you.

811
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,998
And they're telling me George is
ready for you to look at the focus.

812
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,500
Take a walk with me.

813
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,103
- Is this Lisa?
- Yeah.

814
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:04,004
- This can't be Lisa.
- It is.

815
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,005
- Lisa's this big.
- They get taller. Come on.

816
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:07,908
- Do you remember me?
- She doesn't.

817
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:09,877
I'm your dad's friend Steve Wozniak.

818
00:42:09,878 --> 00:42:14,047
I apologize. I don't remember you.

819
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,415
You're very polite.

820
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:17,118
- Woz?
- Yeah.

821
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,953
Chrisann's at a pay
phone. Would you find her?

822
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,020
Yeah.

823
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:21,788
<i>Good turnout.</i>

824
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,223
- Great turnout.
- Yeah.

825
00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:26,159
- "Insanely great."
- Insanely great.

826
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,462
This is the first time we
haven't played for the same team.

827
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,031
It's like you're releasing
your first solo album.

828
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:33,967
I, uh... I appreciate your
inviting me to the launch.

829
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,469
I just want to wipe the slate clean.

830
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,105
That's exactly what I want.
That's why I came backstage.

831
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:40,841
I want you to know, um,
I'll be out there with you.

832
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:43,210
Any chance I can get you to
go out there instead of me?

833
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:45,011
I love you, Steve.

834
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:46,446
I love you too, Woz.

835
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:49,415
You know, some things were said.

836
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:51,384
They were. They were said in public.

837
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:54,455
They were published. Were
you pressured to do it?

838
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:56,322
Was I what?

839
00:42:56,323 --> 00:43:02,062
Check it out. It's the orchestra
pit for the San Francisco Opera.

840
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:04,330
Was I pressured to do it?

841
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,433
I once met Seiji Ozawa at Tanglewood.

842
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:09,870
A thunderous conductor.

843
00:43:09,871 --> 00:43:11,971
Ungodly artfulness and nuance.

844
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:16,543
And I asked him what exactly a
conductor does that a metronome can't.

845
00:43:16,544 --> 00:43:19,313
- Surprisingly, he...
- He didn't beat the living shit out of you?

846
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:23,917
That's right. No, he said, "The
musicians play their instruments.

847
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:25,819
I play the orchestra."

848
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,056
That feels like something that sounds
good, but doesn't mean anything.

849
00:43:29,057 --> 00:43:33,194
Markkula, Sculley... Did they ask
you to slag me off in the press?

850
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:35,228
I had reason to be angry.

851
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:36,964
- Did they?
- Absolutely not.

852
00:43:36,965 --> 00:43:38,399
But they asked you to talk.

853
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,201
Apple was under siege.
You'd just left the company.

854
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:41,935
Someone had to talk to the press.

855
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:45,371
I'm right here, Woz. The company left me.

856
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,042
I begged you. I begged you.

857
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,243
The Apple II accounted
for 70% of the revenue.

858
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:52,846
What did you think was gonna happen?

859
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:56,217
You didn't care enough about
the Apple II or the Lisa.

860
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:57,851
Let's be really clear.

861
00:43:57,852 --> 00:44:00,755
I didn't care at all about
the Apple II or the Lisa.

862
00:44:02,122 --> 00:44:04,357
I wasn't pressured to do it.

863
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:10,897
What I said to the press was an honest,
if tempered, reflection of what I believed.

864
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,933
- Woz.
- Yeah?

865
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:15,335
What the fuck is on your wrist?

866
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:18,505
- You wanna know?
- I literally can't wait.

867
00:44:18,506 --> 00:44:20,607
Everyone's gonna be
wearing these in 10 years.

868
00:44:20,608 --> 00:44:23,009
It's a Nixie watch, made using Nixie tubes.

869
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,379
This is actually
40-year-old technology.

870
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,315
Cold cathode tubes. They're
operating at 140 volts.

871
00:44:28,316 --> 00:44:30,317
I tilt my wrist 45
degrees, it's right there.

872
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:32,085
Hours, minutes and seconds.

873
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,520
The way our minds work. Look at that.

874
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:37,123
Do me a favor. Set the watch
ahead like you're on a plane

875
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:38,592
and just changed time zones.

876
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,360
Not a problem.

877
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:44,899
Unscrew that. Just hit the button.

878
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,435
Excuse me. Flight attendant? The man next
to me would appear to be detonating a bomb.

879
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,404
You think this looks like a bomb.

880
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:54,342
Even right now, I'm not 100% sure it isn't.

881
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,814
- I think maybe once people get used to it...
- No.

882
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:06,654
I was angry.

883
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:09,489
You were saying things about the Apple II,
and the way you were treating the team...

884
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:13,192
Woz. You get a free pass for life.

885
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:16,630
I got to get back onstage. We got
two minutes of rehearsal time left.

886
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:20,601
Do you understand how condescending
that just was? Maybe you don't.

887
00:45:20,602 --> 00:45:23,203
I don't want to see you get dragged
off an airplane in plastic handcuffs.

888
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:26,473
I get a free pass for life from you?

889
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,542
You give out the pass...
Y-Y-You give them to me?

890
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:31,344
You're gonna have a stroke, little buddy.

891
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:34,849
What did you do? What did you do?

892
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:38,252
Why has Lisa not heard of me?

893
00:45:38,253 --> 00:45:41,721
Shit, man, how many
fourth-graders have heard of you?

894
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:46,092
You can't write code. You're not
an engineer. You're not a designer.

895
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:48,328
You can't put a hammer to a nail.

896
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,964
I built the circuit board.

897
00:45:49,965 --> 00:45:52,433
The graphical interface
was stolen from Xerox PARC.

898
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:56,170
Jef Raskin was the leader of the Mac team
before you threw him off his own project.

899
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:59,373
Everything... Someone
else designed the box.

900
00:45:59,374 --> 00:46:01,308
So how come 10 times in a day,

901
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:05,112
I read "Steve Jobs is a genius"?

902
00:46:05,113 --> 00:46:06,980
What do you do?

903
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:08,649
I play the orchestra.

904
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,683
And you're a good musician.
You sit right there.

905
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,719
You're the best in your row.

906
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,054
I came here to clear the air.

907
00:46:15,055 --> 00:46:17,491
- Do you know why I came here?
- Didn't you just answer that?

908
00:46:17,492 --> 00:46:20,326
I came here because
you're gonna get killed.

909
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:23,330
Your computer's gonna fail.

910
00:46:23,331 --> 00:46:25,766
You had a college and
university advisory board

911
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:28,735
telling you they need a powerful
workstation for 2,000 to 3,000.

912
00:46:28,736 --> 00:46:31,005
You've priced NeXT at 6,500.

913
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:33,540
And that doesn't include the
optional $3,000 hard drive,

914
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,243
which people will discover isn't optional.

915
00:46:36,244 --> 00:46:39,279
Because the optical disk
is too weak to do anything.

916
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,417
And the $2,500 laser printer
brings the total to $12,000.

917
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:45,518
And in the entire world,
you are the only person

918
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:48,321
who cares that it's
housed in a perfect cube.

919
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:50,524
You're gonna get killed.

920
00:46:50,525 --> 00:46:53,159
And I came here to stand
next to you while that happens

921
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,161
because that's what friends do.

922
00:46:55,162 --> 00:47:00,034
That's what men do. I don't need your pass.

923
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:02,469
We go back, so don't talk
to me like I'm other people.

924
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,705
I'm the only one that knows

925
00:47:04,706 --> 00:47:07,708
that this guy here is someone you invented.

926
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:12,478
I'm standing by you because that
perfect cube that does nothing

927
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:15,181
is about to be the single biggest failure

928
00:47:15,182 --> 00:47:17,952
in the history of personal computing.

929
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,690
Tell me something else I don't know.

930
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:29,797
- Back onstage?
- We're out of time.

931
00:47:29,798 --> 00:47:33,500
They've got to mop the
stage and open the house.

932
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:37,203
If it crashes, it crashes, right?

933
00:47:37,204 --> 00:47:38,739
You'll make a joke.

934
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,339
I'll make a joke.

935
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,775
If it crashes, it crashes.

936
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,446
It's a good slogan. "NeXT.
If it crashes, it crashes."

937
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,614
I'm not just talking about the demo, Steve.

938
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,085
If it tanks, we don't swallow cyanide.

939
00:47:51,086 --> 00:47:53,853
- We go back to the drawing board.
- No more drawing boards.

940
00:47:53,854 --> 00:47:56,422
Invent the Edsel twice, you
don't get any more drawing boards.

941
00:47:56,423 --> 00:47:57,857
Tell me what the plan is.

942
00:47:57,858 --> 00:48:00,259
You have to tell me the
plan, because I don't know.

943
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,098
You're walking around like
you've got "Can't Lose" cards.

944
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:08,134
The plan will reveal itself to
you when you're ready to see it.

945
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,603
Will I have to drop acid?

946
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:12,172
Couldn't hurt.

947
00:48:12,173 --> 00:48:13,540
Is there a plan?

948
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,375
Have I ever let you down?

949
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:17,243
Every single goddamn time.

950
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:19,212
- Then I'm due.
- Is there?

951
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:21,214
Joanna, there's a plan.

952
00:48:21,215 --> 00:48:24,784
I just don't wanna put you in a
position where you're lying to people.

953
00:48:26,688 --> 00:48:30,190
Start 15 minutes late so Avie can
recompile and give us a fighting chance.

954
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:32,493
Jesus Christ. How many times
are we gonna have this con...

955
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:34,393
- We're not starting late, ever!
- Fine!

956
00:48:34,394 --> 00:48:37,498
- We're not ever starting late.
- Late.

957
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:41,069
But where do you come
down on starting late?

958
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:53,614
Lisa's been doing this thing where she
asks me about stuff I've already told her.

959
00:48:53,615 --> 00:48:56,283
She asks me questions, and I know
she already knows the answers.

960
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:57,717
What's that about?

961
00:48:57,718 --> 00:49:01,855
Kids do that when they're scared one
of their parents is in a bad mood.

962
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,424
They try to get you talking
about something you like.

963
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:10,696
It's very common and can be treated by
talking to her about things she likes.

964
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:15,234
Do you have any experience
or training in this field?

965
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:16,435
No.

966
00:49:16,436 --> 00:49:19,073
Tell them to open the house.

967
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:29,084
- Where's Lisa?
- She's around.

968
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,853
- What does that mean?
- She's running around the building.

969
00:49:33,854 --> 00:49:36,455
An hour ago, you said you
were taking her to school.

970
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:39,726
She begged me to let her stay. There
are fathers who would so love...

971
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:44,263
It is wrong, okay? It is morally
wrong, it's parentally wrong.

972
00:49:44,264 --> 00:49:47,500
It is wrong for you to use Lisa
as a way of getting money from me.

973
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:50,469
She will know, if she doesn't already,
that that is your primary use for her.

974
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,638
She will hate you for
the rest of your life.

975
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,442
She will see, if she doesn't already, that
her mother is a woman who stands up to men.

976
00:49:56,443 --> 00:49:58,277
By living off of them.

977
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:01,214
By not letting myself be
imprisoned and degraded by them.

978
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:06,652
Imprisoned? I can't get rid of you.

979
00:50:06,653 --> 00:50:09,422
I need a doctor and I need a dentist.

980
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,525
I dropped out of college after a
semester, but, okay, let's have a look.

981
00:50:12,526 --> 00:50:14,860
You will support your
daughter and her mother.

982
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:17,397
Did you pay someone
$1,500 to bless your house?

983
00:50:17,398 --> 00:50:19,799
- Did you hear what I said?
- Did you?

984
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,768
I don't remember how much it was, Steve.

985
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,471
- It was $1,500.
- Well, they don't do it for free.

986
00:50:24,472 --> 00:50:26,005
They don't. They charge $1,500.

987
00:50:26,006 --> 00:50:28,942
How I spend... Fuck. You
know, I'm not even gonna...

988
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:32,645
Were you about to say, "How I spend
my money is none of your business"?

989
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:35,915
I have a sinus infection and
I need to see a dentist too.

990
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:38,618
So you can see how your blessing
budget could have been better spent.

991
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,689
Like on a perfect cube?

992
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,259
- Look at me, Chrisann.
- What?

993
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,326
- You know who I am, right?
- Yes.

994
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:49,696
- And you know I know people.
- What are you talking about?

995
00:50:49,697 --> 00:50:53,533
Look at me. And you know the
people I know, they know people.

996
00:50:53,534 --> 00:50:54,935
What is this?

997
00:50:54,936 --> 00:50:58,571
If I ever hear again that you've
thrown a cereal bowl at Lisa's head...

998
00:50:58,572 --> 00:51:00,774
- What?
- my private line's gonna ring,

999
00:51:00,775 --> 00:51:03,743
and a voice on the other end
is gonna say, "We're all set."

1000
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:06,013
- That's how I'll learn that you're dead.
- Are you cra...

1001
00:51:06,014 --> 00:51:08,281
I threw the bowl on the floor.

1002
00:51:08,282 --> 00:51:09,815
I didn't throw it at her head.

1003
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,618
She wasn't even in the room.

1004
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:14,554
She was nowhere... I threw
the bowl on the floor.

1005
00:51:14,555 --> 00:51:17,658
She's a little girl. You're scaring her.

1006
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:20,359
I'm a grown man. You're scaring me.

1007
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,562
Taking out the garbage is a chore.

1008
00:51:22,563 --> 00:51:24,630
Clearing the table is a chore.

1009
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:27,301
Waking you up in the morning
is just fucking creepy.

1010
00:51:27,302 --> 00:51:30,304
- Please teach me more about being a parent.
- We're all done here.

1011
00:51:30,305 --> 00:51:33,607
It means so much coming from
someone who won't admit he is one.

1012
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:35,609
- Stop screaming at Lisa.
- I give her responsibilities.

1013
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,743
- Got it.
- One day she's gonna thank me for it.

1014
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:39,712
- Probably in your sleep.
- Fuck off!

1015
00:51:39,713 --> 00:51:40,681
Okay.

1016
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:43,482
I never... I never threw
anything at her head.

1017
00:51:43,483 --> 00:51:45,886
Steve.

1018
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:48,721
I never would.

1019
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:53,227
Things don't become so because you say so.

1020
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:58,065
There'll be more money in your
account by the end of business.

1021
00:52:06,474 --> 00:52:09,144
- Were you being nice?
- Oh, yeah.

1022
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:18,484
- Andy's next.
- Hertzfeld or Cunningham?

1023
00:52:18,485 --> 00:52:23,190
Hertzfeld. He's playing with Avie
Tevanian on the computer backstage.

1024
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:29,264
Ladies and gentlemen,
the house is now open.

1025
00:52:43,778 --> 00:52:48,013
- ...playing in front of thousands of people.
- Steve!

1026
00:52:48,014 --> 00:52:50,917
Can he do it later, Joel?
We go in eight minutes.

1027
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,552
- Can I get a quick reaction to the press this morning?
- What about it?

1028
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:56,056
- The size of it, the volume.
- I'll tell you on background...

1029
00:52:56,057 --> 00:52:58,458
- I was hoping for a quote from Steve.
- I'll tell you on background

1030
00:52:58,459 --> 00:53:01,060
that I've never seen anything
like it in the tech industry.

1031
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:04,063
I called the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
to take out a full-page ad for today,

1032
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:06,400
and do you know what their sales guy said?

1033
00:53:06,401 --> 00:53:10,804
"Why bother? It'd be like notifying
Macy's that tomorrow is Christmas."

1034
00:53:10,805 --> 00:53:12,873
- You saw the Stewart Alsop newsletter?
- I did.

1035
00:53:12,874 --> 00:53:15,107
I'm sorry, Joanna, I need
to get Steve on the record.

1036
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:19,612
The headline was "Dear NeXT,
when can I get my machine?"

1037
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:23,683
- When can he?
- We'll announce the ship date in the next eight to 10 weeks.

1038
00:53:23,684 --> 00:53:25,085
Alsop's not talking about the ship date.

1039
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:27,754
He wants to know when he
can get one to play with.

1040
00:53:27,755 --> 00:53:29,855
We have a lot of respect for Stewart Alsop,

1041
00:53:29,856 --> 00:53:33,692
and we want to get a machine into his hands
so he can tell his subscribers about it.

1042
00:53:33,693 --> 00:53:36,429
- And when will that be?
- Very soon.

1043
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,098
Couple of days? A week?

1044
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:41,801
Off the record.

1045
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,170
- Off the record?
- Completely.

1046
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:47,507
- We think...
- He'll get it when it's finished.

1047
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:49,109
It's not finished?

1048
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,411
It's almost finished.

1049
00:53:50,412 --> 00:53:53,513
- I've been watching you rehearse the demo for three weeks.
- Yeah.

1050
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:54,947
- What's left?
- A little thing.

1051
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:56,415
- What?
- I think that's enough.

1052
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:59,786
We're off the record, and Joel's always
been good at understanding nuance.

1053
00:53:59,787 --> 00:54:02,022
What's left to finish?

1054
00:54:02,023 --> 00:54:06,260
I guess, in layman's terms, you'd
have to say we don't have an OS.

1055
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:11,499
- An operating system?
- Yeah.

1056
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:16,536
- What do you mean?
- Well, the OS is what runs the computer.

1057
00:54:16,537 --> 00:54:18,471
In fact, it sort of is the computer.

1058
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:20,774
How has it been running? How's
it gonna run this morning?

1059
00:54:20,775 --> 00:54:23,143
What do you mean, you don't have an OS?

1060
00:54:23,144 --> 00:54:26,679
It's like this. Avie Tevanian
is our chief software designer,

1061
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,947
and he wrote a demo program.

1062
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:31,484
It's like we built a great car,
but we haven't built the engine.

1063
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:34,154
So we put a golf cart battery
in there to make it go for a bit.

1064
00:54:34,155 --> 00:54:37,022
All this computer knows how to do
right now is demonstrate itself.

1065
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:39,525
You're telling me the only thing
you've built is a black cube?

1066
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,495
Yes. Yeah.

1067
00:54:41,496 --> 00:54:43,663
But isn't it the coolest
black cube you've ever seen?

1068
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:45,165
Is this... We're off the record.

1069
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:47,734
Is this a strategy or a
problem? If it's a problem...

1070
00:54:47,735 --> 00:54:51,737
Do not share proprietary
knowledge with that man.

1071
00:54:51,738 --> 00:54:53,906
It's not a problem.

1072
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:55,674
I wouldn't understand it anyway.

1073
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:58,612
I don't understand it either,
and my name's on the patents.

1074
00:54:58,613 --> 00:55:01,882
- It's got e-mail.
- Well, e-mail's not just for tech specialists anymore.

1075
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:03,583
Well, it is, but it won't be.

1076
00:55:03,584 --> 00:55:08,522
And I assume an e-mail sent on a NeXT computer
can only be received by a NeXT computer?

1077
00:55:08,523 --> 00:55:10,524
Closed,
end-to-end.

1078
00:55:10,525 --> 00:55:11,991
The new trash can is wrong.

1079
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:14,293
I wanna tell you I appreciate
all the hours you put into it,

1080
00:55:14,294 --> 00:55:17,531
but I can't because of how terrible it is.

1081
00:55:17,532 --> 00:55:18,964
Go back to the other one.

1082
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:21,567
Why are we still giving
three options on the clock?

1083
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,871
- How many options do you want to give?
- Two. Buy it or don't.

1084
00:55:24,872 --> 00:55:26,540
Can I talk to you for a second?

1085
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:27,674
Abso-fruitly.

1086
00:55:27,675 --> 00:55:29,808
Uh, look, man. Avie's been recompiling,

1087
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:32,112
but he says there may be
some glitches this morning.

1088
00:55:32,113 --> 00:55:34,114
If all there are are some glitches,

1089
00:55:34,115 --> 00:55:36,815
it'll be a triumph of miraculous magnitude.

1090
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:38,884
Why are you translating for Avie?

1091
00:55:38,885 --> 00:55:42,922
I-I didn't want him to find out the hard
way your position on glitches in a demo,

1092
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,958
but it sounds like you've mellowed.

1093
00:55:44,959 --> 00:55:47,960
I've been growing, Andy. I've
been learning to love myself.

1094
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:50,230
Hmm. I wouldn't have ever
dreamed that was a problem.

1095
00:55:50,231 --> 00:55:51,830
Fantastic burn.

1096
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:53,667
You need to go to your seat.

1097
00:55:53,668 --> 00:55:56,268
How about Lisa, getting into
a school for gifted kids?

1098
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,904
Yeah, she was tested and
it turns out she can fly.

1099
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:01,040
- Seriously, it's a big deal.
- I know it's a big deal.

1100
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:03,576
That's why I built the school a building.

1101
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:06,880
- Well, I'm sure that's not why she got in.
- Really?

1102
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:10,485
Uh, can I show you something
funny from <i>Macworld?</i>

1103
00:56:13,753 --> 00:56:17,790
- I can't think of anything I have to do right now.
- It'll make you feel good.

1104
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,793
- Joanna! Look at this!
- Oh, Andy, he's only got a couple of minutes.

1105
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,362
It's Guy Kawasaki writing in
<i>Macworld.</i> You're gonna like this.

1106
00:56:23,363 --> 00:56:25,364
Well, can we all enjoy it later?

1107
00:56:25,365 --> 00:56:30,235
He wrote a parody press release
about Apple buying NeXT for your OS.

1108
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:34,139
He imagines a near future where Apple
needs your OS and has to buy NeXT,

1109
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,842
and-and you come back as CEO.

1110
00:56:36,843 --> 00:56:38,310
He has Gates saying,

1111
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:43,284
"There would now be more innovations
from Jobs that Microsoft could copy."

1112
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:48,989
- You can read it later.
- Thanks.

1113
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,625
She would've gotten in without
you donating a building.

1114
00:56:51,626 --> 00:56:55,329
Still, it's something to
talk about in the interview.

1115
00:56:57,764 --> 00:57:00,266
All right. Good luck.

1116
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:02,403
Thanks.

1117
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,038
Give that to me. I'll throw it out for you.

1118
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:09,708
I'm gonna hang on to it.

1119
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:11,277
What?

1120
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:13,813
What?

1121
00:57:13,814 --> 00:57:15,848
You ready for Sculley?

1122
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,784
Excuse me!

1123
00:57:17,785 --> 00:57:19,685
Lisa!

1124
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,588
You can't shout!

1125
00:57:28,796 --> 00:57:30,698
Lisa?

1126
00:57:39,907 --> 00:57:42,477
You have to go.

1127
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:47,381
It's dangerous up here. That's
why I make other people do it.

1128
00:57:49,115 --> 00:57:51,451
Who are you hiding from, me or your mom?

1129
00:57:51,452 --> 00:57:55,121
I'm not hiding.

1130
00:57:55,122 --> 00:57:57,592
Let's go.

1131
00:58:04,764 --> 00:58:07,299
What were you listening to?

1132
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,870
I'm listening to two
versions of the same song.

1133
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:14,339
Then when I get to the ends, I
rewind to listen to them again.

1134
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,844
It's the same song, but
the versions are different.

1135
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:20,380
- What's the song?
- Okay.

1136
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:23,415
So it's a really old song, and
it's called "Both Sides, Now."

1137
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,821
- "Both Sides, Now"?
- Yeah.

1138
00:58:27,822 --> 00:58:29,888
What's it about?

1139
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:34,293
It's about... There are three
verses: Clouds, love and life.

1140
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:38,998
And the person singing is singing
that they used to think of...

1141
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:40,866
That they used to think about...

1142
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:43,168
- Clouds, love and life?
- Right.

1143
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:47,040
One way, yeah, but now they look
at them another way, and they...

1144
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:52,911
They've come to the conclusion that they
really don't know clouds, love or life at all.

1145
00:58:52,912 --> 00:58:55,415
Those are the exact words.

1146
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:56,683
Yeah, Joni Mitchell.

1147
00:58:56,684 --> 00:59:00,955
'Cause it's not a really old
song, unless I'm a really old guy.

1148
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:04,324
You have to go to school now.

1149
00:59:04,325 --> 00:59:07,527
Do you want me to tell you the
differences between the two versions?

1150
00:59:07,528 --> 00:59:08,862
Right now.

1151
00:59:08,863 --> 00:59:12,431
The first version is the kind of
thing that you would call girlish.

1152
00:59:12,432 --> 00:59:14,933
I didn't mean I want to know
the difference right now.

1153
00:59:14,934 --> 00:59:17,402
I meant you have to go to school right now.

1154
00:59:17,403 --> 00:59:19,105
I can stay and watch.

1155
00:59:19,106 --> 00:59:21,373
You are truant. You're committing a crime.

1156
00:59:21,374 --> 00:59:23,976
I'm not gonna miss anything important.

1157
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,880
- How do you know?
- I read ahead.

1158
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:30,083
The Pilgrims make it to the New World.

1159
00:59:30,084 --> 00:59:31,984
Then the Declaration of Independence.

1160
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,020
Yeah, you skipped a couple centuries.

1161
00:59:34,021 --> 00:59:36,922
Steve? Chrisann's out there.

1162
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:45,330
Let's go.

1163
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,266
Can I make my case for staying?

1164
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:49,236
Nope.

1165
01:00:07,822 --> 01:00:10,889
- She was with me.
- Come on. Your dad doesn't want us to stay.

1166
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:13,960
That's not true. That's not...

1167
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:16,328
You have to be in school is all.

1168
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:19,998
I'm committing a crime right now,
and I don't wanna get in trouble.

1169
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:22,569
You're not in trouble. I was kidding.

1170
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:24,103
Okay.

1171
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:26,605
Hey. What was the second version?

1172
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:29,843
You said the first version was
girlish. What was the second version?

1173
01:00:31,278 --> 01:00:33,045
I can't really think of the word.

1174
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,848
Okay. Well, have a good day at school.

1175
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:37,217
- Regretful.
- What?

1176
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:40,118
Like wishing you could go
back and do things different.

1177
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,388
You're too young to be regretful.

1178
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,891
Not me.

1179
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:47,627
The person singing the song.

1180
01:00:47,628 --> 01:00:51,499
Got it. Regretful. That
makes sense because...

1181
01:00:54,034 --> 01:00:56,537
I wanna live with you.

1182
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:11,150
Six minutes.

1183
01:01:11,151 --> 01:01:13,754
- You want to see Sculley?
- No.

1184
01:01:22,528 --> 01:01:25,931
You know all those times I
told you you needed security?

1185
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,535
Here's why.

1186
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:36,442
I don't know how it is I've
gotten older and you haven't.

1187
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,478
Some deal with the devil
I was never offered.

1188
01:01:39,479 --> 01:01:42,047
So you know what I've been
thinking for the last four years?

1189
01:01:42,048 --> 01:01:45,685
As it turns out, John, I've never
known what you were thinking.

1190
01:01:45,686 --> 01:01:48,453
No newborn baby has control.

1191
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,389
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1192
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:52,592
In '84, before the Mac launch. You said...

1193
01:01:52,593 --> 01:01:56,161
- Yeah.
- You said that being adopted meant you didn't have control.

1194
01:01:56,162 --> 01:01:57,496
We're starting in a minute, so...

1195
01:01:57,497 --> 01:01:59,998
Why do people think I fired you?

1196
01:01:59,999 --> 01:02:02,102
It's fine, John. It's all behind us.

1197
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,107
Is it? Hmm?

1198
01:02:08,108 --> 01:02:10,745
Don't play stupid. You can't pull it off.

1199
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,949
You came here to ask me why
people think you fired me?

1200
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,985
Why do people think I fired you?

1201
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:21,856
Just confirm something for me, okay?

1202
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,024
You liked the ad, right?

1203
01:02:25,025 --> 01:02:26,692
The commercial... "1984." You liked it.

1204
01:02:26,693 --> 01:02:30,029
- When are you gonna get furniture?
- It's not an easy process.

1205
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,130
It is. You buy a couch, take it from there.

1206
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:35,634
I'd be really surprised if you came
here to talk about interior decorating.

1207
01:02:35,635 --> 01:02:37,069
I liked the ad very much.

1208
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:38,170
- You did?
- You know I did.

1209
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,440
You're a lying son of a
bitch. You tried to kill it.

1210
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:43,342
- It's time to take a hard look at the Mac.
- It's past time.

1211
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:47,513
It's overpriced. We
need to drop it to 1,995.

1212
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,449
We need to double the marketing budget,

1213
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:51,284
put more bodies on an internal hard drive

1214
01:02:51,285 --> 01:02:52,652
and invest in FileServer.

1215
01:02:52,653 --> 01:02:55,321
- Where the hell did you get the idea I tried to kill...
- Lee Clow.

1216
01:02:55,322 --> 01:02:57,089
- Lee's wrong.
- He's lying?

1217
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:59,257
- He's... mistaken.
- Where would the money come from?

1218
01:02:59,258 --> 01:03:01,460
It would come from finally
getting rid of the Apple II.

1219
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:03,362
The Apple II is the
only thing making money.

1220
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:06,466
- You agreed with the board.
- I understood the board's concerns, but I...

1221
01:03:06,467 --> 01:03:08,534
The board's concerns that
we didn't show the product?

1222
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,536
- Among other things, but my question was...
- What other things?

1223
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:13,672
I'm asking because I'm curious.
You said "among other things."

1224
01:03:13,673 --> 01:03:16,442
Among other things, it was
set in a dystopian galaxy.

1225
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:18,411
It took place on a planet
where we don't live.

1226
01:03:18,412 --> 01:03:20,446
It was dark and the opposite of our brand.

1227
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:22,681
<i>And</i> we didn't show the product.

1228
01:03:22,682 --> 01:03:26,451
People talked about the ad but most of
them didn't know what we were selling.

1229
01:03:26,452 --> 01:03:28,487
The Mac needs to sell for 1,995.

1230
01:03:28,488 --> 01:03:32,525
There is no market research telling us
the Mac is failing because it's overpriced.

1231
01:03:32,526 --> 01:03:36,429
It's telling us that people don't like it
because they think it doesn't do anything.

1232
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,764
It's closed,
end-to-end.

1233
01:03:38,765 --> 01:03:41,433
We didn't know it wasn't what
people wanted, but it isn't.

1234
01:03:41,434 --> 01:03:43,502
They want slots, they want
choices, they want options.

1235
01:03:43,503 --> 01:03:45,804
The way we buy stereos...
mix and match components.

1236
01:03:45,805 --> 01:03:48,473
John, listen to me. Whoever
said the customer is always right

1237
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:50,243
was, I promise you, a customer.

1238
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,444
- It had skinheads in it.
- She was liberating them.

1239
01:03:52,445 --> 01:03:55,580
- Liberating the skinheads.
- The ad didn't have anything to do with fucking skinheads.

1240
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,350
We used them as fucking extras.

1241
01:03:57,351 --> 01:03:58,717
Nobody even knows they were skinheads.

1242
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:01,187
I'm just saying the board had concerns...

1243
01:04:01,188 --> 01:04:03,089
You invented lifestyle advertising.

1244
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,824
And our brand was my brand.

1245
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:07,627
My job is to make a
recommendation to the board.

1246
01:04:07,628 --> 01:04:08,995
We showed a lot of happy
people drinking Pepsi.

1247
01:04:08,996 --> 01:04:12,498
We didn't say the world was going
to end if you bought a Dr. Pepper.

1248
01:04:12,499 --> 01:04:15,268
Recommend that we drop the price
and double the marketing budget.

1249
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:17,770
- I can't.
- <i>And</i> we showed the product.

1250
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:21,473
We showed it being opened, we showed
it being poured, being consumed.

1251
01:04:21,474 --> 01:04:23,643
What are you gonna do,
recommend that we kill the Mac?

1252
01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:26,046
I already have, Steve.

1253
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:30,149
What? When?

1254
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,717
You think the secret to your success

1255
01:04:31,718 --> 01:04:34,087
was not assuming people knew
what to do with a can of soda?

1256
01:04:34,088 --> 01:04:37,489
I didn't kill the ad, Steve! I'm the
only reason it made it on the air.

1257
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:39,659
Just now. An hour ago.

1258
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,359
I'm coming from Markkula's house.

1259
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,362
What did he say?

1260
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:46,466
- What did he say?
- Invent something new.

1261
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:48,301
I'll give you a team. You can sit in Maui.

1262
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,603
The resorts come with couches.

1263
01:04:49,604 --> 01:04:54,806
Wait a minute. Are you saying you
recommended terminating the Mac

1264
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,775
or you recommended taking
me off the Mac team?

1265
01:04:56,776 --> 01:04:59,812
We bought three spots in the
Super Bowl. Two 30's and a 60.

1266
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,681
After we screened it, the
board wanted that money back

1267
01:05:01,682 --> 01:05:03,616
and they asked me to sell off the spots.

1268
01:05:03,617 --> 01:05:06,118
Chiat/Day sold off the
two 30's but not the 60,

1269
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:07,552
and I let it be known to Lee Clow

1270
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:09,788
that if he didn't try very
hard to sell the last spot,

1271
01:05:09,789 --> 01:05:11,424
I wouldn't be unhappy.

1272
01:05:11,425 --> 01:05:13,493
If we drop the price
and double the budget...

1273
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:15,228
Drop the price or double the budget.

1274
01:05:15,229 --> 01:05:17,763
The only way to do that is to
take money out of the Apple II.

1275
01:05:17,764 --> 01:05:20,533
The Apple II should embarrass
you. It embarrasses me.

1276
01:05:20,534 --> 01:05:22,400
It doesn't embarrass the shareholders.

1277
01:05:22,401 --> 01:05:23,768
I don't give a shit about the shareholders.

1278
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:26,371
That's why I hired you, so I don't
have to hear about shareholders.

1279
01:05:26,372 --> 01:05:29,808
The shareholders are my problem, and
the board represents the shareholders.

1280
01:05:29,809 --> 01:05:31,676
That's how it works.

1281
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,279
You sure it wasn't Lee Clow who
dragged his feet selling the 60?

1282
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,716
At my direction, Steve.

1283
01:05:36,717 --> 01:05:39,585
You think he would have done that
on his own, taken it on himself?

1284
01:05:39,586 --> 01:05:42,288
Yeah. I think he would've done
what it took to save it from you.

1285
01:05:42,289 --> 01:05:44,824
- I was the only thing protecting it.
- You didn't want the ad

1286
01:05:44,825 --> 01:05:47,859
because you were trying to kill the
Mac two months before it launched.

1287
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,063
You are fucking delusional.

1288
01:05:52,832 --> 01:05:54,699
- Can I mention something to you?
- Sure.

1289
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,271
I have no earthly idea why you're here.

1290
01:05:58,838 --> 01:06:02,174
The story of why and how you left Apple,

1291
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:04,911
which is quickly becoming
mythologized, isn't true.

1292
01:06:04,912 --> 01:06:07,413
- I'm gonna take this to the board myself.
- Don't do that.

1293
01:06:07,414 --> 01:06:09,181
- I <i>am</i> doing that.
- You can't.

1294
01:06:09,182 --> 01:06:11,817
Why?

1295
01:06:11,818 --> 01:06:15,122
They believe you're no longer
necessary to this company.

1296
01:06:19,425 --> 01:06:24,563
I get hate mail, death threats.

1297
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:28,201
I get death threats.

1298
01:06:28,202 --> 01:06:32,072
My kids are getting taunted.
Why do people think I fired you?

1299
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,942
Joanna's gonna call my name in a second.

1300
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:37,810
- Steve?
- That was unrehearsed.

1301
01:06:37,811 --> 01:06:39,511
Yeah, I'll be there in just a second.

1302
01:06:39,512 --> 01:06:41,746
I gave you your day in court.

1303
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,348
- You gave me?
- I gave the board a clear choice.

1304
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:46,953
I said, "Do you want to invest in the Apple
II or the Mac?" They chose the Apple II.

1305
01:06:46,954 --> 01:06:49,288
The same people who wanted
to dump the Super Bowl spot.

1306
01:06:49,289 --> 01:06:51,358
And then I got on a plane to China.

1307
01:06:52,892 --> 01:06:55,427
Mr. Sculley. There's a
call for you on Line One.

1308
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:58,697
Or I almost got on a plane,
because I got a call in the lounge.

1309
01:06:58,698 --> 01:07:00,433
- Who made that call?
- Doesn't matter.

1310
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:01,967
<i>It matters to me. Who made the call?</i>

1311
01:07:01,968 --> 01:07:03,168
John Sculley.

1312
01:07:03,169 --> 01:07:05,004
<i>John? If you get on that plane,</i>

1313
01:07:05,005 --> 01:07:07,906
<i>you'll have lost your
job by the time it lands.</i>

1314
01:07:07,907 --> 01:07:11,509
<i>Steve's been calling the
board. He wants you out.</i>

1315
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:14,513
<i>I left my bags on the plane. My
shit's still somewhere in Beijing.</i>

1316
01:07:14,514 --> 01:07:17,549
I took a car back to Cupertino in
the middle of the fucking night.

1317
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:22,355
I know what time it is. I need a quorum
here in one hour and I want Steve here too.

1318
01:07:22,356 --> 01:07:24,857
<i>You took me off the Mac,
and it was bad business.</i>

1319
01:07:24,858 --> 01:07:27,726
- The quorum call was a homicide.
- Right there! Right there.

1320
01:07:27,727 --> 01:07:29,462
That's the part that's bullshit, my friend.

1321
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:30,929
It was a suicide.

1322
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:33,665
Because you knew your
cards and I showed you mine.

1323
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:36,534
I showed you mine, and you did it anyway.

1324
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:37,937
What did you think I was gonna do?

1325
01:07:37,938 --> 01:07:40,605
I'm okay losing, but I'm not gonna forfeit.

1326
01:07:40,606 --> 01:07:43,308
I'm not okay losing.

1327
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,745
<i>We're losing market share,
and the Mac is losing money.</i>

1328
01:07:45,746 --> 01:07:50,949
Our only hope is the Apple II, which is
stagnating because of its soon-to-be-obsolete DOS.

1329
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:54,386
Users are already rigging their machines
to run with a CP/M operating system

1330
01:07:54,387 --> 01:07:55,755
that's been built to run on Intel.

1331
01:07:55,756 --> 01:07:57,857
I can't put it more simply than this.

1332
01:07:57,858 --> 01:08:00,859
We need to put our resources
into updating the Apple II.

1333
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:03,562
<i>By taking resources from the Mac.</i>

1334
01:08:03,563 --> 01:08:04,964
<i>It's failing. That's a fact.</i>

1335
01:08:04,965 --> 01:08:06,998
- It's overpriced.
- There's no evidence that it's...

1336
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,900
I'm the evidence!

1337
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:12,772
I'm the world's leading expert on
the Mac, John. What's your résumé?

1338
01:08:12,773 --> 01:08:14,706
You're issuing contradictory instructions,

1339
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:16,709
you're insubordinate,
you make people miserable.

1340
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,844
Our top engineers are
fleeing to Sun, Dell, HP.

1341
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,981
<i>Wall Street doesn't know
who's driving the bus.</i>

1342
01:08:21,982 --> 01:08:24,049
We've lost hundreds of millions in value.

1343
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:27,686
And I'm the CEO of Apple,
Steve. That's my résumé.

1344
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,522
But before that, you sold
carbonated sugar water, right?

1345
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:34,427
I sat in a fucking garage with
Wozniak and invented the future.

1346
01:08:34,428 --> 01:08:37,862
Because artists lead and
hacks ask for a show of hands.

1347
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:38,864
All right.

1348
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,865
Well, this guy's out of control.

1349
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:43,602
I'm perfectly willing to hand
in my resignation tonight,

1350
01:08:43,603 --> 01:08:45,538
but if you want me to
stay, you can't have Steve.

1351
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:47,740
Settle him out.

1352
01:08:47,741 --> 01:08:50,843
He can keep a share of stock
so he gets our newsletter.

1353
01:08:50,844 --> 01:08:53,478
<i>He'll have to sever his
connection to Apple.</i>

1354
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:57,384
I'm dead serious. I want the
secretary to call for a vote.

1355
01:08:58,985 --> 01:09:02,088
I fucking dare you.

1356
01:09:02,089 --> 01:09:07,759
You have done an outstanding job over
the years of cultivating the press.

1357
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,294
And by that, I mean manipulating them.

1358
01:09:09,295 --> 01:09:12,932
Because none of them, none of their
editors, none of their editors' publishers

1359
01:09:12,933 --> 01:09:15,066
to this day know that you forced it,

1360
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,035
<i>that you forced the board.</i>

1361
01:09:17,036 --> 01:09:19,371
<i>Even after I told you
exactly what they'd do,</i>

1362
01:09:19,372 --> 01:09:21,473
which is exactly what they did.

1363
01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:23,875
Unanimously.

1364
01:09:23,876 --> 01:09:26,579
I don't have any trouble
remembering that, John,

1365
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,048
because of it being the
worst night of my life.

1366
01:09:30,049 --> 01:09:33,151
And I forced the vote because
I believed I was right.

1367
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:36,289
I still believe I'm right. And I'm right.

1368
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:39,525
Now I bled that night.

1369
01:09:39,526 --> 01:09:41,694
<i>And I don't bleed.</i>

1370
01:09:41,695 --> 01:09:43,396
<i>But time's done its thing,</i>

1371
01:09:43,397 --> 01:09:45,998
<i>and I really haven't
thought about it in a while.</i>

1372
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:50,669
Now, I absolutely
understand why you're upset.

1373
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,737
<i>And I want people to
know the truth too.</i>

1374
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:54,839
It's time.

1375
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,741
Got it.

1376
01:09:56,742 --> 01:09:58,843
You're gonna end me, aren't you?

1377
01:09:58,844 --> 01:10:01,112
You're being ridiculous.

1378
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:04,482
I'm gonna sit center court
and watch you do it yourself.

1379
01:10:04,483 --> 01:10:08,119
Then I'm gonna order a nice meal with
a '55 Margaux and sign some autographs.

1380
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,856
- Jesus Christ.
- You want some advice, Pepsi Generation?

1381
01:10:10,857 --> 01:10:13,592
Don't send Woz out to slap
me around in the press.

1382
01:10:13,593 --> 01:10:16,195
Anybody else... you, Markkula, Arthur Rock.

1383
01:10:16,196 --> 01:10:17,896
Anyone but Rain Man.

1384
01:10:17,897 --> 01:10:20,432
Don't manipulate him like that.

1385
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:24,102
Whatever you may think, I'm
always gonna protect him.

1386
01:10:24,103 --> 01:10:26,205
Come on, Steve.

1387
01:10:27,573 --> 01:10:30,176
That's what men do.

1388
01:10:30,177 --> 01:10:32,512
We can't start late.

1389
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,494
I don't think there was any way
to detect a chip on my shoulder.

1390
01:10:48,795 --> 01:10:50,295
Did you know, back at Bandley,

1391
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:54,600
the Mac team gave an award every year
to the person who could stand up to you?

1392
01:10:54,601 --> 01:10:55,734
No.

1393
01:10:55,735 --> 01:11:00,573
- I won. Three years in a row.
- Cool.

1394
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,811
This.

1395
01:11:05,812 --> 01:11:09,882
This... This Guy Kawasaki
in <i>Macworld.</i>

1396
01:11:09,883 --> 01:11:12,651
He accidentally got it right, didn't he?

1397
01:11:12,652 --> 01:11:14,219
You've been dragging
your feet on the NeXT OS

1398
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,623
till you can figure out
what Apple's gonna need.

1399
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:22,828
Even if that were true, it doesn't
sound that diabolical to me.

1400
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:24,530
Hey. We're ready for you.

1401
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,543
I'm your closest confidante,
your... your best friend.

1402
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:40,713
Your thing... What do you call it?

1403
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:42,882
Your work wife. The whole time.

1404
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:44,883
The last three years.

1405
01:11:48,921 --> 01:11:54,660
When did you change your mind and start
building the Steve Jobs Revenge Machine?

1406
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,697
House to half.

1407
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:02,302
You remember Skylab?

1408
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:09,941
It was an unmanned satellite NASA sent up in
the early '70s on a data gathering mission.

1409
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:12,611
The thing is, when they sent it up,

1410
01:12:12,612 --> 01:12:15,146
they didn't know yet how
they were gonna get it back.

1411
01:12:15,147 --> 01:12:17,182
But they felt like they were close enough

1412
01:12:17,183 --> 01:12:20,619
<i>that in the eight years it was gonna
be up there, they'd figure it out.</i>

1413
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,087
They're on their way now.

1414
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,822
They didn't.

1415
01:12:24,823 --> 01:12:26,892
So after eight years, it came crashing down

1416
01:12:26,893 --> 01:12:29,561
in a thousand-mile swath
across the Indian Ocean.

1417
01:12:29,562 --> 01:12:31,996
<i>A little to the left,
a little to the right,</i>

1418
01:12:31,997 --> 01:12:33,966
<i>somebody could have gotten hurt.</i>

1419
01:12:33,967 --> 01:12:38,102
I really wanted to build
a computer for colleges.

1420
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,705
The technology just didn't catch
up as fast as I needed it to.

1421
01:12:40,706 --> 01:12:42,975
<i>You know we're out of money.</i>

1422
01:12:42,976 --> 01:12:45,276
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the program
will be starting momentarily.</i>

1423
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:48,580
<i>But then Apple stopped innovating,
and I saw something better.</i>

1424
01:12:48,581 --> 01:12:53,718
Joanna, I know schools aren't gonna buy
a $13,000 dictionary with good speakers.

1425
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:55,755
You know I know that.

1426
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:59,258
But Apple will.

1427
01:12:59,259 --> 01:13:02,828
'Cause Avie Tevanian is gonna
build them exactly the OS they need.

1428
01:13:02,829 --> 01:13:05,731
<i>They're gonna have to buy me too.</i>

1429
01:13:05,732 --> 01:13:11,671
For half a billion dollars in stock
and end-to-end control on every product.

1430
01:13:42,402 --> 01:13:46,372
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...

1431
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:53,277
<i>More than a year after it was first
unveiled to industry insiders,</i>

1432
01:13:53,278 --> 01:13:56,014
<i>the NeXT Computer is
finally available in stores.</i>

1433
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:59,752
<i>And it appears to be two
strikes in a row for Steve Jobs.</i>

1434
01:13:59,753 --> 01:14:01,186
<i>Students and educators</i>

1435
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:04,289
<i>are finding it difficult to
justify the machine's high cost.</i>

1436
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:06,191
<i>So much for the black cube.</i>

1437
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:11,129
<i>NeXT just sold its factory to Canon
and laid off half its employees.</i>

1438
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:14,165
In the world of computers,
it's kill or be killed.

1439
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:16,301
Apple Computer has fallen on hard times.

1440
01:14:16,302 --> 01:14:19,103
It is laying off about 2,500 people.

1441
01:14:19,104 --> 01:14:21,306
<i>Apple is continuing
to lose market share,</i>

1442
01:14:21,307 --> 01:14:24,142
<i>with no new innovations in the
pipeline except the Newton,</i>

1443
01:14:24,143 --> 01:14:26,678
<i>a pet project of CEO John Sculley.</i>

1444
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:29,947
<i>If you really want to be
mobile, you want a Newton PDA.</i>

1445
01:14:29,948 --> 01:14:31,417
<i>But then again, maybe you don't.</i>

1446
01:14:31,418 --> 01:14:34,753
<i>It turns handwriting
into computer text.</i>

1447
01:14:34,754 --> 01:14:38,692
Hey, Dolph, take a memo on
your Newton. "Beat up Martin."

1448
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,261
Bah!

1449
01:14:42,262 --> 01:14:45,030
<i>In 1980, Apple had
30% of the market.</i>

1450
01:14:45,031 --> 01:14:47,766
<i>Today, Apple has only 3.2 percent.</i>

1451
01:14:47,767 --> 01:14:51,604
<i>That's it. John Sculley
has been fired from Apple.</i>

1452
01:14:52,938 --> 01:14:55,708
What about this Internet thing?
Do you know anything about that?

1453
01:14:55,709 --> 01:14:58,444
It is the big new thing.

1454
01:14:58,445 --> 01:15:01,079
Rumors are flying around
Apple Computer once again

1455
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,714
over who will take over the helm.

1456
01:15:02,715 --> 01:15:05,383
In the news at this hour, a
remarkable high-tech reunion.

1457
01:15:05,384 --> 01:15:08,020
<i>Well, it's happening. In
a billion-dollar shakeup,</i>

1458
01:15:08,021 --> 01:15:11,123
<i>Apple is purchasing NeXT Computer's
operating system, which may mean...</i>

1459
01:15:11,124 --> 01:15:13,726
- <i>Is the prodigal son returning?</i>
- <i>Bet on it.</i>

1460
01:15:13,727 --> 01:15:15,861
Guess what. Mac is back.

1461
01:15:15,862 --> 01:15:17,428
- Apple cofounder Steven Jobs...
- Steve Jobs...

1462
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,330
- Steve Jobs...
- Steve Jobs...
- Steve Jobs...

1463
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:21,901
<i>Steve Jobs is returning to Apple.</i>

1464
01:15:23,469 --> 01:15:26,472
<i>If you want to beam your digital
photographs from your digital camera,</i>

1465
01:15:26,473 --> 01:15:28,173
<i>it's built into every product.</i>

1466
01:15:28,174 --> 01:15:30,275
<i>We're going to the
new generation of I/O.</i>

1467
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:33,178
Twelve megabyte USB. Two ports.

1468
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:35,748
We're leaving the old Apple I/O behind.

1469
01:15:35,749 --> 01:15:38,383
Stereo surround sound
built into every product,

1470
01:15:38,384 --> 01:15:42,353
a great keyboard and the
coolest mouse you've ever seen.

1471
01:15:42,354 --> 01:15:46,424
This time, we used actual mice.

1472
01:15:46,425 --> 01:15:49,895
We're opening the house
in 10 minutes. Steven?

1473
01:15:49,896 --> 01:15:51,530
Do you want to stop horsing around?

1474
01:15:51,531 --> 01:15:56,000
Bless my eyes. That's Steve
Wozniak sitting out there.

1475
01:15:59,004 --> 01:16:02,441
Give yourselves a treat and ask Woz
if he happens to have the correct time.

1476
01:16:02,442 --> 01:16:06,410
I have the correct time,
and we're running out of it.

1477
01:16:06,411 --> 01:16:10,348
- "A great keyboard"...
- A great keyboard and the coolest mouse you've ever seen.

1478
01:16:10,349 --> 01:16:13,785
This is what those things look like today.

1479
01:16:13,786 --> 01:16:18,456
Now, I'd like to show you what
they're gonna look like tomorrow.

1480
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:21,360
This is the iMac.

1481
01:16:50,823 --> 01:16:52,324
That was cool.

1482
01:16:52,325 --> 01:16:54,426
Why did I like that
better than I usually do?

1483
01:16:54,427 --> 01:16:56,494
- I don't know.
- Something was different.

1484
01:16:56,495 --> 01:16:58,196
Hey, stupid.

1485
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,432
I think she's talking to one of you guys.

1486
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:03,235
- Did you notice a difference?
- That's what I'm...

1487
01:17:03,236 --> 01:17:05,937
The exit signs were off.

1488
01:17:05,938 --> 01:17:08,472
- Full blackout.
- You did it.

1489
01:17:08,473 --> 01:17:10,843
We wired all the exit lights to our board.

1490
01:17:10,844 --> 01:17:13,378
They go out with the cue for seven
seconds then come back on again. In theory.

1491
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:17,115
- We think that's legal?
- No, we're very certain it's not.

1492
01:17:17,116 --> 01:17:19,484
- You want to see some quotes?
- Let's hold off on those.

1493
01:17:19,485 --> 01:17:21,253
No, he'll like 'em.

1494
01:17:21,254 --> 01:17:24,758
- I'll show 'em to you later.
- I'll take 'em now.

1495
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,227
- I'm sorry.
- Pick it up from there, please.

1496
01:17:28,228 --> 01:17:30,995
We only have a couple of
minutes, so let's just do the 360.

1497
01:17:30,996 --> 01:17:34,399
We're gonna bring out a wireless
camera we stole from Panasonic.

1498
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,535
I'll show you what this looks like.

1499
01:17:37,536 --> 01:17:40,438
The whole thing is translucent.
You can see into it.

1500
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:42,975
How's that for a compromise, Woz?

1501
01:17:42,976 --> 01:17:46,544
- You still can't get into it, but you can see into it.
- Fair enough.

1502
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:50,315
We put stereo speakers in
front, infrared right up here,

1503
01:17:50,316 --> 01:17:52,284
CD-ROM drive in the middle.

1504
01:17:52,285 --> 01:17:55,020
- Nice.
- Dual stereo headphone jacks.

1505
01:17:55,021 --> 01:17:58,257
All the connectors are inside
one beautiful little door here.

1506
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:01,593
Ethernet. USB.

1507
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:04,096
Even though this is a
full-blooded Macintosh,

1508
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:05,931
we're targeting it for the number one use

1509
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:08,432
the consumers tell us they
want a computer for, which is...

1510
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:10,602
Let's hold it, please. Hold it.

1511
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:13,571
The answer was "the Internet."

1512
01:18:13,572 --> 01:18:15,674
- Joanna?
- Yeah.

1513
01:18:16,808 --> 01:18:20,145
Stand in front of me. I want to look at
these quotes, but I don't want Joel to know.

1514
01:18:20,146 --> 01:18:22,349
They're all great.

1515
01:18:24,049 --> 01:18:27,151
"It is not only the coolest-looking
computer introduced in years

1516
01:18:27,152 --> 01:18:28,587
but a chest-thumping statement

1517
01:18:28,588 --> 01:18:33,727
that Silicon Valley's original dream
company is no longer somnambulant."

1518
01:18:35,394 --> 01:18:36,861
It's a word. It means "sleepwalking."

1519
01:18:36,862 --> 01:18:40,499
Steve? I'm sorry. We have to clear
the house if we're gonna start on time.

1520
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,467
- We're gonna start on time.
- We're absolutely starting on time.

1521
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,002
Here. Take this.

1522
01:18:44,003 --> 01:18:48,173
Everybody, that's it. They've got to
mop the stage, reset and open the house.

1523
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:49,708
I love you guys.

1524
01:18:57,951 --> 01:18:59,651
Andy, come on back a minute.

1525
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,955
- Which one?
- Hertzfeld.

1526
01:19:08,428 --> 01:19:12,431
<i>Forbes</i> calls it an
"industry-altering success."

1527
01:19:12,432 --> 01:19:14,634
Look here.

1528
01:19:17,036 --> 01:19:19,236
Why haven't we ever slept together?

1529
01:19:19,237 --> 01:19:21,106
We're not in love. Look.

1530
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:26,011
- Sculley.
- Look what he said.

1531
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:31,383
"He has implemented the same simple strategy
that made Apple so successful 15 years ago...

1532
01:19:31,384 --> 01:19:34,621
make hit products and promote
them with terrific marketing."

1533
01:19:35,722 --> 01:19:38,190
- It was nice of him.
- It was.

1534
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:39,691
I meant it.

1535
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:43,261
Sightings of J.D. Salinger are
more common than John Sculley.

1536
01:19:43,262 --> 01:19:46,933
I wasn't being sarcastic.
It was nice of him.

1537
01:19:48,067 --> 01:19:50,134
- Do you talk to him?
- No.

1538
01:19:50,135 --> 01:19:52,169
You haven't talked to him since '88?

1539
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:54,705
I'd have told you if I did.

1540
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:56,141
Doesn't matter.

1541
01:19:56,142 --> 01:19:57,476
I don't want people
thinking they can cross me

1542
01:19:57,477 --> 01:20:01,178
and then, boom, 15 years
later, I'm cool with it.

1543
01:20:01,179 --> 01:20:04,182
I was kidding.

1544
01:20:04,183 --> 01:20:06,719
What's wrong with you this morning?

1545
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:10,089
Let's get off the stage.

1546
01:20:11,656 --> 01:20:14,759
"The only thing Apple's providing
now is leadership in colors."

1547
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,460
Don't worry about it.

1548
01:20:16,461 --> 01:20:18,562
- What does Bill Gates have against me?
- I don't know.

1549
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:21,466
You're both out of your
minds. Listen to me.

1550
01:20:21,467 --> 01:20:23,535
He dropped out of a better
school than I dropped out of.

1551
01:20:23,536 --> 01:20:25,404
But he's a tool bag. I'll tell you why.

1552
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:28,139
Make everything all right with Lisa.

1553
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:31,343
You know, Joanna? Boundaries.

1554
01:20:31,344 --> 01:20:34,311
You've come to my apartment
at 1:00 AM and cleaned it.

1555
01:20:34,312 --> 01:20:35,713
So tell me where the boundary is.

1556
01:20:35,714 --> 01:20:37,649
There. Let's say it's there.

1557
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:40,685
If I give you some real projections,

1558
01:20:40,686 --> 01:20:44,489
will you promise not to
repeat them from the stage?

1559
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:47,526
What do you mean, "real projections"?

1560
01:20:47,527 --> 01:20:51,495
- What have you been giving me?
- Conservative projections.

1561
01:20:51,496 --> 01:20:53,130
Marketing's been lying to me?

1562
01:20:53,131 --> 01:20:56,802
We've been managing expectations
so that you don't not.

1563
01:20:56,803 --> 01:20:59,138
What are the real projections?

1564
01:21:00,406 --> 01:21:03,275
We're gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days.

1565
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:05,209
20,000 a month after that.

1566
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:06,611
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

1567
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:08,346
You see? You wait long enough and...

1568
01:21:08,347 --> 01:21:10,749
What's more, 32% of the sales

1569
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:14,785
are going to go to people buying
a computer for the first time.

1570
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:19,490
And 12% are going to people using
some kind of Windows machine.

1571
01:21:19,491 --> 01:21:22,227
That's what Bill Gates has against you.

1572
01:21:23,696 --> 01:21:27,066
And it'll be the fastest-selling
computer in history.

1573
01:21:28,433 --> 01:21:30,468
You brought the company
back from life support

1574
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:33,538
after going through the misery
of laying off 3,000 people

1575
01:21:33,539 --> 01:21:35,774
and cutting 70% of the product line.

1576
01:21:35,775 --> 01:21:39,178
So, Steven, it's over.

1577
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:43,280
You're gonna win.

1578
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:47,384
- It would be criminal not to enjoy this moment.
- I'm enjoying it.

1579
01:21:47,385 --> 01:21:49,420
Make things all right with Lisa.

1580
01:21:49,421 --> 01:21:51,655
- You know...
- Come on.

1581
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:55,326
I don't like having less
privacy than other people have.

1582
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,896
- Does being a multi-billionaire take some of the sting off that?
- No.

1583
01:21:58,897 --> 01:22:02,133
- All Lisa did...
- All Lisa did was give her blessing.

1584
01:22:02,134 --> 01:22:05,669
- Chrisann sold the house and...
- And Lisa could have done what?

1585
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:08,272
How was she supposed to stop her
mother from selling her own house?

1586
01:22:08,273 --> 01:22:09,673
That I bought for the two of them.

1587
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:11,008
How was she supposed to stop her?

1588
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:14,612
Voicing an objection would have
been a step in the right direction.

1589
01:22:14,613 --> 01:22:17,315
You don't think you're
having a bizarre overreaction

1590
01:22:17,316 --> 01:22:20,819
to a 19-year-old girl allowing
her mother to list her own house?

1591
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,053
She could've tried.

1592
01:22:22,054 --> 01:22:25,757
Was she supposed to stop her
mother, that particular mother...

1593
01:22:25,758 --> 01:22:28,826
She gave Chrisann her blessing to sell
the house and she did it to spite me.

1594
01:22:28,827 --> 01:22:32,864
I don't care if she put a
pipe bomb in the water heater.

1595
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:35,667
You're going to fix it, now.

1596
01:22:35,668 --> 01:22:38,736
She's been acting weird for
months. She's turned on me.

1597
01:22:38,737 --> 01:22:40,804
- Fix it.
- What the...

1598
01:22:40,805 --> 01:22:42,440
Fix it, Steve.

1599
01:22:42,441 --> 01:22:43,941
- Take it easy.
- Fix it or I quit.

1600
01:22:43,942 --> 01:22:46,178
How about that? I quit,
and you never see me again.

1601
01:22:46,179 --> 01:22:48,114
How about that?

1602
01:22:49,581 --> 01:22:52,551
Tell me what's wrong with you this morning.

1603
01:22:52,552 --> 01:22:55,920
What's been wrong with me for 19 years.

1604
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:01,860
I've been a witness, and I
tell you, I've been complicit.

1605
01:23:03,362 --> 01:23:07,365
I love you, Steve. You know how much.

1606
01:23:07,366 --> 01:23:12,369
I love that you don't care how much money a
person makes. You care <i>what</i> they make.

1607
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:16,208
But what you make isn't supposed
to be the best part of you.

1608
01:23:16,209 --> 01:23:18,810
When you're a father,

1609
01:23:18,811 --> 01:23:21,413
that's what's supposed to
be the best part of you.

1610
01:23:21,414 --> 01:23:26,251
And it's caused me two decades of
agony, Steve, that it is for you

1611
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,821
the worst.

1612
01:23:30,822 --> 01:23:36,329
It's a little thing.
It's a very small thing.

1613
01:23:37,495 --> 01:23:39,830
Fix it.

1614
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:45,236
Fix it now, or you can
contact me at my new job...

1615
01:23:45,237 --> 01:23:48,206
working anywhere I want.

1616
01:23:49,709 --> 01:23:51,977
I don't happen to think it is
a little deal. She knew that...

1617
01:23:51,978 --> 01:23:54,378
- No.
- I bought the house for the two of...

1618
01:23:54,379 --> 01:23:55,746
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

1619
01:23:55,747 --> 01:24:00,884
I mean no. The house has nothing
to do with why you're angry at Lisa.

1620
01:24:00,885 --> 01:24:03,887
I assure you, the house has everything
to do with why I'm angry at Lisa.

1621
01:24:03,888 --> 01:24:08,560
Have you ever heard the phrase
"reality distortion field"?

1622
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:12,731
- Yes.
- As in "Steve's reality distortion field"?

1623
01:24:12,732 --> 01:24:15,633
I've heard it. I've read it.
It's been sung to me by Joan Baez.

1624
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,401
What you call a reality distortion field,

1625
01:24:17,402 --> 01:24:19,704
and I'm pretty sure you're
the one who coined the phrase,

1626
01:24:19,705 --> 01:24:21,740
- is the reason we're here.
- I know that.

1627
01:24:21,741 --> 01:24:24,042
If I traded in my bank account for a dollar

1628
01:24:24,043 --> 01:24:26,878
every time somebody told me something
was impossible, I'd come out ahead.

1629
01:24:26,879 --> 01:24:28,913
- I know that too.
- What's the problem?

1630
01:24:28,914 --> 01:24:31,915
- My problem? It sure isn't the house.
- Jo, I...

1631
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:36,387
It's that you told her you
weren't going to pay for Harvard.

1632
01:24:36,388 --> 01:24:38,423
That child.

1633
01:24:38,424 --> 01:24:40,825
That earnest, unironic kid.

1634
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,826
She told you I wasn't paying her tuition?

1635
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:45,496
I should have hit you with
something heavy a long time ago.

1636
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,033
Lisa told you I wasn't paying her tuition?

1637
01:24:48,034 --> 01:24:52,303
- Andy told me that.
- Which one?

1638
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:54,371
Hertzfeld.

1639
01:24:54,372 --> 01:24:55,874
How would Hertzfeld know?

1640
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:59,910
He wrote Harvard a check for
25,000 to cover the semester.

1641
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:02,847
Are you fucking... He paid her tuition?

1642
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,717
Isn't that why you just asked to see him?

1643
01:25:05,718 --> 01:25:07,319
No, I asked to see him about something...

1644
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:10,722
Did you tell her you weren't
going to pay for college?

1645
01:25:10,723 --> 01:25:12,723
- Yes, because...
- How could you do that?

1646
01:25:12,724 --> 01:25:15,959
Because her mother, who
is also her landlord...

1647
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,928
Hertzfeld? I was ranting.

1648
01:25:17,929 --> 01:25:20,498
I was just, you know... I was
talking. You think I would...

1649
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:24,602
I was pissed off because Lisa
was trying to piss me off, Joanna.

1650
01:25:24,603 --> 01:25:26,003
That was her intent. I don't know...

1651
01:25:26,004 --> 01:25:28,572
You obviously scared the hell out of her.

1652
01:25:28,573 --> 01:25:32,144
Hertzfeld wrote a check
to Harvard, pay for...

1653
01:25:33,345 --> 01:25:34,978
- Is she here yet?
- I'm sure she is.

1654
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:37,348
Can you have someone bring her back?

1655
01:25:37,349 --> 01:25:39,084
Yes.

1656
01:25:40,486 --> 01:25:42,421
Thank you.

1657
01:25:45,825 --> 01:25:47,559
You know,

1658
01:25:48,994 --> 01:25:50,695
my grandmother always used to say to me...

1659
01:25:50,696 --> 01:25:53,131
I don't give a shit, Yentl.

1660
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,767
- I'll have someone get Lisa.
- Thank you.

1661
01:25:56,768 --> 01:25:59,036
And if you see Hertzfeld...

1662
01:25:59,037 --> 01:26:00,972
It's Andy.

1663
01:26:00,973 --> 01:26:04,109
Speak of the devil's chief engineer.

1664
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:05,377
Go.

1665
01:26:05,378 --> 01:26:07,412
Come on in.

1666
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,383
You look great today.

1667
01:26:11,384 --> 01:26:12,851
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she?

1668
01:26:12,852 --> 01:26:16,488
She looks fantastic. Always does. Get out.

1669
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:20,991
- Well, I think I know why I'm here.
- Do you?

1670
01:26:20,992 --> 01:26:21,726
Steve...

1671
01:26:21,727 --> 01:26:24,596
- Did you send the check yet?
- Yes.

1672
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:27,831
So Harvard got a tuition check
from Andy Hertzfeld to pay for Lisa?

1673
01:26:27,832 --> 01:26:29,868
I don't think they look that carefully.

1674
01:26:29,869 --> 01:26:32,771
I don't think they'd notice
the check didn't come from you.

1675
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:35,673
Close one. This was
almost embarrassing for me.

1676
01:26:35,674 --> 01:26:37,609
I understand how...

1677
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,177
I'll wire you the money today.

1678
01:26:39,178 --> 01:26:42,746
I-I understand how you feel.
And I do apologize. I do.

1679
01:26:42,747 --> 01:26:45,016
But let me tell you my thinking.

1680
01:26:45,017 --> 01:26:47,685
I can't even think of an appropriate
analogy to describe what you did.

1681
01:26:47,686 --> 01:26:50,187
I knew you guys would
fix things. You always do.

1682
01:26:50,188 --> 01:26:53,991
But in the meantime, if the money wasn't
there, she'd miss a semester of school.

1683
01:26:53,992 --> 01:26:57,728
- Yeah.
- And she'd have to tell her friends why.

1684
01:26:57,729 --> 01:27:00,197
And she needed things. She needed socks.

1685
01:27:00,198 --> 01:27:04,436
- What?
- It's cold in Cambridge. She needed warm socks.

1686
01:27:04,437 --> 01:27:09,206
- You gave her socks?
- Well, I gave her money for socks.

1687
01:27:09,207 --> 01:27:12,509
You don't get to deputize
yourself as her interim.

1688
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:14,945
You don't get to override my
decisions. Do you understand?

1689
01:27:14,946 --> 01:27:17,115
You don't get to act
like you're her father.

1690
01:27:17,116 --> 01:27:19,683
Somebody had to.

1691
01:27:19,684 --> 01:27:21,785
What the fuck did you just say to me?

1692
01:27:21,786 --> 01:27:25,656
I've known her since she was six.

1693
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,859
I also consider...

1694
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:33,130
Chrisann's my friend, outside of what
you and I... outside of our relationship.

1695
01:27:33,131 --> 01:27:35,900
- So you're like a family adviser.
- I'm a family friend.

1696
01:27:35,901 --> 01:27:38,602
Then you probably know that
Lisa's been seeing a therapist.

1697
01:27:38,603 --> 01:27:40,170
- Yeah.
- For many years.

1698
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:42,474
- Yeah.
- Without my knowledge.

1699
01:27:43,909 --> 01:27:45,776
That really wasn't my business.

1700
01:27:45,777 --> 01:27:49,079
I'm fascinated by what you
think is and isn't your business.

1701
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:53,218
Lisa's been going to a
therapist and she likes it

1702
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:56,855
and would love for you and
Chrisann to go with her.

1703
01:27:56,856 --> 01:28:01,493
And the reason you know that is because
you're the one that recommended the therapist.

1704
01:28:01,494 --> 01:28:03,561
Well, I know a guy.

1705
01:28:03,562 --> 01:28:07,466
No, I mean you're the one who
recommended that she see a therapist.

1706
01:28:08,634 --> 01:28:13,036
You know what? It was a while ago,
and I don't remember how the whole...

1707
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:16,106
You told Chrisann that
Lisa should see a therapist.

1708
01:28:16,107 --> 01:28:19,244
Steve, you're stigmatizing.
It's a perfectly norm...

1709
01:28:19,245 --> 01:28:21,612
It's not...

1710
01:28:21,613 --> 01:28:23,681
My thing was, how can it hurt?

1711
01:28:23,682 --> 01:28:25,651
Let's find out.

1712
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,151
Chrisann is my friend.

1713
01:28:28,152 --> 01:28:31,522
- What was the reason you gave?
- You mean...

1714
01:28:31,523 --> 01:28:35,660
What was the reason you gave Chrisann
why Lisa should see a therapist?

1715
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:37,794
I don't remember. We
were talking and I said...

1716
01:28:37,795 --> 01:28:41,166
It's pretty much what I just said,
that it certainly couldn't hurt.

1717
01:28:42,634 --> 01:28:46,171
You didn't say that Lisa
needed a strong male role model?

1718
01:28:53,112 --> 01:28:54,680
I did.

1719
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:06,659
I think it's a miracle she's not robbing
banks with the Symbionese Liberation Army.

1720
01:29:09,295 --> 01:29:14,331
There's no reason in the
world why she should be nice.

1721
01:29:14,332 --> 01:29:16,535
But she is.

1722
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:23,641
So I helped, because somebody had to.

1723
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:32,218
I'll wire the money to you this afternoon.

1724
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:47,130
You threatened me a long time ago.

1725
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:48,800
Sorry?

1726
01:29:50,835 --> 01:29:53,937
A long time ago... You threatened me once.

1727
01:29:53,938 --> 01:29:56,007
People are attracted to people with talent.

1728
01:29:56,008 --> 01:29:58,209
People without it find that threatening.

1729
01:29:58,210 --> 01:30:00,277
Maybe you should see a therapist.

1730
01:30:00,278 --> 01:30:02,879
Certainly couldn't hurt.

1731
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,216
I meant you literally threatened me.

1732
01:30:05,217 --> 01:30:07,752
At Flint, right before the Mac launch.

1733
01:30:07,753 --> 01:30:10,053
I was recompiling. I was
trying to debug the voice demo.

1734
01:30:10,054 --> 01:30:14,392
You said if I couldn't find a solution,
you'd call me out in front of the audience.

1735
01:30:14,393 --> 01:30:16,861
- Did it say "hello"?
- It did.

1736
01:30:16,862 --> 01:30:20,263
No need to thank me.

1737
01:30:20,264 --> 01:30:24,067
Why do you want people to dislike you?

1738
01:30:24,068 --> 01:30:27,237
I don't want people to dislike me.

1739
01:30:27,238 --> 01:30:30,342
I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me.

1740
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:34,847
Since it doesn't matter, I always have.

1741
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,084
Really?

1742
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:43,656
I've always liked you
a lot. That's too bad.

1743
01:30:45,823 --> 01:30:48,693
- Knock 'em dead.
- Thank you.

1744
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:15,152
What is remarkable, what's
hard to fathom but true,

1745
01:31:15,153 --> 01:31:21,494
is that for a given clock rate, a PowerPC
chip is twice as fast as a Pentium II chip.

1746
01:31:34,372 --> 01:31:36,541
In other words,

1747
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:40,277
a 266 megahertz G3 chip

1748
01:31:40,278 --> 01:31:45,817
is twice as fast as a
266 megahertz Pentium II.

1749
01:31:48,853 --> 01:31:53,124
Or... a 266 G3

1750
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:57,227
is equal to about 500 megahertz.

1751
01:31:57,228 --> 01:32:00,330
<i>Do you know what a
coincidence is, Lisa?</i>

1752
01:32:00,331 --> 01:32:02,999
Take a look at <i>Byte</i>
magazine's Byte Marks,

1753
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,670
the gold standard for any...

1754
01:32:10,209 --> 01:32:13,646
Come in.

1755
01:32:16,482 --> 01:32:19,182
I sent someone into the lobby.

1756
01:32:19,183 --> 01:32:21,017
- They found her, and she...
- Where is she?

1757
01:32:21,018 --> 01:32:23,887
She said she'd rather not come back.

1758
01:32:23,888 --> 01:32:26,257
- Why?
- That was it.

1759
01:32:26,258 --> 01:32:29,259
- I'm going out there myself.
- You can't. You can't.

1760
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,027
It'll be a scene out of
<i>Hard Day's Night.</i>

1761
01:32:33,898 --> 01:32:36,267
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Joel.

1762
01:32:36,268 --> 01:32:38,102
Andy said it was okay to come back.

1763
01:32:38,103 --> 01:32:40,739
- Which one?
- Andy Cunningham.

1764
01:32:41,839 --> 01:32:44,808
I can't do this forever. I need
one of them to change their name.

1765
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,910
You call Andy Cunningham "Andrea."

1766
01:32:46,911 --> 01:32:48,311
It doesn't matter what I call them.

1767
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:50,047
I know who I'm talking
about when I'm talking.

1768
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,915
I need everyone else to
call them different names.

1769
01:32:51,916 --> 01:32:53,952
Give me one second.

1770
01:32:58,223 --> 01:33:00,792
Can you go get her for me, please?

1771
01:33:00,793 --> 01:33:02,459
I just talked to Andy.

1772
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:04,227
Hertzfeld.

1773
01:33:04,228 --> 01:33:07,464
I'm just trying to scrub this
out of my brain with Drano.

1774
01:33:07,465 --> 01:33:09,866
But I do want to talk to Lisa.

1775
01:33:09,867 --> 01:33:12,402
Okay. Just...

1776
01:33:12,403 --> 01:33:14,706
- Stay cool.
- Okay.

1777
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:18,744
Thank you.

1778
01:33:26,285 --> 01:33:28,019
Hey, Steve.

1779
01:33:40,464 --> 01:33:43,834
- How are you feeling?
- I'm feeling good, Joel. How about you?

1780
01:33:43,835 --> 01:33:46,503
I don't think I could be in your
business. It changes too quickly.

1781
01:33:46,504 --> 01:33:49,841
Well, I'd hang on, 'cause yours is about
to start changing pretty quickly too.

1782
01:33:49,842 --> 01:33:53,009
This is the third time in 14
years I'm writing about you.

1783
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:56,414
What do you think so far?

1784
01:33:56,415 --> 01:34:00,183
Excuse me. Avie's looking
for you. He has a new shark.

1785
01:34:00,184 --> 01:34:02,655
- You wanna come backstage for a second?
- Sure.

1786
01:34:05,957 --> 01:34:09,160
- Who's this one?
- Alan Turing.

1787
01:34:09,161 --> 01:34:12,896
Single-handedly won World War II and,
for an encore, invented the computer.

1788
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:15,098
- He won't be part of the campaign though.
- Why not?

1789
01:34:15,099 --> 01:34:17,535
'Cause you just had to ask me who he was.

1790
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:20,838
Can I see new shark?

1791
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:25,543
I like it better than the old shark.

1792
01:34:25,544 --> 01:34:27,178
- Sharks.
- Sharks.

1793
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:29,079
- How many sharks did you go through?
- A couple.

1794
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,883
- This is the 39th.
- We're on the record.

1795
01:34:32,884 --> 01:34:35,553
- Thirty-nine sharks.
- Okay.

1796
01:34:35,554 --> 01:34:37,621
- You know what's special about this shark?
- What?

1797
01:34:37,622 --> 01:34:42,293
No, I'm really asking, because it looks
exactly like the other 38 sharks to me.

1798
01:34:42,294 --> 01:34:44,294
Let me see it with the
cue, from the profile.

1799
01:34:44,295 --> 01:34:46,163
This is cue 92-B.

1800
01:34:46,164 --> 01:34:50,368
This is a profile here, and this
is what it looks like from the back.

1801
01:34:50,369 --> 01:34:55,172
And one more thing. It eats
Pentium notebooks as a light snack.

1802
01:34:55,173 --> 01:34:58,241
This is the shark.

1803
01:34:58,242 --> 01:35:00,511
I really like it.

1804
01:35:00,512 --> 01:35:02,312
Nobody gets it right the first time,

1805
01:35:02,313 --> 01:35:04,915
but I should have been shown
this shark 15, 20 fish ago.

1806
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:06,616
- You probably were.
- Lock it in.

1807
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:08,451
Ten minutes.

1808
01:35:08,452 --> 01:35:12,956
He killed himself by taking a bite
of a poison apple... Alan Turing.

1809
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:14,091
Yeah.

1810
01:35:14,092 --> 01:35:16,694
There should be statues of that man.

1811
01:35:16,695 --> 01:35:19,062
His name should be on the
lips of schoolchildren.

1812
01:35:19,063 --> 01:35:22,633
The rainbow flag apple with a bite
taken out... That's where it came from?

1813
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:25,503
No, we picked it off a list
of friendly-sounding words.

1814
01:35:25,504 --> 01:35:28,472
But wouldn't it be great if that
had been the story behind it?

1815
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:32,075
Steve. Kinda liked the last shark.

1816
01:35:32,076 --> 01:35:34,011
Fuck you.

1817
01:35:34,012 --> 01:35:35,612
I wanted to ask you a favor.

1818
01:35:35,613 --> 01:35:36,813
My friend, a long time ago,

1819
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:39,583
you asked me a favor before a
product launch, and I said no.

1820
01:35:39,584 --> 01:35:42,018
- You wanted me to acknowledge...
- Hang on.

1821
01:35:42,019 --> 01:35:46,289
If you're about to say you were wrong,
I want to prepare this journalist.

1822
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:50,628
I was 100% right, and you
were spectacularly wrong.

1823
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:53,129
But I still owe you a favor, so name it.

1824
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:54,697
Steve...

1825
01:35:54,698 --> 01:35:59,369
- It can't be acknowledging the Apple II team.
- Acknowledge the Apple II team.

1826
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:01,172
- How about in private?
- No.

1827
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:02,606
- Is this a prank?
- No.

1828
01:36:02,607 --> 01:36:04,741
I'm trying to remember that
a 300 megahertz G3 chip...

1829
01:36:04,742 --> 01:36:07,012
Just the top guys.

1830
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:11,082
Steve.

1831
01:36:14,119 --> 01:36:15,686
- Excuse me, okay?
- Yep.

1832
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:18,188
One second.

1833
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:25,096
- She said she'd rather not.
- What do you mean?

1834
01:36:25,097 --> 01:36:28,432
She's sitting with her friends, and
she said she'd rather not come back.

1835
01:36:28,433 --> 01:36:30,433
Okay. Tell her... Take her aside.

1836
01:36:30,434 --> 01:36:32,436
I don't want to embarrass
her in front of her friends.

1837
01:36:32,437 --> 01:36:34,672
But tell her I just scared
the shit out of Andy,

1838
01:36:34,673 --> 01:36:37,209
and this time, nobody's
paying her fucking...

1839
01:36:38,477 --> 01:36:40,544
All right. Don't say that.

1840
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:43,146
But do your thing where
you sound old and wise

1841
01:36:43,147 --> 01:36:46,417
because of the broad, tragic
European canvas of your life.

1842
01:36:46,418 --> 01:36:49,285
You know I wasn't born in a
19th-century shtetl, right?

1843
01:36:49,286 --> 01:36:51,454
Please tell her it's important.

1844
01:36:51,455 --> 01:36:54,025
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

1845
01:36:54,026 --> 01:36:55,625
- There are people around here, man...
- I know.

1846
01:36:55,626 --> 01:36:59,562
- Including a member of the press.
- I see him.

1847
01:36:59,563 --> 01:37:00,664
Woz.

1848
01:37:00,665 --> 01:37:03,936
Just the top guys, the ones
who are getting laid off.

1849
01:37:05,137 --> 01:37:07,405
Listen, okay?

1850
01:37:07,406 --> 01:37:12,343
Last year, Apple lost one billion dollars.

1851
01:37:12,344 --> 01:37:14,311
I don't even know how that's possible.

1852
01:37:14,312 --> 01:37:16,780
You were less than 90
days from being insolvent.

1853
01:37:16,781 --> 01:37:19,583
I had three different accountants
try to explain it to me.

1854
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:22,585
The whole place has to be streamlined.

1855
01:37:22,586 --> 01:37:25,188
- Start with two of the accountants.
- I started with the...

1856
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:28,225
- Joel, could you come offstage? We're gonna go backstage.
- Leave him right there.

1857
01:37:28,226 --> 01:37:32,596
I started with the Apple II team
because we don't make that anymore.

1858
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:36,333
- Just acknowledge the top guys.
- Have a mimosa and relax.

1859
01:37:36,334 --> 01:37:38,835
You will not blow me off right now, Steve.

1860
01:37:38,836 --> 01:37:41,605
- The top guys deserve...
- There are no top guys.

1861
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:44,208
All right? On the Apple II
team, there are no top guys.

1862
01:37:44,209 --> 01:37:47,645
They're "B" players, and "B"
players discourage the "A" players.

1863
01:37:47,646 --> 01:37:49,612
I want "A" players at Apple and not Dell.

1864
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:52,348
They're not "B" players, and
I'm a better judge of that.

1865
01:37:52,349 --> 01:37:54,819
Less than 90 days from insolvency,

1866
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:58,588
in part because somebody thought
the Newton wasn't a box of garbage.

1867
01:37:58,589 --> 01:38:00,223
- Joel, could you come offstage, please?
- Leave him.

1868
01:38:00,224 --> 01:38:01,659
I'm talking about...

1869
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:04,261
You guys designed and shipped a
little box of garbage while I was gone.

1870
01:38:04,262 --> 01:38:05,728
I'm talking about the Apple II,

1871
01:38:05,729 --> 01:38:08,531
which is not just a crucial
part of this company's history,

1872
01:38:08,532 --> 01:38:11,102
it is a crucial part of the
history of personal computing.

1873
01:38:11,103 --> 01:38:12,770
For a time.

1874
01:38:12,771 --> 01:38:15,371
The least you can do, if you're
going to downsize these people...

1875
01:38:15,372 --> 01:38:18,174
They're gonna live in the biggest houses
of anyone on the unemployment line.

1876
01:38:18,175 --> 01:38:22,480
Is to acknowledge them. Acknowledge
them and the Apple II during this launch.

1877
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:24,048
This is a new animal.

1878
01:38:24,049 --> 01:38:28,185
This whole place was built by the Apple
II. <i>You</i> were built by the Apple II.

1879
01:38:28,186 --> 01:38:31,254
As a matter of fact, I was destroyed
by the Apple II and its open system

1880
01:38:31,255 --> 01:38:33,124
so that hackers and hobbyists

1881
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:36,593
could build ham radios or something.

1882
01:38:36,594 --> 01:38:38,395
And then it nearly destroyed Apple

1883
01:38:38,396 --> 01:38:40,431
when you spent all your money on it

1884
01:38:40,432 --> 01:38:43,700
and developed a grand
total of no new products.

1885
01:38:43,701 --> 01:38:45,669
- The Newton.
- The little box of garbage.

1886
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:49,775
You guys came up with the Newton.
You want people to know that?

1887
01:38:51,675 --> 01:38:55,146
This is a product launch, not a luncheon.

1888
01:38:55,147 --> 01:38:57,248
The last thing I want to
do is connect the iMac to...

1889
01:38:57,249 --> 01:39:00,217
To the only successful product
that this company has ever made.

1890
01:39:00,218 --> 01:39:03,654
I'm sorry to be blunt, but
that happens to be the truth.

1891
01:39:03,655 --> 01:39:07,624
The Lisa was a failure.
The Macintosh was a failure.

1892
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:09,692
I don't like talking like this,

1893
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:14,431
but I am tired of being
Ringo when I know I was John.

1894
01:39:14,432 --> 01:39:15,833
Everybody loves Ringo.

1895
01:39:15,834 --> 01:39:18,903
And I'm tired of being patronized by you.

1896
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:23,339
You think John became John
by winning a raffle, Woz?

1897
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,708
You think he tricked somebody

1898
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:27,311
or hit George Harrison over the head?

1899
01:39:27,312 --> 01:39:29,245
He was John because he was John.

1900
01:39:29,246 --> 01:39:33,584
He was John 'cause he wrote "Ticket
to Ride." And I wrote the Apple II.

1901
01:39:33,585 --> 01:39:37,122
- Everybody? I want to clear the auditorium.
- Nobody moves.

1902
01:39:39,456 --> 01:39:41,292
You made a beautiful board,

1903
01:39:41,293 --> 01:39:43,427
which, by the way, you were
willing to give out for free,

1904
01:39:43,428 --> 01:39:45,495
so don't tell me how you built Apple.

1905
01:39:45,496 --> 01:39:47,897
If it weren't for me, you'd be the
easiest "A" at Homestead High School.

1906
01:39:47,898 --> 01:39:52,203
These people live and die by your
praise, so here's your chance.

1907
01:39:52,204 --> 01:39:57,241
Acknowledge that something good happened
that you weren't in the room for.

1908
01:40:00,378 --> 01:40:02,612
- No.
- Steve.

1909
01:40:02,613 --> 01:40:07,184
Do it. It's right. It's...

1910
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:10,353
It's right.

1911
01:40:10,354 --> 01:40:12,489
Sorry, but no.

1912
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:15,892
Then let me put it another way.

1913
01:40:15,893 --> 01:40:18,795
I don't think there's a man
who's done more to advance

1914
01:40:18,796 --> 01:40:22,333
the democratization that comes
with personal computing than I have,

1915
01:40:22,334 --> 01:40:23,901
but you've never had any respect for me.

1916
01:40:23,902 --> 01:40:26,004
Now why is that?

1917
01:40:27,272 --> 01:40:28,638
I'd at least consider the possibility

1918
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:30,673
that it's because you've
never had any for me.

1919
01:40:32,978 --> 01:40:34,712
What the hell is going on here?

1920
01:40:34,713 --> 01:40:38,183
Nothing. Thank you for your time.

1921
01:40:41,686 --> 01:40:44,788
It's done. She's coming back.

1922
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:47,358
You came a half-inch from putting
this company out of business.

1923
01:40:48,927 --> 01:40:51,162
Now who do I see about that?

1924
01:40:52,296 --> 01:40:54,498
I'm letting you keep your job.

1925
01:40:54,499 --> 01:40:56,902
You get a pass.

1926
01:40:59,403 --> 01:41:00,803
You know, when people used to ask me

1927
01:41:00,804 --> 01:41:03,374
what the difference was
between me and Steve Jobs,

1928
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:06,477
I would say Steve was the big-picture guy

1929
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:08,411
and I liked a solid workbench.

1930
01:41:08,412 --> 01:41:10,414
When people ask me what
the difference is now,

1931
01:41:10,415 --> 01:41:12,850
I say "Steve's an asshole."

1932
01:41:12,851 --> 01:41:15,652
Your products are better
than you are, brother.

1933
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:18,621
That's the idea, brother.

1934
01:41:18,622 --> 01:41:22,459
And knowing that, that's the difference.

1935
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:25,462
It's not binary.

1936
01:41:25,463 --> 01:41:29,034
You can be decent and
gifted at the same time.

1937
01:41:50,722 --> 01:41:52,856
He didn't mean it.

1938
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,960
Yeah, he did.

1939
01:41:57,429 --> 01:41:59,397
He's a temperamental guy.

1940
01:42:00,598 --> 01:42:02,300
No, he's not.

1941
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:09,505
It's like five minutes before every launch,

1942
01:42:09,506 --> 01:42:13,677
everyone goes to a bar, gets drunk
and tells me what they really think.

1943
01:42:13,678 --> 01:42:16,414
She's coming to your dressing room.

1944
01:42:27,025 --> 01:42:29,426
I told you to make things
all right with Lisa.

1945
01:42:29,427 --> 01:42:32,730
I didn't say you had to settle
every blood feud you have.

1946
01:42:32,731 --> 01:42:36,767
Last time blood feuds weren't settled,
I lost the cover of <i>Time.</i>

1947
01:42:36,768 --> 01:42:40,471
Though for the life of me, I still don't know
what the hell Dan Kottke was mad at me about.

1948
01:42:40,472 --> 01:42:43,139
- Kottke didn't lose you the cover of <i>Time.</i>
- Of course he did.

1949
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:45,776
Would you like me to demonstrate
your capacity to be wrong

1950
01:42:45,777 --> 01:42:47,378
when you're certain you're right?

1951
01:42:47,379 --> 01:42:49,847
Dan Kottke told <i>Time</i>
magazine that I was denying...

1952
01:42:49,848 --> 01:42:51,615
Do you remember the cover?

1953
01:42:51,616 --> 01:42:53,150
- Of <i>Time?</i>
- Yes.

1954
01:42:53,151 --> 01:42:54,918
- Yes.
- What was it?

1955
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:56,986
- What are you talking about?
- What was on the cover?

1956
01:42:56,987 --> 01:42:58,588
- A computer.
- No.

1957
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,990
It was a sculpture of a computer.

1958
01:43:00,991 --> 01:43:03,561
It was a sculpture.

1959
01:43:04,696 --> 01:43:07,865
<i>Time</i> would have had to have
commissioned it months in advance.

1960
01:43:07,866 --> 01:43:10,066
You were never in the
conversation for Man of the Year.

1961
01:43:10,067 --> 01:43:11,768
Nobody lost you anything.

1962
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:13,637
<i>...picture of me and the Mac.</i>

1963
01:43:13,638 --> 01:43:16,673
So what else are you sure about?

1964
01:43:16,674 --> 01:43:19,575
I don't know how I could've missed that.

1965
01:43:19,576 --> 01:43:21,611
- Reality distortion.
- No, seriously.

1966
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:22,812
Seriously.

1967
01:43:22,813 --> 01:43:25,615
Don't try to win an argument with Lisa.

1968
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:28,752
Just say you were wrong.

1969
01:43:28,753 --> 01:43:30,856
Come on in, honey.

1970
01:43:31,889 --> 01:43:34,424
- It's not "honey."
- John.

1971
01:43:34,425 --> 01:43:36,627
Get in. Get in. Get out of the hall.

1972
01:43:36,628 --> 01:43:38,061
I was taken in a side entrance.

1973
01:43:38,062 --> 01:43:39,963
I'll go out the same
way. No one will see me.

1974
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:42,566
- How are you, Joanna?
- I'm good, John.

1975
01:43:42,567 --> 01:43:45,102
I'm just surprised to see you.

1976
01:43:45,103 --> 01:43:47,704
Everyone here really appreciates
the quote you gave to <i>Forbes.</i>

1977
01:43:47,705 --> 01:43:50,507
- You didn't have to do that.
- My pleasure.

1978
01:43:50,508 --> 01:43:53,544
If you want, I can slip you in the
back once the house lights go out.

1979
01:43:53,545 --> 01:43:56,548
- I'm just here to say "good luck."
- <i>Okay.</i>

1980
01:43:57,915 --> 01:43:59,917
You just have a couple of minutes.

1981
01:43:59,918 --> 01:44:02,254
- Would you try to find...
- Yeah.

1982
01:44:06,457 --> 01:44:08,559
You're a good man, John.

1983
01:44:20,905 --> 01:44:24,040
So I brought you a present.

1984
01:44:24,041 --> 01:44:25,709
A Newton.

1985
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:31,514
Don't take it out of the box, you'll be able
to sell it, which is more than I can say.

1986
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:33,484
Everything all right there?

1987
01:44:33,485 --> 01:44:35,752
Uh, no...

1988
01:44:35,753 --> 01:44:38,754
Just something Joanna pointed out to me.

1989
01:44:38,755 --> 01:44:42,025
I missed something so obvious about...

1990
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:43,628
Doesn't matter.

1991
01:44:45,629 --> 01:44:49,098
Look, Wall Street's gonna sit back
and wait to see how you do as CEO,

1992
01:44:49,099 --> 01:44:51,968
so don't let any fluctuation
bother you for the first 12 months.

1993
01:44:51,969 --> 01:44:54,472
Day traders are gonna respond.

1994
01:44:55,506 --> 01:44:57,409
I don't need to school you.

1995
01:44:58,643 --> 01:45:00,843
This your way of telling me I
shouldn't have killed the Newton?

1996
01:45:00,844 --> 01:45:05,281
The most efficient animal
on the planet is the condor.

1997
01:45:05,282 --> 01:45:08,084
The most inefficient animals
on the planet are humans.

1998
01:45:08,085 --> 01:45:10,853
Well, you shouldn't
have killed it for spite.

1999
01:45:10,854 --> 01:45:14,290
That's bad business. Don't do that.

2000
01:45:14,291 --> 01:45:19,663
But a human with a bicycle
becomes the most efficient animal.

2001
01:45:19,664 --> 01:45:21,798
And the right computer...

2002
01:45:21,799 --> 01:45:24,601
a friendly, easy computer
that isn't an eyesore

2003
01:45:24,602 --> 01:45:29,071
but rather sits on your desk with
the beauty of a Tensor lamp...

2004
01:45:29,072 --> 01:45:34,076
The right computer will
be a bicycle for the mind.

2005
01:45:34,077 --> 01:45:36,679
Do you like it?

2006
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:39,081
I was giving back.

2007
01:45:39,082 --> 01:45:43,219
And what if instead of it
being in the right hands,

2008
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:45,289
it was in everyone's hands?

2009
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:47,392
Everyone in the world.

2010
01:45:48,893 --> 01:45:51,962
We'd be talking about the most tectonic
shift in the status quo since...

2011
01:45:51,963 --> 01:45:53,364
Ever.

2012
01:45:53,365 --> 01:45:56,566
I don't know why you've always been
interested in my adoption history,

2013
01:45:56,567 --> 01:46:00,603
but you said it's not like someone
looked at me and gave me back.

2014
01:46:00,604 --> 01:46:02,039
But that is what happened.

2015
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,576
And you're telling me you
have the right computer.

2016
01:46:05,677 --> 01:46:07,977
It's called Macintosh.

2017
01:46:07,978 --> 01:46:10,713
A lawyer couple adopted me first,

2018
01:46:10,714 --> 01:46:13,216
then gave me back after a month.

2019
01:46:13,217 --> 01:46:15,387
They changed their mind.

2020
01:46:16,987 --> 01:46:19,690
Then my parents adopted me.

2021
01:46:19,691 --> 01:46:22,258
My biological mother had
stipulated that whoever took me

2022
01:46:22,259 --> 01:46:25,795
had to be college-educated,
wealthy and Catholic.

2023
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:28,331
Paul and Clara Jobs were
none of those things,

2024
01:46:28,332 --> 01:46:32,768
so my biological mother wouldn't
sign the adoption papers.

2025
01:46:32,769 --> 01:46:34,070
What happened?

2026
01:46:34,071 --> 01:46:37,607
There was a legal battle
that went on for a while.

2027
01:46:37,608 --> 01:46:40,877
My mother said she refused
to love me for the first year.

2028
01:46:40,878 --> 01:46:42,812
You know, in case they had to give me back.

2029
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:45,816
You can't refuse to love someone, Steve.

2030
01:46:45,817 --> 01:46:48,685
Yeah, it turns out you can.

2031
01:46:48,686 --> 01:46:52,822
What the hell can a one-month-old do
that's so bad his parents give him back?

2032
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:55,758
Nothing. There's nothing
a one-month-old can do...

2033
01:46:55,759 --> 01:46:59,029
Have you ever thought about trying
to find your biological father?

2034
01:46:59,030 --> 01:47:00,731
I've met my biological father.

2035
01:47:00,732 --> 01:47:02,600
For that matter, so have you.

2036
01:47:05,236 --> 01:47:07,070
It's called Macintosh.

2037
01:47:07,071 --> 01:47:09,740
- Mr. Steve Jobs.
- Jandali.

2038
01:47:09,741 --> 01:47:11,208
Say hello to John Sculley.

2039
01:47:11,209 --> 01:47:14,777
Jandali owns the place,
and John's the CEO of Pepsi,

2040
01:47:14,778 --> 01:47:18,382
<i>but I'm trying to get him to move to
Cupertino, put a dent in the universe.</i>

2041
01:47:18,383 --> 01:47:20,182
You eat vegan as well?

2042
01:47:20,183 --> 01:47:21,785
You're kidding me.

2043
01:47:21,786 --> 01:47:23,387
No, I'll eat anything.

2044
01:47:23,388 --> 01:47:27,356
Why don't you start off with the Mediterranean
lettuce salad with purslane, mint...

2045
01:47:27,357 --> 01:47:31,261
My sister found him.

2046
01:47:31,262 --> 01:47:33,664
- Does he know?
- No. In fact, he bragged to Mona

2047
01:47:33,665 --> 01:47:35,999
that Steve Jobs comes in
the restaurant all the time.

2048
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,935
- You don't want to...
- No.

2049
01:47:38,936 --> 01:47:41,840
<i>Don't you think you
should talk to him?</i>

2050
01:47:43,206 --> 01:47:46,209
He'd probably find a reason to sue me.

2051
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,712
Oh, Steve...

2052
01:47:48,713 --> 01:47:51,815
John, if you're here about your legacy,

2053
01:47:51,816 --> 01:47:53,450
you need to form a line behind Wozniak.

2054
01:47:53,451 --> 01:47:55,718
Wozniak's gonna be fine.

2055
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:58,922
I'm the guy who fired Steve Jobs.

2056
01:47:58,923 --> 01:48:02,058
Rich, college-educated and Catholic.

2057
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:06,330
Steve? It's time.

2058
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:12,570
I've gotta go.

2059
01:48:14,772 --> 01:48:18,376
Did I do this? Screw it up?

2060
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:23,381
Let's let it go now.

2061
01:48:24,848 --> 01:48:26,750
Has to be time.

2062
01:48:31,222 --> 01:48:33,758
Come be our CEO.

2063
01:48:34,991 --> 01:48:36,894
Yeah. Okay.

2064
01:48:45,335 --> 01:48:48,871
It was the stylus, John.

2065
01:48:48,872 --> 01:48:52,942
- What?
- I killed the Newton because of the stylus.

2066
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:56,781
If you're holding a stylus, you can't use the
other five that are attached to your wrist.

2067
01:49:00,284 --> 01:49:02,487
Things we could have done together.

2068
01:49:07,825 --> 01:49:10,394
God, the things we could've done.

2069
01:49:26,777 --> 01:49:28,244
I'm paying your tuition.

2070
01:49:28,245 --> 01:49:30,446
Are you crazy? Of course
I'm paying your tuition.

2071
01:49:30,447 --> 01:49:33,984
I must have misunderstood you when
you said you weren't paying my tuition.

2072
01:49:33,985 --> 01:49:36,453
You and your mom selling the
house was a hostile thing to do.

2073
01:49:36,454 --> 01:49:38,254
She needed the money.

2074
01:49:38,255 --> 01:49:40,056
She always needs the money.

2075
01:49:40,057 --> 01:49:44,127
She needs a doctor. She
has a sinus infection.

2076
01:49:44,128 --> 01:49:47,998
She's had the same sinus
infection since 1988.

2077
01:49:47,999 --> 01:49:51,200
I'm gonna take care of my mother.
I'm sorry if that angers you.

2078
01:49:51,201 --> 01:49:53,069
It does anger me, because you're a kid

2079
01:49:53,070 --> 01:49:55,405
and it's not your job to
take care of your mother.

2080
01:49:55,406 --> 01:49:57,440
Is that how yours died?

2081
01:49:57,441 --> 01:50:01,477
Guys, step away, please,
and give them some room.

2082
01:50:01,478 --> 01:50:04,481
When your mom is 90 and can't feed herself,

2083
01:50:04,482 --> 01:50:05,816
you can take care of her.

2084
01:50:05,817 --> 01:50:11,320
But right now, she's 45, perfectly
healthy and can't feed herself.

2085
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:14,524
You're supposed to work hard at
school and be 19, and that's it.

2086
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:17,494
- I'll take care of your mother.
- Keep up the good work.

2087
01:50:17,495 --> 01:50:20,096
- What the hell do you want from me?
- I was sent for.

2088
01:50:20,097 --> 01:50:22,833
I bought her a house for $400,000.

2089
01:50:22,834 --> 01:50:24,567
It's worth twice that much today.

2090
01:50:24,568 --> 01:50:27,036
She sold it for two magic
rocks and a bowl of soup.

2091
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:28,471
It was her house.

2092
01:50:28,472 --> 01:50:30,272
She used that money to
travel through Europe.

2093
01:50:30,273 --> 01:50:32,107
Money which you make her beg for.

2094
01:50:32,108 --> 01:50:34,244
- Steve...
- Don't even start with that.

2095
01:50:34,245 --> 01:50:36,279
Going to Andy and asking for the money?

2096
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:38,114
That was so off-the-charts
over the line...

2097
01:50:38,115 --> 01:50:41,383
I did not do that. Andy came to me.

2098
01:50:41,384 --> 01:50:44,420
Everybody have an opinion on this?

2099
01:50:44,421 --> 01:50:47,958
I'm sorry, guys. In 30 seconds,
you're going to be late.

2100
01:50:47,959 --> 01:50:51,861
She spends the money on antiques and then
sells them for a fraction of what she paid,

2101
01:50:51,862 --> 01:50:54,063
and she does it with money
I gave to her for you.

2102
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:55,464
Steve...

2103
01:50:55,465 --> 01:50:57,366
You came to me hysterical when you were 13,

2104
01:50:57,367 --> 01:50:59,268
- asking if you could live with me...
- I was not hysterical.

2105
01:50:59,269 --> 01:51:01,003
because your mom was
screaming at you every day.

2106
01:51:01,004 --> 01:51:03,138
Thirteen was the second time I asked you.

2107
01:51:03,139 --> 01:51:04,874
The stress of her life
as a spiritual healer.

2108
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:09,012
I don't believe I said you're a
bad guy. But if I did, I'm sorry.

2109
01:51:12,148 --> 01:51:14,618
Hey. Something happened to you at school,

2110
01:51:14,619 --> 01:51:20,022
some first semester core class that
all freshmen are required to take...

2111
01:51:20,023 --> 01:51:22,892
- I read <i>Time.</i>
- What?

2112
01:51:22,893 --> 01:51:26,495
I have Internet access at school.
I read an old copy of <i>Time,</i>

2113
01:51:26,496 --> 01:51:30,299
and I asked my mom some
questions about my family history.

2114
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:32,067
That was...

2115
01:51:32,068 --> 01:51:34,169
<i>Time</i> wrote a
mangled piece of journal.

2116
01:51:34,170 --> 01:51:35,571
You were never supposed to read that.

2117
01:51:35,572 --> 01:51:38,074
I had two different Harvard statisticians

2118
01:51:38,075 --> 01:51:40,677
try to reverse-engineer the
equation that you came up with

2119
01:51:40,678 --> 01:51:44,446
to prove that 28% of American
men could be my father.

2120
01:51:44,447 --> 01:51:45,848
Honey, I...

2121
01:51:45,849 --> 01:51:49,652
You know, my mother might be a
troubled woman, but what's your excuse?

2122
01:51:49,653 --> 01:51:53,255
That's why I'm not impressed
with your story, Dad.

2123
01:51:53,256 --> 01:51:55,325
It's that you knew what
I was going through,

2124
01:51:55,326 --> 01:51:57,294
and you didn't do anything about it,

2125
01:51:57,295 --> 01:52:01,032
and that makes you an
unconscionable coward.

2126
01:52:02,599 --> 01:52:04,935
And not for nothing, but
"think" is a verb, all right,

2127
01:52:04,936 --> 01:52:06,335
making "different" an adverb.

2128
01:52:06,336 --> 01:52:08,304
You're asking people to think differently.

2129
01:52:08,305 --> 01:52:10,106
And you can talk about the Bauhaus movement

2130
01:52:10,107 --> 01:52:12,107
and Braun and "Simplicity
is sophistication"

2131
01:52:12,108 --> 01:52:15,445
and Issey Miyake uniforms and
Bob Dylan lyrics all you want,

2132
01:52:15,446 --> 01:52:20,151
but that thing looks like
Judy Jetson's Easy-Bake oven.

2133
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:40,536
Hey.

2134
01:52:40,537 --> 01:52:43,138
You're gonna start late.

2135
01:52:43,139 --> 01:52:45,342
- You know what Lisa stood for?
- What?

2136
01:52:45,343 --> 01:52:47,544
The computer. The Lisa.
You know what it stood for?

2137
01:52:47,545 --> 01:52:50,679
I'm sorry I said that about the
iMac. It's not what I really think.

2138
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:54,683
Behind my back, at the office,
you know what it stood for?

2139
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:58,253
Local Integrated System
Architecture. I was five.

2140
01:52:58,254 --> 01:53:00,957
- Why couldn't you just lie?
- I did.

2141
01:53:01,992 --> 01:53:04,227
Of course it was named after you.

2142
01:53:04,228 --> 01:53:09,132
Local Integrated System Architecture
doesn't even mean anything.

2143
01:53:09,133 --> 01:53:12,068
Why'd you say it wasn't all those years?

2144
01:53:14,071 --> 01:53:15,973
I honestly don't know.

2145
01:53:18,275 --> 01:53:20,745
Why'd you say you weren't my father?

2146
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,150
I'm poorly made.

2147
01:53:33,656 --> 01:53:37,194
- It's after 9:00. You're gonna be late.
- I don't care.

2148
01:53:42,366 --> 01:53:44,467
- You're writing for the <i>Crimson.</i>
- What?

2149
01:53:44,468 --> 01:53:46,535
The Apple chapter of the
Harvard Alumni Association

2150
01:53:46,536 --> 01:53:48,370
tells me you're writing
for the <i>Crimson.</i>

2151
01:53:48,371 --> 01:53:52,042
Oh. Yeah, a little bit. Essays.

2152
01:53:52,043 --> 01:53:54,811
- I'd like to read one.
- Sure.

2153
01:53:54,812 --> 01:53:57,280
No, I mean now. I'd like to
read one of your essays now.

2154
01:53:57,281 --> 01:53:59,717
Come on. You've got to go on stage.

2155
01:54:01,317 --> 01:54:04,320
The iMac will not be launched until
you give me one of your essays,

2156
01:54:04,321 --> 01:54:07,992
so the world is waiting for you.

2157
01:54:14,598 --> 01:54:17,633
I'm really sorry, guys.

2158
01:54:17,634 --> 01:54:19,202
Good luck.

2159
01:54:32,148 --> 01:54:33,716
I'm gonna put music in your pocket.

2160
01:54:33,717 --> 01:54:35,820
What?

2161
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:41,790
Hundred songs. A thousand songs. 500 songs.

2162
01:54:41,791 --> 01:54:46,161
Somewhere between 500 and a
thousand songs right in your pocket,

2163
01:54:46,162 --> 01:54:49,499
'cause I can't stand looking at
that inexplicable Walkman anymore.

2164
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,767
You're carrying around a
brick playing cassette tape.

2165

We're not savages.

2166
01:54:53,637 --> 01:54:56,806
So I'm gonna put a thousand
songs in your pocket.

2167
01:54:56,807 --> 01:54:59,441
