1
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,638
No!

2
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,106
No!

3
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,677
No!

4
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:38,660
Mom.

5
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,965
This is stupid.

6
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,199
Look, four nights.

7
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:51,405
We get in, we pack,
we're out Monday.

8
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,710
We're four days away from

9
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:57,945
putting this whole place
behind us for good.

10
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,687
Besides...

11
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,722
Liz'll be there.

12
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,358
If you get sick of us,

13
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,359
at least you'll have
somebody your own age

14
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,528
to be moody with.

15
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:16,329
Great. Just great.

16
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,435
-Aden.
-What?!

17
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,481
Okay.

18
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:02,043
Aden, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

19
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,681
Can you go any faster?

20
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:07,915
It's not gonna
do us any good

21
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,584
if I drive off the road.

22
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,353
Everything's gonna be all right.

23
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,591
You're safe now.

24
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,559
Spread your legs.

25
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,664
Hey.

26
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:01,869
Hey, hey!

27
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:03,971
Hey!

28
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,609
Aden, no, don't
touch that. Don't touch that!

29
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,711
- Whoa, whoa.
- Don't touch that.

30
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,014
Really, Mom?

31
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,851
It's just a gift basket.

32
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,387
- Right.
- Come on.

33
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:23,390
People give stuff to folks
that are grieving.

34
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,892
All right, just-- Okay.

35
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,994
Just let me take care of it.
Get inside.

36
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:11,098
Aden?

37
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,190
Hey!

38
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,525
You ready for dinner?

39
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,060
Jesus, Mom.

40
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:40,995
- Fuck!
- Jesus, Aden, are you okay?

41
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,663
Just get out of here, just--

42
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:44,231
just leave me alone, please.

43
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:47,101
Okay. Just try
and take a deep breath.

44
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:50,538
All right, baby,
now name five things

45
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,139
you can see in the room, okay?

46
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:54,775
Um...

47
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:55,910
table.

48
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,146
Um, candle holder.

49
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,620
My dead fucking dad!

50
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,156
Hey, hey, hey! Baby, come here.

51
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:13,027
Good job.
Okay, breathe, breathe.

52
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,563
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

53
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,798
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

54
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,735
I'm right here, okay?

55
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,504
I'm sorry.

56
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,910
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

57
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,179
I'm not going anywhere.

58
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,011
I remember this one.

59
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,314
This was really good.

60
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:49,984
- Hmm?
- Hey.

61
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,887
Can you--

62
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,089
can you make this tonight?

63
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,928
-Earth to Mom?
-Uh, yeah.

64
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,197
I think so.

65
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:05,432
Cool.

66
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,389
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

67
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,858
<i>I think we took a wrong turn</i>
<i>at the tractor pool.</i>

68
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,726
<i>Can you meet us in town?</i>

69
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,362
Of course.
I'll meet you at the diner.

70
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:36,764
<i>Which diner?</i>

71
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,899
There's only one.

72
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,724
Aden?

73
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,259
Yeah?

74
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,862
I'm headed into town.
Do you wanna come?

75
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,065
I'm good.

76
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,034
Okay, I'll bring back lunch.

77
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,370
Be safe.

78
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,569
Hey, Sarah.

79
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:51,071
Oh!

80
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:54,576
So, is cow-tipping
a favorite pastime around here?

81
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:58,412
Mama, you know you can't
actually tip a cow, right?

82
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,248
But we can tip our waitress.

83
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,551
What do you want,
daughter of mine?

84
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,953
The menu hasn't changed much.

85
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,921
I could probably
recommend something.

86
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:12,793
Yep. No more wobble.

87
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:14,795
-Hi.
-Hi.

88
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,431
- Where's Aden?
- Back at the house.

89
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,933
So you're getting crickets

90
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,335
and your daughter's eating ants?

91
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,203
Sour cream and onion crickets.

92
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,438
- Oh, my God, no!
- They're pretty good.

93
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,839
You're sick!

94
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:58,005
Fresh.

95
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,343
Really?

96
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,411
Well, I expected it
to be a little more farm-y.

97
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,247
-Oh, you got a little, uh--
-What?

98
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,650
Is it a tick?
Is it-- What is it?

99
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:10,518
Oh.

100
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,521
Hey.

101
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,223
Why don't you take
your stuff upstairs, guys,

102
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,225
and there's a picnic table
in the back

103
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:21,395
where we can eat,
and I will get us some wine.

104
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,497
Oh, did I forget to mention
there's no service?

105
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,300
Just a couple of days.
You'll be fine.

106
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,570
He sacrificed
everything for you

107
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:30,437
so you could become a man.

108
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,272
I know this has
been hard on you.

109
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,174
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

110
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,143
-Why are you talking to him?
-Oh, hello, Sarah--

111
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,011
No, no.
You don't get to talk to me.

112
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,914
- Sarah, I--
- Stop. You can't be here.

113
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,182
-He was just helping me--
-Aden!

114
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,586
- I only want--
- Now please leave!

115
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,019
- I only wanted to--
- Stop!

116
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,956
I asked you to leave.
Now get off my land.

117
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,326
You mean... his land?

118
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,563
Leave us alone.

119
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,464
And if I ever
see you here again--

120
00:14:57,498 --> 00:15:00,200
-Mom!
-Aden, inside! Now.

121
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,169
It's all right, Aden.
We can talk later.

122
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:05,105
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth right now!

123
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,375
She told you to leave.

124
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,957
Who was that?

125
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,130
Aden?

126
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:37,705
Aden.

127
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:42,976
Talk to me.

128
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:46,947
He told me.

129
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,321
About Dad.

130
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:26,220
Your father...

131
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,625
Josef...

132
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,234
I thought he loved you.

133
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,141
I thought he loved me.

134
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,579
And I was wrong.

135
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:56,751
I'm sorry.

136
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,790
He wasn't a good person.

137
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,463
Am I?

138
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,504
Am I a good person?

139
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,680
Of course you are!

140
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:36,490
I'm hurting, doc.

141
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:38,292
- What do you got for me?
- No, uh-uh.

142
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,762
Your feelings are getting
nowhere near my notepad.

143
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:42,597
I would never.

144
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,566
Jordan, your wife is
as compassionate as always.

145
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,500
-Damn right.
-Mm-hmm.

146
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:50,170
Hey, so, uh, how's Aden doing?

147
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,407
I wish I knew.

148
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,211
I'm gonna go
get us some more wine.

149
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,479
Sarah, hold up.

150
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,484
We should really get to work.

151
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,320
Hey, I wouldn't
say no to more wine.

152
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,790
Wine she found in exchange
for days of cleaning.

153
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:10,692
- Babe.
- Hey, come on.

154
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,192
It feels like
I'm back in the Navy.

155
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,628
Liam, you were an officer.

156
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:15,462
The only thing
you had to keep clean

157
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,331
were those fancy rank boards
and your choker whites.

158
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:20,602
Well, can we, like,
go look for Aden or something?

159
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:21,869
He'll be back when he's ready.

160
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,470
Well, we all know

161
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,372
what boys like to do
in the woods.

162
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,474
- Gross.
- Yes, gross.

163
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,777
What? It's natural.

164
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:31,779
What's natural?

165
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,963
Mom, look at this.

166
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,648
One, two, three!

167
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:16,684
Oh, my God, it's coming,
it's coming, it's coming!

168
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:39,707
-Holy shit.
-We did it.

169
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,315
We got that down!

170
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:57,290
Hey.

171
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:01,629
Hey.

172
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:03,598
Thanks for giving
my moms your room.

173
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:06,567
Yeah. Course.

174
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,904
Who was that old dude
you were talking to?

175
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:11,706
Uh...

176
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:14,274
he...

177
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:18,913
he was a friend of my dad's.

178
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:22,415
You mean like
one of the crazy ones

179
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,719
our parents think we can't
hear them talking about?

180
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,020
They're not crazy!

181
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,755
Okay, calm down.

182
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:30,825
I'm just saying
the adults talk like they are.

183
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:32,794
They were our family.

184
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,029
Really?

185
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,998
Yeah.

186
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,076
Hey.

187
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,377
Hey.

188
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:02,957
Taking a break?

189
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:05,927
I've earned it.

190
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,930
Can I have one?

191
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:11,331
A break?

192
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,366
Or a drink?

193
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:27,081
-Just don't tell Aden.
-I think he knows you drink.

194
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:30,450
Not whiskey straight,
no, he does not.

195
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,720
Hmm. Our little secret.

196
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:40,761
So, Aden,

197
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:44,765
anything interesting
out in the woods?

198
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:46,901
I guess.

199
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,069
Like what?

200
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,007
Hmm. Well, there was a stream.

201
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:56,577
Um... oh, the ring of trees.

202
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:59,013
I don't know. Nature.

203
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,782
He's always loved being outside.

204
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:03,551
Yeah,
not where we live now.

205
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:04,819
Why not?

206
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:07,054
-Too good for city life?
-Liz!

207
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:09,724
It's just... dirty.

208
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:11,592
This place is dirty.

209
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:13,661
- Not when Dad was here.
- Aden.

210
00:23:14,662 --> 00:23:15,730
What?

211
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:18,866
Come on. I wasn't that young
when we left.

212
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,401
I remember
how things used to be.

213
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,938
It sounds like your dad
ran a pretty tight ship.

214
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:27,474
Yeah, I mean, he did, but...

215
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:29,877
he always made time
to spend with the family.

216
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:35,883
I was the one
who kept our house.

217
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:38,953
Mom, I...

218
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,456
I better take care
of these dishes.

219
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,558
I can dry?

220
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:57,765
So.

221
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:01,769
Yeah?

222
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:03,137
Didn't see you at my party.

223
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:05,873
Party?

224
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:07,775
I didn't invite you.

225
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:10,945
I should have.

226
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:13,581
I'll make sure
you know about the next one.

227
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:15,816
Thanks.

228
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:19,020
I don't, um...

229
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:23,724
I'm not big on parties.

230
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,826
Why?

231
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:36,170
Well,

232
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,739
anyways,
it was a pretty lame party.

233
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:40,241
Awful, really.

234
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:42,009
Why?

235
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:46,280
There was a boy
I wanted to come,

236
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:48,682
but didn't.

237
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,585
- Really?
- Yeah.

238
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:55,056
Not you, stupid.

239
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:56,157
Yeah.

240
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,829
And moms came back early.

241
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:03,864
Kind of ruined the whole thing.

242
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:07,301
Not really selling
the whole party thing.

243
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:18,612
How about...

244
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:21,782
if I ever throw a party...

245
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:24,585
you can be the guest of honor.

246
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,955
All right, cool.

247
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,161
Maybe you could
have it out here.

248
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,698
Kind of pretty.

249
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:35,022
What the hell?

250
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:36,957
Do you have any idea
what fucking time it is?

251
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:39,460
Kill that fucking engine before

252
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,362
I get up there
and do it for you!

253
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:43,998
Come on, you crazy asshole!

254
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:51,405
You hick bastard!

255
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:53,340
You ought to see a real machine.
I got one out front!

256
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:56,810
Aden, Aden.
Wake up, wake up.

257
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,379
What the--
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

258
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:00,147
You have to see this.

259
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:05,753
He really is an ape.

260
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:08,956
Yes, he is.

261
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,728
Hey, guys,

262
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:16,363
breakfast is gonna be ready
in just a-- Aden!

263
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:17,831
Put a shirt on!

264
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:20,734
Mom...

265
00:28:29,176 --> 00:28:31,812
Oh, Liz, um,
would you like to help me, um,

266
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,280
come fix up some breakfast?

267
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:34,381
Sure.

268
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:41,922
<i>This is a case</i>
<i>that has a lot of events,</i>

269
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:44,258
<i>but it's really</i>
<i>a crime of revenge.</i>

270
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,759
<i>-It all came...</i>
-Hey.

271
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,996
-You're up early.
-I've been up for a while.

272
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:52,166
This one's your dad, yeah?

273
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:58,506
Do you wanna keep it?

274
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:02,042
I'm gonna go get a shirt.

275
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:07,081
<i>Circumstances have</i>
<i>immediately indicated to us</i>

276
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:08,916
<i>that something else</i>
<i>was happening.</i>

277
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:18,492
I'll have you know,
I make an amazing cup of coffee

278
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:21,061
and an even better Bloody Mary.

279
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:22,963
Just because
you put pickles in it

280
00:29:22,997 --> 00:29:24,298
does not make it food.

281
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:27,234
No, no she's right.

282
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:03,003
Hey. So, last night.

283
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:05,906
Dinner was weird, right?

284
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:07,509
It's none of our business.

285
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:10,377
- Come on, she's our friend.
- Exactly.

286
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:12,246
So if she wanted
to talk about it,

287
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,947
she'd tell us.

288
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,583
We're just here
to help her clean her house.

289
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:18,919
They just really seem
to be having a hard time.

290
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:21,221
Yeah, I can't imagine
what a toll this must be

291
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:23,023
taking on their family.

292
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,894
Really digging
deep there, Rachel.

293
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:34,335
You know,
you don't have to be so...

294
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:36,904
clinical about this.

295
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:39,607
I have been perfectly
helpful this weekend.

296
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,643
Right, but you just
have to make sure

297
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:43,444
I know you're unhappy about it.

298
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,079
I could've come by myself.

299
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:48,115
I would never
let you do this alone.

300
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:51,586
But of course I'm not happy
about it. Why would I be?

301
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:55,356
It's a beautiful weekend that we
could be spending as a family,

302
00:30:55,389 --> 00:31:00,060
and I'm stuck here with a sulky
daughter and a preoccupied wife.

303
00:31:00,094 --> 00:31:03,230
And I have to watch Liam
puppy around after Sarah,

304
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:06,433
who doesn't have time in her
life for another damaged man.

305
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:07,669
It's-- it's--

306
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,138
-What?
-There's a man outside.

307
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,874
- Was it Liam?
- Is everyone okay?

308
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,343
We're fine.

309
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:18,345
Just take a break, babe.

310
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:20,280
And we'll finish up in here.

311
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,645
Whoa.

312
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:53,147
Aden, come look at this.

313
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,349
- Oh!
- Are those real?

314
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:57,418
I was wondering
where these went.

315
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:00,154
Is it-- is it locked?

316
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:02,990
- Oh-ho-ho-ho!
- Hell no.

317
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:04,224
Mama!

318
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:08,061
Aw, Jordan, come on. Be cool.

319
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,532
How 'bout we dust this off and
teach these kids how to shoot?

320
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:12,534
It'll be just like
gun call day on the ship.

321
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:16,270
And afterwards
I'll take 'em to town

322
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:18,071
and get rid of 'em
at the pawn shop.

323
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,109
All right. Okay.

324
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:25,747
You know, sometimes
you're actually pretty cool.

325
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:31,084
Sure. I'm teaching them,
but you're the cool one.

326
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,388
Always.

327
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,672
He's really good at... stapling.

328
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:37,451
May I?

329
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:41,154
After you.

330
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:45,259
She's a bit more
seasoned than I'm used to.

331
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,427
Shooting's just like
riding a bike.

332
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:01,375
Sights must be off,
or something.

333
00:34:01,408 --> 00:34:03,745
Yeah. Sights are off.

334
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:17,825
You got this.

335
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:30,738
So, I'm on the paper.

336
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:33,575
Mm-hmm.

337
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:35,843
What?
You think you can do better?

338
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:38,312
Hey, hey, I didn't say that.

339
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:40,582
Come on, big shooter.
Let's see what you got.

340
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:12,780
That's weird.

341
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:16,283
Sights seem fine to me.

342
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:26,193
Don't say it.

343
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,528
-You shoot...
-Shut up!

344
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:29,363
-...just like an officer.
-Don't.

345
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:32,634
Oh, my God.

346
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:25,687
He never asked me
if I could shoot.

347
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,989
He's trying to bond with you.

348
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:29,824
Great.

349
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,559
I mean, he didn't do
a very good job,

350
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:34,629
but at least you'd know
who'd win in a fight.

351
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,941
Wanna see something cool?

352
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:48,910
Sure.

353
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:18,539
-Surprise!
-Maddy.

354
00:37:18,573 --> 00:37:20,708
Can't I surprise
my big sister?

355
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:22,543
Of course you can.

356
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:25,613
Because you sure
surprised me by coming here.

357
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:28,015
It's complicated.

358
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:29,517
Seems pretty simple.

359
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,818
Explain it to me.

360
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:32,653
Sarah, have you seen Liz--

361
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:35,923
Oh, hello, Madelyn.

362
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,325
Hi, Rachel.

363
00:37:48,669 --> 00:37:49,904
What is it?

364
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:52,472
It's old.

365
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,544
Duh. You found this place?

366
00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:58,679
Years ago.

367
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:01,048
Before we left.

368
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:04,952
Does your mom
know about this?

369
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:12,392
I don't know. Is it safe?

370
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:14,327
Hmm.

371
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:19,499
Seems fine to me.

372
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:22,637
Come on. Don't be scared.

373
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:26,439
All right.

374
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,812
Madelyn. Nice of you to join us.

375
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:32,345
Eat shit, Liam.

376
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:40,955
How did you let this happen?

377
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,090
Me? She's your sister.

378
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,092
Yeah, don't I fucking know it.

379
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,096
Where the hell is Aden?

380
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:51,933
Why are you always
missing school?

381
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,938
I don't want
people to talk.

382
00:38:57,905 --> 00:38:59,674
Nobody talks about you.

383
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:04,344
I won't tell anyone.

384
00:39:12,753 --> 00:39:13,855
I see someone.

385
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:17,692
Like a shrink?

386
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:22,663
Kinda.

387
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:27,535
Wanna know a secret?

388
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:29,904
Sure.

389
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:32,607
I see one, too.

390
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:37,845
Why?

391
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:11,712
I hate it.

392
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,184
It makes me feel like there's...

393
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:20,655
something wrong with me.

394
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,991
Aden, that's not--

395
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:27,494
There's nothing wrong with you.

396
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:35,670
My dad
used to tell me a story.

397
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:41,075
That if you had a weakness...

398
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:45,646
a sin...

399
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:48,916
that you had to live with...

400
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:52,086
it wasn't always your fault.

401
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:57,758
It was separate from you.

402
00:41:01,762 --> 00:41:03,030
And it could be removed...

403
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,466
if someone
would take it from you.

404
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,875
It might be willing,
but it didn't have to be.

405
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:17,979
It could be an animal,
it could be...

406
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:21,849
someone else.

407
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:25,820
You could give them your sin.

408
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:28,990
Somehow.

409
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:33,561
Give me my sin again.

410
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:34,662
Yeah, it's...

411
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:38,566
not quite <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

412
00:41:43,304 --> 00:41:44,839
This...

413
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:47,975
sin eater...

414
00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:52,580
would absolve you
of whatever you did.

415
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:57,818
Then they would be sacrificed...

416
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:02,556
protecting you
from your mistakes

417
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,758
in this world...

418
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:09,163
and the world to come.

419
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,302
Can I get
a pair of hands in here?

420
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:18,973
Can you grab me the paprika?

421
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:22,910
I thought you didn't want
anything to do with him.

422
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,580
-I don't, I just--
-Hmm?

423
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:28,816
Aden asked for one
of the meals in there.

424
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:30,051
So what?

425
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:32,987
Just leave it be, Maddy.

426
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,622
Frankly, Sarah, no.

427
00:42:34,655 --> 00:42:35,856
I didn't help you
escape this place

428
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,191
just for you to come back.

429
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:41,662
Josef is gone...

430
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,298
and I know what I'm doing.

431
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:46,200
Sarah, do you remember

432
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:48,169
what you were like
when I took you in?

433
00:42:48,202 --> 00:42:49,870
Yes, you never let me forget it.

434
00:42:49,904 --> 00:42:52,106
Then why?
Why didn't you let me come?

435
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:54,041
-Everybody else is here--
-Because I didn't want

436
00:42:54,075 --> 00:42:56,844
my little sister swooping in
to take care of me again.

437
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:59,613
I just don't understand.

438
00:42:59,647 --> 00:43:02,083
Why are you here?
Why are <i>you</i> here?

439
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:08,022
I need the money.

440
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:11,225
- I can lend you money.
- You don't--

441
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:13,260
you don't get it.

442
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:15,696
I know that
you think that you do,

443
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:17,098
but you don't know
what it was like.

444
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:20,301
Nobody knows what it was like.

445
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:23,637
Ah! I don't even know
what it was like.

446
00:43:23,671 --> 00:43:25,773
I can't remember everything
and I just...

447
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,010
I just want to know
what happened to me here.

448
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:31,879
-Bad shit.
-Wow! Thanks, Maddy.

449
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:33,047
That's really helpful.

450
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:34,682
You have a child.

451
00:43:35,116 --> 00:43:36,650
Stop acting like one.

452
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:38,319
Mom?

453
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:39,987
Is that Aunt Madelyn's car?

454
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,657
Aden!

455
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:47,128
Aunt Madelyn.
I thought you couldn't make it.

456
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:48,863
I pulled some strings at work

457
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:50,764
as soon as I found out
you guys were here.

458
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:52,867
I guess your mom just
couldn't wait to get started.

459
00:43:53,868 --> 00:43:56,337
Aden, why don't you take
your aunt's bag upstairs?

460
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:58,072
She'll stay in my room.

461
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:02,309
-Why not?
-Lead the way, kiddo.

462
00:44:04,345 --> 00:44:05,746
What was that?

463
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,263
So, did you get all those guns
from the basement pawned?

464
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:24,031
Yep, I did.

465
00:44:24,732 --> 00:44:28,068
Oh, you didn't want to
take one home to practice?

466
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:30,704
No.

467
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:33,774
Does everybody have
something to drink?

468
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,242
Mm-hmm.

469
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:38,379
So, after dinner...

470
00:44:40,748 --> 00:44:42,249
are we gonna take
a couple more loads out?

471
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:45,853
I was thinking
that we might have a fire.

472
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,422
I like it.

473
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:50,191
Great.

474
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:51,959
You deserve a break.

475
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,061
Lighten up, Madelyn.

476
00:44:54,094 --> 00:44:55,763
Yeah, you just got here.

477
00:44:55,796 --> 00:44:57,865
Whose fault is that?

478
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:05,973
Sarah, this is a lot of meat.

479
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:15,249
So, Aden.

480
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:19,086
Where'd you learn to shoot?

481
00:45:19,654 --> 00:45:23,057
Oh, um, Dad used to
take me hunting.

482
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:24,725
Why?

483
00:45:25,259 --> 00:45:27,228
Would have been good to know,

484
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:30,798
like when I said
we'd teach you how to shoot.

485
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:32,333
Yeah, great idea, by the way.

486
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:34,001
I didn't even touch one, Mom.

487
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:36,103
Yeah, Liam really
had a monopoly.

488
00:45:36,605 --> 00:45:40,274
Hey, Mom, maybe he could show
you how to use that little

489
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:42,544
-pea shooter in your purse.
-Aden.

490
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:44,546
Actually,
maybe I should show you.

491
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,981
-Dude, you're really pushing it.
-You're not my dad.

492
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:48,983
Yeah. I wouldn't let you
behave this way.

493
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,418
My father was ten times
the man you are.

494
00:45:51,452 --> 00:45:52,520
Yeah, was.

495
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:12,139
Sarah, I am so sorry.

496
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:13,575
Go apologize to my son.

497
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:15,209
-Sarah, I didn't mean to--
-Please.

498
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:18,012
Yeah, of course.

499
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:25,953
Excuse me.

500
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:45,406
Come out here
to insult my family some more?

501
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:49,544
- No, I'm sorry--
- No, you're not.

502
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,480
I just lost my temper.

503
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:57,519
No shit.

504
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:02,890
Can I be honest with you?

505
00:47:08,062 --> 00:47:09,196
Yeah.

506
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:14,101
I don't need a new dad.

507
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:22,309
Every guy that comes around
and just sees us as these two...

508
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:27,314
broken things...

509
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:30,084
that they can protect...

510
00:47:31,952 --> 00:47:33,220
and fix.

511
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,926
I don't need to be fixed.

512
00:47:43,531 --> 00:47:45,432
Kid, I can't even fix myself.

513
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:51,105
And I'm not trying
to replace anyone.

514
00:47:58,479 --> 00:48:02,015
Aden...
I really like your mom.

515
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:05,152
Can you give me a chance?

516
00:48:15,663 --> 00:48:16,997
Why not?

517
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,093
Hello?

518
00:48:54,201 --> 00:48:55,537
So imagine, okay,

519
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,371
she scared
the bejesus out of me.

520
00:48:57,404 --> 00:49:00,174
So there's Liz, four years old,

521
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:02,176
crying her eyes out.

522
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:04,211
She's covered
in spaghetti sauce.

523
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:07,749
I mean,
just dripping with the stuff,

524
00:49:07,782 --> 00:49:12,019
all because she wanted to try
making a pasta smoothie.

525
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:13,555
Mama.

526
00:49:13,588 --> 00:49:15,557
We're still cleaning it up.

527
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:18,125
And that is why
we don't cook anymore.

528
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:20,562
It would be nice
to do a few meals at home.

529
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:23,363
It would be nice
to have a refill.

530
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:25,533
Nice. Real nice.

531
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:28,168
Moms of the year up in here.

532
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:30,137
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

533
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,443
Oh, my goodness.

534
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:43,016
Is all quiet
on the western front?

535
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,021
- We're facing south.
- Oh.

536
00:49:51,526 --> 00:49:54,394
So, why aren't you at the fire?

537
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:56,631
You're not either.

538
00:50:00,768 --> 00:50:02,269
I miss you, you know.

539
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:06,708
- What?
- You and your mom.

540
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:10,678
She shouldn't have
brought you here.

541
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:15,082
- It's fine.
- It's not.

542
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:18,352
I know you're putting on
this tough guy face,

543
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:20,522
but when your mom
was in recovery,

544
00:50:20,555 --> 00:50:22,289
it was just you and me
for the whole year.

545
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:25,292
I know you, kiddo.

546
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:30,330
Mom...

547
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:34,268
she doesn't know
what she's doing.

548
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,273
She thinks that
getting rid of this place

549
00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:40,608
is gonna fix everything.

550
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,177
But I know better.

551
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:48,716
Don't say that.

552
00:50:50,284 --> 00:50:51,786
I care too much
about the both of you

553
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:53,453
to let you take this on alone.

554
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:57,190
I love you.

555
00:51:01,128 --> 00:51:02,296
I know you do.

556
00:51:51,813 --> 00:51:53,681
We're gonna
have to carry them in

557
00:51:53,715 --> 00:51:54,782
when they're finally done.

558
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:58,720
I know.

559
00:52:07,629 --> 00:52:08,730
You want some?

560
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:11,498
What?

561
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:13,400
Have some with me.

562
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,476
Well?

563
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,583
Okay.

564
00:52:28,616 --> 00:52:30,183
I-- I never did this before.

565
00:52:30,818 --> 00:52:32,620
You were gonna shoot a gun

566
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:34,789
and you don't know
how to shoot a bottle rocket?

567
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:36,356
I read the manual.

568
00:52:36,858 --> 00:52:38,258
For the bottle rocket?

569
00:52:38,693 --> 00:52:41,562
For the peashooter, stupid!

570
00:52:41,596 --> 00:52:42,964
Do I need
to give you a safety glass?

571
00:52:42,997 --> 00:52:44,699
No. Give me the lighter.

572
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:46,400
-Give me the lighter, please!
-No, no, no.

573
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:47,802
You hold the bottle.
You hold the bottle.

574
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:50,705
Steady, steady.

575
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:52,239
All right,
don't point it at me.

576
00:52:52,272 --> 00:52:53,508
- No.
- All right.

577
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:54,642
Is it gonna--

578
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:56,376
Wait.

579
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:13,226
- Oh!
- Hey, hey, hey.

580
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,697
Ooh! Ooh!
-Told you, you can't do it.

581
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,230
I should've never doubted you.

582
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:18,900
Damn right!

583
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:23,437
I have to get a refill.

584
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,673
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, are you drunk?

585
00:53:25,707 --> 00:53:26,974
Good night.

586
00:53:34,816 --> 00:53:36,984
Shh, we're good.
Shh, we're good.

587
00:53:37,018 --> 00:53:38,452
Night.

588
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:39,954
Do they still want--

589
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:42,456
Oh, yeah, go for it.
Go for it.

590
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:11,652
- Come on.
- You sure?

591
00:54:11,686 --> 00:54:12,820
Mm-hmm.

592
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,994
Shh.

593
00:54:23,998 --> 00:54:26,466
-Oh, sexy!
-Yeah?

594
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:31,906
Oh, sorry.

595
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,608
No, no, it's okay.

596
00:54:33,641 --> 00:54:35,610
This is what these freaks do.

597
00:54:35,977 --> 00:54:37,845
They leave freaky baskets.

598
00:54:41,582 --> 00:54:42,717
This is, like...

599
00:54:43,885 --> 00:54:45,485
a shit-ton of food.

600
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,722
I don't care what they do.

601
00:54:47,755 --> 00:54:49,724
As long as
they stay away from Aden.

602
00:54:51,424 --> 00:54:53,628
Who? The freaks your husband
used to hang out with?

603
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:57,899
Ex-husband.

604
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:00,433
Sarah.

605
00:55:02,036 --> 00:55:06,040
He was-- he was part of this,
like, intense religious group.

606
00:55:07,642 --> 00:55:08,843
Like a cult?

607
00:55:10,945 --> 00:55:13,080
Beyond that. It was like a...

608
00:55:14,582 --> 00:55:17,718
a generational mini-society...

609
00:55:18,553 --> 00:55:19,987
that you're born into.

610
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:22,455
And they live here?

611
00:55:26,661 --> 00:55:27,829
I was so young.

612
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:31,464
And before I knew it...

613
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:36,469
we were married.

614
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:44,545
Then my whole life
just became, um...

615
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,747
family.

616
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:48,883
Family.

617
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,655
And everything else was, uh...

618
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:57,091
choked out.

619
00:56:03,698 --> 00:56:07,001
And they were all
that I had left, so...

620
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,542
God.

621
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:19,379
Can you believe
I thought I was happy?

622
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:23,684
I'm so freaking stupid.

623
00:56:23,718 --> 00:56:25,553
Hey, Sarah--

624
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:28,689
No, because if Aden
had never gotten sick--

625
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:29,757
Hey.

626
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:32,026
You did what you could.

627
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:34,629
You got out.

628
00:56:37,198 --> 00:56:38,799
Then I came right back.

629
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:05,726
Hey!

630
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:08,195
What-- what are you doing?
Are you insane?

631
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:10,698
Are you?
They brought this, didn't they?

632
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:12,833
-Stop it, Maddy.
-No, stop it.

633
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:14,035
Hey!

634
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:16,537
When were you
gonna tell me about this?

635
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,639
It-- it's just some baskets.

636
00:57:18,673 --> 00:57:20,074
Look, it's nothing threatening.

637
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:22,043
Sarah. What were you thinking?

638
00:57:22,076 --> 00:57:23,744
I just-- it was an easy way

639
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:25,613
to keep everybody fed
this weekend.

640
00:57:25,646 --> 00:57:28,916
I will go into town
and get us some fucking pizza.

641
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,151
Stupid bitch.

642
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:56,210
So fucking creepy.

643
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:58,546
One more day, babe.

644
00:58:05,086 --> 00:58:07,788
Are you sure
you don't want to take him home?

645
00:58:08,222 --> 00:58:12,059
At this point, I'm not sure
I want to take you home.

646
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:15,296
Look how cute he is.

647
00:58:24,939 --> 00:58:26,307
I'll be back soon.

648
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:24,024
Hi, Officer.

649
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:25,292
Got you going
pretty fast back there, ma'am.

650
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:27,328
Yeah, I'm not from around here.

651
01:00:27,361 --> 01:00:29,396
Hmm. I bet.

652
01:00:29,897 --> 01:00:31,899
License
and registration, please.

653
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:33,134
Yeah, of course.

654
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,743
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
you to step out of your vehicle.

655
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:44,945
Wait, why?

656
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:37,364
Please! Help me!

657
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,201
You sons of bitches!

658
01:01:43,837 --> 01:01:44,905
Anything?

659
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,308
It's voicemail again.

660
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:53,847
She said she was just going
to get some groceries.

661
01:01:54,215 --> 01:01:55,282
Yeah, I know.

662
01:01:58,852 --> 01:02:00,387
If it makes you feel any better,

663
01:02:00,421 --> 01:02:02,356
I can go into town
and see if I can find her?

664
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:05,492
I mean, there's only one
grocery store, right?

665
01:02:08,495 --> 01:02:09,763
Thank you.

666
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:18,299
Please tell me
Liam went to get food?

667
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:22,803
Who died?

668
01:03:34,915 --> 01:03:36,317
It is getting late.

669
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,085
We need to feed these two.

670
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:41,288
I'll just order something.

671
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,892
No one will deliver out here.

672
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:47,161
Let my wife work her magic.

673
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:50,532
So, Mom, how'd you do it?

674
01:03:51,165 --> 01:03:53,334
A magician
never reveals her secrets.

675
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,204
I'm gonna try calling again.

676
01:03:59,306 --> 01:04:00,374
Don't worry, Mom.

677
01:04:01,576 --> 01:04:02,876
They'll be back soon.

678
01:04:04,211 --> 01:04:05,879
Yeah, definitely.

679
01:04:06,413 --> 01:04:07,881
Let's get these kids
to bed, huh?

680
01:04:37,911 --> 01:04:40,682
No, don't. Please!
Stop, stop, stop, stop it.

681
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:45,085
No, no, no, no, no
you don't have to do this,

682
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,888
you don't have to do this,
please.

683
01:04:53,093 --> 01:04:54,194
No, please.

684
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:06,407
-Shh!
-What are you doing?

685
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,975
-They're in the house.
-What?

686
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:09,443
Come on.
You need to get out of here.

687
01:05:09,476 --> 01:05:10,645
What about my moms?

688
01:05:24,324 --> 01:05:25,926
Liz, wait!

689
01:05:29,396 --> 01:05:31,533
- What the hell is going on?
- Quiet.

690
01:05:31,566 --> 01:05:33,701
-We gotta go. Now.
-No shit.

691
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,383
Come on.
Come on, come on.

692
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:51,719
This way, come on, come on.

693
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:56,724
Sarah?

694
01:05:57,458 --> 01:06:00,595
Sarah? Sarah? Sarah!

695
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:02,329
Jordan, they're coming.

696
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:08,001
Mom!

697
01:06:35,395 --> 01:06:37,665
There's no time!

698
01:07:40,828 --> 01:07:42,129
Damn it.

699
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:06,688
I know you're in here.

700
01:08:08,623 --> 01:08:10,157
I can hear you breathing.

701
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,182
Aden, Aden, stop.

702
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:10,918
- Aden!
- We have to keep moving.

703
01:09:10,952 --> 01:09:12,553
What about my moms?

704
01:09:12,587 --> 01:09:13,955
They'd want you to keep going.

705
01:09:13,988 --> 01:09:15,255
-I can't leave them.
-You have to.

706
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:20,762
Hey, Liz, Liz,
look at me, look at me, Liz.

707
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:27,234
When did you have time
to put shoes on?

708
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:29,637
You're hurting me.

709
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:36,577
You better run!

710
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:46,921
Sarah. Sarah.
Thank God you're awake.

711
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:49,590
- Where's Aden?
- I don't know.

712
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:51,391
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

713
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:52,894
I've been alone in here
for hours.

714
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:54,194
Aden?

715
01:09:54,696 --> 01:09:56,263
-Aden?
-Sarah.

716
01:09:56,296 --> 01:09:57,598
Nobody can hear us.

717
01:09:57,632 --> 01:09:59,000
No, no, no, no.

718
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:00,702
This can't be happening.

719
01:10:01,903 --> 01:10:03,805
I told you
not to come back here.

720
01:10:04,237 --> 01:10:06,373
I just wanted my life back.

721
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:08,676
You had it.

722
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:10,578
You were free.

723
01:10:11,012 --> 01:10:13,815
This whole
coming back here thing?

724
01:10:13,848 --> 01:10:15,783
It's sick. You're sick.

725
01:10:15,817 --> 01:10:16,984
I'm sorry.

726
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,220
You should be.

727
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:25,927
Where's your gun?

728
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:30,230
They took it.

729
01:10:32,499 --> 01:10:34,736
-Where are we going?
-Not much further now.

730
01:10:34,769 --> 01:10:36,704
What the--

731
01:10:36,738 --> 01:10:38,673
- Shh!
- Aden.

732
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:46,379
Are you ready?

733
01:10:54,555 --> 01:10:55,590
Hey.

734
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:57,725
Hey.

735
01:10:57,759 --> 01:10:59,227
Liz, look at me.

736
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,429
This is why we're here.

737
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:05,600
What are you talking about?

738
01:11:06,534 --> 01:11:07,602
Liz.

739
01:11:08,836 --> 01:11:10,571
This is my party, Liz.

740
01:11:12,807 --> 01:11:14,307
And you're the guest of honor.

741
01:11:19,914 --> 01:11:22,784
Aden, what are you doing?

742
01:11:22,817 --> 01:11:24,986
Help me!

743
01:12:22,877 --> 01:12:25,546
Help me, please.

744
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:27,515
Please, let me go.

745
01:12:30,618 --> 01:12:33,754
Please, help me, please,

746
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:36,090
I just wanna go home.

747
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:39,026
Mom!

748
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:41,696
Mom!

749
01:12:42,997 --> 01:12:47,034
Why-- why are you doing this?

750
01:12:47,068 --> 01:12:51,105
Please! Please stop!

751
01:12:51,138 --> 01:12:54,075
Please! Please!

752
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:57,612
Why?

753
01:12:58,646 --> 01:13:02,516
No, no, no.

754
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:03,618
Drink.

755
01:13:07,688 --> 01:13:10,758
-No! No, please!
-You have been chosen.

756
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,798
The families
have gathered for you.

757
01:13:18,966 --> 01:13:20,101
Are you prepared?

758
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:24,404
Yes.

759
01:13:32,046 --> 01:13:33,180
Wait here.

760
01:13:37,018 --> 01:13:39,452
What?

761
01:13:39,486 --> 01:13:40,955
Your life will be better.

762
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:43,658
You have been chosen
to be one of the family.

763
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:45,726
The ritual can begin.

764
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,995
She has been chosen.

765
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:52,066
Chosen. Chosen.

766
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:53,935
She has been chosen.

767
01:13:53,968 --> 01:13:56,671
-She has been chosen.
-She's been chosen.

768
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:02,475
Are you-- wait...

769
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:06,514
You are starting down the path

770
01:14:06,547 --> 01:14:09,250
to become
one of our sisters.

771
01:14:09,283 --> 01:14:11,786
Chosen.
She has been chosen.

772
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:13,187
She's been chosen.

773
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,555
You've been chosen.

774
01:14:15,623 --> 01:14:19,627
We will prepare you
your first steps.

775
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,696
She's been chosen.

776
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:24,799
This is your path,
as it was ours.

777
01:14:27,835 --> 01:14:29,203
The family will care for you.

778
01:14:29,236 --> 01:14:34,175
She's been chosen.

779
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:37,011
You will come
to love and trust the family...

780
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:39,680
as we all have.

781
01:14:42,016 --> 01:14:43,517
For the family.

782
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,842
Are you nervous,
young?

783
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:10,211
A little.

784
01:15:11,012 --> 01:15:12,546
There's no reason to be.

785
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,281
Your time preparing
was well spent.

786
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:16,684
We've arranged everything.

787
01:15:17,818 --> 01:15:19,286
Though, we were disappointed

788
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:23,024
to have a few
unforeseen ends to tie up.

789
01:15:23,057 --> 01:15:24,125
I'm sorry, I--

790
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,762
didn't know
my aunt Madelyn was coming.

791
01:15:28,629 --> 01:15:29,964
Or the girl.

792
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:32,800
Other arrangements have been
made for your guest of honor.

793
01:15:41,776 --> 01:15:43,077
Aden.

794
01:15:44,078 --> 01:15:45,312
Your father would be proud.

795
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:54,221
Young.

796
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:57,658
Your life
as a member of this family

797
01:15:57,691 --> 01:15:59,060
resumes now.

798
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:08,169
Your mother tried to weaken you.

799
01:16:08,202 --> 01:16:09,670
She did not succeed.

800
01:16:12,706 --> 01:16:14,141
I will not fail the family.

801
01:16:17,211 --> 01:16:18,279
Prove it.

802
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:28,789
Hey, big shooter.

803
01:16:29,957 --> 01:16:32,660
Aden? What's going on?

804
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:34,829
I'm joining my true family now.

805
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,815
Aren't you glad
you could help me do that?

806
01:17:53,274 --> 01:17:54,875
I saw you kiss her.

807
01:18:03,117 --> 01:18:05,119
-Aden. You all right?
-Aden. Help us.

808
01:18:06,487 --> 01:18:07,988
Aden, honey?

809
01:18:08,956 --> 01:18:10,057
Aden, what the hell?

810
01:18:13,528 --> 01:18:14,795
Hi, Mom.

811
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:17,164
I know you tried.

812
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:20,134
You've always wanted

813
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:21,702
what you thought
was best for me.

814
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:24,271
And for the longest time...

815
01:18:25,806 --> 01:18:26,907
I was afraid I'd...

816
01:18:27,509 --> 01:18:29,343
never be the man
Dad wanted me to be.

817
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:31,212
Who gives a shit about him?
She's your mother.

818
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:33,080
Stay out
of my family's business!

819
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:35,416
You show up uninvited to what?

820
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:36,717
Huh?

821
01:18:37,318 --> 01:18:39,053
Steal me from my family again?

822
01:18:43,224 --> 01:18:45,259
Aden, let us go.
You let us go or--

823
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:47,261
Please, please.

824
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:49,029
- Sarah! Sarah!
- No! Maddy!

825
01:18:49,063 --> 01:18:51,365
Maddy! No!

826
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:53,767
Maddy! Maddy!

827
01:19:13,354 --> 01:19:14,788
Family doesn't give up...

828
01:19:15,489 --> 01:19:16,890
that easily, Mom.

829
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,894
Family doesn't run away.

830
01:19:25,065 --> 01:19:26,800
Family also forgives...

831
01:19:27,535 --> 01:19:28,936
Mom.

832
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:30,804
- Aden, no--
- Mom.

833
01:19:30,838 --> 01:19:32,172
They're forgiving me for you.

834
01:19:33,907 --> 01:19:35,009
For Dad.

835
01:19:39,046 --> 01:19:41,015
And I couldn't have done it
without your help.

836
01:19:43,585 --> 01:19:44,885
Thank you.

837
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,056
Hey, hey.

838
01:19:49,089 --> 01:19:51,058
Hey, hey, it's okay.

839
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,561
You brought me back.

840
01:19:55,129 --> 01:19:56,797
You did everything you could.

841
01:19:58,132 --> 01:19:59,199
Now...

842
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:02,903
Liz and I will pick up...

843
01:20:03,638 --> 01:20:05,306
where you and Dad left off.

844
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,543
Aden, you can't. Aden.

845
01:20:09,877 --> 01:20:11,879
Don't do that to that girl.

846
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:14,348
No, Aden, just look at yourself.

847
01:20:26,193 --> 01:20:27,261
No.

848
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:31,832
Aden, Aden, Aden, Aden.

849
01:20:38,038 --> 01:20:42,142
It's almost over.

850
01:21:16,977 --> 01:21:18,546
-Let's go.
-Wait!

851
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:21,215
-We need to think about this.
-We can't wait.

852
01:21:21,248 --> 01:21:23,183
What? Jordan, no! Wait.

853
01:21:25,386 --> 01:21:26,487
Jordan, wait.

854
01:21:40,602 --> 01:21:42,604
-Liz!
-Liz! Help!

855
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:57,151
Are you okay?

856
01:21:57,652 --> 01:22:00,354
I'm fine, it's nothing.

857
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:06,260
Rachel.

858
01:22:08,663 --> 01:22:10,063
What's wrong?

859
01:22:11,365 --> 01:22:13,934
You just shouldn't have
revealed your secrets.

860
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:17,504
Don't.

861
01:22:20,474 --> 01:22:22,342
Go save our daughter.

862
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,245
I love you.

863
01:22:27,347 --> 01:22:28,550
I love you, too.

864
01:22:41,462 --> 01:22:45,600
No, no, no, no, no, no!

865
01:23:21,603 --> 01:23:23,605
Aden. Where's Liz?

866
01:23:29,309 --> 01:23:30,678
You fought very hard.

867
01:23:31,546 --> 01:23:33,213
You could have escaped,

868
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:36,751
if you'd just left Liz alone.

869
01:23:36,784 --> 01:23:39,754
She's my daughter!
Where is she?

870
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:43,758
-She's safe.
-What did you do to her?

871
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:47,127
She's part of
<i>my</i> family now.

872
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:53,300
Don't worry.

873
01:23:54,234 --> 01:23:56,771
In all the generations
we farmed this land,

874
01:23:56,804 --> 01:23:58,673
we've never had a poor harvest.

875
01:24:00,374 --> 01:24:04,646
You're gonna make
an excellent hunt this year.

876
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,415
Your blood
will fertilize the lands

877
01:24:08,448 --> 01:24:09,717
that feed your daughter.

878
01:24:17,759 --> 01:24:19,561
A mother's place

879
01:24:19,594 --> 01:24:21,529
is to sacrifice
for her children.

880
01:24:23,565 --> 01:24:24,732
Don't you think?

881
01:25:57,457 --> 01:25:59,927
We begin this year's ceremony

882
01:25:59,961 --> 01:26:01,929
with a renewed sense of joy...

883
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:06,668
knowing that our family
will once again be complete.

884
01:26:07,267 --> 01:26:10,938
Tonight, we restore our lost son

885
01:26:10,972 --> 01:26:12,607
to his rightful place.

886
01:26:13,608 --> 01:26:14,876
Our forefathers,

887
01:26:15,342 --> 01:26:18,378
they knew that the sacrifice
of one's life for another

888
01:26:18,412 --> 01:26:19,781
is the greatest show of devotion

889
01:26:19,814 --> 01:26:21,348
that man can reach.

890
01:26:23,417 --> 01:26:26,353
Thus, we've always
honored the tradition

891
01:26:26,386 --> 01:26:27,622
of the.

892
01:26:49,777 --> 01:26:50,845
On this night...

893
01:26:51,979 --> 01:26:55,315
your father
gives his life for you.

894
01:26:59,352 --> 01:27:00,420
Now...

895
01:27:01,321 --> 01:27:03,991
honor your father's sacrifice.

896
01:27:24,746 --> 01:27:26,246
Praise the family!

897
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:30,685
I present to you
our first sacrifice,

898
01:27:30,718 --> 01:27:32,587
representing planting,

899
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:35,523
the first seed and hope.

900
01:27:36,691 --> 01:27:39,560
May his blood
fertilize our lands.

901
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:17,064
For the planting!

902
01:28:17,098 --> 01:28:18,733
For the planting!

903
01:28:26,774 --> 01:28:27,909
After the planning...

904
01:28:28,843 --> 01:28:32,046
the seed grows and is nourished

905
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:33,514
and the weeds...

906
01:28:34,248 --> 01:28:36,818
that threaten
the sprouting plants...

907
01:28:38,052 --> 01:28:40,387
must be ripped from the earth.

908
01:28:54,101 --> 01:28:56,503
As the sacrifices
of our ancestors

909
01:28:56,537 --> 01:28:58,039
cultivated this land...

910
01:28:59,941 --> 01:29:01,642
so too will yours.

911
01:29:19,527 --> 01:29:23,931
I remove this weed
that has choked our family.

912
01:29:35,877 --> 01:29:38,846
No, no, no, no,

913
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,583
no, no, no.

914
01:29:42,617 --> 01:29:44,051
For the cultivation!

915
01:29:44,085 --> 01:29:45,920
For the cultivation!

916
01:29:57,198 --> 01:30:00,167
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

917
01:30:00,201 --> 01:30:03,004
The harvest must be reaped.

918
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:07,440
The wheat separated
from the chaff.

919
01:30:31,832 --> 01:30:33,466
For the harvest!

920
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,936
For the harvest!

921
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:10,705
I'm not going anywhere.

922
01:31:49,143 --> 01:31:52,613
The harvest ceremony
is complete.

923
01:31:53,914 --> 01:31:57,118
We now join
Elder...

924
01:31:58,185 --> 01:31:59,854
in welcoming his bride.

925
01:32:42,029 --> 01:32:43,764
We celebrate their binding

926
01:32:43,798 --> 01:32:46,200
as it strengthens
the future of our family.

927
01:32:55,309 --> 01:32:56,977
You'll come to love it here.

928
01:32:58,379 --> 01:32:59,713
I promise.

929
01:33:06,087 --> 01:33:07,988
With your commitment
to the family...

930
01:33:09,423 --> 01:33:11,092
and to our future...

931
01:33:12,293 --> 01:33:14,962
I bind you
in love and protection

932
01:33:14,995 --> 01:33:16,630
of the seven families.

933
01:33:29,009 --> 01:33:30,177
I bless your thoughts.

934
01:33:31,846 --> 01:33:33,147
May they be pure...

935
01:33:34,014 --> 01:33:35,082
and wise.

936
01:33:42,056 --> 01:33:43,657
I bless your bodies.

937
01:33:44,358 --> 01:33:47,728
May they be strong
to serve the family.

938
01:33:51,765 --> 01:33:54,768
Lastly, I bless your lips.

939
01:33:56,437 --> 01:33:58,038
May only praise...

940
01:33:58,939 --> 01:34:01,208
ever be uttered from them.

941
01:34:14,822 --> 01:34:16,290
They have taken

942
01:34:16,323 --> 01:34:19,226
the honored position
of service and marriage

943
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,661
to each other.

944
01:34:21,061 --> 01:34:23,264
We, the family...

945
01:34:24,165 --> 01:34:27,101
will support you and guide you

946
01:34:27,134 --> 01:34:28,869
on your journey together.
