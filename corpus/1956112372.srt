Both Philips bros don't need
to change the world.

But sometimes,
you can be a real asshole.

We've been
having an affair,

1348
00:57:47,053 --> 00:57:48,750
and he wanted
to run away together.

1349
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:50,151
He said
he killed them all

1350
00:57:50,153 --> 00:57:52,750
so that I would get
my wife Jenny's share,

1351
00:57:52,752 --> 00:57:53,850
and then I'd be rich,

1352
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:55,950
and he could have me
all to himself.
