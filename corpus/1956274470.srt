1
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,042
I don't think this is it.

2
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:03,834
Because she said
a white house.

3
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,834
It says 111 Christmas Street.

4
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,959
I know 111 Christmas
but this is a blue house.

5
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:10,959
I don't know,
maybe it was Christmas Circle.

6
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,102
Well, did you put
Christmas Circle

7
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:13,167
or Christmas Street?

8
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:14,667
Honey, I don't know.

9
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,667
I don't know what I put it as.

10
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,792
Okay, well, she said
it was a white house

11
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,126
and this is a blue house.

12
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,292
Well, why don't we ask?

13
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,458
It's not a big deal.
We're lost.

14
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,375
Just check one more time.
Which one...

15
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,601
There's, like,
four Christmases around here.

16
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,792
Why don't we just ask?

17
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,084
Can you just check
one more time?

18
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,750
Honey, you told me...

19
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,792
Just check the e-mail
that she sent one more time.

20
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,874
All right. Okay.

21
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,959
I feel like
such an idiot because...

22
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,542
No, honey,
we can't help it. Just ask.

23
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,959
Take a deep breath.

24
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:52,667
Let's just go ask.

25
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,251
It's not a big deal.

26
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,417
They have beautiful flowers.

27
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,583
Which one did I say?

28
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,768
Which one did I say?
Which street?

29
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,042
You told me 111th Street.

30
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:04,251
I typed it in, and now
I'm not sure where we are.

31
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,042
<i>What do I
do, just ring on the doorbell?</i>

32
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,844
<i>I mean, these people
just ring the doorbell.</i>

33
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:16,875
<i>Relax. It's not
a big deal. We're lost.</i>

34
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,126
<i>Check one more time
which one.</i>

35
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,458
<i>Honey, it says 111...</i>

36
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:24,893
<i>It could be
five minutes away from here,</i>

37
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,851
<i>and we could be at the wrong
place and not even know it...</i>

38
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,333
Vitals are stable.

39
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,542
<i>I don't know
if it's Christmas Street,</i>

40
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,792
<i>Court, Lane, Circle.</i>

41
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,433
Mother to Child-One.
We're at set-point.

42
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,084
<i>- I copy. Over.
- Running kismet.</i>

43
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,959
<i>I read you,
Lima Charlie. Help me, over.</i>

44
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,186
<i>- Drone in position.
- I read you same.</i>

45
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,167
<i>Awaiting further instruction.</i>

46
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,291
<i>Thermal is up.</i>

47
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,583
<i>Getting in the networks.</i>

48
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,792
<i>We are validating</i>

49
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,018
<i>on our primary
and secondary routes...</i>

50
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:51,583
Social media is clear.

51
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,042
How's our airspace?

52
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:54,375
<i>Residential alarm offline.</i>

53
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,251
<i>I've got eyes inside.</i>

54
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,375
Mother,
what's your count?

55
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,601
<i>I've got two
in the kitchen and...</i>

56
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,624
<i>One in the back room.</i>

57
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:01,709
<i>One in the living room.</i>

58
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:02,792
<i>I have one upstairs.</i>

59
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,792
- I count five.
- I'm counting five.

60
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,209
<i>I got five, too.</i>

61
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,001
Child-One, there's
five subjects in the house.

62
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,083
Copy, Mother.

63
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:14,001
Child-One, conditions are set.

64
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:16,875
Let's get in and out
real quick today. No drama.

65
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,209
Here we go.

66
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,542
<i>Child-Two
and Five engage.</i>

67
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,874
Ding-dong.

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,084
<i>You got a female
coming your way, unarmed.</i>

69
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,959
Hi. I'm so sorry
to bother you,

70
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,417
we're looking
for the Larkin home.

71
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,667
Go.

72
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,226
<i>My friend's supposed to
have given this address.</i>

73
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,458
<i>111 Christmas.</i>

74
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,084
<i>My wife, apparently,
gave me the wrong address.</i>

75
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,559
<i>We're visiting friends
and they just moved in.</i>

76
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,702
<i>But they might have given us</i>

77
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,935
<i>the wrong address.
I don't know, honey.</i>

78
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,333
You have the wrong house.

79
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:51,167
Honey, I told you
it's the wrong street.

80
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,417
We're looking
for 111 Christmas.

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,959
Maybe a Christmas Lane...

82
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:56,208
...or a Christmas Circle?

83
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,709
Look out!

84
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,749
Now.

85
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,208
<i>You, stop. Let's go.</i>

86
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,542
You, here, hands on the wall.

87
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,625
<i>Checking the rear.</i>

88
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,959
<i>- One.
- Two.</i>

89
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,291
You, hands on the wall.

90
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,875
<i>Be advised,
we're internal.</i>

91
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,166
On the wall. Closer.

92
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,041
Three.

93
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,333
Get up.
Against the wall.

94
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,749
Put your hands up.

95
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,792
<i>Sweep upstairs.</i>

96
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,041
<i>Four.</i>

97
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:54,417
One unknown.

98
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,333
<i>Five.</i>

99
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:06,042
- Clear.
- That's five.

100
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,084
We got five, let's go.

101
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,001
<i>Five subjects
in custody.</i>

102
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:12,542
<i>Start the sweep. Commence SSE.</i>

103
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,624
<i>Roger that.</i>

104
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,792
<i>Doug, close it out.</i>

105
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,750
<i>Roger that.
Working on it now.</i>

106
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,375
<i>- Four minutes, 30.
- Clock is ticking.</i>

107
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,582
Turn around.

108
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,874
<i>Blow.</i>

109
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,332
<i>To the left.</i>

110
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:40,250
I see two computers,
four racks.

111
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,084
<i>Confirm.
What about the safe?</i>

112
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,041
Jackpot.

113
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:49,792
Turn around.

114
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,750
Against the wall.

115
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,124
<i>Bite.</i>

116
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,458
<i>I'm in.</i>

117
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,750
Child-One, commencing
full dental impressions

118
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,291
for database crosscheck.

119
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,583
Confirm collection
of all SSD drives.

120
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:21,666
<i>Roger that.</i>

121
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,310
<i>Let's go, people,
the clock is ticking.</i>

122
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,834
<i>Two minutes.</i>

123
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,001
Hands up.

124
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,792
Receiving data dump.

125
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,792
Downloading scans.

126
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:49,959
My ostensible crew.

127
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,041
My titular crew.

128
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:03,875
What's that?

129
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,625
Hey, Bishop.

130
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,583
Got a faint heat signal here

131
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,425
on the second floor
on the south-west corner.

132
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,834
<i>Can't really make it out.
Sir, I'm trying to.</i>

133
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,041
Hmm.

134
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,041
What is it? A squirrel?

135
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,583
If that's a squirrel,
it's a big fucking squirrel.

136
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,583
Child-One, Mother.
Strong thermal. Second floor.

137
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,542
<i>Strong thermal
on the second floor.</i>

138
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,875
<i>Copy, Mother.
Child-Two, Child-Three?</i>

139
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:34,959
<i>Go look into that.</i>

140
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,542
<i>You got 90 seconds,
make it quick.</i>

141
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,332
<i>Clear.</i>

142
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,709
<i>I'm seeing a room
to your left.</i>

143
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,000
<i>There's nothing on my left.</i>

144
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,333
<i>I'm seeing a room
to your left.</i>

145
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:20,667
<i>There's a door to your left.</i>

146
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,041
<i>It's just a wall,
not a door.</i>

147
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,250
<i>I'm seeing a room...
Fuck. Gun. Gun, gun, gun!</i>

148
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,916
Mother, Child-One,

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,918
looks like you were
a little light on your count.

150
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,583
I think
the vest took that.

151
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,750
<i>- You got him. You good?
- I'm good. Let's go.</i>

152
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:55,875
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>

153
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,417
<i>Child-One,
what are we doing?</i>

154
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,583
<i>Stay put,
we're on the clock.</i>

155
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,291
You got to be
kidding me.

156
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,958
Assault-One KIA.

157
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,250
<i>Child-One, Mother.
Collection is terminated.</i>

158
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,625
<i>We are weapons free.</i>

159
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,375
- Confirm, capture to kill.
- Confirm.

160
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,834
- Confirming capture to kill.
<i>- Confirm.</i>

161
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:46,541
They're gonna torch it.

162
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,583
<i>- ...Christmas Street.
- 911...</i>

163
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,225
<i>...just sort of
really loud explosion...</i>

164
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,027
Fire and Police
have been alerted.

165
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,208
<i>ETA two minutes.</i>

166
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,083
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

167
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,417
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

168
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,601
<i>Okay, so you want me
to waste this guy</i>

169
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,874
<i>in broad fucking daylight?</i>

170
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:36,957
Confirm.

171
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,333
You're making a mistake.

172
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:43,125
I've made a lot of them.

173
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,518
<i>Child-One,
the cavalry is en route.</i>

174
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:47,208
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

175
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,500
<i>Kill CCTV-1, CCTV-2.</i>

176
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,458
<i>Let's go.</i>

177
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:21,375
Child-One, Mother.
You're clear for four miles.

178
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,166
We are gonna be with you
for full exfil.

179
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,709
Continue on the current route
to the park exit.

180
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,916
<i>There will be a parking lot...</i>

181
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,375
<i>Seven people believed to be</i>

182
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,874
<i>members of Russia's FSB,
or State Intelligence Service,</i>

183
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,458
<i>formerly known as the KGB,
were found dead</i>

184
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,874
<i>in, what sources say,
was a Russian safehouse.</i>

185
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,000
<i>Sources inside
the US intelligence community</i>

186
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,375
<i>indicated that this was
an FSB hit on its own,</i>

187
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,916
<i>perhaps an attempt to
manufacture what appeared</i>

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
<i>to be an assault
on Russian civilians,</i>

189
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,208
<i>but was, in fact,
a kind of suicide...</i>

190
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,749
<i>This is clearly
a slaughterhouse</i>

191
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,916
<i>turned in on itself.</i>

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,518
<i>...what they
describe as a quiet, safe,</i>

193
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:01,833
<i>and friendly community.</i>

194
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,291
<i>One of
the victims, disturbingly,</i>

195
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,542
<i>an 18-year-old Russian male.</i>

196
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,583
<i>This is uncharacteristic for
the KGB to be targeting...</i>

197
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,833
<i>The victim,
apparently 18 years of age.</i>

198
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,375
<i>And this is truly shocking...</i>

199
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,417
<i>White House
official indicated</i>

200
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,938
<i>that this was
a Russia-led operation.</i>

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,583
<i>More information
will be coming out.</i>

202
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,208
<i>They have been playing it very
close to the vest of the FBI.</i>

203
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,250
Here's
your non-disclosure.

204
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,083
We're transcribing
and recording.

205
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,833
There might be a finding.

206
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,625
We live in a new world.
These are bloody times.

207
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,791
Evil exists. Horror exists.
The great game continues.

208
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,874
If you have patience,

209
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,637
you wouldn't have expected it
to end, so...

210
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,166
Most governments have
very little patience.

211
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,375
What is a government anyway?

212
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,601
Does a government
have a heartbeat?

213
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,503
Does a government have
ten fingers and ten toes?

214
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:51,000
A government is capable
of vengeance.

215
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,166
Is a government
capable of slaughter?

216
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,874
<i>The American
people do not see their work</i>

217
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,333
<i>or know their names.</i>

218
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,958
<i>Lieutenant Silva
showed exceptional courage</i>

219
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,916
<i>in extreme danger.</i>

220
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,166
<i>Subject, James Silva,
age seven.</i>

221
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,125
<i>He's not
like other little boys.</i>

222
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,375
<i>Mrs. Silva, I believe
your son may be gifted.</i>

223
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,250
<i>There's nothing
wrong with you, Jimmy.</i>

224
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,500
<i>Your mind just moves faster
than the other kids.</i>

225
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,583
<i>Snap this
when you can't slow down.</i>

226
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,375
<i>Just like that.</i>

227
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,333
<i>We need to talk
about your anger, Jimmy.</i>

228
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:02,333
A tragic scene on

229
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,166
<i>Jericho Turnpike
this morning...</i>

230
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,291
<i>...killing
a mother and her twin sons.</i>

231
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:09,624
<i>A third son,
11-year-old Jimmy Silva,</i>

232
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,375
<i>is in critical condition.</i>

233
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,958
<i>We do have
some other activities.</i>

234
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,038
<i>I won't discuss those other
activities at this time.</i>

235
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,582
<i>It requires
a change in tactics.</i>

236
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,041
<i>A tightly knit,
highly efficient machine.</i>

237
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,958
<i>We will direct
every tool of intelligence,</i>

238
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,458
<i>until there's no refuge.</i>

239
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,542
<i>...ramping up
of these wars</i>

240
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:46,291
<i>outside of the war zones.</i>

241
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:49,208
<i>Grade 546...</i>

242
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,375
<i>Eyes on a blue sedan.</i>

243
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,666
<i>Copy.
You're clear to engage.</i>

244
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,166
<i>You're authorized</i>

245
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,725
<i>to go break the law
in other countries,</i>

246
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,833
<i>and you have the presidential
authority to do it.</i>

247
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,624
<i>The real
abilities that we have,</i>

248
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,958
<i>this is something
nobody can even understand.</i>

249
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:13,041
<i>James Silva,
welcome to the new wars.</i>

250
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:58,752
I need to know before we start
this conversation

251
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,041
how bad of a mood are you in.

252
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:02,684
What you want?
Like one to ten?

253
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,749
Yeah.

254
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,582
Seven and rising quickly.

255
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,958
There's no caesium
in the crate, Jimmy.

256
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,083
What?

257
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,333
<i>What was in it?</i>

258
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,041
<i>Twelve cases
of M4 rifles,</i>

259
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,541
<i>18 guns per case,</i>

260
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:19,416
<i>180 M67 grenades.</i>

261
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,291
We broke them to pieces,
no caesium.

262
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,416
<i>There were paintings.</i>

263
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:23,600
<i>We tore the canvases
off the frames.</i>

264
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:24,708
<i>There's no caesium.</i>

265
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,041
<i>Repeat, no caesium.</i>

266
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,642
<i>Repeat, no caesium found.
Just some grenades.</i>

267
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,145
We tore
the whole fucking thing apart.

268
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,000
- Paintings?
- Fakes.

269
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:33,041
Munch. Norwegian.

270
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,125
Munch as in <i>The Scream?</i>

271
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,582
Yeah. But it wasn't
<i>The Scream.</i>

272
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:38,856
Well, this is
a big fucking problem.

273
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,207
Where's Alice?

274
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:43,499
Where is she?
It was her source.

275
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,380
We all thought the source
was credible, Jimmy.

276
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,749
Just shut the fuck up.

277
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,916
I never liked this lead.
Causing avalanches.

278
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,725
This is basically what
this is, this is an avalanche.

279
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:53,916
'Cause we have now what?
Sam, what do we have now?

280
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,916
- What do we have now, huh?
- Nothing.

281
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,166
- Dougie, what do we have now?
- Nothing.

282
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,791
Six sets of caesium
still missing.

283
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:02,000
Eleven discs per set.
That's 66 missing discs.

284
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,000
That's 66 dirty bombs.
At least. Right?

285
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,162
We all thought it was real.

286
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,541
Oh, it is very real.
This is a big fucking problem.

287
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,999
What is this?

288
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:11,582
It's Sam's birthday.

289
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,791
It's my birthday.

290
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,708
Oh. Happy birthday.

291
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:18,582
No birthday cake.
No birthday cake.

292
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,874
Your source sucked.

293
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,083
- What, he lied to you?
- It happens.

294
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,125
We are well outside the realm
of "it happens," Alice. Okay?

295
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,874
This is not a case
where shit can happen.

296
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,000
We are not talking about

297
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,481
stolen fucking
ice cream cones here.

298
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,791
I'm handling it.

299
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,041
Oh, you're handling it?

300
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,582
Really?
Do you need help with that?

301
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,666
No, I don't.

302
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:42,708
- Who is the source?
- Local special forces.

303
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,291
You running a cop?

304
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:47,041
Since when do we trust local
special forces? Jesus, Alice.

305
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,874
He's been an excellent source.

306
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,433
Is that supposed to mean
something to me

307
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,600
that he is
an excellent source?

308
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,892
Do you want me to tell
John Porter,

309
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,208
"Oh, he's
an excellent source"?

310
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,767
No, I don't think so. That
story does not work for me.

311
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,374
It's not a story, Jimmy.
It's the truth.

312
00:19:57,457 --> 00:20:00,208
No, this cannot not work,
all right? I trusted you.

313
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,489
Does that mean anything
to you?

314
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:04,457
Hello?

315
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,708
I'm handling it.

316
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,850
You know
what's in the container?

317
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,374
Edvard Munch.
You ever seen a Munch?

318
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:11,208
I mean,
this guy is dark as fuck.

319
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,749
Sounds perfect for you, Jimmy.

320
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,101
You know,
I don't appreciate that.

321
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,443
I actually resent that.
Thank you.

322
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:17,433
Wow. 120 million at auction.

323
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:18,499
Jimmy.

324
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:19,850
He was a Sagittarius,
just like you.

325
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:20,749
I should have been a painter.

326
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,833
Take a breath.

327
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:23,958
Go outside.

328
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:25,938
Yeah, the sign outside
says "ladies."

329
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:40,374
He hears everything,
never listens.

330
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,250
He listens
to what works for him.

331
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:43,666
So, what works for him?

332
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,125
Actionable intelligence.

333
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,208
And pain.

334
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:57,125
<i>The definition
of a war zone</i>

335
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,457
<i>is an interesting thing.</i>

336
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,822
Being a cop in Baltimore might
be every bit as dangerous

337
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:03,041
as being a cop in Baghdad.

338
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,374
The cops played
the politicians

339
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:12,874
and the politicians
played the cops

340
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,499
and I don't think anyone ever
knew who is on whose side.

341
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,582
I think he got scared, Jimmy.

342
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,166
He's an honest guy.
He's been 100% reliable.

343
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,350
Yeah,
there's a big difference

344
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:27,517
between honest and reliable,
Alice.

345
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,540
I'll handle it.

346
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,892
How's that going, by the way?
Do you want me to take that?

347
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,684
- Let me get the phone.
- I want to get it later.

348
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,266
No, you'll take it now and
end whatever is happening

349
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,541
on the other side
of that phone

350
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:38,142
so you can return home
from that planet to this one.

351
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,844
I need you here with me.
Do you understand?

352
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:40,916
Can I help you, sir?

353
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,374
Sir. Ma'am,
you have a walk-in.

354
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:43,600
You know what,
I'll take the walk-in.

355
00:21:43,624 --> 00:21:44,767
You're gonna take the walk-in?

356
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,558
I said I'll take the walk-in.
Is that okay with you?

357
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:47,976
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Are you sure?

358
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,833
- You want to take the walk-in?
- No, sir.

359
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,225
Okay, then,
I'll take the walk-in.

360
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:53,541
Alice, handle the ex and then
we handle the source, okay?

361
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:55,475
Can you do that for me?
Let's go. Show me the walk-in.

362
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:57,377
I want a solution, okay?
Not a bunch of excuses.

363
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,290
I'll handle
the fucking walk-in.

364
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,541
Hey, how are you?

365
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:08,749
I'm well, how are you?

366
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,749
Excellent, thank...
Wow, that's a beautiful pin.

367
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,225
The government is going to
seize my assets.

368
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,582
I have $1.3 billion.

369
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,666
That's very impressive.

370
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:16,017
I know a lot of people
in America.

371
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:16,874
It's beautiful.

372
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,041
I know Warren Buffett.

373
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,101
- You know Warren Buffett?
- Yes. Mr. Warren Buffett.

374
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,749
I can pay whatever it takes.

375
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,934
You're offering me
whatever it takes or...

376
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:23,958
No, no, no. No, no.

377
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:27,582
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

378
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,041
I'm sorry
I missed all those calls.

379
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,416
<i>I need to confirm</i>

380
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:33,457
<i>that you are not going to be
at her school on Mother's Day.</i>

381
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:34,833
You just wanted
to confirm that?

382
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,290
<i>Correct.
Diane is gonna take her...</i>

383
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:37,666
You know I can't be there.

384
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:39,374
- Are you recording this?
<i>- Pardon me?</i>

385
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,183
You know it's illegal
to record me, Luke.

386
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:42,207
<i>I am just trying...</i>

387
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,009
I'm the 17th richest person
in this country.

388
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,249
They liquidate my accounts,

389
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:47,541
my whole family is
going to be ruined.

390
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:48,833
I will have nothing.

391
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:49,916
Well, that's a shame.

392
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,809
Are you familiar with
Lincoln's First Inaugural,

393
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,249
delivered March 1861?

394
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:56,000
Better angels and the bonds
of affection? No?

395
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:58,684
All right. Abraham Lincoln
was from Kentucky.

396
00:22:58,708 --> 00:22:59,874
You ever been to Kentucky?

397
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,850
What about Nebraska? Where
your friend Warren was born?

398
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:02,873
<i>Hi, Mommy.</i>

399
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:05,541
- Hey.
<i>- Look.</i>

400
00:23:05,624 --> 00:23:06,874
You got your ears pierced?

401
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:08,790
Oh, wow.

402
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:11,457
You look so grown up.
Your dad took you?

403
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,041
<i>No, Diane took me.</i>

404
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:14,332
<i>Are you coming
to Mother's Day?</i>

405
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,374
<i>I thought you would make
blue cupcakes with me.</i>

406
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,175
You know I can't be there.
I'm really sorry.

407
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:19,892
<i>Okay, I'll save one for you.</i>

408
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,541
You know what America
does not need?

409
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,499
Another rich person

410
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,624
scared about the liquidation
of her accounts.

411
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,308
<i>- It's just earrings.</i>
- You know that I would...

412
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:29,141
<i>Don't give me the attitude.
She wanted the earrings.</i>

413
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:30,332
And by the way, it's not

414
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,855
Warren Buffett anymore.
It's Buff-ay.

415
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,582
- Ba-ffay?
- Bu-ffay.

416
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:35,541
- Buff-ay?
- Buff-ay.

417
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:37,392
Warren Buffett. He doesn't
live in Nebraska anymore.

418
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,499
He lives in Paris.

419
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:40,374
You need the French Embassy.

420
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:41,499
You speak French?

421
00:23:41,582 --> 00:23:42,624
I'm the mother, Luke.

422
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,499
<i>Oh, right. And Diane will be
the step-mother,</i>

423
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:46,374
<i>and she's actually able
to be there.</i>

424
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,215
I'm gonna give you
the personal mobile number

425
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,457
of the French Ambassador.

426
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,475
He's a very good friend of
mine. He's gonna hook you up.

427
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:52,541
He's single, by the way.

428
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:54,422
You tell him that Steve Bannon
sent you, okay?

429
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,017
- This is his number.
- Thank you, Mr. Bannon.

430
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,684
<i>You think you're the only one
that's out there working?</i>

431
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:58,791
<i>You think it's so easy?</i>

432
00:23:58,874 --> 00:24:00,958
- You motherfucker.
<i>- What? I can't hear you.</i>

433
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,000
- You motherfucker!
<i>- Bingo.</i>

434
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,249
<i>Alice, good job.</i>

435
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:06,499
<i>Welcome back to
the FamilyWizard, sweetheart.</i>

436
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:08,541
- No.
<i>- Yes. You're wizard-ed.</i>

437
00:24:08,624 --> 00:24:09,749
- Wait.
<i>- Goodbye.</i>

438
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,082
Tell her that I love her. No!

439
00:24:12,165 --> 00:24:13,708
Fucking motherfucker!

440
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:17,791
Are we done here now?

441
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:22,833
Let's go.

442
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,541
<i>Sam Snel, you have a walk-in.</i>

443
00:24:24,624 --> 00:24:26,457
<i>Sam Snel, you have a walk-in.</i>

444
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,624
If he's alive.

445
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:58,249
in twenty-four hours...

446
00:24:58,332 --> 00:24:59,791
we have failed.

447
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,207
<i>Everyone thinks</i>

448
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,289
<i>they know everything now.</i>

449
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,290
<i>You think you know
about election hacking?</i>

450
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:08,532
<i>You think you understand
the definition of "collusion"?</i>

451
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,082
You know nothing.

452
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,629
<i>Last night we had
a seven-man team at the port,</i>

453
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,517
acting on what we believed
was accurate intelligence

454
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,624
regarding four pounds
of stolen C-139,

455
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:25,999
a new form of caesium-137
radioactive powder.

456
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:27,225
Just to understand
the magnitude,

457
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:28,374
four pounds is enough

458
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:30,999
to make six major cities
uninhabitable.

459
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:32,499
We identified the container,

460
00:25:32,582 --> 00:25:34,266
there was nothing in it
but weapons and some fake art,

461
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,082
all of which Doug and Sam
meticulously disassembled.

462
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:39,207
No caesium was found.
The intel was bad.

463
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,289
Whose source was it?

464
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:41,416
That'd be on me, John.

465
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:42,916
- Whose source?
- It's on me, John.

466
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,124
How much
are we paying him?

467
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:45,624
He didn't want money.

468
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,541
We tried to pay him,
and he gave it away.

469
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:49,833
- To who?
- Local senior citizen center.

470
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:52,916
- FamilyWizard.
- What?

471
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:55,457
He's been accurate on
everything else, John, 100%.

472
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:56,725
And he appears driven
and motivated

473
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:57,934
by something
other than funding.

474
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,874
- Fix this.
- Oh, it's gonna be fixed.

475
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:02,499
Every one of
these events occurred

476
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:04,999
as a result of a failure
of imagination.

477
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:08,624
Your job is not to predict
tomorrow based on yesterday.

478
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,207
That's what academics do.

479
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,874
Your job is to prevent
the end of tomorrow

480
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:15,183
by using your brains
and your imagination.

481
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,874
If you don't find the caesium
before it's too late,

482
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:19,374
you will be held responsible

483
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:21,708
for the single largest
intelligence fumble

484
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,915
since a flight instruction
school in Florida

485
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,541
failed to grasp
the significance

486
00:26:25,624 --> 00:26:28,457
of a 19-year-old
Al-Qaeda terrorist

487
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:30,833
saying he didn't need to learn
how to land.

488
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,290
So fucking wake up.

489
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,708
Very impressive list, John.
Greatest Hits of Shit Show.

490
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:42,624
You didn't give
the French Ambassador's

491
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:45,165
mobile number to a walk-in?
Did you?

492
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:46,457
Uh, yeah, maybe I did.

493
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:50,915
I don't need phone calls from
the French Ambassador, Jimmy.

494
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,249
- Is she all right?
- I got her.

495
00:26:55,332 --> 00:26:57,624
I don't need
radioactive powder discs

496
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,374
floating around
unaccounted for.

497
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:03,040
This is such shit.

498
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:04,874
This is the worst fucking shit

499
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,290
of all the fucked up shit
we've ever seen.

500
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:09,249
This is the shittiest,
most fucked up shit...

501
00:27:09,332 --> 00:27:11,791
I got it, okay? Relax.
Calm down.

502
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,708
- Go take a little nap.
- Fuck you.

503
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:16,541
FamilyWizard?

504
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:18,124
It's a divorce app.

505
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:19,791
Cuts out direct communication.

506
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:21,708
- It lowers conflict.
- It's working.

507
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,666
Edits your emails,
copies them to the lawyers.

508
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:24,850
It doesn't like certain words.

509
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:25,873
Like what?

510
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:28,332
"Prick. Whore. Cocksucker.
Male whore, sadist.

511
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:29,854
"Fucking asshole,
fucking psychopath,

512
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,141
"fucking deadbeat,
fucking idiot,

00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:32,266
"fucking parsimonious,
dictatorial,

514
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,329
"abusive motherfucking..."

515
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:35,957
I got it. You're upset,
suck it up, okay?

516
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,141
I have no ability
to communicate

517
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:38,165
with my daughter now.

518
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:39,558
You're never gonna do
something normal

519
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:41,374
until you die.
That's what this job is.

520
00:27:41,457 --> 00:27:43,517
I think I've lied to every
person that I've ever met.

521
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,933
So what? You really
wanna get into this now?

522
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:46,541
- No.
- "No," what?

523
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,102
No to your black vision
of everything.

524
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:49,290
If you can't fucking tell,

525
00:27:49,374 --> 00:27:50,600
I'm not in the mood
to be light-housed.

526
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:52,915
This is dark work, Alice.
And you requested it.

527
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:54,183
And I'm not gonna be washing
strawberry jam

528
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:55,406
out of my swimsuit
this summer,

529
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:56,666
I get to wash blood.

530
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:57,809
Only maybe not
because they don't make

531
00:27:57,832 --> 00:27:58,957
a detergent for that.

532
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,725
And you can forget about sex
on Sundays, there are no

533
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:01,891
- Sundays in our world.
- None.

534
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:03,100
- The job comes first.
- You said it.

535
00:28:03,124 --> 00:28:04,433
- You said it.
- You said it, and you've

536
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:05,933
learned well. You're starting
to make me proud.

537
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:07,915
- I'm not you.
- You're pretty close.

538
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:09,225
Just take the fucking
medicine, Al, okay?

539
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:10,448
It's halfway down your throat.

540
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:12,165
- You need a vacation.
- For what?

541
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:17,040
- You need a week on a beach.
- This is my beach.

542
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:18,207
I love it here.

543
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,040
There is no absolution, Al,
all right?

544
00:28:20,124 --> 00:28:21,915
There is no washing out
what we do.

545
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:24,541
Unless, of course,
you try that Jesus guy.

546
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:26,016
I mean, they say
he's very forgiving.

547
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,433
They also say,
"Thou shall not kill."

548
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:29,615
You and I have put up some
serious numbers, young lady.

549
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:34,082
Fuck.

550
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,100
We were not there
to keep the peace, all right?

551
00:28:39,124 --> 00:28:40,040
There was no peace.

552
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:41,666
We were there
to limit the violence.

553
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:47,831
Hey, get back!

554
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,308
Sometimes that's all it takes
for a guy to take a risk.

555
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:52,517
For a guy to do
the right thing.

556
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:53,749
You, get back!

557
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,457
<i>Asian male
approaching. Please advise.</i>

558
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,582
<i>Be advised.
There's one male subject</i>

559
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,957
<i>right at the front gate.</i>

560
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,416
People are rarely rational.

561
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:13,582
- Put it down.
- A gift.

562
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,207
People are highly
self-destructive.

563
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,541
On your knees.

564
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:18,849
The definition of an unknown
known is a thing which exists,

565
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:20,124
but which
you don't know about,

566
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:21,873
and which you cannot
even imagine.

567
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:23,082
Back up! End of the road!

568
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:24,249
Let me see both hands.

569
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:25,666
Back. Get back.

570
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,708
Put your hands in the air.

571
00:29:28,624 --> 00:29:30,290
Get back!
End of the road!

572
00:29:30,374 --> 00:29:31,374
What the hell is that?

573
00:29:31,457 --> 00:29:32,499
Get back!

574
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:40,708
<i>Most sources
lie right to your face.</i>

575
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:43,165
When they have what you need,

576
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:44,624
they know they have the power.

577
00:29:57,499 --> 00:29:58,832
Let's get in the air.

578
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:05,915
We are about to do something...

579
00:30:07,582 --> 00:30:09,748
much more powerful
than kill a man.

580
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:14,624
We're about to kill...

581
00:30:14,707 --> 00:30:17,499
the idea that...

582
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,582
we are weak.

583
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,249
That's my asset.

584
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,665
- Who is he?
- Li Noor.

585
00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:35,849
I don't wanna know his name,

586
00:30:35,873 --> 00:30:37,517
I don't wanna know
what he does for a living,

587
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:38,933
- I wanna know who is he?
- A loner.

588
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:41,790
No kids. No family.
100% accurate and reliable.

589
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:42,933
You marked him
or he marked you?

590
00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:43,957
I marked him.

591
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,499
He says
he has the exact locations

592
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:46,790
of all six sets of caesium.

593
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:48,457
He's locked it on a disc.

594
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,299
He says only if we get him
out of the country

595
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:52,541
and give him asylum
will he open the disc.

596
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:54,517
You're gonna deal with this
or you want me to handle it?

597
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:55,540
I got it.

598
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:56,957
This is serious, right?

599
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,039
Oh, very.

600
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,748
Oh, fuck.

601
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:19,249
- This is an ouroborus drive.
- What the fuck is that?

602
00:31:19,332 --> 00:31:20,957
It means
it's gonna self-destruct.

603
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,665
The entire program is gonna
eat itself in eight hours.

604
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,124
It's gonna be gone.

605
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:28,332
He's smart. Time is insurance,
so he gets what he wants.

606
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:33,665
You fucked me.

607
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:35,374
No, I didn't.

608
00:31:35,457 --> 00:31:36,456
You didn't?

609
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:41,332
Open the disc, Li.

610
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:44,290
I want out of this country

611
00:31:44,374 --> 00:31:45,374
now.

612
00:31:50,832 --> 00:31:51,999
Open the disc now.

613
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:53,790
I want out of the country.

614
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:55,707
The information on the disc

615
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,332
will lead to the safe return
of the stolen caesium

616
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:02,416
and to the complete political
collapse of the country.

617
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:04,957
Which country?

618
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:08,040
The country
you're currently sitting in.

619
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:10,207
Get me out of this country.

620
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,623
and I will give you the code
to unlock the disc.

621
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:13,915
Are you under the impression

622
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,677
that you are in a position
to make demands?

623
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:19,416
I tell you what I want,
and you give it to me.

624
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:24,416
Open the motherfucking disc.

625
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:29,915
You're wasting time.

626
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:36,707
Do you think
that because I'm a woman

627
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,832
I'm less capable
of extreme violence?

628
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:44,832
I'll go get a sledgehammer

629
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:50,040
and an ice-axe
and I will fuck you up.

630
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:04,581
Take a closer look
at the paintings.

631
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:10,623
<i>Li was a man
of his word.</i>

632
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:12,882
He gave us the exact location
of the caesium.

633
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,389
<i>He was telling us the truth
on the crate.</i>

634
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,266
<i>So we took him at his word
on the remaining</i>

635
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,748
<i>caesium locations.</i>

636
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:23,999
<i>Certain operations require
a level of violence</i>

637
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:26,124
not palatable to most people.

638
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:29,957
And certain operations require
a higher level of deniability.

639
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,957
- This is Overwatch, John.
- Give me a moment.

640
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:37,581
You and I both know this is
an Overwatch operation.

641
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:40,207
What was that thing about
"unadvisedly or lightly"?

642
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,516
Oh, some things
should not be entered

643
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,707
into unadvisedly or lightly

644
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,100
but reverently, discreetly
advisedly, soberly,

645
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:45,482
and in the fear of God.
That thing?

646
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:47,707
- Yeah.
- That's the thing.

647
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:54,308
I'm not gonna authorize it,
Jimmy.

648
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,457
But you can warm him up.

649
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,058
- Oh, I'm gonna warm him up.
- Discreetly.

650
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:58,081
Discreetly.

651
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:17,707
<i>I really
don't like diplomats.</i>

652
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,374
Diplomacy never works
once the match

653
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:20,790
has been lit
to start the fire.

654
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:23,124
"Oh, look at that fire.

655
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:25,141
"Let's drink tea and talk
about hearts and minds."

656
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:26,290
No. I don't think so.

657
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,392
How can
I help you, gentlemen?

658
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,249
I'm here to see
Ambassador Brady.

659
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:42,290
He won't talk.
He doesn't feel safe.

660
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:43,599
Oh, does he want
to go back outside?

661
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,790
'Cause I'm not sure
he'll feel safe there either.

662
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:47,290
Listen up.
We have a situation.

663
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:49,100
Deputy Foreign Minister
is here. He wants the cop.

664
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:50,141
So whatever you guys
are doing here,

665
00:34:50,165 --> 00:34:51,164
I suggest you chop-chop.

666
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:52,290
Well, that makes things

667
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:53,432
a little more interesting,
don't it?

668
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:54,498
Do not give him up, Brady.

669
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:55,808
I wasn't planning
on giving him up.

670
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:57,058
You have
any other advice for me?

671
00:34:57,082 --> 00:34:58,249
Anything else? You sure?

672
00:34:58,332 --> 00:34:59,970
No, no, just making
a friendly suggestion.

673
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,707
Thank you. You cracked it yet?

674
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,058
I'm gonna need
a little more time.

675
00:35:03,082 --> 00:35:04,165
You need time?

676
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:05,915
I don't have any time.

677
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:07,975
Didn't they teach you anything
about caesium at Harvard?

678
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:09,124
I didn't go to Harvard.

679
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,849
You didn't graduate Harvard
with Mark Zuckerberg?

680
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:12,471
Actually Mark Zuckerberg
didn't graduate.

681
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,040
I'm not talking to you.

682
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:15,350
Were you born
on second base or third?

683
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:16,492
'Cause I can never remember.

684
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,707
- I'm Scottsdale, Arizona...
- I don't give a shit.

685
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,516
They didn't teach you anything
about caesium at MIT?

686
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,665
I didn't go to MIT.

687
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:23,641
Well, let me give you
a little science lesson then.

688
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:25,790
You know what happens
when you ionize a protein?

689
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,957
You ever read <i>Hiroshima,</i>
by John Hersey?

690
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,623
Pulitzer Prize-winning writer,
essay on the atom bomb.

691
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:32,350
'Cause John Hersey wrote about
the survivors, all right?

692
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:33,557
He wrote about
how he reached out

693
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:34,707
to take the hands of women

694
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,373
in the wake
of the bombing in Japan

695
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:38,124
and their skin
slipped off like gloves.

696
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:39,605
And then you know
what happens next?

697
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:41,332
Your kidneys fail.
Your lungs collapse.

698
00:35:41,415 --> 00:35:42,873
You cannot breathe,
you cannot think.

699
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:45,124
Your thyroid just evaporates,
all right?

700
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:47,249
Then your lymphocyte
cell count takes a nose dive.

701
00:35:47,332 --> 00:35:48,415
Jimmy.

702
00:35:48,498 --> 00:35:49,975
We're looking at approximately
60,000 people

703
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,432
becoming Jell-O
on our watch, all right?

704
00:35:51,456 --> 00:35:52,748
That's what this shit does.

705
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:56,290
Caesium-139 is Hiroshima
and Nagasaki combined.

706
00:35:56,373 --> 00:35:57,415
Only you don't need

707
00:35:57,498 --> 00:35:58,557
sophisticated planes
to place it.

708
00:35:58,581 --> 00:35:59,832
You only need a kid

709
00:35:59,915 --> 00:36:01,473
who can empty an envelope
on a sidewalk.

710
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,832
Do your job
and crack the code.

711
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:10,683
You know,
I think I'll go meet

712
00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:11,946
the new
Deputy Foreign Minister.

713
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,290
What exactly is Silva's
psychological problem?

714
00:36:26,373 --> 00:36:28,331
He doesn't like
computer people.

715
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:30,790
Fuckin' nerds.

716
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,540
He's in the embassy.

717
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:44,373
Alive?

718
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:46,872
Alive.

719
00:36:58,456 --> 00:36:59,456
What is your name?

720
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:02,206
Li Noor.

721
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:05,456
- Repeat after me. Blue.
- Blue.

722
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:08,165
- Strange.
- Strange.

723
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:09,665
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

724
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:11,581
- Egg.
- Egg.

725
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:13,391
Do you know what it feels like
to fall in love?

726
00:37:13,415 --> 00:37:14,289
Dangerous.

727
00:37:14,373 --> 00:37:15,766
What does it feel like
to kill a man?

728
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,789
Nothing.

729
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,707
- Repeat after me. Green.
- Green.

730
00:37:21,165 --> 00:37:22,289
- White.
- White.

731
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,016
Are you an agent
of the Israeli government?

732
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
No.

733
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:26,599
Are you an agent of
the Pakistani government?

734
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:27,623
No.

735
00:37:27,707 --> 00:37:28,891
Are you involved
in acts of espionage

736
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:30,040
against your own government?

737
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,124
Yes.

738
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,915
Do you possess the code
to open the disc?

739
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:33,999
Yes.

740
00:37:34,082 --> 00:37:35,331
Can we trust you?

741
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:38,665
Yes.

742
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:39,832
- Romeo.
- Romeo.

743
00:37:39,915 --> 00:37:41,082
- Juliet.
- Juliet.

744
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:45,124
- Where is that code?
- In my mind.

745
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,082
If transported
to the United States,

746
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:50,373
will you open it?

747
00:37:53,082 --> 00:37:54,081
Yes.

748
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:21,581
Two cups of sugar.

749
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,581
And a cup
of blueberries, you...

750
00:38:24,873 --> 00:38:27,124
Shit!

751
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,581
<i>So here's the thing...</i>

752
00:38:38,665 --> 00:38:41,915
We take our request for asylum
extremely seriously.

753
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:43,082
If you have him, Brady,

754
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:44,665
we'd like him back.
That's all.

755
00:38:44,748 --> 00:38:46,165
He's wanted for espionage.

756
00:38:46,248 --> 00:38:47,456
- Espionage?
- Yes.

757
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,540
- What do you mean?
- How's everybody doing?

758
00:38:50,456 --> 00:38:52,665
If you have him, we would
very much like him back.

759
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:53,915
Somebody lose a dog?

760
00:38:55,415 --> 00:38:56,414
Fuck!

761
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,790
You good?

762
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:02,872
Yes.

763
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:17,415
Any last words for your mother?

764
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,790
What?

765
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:21,873
Traitor.

766
00:40:07,915 --> 00:40:09,164
He's crying wolf.

767
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:11,040
He's a witch.

768
00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:13,123
A witch? What, like a good
witch or a wicked witch?

769
00:40:13,206 --> 00:40:15,373
Like a witch with a big nose
and a broom?

770
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,498
Axel, this is
a friendly meeting.

771
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,289
We're talking about a corrupt,
low-level cop.

772
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:22,040
I think the fact
that you're sitting here

773
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:23,707
indicates he's not
so low level.

774
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,432
I can assure you
that the appropriate choice

775
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:43,581
is to hand him over.

776
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:44,665
You assure me?

777
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:46,289
I mean, can you assure me
that those

778
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:48,039
circling helicopters
are in our airspace

779
00:41:48,123 --> 00:41:49,665
for a cop not worth my time?

780
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:50,790
- Jimmy...
- Do you know

781
00:41:50,873 --> 00:41:51,915
how airspace works?

782
00:41:51,998 --> 00:41:53,037
Do you know there's, like,

783
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:54,307
a silo that goes up
from this building

784
00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:55,665
all the way up to Heaven?

785
00:41:55,748 --> 00:41:57,123
You send choppers
into that silo,

786
00:41:57,206 --> 00:41:59,244
you're in violation, speaking
of what's appropriate.

787
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:00,540
Jimmy...

788
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:02,289
I'm just stating the facts.

789
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:03,956
This is Brady.

790
00:42:03,998 --> 00:42:05,039
Be careful.

791
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,039
Oh, you fucking be careful.

792
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:08,540
Where were they found?

793
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:10,248
Is the situation contained?

794
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:12,707
You should trust me, James.
It's good for your health.

795
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:16,081
Do you have men
wandering our embassy?

796
00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:17,581
- Absolutely not.
- Good.

797
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:18,998
Because the men
who were wandering

798
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,915
the embassy
are now absolutely dead.

799
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,497
Let's go.

800
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:39,330
Get up!

801
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,915
Hands behind your head!

802
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,081
Hands behind your head!

803
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:49,831
Turn around!

804
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:01,540
About the fog of war
and imagine chaos

805
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:03,873
on a battlefield.
Armies. Tanks. Smoke. Fire.

806
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,123
But it depends on your
definition of battlefield.

807
00:43:06,206 --> 00:43:08,164
A battlefield can be
a room with two people in it.

808
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:09,665
That's chaos. That's fog.

809
00:43:17,206 --> 00:43:18,498
The assassination attempt

810
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:22,748
<i>meant that Li had to be
a very high-value asset.</i>

811
00:43:22,832 --> 00:43:25,039
Or a direct threat to them.

812
00:43:26,873 --> 00:43:28,914
Prepare my resignation papers.

813
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:33,373
Either way,
we had to protect him.

814
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:38,415
<i>Warriors don't wear uniforms
anymore.</i>

815
00:43:39,832 --> 00:43:41,707
<i>There are no uniforms
in war now.</i>

816
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,890
<i>The little girl
that looks like</i>

817
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:44,307
<i>your little sister's
hippie friend on holiday</i>

818
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,914
<i>might be a weapon of
mass destruction.</i>

819
00:43:48,123 --> 00:43:49,456
<i>The start of
an operation is just</i>

820
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,832
<i>like the start of
anything else.</i>

821
00:43:50,914 --> 00:43:52,992
<i>Everything could go right.
Everything could go wrong.</i>

822
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:59,039
<i>Diplomacy is option one.
Military's option two.</i>

823
00:43:59,123 --> 00:44:00,998
<i>When option one and option two
are abandoned,</i>

824
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:02,289
<i>there is only one thing left.</i>

825
00:44:03,832 --> 00:44:04,914
Which is us.

826
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:06,748
We are the third option.

827
00:44:14,914 --> 00:44:17,373
<i>Special situations teams.
Special missions units.</i>

828
00:44:17,456 --> 00:44:19,790
<i>Smart people on short notice
to solve problems.</i>

829
00:44:21,748 --> 00:44:23,914
<i>The two teams,
they are by design</i>

830
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:26,039
<i>2,000 miles from one another.</i>

831
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,872
<i>The Overwatch location</i>

832
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:31,415
<i>is America's most closely
guarded secret.</i>

833
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:44,081
Mmm-hmm.

834
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:47,456
How does it work?

835
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,415
As soon as he's on the move,

836
00:44:49,498 --> 00:44:51,289
They'll switch networks.

837
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:52,748
That's the loophole,

838
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:54,123
that's our way in.

839
00:44:55,665 --> 00:44:57,289
An op is a living thing.

840
00:44:57,373 --> 00:45:00,540
Once you launch,
the op has a life of its own.

841
00:45:00,623 --> 00:45:02,099
- Sam, what's the op?
- It's classified.

842
00:45:02,123 --> 00:45:03,391
- The op is classified?
- Correct.

843
00:45:03,415 --> 00:45:04,474
Sam, we don't need
the attitude.

844
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:05,516
You know what, Sam?
Your attitude

845
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,956
is turning
into a real problem.

846
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:08,224
You know what?
I'll go work on it

847
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:09,846
after you go fuck yourself.
Okay, Victor?

848
00:45:12,248 --> 00:45:16,540
This is a Title 50
Overwatch operation.

849
00:45:16,623 --> 00:45:18,748
Overwatch protocols
will be in effect

850
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:21,081
for the next 180 minutes.

851
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,415
The package is Li Noor.

852
00:45:26,872 --> 00:45:30,373
He spent seven years
in our host country's

853
00:45:30,456 --> 00:45:32,248
elite tactical squad.

854
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:34,623
He has no known family.

855
00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:39,789
The goal is to deliver
that package from here,

856
00:45:39,872 --> 00:45:42,872
22 miles to our Angel.

857
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:45,707
Nine pounds of
radioactive isotope,

858
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:48,540
otherwise known as
caesium-139,

859
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:52,081
otherwise known as
Fear Powder is missing.

860
00:45:53,665 --> 00:45:57,081
<i>Mr. Noor knows
exactly where it is.</i>

861
00:45:57,164 --> 00:46:00,498
<i>He has locked the information
on a disc,</i>

862
00:46:00,581 --> 00:46:03,872
and it is deconstructing
even as we speak.

863
00:46:03,956 --> 00:46:07,747
<i>He wants asylum.
He wants America.</i>

864
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:10,498
Only when we get him
to the plane

865
00:46:12,248 --> 00:46:15,206
will he give us the code
to unlock the disc.

866
00:46:16,498 --> 00:46:19,039
<i>She can only stay on
the ground ten minutes.</i>

867
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:21,373
So we are extremely limited.

868
00:46:21,456 --> 00:46:23,081
<i>Speed matters.</i>

869
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:30,998
<i>We have a team of
seven operators.</i>

870
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:37,456
<i>They are no longer employees
of the US government.</i>

871
00:46:39,248 --> 00:46:42,623
<i>They are engaged in
a higher form of patriotism.</i>

872
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:46,789
They are ghosts.

873
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:11,665
You're not a witch, are you?

874
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:14,205
No.

875
00:47:16,164 --> 00:47:17,163
Are you?

876
00:47:50,123 --> 00:47:52,872
Prepare for
net changeover. Ready.

877
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:54,331
And in five,

878
00:47:54,415 --> 00:47:55,956
<i>four,</i>

879
00:47:56,664 --> 00:47:58,039
...three, two...

880
00:47:58,123 --> 00:47:59,122
...one.

881
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:05,331
<i>Child-One, Mother.
We are active on new comms.</i>

882
00:48:05,998 --> 00:48:07,123
OK, lock in.

883
00:48:07,622 --> 00:48:08,706
<i>Do I believe
in Santa Claus?</i>

884
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:09,788
<i>No.</i>

885
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,539
<i>Tooth fairy?</i>

886
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:12,872
Uh-uh.

887
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,039
Did I believe that
my three ex-wives meant it

888
00:48:15,123 --> 00:48:16,801
when they said that
they'd love me forever?

889
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:18,456
Absolutely fucking not.

890
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,164
<i>Did I believe that the comms
were secure? Yes.</i>

891
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,164
We all did.

892
00:48:25,248 --> 00:48:27,664
- Hello, my old friend.
<i>- Yes, Mother. All good.</i>

893
00:48:27,747 --> 00:48:28,956
Do you have your sneakers on?

894
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:31,540
Good to go.

895
00:48:31,998 --> 00:48:33,164
Let's take a drive.

896
00:48:51,706 --> 00:48:53,872
<i>Angel to Mother.
We are wheels up.</i>

897
00:48:53,956 --> 00:48:55,664
<i>Twenty-seven mikes to LC.</i>

898
00:48:55,747 --> 00:48:57,580
<i>We'll be yo-yo
for the next 27 minutes.</i>

899
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:14,415
So you're telling me

900
00:49:14,498 --> 00:49:15,682
you really wanna bring down
this government?

901
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:17,824
Why don't you give me the
codes, save us some trouble?

902
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:18,914
No.

903
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:23,789
Anonymity is a hard concept
for most coders to grasp

904
00:49:23,872 --> 00:49:26,706
because it's a hard concept
for most men to grasp.

905
00:49:27,415 --> 00:49:28,747
Most coders are men.

906
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:32,456
This was definitely written
by a woman.

907
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:34,206
<i>Our friend
here has a little bit of</i>

908
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:36,081
<i>an ego. Changes ideology...</i>

909
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:40,015
Do you know
why people commit espionage

910
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:41,289
against their own government?

911
00:49:41,373 --> 00:49:42,556
It's mainly money,
right, Dougie?

912
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,682
That's been
my experience, yeah.

913
00:49:43,706 --> 00:49:45,349
So if you're not into money,
which I hear you're not.

914
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:46,164
- Is that correct, Alice?
- Right.

915
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:47,289
And it's not ideology,

916
00:49:47,373 --> 00:49:48,474
and nobody's forcing you
to do this.

917
00:49:48,498 --> 00:49:50,289
There can only be
one possible exception.

918
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:52,080
You've got a big ego.

919
00:49:52,498 --> 00:49:53,498
It's not ego.

920
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,123
It's everybody's downfall,
my friend.

921
00:49:55,206 --> 00:49:56,747
Ego is not your <i>amigo.</i>

922
00:49:56,831 --> 00:49:58,709
I'm gonna find out
what bitch wrote this script.

923
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,456
Change one number,
change the idea.

924
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:08,998
The package
will be received

925
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:10,373
in Ramstein, Germany.

926
00:50:10,456 --> 00:50:12,057
- You don't know me.
- No, I don't know you.

927
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:13,480
This government
destroyed my family.

928
00:50:14,956 --> 00:50:15,998
Oh.

929
00:50:16,956 --> 00:50:18,206
When that shit goes down,

930
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:19,368
if you can't go
to a grocery

931
00:50:19,415 --> 00:50:20,474
'cause nothing's refrigerated,

932
00:50:20,497 --> 00:50:21,598
where are you gonna
get your milk?

933
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:23,081
No. It's a very
lucrative business.

934
00:50:23,164 --> 00:50:24,432
If you get yourself
the Ferrari of goats,

935
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:25,664
it's pretty expensive.

936
00:50:25,747 --> 00:50:27,745
You wanna text me a link
when we're done with this?

937
00:50:29,081 --> 00:50:30,747
Check out
how calm Meditation Mike is.

938
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:32,723
- You feeling calm, Alice?
- Not even a little bit.

939
00:50:32,747 --> 00:50:34,373
- Are you?
- I'm totally calm.

940
00:50:34,456 --> 00:50:36,014
That's because
you're mentally unstable.

941
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:37,038
Thank you.

942
00:50:37,622 --> 00:50:38,872
<i>Mother, Child-One.</i>

943
00:50:39,664 --> 00:50:41,307
Starting to slow down here.
You got another route for us?

944
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:43,164
Yeah, there's
an incident on this route

945
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,580
three blocks ahead.

946
00:50:44,998 --> 00:50:46,039
Rerouting now.

947
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:47,598
Want me to clear out
some of this traffic?

948
00:50:47,622 --> 00:50:48,807
I could pick 'em off, sir.
Clear...

949
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:49,248
Maybe later.

950
00:50:49,331 --> 00:50:50,373
How's Angel?

951
00:50:50,455 --> 00:50:51,682
We're green
across the board, sir.

952
00:50:51,706 --> 00:50:52,872
Cruising at 40,000 feet.

953
00:50:52,956 --> 00:50:54,831
Child-One,
switching to alternate route.

954
00:50:56,248 --> 00:50:57,807
Take your next right,
and we'll green-light you

955
00:50:57,831 --> 00:50:59,270
through the next
three intersections.

956
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:06,497
- Slow your roll...
- All this Snapchattin',

957
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,415
Facebookin', and bookin'
a face and Instagrammin', sir.

958
00:51:09,497 --> 00:51:10,831
Pick up a goddamn book.

959
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:13,496
Green.

960
00:51:16,415 --> 00:51:17,580
<i>Two, one.</i>

961
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,123
<i>You're approaching a "Y".</i>

962
00:51:25,206 --> 00:51:26,789
<i>Bear left on the "Y".</i>

963
00:51:29,706 --> 00:51:30,789
<i>Mother, Child-One.</i>

964
00:51:31,998 --> 00:51:33,876
Mother, Child-One.
Nice job on the green lights.

965
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:38,373
<i>Make...
Make a left.</i>

966
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:44,289
<i>Seeing additional traffic.
See if we could open that up.</i>

967
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,566
Bishop,
I've got seven motorcycles

968
00:51:59,622 --> 00:52:00,706
approaching quickly.

969
00:52:01,123 --> 00:52:02,206
They got bikes, Dougie.

970
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,288
I see 'em.

971
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:05,914
<i>The fuck is that?</i>

972
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:07,436
<i>Dougie, Dougie,
get right, get right!</i>

973
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:16,789
Where'd that come from?

974
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:17,998
Fuck!

975
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:19,831
<i>- Watch that motorcycles.
- On your left!</i>

976
00:52:19,914 --> 00:52:21,331
- Dougie, get right!
- Get right!

977
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:25,872
Where's the signal?

978
00:52:29,206 --> 00:52:30,455
Child-One, Mother.

979
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:31,538
<i>Status?</i>

980
00:52:36,331 --> 00:52:37,414
<i>Mother, Child-One.</i>

981
00:52:37,497 --> 00:52:39,099
<i>Looks like the threats
are breaking contact.</i>

982
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:40,956
Check the tape.
What'd we miss?

983
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:42,706
Rewinding footage.

984
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:49,914
Bishop?

985
00:52:58,039 --> 00:52:59,224
This motorcycle's
placed something

986
00:52:59,248 --> 00:53:00,326
on the side of the vehicle.

987
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:12,539
Base, Bretsky,
Reed, KIA.

988
00:53:18,372 --> 00:53:20,039
Mother, Child-One,
contact, contact.

989
00:53:20,123 --> 00:53:21,248
Vehicle is down hard.

990
00:53:32,123 --> 00:53:33,622
<i>Mother, we're
surrounded, need help.</i>

991
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:35,414
<i>Multiple hostiles
behind vehicles.</i>

992
00:53:36,123 --> 00:53:37,164
Alice, go!

993
00:53:39,831 --> 00:53:40,914
Back up, back up, back up!

994
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:42,996
Mother, Child-One. We're
in contact. Major contact.

995
00:53:56,914 --> 00:53:58,372
<i>Child-One, Mother.</i>

996
00:53:58,455 --> 00:54:00,455
<i>What is the status
of the package?</i>

997
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:02,414
Mother,
we have the package.

998
00:54:02,497 --> 00:54:04,081
The car's down hard.
We're evacing now.

999
00:54:05,414 --> 00:54:06,414
Sam, get cover.

1000
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,288
Mother, Child-One.
We need a new car.

1001
00:54:21,247 --> 00:54:22,247
On it.

1002
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,956
They're gonna need
another route.

1003
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:25,557
- Big eye, what do you see?
- Yes, sir.

1004
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:38,122
Fuck!

1005
00:54:41,956 --> 00:54:42,955
Breathe.

1006
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:47,039
Scan all local
law enforcement.

1007
00:54:47,123 --> 00:54:48,956
I need to know
how much time we have.

1008
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:53,998
This car looks good.

1009
00:54:54,081 --> 00:54:55,622
Child-One, gray BMW,

1010
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:57,622
about 20 meters
in front of you.

1011
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:02,455
Dougie, gray BMW,
20 meters, one o'clock.

1012
00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:04,122
- Yes.
- Get it.

1013
00:55:07,914 --> 00:55:09,247
<i>Dougie, keep your 12.</i>

1014
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:11,208
I'm flank the fuck
out of these motherfuckers.

1015
00:55:13,664 --> 00:55:15,247
<i>Stay with the package.</i>

1016
00:55:39,163 --> 00:55:40,162
Fuck!

1017
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,372
Ready?

1018
00:55:43,163 --> 00:55:44,706
Go! We're getting
out of here now!

1019
00:55:49,414 --> 00:55:50,747
Where'd that
come from?

1020
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:52,956
Silva!

1021
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:57,539
Threat, one o'clock.

1022
00:55:57,622 --> 00:55:59,664
<i>Blue jacket, magazine stand,
grenade launcher.</i>

1023
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:10,163
Two threats advancing towards

1024
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:11,486
<i>the package
from the right side.</i>

1025
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,192
<i>Child-One,
stay with the package.</i>

1026
00:56:22,998 --> 00:56:25,039
Child-One,
cover the package.

1027
00:56:45,664 --> 00:56:47,081
BMW, now. Go!

1028
00:56:52,998 --> 00:56:54,081
Look at me.

1029
00:56:59,956 --> 00:57:00,955
I'm done.

1030
00:57:02,163 --> 00:57:03,162
You did good.

1031
00:57:04,956 --> 00:57:06,205
Child-One, get out.

1032
00:57:06,288 --> 00:57:07,372
<i>Now.</i>

1033
00:57:25,831 --> 00:57:27,789
Go, go, go.

1034
00:58:01,956 --> 00:58:03,264
What the hell
happened back there?

1035
00:58:03,288 --> 00:58:04,682
Our car is made.
We need a safe house.

1036
00:58:04,706 --> 00:58:06,080
We need to
regroup immediately.

1037
00:58:06,998 --> 00:58:07,747
No!

1038
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:08,830
Not a safe house!

1039
00:58:08,872 --> 00:58:09,871
How far is it?

1040
00:58:10,372 --> 00:58:11,288
2.3 miles ahead.

1041
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:12,556
Is this your idea
of justice, huh?

1042
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,455
Shut your mouth!

1043
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:14,414
Take me to the airport.

1044
00:58:14,497 --> 00:58:15,330
Is it secure?

1045
00:58:15,414 --> 00:58:16,473
I had three hours
to vet the place.

1046
00:58:16,497 --> 00:58:18,914
Fuck vetting.
I don't wanna hear vetting!

1047
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:20,539
Is it secure?

1048
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,831
You know what?
I want the code.

1049
00:58:21,914 --> 00:58:23,080
And I want the code now!

1050
00:58:23,163 --> 00:58:24,390
I don't give a shit
about your family.

1051
00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:26,497
I don't give a fuck
if you had three hours.

1052
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,330
I take you, and I throw you
out the side...

1053
00:58:28,414 --> 00:58:30,872
Yes, with high confidence,
it's secure.

1054
00:58:30,956 --> 00:58:33,163
See? That's all I needed.
High degree of confidence.

1055
00:58:34,288 --> 00:58:35,932
Just take me to the airport.
I'll give you what you want.

1056
00:58:35,956 --> 00:58:37,539
<i>Take the next
two rights.</i>

1057
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:43,997
<i>Take the next left.</i>

1058
00:58:45,997 --> 00:58:49,330
2-1-4-7-2 is your intro.

1059
00:58:49,414 --> 00:58:51,247
<i>Third garage on the right.</i>

1060
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:55,122
- 214.
- 72.

1061
00:59:09,455 --> 00:59:10,914
<i>Entering the den...</i>

1062
00:59:12,122 --> 00:59:13,121
<i>Getting in the networks.</i>

1063
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:16,455
<i>Visuals up.</i>

1064
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:22,622
<i>Contact is bald, male,
48 years old, blue shirt.</i>

1065
00:59:32,997 --> 00:59:34,316
This is everything
they asked for.

1066
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,122
<i>Examining for
possible threats.</i>

1067
00:59:50,122 --> 00:59:51,747
<i>Do you have
any identifiable threats,</i>

1068
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:53,539
<i>weapons? Any hostiles?</i>

1069
00:59:53,622 --> 00:59:54,872
<i>No anomalous
behavior detected.</i>

1070
00:59:54,955 --> 00:59:56,955
<i>Clean vehicle
will be there in six.</i>

1071
00:59:57,038 --> 00:59:59,038
<i>Clean vehicle
will be there in six.</i>

1072
01:00:00,122 --> 01:00:02,205
We're identifying the city.

1073
01:00:07,372 --> 01:00:09,205
<i>Noor files downloaded.</i>

1074
01:00:09,288 --> 01:00:12,330
Looks like maybe a study
abroad during university.

1075
01:00:12,414 --> 01:00:14,205
Why would that be redacted?

1076
01:00:16,955 --> 01:00:18,497
<i>We need all police to</i>

1077
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:20,122
<i>clear out
the West Papua district.</i>

1078
01:00:20,205 --> 01:00:21,598
<i>Be advised.
Police are being ordered</i>

1079
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:23,664
<i>to clear out of the area.</i>

1080
01:00:34,955 --> 01:00:36,038
Let's get ready
to move.

1081
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,122
Jimmy, we don't leave
the reservation.

1082
01:00:45,789 --> 01:00:46,848
<i>We've got
armed motorcyclist...</i>

1083
01:00:46,871 --> 01:00:49,706
<i>Armed motorcycles
on either side</i>

1084
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:51,372
<i>of the entrance to the bakery.</i>

1085
01:00:52,247 --> 01:00:53,747
<i>Angel, Knight.
Unexpected delay.</i>

1086
01:00:53,831 --> 01:00:55,789
<i>Get the fuck
out of there.</i>

1087
01:00:56,955 --> 01:00:58,794
Attack on an American officer
is an act of war.

1088
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,706
I need him back right now.

1089
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:02,580
Let me give you some advice.

1090
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:03,664
You ready?

1091
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:04,746
Stop.

1092
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:06,663
You hear me?

1093
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:08,122
Stop.

1094
01:01:08,205 --> 01:01:10,163
This is nothing personal, man.

1095
01:01:10,247 --> 01:01:12,085
- I'm just doing my job.
- I'm just doing mine.

1096
01:01:12,122 --> 01:01:13,455
Sir, I got the scope
on the man.

1097
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:14,682
You want me to take the shot?

1098
01:01:14,706 --> 01:01:15,705
No.

1099
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,079
Please, sir?

1100
01:01:17,122 --> 01:01:18,372
I heard there was a little

1101
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:19,807
unfortunate incident
on the highway.

1102
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:21,247
A little incident?

1103
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:23,080
I would really hate for it
to happen again.

1104
01:01:23,163 --> 01:01:24,664
Are you threatening me?

1105
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,181
We can do this
however you wanna do it.

1106
01:01:26,205 --> 01:01:27,973
You gonna keep coming at me
until you kill us all?

1107
01:01:27,997 --> 01:01:29,080
Yeah.

1108
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:31,539
That's a weird fucking game,
but okay, I'll play.

1109
01:01:31,622 --> 01:01:33,247
I mean, you have
home court advantage.

1110
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:34,497
You have a larger team,

1111
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,205
unlimited resources
due to the support of

1112
01:01:36,288 --> 01:01:37,955
a phenomenally
corrupt government

1113
01:01:38,038 --> 01:01:39,348
willing to kill
innocent citizens.

1114
01:01:39,372 --> 01:01:41,038
Plus, a local
special forces which

1115
01:01:41,122 --> 01:01:43,580
we designed and trained
and built for you.

1116
01:01:43,664 --> 01:01:46,789
Stop monologuing,
you bipolar fuck.

1117
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:48,288
I think he's more
manic-depressed.

1118
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:49,706
Or narcissistic disorder.

1119
01:01:49,788 --> 01:01:51,598
- Dissociative disorder.
- He's just an asshole.

1120
01:01:51,622 --> 01:01:52,913
And let's not forget
about your

1121
01:01:52,997 --> 01:01:54,288
absolutely medieval
moral compass

1122
01:01:54,372 --> 01:01:55,997
and nasty thirst for bloodshed

1123
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,306
for which there has been
no legal repercussion

1124
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:59,455
because you do not operate
under any rule of law.

1125
01:02:00,122 --> 01:02:01,122
Chaos.

1126
01:02:01,205 --> 01:02:02,556
- That's right, Jimmy.
- Yeah, but you know what?

1127
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,706
What's that, Jimmy?

1128
01:02:03,788 --> 01:02:05,307
I think I might just be
a little worse.

1129
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:09,205
<i>Child-One, Mother,
move the package now.</i>

1130
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:13,497
Get him in the car now.
Let's go.

1131
01:02:14,288 --> 01:02:15,287
Let's go.

1132
01:02:23,455 --> 01:02:25,038
Bomb! Get down now!

1133
01:02:40,706 --> 01:02:42,830
Child-One, Mother.
Status, please.

1134
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,579
Shit.

1135
01:03:05,372 --> 01:03:06,770
- Anywhere else?
- I don't think so.

1136
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:14,663
Let's go.

1137
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:30,372
In the fucking car, now!

1138
01:03:30,455 --> 01:03:31,455
Let's go.

1139
01:03:46,247 --> 01:03:48,122
<i>Child-One, gunmen.</i>

1140
01:03:51,288 --> 01:03:52,580
Go. Move!

1141
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,579
I've got package in tow.

1142
01:04:05,497 --> 01:04:06,663
Okay.

1143
01:04:14,871 --> 01:04:15,871
Alice, status?

1144
01:04:15,955 --> 01:04:16,955
He is fine.

1145
01:04:18,913 --> 01:04:19,973
Come on, Dougie.
Get your shit together.

1146
01:04:19,997 --> 01:04:21,306
He is fine. You just keep
fuckin' driving.

1147
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:22,539
You pull this shit
on me now?

1148
01:04:23,288 --> 01:04:25,497
<i>Mother, package in tow.
We have one critical.</i>

1149
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,205
We need a new vehicle ASAP.

1150
01:04:27,288 --> 01:04:28,497
What's the ETA on the plane?

1151
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:30,580
- Twenty-two minutes.
- How many miles out are we?

1152
01:04:30,663 --> 01:04:32,580
- Twelve.
- Child-One, no time.

1153
01:04:32,663 --> 01:04:34,621
Get your ass
to the airstrip now.

1154
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:35,704
Copy, Mother.

1155
01:04:53,539 --> 01:04:55,038
- Go, go!
- Spread out, spread out!

1156
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,648
Get him in the building
behind us.

1157
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:09,330
Get out of my face.

1158
01:05:10,163 --> 01:05:11,162
Go.

1159
01:05:15,705 --> 01:05:16,704
Now.

1160
01:05:21,871 --> 01:05:23,122
I got you. Yeah.

1161
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:26,539
You've got it?

1162
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:28,163
Paradise Apartment Complex.

1163
01:05:30,122 --> 01:05:31,830
I got you. I got you.

1164
01:05:49,539 --> 01:05:50,737
Oh, you give 'em hell, Dougie.

1165
01:05:51,497 --> 01:05:53,163
You just get him
to the airport.

1166
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:57,080
I will. All right, brother.

1167
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:16,621
Every normal man must be
tempted at times

1168
01:06:16,705 --> 01:06:20,497
<i>- to spit upon his hands...
- Alice!</i>

1169
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:22,080
...hoist the black flag...

1170
01:06:22,163 --> 01:06:23,621
<i>Silva,
you better be moving.</i>

1171
01:06:23,705 --> 01:06:26,163
...and begin slitting throats.

1172
01:07:32,163 --> 01:07:33,372
Fuck.

1173
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:41,746
- We got a car?
- I do.

1174
01:07:45,372 --> 01:07:46,414
Mother, Child-One.

1175
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,098
You gotta get us
the way out of here ASAP.

1176
01:07:48,122 --> 01:07:49,555
Child-One,
working on extraction point.

1177
01:07:49,579 --> 01:07:51,247
<i>Get to the south staircase.</i>

1178
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:52,746
Alice, this way.

1179
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:55,788
<i>I repeat.
Get to the south staircase.</i>

1180
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,538
<i>Copy that.
Heading south.</i>

1181
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:18,829
Sir, I've got eyes.

1182
01:08:24,288 --> 01:08:25,287
Come on.

1183
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:46,764
<i>Mother,
we are on the fourth level.</i>

1184
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:47,663
<i>What's the route?</i>

1185
01:08:47,746 --> 01:08:49,163
<i>How the fuck
do I get out of here?</i>

1186
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:53,247
Extraction point is at the end
of the second hallway,

1187
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,038
<i>coming up on your right.</i>

1188
01:09:04,163 --> 01:09:08,496
<i>Child-One, exit is 20 yards
in front of you. R-447.</i>

1189
01:09:10,788 --> 01:09:12,705
<i>That'll take you
to the extraction point</i>

1190
01:09:12,788 --> 01:09:14,579
<i>in the rear courtyard.</i>

1191
01:09:14,663 --> 01:09:16,830
Shit! Back up,
back up, back up!

1192
01:09:21,538 --> 01:09:22,537
Go.

1193
01:09:29,788 --> 01:09:30,787
Fuck!

1194
01:09:40,205 --> 01:09:41,538
Move, move. Back up!

1195
01:09:52,163 --> 01:09:53,371
Back up, back up. Now!

1196
01:09:56,955 --> 01:09:58,579
They're separated.

1197
01:10:02,705 --> 01:10:03,704
Fuck!

1198
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:08,453
Jimmy, do you copy?

1199
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:10,746
Jimmy, do you copy?

1200
01:10:20,038 --> 01:10:21,287
Mother,
I have the package.

1201
01:10:21,371 --> 01:10:22,788
<i>Do you have eyes on Alice?</i>

1202
01:10:25,329 --> 01:10:27,205
<i>- Mother?</i>
- Negative.

1203
01:10:27,287 --> 01:10:28,496
Mother, Child-One, reroute us.

1204
01:10:28,579 --> 01:10:31,955
The route out is directly
behind you. Take it.

1205
01:10:32,038 --> 01:10:35,371
<i>Stairwell, Romeo-445.</i>

1206
01:10:44,454 --> 01:10:48,538
- No.
- Child-One, no what?

1207
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:52,246
No! I'm want a route to Alice.
Reroute me to Alice now.

1208
01:10:54,788 --> 01:10:57,371
<i>It's before Bingo Fuel.
Where's the package?</i>

1209
01:10:57,454 --> 01:10:58,573
Ten minutes. We're counting.

1210
01:10:59,371 --> 01:11:01,371
Child-One, it's time.

1211
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,764
You understand a little girl
who calls her mother every day

1212
01:11:07,788 --> 01:11:08,830
because she misses her?

1213
01:11:08,913 --> 01:11:10,430
Because her mother is not home
with her?

1214
01:11:10,454 --> 01:11:11,538
She's here with you.

1215
01:11:11,621 --> 01:11:13,496
She is here for you.

1216
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:31,163
Option one,
open the disc and end this.

1217
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:32,246
Exit.

1218
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:33,663
Option two, we let her die.

1219
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:38,454
<i>Repeat,
the order is to exit.</i>

1220
01:11:38,538 --> 01:11:39,955
Now!

1221
01:11:41,287 --> 01:11:42,329
Let's go get her.

1222
01:11:43,955 --> 01:11:45,204
<i>Let's go get her.</i>

1223
01:11:45,287 --> 01:11:46,746
Son of a bitch.

1224
01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:52,080
Do not fuck me.

1225
01:11:52,913 --> 01:11:53,913
Let's go.

1226
01:11:53,997 --> 01:11:55,555
Mother, Child-One.
Make it dark in here.

1227
01:11:57,371 --> 01:11:58,371
Fine.

1228
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:43,705
Go.

1229
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:55,204
<i>Stay here.</i>

1230
01:13:02,121 --> 01:13:03,788
Silva, do you copy?

1231
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:06,913
Silva, do you copy?
Silva, do you copy?

1232
01:15:03,162 --> 01:15:05,621
Hey, Jimmy, all you had to do
was hand him over.

1233
01:15:06,621 --> 01:15:08,538
<i>Who?
You mean the low-level cop?</i>

1234
01:15:26,287 --> 01:15:28,138
What's the rush, Jimmy?
You got somewhere to be?

1235
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:29,180
- Fuck you.
- I could do this

1236
01:15:29,204 --> 01:15:30,204
all day, baby.

1237
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,996
Please. I'm a...

1238
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:52,705
Please, I'm a mother. Please.

1239
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:55,370
I have a...

1240
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:57,204
I have a daughter.

1241
01:16:14,121 --> 01:16:16,496
Hey, Jimmy, you and I, we
could have made a great team.

1242
01:16:16,579 --> 01:16:18,830
You happen to have any more
.45 caliber ammo back there?

1243
01:16:18,913 --> 01:16:19,996
Here it is!

1244
01:17:34,746 --> 01:17:36,204
Let's go. Now. Move.

1245
01:17:36,287 --> 01:17:38,663
Fucking wasted 10 minutes
coming back for you.

1246
01:17:52,788 --> 01:17:53,788
Child-One,

1247
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:56,870
<i>Nissan pickup,
back parking lot.</i>

1248
01:17:56,954 --> 01:17:59,538
<i>Repeat. It's at the back
of the building.</i>

1249
01:18:03,204 --> 01:18:04,746
Come on, come on.

1250
01:18:04,829 --> 01:18:05,828
Let's go.

1251
01:18:19,705 --> 01:18:21,829
Mother, Child-One.
What's our route?

1252
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,189
<i>Child-One,
stand by for new route.</i>

1253
01:18:25,121 --> 01:18:28,329
We have their location.
Let's go.

1254
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:29,413
<i>Child-One...</i>

1255
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:32,663
Child-One, the route
is directly behind you.

1256
01:18:32,746 --> 01:18:33,745
<i>Take it.</i>

1257
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:41,305
<i>- Engines turning.
- Copy that. Roger.</i>

1258
01:18:41,329 --> 01:18:42,954
<i>We're buttoned up.
Oscar Mike.</i>

1259
01:18:43,037 --> 01:18:44,538
<i>- We are set.
- Let's go.</i>

1260
01:18:44,621 --> 01:18:46,787
The end of an operation
is euphoric.

1261
01:18:51,579 --> 01:18:53,870
It's placing that last piece
in the puzzle.

1262
01:18:55,996 --> 01:18:57,912
You know
the euphoria cannot last.

1263
01:18:57,996 --> 01:18:59,454
<i>Ten minutes
to Bingo Fuel.</i>

1264
01:18:59,538 --> 01:19:00,787
<i>Where is your package?</i>

1265
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:02,709
<i>Window is closing.
We need to be wheels-up now!</i>

1266
01:19:02,787 --> 01:19:04,538
Get your ass
to the airstrip now.

1267
01:19:04,621 --> 01:19:05,620
<i>Yeah,
I'm working on that.</i>

1268
01:19:06,454 --> 01:19:07,912
You tell yourself,
"This one time..."

1269
01:19:07,996 --> 01:19:10,037
<i>If I wait, we're all
gonna die. Hurry the fuck up!</i>

1270
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:11,280
"...just might be different."

1271
01:19:14,829 --> 01:19:15,868
"Just might be different."

1272
01:19:17,121 --> 01:19:19,204
Have you confirmed
with the ground team?

1273
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:20,745
Yes, they're ready.

1274
01:19:20,829 --> 01:19:21,912
Good.

1275
01:19:23,204 --> 01:19:26,121
"Today I just might be able
to just hold it, catch it

1276
01:19:28,745 --> 01:19:30,496
"in my hands
and look at it."

1277
01:19:33,705 --> 01:19:35,263
<i>Tell them to stop the plane.
We're here.</i>

1278
01:19:44,496 --> 01:19:47,162
Mother, we don't have time
for this.

1279
01:19:48,287 --> 01:19:49,329
- King.
- Yup.

1280
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:53,870
Child-One, Mother.
My pleasure.

1281
01:19:57,079 --> 01:19:58,079
Target acquired.

1282
01:19:58,704 --> 01:19:59,703
Take it.

1283
01:20:07,121 --> 01:20:08,120
Let's go.

1284
01:20:13,371 --> 01:20:14,870
What's the status
of the plane?

1285
01:20:14,954 --> 01:20:16,287
<i>The LZ's hot.
We're rolling.</i>

1286
01:20:17,162 --> 01:20:18,204
Child-One...

1287
01:20:18,287 --> 01:20:19,486
You tell those fuckers
to wait.

1288
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:24,246
They're gonna stay put
no matter what.

1289
01:20:24,329 --> 01:20:25,413
<i>Overwatch is requesting...</i>

1290
01:20:25,496 --> 01:20:27,037
<i>Negative.
The window is closing.</i>

1291
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:29,745
Tell those pilots
I don't give a fuck!

1292
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:32,837
<i>Tell 'em we're here.
We're on the runway now.</i>

1293
01:20:35,329 --> 01:20:37,204
<i>Holy shit! Abort!
Abort! Abort!</i>

1294
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:38,579
<i>Abort! Abort! Abort!</i>

1295
01:20:39,246 --> 01:20:40,912
<i>Abort! Copy that.
We're aborting!</i>

1296
01:20:40,996 --> 01:20:42,263
<i>Okay. Tell me
when the package is there.</i>

1297
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:43,287
<i>Copy.</i>

1298
01:20:44,496 --> 01:20:45,829
Let's go. Move.

1299
01:20:45,912 --> 01:20:47,787
Code. Now.

1300
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:48,869
Hey.

1301
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:51,204
You got something for me now?

1302
01:20:52,287 --> 01:20:57,704
R-O-Z-H-D-E-S-T-V-O...

1303
01:20:57,787 --> 01:20:58,829
<i>1-1-1.</i>

1304
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:01,538
Mother, Child-One,
Rebel, Oz...

1305
01:21:01,621 --> 01:21:03,496
<i>R-O-Z-H-D-</i>

1306
01:21:03,579 --> 01:21:04,954
E-S-T...
<i>- Trust, Virgin,</i>

1307
01:21:05,037 --> 01:21:07,745
<i>- Oyster, triple-one.</i>
- V-O-1-1-1.

1308
01:21:08,996 --> 01:21:10,204
This is a hard line of work.

1309
01:21:10,287 --> 01:21:11,486
What line is that? Witchcraft?

1310
01:21:12,246 --> 01:21:13,246
Our line.

1311
01:21:13,329 --> 01:21:15,579
We are not in the same line.
Respectfully.

1312
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,413
Respectfully, we are.

1313
01:21:21,329 --> 01:21:23,079
It stopped. The clock stopped.

1314
01:21:24,037 --> 01:21:25,538
We have five locations
of the caesium.

1315
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,454
Five locations
have been confirmed.

1316
01:21:27,538 --> 01:21:28,736
They're being sent to Langley.

1317
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:31,287
<i>He's clear.
Put him on the plane.</i>

1318
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:33,453
Go.

1319
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:36,037
Hands up.

1320
01:21:36,454 --> 01:21:37,453
Embark.

1321
01:21:39,287 --> 01:21:40,287
<i>He's clear.</i>

1322
01:21:40,371 --> 01:21:41,787
This might actually work.

1323
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:43,263
- Okay, we're rolling.
- Let's move.

1324
01:21:43,287 --> 01:21:44,472
<i>Let's get this package
out of here.</i>

1325
01:21:44,496 --> 01:21:45,495
<i>Clear.</i>

1326
01:21:47,413 --> 01:21:48,662
You got six days. Go.

1327
01:21:49,246 --> 01:21:50,245
Go be a mother.

1328
01:21:50,787 --> 01:21:51,786
Go.

1329
01:21:55,037 --> 01:21:56,036
I'll be back in five.

1330
01:21:59,954 --> 01:22:00,953
Oh, hey.

1331
01:22:02,954 --> 01:22:04,193
Say hello to your Mother
for me.

1332
01:22:09,912 --> 01:22:10,911
My what?

1333
01:22:11,912 --> 01:22:12,996
Say hello to who?

1334
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:14,496
What the fuck did you say?

1335
01:22:26,954 --> 01:22:28,037
What are you doing?

1336
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:37,371
It's odd.
They're spiking.

1337
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:40,620
Maybe he doesn't like planes.

1338
01:22:53,287 --> 01:22:54,454
Madam General.

1339
01:22:55,287 --> 01:22:57,287
It's almost time,
would you like to watch?

1340
01:22:57,371 --> 01:22:58,454
Yes.

1341
01:22:59,371 --> 01:23:01,704
Bishop, look.

1342
01:23:02,329 --> 01:23:03,527
It's taking over our computer.

1343
01:23:06,204 --> 01:23:07,454
It's not done encoding.

1344
01:23:14,662 --> 01:23:15,662
Who's that?

1345
01:23:16,121 --> 01:23:17,120
Who is that?

1346
01:23:24,454 --> 01:23:25,453
What is this?

1347
01:23:28,662 --> 01:23:29,912
Meditation, Alice.

1348
01:23:32,413 --> 01:23:33,531
Keeps me focused on the job.

1349
01:23:35,121 --> 01:23:36,246
The code is Russian.

1350
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:38,704
Jesus. All things Russian.

1351
01:23:39,454 --> 01:23:42,413
The code word is Russian
for Christmas.

1352
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:44,329
It says 111 Christmas...

1353
01:23:45,162 --> 01:23:46,161
Christmas Street?

1354
01:23:49,537 --> 01:23:51,287
It's a Trojan horse op.

1355
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:58,413
<i>Take off, wheels up.</i>

1356
01:23:58,495 --> 01:23:59,870
He's not a double agent.

1357
01:24:03,037 --> 01:24:04,787
He's a triple agent.

1358
01:24:20,745 --> 01:24:21,744
Oh, my God.

1359
01:24:22,162 --> 01:24:23,204
He's a Russian.

1360
01:24:23,287 --> 01:24:25,745
Child-One, Mother.
Keep them on the ground.

1361
01:24:25,829 --> 01:24:27,371
<i>I repeat. Keep them on the...</i>

1362
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:32,078
Gotcha.

1363
01:24:32,787 --> 01:24:33,786
No!

1364
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:50,870
<i>This is
a very simple story.</i>

1365
01:24:54,204 --> 01:24:55,371
Killed the wrong kid.

1366
01:24:57,829 --> 01:24:58,954
<i>Eighteen years of age...</i>

1367
01:25:02,954 --> 01:25:04,162
<i>A mother lost her son,</i>

1368
01:25:04,246 --> 01:25:06,662
<i>and it turns out
she was a very powerful lady.</i>

1369
01:25:13,704 --> 01:25:15,287
Failure of imagination.

1370
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:16,609
<i>You mean
the death of Overwatch.</i>

1371
01:25:18,037 --> 01:25:19,121
Death of what?

1372
01:25:19,204 --> 01:25:20,329
Overwatch.

1373
01:25:20,412 --> 01:25:21,745
You were the target.

1374
01:25:23,787 --> 01:25:25,079
<i>Mayday!
Package is armed</i>

1375
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:26,246
<i>and attempting hostile...</i>

1376
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:27,662
He did everything right.

1377
01:25:27,745 --> 01:25:29,578
He was unpredictable.
Highly trained.

1378
01:25:31,453 --> 01:25:32,532
<i>Recruited
when he was young.</i>

1379
01:25:32,954 --> 01:25:34,620
He convinced us
he did not trust us,

1380
01:25:34,704 --> 01:25:36,162
and then convinced us
to trust him.

1381
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,162
Do you wanna
talk about Alice?

1382
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:46,037
Do you wanna talk about what
happened on that airplane?

1383
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:47,121
<i>Mayday!
Mayday! Mayday!</i>

1384
01:25:47,204 --> 01:25:48,287
<i>Cockpit has been breached!</i>

1385
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:50,412
<i>Package is armed.
Direct to immediate LZ.</i>

1386
01:25:50,495 --> 01:25:51,578
No.

1387
01:25:56,829 --> 01:25:57,829
<i>You already know this.</i>

1388
01:25:57,912 --> 01:25:58,911
Tell me again.

1389
01:25:58,954 --> 01:26:00,392
I've already gone over this
with you.

1390
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:05,787
They activated him
to make us activate Overwatch.

1391
01:26:09,537 --> 01:26:10,787
Say hello to your Mother
for me.

1392
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:12,704
<i>Bishop, come in.
Can you hear me?</i>

1393
01:26:12,787 --> 01:26:14,578
<i>Bishop, can you
hear me? Bishop? Over.</i>

1394
01:26:14,662 --> 01:26:15,954
I think there is no defense

1395
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:17,222
against someone
willing to die.

1396
01:26:17,246 --> 01:26:19,246
Someone capable
of cultivating our trust

1397
01:26:19,328 --> 01:26:21,537
by offering us
the one thing that we want,

1398
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:22,912
and the one thing
that we need,

1399
01:26:22,996 --> 01:26:24,674
that's the real weapon
of mass destruction.

1400
01:26:26,996 --> 01:26:28,495
A killer
who looks like a hero.

1401
01:26:34,495 --> 01:26:35,829
<i>The great game continues.</i>

1402
01:26:41,412 --> 01:26:42,411
<i>Today was yours.</i>

1403
01:26:54,246 --> 01:26:55,578
I'll see you tomorrow.
