Hello, Chicago.

16
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:04,294
How are you?
Wow wow.

17
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:06,664
<i>( Cheering, applause )</i>

18
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:08,466
Thank you so much.

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,804
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

20
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,440
I, um...
Thank you. Thank you.

21
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:14,943
That was an amazing welcome.

22
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:17,146
I should explain something
straightaway.

23
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:20,318
Usually when I come out
onstage, it's amazing, okay?

24
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:22,822
I'm doing cartwheels
and backflips.

25
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:25,392
It's fucking spectacular,
right?

26
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:27,864
But I've hurt my back.
That's true actually.

27
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:29,899
I've pulled a muscle in
my spine playing golf.

28
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:31,301
I know what you're thinking...

29
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:33,268
Serves me right for playing
such a stupid game as golf.

30
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,269
But no, I've been in agony.

31
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,437
I'm actually on painkillers right now,
so... No, it's true.

32
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:42,906
If I suddenly start talking like
Paula Abdul, you'll know why.

33
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,140
I'm not drunk.

34
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:47,508
So when the doctor...
This is true.

35
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:49,276
When the doctor gave me
the painkillers,

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,812
he said, "Now, you can't
drink alcohol with these."

37
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:54,181
And I went, "I don't
want them then."

38
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:57,016
And he went, "What?"

39
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,985
I said, "Give me something
you can drink alcohol with."

40
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,655
And he went, "Well, you're not meant
to drink with any painkillers."

41
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,456
"Who are you,
my fucking mother?

42
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,025
Just..."

43
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:10,061
So I've been walking round
like the elephant man for days,

44
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,964
but without the big cock
obviously.

45
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:15,900
I assume he had a big elephant's
cock to match the head.

46
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,735
That would make things
all right then, wouldn't it?

47
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:19,436
That would sort of
balance it out,

48
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,471
because then he'd look in the
mirror and he'd sort of go,

49
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:23,439
( muttering )
"Oh no.

50
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:26,342
Oh look at that fucking head.

51
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,176
Hold on, though.
What's going on down here?"

52
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,077
Like, "Hey!"

53
00:02:30,112 --> 00:02:31,545
Swings it round about.

54
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:35,448
"So let's celebrate.
The buns are on me."

55
00:02:35,482 --> 00:02:37,751
So yeah, that's my problems.

56
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:39,218
I didn't cancel though.

57
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:41,054
Don't you hate that,
when a night is canceled?

58
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:43,956
You turn up, it goes, "Concert
canceled due to sore throat."

59
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:46,759
Aw. Or "I couldn't go on.
I was depressed."

60
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,627
Aw, poor little artist.

61
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:50,862
Can you imagine
the laborer trying that?

62
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:53,131
Turning up and going, "I've got a
little tickle and I'm fed up."

63
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:56,267
Aw, move
the fucking bricks, mate.

64
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:58,802
Never cancel.

65
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:02,506
I had a gig in Dublin
a couple of months ago, okay?

66
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,608
- And as you know, Dublin is in Ireland...
- <i>( Applause )</i>

67
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,611
Which is off of...
Yeah, it's off the coast of Great Britain.

68
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,680
It's not part of Britain,
but it's very close.

69
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:12,015
It's sort of like
our Cuba, I suppose.

70
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,117
It's like...

71
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,818
Man: <i>Ouch!</i>

72
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:18,619
( Laughs )

73
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:22,223
And... and so...

74
00:03:22,257 --> 00:03:26,292
Okay, so Dublin, O2 arena,

75
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:29,361
10,000 seats sold out
well in advance,

76
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,831
flights booked,
really looking forward to it.

77
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:33,566
A few days before the gig,

78
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,567
they start grounding
the airplanes

79
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:38,803
because there's a volcanic ash
cloud over Britain, okay?

80
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:40,438
And if you fly through it,
apparently,

81
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:42,072
it would make the plane
fall out of the sky.

82
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:44,107
And it was like that was it.
You couldn't fly in that.

83
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,977
I mean, a volcano goes off
in Iceland and we can't...

84
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,312
What's the point
of Iceland, really?

85
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:52,380
You know what I mean?
What are they think...

86
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:56,083
Just fill in all the volcanoes
with concrete, okay?

87
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:58,552
Just...
In fact, tarmac the whole country

88
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,487
and make it a car park
for real Europe,

89
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,022
because it's a waste
of fucking space, okay?

90
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:08,226
And so I'm thinking,
"Well, I've gotta get there.

91
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,862
I can't cancel."

92
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:12,830
And there were pop stars and
people coming over from America,

93
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:15,532
and they were canceling their flight
because they couldn't get in and out.

94
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:16,733
I thought, "I can't."

95
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:20,168
So I hired a helicopter
to and from Dublin.

96
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:23,304
It cost me £12,000, right.

97
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:25,605
Just because I couldn't bear
to let anyone down

98
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,207
or take the ferry.

99
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:29,408
That was...

100
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,777
They were still running, sure.

101
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:35,914
But that would have meant
mixing with the general public,

102
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:37,615
and I don't...

103
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,849
This is about as close
as I ever... you know.

104
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:42,786
So...

105
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,387
I don't know if you were affected
by the volcanic ash cloud,

106
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:48,089
but I had friends that were
stuck all over the world.

107
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:49,957
And they missed weddings
and funerals,

108
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:52,027
and they had to
put themselves up in a hotel

109
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:54,428
for extra days
they hadn't budgeted for.

110
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:57,097
And they couldn't get their money back
because the airlines were saying,

111
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,433
"No, we can't pay you because the
insurance companies won't pay us,

112
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,535
because they're saying
it's an act of God."

113
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,305
Well, what isn't an act of God?

114
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,474
Look, if you believe in God,

115
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,109
that's sort of a definition
of him, isn't it?

116
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,346
That he does everything.
Isn't that right?

117
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,514
Everything is an act of him.

118
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,083
He's all-powerful.
He's everywhere at once.

119
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,918
He invented every...
There was nothing before him.

120
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:24,154
He invented time, everything.
He's across it all.

121
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,323
He doesn't miss a trick
and he's not absent-minded.

122
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:29,358
A volcano going off isn't like him
going, "Fuck, I left the oven on."

123
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:31,126
You know, it's...

124
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:36,465
And who are these
insurance companies

125
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,601
that can decide what is
and isn't an act of God?

126
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:39,802
How do they know?

127
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:41,804
Have they got a hotline to God?

128
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:43,305
They call him up, do they?

129
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,840
Ring ring.
Ring ring.

130
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:46,441
"Yello?"

131
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,076
"Uh, can I speak
to God, please?"

132
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,844
"Speaking."

133
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:53,946
"Oh, I didn't think you'd
answer the phone yourself."

134
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,881
"What do you want?"

135
00:05:55,916 --> 00:06:00,385
"Oh, um, that volcanic ash cloud...
Was that you?"

136
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,353
"Yeah yeah.

137
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:04,854
Yes, that was
an act of me, all right."

138
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,322
"So I shouldn't pay out?"

139
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:09,024
"No, don't fucking pay 'em
a penny, son, no."

140
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:11,126
"Brilliant brilliant.
While I've got you here,

141
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,962
did you make a tree fall
on Steve Baxter's car?"

142
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:16,764
"There's a lot
of Steve Baxters."

143
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:20,500
"Steve Baxter, 2 Acacia Road, Hounslow.

144
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:24,002
It happened at 2:15 on the
3rd of June this year."

145
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:28,440
"2:15, 3rd of...
No, that wasn't me.

146
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:31,610
I was in Africa that day
giving AIDS to babies."

147
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:42,620
He does everything.
He does everything.

148
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:45,957
Mm, I don't make the rules.

149
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:49,594
And well, I'm glad I didn't cancel

150
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:52,697
because it's fantastic to be here
seeing your happy smiley faces,

151
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:54,165
probably feeling very fortunate

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,367
that you managed to get a
ticket to see a living legend.

153
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:58,835
- Or am I...
- <i>( Cheering, applause )</i>

154
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:01,369
Shut up.

155
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:07,007
I know, I know.
You lucky fuckers.

156
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,543
You really... I'm joking, of course.
The pleasure is all mine.

157
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:12,045
Thank you so much
for coming out,

158
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,580
spending your
hard-earned cash.

159
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:15,415
I know there's been
a recession on.

160
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,820
Someone told me.
I hadn't really...

161
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,321
Is it still...
I don't...

162
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:24,591
It really didn't affect me
if I'm being honest.

163
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,225
Oh dear.

164
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,628
We can laugh about it now.
No, come on.

165
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,296
I don't understand
the recession.

166
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,297
It wasn't till last year
I found out

167
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:35,332
you could go
into your bank and say,

168
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,267
"Can I withdraw
my cash?"

169
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:40,503
And they could go, "No."
"What?"

170
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:43,605
( Weaselly voice )
"No, we ain't got it."

171
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,340
"I've got £50,000 saved."

172
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,941
( Laughs )
"You ain't. You ain't."

173
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:51,811
"Where is it?"
"Lost it."

174
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:53,512
"Well, have you checked
the vault?"

175
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:56,447
"It's empty."
"Well, what was the point of that?

176
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:59,383
You might as well have kept it in a
drawer, you spotty little twat."

177
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,850
I don't...

178
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,252
I hope you enjoy the show.

179
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:03,752
Or you'll let me know,
won't you?

180
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:06,955
If I say something funny,
you'll laugh and I'll go,

181
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:09,290
"Oh, I'll keep that in
for the rest of the tour."

182
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:10,991
If I say something that isn't
funny, you won't laugh

183
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:12,493
and I'll go,
"I'll lose that bit."

184
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:14,428
So some bits tonight
will be exclusive to you.

185
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:19,533
They... they will be
the shit bits, granted.

186
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,835
Okay, let's start the show.
Let's get on with it.

187
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,004
No one wants to be here
all night.

188
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,272
You can have too much
of a good thing, can't you?

189
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:29,809
Like heroin.
What?

190
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,011
Though too much heroin
is death, basically.

191
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,679
That's when you know
you've had too...

192
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:39,116
You go, "Fuck, I'm dead.
I'm fucked."

193
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,985
That's the thing though
with heroin.

194
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,854
Try anything once, kids,
sure, but know this.

195
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:45,489
No no.

196
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:47,257
You think, "I'll try a heroin.

197
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,192
I'll just try one.
Give me... give me a heroin.

198
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,994
Give me one heroin, okay?"

199
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:52,662
Just have one.
"What's it like?"

200
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:54,130
"It's fuckin' lovely.

201
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,565
I want more.
I can't just have..."

202
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,866
It's like Pringles.

203
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,669
It's like once you pop,
you can't stop.

204
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:03,805
That's... I think that's how it works.
I'm not an expert.

205
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,841
Believe it or not, I've
never been a heroin addict.

206
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,743
No round of applause for that?

207
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:11,077
See? No.
See?

208
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:13,646
No round of applause for never
having been a heroin addict.

209
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,481
If I'd have come out here
and go, "I used to be a heroin addict...

210
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:18,851
I used to mug people and
shit myself in doorways..."

211
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:21,819
- <i>( Cheering, applause )</i>
- Exactly. "Oh yeah!

212
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,655
He... he hasn't done
those things for a while.

213
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,190
He hasn't done those things

214
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:27,691
that we never did
in the first place."

215
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:29,660
Why are you applauding someone
for suddenly acting

216
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,295
like a normal member
of society?

217
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,329
It's like I've lost
a bit of weight.

218
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,829
I've lost about 20 lbs.
Exactly!

219
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:37,598
- <i>( Cheering, applause )</i>
- What? No no.

220
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:39,900
You're basically applauding me

221
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,769
for only eating
as much as I need now.

222
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:46,073
I should have... I should have
always been doing that.

223
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:49,176
I got fat because I was
a greedy, lazy bastard.

224
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:52,880
There's no other explan...
and I needed people to...

225
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:55,983
They come up to me now and they go,
"Oh, well done. You look great."

226
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:57,985
But they weren't telling me
I looked terrible.

227
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,853
They're basically saying
I looked terrible,

228
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:01,822
but no one told me at the time.
It was really taboo.

229
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:03,557
I needed waiters
to come over and go,

230
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:05,993
"Fuck off.
You've had enough."

231
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:09,395
And I've been criticized
in the past

232
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,897
for having a go at fat people.

233
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:13,098
I've never had
a go at fat people.

234
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:16,901
I've only ever pointed out
the fact that you get fat

235
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:19,036
if you take in more calories
than you burn off..

236
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,504
That's simple science.

237
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:22,472
I don't judge them in any
other aspect of their life.

238
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:25,341
But that's what happens...
You get fat if you take in

239
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,910
more calories
than you burn off.

240
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:30,712
That's indisputable, okay?

241
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:33,647
Now the thing is people think
I'm having a go.

242
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:35,615
I'm not because
I don't judge them.

243
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,950
If I see a fat person, I don't
make assumptions about them

244
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:39,218
other than how they got fat.

245
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:40,819
And, this is the other thing,

246
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:43,788
they...
No, wait wait.

247
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:45,623
Not only is that
what makes you fat...

248
00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:47,491
People know that's what's
making them fat.

249
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:51,293
No one got fat
behind their own back.

250
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:55,129
No one ate and then went,
"What the fuck's that?"

251
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:57,598
It's not a surprise.
It's a gradual process.

252
00:10:57,632 --> 00:10:59,232
You have loads of time
to back out

253
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,702
from this project at any...

254
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:04,104
Also, no one's sneaking
into thin people's apartments

255
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:06,440
and then injecting their lettuce
with a million calories.

256
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:09,076
That doesn't happen, okay?
They know what's doing...

257
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,544
If you go to a bloke and he's surrounded
by cakes and pies

258
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,280
and you go, "You know what's
making you fat, don't ya?"

259
00:11:14,314 --> 00:11:16,114
He doesn't go,
"Is it all the running?"

260
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:18,216
He knows what...

261
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:23,721
But I don't make judgments
other than how they got fat.

262
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:25,623
If I see a fat person,
I don't go,

263
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:30,127
"Oh, he's fat, therefore he's jolly,"
right?

264
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:32,596
A lot of them are miserable,
aren't they?

265
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,266
If... if I see a fat girl,
I don't go,

266
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,635
"Oh, she'd be pretty
if she lost weight."

267
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,370
That's rarely the case.

268
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:47,744
So don't fall for that.

269
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,245
A lot of them started eating

270
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,348
because they had fuck all
to lose, so...

271
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:54,317
No.

272
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:56,519
But there's no stigma
attached because...

273
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:58,787
People don't even want to use
the word "fat" now

274
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:00,289
because they think
it's derogatory.

275
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:02,491
It's a real taboo subject,
so they use euphemisms.

276
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:07,294
They go, "Oh, you know Brenda,
the f-- big girl?"

277
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:10,129
"What, seven foot?"
"No no. Not tall."

278
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:12,865
"What does she look like?"
"Brenda... you know, she...

279
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,134
She's the one who's clammy
even in winter."

280
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,070
Just say she's fat. Nothing wrong with it.
It's their choice.

281
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:21,104
It's up to you if you wanna be fat.
But they don't.

282
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:22,739
They go, "You know, Brenda...

283
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:25,575
She's out of breath just standing up
at her desk."

284
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,709
Just...

285
00:12:30,446 --> 00:12:33,848
But even though
it is their own fault...

286
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,850
and it is their own fault...

287
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:38,686
I feel sorry for them,
all right.

288
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:42,422
No, I do,
particularly fat women,

289
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:44,223
cause fat is a feminist issue.

290
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:46,058
Men get fat and we just go, "Fuck it.

291
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,895
All bought and paid for."
You know.

292
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:51,564
We don't come under the same
constraints of society,

293
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:55,400
whereas women are inundated with
images of how you should be...

294
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:57,935
size 0 models, this diet,
that diet.

295
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,570
Look like this.
Keep your man.

296
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,438
And they make such an effort,
don't they, fat girls?

297
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:02,939
They've always got lovely hair.

298
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:04,707
Aren't they?
They're always having their hair done.

299
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,676
They've got lovely hair.
Always got lovely hair.

300
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,445
Always got those lovely
false nails, don't they?

301
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:13,482
They make an effort.
Anything but jogging, right?

302
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:18,785
They love high heels,
don't they?

303
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,221
They think it makes their legs look less...
It doesn't.

304
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:23,155
It just...

305
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,791
You can just hear them
coming now.

306
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:32,196
I don't want any fat people to feel
uncomfortable at one of my gigs.

307
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:34,097
So next time, buy two seats.

308
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:36,699
I'm... I'm joking.
There's... I'm joking.

309
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,100
Shut up.

310
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:42,336
I'm not having a go; I'm just
pointing out, you know...

311
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,405
I was listening to the radio
in England a few weeks back.

312
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,073
Radio 4, quite highbrow.

313
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:49,074
There was a discussion
about political correctness.

314
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,209
My name came up straightaway.

315
00:13:51,243 --> 00:13:53,911
And there was this woman
on there going,

316
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:55,779
"Oh yeah, well, it's not right.

317
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:58,448
Ricky Gervais, he makes jokes
about fat people.

318
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:00,683
He wouldn't make jokes
about gay people, would he?

319
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:02,918
And being fat
is like being gay."

320
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:05,353
What? No it's not.
What?

321
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:07,755
You can't choose
your sexuality.

322
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,457
As we've established...
You choose whether to eat too much or not.

323
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:13,227
You know, with your sexuality,

324
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:15,428
you're born, you grow up,

325
00:14:15,462 --> 00:14:17,664
you discover you like
same-sex relationships,

326
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:19,799
and that's it.
You're gay, okay?

327
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:22,935
For being gay to be
the same as being fat,

328
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,370
you'd have to be born,
be straight,

329
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,039
grow up knowing
you're straight,

330
00:14:27,073 --> 00:14:30,742
but gradually and consciously
wean yourself onto cock.

331
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:40,851
"Happy 16th birthday, son.

332
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:43,820
This is Raoul.

333
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:45,755
Suck his cock."

334
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,156
"Sorry, father?"

335
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,358
"Suck his cock.
16 now. Suck his cock."

336
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:50,826
"I... I'm heterosexual."

337
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,128
"Oh, with his newfangled words.

338
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:55,530
Suck his cock,
come on."

339
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:57,299
"I... I don't
like cock, father."

340
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,533
"'Doesn't like cock.'

341
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,301
How would you know
if you've never tried it?

342
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:03,003
Ah! Suck his cock."

343
00:15:03,037 --> 00:15:05,504
"I don't..."
"Suck one cock. Suck..."

344
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,972
"Ugh." "Well, that's not sucking it.
That's playing with it.

345
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,207
Put it in your mouth.
Put it..."

346
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,375
"Ugh. Oh."

347
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,044
"Look, have a go.
You might like it."

348
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,379
"Ugh."
"It's not so bad, is it?"

349
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:20,216
"No, it's not.
I fucking love these!"

350
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:22,884
If that happened,
then being gay

351
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,419
would be the same as being fat.

352
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:27,856
But it doesn't,
so it's not, okay?

353
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,127
I was on a plane last year

354
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:34,763
going from New York
to L.A.

355
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:38,099
And me and my girlfriend
were on one side of the plane.

356
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:39,534
There was the aisle.

357
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:43,937
And the other side...
There were these two huge, fat men.

358
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:45,705
Proper proper proper fat.

359
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:48,140
One of them just got on and went,
"Can I have a belt extension?"

360
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:49,842
"Yeah, of course you can.
You've earned it."

361
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:53,211
So... proper...

362
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,213
In fact, I was thinking
of calling the pilot out

363
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,448
and going, "Should one of us
swap with one of them?

364
00:15:57,482 --> 00:15:59,717
Otherwise we're just
going to Canada.

365
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,885
Do you know
what I mean?"

366
00:16:04,957 --> 00:16:08,593
And one of them was even
fatter than the other one.

367
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:11,829
She was there and she'd
got on the plane

368
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:15,498
with one of those take-away
buckets of fast food.

369
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,966
Bucket!

370
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,334
I mean,
there's your first clue.

371
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:19,535
When did that happen?

372
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:20,936
When did fat people
just give up?

373
00:16:20,971 --> 00:16:23,205
When did they go into a shop
and go, "Oh, fuck it.

374
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,873
Just treat me like
a farmyard animal."

375
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:26,742
"Really?"
"Give me it in a bucket.

376
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:30,145
In fact, just strap it to my fuckin' head
and I'll just..."

377
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:32,680
"A bucket? Really?

378
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:34,282
You want your meal
in a bucket?"

379
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:35,950
"Yes."

380
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:39,152
So she's there
and she's chowing down.

381
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:43,323
And I swear she turns
to her fat friend and says,

382
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:46,491
"This is the best fried chicken
I've had all day."

383
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:53,964
But I'm not having a go.
I'm not having a go.

384
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:57,434
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.

385
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:59,603
Because even though
it is their own fault...

386
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:01,571
and it is their own fault...

387
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:04,174
I don't know if you know this
about fat people...

388
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:06,377
They fucking love cake.

389
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:10,146
They love it.
They love it, right?

390
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,948
And I blame
the food industries,

391
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:15,050
because you go
into a supermarket

392
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,685
and it's just packed
with that stuff.

393
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,686
Everything's packed
with hydrogenated fats

394
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,821
and extra calories and sugar

395
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:22,456
and butter and everything.

396
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,190
And they...
they love that.

397
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:27,359
And there's always a big door,
isn't there, to a supermarket.

398
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,827
There's always a...
They've got a quadruple door, isn't it?

399
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:33,998
No one's ever been too fat to get through
the door of a supermarket, okay?

400
00:17:34,032 --> 00:17:36,134
And it opens automatically,
so they don't have to

401
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:37,936
waste calories
pushing anything.

402
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,071
There's just...
And it's a good job it opens automatically

403
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:42,573
because usually it's glass and they
can see the pie from down the road

404
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,741
and they're in like that.

405
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,578
Grazing, right?

406
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:52,116
So I say keep the big door.
Keep the big door.

407
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,785
Sure, keep the big door.
Come on, fat people. Come... In you go.

408
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:57,754
But when they get in there,
it's all fresh fruit and veg.

409
00:17:57,789 --> 00:17:59,222
It's all whole grain.

410
00:17:59,257 --> 00:18:00,824
It's all stuff
that's good for you.

411
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,392
Of course they'll
be confused at first.

412
00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:04,294
They'll go, "What?"
That's not real food to them.

413
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:06,096
They think Brussels sprouts
is packaging.

414
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,931
They're... they're looking...

415
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:09,466
"Where's the cakes?
Where's the cakes?"

416
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,934
The cakes are over here.

417
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,570
The cakes are through
a different door,

418
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:17,841
but this door
is human-sized.

419
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,775
So now they'll go,
"There's the cakes."

420
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,677
They're gonna...
"Oh fuck, I can't get in.

421
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:24,680
I can't... I can't get
through the fuckin' door.

422
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:27,315
I can't..."
( Whimpering )

423
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:30,785
And they're starving.
They'll go, "Oh God, I've got...

424
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,953
what's this?
I've gotta eat.

425
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:34,155
What's this? A banana."
( Retching )

426
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:35,723
Right?
And they'll go back.

427
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,758
"Oh no, I still can't..."
Back and have a carrot.

428
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,527
( Retching )

429
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:41,929
They're back and forth for days
and the fat's falling off them.

430
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:44,898
Soon they can slip through
the door and have a cake.

431
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:47,734
They can't get out again.
No, but I mean...

432
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,772
But we've gotta do something.
We've gotta intervene.

433
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:53,607
And people say, "No, it has
nothing to do with you.

434
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:55,542
It's up to them. It's their body.
It's their life."

435
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:59,679
And that's true, but we don't say
that about wearing crash helmets.

436
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:01,913
Or if you've got a heroin
addict in the family,

437
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:04,248
you don't go, "Oh, it's his life.
He loves heroin."

438
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:07,284
You know, you... you go,
"No, you've gotta stop this.

439
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:08,885
Please don't die."

440
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,586
And you get him and you
throw him in a cupboard

441
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:12,221
for three weeks or something.

442
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:13,756
You can't throw a fat person
in a cupboard.

443
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,257
You'd do your back in like me.

444
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,459
But, you know, heroin addicts...
They don't weigh anything.

445
00:19:17,494 --> 00:19:19,761
You can throw them around
willy-nilly, right?

446
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:21,963
In fact, when they're lying there
with a needle hanging out,

447
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:23,097
you just get
the needle and flick,

448
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:26,866
and they just go
into the cupboard like that.

449
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,967
Fat people, you've gotta
lure them in...

450
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,468
a little trail of chocolates.

451
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,970
And they just follow that
anywhere, like that.

452
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,305
But we've got to do something

453
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,074
because a third
of the world are obese

454
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:41,212
and a third of the world
are starving.

455
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:45,048
The fat ones are eating the
skinny ones' food basically.

456
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:47,549
I know most of the skinny
ones are in Africa,

457
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:49,184
so out of sight,
out of mind, I know.

458
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:51,586
But...
No no.

459
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:53,154
I can talk about Africa
like that

460
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:57,124
because I'm from Britain
and we used to own it.

461
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:02,995
We did when we had the empire
and we ruled the world.

462
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:06,764
Before you took over we used to...
We owned Africa.

463
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,698
But then in the '50s and '60s

464
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:11,033
Africa wanted
to be self-ruled.

465
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:12,535
They wanted independence
and they said,

466
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:14,103
"We'd like to run ourselves."
We went, "Fine."

467
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:16,205
So gradually we started giving
Africa back to the Africans.

468
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,207
And by the '70s
it was totally run

469
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:21,177
by the, you know,
Africans themselves.

470
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:25,280
And of course in the '80s,
we get a phone call.

471
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:27,782
"Hello?"
"Hello?"

472
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:31,384
"Who's that?"
"Africa."

473
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:33,452
"What do you want?"

474
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:35,854
"We're starving."

475
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:38,789
"You should've thought of that

476
00:20:38,824 --> 00:20:43,026
before you wanted
independence."

477
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,394
"Well, we didn't know there'd
be a drought, did we?"

478
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:46,929
"Drought?
I'll give you a drought."

479
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:49,264
This is true. When I was a kid...
I was about 10...

480
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:51,900
we had a really long hot summer

481
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,601
and there was a hosepipe ban.

482
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:55,536
You couldn't water
your flowers.

483
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,670
We've all suffered.

484
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,375
So...
That's true actually.

485
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:05,676
One long hot summer,
and the water ran out.

486
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,645
We didn't know what to do.
We thought, "What could we do?"

487
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,213
And there was people
coming round your house,

488
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,080
trying to tell you
how to conserve water.

489
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:13,414
They were saying, "When you brush your
teeth, don't let the tap just run.

490
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:15,248
Put a little glass down."
And they came round.

491
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:16,750
They were putting house bricks

492
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:18,418
in the cistern of the toilet
to save water.

493
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:21,455
And there was public information
films on the television.

494
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,857
There was one advert...
It was like an animation

495
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,725
and it was, like,
a couple in the bath,

496
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,494
and it said, "Conserve water:

497
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:30,729
Take a bath
with a friend."

498
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:33,631
Which I did.

499
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,100
I say a friend; He was more
a friend of my granddad's.

500
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:38,068
But...
No.

501
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,974
£10 is a lot to a kid
in England.

502
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:47,142
What?

503
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:51,410
He taught me a lot.
He taught me a lot...

504
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:53,278
Stuff like, "You don't
wash it like that.

505
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,412
Give it here."

506
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,017
No, he was a sweet old man.

507
00:22:01,052 --> 00:22:02,585
I used to call him
granddad Charlie.

508
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,587
He wasn't my real granddad.
He was just an old bloke

509
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,155
who lived across the road
who used to come round

510
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:08,122
whenever he saw
my parents go out.

511
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:10,490
And he'd come round...
"Mom and dad out?" "Yeah?"

512
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:12,491
"All right, do you wanna see
a magic trick?" "Yeah."

513
00:22:12,526 --> 00:22:16,094
He'd draw the curtains and
he'd make me close my eyes,

514
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,162
and he'd sit down and he'd put a
top hat on his lap like that.

515
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:20,930
A magic hat, right?

516
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,732
And he'd go, "Close your eyes
and feel the magic rabbit."

517
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:26,101
I used to go up
and I used to...

518
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:27,935
I used to go in.
I used to feel the little...

519
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,269
A weird little thing it was.

520
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:31,703
Didn't have any fur or ears.

521
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:33,738
And it used to go...

522
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:35,406
And it was scared stiff,
it was.

523
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,874
It was terrified.

524
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:39,741
And he'd make me
stroke it for...

525
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,509
And I stroked it so fast once

526
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:44,210
that it was sick all down my...

527
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:49,881
Shut up. Shut up.
Fuck off.

528
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:52,516
Oh dear, oh.

529
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:55,319
Where was oh yeah, famine.

530
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:59,022
Famine is a problem,

531
00:22:59,057 --> 00:23:01,058
which brings me
to this next fad

532
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:02,526
that we need to stamp out.

533
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,628
This happened
Christmas before last,

534
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:07,731
exchanging gifts with old
friends, good friends,

535
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:10,367
quite well-off friends
if I'm being honest.

536
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:13,268
I got them a coffee-making
machine from Harrods.

537
00:23:13,303 --> 00:23:15,436
Top of the range.
They loved it.

538
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,504
They gave me my present.
It was just an envelope.

539
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:19,773
I thought, "Ih, what's this?
Vouchers?"

540
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:22,075
Opened it up.
It wasn't vouchers.

541
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,577
It was just a card with
a picture of a goat on it.

542
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,078
And I said,
"What's this?"

543
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,846
They went, "Oh, our gift to you

544
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:30,982
is we gave a goat
to an African family."

545
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:32,950
"What?"

546
00:23:35,552 --> 00:23:37,019
I'm looking
at the coffee machine,

547
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:39,586
thinking, "Is it too late
to take that back?"

548
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:44,089
"And what is..."
"Oh, we gave a goat to an African family."

549
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:46,825
"Did you? Oh."

550
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,161
So I've got fuck all then
basically.

551
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:55,131
Mean, I don't even know
this African family.

552
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:56,699
Why would I give them a goat?

553
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:59,334
It doesn't make...
This serves no purpose at all.

554
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,036
This is no good for anyone.

555
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,838
They're 50 quid down.
I've got nothing.

556
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:06,641
The African family's going,
"Not another mouth to feed."

557
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:08,576
Right?

558
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,745
The goat is going,
"Where the fuck am I?

559
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:16,415
This... what the f...
This is shit.

560
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:19,117
A week ago I was gamboling
round the Cotswolds.

561
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:22,453
There was grass and tourists
with nuts and...

562
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:25,457
This is a fucking dust bowl."

563
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:28,060
There's no way that goat
wanted to go to Africa.

564
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:30,862
It was basically...
It was kidnapped. It was abducted.

565
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:33,165
It was put in a sack and
bundled on a boat to Africa

566
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,133
like "Roots" in reverse.

567
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:37,436
There was no...
There was no way.

568
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,105
They went, "Do you want
to go to Africa?"

569
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:40,673
It went, "Definitely not.
No no."

570
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,641
"Oh, come on.
Why don't you wanna go to Africa?"

571
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:45,211
"Um, lions."

572
00:24:46,713 --> 00:24:48,580
"Come on.
Why don't you wanna go to Africa?"

573
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:51,248
"Um, AIDS."

574
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,982
"Well, that shouldn't
affect you."

575
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:55,250
"It shouldn't."

576
00:24:57,385 --> 00:25:00,287
So just be careful
with that charity shit,

577
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:01,655
particularly at Christmas.

578
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:02,922
That's when they get you.

579
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:05,057
They give you a guilt trip
at Christmas.

580
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:08,105
All the adverts of a charity
at Christmas.

581
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:09,605
You're sitting at home,
aren't you,

582
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:10,874
having your Christmas lunch...

583
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:12,476
loads of food, too much food.

584
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,445
Probably gonna throw
a lot of it away, right?

585
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,580
And things like this
come on the telly.

586
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:18,781
This runs every Christmas
day in England.

587
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:21,783
It goes, "Is there
an old lady near you,

588
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:23,985
cold and lonely
this Christmas?"

589
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,654
Yeah.
I fuckin' hate her.

590
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,325
Nosy bitch winds me up
all year round, okay?

591
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,228
I can't wait
for the cold weather.

592
00:25:34,262 --> 00:25:35,729
There's no old lady near me.

593
00:25:35,763 --> 00:25:37,397
She died last year
of hypothermia.

594
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:40,267
So result, yeah.
Brilliant.

595
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:45,004
The other big one is "A dog is for
life, not just for Christmas."

596
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,373
I'm right behind that.
I'm really into animal welfare.

597
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,475
And that's obviously aimed
at parents whose kids go,

598
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,944
"Can I have a puppy?
Can I have a puppy?"

599
00:25:50,978 --> 00:25:52,812
And they go, "No."
"Can I have a puppy? Can I..."

600
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:54,681
And they get them a puppy
to shut them up, right?

601
00:25:54,715 --> 00:25:56,615
And the kid likes it when it's cute.
It grows up.

602
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,583
The kid gets other interests,
gets bored with the dog.

603
00:25:58,618 --> 00:25:59,884
They lumber the parents
with it.

604
00:25:59,918 --> 00:26:01,885
The parents get bored with it.
They abandon it.

605
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,355
11,000 pets were abandoned in England
last year, which is terrible.

606
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,690
And I think, you know,
kids should have pets.

607
00:26:07,724 --> 00:26:09,425
I think it teaches them
life lessons.

608
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:11,526
I haven't got kids, but I've got
loads of nieces and nephews.

609
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:13,028
And they've got kids
of their own now.

610
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:15,364
I want to be a cool uncle
and give them what they want,

611
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:16,865
but I want to be
a responsible one too

612
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,367
and not add
to the stray problem.

613
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:20,069
But I think I've solved
the dilemma.

614
00:26:20,103 --> 00:26:21,637
Here's a tip.
This is what I do, anyway.

615
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:23,105
You've gotta wait
till Christmas eve.

616
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:25,774
And always go to an animal
rescue center, not a breeder.

617
00:26:25,808 --> 00:26:28,276
I go along to an animal
rescue center Christmas eve,

618
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:31,113
and I go to
the veterinary part.

619
00:26:31,147 --> 00:26:34,116
They've usually got, like,
a runt who's been born

620
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,351
sort of disabled
with no quality of life,

621
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:38,786
and they're just putting that
out of its misery.

622
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:41,589
And I go, "No, don't kill that one.

623
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:43,558
I'll take that one."

624
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:46,628
And they go, "It's only
gonna live a day."

625
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:51,364
Perfect. Perfect.

626
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:53,365
So... so...
and I run home.

627
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:54,866
I'm going, "Don't die yet.

628
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,367
Don't die yet.
Hold on."

629
00:26:56,402 --> 00:26:59,170
A little bit of Starbucks.
A little bit of Starbucks.

630
00:27:00,605 --> 00:27:02,839
And I rush in. I call my niece.
She comes running.

631
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:04,508
"Uncle Ricky!"
"Got you a puppy."

632
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:05,675
"Uncle Ricky,
you got me a puppy!"

633
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,310
"Yeah, your best uncle
got you a puppy.

634
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:09,078
Yeah. Go on,
play with it quick.

635
00:27:09,112 --> 00:27:11,080
Go on, play with it."

636
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:14,450
She takes it to bed with her Christmas
eve and she sleeps with it.

637
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:16,018
She wakes up Christmas day,

638
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,519
it's dead, cold, stiff, gone.

639
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,520
So result.
Not a problem.

640
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,489
And they always come down
the next day, they go,

641
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:23,624
"Oh, my puppy's dead.
My puppy's dead."

642
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:25,593
They go, "Oh, what?
The puppy your uncle got you?

643
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:27,861
He did his bit, and whatever happened
after that isn't his problem."

644
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,129
They go, "Yeah."

645
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:31,031
And I go, "Maybe you rolled
over it in the night."

646
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:34,667
"Oh, did I?
Oh no! Oh no!"

647
00:27:35,315 --> 00:27:37,382
And then they start
"I killed my puppy."

648
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:38,419
"I killed my puppy."

649
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:40,807
And they go,
"No, you didn't kill your puppy."

650
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:44,377
Jesus killed your puppy

651
00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:47,313
on his birthday

652
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:48,814
'cause you didn't spend enough

653
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:51,016
on your uncle's
Christmas present."

654
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:54,019
They usually buck
their ideas up the next year.

655
00:27:54,054 --> 00:27:55,821
The other big campaign
at Christmas:

656
00:27:55,856 --> 00:27:57,690
Don't drink and drive.

657
00:27:57,725 --> 00:27:59,158
Right behind that as well.

658
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:01,160
A lot more stigma attached
to that these days.

659
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:03,696
When I was growing up, it was whether
you got away with it or not.

660
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,265
But people now know
it's sort of... It wrecks lives.

661
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:09,368
I'd be getting in the car when I
was a kid with grown-ups, family.

662
00:28:09,402 --> 00:28:12,070
I'd be going, "No, you can't drive.
You had too much to drink."

663
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:14,272
And they go, "It's all right.
I won't get caught."

664
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:16,107
But now people know
that's wrong.

665
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:17,942
I've done it once
and I'm not proud of it.

666
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:19,943
I'm fucking ashamed of it.
That was Christmas.

667
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:21,478
I wasn't drunk,
but I was over the limit.

668
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:23,613
I took the car out
and I knew I shouldn't.

669
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:25,580
I knew I shouldn't be driving.

670
00:28:25,615 --> 00:28:28,682
But I learned my lesson, because
I nearly killed an old woman.

671
00:28:28,716 --> 00:28:30,250
No, in the end
I didn't kill her.

672
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:32,419
In the end I just raped her.

673
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:40,691
But as I say,
nothing came of it.

674
00:28:40,726 --> 00:28:42,960
Luckily for me,
a thousand-to-one shot,

675
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:44,461
she had Alzheimer's.

676
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:49,098
So not a credible witness.

677
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:53,170
Spiders... Oh, spiders.

678
00:28:53,204 --> 00:28:54,671
They're always ready,
aren't they?

679
00:28:54,706 --> 00:28:56,006
Aren't they always ready for...

680
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,574
They're always ready
for action, a spider.

681
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:00,342
It's always completely fucking
ready for action like that.

682
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:02,109
Always ready
for action, always.

683
00:29:02,144 --> 00:29:03,812
I mean, some animals
are sometimes ready.

684
00:29:03,846 --> 00:29:05,347
You startle a cat
and it'll go...

685
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:06,883
( Gasps )
For a few seconds.

686
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:08,385
Then it goes back to chill.

687
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,953
Most of the time a cat is just
laying on the floor, isn't it?

688
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:13,456
Just on its side,
all four limbs

689
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,457
just stretched out
in one direction.

690
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,759
You will never see
a spider like that.

691
00:29:17,793 --> 00:29:21,195
You will never see a spider
just lying on the carpet,

692
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:23,163
its head down
and all eight legs

693
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:24,731
just stretched out like that.

694
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:27,400
They're always... Ugh.
They're always ready, okay?

695
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:29,502
And they're always ready
in every direction

696
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:33,139
like the fucking "Matrix,"
like that.

697
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:35,241
They don't have to turn.
They've got 10 eyes...

698
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,577
eight legs and 10 eyes.
It's over the top.

699
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,578
They're even ready when you
don't think they're ready.

700
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,080
You can see an empty web
and you go,

701
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,581
"That spider's
not ready."

702
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,149
"No? Touch the web."
"What?"

703
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:47,518
"Touch the web."
And it's there, like that.

704
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,621
I fucking hate them.

705
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:54,258
37,000 different species
of spider.

706
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,861
37,000 different
species of spider.

707
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:00,463
I mean, millions and billions
of individuals

708
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,931
in each species.

709
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,000
And that's just one class,
arachnid,

710
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:05,868
of one phylum, arthropoda.

711
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:08,938
There could be five million
species of animal

712
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:10,705
alive now on the earth.

713
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,373
Best guess, okay?

714
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:15,275
And that's 1%
of all animal species

715
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,910
that have ever existed.

716
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:18,978
99% of all animal species

717
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:20,813
that ever existed
are now extinct,

718
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:25,316
and that remaining 1%
is five million strong.

719
00:30:25,351 --> 00:30:28,252
Take one of those species...
termites.

720
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:32,722
If we were to weigh
every termite alive now,

721
00:30:32,756 --> 00:30:34,924
it would be 10 times
the tonnage

722
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,426
of every human being on earth.

723
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,427
And it's statistics like that
that make me think

724
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,263
that this book
isn't totally accurate.

725
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:55,344
It's the book of Noah,

726
00:30:55,378 --> 00:30:57,679
the children's edition.

727
00:30:57,712 --> 00:30:59,112
I actually got this
awarded to me

728
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:00,779
when I used to go
to Sunday school every week.

729
00:31:00,814 --> 00:31:03,648
I believed in all this
till I was eight.

730
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:08,216
"St. Agnes Sunday School.

731
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,750
Presented to:
Rikki Gervais..."

732
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,186
<i>R-i-k-k-i.</i>

733
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,388
Like a fucking mongoose, right?

734
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:21,127
"...For regular
attendance."

735
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:24,297
Not even for being good at
anything; Just for turning up.

736
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:27,099
"He's always here. Give him a prize.
He'll be back."

737
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:29,734
"Thank you.
Thank you."

738
00:31:31,404 --> 00:31:33,972
Let's have a look
at the evidence.

739
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:36,807
"Long long ago, when God
first made the earth..."

740
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,308
I'll let both those points go.

741
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:40,743
We haven't got time.
Right.

742
00:31:40,778 --> 00:31:42,645
"Long long ago" by the way,

743
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:44,747
according to the Bible,
is 5,000 years.

744
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:46,249
According to the old testament,

745
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:49,918
the earth is no older
than 5,000 years old, okay?

746
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:52,554
It's actually
4.6 billion years old.

747
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:54,989
Let's pop that in, pop that in.

748
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:57,124
"4.6 billion years ago,

749
00:31:57,158 --> 00:31:59,892
when God first made
the earth and sky..."

750
00:31:59,926 --> 00:32:01,527
All right, don't bring it up.

751
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:03,361
It comes as a package
really, doesn't it?

752
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:05,796
I mean... Do you know
what I mean?

753
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:08,198
The sky was never
an optional extra.

754
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:10,267
It's like, "Made you a planet."
"I can't breathe."

755
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:11,768
"Would you like
an atmosphere?"

756
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:13,136
"Of course
I fuckin' would."

757
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,738
So, well done, but...

758
00:32:17,507 --> 00:32:19,975
"Everything was peaceful,
everything beautiful.

759
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:21,943
God made human beings too,

760
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:23,845
and he wanted them
to be good like himself."

761
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:26,614
Arrogant, right?

762
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:29,050
"But very soon,
they wanted their own way.

763
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:30,718
They would not listen to God.

764
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:32,653
They became wicked
and did wicked things."

765
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:35,855
Look at them doing
wicked things there.

766
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,157
<i>You don't get</i> <i>much more
wicked</i> <i>than that, do you?</i>

767
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:40,325
"Fuck... Oh, fuck off, wicked!"

768
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,762
Whee.
"Fuck off, wicked!"

769
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,098
Whee.
"Ah!"

770
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,833
God just looking on.
"Oh, carry on.

771
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,534
See what happens.
See what happens.

772
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,937
Oh, see what happens, yeah.
Oh, see what happens."

773
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,707
The bloke there running off
with a big bag of money.

774
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,409
<i>Don't put it in a bank,</i>
<i>you cunt.</i>

775
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:02,045
( Groans )
Right.

776
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,848
"God looked at them
and said to himself,

777
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,783
'they are so wicked,
I will have to

778
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,552
wipe them off
the face of the earth.'"

779
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:12,122
really? Really?

780
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,657
Straight to genocide?

781
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:19,294
What happened to one verbal
and two written warnings?

782
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:21,563
Straight...

783
00:33:21,597 --> 00:33:25,833
Straight to the annihilation
of the entire human race

784
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:27,667
because
a fatty-yellow-trousers

785
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,903
picked someone's nose?

786
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:31,605
Really?

787
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:33,773
Fuck.

788
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:38,176
Anger management, man.
Just calm the fuck down.

789
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,579
Let's... just chill.

790
00:33:40,613 --> 00:33:43,949
Let's talk about this.

791
00:33:43,983 --> 00:33:46,918
Wow!

792
00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:49,287
I read that
to Karl Pilkington, right?

793
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:52,689
- Who is... Yes.
- ( Audience cheering )

794
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:54,823
Yes.

795
00:33:54,857 --> 00:33:58,159
Head like a fuckin' orange,
I know, yeah.

796
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:00,094
I read that bit to him.

797
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:02,563
"They are so wicked, I will have to
wipe them off the face of the earth."

798
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:06,165
And Karl said,
"He sounds gay."

799
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:08,700
I said, "What...
what do you mean?"

800
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:11,870
He went, "Some gays
are a bit like that."

801
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:13,971
He thought God was, like,
having a hissy fit.

802
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:16,540
Like he's going, "No, they
treat me like a bastard,

803
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:18,041
I'm gonna treat them
like a bast...

804
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:19,709
I'm gonna show them.
I'm gonna wipe 'em out."

805
00:34:19,744 --> 00:34:23,313
I said, "Karl,
God is not gay, okay?

806
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:25,715
Read the Bible.
He hates them."

807
00:34:30,787 --> 00:34:33,756
"They are so wicked, I will have to
wipe them off e face of the earth,

808
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,827
and every living thing
with them."

809
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:39,996
What's the squid ever done?

810
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,731
Real... God has gone mad.
What?

811
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:47,533
But he's not gay.
God is not gay.

812
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:49,701
"But there was one man
who was still very good.

813
00:34:49,736 --> 00:34:52,203
His name was Noah.
He was a friend of God."

814
00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:55,373
Just a friend,
so don't... No.

815
00:34:57,076 --> 00:34:58,710
Just a friend...

816
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:02,762
A friend with
big hooped earrings.

817
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:16,064
Rouge.

818
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:20,667
What... what's he doing...
He lives in a cave.

819
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,435
What's he doing with this?

820
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,572
"What... what are
you doing?"

821
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:27,774
"Seeing God.

822
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:34,913
You never know.
You never know."

823
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:38,349
Handlebar mustache.

824
00:35:40,186 --> 00:35:42,254
Holding God's hand,

825
00:35:42,288 --> 00:35:45,323
<i>who's wearing a blouse.</i>

826
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:52,196
God is not gay.

827
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:57,600
"God said to Noah,

828
00:35:57,634 --> 00:36:00,768
'I am so angry
with men...'"

829
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:08,573
"You mean men and women?"

830
00:36:08,607 --> 00:36:11,341
"Whatever.

831
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:14,008
Whatever."

832
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:16,143
"'I am so angry with men

833
00:36:16,177 --> 00:36:18,644
that I have made my mind up
to destroy them all.

834
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,481
I have stretched my bow in the sky.
It is a rainbow.'"

835
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:24,651
that's got to be the world's
first pun, hasn't it?

836
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,955
"'It will make so much rain
pour down on earth

837
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:32,291
that everything will be
drowned, but not you.

838
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,526
I want you to build an ark.

839
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:38,161
It must be like a big boat with
three decks and a roof over it.'"

840
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,964
"Yeah, I know how to build a boat, mate.
Oh, cheers."

841
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,731
"'And you will make a door
in the side of it.'"

842
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:46,300
"Do you think I'm a complete idiot?
I know..."

843
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:48,869
"Noah did exactly
what God told him.

844
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:50,404
And then God said
to Noah..."

845
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:52,539
Now...
Okay okay.

846
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:54,575
Now this is aimed
at children, admittedly,

847
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:57,775
but it's taken from the old
testament story in the Bible.

848
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:59,709
But I don't think
the author of this book

849
00:36:59,743 --> 00:37:01,910
is a zoologist.

850
00:37:01,944 --> 00:37:04,745
As we've said, there could be
five million species of animal.

851
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:06,313
I don't think
he knows them all,

852
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:09,648
the way he backs out very quickly
in this next sentence, okay?

853
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:12,718
"'I want you to take two of every kind
of animal with you into the ark...

854
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:16,621
Two lions, two tigers,
two elephants and so on.'"

855
00:37:21,627 --> 00:37:26,229
"What?
I've got lions, tigers, elephants... so on.

856
00:37:28,632 --> 00:37:31,299
On you go."

857
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,333
"'Look after them well
and keep them alive.'

858
00:37:33,368 --> 00:37:34,835
and Noah did
what God said."

859
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:36,603
Now I want you to study
that scenario.

860
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:39,672
Okay, so God is angry
with mankind.

861
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:41,340
He's fed up with them.
They're wicked.

862
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:43,508
He's gonna wipe them out
and just start again

863
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,243
with Noah and his wife.

864
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,513
He's angry with the animals
too for some reason.

865
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:52,148
I don't... So he's gonna
start again

866
00:37:52,183 --> 00:37:53,917
with just two of each species.

867
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:55,419
He calls a flood.
They build an ark.

868
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:57,420
Noah goes, "Right,
two of each species.

869
00:37:57,455 --> 00:37:59,823
Two, just two.
Quick, first two."

870
00:37:59,858 --> 00:38:02,192
( Trumpets )
There's a stampede.

871
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:04,294
( Trumpets )
Two elephants.

872
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:07,664
( Trumpets )
Two toucans...Just walking.

873
00:38:15,371 --> 00:38:17,739
There's no rush.

874
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:24,511
Just strollin', baby.

875
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,748
<i>I think this one</i>
<i>is a bit more concerned</i>

876
00:38:29,783 --> 00:38:32,317
<i>than this one.</i>

877
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:37,421
<i>This one's probably going,</i>
<i>"Should we fly?"</i>

878
00:38:40,457 --> 00:38:42,525
<i>"Nah."</i>

879
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:47,295
<i>"No?"</i>

880
00:38:49,464 --> 00:38:51,498
<i>"Nah."</i>

881
00:38:52,966 --> 00:38:55,100
I could do this all night.

882
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,471
<i>"No?"</i>

883
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:09,343
"Nah."

884
00:39:12,613 --> 00:39:14,447
<i>( Snorts )</i>

885
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:16,549
<i>"Sure?"</i>

886
00:39:18,285 --> 00:39:20,586
<i>"Yeah."</i>

887
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,589
"I mean, we've...
Well, we've got wings."

888
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,692
<i>( Laughing )</i>
<i>"We've got feet as well."</i>

889
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:34,465
<i>"Why don't you wanna</i>
<i>push in?"</i>

890
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:37,268
<i>"That elephant's</i>
<i>looking at me funny."</i>

891
00:39:45,943 --> 00:39:49,846
"Yeah, I... I fuckin' am.

892
00:39:52,383 --> 00:39:54,884
If you try and push in,
I'm gonna stamp on you,

893
00:39:54,918 --> 00:39:58,822
you... you big-nosed twat."

894
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:02,760
<i>"Hold on. Who are you</i>
<i>calling big-nosed?"</i>

895
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:05,729
<i>"What do you mean?"</i>

896
00:40:05,764 --> 00:40:08,598
<i>"No, it's just pot</i>
<i>calling kettle black."</i>

897
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:11,167
<i>"What the fuck does that mean?</i>
<i>What does 'pot... '"</i>

898
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:13,102
<i>"Well, you know, if a pot's...</i>
<i>Oh, forget it."</i>

899
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:16,304
<i>"I can't forget it.</i>
<i>I'm a fucking elephant."</i>

900
00:40:16,338 --> 00:40:18,438
( Laughing )

901
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:23,575
Oh.

902
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:26,710
Two camels, two lions,
two ostriches,

903
00:40:26,744 --> 00:40:29,745
two leopards,
two tigers, two zebra.

904
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,981
Ah, here's the crux
of my point.

905
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:36,485
<i>Just one species</i> <i>on the ark
at the moment:</i> <i>The giraffes.</i>

906
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,121
<i>They got there first...</i>
<i>Longer legs, okay?</i>

907
00:40:39,155 --> 00:40:42,725
Five million more species
to get on there.

908
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:46,396
So two of it... So two animals on the ark
at the moment.

909
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,131
10 million more animals to go.

910
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:51,132
10 million more of those, ok?

911
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:53,167
Million as far as...

912
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,737
10 million of them
to get on there.

913
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:58,741
Just two on there
at the moment.

914
00:40:58,776 --> 00:41:01,578
<i>Look how much room</i>
<i>they're already taking up.</i>

915
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:09,287
It's at a third capacity.

916
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:11,056
What's it going
to be like on there

917
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,492
when these two
fat cunts get on?

918
00:41:16,162 --> 00:41:18,197
Man: <i>Yeah!</i>

919
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:19,999
"Then God bent the bow
of his anger

920
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:21,567
d the rain came flooding down,

921
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:23,402
covering the earth with water.

922
00:41:23,436 --> 00:41:25,171
It rained for 40 days
and nights.

923
00:41:25,205 --> 00:41:27,073
The flood water rose
higher and higher,

924
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:29,609
until it covered the tops
of the highest mountains.

925
00:41:29,643 --> 00:41:32,245
Every living thing
was drowned except Noah

926
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:34,213
and the animals
in the ark."

927
00:41:34,247 --> 00:41:36,315
And the fish.

928
00:41:37,717 --> 00:41:39,651
They were fine, weren't they?
They were fine.

929
00:41:39,685 --> 00:41:41,386
They were loving it.
They were better off.

930
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,187
In fact, all the sea creatures.

931
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:44,488
I mean, mountains underwater...

932
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:46,623
Their domain had increased,
like, tenfold.

933
00:41:46,657 --> 00:41:48,024
It's so much more interesting.

934
00:41:48,058 --> 00:41:51,060
You've got crabs going,
"I'm on a fucking mountain!

935
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:54,430
This is amazing!
I never want this flood to...

936
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:56,197
I've never been
up here before."

937
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:57,831
I think of that
when you see on the news,

938
00:41:57,865 --> 00:42:00,465
like if there's a little
village in Gloucester

939
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,166
flooded or something.
It's really sad.

940
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,533
You see people...
They've lost their homes

941
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:05,468
and they're in dinghies,
carrying their pets.

942
00:42:05,502 --> 00:42:07,702
And you see a little row
of antique shops

943
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:09,170
completely underwater.

944
00:42:09,204 --> 00:42:11,505
And I think of a fish
just looking in the window

945
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:13,906
of the antique shop
for the first time.

946
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,511
"So that's a chaise longue."

947
00:42:25,115 --> 00:42:27,849
"For 150 days the earth
was covered with water.

948
00:42:27,884 --> 00:42:30,151
Then Noah opened the window
of the ark and looked out.

949
00:42:30,186 --> 00:42:32,754
The water seemed to be going
down, but how could he be sure?"

950
00:42:32,788 --> 00:42:35,055
Well, ask God. You've been chatting
to him all the way through.

951
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,856
Why are we...

952
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:40,026
Why are we getting cryptic
all of a sudden?

953
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,494
"He sent a raven out,
but it soon came flying back.

954
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:44,262
It could find
nowhere to settle.

955
00:42:44,297 --> 00:42:46,698
Noah waited another week
and he sent out a dove."

956
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,333
Why did the raven lose his job?

957
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,237
"But the dove
came back too."

958
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,322
See? The raven wasn't bullshitting.
This is...

959
00:42:57,127 --> 00:42:59,254
"There was still no dry land anywhere...

960
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,677
"But one day
the dove flew out and..."

961
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,379
Why did the dove
get a second go

962
00:43:03,413 --> 00:43:05,314
and not the raven?

963
00:43:05,348 --> 00:43:07,449
Racist.

964
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,887
"But one day the dove flew out

965
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:14,654
and brought back
a green olive branch.

966
00:43:14,689 --> 00:43:16,690
And Noah knew that
God was no longer angry.

967
00:43:16,724 --> 00:43:18,858
Then God told Noah to the
animals out of the ark.

968
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:20,926
'They must once more fill
the Earth with living things.'

969
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:22,928
the first thing Noah did
was to build an altar.

970
00:43:22,962 --> 00:43:25,437
He offered a sacrifice to God
to thank him for saving them.

971
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:27,813
And Noah said "I'll make a pact
of friendship with you."

972
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:30,734
'I will never again send a flood
to destroy the earth.

973
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:32,502
The rainbow,
which I've put in the sky,

974
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:35,971
will no longer be a sign of my
anger, but a sign of peace.

975
00:43:36,005 --> 00:43:38,273
It will be a sign
of my friendship with men... '"

976
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:40,474
That is...

977
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:42,408
That is how it is...

978
00:43:45,978 --> 00:43:47,545
That is how it is used today.

979
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,713
They took it literally.

980
00:43:49,748 --> 00:43:53,417
"'It will be a sign of my friendship
with men, which begins today,

981
00:43:53,451 --> 00:43:55,352
and which my son Jesus
will one day prove

982
00:43:55,386 --> 00:43:56,852
by shedding his blood
for men.'"

983
00:43:56,887 --> 00:43:58,353
"Who?"
"You'll see."

984
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:00,789
There was... there wasn't
a teaser campaign

985
00:44:00,823 --> 00:44:03,659
in the old testament.

986
00:44:03,693 --> 00:44:07,429
Coming soon: The sequel.

987
00:44:07,464 --> 00:44:09,732
"And so when you have
done wrong

988
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:11,468
and you are feeling
very sad about it,

989
00:44:11,502 --> 00:44:13,303
think of the rainbow
and the peace

990
00:44:13,338 --> 00:44:15,106
which God wants to put
into your heart.

991
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,209
He has promised to be your friend.
Promise to be his."

992
00:44:18,243 --> 00:44:21,011
And that's just one of 12
in the dove books series.

993
00:44:21,046 --> 00:44:22,846
<i>I've only got one:</i>
<i>Number nine... "Noah."</i>

994
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:25,282
Although I think my favorite
would be number eight

995
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:28,551
just from the title...
"Jesus and the Cripple."

996
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:31,321
<i>( Cheering, applause )</i>

997
00:44:31,355 --> 00:44:33,490
Thank you.
Cheers.

998
00:44:35,893 --> 00:44:37,994
Oh dear.

999
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:41,063
I...

1000
00:44:44,634 --> 00:44:47,739
I read that whole book to Karl and uh...

1001
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:50,572
He believed it all.
Why wouldn't he? It's written down..

1002
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:53,475
And I said, "Karl, think.

1003
00:44:53,509 --> 00:44:56,009
How could they get 10
million animals on a boat?"

1004
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:57,510
Karl went, "They said
it was a big boat."

1005
00:44:57,544 --> 00:44:59,010
Yeah, they did.
That's true.

1006
00:44:59,044 --> 00:45:03,178
I said, "Put they're all
part of the food chain.

1007
00:45:03,212 --> 00:45:07,080
They would have literally had to
have eaten each other to survive.

1008
00:45:07,114 --> 00:45:09,148
Why didn't the lion
eat the antelope?

1009
00:45:09,182 --> 00:45:10,882
Why didn't the spider
eat the fly?"

1010
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,984
And Karl said, "'Cause in a
crisis you all pull together."

1011
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,487
Amazing.

1012
00:45:19,522 --> 00:45:21,322
I'd love to do a book
of his quotes.

1013
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:22,822
I love books of quotations.

1014
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:24,824
I love just reading them
for... for pleasure.

1015
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:26,425
I've got a few
of these compilations.

1016
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:29,326
And one of my heroes
is Winston Churchill.

1017
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:34,063
When I read "Give us the tools

1018
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:37,166
and we will finish the job,"
I thought, "How inspiring."

1019
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,302
And when I read "Never in
the field of human conflict

1020
00:45:40,336 --> 00:45:42,737
was so much owed
by so many to so few,"

1021
00:45:42,772 --> 00:45:44,472
I thought,
"How patriotic."

1022
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:46,341
And when I read
"It is a good thing

1023
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:49,977
for an uneducated man to read
books of quotations,"

1024
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,048
I thought,
"You cheeky, fat git."

1025
00:45:57,718 --> 00:46:00,153
People always say to me
that Oscar Wilde

1026
00:46:00,154 --> 00:46:01,922
is the greatest genius
that's ever lived.

1027
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:03,724
Let's have a look to me
at the evidence, okay?

1028
00:46:03,758 --> 00:46:05,292
Here's one of his.

1029
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:07,061
"All women become
like their mothers.

1030
00:46:07,096 --> 00:46:08,530
That is their tragedy.

1031
00:46:08,564 --> 00:46:11,233
No man does.
That is his."

1032
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,675
That sounds a bit gay to me.

1033
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:20,544
Don't you think?
I... No, just...

1034
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:22,445
Give him another go.
Here's another one.

1035
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,082
"I couldn't help it.
I can resist everything except temptation."

1036
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,117
That sounds gay as well.
I think...

1037
00:46:29,151 --> 00:46:30,618
I want to start that
with an "Ooh."

1038
00:46:30,652 --> 00:46:32,252
I wanna go,
"Ooh, I couldn't help it."

1039
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:33,954
Do you know what I mean?

1040
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:37,491
And I want to end it with, "I can
resist everything except temptation.

1041
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:40,227
Chance would be a fine thing."
You know?

1042
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:42,730
And when he went through
customs in New York

1043
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:44,765
all those years ago...
And the customs officer,

1044
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:47,267
just doing his job, said,
"Have you anything to declare?"

1045
00:46:47,302 --> 00:46:50,671
Oscar Wilde famously said,
"Nothing but my genius."

1046
00:46:50,705 --> 00:46:52,773
Ooh.

1047
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:54,441
That wasn't witty.
I bet he planned that.

1048
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:56,109
I bet the first time
he went through customs

1049
00:46:56,143 --> 00:46:57,977
in a foreign country it was all
"Yes sir," "No sir."

1050
00:46:58,011 --> 00:46:59,878
"Anything to declare?" "No."
"Thanks. On you go."

1051
00:46:59,912 --> 00:47:01,279
"Oh, I just thought
of something

1052
00:47:01,313 --> 00:47:02,747
fucking brilliant to say.

1053
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:06,584
Oh!
I'm always doing that.

1054
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:08,552
Excuse me, can I go back through...
No? Ugh!"

1055
00:47:08,587 --> 00:47:10,754
He had to wait weeks in those days,
back on the boat to England,

1056
00:47:10,788 --> 00:47:12,322
just thinking,
"If they say that again...

1057
00:47:12,356 --> 00:47:14,091
'Anything to declare?'
'Nothing but my genius.'

1058
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,625
I'll be in a book
of quotations."

1059
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,960
He gets there again
weeks later,

1060
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:19,362
finds the same bloke,
goes up to him.

1061
00:47:19,397 --> 00:47:20,696
The bloke goes,
"On you go."

1062
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:23,232
"Didn't even fucking
ask me that time.

1063
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:25,367
Fuck.

1064
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,870
Excuse me, they didn't
ask me if...

1065
00:47:27,904 --> 00:47:29,371
Random,
fucking random."

1066
00:47:29,405 --> 00:47:30,672
Right?
Back on the boat.

1067
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:31,973
Three weeks later, getting it.

1068
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:34,089
Gets there this time,
finds the same bloke.

1069
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:37,598
Is time he's started looking
shifty so he gets picked out.

1070
00:47:37,718 --> 00:47:42,534
Like that, right? The blok, right?...
"Did you buy anything?"

1071
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:45,284
"That's not the question.

1072
00:47:45,318 --> 00:47:46,918
Say 'Have you anything
to declare?'"

1073
00:47:46,952 --> 00:47:48,652
"Okay. Have you anything
to declare?"

1074
00:47:48,686 --> 00:47:50,920
"Nothing but my genius."
"Whose are the butt plugs?"

1075
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:52,888
"They're mine.
They're mine.

1076
00:47:52,922 --> 00:47:54,556
They're mine."

1077
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,394
Incarcerated in reading jail
for homosexuality.

1078
00:48:00,428 --> 00:48:03,296
We've come a long way
from it being punishable

1079
00:48:03,331 --> 00:48:05,198
to total equality,
as it should be of course.

1080
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:06,899
In England the gay
age of consent is the same

1081
00:48:06,934 --> 00:48:09,268
as heterosexuality now... 16.

1082
00:48:09,302 --> 00:48:11,035
And even gay marriage.

1083
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,938
Although, ironically,
the one place

1084
00:48:12,972 --> 00:48:14,406
that was really
ahead of the game

1085
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,608
fell behind a little at the
last election... California.

1086
00:48:17,642 --> 00:48:19,643
They had a referendum.
They put it to the vote

1087
00:48:19,677 --> 00:48:21,944
and they voted no
to gay marriage.

1088
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:24,346
I mean, California
there's people going,

1089
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,247
"That's why
we moved here."

1090
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,849
I mean, it's a strange
sort of bigotry

1091
00:48:28,883 --> 00:48:30,817
that you can affect
someone else's lifestyle

1092
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,118
that doesn't affect you back.

1093
00:48:32,152 --> 00:48:33,685
It's not like they asked
a bloke once,

1094
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:36,053
said, "Sorry, do you mind
if these two men get married?"

1095
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:38,389
He went, "No. Fine."
"Okay, Jack 'em then."

1096
00:48:38,423 --> 00:48:40,657
"What?
I didn't know that was..."

1097
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:42,458
That doesn't happen, does it?

1098
00:48:42,493 --> 00:48:44,792
That doesn't happen.

1099
00:48:44,827 --> 00:48:46,560
It's also a strange
sort of bigotry

1100
00:48:46,595 --> 00:48:48,528
because these people
that object to that

1101
00:48:48,563 --> 00:48:50,463
were presumably
the same people that said

1102
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:53,599
gay people were immoral
and promiscuous.

1103
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:55,301
But now they don't want them
to be monogamous

1104
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:56,870
and respectful
in the eyes of God.

1105
00:48:56,904 --> 00:48:59,172
And it must be so confusing
to a gay guy in California,

1106
00:48:59,207 --> 00:49:01,175
thinking, "That's the bit
they don't like.

1107
00:49:01,209 --> 00:49:03,977
With all the other shit we get
up to, it's the marriage bit."

1108
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:05,111
They'd be so confused.

1109
00:49:05,146 --> 00:49:06,412
They must go to judges and go,

1110
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:07,947
"Sorry, can I get
the rules straight?"

1111
00:49:07,981 --> 00:49:09,315
"What do you want
to know?"

1112
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,883
"I just didn't know
what we can and can't do."

1113
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:14,319
"Ask away."
"Can I marry a man?" "No."

1114
00:49:14,353 --> 00:49:15,820
"Can I fuck him up the ass

1115
00:49:15,854 --> 00:49:18,622
and give him
a little reach-round?"

1116
00:49:18,657 --> 00:49:20,757
"Please."

1117
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,628
"I...

1118
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,363
Can't marry him, no.

1119
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,531
But I... and a little...

1120
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,233
Can I...

1121
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:38,839
Can... can I pick up
a stranger in the bushes

1122
00:49:38,873 --> 00:49:40,374
and take him home
and jizz on him

1123
00:49:40,408 --> 00:49:43,376
and throw him out in the morning
all crusty and homeless?"

1124
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,178
"Of course you can, yeah."

1125
00:49:45,212 --> 00:49:46,679
"But I couldn't
marry him?"

1126
00:49:46,713 --> 00:49:48,313
"No."
( Retching )

1127
00:49:48,348 --> 00:49:51,249
"No, and don't ask again,
all right?"

1128
00:49:51,284 --> 00:49:54,519
"Can I line up 15 men..."

1129
00:49:54,553 --> 00:49:57,554
I'm just riffing here.

1130
00:49:57,589 --> 00:49:59,689
"Can I line up 15 men

1131
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:03,059
and just jack 'em off
for a laugh?"

1132
00:50:03,094 --> 00:50:05,795
"If you want,
yeah yeah."

1133
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,363
It would be difficult,
wouldn't it?

1134
00:50:07,398 --> 00:50:08,731
Jacking off 15 men at once.

1135
00:50:08,765 --> 00:50:11,032
It'd be like plate spinning,
wouldn't it?

1136
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:12,767
No.
Because you'd have...

1137
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,402
You could only do
two at once really.

1138
00:50:14,436 --> 00:50:16,604
So you'd have these two
ready to blow,

1139
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,239
but then they'd be losing it.

1140
00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:21,208
And you'd go, "Fucking hell.

1141
00:50:21,242 --> 00:50:24,777
Here you go.
Oh, fucking hell.

1142
00:50:24,811 --> 00:50:27,279
All right, all right,
all right."

1143
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:34,152
Ain't it knackering,
jacking off 15 men at once?

1144
00:50:34,186 --> 00:50:36,520
I never thought I'd say that.

1145
00:50:36,555 --> 00:50:39,456
Again. No.

1146
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:45,594
There's these people that say,
"Being gay isn't natural."

1147
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:49,263
Well, it is natural, and
I've got a book to prove it.

1148
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:56,602
Homosexuality occurs
in about the same incidence

1149
00:50:56,636 --> 00:51:00,439
in the animal kingdom
as it does in human society.

1150
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,907
This is a real book.

1151
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:04,608
It's called
"Biological exuberance:

1152
00:51:04,643 --> 00:51:07,511
Animal homosexuality
and natural diversity"

1153
00:51:07,545 --> 00:51:09,913
by Bruce Bagemihl, okay?

1154
00:51:11,215 --> 00:51:12,681
"The evidence is compelling

1155
00:51:12,716 --> 00:51:15,083
and it seems there is
virtually no species

1156
00:51:15,117 --> 00:51:17,551
which does not have
its gay community."

1157
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:20,287
That doesn't mean, like, chimps
on one particular street

1158
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:21,822
wearing leather caps and stuff.

1159
00:51:21,856 --> 00:51:23,490
It just...

1160
00:51:25,326 --> 00:51:28,560
They sort of
spread it out more really.

1161
00:51:28,594 --> 00:51:30,028
This is a real book.

1162
00:51:30,062 --> 00:51:31,729
Can we have
the first slide, please?

1163
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:34,697
Right. Okay?

1164
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:36,632
Right.

1165
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:39,402
This is a real book, okay?

1166
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:44,172
Right?
Absolutely real, okay?

1167
00:51:47,576 --> 00:51:52,647
"Two male stump-tailed macaques
in mutual fellatio."

1168
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:54,549
Mutual...
They're sharing.

1169
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:57,051
They're sharing it round.

1170
00:51:57,085 --> 00:51:59,086
Next slide.

1171
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,121
Okay.

1172
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:03,790
"A male squirrel monkey, right,

1173
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:07,360
performing a genital display
toward another male."

1174
00:52:07,394 --> 00:52:10,329
( Stammering )
I...

1175
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,798
He's just going,
"What do you think of that?"

1176
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:17,069
And this one's going,
"What?"

1177
00:52:18,538 --> 00:52:20,639
"Suck it."

1178
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,575
Look at his little hand.

1179
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:26,545
"Why?"
"Because we're gay."

1180
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,081
"I'm not."
"You fuckin' are."

1181
00:52:29,115 --> 00:52:30,582
Look at the way
he's holding him.

1182
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:33,284
And he's got his leg up
for extra purchase.

1183
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:34,819
He's going, "Get in there.

1184
00:52:34,853 --> 00:52:38,055
Get in there.
Get in there."

1185
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:40,857
Look at him.
( Gibbers )

1186
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,829
Can you imagine face
when I discovered this book?

1187
00:52:45,864 --> 00:52:48,398
Oh my God.
( Giggling )

1188
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,169
Next slide, please.

1189
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:55,304
Ah, okay.

1190
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:01,344
"A female Olympic marmot
mounting another female."

1191
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:04,815
Now I don't know
what is in that

1192
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,817
for either of them...

1193
00:53:06,852 --> 00:53:10,754
Unless the one on top
is wearing a strap-on dildo.

1194
00:53:16,094 --> 00:53:18,328
One more.
One more slide.

1195
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:21,198
Oh, this is a doozy.
Okay.

1196
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:25,035
"Two forms of copulation
between male dolphins:

1197
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:29,005
Genital slit, or anal
penetration, above;

1198
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,142
and below,
blowhole penetration."

1199
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:37,578
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

1200
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:48,455
Basically...

1201
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:54,461
<i>He is fucking him</i>

1202
00:53:54,495 --> 00:53:56,396
<i>in the head!</i>

1203
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,064
It's in the head.

1204
00:53:58,098 --> 00:54:00,666
He's fucking him
in the head, ladies...

1205
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:03,702
I have never seen that
on any wildlife documentary.

1206
00:54:03,736 --> 00:54:07,239
I've never... Why have I never
seen that before?

1207
00:54:08,174 --> 00:54:11,476
<i>Why are they doing that?</i>

1208
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,978
Maybe it's not in the wild.

1209
00:54:13,012 --> 00:54:15,713
Maybe it's in seaworld,
which is like their prison.

1210
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:23,153
And they're going...
they're going,

1211
00:54:23,187 --> 00:54:25,522
"Fuck's sake,
they've put in two males.

1212
00:54:25,556 --> 00:54:27,190
Some people think we're fish.

1213
00:54:27,224 --> 00:54:29,992
We might as well
fucking do it."

1214
00:54:30,026 --> 00:54:33,262
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>look at his face.</i>

1215
00:54:33,296 --> 00:54:35,397
Like that.

1216
00:54:38,268 --> 00:54:40,969
He's going, "Dave."

1217
00:54:41,003 --> 00:54:43,671
<i>"What?"</i>

1218
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:48,776
<i>"Could... could we not do it</i>
<i>up the ass like them?"</i>

1219
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:52,146
<i>"No. It's in the head</i>
<i>or nothing."</i>

1220
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:54,916
<i>( Laughing )</i>

1221
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,717
<i>"D-Dave?"</i>

1222
00:54:56,752 --> 00:55:00,822
<i>"What?! What?!"</i>

1223
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,891
<i>"Dave, Dave,</i>

1224
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:07,028
<i>I love you...</i>

1225
00:55:07,063 --> 00:55:09,264
<i>But I can't</i>
<i>fucking breathe."</i>

1226
00:55:14,003 --> 00:55:16,939
That is a real book.
That is a real book.

1227
00:55:16,973 --> 00:55:19,074
Can we have the...
Look.

1228
00:55:20,977 --> 00:55:24,145
I love the fact that he found,
like, a turkey in drag

1229
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,282
<i>to show how gay</i>

1230
00:55:27,316 --> 00:55:29,483
<i>animals can be.</i>

1231
00:55:29,518 --> 00:55:32,652
The gayest animal in the world.

1232
00:55:34,421 --> 00:55:37,156
I... I hope I haven't
offended anyone

1233
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:40,459
with any of the subject...
No, I do. I do.

1234
00:55:40,493 --> 00:55:42,395
That's not the point.
I don't try and offend.

1235
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:45,331
If I have offended anyone,
and I'm sure I have,

1236
00:55:45,366 --> 00:55:46,966
I don't apologize.

1237
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:49,001
No, I think you shouldn't.

1238
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:51,203
You have to be able to justify
everything you do.

1239
00:55:51,237 --> 00:55:53,238
I always think that a
comedian should take you

1240
00:55:53,272 --> 00:55:54,739
to taboo places
you haven't been before.

1241
00:55:54,774 --> 00:55:56,074
Otherwise you could
do it yourself.

1242
00:55:56,108 --> 00:55:57,542
There's enough
anodyne comedy out there...

1243
00:55:57,576 --> 00:56:00,144
Just doing things, obvious
stuff that, you know,

1244
00:56:00,178 --> 00:56:02,379
doesn't make
any difference at all.

1245
00:56:02,413 --> 00:56:04,280
And there's this
spate of comedians

1246
00:56:04,314 --> 00:56:06,182
saying sorry
when they go too far.

1247
00:56:06,216 --> 00:56:07,749
I just think, you know,
you should...

1248
00:56:07,783 --> 00:56:09,250
They go, "Oh, sorry,
I didn't mean it."

1249
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:11,051
Well, you should've
known better then.

1250
00:56:11,086 --> 00:56:13,320
There's also a witch-hunt at
the moment with people saying,

1251
00:56:13,354 --> 00:56:15,688
"Is there anything you shouldn't make
a joke about?"

1252
00:56:15,722 --> 00:56:18,123
No, there's nothing
you shouldn't joke about.

1253
00:56:18,157 --> 00:56:20,258
It depends what the joke is.

1254
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:23,394
( Cheering, applause )

1255
00:56:25,096 --> 00:56:27,597
Comedy comes from
a good or a bad place,

1256
00:56:27,632 --> 00:56:30,033
and it's for you to decide
what that is.

1257
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:33,736
I think that there's a big
debate about sick jokes.

1258
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:35,837
"Comedians doing
sick jokes."

1259
00:56:35,871 --> 00:56:37,972
Now the thing
about sick jokes...

1260
00:56:38,006 --> 00:56:41,308
When we tell a sick joke,
it's with the express understanding

1261
00:56:41,342 --> 00:56:43,810
that neither party
is really like that.

1262
00:56:43,844 --> 00:56:46,078
I wouldn't tell a sick joke
to a known pedophile.

1263
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:47,579
I wouldn't go, "Here, mate,

1264
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,681
you're gonna fuckin' love this
more than anyone, son."

1265
00:56:49,715 --> 00:56:51,816
Do you know what I...

1266
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,286
I've never been in trouble
for anything I've said

1267
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,187
in my professional career
because I refuse to apologize.

1268
00:56:57,221 --> 00:56:58,454
What can they do to you,
you know?

1269
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:00,623
Growing up, you try...
try things out

1270
00:57:00,657 --> 00:57:02,791
and you get taken
the wrong way a little bit.

1271
00:57:02,825 --> 00:57:05,759
Not like the dolphin.
I mean, you know, not...

1272
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:11,697
When I was about 23, 24,

1273
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:14,399
me and my girlfriend met up
with this other couple.

1274
00:57:14,433 --> 00:57:16,700
They had moved down from the
north of England to London.

1275
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:18,201
They used to come
in the place I used to work

1276
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:19,535
and we had a couple of
drinks with them.

1277
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:22,070
They were cool people
and they were fun.

1278
00:57:22,104 --> 00:57:24,071
After we had met them
a couple of times,

1279
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:26,106
they invited us to a party
at their house.

1280
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:27,340
And we went along.

1281
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:28,541
One, it was a dinner party,

1282
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,109
which they hadn't
warned us about.

1283
00:57:30,143 --> 00:57:32,611
But two, it was
for their family

1284
00:57:32,645 --> 00:57:35,180
that had come down from the north
to see how they were getting on.

1285
00:57:35,214 --> 00:57:37,815
And it was both of their
parents and grandparents

1286
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:41,851
and great uncles...
average age about 85, right?

1287
00:57:41,885 --> 00:57:43,485
And I think we were
an afterthought.

1288
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:45,719
They thought, "Oh God, we don't
know anyone our own age.

1289
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,821
Oh, that Ricky and Jane."
So we went along.

1290
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:49,322
And we were still
getting to know them,

1291
00:57:49,356 --> 00:57:50,656
so we just spoke to them
all night.

1292
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,491
We didn't really mingle
with the older people.

1293
00:57:53,525 --> 00:57:58,293
And as I say,
we use comedy as a sword

1294
00:57:58,328 --> 00:58:00,828
and a shield and a medicine,

1295
00:58:00,863 --> 00:58:03,164
but usually
as a getting to know you.

1296
00:58:03,198 --> 00:58:04,698
We use comedy to break the ice.

1297
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:07,533
Are you like-minded?
What can you take? What do you like?

1298
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:09,368
And I've always pushed
the boundaries a little bit

1299
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,903
to try and make people laugh at
things they didn't think they could.

1300
00:58:11,937 --> 00:58:16,506
But, you know... But then everything
turns out okay, I suppose.

1301
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:21,177
I started off lightly.
I told this joke.

1302
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:24,045
Why did the little girl
fall off the swing?

1303
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,647
'Cause she had no arms.

1304
00:58:29,183 --> 00:58:31,416
Yeah, sweet.

1305
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:34,918
And they laughed...
A little bit louder than that.

1306
00:58:34,952 --> 00:58:37,253
There was only two of them,
so thanks.

1307
00:58:37,288 --> 00:58:39,422
No. So I thought,
"Okay, they get it."

1308
00:58:39,456 --> 00:58:40,923
And so you up the ante
a little bit.

1309
00:58:40,957 --> 00:58:43,425
You push...
and I told this joke.

1310
00:58:43,459 --> 00:58:45,592
Ooh, I need a drink.

1311
00:58:46,994 --> 00:58:48,694
Start the car, seriously.

1312
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:50,429
Right.

1313
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:55,999
I told this joke.

1314
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:00,270
Made sure the old people
couldn't hear, like that.

1315
00:59:00,304 --> 00:59:02,737
I went, "Okay, a father
is sitting at home,

1316
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,272
just reading the newspaper.

1317
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:07,373
His little girl comes running in.
She's only six.

1318
00:59:07,407 --> 00:59:09,273
'Hello, darling.'
'Hello, daddy.'

1319
00:59:09,308 --> 00:59:10,807
'You've been playing?'
'Yeah.'

1320
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:13,041
'In the park?'
'Yeah.'

1321
00:59:13,075 --> 00:59:15,875
'With your friends?'
'Well, until the man came along.'

1322
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,643
'Till the man
came along?'

1323
00:59:17,677 --> 00:59:20,278
'Yeah, a man came along and he asked
my friends to leave,

1324
00:59:20,312 --> 00:59:21,946
so it was just
me and him.'

1325
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,247
'Darling, come...
Come over.

1326
00:59:24,281 --> 00:59:26,648
Whatever happened,
none of it was your fault.

1327
00:59:26,683 --> 00:59:28,450
Okay, darling?
None of it was your fault.

1328
00:59:28,484 --> 00:59:31,085
But tell daddy every detail.
What happened?'

1329
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,020
'Um, he took me behind a tree

1330
00:59:33,054 --> 00:59:34,521
so no one could see
what we were doing.'

1331
00:59:34,554 --> 00:59:36,588
'Oh God, darling.
And then what happened?'

1332
00:59:36,622 --> 00:59:38,389
'um, he took
my dress off.'

1333
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:40,323
'Oh God. What happened next?
What happened?'

1334
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:42,624
'Um, he took
his thing out.'

1335
00:59:42,658 --> 00:59:44,191
'Oh God, darling.
And then what happened?'

1336
00:59:44,226 --> 00:59:45,459
'Nothing.
That was it.'

1337
00:59:45,493 --> 00:59:48,127
'Oh well,
make something up.'"

1338
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,172
- Cheers.
- Man: <i>Tell us some more, Rick</i>

1339
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:05,041
<i>( cheering, applause )</i>

1340
01:00:08,278 --> 01:00:11,280
Don't tell anyone that.
I want it to be a surprise.

1341
01:00:11,315 --> 01:00:13,683
So I told that joke.
Carried on,

1342
01:00:13,717 --> 01:00:15,551
getting a bit drunk
and telling jokes.

1343
01:00:15,586 --> 01:00:18,487
Eventually we sat down for the
meal at about a quarter to 10:00.

1344
01:00:18,522 --> 01:00:20,022
They put two tables together.

1345
01:00:20,056 --> 01:00:22,924
The hosts sat at either end
and they put me in the middle,

1346
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:26,326
opposite this very sweet,
but very deaf 80-year-old man.

1347
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:28,595
So the conversation
was a bit stilted.

1348
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:30,563
After about 20 minutes,
Ian, one of the hosts,

1349
01:00:30,598 --> 01:00:32,565
pops up and says,
"Oh, Ricky, tell that joke."

1350
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:34,400
I went, "What?"

1351
01:00:34,434 --> 01:00:36,602
All the old people went,
"Oh, we love jokes."

1352
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:38,471
"Do you?"

1353
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,441
I looked at Ian and Ian went,
"It'll be fine."

1354
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:45,310
I went, "Okay." And he got on with
his conversation.

1355
01:00:45,344 --> 01:00:47,212
And so they're all like that.

1356
01:00:47,246 --> 01:00:52,749
I went, "Um, oh... Uh...

1357
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:54,817
A father is sitting at home,
reading the paper.

1358
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:57,286
A little girl comes running...
" Told the whole joke.

1359
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,953
Got to the bit,
"Well, make something up."

1360
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:00,888
They went, ahem.
Silence.

1361
01:01:00,922 --> 01:01:04,623
I looked at Ian, he went,
"Not that one!"

1362
01:01:04,658 --> 01:01:06,458
Thank you so much.
You've been fantastic.

1363
01:01:06,493 --> 01:01:07,960
Good night.

1364
01:01:07,994 --> 01:01:11,130
( Cheering, whistling )

1365
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:31,415
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1366
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,650
Thank you so much.
Cheers.

1367
01:01:33,684 --> 01:01:36,686
Thank you.
Fantastic.

1368
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:39,723
Thank you so much.

1369
01:01:39,757 --> 01:01:42,892
I fucking love Chicago.
Isn't it brilliant?

1370
01:01:42,927 --> 01:01:45,728
- Isn't it amazing?
- ( Cheering )

1371
01:01:45,763 --> 01:01:47,530
I've had just the best time.

1372
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:48,932
Thank you...
Thank you so much.

1373
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:50,800
I'll tell you,
I'd risk coming again

1374
01:01:50,834 --> 01:01:52,901
through volcanic ash clouds...
anything to get here.

1375
01:01:52,936 --> 01:01:55,070
It's fantastic...
terrorist attack.

1376
01:01:55,105 --> 01:01:58,173
I've actually always been a
nervous flyer, to be honest.

1377
01:01:58,208 --> 01:02:01,476
I flew a few weeks
after 9-11.

1378
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,446
After 9-11,

1379
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,881
the world went a little
bit crazy, you know?

1380
01:02:06,915 --> 01:02:08,449
Understandably.
The rules changed

1381
01:02:08,483 --> 01:02:10,951
and there was a lot
of anger and fear

1382
01:02:10,985 --> 01:02:13,186
and confusion
and finger-pointing.

1383
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:14,888
And I had always
considered myself

1384
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:17,690
quite a rational,
liberal sort of guy,

1385
01:02:17,724 --> 01:02:21,193
and I tried to remain
that way after 9-11.

1386
01:02:21,227 --> 01:02:23,429
And even in the pub with mates

1387
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:25,498
I'd be the one who was going,
"No, you can't say that.

1388
01:02:25,532 --> 01:02:27,733
No, that's a generalization.
That's ridiculous.

1389
01:02:27,768 --> 01:02:29,569
No, that's unfair.

1390
01:02:29,603 --> 01:02:31,371
You can't tar everyone
with the same brush.

1391
01:02:31,405 --> 01:02:33,973
No, it's still the safest
form of transport.

1392
01:02:34,007 --> 01:02:35,908
It's 60 million to one,
the chance of a..."

1393
01:02:35,942 --> 01:02:39,111
You know, trying to be rational.
That's in a pub.

1394
01:02:39,145 --> 01:02:41,913
When I'm flying it's more like,
"Check him again.

1395
01:02:41,948 --> 01:02:44,048
Can we check him again?

1396
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:48,319
He's getting on this...
Do you mind if I check him?

1397
01:02:48,353 --> 01:02:50,721
Can I just...
can I just..."

1398
01:02:53,191 --> 01:02:57,027
After 9-11,
with all the checks,

1399
01:02:57,061 --> 01:02:59,161
I still tried to remain
rational and philosophical.

1400
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:01,597
I was thinking, "Right, it's
harder now than it ever was

1401
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,265
to get a bomb on the plane.

1402
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:06,569
This is... You know, the restrictions
are tight. It's safer now."

1403
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:08,437
And then I found out
that a terrorist

1404
01:03:08,472 --> 01:03:10,273
doesn't even have to get on
the plane now with a bomb.

1405
01:03:10,307 --> 01:03:11,941
They found
heat-seeking missiles,

1406
01:03:11,976 --> 01:03:14,678
and they could just park up
in some sort of lay-by

1407
01:03:14,712 --> 01:03:17,414
and take the plane out within the
first 10 minutes of take-off.

1408
01:03:17,448 --> 01:03:18,914
So now I'd be
on the plane going,

1409
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:22,451
"Right, we're out of range.
Who's got the bomb?"

1410
01:03:22,485 --> 01:03:25,721
As I said,
I flew a couple of weeks

1411
01:03:25,755 --> 01:03:28,290
after 9-11,
internal flight.

1412
01:03:28,325 --> 01:03:31,193
We're up in the air.
I had done the thing.

1413
01:03:31,228 --> 01:03:33,062
"We're out of range.
Right, okay."

1414
01:03:33,096 --> 01:03:35,798
I was still a bit nervous
and I said to the air hostess...

1415
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:38,868
I said, "Have you got
any magazines?"

1416
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:42,405
Think of this. She said, quite loud,
quite blasé...

1417
01:03:42,439 --> 01:03:45,408
she said, "No, honey,
we've got no magazines.

1418
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:47,810
We've had to undertake
severe cutbacks

1419
01:03:47,845 --> 01:03:51,381
because we're one of the
companies being sued over 9-11."

1420
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:54,683
One: Don't mention 9-11.

1421
01:03:54,717 --> 01:03:57,419
Surely a new rule book
went round.

1422
01:03:57,453 --> 01:03:59,955
"Don't mention 9-11 when you're
handing out the coffee."

1423
01:03:59,989 --> 01:04:01,623
Do you know what I mean?
Right?

1424
01:04:01,657 --> 01:04:04,626
Two: Don't say
"Severe cutbacks."

1425
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,894
Severe cutbacks...
if someone says that,

1426
01:04:06,929 --> 01:04:08,663
I don't think
of magazines anymore.

1427
01:04:08,697 --> 01:04:11,298
I think of a bloke in an aircraft
hangar earlier that week going,

1428
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:12,800
"Do we really need
all these rivets?"

1429
01:04:12,834 --> 01:04:17,503
It's just...
What terrible bedside manner.

1430
01:04:17,538 --> 01:04:19,839
I mean, I take first-class
flights everywhere.

1431
01:04:19,873 --> 01:04:21,474
I know you wouldn't
have it any other way.

1432
01:04:21,508 --> 01:04:23,442
I do it for you, really.

1433
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:29,381
Some of the flights I take
cost 10,000 pounds, okay?

1434
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:32,650
And for 10,000 pounds,
in a disaster

1435
01:04:32,684 --> 01:04:35,619
I expect the front end of my plane
that I'm in to gently break off

1436
01:04:35,654 --> 01:04:38,222
and float down
to a desert island.

1437
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:42,325
It doesn't.

1438
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,294
I'd die with the rest
of you fucking loss.

1439
01:04:44,328 --> 01:04:47,830
That's not fair, is it?

1440
01:04:47,864 --> 01:04:50,365
I know you'd try to save me,
but you couldn't.

1441
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,767
We'd just be on the news.

1442
01:04:52,802 --> 01:04:55,303
I'd probably be the only one who'd
get name-checked on the news.

1443
01:04:55,338 --> 01:04:58,339
You'd be "230 others,"
which is some consolation.

1444
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:04,511
But anyway...
So, okay.

1445
01:05:04,545 --> 01:05:08,613
Once I was flying back
from New York...

1446
01:05:08,648 --> 01:05:12,917
9:25, a Saturday night,
J.F.K. to London Heathrow,

1447
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,651
b.A., first class.

1448
01:05:14,686 --> 01:05:19,155
Okay, now this is my point.

1449
01:05:19,189 --> 01:05:23,091
It's fear that threatens
rational thought, I think.

1450
01:05:23,126 --> 01:05:25,059
I'm there.

1451
01:05:25,094 --> 01:05:27,061
Now the whole week
leading up to that flight...

1452
01:05:27,096 --> 01:05:28,596
I don't know if you remember it

1453
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:30,198
or it's happened
more than once.

1454
01:05:30,232 --> 01:05:31,867
It was a couple of years ago.

1455
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:33,902
On every news channel
in America

1456
01:05:33,936 --> 01:05:35,436
there was a rolling tickertape

1457
01:05:35,471 --> 01:05:37,905
that said
"America on red alert.

1458
01:05:37,939 --> 01:05:39,406
We've had intel
there's going to be

1459
01:05:39,441 --> 01:05:41,541
another 9-11
in a major city,

1460
01:05:41,576 --> 01:05:44,377
probably New York or L.A.
this weekend.

1461
01:05:44,412 --> 01:05:47,046
Do not fly unless
you absolutely had to."

1462
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,914
I had to.
I was filming.

1463
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:50,582
And...

1464
01:05:52,051 --> 01:05:53,518
( Laughs )
Right?

1465
01:05:53,552 --> 01:05:58,255
So I'm the only one
in the first-class lounge,

1466
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:00,357
and I still tried
to remain rational.

1467
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:02,525
I was thinking,
"No, it's safer now.

1468
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,527
Everyone's looking
for a terrorist today.

1469
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:06,262
They'll leave it
till Monday."

1470
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,364
Right?

1471
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:11,733
And then it happened... the thing that
threatened my rational thought.

1472
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:14,035
I had a little... a bit
of a mini-breakdown.

1473
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:16,970
Into the first-class lounge,
about 30 minutes

1474
01:06:17,005 --> 01:06:18,905
before boarding, came this guy.

1475
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,907
I don't whether
he was north African

1476
01:06:20,941 --> 01:06:22,842
or Middle Eastern or Asian,

1477
01:06:22,876 --> 01:06:25,777
but he had all the gear, right?

1478
01:06:28,347 --> 01:06:32,650
Beard,
steel attaché case, okay?

1479
01:06:32,684 --> 01:06:35,452
And here's your
middle-class liberal.

1480
01:06:35,487 --> 01:06:37,588
I went...

1481
01:06:43,627 --> 01:06:45,594
I was suddenly engaging staff

1482
01:06:45,628 --> 01:06:48,563
in banal conversation,
going, "Flight on time?"

1483
01:06:48,597 --> 01:06:50,997
They're going, "Yeah."
"What's the weather like in London?"

1484
01:06:51,032 --> 01:06:53,999
Like they were gonna go,
"It's a bit cloudy, but... There he is!"

1485
01:06:54,034 --> 01:06:55,868
Right?

1486
01:06:55,902 --> 01:06:57,736
Didn't happen.
So I'm left there, right?

1487
01:06:57,771 --> 01:07:01,573
I'm looking over at him
and I'm thinking of all the...

1488
01:07:01,607 --> 01:07:03,975
The running up to it
and the week coming up to...

1489
01:07:04,009 --> 01:07:05,476
All the news and everything.

1490
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,711
But now there's a fight
between good and evil,

1491
01:07:07,745 --> 01:07:10,480
between rational
and irrational.

1492
01:07:10,515 --> 01:07:14,884
This one goes, "Ooh,
that's a suicide bomber."

1493
01:07:14,919 --> 01:07:17,120
"Oh, don't be stupid.
Of course it isn't."

1494
01:07:17,154 --> 01:07:19,255
"It is."
"How do you know?"

1495
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:21,491
"That's what
they look like."

1496
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:25,828
"What?"

1497
01:07:25,862 --> 01:07:27,729
"Beard."

1498
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:31,032
"Don't be stupid,
all right?"

1499
01:07:31,067 --> 01:07:32,533
Then he makes a phone call.

1500
01:07:32,568 --> 01:07:34,201
I couldn't understand
what he was saying,

1501
01:07:34,236 --> 01:07:36,070
but he sounded a bit angry.

1502
01:07:36,104 --> 01:07:38,639
This one goes,
"Oh, he made a phone call!"

1503
01:07:38,673 --> 01:07:40,674
This one, "No, you just made
a phone call."

1504
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:44,310
"Yeah, but not
in foreign."

1505
01:07:44,344 --> 01:07:46,946
"Shut up, all right?
He's been checked.

1506
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,647
Like the rest of us,
he's been checked."

1507
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:50,915
"Did they check the beard?"
"Yeah, they checked the beard.

1508
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:53,551
Yeah, they checked
the beard."

1509
01:07:53,585 --> 01:07:56,019
Then I'm looking at him...
Must have been absent-minded

1510
01:07:56,054 --> 01:07:57,521
with all this going on
in my head.

1511
01:07:57,555 --> 01:08:00,223
He catches me looking
and he does this.

1512
01:08:02,626 --> 01:08:05,694
It goes, "Oh, he knows,
he knows!" Right?

1513
01:08:05,728 --> 01:08:07,695
This one goes, "No, he knows
why you're looking at him.

1514
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:10,031
He's had that prejudice for months now.
Stop looking at him."

1515
01:08:10,065 --> 01:08:13,067
"Ooh, the beard."
"Yeah... " Right?

1516
01:08:13,101 --> 01:08:15,402
But this one starts winning.

1517
01:08:15,436 --> 01:08:18,904
The fear starts beating all the
rational thought in the world.

1518
01:08:18,938 --> 01:08:20,605
It starts going,
"No, but it could be."

1519
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,574
"Well yeah, it could be.
Probably not."

1520
01:08:22,608 --> 01:08:25,510
"Well, no.
The stats are up today."

1521
01:08:25,544 --> 01:08:28,812
"Yeah, but still,
it won't happen..."

1522
01:08:28,846 --> 01:08:30,480
"Don't say it won't
happen to us.

1523
01:08:30,514 --> 01:08:32,348
The people of 9-11 said
it wouldn't happen to them."

1524
01:08:32,382 --> 01:08:33,382
"Yeah,
but all the tests..."

1525
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:34,549
"Yeah well, they find new ways

1526
01:08:34,584 --> 01:08:35,951
of getting through
our detection.

1527
01:08:35,985 --> 01:08:37,918
Then we have to up the game."
"Yeah, you're right."

1528
01:08:37,953 --> 01:08:41,222
And suddenly I thought,
"Oh my God, this is it. This is it."

1529
01:08:41,256 --> 01:08:43,990
That wave of nausea,
and you suddenly realize,

1530
01:08:44,024 --> 01:08:46,892
"Oh my God,
I'm witnessing this..."

1531
01:08:46,926 --> 01:08:50,562
this one goes,
"Okay, right, let's report him."

1532
01:08:50,596 --> 01:08:52,630
This one goes, "No."

1533
01:08:52,664 --> 01:08:54,365
"Why?"

1534
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,000
"In case someone think
we're racist."

1535
01:08:57,935 --> 01:08:59,502
"No, fuck that.

1536
01:08:59,537 --> 01:09:03,106
Let's report him
and be a wrong, embarrassed,

1537
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:06,876
live racist,
just in case."

1538
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,545
And I go, "No."
So I don't.

1539
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:13,081
And so now I think
he is a suicide bomber.

1540
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,049
I think I'm gonna
get on the plane and die,

1541
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,584
but I'm not gonna do
anything about it.

1542
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:17,885
I'm nearly in tears.

1543
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,653
And all this happens
in a few moments.

1544
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:23,023
I look over and he's joined by
his wife who's got all the gear

1545
01:09:23,057 --> 01:09:26,492
and his two little girls.

1546
01:09:26,527 --> 01:09:30,362
And I suddenly go, "Oh, of course
he's not a fucking suicide bomber.

1547
01:09:30,397 --> 01:09:32,364
If you're off to see
72 virgins,

1548
01:09:32,398 --> 01:09:34,131
you don't take
the wife and kids along."

1549
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:37,768
Right?
So... No.

1550
01:09:39,337 --> 01:09:42,405
I got on the plane, and of
course he wasn't a terrorist.

1551
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,941
I was a bit embarrassed and
I saw the funny side of it.

1552
01:09:44,976 --> 01:09:46,442
I was relieved and everything.

1553
01:09:46,476 --> 01:09:48,444
He was a businessman
and a family man.

1554
01:09:48,478 --> 01:09:49,945
He was playing
with his two little girls

1555
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,348
who kept running up and down
and banging into my chair.

1556
01:09:52,382 --> 01:09:54,416
He wasn't doing anything
about that at all.

1557
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:56,184
Nothing about that at all.

1558
01:09:56,218 --> 01:09:59,353
He was chasing 'em and they were
squealing really high, going through...

1559
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:00,821
After half an hour,
I was hoping

1560
01:10:00,855 --> 01:10:03,489
someone would blow the fucking
plane up, to be honest.

1561
01:10:06,426 --> 01:10:09,560
But a really weird thing
happened during that period.

1562
01:10:09,595 --> 01:10:12,897
I got so paranoid
about terrorist attack

1563
01:10:12,932 --> 01:10:14,899
that I started taking
private jets

1564
01:10:14,934 --> 01:10:18,502
and helicopters everywhere,
just because I was so rich.

1565
01:10:18,536 --> 01:10:20,937
No no.

1566
01:10:20,972 --> 01:10:22,505
No.

1567
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:26,242
No, again, my philosophy was

1568
01:10:26,277 --> 01:10:28,044
I'm the only person
on this plane

1569
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:29,912
and I definitely
haven't got a bomb,

1570
01:10:29,946 --> 01:10:32,480
so we're all right, you know.

1571
01:10:32,515 --> 01:10:35,783
I was taking
a helicopter one day

1572
01:10:35,817 --> 01:10:39,052
and I was waiting
on the helipad.

1573
01:10:39,087 --> 01:10:40,687
Rewind two days before that.

1574
01:10:40,721 --> 01:10:43,823
I'm at home, having my
cereal, my cheerios,

1575
01:10:43,857 --> 01:10:45,191
and there's
a carton of milk there

1576
01:10:45,225 --> 01:10:46,992
with the missing person
things on the back.

1577
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:48,727
And I've seen
a thousand of them.

1578
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:52,130
This one was different because it was a
missing child, which is always sadder.

1579
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,998
Well no, it's sad
when anyone goes missing.

1580
01:10:54,032 --> 01:10:55,498
But presumably,
because of her age,

1581
01:10:55,532 --> 01:10:57,899
this was an abduction
and, you know.

1582
01:10:57,934 --> 01:11:00,635
It was also the language.
It was a plea from the mother.

1583
01:11:00,669 --> 01:11:03,171
It was the wording.
She just said

1584
01:11:03,205 --> 01:11:05,039
the name of the little girl,
which I won't say.

1585
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:09,777
I remember it, and the day and
place where she was last seen.

1586
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:13,280
And she just said,
"Five years old,

1587
01:11:13,314 --> 01:11:15,948
blonde hair, blue eyes,
always happy.

1588
01:11:15,983 --> 01:11:17,416
Please help me."

1589
01:11:17,451 --> 01:11:18,918
And it must have
stayed with me.

1590
01:11:18,952 --> 01:11:20,686
Two days later, I'm there.

1591
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,822
It's like a wharf development,
waiting for this helicopter.

1592
01:11:23,857 --> 01:11:25,357
And I'm looking down

1593
01:11:25,391 --> 01:11:29,126
onto some disused
warehouse space.

1594
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:31,194
I look in one, right?

1595
01:11:31,229 --> 01:11:33,163
Someone had put up
a brown blanket

1596
01:11:33,197 --> 01:11:34,664
with this duct tape.

1597
01:11:34,698 --> 01:11:36,132
It was like a curtain.

1598
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,967
And it had fallen away
and I can see in.

1599
01:11:39,002 --> 01:11:40,669
This is a true story.

1600
01:11:40,703 --> 01:11:43,137
It's an empty room
apart from a mattress.

1601
01:11:43,172 --> 01:11:46,307
And on the mattress is a little
girl with her hands tied.

1602
01:11:46,341 --> 01:11:48,942
And my fucking heart...

1603
01:11:48,977 --> 01:11:50,577
Five years old, five years old.

1604
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:53,613
Blonde hair, blonde hair.
Blue eyes, blue eyes.

1605
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:56,549
Always happy,
crying her eyes out.

1606
01:12:03,856 --> 01:12:05,556
What?

1607
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:07,424
It... it couldn't
have been her.

1608
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:09,092
I left it.

1609
01:12:09,126 --> 01:12:10,593
Thanks very much.
You've been amazing.

1610
01:12:10,628 --> 01:12:12,795
Goodnight, Chicago.
Cheers!

1611
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,498
Thank you.
Cheers.

1612
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:18,066
<i>Oh, thank...</i>
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1613
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:19,067
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1614
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,203
Thank you.
Cheers.

1615
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:24,338
Thank you.

1616
01:12:28,543 --> 01:12:30,644
Cheers, everyone.

1617
01:12:34,715 --> 01:12:36,415
Goodnight, everyone.
Thank you.
