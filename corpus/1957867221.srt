00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,379
(explosion)

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,509
(mouse clicking)

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,429
Durga temple, home of an ancient sect

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,807
of warrior monks, militant renegades,

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,892
who claim to have defended society

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,352
throughout history from

7
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,813
the malevolence evil presence, born

8
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,608
of fire and hatred, known as the Gin.

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,694
The Durga's eccentric leader,

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,321
the grand Zel, dispatches platoons

11
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:34,033
of his zealous followers around the world.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,035
Their mission, to extinguish

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,120
the Gin's power of possession

14
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,373
and to finally locate
the reincarnated soul

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,916
of their fierce goddess,

16
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,877
the eternal Ecajetty.

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,213
Zel tirelessly searches the astral realm

18
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,842
for a sign that he himself
must enter the battle.

19
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,345
(eerie music)

20
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,713
Look.

21
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,175
(birds chirping)

22
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,135
(Stacey laughing)

23
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,344
Dinner's almost ready.

24
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,304
Okay, mom.

25
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,388
Oh, can Gina stay over?

26
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,141
Sure, but make sure you call her mom.

27
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,060
Okay Mom.

28
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,021
My mom's working till midnight anyway.

29
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,940
Yo, did you hear about those kids

30
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,817
in San Diego who found a body

31
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,860
in the trunk of an abandoned car?

32
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,155
They were using this new Epifanati app.

33
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,448
Oh, really?

34
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,534
(birds chirping)

35
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,077
This isn't real.

36
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,495
I don't believe you, you're a liar.

37
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,330
I'm not a liar.

38
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,541
I already downloaded it anyway.

39
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,376
(birds chirping)

40
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,709
Wanna do it?

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,294
Not really.

42
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,754
Well, we're doing it.

43
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,714
Okay, to start it says you

44
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,965
just have to pick your distance.

45
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,466
But what?

46
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,844
How far? You decide.

47
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,430
It says 1,000 meters or 5,000 meters.

48
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,391
How far is that?

49
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,434
I don't know, it's like European.

50
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,687
Okay, fine 1,000.

51
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:33,153
1,000, now it says to close your eyes

52
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,112
and think of an objective.

53
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,072
What?

54
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:36,906
(birds chirping)

55
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,116
Like (sighing) imagine what

56
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,077
you wanna experience, okay?

57
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,581
(eerie music)

58
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,791
Death.
- Gina, are you crazy?

59
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,293
(laughs) What, are you scared?

60
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,336
Gina, change your objection right now.

61
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,005
Too late, see it's already searching

62
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,006
for a location.

63
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,549
(Stacey sighing)

64
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,426
Hey, you should go live right now.

65
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,386
No.

66
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,679
Come on, do it.

67
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,139
Okay, fine, okay.

68
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,893
(birds chirping)

69
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,399
Hey, all my cool cats and kittens.

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,775
I'm here with my girl, Gina.

71
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,195
And we're about to try this new epif...

72
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,155
Epifanati.

73
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,448
Epifanati app, and Gina picked death

74
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,532
as a fricking objective, and now,

75
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,909
we have to walk around and focus

76
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,702
on death, great.

77
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,662
(eerie music)

78
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:29,208
Yo, it says that the
location's already here.

79
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,251
(eerie music)

80
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,336
It's in your backyard.

81
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,879
This has been such a great adventure.

82
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,964
You've taken me to my backyard

83
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,716
that we're already in.

84
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,469
I mean, look, the flowers back there

85
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,803
are definitely dead.
- Stacey?

86
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,972
This bush is definitely dead

87
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,599
and this ball is definitely dead.

88
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,605
(eerie music)
(growling sound effects)

89
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,860
(fire crackling and crickets stridulating)

90
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,695
Gina?

91
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,157
(eerie music)

92
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,035
Gina, this isn't funny.

93
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,373
(crickets stridulating)

94
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,460
Gina?

95
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,921
(eerie music)
Gina, you're scaring me!

96
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,510
(growling sound effects and screaming)

97
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,516
(crickets stridulating)

98
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,725
Sweetie?

99
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,396
(Stacey screaming)

100
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,899
(eerie music)

101
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,596
[Jeffrey] Despite a
shaky business future

102
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,057
here in the US, apps like TikTok

103
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,351
and Triller have gained a strong foothold

104
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,019
in the entertainment industry.

105
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,813
The new app on the block, Claktion, claims

106
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,148
to set itself apart from

107
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,108
its competitors, offering tools

108
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,903
for aspiring filmmakers and storytellers.

109
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,988
Ahead of the app's official release,

110
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,698
Claktion hosted what it called

111
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,409
a content creator's camp, slated to be

112
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,245
a week long event led
by popular influencer

113
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,706
and local celebrity, Chaz Bruce,

114
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,999
whose dance videos

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,960
and comedic creations dubbed #brucegang

116
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,671
have garnered millions of fans.

117
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,548
A small group of willing creators

118
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,634
were selected to come to our city

119
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,969
and learn the finer points of making

120
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,013
and distributing digital content,

121
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,392
all in hopes of gaining
followers and fame.

122
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,601
[Male] Is this all the content created

123
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,727
by the campers?

124
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,105
[Man] Yeah, so much death.

125
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,106
Damn.

126
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,566
(static buzzing)

127
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,693
Hopefully Zel can put this right.

128
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,238
Praise Ecajutty.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

129
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,115

(clapper clapping)

132
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,994
What's going on creators?

133
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,330
Look, my name is Chaz Bruce.

134
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,124
I'm really excited to be one

135
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,625

What's up, what's up, Claktion people?

153
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,944
Me and Dash just got up here checking out

154
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,487
the campsite where we
gonna have the campers at.

155
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,488
Aye, aye.

156
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,240
Aye, aye, aye.
- These are protective masks

157
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,075
we gonna be wearing,

158
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,200
I got on my protective mask.

159
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,536
As you can see Dash don't got on his.

160
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,704
[Dash] Yo, I dunno if I'm gonna be able

161
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,038
to do all of this mask thing, man,

162
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,415
every day, 24 hours.

163
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,791
It's about protection,
you know what I mean?

164
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,127
[Dash] In the sun, breathe, run,

165
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,045
sing, dance with a mask on,

166
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,130
I dunno if I'm gonna do that.

167
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,465
He don't like protection.

168
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,841
That's how he got all them kids now,

169
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,426

(clapper clapping)

170
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,846
(upbeat music)

171
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,681
(clapper clapping)

172
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:54,682
(air whooshing)

173
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,475
Baby, I was sitting here thinking

174
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,311
about when I used to be
a substitute teacher.

175
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,854
So, after I take a tennis,

176
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,274
I get up goes on over to the DVD player.

177
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,234
Put it in, come back, sit down

178
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,111
and woo, woo, woo, woo.

179
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:13,325
I sit on something hard
and the kids just howl,

180
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,452
I mean, they screaming with laughter.

181
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,289
I get up and I look at what I sat down on

182
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,459
and it's a giant penis, giant penis.

183
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,046
Giant penis made outta tape

184
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,256
with the testicles and everything.

185
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,382
(upbeat music)

186
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,593
Granny loves you.

187
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,844
[Chaz] Granny Love.

188
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,929
(crowd laughing and chattering)

189
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,389
Hey, Granny loves, love you, Granny.

190
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,225
(people chattering)

191
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,059
Are you ready for camp?

192
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,559
Are you really ready?
- I'm ready for camp.

193
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,394
Yes, I am.

194
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,437
[Male] You already know
content is key, okay?

195
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,064
I got you, I got you.

196
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,148
(people chattering)

197
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,275
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

198
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,110
Granny didn't know what to expect

199
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,029
when she got here, but this

200
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,447
is something brand new.

201
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,491
Yeah, that's why they say youth

202
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,826
is wasted on the young.

203
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:01,290
Let the journey begin,
but protection first, mm.

204
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,586
(airplane engine whirring)

205
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,922
You know my brand.

206
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,092
I need to do a clear reading, right?

207
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,596
Boop, the fool.

208
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,640
Why did your parents choose that name

209
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,766
is what I wanna know.
- I dunno,

210
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,976
because I'm special.

211
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,185
Yeah, (mumbling).

212
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,853
All right, let's get it clacking.

213
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,814
Wait, bye-
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

214
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,567
(males mumbling)

215
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:33,530
Girl, can you believe I am here?

216
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,116
Okay, let's see what's in here.

217
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,369
Get out of town, girl, Claktion.

218
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,620
Okay, I'm gonna take this off.

219
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,706
Hello, my name is Nadia.

220
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,250
I should be chosen for this camp

221
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,835
because I can teach.

222
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,753
(sighs) wow, just to love yourself,

223
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,672
to love your body and to embrace

224
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,508
the power of the erotic,
the sacred feminine.

225
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,718
[Male] How to get any girl's attention

226
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,886
at a party, quick glance, smile.

227
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,097
Look at a friend, take a drink,

228
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,309
look away and bring him back.

229
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,561
I like your content a lot.

230
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,396
Thank you.

231
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,023
I think I've watched
just about every video.

232
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,274
I only seen like one,

233
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,735
but that one that I seen was a good one,

234
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,902
it was a good one.

235
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,863
I can't believe it.

236
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,614
I can't believe I'm here.

237
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,158
Oh, it's so beautiful.

238
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,909
(playful music)

239
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,077
I like to consider myself

240
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,912
an intellectual triple threat

241
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,165
because I'm blonde and Polish.
(audience laughing)

242
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,334
Oh my God, are you like obsessed

243
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,252
with me or something?
(audience laughing)

244
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,087
Thank you.

245
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,421
[Chaz] Welcome to the Clack it camp.

246
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,839
[Man] Let's get it,
let's get it clacking.

247
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,090
It is getting clacking.

248
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,342
[Chaz] Can you hit it one more time?

249
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,844
[Man] Whoa, whoa!
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

250
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,515
I got a cute little
new backpack mini, no.

251
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,601
(beep) that, oh (beep) that's so hard.

252
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,520
There was a big spider.

253
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,338
[Chaz] Next!

254
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,464
Oh.
- Oh.

255
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,132
- [Chaz] Malik, what's...
- Oh.

256
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,717
[Chaz] Oh, wait, there's supposed to be

257
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,096
an interpreter for you.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

258
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,390
We dunno. There we go.
- Yes.

259
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,225
[Chaz] Thank you.

260
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,350
What's going on?

261
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,185
[Female] This is not the interpreter

262
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,019
I asked for.

263
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,520
- [Male] Oh.
- I don't know-

264
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,938
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

265
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,981
The one we had, he not here.

266
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,108
He'll be here later, though.

267
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,026
Okay, so this is...

268
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,902
She's like a stand in,

269
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,695
this is kind of like a substitute,

270
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,571
but you'd be good, right?

271
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,407
One time.
- One time.

272
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:43,828
Uh! Hey, yeah!
(male laughing and clapping)

273
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,044
Hey guys, I'm Irene Rushing.

274
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,547
Welcome to my page, Lickety Split Make-Up.

275
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,841
This is my first video,

276
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,218
which is basically me playing

277
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,638
a song and finishing my makeup

278
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,181
by the time it's over.

279
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,350
But so, I'm gonna start with one

280
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,186
of my favorite songs by Kelly Clarks on,

281
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,105
"Behind Your Hazel Eyes".

282
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,692
(upbeat music)

283
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,364
Almost, Irene, almost.

284
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,450
Yes, I'm so excited!

285
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,534
I got you, boo.

286
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,369
- Ooh.
- I got you.

287
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,411
- Oh, I'm so happy.
- How many you want?

288
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,912
How many follows you want?

289
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,372
I want like 20K.

290
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,874
Say less. We gonna do that in-

291
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,751
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

292
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,668
Hey, hey, can somebody bring her 20K?

293
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,836
We gotta hit a dance.
Throw it, throw it up.

294
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,837
Gotta do-
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

295
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,672
Here we go.

296
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,047
Hey, whoa!
(female laughing)

297
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,842
Every whoa was no.
- Yeah. (laughs)

298
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,218
- Every whoa.
- Absolutely.

299
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,595
It was like whoa.

300
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,514
One time, so I'm
really afraid of needles.

301
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:51,394
So, I decided one time to give blood.

302
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,647
Oh, what a glorious day.

303
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,024
[Irene] It's such a nice day,

304
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,652
but I know I'm gonna get so hot.

305
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,824
I woke up to seven nurses,

306
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,744
like Grey's Anatomy shot.

307
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,621
I'm gonna do my best to stay safe.

308
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,791
And I'm gonna keep my eyes open

309
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,126
'cause honey, one of these critters jump

310
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,377
up outta here,

311
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,922
they gonna see Granny run all around

312
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,757
(chuckles) this place.

313
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,509
So, what I used to get
from social media experts

314
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,011
is like, pick your niche and go with that.

315
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,638
I got started getting a lot of requests

316
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,264
from different schools
and principals asking me

317
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,141
to come to their school.

318
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,017
Could you come to my school,

319
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,100
could you come to my classroom

320
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,644
and it's very inspiring.

321
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,604
It's a different kind of thing

322
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,022
when you can teach outside in the world.

323
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,524
What's up? Welcome!

324
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,400
Welcome!
(group cheering)

325
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,526
Oh, y'all gotta come on now.

326
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,610
Y'all gotta-
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

327
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,237
(group cheering and clapping)

328
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,155
Come on now, y'all here for...

329
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,990
Y'all almost don't want no followers.

330
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,534
First day, right, we're gonna be dealing

331
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,618
with the persona.

332
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,453
Persona.

333
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,581
Thank you.

334
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,082
What's your personality like?

335
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,417
What do you do?

336
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,294
What do you like?

337
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,004
'Cause your followers
wanna see who you are,

338
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,340
you know what I mean?
- Right, like I just said.

339
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,175
Day two.

340
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,134
Filming and editing tech-

341
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,010
- Right.
- Right.

342
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,845
[Wai] I am distracted, ladies

343
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,722
and gentlemen, distracted.

344
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,059
(Rob chattering)
I am horrible,

345
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,061
but for everyone who is out there,

346
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,605
you're welcome, you're welcome.

347
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,982
Day three, right so-

348
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,442
Day three, marketing and publicity.

349
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,529
So, this is where a lot of people miss.

350
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,739
What other type of copy
that you're putting out

351
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,325
that's directing to
whatever kind of business

352
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,452
and is it making sense, right?

353
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,996
Do you wanna be like me or not?

354
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,289
(crowd cheering)

355
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,999
That's what I'm talking...

356
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,834
(laughs) That's what I'm-

357
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,668
(crowd cheering)
All right.

358
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,502
The grand finale, listen,

359
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,795
we don't got you guys here for nothing.

360
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,755
- [Chaz] Right.
- After all of

361
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,464
that content creation, right,

362
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,300
we're gonna turn up.

363
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,175
We have special guests.

364
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,012
- [Man] Woo!
- DJ Salad.

365
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,680
[Chaz] Eat it fresh.
(crowd cheering)

366
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,056
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

367
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:52,892
We are out of time.

368
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,851
Diddy's gonna bring some of his friends.

369
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,686
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

370
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,104
You lie.
(people chattering)

371
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:58,939
[Wai] Get out.

372
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,857
The best content creation.

373
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,733
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

374
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,567
Are we going to the hotel first

375
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,693
and like change before we start the day?

376
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,112
- [Female] Yeah.
- Oh, no, we start right away.

377
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,031
We have started.

378
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,741
Okay, so now that we got everything out

379
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,285
of the way, we know how
the weekend's gonna go.

380
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,870
Let's head down to the field

381
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,288
and we're gonna get started with the-

382
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,124
Claktion Olympics.

383
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,334
Right this way.

384
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,836
[Chaz] Claktion Olympics.

385
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,340
(eerie music)

386
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,760
(door creaking)

387
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,263
(eerie music)

388
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,733
Oh, you got a problem, man?

389
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,234
Actually, yeah.

390
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,694
How y'all gonna arrest me for helping run

391
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,072
an adult summer camp?

392
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,782
They all signed waivers.

393
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,283
They knew what they was getting into.

394
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,535
Rob, if you want us to help you,

395
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,080
you're gonna need to cooperate.

396
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,207
Can we get you anything?

397
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,336
Smoke?

398
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,882
You know this doesn't really look good

399
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,510
on you, praying on all
these people like that.

400
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,553
Praying, I know y'all not talking

401
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,264
about what we charging for the camp.

402
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,308
Man, these people will pay anything

403
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,977
for some new followers,

404
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,561
for a little bit of clout,

405
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,939
for a taste of fame.

406
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,774
Shit, we ain't doing nothing illegal.

407
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,609
Oh, you think we give

408
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,193
a flying fuck about legalities?

409
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,654
Rob, (chuckles) we're not cops.

410
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,905
(male laughing)

411
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,032
[Rob] Oh, you're not.

412
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,742
How about you take off these cuffs then

413
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,952
and let me the fuck outta here?

414
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,122
Nah, you're not going anywhere until

415
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,290
you tell us who is behind this camp.

416
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,002
No one knows you're here.

417
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,753
So, we're gonna need you

418
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,838
to answer our questions, understood?

419
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,465
Now, who put this loathsome camp together?

420
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,968
Who put it together?
- Chaz.

421
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,928
It was Chaz.

422
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,221
Shit, if that's all y'all wanted to know,

423
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,306
that's all you had to say.

424
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,935
You expect us to believe
that #brucegangchaz

425
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,687
is the one that put
this camp together, got

426
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,189
the specific individuals together

427
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,817
to unleash the prophecy
of the doom scroll?

428
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,444
The prophecy of what?

429
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,487
We know it's not Chaz.

430
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,865
Did someone reach out
to you from Epifanati?

431
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,700
(eerie music)

432
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,867
From the stupid app?

433
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,909
[Male] Yeah, Epifanati

434
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,619
is a shadow corporation bent

435
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,705
on promoting societal
decay through the use

436
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,457
of social media communities.

437
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,626
(laughs) So, what that gotta do with me?

438
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,879
Well, Rob, by encouraging them all

439
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,630
to come here and dehumanize each other

440
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,300
by creating this loathsome content,

441
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,427
you sealed their fate.

442
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,095
That's what it has to do with you.

443
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,473
So, I get all of this just

444
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,100
for helping people make
some stupid videos,

445
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,144
having a field day, making

446
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,604
up stupid dances and shit?

447
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,731
Come on, man.

448
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,110
(upbeat music)

449
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,366
Yes, let's go. Let's go, come on!

450
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,367
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

451
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,744
(male laughing)

452
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,748
(people chattering)

453
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,502
(upbeat music)

454
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,128
Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

455
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,965
(female mumbling)

456
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,968
I cannot not believe we lose, ugh!

457
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,845
Granny was our good luck charm.

458
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,014
Oh, well we have Granny.

459
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,934
It's not fair! We have Granny.

460
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,352
That was great.

461
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:28,440
(people cheering and chattering)

462
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:38,199
- [Male] Go, go go!
- [Man] Go, go, go!

463
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,243
(people cheering and chattering)

464
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,913
Turn around there, go, go, go, go, yeah!

465
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,500
(upbeat music)

466
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,253
To the right first.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

467
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,462
Right then left.

468
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,048
So, it's gonna like right, left.

469
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:54,883
Then we go-
- Hey, can you get

470
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,717
a little bit away.

471
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,928
Your instruction and my
instruction, same time.

472
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,513
Well, can all just follow me since

473
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,931
I'm the lead, so.

474
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,891
[Male] Yes, you're the lead,

475
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,100
but I'm the better dancer.

476
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,271
(eerie sound effects)

477
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,027
I really didn't expect for you guys

478
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,279
to have as much fun as you had.

479
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,447
(group cheering)

480
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,408
Someone who touched my
heart, man throughout

481
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,077
the Olympics and someone that I felt like

482
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,078
I really connected with.

483
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,079
I connected with y'all,

484
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,831
but there was someone who stand out

485
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,292
and come together we're
gonna be best friends.

486
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,210
So, that's what-

487
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,627
(group exclaiming and laughing)

488
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,630
(group cheering and clapping)

489
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,841
(cheering drowns out speaker)

490
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,302
See, right there. Yes, Alia.

491
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,845
Woo!
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

492
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,805
[Chaz] Yeah, right there.

493
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,974
I can't let that bitch keep on winning.

494
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,394
What did she do to win?

495
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,604
What did she do to win?

496
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,148
Like what were we doing?

497
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,359
I mean, I want everyone
to win. I really do.

498
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,861
Yeah. (laughs)

499
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,113
But you know?
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

500
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,073
Now, it's time to kick
it in the rear gear.

501
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,618
For the rest of the
day right here at camp,

502
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,245
we're gonna now start
using the Epifanati app.

503
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,080
[Narrator] Through years

504
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,915
of intense archeological research

505
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,541
and one serendipitous moment.

506
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,376
We are now finally able to present

507
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,546
to you, Epifanati.
(triumphant music)

508
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,006
I wanna open up this app

509
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,926
and I'm gonna focus on
my objective, right?

510
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,262
♪ Epifanati ♪

511
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,806
Get out. (laughs)

512
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,642
That's what you gotta do.

513
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:27,808
You gotta make sure you have an objective

514
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,186
in mind, focus on that, and then,

515
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,064
the app is gonna give me a location.

516
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,690
Rob, make sure you...

517
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,525
I need you down there.

518
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,567
I need you to get everything.

519
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,402
Got you.

520
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,237
Okay, this is where

521
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,071
it's gonna get real nice, okay?

522
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:39,905
Woo hoo!

523
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,822
Nah, I need y'all to be with me, right?

524
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,199
I need you to get your focus right

525
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,369
because after I do it,
you're gonna do the same.

526
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,579
I'm gonna put in the distance, 50 meters.

527
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,168
50 meters.

528
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,836
Focus on my objective.

529
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,631
My objective is happiness.

530
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,175
That's something that I always push out.

531
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,593
I'm always happy. I'm always singing.

532
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,761
I'm always dancing.
- Okay.

533
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,721
Happiness is everything,

534
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,389
that's what I'm trying to kick around

535
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,598
it all.
- All right then.

536
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,433
There we go.

537
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,186
The journey has started.

538
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,021
(people chattering)

539
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,981
[Debrah] Now, I wonder
how long 50 meters is.

540
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:15,816
[Rob] What are you saying?

541
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,316
[Chaz] The journey has begun.

542
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,943
I hope it ain't no long way

543
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,778
'cause like Granny, ain't fixing

544
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,904
it be walking no home.

545
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,322
Make sure you capture all of that.

546
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,117
[Debrah] They need to speak in English.

547
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,911
I don't know what no 50 meters is.

548
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,122
[Wai] I have no idea what's going on,

549
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,791
but I'm super excited about this.

550
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,543
I heard that it's a scary app.

551
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,628
Like, I don't know,

552
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,922
this is all about intentions and stuff.

553
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:44,677
So, I don't know, but
that's Granny right there.

554
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,845
Hey, Granny.

555
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,972
How many is 50 meters, how long is that?

556
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,893
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

557
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:53,729
[Chaz] I dunno about y'all,

558
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,730
but I'm starting feel
good (indistinct) already.

559
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,857
[Debrah] I'm starting to feel happy.

560
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,233
I see some shade.

561
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,319
[Wai] Yes, sure.

562
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,237
(people chattering)

563
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,739
It's hot as hell.
- I dunno if I feel it.

564
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,532
[Female] I do.

565
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,366
Oh, you do?

566
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,117
No, I feel hot.

567
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:08,952
It is.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

568
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,786
[Wai] It's hot, but it ain't hot

569
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,620
as hell, baby.
- It's the sun.

570
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,247
It's definitely (chuckles) so hot out.

571
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,249
It's not hot as hell.

572
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,625
- [Wai] Okay.
- It's beautiful.

573
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,586
(people chattering)

574
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,545
[Wai] Okay, geez, very-

575
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,379
- The sun is just-
- What a beautiful sun too.

576
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,048
It gives this light.

577
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,009
- Hey.
- (chuckles) Hey, what's up?

578
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,510
Say hey, everyone.

579
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,762
(Rob laughing)

580
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,680
Mm-hmm.

581
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,681
[Irene] Do you do this or this?

582
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,516
- I rotate.
- What?

583
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,517
I go back and forth.

584
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:36,520
[Irene] No, no, get out.

585
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,105
You guys see what I'm talking about?

586
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,106
Yo!

587
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,566
[Chaz] If you focus
on the wall. (chuckles)

588
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,735
[Irene] No way.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

589
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,070
[Nadia] I didn't even notice.

590
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:44,863
[Irene] What?

591
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,739
This is (indistinct).

592
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,369
This look exactly like the shell I found

593
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,746
in my happiest moments
was when I was in Hawaii.

594
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,623
[Irene] (gasps) Oh my God.

595
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:58,501
And I had to stick with
me too when I walked.

596
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,336
And it just makes sense.

597
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,420
(Irene gasping)

598
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,421
This is the type of stuff

599
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,798
I'm telling you about, man.

600
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,674
Exactly what I'm talking about.

601
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,092
When you focus on happiness,

602
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,927
you focus on your objective,

603
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,887
the app will make sure somehow

604
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,055
that it connects with you.

605
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,724
And this can happen for you too, right?

606
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,142
Whatever your objective is,

607
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,477
you stay focused on it.

608
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:20,564
And then, the app will
make it happen for you.

609
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,691
This is like, this is perfect.

610
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,568
I hope you guys are as excited as I am.

611
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,196
- [Group] Yeah!
- Woo! Yeah.

612
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,739
(people chattering)

613
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,326
(trumpet sound effect)
- Wow!

614
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,161
(group cheering)

615
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,372
[Male] Do it again.

616
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,417
(group cheering)

617
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,252
(trumpet sound effect)
(female laughing)

618
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,045
[Debrah] Oh my goodness, that was hot.

619
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,755
- [Male] Do it again!
- Woo!

620
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,756
(female laughing)

621
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,508
Now, it's your turn.

622
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,718
Now it's your turn,
focus on your objective.

623
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,595
(trumpet sound effect)

624
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,847
Woo! Woo hoo!

625
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,559
Okay, it's your turn

626
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,768
and what we're gonna
do is we're gonna leave

627
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,853
it to fate.

628
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,521
You guys are gonna come
and grab the straw.

629
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,190
The person with the longest
straw will go first.

630
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,609
Start thinking about
your objective right now.

631
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,194
Come on, brother.

632
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,113
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)
Don't be afraid,

633
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,405
don't be scared, don't be scared.

634
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,198
[Male] Don't go rest now.

635
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,992
[Wai] It's pretty short. (laughs)

636
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,535
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)
It looks short.

637
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,495
[Debrah] Mine is kinda-

638
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,414
All right, hold them up, hold them up.

639
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,040
Nadia, looks like you're the-

640
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,001
(group cheering)

641
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,918
You're gonna go, what do you say?

642
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,213
- I need you to focus.
- Nadia, seriously, girl

643
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,507
I'm not happy about this.

644
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,842
I wanted to go first.

645
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,677
The first thing you gonna have

646
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,511
to do is set your distance.

647
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,053
How far do you wanna go?

648
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,388
[Alia] 3,000.

649
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,183
- (laughs) 3,000.
- What do you wanna do?

650
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,309
[Nadia] 3,000. (laughs)

651
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,144
- [Man] 3,000.
- What is that,

652
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,603
like seven miles?

653
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,146
(chuckles) It's like 70.

654
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,481
(people chattering)

655
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,857
Gives me more time to think.

656
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,275
[Chaz] Focus on your objective,

657
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,735
and then, when you're ready,

658
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,861
I want you to make that announcement

659
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,987
to the group.

660
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,158
(eerie sound effects)

661
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,793
I want to covert everyone and all people

662
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,464
to worship the sun as their god.

663
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,850
That like that, okay.

664
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,393
Okay, girl, whatever

665
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,229
you want, honey.

666
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,271
I'm good, I'm game.

667
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,565
I want to convert everyone

668
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:31,070
and all people to worship
the sun as their god.

669
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,406
The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun.

670
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,616
[Irene] Are we going?

671
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,618
(people chattering)
- Yes, yes.

672
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,246
- [Irene] Oh dear, here we go.
- Okay, I'm here.

673
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,830
[Male] Let's go, let's see that.

674
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,666
Here for a good time.
- Did you say

675
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:43,832
how many meters?

676
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,002
[Irene] I mean, the sun.

677
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,546
[Chaz] You know this
shit getting real, right?

678
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,880
[Rob] I see it.

679
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,465
Mm, that Epifinati (chuckles) shit

680
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,550
is not a joke, man.

681
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,759
[Man] Word.

682
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,969
[Male] Don't you walk
in front of me, walk

683
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,804
in front of him.

684
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:56,930
Looks like they got a situation.

685
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,641
They got a situation.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

686
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,935
But look, keep everything.

687
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,938
Record, this is when we
wanna record everything.

688
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,565
You understand? Don't stop.

689
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,191
Don't stop recording.

690
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,026
[Rob] All right, got you.

691
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,027
Do not stop recording.

692
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,820
I mean, I am not sure

693
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,613
about the whole sun god thing,

694
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,949
but I'm intrigued of what she'll find,

695
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,534
you know what I'm saying?

696
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,870
I mean, I do kind of like,

697
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,583
I don't wanna say study, but I read.

698
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,669
I read up on the Egyptian gods and stuff,

699
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,880
so I think, it's pretty
interesting, right?

700
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,758
[Irene] Truthfully, I've got my own set

701
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,469
of spiritual beliefs

702
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,972
and this isn't very interesting to me.

703
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,224
Like this following the sun,

704
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:46,061
I don't find that to be very interesting.

705
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:49,064
So, she wants to convert everybody.

706
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,443
She's using very like polarizing language

707
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,944
in this way.

708
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,696
I don't wanna be converted.

709
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,739
I mean, I'm good.

710
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,659
Here we go with the sun lady.

711
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,829
Well, I guess, she got a point.

712
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,831
[Irene] I don't wanna be converted.

713
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,374
I mean, I'm good.
(eerie music)

714
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,626
Here we go.

715
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,087
(eerie music)

716
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,599
Ugh.

717
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,602
Uh, oh. Shit, oh my God.

718
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,148
Good evening, Mr. Toshman.

719
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:31,983
You almost cracked your head

720
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:32,984
when you passed out last night,

721
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,401
but no worries.

722
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,071
We patched you up and cleaned you up.

723
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,781
You all right?
- Ugh!

724
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,157
Mm.

725
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,076
What the fuck happened to my head?

726
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,870
Mm, where's the show's family?

727
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,789
Where's the boy that his mom gave

728
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,956
him to the hospital?

729
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,209
They wasn't even supposed to be there.

730
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,585
I don't even know how they got there.

731
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,545
They didn't make it into the camp.

732
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,381
So, you're saying they

733
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:55,714
just magically appeared when one

734
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,257
of your other influencers left?

735
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,176
I mean, I don't know.

736
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,844
I really don't know how
they got into the park.

737
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,264
Like Rob had a very
strict selection process.

738
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,557
[Man] Whoa, Rob, I thought

739
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,934
the camp was Chaz's idea.

740
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:11,022
No, Rob called me and I brought Chaz in.

741
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,275
Listen, Chaz has millions of followers

742
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,985
and I knew if we had him there,

743
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,654
then more people would come,

744
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,031
especially Grandma Love, she loves him.

745
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,074
So, we put together the camp

746
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,493
because they told Rob if we did more,

747
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,704
and did a good job, that we could do more.

748
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,539
And it's more money like who doesn't

749
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,374
want to make-

750
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,625
Who is they?

751
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:36,130
Claktion, or the bigger company.

752
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:40,384
Ugh, like Epifanati.

753
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,345
So, you all work for Epifanati?

754
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,473
Yeah, I wrote the jingle for them.

755
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,017
I actually stole it from (mumbles),

756
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:53,272
but I mean, that's not why y'all are here-

757
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,858
People are dead.

758
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:02,115
The family? The boy died?

759
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,409
All of them.

760
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,286
What?

761
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,078
[Male] Well, most of them.

762
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,454
We did get Granny help in time,

763
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,749
but some of them are still missing.

764
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,003
[Man] The Egyptian
woman, you liked her, huh?

765
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,007
Well, she liked you.

766
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,969
She trusted you, they all did.

767
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:30,435
What? I didn't kill
nobody. (cries softly)

768
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,564
[Nadia] I can't believe

769
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,065
this is really happening.

770
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,026
I can feel it.

771
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:43,864
I can feel the energy and
it's getting stronger.

772
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,824
I broke a nail.
(people chattering)

773
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,827
In fact, I didn't even break a nail,

774
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,497
but the woods took my nail.

775
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,707
(people chattering)

776
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:57,629
Well, this is another
adventure for Granny.

777
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,964
Oh Lord.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

778
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,174
[Alia] I definitely should

779
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,386
have peed before we went out on this.

780
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,971
That's crazy, that's something

781
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,765
that I would fall in

782
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,975
without even seeing it, oh yeah.

783
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,730
[Wai] She's on it. She is on to journey.

784
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,193
(whispering resounding)

785
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,282
(eerie sound effects)

786
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,201
Did you just see that?

787
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,409
[Irene] See what?

788
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,411
The dog that just ran passed.

789
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,579
[Irene] The dog?

790
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,748
Yeah, a dog.

791
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:35,917
A doll, no dog.

792
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,251
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

793
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,086
Where?

794
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,503
[Rob] Just a reflection
of them shiny hands.

795
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,296
[Chaz] Hey man, I ain't
playing with nobody dog.

796
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,131
[Debrah] I aint seen no dog.

797
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,799
This is strange.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

798
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,883
This is meant to be.

799
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,510
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

800
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,054
This is all part of the plan.

801
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:53,183
My gym's closed, so I have not done

802
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,229
this much exercise in a long time.

803
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,233
(people chattering)

804
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,026
What is that? What is that?

805
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:03,862
(group chattering)

806
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,696
What is this?

807
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,530
[Irene] We found something,

808
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,364
we found something!

809
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,156
It's an onk.

810
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:07,991
[Irene] An onk, the key of life,

811
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,908
the key of life, right?

812
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:09,909
Yeah.

813
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,245
- [Irene] Yes, let's go.
- Wait, who did this?

814
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,664
You know I'm Egyptian

815
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,039
and you're putting all of this.

816
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,374
[Male] No, no, no, no, understand.

817
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,168
- Who did this?
- You found that

818
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,547
because your energy
brought you to this place.

819
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,716
This is not something planted,

820
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,342
like this is yours.

821
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,177
That is for you.

822
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:31,096
[Nadia] Guys, the god is speaking to us.

823
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,056
- [Male] What does it say?
- We're on the right path,

824
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,391
it's the key to life.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

825
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,018
Yes, we are. (chuckles)

826
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,477
Here, get a close up.

827
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,021
I'm so excited. (chuckles)
(eerie sound effects)

828
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,939
(people chattering)
- Oh my God,

829
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,649
you guys are coming, right?

830
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,527
(people chattering)

831
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,530
What do we think? I'm not so sure.

832
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,365
(upbeat music)

833
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,116
I'm not so sure, girls.

834
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,619
(people chattering)

835
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,162
But I'm along for the ride

836
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,080
because where the (beep) am I gonna go?

837
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:57,916
(upbeat music)

838
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,750
I'm happy for her

839
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,293
'cause we've got some information that-

840
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,420
- 3,000.
- A clue that

841
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,213
we're getting closer.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

842
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,425
I think, this is real good.

843
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,928
I'm like, man, inspired now

844
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,971
that she found something.

845
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,306
This is nice.

846
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,183
[Male] Doesn't the art inspire you guys?

847
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,061
Yeah, it does, and it has

848
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:23,857
so much cultural relevance here.

849
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,817
[Male] Wow.

850
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:28,237
It looks like really nice. Oh, yeah.

851
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,822
(people chattering)
- We found something.

852
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:34,077
We found something. We found something.

853
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,038
(people chattering)

854
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,164
It's a nubis.

855
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,125
(people chattering)
- I don't understand.

856
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,335
It's kinda cute.

857
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,336
[Male] Somebody lost their little dog.

858
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,379
[Alia] Yeah.

859
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,297
(people chattering)

860
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,798
[Debrah] What does she say?

861
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,675
A nubis is associated with death.

862
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,426
[Debrah] Oh, death?

863
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,678
[Alia] I dunno.

864
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,845
[Debrah] Oh, wow.

865
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,890
[Alia] That's what she said.

866
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,394
(eerie music)

867
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,115
(eerie sound effects)

868
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:17,369
(screams) Death comes like dawn.

869
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,913
(eerie sound effects)

870
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:23,960
And you wake up laughing
at what you thought

871
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,170
was your grief.

872
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,215
How the (beep) do you die,

873
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,426
and then wake up laughing?

874
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,802
That's what the (beep)
I'm trying to figure out.

875
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,054
Guys, I'm leaving.

876
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,140
You need to come with me.

877
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,474
We've gotta get out quick.

878
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,892
What?
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

879
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,687
[Nadia] We've gotta get out quick.

880
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,272
[Chaz] Guys, guys?
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

881
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,898
[Debrah] Well, I'm gonna go.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

882
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,734
- [Man] No.
- I'm gonna

883
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,402
just make sure she's okay.

884
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,988
One of the members just ran off.

885
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,033
She found an onk, a DJ onk or something.

886
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,370
And then, she found a
little taco bell dog,

887
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,539
a little chihuahua and she got scared.

888
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,374
Talking about somethings

889
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,083
was about to happen with death

890
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,878
and laughing in your dreams.

891
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,838
I don't know, man,

892
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,050
but these members is acting real weird.

893
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,259
I'm chilling.

894
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,719
[Chaz] I'm down.

895
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,554
- We out here.
- It's all good.

896
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,388
We all good.

897
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,306
- [Chaz] Listen guys-
- Right?

898
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,308
[Chaz] This is what this is all about.

899
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,185
They always try to send

900
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,352
the light skinned people

901
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,774
to do the bullshit.
- This is a part

902
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,275
of the whole thing.

903
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,820
You can't be afraid, okay?

904
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,197
Are y'all with me?

905
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,656
I'm with you.

906
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,950
We shall continue, yes?

907
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,660
Yes, sir.

908
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:44,207
I don't know what happened to Nadia.

909
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,959
I'm getting concerned now because

910
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,504
this is just too much, and we out here

911
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,006
in these woods and everything,

912
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,133
and she done disappear.

913
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,469
I'm worried about her.

914
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,264
Obviously, I'm doing great,

915
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,017
unphased by everything.

916
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,894
I think, it's really bizarre

917
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,439
and I think, everyone besides Granny

918
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,274
and I should be

919
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,109
a little bit more concerned about it.

920
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,487
I just don't know where she went.

921
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,241
Suddenly, just like me and Granny

922
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,118
are really alarmed.

923
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,244
I genuinely don't know what's happening

924
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,829
and it just sucks.

925
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,705
(birds chirping)

926
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:25,831
And I feel like the guys,

927
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,374
the other guys don't care.

928
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,709
It's just like, why don't you care

929
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,213
about where our camper, Nadia went?

930
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,214
- Yo, yo.
- Hey!

931
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,174
[Rob] (mumbles) what up, dog?

932
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,093
- Pose.
- This is crazy, right?

933
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,553
[Wai] Pose, strike a pose.

934
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,139
Uh-huh, can we have a silent moment here

935
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,518
'cause the thirst is real.

936
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,562
(people chattering)

937
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,188
[Alia] Black Lives Matter.

938
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,023
(birds chirping)

939
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,525
You can see that all this graffiti here

940
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,194
is graffiti covering graffiti that used

941
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,696
to be behind.

942
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,614
You can see the paints got covered over.

943
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,324
You can't see what the other artist did,

944
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,994
they covered it up, man, how respectful.

945
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:08,582
Oh my God, you guys, oh my God,

946
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,209
it's Nadia's phone.

947
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:19,177
The witch. (laughing menacingly)

948
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,267
I have to go to the bathroom,

949
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,145
are you okay alone?

950
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,440
I'm looking at the art.
I'm fine by myself.

951
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,358
Okay, great.

952
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,527
Okay, I'll be back soon. Okay.

953
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,037
She just disappeared into thin air

954
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,456
and I just don't understand how in

955
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,209
the world she could have just disappeared

956
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,878
just, and just vanished.

957
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,379
She can't just be gone.

958
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,340
(people chattering)

959
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,633
It makes no sense. Like it makes no sense.

960
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,551
She's just not here.

961
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,053
And I'm getting honestly,

962
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,639
a really weird feeling about it too.

963
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,807
(sighs) And it's just day one,

964
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,726
so I have to get a grip

965
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,437
because there's five more days, so.

966
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,358
(soft flute music)

967
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,183
(door knocking)

968
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,726
(male mumbling)

969
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,355
(door knocking)

970
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:59,609
[Debrah] Even disappear,
I'm worried about her.

971
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,029
[Alia] Obviously, I'm doing great.

972
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,948
I'm chased by everything.

973
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,491
No, Nadia's already gone.

974
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,202
Can you back up a little more?

975
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,453
Got it.

976
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa, can
you bring that one up?

977
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,335
(eerie music)

978
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,255
[Nadia] Did you just see that?

979
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,090
[Irene] See what?

980
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,591
[Nadia] The dog.

981
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,303
This place is a dream only

982
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,764
a sleeper considers it real.

983
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:34,477
But it was your thought,
it was your grief.

984
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,354
We've gotta get out quick.

985
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,689
[Rob] How the (beep) do you die,

986
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,441
then wake up laughing?

987
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,900
(mumbles) I'm trying to figure out.

988
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,820
- What's that behind there?
- Guys, I'm leaving.

989
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,240
(eerie sound effects)

990
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,034
(Nadia screaming)

991
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,870
Death comes like dawn.

992
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,789
You can't be afraid.

993
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,666
(bell beeps)

994
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,252
Open this goddam door for me.

995
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,797
(John laughing)

996
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,051
(door knocking)

997
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:10,055
Hey, hey. Hey, come on.

998
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,558
Open the door, you dip-shits.

999
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,688
Uh, what's with the suits, huh?

1000
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,857
[Male] Well, (indistinct) although,

1001
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,400
it's an honor to once
again be in your presence,

1002
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,943
I'm afraid your travels have been for not.

1003
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,695
We had everything here well-

1004
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,073
Now, listen, listen, listen.

1005
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,741
When you speak, you're only repeating

1006
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,494
what you think you already know,

1007
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,205
but if you are silent,

1008
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,751
you just might learn something new, okay?

1009
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,545
Good, now, Granny Love

1010
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,089
the Ecajutty is safe.

1011
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,968
No, now she is safe.

1012
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:53,973
I have sent our goddess to
begin training with her sisters.

1013
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,977
This place is not safe.

1014
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,524
(Eastern music)

1015
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,567
Look gentlemen, you must understand

1016
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,570
that we, the Durga, must combine

1017
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,115
the power of thunder with the strength

1018
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,867
of diamond to defeat our foe, the Gin.

1019
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:16,329
You must remain vigilant, you dip-shits.

1020
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,706
These damn spirits who serve

1021
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:21,876
your god can take any form, travel swiftly

1022
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,711
on the wind, and possess the minds

1023
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,839
of the innocent and ignorant in order

1024
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,136
to command them to do
acts of unspeakable evil.

1025
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:35,265
Yes, usually their actions are relegated

1026
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,933
to juvenile pranks, but it appears

1027
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,268
this son of a has developed

1028
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,396
a taste for murder and suicide.

1029
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,066
(Eastern music)

1030
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,694
(laughs) Oh, God.

1031
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,614
(Eastern music)

1032
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,741
It appears that one who's been touched by

1033
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:57,288
this evil is in our midst.

1034
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,708
He must be confronted.

1035
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,294
With all due respect, Zel,

1036
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,378
the little one, Toshman,

1037
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,338
we believe him to be pure of heart

1038
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,798
and worthy of our mercy.

1039
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,341
He is to join our ranks.

1040
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,426
I have summoned the bull

1041
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,553
to administer his cleansing.

1042
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,472
(Eastern music)

1043
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:19,435
But it appears the real problem, (laughs)

1044
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,520
Which both of you have lost sight of,

1045
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,773
(laughs) oh God, is him.

1046
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:29,068
(Eastern music)

1047
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:33,782
Surprised? (laughs) Pathetic.

1048
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,036
[Irene] Wait, wait, you guys, wait.

1049
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,163
You guys, that's the Schultz family.

1050
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:40,998
(horn honking)

1051
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:41,874
Hey, what's up?

1052
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,708
We're the Schultz, I'm Mike.

1053
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,542
I'm Christina.

1054
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,376
And I'm Tyler.

1055
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,002
I prank my parents all the time.

1056
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,003
And it sucks sorta.

1057
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,004
It sucks a lot.

1058
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,047
Most of the time it sucks.

1059
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,715
Most of the time, yeah.

1060
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,550
- For us.
- I mean,

1061
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,384
we make money off of it, so.

1062
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,093
And we don't have to
give him an allowance.

1063
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:54,970
I give you an allowance.

1064
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,596
Yeah, it's great.

1065
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,639
(Tyler gargling)
(Mike laughing)

1066
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,723
[Irene] I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry,

1067
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,267
aren't you guys the Schultz family?

1068
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,102
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1069
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:02,937
[Irene] I'm like a huge, big...

1070
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,145
Tyler, right?
- Yeah.

1071
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,147
[Irene] Oh, my gosh, I'm Irene Rushing,

1072
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,400
I'm very new, but I'm a huge fan.

1073
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,277
- Yeah.
- And your dad's hilarious.

1074
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,737
- Love your videos.
- Oh my God.

1075
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,864
[Irene] (laughs) Oh, my God and hi.

1076
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,990
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1077
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,283
Hey.
- Oh, yeah,

1078
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,244
this is-
- I can't believe.

1079
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,078
- Hey.
- What's your name?

1080
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,620
My name is Tyler Schultz,

1081
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,580
and I'm a prankster and
a gamer on the side.

1082
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,415
I made a Grinder account for my dad.

1083
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,667
He's not gay.

1084
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,502
The people on the app,
they keep calling him.

1085
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,920
He's a bear. (chuckles)

1086
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,338
I popped open the caps of all

1087
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,839
of his beers and I poured them out

1088
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,466
into the sink and replaced it

1089
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,842
with non-alcoholic beer

1090
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,094
and put 'em back in the same spot.

1091
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,345
So, he's gonna have no idea.

1092
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,639
I sold my dad's car on eBay.

1093
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,641
(laughs) I want them to be stressed out.

1094
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,393
Okay, Tyler, all right.

1095
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,852
How you doing-
- Hi, I'm his mom.

1096
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,688
I'm Christine.
- (laughs) That's good, nice

1097
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,022
to meet you.
- Nice to meet

1098
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,023
you too, Granny.

1099
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:49,942
Nice to meet you all.

1100
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:51,401
I don't know them. (chuckles)

1101
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,902
I don't know them. (laughs)

1102
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,987
I don't know them.

1103
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,031
Okay, you fanned out.
- I love Tyler Schultz.

1104
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,449
I will be the first to say it

1105
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,368
and not the last.

1106
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,952
That boy is hilarious.

1107
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,037
Excuse me, what about me? Thank you.

1108
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,163
Sis.

1109
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,623
(Wai laughing)

1110
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,625
[Chaz] Yo, yo, what's
up, Schultz family?

1111
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,544
Yo, the prankster.

1112
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,671
Yo, you guys are sick.

1113
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,797
Oh yeah, RIP COVID.

1114
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,215
COVID, uh.
- COVID.

1115
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,758
[Chaz] Hey man, got
some great news, man.

1116
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,343
If you can handle it,

1117
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,012
we just had a spot open up in the camp.

1118
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,513
For real?

1119
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,473
[Chaz] Yo, it just opened up, man.

1120
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,766
Only thing, it's 500 bucks a person

1121
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,268
and the spot is yours.

1122
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,353
Okay, listen, if we do
this, it's no new drone.

1123
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,564
Yeah, you can't have both, hun.

1124
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,690
I need a new drone.

1125
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,317
[Mike] Your choice
right now, camp, or drone.

1126
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,401
[Rob] You wanna be flying a drone,

1127
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,569
or flying with the stars, man?

1128
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,070
Make up your mind, kid.
- This is a once

1129
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:36,905
in a lifetime opportunity, kid.

1130
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,490
I guess, if they really
need us, then we can.

1131
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,326
(Christine laughing)
- It's ridiculous.

1132
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,201
No, okay, we're in.

1133
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,494
Can we PayPal you, or something, or-

1134
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,746
[Rob] Yeah, yeah, you Venmo, Cash App.

1135
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,913
- Honey, can you set that up?
- Yeah, yeah, no problem-

1136
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:46,749
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1137
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,499
[Chaz] Oh, you got
the Schultz family here.

1138
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500
What's up, man?

1139
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,336
[Man] Yeah, man, hey.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1140
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,170
Thank you so much, it's an honor,

1141
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,004
it's a pleasure.

1142
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:53,504
[Rob] Great news, fellas.

1143
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,298
What?

1144
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,132
[Rob] They're gonna join the camp, man.

1145
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:55,966
Oh, that's crazy.

1146
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,008
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

1147
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:57,843
Good, guys, come on guys.

1148
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,218
We'll just be back here.

1149
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,261
[Christine] Yeah, you good to go.

1150
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,596
Everything, so you see everything.

1151
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,056
[Rob] Yeah, they paid.

1152
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:03,891
They paid everything, yeah.

1153
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,850
(eerie music)

1154
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,684
(male mumbling)

1155
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,518
Yeah, 100 a piece.

1156
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,935
(eerie sound effects)

1157
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,103
Yeah.
- Yeah, you know

1158
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:09,938
what I mean?

1159
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:10,980
Well, we already had the
fee from the other ones,

1160
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:11,815
so you know what I mean?

1161
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,107
It was like, it's all extra.

1162
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,275
You know what I'm saying?

1163
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,610
(people chattering)

1164
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,737
♪ I'm a hustler baby babe ♪

1165
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,614
[Mike] Hey, guys.

1166
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:19,656
Hi.

1167
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,532
[Mike] Coming with you.

1168
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,451
I'm sorry?

1169
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:23,618
[Mike] We gonna come with you guys.

1170
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,952
- Okay.
- Oh.

1171
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,163
Hi, oh, yay!

1172
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,707
- [Mike] Thanks.
- Hey.

1173
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,376
[Christine] Do you know what's going on?

1174
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,461
(people chattering)

1175
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,296
I don't know them.

1176
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,757
All right, (indistinct) oh guys,

1177
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:41,594
look that was (indistinct) a little bit.

1178
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,970
A little bit scary,

1179
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,847
but do not be discouraged,
ladies and gentlemen.

1180
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,766
We left, Nadia left.

1181
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,142
She experienced something,

1182
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,103
which honestly I hope all you guys

1183
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,063
have that same kind of experience.

1184
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,523
And I just hope that you react

1185
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,400
a little bit different.

1186
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,483
Do not be scared.

1187
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,318
This is why you're here, right?

1188
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,778
- Right.
- Yeah.

1189
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,154
We're here to get into...

1190
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,157
And when one door closes,
another one opens.

1191
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,326
We have another family
joining us right now.

1192
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,369
- Woo!
- Make a noise

1193
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,704
for the new family.

1194
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,248
(group cheering and clapping)
Yeah.

1195
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,874
And I'm really excited about...

1196
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,960
I'm excited for you guys.

1197
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,503
I am really excited (chuckles)

1198
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,587
To see who's next.

1199
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,506
[Male] Who's next?

1200
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:18,631
[Man] Who ready to go?

1201
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,466
Granny ready to go.

1202
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:20,842
- [Group] Uh!
- Granny.

1203
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,844
All right, all right.
(group cheering and clapping)

1204
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,595
(people chattering)

1205
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,763
I don't talk about that, I know.

1206
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:26,889
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1207
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,725
I'm trying to get that,
(Irene laughing)

1208
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,517
I'm trying to get there.

1209
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,351
- [Chaz] Okay-
- Okay, how far did

1210
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,476
you wanna set your (mumbles)?

1211
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,437
[Debrah] That is real close.

1212
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,313
50 meters.

1213
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,106
50 meters, okay.

1214
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:35,941
Ooh.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1215
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,608
You at 50 meters.

1216
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,027
There you go. Here you go.

1217
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:40,904
Right now, it's all set,

1218
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,197
but before we move, I need you

1219
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,615
to focus on your objective.

1220
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,201
I need you to really think, right?

1221
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,911
Really put some focus on it

1222
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:49,747
and when you're ready,

1223
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,582
I want you to announce it to the group.

1224
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,460
When you're ready, though.

1225
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,756
(eerie sound effects)

1226
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,050
My objective is knowledge.

1227
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,261
I wanna be able to influence

1228
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,680
this younger generation and let

1229
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,140
'em know about my-

1230
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,017
(eerie sound effects)

1231
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:11,059
[Male] Ooh, oh wow.

1232
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,395
(crowd chattering and clapping)

1233
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,980
[Man] Right on-
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1234
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:16,815
We talking about old school.

1235
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,232
Amen to that, amen to that.

1236
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,067
[Chaz] Let that map lead you

1237
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,068
to your destination you going.

1238
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:21,862
Okay.

1239
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,656
[Irene] Let's go, I'm excited.

1240
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,741
Here we go.

1241
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,826
Let's follow her.

1242
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,912
Right here.

1243
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,789
What the...

1244
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,958
How can I gain some knowledge right here

1245
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,462
in the middle of all of
this trash and stuff.

1246
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,131
Let me look at this.

1247
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,884
Now, when I came here,

1248
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,136
I thought it was gonna be

1249
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,972
some kinda special monument,

1250
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,016
or something that I can be proud of.

1251
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,684
- Granny's losing it.
- And I just see

1252
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,478
a whole bunch of junk and garbage.

1253
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,313
Just the stress-

1254
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,022
This is getting intense right now.

1255
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,732
I don't even...
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1256
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:00,567
See in my generation-

1257
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,401
It's getting so intense.

1258
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,902
We have respect for something like this.

1259
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:07,031
This is some of our
ancestors brought us here

1260
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:10,911
and this is the legacy. (cries softly)

1261
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,168
(male mumbling)

1262
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,756
I got you.

1263
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,550
[Alia] We need it cleaned up.

1264
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,343
Oh, I can't get it either.

1265
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,636
[Alia] I can't even look at this.

1266
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,472
How can you clean
spray paint with Windex?

1267
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,473
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1268
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,724
[Alia] No, you're good.

1269
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:34,934
- Thank you for opening it.
- Of course.

1270
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,894
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1271
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,146
Love their scraping here.

1272
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:41,441
Oh, that's great.

1273
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:44,653
That's what I'm talking
about right there.

1274
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:46,737
[Irene] Thanks, Malik.

1275
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,781
Well, I was so proud of you guys.

1276
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,074
You did such a great job and-

1277
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,243
[Male] I'm watching them touch.

1278
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,744
[Toshman] Uh, oh.

1279
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,997
[Zel] (laughs) Oh, it is

1280
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,249
a joyous occasion, my friend.

1281
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,251
- Joyous.
- Joyous.

1282
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,671
(sighs) You know, it's not very often

1283
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,506
that we are blessed

1284
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:10,344
with such great, (chuckles) great fortune.

1285
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,722
(laughs) Yes.

1286
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,056
[Toshman] Look man, look, look, look,

1287
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:14,892
if y'all gonna kill me.

1288
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:16,058
- No, no.
- Just go ahead

1289
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:16,894
and kill me, man.

1290
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,102
No, no, no, no, no, no, kill you, no!

1291
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:21,106
No, no, far from it.

1292
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:23,901
Here, where is...

1293
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:25,693
Oh yes, now here. Just taste-

1294
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,278
- [Toshman] No.
- No, no, no, no.

1295
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,529
Yeah, you just taste a little of that.

1296
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,281
So, oh gosh, I think you're gonna like

1297
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,116
this very much.

1298
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:31,950
There you go.

1299
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,659
Ooh, swallow, swallow,
swallow, swallow, swallow.

1300
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,204
(Toshman groaning)
Oh, it is with great humility

1301
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,456
and honor-
- Humility.

1302
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,042
- Honor!
- All right, that's enough.

1303
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,252
Cut the shit, all right?

1304
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,296
Be here, all right?

1305
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:49,050
Yes, it is with great humility and honor,

1306
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,887
we begin the sacred cleansing, commencing

1307
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:57,433
with the ancient ceremonial joining

1308
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,895
of your spirit with those of all

1309
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,648
the warrior monks, who
have come before you.

1310
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,816
(chuckles) Mm?

1311
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,444
Oh, I don't want my
spirit joining with y'all.

1312
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,029
I don't know, don't wanna join 'em.

1313
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,406
Yeah, listen to me, it's not up to you.

1314
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,617
I mean, you think anybody
chooses this life?

1315
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,410
Ah, God bless us.

1316
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:19,705
You know, nature is often credited

1317
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,959
as our true mother, but we believe

1318
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,712
an ancient goddess has given us life, huh?

1319
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:31,509
A beautiful fertile,
ferocious wrathful force.

1320
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,928
She is called the Ecajutty.

1321
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,514
- Praise the Ecajutty.
- Praise the Ecajutty,

1322
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,474
yes, praise the Ecajutty.

1323
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:43,230
And we, the Durga, are
sworn to protect her.

1324
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,316
Throughout time, she is reincarnated

1325
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,610
when her careless children fall

1326
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,487
from her eye forgetting all that

1327
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,572
she's taught them.

1328
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,575
But miraculously, she's come again.

1329
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:57,411
(Toshman chuckles)

1330
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:00,287
We have identified her spirit in one

1331
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,623
of your video makers.

1332
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,543
She is called Deborah.

1333
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,629
(eerie music)

1334
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,880
You're talking about Granny?

1335
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,842
Granny, yes. Yes.

1336
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,677
Granny?

1337
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,594
Yes, Granny.

1338
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,054
Holy fuck!

1339
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,598
Yes, holy fuck indeed, yes. (laughs)

1340
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,604
Oh, guess what? The bull is here.

1341
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,066
(Zel laughing)

1342
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,530
(eerie music)

1343
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,002
(male mumbling)

1344
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,345
Oh, did I miss the hat part?

1345
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,724
Yeah, well we can do
it again if you'd like.

1346
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,559
Is this him?

1347
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,685
(eerie music)

1348
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,270
Yes.

1349
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,898
[The Bull] He's so little.

1350
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,401
[Zel] Oh, (mumbles) we never question

1351
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,988
the mother, mm-hmm, no, no, no.

1352
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,032
I will leave you to it, all right?

1353
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,116
Let's go, just go.
- Hey, where...

1354
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,368
Where y'all going?

1355
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,871
Who you supposed to be?

1356
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,334
I am the bull, this is your cleansing.

1357
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,377
Oh, okay.

1358
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,713
At some point you may feel

1359
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,799
like you're gonna die,

1360
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,552
but no one ever does. (laughs)

1361
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,263
[Christine] Come on
tubby, let's step it up.

1362
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,348
(Tyler laughing)

1363
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,183
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1364
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:44,266
Did she just call her husband tubby?

1365
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,102
Tubby. (laughs)

1366
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:45,936
- Thanks so much-
- She got him

1367
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:46,770
with the fat jokes. (laughs)

1368
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:49,563
I think, I sense the
classic family argument.

1369
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,732
[Mike] Yo, when I
walk, it's lifting stuff.

1370
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,651
I'm doing a lot of work just by walking.

1371
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,819
Just gimme a little bit of a break.

1372
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,403
Can we have that?

1373
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,571
[Christine] Well, maybe if you walked

1374
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,281
a little more, it
wouldn't be so difficult.

1375
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,325
[Chaz] This is great content, go,

1376
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,952
keep recording this.
- How difficult it is to-

1377
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,161
Girl, I'm gonna-

1378
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,246
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1379
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,705
It's been a while since
the last one of these,

1380
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,207
this is exciting.
- I can't imagine

1381
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,500
it's anything-
- Can I hang out

1382
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,335
with these trees.

1383
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,795
I think, I'm not even here.

1384
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,797
[Mike] Now you're sorry, 1,500 bucks

1385
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,632
and now you're sorry.

1386
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:19,677
Why in public do you
always need to do this?

1387
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,512
(eerie sound effects)

1388
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:21,637
Are we ever anywhere else?

1389
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,139
Our whole life is public now.

1390
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,265
When he looks at me, all I see

1391
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,933
is that venom in your
face, it's disgusting.

1392
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,935
[Christine] Do not
start with that again.

1393
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,813
Uh, the drama.

1394
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:31,897
[Christine] Stop it.

1395
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,399
What are you gonna do?

1396
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,359
What does it matter
(eerie sound effects)

1397
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,818
If you're always protecting him?

1398
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,444
How's he gonna grow up?
- I'm gonna just...

1399
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,737
I'm gonna take...

1400
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,656
See, they need Granny in their life.

1401
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,033
(eerie sound effects)

1402
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,285
[Chaz] Granny, you okay?

1403
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,286
- Oh.
- Oh my God.

1404
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,287
You all right?

1405
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,288
- Yeah.
- You okay?

1406
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,330
- I'm okay, I'm...
- You good?

1407
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,498
- Are you all right?
- You good?

1408
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,333
Yeah, I'm okay.

1409
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,168
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1410
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:52,585
- No, no, no-
- What happened?

1411
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,879
No, I just need to
(indistinct) the whole team.

1412
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,880
No, I think, you need-

1413
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:56,840
- Are you sure?
- Let's go to the hospital.

1414
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:57,923
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1415
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,675
[Alia] Yeah, her phone
just caught on fire.

1416
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,843
It fully explode...

1417
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,678
Oh.
- You look like

1418
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,512
you might be burned.

1419
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:05,639
I just need to go to the hospital.

1420
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,267
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1421
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,353
(people chattering)

1422
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,272
Hey, bud.

1423
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,106
[Tyler] Hey.

1424
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,065
Can we talk a little bit.

1425
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,025
I just want to go back to the hotel.

1426
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:16,026
Can we just go back to the hotel?

1427
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:18,027
[Irene] You know, I
think you're right, Wai.

1428
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,070
I think I'm done.

1429
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,405
It's time, I'm done-

1430
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,032
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)
- Stop, stop, stop.

1431
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,034
Stop.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1432
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,577
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1433
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,537
That's creepy.
- You literally don't know-

1434
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,747
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1435
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:30,873
Thank you so much.

1436
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,166
[Alia] Okay, we should do

1437
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,293
what we came here to do.
- Oh, who paid a lot

1438
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,128
of money, Alia?
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1439
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:35,962
[Alia] Okay, so what?

1440
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:36,796
I think (indistinct)
paid a lot of money.

1441
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,631
What is that supposed to
me, are you coming for-

1442
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,173
[Male] Cancel her, unsubscribe her

1443
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,382
'cause she doesn't care, bye.

1444
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,259
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1445
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,968
Go to the hotel.
- Bye.

1446
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,053
[Female] This is not a dating app.

1447
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,471
Chaz, listen, Greg-

1448
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,597
[Tyler] Stop, stop, stop.

1449
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,848
Stop, that's not Chaz, stop.

1450
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,100
Shut up. Chaz, listen-

1451
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:50,936
[Tyler] Oh my God.

1452
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:52,311
I'm gonna time, we gonna
take a break too, man.

1453
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,687
[Tyler] Stop, that's not Chaz.

1454
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,522
- Chaz! Chaz!
- Stop.

1455
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:55,898
We just made up

1456
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,066
and you're already being stupid again.

1457
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,234
(indistinct) with Granny.

1458
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:02,279
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1459
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,822
I'm here now, so.

1460
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,076
I mean, listen, I get it.

1461
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:12,248
We're really shitty white people, 100%.

1462
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,415
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1463
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,209
(groaning squealing sound effects)

1464
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,460
Great, great.
(male chuckling)

1465
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,170
Okay, bye.
(groaning sound effects)

1466
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,505
We'll see you later.

1467
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,965
Okay, bye.
(squealing sound effects)

1468
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,216
Oh, you did such a great job-

1469
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,384
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1470
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,219
[Interpreter] Yeah,
I could see it, yeah.

1471
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,970
Thank you, guys.

1472
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,721
Oh, yeah, she's not a good fit.

1473
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,598
White interpreters, you know?

1474
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,601
She seems like she was very sticky.

1475
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,603
[Tyler] What are they saying?

1476
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,064
I don't know sign language.

1477
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,107
It's cool looking, though.

1478
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,859
Yeah, look, it looks pretty cool.

1479
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,319
Man, you right, that guy doesn't look

1480
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,779
anything like Chaz.

1481
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,614
(upbeat music)

1482
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,615
All right, so everyone
listen to me, I won.

1483
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,825
And we're gonna stay out.

1484
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,829
We're gonna do our final
Epifanati's for everyone.

1485
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,207
Chaz left and I really
don't think we need him.

1486
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,042
I kind of got the vibe down, right?

1487
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,127
I got this.

1488
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,296
- I'm next to go, but-
- It literally makes no sense.

1489
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,006
I got something setup-

1490
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,133
[Irene] Alia, I'm done, let's just do-

1491
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,093
[Alia] Download the app.

1492
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:07,303
I am ready. I'm ready to go.

1493
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,470
That's all I'm gonna say.

1494
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,890
I am ready to go. So, I'm going next.

1495
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,684
Here's my phone.

1496
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:17,022
I am setting out the distance.

1497
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,401
Let's do 100, 100 meters.

1498
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,944
(eerie music)

1499
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,529
And my intention.

1500
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:30,284
My intention is I want
to understand deeper

1501
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,703
into the occult.

1502
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,748
Shall we focus on that? How about that?

1503
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,042
Freaky things is happening anyway.

1504
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,793
Let's go for it.

1505
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,128
Like, is everyone crazy? (chuckles)

1506
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,464
This is like literally so scary.

1507
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,341
I guess, I just have to lean into it.

1508
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,383
Who's scared?

1509
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,676
Are you scared at home?
- Meditate on what

1510
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,178
your objective is.

1511
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,387
I hope you're in a safe spot.

1512
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,805
[Wai] All right, let's see what I find.

1513
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,558
I feel a little like bad vibe.

1514
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,768
(eerie music)

1515
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,480
No, the magician and string.

1516
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,482
Okay, this is freaking me out.

1517
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,985
(eerie music)

1518
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,947
The fool. They are
clearly messing with me.

1519
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,949
They are clearly messing with me.

1520
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,118
So, I'm gonna scare them.

1521
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,372
I'm gonna scare the crap out of them.

1522
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,293
Pay back time. Payback, bitches.

1523
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,837
[Mike] Where did he go?

1524
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,672
[Christine] Yeah, I dunno where he went.

1525
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,508
[Tyler] What? He was just up here.

1526
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:29,719
[Wai] Wa!

1527
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,137
(group screaming)

1528
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,973
Got ya! Got you.
- Oh my God.

1529
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,266
- [Wai] Got you.
- You made me scream.

1530
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,351
- [Wai] Got you.
- Wai, what the hell?

1531
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,435
- [Wai] Got you.
- I was eating.

1532
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,937
[Wai] You all tried to scare me

1533
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,730
with all those cards.

1534
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:45,025
I thought you set them up.
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1535
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,193
Laying all those cards.

1536
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,486
Come on guys, forget them.

1537
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,406
I thought that you guys were scaring me.

1538
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,282
You go ahead.

1539
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,658
Keep going guys, I'll be right with ya.

1540
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,159
[Wai] Well fine, whatever.

1541
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,994
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1542
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,955
Go away, I'm fine by myself.

1543
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,375
I'll get everything done by myself, okay?

1544
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,086
Screw you guys.

1545
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,296
I'll be fine.

1546
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:09,258
I'm gonna, you know...

1547
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,095
I'm gonna keep on journeying on,

1548
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,640
whatever this is leading me.

1549
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,351
[Irene] No, I'm gonna
see what Wai is doing.

1550
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,812
He's fine, he's fine. Fine.

1551
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,315
[Irene] Where is he going?

1552
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,067
(eerie music)

1553
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,987
Is that another card.
- You.

1554
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,739
I think, that's another card.

1555
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,075
[Irene] Where's he going?

1556
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,205
I don't think he knows I'm here.

1557
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:44,126
I'm just gonna wait and see where he goes.

1558
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,254
(eerie music)

1559
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:51,926
(growling and screeching sound effects)

1560
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,472
Wai, help. Oh my God.

1561
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,518
Are you kidding me?

1562
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,938
(eerie music)

1563
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,568
[Rob] Break time,
break, break, break time.

1564
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,237
Break, break, break, break, break,

1565
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,740
bad DJ break time.

1566
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,493
It's officially time for your break.

1567
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:21,872
Take your chances to go
out to the smoking area.

1568
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:26,878
Pop your Hennessy.
(Toshman and Rob laughing)

1569
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:32,466
And get your insults brewing, brewing.

1570
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,550
Do your thing, man.

1571
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,385
No, all right.

1572
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,220
I don't smoke no more.

1573
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:36,512
I'm gonna drink my drink, though.

1574
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,347
- Yeah.
- So, you smoke

1575
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:38,764
your little smoke.

1576
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:39,599
Smoke a little smoke.

1577
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,266
And I'ma drink my little drink.

1578
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,101
♪ And I'ma take off my mask ♪

1579
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,227
Now, you need to do that

1580
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,354
if you're going partake
in these activities.

1581
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,606
Amen. What you think...

1582
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,442
What you think about all these campers?

1583
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,530
They cool or whatever,

1584
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,030
but know what I mean, but...

1585
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,406
I ain't gonna lie,

1586
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:59,326
what was her name, Shadia, Nadia?

1587
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,786
Yeah, Nadia did the...

1588
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,954
- I feel-
- The sun god worshiper.

1589
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,121
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1590
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,290
I felt some way when she left, you know?

1591
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:08,252
I felt we had a thing going on ever since

1592
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,963
the audition tape, ever since when I seen

1593
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,798
the audition tape, I knew.

1594
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:13,799
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1595
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,217
Oh, so that's why
you was pulling so hard

1596
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,927
for her to be here, 'cause you was-

1597
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,054
Yes, did you see how she said,

1598
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:22,140
"I'm gonna make sure you don't regret

1599
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,642
you picked me", type of-

1600
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,477
(Rob laughing)

1601
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,144
I was like, I felt like she was talking

1602

This is a $90,000 car, don't knock

01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:48,727
Don't knock on my window, bro.

What do you need?

1662
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,563
Why don't you shut the car off, Sir?

1663
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,398

1664
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,316

1666
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,400

Keep your hands where I can see them.

1670
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,616
My hands are right

1671
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:03,825
[Officer] Then what are you doing here?

1672
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,118
I was trying to drive.

1673
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,286
That's what I was trying to do, you like-

1674
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,080
Do I smell drugs in this car, sir?

1675
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,707
- [Debrah] Ah, what?
- There's no drugs.

1676
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,834
Is there drug paraphernalia

01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,378
There's no drug paraphernalia in here.

1678

01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:18,966
[Policeman] Do you have

1682
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:19,801

- What is this?

1683
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:21,343
[Male] Yo, what kind

[Male] Yo, yo, yo, what

01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,394
[Debrah] I'm not

1692
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,228
I don't... No!

1693
01:01:30,229 --> 01:01:31,687

1694
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,480
- Come with me.
- No, no, no, no.

1695
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,648
It's dark, it's-

1696
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,483
No.

1697
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:36,817
(laughs) Can you believe this?

1698
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,902
This is really, really crazy, yeah.

(crickets stridulating)

1700
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,489
I mean, we're here.

1701
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:42,614
We might as well have
been waiting all day.

1702
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,158
We might as well go ahead and start.

1703
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,369
You look scared, what's wrong?

1704
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:51,374
(crickets stridulating)

1705
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:57,087
What? what do you mean
you can't do this anymore?

1706
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,881
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1707
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:00,800
What do you mean you
can't do this anymore?

1708
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,301
We've been here all day, you waited.

1709
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,095
You got selected for this moment.

1710
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,932
You don't want to? Well, I mean...

1711
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,228
(male groaning)

1712
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:14,856
Oh, come on.

1713
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,986
I mean, well just, I mean,

1714
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,487
I don't wanna interpret it for you.

1715
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,822
Just go back and tell that you're scare.

1716
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,240
You've been here with them all day.

1717
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,409
Tell them you scared.

1718
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,618
(crickets stridulating)

1719
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,912
Yeah, go tell them. Go tell them.

1720
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,081
Yeah, go, go tell them.

1721

(eerie music)

1722
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,444
(male screaming)

1723
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:05,156
(suspense music)

1724
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,792
I don't know, their lights just went off

1725
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,335
and I don't care, I'm going.

1726
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,419
Look, calm down.

1727
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,755
I'm calm, Tyler, okay?

1728
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,341
The distance is 50 meters.

1729
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:25,301
[Tyler] No stop.

1730
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,219
[Alia] There must be vampires.

1731
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,053
[Tyler] Stop.

1732
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:27,887
Vampires, try to catch me.

1733
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:28,721
Oh, I got him.

1734
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:29,639
[Tyler] No, stop, that's not funny.

1735
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,183
Let's go. I'm going, try to catch me.

1736
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,226
Try to catch me.

1737
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,813
(crickets stridulating)

1738
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:38,689
[Tyler] Alia?

1739
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,898
(Alia screaming)

1740
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:42,150
Oh, shit.
(Alia screaming)

1741
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:46,112
(eerie sound effects)

1742
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,405
Dad?

1743
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,032
(eerie sound effects)

1744
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,325
Dad, dad.

1745
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,868
(app beeping)

1746
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:52,703
(Christine gasping)

1747
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:55,455
(people shouting)
- Get in the car now!

1748
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:57,415
- Oh, oh.
- Get in the car, go.

1749
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,584
- [Debrah] Oh.
- Get in the car!

1750
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:00,419
- [Male] Go, go, go.
- Let's go, let's go.

1751
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,461
Bro, drive, let's go.

1752
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:04,756
Let's go, let's go.
(car tires screeching)

1753
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:08,343
(car engine whirring)

1754
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,554
(somber music)

1755
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:14,349
[Zel] Yes, now, this
is to be a simple right,

1756
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:19,062
but it's not without its perils. (laughs)

1757
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,773
Yes, whereas, the Catholics wait

1758
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:25,277
for possession before removing a spirit

1759
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,571
from the unwilling host.

1760
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:31,116
Yes, (chuckles) we are protected.

1761
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,870
We have the tools to drive

1762
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,456
the evil Gin away before it takes hold.

1763
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,960
Now, would you hand me
that brass bell, please?

1764
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,045
(bell ringing)

1765
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,756
Eh, no (chuckles) the big one.

1766
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,968
(bell ringing)
Oh my God.

1767
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:54,806
Thank you. (chuckles)

1768
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,182
He's pathetic, isn't he?

1769
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:59,019
All right, now, what's going on there?

1770
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:02,480
(laughs) Where are my glasses? I can't...

1771
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:03,316
- Yeah.
- What?

1772
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,150
Yes.

1773
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,026
What? Oh!

1774
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:06,651
Come on, that's why they're so small,

1775
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:08,778
you don't see them anywhere, gone forever.

1776
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:09,821
(Zel mumbling)

1777
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:12,324
All right. Uh-oh, what's going on there?

1778
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,159
What is he...

1779
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,620
I'd like to hear what he's
saying, would that be-

1780
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,663
(crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1781
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:19,540
Yeah, but...

1782
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,166
[Rob] Nah, I'm not mad,

1783
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,293
I'm just disappointed.

1784
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,295
Shit, as soon as I realized
Granny wasn't here,

1785
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,880
I should have been out partying.

1786
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,257
(static buzzing)

1787
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,468
What happened? You've lost the sound.

1788
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,677
I need to hear what he's saying,

1789
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,762
don't you understand?

1790
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,597
I'm trying.

1791
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:37,015
Well, try harder. Come on, come on.

1792
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,600
What's it, what's it?

1793
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,560
[Irene] Okay, I know.

1794
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:42,437
I know why I must have gone somewhere.

1795
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,189
I just don't know where.

1796
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,024
You know what?

1797
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:48,360
You guys, honestly, I
know where I am, okay?

1798
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,945
I'm gonna figure it out.

1799
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:50,987
All right, but I'm gonna take

1800
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:52,656
this mask off now, okay?

1801
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:56,284
'Cause I'm just about done with this mask

1802
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,577
and I have no one around me.

1803
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,080
So, why the fuck not, right?

1804
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,333
(crickets stridulating)

1805
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:07,755
(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

1806
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,137
It's Malik's phone.

1807
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,098
(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

1808
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,349
I'll just give Malik his phone back

1809
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,725
when I see him.

1810
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:21,560
(crickets stridulating)

1811
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,228
And I know I'll come across someone soon.

1812
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,730
It'll be fine. What?

1813
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:30,820
(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

1814
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,866
(Irene crying)

1815
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,619
Where are they? Where are they?

1816
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:44,041
(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

1817
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,004
Oh my God, oh my God. (crying)

1818
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,422
Oh my God.

1819
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,257
(crickets stridulating)

1820
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,884
Oh my God. (crying)

1821
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:58,304
(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

1822
01:06:58,305 --> 01:06:59,723
What you get out for?

1823
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,393
(male mumbling)

1824
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,354
[Chaz] Shit.

1825
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:11,777
Oh my goodness. (inhaling
and exhaling loudly)

1826
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,280
I don't know where they going.

1827
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:16,364
Oh, no! I don't...

1828
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,241
Uh-uh, I don't...

1829
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,909
Uh-uh, no.
- You fine, Granny.

1830
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:20,910
[Debrah] No, no, no!

1831
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,495
No, no, no, no!

1832
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:25,666
(eerie sound effects)

1833
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:29,170
Rob? Rob!

1834
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,213
(eerie sound effects)

1835
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,132
[Christine] Ty? Tyler!

1836
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,635
(eerie music)

1837
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:40,972
Ty, Tyler! (crying)

1838
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:45,268
Oh my God.
(Christine crying)

1839
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,811
Yeah, check his pulse.

1840
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:47,979
Check his pulse!

1841
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,648
(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

1842
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:53,485
(eerie music)
(male shouting indistinctly)

1843
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,528
Help! Bra, come on, man, get

1844
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:56,529
that phone outta here.

1845
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,364
[Rob] Man, Chaz said record everything.

1846
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,824
Man, yo, man, it's
not even content, man.

1847
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:00,785
(eerie music)

1848
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:01,868
- No.
- Uh!

1849
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:03,912
Fuck it.
(eerie sound effects)

1850
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,163
[Chaz] Who are you calling,

1851
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,206
the fucking Ghostbusters?

1852
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,041
Oh my God, oh my God,

1853
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:08,876
oh my God.
- Damn, man.

1854
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:09,710
Oh my God, Ms. Schultz, Ms. Schultz.

1855
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:11,670
Ms. Schultz?

1856
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,633
(eerie sound effects)

1857
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,594
(Irene crying)

1858
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,471
(eerie music)

1859
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,389
Come on Ms. Schultz, we gotta go get help.

1860
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,016
We gotta go get help, come on.

1861
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,726
Ms. Schultz?

1862
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:28,103
(eerie music)

1863
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,270
You all right?

1864
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,441
(eerie sound effects)

1865
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:38,572
Oh, shit.
(eerie music)

1866
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:43,828
(Christine groaning)

1867
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:50,834
(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

1868
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,337
(eerie music)

1869
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:58,843
(Irene inhaling and exhaling loudly)

1870
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:07,100
(Irene screaming)

1871
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,603
(eerie music)

1872
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:15,276
(Irene screaming)

1873
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,278
(male screaming)

1874
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,489
Now, that shit definitely
about to go viral.

1875
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,657
[Male] Freeze!

1876
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:23,868
Hands up, don't shoot.

1877
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,996
Yeah, don't you move.

1878
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:32,417
(somber music)

1879
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,961
I mean, I brought you seven souls.

1880
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,588
Shit, 10 really.

1881
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,256
(somber music)

1882
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:39,799
I forgot I threw

1883
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,759
in that cute little white family.

1884
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,095
I knew they was gonna fall,

1885
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,724
but I'm sitting here chained.

1886
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:50,144
Man, this is some bullshit!

1887
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:53,188
(eerie music)

1888
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:58,194
Huh? Oh, I see.
(eerie sound effects)

1889
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:01,237
So, they brought their leader here?

1890
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:05,534
(laughs) Not too smart.

1891
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:10,371
All right, so what's the plan, boss?

1892
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,875
(eerie music)

1893
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:26,554
Oh, all right, all right.

1894
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,597
We've got to go right away.

1895
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,224
Right away, right away!

1896
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,059
Right away, right, right, right, right,

1897
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:30,893
come on, come on.

1898
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,603
Here, okay, go, go, go, go.

1899
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,438
We don't have much time.

1900
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,609
(eerie sound effects)

1901
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:53,623
What's the bell for?

1902
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,917
(eerie sound effects)

1903
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,211
Smudge stick and feather west.

1904
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,214
(eerie sound effects)

1905
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,258
Don't drop the pair!

1906
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,803
Which direction to the arrow face?

1907
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,890
(eerie music)
- East.

1908
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:17,647
(rattle rattling)

1909
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,775
Here Mother Ecajutty, we call upon you

1910
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,194
to protect this young man's soul.

1911
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:24,362
(eerie music)

1912
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,740
From the jaw of depravity of the Gin.

1913
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:30,244
(eerie music)

1914
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:34,331
- Uh!
- Oh.

1915
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,834
She has abandoned us.

1916
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:41,880
Yes, she has.
(eerie sound effects)

1917
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,468
We have failed.

1918
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:48,971
The Gin has taken him.

1919
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:54,059
It must be executed. Hold him.

1920
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:57,896
- Ugh!
- Ooh!

1921
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:02,442
(Rob laughing)

1922
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,277
A knife.

1923
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:06,279
[Rob] Did you forget something?

1924
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,907
(Rob screaming)

1925
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:18,791
(suspense music)

1926
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:21,878
And always tryna send
the light skinned people

1927
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,838
to do the bullshit.

1928
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:24,798
(suspense music)

1929
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:27,384
(Rob groaning)

1930
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,975
Yeah. Come on, come on.
(tools jingling)

1931
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:37,560
Yeah.
(suspense music)

1932
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,395
Ugh!

1933
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:45,026
Uh! (laughs)

1934
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,780
(suspense music)

1935
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,701
Ya! Where, where is it?

1936
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:55,828
(suspense music)

1937
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:59,957
Oh. (mumbling)

1938
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,919
(eerie music)

1939
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,130
(action music)

1940
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:09,217
(Rob laughing)

1941
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,804
(action music)

1942
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,060
Uh.
(Rob groaning)

1943
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:24,066
Uh.
(blood splashing)

1944
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:28,278
(action music)

1945
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,410
(eerie sound effects)

1946
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:51,468
(action music)

1947
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,846
(Zel crying)

1948
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,433
(action music)

1949
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,781
(eerie music)

1950
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:27,504
(Rob laughing)

1951
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:32,258
(hip hop music)

1952
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,928
No, no! No. (crying)

1953
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:40,934
No, you son of a bitch. No. (crying)

1954
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:44,104
Bring him back, bring him back!

1955
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:50,943
(soft music)

1956
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:54,155
But it was here in these secluded woods

1957
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,575
where those dreams met
a terrifying conclusion.

1958
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:58,784
After just one day

1959
01:14:58,785 --> 01:15:01,120
at the camp, authorities say counselors

1960
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:04,165
and campers met a gruesome end.

1961
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,125
Nine people are dead with one

1962
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:07,543
in critical condition

1963
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,670
and two others still missing.

1964
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,131
Those bodies discovered here and reported

1965
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:14,258
to police by the man at the center

1966
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:17,261
of this story, Chaz
Bruce, who authorities say

1967
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:20,389
was the only to escape without a scratch.

1968
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:23,351
Being hailed as a hero by some, police say

1969
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,936
he is being considered a person

1970
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,437
of interest in this case,

1971
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:29,273
but is yet to officially
be named a suspect.

1972
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:31,275
Meantime, Claktion is moving forward

1973
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:32,652
with its release,

1974
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,987
while its sponsor app, Epifanati,

1975
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:37,114
has ceased all operations.

1976
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:39,075
With no suspects in custody

1977
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,619
and no concrete evidence
discovered just yet

1978
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,204
in this case, authorities say

1979
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,288
they'll be combing through

1980
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:46,332
the videos posted online,

1981
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,793
or broadcast live during that camp

1982
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,920
in hopes of finding any clues

1983
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,463
as to who may be responsible

1984
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,298
for this heinous crime.

1985
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:56,592
