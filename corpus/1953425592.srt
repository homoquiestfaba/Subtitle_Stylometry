Now, it will take some time
for him to stabilize.

00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:53,602
He could still have
some bruising on the cerebellum.

00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,334
Be right back.

187
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:58,068
- [panting]

188
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:00,702
[high-pitched tone]

189
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:20,702
[grunting]

190
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,734
[gasps]

191
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,567
l want to go back
to the apartment.

192
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:47,967
- Okay, all right.
Calm down.

193
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,234
What happened?

194
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:50,900
- l saw something.

195
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:53,902
l don't know.
It couldn't be.

196
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,000
- What did you see?

197
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,335
- A man, a body, falling.

198
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,366
- l don't understand.

199
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,870
- l want to go back now.

200
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
- All right.

201
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,834
Take it easy.

202
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:08,135
We're gonna call Dr. Anand
and make an appointment, okay?

203
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,166
Okay?

204
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,033
Jeff?

205
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,367
- Now, just because
all of our scans are clean

206
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,435
doesn't mean that these episodes
of disorientation

207
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:25,534
are any less real to him.

208
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,667
He's been through a lot.

209
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,802
Now, l have a new prescription
for him.

210
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,201
lt's an antidepressant.

211
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:31,834
There's another here for Haldol.

212
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,734
Try them out.
See how it goes.

213
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,201
You're gonna be just fine,
Jeff.

214
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,500
The scans look really good,

215
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,201
completely clean.

216
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:43,434
Nothing to worry about, really.

217
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:44,733
- Okay.

218
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:51,602
[screaming]

219
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:21,336
- [echoing]
Help us.

220
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:24,335
- [retching]

221
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:28,435
[vomiting]

222
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,868
- What are you doing up?

223
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,402
l came in to check on you.

224
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,433
Jeff.

225
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:13,467
Tell me what's happening.

226
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:22,439
- l'm not imagining
what l've been seeing.

227
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,203
Every time it happens,

228
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,468
l get that déjà vu feeling.

229
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:42,473
lt's like l'm seeing something
that happened before.

230
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,701
- But all of this...

231
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,569
There's got to be
something more,

232
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,600
isn't there?

233
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:02,101
Does it have something to do
with your family?

234
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:07,834
- Everything l'm supposed
to feel for them...

235
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,900
lsn't there.

236
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:20,836
l mean,
l think about them all the time.

237
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,668
But l just-

238
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,002
l don't feel anything.

239
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:34,168
l can't cry.

240
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,870
l'm not angry.

241
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,234
There's nothing.

242
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:43,701
- We grow up here

243
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:46,902
believing in things
that can't be explained...

244
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,539
Things that we can't see,
we can't touch,

245
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:58,035
but we know it's there.

246
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:02,069
We know it's real.

247
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:04,135
My cousin's aunt Mae Noi,

248
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:07,068
she knows about these things.

249
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:10,336
l think we should go
and see her.

250
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,767
- What is it?

251
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,901
- Special tea.

252
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:34,135
This will help you.

253
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,267
- Oh.

254
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,401
[coughing]

255
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:42,001
lt's very good.

256
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,869
- Please sit down.

257
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,669
Choi told me
what you have been seeing.

258
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,838
You know, some people
would consider it quite a gift.

259
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:58,902
- Not if they've been seeing
what l've been seeing.

260
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:03,937
- The shadow world
is a very disturbing place.

261
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:07,102
- Shadow world?

262
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:10,135
- [speaking Thai]

263
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,770
- She says the shadow world
is filled with unfortunate ones

264
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,670
who died suddenly
or died in a terrible way.

265
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,802
Their souls are stuck,

266
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,869
and they keep living
their last moments over and over

267
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,635
like a bad dream.

268
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:36,835
- And that's what l've
been seeing?

269
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:39,768
- [speaking Thai]

270
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,233
- What?

271
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,700
- She says you can see them

272
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,801
if you're looking
at the place they died,

273
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,569
at the time of the day
they died,

274
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,068
and, of course,

275
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,936
only if the place
is in the shadow.

276
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:14,535
- [speaking Thai]

277
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:29,967
Close your eyes, please.

278
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:40,902
[speaking Thai]

279
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:29,268
- Mae Noi said
we can get more tea

280
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:30,501
anytime we need it.

281
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:31,700
We just have to call.

282
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:33,601
- Look, l appreciate
your doing this,

283
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,700
but l'm still not sure

284
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:37,669
your aunt knows
what's going on here.

285
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,136
- Well, no, l meant
l'm sure she understood-

286
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,800
- Understood what?

287
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,935
People don't just start
seeing things like this

288
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:46,901
out of the blue.

289
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:49,735
lt happens for a reason,

290
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:51,200
and l really don't think
l can be cured

291
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:53,902
by your aunt's kind of medicine.

292
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,501
- But we have to do something.

293
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:58,836
- Look, l'm the one
who's screwed here, remember?

294
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:01,001
l can decide what l want to do.

295
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:06,872
- l know it's hard to see now,
but with time, things change.

296
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,001
Things can get better.

297
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,502
- You think l can just get back
what l lost?

298
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,635
- No, of course not.

299
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,067
But it doesn't mean
you just give up.

300
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,469
- Look, just save it
for your hospice patients,

301
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
all right?

302
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:19,201
l don't need it.

303
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,134
- Jeff, what are you doing?

304
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,767
- l just need to be alone
right now.

305
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:26,335
l'll see you at home.
- Jeff, no.

306
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,768
[indistinct whispering]

307
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,402
[high-pitched tone]

308
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:04,933
[gunshot]

309
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:07,101
[screaming]

310
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,869
- [speaking Thai]

311
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:05,768
[high-pitched tone]

312
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:13,501
- Come on.
Come on.

313
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,301
Come on.

314
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:18,602
[woman sobbing]

315
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,736
- [speaking Thai]

316
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:23,766
Help me.

317
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,935
- Jeff, are you in here?

318
00:30:49,966 --> 00:30:51,033
Jeff?

319
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:59,467
My God.

320
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,201
What happened?

321
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:07,368
- [speaking Thai]

322
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,268
- What is she saying?

323
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,769
- The shadow world
should never be able

324
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,036
to reach this side,
not physically.

325
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:20,035
And your connection,

326
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:22,935
it's stronger than she thought.

327
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,701
Your wound is serious.

328
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,601
She can bring you strength.

329
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:27,834
- Turn off the light.

330
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:33,101
- You should let her try.

331
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:45,134
- Raise your hands up.

332
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:53,934
Now close your eyes.

333
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:03,135
[whispering in Thai]

334
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,636
- [sobbing]

335
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,268
Help me, please.

336
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,968
- Mae Noi!

337
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:28,767
What happened?

338
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,970
- It was the woman
from the hall.

339
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,436
- We-we cannot do this alone.

340
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:37,700
We need help.

341
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,302
- This is it?

342
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:18,402
This is the place?

343
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:21,302
You have got
to be kidding me.

344
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,603
- It's been a long, long time.

345
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,601
- Yes, it has.

346
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:03,567
- There was no other-

347
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,101
- What you tried to do...

348
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,468
lt was foolish.

349
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,768
[speaking Thai]

350
00:34:22,466 --> 00:34:24,601
Outside.

351
00:34:56,566 --> 00:34:59,302
- Who is this guy?

352
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,367
- l don't know.

353
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:40,436
- She'll be all right
in a couple of hours.

354
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:42,201
You can take her home.

355
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,501
- Excuse me, home?

356
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:49,367
But l don't understand.

357
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,335
Wait a minute.

358
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:54,102
- Look, Mr. Mills,

359
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,902
you don't know me;
l don't know you.

360
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:58,634
But all of this,

361
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:01,735
everything that happened
to Choi's aunt,

362
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:03,334
it all happened because of me.

363
00:36:03,366 --> 00:36:06,302
- l know why you came.

364
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,333
- l don't think we can wait,

365
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:08,633
so whatever you can do
would be-

366
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,567
- Take your aunt and leave.

367
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:26,067
[knocking]

368
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,600
- How are you?

369
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,201
- Much better now.

370
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:47,203
Tell Warren l need
to speak to him about Jeff.

371
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:49,702
He must-
- We tried.

372
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:53,269
- He said we should leave
when you felt up to it.

373
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,734
- How can you do nothing

374
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:21,169
when you know
what is going to happen to him?

375
00:37:24,133 --> 00:37:27,736
- What he needs
is more than l can do.

376
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:31,002
- But you know how to do it.

377
00:37:31,033 --> 00:37:33,602
You know how to help him.

378
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:41,939
l didn't know
what to expect coming here.

379
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:45,536
l knew
it wasn't gonna be easy,

380
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:49,403
but l didn't have a choice.

381
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,235
lt's-it's-

382
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:01,301
You're pathetic.

383
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:09,403
You owe me for what happened,
Warren.

384
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:20,039
You owe me much more
than my life.

385
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:38,834
- [speaking Thai]

386
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,702
- It's already been 47 days.

387
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:08,268
Not a lot of time left.

388
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,168
- Why are we here?

389
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,668
- To be sure.

390
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,602
- You mean you don't know
what's wrong with me?

391
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,701
- l don't have
to convince myself.

392
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,367
lt's you who needs to be sure.

393
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,935
You and me,

394
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:38,535
we'll always be
just visitors here.

395
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:41,402
We have to learn to believe
what they already know.

396
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,734
What time was the crash?

397
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:47,200
- l don't know exactly,

398
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:48,634
but in the police report,

399
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,502
it says that the accident
happened before 8:OO.

400
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,101
- Jesus.

401
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:55,368
- Nothing about this
is gonna be easy.

402
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,636
l think now is the time
when you should take a look.

403
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:15,869
- Nothing.
There's nothing.

404
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,234
- Wait for it.

405
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:24,468
[high-pitched tone]

406
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,870
[tires screeching]

407
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,868
[loud crash]

408
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,202
Keep watching.

409
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,668
- No.

410
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:01,267
- What is it?

411
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,168
What do you see?

412
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,201
- l see me.

413
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,602
Som.

414
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,035
[retching]

415
00:41:42,866 --> 00:41:45,134
What's going on?

416
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,468
How could l be there?

417
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,534
l'm alive.

418
00:41:48,566 --> 00:41:50,668
- It's all right there
in front of you.

419
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:54,401
Think about it.

420
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:56,668
Sense it.

421
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:00,570
What you feel
for your family...

422
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,735
Goes deep, very deep.

423
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:11,371
lt was your soul
that stayed with them.

424
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,168
You're holding on
to two places at once.

425
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,401
You won't let them go.

426
00:42:14,433 --> 00:42:16,101
That's why the shadow world
can touch you.

427
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,568
That's why your body is dying.

428
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,235
- There's got to be
something that we can do.

429
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,637
Warren...

430
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:34,335
if there's anything
that we can do to help him,

431
00:42:34,366 --> 00:42:35,734
we have to try.

432
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:45,468
- Hundreds of years ago,

433
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,370
they learned that many forms
of sickness and death

434
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,469
were caused by the asuragai.

435
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,538
They're demons
that entered your body

436
00:43:00,566 --> 00:43:02,367
and possessed you.

437
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,503
ln those days, they would send
the sick people off

438
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:09,336
to live by themselves
in these villages

439
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:13,103
so the asuragai
couldn't hurt others.

440
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:17,170
As is often the case,
the separation or wall

441
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:22,905
between us
and the shadow world is thin

442
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,670
in places when there's been
intense suffering.

443
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:32,238
This is why the mawphi
made a kind of sacred barrier

444
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:35,469
that keeps the worlds apart.

445
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,438
lt's sealed from this side.

446
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,069
But the seal can be broken.

447
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:50,104
- So it's a way through
to the shadow world.

448
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:53,870
- It is a way to go over,

449
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,070
rejoin yourself,
and come back.

450
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:01,670
But it's...

451
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:03,902
dangerous...

452
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,402
Especially for you, Jeff.

453
00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:13,738
The asuragai collect in places
where the divide is thin,

454
00:44:13,766 --> 00:44:15,734
hoping to somehow escape.

455
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:21,970
The temple
will keep them from us,

456
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,871
but they'll be able
to get through to you,

457
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,470
just like the ghosts
that touched you,

458
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,168
only worse.

459
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,636
- What do we do
to open the gate?

460
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:42,869
- The ritual can be explained,

461
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,070
but Jeff can't do it
all by himself.

462
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:54,772
Someone has to hold
the pathway open

463
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,837
from this side
Iong enough for Jeff to get back.

464
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,835
That'll be you, Choi.

465
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:29,135
[high-pitched tone]

466
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:31,701
[scraping]

467
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,402
[scraping and banging]

468
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:31,935
- [yelling]

469
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:41,167
- He cut me.

470
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:47,202
l can't breathe.

471
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,567
He stabbed me.

472
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,634
- Help!

473
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,367
- l can't breathe.

474
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,836
- No, no, no. No.

475
00:46:57,866 --> 00:47:01,469
No, it's over.

476
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:06,735
He's gone.

477
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:19,767
- Where...

478
00:47:21,066 --> 00:47:23,034
Where am l?

479
00:47:23,066 --> 00:47:25,501
- It's all right now.

480
00:47:25,533 --> 00:47:27,735
You can go.

481
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,268
You can go.

482
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,102
- Jeff?
Jeff?

483
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:09,567
- It's all right.
He'll be fine.

484
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,534
- What happened?

485
00:48:14,566 --> 00:48:18,870
I
- The woman from the hall

486
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,704
he-he-he spoke to her.

487
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:27,036
He made her leave.

488
00:48:29,966 --> 00:48:32,101
- You've done this before?

489
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:34,001
- She found her way through.

490
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:36,602
She used Jeff.

491
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:37,934
And even if there was
another way,

492
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:40,234
it wouldn't matter.

493
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:41,667
They're everywhere.

494
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:43,701
There are countless numbers
of them.

495
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,101
You live with this
as long as l have...

496
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,535
You realize you're never really
gonna make a difference.

497
00:49:27,033 --> 00:49:29,168
lt's the 48th day.

498
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:34,436
- 48th day?

499
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:38,901
What does that mean?

500
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:43,769
- Seven days times seven weeks

501
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,702
is how long a spirit
stays on Earth

502
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,868
before its fate is sealed.

503
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:56,670
- So l only have until tomorrow?

504
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,335
- Your body will be gone.

505
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:04,168
Your soul will be trapped

506
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:07,169
with your family
in the shadow world.

507
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:12,001
We need to get going.

508
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,870
- l'm guessing we'd never find
this place on a map.

509
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,302
- It's not hard to find.
It's just hard to get to.

510
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:51,735
- Here,
Mae Noi's tea.

511
00:50:58,066 --> 00:51:01,235
She really never told us
how you knew each other.

512
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,601
- l knew her sister.

513
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:08,434
- She has a sister?

514
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:15,903
l can't believe she never
told me she has a sister.

515
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:19,536
l mean,
she's my second cousin's aunt

516
00:51:19,566 --> 00:51:22,402
on my stepfather's side,
but still.

517
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:25,169
- Second cousin's aunt
on your what?

518
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,168
- We have a big family.

519
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,900
Jeff?

520
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:58,136
Jeff, get up.
Let's go.

521
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:00,268
- What's going on?

522
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,502
- We go on foot from here.

523
00:53:20,933 --> 00:53:23,935
- [speaking Thai]

524
00:53:25,533 --> 00:53:27,301
- [speaking Thai]

525
00:53:30,566 --> 00:53:33,802
I
This is Choi

526
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:34,967
I
and this is Jeff

527
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,936
the man we came to take
to the spirit village.

528
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:56,435
- [speaking Thai]

529
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:07,501
We will prepare you tonight

530
00:54:07,533 --> 00:54:09,635
for your final journey
tomorrow.

531
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:13,269
And here you will find food
and a place to rest.

532
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,768
- Thank you.

533
00:54:19,699 --> 00:54:22,602
You have some
very impressive friends.

534
00:54:22,633 --> 00:54:24,935
- Just be open
to what they have to offer.

535
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:36,202
[thunder booming]

536
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:20,503
[men speaking Thai]

537
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,935
- l was kind of getting used
to this look.

538
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,201
- It looks much better on you.

539
00:57:11,233 --> 00:57:12,834
- Yeah, right.

540
00:57:18,433 --> 00:57:21,235
You know, l don't know
a lot of people like you,

541
00:57:21,266 --> 00:57:23,868
who would come here
and do all of this.

542
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:29,467
l suppose l should
have known all along

543
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,035
that you'd do whatever it takes
to help a patient.

544
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,035
- It is a sign
of great strength

545
00:58:00,066 --> 00:58:03,135
that you decide
to return there today.

546
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:05,167
- It's not strength.

547
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:07,502
lt's the least
l can do for her sister.

548
00:58:07,533 --> 00:58:10,135
- l know it's hard
to see it now,

549
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:14,436
but helping Jeff
can be an opportunity.

550
00:58:14,466 --> 00:58:16,034
- To what, fail again?

551
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:17,934
- _suragai tricked you.

552
00:58:17,966 --> 00:58:20,234
- l was weak.

553
00:58:20,266 --> 00:58:23,602
l let myself be deceived.

554
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,534
Losing her was my fault.

555
00:58:25,566 --> 00:58:31,104
- Nevertheless, today will be
an opportunity for you.

556
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:35,337
lt is your choice
what you decide to do with it.

557
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:51,504
Our students have packed
all that you will need.

558
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:56,137
l will make sure all
your belongings are kept safe.

559
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,400
- He's trying to tell you

560
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:58,967
that there's nothing
you can bring with you.

561
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,502
There's no possessions.

562
00:59:01,533 --> 00:59:04,435
We only have ourselves
from here on out.

563
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:08,468
Thank you
for everything you've done

564
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,335
now and before.

565
00:59:10,366 --> 00:59:11,934
- You're welcome.

566
00:59:18,266 --> 00:59:19,300
- [speaking Thai]

567
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:20,333
- Good luck.

568
00:59:23,233 --> 00:59:24,500
- [speaking Thai]

569
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:52,202
- [speaking Thai]

570
01:01:52,233 --> 01:01:53,734
- We're getting close.

571
01:01:53,766 --> 01:01:56,768
[high-pitched tone]

572
01:02:00,966 --> 01:02:02,267
Don't.

573
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,968
Stay focused.

574
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,002
Once they know
you can be drawn to them,

575
01:02:12,033 --> 01:02:14,335
they'll know
they can get to you,

576
01:02:14,366 --> 01:02:17,936
and that would be much worse
than the wound on your arm.

577
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,402
They're flesh eaters.

578
01:02:25,966 --> 01:02:29,135
- You know so much about this.

579
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:32,569
lt's not just stories
you read in a book.

580
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:35,469
You've obviously
been here before.

581
01:02:37,699 --> 01:02:40,636
- Mae Noi's sister...

582
01:02:43,066 --> 01:02:45,568
We had a baby,

583
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:46,634
a daughter.

584
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,901
There was an accident.

585
01:02:51,933 --> 01:02:55,169
Her soul
stayed with our daughter.

586
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:00,271
l came here to save her.

587
01:03:03,566 --> 01:03:06,201
The pathway closed
before she could come back.

588
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:16,036
- And what makes you think
that-

589
01:03:16,066 --> 01:03:19,235
that this time
would be any different?

590
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:24,301
- We don't really have
another option.

591
01:04:26,866 --> 01:04:28,300
Avoid the shadows.

592
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:30,001
Stay in the light.

593
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,801
They can't touch you there.

594
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:34,868
And remember
don't let them kn_w

595
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,168
they can distract you.

596
01:04:40,233 --> 01:04:41,233
Go.

597
01:05:08,266 --> 01:05:09,800
Just go through it.

598
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:11,334
Keep looking straight ahead.

599
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:35,501
That's good.
You're doing good.

600
01:05:59,466 --> 01:06:01,034
The temple's in the center.

601
01:06:01,066 --> 01:06:02,066
Come on.

602
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:05,169
The shadows
are only getting longer.

603
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:09,434
Stay in the light.
Stay in the light.

604
01:06:23,966 --> 01:06:25,500
That's it.

605
01:06:25,533 --> 01:06:27,101
Stay in the light, Jeff.

606
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,634
No, no, no.
Wait.

607
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:41,667
[indistinct whispering]

608
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:44,335
Go ahead, Choi.
Go.

609
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:45,366
Wait.

610
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:52,367
lt's okay.
Go now.

611
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:58,567
Now go.
Go.

612
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:03,503
Keep moving.
Keep moving.

613
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,768
Keep going.

614
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,001
Keep moving.

615
01:07:18,866 --> 01:07:20,300
- Come on.
Come on.

616
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,167
- Jeff!

617
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:30,202
- [yelling]

618
01:07:42,966 --> 01:07:45,201
- Can you walk?

619
01:07:45,233 --> 01:07:46,367
- Yeah.

620
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,468
- Come on.

621
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,801
Come on.

622
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:11,401
You'll be okay here for now.

623
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,600
We have to hurry.

624
01:08:18,633 --> 01:08:19,834
There's not much time.

625
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,934
The shadows
will be in place soon.

626
01:08:24,966 --> 01:08:29,003
Choi, you'll be here.

627
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,236
When the steps
on the other side of the arch

628
01:08:33,266 --> 01:08:37,770
are covered in shadow,
then the pathway can be opened.

629
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
- After they're open,

630
01:08:49,033 --> 01:08:51,535
how long will we have
after that?

631
01:08:51,566 --> 01:08:54,802
- Until the shadow
reaches the top of the arch.

632
01:08:58,133 --> 01:08:59,400
lt's about seven minutes.

633
01:09:00,366 --> 01:09:01,533
- Seven minutes?

634
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,468
- Jeff.

635
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:17,471
l'll try, okay?

636
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,500
Promise.

637
01:09:18,533 --> 01:09:20,134
- Okay.
It's okay.

638
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:21,700
- Choi.

639
01:09:35,233 --> 01:09:39,403
This will protect you
from the light, Choi.

640
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,235
Now close your eyes.

641
01:09:45,366 --> 01:09:47,401
You're gonna see things,

642
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,235
and you're gonna feel things
no one should feel.

643
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:51,333
No matter what happens,

644
01:09:51,366 --> 01:09:54,869
don't open your eyes,
and don't move from here.

645
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,369
lf you do,
the pathway will close.

646
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:04,769
- What am l going to feel?

647
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,070
- The asuragai will do
everything in their power

648
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,568
to trick you.

649
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,536
They will make you feel
as if they are harming you,

650
01:10:13,566 --> 01:10:16,035
but it's not real

651
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:17,834
if you don't open your eyes...

652
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,800
And don't move.

653
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:25,436
No matter what happens,
don't take your mind off Jeff.

654
01:10:29,066 --> 01:10:30,867
Turn your palms up.

655
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,834
Okay, it's time to begin.

656
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:54,402

658
01:11:13,666 --> 01:11:15,467
- It's ready.

659
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:44,802
Rejoin yourself.

660
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,302
Come back as soon as you can.

Jeff?

666

- Don't move.

667
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,001
You can't trust this.

668
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,836
- Please,

669
01:14:02,866 --> 01:14:03,866
help me.

670
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:10,835
Please.

- He-he needs me.

672
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:16,736
- No, Choi.

673
01:14:16,766 --> 01:14:18,901
Don't trust what you see,

674
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:21,335
only what you feel.

675
01:14:27,566 --> 01:14:30,001

- Just don't move.

679
01:14:49,933 --> 01:14:52,468
Don't open your eyes,

He won't let go.

that's kept him alive
