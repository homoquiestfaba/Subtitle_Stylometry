1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,083
<i>My mother
had told me about a saying in Italy.</i>

2
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,791
<i>"Il primo amore non si scorda mai."</i>

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,375
<i>You never forget your first love.</i>

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,208
<i>The irony is,</i>

5
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:36,791
<i>she never mentioned anything
about love in her life</i>

6
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,333
<i>or even Italy, for that matter,</i>

7
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,458
<i>until literally the last minute,</i>

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,166
<i>like it was all some...</i>

9
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,458
<i>big mystery or something.</i>

10
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,916
<i>Which, it turns out...</i>

11
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,375
<i>I guess it kind of was.</i>

12
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,708
<i>So I should
start at the beginning,</i>

13
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,416
<i>which was anything but.</i>

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,916
<i>My mother had laid out
some of her typical crazy rules.</i>

15
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,583
<i>One: being sad wasn't allowed.</i>

16
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,958
<i>Two: no one could wear black.</i>

17
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,166
<i>Just pumpkin spice. Her favorite color.</i>

18
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,708
<i>She was so weird.</i>

19
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:20,791
<i>And...</i>

20
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,916
<i>I really loved her for it.</i>

21
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,416
<i>Number three:
she wanted Fleetwood Mac to play.</i>

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,958
<i>Or local cover band...</i>

23
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,333
<i>Fleetwood Zach.</i>

24
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:35,458
<i>♪ You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say ♪</i>

25
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,083
Seriously, Mother?

00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,250
<i>♪ I want to be with you everywhere ♪</i>

27
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,750
<i>♪ Something's happening... ♪</i>

28
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,958
- Zach's kinda hot.
- Addie!

29
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,708
Right. Sorry. I'm mourning.

30
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:50,875
I'm mourning.

31
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,541
<i>And number four: she mandated that I still go</i>

32
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,208
<i>on our mother-daughter
graduation trip to Rome.</i>

33
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,375
<i>I guess she went when she was my age,</i>

34
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,541
<i>and she found her purpose there,
or something.</i>

35
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,791
<i>I asked if I could bring
my best friend in the world, Addie.</i>

36
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,958
<i>But she said, "No. I had to go alone."</i>

37
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,000
<i>Which is pretty much exactly how I felt.</i>

38
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,083
You okay?

39
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,208
I mean, in a... shitty way.

40
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,583
- Mm...
- Okay. Hey.

41
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,208
Diversion! Okay.

42
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,208
Which pic should I post?

43
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,958
Here we go. Okay.

44
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,375
Super-hot swimsuit, pic A.

45
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,375
Or, even hotter swimsuit, pic B.

46
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,708
Where is that?

47
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,875
Oh, McKearney Castle. In Ireland.

48
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,458
Addie, you've never been to Ireland.

49
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:37,708
Uh-uh. Photoshop does not agree. You see?

50
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,666
- How cute.
- Wow.

51
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,083
That's exactly why
I don't do social media.

52
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,125
Okay. Nerd.

53
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,083
This is exactly why
you don't do anything social.

54
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,966
When's the last time
you even went to a party?

55
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,333
I mean, debate parties?

56
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,708
Those are just not real parties.

57
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,083
But in Italy...

58
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,666
I mean, seriously,
if you do not get on that damn plane

59
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,000
and then turn up
with some crazy, hot, sexy Italiano,

60
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,583
I am never speaking to you again.

61
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,166
Oh, well, that's too bad
'cause I really liked you.

62
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:12,041
Lina! You did not hook up
with one guy your entire senior year!

63
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,500
But... what the hell was I supposed to do?
Bring a date to chemo?

64
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,666
Fair enough. I suck.

65
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:26,083
<i>♪ Won't stop the rain from coming down
Or your heart from breaking ♪</i>

66
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,291
I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow.

67
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,125
I can't believe
you're going by yourself.

68
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,291
My grandparents already passed away.

69
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,625
I pretty much
don't have any family anymore.

70
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,083
Did your mom ever talk about maybe...

71
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,250
finding your dad?

72
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,708
Are you kidding?

73
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:51,000
She said if she ever saw him again
she'd have to be bailed out of jail.

74
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,833
Pfft. Damn.

75
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,541
She really was the GOAT.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,125
You need every one of these books?

77
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,208
Um, it's called getting ahead.

78
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,291
Oh!

79
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,541
Right, professor. Right.

80
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,458
You know,
I seriously don't even want to go.

81
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,375
I... I just want to get on with my life.

82
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:14,875
Lina...

83
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,416
I mean, did you know that 0.4%
of all transcontinental flights

84
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,940
have some sort of maintenance issue?

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,291
Okay, can you just chill for a second?

86
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,666
You're going to freaking Italy! You dork!

87
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,083
You are going to have an amazing time.

88
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,458
Repeat after me.

89
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,791
I am going to have
an amazing time in Italy!

90
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,583
Say it.

91
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,625
I am going to have an amazing time

92
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,666
in Italy.

93
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,083
That's my girl.

94
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,625
I'm gonna miss you, Adds.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,291
<i>It's not that
I didn't really want to go.</i>

96
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,208
<i>It's that I didn't want to go without her.</i>

97
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,250
<i>We'd done everything together</i>

98
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,583
<i>my whole life. And now...</i>

99
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,500
<i>it was just me.</i>

100
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,250
<i>I'd spent all of high school</i>

101
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,541
<i>in denial that she'd beat it
and basically hiding.</i>

102
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,041
<i>I didn't know who the hell I was.</i>

103
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,875
<i>And if it wasn't for her "living wish,"
she called it,</i>

104
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,375
<i>I would have been perfectly unhappy
keeping it that way.</i>

105
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,916
<i>- Signorina, </i>taxi?
- No. Um...

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,250
- Taxi? Ah.
- No, thank you.

107
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,125
Lina! Over here!

108
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,833
Lina! <i>Bella! </i>Francesca.

109
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,458
All right, so, down to business.

110
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,750
You said your Italian is book-perfect.

111
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,208
You got a college high score,
or something?

112
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,125
- Yes?
- Yeah. AP test.

113
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,791
Um, what's the speed limit in Italy?

114
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,458
Ha! I have no limits. So in Italian, then.

115
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,500
Tell me everything
your mother told you about me

116
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,916
that she told you not to tell me about.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,208
Uh...

118
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,708
That you two had a lot of fun?

119
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,916
The tense you used is too formal.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,458
- Car! A formal car!
- Yeah!

121
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,250
Oh my God!

122
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,583
Idiot! What the hell are you doing?

123
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,041
Um...

124
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,000
Here we are.

125
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,541
Welcome to Rome.

126
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,666
- You live here?
- Heavens, no!

127
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,000
My cousin teaches art at a prep school.

128
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,250
They're having
a cocktail party for graduates.

129
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,083
Good for you to meet people your age.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,083
I don't feel so good.

131
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,125
Oh, nothing lipstick
and some makeup can't fix.

132
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,291
I hope.

133
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Okay.

134
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,625
Let's go.

135
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,916
And lose those glasses.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,791
By the way,

137
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,625
I hear that you killed them
at your audition in Florence.

138
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,041
I still have to take the final test.

139
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,750
But I heard they only take
Michelin chef's kids

140
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,458
or those with rich parents.

141
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,583
Just like here.

142
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,375
So they're all pompous assholes?

143
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,541
Yeah.

144
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,708
Don't underestimate yourself, Lorenzo.

145
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,291
You're the best student I've had in years.

146
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,208
Remember,

147
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,958
there's a lot of raging, crazy creativity

148
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,166
behind that sad, unassuming look.

149
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,541
Don't be afraid to unleash it.

150
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,250
Let's leave him alone now.
He just graduated.

151
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,666
Lorenzo, go get drunk.

152
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,125
Thanks.

153
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,250
Bye.

154
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,000
Ah, Lina! Let me introduce you

155
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,541
to my dear pain-in-the-butt
Irish cousin, Howard.

156
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,833
Hi.

157
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,750
Janey Mac!

158
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,500
Uh, sorry, Lina.

159
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,666
The resemblance to your mother is uncanny.

160
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,541
Howard Riley.

161
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,791
Hi. So, um...

162
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,875
You knew her?

163
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,083
I, uh...

164
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,916
I was at university here

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,125
- the summer she stayed with Fran.
- Mm-hmm.

166
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,625
I was so devastated to hear.

167
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:15,416
Sorry. Sorry, you must be sick to
the back teeth of people telling you that.

168
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,708
It's okay.

169
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,625
Um, would you like to see

170
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,583
a favorite place of hers? Fran?

171
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,583
You two go. Together.

172
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,500
You can get to know each other.

173
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,375
Right, then.

174
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,250
Ah... Let's go.

175
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,250
<i>Mercati di Traiano.</i>

176
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,083
Trajan's Market.

177
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:47,583
Built between 100 and 110 AD
by Apollodorus of Damascus.

178
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,875
Considered to be
the world's first shopping mall.

179
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,291
- Huh.
- The emperor's <i>ufficio</i> was just up there.

180
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,208
Well... It's... It's not Brooklyn.

181
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,750
Your mother loved wandering the ruins.

182
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,833
She never really talked about Italy.

183
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,666
- Until she got sick.
- Well...

184
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,041
The more wrinkles
that mock you in the mirror,

185
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,791
I suppose, the more
you think about the past.

186
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,791
She did say that
coming here changed her life.

187
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,875
Do you know how, exactly?

188
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,958
Oh, Italy has a way of transforming you.

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,875
I thought I was coming here to college.
Twenty years later, here I still am.

190
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,208
Howard,
don't get smart with me. Stop hiding.

191
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,041
Can you come up for a second?
I need you here, please.

192
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,708
I'll be right up.

193
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,333
Right. My headmaster.

194
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,500
Better crack on, go suck up.

195
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,750
Enjoy, um...

196
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,958
Enjoy walking in your mother's footsteps.

197
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,125
It is beautiful here, Mom.

198
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,208
It is, isn't it?

199
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,291
American?

200
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,166
Uh...

201
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,166
Am I that obvious?

202
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,416
Your sweatshirt.

203
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,541
Oh.

204
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,958
You go to MIT?

205
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,333
Oh, no. Well, I will, um...

206
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,750
- Next year. Yeah.
- Hmm.

207
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,875
I'll be in Boston too.

208
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,541
Harvard.

209
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,666
Oh. Wow.

210
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,375
Alessandro Albani.

211
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,916
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh...

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,083
Lina Emerson.

213
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,083
It's a pleasure, Lina.

214
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,250
Hi.

215
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,916
Um...

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,875
It's... Do you know, um...
what you're majoring in?

217
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,958
I don't know.

218
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,625
How long have you been here in Rome?

219
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,875
Oh, like, five minutes.

220
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,875
Welcome.

221
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,500
And how good is your Italian?

222
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,666
Uh...

223
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,583
Well...

224
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,500
I got five on my AP test.

225
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,166
Ah, not bad, not bad.

226
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,375
You know,
the way you were looking out at our city...

227
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,833
It was beautiful.

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,750
Well, I mean, the view...
the view is amazing.

229
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,000
It really is.

230
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,250
Ale. Let's go.

231
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,208
I gotta go.

232
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,666
But I hope to see you soon. Hmm?

233
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,750
- Okay.
- Bye.

234
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,000
<i>Si. </i>Yeah. Bye.

235
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,750
Uh, yeah, if you...
if you want, and... I want...

236
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,375
If we... we both want it, we can... totally...

237
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,375
Or not. That's cool.

238
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,250
Great.

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,916
Home sweet home!

240
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,083
Your mother and I spent hours in this room

241
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,000
talking about everything
we were going to do with our lives.

242
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,041
We were the best of friends until... poof!

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,333
Everything's a bit <i>drammatico</i>
with my cousin.

244
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,416
Anyway.

245
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,958
Best room in the house.

246
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,625
Yeah. It's... it's nice.

247
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,833
Howard. Go home.

248
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,875
We have girl stuff to talk about.

249
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,875
Go do your boring man things!

250
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,500
Right. Right.
I'll text you my number.

251
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,500
- Okay.
- Anything. Day or night.

252
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,625
Thanks, Howard.

253
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,166
<i>Ciao.</i>

254
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,875
Now, sit.

255
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,166
This...

256
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,541
was your mom's old diary.

257
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,166
She sent it before...

258
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,291
Oh.

259
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,333
And asked me to give it to you.

260
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,625
From when she was here.

261
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,916
I haven't read it. But...

262
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,166
back then I was a little jealous of it.

263
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:18,958
I...

264
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,333
I don't want it.

265
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,375
I understand, but it was her wish.

266
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,166
Okay.

267
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,583
I made spaghetti.
I'll leave it on the veranda.

268
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,875
And a nice Chianti,
the best jet-lag cure I know.

269
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,041
I'm running out,

270
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,458
having a drink
with a man who sings like Pavarotti,

271
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,041
but, thankfully, does not look like him.

272
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,708
<i>Hello, diary.
I start with a question.</i>

273
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,541
<i>After meeting your nursing school
admissions officer,</i>

274
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,916
<i>do you A, have a freak-out panic attack.</i>

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,916
<i>B, tell the parental units
you just deferred</i>

276
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,375
<i>and blew your graduation money
on a plane ticket.</i>

277
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,250
<i>C, buy a diary.</i>

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,541
<i>Duh, D!</i>

279
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,333
<i>All of the above.</i>

280
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,500
<i>June 9th.</i>

281
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,958
<i>The sun has set,
but Rome is still chattering</i>

282
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,416
<i>like it's alive.</i>

283
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,458
<i>There are strange sirens in the air
and squawking seagulls everywhere.</i>

284
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,958
<i>There's something about this city
that I can't explain.</i>

285
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,434
<i>Maybe it's...</i>

286
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,125
<i>I don't know, the permanence of it.</i>

287
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,083
<i>I'm living with a pretty great family.</i>

288
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,125
<i>Their daughter, Francesca, is my age</i>

289
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,458
<i>and so not thrilled about me
not being an American boy.</i>

290
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,541
<i>Her mother made me
spaghetti alla puttanesca,</i>

291
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,000
<i>- and it's seriously...</i>
- Oh my God.

292
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,541
<i>...the best thing I've ever eaten.</i>

293
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,083
You can say that again!

294
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,041
Wow!

295
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,750
<i>Well, Italy, I'm here,</i>

296
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,791
<i>and I can't wait to see
what you have in store for me.</i>

297
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,083
<i>I really feel like I needed to come here.</i>

298
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,000
<i>Like, maybe to see
who I am away from home.</i>

299
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,333
<i>Away from... myself.</i>

300
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,916
I see
your shoulder alignment is still off.

301
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,375
You're losing power
because you lack fundamentals.

302
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,833
Did you call Banca Milano?

303
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,041
Dad, it's my last summer.
I don't want to go to Milan.

304
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,375
You've spent three summers doing nothing.

305
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,750
Do you need another one?

306
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,625
Right. You think I've never
done anything in my life.

307
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,083
Listen, Alessandro.

308
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,125
You know I'm proud of you.

309
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,458
And I love you.

310
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,375
But I called in favors
to get you these interviews.

311
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,541
If you don't go,
it'll have been a waste of my time.

312
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,041
Yeah, but I never asked for your help.

313
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,000
Know what you'd be without my help?

314
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,833
Nothing.

315
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,583
So call them.

316
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,375
Today.

317
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,041
Hello?

318
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,416
English or Italian?

319
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,625
Oh. What...

320
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,458
Alessandro?

321
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,708
Ale.

322
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,333
Everybody calls me Ale.

323
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,833
English it is, then.

324
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,208
- How did you get my number?
<i>- Mmm...</i>

325
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,666
Last night.

326
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,000
I found you online, and you gave it to me.

327
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,958
Whoa... No, no, that's not possible.

328
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,125
<i>I'm not online.</i>

329
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,208
Oh.

330
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,833
They told me
you American girls like to play games.

331
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,208
Wait, I'll send you the link
of the profile you don't have.

332
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,291
Okay?

333
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,583
No, no, no.
I'm not playing, I swear. I don't, uh...

334
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Oh my...

335
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,708
God.

336
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,166
No, no. This is so not me!

337
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,625
I don't even know how to ski.

338
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,500
<i>And, know what, I don't even hang glide,</i>

339
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,041
I don't skydive, and I...

340
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,791
Oh God! I'm definitely not a cheerleader!

341
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,435
Know what? I have to call you back. Ah!

342
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
<i>Oof.</i>

343
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:54,958
So...

344
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,041
I don't know, you have a twin?

345
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,458
No.

346
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,708
A friend good with Photoshop.

347
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,916
Former friend. I have to go kill her now.

348
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,375
- Bye, Alessandro.
- No, hang on. Hang on.

349
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,416
My dad throws
this Opera fundraiser every year.

350
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,333
You wanna come?

351
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,083
Uh, what? Opera?

352
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,458
Um... I don't know.

353
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,541
Yeah, see you there.

354
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,500
Nine o'clock at La Nuvola. Okay? Dress up.

355
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,541
- Oh, no, no, no. Wait. Ale...
<i>- Bye.</i>

356
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,875
You know, I'll call you back.
Okay? Bye. Okay.

357
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,916
What the hell were you thinking?

358
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,166
<i>I wasn't thinking.</i>

359
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,250
<i>Something you need to do less of.</i>

360
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,083
<i>He's hot and he's on your profile.
That's huge.</i>

361
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,958
It's not <i>my </i>profile. Take it down!

362
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,416
<i>But you already have 500 followers.</i>

363
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,208
Ew! And what the hell are you doing?

364
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,916
- Since when is there a beach in Brooklyn?
<i>- Oh. This?</i>

365
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,041
I give the people what they want.

366
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,000
You are unbelievable.

367
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,916
<i>Lina, as your brand ambassador,</i>

368
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,083
<i>I find it necessary
to help you convey a sense of life.</i>

369
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,791
Since, you know, you don't have one!

370
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,541
For the record, he's not even my type.

371
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,500
International Merit Scholar,

372
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,416
captain of the tennis team, rich as hell...

373
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,041
<i>And, um, Italiano!</i>

374
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,041
<i>What isn't your type, woman?</i>

375
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,666
Take the post down.

376
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,916
Let me think about it.

377
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:13,875
No!

378
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,541
<i>Make a power move, Leen.</i>

379
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,375
<i>I'm surfing in Hawaii.</i>

380
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,458
<i>Ciao!</i>

381
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,333
If you're going to that party,
the first lesson,

382
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,750
maybe the only lesson for the evening is...

383
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,708
how to walk.

384
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,250
A woman walks with purpose,

385
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,291
dignity, and...

386
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,708
hips.

387
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,250
Lots of hips.

388
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,250
You try.

389
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,708
Oh... I don't know.

390
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,291
Oh, stop being mopey American girl.

391
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,083
I'm a fashion consultant.

392
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,416
I do this for a living.

393
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,208
You can trust me, Lina.

394
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,125
Please, show me!

395
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,291
Show...

396
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,791
Okay.

397
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,958
Ah!

398
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,166
Come on, dear.

399
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,958
Slow down. Enjoy it.

400
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,708
Back straight.

401
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,333
Head high.

402
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,666
Lengthen your leg.

403
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,125
Arch the foot.

404
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,458
Heel to toe.

405
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,875
Oh my...

406
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,625
Why can't I just wear flats?

407
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,708
Flats? Maybe you should wear Crocs.

408
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,666
- I love Crocs.
- Ew!

409
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,958
I mean...

410
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,958
Isn't it, like, a little old-fashioned

411
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,958
for a woman to have to wear high heels?

412
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,583
Yes.

413
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,833
Look,

414
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,541
it's not really about
what's on the outside.

415
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,208
It's about mindset.

416
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,500
Grace, instinct, courage.

417
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,791
I...

418
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,916
don't have any of those things.

419
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,916
That's what Italian godmothers are for.

420
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,291
Again.

421
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,791
- Again?
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,375
Mm-hmm.

423
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,000
This way.

424
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,000
Smile.

425
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,083
It's good to breathe.

426
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,250
You know,

427
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,583
I promised your mother
to be a terrible influence.

428
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,458
To help you get a little crazy, for once.

429
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,750
Pretty crazy as it is, thanks.

430
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,583
- Francesca?
- Yes.

431
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,500
Well, when it comes to guys...

432
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,708
I don't have a clue what I'm doing.

433
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,791
Oh, darling.

434
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
You lost your beautiful mother.

435
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,333
But also so much more.

436
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,458
It wasn't...

437
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,333
her fault. I mean...

438
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,958
When we weren't at the hospital,
all I did was study.

439
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,958
Of course, my love.
You want to be able to control something.

440
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,458
Listen. As far as the opposite sex goes...

441
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,125
I believe Fellini said it best.

442
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,083
"If you're moved by something,

443
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,916
it doesn't need explaining."

444
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,750
"If you're not,
no explanation will move you."

445
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,083
Trust your gut.

446
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,333
...followed by a double specialization,

447
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,250
Economics and International Relations.

448
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,583
First Harvard, then Oxford,

449
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,375
then an internship at Lloyds of London.

450
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,500
- Like father, like son.
- Exactly.

451
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,708
- Am I right, son?
- Yes.

452
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,875
Congratulations.
A great opportunity.

453
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,083
- Excellent.
- A toast.

454
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:08,333
Although I think
he should be in Abu Dhabi,

455
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,916
where we have most of our family business.

456
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,333
But you know,

457
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,708
young people need their time.

458
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,750
He'd be 18 by then...

459
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,101
Lina, you look...

460
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,291
Uh, ridiculous.

461
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,625
I know. I had to borrow clothes...

462
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,041
You look stunning, Lina.

463
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,791
- Come.
- Oh. Uh...

464
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,416
Thank you. Um...

465
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,458
God, when you say party,
you mean party.

466
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,541
Yeah, my parents... I mean,

467
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,250
They swear it's for charity, but...

468
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:45,375
it's really to suck up to celebrities,
you know?

469
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,583
Drink?

470
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,208
Ah, no. No, thank you.

471
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,583
Actually, yeah. Yeah, let's...

472
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,583
drink.

473
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,958
Okay.

474
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,708
Two glasses of wine.
2001, Sangiovese. Thanks.

475
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:57,916
Very well.

476
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,583
From a winery in Tuscany
my family has shares in.

477
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,583
Nice... Yeah, I love...

478
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,416
love San Joveene.

479
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,125
It's earthy and... and dry?

480
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,458
- You're an opera fan?
- Yeah.

481
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,458
- It's Puccini tonight.
- Great.

482
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:14,583
Cheers.

483
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,958
Did I say something wrong?

484
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,041
Oh...

485
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,708
You know...

486
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,833
I've actually...

487
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:28,083
I've never had San Joveeno wine...

488
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,166
Um, I don't know why I said that before.

489
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,166
I don't care.

490
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,500
And, you know, I don't actually
know anything about opera

491
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,541
because I've never been to an opera, ever.

492
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:39,708
I don't want to give you this impression

493
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:43,125
that I'm some sort of
super popular influencer

494
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,684
or that I have a crazy social life...

495
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,333
Or that I'm super rich.

496
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,208
So...

497
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:49,875
Yeah.

498
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,833
So cheers...

499
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,291
to firsts.

500
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:00,833
Yeah.

501
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:02,666
Cheers.

502
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,125
Okay, that's not how I described it.

503
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,750
No.

00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:36,208
<i>♪ Love chaser, you're chasing it out of me
But I'm gonna break you, sooner or later ♪</i>

541
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,541
<i>♪ Sooner or later, sooner or later... ♪</i>

542
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,625
Alessandro! Wait!

543
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:48,125
Please, I'm too awkward for this.

544
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,333
Come on!

545
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:51,666
Oh my God!

546
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,500
What the hell are you doing?

547
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,000
Hey, how's it going?

548
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,291
You need to get
down from there, right now!

549
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:03,916
- I guess you caught me.
- Seriously?

550
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,583
- Ale...
- You win.

551
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,500
Or I win.

552
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:17,416
We need to get back inside, now.

553
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:19,958
Why? What are you so scared of?

554
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,791
A lot of things. Um...

555
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,958
Heights, for starters.

556
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,708
Um, security guards.

557
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,500
Planes, snakes, um, large crowds...

558
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,083
You.

559
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,916
You two. Back in. Now.

560
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,166
Uh...

561
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,166
Don't worry. Who cares? For real.

562
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,125
- I'm gonna take a drink now.
- Okay.

563
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,208
Thank you, what a great night.

564
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,041
Um...

565
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,041
What... what is it?

566
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:05,833
My dad.

567
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,750
Your ability to embarrass your family

568
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,791
never ceases to amaze me.

569
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,625
Button up that jacket
and come meet Commissioner Grillo.

570
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,291
No.

571
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,041
I'm with a friend. This is Lina.

572
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,250
Hi.

573
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,875
What the hell do I care about another girl

574
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,000
whose name
you won't even remember tomorrow?

575
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:41,708
Hurry up.

576
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:50,095
I'm sorry.
Don't listen to him.

577
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,708
No. No. It's late.

578
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,250
I'm gonna... I'm gonna head home.

579
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,333
Wait.

580
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,291
You go meet your commissioner person.

581
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,291
- I mean...
- Wait, Lina.

582
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:00,375
It's not like you'll remember
this one tomorrow. Right?

583
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:01,916
Um...

584
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:03,500
Lina.

585
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,291
- Lina, please.
- Alessandro!

586
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,625
- Oh my God!
- Oh, sorry!

587
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,083
Oh, I'm so sorry! I didn't... Uh...

588
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,875
I'll help you.

589
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,583
Um... Oh.

590
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:24,958
You know what?

591
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,041
What?

592
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,875
I said I didn't want to come to this.

593
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,041
And... And...

594
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:33,125
I said I didn't want
to dress like a radioactive sardine.

595
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,041
Here you go.

596
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,500
And... And I said

597
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,875
I didn't wanna wear heels.

598
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,541
Or drink wine.

599
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,750
Which, no offense, Italy, it's...

600
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,041
Oh! Wow. That's...

601
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,208
That looks so good.

602
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:49,125
And, so, um, the wine
is a little overrated and, um...

603
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:51,708
I'm sorry. Uh, don't...

604
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,000
Don't mind me. I'm...

605
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,541
not well.

606
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:02,291
You were at the graduation party
yesterday with Professor Riley?

607
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,833
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I was.

608
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:07,583
- Okay!
- Oh my God!

609
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,458
This is not happening! Um...

610
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:10,541
How do I leave?

611
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:11,500
Yes, and the...

612
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,250
- There is an exit there.
- Okay.

613
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,791
But I owe Professor Riley, and...

614
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,166
I'm about to get off.

615
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,250
Do you want a ride home?

616
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,416
And maybe a change of clothes?

617
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,458
- Really?
- Yeah, if you want.

618
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,166
Um...

619
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:28,958
Okay. Yeah.

620
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:31,000
- Okay?
- Thank you.

621
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,208
You're welcome. Um...

622
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:34,625
This way. Mmm.

623
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:37,250
- Leave it there.
- Okay.

624
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,541
Um, thank you so much for this...

625
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:46,791
For the change of clothes.
It's really, really nice of you. Um...

626
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,916
And now, I'm ready for <i>MasterChef.</i>

627
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:53,166
Looks better on you than on me.

628
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:55,583
Your helmet.

629
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,250
Wa... Wait.

630
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,166
Do you expect me to get on that...

631
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,833
that Italian...

632
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,375
death bike thing?

633
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,708
I mean, I... Do you know

634
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:09,250
that motorcycle accidents
top personal injury lawsuits by threefold?

635
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,750
Is that something you just know?

636
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:14,666
Yeah. I know all kind of stats
about how wrong things can go.

637
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,375
I mean, high heels, for example,
can cause Haglund's disease,

638
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,125
which can cripple you for life.

639
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,333
And that's a fact.

640
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,250
Okay. Um...

641
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,625
So walking home seems
a lot more dangerous.

642
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,333
No?

643
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,750
Good point. Fine.

644
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,041
Are we there yet?

645
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,166
Is all of Rome this bumpy?

646
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,375
You can open your eyes.

647
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:56,708
Watch the road! Not my closed eyes.

648
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:57,875
Okay.

649
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,583
Uh, excuse me.

650
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,125
Where... where are we?

651
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:14,208
It's a secret.

652
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,708
I don't do drugs, just so we're clear.

653
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,500
- Who is it?
- Lorenzo.

654
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,208
Oh. Lorenzo.

655
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,250
- Hi, Greta. How are you?
- Bad.

656
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:29,833
Very bad.

657
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,333
Bad.

658
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:32,916
Oh, I meant to tell you.

659
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,125
I know you have an interview
with the Florence people.

660
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,208
Yeah.

661
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,916
- Don't know. We'll see how it goes.
- Hmm.

662
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,833
Who do I see there? Who is she?

663
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,250
Your sous-chef?

664
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,708
No, no, no. She's a tourist,

665
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,541
but she doesn't know anything.

666
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:52,166
I wanted her to try the best maritozzi
in Italy. Where else if not here?

667
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,875
You're such a smartass.

668
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,166
They're coming.

669
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:02,416
I "know nothing?"

670
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,291
No. I...
I mean about this place.

671
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:09,666
You see, a lot of restaurants in Rome
don't make pastry.

672
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,875
They get them from places that
aren't licensed to sell, like this one.

673
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,625
It's a secret bakery.

674
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,291
Cool. Feel so insider.

675
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,875
Here they are.
Fresh from the oven.

676
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,166
Thanks.

677
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,958
If you see those pompous blowhards
at Cuisine Royale,

678
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,500
send them my greetings.

679
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,208
They'd be lucky to have someone like you.

680
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,833
Thanks. Bye.

681
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,333
- Okay. Ready?
- Ooh.

682
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:37,041
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

683
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,791
Oh. Aren't we gonna eat them?

684
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,541
No. Not here. Bad form.

685
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:42,833
Oh. Ah.

686
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,916
My middle name.

687
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,250
- And can we go slow, please? God.
- No.

688
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,666
Ready? You're gonna love this.

689
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,791
- Mm?
- I hope.

690
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,708
Oh my God!

691
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,458
Mmm.

692
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:02,041
Greta's secret is cold hands.

693
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,333
She keeps her fingers in ice buckets

694
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:06,916
before working the dough.

695
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,208
I can tell.

696
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,458
It really shows.

697
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,208
Wow.

698
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,250
I love Greta's cold hands.

699
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,750
I know. So good, right?

700
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,041
So good.

701
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,541
Um...

702
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,083
Thanks for the ride, Lorenzo.

703
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:28,458
I'll go change and bring these back down.

704
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:30,291
No. I can get them whenever.

705
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,583
Feel free
to make some lasagna or something.

706
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,500
I will. Um...

707
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:36,750
Alessandro?

708
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,041
Hey.

709
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,250
Here she is.

710
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,458
Uh...

711
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:44,500
Lorenzo?

712
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,583
Did you crash my party?

713
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,583
It's the last thing I'd do, trust me.

714
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:53,750
If you've got something to say,
just say it.

715
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,041
Tell me what you have to say.
I've had enough...

716
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,250
I've been working all day. I'm exhausted.

717
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,208
So I'm leaving.

718
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:05,208
- Thanks again, Lorenzo.
- Yeah. Ciao.

719
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:14,666
And that was weird.

720
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah.

721
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,208
I'm sorry. Lorenzo and I
kind of have a thing.

722
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,125
Um...

723
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:24,625
What are you doing here?
And why do you know where I live?

724
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,083
I love that Addie.

725
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,708
Yeah, I... I do too.

726
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:34,125
Look, let me
make it up to you tomorrow. Hmm?

727
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,458
Alessandro. I...

728
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,750
I apologize if this...

729
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,583
comes out wrong, but, um...

730
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:46,583
It seems like you have
a bit of a reputation.

731
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,291
Yeah, maybe I do.

732
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:55,416
And most of it is just people
talking shit behind my back.

733
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,375
Even my own dad.

734
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,541
But trust me, nobody knows me.

735
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:02,791
Not really.

736
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:05,791
And you seem smart enough
to make up your own mind.

737
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,958
Come on, tell me
you didn't have a good time tonight.

738
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,166
At least until you didn't.

739
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,083
'Cause for me
it was one of the best nights I've had in...

740
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,875
I don't even know how long.

741
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:26,916
Okay, so that's the plan.

742
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,875
Tomorrow, twelve o'clock, at my house.
I'll send you the address.

743
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:32,208
- Bring a bathing suit. Okay?
- Alessa...

744
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,250
No. No. A bathing suit?

745
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,458
Do you know
how many honors classes I took?

746
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:38,833
Like, enough
not to look good in a bathing suit.

747
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,750
You know what?
Let me be the judge of that.

748
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:44,291
You're beautiful.

749
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,166
<i>June 19th.</i>

750
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,541
<i>I have a secret.</i>

751
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:01,000
<i>I enrolled in this photography class,</i>

752
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,458
<i>and I kind of got to know this guy.</i>

753
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,208
<i>And I think he actually likes me.</i>

754
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,500
Okay.

755
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,333
Bizarre.

756
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,500
<i>So I'm sort of wigging out now. I mean,</i>

757
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,750
<i>he's wildly cultured and wicked smart</i>

758
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,708
<i>and totally has a smoking-hot bod.</i>

759
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,416
Ew, Mom!

760
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,416
<i>Anyway, I'm calling him "X,"</i>

761
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,166
<i>because I think nosy Francesca
might be reading this.</i>

762
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,000
<i>X asked me to keep this on the DL.
He doesn't want it to get weird.</i>

763
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,083
<i>And honestly,</i>

764
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,416
<i>there's nothing quiet about Franny.</i>

765
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:34,166
Howard is one of
the most famous art restorers in town.

766
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,083
He knows Renaissance painters

767
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,333
better than they knew themselves.
Believe me.

768
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:39,666
Um...

769
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,541
And does he paint?

770
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,625
He used to, but he hung up his brush.

771
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,083
Hi, Howard.

772
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:51,041
Morning.

773
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,333
Hello, cousin.

774
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,375
Morning. How's the form?

775
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,500
Hi, cousin.

776
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,208
Lina, I asked you here today

777
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:00,375
because I have something

778
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,083
that I wanted to give you.

779
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,291
Your mother...

780
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,958
She never went anywhere

781
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:09,458
without this.

782
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,208
Truth be told,

783
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,875
that was her best friend, not me.

784
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:18,000
She had the most extraordinary...

785
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,541
eye.

786
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,250
Oh my God.

787
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:25,458
Some of these are in our house.

788
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,291
She never said she took them.

789
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:30,875
I don't... I don't understand.

790
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:34,041
Why did she stop taking pictures?

791
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,541
I'm late. Off to see a client.

792
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:39,916
And, as far as Mr. Albani goes,

793
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,125
have a good time,

794
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,958
but not too good of a time.

795
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,250
- Okay? Bye!
- Okay. Bye.

796
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:51,041
I can't believe you kept all these.

797
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:53,916
Pack rat.

798
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:55,500
Hmm.

799
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:57,125
Take as long as you need.

801
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:04,041

802
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,791

806
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,875

807
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:17,750
<i>goes away.</i>

808
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,958
<i>And when I focus on someone,</i>

809
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:30,750
<i>it's like I'm seeing into them.</i>

810
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:33,083
<i>And maybe into me too?</i>

811
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,666
Ciao.

812
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:08,083
My day just got better.

813
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:09,791
Wow.

814
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:11,958
- Pick one.
- Oh my God.

815
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:13,666
What the hell does your family do?

816
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,208
- Mafia.
- What?

817
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,875
I'm joking. Banking.

818
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,541
- Which one?
- Won't your parents care?

819
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:22,208
Oh, yeah.
My dad will kill me, but what's new?

820
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,083

Oh. So what? He just met me.

922
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:09,458
Wait, just in. A minute ago.

923
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:12,416

<i>He's getting drinks with his dad tonight.</i>

925
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,750

- Exactly.

926
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,000
Ugh. He just hashtagged
a place called Parmigiana.

927
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:21,375

You've got to be freaking kidding me!

liar! With zero...

Baker lady! I know you're in there!

970
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:53,333
- Who is it? No.
- No...

971
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:55,625
Oh, no, no, no, please.

Please! I just need a fix.

980
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,083
Just a little bit. A little taste. Okay?

981
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:16,541
- I mean, your...
- Your pastry...

982
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:18,291
It doesn't lie.

983
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:23,208
And, and it doesn't try to cop a feel
under a pretty waterfall, you know.

984
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:25,000
And it doesn't humiliate you

985
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:27,958
in front of an entire restaurant
filled with people

986
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:31,750

with some amazingly attractive

987
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:35,500

you know? 'Cause...

988
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,333

989
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:40,875
It's nice.

990
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,208
Because my pastry...

991
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:46,541
doesn't have a penis.

992
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:52,375

Oh. Pastry kind of night, is it?

00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:51,708
You, um...

1017
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:52,916
want to talk about it?

1018
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:55,458
Mm-mm.

1019
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,875

00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,333

1023
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:05,375
Yeah.

- Oh.

1025
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,916
It's just nice, you know, feeling, like...

1026
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:12,958
normal, for once.

1027
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:14,208
Oh my God!

1028
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:16,958
This maritozzo is breathtaking.

1029
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Sorry.

1030
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:21,750

1031
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:25,125
The secret, Howard, is cold hands.

1032
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:26,916
Don't tell people.

1033
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:29,083
- Who knew?
- Mm-hmm.

1034
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:32,666
Look.

1035
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:35,458
I find love is a lot like walking.

1036
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:39,083
When you're young and you don't know how,

1037
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:41,500
you just crawl about on all fours,

1038
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:44,041
bumping into things, crying,

1039
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:45,458
you know, a lot.

1040
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,208
I speak from experience.

1041
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,208
So, have you ever been in, like...

1042
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:51,833
love love?

1043
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:54,875
Once.

1044
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:59,250
Did she not feel the same way?

1045
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:01,750
Complicated.

1046
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:03,291
Yeah, well...

1047
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:04,500
No, thank you.

1048
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:08,500
I have enough complications as it is.

1049
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:15,125
Oh, you can try and throw in the towel.

1050
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,041
But I find the towel
has a mind of its own.

1051
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:24,000
All the art I work on,

1052
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:27,625
it's only ever about love.

1053
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:29,750
Or hate,

1054
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:32,166
which is just love gone wrong.

1055
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:35,833
Howard...

1056
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:40,666
Do you know who my mom was dating
when she was here?

1057
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,916
I am...

1058
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,875
I can't exactly say.

1059
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,750
Yeah, well...

1060
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:55,208
he sounds like a real asshole.

1061
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:08,166
Wake up!

1062
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:11,041
Wakey wakey!

1063
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,250
It's time to turn over a new leaf.

1064
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:17,250
A colleague of Howard's
has invited us to lunch at her parents'.

1065
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:18,875
Come on!

1066
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:20,333
- No...
- Look, I promise...

1067
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:23,791
Some excellent homemade food
will make you forget that idiot.

1068
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:24,875
Trust me.

1069
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:28,291
What?

1070
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,625
Nothing. Uh...

1071
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,041
I'll... I'll make coffee.

1072
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,875

1075
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:48,833

1076
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:50,416

1077
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:52,958

1080
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:01,708
What?

1081
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:05,500
<i>August 11th.
I feel like crying all the time.</i>

1082
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,166
<i>X still won't call me</i>

1083
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,083
<i>and Fran caught me
eating a third bowl of Bolognese.</i>

1084
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:12,208
<i>So I had to tell her, like, everything.</i>

1085
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:13,875
Isn't it wonderful, Lina?

1086
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:15,250
Sure.

1087
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:18,250
Wonderful like a newborn baby.

1088
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:20,625
Um...

1089
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:24,125
I saw the diary. It's about you know what.

1090
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:25,750
Hey.

1091
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:27,166
Does she know about that?

1092
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:30,833
I don't know
whether she knows that you know.

1093
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:32,958
<i>August 19th.</i>

1094
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:35,250
<i>I seriously can't explain
what happened today.</i>

1095
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,625
<i>It's like a totally different person
showed up at my door,</i>

1096
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:38,958
<i>wanting to talk.</i>

1097
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:40,666
<i>I wasn't expecting this. Not from...</i>

1098
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:41,583
<i>- Howie.</i>
- Howie?

1099
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:43,583
- Howie?
- Howie?

1100
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:45,485
You must talk to her.

1101
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,375
Me? Why me?

1102
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:48,625
Guess!

1103
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:51,166
<i>He said sorry for not stepping up earlier.</i>

1104
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,226
<i>- And he's not scared about the baby.</i>
- Wait, what?

1105
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,541
- What?
- What?

1106
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,416
- Goat!
- Goat!

1107
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:01,166
Oh, God.

1108
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:08,916
For you, Papa.

1109
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,541
Hi, Franco. Hi, Martina.

1110
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:13,666
Hi, Franny. Howard!

1111
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,125
How are you?

1112
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,517
- Howard.
- It's good to see you.

1113
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,041
Good to see you. Mwah!

1114
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:22,083
- Oh...
- This is Lina.

1115
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:23,916
My self-proclaimed goddaughter.

1116
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
- Hi, Lina.
- Hi.

1117
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,083
God... daughter.

1118
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:28,916
Fitting.

1119
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,333
Oh, here. She's coming.

1120
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:32,000
My wife, Chiara.

1121
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:33,000
Ciao, Chiara.

1122
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34,166
Hi, my love.

1123
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:37,958
And you must be Lina.

1124
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:39,500
Nice to meet you.

1125
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:40,791
Nice to meet you too.

1126
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,208
Lore is in the kitchen.

1127
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:44,083
He has his final audition tomorrow.

1128
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:53,416
For us.

1129
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,625
Thank you.

1130
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,333
Come. Please.

1131
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:29,166
Wow. Um...

1132
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:30,828
Smells amazing.

1133
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,958
So it's true. You are a chef.

1134
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,833
Well, your Italian is not bad at all.

1135
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:37,791
Thanks.

1136
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,291
Yes, I'm trying a few things...

1137
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:40,666
Experimenting.

1138
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,333
- For the cooking school?
- Yes.

1139
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:46,458
I have my last audition
tomorrow in Florence.

1140
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:47,625
Oh.

1141
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:48,791
From what I can see,

1142
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:50,875
I'm sure you'll ace it.

1143
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,041
Hey, you.

1144
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:54,125
Young hands.

1145
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:55,875
Come help. There's work to do.

1146
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:58,416
- Okay.
- And you, Lo. Hurry up.

1147
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,000
- Hurry up.
- Yes. I'm on it.

1148
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:01,541
Uh, and... Lina.

1149
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,375
This is <i>nonna. Nonna,</i> this is Lina.

1150
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:05,250
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1151
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:10,125
This is the base

1152
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:13,083
to the famous <i>"nonna</i> pistachio gelato."

1153
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:14,916
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1154
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,708
It's... it's legendary.

1155
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,041
Do you like gelato?

1156
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:20,458
Mm, yeah, yeah, I like ice cream.

1157
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:22,875
Ice cream?

1158
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,208
Is a Michelangelo a drawing?

1159
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:28,041
Is a Caravaggio a doodle?

1160
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,833
<i>Nonna,</i> calm down.

1161
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:32,041
- Sorry.
- No. It's okay. It's okay.

1162
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,541
It's okay, it's just...

1163
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:35,125
there is no filler in gelato.

1164
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:36,583
So you have to churn

1165
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:39,250
really fast and hard to fight the frost.

1166
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:41,541
You wanna try?

1167
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,250
Uh, yeah, sure.

1168
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:51,500
Like you mean it.

1169
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:54,416
With passion!

1170
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:58,541
The cool thing is,

1171
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:01,291
our gelato has only five ingredients.

1172
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:02,791
Cream, milk,

1173
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:04,916
sugar, pistachio, and the fifth...

1174
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,041
Shh!

1175
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:09,000
The fifth is a secret.

1176
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,166
Yes, I know.

1177
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,375
- So?
- I wasn't going to tell her.

1178
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,458
- Well... can I try?
- Yeah.

1179
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:19,541
Mmm.

1180
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:21,541
Let me guess, it's, it's, um...

1181
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:23,375
it's vanilla.

1182
00:59:24,041 --> 00:59:25,833
- No.
- Okay. Um...

1183
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,375
Cinnamon?

1184
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:30,500
Okay, I don't know.

1185
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:32,083
I tried.

1186
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:33,166
Okay.

1187
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:34,708
This way.

1188
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:36,000
And... Okay.

1189
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:37,375
And then dig in deeper.

1190
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:41,583
Remember, Lorenzo,
it's a dance between partners,

1191
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:44,000
both respecting what the other offers.

1192
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:45,083
Hmm?

1193
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:47,625
Yeah.

1194
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:48,708
Yeah.

1195
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:54,791
Better. Better.

1196
01:00:00,416 --> 01:00:01,416
Oh, God.

1197
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:02,958
Am I interrupting?

1198
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:04,333
Oh, mamma mia.

1199
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:06,125
No. Hi, Gio.

1200
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:08,083
No, we were only making gelato.

1201
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:10,083
Aww. I see that.

1202
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,125
Let me guess...

1203
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:13,625
With passion?

1204
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:16,500
Always with passion!

1205
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,458
Why am I not the one doing the churning?

1206
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:21,083
You hate churning the gelato. Every time...

1207
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:23,750
You hate it? That's a new one!

1208
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:27,041
It's not nice to say it out loud
in front of other people, Lorenzo.

1209
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,708
Why are you standing there
like a boiled potato?

1210
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:31,875
What...

1211
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:36,958
Sorry.

1212
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,375
Oh...

1213
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:42,583
Um...

1214
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,625
I'll leave.

1215
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:47,041
Sorry.

1216
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:51,583
So much for churning.

1217
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:54,166
Here I am.

1218
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:57,625
So this is a barley and pesto salad.

1219
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,541
On your plate,

1220
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:01,875
you have my mini lasagna cupcakes.

1221
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,166
And these are fried zucchini

1222
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,250
with truffle and caper sauce.

1223
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,625
And to finish, of course,

1224
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,333
we'll eat Nonna's famous pistachio gelato.

1225
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:16,208
Cheers.

1226
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:17,625
To us.

1227
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,041
And to me getting old.

1228
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:24,250
- To us.
- To you, Grandpa.

1229
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:25,333
To us.

1230
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,583
You really need to talk to her.

1231
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:35,083
- And you need to be less obvious.
- Oh, come on.

1232
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:36,833
Why do you keep doing that?

1233
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:38,583
Telling secrets behind my back.

1234
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:42,208
Do you think I'm not aware
of what's going on behind my back?

1235
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:44,166
What's going on behind your back?

1236
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,875
How's the racing going, Giorgia?

1237
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,083
Giorgia races in the Moto GP.

1238
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,708
- She has a World Ranking.
- Mm?

1239
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:51,791
Second place last weekend.

1240
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,541
- Wow!
- Congratulations, well done!

1241
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:54,875
- Congratulations.
- Great.

1242
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:57,166
Well, losing is losing.

1243
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,916
And I never lose.

1244
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:03,125
Lo. Where are the pine nuts?

1245
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,291
Gran, I used macadamia nuts instead.

1246
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:09,125
Mom! He needs to impress the judges.

1247
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:11,875
He's gonna need to bring some changes.

1248
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:13,166
It's the Royale.

1249
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,708
They want classic recipes.

1250
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:16,625
Ah.

1251
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:18,916
Professor, weren't you the one saying

1252
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,916
that Lorenzo needs to be bolder
in expressing himself?

1253
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:23,333
Mom, really?

1254
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:27,708
I firmly believe that,
deep down, Lorenzo is a rebel.

1255
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:29,833
This pesto is delicious!

1256
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:33,583
Do you mean like someone
who, deep down, is a liar?

1257
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,000
I love your pesto, Lorenzo.

1258
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:39,000
Not as much as I love it.

1259
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:43,291
He's going to open a restaurant
and he will call it "Al Contrario."

1260
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,500
Because everything
will be served backwards.

1261
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,291
Desserts first, appetizers last.

1262
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:48,975
Well, don't... Mom, we'll see.

1263
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:50,875
- We'll see.
- Lorenzo.

1264
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,625
Just follow your heart.

1265
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:53,625
Thanks, Mom.

1266
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:54,833
Cheers to that.

1267
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:56,333
- To heart.
- To passion.

1268
01:02:56,416 --> 01:02:57,791
To heart.

1269
01:02:57,875 --> 01:03:00,125
Too bad some of us don't have a heart.

1270
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,041
Oh, Jesus, Lina!

1271
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:04,208
Can we just talk about
this later, after lunch?

1272
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:06,625
No. No. No, we can't.

1273
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:07,625
I'm sorry.

1274
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:10,041
I would never do anything to upset

1275
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:12,791
this beautiful <i>famiglia...</i>

1276
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:17,833
But I don't have
a beautiful <i>famiglia</i> anymore,

1277
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:22,125
which is why I can't fathom
how I can have a father

1278
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:25,916
who couldn't even be bothered
to show up my entire life,

1279
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,750
not even when the woman he said he loved

1280
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:29,916
died!

1281
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,416
I'm...

1282
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,041
Sorry. <i>Buon appetito.</i>

1283
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,500
Go.

1284
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,250
Go, now!

1285
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:43,833
Yeah, okay. I'm going.

1286
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:45,541
Excuse me.

1287
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:08,208
I just don't get it.

1288
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,291
How could you not tell me?

1289
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:16,916
Because...

1290
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:21,916
I'm not your father.

1291
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,458
You're seriously gonna deny...

1292
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:27,333
I don't know what's in that diary,

1293
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:30,125
but I can promise you,
there is no possible...

1294
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:33,000
physical way

1295
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:34,083
for it to be...

1296
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:36,583
well... possible.

1297
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:42,500
But you apologized to her
for not stepping up...

1298
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,208
Oh, bollocks. No.

1299
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:46,333
No, I apologized because...

1300
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:51,583
I apologized

1301
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:54,458
because I loved her.

1302
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:58,458
I pretty much had
since the moment she arrived, but, um...

1303
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:04,750
Pathetically, I didn't have the guts
to do a damn thing about it

1304
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,791
until it was too late.

1305
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,416
So...

1306
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:12,500
If you're not this...

1307
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:14,916
- this X guy...
- His name is...

1308
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,166
Matteo Fossi.

1309
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:21,916
He was her <i>professore </i>of photography, and...

1310
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,750
much as I hate to say this,

1311
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:26,541
Lina, you've...

1312
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:30,833
Well, you've been better off without him.

1313
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,541
Look, I am so sorry
for not telling you earlier,

1314
01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:37,791
but your mother...

1315
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:40,041
She rang Fran, and...

1316
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:43,875
for some reason, she wanted you
to discover it on your own.

1317
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:05,958
Want me to scare him off?
It's one of my many talents.

1318
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:08,750
Oh. No, no, I'll handle it.

1319
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,416
Alessandro...

1320
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:21,708
Go home.

1321
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:22,916
Please.

1322
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,166
Please, Lina, can I just say one thing?

1323
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,625
She was an old friend.

1324
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:29,541
We'd made plans before.
I just didn't know how to cancel.

1325
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:30,916
But you just...

1326
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,291
You cancel.

1327
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:34,666
I know. But nothing is going on with her.

1328
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,875
I screwed up, but I won't do it again.

1329
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:40,458
No, now is just...

1330
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:42,750
It's just not a good time.

1331
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:46,291
Okay.

1332
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:55,750
What about now?

1333
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:57,833
Is now better?

1334
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:05,416
Lina, you were right about...

1335
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,583
not being able to trust me.

1336
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:14,416
Maybe because I've never had anyone
worth trusting me, you know?

1337
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,583
I'm sorry.

1338
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:27,125
- Hi.
- Hey.

1339
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:28,333
What?

1340
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:30,125
Are you going to Florence?

1341
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,916
Uh, yeah. Sort of... unplanned.

1342
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,250
- Um...
- Nice.

1343
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:36,125
You have your audition today, right?

1344
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:37,416
Yeah.

1345
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,208
My moms were gonna take me, but...

1346
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:41,708
then <i>Nonna</i> wanted to come, then<i> Nonno.</i>

1347
01:08:41,791 --> 01:08:43,666
Too many voices in my head.

1348
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,125
Yeah. Um...

1349
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:49,291
I'm... I'm sorry about...

1350
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,791
about yesterday.

1351
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,291
Your meal was incredible.

1352
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:55,625
It was okay.

1353
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:59,291
I think <i>Nonna</i> is right.
I'd better stick to basics today.

1354
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:04,041
Hey.

1355
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:05,416
You all right?

1356
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:09,583
And she never told you anything about him?

1357
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:10,875
No.

1358
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,500
Guess now I know why.

1359
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,791
He basically just completely dropped her.

1360
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:18,791
Can I ask?

1361
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:22,583
What do you expect him to do
when you talk to him?

1362
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:25,291
I don't know.

1363
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:28,250
Maybe people change?

1364
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:31,791
Maybe he's wanted
to reach out, or something?

1365
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,041
My mom came here,

1366
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:40,041
and it was like
her whole life was gonna change.

1367
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:41,166
And then...

1368
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:44,541
she had to give up pretty much

1369
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:46,375
everything she loved.

1370
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:48,041
Because of me.

1371
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,500
No.

1372
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:53,833
I don't know about that.

1373
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:58,250
The way you talk about her, it sounds like

1374
01:09:58,333 --> 01:10:01,750
you were everything that she loved.

1375
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,458
We are allowed to bring only one
pre-made dish to the audition, so...

1376
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:16,625
Take it. It's gelato.

1377
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,750
- What? No, no! I can't take it.
- Yes.

1378
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:20,875
- I think I have the spoon.
- What...

1379
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:23,041
- Here's the spoon.
- I...

1380
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,666
It's not a problem. I have another one.

1381
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:29,958
Lorenzo, I'm really not in the mood.

1382
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:31,416
Yeah, that's the point.

1383
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,541
Trust me.

1384
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:36,125
Everything is better after gelato.

1385
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:38,250
Okay, fine.

1386
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:39,333
Hmm?

1387
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,875
I'll try some.

1388
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:43,291
Mm-hmm.

1389
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:52,625
Holy shit.

1390
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:57,083
It's so good.

1391
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:58,750
Oh my God.

1392
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:00,916
- It's good?
- Oh my God.

1393
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,791
What the hell is the secret ingredient?

1394
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:06,000
<i>Nonna</i> says,

1395
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:07,875
"You know when you know."

1396
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:10,625
God...

1397
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:18,791
<i>Next station: Florence.</i>

1398
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:24,750
Hey, so...

1399
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:27,583
My thing isn't until this afternoon.

1400
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:30,250
Want me to walk you to the gallery, or...

1401
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,916
I could show you Florence, if you want.

1402
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:36,625
Yeah. Yeah. Anything to put it off.

1403
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:39,166
Okay. Um... this way.

1404
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:02,416
- Incredible, right?
- Yeah.

1405
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,166
You're gonna love the rest of the city.

1406
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:50,208
- Oh my God!
- Right?

1407
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:53,208
Sfogliatella.

1408
01:12:53,291 --> 01:12:55,083
- Right?
- So good!

1409
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:24,000
So, this is my favorite place
in all of Florence.

1410
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:27,000
Did you know that
all this stuff comes from local farmers?

1411
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:28,416
- Yeah?
- It's... it's important.

1412
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,500
Yeah.

1413
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:33,541
I'm obviously stalling, but...

1414
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:34,708
this has been fun.

1415
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:36,375
Yeah.

1416
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:38,458
Um...

1417
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,416
Can I ask...

1418
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:43,375
What's the deal with you and Giorgia?

1419
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,166
You have to see this.

1420
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,458
Diamonds of the kitchen.

1421
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:53,875
Truffles. These are so rare.

1422
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:55,625
It takes, like, six years

1423
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:57,541
just for this little guy to grow.

1424
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:58,625
Gross.

1425
01:13:59,083 --> 01:13:59,916
And...

1426
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,625
exposure to fungus spores
can cause acute respiratory illnesses.

1427
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:04,708
Just so you know.

1428
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:07,458
I don't want to know, okay? This is art.

1429
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:09,708
I'll take your word for it.

1430
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,958
Anyway...

1431
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:13,500
Giorgia and I

1432
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:16,916
have been friends forever,
since we were kids.

1433
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,916
And two years ago we started dating.

1434
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,625
- And that's it.
- Yeah. Oh.

1435
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,250
We've always been in school together,

1436
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:26,833
but she's going to
this racing program in Bologna

1437
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:29,458
and long distance is too hard,

1438
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:31,250
so at the end of the summer we...

1439
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:34,333
Oh, I'm sorry.

1440
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:38,000
What's... the deal with you and Alessandro?

1441
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,541
I...

1442
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,583
It was a, um...

1443
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,166
There is no deal.

1444
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,958
You two really
don't like each other, do you?

1445
01:14:51,541 --> 01:14:52,541
No.

1446
01:14:57,875 --> 01:14:59,958
Hey. I'm sorry.

1447
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,500
I'm... I'm annoying.

1448
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:03,791
No. No, no, no, no. Sorry. It's just...

1449
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:08,041
We used to be friends,
like, in middle school, but...

1450
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:16,833
The first year of high school,
this guy, Marco Ricci,

1451
01:15:16,916 --> 01:15:18,916
Ale's new best friend,

1452
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,500
a real asshole, was in the cafeteria

1453
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:24,416
where my mother works and...

1454
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:26,916
to her face, he called her...

1455
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:29,375
a dyke.

1456
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:33,166
And Ale stood there,

1457
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,583
looked at me, and...

1458
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:36,541
and did nothing.

1459
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,791
- Oh my God.
- Whatever.

1460
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:43,666
I don't really fit in
with his whole crowd, you know?

1461
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:51,875
Lina, it's very late.

1462
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:54,750
And I have to go, and you have to go.

1463
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,083
Okay. See the street there?

1464
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:57,791
One block down is his gallery.

1465
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:00,083
I changed my mind. I'm not going.

1466
01:16:00,166 --> 01:16:01,750
- What? No!
- I can't.

1467
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,500
- It's stupid. It's...
- No, no, no.

1468
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:05,708
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1469
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,500
You're showing up.

1470
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:09,833
That's all that matters, because...

1471
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:13,458
Because if he doesn't own it,

1472
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:15,625
it's his loss to not getting to know

1473
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:18,291
the spectacular, goofy,

1474
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:20,083
soulful, full-of-joy Lina

1475
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:21,750
that you are.

1476
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:26,250
Okay.

1477
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:29,958
See you at the train station.

1478
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,041
Yes.

1479
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:33,916
- Good luck, Lorenzo.
- Good luck.

1480
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Bye.

1481
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:41,625
Lorenzo.

1482
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:44,583
Yes?

1483
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,333
Howard is right.

1484
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:50,291
Don't be afraid of, like, being you.

1485
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,791
Who cares if you don't fit
into whatever crowd?

1486
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,708
Don't make excuses.

1487
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:58,666
Be different. Be <i>contrario.</i>

1488
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,166
Your cooking's that good.

1489
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:02,375
I mean, like, on the train

1490
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:05,291
I basically had
a gelato orgasm because of you.

1491
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:11,958
You're so weird.

1492
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:14,041
You don't even know.

1493
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:16,166
Promise?

1494
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,250
Promise.

1495
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:18,708
Go.

1496
01:17:18,791 --> 01:17:19,833
Go.

1497
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,208
Hi there.

1498
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,666
Welcome.

1499
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,458
Are you here to register
for the photography course?

1500
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:13,541
No. Um...

1501
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:16,708
I'm...

1502
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,458
I'm here to...

1503
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:29,833
Excuse me, Miss?

1504
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:49,000
Is everything okay?

1505
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:53,666
I'd...

1506
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:57,250
I'd like to see Mr. Fossi.

1507
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,250
Yes. And you are...

1508
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,291
His daughter.

1509
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:14,250
Next up is Lorenzo Ferrazza.

1510
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:20,291
Good afternoon, chef.

1511
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:22,291
Good afternoon, Mr. Ferrazza.

1512
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:24,708
Congratulations on making it this far.

1513
01:19:25,166 --> 01:19:29,458
So, what dish did you bring from home?

1514
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:34,333
Well, I had prepared
some homemade gelato, but...

1515
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:36,500
I don't have it anymore.

1516
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:40,791
But I wanted
to improvise something for you.

1517
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:44,250
And I wanted to do
something unpredictable,

1518
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:47,833
something backwards,
which is sort of my style.

1519
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:51,083
Using only the ingredients
you have here today.

1520
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:54,416
Why? What's wrong with our cuisine?
Is it predictable?

1521
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,750
Luckily you're here, Mr. Ferrazza.

1522
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:01,458
You finally came to save us,
by doing things backwards.

1523
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:03,750
No, chef, of course not. I just wanted...

1524
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:06,458
No, please. Improvise.

1525
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:09,541
Your time starts right now.

1526
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,873
I know.
But she said that that's her mother.

1527
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:33,083
No, I said no.

1528
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,666
- Mr. Fossi...
- No.

1529
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:43,958
I'm sorry.

1530
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:47,458
I thought Mr. Fossi was here,
but he went out for a meeting.

1531
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:49,291
I can get him to call you back.

1532
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:03,958
What are you doing? You can't go in!

1533
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,541
Sorry, you can't take that.

1534
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:22,791
Watch me.

1535
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,250
Hey.

1536
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:14,166
Hey.

1537
01:22:23,916 --> 01:22:25,541
What did he say to you?

1538
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,541
No, it was so stupid.

1539
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:31,416
I'm so sorry.

1540
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:36,000
Um...

1541
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:38,666
What...

1542
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,708
What happened at your audition?
How'd it go?

1543
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:50,750
Oh.

1544
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:53,541
Oh, Lorenzo, no. It's just...

1545
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:01,041
How do you say, "screw 'em"?

1546
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,375
Screw all of 'em.

1547
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:08,833
Screw 'em.

1548
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:10,875
Screw all of 'em.

1549
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:37,833
Um...

1550
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,000
I'm sorry about your audition.

1551
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:47,666
They called my main course
"solid, but unremarkable."

1552
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:49,833
They were right.

1553
01:24:49,916 --> 01:24:53,041
I chickened out.
I didn't take your advice.

1554
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:54,291
No...

1555
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:56,250
They were wrong. They'll see.

1556
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:57,875
I blew it.

1557
01:24:57,958 --> 01:24:59,000
But...

1558
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:02,000
Lina, I don't want to blow this.

1559
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:04,083
You and me.

1560
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:09,250
I think...

1561
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:12,333
we both were...

1562
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:19,458
It was a mistake.

1563
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:24,625
- You have a girlfriend.
- I know.

1564
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,250
- I don't live here.
- I know.

1565
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,750
It couldn't be more messed up. But...

1566
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:33,875
isn't love kind of like that?

1567
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:40,000
Today was a lot.

1568
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:42,166
I just...

1569
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:43,250
It's okay.

1570
01:25:44,416 --> 01:25:45,416
It's okay.

1571
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,958
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

1572
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:11,333
I hear you went up to Firenze.

1573
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,416
It sucked. He's an asshole.

1574
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:14,875
I'm good now.

1575
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:20,833
I... Uh...

1576
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,458
What the hell was she thinking?

1577
01:26:24,666 --> 01:26:25,875
We all make mistakes.

1578
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:29,583
Although...

1579
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:31,916
you're here.

1580
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:34,916
And if you weren't,

1581
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,375
that would be the big mistake.

1582
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:40,333
I'm leaving on Monday.

1583
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:44,958
I can still start the semester early,

1584
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:47,166
and I'll be ahead of schedule for fall.

1585
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,250
Lina...

1586
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:50,583
I... It's been great

1587
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:52,500
and everything, but...

1588
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:56,083
I just want to get on with my life.

1589
01:26:58,666 --> 01:27:00,208
You know, I appreciate this,

1590
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:01,875
but you can have it back.

1591
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:16,666
Is that it?

1592
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,541
You just let her go?

1593
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:21,166
I don't think I can force her to stay.

1594
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:23,333
You let her mother leave too,

1595
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:25,583
and you spent
the last 18 years regretting it.

1596
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:28,875
I saw you stop dating other women,

1597
01:27:28,958 --> 01:27:30,708
stop painting, stop living,

1598
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:33,000
because you felt responsible.

1599
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:35,500
I can't spend the next 18 years like that!

1600
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:39,500
Don't you get it?

1601
01:27:40,625 --> 01:27:43,416
Hadley didn't send Lina here
to find that coward,

1602
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,125
but to find you.

1603
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:03,126
Oh. Francesca.

1604
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:10,166
Francesca, it...

1605
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:11,250
Okay.

1606
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:12,916
I'm coming.

1607
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,541
Hello?

1608
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:21,875
<i>Mi scusi.</i>
Can I get directions to hot Italian boys?

1609
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:23,875
Addie!

1610
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,500
Oh my God!

1611
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:31,750
Oh my God.

1612
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:33,208
How... Why...

1613
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:35,083
What are you doing here? How did you...

1614
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:36,583
"How" is right.

1615
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:38,208
"How" is the man.

1616
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:39,833
"How" here.

1617
01:28:39,916 --> 01:28:41,166
He called me,

1618
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,708
told me you were talking
all kinds of crazy about leaving?

1619
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:46,375
Your mother gave Francesca
a list of emergency contacts.

1620
01:28:46,458 --> 01:28:48,333
And I'm your 911 girl.

1621
01:28:48,416 --> 01:28:49,458
Oh my God.

1622
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,833
You guys... Why?

1623
01:28:51,916 --> 01:28:53,833
Because now you ain't going nowhere.

1624
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:55,666
All right.

1625
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:58,791
I need pizza, cannolis,
hot Italian boys! Stat!

1626
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,208
Oh, I'm going to like her.

1627
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:02,625
Well done.

1628
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:07,041
Look what your mother's done.
Brought us all together.

1629
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:08,708
A family.

1630
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:11,625
And how.

1631
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,083
I like the sound of that.

1632
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:21,416
He didn't even have the balls to face me.

1633
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,791
My own father, I...

1634
01:29:23,416 --> 01:29:24,541
Two things I know.

1635
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:27,500
One, this cannoli is fire.

1636
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:29,916
And two, F him.

1637
01:29:30,416 --> 01:29:32,166
Yeah. That's what Lorenzo said.

1638
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:34,083
Love Lorenzo!

1639
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:36,041
Get all over that, girl.

1640
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:38,458
Hello, he has a girlfriend. It's...

1641
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:41,166
Aw, girlfriend-shmirlfriend,
you know what I mean?

1642
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,625
No, no, it's pathetic.

1643
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:44,708
Hours after I was all into Alessandro,

1644
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:46,125
I'm over here, like, kissing...

1645
01:29:46,208 --> 01:29:47,458
- Making out with...
- Oh!

1646
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:49,208
Oh, love Alessandro!

1647
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:50,708
You are not helping.

1648
01:29:50,791 --> 01:29:52,375
- He's so hot.
- Addie.

1649
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,791
- Eh...
- Eh...

1650
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:55,333
Look, Lina. Okay.

1651
01:29:55,416 --> 01:29:57,791
You just got to pick one. All right?

1652
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:59,458
I mean, if you don't,

1653
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:01,916
tonight is gonna be very awkward.

1654
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Uh...

1655
01:30:03,791 --> 01:30:04,875
Addie, tonight?

1656
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:07,875
Oh, the graduation party
at Alessandro's house.

1657
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:10,750
He messaged me. And by me, I mean you.

1658
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:13,208
Oh my God.
I am seriously going to kill you.

1659
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,583
No, I'm not going.

1660
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:16,875
Hold on.

1661
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:21,583
Do you think I flew my ass
all the way over here

1662
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:25,041
to not go party
with a bunch of eligible Italianos

1663
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:28,958
and do an opportunity for you
to culturally immerse?

1664
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:30,041
Lina.

1665
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:32,583
You are not getting married here. Okay?

1666
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:34,166
Just pick one of these guys!

1667
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:36,541
You know? Take a plunge.

1668
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:39,833
You know I don't plunge, Addie.

1669
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:43,333
Lina.

1670
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,458
When have I ever let you down?

1671
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:48,125
When?

1672
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,125
- Never.
- Never!

1673
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,625
So if you fall, I got you.

1674
01:30:58,041 --> 01:30:59,750
Fine, we'll go.

1675
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:03,666
Yes! We are about to go off in the city.

1676
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,375
I can't wait. Cannolis, pasta, pizza...

1677
01:31:06,458 --> 01:31:08,875
- Boys. So many boys!
- You're just listing things.

1678
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:12,083
<i>August 24th.</i>

1679
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:14,500
<i>I didn't write for a while,</i>

1680
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:17,666
<i>because I was
trying to have fun, for once.</i>

1681
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:21,833
<i>I'm really embracing</i>

1682
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:22,916
<i>the local culture</i>

1683
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,083
<i>and trying my best
to enjoy my last days here.</i>

1684
01:31:27,791 --> 01:31:30,000
<i>And I succeeded.</i>

1685
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:33,333
<i>For one reason in particular.</i>

1686
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:35,500
<i>Howard.</i>

1687
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:38,166
<i>I've been a complete idiot.</i>

1688
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:41,291
<i>He's sweet, he's kind, he's funny</i>

1689
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:44,750
<i>and also extremely intelligent.</i>

1690
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,666
<i>But he has an incredible career</i>

1691
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,083
<i>ahead of him in Rome,</i>

1692
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:53,250
<i>and he must stay here.</i>

1693
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,416
<i>There's a tradition in Italy.</i>

1694
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:00,958
<i>If you attach a padlock
to one of its bridges</i>

1695
01:32:01,041 --> 01:32:03,166
<i>and throw the key into the Tiber...</i>

1696
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:07,000
<i>your love will never end.</i>

1697
01:32:08,458 --> 01:32:12,333
<i>I might be letting Howard go,
but I'll keep the key</i>

1698
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:14,625
<i>and will carry him with me...</i>

1699
01:32:15,291 --> 01:32:16,500
<i>forever.</i>

1700
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:51,375
He lives here?

1701
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:53,625
Yeah. He really does.

1702
01:32:53,708 --> 01:32:56,458
Wow! I mean,
I'm sure Lorenzo is nice and all,

1703
01:32:56,541 --> 01:32:58,333
but dang!

1704
01:32:58,416 --> 01:32:59,541
Just saying.

1705
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:02,875
Hey.

1706
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:04,250
You good?

1707
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:08,416
Yeah, I'm good. I've...

1708
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,083
I've made my choice.

1709
01:33:11,375 --> 01:33:12,458
Is that...

1710
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:13,541
Yep.

1711
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:17,916
Yes, girl. Yes!

1712
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:23,291
<i>♪ Cold, cold heart... ♪</i>

1713
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:27,333
Glad you came.

1714
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:30,333
Me too. Um...

1715
01:33:30,416 --> 01:33:33,750
- Alessandro, I want you to meet...
- Let me guess. Addie?

1716
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:36,208
Yep. Lina's ass-kicking bodyguard,

1717
01:33:36,291 --> 01:33:38,291
who will wreck you if you even think

1718
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,208
of skanking my girl, again. Got it?

1719
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:43,416
Now, where are all your hot friends at?

1720
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:45,416
Dance floor?

1721
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,375
But be gentle with them. Okay?

1722
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:49,208
<i>Grazie!</i>

1723
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:54,416
Hey.

1724
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:56,083
Hey.

1725
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,875
So... Ale, I've...

1726
01:33:58,958 --> 01:34:01,000
I've had some time to think and...

1727
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:04,291
I realized that I really like you.

1728
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:05,458
Can we stop there?

1729
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:09,583
Alessandro.

1730
01:34:09,666 --> 01:34:12,458
You act all wild

1731
01:34:12,541 --> 01:34:15,916
and crazy happy all the time and...

1732
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:19,666
I think we both know that...

1733
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:21,875
that's not true.

1734
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:26,666
I'm not judging,
but if you're not going where you want,

1735
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,333
how can you get anywhere with me?

1736
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:34,208
I mean, my family...

1737
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:38,291
It's not easy to change things.

1738
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:41,125
And honestly,

1739
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:44,541
I don't think that it's fair
to make that a condition for us.

1740
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,291
And I really mean us.

1741
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,041
I know what you need.

1742
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:52,916
To get on with your life
and forget the past.

1743
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,791
You know, we're the same, trust me.

1744
01:34:56,875 --> 01:35:00,500
Aw. Look who's here!

1745
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:02,625
Giorgia, are you here with Lorenzo?

1746
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:05,875
That would be impossible,
given he's no longer here.

1747
01:35:05,958 --> 01:35:07,438
- Because of her.
- What?

1748
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,833
- Wait, what?
- "Wait, what?"

1749
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:11,958
This slut snuck off
to Florence and hooked up with him.

1750
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:13,291
What the hell? Lorenzo?

1751
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:15,166
No! That's... that's not true.

1752
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,166
Well, it is sort of,

1753
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:19,458
but not chronographically.

1754
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:21,166
It was a distress kiss.

1755
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:23,583
Give me a break.
He left because of you.

1756
01:35:23,666 --> 01:35:25,833
God, I fucking hate Americans!

1757
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:27,333
Leave? Leave where?

1758
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:29,083
- To Paris.
- Paris?

1759
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:31,958
Yeah. He's applying
to the Cuisine Academy.

1760
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:35,250
He said something about
not playing it safe anymore.

1761
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:36,875
When did he leave?

1762
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:39,416
Now. He just left for the train station.

1763
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:41,208
Don't you get it?

1764
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:44,125
We are so screwed up,
we are perfect together.

1765
01:35:44,208 --> 01:35:45,791
We are the same, Lina.

1766
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:48,333
That is... That's your sales pitch?

1767
01:35:48,416 --> 01:35:49,666
I... Okay.

1768
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:53,875
Ah. Oh, oh, oh.

1769
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:54,958
Hi.

1770
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,166
Um... Uh...

1771
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,916
I need a taxi, please.

1772
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,416
- Please.
- Lina!

1773
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:00,666
What the hell?

1774
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:02,500
Lorenzo is getting on a train!

1775
01:36:02,583 --> 01:36:04,916
Lorenzo doesn't own half of Italy!

1776
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,083
Addie, come on!

1777
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:08,083
Ugh! Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

1778
01:36:08,166 --> 01:36:10,250
I need to get to the train station.

1779
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:12,250
Ah. I got this.

1780
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:13,333
What?

1781
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:17,416
Addie, no.

1782
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:19,916
- Eee!
- No, no, no, no, no.

1783
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,833
This is a horrible idea.

1784
01:36:21,916 --> 01:36:25,333
Rome is like NASCAR with more yelling.

1785
01:36:25,416 --> 01:36:26,416
Lina.

1786
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:29,208
With love comes risk
of compound fractures, girl.

1787
01:36:29,291 --> 01:36:31,125
Get on. We're doing this.

1788
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:32,208
Fine.

1789
01:36:33,083 --> 01:36:34,125
But I'm driving.

1790
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:36,833
Queen energy. I love it.

1791
01:36:44,041 --> 01:36:45,125
Oh my God.

1792
01:36:45,208 --> 01:36:46,041
Addie, Addie,

1793
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:47,791
I need you to navigate.

1794
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:49,583
Right. I don't know...

1795
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:51,791
What are you doing?

1796
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:53,958
Oh my God, we're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

1797
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:56,458
- Go straight. Go straight.
- It's a circle.

1798
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:57,958
How am I supposed to go straight?

1799
01:36:58,041 --> 01:36:59,684
Out of the way!

1800
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:02,041
Are you crazy? Careful!

1801
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:03,916
Who teaches them how to drive?

1802
01:37:04,541 --> 01:37:05,958
- Turn right! Turn right!
- Okay.

1803
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:12,833
How do you turn this thing off?

1804
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:14,500
Where's the kickstand?

1805
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:17,041
Sorry.

1806
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:22,041
Thank you.

1807
01:37:22,666 --> 01:37:25,166
Lorenzo! Lorenzo! Lorenzo!

1808
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:28,000
- Lina?
- Lorenzo!

1809
01:37:28,083 --> 01:37:29,750
What are you doing here?

1810
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:31,875
Hey. Uh...

1811
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:35,208
Fancy seeing you here.

1812
01:37:35,291 --> 01:37:36,708
He's really cute in person.

1813
01:37:36,791 --> 01:37:39,125
Yeah, I know! Um... This is...

1814
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:40,208
This is Lorenzo.

1815
01:37:40,291 --> 01:37:41,625
- Addie, Lorenzo.
- Hi.

1816
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:43,166
We almost died for you.

1817
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,370
We really almost did.

1818
01:37:44,416 --> 01:37:45,416
Why?

1819
01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:46,833
Uh...

1820
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:48,208
I'm gonna go.

1821
01:37:48,291 --> 01:37:50,125
Let you two have a moment.

1822
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:51,208
Do your thing.

1823
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,330
- What thing?
- Uh...

1824
01:37:52,375 --> 01:37:53,791
- Ciao!
- Ciao.

1825
01:37:54,625 --> 01:37:55,875
So, what's going on?

1826
01:37:55,958 --> 01:37:57,000
Are you okay?

1827
01:37:57,083 --> 01:37:59,583
Am I okay? Am I okay?

1828
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:01,666
Have you learned nothing about me?

1829
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:04,750
I'm fine. So, um, you're going to Paris.

1830
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:06,166
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1831
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:08,458
I'm gonna try and do it my way, this time.

1832
01:38:08,541 --> 01:38:09,625
- Wow!
- Screw 'em, right?

1833
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:11,500
Yes! Screw them all to hell and back,

1834
01:38:11,583 --> 01:38:13,375
those bastards' sons of bitches!

1835
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,791
Oh... my God.

1836
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:18,458
Oh, wow. I'm...

1837
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:19,666
I'm so sorry.

1838
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:22,458
I don't know where that came from.

1839
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:26,125
There's a lot of adrenaline
pumping through me right now. So...

1840
01:38:26,208 --> 01:38:27,250
So, Lorenzo.

1841
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:29,416
Kissing you,

1842
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,083
or you kissing me...

1843
01:38:31,166 --> 01:38:33,458
I'm not sure which one happened first...

1844
01:38:34,166 --> 01:38:35,083
The point is,

1845
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:36,708
it wasn't a mistake.

1846
01:38:36,791 --> 01:38:38,083
It really wasn't.

1847
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,125
So, you and I...

1848
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:46,166
What I mean is, um...

1849
01:38:46,875 --> 01:38:49,083
My mom helped me realize,

1850
01:38:49,166 --> 01:38:50,666
after she died, that...

1851
01:38:51,416 --> 01:38:54,500
getting swept up in the wrong thing

1852
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:57,208
or even the right thing at the wrong time...

1853
01:38:57,291 --> 01:38:59,166
it isn't something you can ever...

1854
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,000
take back.

1855
01:39:01,083 --> 01:39:02,083
I mean...

1856
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:05,583
I thought I had to make some choice

1857
01:39:05,666 --> 01:39:08,291
between you and Alessandro, but

1858
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:09,958
she really wanted me to come here

1859
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,833
to find me.

1860
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:13,333
So...

1861
01:39:14,708 --> 01:39:16,208
right now, I need to...

1862
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:18,583
just choose me.

1863
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:24,666
It's so annoying

1864
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,958
that even when you deliver
really shitty news,

1865
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:29,958
you still manage to be completely awesome.

1866
01:39:32,458 --> 01:39:33,458
Good luck.

1867
01:39:34,125 --> 01:39:35,125
You too.

1868
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:37,458
You won't need it.

1869
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:40,583
Thank you.

1870
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,916
<i>August 27th.</i>

1871
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,541
<i>I'm leaving today.</i>

1872
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:58,916
<i>Honestly, I'm terrified.</i>

1873
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,541
<i>But I'm ready.</i>

1874
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:02,416
<i>And to you, my daughter,</i>

1875
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,666
<i>I wish with all my heart</i>

1876
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:07,833
<i>that you'll live your life to the fullest
and bravely,</i>

1877
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,916
<i>like a true Italian woman.</i>

1878
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,458
I will try, Mom.

1879
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:14,666
<i>So thanks, Italy.</i>

1880
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,583
<i>You gave me</i>

1881
01:40:16,666 --> 01:40:18,083
<i>a new life</i>

1882
01:40:18,166 --> 01:40:19,916
<i>and a new purpose.</i>

1883
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,833
<i>I will never forget you,</i>

1884
01:40:21,916 --> 01:40:24,125
<i>my first true love.</i>

1885
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:25,583
For you.

1886
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:32,583
You okay?

1887
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,625
I think I know now

1888
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:39,333
why she never really dated anyone.

1889
01:40:40,458 --> 01:40:43,291
She'd already met the one.

1890
01:40:52,083 --> 01:40:54,250
I'm gonna bloody miss you, Lina.

1891
01:40:57,333 --> 01:40:59,333
Oh, Howie. Um...

1892
01:40:59,833 --> 01:41:03,666
She wanted me to come here
to figure myself out,

1893
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:04,750
and...

1894
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,541
I guess I'm still figuring, so...

1895
01:41:08,458 --> 01:41:10,250
I decided to defer a year.

1896
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:12,333
I'm staying.

1897
01:41:18,166 --> 01:41:19,083
Lina.

1898
01:41:19,166 --> 01:41:23,041
If being a father is
just biological, then...

1899
01:41:26,041 --> 01:41:29,750
But if it means worrying incessantly,

1900
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:31,125
illogically,

1901
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:32,208
about you,

1902
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:35,708
wanting only the absolute best for you,

1903
01:41:36,416 --> 01:41:40,125
thinking of ways to physically damage
guys who wanna date you,

1904
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:42,750
then I would really like it

1905
01:41:42,833 --> 01:41:45,166
if you would consider me your adopted dad.

1906
01:41:57,208 --> 01:41:58,208
Thanks...

1907
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:00,958
Dad.

1908
01:42:13,166 --> 01:42:14,791
<i>I could never have realized</i>

1909
01:42:14,875 --> 01:42:18,791
<i>that my mother's living wish
would give me a new life too.</i>

1910
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:22,875
<i>A year later, it's not that
I've got it all figured out.</i>

1911
01:42:22,958 --> 01:42:26,666
<i>But I'm okay with that,
for once in my life.</i>

1912
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:30,000
<i>Because I also found something in Italy,</i>

1913
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:31,833
<i>in an old camera</i>

1914
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:34,125
<i>from a crazy godmother,</i>

1915
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:35,875
<i>with a real father</i>

1916
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:38,458
<i>and for myself.</i>

1917
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,208
<i>You were right, Mom.</i>

1918
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:42,583
<i>"Il primo amore non si scorda mai."</i>

1919
01:42:42,666 --> 01:42:43,500
FOR RENT

1920
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:44,583
Greta!

1921
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:46,875
Oh, no.

1922
01:42:52,791 --> 01:42:54,041
Rumor has it

1923
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:57,875
some American girl
kept showing up and outed them.

1924
01:42:57,958 --> 01:42:59,875
In the end, they had to shut down.

1925
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:02,583
Lorenzo! What...

1926
01:43:02,666 --> 01:43:05,041
Wow, look at you!

1927
01:43:06,416 --> 01:43:07,916
Greta retired.

1928
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:10,583
Someone else took over the place.

1929
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:14,666
No! I love this place.

1930
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:17,125
That's so sad.

1931
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,708
I'm taking over.

1932
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,625
BACKWARDS

1933
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:30,291
Oh my God.

1934
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,250
I'm working out the details
for when I graduate.

1935
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:35,708
It's crazy, Lorenzo.

1936
01:43:35,791 --> 01:43:38,000
I'm so happy for you.

1937
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:39,250
Thank you.

1938
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:41,250
And you? What...

1939
01:43:41,333 --> 01:43:43,375
Have you been here all this time?

1940
01:43:43,916 --> 01:43:45,750
Yes. Gap year.

1941
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:48,375
I'm taking a few classes.

1942
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,166
Well...

1943
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:05,708
It was great seeing you.

1944
01:44:05,791 --> 01:44:07,791
Yes. You too.

1945
01:44:12,083 --> 01:44:13,083
Bye.

1946
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:15,083
Bye.

1947
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:19,416
- Whoa!
- Oh! Lina!

1948
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:20,625
Are you okay?

1949
01:44:20,708 --> 01:44:21,708
Yes.

1950
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:25,750
Some things clearly never change.

1951
01:44:30,541 --> 01:44:31,541
Good.

1952
01:44:32,375 --> 01:44:34,250
I like you the way you are.

1953
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:44,041
Listen...

1954
01:44:44,541 --> 01:44:46,625
<i>Nonna</i> is making dinner tonight.

1955
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:50,000
She made her gelato. Wanna come?

1956
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,291
We'll have to take my Italian death bike.

1957
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,125
I'm sorry, Lorenzo.

1958
01:44:59,208 --> 01:45:00,208
No.

1959
01:45:01,875 --> 01:45:02,875
Okay.

1960
01:45:03,875 --> 01:45:07,083
We'll have to take mine.

1961
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,041
By the way, I figured out
the secret ingredient.

1962
01:45:20,583 --> 01:45:22,041
Better late than never.
