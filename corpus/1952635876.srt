00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,484
Dear viewer

10
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:20,873
... I shot this film 
in the San Francisco bay area ...

11
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:23,448
... when I was seventeen years old
and still in high school.

12
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:26,024
Working with a budget of $4000,
I struggled to go to school,

13
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:29,090
work part-time to finance the film,
and film on nights and weekends ...

14
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,153
... with the help 
of a volunteer cast and crew.

15
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:33,606
I am proud to say 
that this is my first film whatsoever.

16
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:35,212
And I knew nothing...

17
00:00:35,312 --> 00:00:37,330
Filming took a year.
Editing took several months.

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,330
I emptied out my meager life savings,
worked on a script with friends,

19
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,519
bought and learned how to use 
an extraordinary digital camera (canon xl-2),

20
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,236
and learned how to edit.

21
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,544
Music was composed by friends 
or used by permission.

22
00:00:47,644 --> 00:00:50,543
This film was the most difficult 
and yet most rewarding experience ...

23
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:52,450
... of the first seventeen years of my life.

24
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,182
I hope and pray everyday 
that I'll get a chance to do it again.

25
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:57,278
Lastly, I am quite proud to have shot in digital.

26
00:00:57,378 --> 00:01:00,935
And I am hoping a similar approach to distribution 
will work itself out in the end...

27
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:04,057
...as I constantly dream about 
another chance at "this filmmaking thing."

28
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:06,477
Please share this film.
And feel free to drop me a line!

29
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:08,361
Thank you for all of your support,

I have always preferred the reflection of the life 
to life itself. François Truffaut.

33
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:18,262
I don't need this right now.

34
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:21,243
I don't care where you go.

35
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,873
Just, just leave.

36
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,067
Come on, look at yourself.  

37
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,582
This is not just a game.  

38
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:54,562
This is real.

39
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:56,831
This is me.

40
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:08,086
You are so concerned 
with all the other people around you ...

41
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:12,401
... that you're ignoring the fact 
that you yourself are the problem

42
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,872
why are you here?

43
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:22,266
why did you have to come back?

44
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:02,296
He needs to do some fucking chores

45
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:04,380
fine fine fine

46
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,799
Hey look boy, you wanna live here, ...

47
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:16,923
.. you're gonna have to play 
by our rules, alright?

48
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:21,417
That means you gotta do 
some fucking chores.

49
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:58,473
Your mom might have let you 
roll around in your little problems, ...

50
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,787
... but she's not here

51
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,561
God does everything for a reason

52
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,615
I said ice 

53
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:25,010
Get your fucking daughter to do it

54
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,642
What about my daughter?

55
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:30,311
They're your kids Ron

56
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:34,660
Yeah? What? I pay 
for your daughter's shit

57
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,895
You don't pay for shit

58
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,618
Ron, you don't get any fucking hours

59
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:44,501
Who do you think pays the rent?
- Shut up

60
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,404
Hey what are you doing in there?

61
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:02,385
Get me some fucking ice

62
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:06,038
You don't get any fucking hours

63
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:10,482
Who do you think pays garbage, 
- Fucking shut up man!

64
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:12,112
electricity, the phone?

65
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:14,513
What the fuck are you talking about?

66
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,086
Fucking utilities, Ron

67
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:19,111
Get me some fucking ice, 
and shut your mouth

68
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:25,027
Who bailed your 
wife-beating ass out of jail

69
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,469
Don't fucking talk to me like that

70
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:34,547
You wanna hit me too
Don't you Ron?

71
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:38,195
Fucking watch it
I'm telling you

72
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:40,909
Come on Ron, fuck you

73
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,745
Fucking bitch
Shut up. Fucking bitch

74
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,367
Just go back to school.  

75
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,992
Things will be better from now on.

76
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:16,839
We'll see each other more often

77
00:24:17,077 --> 00:24:19,098
And, you won't run into them as much

78
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:30,160
Things are not as bad as they seem

79
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,548
When we were talking about it,

80
00:24:35,345 --> 00:24:37,257
it really messed you up

81
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:44,662
Just, just take a minute to think about 
what you're really saying

82
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:48,779
Things are really not as bad 
as they seem

83
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:20,897
Hey what're you doing man?

84
00:30:20,997 --> 00:30:24,463
- I just got home, I'm going to bed
- Yeah, what are you doing getting home...

85
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:27,087

Do you like it when 
they touch your pussy?

100
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:20,568
You just lie there?  
You're just like your mother.

101
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:24,340

110
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:09,889
Everything has changed Steve

111
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:13,542
Everyone at school stares at me

112
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:19,821
My neighbours stare at me

113
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:24,125
I'm going to go to jail because of you

114
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:40,584
Everything's so different now

115
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,697
It's your fault

116
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:54,418
Sexual harassment Steve

117
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:58,244
Sexual harassment

She took, she took everything we have and 
she tried to shoot me with a gun, she
