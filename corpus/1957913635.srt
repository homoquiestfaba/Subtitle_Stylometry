1
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:50,767
Wait.

2
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,266
Lucy, what is it?

3
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,767
What happened?

4
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,900
I, I, I can't do it, Grandma.

5
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57,100
What?

6
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:58,767
I'm not good enough to be Clara.

7
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,100
Wait a minute.

8
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,433
You got a callback.

9
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,967
That's just because
of who you are.

10
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,667
Who told you that?

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,967
One of the other girls.

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,834
Well, that is nonsense.

13
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:10,767
You got here on your own, okay?

14
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:13,233
All right. All right.

15
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,133
How long until your group?

16
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:19,100
They said about
an hour and a half.

17
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,500
Okay. Come on.

18
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:21,834
I want to show you something.

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,600
What is all this?

20
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:30,100
This is all Rockettes history.

21
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:33,600
All of these ladies were
superstars; actually,

22
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:34,834
they still are.

23
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:36,247
But I want to tell
you something.

24
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,333
I think that the biggest star

25
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,767
in this whole place will be you.

26
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:46,767
But I know how much
it would mean to you

27
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,900
if I got to be Clara.

28
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:49,233
- Oh.
- I just,

29
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:53,100
I just don't want you to be
disappointed if I'm not picked.

30
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,166
The only thing that
would really disappoint me

31
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,033
is if you didn't try.

32
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,667
One of the best things in life

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,900
comes when you're really
scared to do something

34
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,400
but you do it anyway.

35
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,400
Were you scared
when you auditioned?

36
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,233
No.

37
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:12,367
But boy, when they said
yes, I was terrified.

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,000
But of course then I, uh,

39
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,166
I had a lot more to lose.

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,667
You know what?

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,567
I think that you're
old enough now

42
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,867
to hear the entire story.

43
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,233
While my family was
busy getting ready

44
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:41,200
to host the most lavish
Thanksgiving dinner in Philadelphia,

45
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:46,734
I turned on the TV and
what I saw changed my life.

46
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:50,000
It was the first year that
the Rockettes ever performed

47
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:50,867
at the parade,

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,734
and I was absolutely mesmerized.

49
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:58,734
I wished so badly that
I could be one of them.

50
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:01,300
I knew my family
would never approve.

51
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,633
Why not?

52
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:03,767
Well,

53
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,100
my future was already
all mapped out for me,

54
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:10,633
and it had nothing
to do with dancing.

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,767
Is that real gold, Mother?

56
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,800
Oh, don't be
ridiculous, Margaret.

57
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,300
It's gold leaf.

58
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,313
Perhaps we should just
dip the entire invitation

59
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,967
into diamond dust.

60
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,633
Oh, is that an option?

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,433
I wasn't serious.

62
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:29,900
Well, I am serious.

63
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,133
You're our only child,

64
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,800
and we are doing
this to the nines.

65
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,509
I'm sure you could
just do it to the sixes

66
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,433
and be perfectly fine.

67
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,066
What's Maxwell's middle name?

68
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,100
I haven't the
faintest idea, Mother.

69
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:44,133
I also don't know
his favorite book,

70
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,800
color, food,

71
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:47,934
what inspires him,

72
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,133
what brings him joy.

73
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,967
You'll learn all
of that in time.

74
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,209
Shouldn't I already know
the man I'm marrying in April?

75
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,967
All you need to know is
that Maxwell is a good man

76
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,700
and he comes from a wonderful
Philadelphia family.

77
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:04,000
Everyone agrees it's
a perfect match.

78
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:05,967
Good morning, dear.

79
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,800
As soon as Maxwell
arrives, we'll start brunch.

80
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:09,633
Oh, there he is!

81
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,867
Hello, my darling.

82
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,633
You look stunning
today as always.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,109
How are the wedding
plans coming along?

84
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,500
Swimmingly.

85
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:21,633
Is that gold leaf.

86
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,333
Very nice.

87
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,467
My parents send the
regards, by the way.

88
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,967
Father has a polo match at
Brandywine this afternoon.

89
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,200
Oh.

90
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,643
We really should go
and see him play.

91
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,633
Wouldn't that be a
fine time, Margaret?

92
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,667
Maxwell, can I
ask you a question?

93
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,633
Of course.

94
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,467
What brings you true joy?

95
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,133
What really makes you happy?

96
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:41,300
Margaret,

97
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:42,633
we were talking about polo.

98
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,033
How about polo then?

99
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,633
Does polo make you happy?

100
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:47,800
You make me happy.

101
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:48,934
Thank you.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,066
That's very nice.

103
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,967
What's my middle name?

104
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,667
Maury?

105
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Mary.

106
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:01,266
It's Marie.

107
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Ah, as in Antoinette.

108
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,533
Maxwell, you must tell us
about your father's new horse.

109
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,433
Didn't you pick it up
at the Devon Horse Show

110
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:11,633
over the summer?

111
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,509
- Yes, we did.
- A five, six, seven and eight

112
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,700
A one and a two, a three,
a four, a five and a six,

113
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:16,567
a seven and eight.

114
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,100
A one, two, three, four,

115
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,900
a five, a six, a
seven and eight.

116
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,266
A one and a two, and a three,

117
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,367
a four, five, six, seven, eight.

118
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,934
One, two, a three, a four,

119
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:27,033
five, six, seven, eight.

120
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,767
Oh, bravo, ladies!

121
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,266
Bravo!

122
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,367
Margaret, you were in
fantastic form as always.

123
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,200
Thank you.

124
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,500
Oh, before go,

125
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,676
I want to tell you about an
exciting last-minute audition

126
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
this afternoon.

127
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:52,667
Come on.

128
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,533
The Rockettes are all
you've talked about

129
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,033
since last Thanksgiving.

130
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,734
And if I get cast, then what?

131
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:58,934
I move to New York
for two months?

132
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,066
It's preposterous.

133
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,266
Well, I'm definitely
not going to get cast.

134
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,333
But it's a great way to
get audition experience.

135
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,767
And I don't want
to go on my own.

136
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,633
Just come with me, please.

137
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:09,767
Okay.

138
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,333
For curiosity's sake, I'll go.

139
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:30,133
Number 32, number
154, thank you.

140
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,467
Congratulations,
Margaret Bennett.

141
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,467
We've been searching for three
new dancers for this season,

142
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,767
and you got the last spot.

143
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,533
See you November 1st.

144
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,767
Was that a blast or what?

145
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,042
Now you know you
were good enough

146
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,934
even though you
can't actually do it.

147
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,500
Can you imagine
leaving Philadelphia

148
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,609
in the middle of planning
the biggest Main Line wedding

149
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,100
in years?

150
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,473
Not to mention the fact your
family would never allow it.

151
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,700
You are going to tell
them no, aren't you?

152
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,133
Margaret,

153
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,033
where have you been?

154
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,400
I thought your class
ended hours ago.

155
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,609
I've been thinking
about the wedding

156
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:18,309
and how I still haven't
found the perfect dress,

157
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,493
so I went to the bridal salon

158
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,233
to see if they had anything new.

159
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:22,367
And did they?

160
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:23,233
Nothing at all.

161
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,166
So I was thinking,

162
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,400
why don't I go to New York and
meet with Gabriella Monroe?

163
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:29,533
Margaret,

164
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,142
I have tried every
connection I have in the city

165
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,309
to get an appointment with her.

166
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,734
She is booked
through the summer.

167
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,667
Well, I have another connection.

168
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
You do? Who?

169
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,834
Remember my friend Kitty
from summer camp in Maine?

170
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,066
She's Gabriella's niece.

171
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,400
Well, she said her aunt
could see me on November 1st.

172
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,066
That's wonderful.

173
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,560
Oh, and of course
I'll go with you.

174
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,166
No.

175
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,367
I'd like to go on my own.

176
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,867
No, I'm not comfortable

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,776
with you being in the city
by yourself, young lady.

178
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,200
I'll stay with Kitty.

179
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,734
Her husband just bought a
penthouse on Central Park.

180
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:02,266
Oh, she married well.

181
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,233
She must be on cloud nine.

182
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,266
I'm sure she is.

183
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,567
Margaret, you're here!

184
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
Kitty!

185
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:18,066
Oh!

186
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,900
Are you sure you're
okay with this?

187
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,033
Of course.

188
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,676
This is just like "It
Happened One Night."

189
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,900
You're like Claudette Colbert,

190
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,242
running away from
her wealthy family

191
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,266
to follow her dream.

192
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,367
I'm not running away.

193
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,967
I'm having one last
pre-wedding adventure

194
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,400
that no one in my family
can ever know about.

195
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:35,533
Ooh, I should probably
get to my new apartment.

196
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,033
You're not even staying with me?

197
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,843
The Rockettes have us
in an all women's building

198
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,567
at West 52nd and 8th,

199
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,867
just a few blocks
from Radio City.

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,066
How brave?

201
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,367
What do you mean?

202
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,367
I just mean it's a
different lifestyle

203
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,767
than you're used to.

204
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,533
Oh, I'm sure it's lovely.

205
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,533
So that's just south
of here, right?

206
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,767
Is it walking distance?

207
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,367
Not, not with all that luggage.

208
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,533
Let's get you a cab.

209
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:00,667
Oh.

210
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:06,600
Remember, if my
parents or Maxwell call-

211
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:07,500
I'll tell them
they can reach you

212
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:08,633
at Radio City Music Hall.

213
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:09,600
Kitty!

214
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:10,834
Don't worry, Margaret.

215
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,487
I'll tell them you're
wedding shopping,

216
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:14,166
which we will do
together, won't we?

217
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
Of course.

218
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:19,834
Now, Lillian,

219
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,333
this year please
try to remember,

220
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,107
the 10 o'clock curfew
is not a suggestion,

221
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,100
it's a rule.

222
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:25,600
A young woman can't be seen

223
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:27,767
gallivanting around town
at all hours, understood?

224
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,200
Of course, Rose.

225
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,333
You, boys, you're loitering.

226
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:34,166
Go on now.

227
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Shoo! Shoo!

228
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,609
Could you possibly take
those up to my room for me?

229
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,200
Uh, they're quite heavy and
I'm on the fourth floor.

230
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,333
Ooh, I'll just wait for
the doorman, I suppose.

231
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh!
Hey!

232
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:08,500
Is that a handbag
or a Billy club?

233
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:09,333
I'm terribly sorry,

234
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:10,600
I didn't see you there.

235
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,000
Are you hurt?

236
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,276
It takes a lot more than
a weaponized accessory

237
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
to hurt a Navy man.

238
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm curious.

239
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,443
Why does the Navy have you
taking pictures of a lamppost?

240
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:20,533
I'm on leave.

241
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,500
And if you really want to know,

242
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,834
I'm taking a shot of the
tinsel on the streetlight.

243
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,133
The little bit there.

244
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:29,076
I saw it and thought about how
it's probably been up there

245
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,500
the entire year,

246
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:31,833
just hanging on for dear life,

247
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:32,943
waiting for the
rest of its friends

248
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,333
to come back for Christmas.

249
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,743
I think my thought
would've been,

250
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:39,100
"Someone didn't do a very good
job cleaning up in January."

251
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,533
Well, I guess it just
depends on how you look at things.

252
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,433
Can I help you with those?

253
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,433
Oh, no.

254
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:45,710
I'm just waiting
for the doorman.

255
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:47,133
We don't have doormen

256
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:50,300
or any men in this
building, for that matter.

257
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:53,333
Of course you'll find
more than a few gentlemen

258
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,834
happen upon this
apartment building

259
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:55,767
looking for romance.

260
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh.

261
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:58,000
Not interested, thank you.
I really

262
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:58,934
was just taking pictures.

263
00:10:59,066 --> 00:10:59,834
Is that so?

264
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm a photographer, ma'am.

265
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,843
I thought you said
you were in the Navy.

266
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:04,734
Oh, the Navy has photographers.

267
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:07,233
I take pictures all around
the ship, the bases,

268
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,367
everywhere the Navy goes.

269
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,667
There are no ships
on West 52nd, sailor.

270
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Move on!

271
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,233
Have a nice day, ma'am.

272
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,367
Miss.

273
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,233
I'm Rose, the apartment manager.

274
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,533
Margaret Bennett, I'm new.

275
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,667
No kidding, Maggie.

276
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,567
I'll help with your bags.

277
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Hi.

278
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,133
Excuse me.

279
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,000
What do you think?

280
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,000
This will do just fine.

281
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,667
♪ Santa baby, got
a gift for me ♪

282
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,734
But it isn't very
private, is it?

283
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:52,066
No, because this
is the common room.

284
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,300
This is your room.

285
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:58,100
I don't get my own room.

286
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,066
I could pay extra.

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,166
How much more would
that be weekly? I...

288
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,233
Oh, I spent most of my cash in
the dining car on the train.

289
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,533
There was the most
gorgeous shrimp cocktail.

290
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:12,800
Anyway, I'm sure we
could work something out.

291
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:15,300
Oh, it's nothing to do
with the money, dear.

292
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,567
First years are at the
bottom of the wait list.

293
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,633
- Oh.
- Good luck, dear.

294
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,934
What am I doing?

295
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,266
You're helping me decorate
for Christmas, that's what.

296
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,576
But it's not even
Thanksgiving yet.

297
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,734
Oh, what can I say?

298
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:40,867
I'm festive.

299
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,667
Here, sit over there.

300
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,800
I'm Sofia Gagliardi, by the way.

301
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,900
And one thing you should know
about me is I talk a lot.

302
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,633
So if we're going to be friends,

303
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,407
you got to tell me if
I'm talking too much

304
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,409
or else I'll just keep talking
and talking and talking.

305
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:56,476
And I'm doing it right now,

306
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,220
and I can't believe you
didn't say anything.

307
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,133
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,266
I'm Marg...

309
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,200
Maggie Bennett
from Philadelphia.

310
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,333
Love Philly.

311
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,800
Oh, Liberty Bell, cheese steaks,

312
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:10,700
Ben Franklin.

313
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:11,633
Am I forgetting anything?

314
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,300
No, that's pretty much it.

315
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,133
Where are you from?

316
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:15,266
Bensonhurst.

317
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,333
Brooklyn.

318
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,133
I changed my mind,
I'll finish this later.

319
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,467
You got to change clothes.

320
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
We got to be at Radio
City in 20 minutes,

321
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:23,934
and you're wearing a dress

322
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,266
like we're going to the theater

323
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,476
instead of going to the theater,

324
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,734
if you know what I mean.

325
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:30,633
Wow, that's some nifty luggage.

326
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,300
Oh, they're just hand-me-downs.

327
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:33,700
From who? Grace Kelly?

328
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,800
So what bag's your pants in?

329
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:40,300
Oh, I don't usually wear
pants when I'm going out.

330
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:41,700
Again, you're not going out.

331
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,400
You're walking to work.

332
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,300
You can borrow a pair from me.

333
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:49,500
There you go.

334
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:50,333
Thank you.

335
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,166
And that.

336
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,467
Just go back there.

337
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,200
Chicken parm.

338
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,467
My cousin brought it over

339
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,120
from his restaurant
on Mulberry Street.

340
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:02,533
It's 10 in the morning.

341
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:05,533
We rehearse six hours
a day, six days a week.

342
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,700
And then we do two shows a
day for a month straight.

343
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:11,100
That's a thousand high
kicks a day, Maggie.

344
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:13,309
You never know when you might
need a late night snack.

345
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,200
Isn't there a dining
room downstairs?

346
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,667
There is, but it's
always good to have backup.

347
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:20,834
That's better.

348
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,333
Oh good.

349
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,600
You two met.

350
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,033
You must be Margaret.

351
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,166
Maggie's fine.

352
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,567
I'm Alice, resident
advisor for the rookies.

353
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,567
Any problems, any
questions, you come to me.

354
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,976
I'm right here on
the fourth floor.

355
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,734
How many years have
you been a Rockette?

356
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:36,600
This is my 10th year.

357
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:38,266
Wow, I hope I
can last that long.

358
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,934
Oh, I'd do it
forever if I could.

359
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,567
So we are missing
one girl. Janet.

360
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,734
She's in 4C.

361
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,367
Oh, let's go say hello.

362
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Come on.

363
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:54,867
Want to come spruce up our room?

364
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,767
Not particularly.

365
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,734
Righto. Moving on.

366
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:58,907
I'm Sofia, this is Maggie.

367
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,233
I'm a bit of a talker, so you-

368
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,967
I'm going to stop
you right there.

369
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,500
No need to trade life stories.

370
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,500
Suit yourself.

371
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:06,934
How come she gets her own room?

372
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,667
There are three new
girls and two rooms.

373
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,266
The early bird catches the worm.

374
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,440
For the record, I believe
I got here before you did.

375
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:13,767
Did you?

376
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm sure I would have heard you.

377
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,834
So, Janet, where are you from.

378
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,934
Cleveland.

379
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:21,506
Again, don't take
this the wrong way,

380
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:23,133
but I'm not here
to make friends.

381
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:24,633
Is there a right
way to take that?

382
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,333
I'm here to make
a name for myself.

383
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,100
First stop, Rockettes;
next stop, Broadway.

384
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:30,943
You're going to want
to make friends, Janet.

385
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:33,166
It's one of the best parts
about being a Rockette.

386
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,767
We take care of each other.

387
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,767
We're like sisters.

388
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,020
I already have three sisters,

389
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:38,767
I don't need anymore.

390
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,767
Well, I think it's wonderful.

391
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,600
I've always wanted a sister.

392
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,600
How about you, Sofia?

393
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:45,867
You know, we should split.

394
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,367
We don't want to be late for
our first rehearsal, right?

395
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,200
Where is everybody?

396
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
There you are.

397
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:21,166
You were supposed to
come through the back.

398
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,767
Come this way.

399
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,433
We'll just go through here.

400
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:27,734
Don't be nervous.

401
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,200
Going to be an exciting day. ts

402
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,367
Hi, I'm Lillian.

403
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,166
Welcome to the Rockettes.

404
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,433
I'm Peggy.

405
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,066
And we were all in
your shoes once.

406
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,767
And there are a lot of shoes.

407
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,934
So many shoes.

408
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:07,767
But don't worry.

409
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,633
After your first season,

410
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,066
they'll be completely broken in.

411
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
The shoes or us?

412
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,700
Both.

413
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:14,834
All right, ladies.

414
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,433
Let's shake some of
that rust off, shall we?

415
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,066
Basic eye-high kick line

416
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,533
starting on your
stage right angle.

417
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,533
And a five, six, seven, eight.

418
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,233
A one, two, three, four,

419
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:26,767
five, six seven, eight.

420
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,367
A one, two.

421
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,700
Remember, your toe to your eye

422
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,433
every single time.

423
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,767
Six, seven, eight.

424
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,600
That's it.

425
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,033
Effortless.

426
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,433
Yes.

427
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:45,567
You'll be right there
alongside them soon enough.

428
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,066
Come on, we got to get
you up to wardrobe, hmm?

429
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,400
These are wonderful

430
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,700
and heavy.

431
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,266
Are you okay, Grandma?

432
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Mm.

433
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,300
I don't think it really
hit me until that moment.

434
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:04,333
I was a Rockette.

435
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:06,500
And a split second later,

436
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,433
we were more
nervous than before.

437
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Thank goodness we had Alice.

438
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:13,767
It's okay, ladies.

439
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,133
Drink a lot of
water, stay focused;

440
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:20,433
and most importantly,
have a ball.

441
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,100
You get to dance with
your best friends.

442
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,333
Day in and day out,

443
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,800
we're here for each other.

444
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:31,333
That's what makes
what we do so special.

445
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:32,600
All right.

446
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:34,467
Remember your spacing.

447
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:38,333
A one, two, three, four,

448
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,433
five, six, seven and eight.

449
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,467
Then one, two, three, four,

450
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,667
five, six, seven, eight.

451
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,633
Again.

452
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,934
A one, two, three, four,

453
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:50,100
five, six, seven, eight.

454
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,133
One, two, three, four,

455
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:54,166
five, six, seven, eight.

456
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,667
You can do better.

457
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,133
Again.

458
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:01,000
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven and eight.

459
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:05,834
A one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

460
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:06,834
Almost.

461
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,233
One more time.

462
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:12,166
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven and eight.

463
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,033
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

464
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,233
That's it!

465
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:21,834
Now, let's do that
100 more times.

466
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:26,166
Hey, I'm going easy on you
since it's your first day.

467
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,667
That was going easy on us?

468
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,367
Oh, I can't walk anymore.

469
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,200
I need a rest or a sandwich.

470
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,500
I know a good market a couple
blocks down with a deli.

471
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,667
A couple blocks?

472
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,500
Oh, come on.

473
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,166
We can do it.

474
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,500
I'm telling you,
Harriet, it's too early.

475
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:45,834
Oh, Robert,

476
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,776
it's never too early to
decorate for Christmas.

477
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,440
I think you'd put up
decorations in August

478
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
if I said yes.

479
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,400
Hey, knock it off.

480
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,166
We're not paying you
to take pictures.

481
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,533
You're not paying me at all.

482
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,009
Is that why you haven't
been to the barber?

483
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,000
It's called paying
your dues, son.

484
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,367
I did it, you are doing it,

485
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,333
and someday your kids will too.

486
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:07,587
First he'd ave to find a girl

487
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:08,676
he loves more than that camera.

488
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,734
Can it, Cuz.

489
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,500
Just calling it like I see it.

490
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:14,033
Ha! Hello, ladies.

491
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,726
Is there something
we can help you with?

492
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:17,509
We're just here to
pick up some sandwiches.

493
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:18,233
Oh, careful,

494
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:19,033
that one's got a handbag

495
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,176
and she's not afraid to use it.

496
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,834
Oh, it's you?

497
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,433
It is indeed I,

498
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,233
me.

499
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,166
You know each other?

500
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,667
Unofficially.

501
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,500
Then let's fix that.

502
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,000
I, I'm John.

503
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
And?

504
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:35,834
And, and you are?

505
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,567
I'm going to get some fruit.

506
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,567
Uh, can I help
you find anything?

507
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,233
Just the aforementioned fruit.

508
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:51,200
- Yeah.
- There it is.

509
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,367
Uh, the Jonagold apples are new.

510
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,400
Perfect for hot cider or
cold, uh, your choice.

511
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:58,533
Duly noted.

512
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:02,734
Uh, just to clarify,
this is my parents' store.

513
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:04,734
I, I, I work here.

514
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,042
I'm not just
following you around

515
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:09,633
trying to show off my
knowledge of seasonal produce.

516
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,633
And what about
Navy photographer?

517
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:13,734
Oh, oh, that too, until July.

518
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:16,400
And then a career in
high pressure fruit sales?

519
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,433
And then, uh,

520
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:21,633
I'm thinking of applying to NYU

521
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,767
to get a visual arts degree

522
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,600
and then start a career
as a photojournalist.

523
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,467
Well, I think that's
a wonderful idea.

524
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,934
NYU is a great-

525
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:33,600
Anyway, if you have
any more questions

526
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,233
about apples or anything else,

527
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:38,266
I'm your guy.

528
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,100
I'll keep that in mind.

529
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,000
I think I just might
need a sandwich every day

530
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,233
if it means looking in
those please eyes again.

531
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,100
I thought his eyes were brown.

532
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,409
I was talking about
the guy in a deli.

533
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:51,133
Who did you think I meant?

534
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,400
Oh, no one.

535
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:54,800
Don't look at me like that.

536
00:21:54,934 --> 00:21:56,400
I'm spoken for back home.

537
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:58,173
It took you an entire
day to mention that?

538
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,300
I'm just here to dance,

539
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:00,433
let's focus on that.

540
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,367
We're still waiting!

541
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,200
Hello?

542
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,133
We're still out here!

543
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:08,667
That's it, I'm going in.

544
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:10,667
Woo! Oh!

545
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,133
Oh.

546
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,333
I didn't realize
anyone was waiting.

547
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:18,667
Woo! Oh!

548
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,467
You used all the hot water!

549
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,967
You can run out of hot water?

550
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,100
Make sure your heads
are back on count five.

551
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:07,934
And just feel the fabric.

552
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:10,133
Don't hold onto each other, hmm?

553
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,500
You have exactly 78 seconds

554
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:31,834
to change from "Wooden Soldier"
costume to "Times Square,"

555
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:33,834
and that is the transition

556
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:37,200
that we are going to work
on for the rest of the day.

557
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,867
Positions.

558
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,467
And go.

559
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,700
All right, ladies.

560
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:51,834
All right.

561
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,266
Right gloves.

562
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,367
Zippers.

563
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,233
I got you.

564
00:23:58,367 --> 00:23:59,900
Janet!

565
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,233
Janet!

566
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,266
Five seconds!

567
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,066
Well,

568
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,800
almost all of you made it.

569
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:20,066
Now, just try it without looking

570
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,900
like you were run over
by Santa's sleigh.

571
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,633
To hear you're getting onisd

572
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,000
so well in the city.

573
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:35,200
Oh yes, I love it.

574
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,467
Kitty has invited me to all
sorts of wonderful lunches

575
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,133
and cocktail parties.

576
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:41,467
I'm meeting oodles
of important people,

577
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,720
people who could do business

578
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,834
with Father and
Maxwell's family.

579
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,700
Oh, how very
clever of your, dear.

580
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,100
In fact,

581
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:51,967
it's going so well I think I
should stay on a little longer.

582
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,800
Oh.

583
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:53,667
How long?

584
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,200
At least two weeks,

585
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,633
if that's all right with you.

586
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,633
Of course it's okay.

587
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,467
You're doing this
for your future.

588
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,567
What are you doing here?

589
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:15,033
Come with me.

590
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:17,033
Where are we going?

591
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:20,000
To get dessert and
talk, in that order.

592
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,300
See the way you're
all looking at me?

593
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:39,910
That's why I didn't
want to say anything.

594
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,334
I thought maybe
you came from money,

595
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:43,066
but I didn't think
you came from money

596
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,467
with a capital M.

597
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,367
I need you to
understand, I'm not rich,

598
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,033
my parents are.

599
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,242
And there's no point in
getting everyone all riled up,

600
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:53,133
I'm only here for one season.

601
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:55,700
And while I'm here,
I'm on my own.

602
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:57,667
Sure you are.

603
00:25:57,767 --> 00:25:59,400
Until things get hard, right?

604
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:01,700
Then you can go right
back to your real life.

605
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,033
This is the most real
thing I've ever done.

606
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:06,367
I'm just saying it must be
nice to have a safety net.

607
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,867
I have one more
thing to ask you,

608
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,133
it's very important.

609
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,266
Can I borrow that red coat

610
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,967
now that I know
that it's designer?

611
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:17,133
Of course.

612
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:31,266
You would have loved this.

613
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,133
Are you okay?

614
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,300
Of course.

615
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:44,533
You?

616
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:46,333
You have a sister?

617
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:49,767
Had.

618
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,033
A twin, actually.

619
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,567
She died a few years ago.

620
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,367
Being a Rockette was
our dream together.

621
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,743
The only thing that
was different about us

622
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:02,633
was I didn't have
a hole in my heart,

623
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,333
but now I do.

624
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:08,233
I'm so sorry, Sofia.

625
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,934
It must be so hard
being here without her.

626
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:13,367
I can't let it be hard, though.

627
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,260
I know if I fall apart,
my whole family will.

628
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,266
And I have to be
strong for everyone.

629
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,433
You don't have to do
that for us, though.

630
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:22,367
Remember what Mr.
Matthews and Alice said?

631
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
We're family now.

632
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,767
So far that's
been the best part.

633
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,934
Now, come on, let me help
you with that laundry.

634
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,066
Something tells me

635
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:37,500
you had somebody else
do this for you before.

636
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,300
Alice.

637
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,200
What is this?

638
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,433
Your paycheck.

639
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:45,533
But it's probably
pocket change to you.

640
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:49,000
Actually, I don't have
any of my own money left,

641
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,567
so this means everything.

642
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:00,934
I really like that green coat.

643
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:02,376
I like it when you wear
your green coat red

644
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,567
and I wear my red coat.

645
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,042
And then we just-
And then we look

646
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,109
like Christmas?
We look like Christmas.

647
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:07,173
After Thanksgiving?
Yeah.

648
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,609
You really have to
stop following me.

649
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:12,000
Sofia and I were just
doing a little shopping.

650
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:15,166
Well, if you need me,

651
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,667
I'll be in the shoe department

652
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,600
asking Santa for a pair
of two-tone Chanel pumps.

653
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,734
Looking for something specific?

654
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:25,176
I'm not sure what
I'm looking for.

655
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,667
Do you want to go inside?

656
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:34,667
Oh, not again.

657
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,934
I'm terribly sorry.

658
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:37,209
If it turns out
you're really a hitman,

659
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:39,266
you're not very good at it.

660
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:55,967
Excuse me.

661
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,266

I'll take it.

665
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,367
If you like, you
can put it on layaway

666
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
until Christmas Eve.

667
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,700
You put a little
toward it every week

668
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,533
until you've got
enough to buy it.

669
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,333
Oh, layaway.

670
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:19,633
Of course.

671
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,887
But I'm only here until
Christmas, is that enough time?

672
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,309
It depends on how
much you put in?

673
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,533
You're not staying in New York?

674
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,166
I'm only dancing the one season.

675
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,133

Yeah.

680
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,934
But it's pretty close to
perfect right here too.

681
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,400
I should probably tell you.

682
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,700
There's somebody waiting
for me back home.

683
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:59,200
You don't need to tell me that.

684
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,834
I don't?

685
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,834
I'm leaving soon, too, remember?

686
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,967
And then NYU.

687
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,834
If I had it my way, yes.

688
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,033
I'd be learning from
the best of the best.

689
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:11,967
Every class is taught
by photographers

690
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,967
who have won Pulitzers

691
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,967
or have their work on the
cover of "National Geographic"

692
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,467
or the front page
at the "Times."

693
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,300
It sounds like the
opportunity of a lifetime.

694
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,166
Not if you ask my folks.

695
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,643
If they knew I
wanted to do anything

696
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,233
other than take over the store,

697
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,133
they'd think I'm
abandoning them.

698
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:31,266
But you're not.

699
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:33,734
You're following your dream.

700
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,700
Imagine how much you'll regret
it if you don't even try.

701
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:41,133
I might not even get in.

702
00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:42,967
Then you take a different path.

703
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,033
It's not always that simple.

704
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,333
What would you have done

705
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:47,827
if you didn't get
cast in the show?

706
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,400
I'd find a way to keep dancing.

707
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,533
But it wouldn't be like this.

708
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,333
In my wildest dreams

709
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,233
I didn't think my life
could ever be like this.

710
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,734
Yet here you are.

711
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,166
Here I am.

712
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:09,266
I should probably go find Sofia.

713
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,867
Oh, right.

714
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,800
Of course.

715
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:14,867
So I'll see you
around the neighborhood?

716
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,033
Just warn me when you're nearby

717
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,200
so I can put on a helmet.

718
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,300
Janet, you have to
rock up on your heels

719
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,042
and make sure you have control
of the girl in front of you.

720
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:37,166
- I'm trying.
- Good.

721
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,166
Just open your arms so the
girl behind you can follow.

722
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,934
Okay, everyone,
attention please.

723
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:50,467
The "Christmas Spectacular"
opens in four days.

724
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,800
But before that,

725
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:53,467
some of you will be dancing

726
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,333
in the Thanksgiving Day parade.

727
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,367
Don't you want
to see who got in?

728
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
I know we didn't.

729
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:07,247
Only half the girls
perform, and we're new.

730
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,900
Actually, a lot of
the veteran dancers

731
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:10,200
go home for Thanksgiving.

732
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,066
There we are!

733
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,176
Alice, you're not spending
Thanksgiving with your family?

734
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,000
This is my family.

735
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:21,133
I'm curious.

736
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,509
What does your family
think you're doing?

737
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:25,900
They think I'm in the
Hamptons with Kitty and her cousins.

738
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:27,667
What if they see you on TV?

739
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
They won't.

740
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:30,594
I'm the only one who
ever watches the parade.

741
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:36,533
So everybody won't get along.

742
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,900
Back for
their second year in a row,

743
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:44,533
here are the world famous
Radio City Music Hall Rockettes

744
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:47,200
now celebrating
their 33rd season.

745
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,533
That's Sofia.

746
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:51,667
Man-
The Rockettes

747
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,433
have been high kicking and-

748
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:53,643
She's something, isn't she?

749
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,033
Since 1925.

750
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,333
She's incredible.

751
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:58,367
Look at these
talented ladies having a ball.

752
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,066
I still think we
should have insisted

753
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,500
Margaret come home for
Thanksgiving dinner.

754
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:05,834
Oh, she's hobnobbing with
New York's elite, dear.

755
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:07,934
She's doing it for the family.

756
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:09,300
I suppose you're right.

757
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,834
Dessert party, fourth floor.

758
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:26,767
You coming?

759
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,266
Actually, I think
I'll take a walk.

760
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,667
I want to take in as much
of the city as I can.

761
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,066
Who knows if I'll ever be
here on Thanksgiving again?

762
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,667
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Miss.
- Excuse-

763
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,400
I suppose we're even then.

764
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,066
Well played, sir.

765
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,467
You think I plotted my revenge

766
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,467
on the off chance

767
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,843
you'd be wandering
the Christmas tree lot

768
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:12,967
three blocks from your
apartment on Thanksgiving night?

769
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,100
Maybe.

770
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:16,633
Okay, son, were paid up.

771
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:17,900
Oh, Pops, this is Maggie.

772
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:19,343
She's one of the new
Rockettes this year.

773
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:20,033
Oh.

774
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,333
Nice to meet you, young lady.

775
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:22,834
Nice to meet you.

776
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:24,333
Let's get this
tree back to market.

777
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:25,333
Gimme a minute, and I'll help.

778
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:26,567
What?

779
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,943
You don't think we
can carry a tree.

780
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,300
We're not that old.

781
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:30,433
You stay.

782
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:33,367
All right.

783
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:41,166
So can I help you
pick out a tree?

784
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,333
There's one.

785
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:43,600
Oh, there's another one.

786
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:47,000
We don't really have room
for a tree on our floor.

787
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:48,567
You got to have
a tree somewhere.

788
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,166
We are living and
breathing Christmas

789
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,567
all day at the theater.

790
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,767
I think we're covered.

791
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:58,500
I was actually just going on a
Christmas-in-New-York stroll.

792
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:00,467
I want to take in as
much of the city as I can

793
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,767
while I'm still here.

794
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,467
You shouldn't be walking
around the city alone at night.

795
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,467
I'd be happy to take you around,

796
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,567
purely for safety reasons.

797
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,700
That's all?

798
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:12,033
Well, it can't be
more than that, right?

799
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,300
No.

800
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:14,433
Just friends.

801
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:17,300
Then yes.

802
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:18,433
It's for safety.

803
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:28,867
Two, please.

804
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:35,166
Do you have pecans?

805
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:41,066
I just don't think anyone
actually likes chestnuts, is all.

806
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,400
It's a New York City
Christmas tradition.

807
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:45,400
Also, the song isn't:

808
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:47,734
♪ Pecans roasting
on an open fire ♪

809
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:50,367
Wait, hang on.

810
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:52,033
You love chestnuts.

811
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,033
You always say
they're your favorite.

812
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:58,567
Hmm, that's because
of what happened next.

813
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,300
It's so beautiful.

814
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:05,633
The only thing missing
is a little snow.

815
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:07,000
I can make that happen.

816
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,033
How in the world
did you do that?

817
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:15,300
I can always sense
when it's about to snow.

818
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:16,700
It's a special talent of mine.

819
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:17,834
Oh.

820
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:22,800
Mine's knowing when someone's
not telling the truth.

821
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:25,533
All right, fine.

822
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:26,667
It was dumb luck.

823
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:28,567
Oh, by the way,

824
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:31,200
you were wonderful in
the parade this morning.

825
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,333
Thank you.

826
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,734
I love how people react to
the first few flakes of snow.

827
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,100
It's like they're kids again.

828
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,667
You can see it in their face.

829
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:47,166
What?

830
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,300
You see things
other people don't,

831
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:52,066
that's your real special skill.

832
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,420
I think it's what makes
you a great photographer.

833
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,433
Very impressive.

834
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:12,576
How did you get
him to play that?

835
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,160
I promised him a
pair of my house seats.

836
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,367
Oh.

837
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,867
Already bartering
with the vendors.

838
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,166
You really are
becoming a New Yorker.

839
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,943
Don't you have friends and
family who want to use 'em.

840
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,247
I'm sure they're
so proud of you.

841
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,367
I'd like to think so.

842
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,433
You don't always have
to take pictures.

843
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:39,934
You can join in the fun.

844
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:40,867
Ah, no.

845
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,767
I'm not much of a dancer.

846
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,433
Well, I am.

847
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:46,333
And I don't want to miss
out on any Christmas magic.

848
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:47,467
Come on.

849
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:49,834
Come on.

850
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:51,633
All right. Okay.

851
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:55,400
But I apologize in advance
for when I step on your toes.

852
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,667
Oh no.

853
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
What time is it?

854
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,300
Oh no, I'm going to miss curfew.

855
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,300
I have to go,

856
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:34,567
but thank you for the
company and the dance

857
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
and everything.

858
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,066
Anytime.

859
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
I mean that.

860
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:49,567
♪ ♪

861
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:04,567
♪ ♪

862
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,066
Wonderful show, ladies.

863
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,533
1 down, 99 to go.

864
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:43,000
That's so many.

865
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:46,633
I'm so glad we only had to
do the first two shows today.

866
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:47,810
We finally have the evening off.

867
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:48,633
What shall we do?

868
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:49,533
How about we grab a bite?

869
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:50,734
Okay. Where?

870
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:51,867
You know where.

871
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,133
Okay, missy,

872
00:40:54,266 --> 00:40:56,076
it's been a week since
your little evening stroll

873
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,900
with a certain Navy man.

874
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:00,633
Something happened and
you haven't said a word.

875
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:01,976
Time to let the
cat out of the bag.

876
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,867
There is no cat.

877
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,800
Please.

878
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:05,100
It's a lion.

879
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:06,233
Talk.

880
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,633
We just ran into each other.

881
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:10,934
We're friends, that's all.

882
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,233
I don't look at my
friends like that.

883
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,600
What are you doing here?

884
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:20,467
You said you didn't have a tree

885
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
so brought you a tree.

886
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:23,734
Oh, well, uh,

887
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:24,967
Ben and I.

888
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,800
What's this?

889
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:27,300
A Christmas tree.

890
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:29,033
Thanks. But I'm Jewish.

891
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:30,367
Rose, what do you say?

892
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,800
Can they bring it in?

893
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:32,767
No men allowed.

894
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,367
What about delivery men?

895
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,300
I can throw in a
sandwich, make it legit.

896
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:38,600
Corned beef?

897
00:41:38,734 --> 00:41:40,033
Of course.

898
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,600
Extra lean.

899
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:44,300
I guess a little holiday
spirit never hurt anyone.

900
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:45,473
Common room, only you two.

901
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,700
No shenanigans.

902
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:49,633
Oh, that one's really pretty.

903
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:50,810
- Right?
- Yeah, I like that one.

904
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:52,367
I like this
one, the texture of it.

905
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:00,467
Janet, don't you want to help?

906
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,000
I need to rest.

907
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:05,133
Come on.

908
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:06,834
It's fine.

909
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,600
Struffoli?

910
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,200
I asked around,

911
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:20,066
got a recipe from a friend
of a friend in Little Italy.

912
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,700
This is the best Christmas ever.

913
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,100
I'm not sure your fella at
home would like to hear that.

914
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:27,900
I'm not sure he'd even ask.

915
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,280
What's your favorite color?

916
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,066
Blue, why?

917
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,600
Middle name?

918
00:42:34,734 --> 00:42:35,867
Alan.

919
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,367
And what brings
you the most joy?

920
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,567
Why all the questions?

921
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Just humor me.

922
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:45,700
Okay.

923
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:46,834
I'll show you.

924
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:53,967
I just got these developed.

925
00:42:57,834 --> 00:42:59,400
The last few were my favorite.

926
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:09,800
This is unlike any
photo I've ever been in.

927
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:12,867
My family usually
sits posed, formal.

928
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
I've never seen myself
like this before.

929
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,033
It's how I saw you from
the second I met you.

930
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:23,100
You are very talented.

931
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:26,834
Have your parents seen these?

932
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:27,767
Not yet.

933
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,333
What are you waiting for?

934
00:43:29,467 --> 00:43:30,600
Then they'll understand

935
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,834
why you want this
to be your future.

936
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:35,000
You owe it to them, to yourself.

937
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:39,433
I know, but it's going
to break their hearts.

938
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:43,367
Just waiting for the right time.

939
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:46,133
Maybe the right time is now.

940
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:48,633
Hm.

941
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,600
When I go home after Christmas,

942
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:55,667
things are going to change.

943
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,934
Haven't they already?

944
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:01,834
Okay.

945
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:03,233
We're all set.

946
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:04,767
Who wants to do the honors?

947
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:09,100
I think Janet should do it.

948
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:12,400
Janet!

949
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:13,533
You've got it.

950
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,000
Merry Christmas.

951
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,500
Thank you.

952
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:48,266
Are you okay, Alice?

953
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,300
Yes, I'm fine.

954
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,500
You don't look fine.

955
00:44:57,533 --> 00:45:00,066
You know, I've been
dancing since I could walk.

956
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,166
I thought I'd be able
to do this forever.

957
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:08,400
And now it's time to start
thinking about what's next.

958
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,400
And I don't know what that is.

959
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,700
Dearest Mother and Father:

960
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:24,467
All is well on the
Upper East Side.

961
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
I've made some
wonderful new friends,

962
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:28,266
and every night we're dressed

963
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,934
in the most glittering
dresses you can imagine.

964
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:33,567
I'm really making a mark here.

965
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,133
Did you see me almost fall?

966
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:45,433
Oh, no one noticed...

967
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:48,467
We were all mesmerized at
Santa trying to do a high kick.

968
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,633
Margaret, you were wonderful.

969
00:45:51,767 --> 00:45:52,767
Kitty!

970
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:53,867
Just give a minute.

971
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:55,266
Margaret?

972
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,800
Ah, I didn't realize
you were coming tonight.

973
00:45:57,934 --> 00:45:59,066
I wanted to surprise you.

974
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,200
I had no idea how
talented you are.

975
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,333
You have to tell your
family about this.

976
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,242
They'll understand once
they see you up there.

977
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:06,800
No, they won't.

978
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,800
Just please don't say anything

979
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,800
until after the show is over,

980
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,700
then I'll take
care of everything.

981
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:14,533
It's getting harder
to cover for you.

982
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:16,033
I'll buy time.

983
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:18,142
I'll tell Mother your aunt's
still on the design phase.

984
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,300
Oh, for goodness' sake.

985
00:46:19,433 --> 00:46:20,953
You haven't even met
my Aunt Gabriella.

986
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,700
You are still getting
married, aren't you?

987
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:24,133
Of course I am.

988
00:46:24,266 --> 00:46:26,333
I'll make an appointment
for next week.

989
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:27,166
Good.

990
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,300
Now, where should we get drinks?

991
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,033
I can't go out, Kitty.

992
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,476
I'm going home and
straight to bed.

993
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,166
We have an early
performance tomorrow.

994
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,700
Well, then I guess
I see you next time

995
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:37,967
you need to use my phone

996
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,633
or collect your mail

997
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:42,467
or need help lying to your
fiance and your family.

998
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,800
I'm sorry, Kitty.

999
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,700
It's more complicated than
I thought it would be.

1000
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:49,633
Are you going to say
anything to them?

1001
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:51,500
No.

1002
00:46:51,633 --> 00:46:52,700
But you should.

1003
00:46:52,834 --> 00:46:54,066
You owe them the truth.

1004
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:02,233
Are you okay?

1005
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:03,700
No.

1006
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,867
I don't know why I thought
I could pull this off.

1007
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,767
What was I thinking?

1008
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,033
This isn't me.

1009
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:12,100
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

1010
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:13,900
Well, one thing's for sure.

1011
00:47:14,033 --> 00:47:15,967
You're definitely not Margaret.

1012
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:20,066
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1013
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:28,166
Okay.

1014
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:33,567
Places, ladies.

1015
00:48:30,967 --> 00:48:33,667
Yeah!

1016
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,100
Wow.

1017
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:41,800
Hey.

1018
00:48:41,934 --> 00:48:44,367
Oh, you were incredible, Maggie,

1019
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,567
just stunning.

1020
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,066
Yeah.

1021
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,633
I'm not one for dancing,
but that was pretty great.

1022
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:50,767
Thank you.

1023
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:53,076
I didn't realize you
were coming tonight.

1024
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,242
Well, we wanted to surprise you,

1025
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:56,800
but I think you
surprised me even more.

1026
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,800
And you were wonderful.

1027
00:48:58,934 --> 00:49:00,133
I'm glad you liked it.

1028
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:02,700
Are you okay?

1029
00:49:02,834 --> 00:49:03,467
I'm fine.

1030
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,266
I just have a lot of my mind.

1031
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,409
I have another show to do soon

1032
00:49:06,433 --> 00:49:08,266
so I have to go back
inside and get ready.

1033
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,880
We should get back
to the market, son.

1034
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:11,934
I want to show you how
we close out the books

1035
00:49:12,066 --> 00:49:12,800
at the end of the year.

1036
00:49:12,934 --> 00:49:14,367
All right.

1037
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,100
Congratulations, Maggie.

1038
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:17,233
Thank you.

1039
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:21,533
So you haven't told them?

1040
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,433
No, but before you say anything,

1041
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:26,867
I know it's not fair to leave
them in the dark like this.

1042
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,367
But if I don't get in NYU,

1043
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,033
then there's nothing
to tell them.

1044
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:32,367
I'll be working at the
store just like they wanted.

1045
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,867
So that's it?

1046
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,400
Either you give in or you
give up on your dream?

1047
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,367
If you really wanted this,

1048
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,767
you'd find a way
to make it happen.

1049
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,100
You're right.

1050
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:43,700
I do.

1051
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:46,967
And seeing you up there
makes me even more determined

1052
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,467
to make my dreams come true,

1053
00:49:49,934 --> 00:49:51,033
just like you.

1054
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:11,367
You'll never guess

1055
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,600
who's on the roll
call list for tonight.

1056
00:50:13,734 --> 00:50:15,367
Frankie Avalon.

1057
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
How'd you know?

1058
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:17,233
Wait.

1059
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:18,367
It really is Frank-

1060
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
He's coming.

1061
00:50:21,033 --> 00:50:22,676
I am going to make
him fall in love with me

1062
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,700
from the stage.

1063
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:25,700
Oh, what about your
boyfriend back home?

1064
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:28,100
Hey, until there's
a ring on my finger,

1065
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,233
all bets are off.

1066
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,600
Good thing you aren't
engaged to Maxwell, huh?

1067
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:33,433
Why do you say that?

1068
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:35,200
You know why?

1069
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:36,700
Actually, no.

1070
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:39,133
I don't know why you keep
pushing this John thing.

1071
00:50:40,567 --> 00:50:43,367
Right now I'm focused
on the show, that's all.

1072
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,400
Please, I see the
way you look at him.

1073
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:47,266
I look at Ben the same way.

1074
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,476
And you never look like that
when you talk about Maxwell,

1075
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,100
which, by the way,
is almost never.

1076
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:53,400
That's not love.

1077
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:55,033
I didn't come here for love.

1078
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,033
Maybe it's one of the
reasons you should stay.

1079
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,400
How are your parents?

1080
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:02,834
They're fine.

1081
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:05,007
You will be home for the
Christmas party, won't you?

1082
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:07,600
It's practically the same
guest list as our wedding.

1083
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,767
Oh, and be sure to
stop at Tiffany's first

1084
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,667
and pick yourself out
on a nice present.

1085
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,934
You mean a present from you?

1086
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:17,100
You know what you like
much more than I do.

1087
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:19,000
I don't want to
disappoint you, darling.

1088
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:20,967
So I'll see you in two weeks.

1089
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,133
Of course.

1090
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:23,266
Well, goodbye then.

1091
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,400
Goodbye.

1092
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,266
Maggie, would you go out
there and talk to your friend?

1093
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,710
He's been circling
the block all day

1094
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:41,333
like like Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1095
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:42,633
I didn't see anyone.

1096
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:49,000
Hello?

1097
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:49,834
Oh, what a coincidence.

1098
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:51,109
I just happened to be walking by

1099
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:53,367
and here you are.

1100
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,876
Rose said you've been
hanging around all day.

1101
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,700
Yeah, I didn't say how
many times I walked by.

1102
00:51:58,133 --> 00:51:59,700
I know this show
is dark tonight.

1103
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:00,954
And you said you hadn't gone

1104
00:52:01,066 --> 00:52:02,834
to see the Rockefeller
Center tree yet.

1105
00:52:02,967 --> 00:52:04,734
And I wanted to take
some more photos there

1106
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:06,734
before I send off my portfolio,

1107
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:09,934
so I thought maybe
we could go together.

1108
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:12,633
Unless you already went.

1109
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,700
No.

1110
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:15,109
Even though it's so
close to the theater,

1111
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,867
we always had a show, or curfew,

1112
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,000
until tonight.

1113
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:21,367
Then I guess it's fate.

1114
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:24,066
It just might be.

1115
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,033
But it's so complicated, John,

1116
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:29,734
for both of us.

1117
00:52:29,867 --> 00:52:30,567
The timing-

1118
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,700
Is all wrong.

1119
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:33,900
I know.

1120
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:35,176
I'm not asking for anything more

1121
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,166
than one more stroll
with a friend.

1122
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:01,600
Are you okay?

1123
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:04,433
I will be.

1124
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,574
I suppose you want to
take a picture of me

1125
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,467
having this big
emotional moment.

1126
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,600
No.

1127
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,467
This one's just for us.

1128
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:21,400
You know I can't.

1129
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:22,533
I know.

1130
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:28,433
But whatever happens,
and wherever we end up,

1131
00:53:30,033 --> 00:53:31,153
we can always close our eyes

1132
00:53:31,266 --> 00:53:34,066
and be right back here.

1133
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,600
What if I don't want
to just imagine it?

1134
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:45,767
Then I guess you have
a decision to make.

1135
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,166
There you are.

1136
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,420
I thought I was going to have

1137
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,743
to send down a
knotted sheet for you

1138
00:54:01,767 --> 00:54:03,700
in case Rose locked the doors.

1139
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:04,867
Where were you?

1140
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,133
I was on a walk with John.

1141
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:09,266
Did John give you that?

1142
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,333
Of course not.

1143
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:12,834
Maxwell did.

1144
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:14,033
What? When?

1145
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,867
About a year ago.

1146
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,133
Wait a minute.

1147
00:54:18,266 --> 00:54:20,367
So this whole time
you've been engaged?

1148
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,467
Why didn't you tell me
that in the first place

1149
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,133
or literally every other
time we talked about Maxwell?

1150
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:27,200
I thought I'd come to New York

1151
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:30,000
and do the show and go
back to my real life.

1152
00:54:31,767 --> 00:54:34,400
Maggie, does John
know you're engaged?

1153
00:54:34,533 --> 00:54:35,700
No.

1154
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:38,700
But I'm going to tell him
right after I talk to my parents.

1155
00:54:38,834 --> 00:54:40,409
I've already decided I'm
calling them in the morning

1156
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:41,867
and telling them everything.

1157
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Good.

1158
00:54:44,266 --> 00:54:45,033
Anything else you
want to tell me

1159
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:47,033
that you've held
back this whole time?

1160
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,233
I don't like chicken parm.

1161
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:54,033
Okay, that's just not funny.

1162
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:59,133
Now let me try on the rock.

1163
00:54:59,266 --> 00:55:00,300
Oh my gosh.

1164
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:01,433
Oh.

1165
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,467
Oh, a lot of women would
kill for a life like yours.

1166
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,133
Are you sure you
want to do this?

1167
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,066
Maggie, your friend Kitty's
in the lobby looking for you.

1168
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:16,133
At eight in the morning?

1169
00:55:16,266 --> 00:55:17,367
Kitty?

1170
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,700
Hi.

1171
00:55:18,834 --> 00:55:19,633
I thought our appointment
with your aunt

1172
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:20,567
wasn't until this afternoon.

1173
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,633
No matter, I was going
to cancel anyway.

1174
00:55:22,767 --> 00:55:23,767
You were right.

1175
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,142
It's time for me to tell
my family the truth.

1176
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:26,576
I'm calling them
right after breakfast.

1177
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,300
Margaret, stop.

1178
00:55:27,433 --> 00:55:28,600
That's why I came here.

1179
00:55:28,734 --> 00:55:30,200
You don't have to
call your parents.

1180
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:31,467
Why not?

1181
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,300
Because they're on their
way to my apartment right now.

1182
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,133
Oh no!

1183
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:39,200
That's exactly what I said.

1184
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:40,633
What did you do?

1185
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,900
Let's go back down, and
I'll tell you on the way.

1186
00:55:50,467 --> 00:55:51,633
I do hope my Margaret

1187
00:55:51,767 --> 00:55:54,000
hasn't been too much
extra work for you.

1188
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:55,133
Margaret's been a dream.

1189
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:56,967
You'd barely know she was here.

1190
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:02,100
Oh, well, the
apartment is stunning.

1191
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,834
Kitty, you have made a
wonderful home for you and Stewart.

1192
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:07,367
So where is the young man?

1193
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,567
Oh, he's away on
business until Christmas.

1194
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,734
That's why it's been so
nice having Margaret here.

1195
00:56:12,867 --> 00:56:14,387
Well, ladies, the
coffee was delicious,

1196
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:17,333
but I'm ready to go out for
a big New York breakfast.

1197
00:56:17,467 --> 00:56:18,900
So what's good around here?

1198
00:56:21,867 --> 00:56:23,667
The hotel has a fine restaurant.

1199
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,109
Why don't you get
checked in, eat,

1200
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:26,293
and I'll meet you after that?

1201
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,367
Well, why can't
you come with us?

1202
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,500
I

1203
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:31,600
Have an appointment

1204
00:56:33,133 --> 00:56:35,066
to taste different
flavors of wedding cake.

1205
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,667
Margaret,

1206
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,000
you know we have a perfectly
wonderful pastry chef

1207
00:56:39,133 --> 00:56:40,200
back home.

1208
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:41,400
Of course.

1209
00:56:41,533 --> 00:56:43,609
I just thought this way I
could narrow down our options.

1210
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,834
Oh, that's an excellent idea.

1211
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:46,667
I'll go with you.

1212
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,800
Oh, that's okay!

1213
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:52,500
I know you don't like
sweets in the morning.

1214
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:53,734
I'll tell you what,

1215
00:56:53,867 --> 00:56:54,734
you go with Father,

1216
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:56,000
I'll go to the tasting,

1217
00:56:56,133 --> 00:56:57,293
and I'll meet you at Gimbels.

1218
00:56:57,367 --> 00:56:59,166
Say, 2:00 PM?

1219
00:56:59,300 --> 00:56:59,967
Great!

1220
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,300
I have to get going.

1221
00:57:13,233 --> 00:57:14,233
Taxi!

1222
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:20,533
I know, I have a lot
of explaining to do.

1223
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:22,133
Actually, you don't.

1224
00:57:22,266 --> 00:57:23,567
I caught everyone up.

1225
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,980
You're my new
favorite soap opera

1226
00:57:25,033 --> 00:57:26,200
after "Guiding Light."

1227
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:28,734
I should have told you all
everything from the beginning.

1228
00:57:28,867 --> 00:57:32,300
It's just you already
looked at me differently

1229
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:35,300
once you found out I, I
came from money, and...

1230
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:44,066
I was afraid if you
girls knew I was engaged

1231
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,433
and not planning on
coming back to the show,

1232
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:49,233
I would be even
more of an outsider.

1233
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:50,967
You're not leaving
the show now, are you?

1234
00:57:51,033 --> 00:57:52,166
I don't want to.

1235
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:54,734
But once my family finds out-

1236
00:57:54,867 --> 00:57:55,976
Wait, you still
haven't told them?

1237
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,700
No, I had to rush right here.

1238
00:57:57,834 --> 00:57:58,967
Uffa!

1239
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,533
Half hour ladies.

1240
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:02,633
This is your half hour call.

1241
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:03,800
Ready?

1242
00:58:03,934 --> 00:58:05,367
To do the show?

1243
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,533
Yes.

1244
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:08,000
To talk to my parents?

1245
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:10,533
It doesn't matter if I'm ready,

1246
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:11,667
it's now or never.

1247
00:58:15,467 --> 00:58:16,667
Oh good.

1248
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,843
I forgot to show you one more
thing with the payroll taxes.

1249
00:58:17,867 --> 00:58:20,300
I have something I
want to show you first.

1250
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:30,333
What's this?

1251
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:34,266
It's my application for
NYU's Fine Arts program

1252
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,834
for when I get out of the Navy.

1253
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:37,500
You won't have time for college.

1254
00:58:37,633 --> 00:58:39,266
You'll be too busy here.

1255
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,767
Well, that's the thing.

1256
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,934
I, I'm not sure this is
where I'm meant to end up.

1257
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:47,166
So you'd rather take
pictures of Christmas trees

1258
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,667
than carry on the
family's legacy?

1259
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,934
It's not about Christmas.

1260
00:58:50,066 --> 00:58:52,133
It's about me being
a photojournalist,

1261
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,600
professionally.

1262
00:58:55,734 --> 00:58:57,042
I, I, I got a real
knack for it, Pop.

1263
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,166
You have a responsibility
to this family.

1264
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,233
Ben is family too.

1265
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:02,476
And he would make you so proud

1266
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,676
if you just gave him a chance.

1267
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,367
It says Slater
and Son, that's you.

1268
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,900
We work night and day to
have this, to give it to you,

1269
00:59:09,033 --> 00:59:11,033
and now you want to
just throw it all away?

1270
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:12,176
That's not what I'm doing.

1271
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,840
I'm trying to do what's
best for everyone.

1272
01:00:01,533 --> 01:00:02,700
Taxi!

1273
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:12,033
Oh, this is so much better.

1274
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,700
Now, while your
father is not with us,

1275
01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:19,200
I perhaps will buy
his Christmas gift.

1276
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,400
And you should get
something from Maxwell.

1277
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,166
Maggie.

1278
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,367
I'm so sorry, Mr. Matthews.

1279
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,734
Something is obviously
going on with you.

1280
01:00:40,867 --> 01:00:41,967
You can talk to me.

1281
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,934
My parents are here.

1282
01:00:45,066 --> 01:00:47,009
They think I'm in New York
to have a wedding dress made,

1283
01:00:47,033 --> 01:00:48,393
and they don't know
I'm a Rockette.

1284
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,567
They would never approve.

1285
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,533
And I'm afraid of
what will happen

1286
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:51,667
if I tell them the truth.

1287
01:00:52,533 --> 01:00:53,834
At some point, Maggie,

1288
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:55,834
you're going to
have to just let go

1289
01:00:55,967 --> 01:00:58,333
of what other people
expect you to be

1290
01:00:58,467 --> 01:00:59,867
and just be who you are.

1291
01:01:06,934 --> 01:01:08,100
Take the rest of the day off,

1292
01:01:08,233 --> 01:01:10,066
we'll have a swing
cover for you,

1293
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,834
and go do what you have
to do for yourself.

1294
01:01:14,767 --> 01:01:16,266
Hmm?

1295
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,767
Thank you.

1296
01:01:21,266 --> 01:01:23,266
I don't know, she's...

1297
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,967
Oh, you look much
better now, dear.

1298
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,100
Are you ready for dinner?

1299
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:28,233
Yes.

1300
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:30,266
But I've been trying to
reach Maxwell all day.

1301
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,567
I've tried him at the
office, the club, his house.

1302
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:35,467
I think you'll be able
to reach him very soon.

1303
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,633
Can we ask for a quiet table?

1304
01:01:37,767 --> 01:01:39,843
I really need to talk to you
about something important.

1305
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:43,633
Actually, we already have
a table right over there.

1306
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:57,100
Are you surprised, darling?

1307
01:01:57,233 --> 01:01:58,233
You have no idea.

1308
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,700
Thank you.

1309
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:09,066
Just in time.

1310
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,734
Would you like a
cocktail, darling?

1311
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:11,567
Ah, yes.

1312
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,900
A double old fashioned, please.

1313
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:13,967
Easy on the water.

1314
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,900
Isn't that basically
a straight bourbon?

1315
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:17,033
Is it?

1316
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:24,367
Mother, Father, Maxwell,

1317
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,600
I have something to tell you
about my time here in New York.

1318
01:02:29,633 --> 01:02:33,233
Wait, before you do, I
have something for you.

1319
01:02:33,367 --> 01:02:34,734
An early Christmas gift.

1320
01:02:34,867 --> 01:02:35,900
Thank you, Maxwell.

1321
01:02:36,033 --> 01:02:37,309
I'll open it right
after we talk.

1322
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:38,400
Open it now.

1323
01:02:38,533 --> 01:02:40,500
Don't be rude.

1324
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:47,533
You couldn't stop
talking about them

1325
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:50,166
after you saw them
at the parade.

1326
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,000
So as much as I loath going
to any sort of ballet.

1327
01:02:54,467 --> 01:02:58,367
I figured I could grin and
bear it for one night, for you.

1328
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:01,266
See, they're for Christmas Eve.

1329
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:04,066
Look at her.

1330
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,600
She's so happy.

1331
01:03:05,734 --> 01:03:07,300
She's speechless.

1332
01:03:07,433 --> 01:03:09,567
Thank you, Maxwell.

1333
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,467
It really was very thoughtful.

1334
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,900
I can get you something else

1335
01:03:13,033 --> 01:03:14,266
if you don't want to go.

1336
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,400
Oh no.

1337
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,934
I'm definitely going because,

1338
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,367
because

1339
01:03:26,033 --> 01:03:27,734
I'm in the show.

1340
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:29,066
Uh,

1341
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:29,900
I'm sorry.

1342
01:03:30,033 --> 01:03:32,467
I, I don't understand.

1343
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,333
That's what I
wanted to tell you.

1344
01:03:35,533 --> 01:03:37,900
I didn't come to New York
to have a wedding dress made

1345
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:40,066
or register for gifts

1346
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,166
or make connections
or visit Kitty.

1347
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:45,133
I came here because
back in October,

1348
01:03:45,266 --> 01:03:49,734
I auditioned for the
Rockettes and they picked me.

1349
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:50,900
I'm sorry.

1350
01:03:51,033 --> 01:03:53,100
I think I, I'm
missing the joke here.

1351
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:54,900
This isn't a joke.

1352
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:56,967
I really am a Rockette.

1353
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,400
Stop it, Margaret.

1354
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,800
We know you'd never
do such a thing.

1355
01:04:01,934 --> 01:04:03,533
Just come to the show.

1356
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:04,667
See for yourself.

1357
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:10,133
This isn't something
to be ashamed of,

1358
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:12,000
it's something to be proud of.

1359
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:15,867
Oh, now look what you've done.

1360
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,900
You've upset your mother.

1361
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:24,667
Is this all true?

1362
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,767
This life we planned,

1363
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,533
we didn't plan it for
ourselves, did we?

1364
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:32,433
This was all put
together by our families.

1365
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:34,433
Are you really okay
with marrying someone

1366
01:04:34,567 --> 01:04:35,633
you don't even love?

1367
01:04:35,767 --> 01:04:36,767
Darling,

1368
01:04:37,734 --> 01:04:40,500
I'm not sure anyone in our
position marries for love.

1369
01:04:40,633 --> 01:04:42,166
Because if I'm being honest,

1370
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,300
I don't believe true
love exists at all.

1371
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,233
But it does, Maxwell.

1372
01:04:49,633 --> 01:04:52,400
And I think we both deserve
the chance to find it.

1373
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:54,667
I see.

1374
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:03,467
I'm sorry, Max.

1375
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:09,900
Don't be sorry, darling.

1376
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,400
You're happy here.

1377
01:05:13,533 --> 01:05:15,867
How can I be upset about that?

1378
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,867
Thank you.

1379
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,867
So are you ever coming home?

1380
01:05:30,066 --> 01:05:31,734
I think I am home.

1381
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Max?

1382
01:05:43,233 --> 01:05:44,567
Where's he going?

1383
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,266
Back to Philadelphia, I imagine.

1384
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,266
Good.

1385
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,200
We'll stop by Kitty's,

1386
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:49,433
pick up your things,

1387
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,167
and we can all catch
the last train home.

1388
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,400
My things aren't at Kitty's,

1389
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,300
they're at a women's
boarding house.

1390
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:58,233
And I'm not going back with you.

1391
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,633
I'm staying in New
York, permanently.

1392
01:06:01,767 --> 01:06:03,667
But that's preposterous.

1393
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,266
You can't make it in
this city by yourself.

1394
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,433
Yes, I can.

1395
01:06:08,567 --> 01:06:10,333
But you're giving
up your future.

1396
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,633
And for what?

1397
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,100
To dance?

1398
01:06:13,233 --> 01:06:15,767
That's what you don't
understand, Mother.

1399
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,433
It's about so much
more than that.

1400
01:06:18,567 --> 01:06:20,834
It's about the friendships,
the camaraderie,

1401
01:06:20,967 --> 01:06:23,867
the pride we have in what we do.

1402
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:26,700
We make each other better,

1403
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,266
not just as dancers

1404
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,800
but as strong,

1405
01:06:33,934 --> 01:06:37,433
confident women who can make
their own dreams come true.

1406
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:38,567
I've heard enough.

1407
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:42,333
If you're not at the hotel
in two hours, Margaret,

1408
01:06:42,467 --> 01:06:45,100
don't bother coming
back home at all.

1409
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:46,593
You would cut me
off from my family

1410
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:47,834
for following my dreams?

1411
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:48,967
I'm trying to save you

1412
01:06:49,066 --> 01:06:51,367
from making the biggest
mistake in your life.

1413
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:55,633
My only mistake was
hoping you'd understand.

1414
01:06:58,066 --> 01:06:59,166
Elisabeth, let's go.

1415
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:02,934
Elisabeth.

1416
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,233
(g-Hi.

1417
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:22,200
How did you-

1418
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:23,667
Ben gave me your address.

1419
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:25,867
Is that your application?

1420
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,767
It is.

1421
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,533
I was just going to drop it off.

1422
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:30,767
That's wonderful.

1423
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:31,700
When will you find
out if you got in?

1424
01:07:31,834 --> 01:07:33,266
While I'm at sea?

1425
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,100
So when I get back,

1426
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:39,767
I'll either be doing
Slater and Son or this.

1427
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,266
I suppose that means
you told your parents.

1428
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,400
I did, but they
don't understand.

1429
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,367
I'm not judging their choices,

1430
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,200
I just wanted to make my own.

1431
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,333
So did I?

1432
01:07:53,233 --> 01:07:54,233
And I have.

1433
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,100
I have a lot to tell you.

1434
01:07:57,233 --> 01:07:58,934
I, I, I need to drop this off.

1435
01:07:59,066 --> 01:08:00,834
Do you have time for a walk?

1436
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:02,367
As a matter of fact, I do.

1437
01:08:05,934 --> 01:08:07,776
Maybe I should have written
a letter to Santa too.

1438
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,000
You think he knows
anyone in admissions?

1439
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:11,800
Well, if he doesn't,

1440
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:13,094
I'm sure my grandfather does.

1441
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:14,633
He's on the Board of Trustees.

1442
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:18,100
You didn't think to
tell me that until now?

1443
01:08:18,233 --> 01:08:22,333
There's a few things about
my family I didn't mention.

1444
01:08:22,467 --> 01:08:23,700
I already know, Maggie.

1445
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,800
You do?

1446
01:08:27,633 --> 01:08:28,800
Your family is rich.

1447
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:31,467
Sofia let it slip to Ben.

1448
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,133
Yes, it's true.

1449
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,834
But I'm on my own
now, completely,

1450
01:08:37,967 --> 01:08:39,633
that's what I
wanted to tell you.

1451
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,767
I broke off my engagement, John,

1452
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,020
and I'm staying in New York.

1453
01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:45,934
So when you get back-

1454
01:08:46,066 --> 01:08:47,066
Stop, back up.

1455
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,233
You were engaged?

1456
01:08:50,033 --> 01:08:51,800
Ben didn't tell you that part.

1457
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:53,967
No.

1458
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,100
Oh.

1459
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:56,600
Okay.

1460
01:08:56,734 --> 01:08:59,500
Uh, I was engaged,

1461
01:08:59,633 --> 01:09:02,333
but we're both from
prominent families, you see?

1462
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:04,533
So it was more of a
marriage of convenience,

1463
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:06,200
it wasn't real love, not like,

1464
01:09:07,467 --> 01:09:09,633
not like what I
know is possible.

1465
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:12,867
I wish you would have
told me all this before.

1466
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,233
But we were just friends.

1467
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:16,900
Isn't that what we said?

1468
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:19,000
I wasn't ready to
tell you everything,

1469
01:09:19,133 --> 01:09:20,166
but now I am.

1470
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,433
I just needed time to figure
things out for myself.

1471
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,100
But I made my choice.

1472
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,767
I choose New York and
being a dancer, and,

1473
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:35,734
and you.

1474
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:40,033
I thought you'd be happy.

1475
01:09:41,467 --> 01:09:42,600
How can I be happy?

1476
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,033
I told you everything
about myself,

1477
01:09:45,166 --> 01:09:46,643
and it turns out I
didn't know you at all.

1478
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:47,734
You do know me.

1479
01:09:47,867 --> 01:09:49,033
You helped me see who I am.

1480
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,166
You told me over and over

1481
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:51,810
I owed it to my family
to tell them the truth,

1482
01:09:51,834 --> 01:09:53,734
and this entire time
you were lying to yours.

1483
01:09:53,867 --> 01:09:55,033
But I did tell them.

1484
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:57,333
Only when you had
no other choice.

1485
01:09:57,467 --> 01:09:58,900
You knew that if
it didn't work out,

1486
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:00,509
you would just go
back to Philadelphia

1487
01:10:00,533 --> 01:10:03,367
and pretend like none of
this ever happened; but me,

1488
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,834
I'm risking everything.

1489
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,476
Well, then let me at least
talk to my grandfather.

1490
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,867
Why?

1491
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,834
'Cause you don't think I
can make it in on my own.

1492
01:10:08,967 --> 01:10:10,333
I'm not saying that at all.

1493
01:10:10,467 --> 01:10:12,000
I care about you.

1494
01:10:12,133 --> 01:10:13,533
I just want to help you.

1495
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,033
Did your grandfather help
you get into the Rockettes?

1496
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,900
I did that on my own.

1497
01:10:21,033 --> 01:10:23,900
And that's how
I want to do this,

1498
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:25,400
on my own.

1499
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,333
The show wasn't
the same without you.

1500
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:48,900
Are you okay?

1501
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:50,400
Never better.

1502
01:10:50,533 --> 01:10:52,066
Rose said I could
stay at the apartment

1503
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,920
during the off-season
while I look for work.

1504
01:10:53,967 --> 01:10:56,233
And I have a lead on a
sales job at Gimble's.

1505
01:10:56,367 --> 01:10:57,867
Maggie, did you talk to John?

1506
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,700
I did.

1507
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,233
It didn't work out.

1508
01:11:04,367 --> 01:11:05,467
It's fine.

1509
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,900
I came to New York
to be a dancer,

1510
01:11:08,033 --> 01:11:10,500
not to fall in love.

1511
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:14,300
I should have just
focused on the job,

1512
01:11:14,433 --> 01:11:15,433
that's what matters.

1513
01:11:15,533 --> 01:11:19,133
Until you can't do the
job anymore, then what?

1514
01:11:19,266 --> 01:11:20,500
What's going on, Alice?

1515
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,467
I think it's time I
should listen to my body

1516
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,834
and hang up my tap shoes.

1517
01:11:27,934 --> 01:11:31,967
So in three days, when
this show is over, so am I.

1518
01:11:34,266 --> 01:11:36,133
And I do not know
what to do next.

1519
01:11:37,533 --> 01:11:40,767
This show is everything to me,

1520
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,166
it made me who I am.

1521
01:11:46,367 --> 01:11:47,687
And I, I just don't
want to leave.

1522
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,934
We don't want you
to leave either.

1523
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:53,300
But I know one thing for sure,

1524
01:11:53,433 --> 01:11:55,633
no matter where any of us are,

1525
01:11:55,767 --> 01:11:57,100
we'll always be sisters.

1526
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,133
I know mine would have
loved you girls so much.

1527
01:12:05,934 --> 01:12:06,934
Really, Janet.

1528
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Nothing?

1529
01:12:08,934 --> 01:12:12,066
You don't have to do
this alone anymore, Janet.

1530
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,367
We're your friends.

1531
01:12:15,667 --> 01:12:18,533
But that's just it.

1532
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,066
I never let myself have friends.

1533
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,734
Everyone I met was
just the competition.

1534
01:12:26,433 --> 01:12:27,633
And you girls have stood by me

1535
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:29,400
no matter how hard
I pushed you away.

1536
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:32,400
And I tried hard.

1537
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:34,667
We know.

1538
01:12:40,033 --> 01:12:42,400
You helped me
the most, you know?

1539
01:12:42,533 --> 01:12:44,242
Your friendship is the
best Christmas present

1540
01:12:44,266 --> 01:12:45,700
I ever could have been given.

1541
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:48,700
I just don't want this to end.

1542
01:12:48,834 --> 01:12:50,166
None of us do.

1543
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,533
Nothing like a piece of
pie after a good cry,

1544
01:12:56,667 --> 01:12:57,667
I always say.

1545
01:13:05,567 --> 01:13:08,533
I don't have anything to say.

1546
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:12,734
My father built this
business for him then for me,

1547
01:13:12,867 --> 01:13:15,133
and I thought someday for you.

1548
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,333
It's our legacy.

1549
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,400
But don't you see?

1550
01:13:20,834 --> 01:13:23,734
You made me into a man
who could see beauty

1551
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:25,133
in the simple things:

1552
01:13:26,066 --> 01:13:30,467
in family, in hard
work, in sacrifice.

1553
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:45,667
Don't you see, Pop?

1554
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:50,500
The store isn't your legacy,

1555
01:13:51,867 --> 01:13:52,867
I am.

1556
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:56,734
Oh, Robert.

1557
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:03,667
You can really make
a living doing this?

1558
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,300
I really can.

1559
01:14:07,367 --> 01:14:11,200
And the Slater name will be
under every single picture.

1560
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,667
It's good advertising.

1561
01:14:22,767 --> 01:14:24,533
Is something
still wrong, Johnny?

1562
01:14:40,066 --> 01:14:41,333
Uh, who are you here to see?

1563
01:14:41,467 --> 01:14:43,000
- Maggie Bennett.
- Margaret Bennett.

1564
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:44,600
I'm her mother.

1565
01:14:44,734 --> 01:14:46,100
Sorry, she already left.

1566
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:47,633
Next show starts in two hours.

1567
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,042
I guess we'll have to come back.

1568
01:14:50,066 --> 01:14:50,834
I'm sorry.

1569
01:14:50,967 --> 01:14:51,834
How do you know my daughter?

1570
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:52,633
Oh, I'm sorry.

1571
01:14:52,767 --> 01:14:53,467
How rude of me?

1572
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,934
I'm Harriet Slater.

1573
01:14:55,066 --> 01:14:56,500
John Slater's my son.

1574
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:58,767
It's sad what happened.

1575
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,934
It really seemed that John
had found his perfect match.

1576
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:04,843
I thought that if I
could come talk to Maggie

1577
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:07,066
I could maybe figure
out a way to help.

1578
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:11,700
I'm sorry, I, I, I
didn't know about your son.

1579
01:15:11,834 --> 01:15:12,834
You didn't?

1580
01:15:12,934 --> 01:15:15,066
No, I just came back
to convince my daughter

1581
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,734
to stop this nonsense
and come home.

1582
01:15:18,867 --> 01:15:21,200
Have you seen the
show, Mrs. Bennett?

1583
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:22,867
No, I haven't.

1584
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,767
If you had, you wouldn't
want to talk her out of that.

1585
01:15:27,767 --> 01:15:30,900
It's like when I saw my
son John's photographs,

1586
01:15:31,033 --> 01:15:34,367
I knew that that's what
he was meant to do too.

1587
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,767
But I think they were
meant to do it together.

1588
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:39,166
John loves her.

1589
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,967
Does Margaret love him?

1590
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,333
I need to make things right.

1591
01:15:58,467 --> 01:15:59,467
We both do.

1592
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,033
I can't believe this is it,

1593
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:10,800
our last show.

1594
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:11,967
Hmm.

1595
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,700
And my parents never saw it.

1596
01:16:13,834 --> 01:16:15,314
Maybe they'll come
around next season.

1597
01:16:15,433 --> 01:16:17,633
Speaking of next season.

1598
01:16:17,767 --> 01:16:19,567
Alice, can we talk?

1599
01:16:22,934 --> 01:16:25,200
I know what you're going
to say, Mr. Matthews.

1600
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:27,867
I know that this is
my last season and-

1601
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,867
On-stage, perhaps.

1602
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,467
But I've seen how much
you help everyone here,

1603
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,133
how selfless you are,

1604
01:16:37,266 --> 01:16:39,200
and how much these
girls look up to you.

1605
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,834
I think every one of these girls

1606
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:42,200
came into my office this week

1607
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:45,667
to tell me how much they
love you and need you,

1608
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,900
one in particular.

1609
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:52,834
The way you stood by Janet
and brought her along,

1610
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:56,266
that's the sort of leadership
we're looking for around here.

1611
01:16:57,967 --> 01:16:59,633
So, so what are you saying?

1612
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:02,734
We would like to offer you
the position of dance captain.

1613
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,266
You'd make sure the girls
know their choreography,

1614
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,200
run rehearsals and maybe
fill in now and then.

1615
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:14,567
Merry Christmas, Alice.

1616
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,100
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Matthews.

1617
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:19,400
Ladies, have a good show.

1618
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:21,100
Hmm?
Thank you.

1619
01:17:26,834 --> 01:17:28,367
Thank you, everyone,

1620
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,467
especially you.

1621
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:33,867
Anything for a friend.

1622
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:38,333
Five minutes, ladies.

1623
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:42,100
Oh.

1624
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:44,600
This just got delivered
for you, Maggie,

1625
01:17:44,734 --> 01:17:45,800
from Gimble's.

1626
01:17:46,433 --> 01:17:47,800
I didn't order anything.

1627
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,400
For Maggie,

1628
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:54,867
who will always be part
of Christmas in New York.

1629
01:17:55,767 --> 01:17:56,767
Love, John.

1630
01:18:02,533 --> 01:18:03,533
Hmm.

1631
01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:07,533
He must have paid for this
before everything happened.

1632
01:18:08,367 --> 01:18:09,500
He did love me,

1633
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:13,667
and I loved him.

1634
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,000
I'm so sorry, Maggie.

1635
01:18:17,533 --> 01:18:18,533
It's fine.

1636
01:18:19,367 --> 01:18:21,600
At least now I know for
sure how love feels.

1637
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:25,900
Are you sure you
want to keep it?

1638
01:18:26,033 --> 01:18:28,367
You don't think it'll
remind of you what you lost?

1639
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,200
No.

1640
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:33,100
It reminds me of
how far I've come.

1641
01:18:35,133 --> 01:18:37,100
Places, please, ladies.

1642
01:20:48,433 --> 01:20:49,843
And I didn't even know
if it was going to fit.

1643
01:20:49,867 --> 01:20:50,734
And then you helped
me zip it up.

1644
01:20:50,867 --> 01:20:54,734
You were absolutely wonderful.

1645
01:20:54,867 --> 01:20:56,734
I couldn't be more proud.

1646
01:20:56,867 --> 01:20:57,700
Look at you.

1647
01:20:57,834 --> 01:20:59,533
You're just glowing, Maggie.

1648
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:02,633
You look so happy.

1649
01:21:02,767 --> 01:21:05,633
You called me, Maggie.

1650
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:07,133
I know.

1651
01:21:07,266 --> 01:21:08,767
I rather like it.

1652
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:09,900
So do I.

1653
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,867
I can't believe you're here.

1654
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,433
I came back to get
you to change your mind.

1655
01:21:15,567 --> 01:21:16,867
Mother-

1656
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,200
But I made a new friend
and she changed mine.

1657
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:22,867
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

1658
01:21:23,767 --> 01:21:25,033
I was so busy worrying

1659
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,633
about how it looked
to everyone else

1660
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:29,300
that I didn't give you
a chance to be yourself.

1661
01:21:29,433 --> 01:21:32,734
And look at you.

1662
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,333
You followed your heart.

1663
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,600
And look what
you've accomplished.

1664
01:21:38,734 --> 01:21:40,333
I'm so proud of you.

1665
01:21:42,934 --> 01:21:43,967
Father isn't here, is he?

1666
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,767
Oh, he'll come around,

1667
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,600
don't worry,

1668
01:21:46,734 --> 01:21:48,133
I'll make sure of it.

1669
01:21:48,266 --> 01:21:50,834
I only let him think he's
in charge of this family.

1670
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,400
And I spoke to John
before the show.

1671
01:21:55,767 --> 01:21:57,000
He's wonderful, Maggie.

1672
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,100
Don't let him go.

1673
01:22:03,467 --> 01:22:04,600
You were wonderful.

1674
01:22:04,734 --> 01:22:06,300
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

1675
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,066
You got the pin?

1676
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,834
I can't believe you did this.

1677
01:22:15,967 --> 01:22:16,967
I love it.

1678
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:22,333
I'm so sorry about
what happened, John.

1679
01:22:22,467 --> 01:22:23,867
I pressured you
to risk everything

1680
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,867
without telling you
the truth about myself.

1681
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,033
And I need you to know,

1682
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:29,233
I never meant to imply

1683
01:22:29,367 --> 01:22:32,033
you couldn't make your
dreams come true on your own.

1684
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:34,533
You have nothing
to apologize for.

1685
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:36,033
No one should have understood

1686
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,309
the kind of pressure you
were under from your family

1687
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:38,333
more than me.

1688
01:22:40,066 --> 01:22:41,066
But

1689
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:46,000
it seems like you're
working things out.

1690
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:47,133
I think so.

1691
01:22:47,633 --> 01:22:49,767
How did our mothers even meet?

1692
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,533
Long story short,

1693
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:54,367
they both wanted to
make things right.

1694
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,500
And?

1695
01:22:56,333 --> 01:22:57,400
So far so good.

1696
01:22:59,066 --> 01:23:01,200
You want to see the
view I get every night?

1697
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,000
It's beautiful.

1698
01:23:12,133 --> 01:23:12,834
Isn't it?

1699
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:15,333
Like Christmas every single day.

1700
01:23:16,734 --> 01:23:18,367
Actually, I was
talking about you.

1701
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:23,100
You're not so bad yourself.

1702
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:27,333
I like to dress nice
for important occasions,

1703
01:23:28,433 --> 01:23:31,166
like the night a man tells
a woman he loves her.

1704
01:23:33,567 --> 01:23:34,876
There's no way I could
leave for six months

1705
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,133
without telling you that.

1706
01:23:37,133 --> 01:23:38,834
I love you, Maggie.

1707
01:23:42,633 --> 01:23:43,633
I love you too.

1708
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:46,567
And when you get back,

1709
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,100
I'll be right here waiting.

1710
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,567
Even if you don't know

1711
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:53,400
if you're going to end up with
a photographer or a grocer?

1712
01:23:53,533 --> 01:23:55,333
I just want to be with you.

1713
01:24:04,266 --> 01:24:08,066
This pin always reminds
me of that Christmas

1714
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:15,266
and how I became the
woman I was meant to be.

1715
01:24:17,934 --> 01:24:20,500
And I became a lot stronger too.

1716
01:24:20,633 --> 01:24:22,600
Lucy, just like you,
you can do this.

1717
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,066
Thank you, Grandma.

1718
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,233
I should have known this
is where you snuck off to.

1719
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,133
Look what Grandma gave me.

1720
01:24:34,266 --> 01:24:38,934
Oh, well, I can't think of
a better legacy.

1721
01:24:42,967 --> 01:24:46,066
And it all started right here.

1722
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:49,834
The happiest night
of my entire life.
