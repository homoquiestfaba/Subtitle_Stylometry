1
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,489
Attention, workers
are reminded that smoking is

2
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,890
only permitted in designated...

3
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,659
I can't even tell you what a
joy it's going to be

4
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,660
taking these down.

5
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,529
Long time coming too, that's all
I got to say.

6
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,997
It's nice to be working with
somebody who's got

7
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,967
the cojones to step
up here and clean the.

8
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,369
I'm going to like working with
you, I can already tell.

9
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,505
Garth Lampson, the guy before
you... that guy...

10
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,040
I tell you, the whole time he
was here,

11
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,509
I didn't see him go below level
4 one time.

12
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,577
Not one time.

13
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,012
That old fart was just, you
know, coasting out to retirement.

14
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,881
There's something to be said
for that.

15
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,015
Well, maybe.

16
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,984
I used to call him Gold Watch
Garth, that's what I...

17
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:38,885
Niles!

18
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:39,819
Yeah?

19
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:43,289
Watch their hands.

20
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,668
Go directly to the med center.

21
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,838
And to make sure that the doctor
on call takes photographs.

22
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,872
I'm pressing charges this time.

23
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,773
Go!

24
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:01,641
What took you?

25
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,377
Had a little brawl at the Brass
Monkey.

26
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,645
Kristof boys again?

27
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:06,512
Yes.

28
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,546
All right, we'll take it from
here.

29
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,526
Bianca!

30
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,999
Murdock?

31
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,334
We're down here to party.

32
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,336
You into water sports?

33
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,037
Yeah?

34
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,805
No.

35
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,040
Now let the girl go.

36
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,075
Marshal, you gonna shoot me?

37
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:43,049
I hadn't thought about it, but
that's a really good idea.

38
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,518
Hey, Vlad!

39
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,588
The big bad marshal says he's
going to shoot me.

40
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,621
Attention personnel...

41
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,360
for tomorrow no later...

42
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,561
See ya!

43
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,897
Than 3:00 PM today
for tomorrow's transport.

44
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,867
Murdock, you know better than
to come down here.

45
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,387
You're one stupid son of a
,, you know that?

46
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,622
Yeah, I know.

47
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,655
Now tell your brother to let go
of the girl.

48
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,999
Sam.

49
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,471
What's the deal?

50
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,783
OK, OK, OK.

51
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,670
Don't do it!

52
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,639
Don't do it.

53
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,015
Personnel are reminded

54
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,086
to limit their person-to-person
calls to one hour a week.

55
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,222
Overages will be garnished from
weekly wages

56
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,056
starting this week.

57
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,092
Thank you for choosing
Transglobal.

58
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,962
It's better you pull that
trigger, friend.

59
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,998
Cause no matter where they send
me, I will come back here

60
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,934
and I'll kill you.

61
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,979
Cuff.

62
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,970
Now I can't believe I got to beg

63
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,673
my own partner come have
one last cold beer with me.

64
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:21,808
Gotta pack.

65
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,110
All work and no play makes Will
a very, very dull boy.

66
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,552
Niles, what's up?

67
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,854
I forgot my e-card in my room.

68
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,155
You want to hold the car for me?

69
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,557
Let's catch the next one, Niles.

70
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,590
Relax, I'll be right back.

71
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,346
Come on, come on.

72
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,329
Surprise!

73
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,300
For he's a jolly good fellow.

74
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,904
For he's a jolly good fellow.

75
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:30,276
For he's a jolly good fellow,
which nobody can deny.

76
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,850
Quiet, quiet!

77
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,223
Quiet!

78
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,325
Quiet!

79
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,862
I think we all know why we're
here, which is to get

80
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,131
really drunk really fast.

81
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,200
But before we get to that, I
think

82
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,170
we have to listen to this turkey
for a little bit, so...

83
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,372
Thank you, Niles.

84
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,842
Now I think we all really know
why we're here today.

85
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,979
And that's to wish a fond
farewell to the best marshal

86
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,012
this plant's ever had.

87
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,160
Will, we've had our differences
in the past.

88
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,428
Like when you decided to
prohibit

89
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,898
hard alcohol on the blue level,
I thought we'd have a mutiny.

90
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,205
But here we are four years
later,

91
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,374
production's up over 17%.

92
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,276
Sick leave's down to nothing.

93
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,011
And serious substance abuse...

94
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,713
Doc, what'd you tell me about
that?

95
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,149
We haven't had a single
detoxing in seven months.

96
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,818
Look at that, Will.

97
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,851
You're putting the shrink out of
business.

98
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,926
But seriously, this was always a
good place to work,

99
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,929
but it wasn't necessarily a good
place to live.

100
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,963
But thanks to Will...

101
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,164
Who said that?

102
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,068
And Niles, there's not a
single sector in this plant

103
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,171
from stem to stern from top to
bottom where

104
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:44,176
a man or a woman can't walk free
from fear, free from violence.

105
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,179
Will, you made this a decent
place, where decent people

106
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,881
can live and thrive.

107
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,951
So on behalf of every person
trapped on this bucket,

108
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,152
Thank you, Will Murdock.

109
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,954
We're going to miss you.

110
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,889
Thank you, Will Murdock.

111
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,922
Bah.

112
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,401
I could not help him.

113
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,870
Well, even if you could, it
sounds like he

114
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,773
might have taken you with him.

115
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:17,910
I don't understand.

116
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:22,248
Artie is the most dependable man
on my crew.

117
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,281
Boring, even.

118
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,885
He had three children.

119
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,159
Did he have any marital
problems?

120
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,796
No, he loves his wife very much.

121
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,800
Well, maybe this one was
different.

122
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,468
Maybe it really was an accident.

123
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,501
It was not an accident.

124
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,810
I was less than 10 meters away.

125
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:57,149
He was staring at something,
hallucinating, maybe.

126
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,151
Artie?

127
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,055
Then he...

128
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,409
It was bad.

129
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,778
Emil, was Artie doing any drugs?

130
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,915
Only his Zyloban.

131
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,087
The same as everyone.

132
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,560
Attention personnel.

133
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:47,900
Smoking is only permitted in
designated.

134
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,001
Kopek's bunk?

135
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,403
Thank you for
choosing Transglobal.

136
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,544
This Kopek's bunk right here?

137
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,411
Will, I didn't hear you.

138
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,246
That's because I was silently
observing

139
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,617
you to see if you displayed any
abnormal behavior.

140
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,220
So what did you find?

141
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:22,252
Well, you're extremely neat,
bordering on anal-retentive.

142
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,328
I'd say you hate your mother.

143
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,469
I'd keep your day job.

144
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,707
I need your help, Doc.

145
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,575
Of course.

146
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:41,046
I found this inside Artie
Kopek's medicine cabinet.

147
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,553
Zyloban.

148
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,689
All the level 1 workers take it,
you know that.

149
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,058
Are there any side effects to
that stuff?

150
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,360
Of course.

151
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,197
Dry mouth, indigestion,
sometimes

152
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,399
mild sexual dysfunction.

153
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:04,737
I mean serious side effects.

154
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,606
Come now, you're grasping at
straws here.

155
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,677
No, no, no, Doc, just answer
the question, please.

156
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,710
Very well.

157
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:24,523
Zyloban, Zyloban, a synthetic
isotope blocker developed

158
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:28,060
for the United States Army
during the Pakistan War that

159
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,430
protects human zone,
radioactive materials...

160
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,566
The effectiveness declines
after...

161
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,003
Side effects include dry mouth,
indigestion...

162
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,240
Mild sexual dysfunction.

163
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,610
So the pills, they're harmless.

164
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:48,414
I have been monitoring maranium
diggers for over three years.

165
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,352
In that long time, I haven't
ever

166
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,522
logged a significant side
effect,

167
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:00,259
much less the type of profound
psychosis you suggest.

168
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,666
Well, what about this?

169
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,304
What about it?

170
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,773
That's one of Emil Angeloff's
pills.

171
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,376
It's not scored.

172
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,178
So?

173
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,614
So all the Zyloban taken by the
last three suicide victims

174
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,649
were scored.

175
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,050
Now I haven't checked the
others,

176
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,785
but I think I might find the
same thing.

177
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,321
So maybe this isn't Zyloban.

178
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,156
Maybe it's a bad batch.

179
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,592
It's very common.

180
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,262
One out of every four workers
experience

181
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,565
some mild stomach upset.

182
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,401
If they complain, I issue the
scored pills

183
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,603
so they can split them, take
half at breakfast,

184
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,105
half at dinner.

185
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,206
Maybe...

186
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,109
Maybe you have trouble dealing
with the possibility

187
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:55,481
that a perfectly sane rational
human being can suddenly

188
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,514
crack for no apparent reason.

189
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,289
Maybe this has more to do with
you than the victims.

190
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,824
That's a cheap shot, Doc.

191
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,494
Is it?

192
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,229
When's the last time you had an
episode?

193
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,797
Come on, Craig, this has nothing

194
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,865
to do with my claustrophobia.

195
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,434
Answer the question, Marshal.

196
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:19,638
I had a little problem in
one of the EM cars

197
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,507
just before the party.

198
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,409
It was bad?

199
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:27,479
No, I just took a few deep
breaths,

200
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,348
started chewing my gum.

201
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,884
And I finally just opened the
door.

202
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,087
And what if the door hadn't
opened?

203
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,131
Fear is a killer, Will.

204
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,668
I have seen it 1,000 times.

205
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:54,239
It's like falling through fog.

206
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,675
You don't know when you are
going to hit the ground.

207
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,145
But you know the longer you
fall, the worse it will be.

208
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,315
So you reach a point where you
just want it

209
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,752
to end by any means necessary.

210
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:11,290
We've had nine suicides in the
last month, Doc.

211
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,759
Yeah, these things happen in
clusters.

212
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,394
I have some articles you can
take and read

213
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,328
if you don't believe me.

214
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,697
I know.

215
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,701
So I want to get those pills
analyzed.

216
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:26,505
OK, if it makes you feel
better, fine.

217
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,539
I'll take it myself.

218
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,474
I can do it.

219
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,342
No, no, no, it's fine.

220
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,377
An old college buddy works for
the FDA.

221
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,556
I'll take a few samples with me
when I go on the transport

222
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,382
tomorrow, have him do it.

223
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,517
Are you sure?

224
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,218
It's no problem...

225
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:43,689
No, no, it's no problem at all.

226
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,892
There is one favor I'd like to
ask, though.

227
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,760
Yeah?

228
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:53,298
It's kind of silly, but in my
line of work,

229
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:57,402
stuff like claustrophobia can
really come back to bite

230
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,472
so it's not too much of
a problem,

231
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:05,744
I'd really appreciate it if you
could bury my file.

232
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,281
What file?

233
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,314
Thanks, Doc.

234
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,247
What?

235
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,649
Nothing.

236
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,817
I'm just not in the mood, that's
all.

237
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,492
You know, this is all about you
and me.

238
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,993
It's payback.

239
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,496
What are you talking about?

240
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,965
What am I talking about?

241
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,601
I'm talking about Will.

242
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,269
He's jealous about us, that's
why he didn't

243
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,338
recommend me for the promotion.

244
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,874
God, not this again.

245
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,778
I got a solid work record,
excellent job reviews.

246
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:13,612
I mean, what else could it be?

247
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,582
Maybe he thinks you are not
ready.

248
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,449
Not ready?

249
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,284
What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

250
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,619
Nothing.

251
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,890
Maybe... just he had other
reasons.

252
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,859
He had other reasons, all right.

253
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,930
Like the fact that he never got
over you after you dumped him.

254
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,964
That's the other reason.

255
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,004
You dumped him, right?

256
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,375
I think it's better you leave
now.

257
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,464
Look, why don't I come by
tonight

258
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,699
after the orientation session?

259
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,733
No, I don't think so.

260
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,474
That's the way it's going to be?

261
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,609
No, Niles, that's the way it is.

262
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,121
Are you all right?

263
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,456
Yes.

264
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,458
Call Owen Porter.

265
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,662
Tell him I need a change.

266
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,695
He'll understand.

267
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:51,810
Hey, Jess.

268
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,079
Look out.

269
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,112
No!

270
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,849
Attention, the chapel

271
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,517
will be closed today between 3
and 6

272
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,653
for pressure equalization.

273
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,686
Thank you for choosing
Transglobal.

274
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,992
What's up, Marty?

275
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,961
Jesus, Will, I paged you over
an hour ago.

276
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,696
What part of the word urgent
don't you understand?

277
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,865
It was half an hour ago, my
friend.

278
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,534
And every single time you page
me, you say it's urgent.

279
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,470
You remember Vladimir Kristof?

280
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:52,871
Vlad?

281
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,139
Yeah, I was just thinking about
him.

282
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,807
Well, he's headed your way.

283
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,675
He's on a new transport.

284
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,643
Yeah, that's funny, Marty, real
funny.

285
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,644
No, I'm serious.

286
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,780
He was released last night from
Terminal Island,

287
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,749
some kind of evidentiary thing.

288
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,719
We're still waiting for details
from the DOJ.

289
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,721
What makes you think he's
coming here?

290
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,556
One of our
boys uploaded this to me

291
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,624
this morning.

292
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,526
Picked it up off some
surveillance cameras down

293
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,559
at the dock yard.

294
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,198
Yeah, well that's Vlad all
right.

295
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,232
Yeah, it gets better.

296
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,173
They all shipped out on the new
transport.

297
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,574
How'd they clear security?

298
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,676
Beats the hell out of me.

299
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,945
We contacted Transglobal and
their home office

300
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:34,913
is investigating it.

301
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,481
All we can figure is they must
have shipped

302
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,983
out under assumed names.

303
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,584
Maybe you can pick them up on
your end.

304
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,986
For what?

305
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,022
As far as I know, there's no law
against an employment

306
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,057
application with an assumed
name.

307
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:50,162
And even if there was, it's not
my jurisdiction, my friend.

308
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,963
Sorry, Will.

309
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,698
Technically, though, you're not
on duty,

310
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,810
so maybe you can ship out on a
supply drone or something

311
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:56,701
before he gets there.

312
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,669
Take off?

313
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:58,370
Run?

314
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:01,206
Come on, Mary, I can't do that.

315
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,074
I had a feeling you'd say that.

316
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,810
All I can tell you is Chris
Struthers will be down

317
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:05,944
there Wednesday as scheduled.

318
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,145
He's a good man.

319
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,681
In the meantime, keep a low
profile and watch your back.

320
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,714
Out.

321
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,257
Hey, Mike!

322
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,064
All the good seats are vacant.

323
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,242
You hear the news?

324
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,243
What news?

325
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:42,547
Kristof is shipping in on the
noon transport.

326
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,617
Vlad Kristof?

327
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,019
Starkweather and Weed too.

328
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,622
They're all coming.

329
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,655
That should be amusing.

330
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,659
Very amusing.

331
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,898
Does Murdock know?

332
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,833
Of course.

333
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,703
Everybody knows.

334
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,037
You'd think with Kristof back,
maybe

335
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,071
we have some fun for a change.

336
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,757
To fun.

337
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,790
Here, here.

338
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,163
Beautiful!

339
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,373
Look, I want those crates
locked and ready

340
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:26,277
to load by 11:30 or I'll dock
his final paycheck.

341
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,112
Yeah.

342
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,813
Yeah, I can do that, and I will
too

343
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,216
if he doesn't get it together.

344
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,219
OK, you have a nice day too.

345
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,155
Every six months, it's the same
old people cycling out,

346
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,256
they figure they can coast...

347
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,224
Owen I need to talk to you.

348
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,959
Well, sure you do.

349
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,893
Everybody...

350
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,461
Vlad Kristof and his boys are
coming in

351
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,495
on the noon transport.

352
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,100
That's impossible.

353
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,134
They're coming in on that sub.

354
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,843
There's an ore barge out of
here in 10 minutes.

355
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,845
Now company policy prohibits
passengers.

356
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:01,780
But in this case...

357
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,014
Owen, Owen, this is my job.

358
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,783
Look, that's.

359
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,385
You've been reassigned pending
relievement.

360
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,753
Listen, if there's trouble,
you're

361
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,188
going to wish that I was here.

362
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,990
Look, Will, if you're not here,

363
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,159
there won't be any trouble.

364
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,960
So I take off, those guys come
down here,

365
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,495
I'm gone, and everything's going
to be hunky-dory?

366
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,930
Is that what you're saying?

367
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,299
What I'm saying is you're half
the problem.

368
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,268
The only reason Kristof would
come back down

369
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,769
here is for payback.

370
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:25,970
Now I like you, Will.

371
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,872
I'm not going to let you commit
suicide.

372
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,007
Suicide?

373
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,443
Owen, I took those guys down by
myself last time, OK?

374
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,377
I can do it again.

375
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,411
And this time I have help.

376
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,312
I'm pulling...

377
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,780
You don't get it.

378
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,816
It doesn't matter who kills who.

379
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,318
A lot of people are going to get
caught in the crossfire.

380
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,154
Now I'm not doing this just for
you, Will.

381
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,188
I'm doing it for the men too.

382
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,453
Check it out.

383
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,123
Hey, Lars, what's up with the
hardware?

384
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,525
I don't know.

385
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,061
Something.

386
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,264
Something wonderful!

387
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,267
The most beautiful thing.

388
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,300
Here, I'll show you.

389
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,141
No!

390
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,303
Hey, Skip, got you a co-pilot.

391
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,372
Hey, Marshal, welcome to the
Love Boat.

392
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,374
Owen I don't feel right about
this.

393
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,876
Listen, listen, if it felt
right, it wouldn't be you.

394
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,744
Now get in that chair.

395
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,777
But seriously, Owen, this is
stupid.

396
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:18,082
Happy trails, Marshal.

397
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,116
Don't forget to write.

398
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,623
Disengage.

399
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,644
Sure is nice to have some
company for a change,

400
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,679
even though it's a cop.

401
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:48,513
Yeah.

402
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,582
Some of the stevedores had a
pool

403
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:55,153
going, big bucks on you staying
put and mixing it up with Vlad.

404
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,590
You turning tail, you won me a
load of money, brother.

405
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,623
I'm real happy for you.

406
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,165
Holy!

407
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,243
Turn around.

408
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,113
Turn around, we're going back.

409
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,415
I can't just turn around.

410
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,151
Turn around and go back.

411
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,087
I'm a federal law enforcement
officer,

412
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,389
and this is not a request.

413
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,422
Yes sir.

414
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,204
God!

415
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,377
So how many guys went in there?

416
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,145
We don't know yet.

417
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,747
We're still trying to track
everybody down.

418
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,615
Yeah, process of elimination,

419
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,183
It's the only way.

420
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,519
There's nothing left to
identify.

421
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,322
What the hell
happened here, Owen?

422
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,690
What are you doing back here,
Will?

423
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:06,658
Owen said you...

424
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,292
What's the matter, you
afraid you going

425
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,593
to lose money in the pool?

426
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,694
What pool?

427
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:10,595
What is he talking about?

428
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,432
I got it.

429
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,234
What is this, another one?

430
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,235
It looks that way.

431
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,304
Yeah, one of the diggers.

432
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,772
What's his name?

433
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:21,906
Lars Nilsson.

434
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:25,343
He shoots in here with his drill
and didn't say a word,

435
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,376
just punched through the hull.

436
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,549
Boom!

437
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,052
Explosive decompression.

438
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,320
So what happened to him?

439
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,321
Water.

440
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,390
It came through the iris just
before it shut.

441
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,793
Six tons per square inch hit
him.

442
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,761
Sealed up tight, though.

443
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,797
Soon as the saline hit the
sensors...

444
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,066
Bang, tight as a nun.

445
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:52,804
Saved the whole sector, just
like she was designed to.

446
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,339
Yeah, well, something tells me
this guy

447
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,372
ain't so thrilled about it.

448
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,149
Hey, Will, what was that crack
back there about a pool?

449
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,517
A betting pool.

450
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,453
Will I stay, will I go, who's
going

451
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,254
to catch a bullet, how many?

452
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,689
I heard the action's pretty
good.

453
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,224
No, seriously, I was thinking
about putting

454
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,359
a big bet on myself.

455
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,661
That way if I die, no one can
collect jack..

456
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:17,762
Will, it's not funny.

457
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:18,730
No, it's not.

458
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,198
I've never been very good at
jokes, Niles.

459
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,165
What'd you call me?

460
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,233
The joke motel.

461
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,602
That's right, joke motel,
Sergeant Will Murdock.

462
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,105
The jokes... they check in, they
don't check out.

463
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,239
Will, it's not funny.

464
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,774
And I got to talk to you.

465
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,275
Fine, talk.

466
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,144
It's important.

467
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,145
Talk.

468
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,178
Come on.

469
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,718
All right.

470
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,854
About this whole Kristof deal.

471
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,655
What Kristof deal?

472
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,124
This is serious.

473
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,558
All right.

474
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,459
OK.

475
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,128
All right.

476
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,363
The way I see it, we've got a
pretty good

477
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,332
chance of taking these guys.

478
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,134
Now there's two of us and three
of them,

479
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,436
but you and me, we're trained
marshals.

480
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:02,440
These guys are just, you know,
scumbags.

481
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,409
As far as I know, Weed and
Starkweather have never dropped

482
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,643
the hammer on anyone before.

483
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:06,711
As far as you know.

484
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,146
Right.

485
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,314
Right, as far as I know.

486
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,750
The problem is Vlad.

487
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,553
He's fast.

488
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,255
And I know you don't want to
hear this,

489
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,258
but by yourself, he's got a
pretty

490
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,225
good chance of taking you.

491
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,261
I don't know, I'd give him even
odds, maybe.

492
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,898
Please, better than even, trust
me.

493
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:31,569
But with me on your side, with
the two of us together,

494
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,837
he can't take us.

495
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,606
I don't know, Niles, he made a
pretty good go of it last time.

496
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,576
I know that, Will.

497
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:43,448
All right, believe me, I know it
much too well.

498
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,183
But ever since then... ever since
then, I've

499
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,617
been working every day on the
sim program

500
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,752
we got from the Justice
Department.

501
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,253
Niles, it's a sim program.

502
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,254
Just hear me out, would you?

503
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,656
Would you just hear me out?

504
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:52,890
All right?

505
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,159
I've worked my way up to level
5, all right?

506
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,162
That's... that's top level, OK,
master marksman.

507
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,731
I got... I got a 92% accuracy
rate,

508
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,367
and my speed's in the top sixth
percentile.

509
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,571
The FBI has been qualifying
their agents

510
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,207
on this thing at Quantico for
the past two years OK?

511
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,709
So between that and the hours
I've logged on the job...

512
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,244
Rousting drunks and drinking
coffee?

513
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,679
You're not listening to what
I'm saying.

514
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,881
All right, Niles, OK.

515
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,951
The last go round, I blew it.

516
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,787
I choked.

517
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,955
Hell is going to freeze over
before I

518
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,690
let it happen again, OK?

519
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:29,627
It's been eating at me ever
since that day.

520
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,630
I'm not going to let you down,
partner, not again.

521
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,870
OK.

522
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,506
I believe you.

523
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,941
I do, thank you.

524
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,677
It's settled, then.

525
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,711
I'm going to back you up.

526
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,750
You just gotta remember to back
me up.

527
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,353
What do you mean?

528
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,322
What do you mean what do I mean?

529
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,590
You know, when this whole
thing's done,

530
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,758
I will have paid my dues, right?

531
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,794
You know, you can throw in a
good word for me upstairs.

532
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,795
With who?

533
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:09,567
The guys upstairs, you know,
Chief Watson?

534
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,669
All right, I get it.

535
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,804
So you scratch my back, I
scratch yours, right?

536
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,839
Exactly.

537
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,374
OK.

538
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,742
OK, let's just get a couple of
things

539
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,511
straight then real quick.

540
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:23,481
Number one, I didn't have
anything to do with you

541
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,749
not getting that promotion.

542
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,485
Word is Struthers is a good man.

543
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,820
He's got three years seniority
on you, and...

544
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,024
And he was in line for the job.

545
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:38,529
Number two, I... I hate
underhanded bull...

546
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,430
Hey...

547
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,463
My turn, OK?

548
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:47,305
I hate underhanded bull
little maneuvers by people

549
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,374
who think that they can gold
brick their way into a job

550
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,810
that they don't deserve in
exchange

551
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:56,347
for some half backup.

552
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,352
And number three, pixels are not
flesh, and sims are not bone.

553
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,888
And a computer does not scream
for a priest as its choking

554
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,022
on its own blood.

555
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,659
So you can take your offer and
you can shove it right

556
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,362
up your top sixth percentile.

557
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,064
Am I clear?

558
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:13,998
You're an idiot.

559
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,031
You think so?

560
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,927
The whole thing stinks.

561
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,963
Get this, somebody posted
$400,000 to bail out Vlad.

562
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,064
Who?

563
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,066
That's the thing, we don't know.

564
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,134
It's written on a cashier's
check

565
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,971
from some bank in Barbados, some
dummy corporation.

566
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,074
What did Transglobal have to
say about him jumping security?

567
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,043
Nothing, nada.

568
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:02,446
We keep asking, and they're not
giving any information.

569
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,048
Cover you all the way up
the line.

570
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,583
My guess is they're sweating
litigation.

571
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,717
What do you mean?

572
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,586
Technically, you're not on duty
anymore,

573
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,887
which makes you a civilian.

574
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,656
Anything happens to you, they're
liable

575
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,357
and they've got deep pockets.

576
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,959
Hey, this could be your lucky
day.

577
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,494
Catch a stray and get to be a
millionaire.

578
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,563
Why doesn't that make me feel
better, Marty?

579
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,532
In any case, I
pulled four of my best guys

580
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,500
off tactical.

581
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,001
They'll be there to back you up
at 3:30 PM.

582
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,403
Can you hold the fort till then?

583
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,538
I guess I'm going to have to.

584
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,507
Don't do anything stupid.

585
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,108
Watch your back.

586
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,411
Things will work themselves out,
you'll be OK, Will.

587
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,444
Thanks, Mom.

588
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:51,929
Hey, Evan, what's going on?

589
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,598
I hear you're looking for
volunteers.

590
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,033
I can use all the help I can
get.

591
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,835
That will be no problem.

592
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,171
You have many friends here.

593
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,204
Well, all right.

594
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:09,013
Badge, access card.

595
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,719
Is that all?

596
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,021
That's it.

597
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,991
I was hoping you would swear me
in.

598
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,094
OK.

599
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,896
OK, raise your right hand.

600
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,531
Say I swear.

601
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,432
I swear.

602
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,000
Dominus ominus, OK?

603
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,702
Now you're sworn in.

604
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,104
OK.

605
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,106
I got a job for you right now
if you're ready for it.

606
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,006
You ready?

607
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,941
Yeah.

608
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,075
Excellent.

609
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,778
OK, this is a list of all the
recent suicides we've

610
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,446
had in the last few months.

611
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,915
Go to their quarters and see if
you can find their Zyloban.

612
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,485
And don't bother with the ones
I've already checked off.

613
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,787
You think the pills made them
crazy?

614
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,820
I got a hunch.

615
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,961
So now I am a detective?

616
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,994
That's right, you're a
detective.

617
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,166
Hey, Evan?

618
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,100
Yeah?

619
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,035
How's Bin?

620
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,138
Not so good.

621
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,472
You know she's leaving?

622
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,506
No, I didn't know that.

623
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,283
You shouldn't have come back.

624
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,186
It's not like I wanted to.

625
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,221
Yeah.

626
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:00,624
Everybody does what they want in
the end,

627
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:04,061
even if they don't know it.

628
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,964
Didn't come down here for a
session, Doc.

629
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,200
Of course not.

630
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,570
You just told me yesterday that
you don't want

631
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,739
me to analyze this mess, and now
suddenly, for

632
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,274
no particular reason, you do.

633
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,111
It makes sense to me.

634
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:25,282
Come now, Will, talk to me.

635
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,316
It's nothing.

636
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:33,257
Just been having those
nightmares again.

637
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,193
Jessica and the kids?

638
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,227
Yeah.

639
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,800
I'm in... in the car.

640
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,002
In the car?

641
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,704
That's new.

642
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,072
Can she see you?

643
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,841
No, no, and neither can the
kids.

644
00:41:54,211 --> 00:42:02,210
And we're driving along, and I
see the other car, the drunk.

645
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:08,726
And Jess turned back to check
the baby,

646
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:15,866
and the car swerves, and I see
the headlights,

647
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,335
and I reach for the...

648
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,104
For the wheel.

649
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:24,842
And my hand just passes right
through it, like I'm a...

650
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,744
A ghost?

651
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:27,678
Yeah.

652
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,711
What do you think it means?

653
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,116
I don't know.

654
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,017
Bzzt!

655
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,953
Wrong answer, try again.

656
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,221
I wasn't there.

657
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,189
If I was there, maybe I could
have done something about it.

658
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,691
Bzzt, bzzt, bzzt, bzzt, bzzt.

659
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,659
Too easy, too pat.

660
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,393
Try again.

661
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,761
Give me a break, I don't know.

662
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,794
We've no time for games, my
friend.

663
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,370
Well, I was...

664
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,807
You were what?

665
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,208
Nothing.

666
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,242
You were what?

667
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:07,051
When I got the call, I was with
Bin.

668
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,255
With Bin?

669
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,157
What does this mean?

670
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,194
I mean I was with Bin.

671
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,964
I see.

672
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:25,169
Obviously, there is some type of
sexual component to your guilt.

673
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:29,873
It could very well be the root
of your problem.

674
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,443
The claustrophobia?

675
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,312
It's unfortunate we don't have
more time.

676
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,982
Doc, in light of my current
circumstances,

677
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,216
I don't even like the way that
sounds.

678
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,752
No, no no, it wasn't what I
meant.

679
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,785
I know.

680
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,060
Take a look.

681
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,263
This graph here represents the
elemental components

682
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,365
of Zyloban.

683
00:43:54,398 --> 00:44:00,337
And this one represents the
sample you just gave me.

684
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,239
They're the same.

685
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:07,745
Yeah, identical, no variation
whatsoever.

686
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,778
I'm sorry about that.

687
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,819
Well, don't worry about it, Doc.

688
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,455
It's not the first time I've had
a lead go belly-up.

689
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,091
I'm terribly sorry about this
situation.

690
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,092
It's not your fault.

691
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,060
No, no.

692
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,796
No, of course, but I just wanted
to help you.

693
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,131
I got plenty of help on the way.

694
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,066
Don't worry about it.

695
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,099
Thanks, Doc.

696
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,052
Attention.

697
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,354
Workers are reminded that
smoking is only permitted

698
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,523
in designated structures.

699
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,559
Your help in keeping the air
free and clear

700
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,094
is really appreciated.

701
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,463
Thank you for choosing
Transglobal.

702
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,443
So how's the action on Murdock?

703
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,780
22 to 1 on.

704
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,922
Put me down for 10 when it gets
dirty.

705
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,024
You're putting good
money on Murdock?

706
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:04,094
Are you crazy?

707
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,128
You're right.

708
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:37,060
Gee, sorry about that.

709
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:40,364
You're sorry?

710
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,299
Just because you have a badge
does

711
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:45,335
not mean you can come into my
place and attack my customers.

712
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,303
Really?

713
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,336
Yeah.

714
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,877
Well, I guess you all know who's
coming

715
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,413
in on the noon transport.

716
00:46:56,446 --> 00:47:01,351
And you all know what kind of a
man Vlad Kristof is.

717
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:05,122
There will be trouble I've got a
few marshals

718
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,223
coming in this afternoon.

719
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,959
But in the meantime, I'm looking
for some volunteers

720
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,992
to help me out.

721
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,364
Does anybody want to give me a
hand?

722
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,201
What are you doing asking for
help in here?

723
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,234
Are you an idiot?

724
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,607
Everybody here... they are
friends of Vlad Kristof.

725
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,347
You think they'll help kill him?

726
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,417
That's not what I'm trying to
do.

727
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:41,225
The way I see it, the way we
see it, it's you or Kristof.

728
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,258
The smart money's on Kristof.

729
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,964
All right.

730
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,507
Emil?

731
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,408
Marshal.

732
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,943
How you doing?

733
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:01,977
Leave that man alone.

734
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,214
There is no one here to help
you.

735
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:13,490
If anybody changes their mind,
you know where to find me.

736
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,274
That went well.

737
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,324
Son of a.

738
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,365
Hey, Will, how you holding up?

739
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,368
I think I figured out who
posted Kristof's bail.

740
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,401
Check this out.

741
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,243
He's looking straight at it.

742
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,445
It's not payback, Marty.

743
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,245
It's a setup.

744
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,513
I don't follow.

745
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:44,748
Think about it.

746
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:48,485
The appeal, the bail money,
Kristof making that transport.

747
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,620
Where... where did he get his
clearance?

748
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,389
Where did he get an access card?

749
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,158
Hell, how did he get to Guam in
the first place?

750
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,394
This whole thing was engineered.

751
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:58,228
By who?

752
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,530
Everything points to
Transglobal,

753
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,631
which explains why you're
getting

754
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,200
the run-around from security.

755
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,068
Will, you're going from A to K
to Z here.

756
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,470
No, no, no, no, think about it.

757
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,672
It's the only way this whole
thing makes sense, OK?

758
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,540
They know about me and Kristof.

759
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,376
That's why they picked him for
the hit.

760
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:14,678
They want this to look personal.

761
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,780
OK, let's say you're right.

762
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:18,148
Why does Transglobal want you
dead?

763
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,082
I don't know.

764
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:19,783
I don't know.

765
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:20,784
I don't know.

766
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,086
Will, you got to cool down.

767
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,821
The transport's set to dock in
less than a half an hour.

768
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,256
When it does, you've got to be
focused.

769
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,091
Yeah, you're right.

770
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,359
Under no circumstances

771
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,427
are you to engage.

772
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,597
They got you out-manned and
seriously outgunned.

773
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,365
It's going to kind of tough,
Marty, you know?

774
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,500
They're going to be looking for
me,

775
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,201
and it's kind of a small place.

776
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:39,803
I know that.

777
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,738
But the only way we're going to
be able to sort this out

778
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,140
is if you're alive.

779
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,775
Otherwise, we got nothing.

780
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:45,642
Yeah, you're right.

781
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,145
I'm going to say this one more
time.

782
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:51,882
Your job at this point is to
stay alive.

783
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,818
Well, I'll do my best, buddy.

784
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,753
You do that.

785
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,822
Out.

786
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,855
Yeah.

787
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,867
Murdock.

788
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,901
It's me.

789
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:14,371
Hey, Bin, how you doing?

790
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,406
Don't sound so pissed.

791
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,408
I'm sorry, I'm just I'm dealing
with a lot of stuff

792
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:19,342
right now.

793
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,410
What's up?

794
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,679
I need you down here now.

795
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,712
What's wrong?

796
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,283
Bin?

797
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,768
Come in.

798
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,203
Speak with your section

799
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,804
supervisor for more details.

800
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,607
Thank you for choosing
Transglobal.

801
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,640
Sit down.

802
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,814
Drink?

803
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:58,882
No.

804
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,915
Well, I'm going to have one.

805
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,922
I heard about Kristof.

806
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,457
Who hasn't?

807
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,726
You must leave.

808
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,661
Bin, I can't do that.

809
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,663
No, you can and you will.

810
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,465
No, I won't.

811
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,900
Why?

812
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,803
You need to prove you're a big
man?

813
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:20,871
There's three of them, Will.

814
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:21,771
Yeah, I know.

815
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,973
I'm putting together some
volunteers.

816
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,174
Evan told me.

817
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:27,777
A few frightened diggers with
some badges and big talk.

818
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,646
And I've got four federal
marshals on their way

819
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:30,714
in this afternoon, Bin.

820
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,482
I'm going to be fine.

821
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:35,318
This isn't working out as I
planned.

822
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,352
Things rarely do.

823
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:45,462
I've never told you how sorry I
was about Jess and the kids.

824
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,798
Bin, you... you don't have to.

825
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,501
I know.

826
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,904
Even if I could, I would have
never tried

827
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,937
to take you away from them.

828
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,744
No?

829
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,777
Maybe.

830
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:12,923
What do you mean, you

831
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:15,525
couldn't find a single pill?

832
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,894
I checked medicine cabinets,
closets,

833
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,729
lockers, even their pockets.

834
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:20,964
Nothing.

835
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:23,300
All their personal effects are
supposed to still be there.

836
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,536
Yes, everything except the
pills.

837
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,504
Except the Zyloban?

838
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,738
Yeah.

839
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:29,839
Attention, the
chapel will be closed today...

840
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:33,743
All right, Evan, now this is
extremely important.

841
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,946
When you were down there, did
you see anyone, anyone

842
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:39,749
at all who didn't belong there?

843
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:40,650
No.

844
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,652
You're positive?

845
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,955
Absolutely.

846
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,923
All right, thanks.

847
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,359
Marshal?

848
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,394
Dr. Petrov says good luck.

849
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,896
Petrov?

850
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,532
I saw him on my way to the
dorms.

851
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,700
In red sector?

852
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,733
Yes.

853
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,706
Thanks, Evan.

854
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,739
You're welcome.

855
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:18,388
Is he in?

856
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,089
Yes.

857
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,523
He's with a patient right now.

858
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:21,224
Hey!

859
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,492
Hey, you cant just walk in here!

860
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:23,727
You out!

861
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,728
Will?

862
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,630
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I
couldn't stop him.

863
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:27,897
Quite all right, Vanessa.

864
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,668
See you what you can do about
rescheduling Mr. Dunlop, yeah.

865
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,670
OK.

866
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,705
Will, I know you're under
tremendous stress, but...

867
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:36,640
Where are the pills?

868
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:37,841
What pills?

869
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,477
The Zyloban that you lifted
from red sector.

870
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,479
You never go down to red sector,
Doc.

871
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,715
I'm afraid I don't know what
you're talking about.

872
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,652
OK.

873
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,554
Good god, no!

874
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:55,492
No time for kid gloves, right,
Doc?

875
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,427
Last night, I checked the uplink
logs

876
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,796
after we had our little
conversation about the Zyloban.

877
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,531
You sent a message to corporate.

878
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:02,499
What did it say?

879
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:05,135
I send a lot of messages to the
home office.

880
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:08,538
This one was encrypted, just
like every other one

881
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:11,641
you sent every single time a
digger blew a fuse.

882
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,910
I always encrypt my messages to
protect

883
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:14,844
patient's confidentiality.

884
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:15,812
Bzzt.

885
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:18,715
Too easy, too pat, try again.

886
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,748
Stop it!

887
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:27,390
OK, the truth.

888
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,426
I was conducting some research.

889
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,860
What kind of research?

890
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,797
Maranium resistance.

891
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,867
As you know, it concentrates in
the tissues.

892
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,969
So the diggers can only take six
months.

893
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,605
Bzzt. You're telling
me stuff I already know, Doc.

894
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:43,973
I know that you know.

895
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,208
But the thing that you don't
know

896
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:50,080
is the single most expensive
overhead item in this operation

897
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,915
is the mass personal transport.

898
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:55,185
So if we can increase the
diggers'

899
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:58,722
resistance up to 18, 12, or even
9 months,

900
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:00,156
this would increase the...

901
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,759
The company's profits by... by...
By billions.

902
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,495
So what is in the pills?

903
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,429
I've told you.

904
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,163
You know.

905
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,732
Zyloban.

906
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,433
I'm not lying to you, Will.

907
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,736
Believe me, but it was just...

908
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,438
A larger dose.

909
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,607
A mega dose.

910
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,845
Four times the clinical
prescription.

911
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,681
Craig?

912
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:29,152
We were expecting some
incidents of psychosis.

913
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:34,758
Lee documented this in their FDA
report.

914
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:37,494
But what we didn't know was the
rate of incidents,

915
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:43,666
and the weight will result
undesirable outcomes.

916
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,503
Doc.

917
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:48,772
You and all your friends in
corporate

918
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:51,941
are gonna fry when I get out of
here.

919
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:54,744
And I will get out of here.

920
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,647
If it makes you feel better, I
sincerely hope so.

921
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:26,042
Attention, all personnel

922
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,044
report to transit bay 6.

923
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:30,079
The afternoon transport is here.

924
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,113
Thank you for choosing
Transglobal.

925
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,784
Hey, Evan.

926
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:42,919
What took you?

927
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,754
Had to go see my shrink.

928
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:47,090
So where are the others?

929
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:48,691
There are no others.

930
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:49,626
We're it.

931
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:50,994
I couldn't get anybody else to
volunteer.

932
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,729
What?

933
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,163
There are no others.

934
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,298
You're kidding, right?

935
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,866
Nope.

936
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,968
You're it, Cisco, you and me.

937
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:00,637
What about Niles?

938
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:04,807
Niles quit this morning.

939
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,609
You ready?

940
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:09,245
But I... I thought there would
be many others.

941
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,250
Now give me the gun.

942
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:15,985
I'm sorry, Evan.

943
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:16,986
I'd be better off without you.

944
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,855
I couldn't live with myself if I
got you killed.

945
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,888
Thanks, though.

946
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,361
Don't worry about it.

947
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,395
I'm sorry.

948
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,869
All right.

949
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,672
Good luck, Marshal.

950
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,705
Thanks.

951
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,248
Attention, personnel wishing

952
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:49,652
to no later than...

953
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,221
Game time.

954
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,857
Thank you for
choosing Transglobal.

955
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,088
Hello, Doctor.

956
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:02,458
What do you want?

957
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:08,131
The Zyloban report, supporting
documents, research, crap,

958
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,332
whatever.

959
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,365
Corporate wants it all.

960
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:19,876
This is everything.

961
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,512
Good.

962
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:23,479
Thanks.

963
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,416
Murdock's expecting you.

964
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,885
He's not going to make it easy.

965
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:34,357
No, that's real depressing.

966
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:42,389
But when life gives you lemons,
you must make lemonade.

967
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:53,009
I feel much better now.

968
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,243
You?

969
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,277
Very therapeutic.

970
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,087
I got him.

971
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:51,594
Hey, Boyd.

972
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,429
Hey, Marshal.

973
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:56,365
What are you doing down here?

974
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:58,367
You are are not expecting any
trouble?

975
01:03:58,401 --> 01:03:59,669
I mean down here.

976
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:00,636
What is that?

977
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,537
Water?

978
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:04,607
Yeah, heavy water.

979
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,542
It stabilizes the maranium.

980
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,211
What if it wasn't there?

981
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,378
The water?

982
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:10,246
No.

983
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:14,016
Believe me, you do not want to
know.

984
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,219
Yeah, I do.

985
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:20,923
It... I mean, the maranium...
It's an extremely

986
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:25,061
stable element as far as a
radioactive material goes.

987
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:28,030
It will remain in there for an
hour so without water.

988
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:28,965
And then what happens?

989
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,933
Some sort of a meltdown?

990
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,401
No, nothing like that.

991
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,170
This stuff chain reacts.

992
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,538
Like a nuke?

993
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:38,975
No, nothing as big as a modern
technical weapon.

994
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:44,480
No, much smaller, more along the
lines of say, Hiroshima.

995
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:45,948
Hiroshima?

996
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:49,418
OK.

997
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,386
Can it be stopped?

998
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,054
Yes, of course.

999
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:55,391
Simply flush the unit and refill
it, life goes on.

1000
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,260
OK.

1001
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:58,194
Flush the unit.

1002
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,629
What?

1003
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:00,529
Pardon me?

1004
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,298
Flush the unit.

1005
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:03,232
Now.

1006
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:05,266
Come on.

1007
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,549
Attention, all personnel.

1008
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,185
Please proceed to your
designated evacuation pods.

1009
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:28,557
Attention, all personnel.

1010
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:32,528
Please proceed to your
designated evacuation pods.

1011
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,531
Thank you for choosing
Transglobal.

1012
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,443
Warning, critical temperature
overload in.

1013
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:49,545
What's going on down there?

1014
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:50,680
Hey, Owen!

1015
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,148
Will?

1016
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:53,082
Is that you?

1017
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,250
What are you doing?

1018
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,352
Buying myself a little
insurance policy.

1019
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,788
Temperature overload.

1020
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,489
What are you talking about?

1021
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:03,426
I'm purging the ore containment
unit.

1022
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,061
The whole place could blow!

1023
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:07,396
If I die, they die.

1024
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,132
You were right, Owen, there's
going to be trouble.

1025
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,468
And the best way to avoid
anybody getting hurt

1026
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,104
is to make sure everybody gets
out of here.

1027
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:18,107
Will, this may be a bit of a
surprise.

1028
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,576
When I told you that, I wasn't
talking about blowing

1029
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:23,579
up a $375 billion facility!

1030
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,281
Manual override...

1031
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,716
Hopefully, it won't come to
that.

1032
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,417
But Owen?

1033
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:30,052
What?

1034
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:32,788
If you own any
Transglobal stock,

1035
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,291
now might be a really good time
to sell.

1036
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,097
So which one of these buttons do
I push

1037
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,631
to fill these things back up?

1038
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:43,599
Just turn the key.

1039
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:46,268
The rest... it's automatic.

1040
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,371
Warning, critical
temperature overload...

1041
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:49,772
Those contacts in your eyes?

1042
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:50,706
What?

1043
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,575
Contact lenses, you wear
contact lenses?

1044
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,110
Yes, contacts.

1045
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,678
Do you have any saline solution?

1046
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,711
Yes, I have.

1047
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,817
Thanks.

1048
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,851
Hey?

1049
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,655
What are you waiting for?

1050
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,325
Get out of here.

1051
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,627
Warning, critical
temperature overload in

1052
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,662

1055
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:05,481

evacuation pods.

1058
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:17,793
I thought you were staying to
help.

1059
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:20,296
I was going to stay, but...

1060
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,331
You were the only one.

1061
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,604
Attention all personnel

1062
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:31,640

Estimated time to detonation, 22
minutes.

1067
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,326
He really did it.

1068
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,728
OK, we split up.

1069
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:56,232
You stay here.

1070
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,466
Cover the exit.

1071
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,767
I will go down to the refinery.

1072
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,202
We'll meet there.

1073
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,338

1097
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:04,386
Owen, I'm a little busy right

1098
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,522
Listen up, I got room in the
ore barge.

1099
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,490
Now get your ass up to transit
bay 4.

1100
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:10,125
You just go.

1101
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,126

01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,840
won't come to that.

1109
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,877
Owen, I gotta go, man.

1110
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,786
Attention all personnel...

1111
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,655
He's in the mag tube.

1112
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,557
Keep him pinned down.

1113
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,458
Wait!

1114
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,491
He run?

1115
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:12,855
He's in the mag tube.

1116
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,888

1117
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:18,894

1120
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:25,000
He's in the mag tube.

1121
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:33,032

I'm going in.

1128
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:48,657

1136
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,349
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1137
01:16:57,813 --> 01:16:59,813
Will!

1138
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:02,084
You're hit!

1139
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,318
What's so funny?

1140
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:05,187
Nothing.

1141
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,923
You just... you have no idea how
happy I am you

1142
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:08,857
decided to stop by.

1143
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,691
Here.

1144
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:10,625

Yeah?

1149
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:26,975
Hey, Owen.

1150
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:30,278
Yeah, what's the score?

1151
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,981
1-zip good guys.

1152
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:34,483
Starkweather's dead.

1153
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:36,284
Hey, listen, you got room for
one more on the barge?

1154
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,488
Yeah, it'll be a little right,
but who you got?

1155
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:40,789
Bin.

1156
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,057
Bin?

1157
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,792
What the hell is she doing down
there?

1158
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,994
I'll let her tell you herself.

1159
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,830
We're going to cut through the
ore extraction unit.

1160
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,165
We'll be right there.

1161
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,300
Come on.

1162
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,403
Come on.

1163
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,436
Let's go.

1164
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:35,544
What?

1165
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:36,978
Where are you?

1166
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,480
We're in the ore extraction
unit.

1167
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:39,414
We're pinned down.

1168
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:41,383
Skip's getting kind of jumpy.

1169
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:42,584
We gotta leave now.

1170
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:45,454
If we don't, we're not going to
clear the blast perimeter.

1171
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:46,388
All right.

1172
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:47,389
Owen, we're on our way.

1173
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:48,323
Don't go anywhere.

1174
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,959
Hang on, hang on, one second.

1175
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:53,061
Here.

1176
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:54,162
What are you doing? - Put this
on.

1177
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:55,097
But I...

1178
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,031
Take it now.

1179
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:59,267
OK.

1180
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,236
OK, listen, Bin.

1181
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,505
I'm going to lay down some cover
fire, OK?

1182
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:05,907
When I say go, you run from that
staircase

1183
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:07,576
and you keep running until you
get on the ore barge.

1184
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:09,578
No, I'm not going anywhere, not
without you.

1185
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:10,912
I'm going to be right behind
you.

1186
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:11,813
No, not without you...

1187
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:13,847
Look, why do you...

1188
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,026
OK.

1189
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,395
On the count of 3.

1190
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:32,868
1, 2, 3, go.

1191
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:39,334
Where?

1192
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:41,603
I'll be right up.

1193
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:44,139
He's still back there, but he
told me...

1194
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:45,040
What are you doing?

1195
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:45,974
No.

1196
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,042
No! No!

1197
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:48,944
No!

1198
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:50,278
No, no!

1199
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,180
No!

1200
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:54,214
No, please, no!

1201
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:57,986
But Will!

1202
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:00,019
Will!

1203
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:09,931
Please.

1204
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:23,111

You dead yet?

1209
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:49,037
Hey, Vlad!

1210
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:52,007
No, not dead yet, my friend.

1211
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,075
What's the matter, friend?

1212
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,977
No more bullets?

1213
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,746
Why don't you come out here
find out?

1214
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:59,648
Sounds like fun.

1215
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:02,317
But I have a better idea.

1216
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,619
Yeah, does this...

1217
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:08,490
This key have anything to do
with it?

1218
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,325
It might.

1219
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,358
Well, come and get it.

1220
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,597
You heard the man.

1221
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:22,470
Why don't you go?

1222
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:24,372
OK.

1223
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:25,473
You cover me?

1224
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:28,710
Naturally.

1225
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,111
