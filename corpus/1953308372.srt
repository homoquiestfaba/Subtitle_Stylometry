LIFE OF PI
Transcript and sync: jcdr

2
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,709
– So, you were raised in a zoo?
– Born and raised...

3
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,242
.. In Pondicherry, in what was
the French part of India.

4
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:01,312
My father owned the zoo.

5
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:04,815
And I was delivered on short notice
by a herpetologist,

6
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,874
who was there to check
on the Bengal monitor lizard.

7
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,919
Mother and I were both healthy,

8
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:13,268
but the poor lizard escaped,

9
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:16,322
and was trampled by
a frightening category.

10
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:20,873
The way of Karma, huh?

11
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,684
The way of God.

12
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:24,812
That's quite a story.

13
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,921
I'd assumed your father was
a mathematician, because of your name.

14
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,020
Not far from it, I was named
after a swimming pool.

15
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,782
There was a pool named "PI"?

16
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:40,782
You see, my uncle Francis was born
with too much water in his lungs.

17
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:45,791
They say the doctor swung Francis around
by the ankle, to clear the water out.

18
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:48,835
And that's what gives him
his huge chest and skinny legs,

19
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:50,543
that made him such a great swimmer.

20
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:55,413
Is Francis actually your uncle,
he said he was friend with your father?

21
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,406
Well, he's my "Honorary" Uncle.
I call him "Mamaji".

22
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:01,596
My father's best friend, my swimming guru.

23
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,434
I trained with him three times
a week at the Ashton.

24
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:08,216
His lessons would save my life in the end.

25
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,909
A mouthful of water will not harden you.

26
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:13,845
But panic will.

27
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:18,119
And remember to breath now,
don't hold your breath.

28
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,952
Good boy.

29
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,464
I hope you don't mind vegetarian.

30
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:27,238
No, no. Not at all.

31
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,949
– And your name?
– Uh?

32
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,849
You were going to tell me
how you got your name, I think.

33
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:36,515
Oh yes! I got it from something
Mamaji once told my father.

34
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:40,926
You see, most travelers collect postcards
or tea cups and their jewelries,

35
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,854
but not Mamaji.

36
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,733
Mamaji collects swimming pools.

37
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:46,515
He swims in every pool he comes upon.

38
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:58,813
One day, Mamaji said to my father,
that of all the pools in the world,

39
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:01,665
the most beautiful was
a public pool in Paris.

40
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:03,628
That the water there was so clear,

41
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,886
you could make your
morning coffee with it.

42
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,922
That a single swim there changed his life.

43
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:25,088
Before I was born, he said:

44
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:27,769
"If you want your son
to have a clean soul,

45
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:32,128
you must take him one day
to swim in the "piscine Molitor".

46
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:36,386
I never understood why my father
took this so much too heart.

47
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,020
But he did.

48
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,334
And I was named "Piscine Molitor Patel".

49
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:45,247
Imagine me trying to explain that name.

50
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:47,905
I barely made it to the age of eleven.

51
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,267
before...

52
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:49,634
before...
– Hey, "pissing"!

53
00:06:51,472 --> 00:06:53,181
Are you pissing right now?

54
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,629
Look at him, he is pissing.

55
00:06:56,739 --> 00:07:00,871
With one word, my name went
from an elegant French swimming pool

56
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:02,727
to a stinking Indian latrine.

57
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:04,751
I was "pissing" everywhere.

58
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,748
No pissing in the schoolyard!

59
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,893
Even the teacher started doing it.
Not deliberately, of course.

60
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:12,915
So then...

61
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,863
What made the kettle
to release gas too quickly?

62
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:17,344
Pissing?

63
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,108
He said pissing, guys.

64
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:23,844
Pissing!

65
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:26,415
That's enough!

66
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:32,986
When we returned the next for our
first day of school, I was prepared.

67
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:34,155
Present, sir!

68
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:35,952
Piscine Patel.

69
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:42,891
Good Morning.

70
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:45,076
I am Piscine Molitor Patel.

71
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:47,542
Know to all as:

72
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:49,822
"PI"

73
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,235
The sixteenth letter
of the Greek alphabet.

74
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,812
Which is also used in mathematics
to represent the ratio

75
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:59,591
of any circle circcomference
to its diameter.

76
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:04,482
An irrational number of infinite length,
usually rounded to three digits,

77
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:08,754
as 3 .1 4,

78
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:10,180
PI.

79
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:14,446
Very impressive... PI.

80
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,891
Now sit down.

81
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:20,783
– Arvelu Sami?
– Present.

82
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:22,575
And from then on, you were Pi?

83
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,681
Well no, not quite.

84
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,964
Nice try, Pissing.

85
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,811
But I still had the whole day ahead of me.

86
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,398
French class was next.

87
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:34,897
Je m'appelle Piscine Molitor Patel.

88
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:36,380
Dit: Pi.

89
00:08:39,072 --> 00:08:40,304
Then geography.

90
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,456
These are the first twenty
decimal places of Pi.

91
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:47,125
My last class of the day was mathematics.

92
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:55,469
4...

93
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:56,721
3...

94
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:58,375
7...

95
00:08:59,055 --> 00:08:59,890
5...

96
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,428
8...

97
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:06,719
5... 8... 5... 8....

98
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:10,927
It's right!
He's really doing this!

99
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,448
By the end of that day, I was
"PI Patel", school legend.

100
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:24,346
Mamaji tells me you're
a legend among sailors, do you?

101
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:25,700
Out there, all alone.

102
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:27,947
Oh, I don't even know how to sail.

103
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,298
And I wasn't alone out there,
Richard Parker was with me.

104
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:33,571
Richard Parker?

105
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:35,999
Mamaji, he didn't tell me everything,

106
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:38,481
he just said I should look you up
when I got back to Montreal.

107
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:40,512
So what were you doing in Pondicherry?

108
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:43,555
Writing a novel.

109
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:46,028
By the way, I enjoyed your first book.

110
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:48,536
So this new one is set in India?

111
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:52,132
No, Portugal actually.
But it's cheaper living in India.

112
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:57,055
Well, I look forward to reading it.

113
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:58,709
You can't.

114
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:00,106
I threw it out.

115
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:03,768
Two years I was trying to bring
these things to life, and they one day...

116
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:05,793
Spattered Caughin died.

117
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:08,935
Oh, I'm sorry.

118
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:13,813
So I was sitting in this
coffee house in Pondicherry

119
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,297
one afternoon mourning
my boss, when this

120
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,719
old man at the table next to me,
struck up a conversation.

121
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,197
Yeah, Mamaji he does that.

122
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:23,577
When I told him my abandoned
book, he said:

123
00:10:23,593 --> 00:10:26,405
So, a Canadian.
Let's come to French India,

124
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:28,575
and seach for a story. Well, my friend,

125
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:33,711
I know an Indian in French Canada,
with the most incredible story to tell.

126
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,820
It must be fate that the
two of you should meet.

127
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,245
Well I haven't spoken about Richard Parker
in so many years.

128
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:47,004
So what has Mamaji already told you?

129
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:50,192
He said you had a story that
would make me believe in God.

130
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,938
He would say that about a nice meal.

131
00:10:56,153 --> 00:10:58,176
As for God, I can only tell you my story.

132
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:02,490
You'll decide for yourself
what you believe.

133
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:04,026
Fair enough.

134
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,643
Let's see then. Where to begin?

135
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:09,367
Pondicherry...

136
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,251
is the French Bureau of India.

137
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:18,202
In this place, closest to the ocean,

138
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:20,736
you might think you are
in the south of France.

139
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:26,548
A few blocks inland, there's a canal.

140
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,395
Just beyond that, is Indian Pondicherry.

141
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:33,000
And the Muslim quarter
is just to the west.

142
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:37,595
When the French handed
Pondicherry back to us in 1954,

143
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,684
the town decided that some
sort of commemoration was in order.

144
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:43,677
My father was a clever businessman.

145
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,039
He came up with one.

146
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,706
He ran a hotel,
and he got the idea to open a zoo

147
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,629
in the local botanical gardens instead.

148
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:57,467
As it also happened, my mother
was a botanist in the gardens.

149
00:11:58,114 --> 00:12:01,800
They met, married, and a year later,
my brother Ravi was born.

150
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:05,069
I came two years after that.

151
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:10,097
Sounds magical.
Growing up in...

152
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:16,249
Amen.

153
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:18,569
Yeah, let's eat.

154
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:21,051
I did not know Hindus said Amen.

155
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:22,730
Catholics Hindus do

156
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:23,630
Catholic Hindus?

157
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:27,927
We get to feel guilty before
hundreds of gods, instead of just one.

158
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:30,954
But you're a Hindu first.

159
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:34,112
None of us knows God
until someone introduces us.

160
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,454
I was first introduced to God as a Hindu.

161
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:40,072
There are 33 million gods
in the Hindu regilion.

162
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:42,724
How can I not come to know a few of them?

163
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:45,782
I met Krishna, first.

164
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,194
The gods were my superheroes, growing up.

165
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,965
Hanuman, the monkey god.

166
00:13:57,315 --> 00:14:01,011
Lifting an entire mountain
to save his friend, Laksh woman.

167
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:03,156
Ganesh, the elephant headed,

168
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:07,369
risking his life to defend
the honor of his mother, Parvati.

169
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:10,977
Vishnu, the supreme soul,

170
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,066
the source of all things.

171
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:17,786
Vishnu sleeps, floating on the
shoreless cosmic ocean,

172
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:20,169
and we are the stuff of his dreaming.

173
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,336
Spectacle.

174
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:28,897
Don't let the stories and
pretty lies fool you, boys.

175
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:32,734
Religion is darkness.

176
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,472
My dear Apa believed himself
part of the new India.

177
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,087
As a child, he'd had polio.

178
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:45,592
He used to lie in bed wracked with pain,
wondering where God was.

179
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:50,237
In the end, God didn't save him,
Western medecine did.

180
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:55,988
My Amma went to college and thought

181
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,467
our familly was part
of the new India as well,

182
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:02,896
But then her parents cut her off, because
they thought she was marying Benito.

183
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:07,283
Our religion was the only link
she had to her past.

184
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,592
I met Christ in the mountains
when I was 12.

185
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:24,473
We were visiting relatives,
Pigroes in Monar.

186
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:29,259
It was a third there,
Ravi and I were terribly bored.

187
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,949
Challenge. I give you two ruppies.

188
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:34,866
Run into that church,
and drink the holy water.

189
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:05,286
You must be thirsty.

190
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:10,047
Here.

191
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:12,439
I brought you this.

192
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,090
Why would a God do that?

193
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:36,537
Why would he send his own son
to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?

194
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,179
Because he loves us.

195
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:44,438
God made himself approachable to us,
human, so we could understand him.

196
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:47,104
We can't understand God
nor his perfection.

197
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:49,715
But we can understand God son,

198
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:53,135
and his suffering,
as we would of brothers.

199
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:54,649
That made no sense!

200
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,413
Sacrificing the innocent,
to atone for the sins of the guilty,

201
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:01,948
what kind of love is that?

202
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:08,918
But this son,
I couldn't get him out of my head.

203
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:14,493
If God is so perfect, and we are not,

204
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:17,332
why would he want to create all this?

205
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:19,810
Why does he need us at all?

206
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:23,063
All you have to know is that he loves us.

207
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:27,026
God so loved his world
that he gave his only son.

208
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:31,793
The longer I listened to the priest,
the more I came to like the son of God.

209
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:35,763
Thank you Vishnu,
for introducing me to Christ.

210
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:47,940
I came to faith through Hinduism,
and I found God's love through Christ.

211
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:50,394
But God wasn't finished with me yet.

212
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:02,761
God works in mysterious ways.

213
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,321
And so it was he introduced him
to me again,

214
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:08,183
this time by the name of Allah.

215
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:30,577
My Arabic was never very good.

216
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:34,035
But the sound and feel of the words
brought me closer to God.

217
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:38,324
In performing "Salah", the ground
I touched became holly ground,

218
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:41,574
and I found a feeling of serenity
and brotherhood.

219
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:54,034
This lamb is exquisite.

220
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:57,118
It's the best dish on the table.

221
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:58,806
You're all missing out.

222
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:03,288
You only need to convert
to three more religions, Piscine,

223
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:05,625
and you'll spend your life on holiday.

224
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:09,997
Are you going to Mecca
this year, Swami Jesus?

225
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:13,657
Or to Rome for your coronation as Popeius?

226
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:15,064
Yourself, don't be silly.

227
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:17,579
Just like you like cricket,
Pi has his own interest.

228
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:20,289
No, Gita. Ravi has a point, you know?

229
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:24,145
You cannot follow three different
religions at the same time, Piscine.

230
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,120
Why not?

231
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,136
Because, believing in
everything at the same time,

232
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:33,039
is the same as not believing
in anything at all.

233
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,849
He's young, Santosh.
He's still finding his way.

234
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,392
And how can he find his way,
if he does not choose a path?

235
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,722
Listen, instead of leaping
from one region to the next,

236
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:47,653
why not start with reason?

237
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:52,332
In few hundred years, science has taken us
farther in undertanding the universe,

238
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:54,947
than the regilon has in ten thousand.

239
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,937
That is true.

240
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,044
Your father is right.

241
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:03,409
Science can teach us more
about what is out there,

242
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,826
but not what is in here.

243
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,957
Yeah. Some eat meat, some eat vegetable,

244
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,468
I do not expect us to all
to agree about everything, but

245
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:16,084
I would much prefer they'll have you
believe in something I don't agree with,

246
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:18,386
than to accept everything blindly.

247
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:22,361
And that begins with thinking rationally.

248
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:24,891
You understand?

249
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:28,814
Good.

250
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:36,987
I would like to be baptised.

251
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,171
So, you're a Christian, and a Muslim.

252
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:47,575
And an Hindu, of course.

253
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:48,823
And a Jew, I suppose.

254
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,007
Well I do teach the course
on the Kabala at the University.

255
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:54,977
And why not?
Faith is a house with many rooms.

256
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:56,513
But no room for doubt?

257
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:58,601
Oh, plenty. On every floor.

258
00:20:58,721 --> 00:20:59,845
Doubt is useful.

259
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:01,983
It keeps Faith a living thing.

260
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,235
After all, you cannot know the strength
of your faith until it has been tested.

261
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:12,340
Where' Sothom?
We shouldn't be in here without him.

262
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:13,862
Stop worrying.

263
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,474
I have seen him do this a thousand times.

264
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:23,123
I want to meet our new tigre.

265
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:25,915
Pi!

266
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:28,493
Hello? Richard Parker?

267
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:30,340
tigre?

268
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:32,333
Richard Parker was a tigre?

269
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,720
Yeah, he got this name
through a clerical error.

270
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,445
A hunter caught him drinking
from a stream when he was a cub,

271
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:39,794
and named him "Thirsty".

272
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,701
When Thirsty got too big,
the hunter sold him to our zoo,

273
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,841
but the name got switched
on the paperwork.

274
00:21:47,093 --> 00:21:50,832
The hunter was listed as Thirsty,
and the tigre was called Richard Parker.

275
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:53,178
We laughed about it.

276
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:54,529
And the name stuck!

277
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:56,314
Let's go...

278
00:21:57,493 --> 00:21:59,540
Before we get into trouble!

279
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,585
I want to see him closer.

280
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,382
You're not the zoo people!

281
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:04,449
Come on!

282
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:25,350
That's it Richard Parker.

283
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:27,034
It's for you.

284
00:22:56,986 --> 00:22:57,831
No!

285
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,579
What are you thinking?

286
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:02,912
Are you out of your mind?

287
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,015
Who gave you the permission
to come back here?

288
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,968
You just ignored everything
I've ever taught you?

289
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:11,818
I-I just wanted to say Hello to him.

290
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:14,212
You think that tigre is your friend.

291
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:16,862
He's an animal, not a playmate!

292
00:23:17,962 --> 00:23:19,709
Animals have souls.

293
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:23,126
I have seen it in their eyes.

294
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:26,369
Find Selvan.

295
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:45,161
Animals do not think like we do.

296
00:23:45,862 --> 00:23:49,806
People who forget that,
get themselves killed. That tigre...

297
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:52,949
is not your friend.

298
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,690
When you look into his eyes,

299
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:57,859
you are seeing your own emotions
reflected back at you.

300
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,712
Nothing else.

301
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:02,517
You stupid.
Say "I'm sorry."

302
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,567
What have you done, Piscine?

303
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:08,595
You know what your father said
about coming back here?

304
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:10,105
I am sorry.

305
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:12,244
I was...

306
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,061
What are you thinking?

307
00:24:14,157 --> 00:24:16,150
This is between a father and his sons.

308
00:24:16,295 --> 00:24:17,531
Selvan, cut away!

309
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:20,955
He said he's sorry.
You'll just scare them for life.

310
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:23,826
Scare them?
That boy almost lost his arm.

311
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:25,546
But he's just a boy.

312
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:27,383
He will be a man sooner than you think.

313
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:30,217
And this is a lesson I do not want them
ever to forget!

314
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:32,157
Selvan!

315
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:23,224
<i>.. and so has placed the country
in a state of emergency</i>

316
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:25,727
<i>Under the directive,
the states of cultural...</i>

317
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:43,979
Things changed after
the day of Apa's lesson.

318
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:46,503
The world had lost
some of its enchantment.

319
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:51,436
School was a bore, nothing
but facts, fractions and french.

320
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:55,419
Words and patterns
that went on and on without end,

321
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:58,074
just like my irrational nickname.

322
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:04,426
I grew restless,

323
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:08,061
searching for something that might
bring meaning back into my life.

324
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:11,780
And then, I met Anandi.

325
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,494
Mother made me study music.

326
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:24,740
And one day, my teacher
came down with the flew.

327
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,540
He asked if I could take his place,
playing rythms for the dance class.

328
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:46,411
No!

329
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:51,618
If you do not concentrate, you cannot
express your love of God through dance.

330
00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:54,304
Feel the ground beneath your feet.

331
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:56,774
Open your 'Gisauthon' to the horizon.

332
00:26:57,154 --> 00:27:01,819
Let that spiritual energy pass
through you, and out into the world.

333
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:03,081
Troughout 'Bineia'.

334
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:07,378
Anandi, come to the front, lead them.

335
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,575
Why are you following me?

336
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:54,114
What?

337
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:56,336
You were following me.

338
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:01,465
What does this mean?

339
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,500
In the dance, you went from 'batanka',

340
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:08,387
which means the forest,

341
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:11,665
And then you did...
and you did...

342
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:16,526
'Sanputa', which means
something that is hidden.

343
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:18,827
Now for that you did this.

344
00:28:20,443 --> 00:28:22,211
And then you did 'Chatura'.

345
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:26,054
But at the very end, you did... this.

346
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,153
None of the others dancers did that.

347
00:28:30,312 --> 00:28:32,782
What did you mean,
the God of love is hiding in the forest?

348
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:35,453
No, that also means 'the Lotus flower'.

349
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:39,530
Lotus flowers hiding in the forest?

350
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:42,617
Why would a Lotus flower
hide in the forest?

351
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:52,414
This is Richard Parker.

352
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,520
He's the most magnificent creature
we've ever had here.

353
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:59,605
Look at the way he's turning his head.

354
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:04,724
Showing off... like a dancer.

355
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:07,559
No. He heard something.

356
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:12,262
He is listening, you see?

357
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:23,537
We have talked about it for some time.

358
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:25,474
Do you understand what I'm saying?

359
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:26,789
Pi!

360
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,969
Uh sorry, you've been...

361
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:31,480
Worried.

362
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:33,816
For my family.

363
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,201
For animals are worth far more
abroad than here in India.

364
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:41,177
And if the town council stops supporting
us, I don't know where we will be.

365
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,329
So what is worth, we have to do.

366
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,636
Do you understand?

367
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:50,554
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

368
00:29:50,984 --> 00:29:53,003
We are leaving India.

369
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,721
What?

370
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,430
We are selling the zoo.

371
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:03,579
The zoo was never ours to sell,
the land belongs to the town.

372
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:04,857
But the animals are ours.

373
00:30:04,974 --> 00:30:08,067
and if we sell them, we will have
enough to start a new life.

374
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,218
But where will we go?

375
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:11,142
Or life is here, Apa!

376
00:30:11,214 --> 00:30:12,334
Canada.

377
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,219
I have some opportunities
for work in Winnipeg.

378
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:18,325
I'll be shipping most of the animals
for sale in North America,

379
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:20,987
we can get freighter passage
for the whole family.

380
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,075
So... It's settled.

381
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:27,107
We will sail like Columbus.

382
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,212
But Columbus was looking for India!

383
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:42,081
It takes a lot of work to set a zoo.

384
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:46,842
Before we left, Anandi and I had time
enough to break each other's heart.

385
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:50,668
Of course, I promised
I would come back one day.

386
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:52,930
It's funny...

387
00:30:53,714 --> 00:30:57,013
I remember everything else
about our last day.

388
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:59,532
But I don't remember saying goodbye.

389
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:09,563
Pi?

390
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,061
They're serving diner below.

391
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:25,765
Piscine.

392
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:28,625
You have a whole life ahead of you.

393
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:32,103
We are doing this for you and Ravi.

394
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:36,372
Come inside and have some diner.

395
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,580
Vegetarian, please.

396
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:51,485
Oh, my sons and I are vegetarians.

397
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:53,373
Do you have anything-
No no no no no!

398
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:55,104
Not for gravy.

399
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:56,897
You don't want gravy?

400
00:32:04,469 --> 00:32:05,723
Pas de problème.

401
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:07,111
Pardon.

402
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:27,830
Pas de problème.

403
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,100
Hello.

404
00:33:04,511 --> 00:33:05,984
I am happy Buddist.

405
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:09,482
So I eat rice next to gravy.

406
00:33:10,374 --> 00:33:13,047
I'm sure, gravy is not meat.

407
00:33:13,944 --> 00:33:16,794
Is taste. You try?

408
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:41,100
Don't worry.

409
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:46,811
We will have plenty of fresh supplies
after we stop in Manila.

410
00:33:48,974 --> 00:33:51,458
Why give Orange Juice tranquilizers?

411
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,837
He's not gonna cause any trouble.

412
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:58,662
The stress of traveling
is not good for the animals,

413
00:33:58,676 --> 00:34:01,066
and it helps with the sea sickness.

414
00:34:02,802 --> 00:34:05,778
We don't want to be cleaning up,

415
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,654
after a sea sick orang utan.

416
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,079
Do we?

417
00:34:17,383 --> 00:34:18,936
My father was a businessman.

418
00:34:19,484 --> 00:34:22,030
He had never attended the animals himself.

419
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:28,308
I realized leaving India must have
been harder for him than it was for me.

420
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:34,961
So?

421
00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:37,844
Yeah, have I forgotten anything?

422
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:39,574
I think you set the stage,

423
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:43,151
So far, we have an Indian boy
named after a French swimming pool,

424
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:45,623
and a Japanese ship full of animals,
heading to Canada.

425
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:47,667
Yes!

426
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:51,478
Now we have to send our boy
into the middle of the Pacific, and...

427
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,549
And make me believe in God.

428
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:59,032
Yeah.
We'll get there.

429
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:09,556
It was four days out of Manila,
above the Mariana trench,

430
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,558
the deepest part on earth.

431
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:20,477
Our ship, the Simsum, pushed on,
polishly in different surroundings.

432
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:26,694
It moved with the slow massive
confidence of a continent.

433
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,398
Did you hear that, Ravi?

434
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:06,824
Yes, what do you think?

435
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:08,770
It's a thunderstorm, let's go and watch.

436
00:36:09,062 --> 00:36:10,399
Are you crazy?

437
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:12,830
We will get hit by lightning.

438
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:15,475
No, we won't, it'll hit the bridge first.

439
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:19,601
Don't tempt the storm, Pi.

440
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,903
Oyé!

441
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:18,456
Hurray!

442
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,021
God's storm!

443
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:09,040
Ma!

444
00:38:10,864 --> 00:38:11,671
Apa!

445
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:14,511
Ravi!

446
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,836
Get out!
Get out!

447
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,717
Please save my family!

448
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:10,141
Don't scare, okay?
Stay here!

449
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:12,372
You have to help my family!

450
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:19,038
We have to help them!

451
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,161
My family is back there!

452
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,019
Leave now!

453
00:39:23,116 --> 00:39:24,491
We have to go!

454
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,039
Who let all the animals out, uh?

455
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,596
– We have to go now!
– No please, my father!

456
00:39:28,724 --> 00:39:30,306
He's got to go!

457
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,404
There! Look there!

458
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:57,980
Zebra! Zebra!

459
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,084
Hey!

460
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:01,482
Over here!
Over here!

461
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:38,076
Richard Parker?

462
00:41:38,348 --> 00:41:39,694
No! No!

463
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:43,810
No! Go away! Go away!

464
00:43:51,447 --> 00:43:53,351
Ama!

465
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,412
Apa!

466
00:43:57,361 --> 00:43:58,584
Ravi!

467
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:02,585
I'm sorry.

468
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:08,556
I'm sorry!

469
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,807
Where is your buoy, Orange Juice?

470
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:45,995
Don't worry.
I bet mother and father found it.

471
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:51,516
They'll all be here soon.

472
00:48:00,134 --> 00:48:02,958
Hello!

473
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,986
Hello!

474
00:48:10,684 --> 00:48:13,082
Anybody!

475
00:49:16,274 --> 00:49:17,217
No!

476
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:22,008
Stop it! No!
Stop it! Stop it!

477
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:27,647
No!

478
00:49:29,084 --> 00:49:30,204
No!

479
00:49:32,115 --> 00:49:33,235
No!

480
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:16,638
Sorry Orange Juice,

481
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,461
I don't have any sea sickness
medecine for you.

482
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:22,375
Is it right?

483
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:24,851
Is it right?

484
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:44,609
No!

485
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:46,069
No!

486
00:51:46,468 --> 00:51:48,696
No! No!

487
00:52:08,407 --> 00:52:09,527
Com'on!

488
00:52:09,979 --> 00:52:11,099
Com'on!

489
00:52:11,407 --> 00:52:12,715
Com'on!

490
00:56:45,128 --> 00:56:47,108
My name is Pi Patel.

491
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,798
I have been on a ship wreck.

492
00:56:51,145 --> 00:56:53,730
I am on a lifeboat, alone...

493
00:56:56,076 --> 00:56:57,628
with a tigre.

494
00:56:59,401 --> 00:57:00,851
Please send help.

495
00:58:48,636 --> 00:58:49,785
God...

496
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:52,837
I give myself to You.

497
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:55,354
I am your vassal.

498
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:01,154
Whatever comes, I want to know.

499
00:59:03,728 --> 00:59:04,954
Show me.

500
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,223
There are no lines.

501
00:59:22,012 --> 00:59:25,980
Set ​​your house in order,
and dig in for the battle to survive.

502
00:59:26,687 --> 00:59:31,811
Establish a strict schedule for eating,
keeping watch, and getting rest.

503
00:59:32,473 --> 00:59:35,236
Do not drink urine or seawater.

504
00:59:37,648 --> 00:59:41,203
Keep busy, but avoid unnecessary exertion.

505
00:59:44,365 --> 00:59:47,482
The mind can be kept get occupied
by playing card games,

506
00:59:47,557 --> 00:59:49,896
"Twenty Questions" or "Eye Spy".

507
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:57,888
Community singing is another
sure fire way to lift the spirit.

508
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,823
Telling stories is highly recommended.

509
01:00:07,116 --> 01:00:09,761
Above all, don't lose hope.

510
01:00:18,976 --> 01:00:22,614
Few things can sap the spirit
faster than sea sickness.

511
01:00:23,901 --> 01:00:27,987
Waves are more strongly felt when
the boat turns sideway to the current.

512
01:00:28,613 --> 01:00:32,761
A sea anchor is used as a drag
to keep the boats head to the wind.

513
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:35,968
Proper use of them can increase control,

514
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:38,775
and reduce sea sickness
during rough seas.

515
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,260
For castaways who must share their
lifeboats with large dangerous carnivals,

516
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:47,669
it's advisable to establish
your territory as your own.

517
01:00:48,154 --> 01:00:50,440
Try this method.
Step 1:

518
01:00:50,724 --> 01:00:53,548
Choose a day when waves
are moderate, but regular.

519
01:00:54,371 --> 01:00:57,267
Step 2: With the lifeboat
facing into the waves,

520
01:00:57,492 --> 01:01:01,798
making the ride as comfortable as
possible, blow your whistle soothingly.

521
01:01:02,372 --> 01:01:05,902
Step 3: Turn the lifeboat
sideways to the waves,

522
01:01:05,905 --> 01:01:08,682
accompanied by harsh,
aggressive use of the whistle.

523
01:01:09,362 --> 01:01:13,310
With sufficient repetition, the animal
will associate the sound of the whistle

524
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:15,148
with the discomfort of sea sickness.

525
01:01:16,553 --> 01:01:19,297
Similar methods have long
been used by circus trainers,

526
01:01:19,816 --> 01:01:22,703
tough they generally
lack access to rough seas.

527
01:01:22,984 --> 01:01:25,512
Let the trumpets blow!

528
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:29,509
Let the drummers begin!

529
01:01:30,074 --> 01:01:32,335
Prepare to be amazed!

530
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:37,667
Organized for your enjoyment,
and instruction.

531
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,783
The show you've been
waiting for all you rlife,

532
01:01:42,169 --> 01:01:44,768
will soon begin!

533
01:01:46,962 --> 01:01:49,403
Are you ready for the miracle event?

534
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:53,066
Well done! I give to you,

535
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:57,339
the astounding Bengal tigre!

536
01:02:08,035 --> 01:02:09,238
Hello, Richard Parker.

537
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:12,242
Sorry for the choppy ride.

538
01:02:46,768 --> 01:02:48,858
Mine! You understand?

539
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,970
Yours! Mine!

540
01:02:54,844 --> 01:02:56,090
You understand?

541
01:03:08,754 --> 01:03:12,679
Step 4: Disregard steps 1 through 3.

542
01:03:41,529 --> 01:03:42,842
Here, Richard Parker.

543
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,848
I got some water for you.

544
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:04,034
In the zoo, we fed the tigres
in average of five kilos of meat a day.

545
01:04:04,223 --> 01:04:06,640
Richard Paker will getting hungry soon.

546
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,196
Tigres are powerful swimmers,

547
01:04:11,577 --> 01:04:13,051
and if he gets hungry enough,

548
01:04:13,113 --> 01:04:16,805
I'm afraid the little bit of water
between us won't be any protection.

549
01:04:17,422 --> 01:04:19,593
I need to find a way to feed him.

550
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:23,620
I can eat the biscuits, but
God made tigres carnivores,

551
01:04:23,837 --> 01:04:25,541
So I must learn to catch fish.

552
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:27,007
If I don't,

553
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,105
I'm afraid his last meal
will be a skinny vegetarian boy.

554
01:04:40,972 --> 01:04:42,623
Patience!

555
01:07:07,347 --> 01:07:09,652
Wait!
Thinking.

556
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:41,913
Two cartons of biscuits...

557
01:08:44,075 --> 01:08:46,428
93 cans of water...

558
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,470
I'm sorry.

559
01:10:02,648 --> 01:10:04,361
I'm sorry.

560
01:10:06,864 --> 01:10:08,690
Thank you, Lord Vishnu!

561
01:10:09,728 --> 01:10:13,801
Thank you for coming in the form
of a fish and saving our life!

562
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:15,868
Thank you!

563
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:28,189
Of course, I brought all the biscuits
and water on the raft with me,

564
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:30,049
to keep them safe...

565
01:12:30,668 --> 01:12:31,788
Eat it.

566
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:38,969
Hunger can change everything you
ever thought you knew about yourself.

567
01:13:20,536 --> 01:13:21,921
Here, it's yours!

568
01:15:14,922 --> 01:15:16,823
It's time to settle this.

569
01:15:17,515 --> 01:15:20,935
If we're going to live together,
we have to learn to communicate.

570
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,722
Maybe but the Jutbaka can't be teamed.

571
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:27,721
But with God's will, it can be trimmed.

572
01:16:37,303 --> 01:16:38,276
No!

573
01:16:46,881 --> 01:16:47,656
Good.

574
01:18:07,113 --> 01:18:09,602
Go, Richard Parker.
Go!

575
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:12,612
Go on home, I'll leave you alone.

576
01:18:13,206 --> 01:18:15,454
I'll respect that, promise.

577
01:18:20,382 --> 01:18:22,056
Go! Come on!

578
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:32,220
Yes!

579
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:11,017
I never thought a small piece of shit
could bring me so much happiness.

580
01:19:12,245 --> 01:19:17,163
That a pile of tools, a bucket,
a knife, a pencil,

581
01:19:17,235 --> 01:19:19,615
might become my greatest treasures,

582
01:19:20,065 --> 01:19:24,339
without knowing Richard Parker was here
might ever bring me peace.

583
01:19:24,846 --> 01:19:26,299
In times like these,

584
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:30,715
I remember that he has as little
experience of the real world as I do.

585
01:19:31,408 --> 01:19:34,401
We were both raised in a zoo
by the same master.

586
01:19:34,829 --> 01:19:36,427
Now we've been orphaned,

587
01:19:36,807 --> 01:19:39,148
left to face our ultimate master together.

588
01:19:40,116 --> 01:19:43,432
Without Richard Parker,
I would have died by now.

589
01:19:43,809 --> 01:19:45,890
My fear of him keeps me alert.

590
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:49,427
Tending to his needs gives my life focus.

591
01:19:54,318 --> 01:19:55,579
Dolphins.

592
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:57,790
Hey, Richard Parker!

593
01:20:15,427 --> 01:20:16,823
Hey!

594
01:24:26,323 --> 01:24:29,934
Mortal, all I have left and hang on to.

595
01:24:30,003 --> 01:24:33,175
Everything make stopped, fragmented.

596
01:24:34,096 --> 01:24:38,580
Can't tell day dreams, night dreams
from reality anymore.

597
01:24:57,262 --> 01:24:59,328
A storm, Richard Parker!

598
01:25:59,962 --> 01:26:02,404
Christ needs you, God!

599
01:26:02,792 --> 01:26:04,952
Longing for his words!

600
01:26:05,106 --> 01:26:08,742
The compassionate!
The mercyful!

601
01:26:14,648 --> 01:26:15,900
Come out!

602
01:26:17,643 --> 01:26:21,790
Richard Parker! Come out,
you have to see this!

603
01:26:23,476 --> 01:26:25,164
It's beautiful!

604
01:26:36,461 --> 01:26:39,878
Relieve yourself!
He's come to us!

605
01:26:40,759 --> 01:26:42,709
It's a vision!

606
01:26:55,891 --> 01:26:59,466
Come on, this is God, Richard Parker!

607
01:27:12,573 --> 01:27:15,247
Why are you scaring him?

608
01:27:17,012 --> 01:27:18,985
I've lost my family,

609
01:27:19,326 --> 01:27:21,359
I've lost everything!

610
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:26,152
I surrender!
What else do you want?

611
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,054
I'm sorry, Richard Parker.

612
01:30:21,617 --> 01:30:23,951
We're dying, Richard Parker.

613
01:30:28,311 --> 01:30:29,635
I'm sorry.

614
01:31:02,142 --> 01:31:03,631
Amma...

615
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:07,195
Apa, Ravi.

616
01:31:09,062 --> 01:31:12,032
Apa, Ravi, I'm going to see you soon.

617
01:31:20,733 --> 01:31:23,697
Can you feel the rain?

618
01:31:42,804 --> 01:31:44,087
God...

619
01:31:45,095 --> 01:31:47,838
Thank you for giving me my life.

620
01:31:49,725 --> 01:31:51,309
I'm ready now.

621
01:32:22,943 --> 01:32:24,763
Richard Parker.

622
01:36:31,231 --> 01:36:32,978
Hey. Get rid of me!

623
01:36:33,116 --> 01:36:34,478
It's my bed.

624
01:38:42,733 --> 01:38:44,546
It was a human tooth.

625
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:47,654
Don't you see the island was carnivorous?

626
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:51,597
Canívorous?
Like a Venus fly trap?

627
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:54,016
Yes. The whole island.

628
01:38:54,697 --> 01:38:58,619
The plants, the water and those pools,
the very ground itself.

629
01:38:59,806 --> 01:39:02,465
During the day, those pools
held fresh water.

630
01:39:02,849 --> 01:39:07,712
But at night, some chemical process
turned the water in those pools into acid.

631
01:39:08,554 --> 01:39:10,724
Acid that disolved those fish.

632
01:39:11,082 --> 01:39:13,512
The sound of meerkats
scaring to the trees,

633
01:39:13,513 --> 01:39:15,722
and Richard Parker running to the boat.

634
01:39:16,059 --> 01:39:17,549
But where'd the tooth come from?

635
01:39:18,075 --> 01:39:21,012
Years ago, some poor fellow just like me

636
01:39:21,013 --> 01:39:23,822
must have found himself
stranded on that island.

637
01:39:24,171 --> 01:39:26,598
And like me, he thought
he might there forever.

638
01:39:27,637 --> 01:39:32,106
But all that the island gave him by day,
it took away again by night.

639
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:38,531
To think how many hours he spent,
with only meerkats for company.

640
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:41,556
How much loneliness taken on him.

641
01:39:41,591 --> 01:39:44,160
All I know is that eventually he died,

642
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:45,796
and the island digested him,

643
01:39:46,595 --> 01:39:48,714
leaving behind only his teeth.

644
01:39:50,841 --> 01:39:53,615
I saw how my life would end,
if I stayed on that island.

645
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,722
Alone, forgotten.

646
01:39:56,815 --> 01:40:00,503
I had to get back to the world,
or die trying.

647
01:40:04,964 --> 01:40:07,352
I spent the next day preparing the boat.

648
01:40:07,974 --> 01:40:10,039
I filled my stores with fresh water,

649
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:12,854
ate sea weed until my stomach
could take no more,

650
01:40:12,935 --> 01:40:15,303
and brought as many
meerkats as I could fit

651
01:40:15,304 --> 01:40:17,671
into the storey's locker
for Richard Parker.

652
01:40:19,733 --> 01:40:21,835
I couldn't leave without him, of course.

653
01:40:21,836 --> 01:40:23,201
It would be killing him.

654
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:30,310
And so I waited for his return.

655
01:40:30,656 --> 01:40:32,085
I knew he wouldn't be late.

656
01:40:32,747 --> 01:40:35,535
Richard Parker!

657
01:40:48,533 --> 01:40:50,642
No one has seen
that floating island since.

658
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:54,339
And you won't read about
those trees in any nature book.

659
01:40:54,588 --> 01:40:57,902
And yet, if I hadn't found
those shores, I would have died.

660
01:40:58,564 --> 01:41:04,012
And if I hadn't discovered that tooth,
I would have been lost, alone forever.

661
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:08,423
Even when God seemed to have
abandoned me, he was watching.

662
01:41:08,998 --> 01:41:12,964
Even when he seemed indifferent
to my suffering, he was watching.

663
01:41:13,376 --> 01:41:17,326
And when I was beyond all hope
of saving, he gave me rest.

664
01:41:17,703 --> 01:41:20,987
And gave me a sign to continue my journey.

665
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:35,606
By the time we reached the Mexican shore,

666
01:41:35,947 --> 01:41:38,079
I was afraid to let go off the boat.

667
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:42,280
My strength was gone, I was so weak.

668
01:41:42,809 --> 01:41:48,065
I was afraid that in two feet of water,
so close to deliverance, I would drown.

669
01:41:58,138 --> 01:42:02,042
I struggled to shore,
and fell upon the sand.

670
01:42:02,353 --> 01:42:07,191
It was warm and soft, like pressing
my face against the cheek of God.

671
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:12,089
And somewhere, two eyes were smiling,
that having me there.

672
01:42:17,025 --> 01:42:19,769
I was so spent, I could hardly move.

673
01:42:26,538 --> 01:42:28,935
And so Richard Parker went ahead of me.

674
01:42:31,311 --> 01:42:34,951
He stretched his legs,
and walked along the shore.

675
01:42:38,617 --> 01:42:41,207
At the edge of the jungle, he stopped.

676
01:42:42,436 --> 01:42:44,638
I was certain he was going
to look back to me.

677
01:42:45,294 --> 01:42:47,909
Flatten his ears to his head, proud,

678
01:42:48,316 --> 01:42:52,055
that he would bring our relationship
to an end in some way.

679
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:56,840
But he just teared ahead into the jungle.

680
01:43:00,529 --> 01:43:03,051
And then, Richard Parker,
my fierce compagnon,

681
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:05,144
the terrible one who kept me alive...

682
01:43:08,163 --> 01:43:11,496
disappeared forever from my life.

683
01:43:18,113 --> 01:43:21,985
After a few hours, a member
of my own species found me.

684
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:25,268
He left and returned with a group
who carried me away.

685
01:43:27,609 --> 01:43:29,781
And I wept like a child,

686
01:43:29,884 --> 01:43:33,207
not because I was overwhelmed
of having survived, altough I was.

687
01:43:35,192 --> 01:43:38,404
I was whiping because
Richard Parker left me...

688
01:43:38,816 --> 01:43:40,994
so unceremoniously.

689
01:43:42,944 --> 01:43:44,575
It broke my heart.

690
01:43:50,736 --> 01:43:52,520
You know, my father was right.

691
01:43:53,521 --> 01:43:56,121
Richard Parker never saw me
as his friend.

692
01:43:57,109 --> 01:44:00,266
After all we had been through,
he didn't even look back.

693
01:44:01,781 --> 01:44:03,850
But I have to believe
there was more in these eyes

694
01:44:03,866 --> 01:44:06,602
than my own reflection
staring back at me.

695
01:44:07,396 --> 01:44:09,073
I know it, I felt it.

696
01:44:10,401 --> 01:44:11,996
Even if I can't prove it.

697
01:44:17,846 --> 01:44:22,485
You know, I've left so much behind,
my family, the zoo, India, Anandi...

698
01:44:23,316 --> 01:44:27,523
I suppose India and the whole of life
becomes an act of letting go.

699
01:44:27,955 --> 01:44:30,365
But what will always hurt the most,

700
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:34,334
is not taking a moment to say goodbye.

701
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:40,246
I was never able to thank my father,
for all I know from him.

702
01:44:40,822 --> 01:44:43,312
To tell him without his lessons...

703
01:44:44,242 --> 01:44:46,705
I would never have survived!

704
01:44:48,794 --> 01:44:50,696
I know Richard Parker's a tigre, but...

705
01:44:50,766 --> 01:44:54,367
I wish I had said:
"It's over, we survived...

706
01:44:55,273 --> 01:44:59,127
thank you for saving my life.
I love you, Richard Parker.

707
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:01,925
You'll always be with me".

708
01:45:03,356 --> 01:45:04,865
But I can't be with you.

709
01:45:12,794 --> 01:45:14,460
I don't know what to say.

710
01:45:21,268 --> 01:45:23,941
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

711
01:45:27,246 --> 01:45:28,551
It is a lot to take in...

712
01:45:29,853 --> 01:45:31,720
to figure out what that all means.

713
01:45:32,355 --> 01:45:35,860
No, if it happened, it happened.
Why should it have to mean anything?

714
01:45:38,010 --> 01:45:40,320
But some of it is pretty incredible.

715
01:45:41,095 --> 01:45:43,507
See, I was the only one
who survived the ship wreck.

716
01:45:44,092 --> 01:45:47,268
The Japanese shipping company
sent two men to talk to me,

717
01:45:47,548 --> 01:45:49,922
in the Mexican hospital
where I was recovering.

718
01:45:52,454 --> 01:45:54,065
I still have a copy of the report.

719
01:45:56,298 --> 01:45:58,434
There are insurance claims to settle.

720
01:45:59,607 --> 01:46:01,835
They wanted to find out why the ship sank.

721
01:46:03,453 --> 01:46:05,333
They didn't believe me, either.

722
01:46:08,255 --> 01:46:09,874
Thousands of meerkats,

723
01:46:09,961 --> 01:46:13,771
on an floating carnivorous island,
and no one has ever seen it.

724
01:46:13,882 --> 01:46:16,427
Yes. Just like I told you.

725
01:46:16,691 --> 01:46:18,069
Bananas don't float.

726
01:46:19,699 --> 01:46:23,046
You said the orang utan floated
to you on a bundle of bananas,

727
01:46:23,078 --> 01:46:24,546
but bananas don't float.

728
01:46:26,475 --> 01:46:28,505
Of course they do,
you try it for yourself!

729
01:46:30,126 --> 01:46:34,425
In any case, we are not here
to talk about bananas or meerkats.

730
01:46:34,494 --> 01:46:37,129
Look, I just told a long story,
and I'm very tired.

731
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:42,810
We are here because a Japanese
cargo ship sank in the Pacific!

732
01:46:43,179 --> 01:46:44,961
Something I'll never forget.

733
01:46:46,686 --> 01:46:48,594
I lost my whole family.

734
01:46:58,062 --> 01:46:59,890
We don't mean to push you.

735
01:47:01,296 --> 01:47:03,329
And you have our deepest sympathies.

736
01:47:04,409 --> 01:47:06,486
But we have come a long way,

737
01:47:06,645 --> 01:47:09,793
and we are not closer to
understanding why the ship sank.

738
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:11,653
Because I don't know!

739
01:47:12,031 --> 01:47:13,777
I was asleep, something woke me up,

740
01:47:13,778 --> 01:47:16,321
it could have been an explosion,
I can't be sure.

741
01:47:16,653 --> 01:47:18,064
And then the ship sank.

742
01:47:18,852 --> 01:47:20,316
What else do you want from me?

743
01:47:20,789 --> 01:47:22,757
A story that won't
make us look like fools.

744
01:47:23,147 --> 01:47:25,853
We need a simpler story for our report.

745
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,599
One our company can understand.

746
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,637
A story we can all believe.

747
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:36,976
So a story without things
you've never seen before.

748
01:47:37,476 --> 01:47:38,550
That's right.

749
01:47:39,255 --> 01:47:42,767
Without surprises, without...
animals or islands.

750
01:47:43,489 --> 01:47:46,157
Yes. The truth.

751
01:47:47,888 --> 01:47:50,614
So... what did you do?

752
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:56,618
I told them another story.

753
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,189
Four of us survived,

754
01:48:00,377 --> 01:48:02,385
the cook and the sailor
were already aboard.

755
01:48:03,024 --> 01:48:04,982
The cook threw me a life buoy
and pull me aboard,

756
01:48:04,996 --> 01:48:08,142
and Mother held on on some bananas
and made it to the life boat.

757
01:48:10,235 --> 01:48:13,362
The cook... was a disgusting man.

758
01:48:13,415 --> 01:48:14,946
He ate a rat!

759
01:48:15,994 --> 01:48:17,289
We had food enough for weeks,

760
01:48:17,313 --> 01:48:19,728
but he found the rat in the
first few days and he killed it,

761
01:48:20,109 --> 01:48:22,068
he dried it in the sun and ate it.

762
01:48:23,243 --> 01:48:24,828
Just a brute bad man.

763
01:48:27,049 --> 01:48:29,331
But he was ressourcefull.

764
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:33,115
It was his idea to build
the raft to catch fish,

765
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:36,724
we would have died in those
first few days without him.

766
01:48:39,369 --> 01:48:43,292
The sailor was the same man who
brought rice and gravy, the buddhist.

767
01:48:44,007 --> 01:48:47,514
He didn't understand much what he said,
only that he was suffering.

768
01:48:47,823 --> 01:48:50,057
He'd broken his leg horribly in the fall.

769
01:48:50,374 --> 01:48:53,377
We tried to set it best we could,
but the leg became infected.

770
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:57,633
And the cook said that we had
to do something, but he... died.

771
01:48:58,788 --> 01:49:02,001
The cook said he'd do it, but mother
and I had to hold the man down.

772
01:49:02,126 --> 01:49:04,812
And I believed him, we needed to do it.

773
01:49:05,482 --> 01:49:06,602
So...

774
01:49:09,538 --> 01:49:11,875
I kept saying "I'm sorry, I'm sorry".

775
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:16,039
He just kept looking at me,
his eyes were so...

776
01:49:19,558 --> 01:49:22,128
I'll never understand the point
of that man suffering.

777
01:49:24,057 --> 01:49:25,788
I can still hear him:

778
01:49:26,312 --> 01:49:29,619
"I happy with this,
you need rice and gravy."

779
01:49:35,291 --> 01:49:38,575
We didn't save him, of course.
He died.

780
01:49:40,358 --> 01:49:42,347
The morning after the cook
caught his first Dorado

781
01:49:42,348 --> 01:49:44,712
and I didn't understand
what he'd done at first,

782
01:49:44,848 --> 01:49:47,657
but Mother did, and I had never
seen Mother so angry.

783
01:49:49,553 --> 01:49:51,462
"Stop whining and be happy", he said.

784
01:49:51,463 --> 01:49:54,454
"We need more food or we'll die,
thas was the whole point!"

785
01:49:54,489 --> 01:49:56,062
What was the whole point, Madrast?

786
01:49:56,419 --> 01:49:59,945
You let that poor boy dying
only to get bait, you monster!

787
01:50:02,267 --> 01:50:05,303
He's got furious, he started
towards her with his fists raised,

788
01:50:05,386 --> 01:50:08,186
And Mother slapped him hard
right across the face!

789
01:50:08,522 --> 01:50:09,821
I was stunned!

790
01:50:10,494 --> 01:50:14,020
I thought he was gonna
kill her right then.

791
01:50:14,426 --> 01:50:15,884
It would end...

792
01:50:17,927 --> 01:50:20,765
The cook didn't stop
with bait either, no...

793
01:50:22,342 --> 01:50:23,823
The sailor...

794
01:50:25,555 --> 01:50:28,061
he went the same way as the rat went.

795
01:50:30,391 --> 01:50:33,055
The cook was a resourceful man.

796
01:50:37,201 --> 01:50:39,128
It was a week later that he...

797
01:50:41,023 --> 01:50:42,447
because of me.

798
01:50:43,333 --> 01:50:45,845
Because I couldn't hold on
this stupid turtle.

799
01:50:46,984 --> 01:50:49,010
It slipped out of my hand and swam away,

800
01:50:49,584 --> 01:50:51,926
and the cook came up, and he punched me
on the side of my head,

801
01:50:51,927 --> 01:50:54,160
and my teeth clacked and I saw stars,

802
01:50:54,418 --> 01:50:57,149
I thought he was gonna hit me again,
but Mother started pounding on him,

803
01:50:57,243 --> 01:50:59,406
with her face screaming
"monster, monster!"

804
01:50:59,552 --> 01:51:01,076
She held with me go to the raft.

805
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:02,682
'Nipola!"

806
01:51:02,969 --> 01:51:05,330
I thought she was coming with me,
or I'd never have!

807
01:51:08,994 --> 01:51:11,144
I don't know why
I didn't make her go first.

808
01:51:13,511 --> 01:51:15,333
I think about that every day.

809
01:51:21,773 --> 01:51:24,980
I jumped over and turned back
just as the knife came out.

810
01:51:29,594 --> 01:51:31,284
There wasn't anything I could do.

811
01:51:33,889 --> 01:51:35,469
Couldn't look away...

812
01:51:40,143 --> 01:51:42,135
He threw her body overboard,

813
01:51:44,113 --> 01:51:45,646
and then the sharks came.

814
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:47,824
And I saw her, they...

815
01:51:52,405 --> 01:51:53,431
saw...

816
01:51:59,945 --> 01:52:01,623
Next day, I killed him.

817
01:52:03,691 --> 01:52:06,508
He didn't even fight back,
he knew he'd gone too far.

818
01:52:06,697 --> 01:52:08,128
Even by his own standards.

819
01:52:10,737 --> 01:52:14,355
He left the knife out of the bench, and
I did to him what he did to the sailor.

820
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:21,011
He was such an evil man,
but was still hum...

821
01:52:23,412 --> 01:52:25,131
He brought the evil out of me!

822
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,973
And I have to live with that.

823
01:52:36,624 --> 01:52:38,844
I was alone in the lifeboat...

824
01:52:40,376 --> 01:52:42,722
drifting across the Pacific ocean...

825
01:52:43,915 --> 01:52:45,201
and I survived.

826
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:53,034
After that, there had no more questions.

827
01:52:54,435 --> 01:52:57,587
The investigators didn't seem
to like the story, exactly.

828
01:52:58,265 --> 01:53:01,558
They thanked me.
They wished me well...

829
01:53:01,844 --> 01:53:03,010
and they left.

830
01:53:09,938 --> 01:53:11,816
So the story is...

831
01:53:14,455 --> 01:53:16,316
Both the zebra and the sailor...

832
01:53:17,175 --> 01:53:18,295
broke their leg.

833
01:53:19,592 --> 01:53:22,074
And a hyena killed the zebra
and the orang utan.

834
01:53:23,163 --> 01:53:24,766
So...

835
01:53:25,105 --> 01:53:26,669
The hyena is the cook...

836
01:53:27,682 --> 01:53:29,600
the sailor is the zebra...

837
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:32,231
your mother is the orang utan.

838
01:53:33,355 --> 01:53:34,149
and...

839
01:53:34,797 --> 01:53:35,897
you're...

840
01:53:37,217 --> 01:53:38,473
the tigre.

841
01:53:43,422 --> 01:53:44,880
Can I ask you something?

842
01:53:46,822 --> 01:53:47,915
Of course.

843
01:53:48,685 --> 01:53:52,091
I told you two stories about
what happened out in the ocean...

844
01:53:52,705 --> 01:53:55,435
Neither explains what cause
the sinking of the ship.

845
01:53:56,205 --> 01:53:59,461
And no one can prove
which story is true and which is not.

846
01:54:00,427 --> 01:54:06,243
In both stories, the ship sinks,
my family dies, and I suffer.

847
01:54:06,973 --> 01:54:07,883
True.

848
01:54:11,233 --> 01:54:12,974
So which story do you prefer?

849
01:54:20,674 --> 01:54:22,435
The one with the tigre.

850
01:54:23,906 --> 01:54:25,413
That's the better story.

851
01:54:29,519 --> 01:54:31,106
Thank you.

852
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,945
And so it goes with God.

853
01:54:46,082 --> 01:54:47,661
Mamaji was right.

854
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:50,969
It's an amazing story.

855
01:54:52,672 --> 01:54:54,549
Will you really let me write it?

856
01:54:54,788 --> 01:54:55,822
Of course.

857
01:54:56,203 --> 01:54:59,160
Isn't that why Mamaji
sent you here, after all?

858
01:55:03,377 --> 01:55:04,849
My wife is here.

859
01:55:05,024 --> 01:55:07,450
Do you want to stay for diner?
She's an incredible cook!

860
01:55:07,589 --> 01:55:08,711
I didn't know you had a wife.

861
01:55:08,783 --> 01:55:10,468
And a cat and and two children.

862
01:55:11,581 --> 01:55:13,615
So your story does have an happy ending.

863
01:55:14,545 --> 01:55:17,039
Well... that's up on you.

864
01:55:17,527 --> 01:55:19,826
The story is yours now.

865
01:55:37,011 --> 01:55:39,775
"Mr. Patel's is an astounding story.

866
01:55:40,276 --> 01:55:44,404
Of courage and endurance,
unparalleled in the history of shippings.

867
01:55:44,597 --> 01:55:48,335
Very few can claim to have
survived so long at sea.

868
01:55:48,974 --> 01:55:51,012
And none in the company...

869
01:55:51,752 --> 01:55:54,694
of an adult Bengal tigre.

870
01:55:57,151 --> 01:55:58,419
– Hi, Dad.
– Get home.

871
01:55:58,604 --> 01:56:00,852
We have a guest, let me introduce you.

872
01:56:02,717 --> 01:56:04,782
Hi.
Very nice to meet you.

873
01:56:04,925 --> 01:56:06,045
Adika.

874
01:56:07,193 --> 01:56:08,223
Ravi.
