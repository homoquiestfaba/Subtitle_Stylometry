00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,432
<i>Is... Is your mom around?</i>

512
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,200
LEO: She's asleep.

513
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,840
It's the middle of the day.

514
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,992
Yeah. She didn't sleep so well last night.

515
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,834
- Well, just tell her I called, okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

516
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,311
<i>- And see you this weekend.</i>
- Thanks.

517
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,432
All right,
we are going to write some letters today.

518
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,672
Now, they have to be honest,
and they have to be interesting, and...

519
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,439
CHARLES:
Who are we supposed to write them to?

520
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,954
Whoever you want.

521
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,236
People who you think
might want to read them.

522
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,710
Well, how long do they have to be?

523
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,751
An hour long, which translates
to at least a paragraph from each of you.

524
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,880
Mr Jenkins, can we be mean
so long as we're being honest?

525
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,033
No. Now, shut up, Charles.

526
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,471
All right, let's get started.

527
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,999
<i>LEO: Dear man in prison,</i>

528
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,878
<i>my name is Leopold Bloom,</i>

529
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,794
<i>and my life began long before I was born.</i>

530
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,114
<i>Mother said I was the seal of her sin,</i>

531
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,994
<i>and my aunt just said I was
a quiet little man who spoke with my eyes.</i>

532
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,556
Take time with your words, Leo.

533
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,349
<i>I live alone with my mother, Mary,
in Oxford, Mississippi.</i>

534
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,796
<i>My father and my sister died
the day I was born.</i>

535
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,351
<i>There's not much else to tell you
about myself, I guess.</i>

536
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:55,549
<i>I don't exactly know who you are,
but I think I know how you must feel.</i>

537
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,031
<i>I don't really have any friends,
and I don't know where to go to find them.</i>

538
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,793
<i>I guess we both feel like we can't get out</i>

539
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,156
<i>or maybe wonder
what it's like on the other side.</i>

540
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,675
<i>In either case,
most people are uncomfortable with me,</i>

541
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,797
<i>but not as much as
because of something I did,</i>

542
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,315
<i>as much of because of how I am.</i>

543
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,711
<i>At least, in your case, you know
what you did that got you locked up.</i>

544
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,077
<i>I guess knowing that we will never meet
makes it easy to write to you.</i>

545
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,072
<i>If you want, you can write me back.</i>

546
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,313
<i>My best wishes for a quick end
to your time there or a good escape.</i>

547
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,350
<i>It was nice talking to you.
Sincerely, Leopold Bloom.</i>

548
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,869
Hi, Mom.

549
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,030
Hey.

550
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,639
Don't you have any friends
you can play with, Leo?

551
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,792
Can't you find some?

552
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,352
You shouldn't smoke, Mom.

553
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,038
We just learnt at school
how bad it is for you.

554
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,193
It's bad for me?

555
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,874
It could kill you if you do it too much.

556
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,112
Why don't you let me decide
what's bad for me?

557
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,840
Did they tell you how bad it is for a woman
to smoke when she's pregnant?

558
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,636
I think I smoked
when I was pregnant with you.

559
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,758
(LEO WHEEZING)

560
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,950
Maybe that's why you can't run
without running out of air.

561

(DOOR OPENING)

562
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,314
Mrs Bloom.

563
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,712
- I'm Mr Jenkins, Leo's teacher.
- Yes, I know that.

564
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,673
- Is there something wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong.

565
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,516
- I just really need to talk to you about Leo.
- What would you like to talk about?

566
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,160
Well, I really would like to enrol him
at Ole Miss,

567
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,072
in some classes this summer.

568
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,234
His level of reading and writing is
beyond any of his other classmates,

569
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,393
and, quite frankly,
our school's curriculum just doesn't...

570
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,756
I told you I don't want him at the university.

571
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,433
- I know.
- I don't feel that it would be better for him.

572
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,513
I know, and I respect that,
but I think it would be.

573
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,000
- I know it wouldn't be.
- How would you know that

574
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,834
before I've even told you
our course of study?

575
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,880
Mrs Bloom.

576
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,077
I can't pretend to understand the level
of suffering and loss, but...

577
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,719
Then don't.

578
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,592
I hate to be rude. I was just in the middle
of something in the kitchen and...

579
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,000
Appreciate you stopping by.

580
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,151
I know, but Leo, he...

581
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,798
<i>LEO: "I take Mary there
to try to calm her and myself.</i>

one of these days.

What? Another one
of your silent treatments?

590
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,991
All right, don't talk to me.

591
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,600
It's okay.

<i>and I don't just mean
that I received it, either.</i>

594
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,277
<i>I mean I understood it.</i>

595
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,037
<i>I'm writing back
because it would have meant something</i>

596
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,477
<i>for someone to write to me
when I was your age.</i>

597
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,434
<i>I thought I'd tell you a few truths
right off the bat.</i>

<i>If people are uncomfortable with you,
then forgive them.</i>

601
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,837
<i>It's probably because they're uncomfortable
with themselves.</i>

602
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,230
<i>And even if you never knew
your father or your sister,</i>

603
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,074
<i>it's okay for you to think of them
and miss them.</i>

604
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,954
<i>Keep writing, kid,
and I don't just mean to me.</i>

<i>Best regards. Stephen.</i>

606
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,233
Do you hate me, Leo?

607
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,512
No, I don't.

608
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,714
You should.

609
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,235
Do you know who I named you after?

610
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,796
No.

611
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,394
A character in a book called <i>Ulysses.</i>

612
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,078
I read it in college.

613
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,269
He reminded me of everything I was,

614
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,510
everything I never wanted to be.

615
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,433
Can I read the book?

616
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,077
Well, you've read every goddamn book
in the house.

617
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,032

I'm just wondering why you never talk to me
when you come over.

621
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,555
Well, what do you want to talk about?

622
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,399
You pick a topic.

623
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,518
Well, we don't have a lot in common,

624
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,829
unless you want to talk about painting.

625
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,038
'Cause I paint pretty much every day,

626
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,075
and I don't think that interests you much,
does it?

627
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,276
Sure.

628
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,797
Let's talk about painting.

00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:24,157
To be honest with you,
not a whole fucking lot.

632

- Next topic.
- What do you like?

633
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,240
I'm tired, Leo. I'm fucking tired.

634
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,399
Do you like my mom?

635
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,514
You got a lot of balls
asking all these questions, Leo.

Yeah.

637
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,515
Well, one should know these things.

638
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,756
So, do you like my mom or not?

639
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,760
Sure I do.

640
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,550
I like her a whole lot.

About five years ago.

642
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,595

he found Jesus.

646
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,400
There's been something on my mind,
something kind of eating on me.

I've been seeing the lights on in your room.

All night, and I mean all night.

650
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,758
And you, you just been
sitting there, writing.

651
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,112
I mean, writing like a preacher
working on a Sunday sermon.

652
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,156
Man, what are you working on?

653
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,720
A book, letters, but mostly letters.

654
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,639
I've been writing letters to a boy
who wrote me when I was in prison.

655
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,915
- A boy?
- Mmm-hmm.

656
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,672
LOUIS: Well, how's that working out for you?

657
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,314
He's like me before I went to prison,

658
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,397
and I want things
to end up differently for him.

659
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,360
So I write stories to him,
and it helps me, too.

660
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,513
'Cause, you know, some days,

661

664
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,478
Did you know that kid
before you went to prison?

665
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,075
No. It started when I was in there.

666
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,552
You ever see the kid?

667
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,870
No.

01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,599
But I'm fixing to.

01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,870
Soon.

- MARY: No. Why did you do that?

851
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,676
MARY: (CRYING) Why did you stop him?

852
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,878
Ever get tired of the name
people call you by?

853
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,910
- What? Gil?
- Mmm-hmm.

854
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,029
No.

855
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,998
Been called Gil my whole life.

856
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,358
Well, I'd like to change mine.

857
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,556
- What to?
- Stephen.

858
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,520
Why Stephen?

859
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,280
Well, there's two men in this one book.

860
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:09,680
Stephen is the young one,
and Leopold is the older one.

861
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,359
One believes, and the other
spends his entire life doubting.

862
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,799
I feel like I've been old my whole life,

863
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,392
and I'm done doubting.

864
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,120
KINGSLEY: Mrs Bloom,

865
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:39,274
will you describe for the court
as precisely as you can, please,

866
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,478
the events that led up to Mr Eames's death?

867
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,760
MARY: Well, we were talking in the kitchen.

868
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,234
I know our voices were raised.

869
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,552
And I think Leo came home
in the middle of it.

870
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,755
And the next thing I knew,

871
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,236
Leo had a skillet over his head.

872
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,473
I couldn't stop it.

873
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,194
Mrs Bloom,

874
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:21,795
is it not true that Ryan Eames was about
to stab you when your son walked in

875
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:25,237
and saved you from what was sure to
be imminent bodily harm?

876
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,471
PROSECUTOR: Objection! Counsel is leading
the witness, Your Honour.

877
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,439
JUDGE: Objection sustained. Counsel,
ask your question, don't answer it yourself.

878
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,751
KINGSLEY: Was Ryan Eames about
to stab you when your son walked in?

879
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,354
He had a knife.

880
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,878
But he had had a knife before. I...

881
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:43,600
I wouldn't have known whether
he would have stabbed me.

882
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,240
KINGSLEY: Was Ryan Eames beating you
that afternoon?

883
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,760
Mrs Bloom?

884
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:54,231
How do you explain the multiple bruises
on your body that day?

885
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:58,639
- I want the court to instruct her to answer.
- Mrs Bloom, answer the question.

886
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,556
I have bruises all over my body.

887
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,711
- Ryan and I drank and things got rough.
- Well, did things get rough that day?

888
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,634
No more than usual.

889
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,394
- I'm sorry?
- No more than usual.

890
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,309
KINGSLEY: How would you describe
your relationship with your son?

891
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,278
PROSECUTOR: Objection, Your Honour.
That's not relevant here.

892
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,080
Oh, please, can I ask about intent?

893
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,120
JUDGE: Overruled. Answer the question.

894
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,872
As complicated as any
between a mother and a son.

895
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:35,158
KINGSLEY: Would you say
that you resented your son

896
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,197
for who you thought his father was?

897
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,637
PROSECUTOR: Objection, he's leading
the witness again, Your Honour. Please.

898
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,235
- JUDGE: Overruled.
- Did you?

899
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,196
No.

900
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,440
No, I didn't.

901
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:53,831
KINGSLEY: And I suppose it wouldn't matter
to know that Ryan Eames wasn't his father.

902
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,752
That's not possible.

903
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:05,719
- Leo has always been like his father.
- KINGSLEY: Yes, I suppose he has.

904
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,800
Because the people that I spoke to
say that Leo's father was a good man.

905
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,311
Blood tests show Ryan Eames to be sterile,
Mrs Bloom,

906
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,040
whether or not you ever cared to know.

907
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,476
I have no further questions for this witness.

908
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,359
JUDGE: Prosecution
have any further questions?

909
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,313
PROSECUTOR:
Nothing further, Your Honour.

910
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,437
JUDGE: The witness is excused.

911
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,549
The court will take a 30-minute recess.

912
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:45,917
- I'm gonna put you on the stand.
- No. No, you're not.

913
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,029
The jury.

914
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,229
Get up.

915
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,876
They don't want to believe her.
We have to have them hear your side of it.

916
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,555
No, I don't think so.

917
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:05,270
Hey, Leo,
it is 15 to 20 years we are talking about.

918
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,195
Why won't you tell them
how it really happened?

919
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,113
I took his life.

920
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,039
She took mine.

921
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,916
There's two reasons for you right there.

922
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,276
Hey! I don't understand that.

923
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,794
Yeah, well,

924
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,192
you don't have to.

925
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,071
What did you just do in there?

926
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,391
Do you realise what you did?

927
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,400
You hung him.

928
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,629
<i>What would it have cost you
to tell them why he did it?</i>

929
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,678
He did it for you.

930
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,755
He was defending you.

931
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:13,233
<i>Look at you.
I don't even know who you are any more.</i>

932
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,272
Could you look at me?

933
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,278
(GAVEL POUNDING)

934
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,675
In the count of first degree murder,

935
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:29,154
we, the jury, find the defendant,
Leopold Bloom,

936
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,516
guilty as charged.

937
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,916
I came to say goodbye.

938
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,155
You already did that on the stand,
didn't you?

939
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,515
I guess it's my turn to say goodbye.

940
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,912
That's why you're here, right?

941
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,953
Was it worth it?

942
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,355
- Was what worth it?
- Killing Ryan.

943
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:59,836
Was being in here worth killing him?

944
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,115
You mean, were you worth it?

945
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,514
I don't know.

946
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,594
I don't know what you ever expected of me.

947
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,036
I expected you to be someone that

948
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,120
I would love.

949
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:25,278
And from the first time I saw you, you were.

950
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,875
You thought it was your fault
they went away.

951
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,474
And mine, too.

952
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:35,438
I always thought
that it had to have been mine.

953
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,474
The way you were born, the day.

954
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:45,157
I never knew that you were Ben's.

955
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:48,758
And now that you do
it's okay that I'm your son?

956
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,960
No.

957
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,079
You killed me.

958
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,239
And I killed him.

959
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:06,237
And now we can be done with all of it.

960
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,953
Leo, no.

961
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:19,315
(CRYING) No, I'm so sorry.

962
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,272
I'm so sorry.

963
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,671
Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Don't...

964
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,636
Don't leave me.

965
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:45,513
<i>STEPHEN: Dear Tom, I have finished at last.</i>

966
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:50,231

Hey, asshole!
Why do you look so surprised?

988
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:52,275
Were you dumb enough to think that
that was it, huh? Yeah!

989
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,919
Horace, come on.
You said you were just gonna scare him.

990
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,832
Shut the fuck up, Jack.

991
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:00,234
What is this? Huh, motherfucker?
You going on a little trip, were you?

992
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,789
Were you going
without saying goodbye to me? Huh?

993
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,400
What have we got here? What are you,
a fucking writer or something?

994
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:10,200
We got us a fucking little
Ernest Hemingway here.

995
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,910
Didn't he die with a goddamn fucking
shotgun in his mouth, pal?

996
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,400
- Horace!
- Huh?

997
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:18,320
- Well, what's going on here?
- Nothing, Vic.

998
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,074
You go and get me my breakfast, huh?
I'll be there in a minute.

999
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,834
Louis is taking care of your breakfast.

1000
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,237
Well, why don't you mind your own
fucking business?

1001
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,392
Go back to your room
and light up one of them hangers,

1002
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,073
or whatever the fuck you do. Now go on!

1003
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:34,790
- This is my fucking business.
- Oh, God!

1004
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,712
My legs, my goddamn knees.

HORACE: God damn you!

1006
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,956
I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch.

1007
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,272
You'd have to be able to get up first
to do that, wouldn't you?

01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,239
Come on, get out of here!
Come on! Come on!

VIC: He ain't gonna kill you now.

1011
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,876
- I never would have let him.
- Well, you're welcome, anyhow.

1012
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:02,193
You'd better get the hell out of here
before he sends Jack out for you,

1013
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,398
or in case someone
up and moves the Mississippi.

1014
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,510
Ah.

1015
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,080
I love this.

1016
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,794
You smell that?

That's why I could never leave the South.

1018
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,999
You better leave, though.

1019
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,437
Go on, get out of here.

1020
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,716
Good luck with that kid, now.

1021
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,310
Thanks.

1022
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,355
I will.

1023
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,232
STEPHEN: Why...
Why are you running so hard?

1024
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,711
Have to get a message to someone.
Have to go.

1025
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:14,751
Well, I'm tired, so why don't you
sit down with me for a minute?

1026
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:18,800
I can't. I gotta... I gotta tell him.

1027
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:20,469
Tell who?

1028
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,596
I just...

1029
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:27,118
- I gotta tell him.
- Tell him what?

1030
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:30,431
Tell him not to hit so hard.

1031
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,190
Why?

1032
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:37,270
Because bad things will happen
and everything will change.

1033
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,795
Sit down. Bad things won't happen.

1034
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,756
Sit down. You're out of breath.

1035
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,995
I'm not supposed to run that hard.

1036
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,355
What will happen
if I don't get the message in time?

1037
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,671
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

1038
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:58,079
See, you don't know this,
but good things will happen up here,

1039
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:03,278
and you'll write about them,
and when people see them, they'll smile

1040
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,636
in a way your mama never could.

1041
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:11,112
- I'm gonna be all right, then?
- Yeah, you'll be all right.

1042
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:21,634
I know you're afraid,
but there's no reason to be, there never was.

1043
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:27,591
You see, at the end of all of it, is this.

1044
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,995
What have you been doing all this time?

1045
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,153
Looking for you,

1046
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:48,674
one way or another.

1047
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,674
It's all I've been doing
since the day I was born.

1048
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,194
Looking for you.

1049
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,717
At least I found you.

1050
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,151
<i>STEPHEN: This is finally my own story.</i>

1051
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,675
<i>Each person has his own, and with that fact,</i>

1052
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,717
<i>I am like everyone else.</i>

1053
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:23,158
<i>STEPHEN AND LEO: Mr Jenkins always
told me to take time with my words,</i>

1054
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:28,315
<i>so I suppose I'll try to do that now,
even though that was in the fifth grade.</i>

1055
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,911
<i>STEPHEN: You see, I used to have
this problem where I saw too much</i>

1056
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,231
<i>but never managed to find my way
to the right words</i>

1057
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,710
<i>that would let me speak aloud on any of it.</i>

1058
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,235
<i>I suppose it was like that
for a reason, though,</i>

1059
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,755
<i>because what my eyes saw
didn't seem to me to be the things</i>

1060
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:43,674
<i>that other people's ears
had any business hearing.</i>

1061
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,834
<i>But I think of all that differently now,
so I will begin my story.</i>

1062
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,794
<i>STEPHEN AND LEO:
My name is Leopold Bloom,</i>

1063
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,475
<i>and my life began long before I was born.</i>

1064
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:58,430
<i>LEO: Mother said I was the seal of her sin
and a sign of the grief she would face.</i>

1065
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,349
<i>My aunt just said I was a quiet
little man who spoke with my eyes.</i>

1066
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,511
<i>I was named after some man in a book</i>

1067
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,160
<i>my mom read when she was in college
called</i> Ulysses.

1068
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:11,632
<i>So, for a while, I thought I was named
after somebody great, a hero even,</i>

1069
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:15,192
<i>STEPHEN AND LEO: but I was actually
named after a lost, tired man.</i>

1070
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,839
<i>STEPHEN: I like the other man
in the book more,</i>

1071
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:20,800
<i>but then, our last name wasn't Daedalus
and things like that can't really be helped,</i>

1072
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,920
<i>just like with the books people like
and the names they give their children.</i>

1073
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,835
<i>I learnt a lot from my mother
on the afternoon she told me about</i> Ulysses.

1074
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:32,994
<i>I learnt what it was
that made dying and killing so easy for her.</i>

1075
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:37,273
<i>I learnt where my name came from,
and I learnt later, to my own surprise,</i>

1076
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,829
<i>that I had been named after a great man.</i>

1077
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,277
<i>He may have been tired,
but he was never really lost,</i>

1078
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,432
<i>at least not for long.</i>

1079
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,910
<i>And neither am I, any more.</i>
