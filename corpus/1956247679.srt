1
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,712
You'll be glad
to be rid of him, I expect.

2
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,472
We'd be more than happy
to keep him here in custody.

3
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,554
Six months are enough.

4
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,352
It's time for him to answer
for his crimes in Europe.

5
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,769
President Picquery.
Mr. Spielman, sir.

6
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,442
Prisoner is secured and ready to travel.

7
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,738
You've thrown
everything at him, I see.

8
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,779
It was necessary.
He's extremely powerful.

9
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,788
We've had to change his guard
three times. He's very persuasive.

10
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,627
So we removed his tongue.

11
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:20,342
Grindelwald!
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

12
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,099
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

13
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,194
The wizarding
community worldwide

14
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,900
owes you a great debt, Madam President.

15
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,073
Do not underestimate him.

16
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,917
Mr. Spielman,
we found his wand hidden away.

17
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,630
Abernathy.

18
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,213
And we found this.

19
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,098
Hiyah!

20
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,518
No more silver tongue. Hmm?

21
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,816
You have joined
a noble cause, my friend.

22
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,713
I know. I know. I know, Antonio.

23
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,383
So needy.

24
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,768
They're ready for you, Newt.

25
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,185
Leta.

26
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,942
What are you doing here?

27
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,147
Theseus thought it would be good
if I became part of the Ministry family.

28
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,653
Did he actually say the words
"Ministry family"?

29
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,111
That sounds like my brother.

30
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,214
Theseus was disappointed
you couldn't come to dinner.

31
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,133
Any of the nights we've asked you.

32
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,222
Well, I've been busy.

33
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,685
He's your brother, Newt.
He likes spending time with you.

34
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,103
And so do I.

35
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,657
Oi, you! Hop in, Pick.

36
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,452
Why do strange creatures
love you so much?

37
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,600
Well, there are no strange creatures.
Only blinkered people.

38
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,115
Only blinkered people.

39
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,043
How long did you get in detention
for saying that to Prendergast?

40
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,631
I think it was a month that time.

41
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,011
And I set off a Dungbomb under his desk
so I could join you. Do you remember?

42
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,725
Um...

43
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,644
No, I actually don't remember that.

44
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,101
Hello.

45
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,442
Theseus. We were just talking
about Newt coming for dinner.

46
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,022
Really? Well...

47
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,855
Look, before we go in there, I...

48
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,996
It's my fifth attempt, Theseus.
I know the form.

49
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,651
This isn't gonna
be like the other times. This is...

50
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,742
Just try and keep an open mind.
Will you?

51
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,782
And maybe a little less...

52
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,158
Like me.

53
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,786
Well, it can't hurt.

54
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,249
Come on, let's go.

55
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,174
<i>Hearing commences.</i>

56
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,184
You want an end to the ban
on you traveling internationally.

57
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,095
Why?

58
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,895
Because I'd like
to travel internationally.

59
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:54,402
Subject uncooperative and evasive
on reasons for last international trip.

60
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,437
It was a field trip, sir.

61
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,573
I was just collecting material
for my book on magical beasts.

62
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,149
You destroyed half of New York.

63
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,180
No, that's actually factually incorrect
on two counts.

64
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,204
Newt.

65
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,250
Mr. Scamander, it's clear
you're frustrated,

66
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,412
and, frankly, so are we.

67
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,046
In the spirit of compromise,
we'd like to make a proposition.

68
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,922
What kind of proposition?

69
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,635
The committee will agree to lift
your travel ban under one condition.

70
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,762
You join the Ministry.

71
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,432
Specifically, your brother's department.

72
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,734
No.

73
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,278
I think that...

74
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,404
Theseus is the Auror.

75
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,281
I think my talents lie elsewhere.

76
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,692
Mr. Scamander,

77
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,283
the wizarding and non-wizarding worlds
have been at peace for over a century.

78
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,915
Grindelwald wants to see
that peace destroyed.

79
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,792
And for certain members
of our community,

80
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,545
his message is very seductive.

81
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,126
Many pure-bloods believe
it is their birthright to rule.

82
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:05,014
Not only our world
but the non-magic world as well.

83
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:12,147
They see Grindelwald as their hero,
and Grindelwald sees this boy

84
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,519
as a means to make this all come true.

85
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,653
I'm sorry. You're talking about Credence
as if he were still here.

86
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,606
He survived, Newt.

87
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,951
He's still alive.

88
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,279
He left New York months ago.

89
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,533
He's somewhere in Europe.
Where exactly, we don't know, but...

90
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,701
You want me to hunt Credence down?

91
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,707
To kill him?

92
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,043
Same old Scamander.

93
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,926
What is he doing here?

94
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,005
I'm taking on the job
that you're too soft to do.

95
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,594
Is that it?

96
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,400
Travel documentation denied.

97
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,446
Newt!

98
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,552
You think I like the idea of Grimmson
any more than you do?

99
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,221
Listen, I don't want to hear how
the ends justify the means, Theseus.

100
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,306
I think you're gonna have to pull
your head out the sand!

101
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,517
Okay, right, here we go.
What a selfish, irresponsible...

102
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:17,162
The time is coming when everyone
is gonna have to pick a side.

103
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,579
Even you.

104
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,089
I don't do sides.

105
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,713
Newt. Newt.

106
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,478
Come here.

107
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,815
They're watching you.

108
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,083
<i>Well, gentlemen...</i>

109
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,749
I assume this means I have the job.

110
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,630
This will be suitable
after a thorough cleanse.

111
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,256
I want you to go to the circus now.

112
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,546
Give my note to Credence.

113
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,304
Begin his journey.

114
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,558
When we've won,
they'll flee cities in the millions.

115
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,477
They've had their time.

116
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,888
We don't say such things out loud.

117
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,768
We want only freedom.

118
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,184
Freedom to be ourselves.

119
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,565
To annihilate non-wizards.

120
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,904
Not all of them. Not all.

121
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,448
We're not merciless.

122
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,991
The beast of burden
will always be necessary.

123
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,765
<i>Ventus.</i>

124
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,100
Dumbledore.

125
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,688
Were the less conspicuous
rooftops full, then?

126
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,818
Hmm.

127
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,658
I do enjoy a view.

128
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,246
<i>Nebulus.</i>

129
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,955
How was it?

130
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,496
They're still convinced
that you sent me to New York.

131
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,338
You told them I didn't?

132
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:13,842
Yes.

133
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,218
Evening.

134
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,635
Even though you did.

135
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,451
You told me where to find that
trafficked Thunderbird, Dumbledore.

136
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,786
You knew that I would take him home,

137
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,580
and you knew I'd have to
take him through a Muggle port.

138
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,472
I've always felt an affinity
with the great magical birds.

139
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,352
There's a story in my family

140
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,235
that a phoenix will come
to any Dumbledore in desperate need.

141
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,021
They say my great-grandfather had one.

142
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,238
And that it took flight when he died,
never to return.

143
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,931
With all due respect, Professor,
I don't believe for a minute

144
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,947
that's why you told me
about the Thunderbird.

145
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,505
Credence is in Paris, Newt.

146
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,049
Trying to trace his real family.

147
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,381
I take it you've heard the rumors
about who he really is.

148
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,558
No.

149
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,235
The pure-bloods think he's the last
of an important French line.

150
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,523
A baby whom everyone thought lost.

151
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,326
Not Leta's brother?

152
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,651
That's what they're whispering.

153
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,280
And pure-blood or not, I know this.

154
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,496
An Obscurus grows in the absence of love

155
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,244
as a dark twin, an only friend.

156
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,256
If Credence has a real brother or sister
out there that can take its place,

157
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,588
he might yet be saved.

158
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,092
Wherever Credence is in Paris,
he's either in danger,

159
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,051
or a danger to others.

160
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,593
We may not know who he is yet,
but he needs to be found.

161
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,143
And I rather hope
you might be the one to find him.

162
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,687
What's that?

163
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,991
An address of a very old
acquaintance of mine.

164
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,446
A safe house in Paris
reinforced with enchantments.

165
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,706
Safe house?
Why would I need a safe house in Paris?

166
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,368
One hopes you won't, but should things
at some point go terribly wrong,

167
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,957
it's good to have a place to go.

168
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,714
You know, for a cup of tea.

169
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,249
No. No, no, no.

170
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,783
Absolutely not.

171
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,413
No, 'cause I'm banned from
international travel, Dumbledore.

172
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,033
If I leave the country,
they will put me in Azkaban,

173
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,389
and they will throw away the key.

174
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,846
- Do you know why I admire you, Newt?
- What?

175
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,096
More, perhaps, than any man I know.

176
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,267
You do not seek power.

177
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,318
Or popularity.

178
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:43,694
You simply ask,
is a thing right in itself?

179
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,494
If it is, you do it no matter the cost.

180
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,434
That's all very well, Dumbledore,
but forgive me for asking.

181
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,165
Why can't you go?

182
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,040
I cannot move against Grindelwald.

183
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,007
It has to be you.

184
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,186
Well, I can't blame you.

185
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,938
In your shoes, I'd probably refuse too.

186
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,475
- What?
- It's late. Good evening, Newt.

187
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,776
Wait, no.

188
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,195
Oh, come on.

189
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,957
Dumbledore.

190
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,279
Bunty!

191
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:47,949
Bunty!

192
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,454
Bunty, the baby Nifflers
are loose again.

193
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,592
Well done.

194
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,281
I'm so sorry, Newt.
They must've picked the lock

195
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,505
- while I was cleaning out the Augureys.
- Not to worry.

196
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,765
Hmm.

197
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,805
I fed nearly everyone.

198
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,302
Pinky's had his nose drops and...

199
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,483
And Elsie?

200
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,170
Elsie's droppings
are nearly normal again.

201
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,194
Wonderful.

202
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,988
You can, um... You can clock off now.

203
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,764
- I told you to leave the kelpie to me.
- That wound needs more ointment.

204
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,388
I don't want you losing fingers over it.

205
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,050
Seriously, you go home now, Bunty.

206
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,636
You must be exhausted.

207
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,512
You know the kelpie's easier with two.

208
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,599
Perhaps you should take off your shirt.

209
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,307
Don't worry.

210
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,313
I'll dry off quick enough.

211
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,986
Someone needed to let off some steam.

212
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,571
Ointment, Bunty.

213
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,910
You bite Bunty again,
and there'll be trouble, mister.

214
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,202
What was that?

215
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,995
I don't know.

216
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,170
But I want you to go home now, Bunty.

217
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,709
- Shall I call the Ministry?
- No.

218
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,627
I want you to go home. Please.

219
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,388
- Just give me the pieces.
- I got it.

220
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,252
Honey, if you could just
give it to me...

221
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,733
He doesn't care.

222
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,811
If you could just give this
to me, sweetheart.

223
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,110
Hey!

224
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,989
Newt! Get over here, you maniac.

225
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,374
We hope you don't mind, Newt.

226
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,543
We let ourselves in.

227
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,165
It's rainin' out there, cats and dogs.

228
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,754
London's cold.

229
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,563
You were supposed
to have been obliviated.

230
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,128
I know.

231
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,759
It didn't work, pal.

232
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,137
I mean, you said it.

233
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,262
The potion only erases bad memories.

234
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,432
I didn't have any.

235
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,762
I mean, uh, don't get me wrong.
I had some weird ones,

236
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,517
and I had some scary ones.

237
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,852
But this angel...

238
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,732
This angel over here,
she filled me in on all the bad parts,

239
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,901
and, uh, here we are, I guess, huh?

240
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,529
This is wonderful.

241
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,449
Wait. Is...

242
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,696
Tina? Tina?

243
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,950
Oh, it's just us, honey.

244
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,661
Me and Jacob.

245
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,249
Oh.

246
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,068
Why don't I
make us some dinner, huh?

247
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,253
Yes!

248
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,346
Hey, honey.

249
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,923
Teen and I aren't talking.

250
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,056
- Why?
- Oh, well, you know...

251
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,791
She found out about
Jacob and I seeing each other,

252
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,558
and she didn't like it,
'cause of the law.

253
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,308
Not allowed to... Oop!

254
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,315
Not allowed to date No-Majs,

255
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,147
not allowed to marry them.
Blah, blah, blah.

256
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,822
Well, she was all in a tizzy anyway
'cause of you.

257
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,699
- Me?
- Yeah, you, Newt.

258
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,580
It was in <i>Spellbound.</i>

259
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,162
Here. I brought it for you.

260
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,216
"Newt Scamander with fiancée
Leta Lestrange,

261
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,586
"brother Theseus and unknown woman."

262
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,339
No. So Theseus is marrying Leta, not me.

263
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,307
Oh!

264
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,806
Oh... Oh, dear.

265
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,270
Well...

266
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,600
See, Teen read that,

267
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,731
and she started dating someone else.

268
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,109
He's an Auror.
His name's Achilles Tolliver.

269
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,615
Tolliver.

270
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Anyway...

271
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,543
We are real excited to be here, Newt.
This is a...

272
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,286
Well, it's a special trip for us.

273
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,714
You see, Jacob and I,

274
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,212
we're getting married.

275
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,964
I'm marrying Jacob.

276
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,766
Ah!

277
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,974
Oh.

278
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,807
<i>You've enchanted him, haven't you?</i>

279
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,110
What?

280
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,689
- I have not.
- Will you stop reading my mind?

281
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,074
<i>Queenie, you've brought him here
against his will.</i>

282
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,532
Oh, that is an outrageous accusation.
Look at him.

283
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,698
He's just happy. He's so happy.

284
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,490
Then you won't mind if I, um...

285
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:34,961
Please don't.

286
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,900
Queenie, you've got nothing
to fear if he wants to get married.

287
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,837
We can just lift the enchantment,
and he can tell us himself.

288
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,764
What do you got there?

289
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,430
What are you gonna do?

290
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,363
What are you gonna do with that,
Mr. Scamander?

291
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:56,943
<i>Surgito.</i>

292
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,995
Congratulations
on your engagement, Jacob.

293
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,372
Wait, what?

294
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,411
Oh, no. You didn't.

295
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,466
Queenie!

296
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,716
One second.

297
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,136
Queenie!

298
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,430
It's very nice to see you.

299
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,785
Where the hell am I right now?

300
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:29,809
Uh, London.

301
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:30,935
Oh!

302
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,060
I always wanted to go here!

303
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,730
Queenie!

304
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,226
Oh, Queenie, honey.

305
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,782
Well, I'm curious
when you were gonna wake me up.

306
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,155
After we had five kids?

307
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,444
Why is it wrong to wanna marry you?

308
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,829
- Okay.
- To wanna have a family?

309
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,458
I just want what everyone else has,
that's all.

310
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,454
Wait, wait.

311
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,543
We've talked about this
like a million times.

312
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,174
If we get married and they find out,

313
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,862
they're gonna
throw you in jail, sweetheart.

314
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,048
I can't have that.

315
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,006
They don't like people like me
marrying people like you.

316
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,472
I ain't a wizard. I'm just me.

317
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,264
They're really progressive here,
and they'll let us get married properly.

318
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,854
Sweetheart, you don't need
to enchant me.

319
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,318
I'm already enchanted.

320
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,279
I love you so much.

321
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,985
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

322
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,948
But I can't have you
risking everything like this, you know?

323
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,204
You're not giving us
a choice, sweetheart.

324
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,291
You're not giving me a choice.

325
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,711
One of us had to be brave,
and you were being a coward.

326
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,920
I was being a coward?

327
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,297
If I'm a coward, you're...

328
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,514
Crazy.

329
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,258
I didn't say it.

330
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,143
- You didn't have to.
- No, I didn't mean it, sweetheart.

331
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,517
Yeah, you did.

332
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,684
- No.
- I'm gonna go see my sister.

333
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,769
Fine. See your sister.

334
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,858
- Fine.
- No, wait! Wait!

335
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,864
No! Queenie!

336
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,493
I didn't mean it.

337
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,622
I didn't say nothin'.

338
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,588
<i>Papyrus Reparo.</i>

339
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,411
Hey, Newt!

340
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,702
Down here, Jacob.
So I'll be with you in a second.

341
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,378
I got my own problems.

342
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,355
Queenie left a postcard.

343
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,274
Tina's in Paris looking for Credence.

344
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,533
Genius.

345
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,694
Queenie's gonna go straight for Tina.

346
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,408
Okay, we're going to France, pal.

347
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,574
- Oh, hold on. I'll get myjacket.
- I've got it.

348
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:43,994
Oh.

349
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,426
Beautiful.

350
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,914
Nagini.

351
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,921
Credence.

352
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,350
I think I know where she is.

353
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,767
We escape tonight.

354
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:31,944
Hey.

355
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,200
I've told you
to stay away from her, boy.

356
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,653
Did I say you could take a break?

357
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,951
Clean out the Kappa.

358
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,743
And you, get ready.

359
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:05,552
Next, in our little show
of freaks and oddities,

360
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:10,391
I present to you a Maledictus.

361
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,695
Once trapped
in the jungles of Indonesia,

362
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,484
she is the carrier of a blood curse.

363
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:21,784
Ohh!

364
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:26,497
Such Underbeings are destined
through the course of their lives

365
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,409
to turn permanently into beasts.

366
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,334
Ohh!

367
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,006
But look at her.

368
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,083
So beautiful. Yes.

369
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,885
So desirable.

370
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,759
But soon, she will be trapped forever
in a very different body.

371
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,272
Every night when she sleeps,
<i>mesdames et messieurs,</i>

372
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,230
she is forced to become...

373
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,368
She is forced to become...

374
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,126
She is forced to become...

375
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:26,008
Over time, she will not be able
to transform back.

376
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,430
She will be forever trapped
in the body of a snake.

377
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,057
Credence!

378
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,983
Pack it up.

379
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,810
Paris is done for us now.

380
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,135
The boy with the Maledictus,
what do you know about him?

381
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,727
He's looking for his mother.

382
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,188
All my freaks think they can go home.

383
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,731
Okay, let's go.

384
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,540
Look, I think you and I
were at the circus

385
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,126
for the same reason, <i>Monsieur...</i>

386
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,636
Kama. Yusuf Kama.

387
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,173
And you think right.

388
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,306
- What do you want with Credence?
- The same as you.

389
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,477
Which is?

390
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,348
To prove who the boy really is.

391
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,312
If the rumors of his identity
are correct,

392
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,986
he and I are, distantly, related.

393
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,741
I am the last male
of my pure-blooded line,

394
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,035
and so,
if the rumors are correct, is he.

395
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,953
Have you read
<i>The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus?</i>

396
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,961
Yeah. But that's poetry, not proof.

397
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,128
Hmm.

398
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,296
If I could show you something better,

399
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,172
more concrete,
something that proves who he is,

400
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,892
would the Ministries of Europe
and America let him live?

401
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,057
They might.

402
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,190
Then come.

403
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,092
So...

404
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,679
Credence Barebone.

405
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:58,060
Nearly destroyed
by the woman who raised him.

406
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,560
Yet now he seeks
the mother who bore him.

407
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,399
He's desperate for family.

408
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,102
He's desperate for love.

409
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,281
He's the key to our victory.

410
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,867
We know where the boy is, don't we?

411
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,747
- Why don't we grab him and leave?
- He must come to me freely,

412
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,578
and he will.

413
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,795
The path has been laid,
and he is following it.

414
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,384
The trail that will lead him to me

415
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:34,889
and the strange and glorious truth
of who he is.

416
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,765
Why is he so important?

417
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:48,395
Who represents the greatest threat
to our cause?

418
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,987
Albus Dumbledore.

419
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,232
If I asked you now

420
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:57,369
to go to the school where he is hiding
and kill him for me,

421
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,279
would you do it for me, Krall?

422
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,043
Credence is the only entity alive

423
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,375
who can kill him.

424
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,928
You really think
he can kill the Great...

425
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,717
Can kill Albus Dumbledore?

426
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,603
I know he can.

427
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:27,191
But will you be with us
when that happens, Krall?

428
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,570
Will you?

429
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,788
Jacob, that man
Tina's been seeing...

430
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,296
Don't worry. She's gonna see you,
and she'll see the four of us together,

431
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,402
it'll be just like New York
all over again. Don't worry about it.

432
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,778
Yes, but he's an Auror,
Queenie said.

433
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,122
Yeah, he's an Auror. So what?
Don't worry about him.

434
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,183
What do you think
I should say to her if I see her?

435
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:06,393
Oh, well, it's best
not to plan these things.

436
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:10,234
You know, you just say
whatever comes to you in the moment.

437
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,282
She has eyes just like a salamander.

438
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,488
Don't say that.

439
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,159
Look,
you just tell her that you missed her.

440
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,746
- Right.
- Right, and then,

441
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,754
you came all the way to Paris
just to find her.

442
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,590
She'll love that. And then,

443
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,712
tell her you're losing sleep at night
for thinking of her and...

444
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,368
Just don't say nothing about
no salamanders, all right?

445
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,392
- Okay.
- Okay.

446
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,309
Hey. Hey, hey.

447
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,305
It's gonna be all right.

448
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,976
We're in this together, pal.

449
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,804
Okay, I'm gonna help you out.
I'm gonna help you find Tina,

450
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,144
find Queenie,

451
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,990
and we'll all be happy again,
just like old times.

452
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,193
Who is this guy?

453
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,452
Oh, he's the only way I can
leave the country without documentation.

454
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,080
Now, you don't suffer from
motion sickness, do you?

455
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,290
I don't do well on boats, Newt.

456
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,167
You'll be fine.

457
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,336
Stir your stumps.
Leaves in one minute.

458
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:13,924
50 Galleons.

459
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,169
No, we said 30.

460
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,251
Uh-huh. 30 to go to France.

461
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,302
20 not to tell anyone

462
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,506
I seen Newt Scamander
leaving the country illegally.

463
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,593
Price of fame, pal.

464
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,936
Mmm. Ten seconds.

465
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,147
- Eight.
- Jacob.

466
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,398
Seven.

467
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:37,737
Six.

468
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:39,658
Mmm...

469
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,901
Four.

470
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,737
Three. Two.

471
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,989
One.

472
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,208
I didn't like
that Portkey, Newt.

473
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,797
So you keep saying.

474
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,587
Follow me.

475
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,354
<i>Confundus.</i>

476
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,325
Come on.
It'll wear off in a few minutes.

477
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,157
<i>Appare Vestigium.</i>

478
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:36,584
<i>Accio</i> Niffler.

479
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,041
Get looking.

480
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,921
Oi! Get looking!

481
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,548
That's a Kappa.

482
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,095
It's a Japanese water demon.

483
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,185
Tina?

484
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:55,942
Tina!

485
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,194
What have you found?

486
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,101
And we're licking the dirt now.

487
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:25,345
<i>Revelio.</i>

488
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,009
Newt, what made those?

489
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,969
That is a Zouwu.

490
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,314
It's a Chinese creature.

491
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,646
They are incredibly fast
and incredibly powerful.

492
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,145
They can travel 1,000 miles in a day,

493
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,009
and this one could take you
from one part of Paris to the next

494
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,069
in a single leap.

495
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,196
Oh, good boy.

496
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,373
Jacob, she was here.

497
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,371
Tina stood here.

498
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,790
She has incredibly narrow feet.
Have you noticed?

499
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,548
Can't say that I have.

500
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,049
Then someone came towards her.

501
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,400
<i>Avensegium.</i>

502
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,690
- Right. Follow that feather.
- What?

503
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,827
- Jacob, follow the feather.
- Follow the feather.

504
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,577
Where is he?

505
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,616
<i>Accio</i> Niffler.

506
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,500
Drop the bucket.

507
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,748
I'm sorry,
I don't know what you just said at all.

508
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,334
Welcome to the French Ministry of Magic.

509
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,127
What is your business, please?

510
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:34,300
I need to
speak to Tina Goldstein.

511
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:39,388
She's an American Auror
working on a case here.

512
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,519
We have no Tina Goldstein here.

513
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,447
No, I'm sorry.
There must be some sort of mistake.

514
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,492
See, I know she's in Paris.
She sent me a postcard.

515
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,261
I brought it.
I can show it to you. Here.

516
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,993
Maybe you can help me find it here.
It's just in here. Oh!

517
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,875
Rabbits! If you can
just wait one moment!

518
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,412
I know it's in here somewhere.
I definitely packed it.

519
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,830
Where is it?

520
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,339
One second.

521
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,171
What did I do with you?

522
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,898
Could we at least
stop for coffee or...

523
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:45,922
Not now, Jacob.

524
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,498
<i>Chocolat chaud</i> or...
Just for a second?

525
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,616
- I don't know.
- This way. Come on.

526
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,974
Pain au chocolat?
Half a croissant and a bonbon?

527
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,305
This way.

528
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,481
Jacob!

529
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:20,582
Jacob?

530
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,888
She's home.

531
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,799
Are you Irma?

532
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,313
Are you Irma Dugard?

533
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:03,236
I'm sorry.
Your name is on my adoption paper.

534
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,533
Does this make sense?

535
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,993
You gave me
to Mrs. Barebone in New York.

536
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,473
I am not your mother.

537
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,107
I was only a servant.

538
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,522
You were so beautiful a baby.

539
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,160
And you are a beautiful man.

540
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,172
I did not want to leave you there.

541
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,633
Why didn't they want me?

542
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,175
Why is your name on my adoption paper?

543
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:11,345
I took you to Mrs. Barebone

544
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,394
because she was supposed
to look after you.

545
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,231
She's dead.

546
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,857
How did the boy take it?

547
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,821
He's sensitive.

548
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,532
The Ministry won't be happy
when I tell them I missed.

549
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,497
I know my reputation.

550
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,505
Listen to me. The disapproval of cowards
is praise to the brave.

551
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:49,753
Your name will be written in glory
when wizards rule the world.

552
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,097
And the clock is ticking faster.

553
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,510
You watch over Credence. Keep him safe.

554
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,351
For the greater good.

555
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,521
For the greater good.

556
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,275
You know what
I miss about Queenie?

557
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,241
Everything.

558
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,908
I even miss the stuff
that drove me nuts.

559
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,907
Like the mind reading.

560
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:30,005
I was lucky to have someone like her
even interested in anything I thought.

561
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:33,846
You know what I mean?

562
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:35,933
Sorry?

563
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:44,437
I was saying, you're sure
the guy is here that we're looking for?

564
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,102
Yeah, definitely. The feather says so.

565
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,828
Is that the guy
we're looking for?

566
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,852
Yes.

567
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,272
Ooh...

568
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,442
Sorry.

569
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,234
<i>Bonjour. Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

570
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,781
Oh, wait, no.
Sorry. So we actually...

571
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,734
We were just wondering
if you'd come across a friend of ours.

572
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,611
Tina Goldstein.

573
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,163
<i>Monsieur,</i> Paris is a large city.

574
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,284
She's an Auror.

575
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:46,752
And when Aurors go missing,
the Ministry tend to come looking, so...

576
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,424
No, I suppose it would probably
be better if we just report her absence.

577
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,293
Is she tall?

578
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,171
Dark? Rather...

579
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,588
- Intense.
- Beautiful. She's...

580
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,095
Yeah, what I meant to say was...

581
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,726
- No, she's very pretty.
- She's intense too.

582
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,769
I think I saw
someone like this last night.

583
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,773
Perhaps if I showed you where...

584
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,466
If you wouldn't mind. That would be...

585
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,981
- That would be lovely.
- Sure.

586
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,646
Tina.

587
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:57,274
Newt.

588
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,528
<i>- Expelliarmus.</i>
- Oh!

589
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,913
My apologies, Mr. Scamander.

590
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,955
I shall return and release you
once Credence is dead.

591
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,128
Kama, wait.

592
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:13,006
You see, either he dies or I do.

593
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,462
No, no, no.

594
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,002
Oh, no. No, no, no.

595
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,723
Well, that's not the best start
to a rescue attempt.

596
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,517
Oh, this was a rescue attempt?

597
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,981
You just lost me my only lead.

598
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,235
Well, how was the interrogation going
before we turned up?

599
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,578
Newt!

600
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,491
Well done, Pick.

601
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,703
So you need this man, you said?

602
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,588
Yeah.

603
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,341
I think he knows
where Credence is, Mr. Scamander.

604
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:03,885
Well, that'll be that Zouwu.

605
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,453
Come on, Newt. Get outta there.

606
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,091
Come on!

607
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,955
What were the three biggest mistakes
that you made last time?

608
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,139
- Caught by surprise, sir.
- Mmm.

609
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,292
What else?

610
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,026
Didn't parry before counter-curse, sir.

611
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,626
Very good. The last one?

612
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,796
The most important one?

613
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,059
Not learning from the first two.

614
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:21,644
This is a school. You've no right.

615
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,687
I'm the Head of Magical Law Enforcement.

616
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,990
I have the right
to go wherever I please.

617
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,530
Out of here.

618
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,871
Go with Professor McGonagall, please.

619
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,713
He's the best teacher we've got.

620
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,446
- Thanks, McClaggan.
- Get out.

621
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,220
Come, McClaggan.

622
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,393
Newt Scamander is in Paris.

623
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:57,856
Really?

624
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,058
Cut the pretense.
I know he's there on your orders.

625
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,188
Oh, if you'd ever had the pleasure
to teach him,

626
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,067
you'd know Newt is not
a great follower of orders.

627
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,617
You've read
<i>The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus?</i>

628
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,195
Mmm. Many years ago.

629
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,701
"A son cruelly banished

630
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,615
"Despair of the daughter

631
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,329
- "Return..."
- Yes, I know it.

632
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,755
There's a rumor this prediction
refers to the Obscurial.

633
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,758
They say that Grindelwald wants...

634
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,794
As a highborn henchman.
I've heard the rumor.

635
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,676
And yet, Scamander appears
wherever the Obscurial goes,

636
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,429
to protect him.

637
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,427
Meanwhile, you've built up

638
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,764
quite the little network
of international contacts.

639
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:43,184
However long you keep me
and my friends under surveillance,

640
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:46,695
you're not going to discover plots
against you, Travers,

641
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,443
because we want the same thing.

642
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,445
The defeat of Grindelwald.

643
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,494
But I warn you, your policies
of suppression and violence

644
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,376
are pushing supporters into his arms.

645
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,161
I'm not interested in your warnings.

646
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,165
Now...

647
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:11,046
It pains me to say it
because I don't like you...

648
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,391
But...

649
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:19,645
You are the only wizard
who is his equal.

650
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,484
I need you to fight him.

651
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,449
I can't.

652
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,075
Because of this?

653
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,212
You and Grindelwald
were as close as brothers.

654
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,844
Oh, we were closer than brothers.

655
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,146
Will you fight him?

656
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,445
I can't.

657
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,107
Well, then you have chosen your side.

658
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,912
From now on,
I shall know every spell you cast.

659
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,077
I'm doubling the watch on you,

660
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,664
and you will no longer teach
Defense Against the Dark Arts.

661
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,583
Where's Leta? We need to go to Paris.

662
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,013
Theseus.

663
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,057
Theseus, if Grindelwald calls a rally,

664
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:40,843
don't try and break it up.

665
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,308
Don't let Travers send you in there.

666
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,432
If you ever trusted me...

667
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:47,690
Theseus.

668
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,820
Theseus!

669
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,196
<i>Even the name Lestrange
makes me feel sick.</i>

670
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,855
You know she stays here every vacation.

671
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,774
Her family don't actually want her home.

672
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,387
I don't blame them.
She's so annoying.

673
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,572
Did you see her last week?

674
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:40,827
<i>Oscausi!</i>

675
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,459
Professor McGonagall!

676
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:48,749
Lestrange has done it again!

677
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,005
Lestrange, stop running!

678
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,008
- Lestrange! Disobedient children.
- Leta, come back!

679
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,339
Stop! Shame on the House of Slytherin.

680
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,762
A hundred points! Two hundred!

681
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,594
Get back here, right now!

682
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:05,432
Children, stop it! You, stop! Come back!

683
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,767
- Out of my way!
- Where has she gone?

684
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,728
I think she went that way!

685
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:15,063
Miss, it was Lestrange. She's horrible.

686
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,741
Scamander,
why aren't you packing?

687
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:28,534
I'm not going home.

688
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,546
Why not?

689
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,171
He needs me.

690
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,337
He was hurt.

691
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,729
What is that?

692
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:50,765
A raven chick.

693
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,852
Isn't the raven your family emblem?

694
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,521
Yes, it is.

695
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,459
<i>All right, Newt.</i>

696
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,411
<i>Be brave.</i>

697
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,375
That's an unusual one.

698
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:22,922
So Mr. Scamander fears what
more than anything else in the world?

699
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,678
Having to work in an office, sir.

700
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,306
Go ahead, Newt.

701
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:32,608
<i>Riddikulus.</i>

702
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,234
Well done.

703
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,694
Good job. Leta.

704
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:40,857
It's only a Boggart.

705
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,991
It can't hurt you.

706
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,451
Everyone is scared of something.

707
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,829
I've been looking forward to this.

708
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,497
I don't want to talk about it.

709
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,479
They know me,

710
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,937
or they'd hide.

711
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,646
They only nest in trees
with wand-quality wood.

712
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,196
Did you know that?

713
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:10,487
And they have very complex social lives.

714
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,167
If you watch them for long enough,
you realize...

715
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:36,017
Hello, Leta. This is a surprise.

716
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:42,227
Finding me in a classroom?

717
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,863
Was I such a bad student?

718
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,677
On the contrary,
you were one of my cleverest.

719
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,613
I said "bad," not "stupid."

720
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,824
Don't bother answering.

721
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,543
I know you never liked me.

722
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,003
You're wrong.

723
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:01,918
I never thought you bad.

724
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,549
You were alone, then.
Everybody else did.

725
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,755
And they were right.

726
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,466
I was wicked.

727
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,098
Leta, I know how painful

728
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,552
the rumors about your brother Corvus
must be for you.

729
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:15,806
No, you don't.

730
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,981
Not unless
you had a brother who died, too.

731
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,234
In my case, it was my sister.

732
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,814
Did you love her?

733
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,199
Not as well as I should have done.

734
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,962
Never too late to free yourself.

735
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:49,838
Confession is a relief, I'm told.
A great weight lifted.

736
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,927
Regret is my constant companion.

737
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,141
Do not let it become yours.

738
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,575
Oh! No, thank you.

739
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,201
Well...

740
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,119
You've been really kind,

741
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:19,454
but my sister Tina's probably
worried sick about me.

742
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:22,620
You know,
banging on all the doors and things,

743
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,414
so I think I'd better be going.

744
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,591
But you haven't met your host.

745
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,509
Oh, are you married?

746
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:31,841
Let's say,

747
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,014
deeply committed.

748
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,270
You see, I can't tell if you're
making a joke or if you're just...

749
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:43,224
French.

750
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,115
Oh.

751
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,740
Hey, knock it off.

752
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,453
You stay right there.

753
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,629
I know what you are.

754
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:08,708
Queenie.

755
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,010
We are not here to hurt you.

756
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,508
We only want to help you.

757
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,184
You're so very, very far away from home.

758
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,772
Far away from everything you love,
everything that is comfortable.

759
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,732
I would never see you harmed.

760
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:30,733
Ever.

761
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:36,285
It is not your fault
that your sister is an Auror.

762
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,414
I wish you were working with me now

763
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:45,710
towards a world where
we wizards were free to live openly.

764
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:49,498
To love freely.

765
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,478
You are an innocent.

766
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,190
So go now.

767
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,689
Leave this place.

768
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:37,986
Hey, uh, Newt, buddy. Uh...

769
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,279
Tina's up here.
She's all by her lonesome,

770
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,911
and, uh, maybe you want to come up
and keep her company?

771
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,664
Uh, I've been looking for food,
and I ain't found any,

772
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:50,244
so I guess I'm gonna go upstairs
and try my luck

773
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:52,788
in, oh, I don't know, the attic.

774
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:55,590
You're all right.

775
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,001
<i>Relashio.</i>

776
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,100
Okay.

777
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,688
She's responded well to the Dittany.

778
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,650
She was born to run, you see.

779
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:24,866
But I think she's...
She's just lacking in confidence.

780
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,060
Mr. Scamander,
have you got anything in your case

781
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:30,246
that might help revive this man?

782
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:31,497
I need to question him.

783
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,187
I think he knows who Credence really is.
And the scars on his hand

784
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:36,215
- suggest an Unbreakable Vow.
- An Unbreakable Vow.

785
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,791
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

786
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:50,647
<i>Lumos.</i>

787
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,237
What was that?

788
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,238
There must be
a Water Dragon in that sewer.

789
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:05,193
They carry these parasites,
you see. They, um...

790
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:07,862
- Jacob.
- Yeah?

791
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:12,542
In my case, in the pocket there,
you'll find a pair of tweezers.

792
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:13,962
Tweezers?

793
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,608
- They're thin, pointy...
- Little pointy things.

794
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,112
Yes, I know what tweezers are.

795
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,606
All right.
You might not want to watch this.

796
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:24,630
I can handle it.

797
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:30,603
Come out.

798
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:33,388
Come on. You're all right.

799
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,482
- Ew.
- Come on. I got you.

800
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,797
Jacob, will you take that for me?

801
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,858
Huh. Ugh!

802
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:44,117
Calamari.

803
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,741
Must kill him.

804
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,246
Who?

805
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,448
Credence?

806
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,595
It may take him
a few hours to recover.

807
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,620
That parasite's poison is quite strong.

808
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,499
I have to go back to the Ministry
with what I've got.

809
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,322
It's nice to see you again,
Mr. Scamander.

810
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,429
Hey. Hey.
Hold on a second, will ya?

811
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,256
Hold on. Hold on.

812
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,433
Wait! Tina.

813
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,561
You didn't mention salamanders, did you?

814
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:19,317
No, I didn't.
She just ran. I don't know...

815
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,024
So you chase after her.

816
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,774
Tina. Please, just listen to me.

817
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:29,448
Mr. Scamander, I need to go talk
to the Ministry.

818
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,488
I know how you feel about Aurors.

819
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,035
I may have been a little strong

820
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,686
in the way that I expressed myself
in that letter.

821
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,874
What was the exact phrase?
"A bunch of careerist hypocrites"?

822
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,441
I'm sorry, but I can't admire people

823
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:42,583
whose answer to everything that
they fear or misunderstand is "kill it."

824
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,171
I'm an Auror and I don't.

825
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:46,385
Yes, I know.
That's because you've gone middle head.

826
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,140
Excuse me?

827
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:52,287
It's an expression derived from
the three heads of the Runespoor.

828
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:53,711
So the middle one is the visionary.

829
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:56,174
Now, every Auror in Europe
wants Credence dead, except you.

830
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,522
You've gone middle head.

831
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,894
Who else uses that expression,
Mr. Scamander?

832
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,862
I think it might just be me.

833
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,293
It's Grindelwald.
He's calling his followers.

834
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:57,533
It's too late.
Grindelwald has come for Credence.

835
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:02,166
- He might already have him.
- It's not too late.

836
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:03,838
We can still get to him first.

837
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:07,383
Where are you going?

838
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,336
The French Ministry of Magic.

839
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,425
That's the last place Credence would go.

840
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,760
There's a box
hidden in the Ministry, Tina.

841
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,518
It's a box that can tell us
who Credence really is.

842
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:18,929
A box? What are you talking about?

843
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,189
Trust me.

844
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,152
You wanna come out,
just for a little while?

845
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,649
You can be free.

846
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:37,457
Credence.

847
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,008
What do you want?

848
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,092
From you?

849
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:50,511
Nothing.

850
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:54,513
For you?

851
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,392
Everything I never had.

852
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,689
But what is it you want, my boy?

853
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,350
I want to know who I am.

854
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:19,873
This is where you will find proof
of your true identity.

855
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:29,337
Come to Père Lachaise tonight,
and you will discover the truth.

856
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:48,685
Father, why did you make me...

857
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:52,407
Wait...

858
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,570
Wait.

859
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,632
I'm afraid we keep no food in the house.

860
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:23,185
Are you a ghost?

861
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,436
No.

862
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:27,474
No. I'm alive.

863
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,478
But I'm an alchemist
and therefore immortal.

864
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,440
You don't look a day over 375.

865
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:40,528
I'm sorry that we didn't knock.

866
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,538
No. No matter.

867
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,950
Albus told me some friends
might be dropping in.

868
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:47,460
Nicolas Flamel.

869
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:50,256
Oh.

870
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:52,422
Jacob Kowalski.

871
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:53,545
Oh!

872
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,215
I'm sorry.

873
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,305
It's all right.

874
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,802
- I didn't...
- Oh... Oh!

875
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:13,228
At last, we see some development.

876
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,814
Yeah. I've seen one of these before.

877
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:18,025
It was at the fair.

878
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:19,888
There was this dame there,
and she had a veil,

879
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:23,201
and I gave her a nickel,
and she told me about my future.

880
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,745
And she missed out
on quite a bit, actually.

881
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,917
Oh. Hey, hey.

882
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,591
Wait a minute, I know him.
That's the kid. That's Credence.

883
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:39,388
Jeez.

884
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:42,556
Hey... Hey!

885
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,352
That's Queenie. There she is. Hi, baby.

886
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,017
Where is this? Is this here?

887
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:51,565
Yes. This is the Lestrange tomb.

888
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:54,227
It lies in the cemetery
of Père Lachaise.

889
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:57,238
I'm coming, baby. Stay right there.

890
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:58,648
Thank you, Mr. Flamel.

891
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:02,364
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

892
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:05,531
Oh, look after Mr. Tentacles for me.
Oh, no.

893
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:06,707
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

894
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,632
Please,
you mustn't go to the cemetery.

895
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:32,899
What's happening?

896
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,708
Exactly what he said
would happen.

897
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:38,230
Grindelwald rallies
at the cemetery tonight,

898
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,734
and there will be death.

899
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:40,989
Then you gotta go.

900
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,784
What? I haven't seen action
in 200 years.

901
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,742
Flamel, you can do this.
We believe in you.

902
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,211
The box is in
the Ancestral Records room, Tina.

903
01:24:58,385 --> 01:24:59,796
So it's three floors down.

904
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:00,922
Is that Polyjuice?

905
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,803
It's just enough to get me inside.

906
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:13,564
- Who...
- It's my brother, Theseus.

907
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,897
He's an Auror and a hugger.

908
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,275
What's happening?

909
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:21,485
Grindelwald's rallying.

910
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:23,415
We don't know where,
but we think it's tonight.

911
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,530
- Be careful.
- Of course.

912
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:32,308
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- Of course. I'm gonna be careful.

913
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,952
Listen, I want you to hear this from me.

914
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,191
They think that Credence boy
might be your missing brother.

915
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:38,751
- My brother is dead.
- I know.

916
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,257
- He died.
- I know.

917
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:43,044
- How many times, Theseus?
- And the records will prove that.

918
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:47,056
- Okay? They can't lie.
- Theseus.

919
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:55,607
I want every person at that rally
arrested. If they resist...

920
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:57,128
Sir, forgive me, but if we go in
too heavy,

921
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,360
- don't we run the risk of adding to...
- Just do it.

922
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,817
I don't suppose you can Disapparate
on Ministry premises in France, can you?

923
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:20,841
Nope.

924
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:23,258
Pity.

925
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,304
- Newt!
- Yes, I know. I know it's...

926
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:31,977
Newt!

927
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,480
Newt!

928
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,226
- Oh!
- That's your brother?

929
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,919
So I think I may have mentioned
in my letters

930
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,087
that we have quite
a complicated relationship.

931
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:40,397
Newt, stop!

932
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,090
- Does he wanna kill you?
- Frequently.

933
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,070
Enough!

934
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:52,572
He needs to control his temper.

935
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:59,996
I think that might have been
the best moment of my life.

936
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:45,718
Queenie.

937
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,007
Queenie, honey.

938
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,603
Don't. Don't move.

939
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:09,857
Yes, this is Leta Lestrange.

940
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,072
And, uh, I'm her...

941
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:17,365
Fiancé.

942
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,338
Thank you.

943
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,140
Tina, about that fiancée business...

944
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,521
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I should have
congratulated you.

945
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,352
- No, that's...
<i>- Lumos.</i>

946
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:46,610
Lestrange.

947
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:54,910
Tina, about Leta...

948
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,037
Yes, I've just said I am happy for you.

949
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:59,574
No, I don't... Please, don't be happy.

950
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:03,377
No. Sorry. I don't...

951
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,251
Obviously, I...

952
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,003
Obviously, I want you to be...

953
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:12,341
And I hear that you are now.
Which is wonderful.

954
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:16,845
Sorry, what I'm trying to say is,
I want you to be happy,

955
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:19,803
but I don't want you to be happy
that I'm happy, because I'm not.

956
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:24,765
Happy.

957
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:26,442
Or engaged.

958
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,358
- What?
- It was a mistake in a stupid magazine.

959
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:32,314
My brother's marrying Leta,
June the 6th.

960
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:34,108
I'm supposed to be best man,

961
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:36,907
which is sort of mildly hilarious.

962
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,122
Does he think you're here
to win her back?

963
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,539
Are you here to win her back?

964
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,045
No, I'm here...

965
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,510
You know, your eyes really are...

966
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:56,680
Are what?

967
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:59,342
I'm not supposed to say.

968
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,625
- I cut a picture of you...
- Newt, I read your book and...

969
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,140
- Wait, did you read...
- Did you?

970
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,071
I cut this, um...

971
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:16,905
It's just a picture of you
from the paper,

972
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:20,242
but it's interesting
'cause your eyes in newsprint...

973
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,743
See, in reality they have
this effect in them, Tina. It's like...

974
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,129
It's like fire in water, in dark water.

975
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:34,669
And I've only ever seen that...

976
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:39,765
I've only ever seen that in...

977
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,391
Salamanders.

978
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:50,903
Come.

979
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:57,743
Lestrange.

980
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:03,952
Whoa!

981
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,590
<i>Circumrota.</i>

982
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:14,734
Hello, Newt.

983
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,483
Hello, Leta.

984
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:25,789
Hi.

985
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,160
Oh, no.

986
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:36,924
What kind of cats are those?

987
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,213
Uh, these aren't cats.

988
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:40,511
They're Matagots.
They're spirit familiars.

989
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:42,379
They guard the Ministry.

990
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:44,079
But they won't hurt you unless you...

991
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:45,557
<i>Stupefy!</i>

992
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:47,806
Unless you attack them.

993
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:49,646
Oops.

994
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:51,639
- Leta.
<i>- Reverte.</i>

995
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:18,884
<i>Accio!</i>

996
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:31,558
<i>Ascendio!</i>

997
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,398
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

998
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:28,031
Okay. Wait. Hold it there, please.

999
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:30,658
Come on.

1000
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,282
Oh!

1001
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:34,537
All right.

1002
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:39,414
Okay, wait.

1003
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:56,059
You, go back.
Move! Out of the way!

1004
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:59,983
If I must kill you as well as Corvus,
I shall.

1005
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:02,196
Stop!

1006
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:07,659
Yusuf.

1007
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:10,778
Is that really you?

1008
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:18,577
My little sister?

1009
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,961
So he's your brother.

1010
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:26,252
Who am I?

1011
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:28,347
I don't know.

1012
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,052
I'm tired of living with no name
and no history.

1013
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,603
Just tell me my story,
then you can end it.

1014
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:38,435
Your story is our story.

1015
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:45,355
- Our story.
- No, Yusuf.

1016
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:04,294
My father was Mustafa Kama.

1017
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:08,377
Pure-blood of Senegalese descent
and most accomplished.

1018
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:11,388
My mother, Laurena,

1019
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:15,593
was equally highbred, a noted beauty.

1020
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,387
<i>They were deeply in love.</i>

1021
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:24,648
<i>They knew a man of great influence
from a famous French pure-blood family.</i>

1022
01:36:26,823 --> 01:36:28,359
<i>He desired her.</i>

1023
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:31,784
<i>Maman. Maman!</i>

1024
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:37,369
<i>Lestrange used the Imperius Curse
to seduce and abduct her.</i>

1025
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:41,293
I tried to prevent it,
but he attacked me.

1026
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:44,959
That was the last time I ever saw her.

1027
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:50,882
<i>She died giving birth to a little girl.</i>

1028
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:53,676
You.

1029
01:36:57,061 --> 01:37:01,146
<i>The news of her death
drove my father insane.</i>

1030
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:03,432
With his dying breath,

1031
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:08,112
my father charged me to seek revenge.

1032
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:12,657
Kill the person Lestrange loves
best in the world.

1033
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,865
I thought at first it'd be easy.

1034
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,697
He had only one close relative.

1035
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,041
You.

1036
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:22,291
But he...

1037
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:23,961
Say it.

1038
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,497
He never loved you.

1039
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,679
<i>He remarried,
and not three months after her death.</i>

1040
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:39,680
<i>He loved her no more
than he had loved you.</i>

1041
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:48,228
<i>But then his son, Corvus,
was born at last.</i>

1042
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:53,069
<i>And that man who had never known love
was filled with it.</i>

1043
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:55,450
<i>All he cared about</i>

1044
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:57,573
was little Corvus.

1045
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:02,791
So this is the truth?

1046
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:06,044
I am Corvus Lestrange?

1047
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:08,046
- Yes. Yes.
- No. No

1048
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:11,630
Realizing that Mustafa Kama's son
had sworn revenge,

1049
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:14,382
your father sought to hide you
where I couldn't find you.

1050
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:19,680
So he confided you to his servant,
who boarded a ship for America.

1051
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:22,890
- He did send Corvus to America, but...
- His servant, Irma Dugard,

1052
01:38:23,523 --> 01:38:24,855
was a half-elf.

1053
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,732
Her magic was weak,

1054
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:28,984
and therefore left no trace
I could follow.

1055
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:34,440
I had only just discovered
how you had escaped

1056
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:36,825
when I received news I never expected.

1057
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:39,991
The ship had gone down at sea.

1058
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:42,239
But you survived, didn't you?

1059
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:46,494
Somehow, someone had pulled you
from the water.

1060
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:50,164
"A son cruelly banished
Despair of the daughter

1061
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:53,049
"Return, great avenger,
With wings from the water."

1062
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,878
There stands the despairing daughter.

1063
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:59,469
You are the winged raven,
returned from the sea,

1064
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:03,601
but I'm the avenger of my family's ruin.

1065
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:07,973
I pity you, Corvus.

1066
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,355
But you must die.

1067
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:14,442
Corvus Lestrange is already dead!
I killed him!

1068
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:21,913
<i>Accio!</i>

1069
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:42,975
My father owned
a very strange family tree.

1070
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,347
It only recorded the men.

1071
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:55,104
The women in my family
were recorded as flowers.

1072
01:39:58,409 --> 01:39:59,570
Beautiful.

1073
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:02,990
Separate.

1074
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,703
<i>My father sent me to America
with Corvus.</i>

1075
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:16,633
<i>Irma was to pose as a grandmother
with two grandchildren.</i>

1076
01:40:22,391 --> 01:40:24,474
<i>Corvus never stopped crying.</i>

1077
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:30,351
Do you have any news?

1078
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:32,141
All hands to station!

1079
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:34,776
Run to station!

1080
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:45,446
<i>I never wanted to hurt him.</i>

1081
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:52,619
<i>I only wanted to be free of him.</i>

1082
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:54,833
<i>Just for a moment.</i>

1083
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:02,341
<i>Just a single moment.</i>

1084
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:09,219
Give him to me.

1085
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:11,889
Everyone, to the lifeboats!

1086
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,770
They want us
to put on life jackets.

1087
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,289
You didn't mean to do it, Leta.

1088
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:19,414
So it wasn't your fault.

1089
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:23,377
Oh, Newt.

1090
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:30,009
You never met a monster
you couldn't love.

1091
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:36,024
Leta...

1092
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:39,021
Do you know who Credence really is?

1093
01:42:40,613 --> 01:42:42,980
Did you know when you swapped them?

1094
01:42:43,074 --> 01:42:44,190
No.

1095
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,345
Queenie?

1096
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:37,167
They're pure-bloods.

1097
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:39,039
They kill the likes of us for sport.

1098
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:42,757
Queenie?

1099
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:44,590
Jacob!

1100
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:46,509
Honey, you're here! Hi!

1101
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:47,965
Hi, hon. Hi.

1102
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:50,468
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1103
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,758
I never should have done it.
I love you so much.

1104
01:43:52,935 --> 01:43:54,847
And you know that I love you, right?

1105
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:57,103
- Yeah.
- Good. Let's get the hell outta here.

1106
01:43:57,273 --> 01:43:59,060
Oh, no, wait a second.

1107
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:04,770
I just thought maybe we could
hear him first.

1108
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,981
Just listen. That's all.

1109
01:44:08,117 --> 01:44:09,358
What are you talking about?

1110
01:44:14,707 --> 01:44:15,868
It's a trap.

1111
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:17,375
Yeah.

1112
01:44:18,878 --> 01:44:20,835
Queenie, the family tree.

1113
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:22,041
It's all been bait.

1114
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:25,757
We have to find a way out of here
right now.

1115
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:28,968
You go find the others.

1116
01:44:29,054 --> 01:44:30,340
What are you gonna do?

1117
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:32,506
I'll think of something.

1118
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:24,232
My brothers, my sisters,

1119
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:26,936
my friends,

1120
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:31,740
the great gift of your applause
is not for me. No.

1121
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:34,985
It is for yourselves.

1122
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:39,535
You came today because of a craving

1123
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:43,247
and a knowledge

1124
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:47,923
that the old ways serve us no longer.

1125
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:54,888
You came today because you crave
something new.

1126
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:58,008
Something different.

1127
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:02,103
It is said

1128
01:46:02,565 --> 01:46:05,933
that I hate <i>les non-Magiques.</i>

1129
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,310
The Muggles.

1130
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:10,319
- Vermin!
- The No-Maj.

1131
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:13,030
The Can't-Spells.

1132
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:16,617
I do not hate them.

1133
01:46:17,538 --> 01:46:18,870
I do not.

1134
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:22,700
For I do not fight out of hatred.

1135
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:28,880
I say the Muggles are not lesser,

1136
01:46:29,884 --> 01:46:31,170
but other.

1137
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:33,468
Not worthless,

1138
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:36,717
but of other value.

1139
01:46:37,933 --> 01:46:42,098
Not disposable,
but of a different disposition.

1140
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:45,347
Magic blooms

1141
01:46:47,443 --> 01:46:50,436
only in rare souls.

1142
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:56,574
It is granted to those
who live for higher things.

1143
01:46:57,578 --> 01:47:00,912
Oh, and what a world we would make
for all of humanity.

1144
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:03,789
We who live for freedom,

1145
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:06,538
for truth,

1146
01:47:09,173 --> 01:47:10,414
and for love.

1147
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:22,509
It isn't illegal to listen to him.

1148
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:25,262
Use minimum force on the crowd.

1149
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:28,640
We mustn't be what he says we are.

1150
01:47:34,573 --> 01:47:39,284
The moment has come
to share my vision of the future

1151
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:44,369
that awaits if we do not rise up

1152
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:51,167
and take our rightful place
in the world.

1153
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:36,879
Not another war.

1154
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:45,892
That is what we are fighting.

1155
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:48,595
That is the enemy.

1156
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:51,807
Their arrogance.

1157
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:55,025
Their power lust.

1158
01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,692
Their barbarity.

1159
01:49:00,576 --> 01:49:04,365
How long will it take
before they turn their weapons on us?

1160
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:09,032
Do nothing when I speak of this.

1161
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:11,917
You must remain calm

1162
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,001
and contain your emotions.

1163
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,504
There are Aurors here among us.

1164
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:35,559
Come closer, brother wizards. Join us.

1165
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:38,482
Do nothing.

1166
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:41,026
And no force.

1167
01:49:56,757 --> 01:49:59,875
They have killed
many of my followers.

1168
01:50:00,677 --> 01:50:01,838
It is true.

1169
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:07,307
They confined me
and tortured me in New York.

1170
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:12,721
They had struck down
their fellow witches and wizards.

1171
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:18,773
For the simple crime
of seeking the truth.

1172
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:22,318
For wanting freedom.

1173
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:30,576
Your anger, your desire for revenge
is natural.

1174
01:50:34,503 --> 01:50:35,503
No!

1175
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:10,119
Take this young warrior
back to her family.

1176
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:19,458
Disapparate.

1177
01:51:20,132 --> 01:51:21,248
Leave.

1178
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:25,294
Go forth from this place
and spread the word.

1179
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:29,847
It is not we who are violent.

1180
01:51:47,993 --> 01:51:49,200
Let's take him.

1181
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:22,104
Aurors, join me in this circle.

1182
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:25,357
Pledge to me

1183
01:52:26,615 --> 01:52:28,151
your eternal allegiance,

1184
01:52:29,076 --> 01:52:30,157
or die.

1185
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,693
Only here shall you know freedom.

1186
01:52:33,288 --> 01:52:35,826
Only here shall you know yourself.

1187
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:41,744
Move! Run! Run!

1188
01:52:42,965 --> 01:52:45,048
Play by the rules!

1189
01:52:45,217 --> 01:52:47,834
No cheating, children.

1190
01:52:52,641 --> 01:52:54,223
He knows who I am.

1191
01:52:54,393 --> 01:52:57,761
He knows what you were born,
not who you are!

1192
01:52:57,854 --> 01:52:58,935
Credence!

1193
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:16,659
Queenie, honey. Queenie.
You gotta wake up.

1194
01:53:18,417 --> 01:53:19,498
Jacob.

1195
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:21,576
He's the answer.

1196
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:22,998
He wants what we want.

1197
01:53:23,171 --> 01:53:24,537
- No.
- Yeah.

1198
01:53:34,516 --> 01:53:37,475
This has all been for you, Credence.

1199
01:53:40,439 --> 01:53:41,850
Walk with me.

1200
01:53:43,567 --> 01:53:45,274
Hon. No!

1201
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:46,980
Walk with me!

1202
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:50,400
You're crazy.

1203
01:53:52,826 --> 01:53:53,826
Queenie.

1204
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:55,453
No!

1205
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:57,236
Queenie, don't do it!

1206
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:06,255
Queenie.

1207
01:54:08,925 --> 01:54:09,925
Queenie!

1208
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:29,143
Mr. Scamander.

1209
01:54:29,237 --> 01:54:33,402
Do you think Dumbledore
will mourn for you?

1210
01:54:43,668 --> 01:54:45,830
Grindelwald! Stop!

1211
01:54:53,387 --> 01:54:54,387
Leta...

1212
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:07,435
This one I believe I know.

1213
01:55:08,402 --> 01:55:10,143
Leta Lestrange.

1214
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:16,783
Despised entirely amongst wizards,
unloved, mistreated,

1215
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:22,455
yet brave, so very brave.

1216
01:55:27,587 --> 01:55:29,203
Time to come home.

1217
01:55:47,357 --> 01:55:48,598
I love you.

1218
01:55:57,868 --> 01:55:58,949
Go!

1219
01:55:59,953 --> 01:56:00,953
Go!

1220
01:56:24,769 --> 01:56:26,431
I hate Paris.

1221
01:57:06,311 --> 01:57:07,392
Together, in a circle.

1222
01:57:07,562 --> 01:57:08,973
Your wand into the earth.

1223
01:57:10,148 --> 01:57:12,356
Or all Paris will be destroyed.

1224
01:57:19,324 --> 01:57:20,815
<i>Finite!</i>

1225
01:57:22,702 --> 01:57:23,702
<i>Finite!</i>

1226
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:25,162
<i>Finite!</i>

1227
01:57:26,581 --> 01:57:27,581
<i>Finite!</i>

1228
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:39,169
I've chosen my side.

1229
01:59:57,482 --> 01:59:58,723
Oh.

1230
02:00:00,402 --> 02:00:01,768
Come here.

1231
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:04,770
I've got you. I've got you.

1232
02:00:49,659 --> 02:00:52,072
I think it's best
if he speaks to him alone.

1233
02:01:26,237 --> 02:01:28,103
Is he frightened of me still?

1234
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:31,278
You need to be careful.

1235
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:34,493
He's not sure he made the right choice.

1236
02:01:35,914 --> 02:01:38,907
<i>Be very gentle with him.</i>

1237
02:01:44,422 --> 02:01:46,414
I have a gift for you, my boy.

1238
02:01:58,853 --> 02:02:00,264
<i>Is it true?</i>

1239
02:02:01,231 --> 02:02:02,438
About Leta?

1240
02:02:03,983 --> 02:02:04,983
Yes.

1241
02:02:07,737 --> 02:02:09,319
I'm so sorry.

1242
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:18,157
It's a blood pact, isn't it?

1243
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:23,208
You swore not to fight each other.

1244
02:02:30,593 --> 02:02:33,882
How in the name of Merlin
did you manage to get...

1245
02:02:37,433 --> 02:02:39,265
Grindelwald doesn't seem to understand

1246
02:02:39,352 --> 02:02:41,844
the nature of the things
he considers simple.

1247
02:02:57,954 --> 02:02:59,286
Can you destroy it?

1248
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:00,696
Maybe.

1249
02:03:02,834 --> 02:03:04,075
Maybe.

1250
02:03:10,258 --> 02:03:12,124
Would he like a cup of tea?

1251
02:03:13,136 --> 02:03:14,547
He'll have some milk.

1252
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:18,714
Hide the teaspoons.

1253
02:03:24,647 --> 02:03:29,517
<i>You have suffered
the most heinous of betrayals,</i>

1254
02:03:30,737 --> 02:03:34,651
most purposely bestowed upon you
by your own blood.

1255
02:03:34,741 --> 02:03:36,949
Your own flesh and blood.

1256
02:03:37,785 --> 02:03:40,698
And just as
he has celebrated your torment,

1257
02:03:42,957 --> 02:03:46,792
your brother seeks to destroy you.

1258
02:04:07,774 --> 02:04:11,393
There is a legend in your family
that a phoenix will come to any member

1259
02:04:11,611 --> 02:04:13,318
who is in dire need.

1260
02:04:20,912 --> 02:04:23,199
It is your birthright, my boy.

1261
02:04:27,502 --> 02:04:28,663
As is

1262
02:04:30,296 --> 02:04:32,709
the name I now restore to you.

1263
02:04:35,468 --> 02:04:36,879
Aurelius.

1264
02:04:38,346 --> 02:04:41,134
Aurelius Dumbledore.

1265
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:47,686
We will go down in history together
as we remake this world.

1266
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:43,890
