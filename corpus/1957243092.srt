WOMAN 2:
Excuse me.

63
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:57,674
In this country, we don't drink

65
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:04,314
Uh, mm, mm.

00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:07,385
Okay, um, she says she's
actually sacrificing this one,

67
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,020
so it doesn't matter.

68
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,655

to the daughters

00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,397

77
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,033

81
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:25,703

Uh.

85
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:29,472
- Ew, George.
- Hey.

86
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:30,841
Why are you wearing
this sweatshirt?

87
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:32,475
Ashton gave it to me.

88
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:33,843
We're writing little messages
on the diapers,

89
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:34,512
so the baby feels supported...

90
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:35,178
Ah!

91
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:36,313
When it shits or something.

92
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:40,084
I wrote the littlest feet
leave the biggest footprints

93
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,451
in our hearts.

94
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:42,753
- WOMAN 3: Oh.
- Oh, wow.

95
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:43,653

WOMAN 4:
Thank you.

97
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:45,389
I found it online.

98
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,527
Wait, who's Jeff Lanskey?

99
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,530
(Chuckling)

100
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:53,830
That's amazing.

101
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:55,399
It's just um,
just an inside joke

102
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:57,334
from middle school.

103
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:58,735
(Laughter in background)

104
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,872
Oh, he was this um,
kid who was obsessed

105
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:04,008
with Captain Underpants
in seventh grade

106
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,876
and he wore a diaper
over his pants,

107
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:07,377
but then the teachers
made him stop,

108
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:08,746
because he was
getting made fun of,

109
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:10,747
but it was still
like really clear

110
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:13,450
he was wearing a diaper
under his pants.

111
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,419
And Noor used to call him
"petty officer underpants",

112
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:16,620
because he wasn't
high-ranking enough.

113
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:17,054
(George chuckling)

114
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:17,954
That is true.

115
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:18,656
(Chuckling)

116
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:19,789
WOMAN 3:
Wow, that's amazin.

117
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:21,859
Now it's like I'm in the joke.

118
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:23,127
(Women chuckling)

119
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,628
And I got suspended for that,

120
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:27,397
but Milo hooked up
with our chem teacher

121
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,133
the night after
high school graduation

122
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,633
and that was all good.

123
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,104
Yeah, girl,
Mr. Rashkoff was fine as hell.

124
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,872
Oh.

125
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:36,140
He was such a hot commodity,
he had to hook up with her.

126
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:36,806
- GEORGE: Ooh.
- Oh.

127
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,775

128
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:41,544
Well, okay uh,
tell us how you really feel.

129
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:43,681
NOOR:
Not you, I just...

130
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:47,585
I mean like there's a reason
why certain men

131
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:50,153
can't get people over the age
of 18 to fuck them, right?

132
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:50,855
(Woman chuckling)

133
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,556
NOOR:

134
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:54,091
Okay,

00:03:57,427 --> 00:03:58,628
- Seriously?
- MILO: Yes.

139
00:03:58,662 --> 00:03:59,697
I was just kidding.

140
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:00,430
No, I know.

141
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:01,865
I'm just tired I wanna go home.

142
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:02,967
You know what you need?

143
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,068

Sorry?

145
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:06,971

that can actually give you
like so much energy.

148
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:14,010
My college roommate,
her brother committed suicide.

149
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:15,780
I know, so sad.

150
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:18,481
And I swear to God,
it stopped her

151
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:20,750
from getting
like depressed or whatever.

152
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:21,752
It's great for her skin.

153
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:24,154
(George laughing)

154
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:25,656

155
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:26,490

157
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:30,527
That sucked.

158
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,128
Are we assholes
for leaving early?

159
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:34,731
I was getting pretty tapped out
of pin the fetus on the uterus.

160
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:36,132
MILO:
I know.

161
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:39,036
I always feel so aggressively
like single and young

162
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:40,137
when I'm with Noor's
college friends.

163
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,107
I'm not like single and young
you know, like ugh,

164
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,574
oldest cousin sitting at
the kids' table

165
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:46,644
of Thanksgiving single
and young.

166
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,679
Milo, I have full confidence
you'll find some man

167
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:50,613
to intellectually intimidate
and emotionally torture

168
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:52,983
until you can buy a brownstone,
get divorced,

169
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:54,585
and live happily ever after.

170
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:57,487
Ooh, is that truly
so much to ask of me?

171
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,556
Um, sorry.

172
00:04:58,588 --> 00:04:59,689
Could you uh, watch my stuff?

173
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:00,925
I have to make a phone call.

174
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,893

175
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:03,693
Shit, fuck.

00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:05,028
MILO:

177
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:06,497

179
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:10,733
It's like 11:00, dude.

180
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,101
Yeah, I mean
I don't think he's tryin'

181
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:13,937
to catch
the New York Philharmonic.

182
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:15,840
Are you gonna go meet him?

183
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:17,173
No, I mean I don't...
I don't have to.

184
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:19,175
♪ Do you see my eyes,
can you feel my heat ♪

185
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,110
Go.

186
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:21,711
It's fine.

187
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:23,047
GEORGE:
Really?

188
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,247
Yeah.

189
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:24,814
I mean I've
already lost one best friend

190
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:25,516
to her parasitic wife.

191
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,084
What's another to anonymous sex?

192
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:30,888
Oh my God, George,
do you mean like right now?

193
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,557
Sorry, he's just
right around the corner.

194
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,026
- I can wait, though.
- No, it's fine.

195
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:36,994
Honestly,
I'm just gonna head home

196
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:38,562
if this guy ever comes back
for his stuff.

197
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:40,097
(Gasps)

198
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:41,531
Oh my God, what if this is
like one of those subway ads?

199
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:42,565
(Gasps)

200
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:44,502
(Together)
Si ves algo, di algo.

201
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:46,936
(Kissing)

202
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,973
- I love you.
- Love you, have fun!

203
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:50,807
Be safe, huh.

204
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:54,879
(Grunting)

205
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:56,213
Interesting.

206
00:05:58,749 --> 00:05:59,216
No.

207
00:05:59,249 --> 00:05:59,984
No, no, no, no.

208
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:00,451
(Chuckles)

209
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:01,751
Totally my fault.

210
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:03,654
Yeah, I just uh...

211
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,288
No, I just...
I'll know for next time.

212
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:05,756
(Man chuckles)

213
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:06,990
MAN 1:
Yeah.

214
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:09,994
So what if we uh, uh, Andy?

215
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:12,562
Hello?

216
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:14,899
Some um,
masked vigilantes came in

217
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:15,800
and tried to steal your stuff,

218
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,234
but I beat them off
with the pool cue,

219
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,134
so you're welcome.

220
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:18,569
What?

221
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:19,269
♪ Have me ♪

222
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:19,769
Oh.

223
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:21,538
Uh, uh, thank you.

224
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:23,875
♪ And if you want it,
you can have me ♪

225
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:29,313
Oh, sorry.

226
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,680
You're young.

227
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:31,814
Can I ask you something?

228
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:33,016
Yeah, sure, go for it.

229
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,052
So uh, my bar manager

230
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:36,986
downloaded this dating app
for me.

231
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,622
Oh no, friends don't let friends
swipe right for them.

232
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:41,057
Right,
just when I swore I'd die alone.

233
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,692
(Chuckling)

234
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,060
Anyway, I thought it was
really clicking with this guy

235
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,963
and we're supposed
to have our first date tonight,

236
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:47,697
he just totally blew me off.

237
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,132
Huh, can I see your messages?

238
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:56,139
Okay, okay, okay, flirty good.

239
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:57,975
Yeah, no, he never confirmed.

240
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:00,877
- He totally did.
- Mm-mm, where?

241
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,913
"Can I take you out to dinner?"
I said.

242
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:03,581
He said, "I don't know.

243
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:04,048
Can you?"

244
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,682
I said, "Ha-ha.

245
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,850
How about drinks
and a late movie?"

246
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,586
He says, "I've seen a lot
of what's out there right now,

247
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,887
but maybe drinks."

248
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,956
And I go, "Okay,
let's start at Phoenix,

249
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,790
10:00 p.m., Thursday

250
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,093
and see where the night
takes us."

251
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:17,995
Yeah, and he responded?

252
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,231
Oh.

253
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:24,233
I'm... come on, that's so rude!

254
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,269
(Chuckling)

255
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:26,770
He's a grown adult
on a dating app.

256
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:28,805
He can't have the decency
to at least lie to me?

257
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:31,842
Oh, fine.

258
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,776
I'll just be single
till I'm dead.

259
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,713
What about after you're dead?

260
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:37,380
Freddie Mercury
is waiting for me in heaven.

261
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,817
(Chuckles)

262
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,352
Okay,
I have a confession for you

263
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:44,288
and it is that I am
like really bad at sports,

264
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:47,791
but kind of one of those people
who's like weirdly a savant

265
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:49,093
the first time
they play a sport.

266
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:50,727
Like I bowled at 250

267
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,229
the first time I went bowling
in the seventh grade

268
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:54,031
and then that never
happened again.

269
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,369
So this isn't the first time
you play darts.

270
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,068
(Chuckling)

271
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:00,770
Exactly.

272
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:02,872
MAN 1:
So why are you here instead of

273
00:08:02,906 --> 00:08:05,776
at your friend's baby shower?

274
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:10,347
So the last time I hung out
with her sorority friends,

275
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:11,882
I like convinced one of them

276
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:14,184
that if you don't eat gluten
when you're pregnant,

277
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:15,853
then your baby definitely
won't come out gay,

278
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,888
and I actually sat there,
and watched her grapple

279
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,389
with the moral implications
of that for like three hours.

280
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:20,124
(Chuckling)

281
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:21,959
MILO:
I just feel like, "Ugh."

282
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:23,293
When I spend too much time
with them,

283
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:24,927
I end up like feeling

284
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:26,864
like maybe I'm the one
who's missing out on something

285
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:28,766
and then that just
makes me feel even crazier.

286
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:34,103
I... they all just seem
like very content, you know?

287
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:36,139
MAN 1: I've read some
crazy percentage of people

288
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:37,841
who haven't had
a serious relationship

289
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:40,377
by the time they're 30,
never have one.

290
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,010
Wow.

291
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:41,510
Thank you.

292
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:42,879
Thank you so much.

293
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:44,748
I feel like my eggs
just like dunkirked

294
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,381
right up into my body.

295
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:46,716
(Man chuckling)

296
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,052
MAN 1:
When I was in my 20s,

297
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:49,853
I at least asked people

298
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:51,387
what side of the bed
they prefer to sleep on,

299
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:51,988
but now?

300
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:52,956
There is no fuckin' way

301
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:54,758
I'm sleepin'
on the right side of the bed.

302
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:55,559
Well, there goes the whole

303
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,427
left-side-of-the-bed
contingency.

304
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,128
(Chuckling)

305
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,030
So what do you do do
when you're not very busy

306
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:02,765
being stood up by flaky men?

307
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:04,400
Ever been to Thigh High?

308
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:05,468
MILO:
Yes, the gay bar?

309
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,703
That's my bar.

310
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:07,904
No way.

311
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:09,872
Yeah, and I actually perform
in our show

312
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:11,174
every other Thursday night.

313
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:13,276
Okay, my roommate George
got kicked out of that bar

314
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:14,711
when we were freshman
in college.

315
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,480
Send him
my personal condolences.

316
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,148
He ordered whatever whiskey
you had on draft

317
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:19,014
and then he stole

318
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:19,882
your cardboard cutout
of George Takei,

319
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,319
so I don't think
he holds it against you.

320
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:23,920
MAN 1:
I wondered where that went.

321
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:25,155
Oh, well, he's very well
taking care of it, don't worry.

322
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:27,924
(Striking match)

323
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:30,894
(Vehicles honking in distance)

324
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:32,162
So what about you?

325
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:33,764
You single?

326
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:36,399
Uh, are you asking for yourself
or for a friend?

327
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:38,802
(Chuckling)

328
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:40,237
Yeah, almost always.

329
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,072
I'm really looking forward
to being an eccentric aunt.

330
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:42,505
What about you?

331
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:44,073
Any um...

332
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:45,274
(Chuckling)

333
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:46,943
Ex-husbands
or like illegitimate children

334
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:47,910
floating around out there?

335
00:09:47,943 --> 00:09:49,913
No.

336
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:52,115
Single gay man, early 50s,

337
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,083
it doesn't paint a particularly
competitive picture

338
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:56,252
at adoption agencies.

339
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:58,821
I feel like um,
I actually read this article

340
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:00,990
about adoption agencies
that cater specifically

341
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:01,991
to gay men.

342
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:03,126
Yeah.

343
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:07,898
I've lost three kids.

344
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:11,402
Two adoptions fell through
and one surrogacy didn't take.

345
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:15,404
I'm really sorry.

346
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:18,307
That... it sucks.

347
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:19,009
Pfft.

348
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,076
Sorry to get so heavy on you.

349
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,278
No, it's okay.

350
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,812
Honestly, in my opinion,
it is like...

351
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:23,880
It is like not a New York moment

352
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:24,981
unless you talk
about your fetish

353
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:25,414
or your dead parents.

354
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:27,016
(Chuckling)

355
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:32,889
You're done trying?

356
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,892
I don't know.

357
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:37,059
I don't think I can
go through it again emotionally.

358
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:38,161
Hmm.

359
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:40,063
It makes it easier to just think

360
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:41,899

you know?

712

it's really unfair

713
00:23:27,696 --> 00:23:29,631
that there are so many
shitty parents in the world,

714

717
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:42,711
is the universe's way
of telling me "no".

718
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:45,280
I feel like you can force
any random fucking moment or...

719
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:48,284
Or interaction into any hole
and say that it fits.

720
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:49,719
Like it didn't work out
the first three times,

721
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:51,153
the universe is saying "no",

722
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:52,955
you need some random chick
in a bar who wants to help,

723
00:23:52,989 --> 00:23:54,891
the universe is saying "yes".

724
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:56,725
The universe is just a bunch
of random bullshit

725
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,193
floating around in the ether,

726
00:23:58,227 --> 00:24:00,063
and we're all just picking
and choosing which pieces of it

727
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:01,698
to give meaning to.

728
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,666
Has that been embroidered
on a throw pillow yet?

729
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:11,307
Roger, I... I really feel
like uh, I can do something

730
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:12,641
that is bigger than myself.

731
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:16,646
Okay.

732
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,314
This is really truly
an amazing offer

733
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:20,650
you've been making
and a part of me,

734
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:23,685
a big part of me,
wants to say "yes" right now

735
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:26,956
before the... the sun comes up
and you change your mind,

736
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:31,394
but this is
not a tequila drag decision.

737
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:33,395
I need...

738
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:34,864
Can we think about it?

739
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:41,303
Ow, fuck!

740
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:45,307
You can take
all the time you need, okay,

741
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,142
but I... I am not backing out.

742
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:56,086
(♪♪♪)

743
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,264
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

744
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:09,999
Hey.

745
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:11,400
Hey, hold this for me a second.

746
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:12,434
Hmm.

747
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:14,370
What does she have up her
sleeve?

748
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:15,037
(Grunting)

749
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,039
Oh my God, you are amazing.

750
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:17,974
You are literally God's gift.

751
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:18,641
Hmm.

752
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:19,675
When did you even get this?

753
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:22,111
Oh, the second,
I heard we were spending the day

754
00:25:22,144 --> 00:25:23,445
at a fuckin' pumpkin patch.

755
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,980
God bless you.

756
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:26,682
- Okay, salud, my baby.
- Yeah.

757
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:28,417
Wait, wait, wait,
I want a pic.

758
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:30,987
Alright, say is a...
is a gourd technically a fruit?

759
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:32,254
No,
I think it's a root vegetable.

760
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:33,389
- WOMAN 3: Ooh. Ooh, Milo.
- Mm.

761
00:25:33,422 --> 00:25:34,089
- WOMAN 3: Oh, really?
- Mm.

762
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:34,990
- WOMAN 3: Milo.
- Oh, fuck.

763
00:25:35,023 --> 00:25:38,226
Will you get...
will you get one of us?

764
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:38,961
Uh, yeah, sure.

765
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:40,829
I don't know like... are you in?

766
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:41,764
- Yes, yeah.
- Alright.

767
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:42,964
Okay, here we go.

768
00:25:42,998 --> 00:25:43,966
- What are you doing?
- WOMAN 3: I'm smilin'.

769
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:45,434
- WOMAN 3: What are you doing?
- Hey, got it.

770
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:46,035
Is it cute?

771
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:47,836
Yeah, it's... it's good.

772
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:49,971
Oh, Milo, will you, um,
you actually get another one

773
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:51,474
with like a belly
pumpkin photo...

774
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:52,808
for my parents, you know?

775
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,144
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

776
00:25:56,112 --> 00:25:58,848
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

777
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:01,050
We'll, uh, probably get the idea
with literally any pumpkin?

778
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:01,750
WOMAN 3:
Oh, here.

779
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:03,086
Okay, um...

780
00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:05,120
(Vehicles whooshing in distance)

781
00:26:05,153 --> 00:26:05,988
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

782
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,022
Sorry.

783
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:07,757
- MILO: You got it?
- WOMAN 3: Sorry.

784
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:08,423
- Yapa!
- MILO: Alright, good.

785
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:09,292
- Yes, okay.
- MILO: Yay.

786
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:10,226
(Chuckling)

787
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:11,728
MILO:
Okay, good.

788
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,162
Let me get it this way.

789
00:26:13,194 --> 00:26:14,062
Great.

790
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:15,198
Is it cute?

791
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,664
MILO:
It's so...

792
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:16,432
(Camera clicking)

793
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:17,165
Cute.

794
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,366
- Oh, okay.
- Oh.

795
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,134
Look at this!

796
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,335
It's like matching.

797
00:26:20,368 --> 00:26:21,369
Aw!

798
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:24,339
(Crow cawing in distance)

799
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,009
This is how literally
every horror movie starts.

800
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,846
Oh my God, Noor,
stop being such a baby.

801
00:26:29,878 --> 00:26:32,180
I am brown, gay, and pregnant.

802
00:26:32,213 --> 00:26:33,750
Who do you think is dying first
in this movie?

803
00:26:33,782 --> 00:26:34,650
(Scoffs)

804
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:36,918
Okay, we'll go left,
you guys go right,

805
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:38,520
and we'll race to the middle.

806
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:41,891
We can't all just like walk
through a corn maze together?

807
00:26:41,923 --> 00:26:44,326
Where is the unnecessary
competition in that?

808
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,027
Come on,
it'll be like the Amazing Race,

809
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,929
they're the token gays
and we're the closeted Mormons

810
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:48,998
who aren't tryin'
to push their lives

811
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,031
on anybody else.

812
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:50,866
Ready, set, go.

813
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:52,769
We're tokens.

814
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:53,936
Let's go fast, I wanna win.

815
00:26:54,703 --> 00:26:57,405
MILO: When we start our
year at village in Maine,

816
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,841
I was thinking...

817
00:26:58,874 --> 00:26:59,842
GEORGE:
Can Teddy come?

818
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:00,409
Teddy?

819
00:27:00,442 --> 00:27:02,044
Tinder Teddy.

820
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:03,145
Oh, wow.

821
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:03,813
Well,
I didn't realize Tinder Teddy

822
00:27:03,846 --> 00:27:06,048
was a farm in Maine serious.

823
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,317
Um, George, I have something
really important to tell you,

824
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:10,887
but you have
to keep it a secret, okay?

825
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,489
Oh my God, who knew a corny maze
could get more exciting?

826
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:14,923
(Chuckling)

827
00:27:14,957 --> 00:27:16,025
Alright.

828
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:23,098
Um, I'm thinking
of becoming a surrogate.

829
00:27:23,132 --> 00:27:25,535
A surrogate what?

830
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:27,403
Like... like mother.

831
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:27,836
(Chuckling)

832
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:29,304
Are you serious?

833
00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:31,206
Yeah.

834
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,575
For who?

835
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,143
(Sighs)

836
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:36,144
Uh, that guy we met
at the bar the other night.

837
00:27:36,178 --> 00:27:37,480
Roger.

838
00:27:37,512 --> 00:27:38,614
I've... I've been
spending a lot of time with him

839
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:42,384
and I... he told me he was tryin'
to have kids forever.

840
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:43,251
What?

841
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,187
I... do you think
this is totally crazy?

842
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,088
Milo, babies are for women
in their mid-30s

843
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:48,090
who are tryin'
to save their marriage

844
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:49,125
and start parenting blogs.

845
00:27:49,157 --> 00:27:50,959
Oh my God, George.

846
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:53,096
- GEORGE: Hey, seriously?
- MILO: Yeah.

847
00:27:55,897 --> 00:27:59,836
Can you actually imagine
givin' up a baby, though?

848
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:02,672
I mean l... uh, listen,

849
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:04,105
I know
it's gonna be really intense

850
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:05,507
and really difficult,

851
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,608
but I just feel like everything
in my life right now

852
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:09,045
is like the same level
of difficult

853
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:10,312
and not difficult at all.

854
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:13,015
And it's just... honestly,
it's really paralyzing

855
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:14,549
to never feel pushed
to do something terrifying

856
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,485
and meaningful.

857
00:28:16,518 --> 00:28:17,386
you know?

858
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:20,255
Shit, wow.

859
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,227
GEORGE: Can we start a
gay parenting Instagram

860
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:25,260
called "Roommates" or something?

861
00:28:25,294 --> 00:28:27,563
Uh, yes!

862
00:28:27,596 --> 00:28:28,029
Yes.

863
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:29,532
Obviously, yes.

864
00:28:29,565 --> 00:28:31,033
Mm.

865
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,235
Uh.

866
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:33,169
Okay, you promise
you don't think this is

867
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:35,136
like the craziest thing
I've ever done.

868
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,572
Oh, I think
you're totally fuckin' crazy,

869
00:28:36,605 --> 00:28:39,008
but I also think this is
a pretty awesome thing.

870
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,308
Also, oh my God,
a fuckin' baby.

871
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:41,509
I love other people's kids,
I get to give back.

872
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,111
Yeah.

873
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:44,646
Okay.

874
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,349
Just don't tell Noor yet okay?

875
00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:46,949
Why?

876
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:48,951
I ju... I... come on, I...

877
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:50,653
I do not need to
be talked out of it right now.

878
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:52,989
(Indistinct chatter in distance)

879
00:28:53,021 --> 00:28:54,123
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

880
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:57,157
(Indistinct conversation)

881
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,494
(Whispering)
I go, "pow".

882
00:28:58,527 --> 00:28:59,629
(Indistinct speech)

883
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:00,596
So pretty and...

884
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:01,897
Glad we came.

885
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:04,634
(Indistinct conversation)

886
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:06,067
(Milo screaming)

887
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:06,502
- NOOR: Oh!
- Fuck.

888
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:07,302
(Noor grunts)

889
00:29:07,336 --> 00:29:07,970
- NOOR: Ow!
- WOMAN 3: What happened?

890
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:09,605
NOOR:
Oh shit, my ankle!

891
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:10,438
(Grunting)

892
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:11,374
What the fuck, Milo?

893
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:12,574
She's pregnant.

894
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:14,277
I know, I'm... uh, are you okay?

895
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:15,543
I'm sorry.

896
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:17,046
- You know I hate being scared.
- MILO: I know.

897
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:18,446
I'm really sorry,
that was stupid.

898
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,216
- Are you okay?
- NOOR: I don't know.

899
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:21,284
It's awesome.

900
00:29:23,018 --> 00:29:25,922
(Indicator ticking)

901
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:30,092
(Sighing)

902
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:34,063
(Traffic whooshing
and siren ringing in background)

903
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,639
(Sighs)

904
00:29:57,553 --> 00:30:00,323
MILO: Hey,
do you guys sell ovulation tests?

905
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:03,292
(Rustling)

906
00:30:29,684 --> 00:30:32,621
(Peeing)

907
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:45,200
(Knocking on door)

908
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:46,067
Hi.

909
00:30:46,101 --> 00:30:47,169
Hi.

910
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,770
Hi, what... uh,
it's good to see you.

911
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:50,439
Didn't we say a couple of weeks?

912
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:52,141
MILO: Yes, you know, but
uh, I was just thinking

913
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:54,609
like does it make a difference?

914
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:56,511
You know you've been thinking
about this for 20 years, right?

915
00:30:56,545 --> 00:30:58,413
What... huh, what's another week?

916
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:00,081
Like when you... oh, when...
when you're a dad,

917
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:02,084
you're not gonna have like
the luxury of time, you know?

918
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:04,252
You're just gonna have to
like make snap decisions

919
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:05,453
from your gut.

920
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:06,389
Do you have like a... a cup
or something?

921
00:31:07,321 --> 00:31:08,790
Uh.

922
00:31:08,824 --> 00:31:10,292
Ah, thank you.

923
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:11,393
Okay, so I was thinking

924
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:14,195
like we could go poll a room
of 100 people, right,

925
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:15,798
and see if they think
this is a good idea or not,

926
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,132
but what if the answer is "no"?

927
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:19,701
(Pouring drink)

928
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:20,535
Okay.

929
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:23,605
(Rustling)

930
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,808
It's gotta be now
or like maybe in another month,

931
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:29,245
but it's... it's not gonna be
in two weeks.

932
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,048
We need to draw up a contract
or something first

933
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,815
at the very least.

934
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,617
I will sign whatever you want me
to sign, okay,

935
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:38,354
but... but like you know,
how when you're out drunk

936
00:31:38,386 --> 00:31:40,288
with friends and...
and someone's like, "Oh,

937
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:41,589
we should all go camping",

938
00:31:41,623 --> 00:31:43,259
and then another person is like,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah,

939
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:44,793
I have family in Maine",
and then someone else is like,

940
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:46,461
"Ooh I have a tent" you know,
and then...

941
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:47,562
And then you wake up
the next morning,

942
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:49,698
and everyone like still pretends
to be into the idea,

943
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,333
but the idea has just
like totally lost its magic,

944
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:52,334
and it never ends up happening.

945
00:31:52,366 --> 00:31:53,068
(Pouring drink)

946
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:54,170
What?

947
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:55,336
I'm just saying.

948
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:56,738
I think there's like something
to be said

949
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:59,407
for riding the momentum.

950
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:02,310
I don't know anything about you
or your family history.

951
00:32:02,344 --> 00:32:05,114
- Did you even go to college?
- Yes, I went to college!

952
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:06,682
I went to Vassar.

953
00:32:06,714 --> 00:32:08,451
I... I double majored in music,
and Greek, and Roman studies.

954
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:09,651
Awesome, useful choice.

955
00:32:09,684 --> 00:32:13,254
Um, I got a 2110 on my SATs,
I'm allergic to pet dander,

956
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:14,824
and kiwis.

957
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:17,660
I'm on 20 milligrams of Celexa
for depression and anxiety,

958
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:18,795
and um...

959
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:24,265
Both of my parents are dead.

960
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:25,634
(Vehicle whooshing in distance)

961
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,602
- Is that supposed to be a joke?
- No.

962
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:30,439
No, no, they're both...
they're both actually dead.

963
00:32:30,471 --> 00:32:32,340
My dad died five years ago
of pancreatic cancer

964
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:35,177
and my mom um,

965
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,511
she committed suicide
when I was 10.

966
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:39,148
So you have full disclosure,

967
00:32:39,181 --> 00:32:41,549
you're like really,
really rolling the dice here,

968
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:44,854
both physically and mentally,
but um,

969
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:47,255
Roger, I'm here,
and I wanna do this, and I...

970
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:49,424
I am in if you are.

971
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:50,826
(Slurping)

972
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:51,726
MILO:
Uh, you know, at least,

973
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,195
if your kid
turns out super fucked up,

974
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:55,498
no one can
blame the single gay parent.

975
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,867
(Vehicle honking in distance)

976
00:32:58,901 --> 00:32:59,567
What the hell?

977
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:01,203
Okay.

978
00:33:01,236 --> 00:33:05,141
Um, I don't think I'm gonna
get another shot at this.

979
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:06,142
Yeah?

980
00:33:06,174 --> 00:33:08,443
Yeah.

981
00:33:08,477 --> 00:33:09,545
Okay.

982
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:12,780
(Pouring)

983
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:15,683
(Vehicle whirring in distance)

984
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:16,886
I'm worried
I'm gonna get whiskey dick.

985
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:17,853
(Chuckling)

986
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:18,753
(Slurping)

987
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:20,722
(Chuckling)

988
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:25,461
So what do we do?

989
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:29,531
Uh, well, when um,
a very, very old drag queen

990
00:33:29,565 --> 00:33:30,900
loves a young coed very much...

991
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:32,800
(Chuckling)

992
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:33,869
MILO:
No.

993
00:33:33,902 --> 00:33:34,603
Uh,
what kinda porn do you watch?

994
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:36,571
Milo, come on.

995
00:33:36,605 --> 00:33:37,740
Oh my God, Roger,

996
00:33:37,772 --> 00:33:38,807
stop clutching those pearls
so tightly.

997
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,507
(Chuckling)

998
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,174
(Vehicle honking in distance)

999
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:43,278
Okay, let's see, let's see.

1000
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:45,947
Okay, uh, here we have
what looks like a gym teacher

1001
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,317
who's probably not winning
any teacher of the year awards.

1002
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:51,353
Ooh, we got a dad
who should definitely

1003
00:33:51,385 --> 00:33:52,954
not be doing that
with the stepson.

1004
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:56,424
Okay, um, orgy, May-December
Ebony and Ivory.

1005
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:59,894
Just normal average
gay consenting adults, please.

1006
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:00,930
(Chuckles)

1007
00:34:00,962 --> 00:34:01,797
MILO:
Okay.

1008
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:03,698
(Sighs)

1009
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:04,732
(Roger slurping)

1010
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,634
- MAN 6: (On video) Hey.
- MAN 7: (On video) Hi.

1011
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:07,769
MAN 6: (On video)
I'm Steve, the RA.

1012
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:08,836
MAN 7: (On video)
Alright.

1013
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:10,672
I'm sorry, we were just uh...

1014
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:11,507
- Milo, I just...
- What?

1015
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:14,509
- Uh.
- Just pretend I'm Steve, The RA.

1016

(Sighing)

1018
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:23,652
My um,
high school boyfriend said

1019
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:25,320
that I was really,
really good at this

1020
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:26,888
and he's gay now, so...

1021
00:34:26,922 --> 00:34:29,958
(Sighs)

1022
00:34:29,992 --> 00:34:32,528

to bring a gift

to the first date.

00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,742

should be treated.

(Chuckling)

1043
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,579
Um, I found this
in the bathroom.

1044
00:35:57,612 --> 00:35:58,579
I'm pretty sure
they gave it to me

1045
00:35:58,612 --> 00:36:01,783
to clean out my stitches
when I had oral surgery,

1046
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:03,686
but I don't think
I ever ended up using it.

1047
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,054
Great.

1048
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:07,922
Uh, do you wanna do this
out here or...

1049
00:36:07,956 --> 00:36:09,057
ROGER:
No, that's fine.

1050
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:09,958
You can use my room.

1051
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,527
It's not...

1052
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,063
I was in the bathroom.

1053
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:14,896
Okay.

1054
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:16,498
(Chuckles)

1055
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,666
Um, when was the last time you
had a half-naked lady

1056
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:19,034
in your bed?

1057
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:21,670
1983.

1058
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:23,471
Okay.

1059
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:24,773
Are you ready for this?

1060
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:32,514
Cheers.

1061
00:36:33,715 --> 00:36:35,451
Oh, yes, thank you.

1062
00:36:45,994 --> 00:36:48,497
I normally hate
having my hair touched.

1063
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,631
- Sorry.
- No!

1064
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:51,367
No, no, no, it... it...
keep going,

1065
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,735
it feels nice actually.

1066
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:57,572
(Chuckling)

1067
00:36:57,606 --> 00:37:00,676
So how did...
how did you end up here?

1068
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:01,743
Oh.

1069
00:37:01,777 --> 00:37:04,880
Um, I was 21,

1070
00:37:04,913 --> 00:37:09,385
and so happy to be out
of fucking Shipshewana, Indiana,

1071
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:12,621
and then I was really shocked
watching people get high,

1072
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:14,889
and fuck each other
at night in the park,

1073
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:17,024
and I didn't wanna be shocked,

1074
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:20,094
'cause I literally dreamed
of being here forever.

1075
00:37:20,128 --> 00:37:23,899
I was this little
counter cultural twink

1076
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:26,868
just bloated
with irony and angst at home.

1077
00:37:26,902 --> 00:37:28,170
And I got here,

1078
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:30,639
and I was like a nun
who'd escaped the convent.

1079
00:37:30,672 --> 00:37:32,007
(Chuckling)

1080
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:34,975
I wanted to be Freddie Mercury,

1081
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,146
but I knew I looked
like Fred Savage.

1082
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:38,146
(Chuckling)

1083
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:40,782
And that killed me.

1084
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:45,221
That's alright.

1085
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:47,422
So what's your story, chickadee?

1086
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:47,923
(Sighs)

1087
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:50,492
Mm-mm.

1088
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:52,059
Honestly,
I just kind of always wanted

1089
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:53,861
to be the girl in the band

1090
00:37:53,894 --> 00:37:56,063
instead of the girl
with the dead parents.

1091
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:57,666
ROGER:
Hmm.

1092
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:00,101
Yeah, well, joke's on me,
because they're still dead

1093
00:38:00,135 --> 00:38:02,571
and I'm not even in a band.

1094
00:38:03,972 --> 00:38:05,775
So...

1095
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:08,443
I should go.

1096
00:38:08,476 --> 00:38:11,980
I um, I...
I really feel fertilized.

1097
00:38:12,012 --> 00:38:13,548
(Sighs)

1098
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:15,150
Milo, I... I really, I...
I can't thank you enough.

1099
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:18,052
I... um, let's uh, get together
in a couple of weeks,

1100
00:38:18,085 --> 00:38:20,154
and talk about compensation
and everything.

1101
00:38:20,188 --> 00:38:21,923
Roger,
that is not why I'm doing this.

1102
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:22,625
ROGER:
Come on, that's ridiculous.

1103
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:23,858
I will see you in a few weeks.

1104
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:25,193
Let's do something fun.

1105
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,836
George!

1106
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,071
(Gasps)

1107
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:38,106
Teddy.

1108
00:38:39,773 --> 00:38:40,607
(Gasps)

1109
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:41,141
Ooh. You know,
she just peed on that!

1110
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:42,210
I just peed on that!

1111
00:38:42,242 --> 00:38:44,112
Hi, please, hi, I'm Teddy,
it's so nice to meet.

1112
00:38:44,144 --> 00:38:45,980
And you are definitely pregnant.

1113
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:47,015
(Cheering)

1114
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:48,182
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God!

1115
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:49,384
Oh, so like I don't even
know you,

1116
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,119
but I feel like that gay friend
the producer's bringin'

1117
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:52,920
on 16 and Pregnant
to ask the girl

1118
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:54,189
how she's doing
with all of this.

1119
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:55,858
Oh shit, okay, I gotta...
I gotta call Roger.

1120
00:38:55,891 --> 00:38:57,659
- No.
- What? Why?

1121
00:38:57,692 --> 00:38:59,094
Hey, where's the pageantry?

1122
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:00,262
You're only
gonna be gay pregnant once,

1123
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:01,597
at least put on a show.

1124
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,597
What do you want me to do?

1125
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,500
Like bake it into a fucking cake
or something?

1126
00:39:04,532 --> 00:39:08,269
I was thinkin' more like
you exit a cab full of doves,

1127
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:10,938
dressed as the Virgin Mary
in a rainbow shroud.

1128
00:39:10,972 --> 00:39:12,541
George, I'm not doing that.

1129
00:39:12,574 --> 00:39:14,108
Okay, fine, then at least
tell him in person.

1130
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:16,010

Jesus.

1143
00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:09,130
You know, it's Hesus.

1144
00:40:09,164 --> 00:40:11,266
Not when you're turning water
into wine.

1145
00:40:11,298 --> 00:40:13,268
This is Milo, my baby mama.

1146
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,069
It's like I'm meetin'
the Virgin of Guadalupe

1147
00:40:15,103 --> 00:40:15,836
in person herself.

1148
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:17,105
Hmm.

1149
00:40:17,137 --> 00:40:20,608
A glass of your okayes champagne
for Daddy Roger.

1150
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:22,043
Ew, stop saying it like that.

1151
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:22,778
(Chuckling)

1152
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:23,812
What can I gonna get you, mama?

1153
00:40:23,844 --> 00:40:24,946
Sunset surprise?

1154
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,048
Mm-mm.

1155
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:27,149
No, she can't drink,
she's pregnant.

1156
00:40:27,181 --> 00:40:29,617
No, I'll have a glass
of red please.

1157
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,885
I've actually read a bunch
of articles

1158
00:40:30,918 --> 00:40:32,920
that say it's completely fine
to have a glass of wine or two

1159
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:33,889
while you're pregnant,

1160
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:36,358
as long as you're not
like downing shots.

1161
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:39,161
It's just this like fear
propagated by suburban mothers

1162
00:40:39,193 --> 00:40:40,929
that are just
sitting at home obsessing

1163
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:42,965
about their future prodigy
and graduating summa cum laude

1164
00:40:42,998 --> 00:40:45,000
from Harvard.

1165
00:40:45,032 --> 00:40:46,268
People fuck their kids up
way worse

1166
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,069
by bein' Republicans
or Scientologists.

1167
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:49,104
Uh, right?

1168
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:50,238
MAN 8:
Salud.

1169
00:40:50,271 --> 00:40:51,306
graduating summa cum laude
from Harvard

1170
00:40:51,338 --> 00:40:52,807
doesn't sound like
the worst thing in the world.

1171
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,674
MILO:
Salud.

1172
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,143
Mm.

1173
00:40:55,175 --> 00:40:56,844
So do you have
any names picked out?

1174
00:40:56,878 --> 00:40:57,546
Well, my uh,

1175
00:40:57,579 --> 00:40:59,014
late grandmother's name was Edna

1176
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:00,615
and she was the kind of
brass tacks

1177
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:03,317
first-generation bitch
we need more of in this world.

1178
00:41:03,351 --> 00:41:04,119
(Grunting)

1179
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:05,354
What?

1180
00:41:05,387 --> 00:41:06,989
Sorry uh, there's just something
about babies

1181
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:08,090
with old-timey names.

1182
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:11,126
It just seems so like twee
and self-important to me.

1183
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:11,693
I don't know.

1184
00:41:11,726 --> 00:41:13,795
I think it's kinda cute.

1185
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:16,163
Okay, I'm keeping this baby
if you name it Edna.

1186
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:16,965
Okay.

1187
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:18,200
Not Edna then.

1188
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:21,869
(Milo chuckling)

1189
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:23,304
NOOR:
Thank you. Thank you.

1190
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:24,072
MILO:
Okay, okay, okay, do me.

1191
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,107
NOOR:
Alright, give it to me.

1192
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:26,007
Okay.

1193
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:28,844
(Grunting)

1194
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:30,311
(Indistinct lyrics)

1195
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:31,112
Alright, alright, alright.

1196
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:33,715
Oh, I got it, I got it,
I got it.

1197
00:41:33,748 --> 00:41:36,652
- Ready?
- Yes.

1198
00:41:36,684 --> 00:41:37,418
Yeah.

1199
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:38,920
(Chuckling)

1200
00:41:38,952 --> 00:41:39,887
Okay.

1201
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,822
(Clears throat)

1202
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:44,226
She's just
another white teenager

1203
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:48,730
who doesn't quite fit in
at her entirely white school.

1204
00:41:48,762 --> 00:41:52,366
I know who J.D. Salinger is,
but nobody else does.

1205
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,905
This spring, she'll find
three other weirdos

1206
00:41:56,938 --> 00:41:59,775
and a science teacher
to be friends with.

1207
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,009
Probably stupid.

1208
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,244
(Noor chuckling)

1209
00:42:03,277 --> 00:42:05,413
NOOR: You'll find that
sometimes growing up

1210
00:42:05,447 --> 00:42:08,416
means standing out.

1211
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:12,119
I'm 16, but my over familiar
relationship with adults

1212
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:15,923
is completely normal,
because I'm mature for my age.

1213
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:17,224
Yeah, pop that booty.

1214
00:42:17,257 --> 00:42:18,759
Pop that booty.

1215
00:42:18,793 --> 00:42:19,428
No, no, no, no, no!

1216
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,227
Do not get up.

1217
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,797
What do you want?

1218
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:23,699
Um, I was just gonna grab
a seltzer from the fridge.

1219
00:42:23,731 --> 00:42:24,699
- I'll get it.
- NOOR: Thank you.

1220
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:25,768
You're welcome.

1221
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:29,404
NOOR: There's some wine in
there, too, if you want it.

1222
00:42:29,436 --> 00:42:32,074
KJ feels so guilty drinking
without me.

1223
00:42:32,106 --> 00:42:35,009
She has like a thimble per week.

1224
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:38,279
Finish it
before it turns into vinegar.

1225
00:42:38,313 --> 00:42:39,081
No, I'm good.

1226
00:42:39,114 --> 00:42:40,449
I'm just
gonna have a seltzer, too.

1227
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:41,882
NOOR:
You okay?

1228
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:42,984
(Chuckling)

1229
00:42:43,016 --> 00:42:43,484
Yeah.

1230
00:42:43,518 --> 00:42:44,853
Uh, wow.

1231
00:42:44,885 --> 00:42:47,088
Am I really
that much of an alcoholic?

1232
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:47,955
No, I've just never known you

1233
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:51,192
to turn down
a glass of wine before.

1234
00:42:51,226 --> 00:42:53,361
Well, um, I'm...

1235
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:56,263
I'm pregnant.

1236
00:42:56,297 --> 00:42:58,467
You're fucking with me.

1237
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:03,170
Nope.

1238
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:05,474
Two months

1239
00:43:05,507 --> 00:43:06,942
How?

1240
00:43:06,974 --> 00:43:08,009
I didn't even know
you were seeing anyone.

1241
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,512
I'm not, I met this
really awesome older gay man

1242
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:14,048
who desperately wants
to be a dad and I...

1243
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:15,317
I offered to be a surrogate.

1244
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:16,018
I don't know.

1245
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:16,717
We got really close, we've had...

1246
00:43:16,751 --> 00:43:18,487
What are you even talking about?

1247
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:19,855
That's insane!

1248
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:22,023
This is insane.

1249
00:43:22,056 --> 00:43:23,391
No, honestly,
I don't need a lawyer right now.

1250
00:43:23,423 --> 00:43:25,192
Thank you.

1251
00:43:25,226 --> 00:43:27,929
This... this is exactly... fuck,
what I told George would happen.

1252
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:30,264
- You told George?
- Yes, dude, I did okay?

1253
00:43:30,297 --> 00:43:31,265
And I'm not gonna
be guilt-tripped,

1254
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:32,934
because I chose to tell someone
that I knew

1255
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:33,800
who would just support me.

1256
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:35,237
Being supportive
is not the same thing

1257
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:36,438
as being enabling.

1258
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:38,005
I'm not like an addict, Noor,
okay?

1259
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:39,841
I'm an adult like you

1260
00:43:39,873 --> 00:43:41,275
and I'm allowed
to make decisions.

1261
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:43,912
I'm allowed to make like really,
really big life decisions.

1262
00:43:43,945 --> 00:43:45,213
But it's never a decision
with you,

1263
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:46,548
it's always just an impulse.

1264
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:47,916
Yeah, you know what it is?

1265
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:48,849
It's never just
advice with you, dude,

1266
00:43:48,884 --> 00:43:50,251
It's always just
a fuckin' therapy session.

1267
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:53,387

00:43:58,293 --> 00:44:00,229

helped me out the last time

1335
00:46:21,702 --> 00:46:23,704
and I didn't buy anything,
so I'm gonna

1336
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:27,207
give her the sales commission
on this one.

Straight up, I was kinda hopin'
you'd be here.

1343
00:46:41,255 --> 00:46:43,023
Oh yeah, that's the phone here.

1344
00:46:43,056 --> 00:46:45,392
They've destroyed it last year,
because it was ringing too much.

1345
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:47,061
But can I give you my number,
so you have it?

1346
00:46:47,094 --> 00:46:48,195
Yes, you may.

00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,135

1354
00:47:07,815 --> 00:47:10,518
No, with a very fine musician.

1355
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,386
I uh,
totally fucked up my makeup,

1356
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,023
so I came to beg for a touch-up,
and I figured I'd stop by

1357
00:47:15,056 --> 00:47:17,157
and bring you some literature
you might like,

1358
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,061
very queer, very downright,
social construct.

00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:28,102
No, thank you, that's great.

1375
00:47:59,634 --> 00:48:01,702
Okay, uh, do you have
any liquid liner?

1376
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:03,137
This is a mess.

1377
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:03,637
Yeah.

1378
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,373
Um, fair warning,

1379
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:07,808
I don't have much experience
with civilian makeup.

1380
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:09,210
That's okay.

1381
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:12,047

1382
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,148

this is my partner Jamie.

We are

1387
00:48:25,793 --> 00:48:29,264
first things first, you gotta
come up with a team name.

1388
00:48:29,297 --> 00:48:32,067
Now your team name does not have
to be funny or clever,

1389
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,835
but it sure helps

1390
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:36,503
I mean if it's not a guitar pun,
we're doin' something wrong.

1391
00:48:36,536 --> 00:48:39,173
Mm, puns and roses, thin quizzy,
pinball quizzard.

those loaded and about?

Yes, yes, I do.

00:48:41,476 --> 00:48:43,278

1395
00:48:43,311 --> 00:48:44,479
How about G string?

1396
00:48:44,512 --> 00:48:46,247
Yeah,
that seems a little bass for me,

1397
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,117
but um, I can fuck with it,

1398
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,385
Oh, I'm sorry.

1399
00:48:50,418 --> 00:48:53,253
My puns
aren't up to your standards

1400
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:55,622
unless bass was supposed
to be a pun,

1401
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:57,358
in which case
they most definitely are.

1402
00:48:57,391 --> 00:48:58,526
Mm.

1403
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,496

to be this lame.

the Astros, the Rangers.

1417
00:49:32,492 --> 00:49:33,360
What?

1418
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:35,262
Hey, sports fan.

1419
00:49:35,295 --> 00:49:36,530
My dad grew up in Ghana,

1420
00:49:36,563 --> 00:49:38,799
but he was obsessed
with American baseball.

1421
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:41,269
He still collects cards.

1422
00:49:41,302 --> 00:49:42,903
You see,
this is why I like trivia.

1423
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:45,139
Let's you rush past
all the what's your middle name,

1424
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:46,040
and do you have any pets,

1425
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:48,610
and get to
what's actually interesting.

1426
00:49:48,643 --> 00:49:50,311
KIM:
There you go.

1427
00:49:51,278 --> 00:49:53,181
- Hey, enjoy.
- Thank you.

1428
00:49:53,213 --> 00:49:56,550
Are you sure
you don't wanna drink drink?

1429
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:57,784
Uh, yeah, no, I just...
I don't know.

1430
00:49:57,818 --> 00:49:59,754
I don't wanna get tired.

1431
00:49:59,786 --> 00:50:07,661
Roland Orzabal was one half
of which English pop rock band?

1432
00:50:07,695 --> 00:50:09,831
Tears for Fears, bitch.

1433
00:50:09,864 --> 00:50:11,666
I was actually
junior class social chair

1434
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:12,800
and I refused to play anything

1435
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:14,635
besides British
'80s rock anthems

1436
00:50:14,668 --> 00:50:16,237
for all three and a half hours
of homecoming

1437
00:50:16,269 --> 00:50:18,273
and they unanimously voted
to impeach me

1438
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,941
halfway through the dance, so...

1439
00:50:19,974 --> 00:50:23,912
That's kinda baller
in a really, really lame way.

1440
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:25,547
Funny that you say that,

1441
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:28,348
because lame baller was
my very first AIM screen name

1442
00:50:28,382 --> 00:50:30,818
and it will be the title
of my autobiography.

1443
00:50:30,851 --> 00:50:32,921
GIANA: Alright, friends,
for number three...

1444
00:50:32,954 --> 00:50:34,756
(Chuckling)

1445
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:37,392
Oh, whoa!

1446
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:38,693
Cute.

1447
00:50:38,726 --> 00:50:41,563
Hmm, welcome to the pad.

1448
00:50:41,596 --> 00:50:44,565
A first place trophy would have
looked so good in here.

1449
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:47,235
No, they don't give you a trophy
for first place.

1450
00:50:47,268 --> 00:50:48,503
I'd know.

1451
00:50:48,536 --> 00:50:51,539
Well, thanks for
my consolation prize sticker.

1452
00:50:51,572 --> 00:50:53,508
I'm um,
I'm gonna look at it every day

1453
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:54,976
and think about
how mediocre I am.

1454
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:56,911
You need a sticker for that?

1455
00:50:56,943 --> 00:50:58,380
I guess I do.

1456
00:50:59,847 --> 00:51:03,718
I don't think
you're mediocre at all.

1457
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:05,320
I think you're the worst.

1458
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,721
(Chuckles)

1459
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:12,226
(Kissing)

1460
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:20,735
(Grunting)

1461
00:51:20,768 --> 00:51:23,704
(Kissing)

1462
00:51:26,273 --> 00:51:26,807
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1463
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,344
Um, hold on a sec, okay?

1464
00:51:29,376 --> 00:51:30,679
Uh...

1465
00:51:35,548 --> 00:51:38,452
(Tap running in distance)

1466
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:44,324
Hey.

1467
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:46,494
Hey.

1468
00:51:46,527 --> 00:51:48,396
Did you put on my shirt?

1469
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:53,033
I'm sorry,
I didn't tell you earlier.

1470
00:51:53,067 --> 00:51:54,869
I just uh...

1471
00:51:54,902 --> 00:51:56,737
You know, it didn't come up

1472
00:51:56,771 --> 00:51:58,873
in any of the trivia
night questions, so...

1473
00:51:58,905 --> 00:52:01,643
Yeah, I feel like maybe you
could have mentioned it

1474
00:52:01,675 --> 00:52:04,411
before I had your clothes
halfway off your body.

1475
00:52:04,445 --> 00:52:05,780
I mean would you have
still asked me out

1476
00:52:05,813 --> 00:52:06,713
if I told you?

1477
00:52:06,746 --> 00:52:07,815
That feels like entrapment.

1478
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:10,751
Don't they say entrapment
is like the sincerest form

1479
00:52:10,784 --> 00:52:11,952
of flattery?

1480
00:52:15,956 --> 00:52:17,925
I'm sorry.

1481
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:20,827
So after this what?

1482
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:25,400
Just another four or five months
and it's done?

1483
00:52:25,432 --> 00:52:27,068
No, I mean I...
I think I'll be more

1484
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:30,938
like a... an aunt or um...

1485
00:52:30,971 --> 00:52:32,572
I don't know.

1486
00:52:32,606 --> 00:52:36,044
The non-denominational
godparent,

1487
00:52:36,077 --> 00:52:38,780
like a not religious
to spiritual parent.

1488
00:52:42,782 --> 00:52:47,422
Can I ask you why
you decided to do this?

1489
00:52:47,454 --> 00:52:49,923
I mean I know it's...
it's like a great thing to do,

1490
00:52:49,956 --> 00:52:52,826
but like why?

1491
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:56,864
(Sighs)

1492
00:52:57,264 --> 00:52:58,965
Do you ever feel like um,

1493
00:52:58,998 --> 00:53:01,802
like you've already experienced
the most intense version

1494
00:53:01,835 --> 00:53:05,572
of like every emotion
you'll ever feel?

1495
00:53:05,606 --> 00:53:06,708
What do you mean?

1496
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,809
Like...

1497
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:13,080
Okay, like, like um...
uh, like when you're a kid

1498
00:53:13,114 --> 00:53:17,552
or um, or a teenager
and like you know,

1499
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:20,887
you feel fear or pain or loss
for the first time you know,

1500
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,790
it's... it's so intense.

1501
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:28,061
So you decided to do this
because it's like a...

1502
00:53:28,094 --> 00:53:31,131
A new feeling?

1503
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:32,099
That...
I mean that makes me sound

1504
00:53:32,132 --> 00:53:33,835
like I'm being
entirely self-serving, but...

1505
00:53:33,867 --> 00:53:34,802
No, I'm just saying.

1506
00:53:34,835 --> 00:53:38,004
It's a... it's a pretty
big decision to make

1507
00:53:38,038 --> 00:53:40,641
for the sake of catharsis.

1508
00:53:40,673 --> 00:53:47,815
Yeah, I mean when m...
I had a lot of...

1509
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:49,116
(Sighs)

1510
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,018
A lot of really
shitty family stuff happen

1511
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,586
when I was a kid and...

1512
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:54,588
Hmm.

1513
00:53:54,621 --> 00:53:55,889
I don't know.

1514
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:57,858
I just looked for something else
to feel intensely

1515
00:53:57,891 --> 00:54:02,462
to make the other feelings
seem duller.

1516
00:54:02,496 --> 00:54:06,166
Like you know how when there's
a car alarm going off outside

1517
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:08,568
and like you turn on the AC
even though you're not hot,

1518
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:11,471
because like the sound
that's closer to your ear

1519
00:54:11,505 --> 00:54:14,776
just kinda
quiets the louder one.

1520
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:16,044
(Chuckles)

1521
00:54:25,686 --> 00:54:26,421
I'm sorry.

1522
00:54:26,454 --> 00:54:28,623
I just... I really...

1523
00:54:28,655 --> 00:54:32,793
I really hate
having my hair played with.

1524
00:54:32,827 --> 00:54:34,996
I like you a little bit, Milo.

1525
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:41,101
I like you a little bit, too.

1526
00:54:48,141 --> 00:54:51,078
(Kissing)

1527
00:54:56,516 --> 00:54:57,150
Okay.

1528
00:54:57,184 --> 00:55:00,688
Um, Renée.

1529
00:55:00,721 --> 00:55:02,190
- ROGER: Too French.
- Mm.

1530
00:55:02,222 --> 00:55:03,724
Jack?

1531
00:55:03,757 --> 00:55:05,193
Too John Cougar Mellencamp.

1532
00:55:05,226 --> 00:55:05,827
(Chuckles)

1533
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:06,894
Okay.

1534
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:07,894
Voldemort.

1535
00:55:07,927 --> 00:55:08,795
That is perfect.

1536
00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:10,097
(Chuckling)

1537
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:16,670
Do you ever talk to the baby
or... or read to it or anything?

1538
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:19,474
Uh, no.

1539
00:55:19,507 --> 00:55:21,041
No, I guess I don't.

1540
00:55:21,074 --> 00:55:24,945
I picked up this book of poems
about pregnancy

1541
00:55:24,978 --> 00:55:26,913
and I don't know,
I wanted to give it to you

1542
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:28,883
in case you wanted to try it
sometime.

1543
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:31,652
I've read that it's good
for the baby to be talked to.

1544
00:55:31,684 --> 00:55:34,221
Yes, of course.

1545
00:55:34,255 --> 00:55:34,889
Uh.

1546
00:55:34,922 --> 00:55:36,690
Ah, the Consecrating Mother.

1547
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:37,758
I love Anne Sexton.

1548
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:39,660
Okay.

1549
00:55:39,693 --> 00:55:42,230
Uh, "I stand before the sea,

1550
00:55:42,262 --> 00:55:45,699
and it rolls and rolls
in its green blood saying..."

1551
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:46,667
Can I actually read it?

1552
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:48,768
Um, if it's okay with you?

1553
00:55:48,802 --> 00:55:53,140
I really want the baby
to know my voice

1554
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:54,674
if that's really a thing?

1555
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:55,710
I...

1556
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:57,612
Yes, of course, read it.

1557
00:56:01,748 --> 00:56:04,084
(Sniffles)

1558
00:56:04,117 --> 00:56:09,523
ROGER: "Saying, 'Do not give up
one God for I have a handful.'

1559
00:56:09,556 --> 00:56:10,625
The trade winds blew

1560
00:56:10,657 --> 00:56:12,058
in their twelve-fingered
reversal

1561
00:56:12,092 --> 00:56:14,195
and I simply stood on the beach

1562
00:56:14,228 --> 00:56:16,864
while the ocean
made a cross of salt

1563
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:22,636
and hung up its drowned
and they cried Deo Deo.

1564
00:56:24,204 --> 00:56:27,875
The ocean offered them up
in the vein of its might.

1565
00:56:27,907 --> 00:56:28,775
I wanted to share this,

1566
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:32,914
but I stood alone
like a pink scarecrow.

1567
00:56:32,947 --> 00:56:35,782
The ocean steamed in and out,

1568
00:56:35,815 --> 00:56:39,920
the ocean gasped upon the shore,
but I could not define her.

1569
00:56:39,954 --> 00:56:44,926
I could not name her mood,
her locked-up faces.

1570
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:50,196
Far off, she rolled and rolled
like a woman in labor

1571
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:53,000
and I thought of those
who had crossed her

1572
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:58,873
in antiquity, in nautical trade,
in slavery, in war.

1573
00:56:58,905 --> 00:57:03,009
I wondered how
she had borne those bulwarks.

1574
00:57:03,043 --> 00:57:04,745
She should be entered
skin to skin

1575
00:57:04,777 --> 00:57:07,781
and put on like one's first
or last cloth,

1576
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:10,251
envered like kneeling your way
into church,

1577
00:57:10,284 --> 00:57:15,222
descending into that ascension,
though she be slick as olive oil

1578
00:57:15,255 --> 00:57:19,794
as she climbs each wave
like an embezzler of white."

1579
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:22,930
Let's read the end together.

1580
00:57:22,963 --> 00:57:24,098
Oh, okay.

1581
00:57:25,865 --> 00:57:28,101
Uh, the big deep.

1582
00:57:28,135 --> 00:57:32,340
(Together) "The big deep knows
the law as it wears its gray hat."

1583
00:57:32,373 --> 00:57:33,974
(Chuckles)

1584
00:57:34,007 --> 00:57:36,276
(Together) "Though the
ocean comes in its destiny

1585
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:38,645
with its 100 lips,

1586
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:42,316
and in moonlight
she comes in her nudity,

1587
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:45,653
flashing breasts
made of milk water,

1588
00:57:45,686 --> 00:57:49,957
flashing buttocks
made of unkillable lust,

1589
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:56,396
and at night when you enter her,
you shine like a neon soprano.

1590
00:57:56,429 --> 00:58:01,101
I am that clumsy human
on the shore

1591
00:58:01,135 --> 00:58:06,641
loving you,
coming, coming, going,

1592
00:58:06,673 --> 00:58:11,813
and wish to put my thumb on you
like The Song of Solomon."

1593
00:58:19,286 --> 00:58:20,688
There you go.

1594
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:22,789
Some little fingers
and toes there.

1595
00:58:22,822 --> 00:58:23,723
We like fingers and toes.

1596
00:58:23,757 --> 00:58:24,759
Yay, fingers and toes.

1597
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:27,427
Thanks, I grew them myself.

1598
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,396
DOCTOR: Since you're a bit late
for your five-month appointment

1599
00:58:29,429 --> 00:58:31,898
and your little friend
is being cooperative,

1600
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:33,767
I can tell you the sex today
if you wanna know.

1601
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,835
- Oh my God, wonderful.
- Oh, no.

1602
00:58:34,867 --> 00:58:35,902
No, I don't really wanna know.

1603
00:58:38,706 --> 00:58:39,240
DOCTOR:
Okay.

1604
00:58:39,273 --> 00:58:41,075
(Doctor chuckles)

1605
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:42,343
It's common for one parent
to wanna know

1606
00:58:42,376 --> 00:58:44,345
and the other
to remain surprised.

1607
00:58:44,378 --> 00:58:46,414
Ms. Winiker, if you wanna
step out of the room after this,

1608
00:58:46,447 --> 00:58:49,349
I can tell Mr. Nyhum
the sex of the baby.

1609
00:58:49,382 --> 00:58:51,117
ROGER:
I think I'd really like to know.

1610
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,886
I'm... I'm 52.

1611
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,988
At this point,
I'd like to remove

1612
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:57,124
as much uncertainty
from the process as possible.

1613
00:58:57,157 --> 00:58:59,026
Yeah, I just...
I always imagined

1614
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:01,062
being surprised the first time,
you know?

1615
00:59:01,094 --> 00:59:03,963
Did you imagine it like this?

1616
00:59:03,996 --> 00:59:05,298
Roger, I don't wanna know, okay?

1617
00:59:05,331 --> 00:59:06,833
If you do, that's fine.

1618
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:10,104
I have to go pee anyway
for like 500th time today.

1619
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,277
(Phone ringing in distance)

1620
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:18,145
(Door shuts)

1621
00:59:20,514 --> 00:59:23,317
(Vehicles whooshing in distance)

1622
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:24,751
Hey.

1623
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,989
Hi.

1624
00:59:29,021 --> 00:59:30,924
You're upset or something?

1625
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,159
Just exhausted

1626
00:59:32,192 --> 00:59:33,793
and it's like started
to move around,

1627
00:59:33,827 --> 00:59:38,365
which is just like
the weirdest feeling imaginable.

1628
00:59:38,398 --> 00:59:40,034
I asked her not to tell me.

1629
00:59:42,135 --> 00:59:44,170
Really?

1630
00:59:44,204 --> 00:59:45,506
Yeah.

1631
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:47,041
Uh, what do I care?

1632
00:59:47,074 --> 00:59:49,143
I'm tryin' to parent
beyond pink and blue anyway.

1633
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:52,180
Thank you.

1634
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:57,251
(Grunting)

1635
00:59:57,284 --> 00:59:59,854
So my lawyer friend finally
got the contract back to me

1636
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,389
and I thought
now is as good a time as any

1637
01:00:02,422 --> 01:00:06,793
to hand it off to you.

1638
01:00:06,827 --> 01:00:08,262
Are you like suddenly afraid

1639
01:00:08,295 --> 01:00:10,197
I'm gonna steal this kid
from you?

1640
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,233
ROGER: No,
I mean it protects you, too.

1641
01:00:12,266 --> 01:00:15,536
If I go swimming in the Hudson
and contract a...

1642
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:20,039
a brain parasite, I can't
shelf this kid off on you.

1643
01:00:20,072 --> 01:00:21,375
Anyway, you get those back
to me next month

1644
01:00:21,407 --> 01:00:22,909
at the appointment.

1645
01:00:22,943 --> 01:00:25,211
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure
I'll see you before then.

1646
01:00:25,244 --> 01:00:26,346
ROGER:
Just uh, let me know.

1647
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,815
This week is crazy for me.

1648
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,954
Okay, yeah, I'll uh,
I'll see you soon, Roger.

1649
01:00:39,293 --> 01:00:40,861
(Chuckling)

1650
01:00:40,893 --> 01:00:42,962
MILO: Chuck chuck to
Bustin, chuck chuck to Linn,

1651
01:00:42,996 --> 01:00:46,133
Be careful little Lilah's
starting to fall in!

1652
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:46,901
- Oh!
- GEORGE: Oh.

1653
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:47,835
Okay, okay, okay.

1654
01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:52,907
Who had uh, white people
like white people?

1655
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:57,010
(Chuckling)

1656
01:00:57,043 --> 01:00:59,045
Very good, very funny.

1657
01:00:59,079 --> 01:00:59,880
(Chuckling)

1658
01:00:59,913 --> 01:01:01,014
I win.

1659
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:03,550
Um, I call it
"preferential treatment".

1660
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:07,153
If I was
giving preferential treatment,

1661
01:01:07,186 --> 01:01:09,088
it would be to you.

1662
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:10,223
(Kissing)

1663
01:01:10,257 --> 01:01:12,159
GEORGE:
Oh please, they're cute.

1664
01:01:12,192 --> 01:01:13,561
I wanna play charades.

1665
01:01:13,594 --> 01:01:15,362
It's George's birthday.

1666
01:01:15,394 --> 01:01:16,063
What do you wanna play?

1667
01:01:16,096 --> 01:01:17,431
Yeah, I mean charades is good.

1668
01:01:17,463 --> 01:01:19,166
Milo, are we still waiting
for Roger?

1669
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:20,334
Uh, I don't know,

1670
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:21,502
I don't know
if he's gonna make it.

1671
01:01:21,534 --> 01:01:23,403
I am sure
we'll meet him eventually.

1672
01:01:23,436 --> 01:01:24,938
(Lilah sobbing)

1673
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,473
Yeah.

1674
01:01:26,505 --> 01:01:27,907
Uh, I mean he works nights
and he's about to have a baby,

1675
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,209
he's a really busy guy.

1676
01:01:29,242 --> 01:01:31,846
(Lilah cooing)

1677
01:01:31,878 --> 01:01:33,213
MILO:
Okay, are you getting fussy?

1678
01:01:33,246 --> 01:01:33,914
I'm gonna
put her in right there.

1679
01:01:33,947 --> 01:01:35,982
Sure, yeah, put here right in.

1680
01:01:36,016 --> 01:01:38,052
Little bit of fussy girl.

1681
01:01:41,188 --> 01:01:42,556
Uh, does anybody want anything
to drink?

1682
01:01:42,588 --> 01:01:43,891
Oh, I'll have another Sixpoint.

1683
01:01:43,923 --> 01:01:44,324
Thanks.

1684
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:45,593
Hmm.

1685
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:52,199
Shit.

1686
01:01:52,231 --> 01:01:53,867
We're uh... we're out.

1687
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,103
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go out
and get some.

1688
01:01:56,135 --> 01:01:57,403
No, don't worry about it.

1689
01:01:57,436 --> 01:01:58,270
- No, we are fine.
- No, it's fine.

1690
01:01:58,304 --> 01:02:00,540
Honestly,
I need the fresh air anyway.

1691
01:02:02,976 --> 01:02:04,045
(Popping)

1692
01:02:40,246 --> 01:02:41,547
(Grunting)

1693
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:42,383
Thank you so much.

1694
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,350
(Chuckling)

1695
01:02:43,382 --> 01:02:45,151
Thank you so much.

1696
01:02:45,184 --> 01:02:47,453
GEORGE: Jesus,
did you go to Alpha Centauri?

1697
01:02:47,487 --> 01:02:49,088
You've been gone
like 35 minutes.

1698
01:02:49,121 --> 01:02:51,291
Yeah, yeah,
the corner deli was closed.

1699
01:02:57,097 --> 01:03:00,701
NOOR: Alright, we gotta come up
with some words for charades.

1700
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:05,038
How about
some obscure legal Latin?

1701
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:08,041
Write "res ipsa loquitur".

1702
01:03:08,074 --> 01:03:09,076
Ugh, amazing.

1703
01:03:09,108 --> 01:03:09,943
I don't even know what that is.

1704
01:03:09,976 --> 01:03:12,045
It goes without saying.

1705
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,682
I mean okay, it's... I don't...
I don't speak Latin.

1706
01:03:14,715 --> 01:03:17,318
No, that's what it means,
"it goes without saying".

1707
01:03:17,351 --> 01:03:20,521
Oh, right.

1708
01:03:20,554 --> 01:03:22,056
Uh, speaking of Latin,
have you had a chance

1709
01:03:22,088 --> 01:03:24,157
to look over my contract?

1710
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:27,226
Yeah, we should make some time
to talk about it.

1711
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,630
Okay, uh, we're here now.

1712
01:03:29,663 --> 01:03:32,967
Yeah, but uh, I just had
a glass of wine and...

1713
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,268
(Noor takes a deep breath)

1714
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,603
It's more
than a five-minute conversation.

1715
01:03:36,635 --> 01:03:39,239
Noor, I wasn't like asking you
to write me a legal brief

1716
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:40,641
I just...
I wanted you to look over it

1717
01:03:40,673 --> 01:03:42,576
and make sure
everything seemed normal.

1718
01:03:42,608 --> 01:03:44,177
Okay.

1719
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:46,179
MILO:
Thank you.

1720
01:03:46,213 --> 01:03:48,015
(Sighs)

1721
01:03:48,047 --> 01:03:50,984
(Rustling)

1722
01:03:55,789 --> 01:03:57,491
"The surrogate shall relinquish

1723
01:03:57,523 --> 01:03:59,625
and the genetic father
shall take immediate, full,

1724
01:03:59,659 --> 01:04:03,030
and absolute custody
of the child upon birth,

1725
01:04:03,063 --> 01:04:05,432
and all decisions
concerning the child's health,

1726
01:04:05,465 --> 01:04:07,434
in utero and after delivery,

1727
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:09,503
shall be made
by the genetic father."

1728
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:14,640
I'm worried that's
incredibly prohibitive language.

1729
01:04:14,673 --> 01:04:18,045
No, it's just a technicality
that protects both of us.

1730
01:04:18,077 --> 01:04:19,179
NOOR:
Okay.

1731
01:04:22,349 --> 01:04:25,219
"Any child born pursuant
to the conduct

1732
01:04:25,251 --> 01:04:28,087
contemplated by this agreement
shall be morally, ethically,

1733
01:04:28,121 --> 01:04:30,324
legally, contractually,
and otherwise the child

1734
01:04:30,356 --> 01:04:33,326
of the genetic father
for all purposes,

1735
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,163
the surrogate agrees to sign
all necessary affidavits,

1736
01:04:36,195 --> 01:04:37,130
consents, and/or waivers,

1737
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:39,633
and to attend
all necessary court hearings

1738
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:41,501
to establish the genetic father's
parenthood to their prior...

1739
01:04:41,534 --> 01:04:42,568
Okay. Okay, okay,
I get it.

1740
01:04:42,601 --> 01:04:45,338
You made your point, Noor, okay?

1741
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:48,641
This doesn't sound like
a formality between friends.

1742
01:04:48,675 --> 01:04:51,745
This sounds like someone who is
absolutely legally capable

1743
01:04:51,777 --> 01:04:54,380
of preventing you
from seeing this baby forever

1744
01:04:54,414 --> 01:04:55,215
if he wants to.

1745
01:04:55,248 --> 01:04:56,450
No.

1746
01:04:56,483 --> 01:04:58,818
No, he would
never do something like that.

1747
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:01,254
I'm not judging, Milo.

1748
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:04,458
These are reasonable questions
to ask.

1749
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:05,793
I don't even know
what he looks like.

1750
01:05:05,826 --> 01:05:07,327
Uh, it's not
like you introduced us

1751
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,428
to your sperm donor.

1752
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,330
I also didn't drink whiskey
at his fucking house.

1753
01:05:11,364 --> 01:05:13,099
(Sighs)

1754
01:05:13,132 --> 01:05:15,068
Okay, look, I know how hard
it was for you to get pregnant

1755
01:05:15,101 --> 01:05:16,369
and now I'm doing that
for someone else

1756
01:05:16,402 --> 01:05:17,670
in your position.

1757
01:05:17,704 --> 01:05:19,673
I just feel like can't you just
like be... be...

1758
01:05:19,706 --> 01:05:21,575
What?

1759
01:05:21,608 --> 01:05:23,243
Grateful?

1760
01:05:23,275 --> 01:05:24,811
Were you gonna say "grateful"
to you?

1761
01:05:24,844 --> 01:05:27,246
Like on behalf
of the gay community?

1762
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,349
Yeah, we'll get your key
to Fire Island

1763
01:05:29,382 --> 01:05:30,550
as soon as possible.

1764
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:32,385
Why are you being
such a shithead to me?

1765
01:05:32,418 --> 01:05:35,121
Because you are
incapable of listening

1766
01:05:35,155 --> 01:05:37,557
unless you're told exactly
what you wanna hear.

1767
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,157
KJ told me not to do this
and I still...

1768
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:40,794
Oh my God.

1769
01:05:40,827 --> 01:05:42,529
What?

1770
01:05:42,561 --> 01:05:44,163
You're a fucking lawyer, dude.

1771
01:05:44,197 --> 01:05:45,833
It dr... it... honestly,
it drives me insane

1772
01:05:45,865 --> 01:05:47,733
when you act
like some diffident housewife.

1773
01:05:47,766 --> 01:05:49,435
Like... like if KJ were a dude,

1774
01:05:49,469 --> 01:05:51,472
she would be the picture
of an overbearing boyfriend.

1775
01:05:51,505 --> 01:05:53,474
Like your wife
let you do your actual job.

1776
01:05:53,507 --> 01:05:54,740
I'm sorry welcome
to the 21st fucking century.

1777
01:05:54,773 --> 01:05:57,743
She didn't let me do anything.

1778
01:05:57,777 --> 01:05:59,780
- Marriage is a partnership.
- Hmm.

1779
01:05:59,813 --> 01:06:01,748
Yes, I run major decisions
by my wife.

1780
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:02,748
Oh, oh, cool.

1781
01:06:02,782 --> 01:06:04,117
I had no idea

1782
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:04,984
that giving your best friend
legal advice

1783
01:06:05,018 --> 01:06:07,153
constituted
as a major life decision.

1784
01:06:07,186 --> 01:06:08,454
It shouldn't be,

1785
01:06:08,487 --> 01:06:11,424
but you always end up
mental gymnasticsing me

1786
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:12,659
and it's fucking exhausting,
Milo!

1787
01:06:12,692 --> 01:06:14,193
Yes, because one minute

1788
01:06:14,226 --> 01:06:15,528
you're the moral authority
of the world...

1789
01:06:15,561 --> 01:06:16,896
Oh!

1790
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:17,864
MILO: And the next you're
the fucking victim.

1791
01:06:17,898 --> 01:06:20,534
Yeah, that's called
"having a conscience"!

1792
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:21,434
(Scoffs)

1793
01:06:21,467 --> 01:06:23,870
Okay.

1794
01:06:23,903 --> 01:06:25,806
You know how when you ask people
about their childhood friends

1795
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:26,974
and they're always like,
"You know,

1796
01:06:27,007 --> 01:06:29,476
if we met each other now,
we just we'd never be friends,

1797
01:06:29,509 --> 01:06:31,811
but we've known each other
for so long."

1798
01:06:31,844 --> 01:06:33,713
Noor, I never thought
that was us, but...

1799
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:38,784
(Door opening)

1800
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:41,455
No, 'cause I think cacti
is plural for cactus.

1801
01:06:41,487 --> 01:06:42,355
TEDDY:
Ooh.

1802
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:43,856
(Chuckling)

1803
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:45,025
- Oh, that's a good one.
- Oh, no, no, we're not done yet.

1804
01:06:45,057 --> 01:06:47,161
I'm sorry, guys, I'm just...
I'm not feeling that well.

1805
01:06:47,193 --> 01:06:48,394
I think
I'm just gonna head home.

1806
01:06:48,427 --> 01:06:49,896
(Lilah crying)

1807
01:06:49,929 --> 01:06:50,830
- KJ: Are you okay?
- GEORGE: You haven't even had cake.

1808
01:06:50,864 --> 01:06:52,199
Are you seriously leaving?

1809
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:53,900
Yeah, I am!

1810
01:06:53,934 --> 01:06:55,602
(Grunting)

1811
01:06:55,635 --> 01:06:57,337
We got into an argument
and now she's like running home.

1812
01:06:57,369 --> 01:06:58,203
(Lilah crying)

1813
01:06:58,237 --> 01:06:59,204
Okay,
can we all just keep it down?

1814
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:01,775
I am speaking at
a perfectly reasonable volume!

1815
01:07:01,807 --> 01:07:04,378
It's a baby, fucking Christ,
that's what it does.

1816
01:07:04,411 --> 01:07:06,480
Yeah, I actually had a kid
with the full knowledge

1817
01:07:06,512 --> 01:07:08,215
and understanding
of what a commitment that is.

1818
01:07:08,248 --> 01:07:09,349
Right, yes.

1819
01:07:09,382 --> 01:07:09,916
In retrospect,
I really should have come

1820
01:07:09,949 --> 01:07:12,418
to you for advice KJ.

1821
01:07:12,452 --> 01:07:14,388
You know what, Milo,
you are incapable of listening

1822
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,789
unless you are told exactly
what you wanna hear.

1823
01:07:16,822 --> 01:07:19,192
(Chuckling)

1824
01:07:19,226 --> 01:07:20,928
Do you two just
like sit up at night

1825
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,762
and talk about me
instead of having sex?

1826
01:07:22,795 --> 01:07:23,931
Milo.

1827
01:07:23,963 --> 01:07:25,065
Can you not swear
in front of the baby?

1828
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:26,200
No, no, no, no, I'm s...
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1829
01:07:26,233 --> 01:07:29,202
I shouldn't say "sex"
in front of the fucking baby!

1830
01:07:29,235 --> 01:07:30,003
- NOOR: Let's just go.
- KJ: Alright.

1831
01:07:30,036 --> 01:07:31,270
- Come on, let's just go.
- KJ: Yeah.

1832
01:07:31,304 --> 01:07:31,972
It's not worth it.

1833
01:07:32,005 --> 01:07:33,240
(Lilah crying)

1834
01:07:33,273 --> 01:07:33,874
NOOR:
Wait, you can't push open...

1835
01:07:33,907 --> 01:07:34,942
(Overlapping conversation)

1836
01:07:34,974 --> 01:07:36,509
Definitely, go home
and send me the therapy bill

1837
01:07:36,543 --> 01:07:37,844
in 15 years, okay? That's fine.

1838
01:07:37,876 --> 01:07:38,844
(Overlapping conversation)

1839
01:07:38,878 --> 01:07:39,580
Come on. No, no, no.

1840
01:07:39,612 --> 01:07:40,114
Just... yeah.

1841
01:07:40,146 --> 01:07:40,581
(Indistinct speech)

1842
01:07:40,614 --> 01:07:41,581
(Door shutting)

1843
01:07:41,614 --> 01:07:44,650
Okay, but like I'm mostly mad
that I just...

1844
01:07:44,684 --> 01:07:46,853
I feel like I can't have
a single conversation with her

1845
01:07:46,885 --> 01:07:49,456
without like a specter of KJ
just like hanging over.

1846
01:07:49,489 --> 01:07:50,389
You know what I mean?

1847
01:07:50,422 --> 01:07:51,691
Noor loves you.

1848
01:07:51,724 --> 01:07:53,559
Not as much as she loves KJ,
no ma...

1849
01:07:53,592 --> 01:07:55,295
No matter how unreasonable
she's being.

1850
01:07:55,327 --> 01:07:56,630
They're married.

1851
01:07:56,663 --> 01:07:58,498
(Indistinct lyrics
in background)

1852
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:00,266
Sorry, can I have another wine,
please?

1853
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,501
Hey, Milo,

1854
01:08:01,534 --> 01:08:03,237
you know I'm never one
to police a good time,

1855
01:08:03,269 --> 01:08:04,605
but should you maybe slow down?

1856
01:08:04,637 --> 01:08:07,373
George, it's fine.

1857
01:08:07,407 --> 01:08:08,809
Um,
I think if you just apologize,

1858
01:08:08,842 --> 01:08:10,309
it'll probably work itself out.

1859
01:08:10,342 --> 01:08:12,245
- Okay, are you like on her side?
- No, I...

1860
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:15,514
Hey, neither of us
even heard the argument.

1861
01:08:15,547 --> 01:08:18,652
I think she's
just worried about you.

1862
01:08:18,685 --> 01:08:19,920
Do you think she needs to be?

1863
01:08:19,953 --> 01:08:21,455
No, I think it's a little weird

1864
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:23,356
that you're
in this new relationship

1865
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,791
that seems good for you,

1866
01:08:24,823 --> 01:08:25,992
but you spend so much time
with Roger

1867
01:08:26,025 --> 01:08:28,628
and none of us
have even met him.

1868
01:08:28,662 --> 01:08:30,463
Yeah, okay, well,
he's like literally on his way

1869
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:31,331
to come meet us right now,

1870
01:08:31,364 --> 01:08:32,064
so why don't you
take a picture of him

1871
01:08:32,099 --> 01:08:32,865
and just send it to Noor, okay?

1872
01:08:32,899 --> 01:08:36,269
(Indistinct lyrics
in background)

1873
01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:44,544
(Phone ringing)

1874
01:08:44,577 --> 01:08:45,612
ROGER (OS) (On voice mail):
Hi, you've reached Roger.

1875
01:08:45,645 --> 01:08:46,847
I'm not here right now.

1876
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,948
Leave me a message
and I'll get back to you

1877
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:48,881
as soon as I can.

1878
01:08:48,914 --> 01:08:50,283
(Beep)

1879
01:08:50,317 --> 01:08:52,519
Hey, it's me uh, again.

1880
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:54,720
I'm at phoenix and I'm just...

1881
01:08:54,753 --> 01:08:56,355
I'm starting
to get a little worried,

1882
01:08:56,389 --> 01:08:57,457
because it's been
a couple of hours

1883
01:08:57,489 --> 01:08:58,858
and I still haven't
heard from you.

1884
01:08:58,891 --> 01:09:00,027
Um...

1885
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:05,832
And I've been
feeling some cramps,

1886
01:09:05,864 --> 01:09:08,335
and like a few sharper pains
in my sides,

1887
01:09:08,368 --> 01:09:09,803
and I don't know
if it's anything.

1888
01:09:09,836 --> 01:09:11,972
Anyway, yeah, I um...

1889
01:09:14,873 --> 01:09:16,042
...I just wanted
to keep you posted.

1890
01:09:16,076 --> 01:09:18,845
So yeah, you...
you know where to find me.

1891
01:09:18,877 --> 01:09:20,014
Uh...

1892
01:09:21,046 --> 01:09:23,850
(Indistinct lyrics
in background)

1893
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:28,622
(Tap running)

1894
01:09:29,421 --> 01:09:30,657
(Sighing)

1895
01:09:33,025 --> 01:09:33,926
Oh yeah.

1896
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,028
(Indistinct speech)

1897
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,596
(George chuckling)

1898
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,498
- TEDDY: Okay.
- GEORGE: Ooh yeah.

1899
01:09:39,532 --> 01:09:41,335
Hey, are you okay?

1900
01:09:41,368 --> 01:09:42,436
Is everything alright?

1901
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:43,703
What? Oh, yeah.

1902
01:09:43,737 --> 01:09:44,672
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1903
01:09:44,704 --> 01:09:47,106
Um, uh, Roger, this is George,
my roommate,

1904
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,576
and his recurring
Tinder date Teddy.

1905
01:09:49,609 --> 01:09:50,410
It's really good to see you.

1906
01:09:50,443 --> 01:09:52,445
It's been a minute, huh?

1907
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,014
Uh, wait, are you drinking?

1908
01:09:54,046 --> 01:09:54,780
MILO:
I had some wine.

1909
01:09:54,814 --> 01:09:56,048
Yeah, one is fine.

1910
01:09:56,082 --> 01:09:57,117
ROGER:
Alright.

1911
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:58,751
You sure everything's okay?

1912
01:09:58,784 --> 01:10:00,386
GEORGE:
Why wouldn't it be?

1913
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:01,421
Milo said
she was having stomach pains.

1914
01:10:01,454 --> 01:10:02,956
GEORGE: Oh my God,
why didn't you tell me?

1915
01:10:02,988 --> 01:10:04,557
Uh, they passed.

1916
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:05,492
Seriously, I'm fine.

1917
01:10:05,524 --> 01:10:06,425
It... it wasn't a big deal.

1918
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,860
I just... I almost
didn't even mention it.

1919
01:10:07,894 --> 01:10:09,396
It's fine.

1920
01:10:09,429 --> 01:10:11,364
You called me and asked me
to come be with you.

1921
01:10:11,398 --> 01:10:13,766
No, I wasn't like...

1922
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,702
Seriously, I just said that
in passing, okay?

1923
01:10:15,734 --> 01:10:17,603
I... I was just calling to see
if you wanted to come meet us

1924
01:10:17,636 --> 01:10:19,372
for a drink?

1925
01:10:19,405 --> 01:10:22,376
Okay, I'm gonna head back home.

1926
01:10:22,408 --> 01:10:24,143
I'm uh, glad everything's okay.

1927
01:10:24,176 --> 01:10:25,644
No, come on,
you're already here.

1928
01:10:25,677 --> 01:10:28,381
Let me just
buy you a whiskey soda.

1929
01:10:28,414 --> 01:10:29,783
I don't even
have my wallet on me.

1930
01:10:29,815 --> 01:10:31,016
W...

1931
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:33,087
I'll see you at the appointment
next week.

1932
01:10:36,588 --> 01:10:38,725
(Scoffs)

1933
01:10:38,757 --> 01:10:39,893
Sorry.

1934
01:10:39,926 --> 01:10:41,061
I... I really... I... ooh,
I do not know

1935
01:10:41,094 --> 01:10:41,895
what that was about.

1936
01:10:41,927 --> 01:10:43,162
Phew.

1937
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:44,797
Thank God,
men can't get pregnant.

1938
01:10:44,831 --> 01:10:46,166
(Scoffs)

1939
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:49,603
'Cause I mean Jesus the f...
fucking volatility.

1940
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:53,073
I'm gonna call it a night.

1941
01:10:53,105 --> 01:10:54,541
No, wait, George.

1942
01:10:54,573 --> 01:10:55,174
Come on, please stay.

1943
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:56,143
I need to be distracted.

1944
01:10:56,176 --> 01:10:58,512
Hey, George, what is wrong?

1945
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,514
GEROGE:
It's my birthday,

1946
01:11:00,546 --> 01:11:02,715
and this is the first time I've
asked Teddy to come hang out

1947
01:11:02,748 --> 01:11:04,583
with all of us,
and now I feel like he thinks

1948
01:11:04,617 --> 01:11:05,918
I have a crazy dramatic group
of friends.

1949
01:11:05,952 --> 01:11:07,454
This is Noor.

1950
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:09,590
Honestly, I don't really care
whose fault it is.

1951
01:11:12,024 --> 01:11:14,894
(Siren wailing in distance)

1952
01:11:16,195 --> 01:11:17,430
(Milo sighs)

1953
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,002
Hi.

1954
01:11:22,034 --> 01:11:24,904
(Siren wailing in distance)

1955
01:11:27,573 --> 01:11:28,574
(Sighing)

1956
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:36,516
(Rustling)

1957
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:46,460
(Sighing)

1958
01:11:52,631 --> 01:11:55,835
MILO: I really genuinely
feel like five years ago,

1959
01:11:55,868 --> 01:11:57,470
conspiracy theories
were the glue

1960
01:11:57,503 --> 01:11:58,471
that bound us all together

1961
01:11:58,505 --> 01:11:59,538
and now it's like someone's
conspiracy theory

1962
01:11:59,572 --> 01:12:01,208
(Indistinct speech)

1963
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,243
So delicate yet so strong.

1964
01:12:03,275 --> 01:12:05,511
I wish Milo would shut up.

1965
01:12:05,545 --> 01:12:08,081
Hmm.

1966
01:12:08,113 --> 01:12:08,781
MAN 3:
Milo.

1967
01:12:08,814 --> 01:12:09,248
MILO:
(Indistinct speech)

1968
01:12:09,282 --> 01:12:10,250
MAN 3:
Milo.

1969
01:12:10,283 --> 01:12:10,850
And it honestly drives me crazy
like every...

1970
01:12:10,884 --> 01:12:11,283
- MAN 3: Milo.
- What?

1971
01:12:11,317 --> 01:12:12,018
Could you just...

1972
01:12:12,051 --> 01:12:14,554
Could you just please be quiet?

1973
01:12:14,587 --> 01:12:16,690
Yeah, it's becoming
increasingly difficult

1974
01:12:16,722 --> 01:12:18,725
just to sit here
and enjoy the music.

1975
01:12:18,757 --> 01:12:19,925
Oh, I'm sorry.

1976
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:21,060
You mean you...
oh, you want me to be quiet

1977
01:12:21,094 --> 01:12:22,229
like um, this?

1978
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:23,697
Just like sit here, quiet.

1979
01:12:23,729 --> 01:12:25,564
(Chuckling)

1980
01:12:25,597 --> 01:12:29,269
It's just that for once we have
a talented semi-famous musician

1981
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:30,804
playing an instrument,

1982
01:12:30,837 --> 01:12:35,141
whereas we get to listen
to you talk for hours on end

1983
01:12:35,173 --> 01:12:37,511
literally every day.

1984
01:12:37,543 --> 01:12:40,747
Um, hi, hello, yes, I... I'm um,
I'm a musician, too.

1985
01:12:40,779 --> 01:12:41,980
(Chuckling)

1986
01:12:42,015 --> 01:12:46,920
Yeah, but thing is like you're
not really though, are you?

1987
01:12:46,953 --> 01:12:48,688
Yeah,
you haven't played an open mic

1988
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,656
since you started working here,
so...

1989
01:12:50,689 --> 01:12:52,826
(Clears throat)

1990
01:12:52,859 --> 01:12:54,261
Hey,
some of my friends are playing

1991
01:12:54,293 --> 01:12:56,262
at the Knitting Factory tonight
if you wanna come?

1992
01:12:56,296 --> 01:12:56,997
I think you'd like them.

1993
01:12:57,029 --> 01:12:58,498
- The Knitting Factory.
- Got it.

1994
01:13:05,704 --> 01:13:07,039
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what?

1995
01:13:07,073 --> 01:13:08,208
Tonight.

1996
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,676
You wanna come to a show
with me?

1997
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:11,944
Uh, no, I can't, I can't.

1998
01:13:11,978 --> 01:13:13,747
I'm... I'm doing something
with Roger.

1999
01:13:13,779 --> 01:13:16,015
I'm sorry, but we're on
for Saturday, yeah?

2000
01:13:16,048 --> 01:13:17,317
Yeah, sure.

2001
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:18,084
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

2002
01:13:18,117 --> 01:13:18,985
(Kissing)

2003
01:13:19,018 --> 01:13:19,519
MAN 3:
Uh...

2004
01:13:19,551 --> 01:13:20,520
(Man clears throat)

2005
01:13:22,354 --> 01:13:24,290
(Blowing kisses)

2006
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:25,992
(Grunting)

2007
01:13:26,024 --> 01:13:26,726
That's mine, too.

2008
01:13:27,827 --> 01:13:28,795
MAN 4:
Bye.

2009
01:13:28,828 --> 01:13:30,130
MAN 3: The Knitting
Factory tonight, man.

2010
01:13:30,162 --> 01:13:31,097
MAN 2:
The Knitting Factory.

2011
01:13:31,131 --> 01:13:32,231
The Knitting Factory,
I didn't get a kiss.

2012
01:13:32,265 --> 01:13:33,967
Nope.

2013
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,702
(Traffic honking
and whooshing in distance)

2014
01:13:35,734 --> 01:13:38,604
(Dog barking in distance)

2015
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:52,185
(Bell buzzing)

2016
01:13:58,757 --> 01:14:00,193
Milo, what are you doing here?

2017
01:14:00,225 --> 01:14:02,127
I was just uh, stopping by
on my way home from work.

2018
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:02,994
I wanted to ask you about the...

2019
01:14:03,029 --> 01:14:04,864
Yeah, now is not a good time,
so...

2020
01:14:04,896 --> 01:14:05,332
Hi.

2021
01:14:05,364 --> 01:14:05,765
Hi.

2022
01:14:05,798 --> 01:14:06,733
(Roger chuckles)

2023
01:14:06,765 --> 01:14:07,634
I'm Ken.

2024
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:08,602
(Chuckles)

2025
01:14:08,635 --> 01:14:09,703
Hi.

2026
01:14:09,735 --> 01:14:12,171
ROGER:
Uh, Ken, uh, this is Milo.

2027
01:14:12,204 --> 01:14:13,073
You're Milo.

2028
01:14:13,105 --> 01:14:13,672
MILO:
Yeah.

2029
01:14:13,707 --> 01:14:17,043
It is nice to meet you.

2030
01:14:17,076 --> 01:14:19,244
Ken, I'm... I'm really...
I'm sorry to crash the party.

2031
01:14:19,278 --> 01:14:21,715
I d... I didn't... I didn't know
you had anyone over.

2032
01:14:21,747 --> 01:14:22,848
KEN: I hope you don't
think it's weird,

2033
01:14:22,882 --> 01:14:25,784
but I just wanna tell you
it is such a wonderful thing

2034
01:14:25,818 --> 01:14:27,119
that you're doing.

2035
01:14:27,153 --> 01:14:28,387
You know, all the dads
in our group were so touched

2036
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:30,222
when we heard the story.

2037
01:14:30,256 --> 01:14:32,292
Oh, you're...
you're in the dad group, too?

2038
01:14:32,324 --> 01:14:33,393
Uh, that... that's awesome.

2039
01:14:33,426 --> 01:14:33,927
Do you have kids?

2040
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,395
Yeah, Lyla, she's 4.

2041
01:14:36,429 --> 01:14:39,032
Uh, I can't believe
I haven't met you yet.

2042
01:14:39,064 --> 01:14:40,799
Have you been
to any of Roger's shows?

2043
01:14:40,832 --> 01:14:42,134
Not yet,

2044
01:14:42,167 --> 01:14:44,003
but I hear he's
the belle of the ball, though.

2045
01:14:44,037 --> 01:14:45,704
He is, you should come sometime.

2046
01:14:45,738 --> 01:14:46,506
Uh, we could sit together

2047
01:14:46,538 --> 01:14:48,007
and we'd get you
a sunset surprise.

2048
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:50,176
Yeah, I'm...
I'm not on this week,

2049
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:52,045
but um, maybe sometime.

2050
01:14:52,078 --> 01:14:53,880
Sure.

2051
01:14:53,912 --> 01:14:55,214
(Dogs barking in distance)

2052
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:57,082
Well, I... I'd offer you
a glass of wine, but...

2053
01:14:57,115 --> 01:14:57,817
(Chuckling)

2054
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:58,651
Yeah, that's fine, that's fine.

2055
01:14:58,684 --> 01:15:00,686
Um, I'm seeing Milo
later this week.

2056
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,122
I'll uh, Milo, let me...
let me walk you down.

2057
01:15:04,256 --> 01:15:06,058
It's uh, nice to meet you, Ken.

2058
01:15:11,396 --> 01:15:13,099
I had no idea you were
seeing someone.

2059
01:15:13,131 --> 01:15:14,967
Yeah, I have been for a while.

2060
01:15:15,001 --> 01:15:16,036
Why didn't you say anything?

2061
01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:18,038
ROGER: Because it just
didn't seem relevant.

2062
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:19,439
Relevant to... to what?

2063
01:15:19,471 --> 01:15:23,777
Milo, you need to text me
before you come over.

2064
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,278
You know if anything's happening
with the baby,

2065
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:27,746
I'm here day or night.

2066
01:15:27,779 --> 01:15:30,315
Otherwise, we need to
start setting some boundaries.

2067
01:15:30,349 --> 01:15:31,317
Okay.

2068
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,353
Alright. So what um...

2069
01:15:33,386 --> 01:15:35,955
What are our boundaries then,
Roger?

2070
01:15:35,988 --> 01:15:37,923
I'll honestly feel better
about our boundaries

2071
01:15:37,957 --> 01:15:40,060
when you return the contract.

2072
01:15:40,092 --> 01:15:42,929
Okay, I... I mean I... I just...

2073
01:15:42,962 --> 01:15:44,030
I saw
that you were home tonight,

2074
01:15:44,063 --> 01:15:46,399
so I figured I'd stop by
on my walk home.

2075
01:15:46,431 --> 01:15:47,300
ROGER:
How'd you even know I was home?

2076
01:15:47,332 --> 01:15:48,967
You posted a picture.

2077
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:50,170
Okay, this...
this is what I'm talking about.

2078
01:15:50,203 --> 01:15:51,171
(Scoffs)

2079
01:15:51,203 --> 01:15:51,970
I should be able
to post something

2080
01:15:52,003 --> 01:15:53,273
on a personal account

2081
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:55,774
without you taking it
as an open invitation

2082
01:15:55,807 --> 01:15:56,809
to drop in
whenever you feel like it,

2083
01:15:56,842 --> 01:15:57,943
like it's an episode of Friends
or something.

2084
01:15:57,976 --> 01:15:59,078
It's a public account.

2085
01:15:59,112 --> 01:16:01,081
I didn't like pay someone

2086
01:16:01,113 --> 01:16:02,881
to track down
your social security number

2087
01:16:02,914 --> 01:16:04,717
and your mother's maiden name
for me.

2088
01:16:04,751 --> 01:16:06,052
No,
but you are taking photos of me

2089
01:16:06,085 --> 01:16:06,752
through my window.

2090
01:16:06,786 --> 01:16:07,386
That was a joke.

2091
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,822
It was weird, Milo!

2092
01:16:08,854 --> 01:16:10,222
It made me feel weird.

2093
01:16:10,256 --> 01:16:12,792
And then, the whole telling me
you had stomach pains

2094
01:16:12,824 --> 01:16:14,461
to get me to go hang out
with you at a bar!

2095
01:16:14,493 --> 01:16:16,996
My stomach did feel weird,
Roger, okay?

2096
01:16:17,029 --> 01:16:19,199
I... I mean I'm not like insane.

2097
01:16:19,231 --> 01:16:20,432
You're making me sound
like I'm insane

2098
01:16:20,466 --> 01:16:23,403
or like I'm stalking you
or something.

2099
01:16:23,435 --> 01:16:26,773
You know how wonderful
I think you are.

2100
01:16:26,805 --> 01:16:30,275
I am so fucking excited
that this kid is gonna

2101
01:16:30,309 --> 01:16:32,811
have your awesome genes.

2102
01:16:32,845 --> 01:16:35,148
If she's half as badass as you,
she's gonna do okay

2103
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,048
in this insane difficult world.

2104
01:16:36,082 --> 01:16:39,252
She?

2105
01:16:39,284 --> 01:16:40,819
Shit.

2106
01:16:40,853 --> 01:16:41,855
- You said that you didn't find out.
- ROGER: Shit.

2107
01:16:41,887 --> 01:16:42,387
Milo, I'm sorry.

2108
01:16:42,421 --> 01:16:43,021
I w...

2109
01:16:43,055 --> 01:16:43,957
(Sighs)

2110
01:16:43,989 --> 01:16:46,391
I wanted to know.

2111
01:16:46,425 --> 01:16:48,328
I just... like I really...
I really fucking wanted

2112
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,130
to keep this one thing
for myself.

2113
01:16:51,863 --> 01:16:52,831
I'm sorry I told you.

2114
01:16:52,864 --> 01:16:55,501
It... it was shitty,
but it was an accident.

2115
01:16:55,534 --> 01:16:59,905
I'm not sorry for wanting
to know the gender of my child.

2116
01:16:59,939 --> 01:17:02,809
I've been waiting for this
for 20 years!

2117
01:17:02,841 --> 01:17:04,943
Right, so I'm... I'm...
I'm just your surrogate.

2118
01:17:04,976 --> 01:17:06,845
(Chuckling)

2119
01:17:06,878 --> 01:17:09,448
Is that the way you talk
about me in your dad group?

2120
01:17:09,481 --> 01:17:11,451
No.

2121
01:17:11,484 --> 01:17:13,486
I just need you
to let me figure out

2122
01:17:13,519 --> 01:17:15,989
how to be a dad on my own.

2123
01:17:20,525 --> 01:17:23,095
(Gate squeaking and shutting)

2124
01:17:25,931 --> 01:17:26,431
(Dogs barking in distance)

2125
01:17:26,465 --> 01:17:29,402
(Shower running)

2126
01:17:38,043 --> 01:17:39,813
(Grunts)

2127
01:17:39,845 --> 01:17:42,147
Hey, um, do you wanna...
do you wanna go

2128
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:45,150
to Rogers um, show
at Thigh High tonight just...

2129
01:17:45,184 --> 01:17:47,320
Just the two of us?

2130
01:17:47,353 --> 01:17:50,088
GEORGE: Um, I'm supposed to
spend the night at Teddy's,

2131
01:17:50,122 --> 01:17:53,927
but yeah, I'm down.

2132
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,128
Tinder Teddy still?

2133
01:17:56,162 --> 01:17:57,864
GEORGE:
Yeah, it's been like six months.

2134
01:17:57,896 --> 01:18:01,835
George, are you mad at me?

2135
01:18:01,868 --> 01:18:03,837
No, just naked.

2136
01:18:09,341 --> 01:18:10,175
Are you done yet?

2137
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,345
Uh, yeah, sorry, shit.

2138
01:18:12,377 --> 01:18:14,113
Uh, okay.

2139
01:18:16,414 --> 01:18:17,951
Whoops.

2140
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:19,319
(Toilet flushing)

2141
01:18:19,351 --> 01:18:20,420
- GEORGE: Don't flush the toi...
- Sorry, shit, sorry!

2142
01:18:24,489 --> 01:18:27,860
Ooh, I am sure your daddy
will be able to teach you

2143
01:18:27,894 --> 01:18:30,197
to do makeup
much better than I can.

2144
01:18:33,298 --> 01:18:35,034
(Phone ringing)

2145
01:18:36,569 --> 01:18:38,204
- Hi.
- CAMERON: (On the phone) Hey.

2146
01:18:38,237 --> 01:18:39,137
What's up?

2147
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:40,939
There should be a special place
in hell

2148
01:18:40,972 --> 01:18:42,542
for people
who organize supermarkets.

2149
01:18:42,574 --> 01:18:44,476
Oh no!

2150
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:45,445
Yeah, you're welcome,

2151
01:18:45,478 --> 01:18:47,547
I'm makin' you
a goddamn stuffed artichoke.

2152
01:18:50,181 --> 01:18:52,484
Um, you're gonna kill me.

2153
01:18:52,518 --> 01:18:54,453
CAMERON: (On the phone) If you tell me
I'm only making one stuffed artichoke.

2154
01:18:54,487 --> 01:18:55,520
Yeah, I might.

2155
01:18:55,554 --> 01:18:57,190
I totally forgot.

2156
01:18:57,789 --> 01:18:58,957
Did you make other plans?

2157
01:18:58,990 --> 01:18:59,824
MILO: (On the phone)
No.

2158
01:18:59,859 --> 01:19:01,995
No, no, no,
Roger has a show tonight,

2159
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:04,396
and we had a really weird night
this week,

2160
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:07,233
and I wanna go, and try,
and sort things over.

2161
01:19:07,265 --> 01:19:09,469
Please, please, please, please,
come and then you know,

2162
01:19:09,502 --> 01:19:11,571
we can go back to your place
right after.

2163
01:19:11,604 --> 01:19:13,472
We planned this like a week ago.

2164
01:19:13,506 --> 01:19:15,173
MILO: (On the phone)
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

2165
01:19:15,207 --> 01:19:19,112
I... I'll be in and out,
I promise.

2166
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:20,980
I'll give you a head.

2167
01:19:21,012 --> 01:19:23,248
Don't try to negotiate sex
for food.

2168
01:19:23,282 --> 01:19:24,583
(Chuckling)

2169
01:19:24,617 --> 01:19:26,185
Okay, uh, meet me there.

2170
01:19:26,217 --> 01:19:27,653
I'll text you the address.

2171
01:19:27,686 --> 01:19:28,320
Bye.

2172
01:19:28,354 --> 01:19:29,288
MILO: (On the phone)
Bye.

2173
01:19:35,493 --> 01:19:36,561
Shit.

2174
01:19:36,595 --> 01:19:39,499
(Indistinct chatter)

2175
01:19:46,738 --> 01:19:47,940
GEORGE:
Did you invite Cameron?

2176
01:19:47,974 --> 01:19:49,342
Yeah.

2177
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:51,077
Sorry, I forgot we were supposed
to have date night,

2178
01:19:51,109 --> 01:19:53,313
so I told him
to come meet us here.

2179
01:19:53,345 --> 01:19:54,413
Okay, I'm gonna get a drink.

2180
01:19:54,447 --> 01:19:55,382
Okay.

2181
01:19:59,518 --> 01:20:00,586
Hello.

2182
01:20:00,618 --> 01:20:01,954
- Hey.
- Hi.

2183
01:20:01,988 --> 01:20:03,088
- How are you?
- Good, good, good.

2184
01:20:03,122 --> 01:20:04,390
Uh, let's go get seats.

2185
01:20:04,422 --> 01:20:06,192
(Indistinct lyrics
in background)

2186
01:20:06,225 --> 01:20:07,193
Milo.

2187
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:08,560
Jesus, hi!

2188
01:20:08,594 --> 01:20:09,529
Does Roger know you're here?

2189
01:20:09,561 --> 01:20:10,395
Uh, no, no, no,

2190
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:12,164
I didn't even know
he was performing.

2191
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:12,832
Hey, come.

2192
01:20:12,865 --> 01:20:13,733
Come, come, sit at the bar.

2193
01:20:13,765 --> 01:20:14,533
No, no, no,
we're gonna go find seats.

2194
01:20:14,567 --> 01:20:18,003
(Indistinct lyrics
in background)

2195
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,109
Never been
to a drag show before.

2196
01:20:24,143 --> 01:20:25,578
Yes, why is that?

2197
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:28,515
(Indistinct speech)

2198
01:20:30,149 --> 01:20:31,284
No, I don't know.

2199
01:20:31,317 --> 01:20:33,019
I just... like you're like
you did some work

2200
01:20:33,051 --> 01:20:35,220
and they let you... give you
a rogue strap

2201
01:20:35,253 --> 01:20:37,390
and take you to a drag show.

2202
01:20:37,422 --> 01:20:39,091
I must have missed
that day of orientation.

2203
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,259
Sucks to be you.

2204
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:43,129
(Indistinct lyrics
in background)

2205
01:20:45,331 --> 01:20:48,168
(Audience cheering
and applauding)

2206
01:20:56,274 --> 01:20:58,478
Fun little fact for y'all.

2207
01:20:58,511 --> 01:21:01,647
Suppository
is actually my drag auntie

2208
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,048
and I don't know

2209
01:21:03,082 --> 01:21:05,084
if you're allowed
to fuck your drag aunt,

2210
01:21:05,117 --> 01:21:08,287
but if Game of Thrones
tells us anything,

2211
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:12,090
and it does, it's yes, mama!

2212
01:21:12,123 --> 01:21:13,358
(Audience laughing)

2213
01:21:13,391 --> 01:21:14,460
Ooh!

2214
01:21:14,493 --> 01:21:15,361
(Audience cheering
and applauding)

2215
01:21:15,394 --> 01:21:19,332
Next up
is my personal favorite DILTF

2216
01:21:19,364 --> 01:21:21,134
that stands for "Daddy,
I'd like to find

2217
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,535
an amazing family therapist

2218
01:21:22,568 --> 01:21:24,404
to work through
our deep-seated issues with."

2219
01:21:24,436 --> 01:21:25,537
(Audience laughing)

2220
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:28,440
Angela Merkin!

2221
01:21:28,474 --> 01:21:31,077
(Audience cheering
and applauding)

2222
01:21:31,109 --> 01:21:32,744
Hello, hello, guys and dolls,

2223
01:21:32,778 --> 01:21:35,213
I've been reading
a lot of baby books lately

2224
01:21:35,247 --> 01:21:39,118
and they all tell me that
gender is a social construct

2225
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:40,787
and that all of us
should be playing with dolls,

2226
01:21:40,819 --> 01:21:42,788
so apparently,
I am the modern picture

2227
01:21:42,822 --> 01:21:44,056
of the perfect parent.

2228
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:44,657
Wooh!

2229
01:21:44,689 --> 01:21:46,224
(Audience laughing)

2230
01:21:46,257 --> 01:21:47,025
ROGER: Yes,
I'm sure your mother's very proud.

2231
01:21:47,059 --> 01:21:49,162
(Audience laughing
and whistling)

2232
01:21:49,194 --> 01:21:51,130
This one goes out
to all the daddies out there,

2233
01:21:51,162 --> 01:21:54,733
but it is dedicated
to one very special daddy,

2234
01:21:54,766 --> 01:21:55,734
my Kenny.

2235
01:21:55,768 --> 01:21:56,702
AUDIENCE:
Aw!

2236
01:21:56,734 --> 01:21:58,070
(Blowing a kiss)

2237
01:21:59,738 --> 01:22:00,606
ROGER:
Hit it, Sam.

2238
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:03,543
(Audience cheering)

2239
01:22:10,582 --> 01:22:13,752
♪ Somebody said
you got a new friend ♪

2240
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:18,690
(Music playing in background)

2241
01:22:20,859 --> 01:22:23,261
That was some show.

2242
01:22:23,295 --> 01:22:24,730
Uh, yeah, he's great, right?

2243
01:22:24,762 --> 01:22:26,364
GEORGE: Milo,
can I talk to you a second?

2244
01:22:26,398 --> 01:22:27,634
Yep.

2245
01:22:30,235 --> 01:22:32,371
Did you not tell Roger
we were comin' here tonight?

2246
01:22:32,404 --> 01:22:33,873
MILO:
Ugh, chill, George, it's fine.

2247
01:22:33,905 --> 01:22:34,539
Are you okay?

2248
01:22:34,573 --> 01:22:35,207
Yes!

2249
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,275
Like are you actually okay?

2250
01:22:37,309 --> 01:22:39,412
Because this is all startin'
to get really weird

2251
01:22:39,444 --> 01:22:41,179
and you're bein'
like a little manic.

2252
01:22:41,212 --> 01:22:42,114
(Scoffs)

2253
01:22:42,148 --> 01:22:43,181
Okay, yeah, let's uh,

2254
01:22:43,215 --> 01:22:44,182
let's all remember
which one of us

2255
01:22:44,216 --> 01:22:46,586
is medicated for that.

2256
01:22:46,618 --> 01:22:47,719
Wow.

2257
01:22:49,387 --> 01:22:51,423
If you wanna light yourself
on fire, Milo,

2258
01:22:51,457 --> 01:22:54,727
that's up to you,
but I'm not gonna stand here

2259
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,130
and burn up next to you.

2260
01:22:57,162 --> 01:22:59,865
Is that like a little... little
therapy tidbit you filed away?

2261
01:22:59,899 --> 01:23:01,467
I'm sorry for
not taking relationship advice

2262
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,667
from someone
who has literally cheated

2263
01:23:02,701 --> 01:23:04,537
on every person he's been with.

2264
01:23:11,644 --> 01:23:12,211
You okay?

2265
01:23:12,244 --> 01:23:13,845
MILO:
Yes, I'm fine.

2266
01:23:13,878 --> 01:23:15,314
You don't have to stay here.

2267
01:23:15,346 --> 01:23:16,547
You're supposed
to go to my place tonight.

2268
01:23:16,582 --> 01:23:18,317
MILO: I know, I...
it's important that I talk to Roger.

2269
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:19,819
- What?
- What are you doing here?

2270
01:23:19,851 --> 01:23:21,153
MILO:
Stopping by the performance

2271
01:23:21,186 --> 01:23:22,622
that wasn't happening
this weekend.

2272
01:23:22,654 --> 01:23:23,456
ROGER:
What are you talking about?

2273
01:23:23,488 --> 01:23:25,423
Last week,
when I was at your house,

2274
01:23:25,457 --> 01:23:27,226
you told me
that you weren't on tonight.

2275
01:23:27,259 --> 01:23:29,595
I am allowed to have a life
that doesn't involve you.

2276
01:23:29,627 --> 01:23:30,795
Oh, okay.

2277
01:23:30,828 --> 01:23:31,929
I'm just... I'm just tryin'
to figure out

2278
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:34,266
how we went from taking shots
in your dressing room

2279
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,302
to arguing on a street corner.

2280
01:23:36,335 --> 01:23:39,172
We... we were... no, we were fine
like... like a month ago.

2281
01:23:39,204 --> 01:23:41,407
This is not the life I want
for my kid.

2282
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:43,408
(Sighs)

2283
01:23:43,442 --> 01:23:46,645
This is a check for $13,000.

2284
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:47,779
It's most of my savings.

2285
01:23:47,813 --> 01:23:49,248
I'm gonna be very clear.

2286
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:49,916
This is a transaction.

2287
01:23:49,948 --> 01:23:50,582
No.

2288
01:23:50,617 --> 01:23:52,284
No, it is what I say it is.

2289
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:53,753
I'm fucking pregnant.

2290
01:23:53,786 --> 01:23:56,655
Roger, you... you manipulated me
into thinking

2291
01:23:56,689 --> 01:23:58,191
that we were friends.

2292
01:23:58,224 --> 01:24:00,626
Is this what a friendship
looks like to you?

2293
01:24:00,658 --> 01:24:01,460
Do what you want with that.

2294
01:24:01,493 --> 01:24:03,629
Deposit it or don't,
I don't care,

2295
01:24:03,662 --> 01:24:06,199
but you better return
those papers signed

2296
01:24:06,231 --> 01:24:07,432
by the end of next week

2297
01:24:07,466 --> 01:24:09,536
or I will make it
a fucking problem for you.

2298
01:24:19,877 --> 01:24:22,547
Uh, I think you should go
to your own place tonight.

2299
01:24:22,581 --> 01:24:23,716
Are you serious?

2300
01:24:23,748 --> 01:24:25,451
Because of Roger?

2301
01:24:25,484 --> 01:24:27,620
No, Milo, because of you.

2302
01:24:27,653 --> 01:24:28,454
You keep blowin' me off
for someone

2303
01:24:28,487 --> 01:24:30,456
who clearly
doesn't want you around.

2304
01:24:30,488 --> 01:24:32,692
It is a really,
really complicated situation.

2305
01:24:32,725 --> 01:24:34,527
I don't doubt that.

2306
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,796
But whether you
keep misrepresenting it to me,

2307
01:24:36,828 --> 01:24:38,463
yourself or both.

2308
01:24:38,497 --> 01:24:39,731
Cameron, will you please just
like chill for five minutes?

2309
01:24:39,765 --> 01:24:40,967
I'll see you.

2310
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,577
(Milo sighing)

2311
01:24:52,411 --> 01:24:55,315
(Phone ringing)

2312
01:25:00,586 --> 01:25:01,721
NOOR: (On voice mail)
Hey, it's Noor.

2313
01:25:01,753 --> 01:25:03,288
Leave me a message,
I'll call you back.

2314
01:25:05,858 --> 01:25:06,726
(Phone ringing)

2315
01:25:06,759 --> 01:25:07,659
NOOR: (On voice mail)
Hey, it's Noor.

2316
01:25:07,693 --> 01:25:09,427
Leave me a message,
I'll call you back.

2317
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:09,862
(Beep)

2318
01:25:09,895 --> 01:25:10,863
Hey, it's me.

2319
01:25:10,895 --> 01:25:11,596
Um...

2320
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:12,632
(Sighs)

2321
01:25:12,664 --> 01:25:13,532
Please, call me.

2322
01:25:13,564 --> 01:25:14,833
I'm really sorry.

2323
01:25:14,867 --> 01:25:15,835
I know that I was out of line
the other night

2324
01:25:15,868 --> 01:25:18,638
and I'm... I'm sorry, Noor.

2325
01:25:18,671 --> 01:25:19,972
I really...

2326
01:25:20,005 --> 01:25:22,807
I really, really need you,
please call me back.

2327
01:25:22,841 --> 01:25:24,677

Hi.

I... I promise I'm not...
I'm not tryin' to trap you.

2347
01:27:35,573 --> 01:27:37,108
Just drinking
with my name sake?

01:27:37,141 --> 01:27:39,578
Oh, yeah, yeah,
he does okay in a pinch.

01:27:45,951 --> 01:27:47,787
I think you're feeling
like I've been an asshole

2352
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:50,088
who is completely preoccupied
with my own life

2353
01:27:50,122 --> 01:27:53,626
and I am feeling
like I have been an asshole

2354
01:27:53,658 --> 01:27:55,862
who is completely preoccupied
with my own life.

2355
01:27:58,831 --> 01:28:00,132
You see, I can do therapy, too.

2356
01:28:00,164 --> 01:28:01,768
(Sighs)

2357
01:28:03,801 --> 01:28:06,639
I printed out a list of um,
of all the questions

2358
01:28:06,671 --> 01:28:08,773
I wish I had asked you
over the past seven months.

2359
01:28:08,806 --> 01:28:09,775
Please sit.

2360
01:28:12,176 --> 01:28:15,113
(Pouring)

2361
01:28:17,515 --> 01:28:18,750
Good.

2362
01:28:20,618 --> 01:28:22,720
How's the sex with Teddy?

2363
01:28:22,753 --> 01:28:24,756
Our DM says it's fantastic.

2364
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:25,791
Huh-huh.

2365
01:28:25,823 --> 01:28:27,460
If you could be
any dessert wine,

2366
01:28:27,493 --> 01:28:28,894
which one would you be?

2367
01:28:28,926 --> 01:28:30,762
Dessert wine is for people
who don't value themselves.

2368
01:28:30,796 --> 01:28:31,931
Correct.

2369
01:28:31,963 --> 01:28:33,097
How's your head?

2370
01:28:33,131 --> 01:28:35,968
No complaints.

2371
01:28:36,001 --> 01:28:38,003
How many times have you sharted
since last week?

2372
01:28:38,036 --> 01:28:39,805
On purpose or by mistake?

2373
01:28:39,837 --> 01:28:42,207

2379
01:28:56,889 --> 01:28:59,891
"I have heard
what the talkers were talking,

2380
01:28:59,925 --> 01:29:03,028
the talk of the beginning
and the end.

2381
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,230
There was
never any more inception

2382
01:29:05,264 --> 01:29:06,966
than there is now,

2383
01:29:06,998 --> 01:29:10,635

than there is now."

MILO:
Are you ready for this?

2390
01:29:21,779 --> 01:29:23,248
Gotta seduce your man.

2391
01:29:24,815 --> 01:29:25,850
Hey!

Oh, that's when you were sick.

2395
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:35,260
Yeah.

2396
01:29:35,293 --> 01:29:36,194
(Chuckling)

2397
01:29:36,228 --> 01:29:37,663

01:29:44,136 --> 01:29:45,104
MILO:
Hi.

2400
01:29:45,136 --> 01:29:47,139
Um, hello.

2401
01:29:47,171 --> 01:29:50,742
As many of you may know
from never seeing me before

2402
01:29:50,775 --> 01:29:53,979
uh, I don't usually
do stuff like this,

2403
01:29:54,011 --> 01:30:01,119
but um, I'm trying these days
to try I guess, so yeah.

2404
01:30:01,153 --> 01:30:03,588
This is an original song
called "Milk water".

2405
01:30:03,622 --> 01:30:05,224
Oh, uh, and thank you to Matt.

2406
01:30:05,256 --> 01:30:07,759
Very special thanks to Matt
for letting me play here tonight

2407
01:30:07,792 --> 01:30:09,260
and for conceding
that at least if I suck,

2408
01:30:09,293 --> 01:30:10,895
you guys will all
probably drink more.

2409
01:30:10,929 --> 01:30:11,963
(Chuckling)

2410
01:30:11,997 --> 01:30:14,901
(Strumming glass)

2411
01:30:22,873 --> 01:30:25,010
Uh, just a glass of vodka
for you.

2412
01:30:25,042 --> 01:30:25,743
Uh.

2413
01:30:25,777 --> 01:30:28,012
(Chuckles)

2414
01:30:28,046 --> 01:30:31,684
I wanted to thank you
for the papers in person.

2415
01:30:31,716 --> 01:30:33,018
I need to say I'm sorry to you.

2416
01:30:33,051 --> 01:30:34,653
I... I really...
I think I needed this

2417
01:30:34,685 --> 01:30:37,655
to be something that it was
not goin' to turn into

2418
01:30:37,689 --> 01:30:39,592
and um, I'm sorry.

2419
01:30:42,828 --> 01:30:44,597
I don't think I was
completely fair

2420
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:46,931
or honest
with my feelings either.

2421
01:30:46,965 --> 01:30:51,971
I liked having a friend,
maybe a partner.

2422
01:30:52,003 --> 01:30:53,838
I got carried away, too.

2423
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:57,742
Thank you.

2424
01:30:57,775 --> 01:31:00,645
(Indistinct lyrics
in background)

2425
01:31:01,445 --> 01:31:04,617
I need to be a parent
on my own first

2426
01:31:04,649 --> 01:31:06,684
and then down the road.

2427
01:31:06,717 --> 01:31:08,220
Who knows?

2428
01:31:08,252 --> 01:31:10,255
I just need a chance
to get on that road.

2429
01:31:10,287 --> 01:31:13,291
(Indistinct lyrics

2430
01:31:13,324 --> 01:31:14,359
(Sighing)

2431
01:31:14,393 --> 01:31:17,395
I'm meeting Ken
for a late dinner,

2432
01:31:17,429 --> 01:31:19,965
so I gotta get going,

2433
01:31:19,997 --> 01:31:22,201
but um, I will see you
at the check-up next week.

2434
01:31:22,234 --> 01:31:25,071
(Indistinct lyrics
in background)

2435
01:31:28,939 --> 01:31:33,244
I actually really
like Eddie as a name.

2436
01:31:33,278 --> 01:31:34,012
Really?

2437
01:31:34,046 --> 01:31:36,382
Yeah, it's cute.

2438
01:31:36,414 --> 01:31:37,850
And it's very you.

2439
01:31:48,393 --> 01:31:49,927
(Grunting)

2440
01:31:49,961 --> 01:31:51,195
George!

2441
01:31:51,229 --> 01:31:52,798
This feels
completely unnecessary.

2442
01:31:52,831 --> 01:31:53,666
- No, no, yes it is.
- Come on.

2443
01:31:53,698 --> 01:31:54,298
Where's the fucking car?

2444
01:31:54,332 --> 01:31:55,267
I don't know!

2445
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:55,800
It said it's gonna be here
in two minutes.

2446
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:56,166
(Indistinct speech)

2447
01:31:56,201 --> 01:31:57,202
(Grunting)

2448
01:31:57,234 --> 01:31:58,436
What?

2449
01:31:58,470 --> 01:31:59,872
Will someone please
hand me my fucking phone

2450
01:31:59,904 --> 01:32:01,105
or call Roger?

2451
01:32:01,139 --> 01:32:02,708
This is really early
and I know it's normal.

2452
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:03,676
But like
what if it's too early?

2453
01:32:03,708 --> 01:32:05,210
It's gonna be fine,
it wants to come out.

2454
01:32:05,243 --> 01:32:06,011
I know, don't we all?

2455
01:32:06,043 --> 01:32:06,610
Huh, see?

2456
01:32:06,645 --> 01:32:07,246
She's still making jokes.

2457
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:07,846
(Grunting)

2458
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,715
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

2459
01:32:09,747 --> 01:32:11,817
What if its head
is like sticking out of me?

2460
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:14,019
Do you want me to check?

2461
01:32:14,051 --> 01:32:15,688
Yeah, actually I do.

2462
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:16,721
Okay.

2463
01:32:18,756 --> 01:32:19,257
Actually, no.

2464
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:19,925
Never mind, George.

2465
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:20,925
This is weird.

2466
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:21,292
I don't want you to do that,
get out of there.

2467
01:32:21,326 --> 01:32:22,159
Thank God.

2468
01:32:22,194 --> 01:32:22,895
It's... it's...
it's here, it's here.

2469
01:32:22,927 --> 01:32:24,829
Okay, please, look, this is it.

2470
01:32:24,863 --> 01:32:26,265
It's the last thing you do.

2471
01:32:26,297 --> 01:32:28,900
Just get in this cab
and then you're good.

2472
01:32:28,934 --> 01:32:30,002
No way, man,

2473
01:32:30,034 --> 01:32:32,037
I'm not takin'
fuckin' pregnant lady.

2474
01:32:32,069 --> 01:32:33,738
- What? Are you kidding?
- That's discrimination!

2475
01:32:33,771 --> 01:32:34,707
That's not discrimination!

2476
01:32:34,739 --> 01:32:36,108
(Overlapping conversation)

2477
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:37,842
I don't wanna fuckin' baby goo
all over my car!

2478
01:32:37,876 --> 01:32:39,478
What is your name?

2479
01:32:39,511 --> 01:32:40,879
Frank.

2480
01:32:40,912 --> 01:32:45,184
Okay, Frank,
I will name this baby Frank

2481
01:32:45,216 --> 01:32:49,220
if you just drive us
to the fucking hospital, okay?

2482
01:32:49,253 --> 01:32:50,021
Okay.

2483
01:32:50,055 --> 01:32:51,323
(Frank chuckles)

2484
01:32:51,355 --> 01:32:54,358
But that better be
Frank Antonio Raffaelee III,

2485
01:32:54,391 --> 01:32:55,092
With two Es!

2486
01:32:55,126 --> 01:32:56,462
- Fuck, go!
- Fucking, just go!

2487
01:32:56,494 --> 01:32:57,496
Just go!

2488
01:32:57,529 --> 01:32:59,064
Send me a picture
of little Frankie

2489
01:32:59,096 --> 01:33:00,198
and a Christmas card!

2490
01:33:00,231 --> 01:33:00,998
(Chuckling)

2491
01:33:01,032 --> 01:33:01,865
Oh.

2492
01:33:01,899 --> 01:33:02,299
Okay,
I'm gonna go get you a nurse.

2493
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:04,336
Deep breaths.

2494
01:33:04,368 --> 01:33:05,470
(Car whirring in distance)

2495
01:33:05,503 --> 01:33:07,338
MILO:
Fuck.

2496
01:33:07,372 --> 01:33:08,206
(Milo grunting)

2497
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:10,041
MILO:
George, fuck, I can't do this.

2498
01:33:10,074 --> 01:33:11,342
I can't do this please,
break my leg.

2499
01:33:11,376 --> 01:33:12,478
Please just break...
break my leg,

2500
01:33:12,511 --> 01:33:13,446
because then I can't push

2501
01:33:13,479 --> 01:33:14,880
and then they have
to give me a C-section.

2502
01:33:14,912 --> 01:33:16,214
Hey, hey, this is it.

2503
01:33:16,247 --> 01:33:18,116
This is really it.

2504
01:33:18,149 --> 01:33:20,085
You let me pull a splinter
out of your vagina

2505
01:33:20,118 --> 01:33:21,754
after your skinny dip
off of Connor Demanuel's

2506
01:33:21,787 --> 01:33:23,355
lake house dock junior year.

2507
01:33:23,387 --> 01:33:24,122
(Chuckling)

2508
01:33:24,155 --> 01:33:25,356
- GEORGE: You can do this.
- Okay.

2509
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:26,391
(Grunting)

2510
01:33:26,423 --> 01:33:27,826
- Hey.
- Okay, okay, okay.

2511
01:33:27,859 --> 01:33:28,894
(Chuckling)

2512
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:41,339
Hi.

2513
01:33:41,372 --> 01:33:42,875
Hey, honey.

2514
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:44,209
(Yawning)

2515
01:33:44,242 --> 01:33:47,980
Oh my God, I really passed out.

2516
01:33:48,012 --> 01:33:49,413
Um, she with Roger?

2517
01:33:49,447 --> 01:33:50,315
Are they okay?

2518
01:33:50,347 --> 01:33:51,382
Mmhmm.

2519
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:54,119
Roger's out there,
she's with him.

2520
01:33:54,152 --> 01:33:55,453
She's so beautiful.

2521
01:33:55,487 --> 01:33:57,221
GEORGE:
You did such a good job.

2522
01:33:57,255 --> 01:33:58,556
I thought
it was gonna be disgusting

2523
01:33:58,590 --> 01:33:59,525
and it was...

2524
01:33:59,557 --> 01:34:00,458
(Chuckling)

2525
01:34:00,492 --> 01:34:01,860
But I also cried the whole time.

2526
01:34:01,893 --> 01:34:02,895
He did.

2527
01:34:02,927 --> 01:34:05,430
He really, really did.

2528
01:34:05,462 --> 01:34:07,398
Thank you for being here,
you guys.

2529
01:34:07,431 --> 01:34:10,301
Of course.

2530
01:34:10,335 --> 01:34:13,005
Although, I did almost leave
out of sheer jealousy.

2531
01:34:13,037 --> 01:34:14,972
I was in labor for 22 hours

2532
01:34:15,006 --> 01:34:16,909
and you just
pushed her right out.

2533
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:18,042
22 hours?

2534
01:34:18,076 --> 01:34:19,177
Ugh, it's gross.

2535
01:34:19,211 --> 01:34:21,012
Like I guess taking
all that dick

2536
01:34:21,046 --> 01:34:23,015
did really pay off.

2537
01:34:23,047 --> 01:34:24,248
It's like uh, Slip 'N Slide.

2538
01:34:24,282 --> 01:34:25,150
Yeah.

2539
01:34:25,182 --> 01:34:26,350
(Chuckling)

2540
01:34:26,384 --> 01:34:27,152
All cool?

2541
01:34:27,185 --> 01:34:28,287
- NOOR: Mmhmm.
- Oh.

2542
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:29,153
ROGER:
Oh.

2543
01:34:29,186 --> 01:34:30,154
(Whispering)
Hi.

2544
01:34:30,188 --> 01:34:31,023
(Blows a kiss)

2545
01:34:31,055 --> 01:34:33,958
(Baby cooing)

2546
01:34:34,559 --> 01:34:35,561
Hi, honey.

2547
01:34:35,594 --> 01:34:36,529
How are you?

2548
01:34:36,561 --> 01:34:38,497
Why does everyone keep
calling me "honey"?

2549
01:34:38,529 --> 01:34:40,231
Don't ruin your baby glow.

2550
01:34:40,265 --> 01:34:41,333
I'm okay, I think.

2551
01:34:41,365 --> 01:34:42,501
Why do I still look pregnant?

2552
01:34:42,533 --> 01:34:43,835
This is so weird.

2553
01:34:43,868 --> 01:34:45,103
You look radiant.

2554
01:34:45,136 --> 01:34:47,039
Just don't look in the mirror.

2555
01:34:47,072 --> 01:34:47,840
(Baby cries)

2556
01:34:47,872 --> 01:34:49,173
- ROGER: You wanna hold her?
- No.

2557
01:34:49,207 --> 01:34:51,110
No, no, no, no.

2558
01:34:52,944 --> 01:34:54,580
I just... I feel
really sore still.

2559
01:34:59,184 --> 01:35:01,119
ROGER:
Can I get you anything?

2560
01:35:01,152 --> 01:35:03,188
Hmm.

2561
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:05,289
Yeah, actually, do you mind
grabbing me some ice?

2562
01:35:05,323 --> 01:35:06,826
Of course.

2563
01:35:11,529 --> 01:35:12,331
(Beep)

2564
01:35:12,363 --> 01:35:13,031
(Door squeaking)

2565
01:35:13,064 --> 01:35:14,599
(Indistinct chatter in distance)

2566
01:35:14,632 --> 01:35:16,135
(Door shuts)

2567
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:23,576
(Sighing)

2568
01:35:32,917 --> 01:35:35,621
(Indistinct conversation)

2569
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:41,426
Are you still seeing Cameron
on Friday?

2570
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:43,127
Uh, yeah.

2571
01:35:43,161 --> 01:35:45,029
Um, we're gonna get a drink
after a show.

2572
01:35:45,063 --> 01:35:46,230
Can you read the vibe?

2573
01:35:46,264 --> 01:35:47,666
Not really.

2574
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:49,300
No, we're just trying
not to overthink it, you know?

2575
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,269
Yeah.

2576
01:35:50,301 --> 01:35:52,036
I'll see him, I'll make amends.

2577
01:35:52,069 --> 01:35:53,204
Who knows after that?

2578
01:35:53,704 --> 01:35:54,672
(Lilah crying)

2579
01:35:54,706 --> 01:35:57,309
NOOR:
Oh, come on!

2580
01:35:57,341 --> 01:35:59,944
I am finally getting
to hang out with a human adult.

2581
01:35:59,978 --> 01:36:01,512
Are you really
gonna ruin it for me?

2582
01:36:01,546 --> 01:36:03,248
Yes, she did.

2583
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,583
