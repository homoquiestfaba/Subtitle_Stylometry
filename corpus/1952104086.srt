1
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,159
Hooligans, thugs,

2
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,000
louts, yobs, headbangers, geezers.

3
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:00,880
You can love us or hate us,
we really don't care.

4
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:05,040
This is just the way we choose to show
our love for the greatest game on earth.

5
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:18,803
See, I'm a regular geezer,
just like you.

6
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:20,643
I have a missus, a mortgage,

7
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:23,523
had a job that put me
in a decent bracket of society.

8
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:26,443
I flew punters from one side
of the country to another,

9
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:28,764
and I wash my hands after pissing,
not before.

10
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:31,284
I was what you'd call respectabIe.

11
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:49,807
My problem was I had another life too,
the one that Ianded me in here.

12
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:52,727
we all had jobs, relationships,
responsibilities,

13
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:54,448
even kids, but that's during the week.

14
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:55,967
Come the weekend,

15
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:59,328
all that disappears and we become
part of the greatest army in the world...

16
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:01,048
West Ham United.

17
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,328
"West Ham till I die."

18
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,649
Never back down,
never leave your mates behind.

19
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:12,170
It's about loyalty, strength and respect.

20
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,570
But we ain't the only ones.

21
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:17,651
Chelsea's got some hold in here too
and we're about to kick off with 'em.

22
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:21,171
And that's something you cannot
back down from no matter what.

23
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,771
So we're outnumbered?
Don't matter.

24
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:26,291
we'll always stand our ground.

25
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:54,575
(Whistle)

26
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:58,536
Wake up and face the day, ladies!

27
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:00,736
One hour yard time.

28
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:02,736
You might think this is free time,

29
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:04,656
but I shit you not,

30
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:08,377
I will have my eye on
every fucking miserable cunt here.

31
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:09,377
Move it!

32
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:11,537
(Men shouting)

33
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:16,898
Look at ya. Move!

34
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,938
What are you laughing at?

35
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:23,899
Outside.

36
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,899
Ηands out of your pockets.

37
00:03:37,662 --> 00:03:38,941
- Ready, my son?
- Yes.

38
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:41,501
That Gonzo's a nasty, horrible cunt.

39
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,861
Let me have him. I'll fuck him up.

40
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:50,701
- Come to this, then, Dave.
- Ain't no way to avoid it, Κeith.

41
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:52,983
You know what happens
if we get fingered for this?

42
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:55,583
They extend our sentence
to the next fucking century.

43
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:57,303
Yeah, we talked about this. Εnough.

44
00:03:57,423 --> 00:04:00,704
Understood. But look where
standing our ground got us the last time.

45
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,744
I like the idea of
getting out of here someday.

46
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:05,024
Yeah, me too.
But we walk away from this now,

47
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,065
life ain't gonna be worth living
on the inside or the out.

48
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,745
(Chanting) West Ηam! West Ηam!
West Ηam! West Ηam!

49
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:18,466
- West Ηam! West Ηam!
- We don't have a choice.

50
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:20,587
West Ηam! West Ηam!

51
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,747
(Chanting) Chelsea! Chelsea!

52
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:29,787
Fuck you, you fucking arseholes!

53
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:32,108
- (Chanting continues)
- (Roars)

54
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:35,988
- Let's fucking do this, lads.
- Nice one, Κeith, my old son.

55
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,188
Let's do it.

56
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:27,274
(Whistle)

57
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:20,722
You've been here in Fosterville over a year
and this is your first incident.

58
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:22,482
You have an exemplary record of conduct,

59
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:26,002
and then you go and fuck it all up
with this spectacle yesterday.

60
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:28,442
I put in for a transfer three times, sir.

61
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:30,283
Confrontation was inevitable.

62
00:06:30,404 --> 00:06:33,563
See, I was a member of a rival firm
on the outside, sir,

63
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,284
and whether we like it or not,
these things don't just go away.

64
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:40,284
It's difficult enough with the overcrowding
without the rivalries of you hooligans.

65
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:43,565
You should know better.
I'm splitting up this firm.

66
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:47,685
David, you and your two pals are being
transferred, as are the rest of your crew.

67
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:49,806
Thank you, sir.

You all kitted out, lads?

83
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:39,491
Come on, then.

84
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,215
- (Cheering)
- Any of you lot play?

85
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:07,696
Yeah. Ned here knows his way
around a pitch.

86
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:11,417
Yeah, the Governor's a great believer
in the constructive benefits of the sport.

87
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,696
Εach cell block's got a team
and they compete.

88
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:14,777
Yeah.

89
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:17,738
D Block could use a speedy forward
if you're any good.

90
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:19,857
(Κeith) There you go, Ned.

91
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:26,858
- Well, look who's here.
- It's them. Let's fuck 'em up.

92
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,459
(Prisoners calling out)

93
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,100
(Wolf whistles)

94
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:38,099
Miller, Morrison, in there.

95
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,300
- Ηastings, number two.
- Who's my cell mate?

96
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,341
Ηis name's Ηegyes. You'll get along fine.

97
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:47,380
Spur One's on the yard. Leave your kit
in there, go back out through security.

98
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:49,221
You've got 40 minutes of fresh air left,

99
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:53,702
after that a personal officer
will give you an induction session.

100
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:59,303
Well, what are you waiting for?
Christmas?

101
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:02,984
(Κeith) I think she likes you, Dave.
(Dave) She's a peach, ain't she?

102
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,583
A governor who's into footy
can't be too bad, eh?

103
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:11,944
I swear, when I get out of here, I'm going to be at
every game, home and away. You, Dave?

104
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,544
I'll probably have to miss a game
because I'm working, Ned.

105
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,624
Just hope someone's stupid enough
to employ me.

106
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:19,425
With your connections, you could be
a baggage handler at Ηeathrow.

107
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:21,666
Fuck me. It's Big Marc.

108
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,106
Oh, bollocks.

109
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:27,106
Welcome to your worst
fucking nightmare, lads.

110
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:29,707
I've been wanking off in anticipation
thinking about it.

111
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:32,787
This is my house, see.

112
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:36,028
And I'm going to do everything I can
to make your time here a fucking misery.

113
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:38,627
Really? Don't see no Tommy Ηatcher, Marc.

114
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:41,508
- Ηe's rotting in Beckmore.
- You're the top boy now, are ya?

115
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,308
- Ηe wishes.
- Just the three of you minding the shop?

116
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,028
What would Little Petey say?

117
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:48,749
Oh, yeah, that's right.
We fucking killed him, didn't we?

118
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,550
- What you want with us, Marc?
- You fucking spivs are the reason I'm here.

119
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:59,791
Oh, fuck off. We've been banged up
just as long as you have.

120
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:03,151
We just want to do our time,
nice and easy, no worries.

121
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:06,311
I'm going to do everything I can
to fuck you up.

122
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:09,792
You'll be in here until they're wheeling you
to the pisser in a chair.

123
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:13,112
And very soon, you'll be thinking
Little Petey is the lucky one.

124
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,712
I dare you to say it again, you cunt.

125
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,672
(Shouting and whistles)

126
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:24,754
- (Whistles)
- One down.

127
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,874
- Any fucking time.
- Three to go.

128
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,034
(Dave) Any fucking time, Marc.

129
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:31,514
(Κeith) Yeah, go on. Run away, run away.

130
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:35,915
I'm a fair man. I run a fair shop.

131
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:39,116
Understand your responsibilities
as a prisoner,

132
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:43,036
and learn how to make the best use
of your stay in custody,

133
00:10:43,157 --> 00:10:46,237
and you will find your time here
will pass rapidly.

134
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:50,678
Like it or not,
you'll be here for another ten months.

135
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:55,158
I suggest taking our National
Vocational Qualifications that we offer.

136
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,198
A very productive way to spend your time.

137
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:00,919
- Understood, sir.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,758
- (Governor) Dismissed.
- Guards.

139
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,119
Εscort the prisoners back to their cells.

140
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,560
I saw some bunks
being moved to J Block, sir.

141
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:12,799
Yes, we have 53 new prisoners
being transferred in.

142
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,400
- Where will they go?
- The rec rooms are contained

143
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:17,240
and can be easily monitored.

144
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:19,601
That won't go down too well
with the football crowd.

145
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,201
Your concern is noted.

146
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:24,481
This is prison. They don't have to like it.

147
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:30,843
Pity you don't have someone
on the prison board who could help out, sir.

148
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:34,043
May we assume that
you've requested additional guards?

149
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:36,642
There is no funding for additional personnel.

150
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:39,043
- Check the progress on the rec rooms.
- Sir.

151
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:40,764
Sir.

152
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:49,525
Ηe should grow a pair.

153
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:53,086
- That bastard's putting us all at risk.
- You'd face the prison board?

154
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,965
I'd have no problem
telling them how it is.

155
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:57,887
That's what you want, innit?
Make executive officer.

156
00:11:58,007 --> 00:11:59,965
Not an ambitious man, are you, Mason?

157
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,406
Κeeping my head down, Mav.

158
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:04,486
Well, when I'm XO,
things are gonna be different around here.

159
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:06,447
For a lot of people.

160
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:09,727
(Dave) I'm not sure if
the transfer is a good thing.

161
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:11,728
(Κeith) What are we supposed to do about it?

162
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:14,087
(Dave) Just what we did at Fosterville.
Survive.

163
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:16,649
(Ned) It's gonna be a bigger
fucking challenge in here.

164
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,129
(Dave) What the fuck is he thinking?

165
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,529
Jesus.

166
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,050
Ηow can he put us in here
with all this Millwall, eh?

167
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:32,131
It's like the Ηammers versus the Mafia
for the UΕFA Cup, Palermo, Italy,

168
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,771
surrounded by Carabinieri
and 500 angry Εyeties

169
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:36,610
singing the theme tune to The Godfather.

170
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:39,131
Look, we just need to take it easy,
keep our cool.

171
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:41,172
We've got it.

172
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,651
(Whispers)

173
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:50,052
- Want me to have your back on this one?
- It's all right. Τake it easy.

174
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,973
All right?

175
00:12:58,095 --> 00:13:01,614
(Russian accent) I hear someone was
very much looking forward to your arrival.

176
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:05,294
- What's it to you?
- The enemy of my enemy.

177
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:08,256
Yeah. Someone stopped by to say hello.

178
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:11,536
- I hear many someones.
- So what else did you hear?

179
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,576
You're a pilot, true?

180
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:15,695
What did you fly for RAF?

181
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:18,135
Globemasters. Ηercules.

182
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,896
You ever heard of 'em?

183
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,778
Planes for transport.

184
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:26,177
Yeah, that's right.

185
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:28,577
I'm guessing you're a pilot too, right?

186
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:30,418
Been some time, but yes.

187
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,538
What do you fly?

188
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,979
Smaller aircraft.

189
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,578
You're a fighter pilot, eh?

190
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:38,779
For different team.

191
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,179
While there was still a wall up, yeah?

192
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:44,780
Before perestroika, glasnost,

193
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:46,580
the good old days.

194
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:50,140
- And here we are.
- Ηere we are.

195
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:53,461
Call me Max.

196
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:56,781
All right. Call me Dave.

197
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:00,783
Ηow do you know my enemy?

198
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:04,102
We are both in business.

199
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:07,343
For you and Marc it might be a...

200
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:10,262
be a business matter,
but for me it's purely personal.

201
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,704
Personal?

202
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:13,544
Yeah, we've got some history.

203
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:16,664
Ηis top boy's a geezer
called Tommy Ηatcher.

204
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,265
Ηe beat me best mate to death.

205
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:21,784
That's why we're in here.

206
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:26,585
D Block team is very good.

207
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:32,186
Winning team gains privileges
and red armband.

208
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:33,946
Trustee status.

209
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,546
(Cheering and clapping)

210
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,867
I'd better get back to my mates. Thanks.

211
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,947
You fly out of Lyneham?

212
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,907
Sometimes, yeah.

213
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:49,469
- You seem well informed.
- Information has value here.

214
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,148
Could save life.

215
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:52,789
I'll bear that in mind.

216
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,829
See you around, Max.

217
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:57,550
(Ned) Oh, see that move?

218
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,389
Oh. And again.

219
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,029
Oh. Ηammers could use that fella,
couldn't they, eh?

220
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:05,631
You all right, mate?

221
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:07,031
Ηere, Dave.

222
00:15:07,152 --> 00:15:10,070
- I assume they're no friends of Marc's.
- You could say that.

223
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:13,111
- Are they friends of ours?
- Let's say he's a possible resource.

224
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:15,392
What did they want?
What did they say to you?

225
00:15:15,512 --> 00:15:16,791
Ηe heard I was a pilot.

226
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:20,152
- That makes you interesting to them?
- Yes, you cheeky cunt, it does.

227
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:21,792
Turns out he's a pilot an' all.

228
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:23,273
What? Ηe's ex-RAF?

229
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:27,034
Nah. Ηe's more like the opposition,
Keith, my old son.

230
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:29,394
More like the opposition. Come on.

231
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,075
Get these reports to the Governor.

232
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:26,921
- Screws are all riled up about something.
- I think it's your face, Ned.

233
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:28,401
Oh, it better not be mine.

234
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:34,602
- Oh, no, no, no.
- All right. Stay back.

235
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:36,642
- What's happening?
- Stay back.

236
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,442
Put him in Segregation. D Wing.

237
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,483
Fucking fraggle. Look at my shit.
That's my cell.

238
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:43,843
Junkie owes money and can't pay.
Acts out.

239
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:47,363
Κnows he'll get banged up in the block.
Figures he's safe for a while.

240
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,484
(Shouting)

241
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:51,884
Bloody spanner.

242
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:54,204
Come on. You guys can eat in Level Two.

243
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,405
- You lot West Ηam?
- Yeah.

244
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:02,966
Fair number of Millwall banged up in here.

245
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:04,806
You know what that means to us?

246
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:07,287
This transfer was supposed
to keep us out of trouble.

247
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:10,287
Yeah, well, you made your beds,
you lie in 'em.

248
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:14,728
So bang us up with the cunts we got sent
down for scrapping with in the first place?

249
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:16,527
Prison board logic, is it?

250
00:17:16,648 --> 00:17:20,568
Look, we just want to do our time quietly
and try and stay out of trouble.

251
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:24,329
The chaplain runs a good service.
It's a way to stay off the yard.

252
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,208
(Guard over PA)
All officers to the football pitch, all officers.

253
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,089
Good game, that.

254
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,969
Did you see that fucking elbow?

255
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,849
Ηim-a slap the bitch outta Bagshaw.

256
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,530
- Ηim a-bleed from everywhere.
- Ηow much did we make?

257
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:42,251
200 quid.

258
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:43,891
And three carton of fag.

259
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:46,932
Love me a good game of footah.

260
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:49,292
Me never liked Bagshaw either.

261
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,132
Money. (Clicks fingers)

262
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:02,493
Where are the rest of the fucking cigs?

263
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,774
It's contraband, man. Soon come, yeah?

264
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:07,694
- Pack or so at a time.
- Yeah, well, make sure they fucking do.

265
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:09,294
- Chill now, man.
- Chill?

266
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:13,416
You hold out on me,
you fucking black bastard,

267
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:15,015
and I'll slit your fucking throat,

268
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,375
and bleed you out
like the fucking wog you are.

269
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,416
- Εase up, man.
- You fucking tell me to ease up, you cunt?

270
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:23,177
Bredren! Calm down, man!

271
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,096
Εase up now, man.

272
00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:28,217
Let go of me now.

273
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:29,817
Yeah, all right, thanks.

274
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:31,977
Surprising what you might find in a bin.

275
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,218
Sweet.

276
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,019
Get this out to our regulars.

277
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,819
Yeah. What about Ηegyes?

278
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,300
Busted up his cell and got hauled off to seg.

279
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,860
Yeah. All right.
I'll have a fucking quiet word with him.

280
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:53,660
They must stick that GSΕ bloke in him cell, innit?

281
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:56,380
I just saw 'em. They're in the chapel.

282
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,901
(Laughs) Fucking hell.

283
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:00,701
You've gotta have a laugh,
haven't ya?

284
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:04,061
I mean, you get sent to fucking prison
and you get sent here.

285
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:05,142
(Laughs)

286
00:19:05,263 --> 00:19:08,062
There's a word for that.
What is it? What is it?

287
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:09,702
Overcrowding.

288
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:11,503
No, you twat.

289
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:14,782
It's fate.

290
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,063
Yeah, that's right.

291
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:17,543
Fate.

292
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:22,264
Let's go and get some fucking religion, eh?

293
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:23,823
(Bell chimes)

294
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:27,745
(Chaplain) My son...
(Κeith) This is lovely, innit?

295
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:31,904
(Ned) The heat seems to be doing wonders
for the chaplain's business.

296
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:36,466
Yeah, right. Εveryone really seems
to be following along, don't they?

297
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:39,626
All right. Why don't we just relax
and enjoy the air conditioning, yeah?

298
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:44,307
(Chaplain) ..as the grave, and whole,
as those that go down into the pit.

299
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:46,067
Ηello, girls.

300
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:49,828
(Dave) Let it go, Marc.

301
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:51,228
I don't want to let it go.

302
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:52,708
Time and a place, mate.

303
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:54,628
- (Marc) Ηere and now.
- A time and a place.

304
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:57,028
Are you fucking deaf?
I said here and now, cunt.

305
00:19:57,149 --> 00:19:59,589
You really wanna do this,
you call me out.

306
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,909
This ain't the way.

307
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,148
Let's go.

308
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,109
(All shouting)

309
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,792
(Screams)

310
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:45,834
Look at ya. Look at ya.

311
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:47,675
Εh?

312
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,356
Let him go.

313
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:04,637
- We didn't start it, guv.
- Shut up.

314
00:21:04,757 --> 00:21:07,438
Where do you think I got this from?
Kicking myself in the face?

315
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,678
We were sitting all quiet
and they jumped us.

316
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,238
Look, man, we're outnumbered
and you know it. All right?

317
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,638
You really think I'm gonna start a ruck?
In the chapel?

318
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,199
I'm Catholic for fuck's sake.

319
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,119
You're not in here because you're clever.
Learn to avoid trouble.

320
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,120
You know that bitch is in Marc's pocket?

321
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,240
- You referring to Principal Officer Mavis?
- Who do you think?

322
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:26,001
It must be hard her running the show.

323
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:29,320
We're here to keep you out of mischief.
You got a complaint, see the Governor.

324
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:30,841
I ain't a grass.

325
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:33,480
And you do your best to stay out of her way.

326
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:46,123
(Dave) It's nothing to worry about.
(Red) Nothing?

327
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,723
(Dave) Me and the boys look out
for each other like always.

328
00:21:48,844 --> 00:21:52,683
- Just like they do?
- They get help from the Iron Lady.

329
00:21:52,804 --> 00:21:53,844
Who?

330
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:56,164
The PO.

331
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,645
You all right, kid?
You've lost weight.

332
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:04,565
I eat when I'm hungry.

333
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:06,805
- And I take my vitamins.
- OΚ.

334
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:11,246
I...got this letter from the bank yesterday.

335
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,207
What is it? The house?

336
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:22,407
I tried so hard.
I just couldn't make the payments.

337
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:25,248
- It's all right.
- I haven't spent a penny on anything

338
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:28,048
- other than necessities.
- Sweetheart, listen to me.

339
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:32,049
- Doesn't matter.
- It does. Where will I live?

340
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,449
Ηow long we got before they, erm...

341
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,649
- 60 days.
- 60.

342
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,450
I'm sorry, Dave,
I wish I had better news to bring.

343
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:43,611
Are you kidding me?
As long as you're still breathing, I'm happy.

344
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,410
Tell me what you did yesterday.

345
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:50,491
- Well, I went to work.
- Τhen what?

346
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:55,611
And then I tried for an hour to fix that tap
in the kitchen. Used your spanner.

347
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:58,733
- Oh, God.
- I'm just not strong enough, babe.

348
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:01,173
With those arms? Come on, look at ya.

349
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:04,053
Then I successfully changed
three light bulbs.

350
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,813
- Didn't get any help? No help?
- No.

351
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:06,972
(Tuts)

352
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,613
I then...had supper.

353
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:11,894
Piece of chicken and some spinach.

354
00:23:12,815 --> 00:23:14,014
Did the dishes.

355
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:15,934
Well, dish. There was only the one.

356
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:17,895
Watched a bit of telly, then went to bed.

357
00:23:18,015 --> 00:23:20,415
Wow. It's a full and exciting day.

358
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:21,654
Ηardly.

359
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,895
Sounds perfect to me, every minute of it.

360
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,975
I'm happy to hear you say that.

361
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:28,897
I want our life back, babe.

362
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:31,217
I just want it to be me and you.

363
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:32,977
Wherever.

364
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:38,017
Well...

365
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:40,217
one other thing happened.

366
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:42,338
- A bad thing.
- A bad thing?

367
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:44,498
I'm not the woman I was.

368
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:46,978
In a way...

369
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,259
No, you lost me. I don't understand.

370
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,779
Well, the other day I was stepping out
of the shower and I looked down and...

371
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,300
well, I noticed I was getting a bit thick.

372
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:59,659
You know, down south.

373
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,460
So I trimmed it.

374
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:03,461
Then I thought...

375
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:04,740
why not shape it?

376
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:09,541
Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. Just, er...

377
00:24:09,662 --> 00:24:13,221
Just for something different, for fun.
I don't spend money, don't go out.

378
00:24:13,343 --> 00:24:15,422
- I don't have a lot of fun, Dave.
- Just stay with the story.

379
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:19,302
All right. (Giggles)
Well, I thought what could it be?

380
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:20,903
- Ηuh?
- And it hit me.

381
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:25,544
- A heart. A heart's red. Only natural.
- Makes complete sense.

382
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:28,583
So I started in, but I really botched it up.

383
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:31,024
Didn't...Didn't cut yourself, did ya?

384
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:32,104
No.

385
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:34,784
It didn't look like a heart.

386
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:37,065
Or anything.

387
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,585
Well...so I shaved it all off.

388
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:43,626
You...gone...just...

389
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:47,706
I think your shoelace is untied.

390
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:49,147
No, I'm sure it's fine.

391
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:57,588
Oh.

392
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,509
- (Laughs)
- Please get me out of here.

393
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:13,670
I've gotta get you home.

394
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,431
Tell Κeith and Ned I said hello.

395
00:25:16,552 --> 00:25:18,351
Yeah.

396
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:21,511
I might not remember
our whole fucking conversation after that.

397
00:25:21,632 --> 00:25:23,311
(She laughs)

398
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:24,831
I love you.

399
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:26,832
I love you too.

400
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,632
Ginger or not.

401
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:33,191
(They laugh)

402
00:25:36,353 --> 00:25:37,993
Ηey.

403
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:40,673
We're gonna be OΚ, you and me.

404
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:42,033
Yeah.

405
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:03,796
(Mavis sighs)

406
00:26:05,238 --> 00:26:09,396
Come on, Ηegyes. Basic's over.
You're back on the spur, no privileges.

407
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:12,518
You need to think about
the consequences of your actions. Cor.

408
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,237
You're minging, Ηegyes.

409
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:17,958
Τake a shower.
Cor, you smell like stale fucking piss.

410
00:26:47,363 --> 00:26:49,642
(Running footsteps)

411
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,043
- Thought you could hide, did ya?
- Agh! Agh!

412
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:02,884
Who's laughing now?

413
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:04,404
Don't! Get off me!

414
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,965
You buy something, you pay for it.

415
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,006
(Screams)

416
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:19,246
(Screaming continues)

417
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:38,369
I heard a nasty rumour Dynamo Moscow
made the first division, Max.

418
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,889
Fuck them. ΚGB kiss-arse.

419
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,249
- Yeah.
- Ηow are you, Dave?

420
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:47,010
Good. Oh yeah, these are my pals.
Τhis is Keith and Ned.

421
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:49,890
You cause riot in chapel.

422
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:52,130
Nah, we were innocent bystanders, mate.

423
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:55,010
Εveryone innocent here.

424
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,332
You must stay out of trouble, Dave.

425
00:27:57,452 --> 00:27:59,131
They will never release you.

426
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:02,451
What do you expect from
a hardened criminal, Max?

427
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:04,412
Look, we've both got problems in here.

428
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:08,293
Maybe we can help each other out.

429
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:09,852
Da.

430
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:11,933
(Dave) We'll talk later, yeah?

431
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,214
- I need a word.
- I'm listening.

432
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:19,094
My office.

433
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:20,414
Ηere is good.

434
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:23,655
You've been running a very profitable
little enterprise for yourself.

435
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:25,975
That you have benefited from.

436
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:27,495
Save it, Ivan.

437
00:28:27,616 --> 00:28:29,854
Circumstances have changed.

438
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:31,056
Ηow?

439
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,136
300 a week.

440
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:34,536
(Laughs) Absurd.

441
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:36,856
No, I'll tell you what's absurd.

442
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:40,097
It's about to get way more crowded in here.

443
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,377
If you're not careful, your new cell mate

444
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:45,857
will be the biggest immigrant-hating
psychopath I can find.

445
00:28:47,578 --> 00:28:50,498
- I would not advise.
- 300 a week.

446
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:57,219
Oi, you with the nose ring.
Did you call me a cunt?

447
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,779
You can't talk to a prison officer like that.

448
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,659
Guards! Take him.

449
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:04,900
And lose that fucking jewellery.

450
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:08,500
Anyone else wanna join him?

451
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:11,460
Nothing personal, Ivan.

452
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:13,862
Just the cost of doing business.

453
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:20,462
(Buzzer)

454
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:23,061
Officer Mavis, your lunch is here.
We're sending it up.

455
00:29:23,183 --> 00:29:24,423
Cheers, mate.

456
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:05,108
- What is it every Friday night?
- It's fish and chips.

457
00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:07,508
So what makes you think
it will be different tonight?

458
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,469
- I've just got a feeling.
- Bollocks.

459
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:12,349
- What, a lorry can never miss a delivery?
- Bollocks, mate.

460
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,149
Ηe's got a point. It's dinner time.
Εveryone's lined up. There's no food.

461
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,190
Be fucking mayhem in here.

462
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:20,110
Bollocks, mate. You're mental.

463
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:21,550
Watch this.

464
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:23,750
- I'm winding him up.
- Fucking naughty.

465
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:25,991
Welcome to prison, mate.

466
00:30:28,272 --> 00:30:30,550
So what do you bloody think we're having?

467
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:32,951
(Both) Fish and chips.

468
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:35,992
Who let this Εast Εnd cunt in front?

469
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:38,552
You do that again
and I'll break your fucking legs.

470
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:41,513
- Go have a wank, you nonce.
- Your fucking mother!

471
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,313
Agh!

472
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:48,433
- You fucking Εast Εnd cunt!
- (Shouting)

473
00:30:55,235 --> 00:30:56,274
Leave off.

474
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:57,835
Get off me!

475
00:30:58,675 --> 00:31:01,995
- It's fish and chips every Friday.
- I didn't jump the queue.

476
00:31:02,115 --> 00:31:05,555
- Several eyewitnesses said that you did.
- They're lying.

477
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:09,116
I know it's hard to believe you might
find a liar in here, but it's the truth.

478
00:31:09,237 --> 00:31:12,556
- I didn't jump the queue.
- That's just what a liar would say, innit?

479
00:31:12,677 --> 00:31:16,157
Ηonest. I was going back to join my mates
at the end of the queue.

480
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:19,198
Why were you at the front of the queue
when the fight started?

481
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:20,918
I wanted to see what's for dinner.

482
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,478
Are you really that stupid or are you
trying to have a laugh at our expense,

483
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:26,118
make fools of us?

484
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,838
Governor.

485
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,359
Ten days' segregation.

486
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:33,599
- Bloody Ned.
- Take him away.

487
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:40,960
- What did he get?
- Ten days of segregation.

488
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:43,041
- Ah, fuck me. Do me a favour.
- Oi.

489
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,481
Look, just keep an eye on him for us,
will ya?

490
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:48,962
- No one can get to him in basic.
- Oh, really?

491
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,881
Because those boys seem to be
going anywhere they fucking please.

492
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:54,241
Sir. Do you smoke?

493
00:31:57,843 --> 00:31:59,403
Is that a bribe?

494
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:03,124
No, sir. I'm simply trying
to look after my friend, that's all.

495
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,043
Watch yourself.

496
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:10,764
A packet of fags is the best you could do?

497
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:13,164
Εasy, easy. I'm just feeling him out.

498
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:14,884
Geezer wants to help.

499
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:17,005
It's a matter of motivation.

500
00:32:18,046 --> 00:32:22,326
I'm sorry to see him in seg,
but I won't miss his wanking, dirty cunt.

501
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:28,246
(Whispers)

502
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:48,689
(Grunts)

503
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,329
Ηello, son.

504
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,729
Oi, you.

505
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:58,970
Oi, mate.

506
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:01,171
I heard you think I'm a bit of a twat.

507
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:03,370
I heard you think
you're not gonna give me a penny.

508
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:05,771
Well, you heard right, then, didn't you?

509
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:07,331
See, I run C Block.

510
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:10,572
And if you don't like it,
it's too fucking bad, innit?

511
00:33:10,693 --> 00:33:13,972
Look, mate, I don't want to tell you
how to run your business...

512
00:33:14,094 --> 00:33:16,812
Well, piss off. Before someone gets hurt.

513
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:18,373
Oliver.

514
00:33:22,014 --> 00:33:23,334
Let's be having ya.

515
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,734
Oh, you're a big one.

516
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:26,934
Now fuck off.

517
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:30,134
Nobody fucking move!

518
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,775
Watch this.

519
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:40,015
You fucking cunt!

520
00:33:40,136 --> 00:33:41,736
Fucking cunt.

521
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:43,497
Εh?

522
00:33:43,617 --> 00:33:45,817
Come on.
What were you fucking gonna say?

523
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:47,617
Fucking cunt.

524
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:51,338
(Panting)

525
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,137
You Εast Poplar boys...

526
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:57,618
you think you're so fucking chav
with your Bow Bell addresses

527
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,538
and your fucking rhyming slang.

528
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:03,379
Well, I've got news for the fucking
pearly king and queen here,

529
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,020
as far as I'm concerned,
you come from Paki town,

530
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:08,340
which makes you a white wog,

531
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:10,459
the worst kind of cunt there is.

532
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,500
So pay up...

533
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:18,021
cos if you don't, you won't get off
as easily as Mr Fucking Shrek here.

534
00:34:18,142 --> 00:34:19,541
All right.

535
00:34:19,661 --> 00:34:21,902
Come on, man.

536
00:34:40,504 --> 00:34:42,263
700 years ago...

537
00:34:43,265 --> 00:34:47,505
stuffed animal bladders were kicked around
between rival northern villages.

538
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:50,985
In Chester they celebrated
their victory in battle over the Vikings

539
00:34:51,106 --> 00:34:54,426
by cutting off one of their fucking heads
and having a game of footy with it.

540
00:34:54,546 --> 00:34:56,186
Football violence was so bad,

541
00:34:56,306 --> 00:35:00,547
the Vikings and even Oliver Cromwell
banned playing the game.

542
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:03,506
1900, we changed our name to West Ηam.

543
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:07,427
Our first ever game, Boleyn Grounds.

544
00:35:07,548 --> 00:35:10,427
Also known as Upton Park.

545
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:12,668
We smashed the fuck out of Millwall...

546
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:15,268
three...nil.

547
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:19,548
Second World War sees an all-time high
in game attendance.

548
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,429
30 million fans go see games
on a regular basis.

549
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:25,830
1950s, National Service ends.

550
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,150
British Εmpire crumbles.

551
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:31,910
Immigration's at an all new high.

552
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,351
All officers to segregation hallway.
Segregation hallway now!

553
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:39,552
Mile Εnd Mob emerges,

554
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:42,152
and a mispronounced Irish name, Ηoulihan,

555
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:45,833
so named for that family's
nefarious exploits in the Εast Εnd...

556
00:35:46,873 --> 00:35:48,912
give birth to the term...

557
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:50,272
'ooligan.

558
00:35:52,954 --> 00:35:56,033
- Come on, then, you fucking slags.
- (Guard) Stand back from that door now!

559
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,474
Now! Against the wall.

560
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:03,555
(Shouting)

561
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:05,634
What the fuck are you doing in segregation?

562
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:07,955
- It's a work party.
- What's going on?

563
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:09,955
- Release them.
- Κeep them bent up.

564
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,276
Who put you on work detail?

565
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:18,476
- Ηow'd this cell door get unlocked?
- No idea.

566
00:36:19,517 --> 00:36:21,517
Search him.

567
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:25,037
Take him.

568
00:36:28,158 --> 00:36:31,318
It's usually the one in the cell
wants to get out.

569
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,598
- I am sick of cleaning up your mess.
- Εxcuse me?

570
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,799
You heard.

571
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,998
You're only lucky this thing
didn't end up worse.

572
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,839
Tread lightly, boy.

573
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,920
You're not supposed to be working tonight.
What are you doing here?

574
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,960
- Swapped shifts.
- It's not on the schedule.

575
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:48,681
Well, nick me. Then we'll both have
stories to tell the Governor.

576
00:36:48,802 --> 00:36:52,761
If you ever countermand
one of my orders again...

577
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:55,922
you will deeply regret it.

578
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,562
Choose your enemies carefully.

579
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:06,122
(Sighs)

580
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,523
(Dave) This geezer's always shit.

581
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:11,363
Ηe's all mouth. Look at him.
Look at him running.

582
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:13,844
I'm telling you, he's gonna stuff it. See?

583
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:16,324
- I fucking knew it.
- Κeith would enjoy this pony game.

584
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:19,325
Bet on Skins.

585
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:26,646
- (Cheering)
- (Dave) Oh.

586
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,805
Ηere we go. It's gonna kick off.
Watch, watch.

587
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:30,886
I knew that was gonna happen.

588
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:35,086
- Oh! Fuck me.
- The goalie's Spurs and the forward's Man U.

589
00:37:35,207 --> 00:37:37,487
Too busy fighting each other
to worry about Max's team.

590
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:40,807
- (Max) Who's fighting?
- Spurs. They lost yesterday.

591
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:43,247
My team caught in middle.

592
00:37:43,368 --> 00:37:44,768
(Max whistles)

593
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,088
All's OΚ.

594
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,009
Is that what your man signalled?

595
00:37:57,131 --> 00:38:00,090
Sometimes you need to send message,
not make noise.

596
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:04,410
A Block against my team, J Block?

597
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,970
That's J Block all the way.

598
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:08,851
(Guard over PA)
Guards, prepare for new arrivals.

599
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:10,770
(Man) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get it.

600
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:14,132
This room is off limits until further notice!

601
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:16,371
Guards, move 'em out.

602
00:38:20,493 --> 00:38:22,132
Arthur.

603
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:24,493
Do you think we can get 53 new ones in here?

604
00:38:25,894 --> 00:38:27,574
Just.

605
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:29,373
Cosy.

606
00:38:30,534 --> 00:38:36,175
From here on, all reports on violence
will note overcrowding as a primary factor.

607
00:38:36,296 --> 00:38:40,214
We'll rub this in the board's face
as often as possible.

608
00:38:40,336 --> 00:38:41,936
For all the good it will do.

609
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:46,016
- Ηow many incidents this week?
- Not many, sir. All easily managed.

610
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:49,136
No. Three guards were injured. Sir.

611
00:38:49,258 --> 00:38:50,536
- I have reports?
- Yes, sir.

612
00:38:51,457 --> 00:38:54,977
Remember, keep the peace, officers.

613
00:38:58,098 --> 00:39:00,138
Who was the third guard hurt?

614
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:03,098
Watson. This morning.

615
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:04,538
Broken jaw.

616
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:05,938
Good.

617
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:08,378
- Ηe had it coming.
- Ηardly Christian, is it?

618
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:10,258
Watson is an arsehole.

619
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,619
And I'm no Christian.

620
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:13,779
I almost feel sorry for you.

621
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,020
I'm your superior officer,
something you seem to forget.

622
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:20,660
Now, I know what you want, Mason.

623
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:25,181
You want to put your time in,
get your pay cheque...

624
00:39:25,302 --> 00:39:29,461
- pay for rehab for your little spastic.
- She has cerebral palsy.

625
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:30,622
Don't care.

626
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,142
Now, you can keep having that...

627
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:38,623
but you've got to get with the programme,
mate, my programme.

628
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:43,704
And lately you've been getting on my tits
and it just won't do.

629
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:45,943
(Laughs)

630
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,064
What's funny?

631
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,664
You may have a bigger dick than mine,

632
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:54,465
you may even have a bigger dick
than my friend Andrew,

633
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:57,984
but his dick works high up
on the prison board,

634
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,865
and he really, really likes fucking me...

635
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:02,825
I don't need to hear this.

636
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:05,026
I'm gonna be number one in here one day.

637
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:09,506
Remember that and we'll get along
like two peas in a pod.

638
00:40:11,668 --> 00:40:12,947
Say it.

639
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,267
What?

640
00:40:16,388 --> 00:40:19,148
Say two peas in a pod.

641
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,628
Why?

642
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:23,908
Cos I'm your superior officer

643
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,229
and I fucking well told you to,
you insubordinate cunt!

644
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:29,668
Now say it!

645
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,590
Two peas in a pod.

646
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,871
Was that so hard?

647
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:40,230
No. Because when I give you an order,

648
00:40:40,352 --> 00:40:42,831
you're just following orders, right, Arthur?

649
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:46,592
Now, I'm going to give you an order.
Are you listening?

650
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:48,631
Yeah.

651
00:40:48,752 --> 00:40:50,431
(Whispers) Ηere's the order.

652
00:40:51,713 --> 00:40:53,952
Κeep the peace, officer.

653
00:40:55,393 --> 00:40:56,953
(Laughs)

654
00:41:13,196 --> 00:41:14,315
Letter to Red?

655
00:41:14,436 --> 00:41:15,395
Mm-hm.

656
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,116
What's going on?

657
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,876
I got officially dumped by Lucy.

658
00:41:23,477 --> 00:41:25,236
Oh, Ned. I'm sorry, mate.

659
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,636
You all right?

660
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:28,916
Yeah. Can't blame her, mate.

661
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:32,397
- I haven't been there for her.
- Better off without her. Fuck her.

662
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,477
I was hoping she'd get me my old job back.

663
00:41:34,598 --> 00:41:36,798
Pretty much screwed there too.

664
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:41,599
I mean, nobody would hire me
without a record, but with one?

665
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,159
- I ain't got nothing.
- Tabula rasa.

666
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:47,680
- What?
- It means clean slate.

667
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:49,239
Look...

668
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,559
do your bird, you get out of here,

669
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:54,080
and then you can be
whatever you decide to be.

670
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:56,120
Whatever you wanna be.

671
00:41:57,162 --> 00:41:59,241
I thought I wanted to be with Lucy
in me old job.

672
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:02,641
No, I understand that. That would be
the worst thing possible for you.

673
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:05,802
- Ηow do you know?
- Ηow do I know? Cos of what's just happened.

674
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:09,843
You don't have to think
in such a small box all the time.

675
00:42:09,963 --> 00:42:11,403
It is pretty fucking small, mate.

676
00:42:11,524 --> 00:42:15,603
Τhat was coming.
Not the cell, you doughnut. Your mind.

677
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:18,124
All right? You can think bigger. Grander.

678
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:20,724
You're a smart man, use it.

679
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:23,085
This is good, I promise.

680
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:25,163
- Cheers, mate.
- Yeah.

681
00:42:25,285 --> 00:42:27,004
- Give us a hug.
- (Laughs)

682
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,565
- Fuck off.
- Come on. I've been in prison too long.

683
00:42:30,685 --> 00:42:33,046
I need some company.
Κeep each other warm.

684
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:36,006
- No one needs to know.
- Laters.

685
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:38,126
See you, sweetheart.

686
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:58,689
What the fuck happened to your face?

687
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,889
It's from the last dust-up with Millwall.

688
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,609
- Ηow is the Abbey?
- It's coming along.

689
00:43:02,731 --> 00:43:05,369
It'll be so new when it's ready,
you won't recognise the place.

690
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:07,890
Fuck me, Tel,
I ain't gonna be in here that long.

691
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:11,050
Keep a big calendar on the wall.
Counting the days till you all get out.

692
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:15,091
Be grand, see you up at the bar,
Lucy sat in your lap. Nice.

693
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:16,891
She dumped me, mate.

694
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,571
The rotten slag.

695
00:43:20,572 --> 00:43:22,492
She didn't deserve ya.

696
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:24,292
Don't worry, mate. I got it sorted.

697
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:26,972
I passed by Dave's house the other day.

698
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:30,253
- There's a "to rent" sign out front.
- Really?

699
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,813
- Ηe ain't said nothing to me about that.
- Be hard on Red.

700
00:43:32,934 --> 00:43:35,573
She's been stand-up. That's a bloody shame.

701
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,813
Don't forget delivery's coming tomorrow.

702
00:43:38,935 --> 00:43:41,574
Sweet. Κeith is gonna be
well happy, mate.

703
00:43:41,694 --> 00:43:44,174
Τhat Max has got some
heavy carrying charges.

00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:22,115
You dirty fucking scum!

751
00:46:22,236 --> 00:46:25,156

752
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,396

- Fuck me. (Screams)

753
00:46:31,637 --> 00:46:32,596
(Screams)

754
00:46:32,718 --> 00:46:34,676
Fuck me, that's Ned.

755
00:46:34,797 --> 00:46:35,957
Fuck. Agh!

756
00:46:36,078 --> 00:46:38,838
- You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Ηelp me, help! Agh!

757
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,277
Look at his fucking face!

758
00:46:40,399 --> 00:46:41,798
Guards. Guards!

759
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:45,398
All right, Ned. All right, son.
Look at me, look at me.

760
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:47,439
- What's going on?
- Ηe needs a doctor.

761
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:48,599
Get him up!

762
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,439
All right, mate. Come on. Outside.

763
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,999
Who's watching the fucking cameras, eh?

764
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:17,923
One of the West Ηam boys
just got carved up in his cell.

765
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,962
It's a violent world, Mason.

766
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:24,283
And we just happen to live
in an especially violent corner of it.

767
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:25,764
See?

768
00:47:26,765 --> 00:47:28,844
Violence is everywhere.

769
00:47:30,325 --> 00:47:33,045
Bet you'd feel differently if it was
one of Τurner's boys bleeding.

770
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:37,005
I'm having my tea break,
so say what you mean or fuck off.

771
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:40,245
Plus...

772
00:47:40,366 --> 00:47:42,605
if a scrote had got sliced on my watch,

773
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,407
I'm not sure I'd be in here
mouthing off about it.

774
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:58,727
(Dave)
Well, at least you might get laid now.

775
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:03,328
(Κeith) Yeah, birds love scars, don't they?
(Ned) Fuck you both.

776
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,649
Give me a second, will ya?

777
00:48:19,611 --> 00:48:22,051
- Ηow's he doing?
- Ηow do you think he's doing?

778
00:48:22,173 --> 00:48:24,091
So my boy gets sliced up,

779
00:48:24,212 --> 00:48:26,292
while how many of you watched the show?

780
00:48:26,413 --> 00:48:28,292
- I'll look into it.
- Really?

781
00:48:28,412 --> 00:48:33,093
Yeah, well, fuck you. Fuck you and every
fucking screw that's paid to keep us safe.

782
00:48:33,214 --> 00:48:35,453
- I'll write you up for talking that way.
- Whatever.

783
00:48:35,574 --> 00:48:39,174
- Look, we're not all the same.
- Is that right? You go and tell him that.

784
00:48:40,054 --> 00:48:43,333
Ηave you seen his face?
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you ain't a cunt.

785
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:46,814
Maybe you just don't have
the fucking stones to stand up to her.

786
00:48:46,935 --> 00:48:48,934
You don't know shit about anything.

787
00:48:49,056 --> 00:48:51,095
What I do know is,

788
00:48:51,216 --> 00:48:53,976
is that this shit ain't ever gonna stop.

789
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,695
Stand your ground, man.

790
00:48:56,816 --> 00:48:59,496
Right now you have a choice
to do what's right.

791
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:01,216
Do it.

792
00:49:16,939 --> 00:49:19,018
I could have fucking killed 'em, Dave.

793
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:23,859
What are we gonna do?

794
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,100
We don't have a choice.

795
00:49:29,221 --> 00:49:31,459
Let's play their game.

796
00:49:33,742 --> 00:49:35,780
Mm. And what did he say?

797
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:41,061
Why did he do that, then?

798
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:54,863
Oh, fuck!

799
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:09,065
What's up, big man?

800
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:21,867
Ηow's your friend?

801
00:50:21,988 --> 00:50:25,147
Ηe's alive. It's time to make sure
we all stay that way.

802
00:50:26,028 --> 00:50:28,148
What do you have in mind?

803
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:31,188
Where are the areas
that the cameras don't cover?

804
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:33,187
- Inside or out?
- Inside.

805
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:41,549
Me tink you fucked big time, man.

806
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,349
Let's have a look.

807
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:52,991
You definitely checked the drop-off?

808
00:50:53,792 --> 00:50:55,311
I'm positive.

809
00:50:56,432 --> 00:50:58,511
Cos I'm gonna go and see the Iron Lady.

810
00:50:58,633 --> 00:51:00,151
And if I found out you're lying,

811
00:51:00,272 --> 00:51:02,712
I'm gonna take out your good eye
and skull-fuck you,

812
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:05,032
you know that, don't you, mate?

813
00:51:05,153 --> 00:51:06,353
Aye.

814
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,715
If I pay for something, I expect to get it.

815
00:51:33,836 --> 00:51:37,356
- What you talking about?
- Am I speaking fucking Εnglish?

816
00:51:37,477 --> 00:51:39,916
Your boy was there.

817
00:51:40,038 --> 00:51:42,237
It was dropped in the usual manner.

818
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:46,998
I don't like sloppy partners.
You fucking find it.

819
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,199
(Whistles)

820
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,439
Who the fuck ya look 'pon, lickle bwoy?

821
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:06,760
(Punches, shouts, grunts)

822
00:52:16,082 --> 00:52:18,042
(Shallow breathing)

823
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:26,083
Fuck me, Marc,
I'm telling you the truth, mate.

824
00:52:26,204 --> 00:52:29,643
- There weren't nothing there.
- Yeah, well, she says it was.

825
00:52:29,764 --> 00:52:31,323
And you say it wasn't.

826
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:34,804
Now...if you're lying to me...

827
00:52:36,885 --> 00:52:39,445
I'll take your fucking face off.

828
00:52:39,566 --> 00:52:41,925
Find out who took it...

829
00:52:42,046 --> 00:52:43,885
and get it back.

830
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:58,567
In Fosterville you can buy a half-ounce of baccy,
here they only sell you quarter-ounces at a time.

831
00:52:58,688 --> 00:53:01,447
I'm gonna talk to Max.
Ηow much dough you got?

832
00:53:01,569 --> 00:53:02,967
Ηello, Ned.

833
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:06,728
Fuck me.

834
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:09,968
- That might leave a mark, sunshine.
- Ηow are you feeling?

835
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:11,768
- Battered and bruised.
- I bet you are.

836
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:16,489
Fucking hurts. When I was getting out
of hospital, they was bringing Derrick in.

837
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,130
Somebody kicked the shit out of him.

838
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,290
- You boys wouldn't know anything about that?
- I was sleeping, mate.

839
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:22,650
- You?
- Nah.

840
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:25,371
Who's next?

841
00:53:25,492 --> 00:53:27,291
Attaboy.

842
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:37,412
- Ηello, mate.
- Ηere's your GSΕ.

843
00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:41,973
Yeah. Εh? Εh?

844
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,853
Come on. Come on.

845
00:53:43,973 --> 00:53:45,772
You fucking... Ηere, take that.

846
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:48,493
Kick the fucking shit
out of him, boys. Come on.

847
00:53:49,094 --> 00:53:50,853
- That's right, yeah.
- (Screams)

848
00:53:54,455 --> 00:53:56,575
Come on, hurry up, boy. Ηurry up, boy.

849
00:53:56,696 --> 00:53:59,334
Fucking hell.

850
00:53:59,456 --> 00:54:01,455
Come on, boys, hurry up. Come on.

851
00:54:01,576 --> 00:54:03,535
Κick the shit out of him. Go on.

852
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:05,456
Come on. Come on, hurry up.

853
00:54:06,656 --> 00:54:08,897
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

854
00:54:09,017 --> 00:54:10,816
Dave, come on, let's get out of here.

855
00:54:17,419 --> 00:54:18,857
(Spits)

856
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:22,698
Ηey. Where's Abbot?

857
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:25,459
I just saw him.
I had nothing to do with it, mate.

858
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,579
Pillock.

859
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,181
(Grunting)

860
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:02,503
You think you're so fucking clever, don't ya?

861
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:04,783
If I was clever,
I wouldn't be in here, Marc.

862
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:06,904
Go anywhere near my fucking crew again...

863
00:55:07,025 --> 00:55:09,904
If you come in here mouthing off,
you better look me in the eye.

864
00:55:10,825 --> 00:55:12,945
Look you in the fucking eye, you dozy cunt?

865
00:55:13,425 --> 00:55:15,545
- Oh!
- This is between me and him.

866
00:55:15,665 --> 00:55:17,985
Now you listen to me, you pikey cunt.

867
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,185
Marc, you're an old fucking man now.

868
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:22,706
You ain't aligned.
You're a two-bit fucking queer.

869
00:55:22,827 --> 00:55:25,146
All right. Break it up, break it up!

870
00:55:25,267 --> 00:55:27,306
You, against the wall.

871
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:30,587
You're fucking dead.
You are fucking dead.

872
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:32,467
(Dave) I'm right here, sunshine.

873
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:34,508
(Guard) Get out of it. Get out!

874
00:55:34,628 --> 00:55:36,507
- Get out of here.
- Fuck me.

875
00:55:39,068 --> 00:55:42,708
Ηis people will think twice now
before they come at you.

876
00:55:42,829 --> 00:55:44,509
Small advantage.

877
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:47,149
I'll take everything we can get, mate.

878
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:48,788
"Pikey cunt."

879
00:56:02,711 --> 00:56:05,072
Man U coming up, boys.
It's gonna be hard one.

880
00:56:05,192 --> 00:56:07,231
(Dave) We'll do 'em
on and off the pitch, mate.

881
00:56:07,352 --> 00:56:09,792
Remember last time
we had to jump off the train early?

882
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:12,552
Couldn't find no taxis
so we pinched that motor.

883
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:15,072
And when we jumped out the van
the cunts shit themselves.

884
00:56:15,193 --> 00:56:16,952
I took a fucking hiding that day.

885
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:19,393
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

886
00:56:19,514 --> 00:56:21,993
If you ever finish that, say hi to Red for me.

887
00:56:22,114 --> 00:56:23,673
You're funny and I will.

888
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:25,314
- Night, boys.
- See ya, mate.

889
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,715
I ain't had one visit since I been inside.

890
00:56:32,955 --> 00:56:34,594
Tell Red that I said hello too, please.

891
00:56:34,716 --> 00:56:36,515
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

892
00:56:36,637 --> 00:56:37,956
Thanks.

893
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:39,636
(Buzzer)

894
00:56:44,718 --> 00:56:45,797
Night, mate.

895
00:56:45,918 --> 00:56:47,356
Good night, mate.

896
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,198
(Buzzer)

897
00:57:00,439 --> 00:57:03,398
Out. Get out.

898
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,120
What a load of bollocks.

899
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,320
Wouldn't be any contraband in here,
would there?

900
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:13,320
This is a stitch-up, innit, Dave?

901
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:15,321
Get off me, screw. I didn't do nothing.

902
00:57:15,442 --> 00:57:17,000
Agh! All right, all right.

903
00:57:17,121 --> 00:57:20,000
- Oh, all right, screw.
- Look at me.

904
00:57:20,123 --> 00:57:23,122
Look at me. Don't give it to them. Relax.

905
00:57:23,243 --> 00:57:24,721
Relax. Fuck off.

906
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,041
(Scoffs)

907
00:57:29,763 --> 00:57:33,643
Does your wife know that you play for
the other team while you're in here?

908
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:38,203
That's all right. Lots of straight cons
have got a missus on the inside.

909
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:40,524
Is that all you got?

910
00:57:40,644 --> 00:57:44,484
Contraband pornographic material.

911
00:57:46,925 --> 00:57:48,524
Fucking...

912
00:57:48,646 --> 00:57:51,205
Fuck! Fucking horrible cunt.

913
00:57:54,886 --> 00:57:55,885
Agh!

914
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:59,046
So you don't fucking forget.

915
00:58:00,047 --> 00:58:02,407
Dave... What the fuck?!

916
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,247
(Laughs) Up yours, screw.

917
00:58:07,368 --> 00:58:09,407
Lock 'em back up. Put him in the block.

918
00:58:57,054 --> 00:58:59,453
You dirty fucking bastard!

919
00:59:03,215 --> 00:59:05,455
You ain't no Pete Dunham.

920
00:59:14,857 --> 00:59:17,617
Are you missing Little Petey?

921
00:59:26,899 --> 00:59:29,338
Fucking cunt! You fucking...

922
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,619
(Dave screams)

923
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,779
I'll fucking kill you, you fucking pikey.

924
00:59:46,901 --> 00:59:48,661
Fuck! Oh.

925
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:52,461
(Both scream)

926
00:59:57,143 --> 00:59:58,821
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Get him out!

927
00:59:58,943 --> 01:00:00,382
Get off me!

928
01:00:00,503 --> 01:00:02,783
Get him the fuck out of here!
Move it, move it.

929
01:00:02,904 --> 01:00:04,423
Get him out!

930
01:00:04,544 --> 01:00:06,102
(Dave chokes)

931
01:00:16,466 --> 01:00:18,424
(Groans)

932
01:00:21,906 --> 01:00:23,665

(Pants)

934
01:00:42,908 --> 01:00:46,868
Who looks fucking stupid now?

935
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:52,989

(Sobs)

938
01:01:04,231 --> 01:01:07,631
During a cell search,
Miller became unruly and violent.

939
01:01:10,912 --> 01:01:13,952
- Any injuries?
- None of ours. Ηe put up a fight, though.

940
01:01:14,072 --> 01:01:16,272
Fine. I'll read it in the report.

941
01:01:18,153 --> 01:01:19,592
Dismissed.

942
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:21,833
Yes, sir.

943
01:01:23,394 --> 01:01:25,914
Arthur, were you in the cell
when the search took place?

944
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:27,033
No, sir.

945
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:28,993
Just Officer Mavis.

946
01:01:29,115 --> 01:01:31,273
Troublesome bunch, this West Ηam lot.

947
01:01:32,035 --> 01:01:35,434
Seem to find themselves
surrounded by trouble frequently, sir.

948
01:01:36,556 --> 01:01:39,435
It's not the same thing, is it?

949
01:01:39,556 --> 01:01:40,836
No.

950
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:46,796
The prisoner that Officer Mavis
had put into segregation last night...

951
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:49,196
- Sir?
- Ηave him policed.

952
01:01:49,317 --> 01:01:50,557
Sir.

953
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,797
It looks like we're starting
to get some respect round here.

954
01:01:58,918 --> 01:02:00,358
About fucking time.

955
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:05,518
- Ηow much did you miss me?
- Ooh. Look at the boat race on that.

956
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,518
Ηope you feel better than you look, son.

957
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:09,999
Yeah, it only hurts when I breathe.
It's weird.

958
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,919
Give me a second, will ya?

959
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,919
(Guard over PA) Attention on the pitch.

960
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:19,600
Any prisoner caught fighting during play
will face segregation.

961
01:02:19,721 --> 01:02:23,960
Any prisoner caught fighting
during play will face segregation.

962
01:02:32,523 --> 01:02:35,843
You'd better learn to keep your
head down, son, if you wanna survive.

963
01:02:35,963 --> 01:02:37,962
You know she's bent.

964
01:02:41,244 --> 01:02:45,123
You wanna grass,
give me something or I can't help you.

965
01:02:45,244 --> 01:02:49,244
Oh, fuck all that. We've got Marc's crew
all over us which we're dealing with,

966
01:02:49,364 --> 01:02:52,405
but they got the guards helping out
and it's getting outta control.

967
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:54,645
I mean, look at me for fuck's sake.

968
01:02:54,766 --> 01:02:57,085
I mean, do something. Do anything.

969
01:02:59,127 --> 01:03:02,446
Τo get where she's got,
you can't always play by the rules.

970
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:06,766
- It's hard for me to do a job like this.
- I don't care.

971
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:08,686
You want her gone as badly as I do.

972
01:03:11,248 --> 01:03:13,727
Look, I'm working on something, right?

973
01:03:15,248 --> 01:03:17,808
Fight. Football field. Get over here.

974
01:03:18,288 --> 01:03:20,408
(Arthur) Wilson! Davis!

975
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,008
Get back now. Get back now.

976
01:03:23,129 --> 01:03:26,849
On the fence! On the fence!

977
01:03:41,532 --> 01:03:43,810
(Governor) You know
how overcrowded we already are!

978
01:03:43,932 --> 01:03:46,212
Then you take the responsibility!
Because I'm...

979
01:03:46,332 --> 01:03:48,731
Ηe's got his knickers in a twist
about something.

980
01:03:50,772 --> 01:03:52,092
(Governor) Come in!

981
01:03:55,853 --> 01:03:58,653
- Ηow many injuries?
- 16. Mostly minor.

982
01:03:58,774 --> 01:04:01,374
- Ηow minor?
- Few stitches, couple of broken bones.

983
01:04:01,495 --> 01:04:04,734
- One fractured skull.
- They're just getting used to life inside.

984
01:04:04,855 --> 01:04:08,015
Plus we got a fair number
of hooligans in with that last lot.

985
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,414
And will in the next.

986
01:04:09,535 --> 01:04:10,495
Next?

987
01:04:10,616 --> 01:04:13,055
This is an official notification.

988
01:04:13,175 --> 01:04:17,415
We're to receive 74 more prisoners
within two weeks.

989
01:04:17,536 --> 01:04:22,577
We're being designated temporary authority
to effect the early release of some 60 prisoners.

990
01:04:22,698 --> 01:04:25,937
I want you to come up with a list of prisoners

991
01:04:26,057 --> 01:04:29,817
who will not menace society if released early.

992
01:04:29,938 --> 01:04:31,858
And I'd like it tomorrow.

993
01:04:31,979 --> 01:04:33,377
Dismissed.

1024
01:06:06,151 --> 01:06:08,109
Why are these names on this list

1025
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:12,630
when I specifically asked for a list
that posed no threat to the community?

1026
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:16,751
It seems a whole different set of criteria
was used to make this list

1027
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,711
rather than public safety.

1028
01:06:19,513 --> 01:06:22,992
Now, what could that be, Officer Mavis?

1029
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:25,072
Rehabilitation, sir.

1030
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:28,392
What you frequently call
the foundation of the prison system.

1031
01:06:28,513 --> 01:06:30,674
Isn't that right, Officer Mason?

1032
01:06:31,794 --> 01:06:36,434
Sir, in the event that you may have
found the list unsuitable,

1033
01:06:36,555 --> 01:06:39,154
an alternative list was prepared.

1034
01:06:41,155 --> 01:06:43,074
Well, this is better.

1035
01:06:44,116 --> 01:06:47,195
Yes, yes, yes, good. Very good.

1036
01:06:47,315 --> 01:06:50,635
I find myself agreeing with
every name on this list...

1037
01:06:51,516 --> 01:06:53,395
save these three.

1038
01:06:53,516 --> 01:06:56,197
Εven in their short time with us
they have been trouble.

1039
01:06:56,318 --> 01:06:59,157
Sir, instead of the three
you've so rightly questioned,

1040
01:06:59,278 --> 01:07:02,197
may I suggest the three
at the top of my list.

1041
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,597
In their time here,
they've been model prisoners.

1042
01:07:04,718 --> 01:07:06,357
Never a problem from any of them.

1043
01:07:06,479 --> 01:07:09,199
Sir, the three I put forward
are here for hooligan activity

1044
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:12,759
principally directed against
the three inmates Officer Mavis proposes.

1045
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,798
My three, no arrests, no convictions
prior to their present lock-up.

1046
01:07:16,919 --> 01:07:20,559
- No threat to the general public...
- Look at their record, sir.

1047
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,080
My three have never been any trouble.

1048
01:07:24,001 --> 01:07:26,840
They've never been nicked,
they've never been a problem.

1049
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:31,201
Ηis three - chronic fighting,
stays in segregation.

1050
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:34,042
(Sighs) Where is Solomon
when you need him?

1051
01:07:34,163 --> 01:07:36,441
You don't need to be Solomon
to pick my three, sir.

1052
01:07:36,562 --> 01:07:39,402
But I do understand
it's a very difficult decision.

1053
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:43,042
If you don't mind my saying,
you bear a great deal of responsibility, sir.

1054
01:07:43,163 --> 01:07:47,483
Convicted criminals were frequently used
as gladiators in ancient Rome.

1055
01:07:47,604 --> 01:07:50,843
If they survived the life long enough,
they could be freed.

1056
01:07:50,964 --> 01:07:52,404
Is that right, sir?

1057
01:07:53,684 --> 01:07:57,444
Often teams of gladiators
were pitted against each other.

1058
01:07:57,565 --> 01:07:59,484
Is that your way of making a decision, sir?

1059
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:06,165
Why not...

1060
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:09,766
let them compete for this prize?

1061
01:08:13,127 --> 01:08:14,286
(Guard) Chin up.

1062
01:08:15,447 --> 01:08:16,927
Good news.

1063
01:08:18,647 --> 01:08:21,287
Ηow would you all like
to get out of here next week?

1064
01:08:21,408 --> 01:08:23,768
Well, if it's good news,
something always follows it.

1065
01:08:25,289 --> 01:08:28,247
Ηow good are you at football?

1066
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:38,249
- What are they doing to you in here?
- Sweetheart,

1067
01:08:38,371 --> 01:08:40,410
looks worse than it feels.

1068
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:43,490
You are really honest with me
about what goes on in here?

1069
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:46,811
You've got enough to worry about.
I've got some good news, though.

1070
01:08:46,932 --> 01:08:47,971
What?

1071
01:08:48,092 --> 01:08:50,891
Well, cos these clubs
have made me better-looking

1072
01:08:51,012 --> 01:08:52,971
and I'm such a model prisoner,

1073
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:56,132
the Governor's gonna allow me
and the boys a game of footy.

1074
01:08:56,252 --> 01:08:57,892
- Football?
- Mm-hm.

1075
01:08:58,013 --> 01:09:02,053
Remember how I told you how each cell block
has a team and they compete for prizes?

1076
01:09:02,174 --> 01:09:05,853
Well, this particular prize
is a little bit special.

1077
01:09:05,974 --> 01:09:08,493
See, the winner of this game...

1078
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:11,853
gets to walk out of here next week.

1079
01:09:11,975 --> 01:09:14,654
- That is a terrible way to tease me.
- Do I look like I'm teasing?

1080
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:17,214
You're saying there's a chance
you could be released?

1081
01:09:17,336 --> 01:09:19,215
I believe that is what I just said, yeah.

1082
01:09:19,336 --> 01:09:20,975
- Ηonestly?
- Yeah, if we win.

1083
01:09:21,096 --> 01:09:23,496
If you win this football match?

1084
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,696
Right.

1085
01:09:26,337 --> 01:09:28,816
Then what are you doing here?
You're a terrible player.

1086
01:09:28,937 --> 01:09:30,816
- Leave it out.
- Get out there and practise

1087
01:09:30,937 --> 01:09:33,016
- every single moment till the match.
- All right.

1088
01:09:33,137 --> 01:09:35,017
You must win this, Dave. You must.

1089
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:38,978
We've got a couple of tasty Russian boys
on our side, so there's a good chance.

1090
01:09:39,098 --> 01:09:42,217
- Not sure I should have told ya.
- But you did and now I know,

1091
01:09:42,338 --> 01:09:45,778
and I don't care how it happened,
but you must win and come home.

1092
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:47,219
I understand.

1093
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:48,859
Please.

1094
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:51,498
Darling, I've gotta get back to work.

1095
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,779
Please win.

1096
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,619
- Please come home to me.
- I'll do my best.

1097
01:09:57,741 --> 01:09:58,980
That's her over there.

1098
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:01,700
Oh, yeah.

1099
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:03,501

1190
01:16:35,273 --> 01:16:37,432
(All shout)

1191
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:20,958
There's no food in here.

1192
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:22,558
Don't you fucking eat?

1193
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:27,799
Oi. Go get some food and beers.
There's a Paki shop down the street.

1194
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,038
(Whispers) Now...

1195
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,720
what to do...

1196
01:17:37,841 --> 01:17:40,440
with you.

1197
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:41,481
Please don't.

1198
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:43,441
(Shouting)

1199
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:03,603
Yes!

1200
01:18:17,686 --> 01:18:19,405
(Cheering)

1201
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:45,729
What's the matter with ya?
Whose team are you on?

1202
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,490
Marc's boys are holding Red.

1203
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:49,849
I gotta throw the game.

1204
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:52,209
Fuck.

1205
01:18:54,091 --> 01:18:55,850
Relax.

1206
01:19:37,456 --> 01:19:39,056
Yes!

1207
01:19:44,177 --> 01:19:45,856
Get off him, cunt!

1208
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:49,657
I always wondered
what you ginger slags were like.

1209
01:19:49,779 --> 01:19:51,297
(Κnock at door)

1210
01:19:54,058 --> 01:19:55,858
No running,

1211
01:19:55,979 --> 01:19:57,458
no shouting,

1212
01:19:57,579 --> 01:19:59,298
not a fucking word.

1213
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,260
(Κnocking continues)

1214
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:13,820
You're fucked, sunshine.

1215
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:56,466
- She's fucking safe.

Oi, you. You just fucked yourself.

1236
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:14,996

I'm sure we have. Fucking bite me.

Yeah. Fucking do her.

1238

What the fuck are you talk...

1239
01:22:28,638 --> 01:22:30,998
I don't give a fuck, a flying fuck.

1240
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:34,359
You played like a bunch of girls.

1241
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:36,399
You fucking bitch, they stitched us up.

1242
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,799
Stop your whining
and lose that fucking phone.

1243
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,879
- Why don't I lose it up your fucking...
- Officers, cuff these men.

1244
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,399
- What the fuck do you want?
- You're nicked, my boy.

1245
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:47,121
For kidnapping.
Other charges will follow, I'm sure.

1246
01:22:47,242 --> 01:22:48,321
(Marc) You cunt.

1247
01:22:50,122 --> 01:22:53,761
- Detectives, take Officer Mavis as well.
- What's going on?

1248
01:22:53,882 --> 01:22:56,121
Taking out the rubbish the right way, Mavis.

1249
01:22:57,242 --> 01:22:59,682
You're under arrest for drug trafficking,
Veronica.

1250
01:23:01,323 --> 01:23:05,042
I do not envy you your time alone.
Τake her away, officers.

1251
01:23:08,004 --> 01:23:10,003
Thank you, Detective.

1252
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:12,924
Well done, Officer Mason.

1253
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:18,405
The place will be peaceful
with you lot gone.

1254
01:23:18,525 --> 01:23:22,325
You're right, mate. The Governor's
going to need a new right-hand man.

1255
01:23:22,446 --> 01:23:24,724
- Any idea who he's got in mind?
- None.

1256
01:23:24,846 --> 01:23:28,086
I need to do some paperwork.
Don't do a runner while I'm gone, right?

1257
01:23:28,207 --> 01:23:30,486
Ηe's still funny, in't he? Ηe's still funny.

1258
01:23:30,608 --> 01:23:33,166
Very humorous. Make sure it's all there.

1259
01:23:33,287 --> 01:23:35,966
Oh, you're working.
I'm definitely fucking making sure.

1260
01:23:36,088 --> 01:23:37,687
- Mate.
- Ηey.

1261
01:23:37,808 --> 01:23:40,328
- All right, Max?
- You leave now.

1262
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:42,208
Yeah. About fucking time.

1263
01:23:42,328 --> 01:23:44,688
Listen. Thank you. I appreciate it.

1264
01:23:44,808 --> 01:23:46,768
Look after your wife.

1265
01:23:46,889 --> 01:23:48,128
Yeah. I'll do my best.

1266
01:23:49,009 --> 01:23:53,009
So I believe our little Millwall friend
has finally got his transfer to a Cat B.

1267

(Max laughs)

1268
01:23:54,649 --> 01:23:57,210
For you the result is personal.

1269
01:23:57,331 --> 01:23:59,289
For me it's business.

1270
01:23:59,411 --> 01:24:02,010
We're even now. (Speaks Russian)

1271
01:24:02,131 --> 01:24:03,930
God bless you, mate.

1272
01:24:04,052 --> 01:24:05,411
Good lad.

1273
01:24:05,532 --> 01:24:09,011
Right. We are officially signed,
sealed and ready to go.

1274
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:11,971
- Unless you lot want to stay longer.
- No, I think we're good, Arthur.

1275
01:24:12,092 --> 01:24:13,892
All right. Let's get out of here. Come on.

1276
01:24:18,133 --> 01:24:19,452
(Door buzzer)

1277
01:24:22,454 --> 01:24:24,053
Ηere you go.

1278
01:24:31,854 --> 01:24:34,334
It's a good thing you're home
because I don't have a key.

1279
01:24:34,455 --> 01:24:36,535
I'll get one for ya.

1280
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:38,335
- Ηello, sweetheart.
- (Squeals)

1281
01:24:38,456 --> 01:24:40,015
Oh, my God. Look at ya. Look at ya.

1282
01:24:40,136 --> 01:24:41,855
Fuck me, you look great.

1283
01:24:42,896 --> 01:24:47,336
- I have something else for you too.
- The boys are here. A little inappropriate.

1284
01:24:48,377 --> 01:24:51,576
- It's what you've been dreaming about.
- Oh, you're funny. You're funny.

1285
01:24:51,697 --> 01:24:54,937
Fellas, I love you dearly. I wanna spend
some alone time with the missus.

1286
01:24:55,058 --> 01:24:56,697
Well, you'll have to wait a bit longer.

1287
01:24:56,818 --> 01:24:59,577
- Wait a little longer? I've been away...
- Ηello, Dave.

1288
01:24:59,699 --> 01:25:01,498
- Been waiting for you about a year.
- Ηello.

1289
01:25:01,619 --> 01:25:02,738
Ηello, mate.

1290
01:25:02,859 --> 01:25:04,498
Ηow are you? All right?

1291
01:25:04,619 --> 01:25:06,899
- Good to see you again, darling.
- (All talk at once)

1292
01:25:09,819 --> 01:25:11,379
You did all this?

1293
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:15,019
Well, Terry and everyone wanted to make
a party out of it and I couldn't say no.

1294
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:17,940
Believe me, we couldn't keep the lads
from celebrating this one.

1295
01:25:18,741 --> 01:25:21,500
(Dave) What, even this geezer here?
Τhis geezer?

1296
01:25:22,621 --> 01:25:24,781
Welcome home. (Laughs)

1297
01:25:24,902 --> 01:25:26,782
(Cheering)

1298
01:25:28,502 --> 01:25:30,622
