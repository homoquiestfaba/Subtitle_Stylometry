352
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,308

358
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,453
<b>I mean really predict the weather.</b>

359
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,288
<b>Excuse me. Are you in the second row</b>

360
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,190
<b>there? What's your name?</b>

361
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,726
<b>- Claire. - Claire.</b>

362
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,860
<b>We were about to have a break, Claire.</b>

363
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,162
<b>I wonder if you could put away the</b>

364
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,530
<b>newspaper until we have the break.</b>

365
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,498
<b>- I'll read and listen</b>

366
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:50,569
<b>at the same time. - Good.</b>

367
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,072
<b>So Lorenz used 12</b>

368
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,373
<b>variables in an equation</b>

369
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,475
<b>that he programmed into his computer to</b>

370
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,310
<b>try to make weather formulations.</b>

371
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,446
<b>And then one day, just to save time,</b>

372
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,414
<b>he reduced one of the</b>

373
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,384
<b>variables just by a small amount.</b>

374
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,753
<b>Just to save time, went off to have his</b>

375
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,290
<b>coffee, his morning coffee.</b>

376
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,224
<b>And when he came back</b>

377
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:12,691
<b>to his weather machine,</b>

378
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,694
<b>he found that his</b>

379
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,163
<b>shortcut had changed everything.</b>

380
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,500
<b>He saw from the printout, clearly, that</b>

381
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,969
<b>weather could never be predicted.</b>

382
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,904
<b>It was chaos.</b>

383
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,373
<b>Tiny things change everything.</b>

384
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:32,544
<b>Why, the flapping of butterflies' wings</b>

385
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,012
<b>could sometimes, maybe</b>

386
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,949
<b>other times not, produce</b>

387
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,784
<b>a change in air pressure that could</b>

388
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,118
<b>change the direction of the wind</b>

389
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,720
<b>that could bring on a storm.</b>

390
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,389
<b>In other words, if you go outside after</b>

391
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,925
<b>this class and whistle,</b>

392
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,628
<b>there's a tiny infinitesimal chance that</b>

393
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,364
<b>you could create a tornado</b>

394
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,866
<b>that would rip the roof off your house</b>

395
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,535
<b>and change your life forever.</b>

396
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,604
<b>So after this class, just do it.</b>

397
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,307
<b>Go outside and whistle.</b>

398
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,877
<b>And remember as you're doing it, how tiny</b>

399
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,914
<b>things can change everything.</b>

400
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,649
<b>Lights, please. We have some lights.</b>

401
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,153
<b>Thank you.</b>

402
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,755
<b>Miss Tamaranda, I just wanted</b>

403
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:17,990
<b>to thank you for your class.</b>

404
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,159
<b>I loved it a lot. Well, thank you.</b>

405
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,127
<b>I mean, I've never loved anything as much</b>

406
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,095
<b>as I loved you, class.</b>

407
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,930
<b>Well, thank you very much.</b>

408
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,568
<b>Okay. Thanks.</b>

409
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,236
<b>I like to...</b>

410
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,804
<b>She...</b>

411
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:36,375
<b>Bye.</b>

412
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,309
<b>So, you're not going to tell</b>

413
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,677
<b>Mike about the class, right?</b>

414
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,645
<b>I already told them.</b>

415
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,013
<b>Oh, well, please tell</b>

416
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,214
<b>them not to tell Rick, okay?</b>

417
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,383
<b>I thought you told Rick.</b>

418
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,284
<b>I thought Rick said</b>

419
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,885
<b>yeah, and it was okay.</b>

420
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,055
<b>Oh, listen. When you get home,</b>

421
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:50,856
<b>please make sure you</b>

422
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,758
<b>tell Mike not to tell Rick.</b>

423
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,994
<b>So Mike's not going to be home anyway.</b>

424
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:59,064
<b>Again?</b>

425
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,265
<b>Yeah, you know, I guess</b>

426
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,100
<b>every couple has a rough patch,</b>

427
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,437
<b>and we have one big, long one that</b>

428
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,738
<b>started the day we got married, right?</b>

429
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,976
<b>It's good he's not home anymore,</b>

430
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,144
<b>'cause, you know, all</b>

431
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,745
<b>he's ever done when he's home</b>

432
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:14,479
<b>lately is just sit on</b>

433
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,248
<b>the couch and be swale.</b>

434
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,483
<b>You know, Rick watches a lot of TV, too.</b>

435
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,851
<b>Yeah. Well, Mike's stiffer</b>

436
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,653
<b>than TV, and then he snores.</b>

437
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,455
<b>Rick clicks his teeth. That's worse.</b>

438
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,490
<b>Oh, man. The other night, I thought I</b>

439
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,625
<b>heard a train coming.</b>

440
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,227
<b>It wasn't a train. It was him snoring.</b>

441
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:33,565
<b>It was so fucking loud.</b>

442
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,067
<b>Well, Rick has the end room.</b>

443
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:35,734
<b>Mike has pimples on his ass.</b>

444
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,705
<b>Rick forgets to brush his teeth.</b>

445
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,174
<b>Ew. Mike smells pretty bad.</b>

446
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,709
<b>He smells like a locker room.</b>

447
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,311
<b>Mike smells clean. He wears a broom.</b>

448
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,746
<b>Yeah, I like your own boots, all right.</b>

449
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,281
<b>But he yells a lot. I</b>

450
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,749
<b>mean, I say, "Can I do this?"</b>

451
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:55,387
<b>No. "Can I do that?" No.</b>

452
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,690
<b>Okay. See? He was very interested.</b>

453
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,592
<b>Okay. Thank you for coming.</b>

454
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,727
<b>We'll come talk to you tomorrow, okay?</b>

455
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:06,465
<b>Okay. All right.</b>

456
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,468
<b>Would you have a lever?</b>

457
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,237
<b>No, man. I would leave my own.</b>

458
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,639
<b>I was just making fun of him. You know,</b>

459
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,541
<b>it's the way I get it out.</b>

460
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:29,288
<b>Okay. Good night.</b>

461
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,156
<b>Please do not go to the locker room.</b>

462
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,492
<b>You have third period study hall today.</b>

463
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:38,163
<b>You must report to the gym.</b>

464
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,433
<b>Julie, what are you doing in here?</b>

465
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,167
<b>Okay. Here's what I was</b>

466
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,769
<b>thinking about, though.</b>

467
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:44,736
<b>Functions are like an oven.</b>

468
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,506
<b>And what you put in the</b>

469
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,774
<b>variables, you let it bake,</b>

470
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,475
<b>and then what comes out is something</b>

471
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,611
<b>different. Is that it?</b>

472
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,079
<b>One second.</b>

473
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,149
<b>How long have you been working at this?</b>

474
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,050
<b>Only about three</b>

475
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,618
<b>weeks. I love it, though.</b>

476
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,853
<b>Wait. Here it is.</b>

477
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,188
<b>Here it is. I wanted to show you this</b>

478
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,691
<b>gorgeous picture of fractal.</b>

479
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:06,591
<b>You've learned all</b>

480
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,827
<b>this in only three weeks?</b>

481
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,494
<b>Did you ever think</b>

482
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,364
<b>about going to college?</b>

483
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:12,731
<b>Me?</b>

484
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,300
<b>Well, sure.</b>

485
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,369
<b>There's a class here you could take,</b>

486
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,970
<b>help you pass the G.E.D.s, and then you</b>

487
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,775
<b>could apply for college.</b>

488
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,577
<b>Rick wouldn't go for it.</b>

489
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:35,721
<b>Do you always do what Rick says?</b>

490
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,288
<b>No!</b>

491
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,591
<b>What are you doing? Stop it!</b>

492
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,625
<b>No, Matty, don't!</b>

493
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,061
<b>I didn't tell him to come back in here!</b>

494
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,163
<b>It's helped you grow up, okay?</b>

495
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,565
<b>You're out of your mind, you know that?</b>

496
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,265
<b>I'm gonna teach you a</b>

497
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,900
<b>lesson this time, okay?</b>

498
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,835
<b>See, our life is</b>

499
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,002
<b>without me for a change, huh?</b>

500
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,338
<b>You're a freakin' lunatic!</b>

501
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:53,939
<b>Fuck!</b>

502
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,974
<b>You're responsible for</b>

<b>your fuckin' actions, okay?</b>

504
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:57,976
<b>So this is the end of it.</b>

505
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:58,910
<b>This is the end for me, okay?</b>

506
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,245
<b>You got it?</b>

507
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,247
<b>Shut up, Rick!</b>

00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,115
<b>You know what? I'm teaching</b>

00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,146
<b>I think I passed it.</b>

890
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:02,647
<b>You think you passed it?</b>

891
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,447
<b>I don't know.</b>

892
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,215
<b>The grammar.</b>

893
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,083
<b>The grammar. That grammar, yes.</b>

894
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:06,484
<b>Yes.</b>

895
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:07,985
<b>You'll call me tonight, you promise?</b>

00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,526
<b>Okay, sure.</b>

902

<b>Julie, come here.</b>

903
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:17,361
<b>I don't suppose you</b>

<b>Um...</b>

906
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,513
<b>An encryption algorithm.</b>

<b>A what?</b>

908
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,984
<b>She just wrote an encryption algorithm.</b>

909
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,986
<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>I'm not thirsty, okay?</b>

918
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:11,682
<b>And I'm not hungry.</b>

<b>to go to Jose's house.</b>

924
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,224
<b>I thought going to Jose's house was your</b>

<b>I mean, why do I have to go?</b>

931
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,739
<b>Why does Lisa have to go?</b>

<b>Absolutely. They have</b>

<b>a scholarship program.</b>

<b>physics, biology, calculus.</b>

993
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,408
<b>I really could get into Stevens.</b>

994
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,644
<b>You could get in anywhere you want. MIT,</b>

995
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,212

<b>You don't realize the capacity you have.</b>

997
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:03,921
<b>Here. Let's look at some of these.</b>

998
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,890
<b>Mr. Rand, are you like the</b>

00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,158
<b>best teacher I've ever...</b>

1000
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,330
<b>Um... Um... I just want</b>

1001
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,133
<b>to... Can I ask you something?</b>

1002
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:19,403
<b>It's, um... It's personal.</b>

1003
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,538
<b>Yeah, sure.</b>

1004
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,674
<b>I feel... I've never</b>

1005
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,776
<b>felt this way about, um...</b>

1006
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,712
<b>I'm explaining this.</b>

1007
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,181
<b>I think I'm in love with this person, and</b>

1008
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,050
<b>I'm in love with this person,</b>

1009
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,552
<b>and I really got to</b>

1010
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,319
<b>put it out of my mind.</b>

1011
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,020
<b>I mean, I just got to</b>

1012
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,754
<b>put it out of my mind,</b>

1013
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,023
<b>and I should, but I can't,</b>

1014
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,691
<b>and I don't know what to do.</b>

1015
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,160
<b>I'm just... I... Yeah?</b>

1016
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,863
<b>I think I know who you're talking about.</b>

1017
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:46,864
<b>You do?</b>

1018
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,366
<b>Yeah. And this person</b>

1019
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,935
<b>likes you very much as well.</b>

1020
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,236
<b>Is attracted to you, is</b>

1021
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,904
<b>very attracted to you.</b>

1022
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,107
<b>And sometimes feels in a mutual way.</b>

1023
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:01,812
<b>But I must confess, I, um...</b>

1024
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,281
<b>I once had a romance,</b>

1025
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,749
<b>or an affair, I suppose.</b>

1026
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,985
<b>I would have to call it an affair.</b>

1027
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,186
<b>With a student, an adult</b>

1028
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,388
<b>student, not unlike you.</b>

1029
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:16,594
<b>And, um... I hurt the student very badly.</b>

1030
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,563
<b>My wife... She, uh... She</b>

1031
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,799
<b>still hasn't gotten over it.</b>

1032
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,935
<b>I can't say that I've gotten over it.</b>

1033
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,236
<b>In fact, every morning,</b>

1034
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,338
<b>when I look in the mirror,</b>

1035
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,807
<b>I can't stop asking myself.</b>

1036
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,542
<b>Mr. Miranda?</b>

1037
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:32,376
<b>Students just shouldn't</b>

1038
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:33,510
<b>fall in love with teachers,</b>

1039
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,778
<b>and the teacher shouldn't</b>

1040
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,946
<b>fall in love with students.</b>

1041
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,047
<b>It... It, uh... But it</b>

1042
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,450
<b>does happen. Oh, it does.</b>

1043
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,250
<b>The student's not really</b>

1044
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:40,918
<b>in love with the teacher.</b>

1045
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,152
<b>You have to understand.</b>

1046
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,654
<b>They're in love with the subject matter.</b>

1047
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:44,521
<b>They don't realize it.</b>

1048
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,323
<b>Oh, of course, the teacher does often</b>

1049
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:47,424
<b>seem larger than life.</b>

1050
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:49,126
<b>I understand that.</b>

1051
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,260
<b>But at home, I have to tell</b>

00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,862
<b>you, when I'm not teaching,</b>

1053
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:54,231
<b>I'm just a normal, boring guy.</b>

1054
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,532
<b>Take it from me. I'm so</b>

1055
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,769
<b>boring that I even bore myself.</b>

1056
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,739
<b>Um... Do you think I'm in love with you?</b>

1057
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,110
<b>You're, uh... You're not?</b>

1058
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:12,016
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>Well, is that so unusual?</b>

1060
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,187
<b>Yes. I'm sorry.</b>

1061
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:22,893

00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,009
<b>My friend Claire.</b>

1067
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,546
<b>Oh. Right.</b>

<b>Disgusted. Not at all.</b>

1071
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,354
<b>But it's...</b>

1072
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,088
<b>What?</b>

1073
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:54,925
<b>Averted. What? I don't think so.</b>

1074
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:55,893
<b>Everybody says it's...</b>

1075
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,594
<b>No, I'm not... I'm not everybody.</b>

1076
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,664
<b>Really? I mean, I've had many students</b>

1077
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,633

1078
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,101
<b>Many? Mm-hmm.</b>

1079
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,503
<b>What are you selling?</b>

1080
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,906
<b>Oh, I don't know.</b>

1081
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:12,176
<b>Not much, I guess. I suppose I say...</b>

1082
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,878
<b>Some people.</b>

1083
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,281
<b>It's just the way they are.</b>

1084
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,515
<b>Yeah, you know, there's this girl,</b>

00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,651
<b>Charlene, in high school.</b>

1086
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,352
<b>And, um, something written,</b>

1087
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,654
<b>"Dike and the Lock and the Lock"</b>

1088
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,824
<b>and everybody was just really mean to her</b>

1089
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:27,891
<b>and calling her pervert</b>

1090
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,026
<b>and they're like, "We're not gonna stop</b>

00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:32,196
<b>till she stops being perverted."</b>

1092
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,531
<b>And that day that that was on the locker,</b>

1093
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,733
<b>everybody was laughing.</b>

1094
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:55,586
<b>Were you? Were you laughing?</b>

1095
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,287
<b>They let you stay here. And when you go</b>

1096
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,055
<b>out, just close the</b>

1097
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:02,025

1098
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:02,693
<b>Where are you going?</b>

1099
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:17,474
<b>You have some work to do.</b>

<b>Hey, Mom, congratulations.</b>

1102
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:22,446
<b>No, don't say that. I</b>

1415
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,480
<b>How's the studying going, Claire?</b>

1416
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,850
<b>- I'm doing an equation.</b>

1417
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,051
<b>It's really hard.</b>

1418
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,619
<b>- Test it, number two.</b>

1419
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:37,987
<b>Tell us all about yourself.</b>

1420
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,989

01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,057
<b>and I'm originally from</b>

1422
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,325
<b>Walla Walla Watch and--</b>

1423
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:44,827
<b>- Wait a second there, Mary Jo.</b>

1424
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,095
<b>Walla what?</b>

1425
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,563
<b>- Walla Walla Watch and Rick--</b>

1426
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,031
<b>- Mary Jo, how can I explain this to you?</b>

1427
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:50,433
<b>No one-- - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - What's the cleanest to you?</b>

01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,034
<b>No one is from Walla</b>

01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,339

<b>extremely rapid rate.</b>

1435
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:03,713
<b>In fact, as we look at</b>

1436
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:04,881
<b>the evolution of the planet</b>

1437
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,816
<b>from around 8,000 BCE</b>

1438
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,351
<b>until the present day,</b>

1439
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:09,719
<b>we see that the amount of</b>

<b>change that has taken place</b>

1441
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,522
<b>over the last 2,000 years</b>

01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,390

<b>up until that point in</b>

1444
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:17,026
<b>the planet's lifespan.</b>

1445
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,595
<b>North America and Asia have shifted</b>

1446
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:20,563
<b>further apart recently</b>

1447
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:21,964
<b>at an incredible rate.</b>

1448
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,733
<b>In fact, at this rate,</b>

1449
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,234
<b>there could be a land bridge</b>

1450
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:25,968
<b>between the eastern</b>

01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,805

<b>(indistinct chatter)</b>

1455
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:03,039
<b>- Notice how the smoke</b>

1456
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,006
<b>flows smoothly off the end</b>

1457
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,676
<b>of the cigarette.</b>

1458
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:07,643
<b>Right about here, it breaks</b>

1459
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:10,713
<b>into a kind of wild turbulence.</b>

1460
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,048
<b>Like a river flowing down a mountain,</b>

1461
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:15,251
<b>the way it breaks into rapids.</b>

1462
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:16,052
<b>Rapids?</b>

1463
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,453
<b>Can we see the slide?</b>

1464
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:18,988
<b>Good.</b>

1465
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:20,790
<b>Now, it's very difficult for</b>

1466
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,658
<b>physicists to study turbulence</b>

1467
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:25,728
<b>because like weather, it has no rules.</b>

1468
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,463
<b>It's--the motion ever repeats itself.</b>

1469
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:28,798
<b>It's chaotic.</b>

1470
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,766
<b>Now, our friend, Lorentz,</b>

1471
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:32,168
<b>he was able to reduce the</b>

1472
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:33,169
<b>turbulence of boiling water</b>

1473
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,438
<b>to three very simple variables,</b>

1474
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:36,339
<b>which he was able to</b>

1475
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,574
<b>chart and trace over time.</b>

1476
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,209
<b>Now, this is chaos here.</b>

1477
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,010
<b>There's a picture of it.</b>

1478
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,247
<b>It doesn't look like chaos, does it?</b>

1479
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:48,050
<b>Or maybe the look of chaos has a pattern.</b>

1480
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,621
<b>- I'm home!</b>

1481
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,056

1482
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,558

<b>Claire?</b>

1487
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,268
<b>- Claire, I found a way to explain</b>

1488
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,603
<b>what I was talking about last night.</b>

1489
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:08,037
<b>Okay.</b>

1490
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:11,674
<b>Okay.</b>

1491
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:15,611
<b>The mountain is stable.</b>

1492
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,514
<b>The falling sand is not.</b>

1493
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,316
<b>At one point, the edge of</b>

1494
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,018

1495
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,119
<b>and when and how,</b>

1496
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,291
<b>that's what chaos is, edges.</b>

1497
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:34,330
<b>- I missed my friends.</b>

1498
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:35,865
<b>- I'm--I'm your friend?</b>

1499

<b>I--yeah, I used to have more than one.</b>

<b>I've had these friends for my whole life.</b>

1504
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:52,848
<b>- Okay, I got an idea, okay?</b>

1505
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:54,817

01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:01,357

01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:43,886
<b>She can fucking see us.</b>

1588
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,054
<b>- What's there to see?</b>

1589
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:46,255
<b>- She can fucking see</b>

1590
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:46,989
<b>us. She's not stupid.</b>

1591
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,491
<b>It's written all over us.</b>

1592
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:49,458
<b>- What?</b>

1593
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,993
<b>- Just get the fuck away from me.</b>

1594
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:51,827
<b>- I'm not even there yet.</b>

1595
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:52,561

1597
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,030
<b>Just leave me the fuck alone.</b>

1598
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,966
<b>- There's nothing to see. She's--</b>

1599
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,534
<b>- She can fucking tell.</b>

1600
01:08:58,534 --> 01:08:59,468
<b>- She's stopped. She's</b>

1601
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,870
<b>looking straight ahead of her.</b>

1602
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,972
<b>- She's pulling away.</b>

1603
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,808
<b>- She can fucking tell.</b>

1604
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:06,976
<b>- Claire.</b>

1605
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:11,046
<b>[sighs]</b>

1606

<b>[clanging]</b>

1607
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:26,061
<b>- Yes.</b>

1608
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:28,464
<b>Yes, that's absolutely correct.</b>

1609
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,865
<b>Very good.</b>

<b>Have a seat.</b>

1611
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:41,143
<b>You know, I'm a big</b>

<b>He's very impressed with you.</b>

1614
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,550
<b>And I think quickly solving a few</b>

01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,584
<b>multi-task equations</b>

1616
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:50,252
<b>is very impressive.</b>

1617
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:52,288
<b>But I don't know if</b>

1618
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:53,689
<b>that makes you a genius.</b>

1619
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,924
<b>You know, people who make real</b>

<b>- You're a little over the hill.</b>

1623
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:04,533
<b>- I don't know if we know</b>

1624
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:17,580
<b>yet what I'm capable of.</b>

1625
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,548
<b>- Hey, where are you going?</b>

1626
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,649

<b>- Who's Joe?</b>

1628
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:22,585
<b>- My boyfriend.</b>

1629

<b>Oh, Mom, you've got to see Claire.</b>

1630
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:28,657
<b>She looks beautiful.</b>

<b>- Shit.</b>

1636
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:48,811
<b>Two minds.</b>

1637
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:49,979
<b>- What?</b>

1638
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:51,280
<b>I gotta be there 20 minutes.</b>

1639
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,014
<b>- Where?</b>

1640
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:54,650
<b>- I'm going to Sally's.</b>

1641
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,252
<b>- You were gonna study tonight.</b>

1642
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,720
<b>- Okay, well, you know what?</b>

1643
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,554
<b>I haven't been invited</b>

1644
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,388
<b>over there in a long time,</b>

1645
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:00,656
<b>and so I changed my minds.</b>

1646
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:02,124
<b>- You gotta study, Claire.</b>

1647
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:03,259
<b>- Yeah, not tonight I don't.</b>

1648
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,127
<b>- You're not gonna pass the GED test.</b>

1649
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,562
<b>- Okay, that test isn't for two and a</b>

1650
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:07,429
<b>half more weeks, right?</b>

1651
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,498
<b>- You have a lot to learn.</b>

1652
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:11,133
<b>How do you expect to pass the test?</b>

1653
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:13,135
<b>- Julie, I'm gonna go over to Sally's.</b>

1654
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:14,303
<b>I'm gonna go and I'm gonna</b>

1655
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:18,574
<b>hang out with my friends.</b>

1656
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:20,876
<b>- You bored of me?</b>

1657
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,212
<b>- No.</b>

1658
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:25,581
<b>- Then why'd you stay at home?</b>

1659
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:26,482
<b>- Because I'm really</b>

1660
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:27,683
<b>sick of staying at home.</b>

1661
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:28,751
<b>- You bored of me?</b>

1662
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,953
<b>- Look, normal people do not stay home</b>

1663
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:31,553
<b>every single night of</b>

1664
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:32,388
<b>their lives, all right?</b>

1665
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,089
<b>Normal people go out and</b>

1666
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:35,424
<b>they party with their friends.</b>

1667
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:37,493
<b>- We're not normal.</b>

1668
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:39,495
<b>- Okay, I don't know about you, right?</b>

1669
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:40,429
<b>But I'm normal.</b>

1670
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:41,964
<b>- What do you mean by that?</b>

1671
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,365
<b>- It means I want to have fun.</b>

1672
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:44,433
<b>It means I want to have</b>

1673
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,235
<b>fun with normal people.</b>

1674
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:48,804
<b>Normal fun with normal people.</b>

1675
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:49,738
<b>And if I have to stay in</b>

1676
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:50,039
<b>this house one more night,</b>

1677
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,841
<b>I talk about phase</b>

1678
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:53,575
<b>transitions and fractals.</b>

1679
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,377
<b>I am gonna fucking go out of my mind.</b>

1680
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:56,812
<b>- Oh, and what are you gonna</b>

1681
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,613
<b>talk about with your friends?</b>

1682
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,515
<b>The same things you talk about with me?</b>

1683
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:00,315
<b>Who's having an</b>

01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:02,184
<b>affair with who hairstyles?</b>

1685
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:03,419
<b>Maybe sometimes I go</b>

<b>out of my mind with you.</b>

1687
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,555
<b>Sometimes maybe I think you're stupid.</b>

1688
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:07,656
<b>- Okay, you are not</b>

1689
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:08,524
<b>better than other people,</b>

1690
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:09,258
<b>Julie Johnson.</b>

1691
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:10,025
<b>You are not.</b>

1692
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:11,093
<b>You can sit around and</b>

1693
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:12,294
<b>you can spout your shit</b>

1694
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,929
<b>about fractals and chaos</b>

1695
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:15,230
<b>theory and iterated recursion.</b>

<b>What the fuck, Abba?</b>

1697
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:18,867
<b>But you are not better than me.</b>

1698
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:20,336
<b>- Oh, Jesus.</b>

1699
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,270
<b>- What are you doing?</b>

1700
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,304
<b>- You want to be with your friends?</b>

1701
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,173
<b>Be with your friends.</b>

1702
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:24,740
<b>- You can't go.</b>

1703
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:25,874
<b>- Why?</b>

1704
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:27,009
<b>- 'Cause you weren't invited.</b>

1705
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,277
<b>- Well, of course you were me.</b>

1706
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,312
<b>They wouldn't even know a thing.</b>

1707
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:31,013
<b>- Julie.</b>

1708
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,047
<b>- I won't even look at you.</b>

1709
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,649
<b>- Roommate, okay?</b>

1710
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,084
<b>You can't go.</b>

1711
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,485
<b>- They're my friends too, Claire.</b>

1712
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:41,390
<b>- Not anymore.</b>

1713
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,025
<b>No one knows you anymore, Julie.</b>

1714
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:49,631
<b>I don't even know you anymore.</b>

1715
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:53,302
<b>- Okay, but first, can</b>

1716
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:54,403
<b>I show you something?</b>

1717
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:55,204
<b>- I gotta go.</b>

1718
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,672
<b>- No, first, let me,</b>

1719
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,040
<b>listen, Claire, listen.</b>

1720
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,410
<b>Let me show you something, okay?</b>

1721
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,144
<b>You're not gonna like it</b>

1722
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:03,445
<b>in the beginning, okay?</b>

1723
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:04,012
<b>But if you can keep</b>

1724
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:05,347
<b>your temper from blowing,</b>

1725
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:06,348
<b>I think when I've got</b>

1726
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:07,549
<b>the whole thing explained,</b>

1727
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,051
<b>I think you're gonna maybe like it a lot,</b>

1728
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:14,623
<b>like I think you're gonna like it.</b>

1729
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:18,327
<b>Okay.</b>

1730
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:21,497
<b>Okay, so...</b>

1731
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,165
<b>So next year, hopefully</b>

1732
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:24,833
<b>I'll be going to Stevens.</b>

1733
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,168
<b>You'll be going to Jersey City College</b>

1734
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:27,069
<b>or wherever you want.</b>

1735
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:27,770
<b>- Look, I need to go</b>

1736
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,138
<b>see my friends, okay?</b>

1737
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:31,540
<b>- Okay, but we get new friends.</b>

1738
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,108
<b>We get New York City friends, okay?</b>

1739
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:33,809
<b>That's part of it.</b>

1740
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,211
<b>Listen, just listen, please, Claire.</b>

1741
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:38,046
<b>Okay, I made this chart because</b>

1742
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,483
<b>I was thinking, well, you always say</b>

1743
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:43,285
<b>you'd make a great lawyer, and it's true.</b>

1744
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:44,853
<b>You got great arguing skills.</b>

1745
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:47,089
<b>So I got to thinking, is it possible?</b>

1746
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,459
<b>Is it possible we go to college together?</b>

1747
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,227
<b>So here it is.</b>

1748
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:53,328
<b>Here.</b>

1749
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:56,565
<b>So you go to classes three nights a week,</b>

1750
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:57,466
<b>and you study the other</b>

1751
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:59,334
<b>two nights and on Saturday,</b>

1752
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,203
<b>and then weekend nights and Sunday,</b>

1753
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:02,104
<b>we have it off and we</b>

1754
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,405
<b>spend with the kids.</b>

1755
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,607
<b>Okay, and then I've divided up the chores</b>

1756
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:06,041
<b>between Frank and Lisa and us</b>

1757
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:07,876
<b>because they've got to</b>

1758
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:08,677
<b>help with the chores.</b>

1759
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,746
<b>And then over here, I figured out</b>

1760
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:12,648
<b>how we're going to pay for this.</b>

<b>It's better than when</b>

1941
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:11,926
<b>I was drinking today.</b>

1942
01:22:11,926 --> 01:22:12,594
<b>Yeah, none more of</b>

1944
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:22,370
<b>It's good though, huh?</b>

1945
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:27,609
<b>So Frankie's not</b>

01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,912
<b>sleeping so good, you know?</b>

1947
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:33,682
<b>I had a little talk with him,</b>

1948
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:39,621
<b>and Frankie, Frankie</b>

1949
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,023
<b>thinks you're a lesbian.</b>

1950
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:51,733
<b>No.</b>

1951
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:54,269
<b>Yeah, I should know, right?</b>

1952
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:55,303
<b>Stupid rumor.</b>

1953
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,137
<b>Yeah, but you know, that's</b>

1954
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:58,406
<b>why I told Frankie, you know?</b>

1955
01:22:58,406 --> 01:22:59,607
<b>I mean, people talk.</b>

1956
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:01,910
<b>They say stupid things.</b>

1957
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,511
<b>Yeah, I told him you just can't listen to</b>

1958
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:07,515
<b>that shit, you know?</b>

1959
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:10,618
<b>There's three conditions to chaos.</b>

1960
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:11,052
<b>The first is that it's a</b>

1961
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:14,489
<b>sensitive to initial conditions.</b>

1962
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:15,590
<b>The second is that</b>

1963
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,792
<b>it's periodically dense.</b>

1964
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:21,029
<b>And the third is dense transitive.</b>

1965
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:23,498
<b>You know, you lost me there, sweetie.</b>

1966
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:24,666
<b>How can I show you a</b>

1967
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:25,133
<b>computer-generated image?</b>

1968
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,634
<b>You know, it's all right.</b>

1969
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:28,136
<b>I don't really care for that</b>

1970
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:33,007
<b>kind of talk anyway, you know?</b>

1971
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:35,510
<b>It's a nice night though, huh?</b>

1972
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,112
<b>Yeah.</b>

1973
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:38,413
<b>Beautiful.</b>

1974
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:42,650
<b>It's like you.</b>

1975

<b>Okay, so...</b>

1976
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:45,086
<b>So maybe I could come in</b>

<b>for a little bit, you know?</b>

1978
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:48,456
<b>Not tonight.</b>

1979
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:48,890
<b>No?</b>

1980
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:50,392
<b>No.</b>

1981
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:51,826
<b>Sooner, right?</b>

1982
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:52,927
<b>Hopefully.</b>

1983
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:53,995
<b>Yeah, hopefully so.</b>
