1
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:28,420
Yeah, who is it?

2
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:32,292
<i>Esteban!
¿Como estas, hermano?</i>

3
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,862
Yeah, I'm just drivin' back
from the ranch.

4
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,498
Got everything handled
with all the business.

5
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,633
Everything's a go.

6
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,437
Yeah?

7
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:47,439
<i>Come on, hermano,
I don't like surprises,</i>

8
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,608
and I don't want no birthday
gifts, man.

9
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:54,246
I'm frickin' in my 40s. I don't
need a damn surprise party, man.

10
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:02,155
<i>I just want to... Hey, this month
is about makin' la feria, man.</i>

11
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,356
Forget about it.
Just tell everybody to cancel.

12
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,192
I don't want a birthday party,
man.

13
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:13,632
Okay.

14
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:16,668
Okay, okay.

15
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,232
Esteban.

16
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:47,733
<i>Mija.</i>

17
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:52,471
What are you guys doing?
What kind of party is this?

18
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:01,247
<i>Esteban, mija, you could've gotten
rid of some of these candles,</i>

19
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,650
at least put them out!

20
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:09,722
<i>Chingao, that's pretty good.</i>

21
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,859
Esteban?

22
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,197
Now, you know I don't like
these surprises?

23
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,799
What the hell?

24
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,980
What?

25
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:38,585
What the hell are you doing,

26
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,986
What the fuck?

27
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,421
Where's my daughter?!

28
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,690
Where's my daughter?!
Who are you?!

29
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:47,393
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

30
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:50,829
Mr. Zelman, I finished my job.
I can go, yes?

31
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:53,865
No, you stay,
and shut your beaner ass up

32
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:57,302
and let's get down to the
business at hand. Sit down.

33
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,673
Where is my daughter?
Where the fuck is she?!

34
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:02,974
Juan, you're not a traitor.

35
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:06,346
<i>No lo creo, no lo creo.</i>

36
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:08,546
Let's get down
to the business at hand.

37
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,715
Where's my daughter?

38
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:13,953
Mr. Solis, don't you smell
the garbage in the hallway?

39
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:15,787
-I'll kill all of you!
-Shut up.

40
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,725
Shut the fuck up.

41
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:22,728
Motherfucker!

42
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,999
No, no.
Don't you mean "daughterfucker"?

43
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,336
Hey, you better straighten up
and fly right,

44
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,004
you fuckin' one-eyed spic.

45
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:35,908
I'm not here on my business,
all right?

46
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,744
I'm here doing a favor for the
chinks. I owe 'em one.

47
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:42,615
And this is a 10-year debt
that I'm settling.

48
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:47,987
You stir-fried the wrong
fucking chink, didn't you?

49
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,822
I'm just a gun for hire, Mr.
Solis.

50
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,924
Woo King started that battle.

51
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:56,295
My family only answered
to instigation, and you know it!

52
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,564
My daughter!

53
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:03,768
I'm gonna cut your head off
if you don't kill me.

54
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,705
Kill me. Do it!

55
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:07,839
So, I guess a blow job's
out of the question?

56
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,011
Sir, can I just blast his face
off?

57
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:15,413
No, no, no. I'd like to oblige
you, Mick, but we can't do that.

58
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:18,384
The deal is we deliver him
alive.

59
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:22,854
Mr. Woo wants revenge
for his son,

60
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:25,423
so we got to take you
to the chink warehouse,

61
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:28,060
and they got some deep-rooted
plans for you, buddy,

62
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:29,895
and for your little spring roll.

63
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:31,096
They're gonna slice it off,

64
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:34,566
and Mr. Woo's gonna cook it up
in a wok, like Chinese sausage,

65
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,069
then he's gonna eat it right in front
of you while you're still alive.

66
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:39,404
And he's gonna invite some
guests.

67
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:42,641
Man, these chinks.

68
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:45,411
When they go after revenge,
it's balls to the wall.

69
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,079
Get him up! Get up!

70
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,915
-Get up, Mick.
-Get up. Stand him up.

71
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,560
I knew you weren't a traitor.
I knew it, Juan.

72
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:03,795
They took my daughter.

73
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,799
<i>That's the only reason
I was under the gun, carnal.</i>

74
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:08,533
I understand.
You know I got you covered.

75
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:11,537
Mr. Zelman, just say green
light, and I'll blast him.

76
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,139
You think you're gonna take me
out? Come on.

77
00:06:13,404 --> 00:06:15,107
You two burritos
think you can blast me away

78
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,042
before my guy gets you?
Come on.

79
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:18,142
This guy's ex-CIA.

80
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,646
He was a sharpshooter before I
started to pay him more.

81
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:21,980
He might hit me,

82
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,617
but you're going down with me,
you punk-ass motherfucker.

83
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:27,485
You took my daughter.
My boys got her back.

84
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,456
Now you got two dead hillbillies
in your home right now.

85
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:33,024
You're going to hillbilly hell,
motherfucker.

86
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,996
<i>Your cojones
are gonna get you killed.</i>

87
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:39,564
I never liked it here anyway.

88
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:45,437
Dumb Mexican.
You got no gun, beaner.

89
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,105
Come on out!

90
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,503
Come on, motherfucker.

91
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,500
<i>Amor.</i>

92
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:23,868
They killed...

93
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:27,105
They killed everybody...
Esteban, my wife...

94
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,508
I know who it is!

95
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:35,047
Fuck! Shit, I got heat!

96
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,650
I got big-time heat.
Listen, I gotta go.

97
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:40,218
Call out my accountant, tell him
dump all my fucking stuff

98
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,754
Do it right now.
Just do it now.

99
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,591
Don't fuckin' play games,
just dump everything.

100
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,993
Get the cash.

101
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,861
We gotta go liquid on
everything.

102
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:53,298
Do what the fuck I say, just do
it! I gotta go!

103
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,755
Girls.
You look like you're having fun.

104
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:20,259
You need something else?

105
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,995
<i>More wine for starters,
Mexicano.</i>

106
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:26,231
Yeah, go get my sister
some more wine.

107
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:30,169
What did I tell you about the
dog? Be respectful. He's dirty.

108
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,906
Solis.

109
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:35,607
Mr. Gonzalo.

110
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,177
I told you,
I don't work on Saturdays.

111
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,912
<i>I'm sorry, abuelo.
Call me on Monday.</i>

112
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:41,947
Yes, sir.

113
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,250
I-I need to negotiate with you
right now.

114
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:48,921
Remember that deal about my store,
my office, about a year ago?

115
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:50,923
You wanted my...
Sir, listen, please.

116
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:54,326
I-I'm sorry I'm bothering you
on Saturday, but listen, please.

117
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:58,964
We negotiated a deal on my store
and my doggy biscuit business.

118
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:01,099
Please, listen to me.

119
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,835
Yes, sir. We negotiated,

120
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,204
but I'll give it to you
for 10 cents on the dollar.

121
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:12,878
Sounds like you have
a distress business right now.

122
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,722
Right now, sir.
I need an answer right now, sir.

123
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,414
I have no weapons.
I have no weapons.

124
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:52,785
-I'm on the phone.
-Put your hands up.

125
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:55,321
I have no weapons.

126
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:59,324
Get your fucking hands up!
Get 'em up!

127
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,259
Officer, I have no weapons.
I have no intent to harm.

128
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,028
I'm on the phone with my
attorney.

129
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,196
Drop the fuckin' phone

130
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,932
or Henderman will drop you
to your panties, you prick.

131
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:09,935
-Drop the fuckin' phone.
-Call me when you make bail.

132
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:13,771
Stop. You're under arrest
for the murder of David Zelman,

133
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:17,275
Jonathan Skykes,
and Lee Renardo Catello.

134
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:18,943
And I'm gonna throw
in resisting arrest.

135
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:22,280
Listen, I'll be out in 18 hours.
They killed my family!

136
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:24,382
Get in the car. Come on.
Get in the car.

137
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,919
I'll be out in 18 hours.
Put your...

138
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:28,721
<i>Put your Miranda rights up your
culo.</i>

139
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:32,423
What do you think of that?

140
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:35,827
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-They killed my family!

141
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,797
-Get in the car.
-They killed my family!

142
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:01,352
Your belongings.

143
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:06,225
Bob, those motherfuckers
made my bail higher

144
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,860
than Charles fucking Manson,
man. What the fuck?

145
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,129
You killed a congressman's son,
Mickey.

146
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,765
A congressman's son?
A congressman's son?

147
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:15,967
That guy's the head
of the fucking hillbilly mafia.

148
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:17,470
-He was a drug runner.
-Yeah.

149
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,871
-Crow doesn't peck another crow.
-Yeah.

150
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:22,875
They're politicians, man. -Yeah,
they're fucking politicians.

151
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,308
Politicians, fuck 'em all.

152
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:26,444
They should all be fuckin' hung.
Mickey.

153
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:28,212
Every one of 'em.

154
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:31,283
We're in a police station.
Maybe...

155
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:35,220
Hey. Fuck 'em all.
Fuck all of you.

156
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,322
My kid's dead, man.
They don't give a shit.

157
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:39,991
You think Obama,
or his dirty tranny wife,

158
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:42,360
or Bush, or any of those people
care about my kids?

159
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,496
Nobody gives a shit
about my kids, man.

160
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,932
Fuck 'em all!
They're all on the same team.

161
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,767
I've got the right guy for you.

162
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,537
This guy.

163
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,140
The best lawyer I've ever seen.

164
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:58,510
He got Jim Jameson
off triple homicide,

165
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:02,480
and the cop even saw him
shoot the motherfuckers.

166
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:06,818
So, there you go.
My job's done.

167
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:09,954
I have a barbecue tonight
with the wife.

168
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:16,094
Do you know the difference between
a lawyer and a bail bondsman, Bob?

169
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:18,496
-No, I don't.
-Nothing.

170
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,168
You're all crooks, all thieves.

171
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:26,504
Fucking mooch.

172
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:42,987
Mr. Harrison.

173
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,290
Mickey Solis.

174
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:47,893
Sit down.

175
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:53,999
Your mother was a Mexican nanny,
or a housekeeper.

176
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:59,203
Your father was
an Irish-American trucker

177
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:07,144
who embodied the stereotype
of a drunken Irish fool.?

178
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:09,480
So you embraced
your mother's maiden name

179
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:12,116
because your father...

180
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:18,022
Well, he left for some
prostitute in Las Vegas.

181
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:24,395
Let's see. You had two other
sisters,

182
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,600
Maria and Martha,

183
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:32,403
both of them addicted to heroin,

184
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:35,974
died by the age of 25.

185
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:38,109
That's interesting.

186
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:46,318
Why did you embrace
the low-life path

187
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,623
with those diabolical scumbags

188
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:54,225
who were responsible
for your own sisters' death?

189
00:14:56,293 --> 00:15:00,598
Those assholes, I took 'em out,
both of them.

190
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:03,034
And they took my eye.

191
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,002
It's a tough world out there,
sir.

192
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:09,674
I charge 2,000 an hour.

193
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:12,576
I'm the meanest motherfucker in
court you've ever seen.

194
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:19,151
I got 60% of the judges
giving me head, so to speak,

195
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:20,584
on demand.

196
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:24,356
The ones who don't, I make sure
I never appear before them.

197
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:30,662
Never lost a case, and I don't
intend to any time soon.

198
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:37,035
You, Mr. Solis, are up shit
creek

199
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:42,540
with only a broken paddle
stickin' out your asshole.

200
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:46,644
You, my friend, are fucked.

201
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:51,249
Nobody is gonna take your case,

202
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:56,555
because even the judges
who suck my proverbial cock

203
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:58,089
won't touch you

204
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:02,326
because they don't want to lose
their Masonic memberships.

205
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,063
They got to convict you.

206
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:13,305
Yep. You are 100%
irretrievably fucked.

207
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:18,209
Your case, Mr. Solis,
is cut and dry.

208
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,645
A triple murder.

209
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:25,216
Four neighbors say they see you
going into the building,

210
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,586
they hear the shots,
they see you comin' out,

211
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,688
only one alive.

212
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:32,090
Boy.

213
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:37,329
Well, I suggest
that you digest cyanide.

214
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:40,432
I can, provide you
the spring water.

215
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:42,735
<i>2K an hour to hear this cagada?</i>

216
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:48,105
Your Spanish is atrocious.

217
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,174
I learned Spanish
from my grandfather.

218
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,745
He was a Scotsman,
but he had a Mexican nanny,

219
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:58,250
and he used to hear stories
from his granddaddy before him.

220
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:03,755
And granddaddy actually fought in
the 1845 Mexican-American war.

221
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:09,394
Yeah. The Scots and the Irish
Catholics fighting,

222
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:12,563
slaughtering the indigents
in the name of...

223
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:15,366
What is it called?
Manifest destiny.

224
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:22,040
Only, they would hear the bells,
you see, at night,

225
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:26,077
ringing across the battlefield.

226
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:33,451
See, all of the Mexican soldiers,
they would be called to mass.

227
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:38,089
And the Scots and the Irish,
the Catholics,

228
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:41,559
they hear these sounds, and they
would slip away in the night.

229
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:44,797
And they would never come back.

230
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,765
Some of them would fall in love.

231
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,101
It's very romantic.

232
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,336
I'm developing a TV series about
it.

233
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:56,774
I developed a fondness

234
00:17:56,807 --> 00:18:00,177
for the Mexican community
a long time ago.

235
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:02,346
See, I was bullied in school

236
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,517
by, all the brothers
who would call me a cracker,

237
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,219
and they would
beat the shit out of me.

238
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:09,320
But there was
this one Mexican-American kid,

239
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,222
big, giant guy,

240
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,792
and he would come,
and he would protect my ass.

241
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:15,693
Of course, he would charge me
two milk cartons

242
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,697
and three brownies a week for
it.

243
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,332
They taxed you.

244
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:24,536
I became a successful lawyer.

245
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:32,477
And I remembered the Mexican
kid,

246
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:35,747
and I, figured
I owe something back.

247
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:42,653
I spent a lot of time in Mexico
developing an orphanage for boys

248
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:47,291
who had it way worse
than you ever did, Mr. Solis.

249
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:52,564
Take for example, this kid here.
Fernando.

250
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:54,732
You see him?

251
00:18:54,766 --> 00:19:00,404
He is one of many whom I support
with 50% of everything I earn,

252
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:05,177
which I take from misguided
dime-a-dozen gangsters like you.

253
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,813
<i>And I donate it to my chicos.</i>

254
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:15,453
Mr. Harrison,
my family has been slaughtered.

255
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,892
My son, my daughter.

256
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,830
The Woo family, the Chinese
gang, they took them out.

257
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:29,534
I have absolutely nothing
to live for.

258
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,870
Nothing.

259
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:35,606
And I would take
that cyanide you offer

260
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,909
if it wasn't for my undying
desire to take...

261
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,211
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

262
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,445
To... to... to avenge your son
and your daughter

263
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:45,383
and all of that,
machismo mambo jambo bullshit.

264
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:48,287
I'm not like you, okay?

265
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,257
But I understand.

266
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:55,326
I think I would feel the same
way.

267
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,530
But, the hourly rate
remains the same?

268
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,633
Most assuredly so.

269
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,703
So, what you're telling me now
is I should kill myself.

270
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,939
Any other useful information?

271
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:11,777
Well, I've already made a plea
bargain, manslaughter.

272
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:15,813
You will do five years.

273
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:19,483
So, question is,

274
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:24,422
how long do you need to do
your Pancho Villa routine?

275
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:26,590
Like, six months?

276
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:31,429
I can keep you on the street
for about that time,

277
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:34,665
and then, yeah,
you gotta do your time,

278
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:37,568
but you'll be out in three
years.

279
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:42,374
I have nothing else to live for
but to avenge my family.

280
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:44,742
Well, there is...

281
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:49,347
a nun.

282
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:55,987
And if you need some
spiritual help

283
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,321
You should call her.

284
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,525
She charges, 5,000 an hour.

285
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:03,927
5K an hour for a nun?

286
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:06,698
She's in your neighborhood.

287
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:12,738
She has a very mysterious
history.

288
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:18,410
Anyway, I feel sorry for you,
but I'm also a businessman,

289
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:21,980
and you bet your ass
she cuts me in.

290
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,324
You know I don't speak that
Spanish.

291
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:35,926
Why's your sister still here?
Why don't you do me a favor?

292
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,496
Buy her a ticket to Ohio
and send her back.

293
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:41,566
My sister stays as long as she
wants.

294
00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:42,701
You keep fucking around,

295
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,702
and you'll both
be floating in the pool.

296
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:47,838
Excuse me, sir,
Mr. Solis is here.

297
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:49,840
Let him come out.

298
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:58,049
<i>-Ladies.
-Buenos dias.</i>

299
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:01,485
I thought you don't speak Spanish.
I do in an emergency.

300
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,922
I told you to keep your dog
in the other yard.

301
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:05,756
I don't like pit bulls,
especially this one.

302
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:06,791
Barks all night long.

303
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:10,527
Mr. Gonzalo,
is it possible we can go inside

304
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,063
and speak
about a very important matter?

305
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,835
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you insane?

306
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,572
I told you, I don't like pit bulls.
I'm gonna shoot this fucking dog.

307
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,774
I told you to leave him.
He's a crazy Mexican.

308
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,643
You're a crazy Mexican!

309
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:30,514
Mr. Gonzalo, with all due
respect, sir, I can take the dog.

310
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,720
You like to play?

311
00:22:35,752 --> 00:22:38,022
No sir, I...
I don't play.

312
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,735
Your reputation precedes you.

313
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,072
My reputation? And what is that?

314
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:57,674
We're warriors against the grain.
Maybe you're too old for that.

315
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,945
Don't you think that music's
a little loud, sir?

316
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:05,549
I hear the Feds are on you,
watching you to fuck up.

317
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:08,886
Well, maybe you're right.

318
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,989
That music will drown them out,
that's for sure.

319
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:14,125
What's the ugly gray van
outside?

320
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:19,963
Well, it's ugly,
but it's not gray, it's silver.

321
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:22,133
I do some research
on your business.

322
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,867
It's worth only 500K.

323
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:27,538
10 cents on the dollar means
50K.

324
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:29,173
I need 700 grand.

325
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,143
What the hell you talking about?
It's 10 cents on the dollar.

326
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:37,615
Mr. Gonzalo,
my family was slaughtered.

327
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:39,483
The Woo King family took 'em
out.

328
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:41,553
I know who they are.
I know what happened.

329
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,854
Why should I be responsible?

330
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:45,456
Esteban, my son,

331
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,594
when you were younger and on the
street, he helped you.

332
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:52,096
You climbed up the ranks
because of his hard work, too,

333
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:54,164
and because of the connection
in Bogata.

334
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:57,869
Did I have a contract that I had
to pay his father percentages?

335
00:23:57,902 --> 00:23:59,703
No, you don't.

336
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:03,475
But maybe it could be considered
to be an unwritten law.

337
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,109
Maybe on the street that works,

338
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:07,879
but I don't live that life
anymore, as you see.

339
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:11,015
It's good to remember
where you came from, sir.

340
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:14,519
You might cross those bridges
again.

341
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:19,890
I'll lend you the 500
with a 10% interest.

342
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:22,594
You have no idea
what this means to me.

343
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:24,995
Yes, I do.
10% interest.

344
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:27,898
I'll help you take
the Woo King family out.

345
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:30,501
They owe me
three million dollars forever.

346
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:36,039
What's this?

347
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:40,011
I'm gonna pay my girlfriend back
for being a bitch.

348
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:44,216
It's better than the burrito
in the driveway.

349
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:46,984
Bring it back
when you bring the money.

350
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,054
With a full tank of gas.

351
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:51,623
It's electric.

352
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:16,515
You don't look very Mexican.

353
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:19,116
My mother's Irish.

354
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,287
Irish.

355
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:26,525
Some say from the seed of
Abraham.

356
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:31,529
I trained as a nun in Belfast.

357
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:36,233
I'll never forget
those beautiful children

358
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:42,540
with their pale, white skin
and their rosy cheeks.

359
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:44,509
How did you know it was me?

360
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:48,779
Mr. Harrison told me.

361
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,116
It's not every day
a pirate walks in here.

362
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:58,323
I haven't smiled for a while.

363
00:25:58,588 --> 00:26:04,328
I heard what happened to you,
to your family.

364
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:11,769
May I say that death
is a door that opens.

365
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:15,673
I hope not for some.

366
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:19,676
You're angry.

367
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,681
I know that kind of spirit.

368
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:28,787
It can be a driving force
to obliterate evil.

369
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,222
I remember...

370
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:36,294
I remember well,
when I was young.

371
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:43,201
This older man...

372
00:26:45,201 --> 00:26:48,707
with gray hair.

373
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:52,110
He was a priest.

374
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:58,182
He thought I was lovely.

375
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:03,186
He said it too often.

376
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:09,793
And then, one day,
he took what would remain

377
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:13,064
my darkest childhood memory.

378
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:16,734
Why are you telling me all this?
I wasn't finished.

379
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:22,240
As I lay there,

380
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:29,379
bleeding from my lower parts
at nine years old,

381
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:31,382
I knew.

382
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:35,153
I knew that the devil
lives inside this church

383
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:38,288
just as much as the angels do.

384
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:44,128
And I swore...

385
00:27:46,262 --> 00:27:50,033
to devote my whole being

386
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:53,770
to avenging anyone
who harmed children.

387
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:55,940
What happened to the priest?

388
00:27:57,775 --> 00:28:01,312
<i>Le corte los huevos al cabrón.</i>

389
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:05,849
Look, I don't have time for this
crap.

390
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:09,120
You don't have time to avenge
for your granddaughter?

391
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:13,024
She was pregnant when she died.

392
00:28:13,257 --> 00:28:15,393
My daughter was pregnant?

393
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:17,462
Yes.

394
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,266
I don't want to live
in this darkness anymore.

395
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:26,471
I only took on this job
because of your granddaughter.

396
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:30,075
I know Mr. King.
I used to go to them for funds.

397
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:34,345
-Funds? What kind of funds?
-Funds.

398
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:40,917
It takes funds to find and then
to take out child abusers.

399
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:44,855
<i>I thought Mr. King and his family
were good people, buena gente,</i>

400
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:47,023
and then I learned that they
were in the black market

401
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:51,362
making snuff films with little
ones...

402
00:28:54,865 --> 00:29:00,404
Mr. Solis, I know who is responsible
for the hit on your family.

403
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:03,974
I can get to his lieutenant,

404
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:10,981
and from him, I can find the
whereabouts of Mr. King himself.

405
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:15,086
The rest, it's up to you.

406
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:20,023
You?

407
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:22,326
You?
What, you're gonna do it alone?

408
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:24,528
What are you gonna do,
choke him with your habit?

409
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:26,831
What's your name?

410
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:31,402
I'm a nun.

411
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:43,413
<i>Cincuenta mil.</i>

412
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,115
50K...

413
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:51,221
And I'll get you
all the information you need.

414
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,529
Good night, Mr. Solis.

415
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:03,802
Yeah.

416
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:42,874
Hello. It's a little late to be
calling.

417
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:44,942
Who is this?

418
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,980
I'm sorry to be calling so late.

419
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:51,915
It's very important.

420
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:54,952
I wanted to let you know
it's the pirate.

421
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,294
What can I do for you, Mr.
Solis?

422
00:31:05,962 --> 00:31:08,066
It's a green light.

423
00:31:08,598 --> 00:31:11,336
You remember what I said?

424
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:15,573
Well, yeah.
I got the money.

425
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:19,943
Half now, and half
when you're done with the job.

426
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,516
It's inside the flowers I got
you.

427
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:30,153
And you better get 'em quick,

428
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:33,323
because you never know
about these priests.

429
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:38,096
I only got you the flowers because
you were helping my family out.

430
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:40,964
You know, helping me out.

431
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,501
I'm a nun, for goodness sake.

432
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,972
And I'm a good Catholic boy.

433
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,681
Thank you for helping me.

434
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,083
I hope this works out.

435
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:05,056
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

436
00:33:06,182 --> 00:33:08,185
<i>Chinga tu madre!</i>

437
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:12,423
Fuck.

438
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:18,729
I drank way too much.

439
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,373
Hey, you here?

440
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:29,707
<i>Perro?</i>

441
00:33:31,575 --> 00:33:32,410
<i>Perro?</i>

442
00:33:36,012 --> 00:33:38,415
Hey.

443
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,285
You were right there the whole
time.

444
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:44,555
How you doing?

445
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:51,395
Hey, you know,
I never got your name.

446
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:52,763
What's your name?

447
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:04,342
When my...

448
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:11,148
When my daughter,
when she was young, she...

449
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,221
She got a little dog.

450
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,159
And she came running up to me, and
she says, "Papi, I got a dog!

451
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:24,829
And guess what
I'm gonna name him?

452
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:28,499
I'm gonna name the dog 'Dog'."

453
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:33,838
<i>I said, "Mija, you can't name
your dog, 'Dog'."</i>

454
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:38,174
And she said,

455
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:43,748
"Papi, it's my dog,
and his name is 'Dog'."

456
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,487
I'm sorry I'm not such
a good host,

457
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:56,360
but I'm alone now,
and, well...

458
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:03,433
It's hard for me to look at
this, so I-I keep it in here.

459
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,202
I'll get you some dog food
today.

460
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,846
Thank you.

461
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:41,838
"Pirate, this is your favorite
'N'.

462
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:44,442
I did good, didn't I?

463
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,577
Your China dream
is just a few miles away."

464
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:54,918
Yeah?

465
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:56,619
<i>Mickey, hermano.</i>

466
00:35:56,652 --> 00:36:00,423
<i>Hey, is this Rudy?
What's up, Rudy?</i>

467
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:01,458
<i>Come on, ese.</i>

468
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,495
Mickey, we know everything
you've been through.

469
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:06,629
<i>Sorry, effacito.</i>

470
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:07,931
<i>Gracias, hermano.</i>

471
00:36:08,164 --> 00:36:09,900
<i>Hey, listen,
I really appreciate it, man.</i>

472
00:36:09,932 --> 00:36:11,902
<i>Hey, Mickey, come by Sunday.</i>

473
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:13,503
<i>-We'll have a barbecue.
-Yeah.</i>

474
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:15,338
<i>We can talk there.</i>

475
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,809
<i>Okay, hermano.
I really appreciate it.</i>

476
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:21,578
<i>I'll see you guys there.
Bring whoever you can.</i>

477
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,713
<i>Órale, nos vemos.</i>

478
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,849
<i>Okay, carnal. Gracias.</i>

479
00:36:32,188 --> 00:36:33,190
Yes.

480
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:36,759
<i>-Say, Mickey.
-Mr. Harrison.</i>

481
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:38,929
<i>Hey, I got a few questions for
you.</i>

482
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:41,364
Quick, quick couple of
questions.

483
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:44,367
I don't want to waste
your precious time.

484
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,271
So, do you know
what date it is today?

485
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:50,306
You missed the wire date,
motherfucker.

486
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,910
Shit. Hey, look, I have
every intention of paying you.

487
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:55,980
My guy, he pays in increments,
you know?

488
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:58,849
Do you have any idea
what I had to do

489
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:02,452
and who I had to grease

490
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:06,856
to make the deal to get you
out of prison for six months

491
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:08,658
and to get you out for
manslaughter?

492
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:10,994
-Do you have any idea?
-Yes, sir, I understand that.

493
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:13,998
So, don't fuck around with me.
Okay?

494
00:37:15,831 --> 00:37:19,336
<i>You think I get intimidated
by some chalupa mob?</i>

495
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:22,673
You cunt.
I want my fuckin' money.

496
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:24,942
Hey, look. Hey, look.
I understand.

497
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:27,411
Hey, I'm not the guy
to push right now.

498
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:28,579
Who am I, Mickey?

499
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:32,782
<i>Well, you're a great lawyer.
I'm gonna handle it.</i>

500
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:36,987
I am Barkley fucking Harrison.

501
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:41,592
You think some chink mob
or some burrito hit squad

502
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,594
can fuck with Barkley Harrison?

503
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,731
I never said anything.

504
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:52,736
Shut the fuck up, you cunt.

505
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:59,009
I will send the one-eyed
Illuminati Satanists

506
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:01,911
to pay you a fuckin' visit.

507
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:05,983
Do you know who they are?

508
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:09,385
They are my friends!

509
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:11,855
My friends!

510
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:15,692
Every black and white,

511
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,561
every guy in a tie,

512
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:24,335
every white trash detective
in Orange County,

513
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,936
every fucking congressman,
every mayor.

514
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:31,541
The fuckin' president of the
United States takes my calls.

515
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:36,380
This guy is fucking crazy.

516
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:40,650
If it wasn't for my daughter and
my son, I'd fuckin' blast him.

517
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:44,989
<i>Only 'cause I wanna get
venganza.</i>

518
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:49,926
I know your struggle.

519
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,795
We are one,

520
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:56,967
<i>but don't you fuckin' forget
my chicos, Mickey.</i>

521
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,838
<i>My chicos.</i>

522
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,916
Motherfucker.

523
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:16,119
Fucking lawyers.

524
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:21,858
Every dog has his day.

525
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:29,766
Rudy's waiting for you.

526
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,001
Rudy!

527
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:38,074
<i>I hear you're makin' a lot of
ducats on the street, que no?</i>

528
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:43,547
<i>Mickey, all these pendejos
on the streets of LA.</i>

529
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:45,782
I wanna live like Obama
but I ain't gonna change it

530
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:48,651
from the White House
to the Brown House.

531
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:51,989
<i>Hey, Mickey, I hear that you
need to fire up some chinos.</i>

532
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:54,424
<i>Just let me know, mijo.</i>

533
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:57,693
If these bam-bams don't work,
this will.

534
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:03,766
<i>Mickey, then show me to do
negocios.</i>

535
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,071
I ain't letting these motherfuckers get
away with all that shit they pull.

536
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:12,409
How many people knew his
daughter, let alone Esteban?

537
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:21,717
We all know what happened to them,
but now, it's time to fix this shit.

538
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:26,557
<i>Hermanos, I,... I didn't come
here for a handout.</i>

539
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:33,164
<i>I came here to give people feria
who want to chop on my onda.</i>

540
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:38,468
I got to fix
these Woo King motherfuckers.

541
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:47,744
These guys, we can't let 'em
get away with this

542
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:51,514
without retribution,
what they did to my family.

543
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:54,183
<i>¿Tu sabes?</i>

544
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:56,552
If we lose this respect
on the streets,

545
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:59,755
all our value on the street
will go way down.

546
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:02,659
We gotta do something,
and we gotta do it now.

547
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:07,664
<i>You might think this is just
about venganza, revenge,</i>

548
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:11,168
but that's not true.
It's about respect and honor.

549
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:15,239
Respect we had
since the fuckin' '60s?

550
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:17,708
And that's why
we gotta take 'em down now,

551
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,811
this fucking Woo King family.

552
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:25,182
But we gotta do it without an
army.

553
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:27,550
'Cause if we go in there with an
army, they're gonna run,

554
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:29,085
and everybody's gonna scram,

555
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,623
and it's all gonna be fucked up,
the operation.

556
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:34,657
I need two of the best here.

557
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,226
Hey, Mickey.
I'm not doing this for money.

558
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,030
I'm doing this for fun.

559
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:44,201
What about you? Let's go down
and fuck around?

560
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:49,273
<i>Hey, jefito, you know I would be
in, but I got too much business.</i>

561
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:51,942
A lot of shit going down in TJ,
homie.

562
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:56,247
I need Benjamin Franklins.
I can't fuck it up, homie.

563
00:41:57,813 --> 00:41:59,949
Yeah.

564
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:03,052
I guess it's gonna be
just me and Mona.

565
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:06,589
-We'll take 'em down.
-I got Hector.

566
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:08,724
He can do some leg work for you.

567
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:09,859
You know what, motherfucker?

568
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:12,862
If you don't help Mickey,
you will get no pussy.

569
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:16,267
<i>I'm cutting you off
for, like, dias.</i>

570
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:19,635
No, years.
You got that, punk?

571
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:22,306
No pussy for 10 years.

572
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:27,177
<i>Chingao, Mickey, I think
I can reschedule some things</i>

573
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,646
for later that month.

574
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:36,853
Sir, you may go
with your brother and sister.

575
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:39,155
The Mahjong game starts from
eight.

576
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:42,291
I shall have your dinner
prepared at 10:00.

577
00:42:42,324 --> 00:42:47,263
Meixiu, you're only half my age, but
you're sounding like my mother.

578
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:50,099
I will return at the time I
desire. Bye.

579
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:21,264
Sir, we got a problem at the
bank.

580
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,335
We need the money,
500,000 in gold and cash,

581
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:28,271
counted by 6:00 a.m. tomorrow,
in the shipment to Shanghai.

582
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:30,641
Is that all?

583
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:33,744
They told me by Monday
I would have to.

584
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,012
That was the case,

585
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,146
but our FBI tag said that if we
don't get it out by tomorrow,

586
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:40,750
Immigration's gonna come
and swipe it up.

587
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,786
Okay.

588
00:43:51,728 --> 00:43:54,231
So, I will have to drop you here
now.

589
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,032
Enjoy the game of Mahjong,

590
00:43:56,266 --> 00:44:00,371
and my dear daughter will come
here on Monday to meet you all.

591
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,206
Okay.

592
00:44:11,313 --> 00:44:13,250
Hey, how do you know
Woo King's here?

593
00:44:13,282 --> 00:44:18,322
Woo King plays domino every
single Thursday at the same time.

594
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:23,227
Hey, guys, that's it.
There is Woo King's car.

595
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:30,768
Hey, Rudy, there is a woman
in the car.

596
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:33,936
I don't care.

597
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:36,239
Kill them all.

598
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,976
Let's go.

599
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:05,201
Where's Woo King?!
Where's Woo King?!

600
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,905
Where the fuck is Woo King?!

601
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:10,441
Let's go. Woo King's not here.

602
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:12,208
Let's go! Go!

603
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,420
Sir, it's getting very dangerous
right now.

604
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,956
Please grab your valuables.
You must go to Meixiu's.

605
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:28,758
We may be staying a while.

606
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:36,259
Angels, if you're out there,

607
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:44,968
tell my beautiful, lovely
daughter and Esteban

608
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:48,438
that I'm sorry I brought their
souls to an early death

609
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:54,143
for my lifestyle
and my mistakes in my life.

610
00:46:58,146 --> 00:47:00,483
I will avenge their souls.

611
00:47:10,092 --> 00:47:10,860
Yeah?

612
00:47:10,893 --> 00:47:14,496
<i>Hey, jefe. It's Rudy.
Carnal.</i>

613
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:17,000
<i>This bitch Woo King
wants to meet with you.</i>

614
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:26,143
Sir, I do not believe
this meeting should take place.

615
00:47:27,376 --> 00:47:32,581
My suggestions to you
as your spiritual advisor...

616
00:47:32,614 --> 00:47:36,185
What wisdom do you wish to
convey?

617
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:41,557
Mickey Solis, he falls under the
star sign of the Tiger.

618
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:47,931
It symbolizes the traits
of bravery, unpredictability.

619
00:47:47,963 --> 00:47:51,467
I can assure you,
he will fight to his death

620
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:55,239
to protect his loved ones'
honor.

621
00:47:57,172 --> 00:48:00,609
I too fall under the same sign.

622
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:09,519
Meixiu, a woman's stillness
is her greatest attribute.

623
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:40,951
The chinks have been checked
just like you.

624
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:45,989
No metal in this room.
Just us.

625
00:48:46,956 --> 00:48:49,293
You know
the Southside Conference rules.

626
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:51,295
They're in place.

627
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:57,233
You both got 30 minutes maximum.

628
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:03,340
If you don't come to an
agreement,

629
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,708
then we escort all of you
out of here,

630
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:10,079
and then you can blast your
monkey asses off in the street.

631
00:49:11,213 --> 00:49:16,719
If it gets physical, then we
blast whatever side starts it.

632
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:23,492
Mr. Solis, I never met you before,
but I heard a lot about you.

633
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,696
A couple of made guys

634
00:49:26,728 --> 00:49:30,500
wanted to bring you in
as a consultant on a few things.

635
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:33,670
I'm sorry about the loss
of your family.

636
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:37,173
Well, then,
let's just get down to business.

637
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:40,177
I'm here to listen.

638
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:43,045
My father taught me
to observe all doors

639
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:45,481
before going through any of
them.

640
00:49:46,014 --> 00:49:46,549
What do you want?

641
00:49:47,516 --> 00:49:50,452
I say what he wants,
to bring peace now?

642
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:55,290
Because we whacked all his family,
and now he wants to bring peace?

643
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:56,760
He's just a coward.

644
00:49:57,025 --> 00:49:59,495
He knows that Mexicans
don't give up.

645
00:49:59,528 --> 00:50:02,199
Do you hear that?
Mexicans don't give up.

646
00:50:02,565 --> 00:50:05,702
But we will hear
what Mr. King has to say.

647
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,304
What do you have to say?

648
00:50:08,336 --> 00:50:14,643
Mr. Solis,
your son, your daughter,

649
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:18,314
they will never return to this
earth.

650
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:24,054
My son, my son, do you hear me?

651
00:50:24,086 --> 00:50:28,358
My son, he will not return
to this earth.

652
00:50:28,757 --> 00:50:32,428
You deserve death. Death!

653
00:50:33,628 --> 00:50:36,565
Fellows, we do not get paid
enough

654
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:40,503
for this chicken chow mein
soap opera.

655
00:50:40,536 --> 00:50:43,407
Hey, fuck you.
Fuck you!

656
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:47,344
The Italian mob went out with
disco.

657
00:50:48,043 --> 00:50:51,248
You motherfuckers ain't got nothing
left on the street, and you know it.

658
00:50:52,547 --> 00:50:55,284
You want to blast me, go ahead.

659
00:50:55,717 --> 00:51:01,290
<i>If my people green light you, if
my gente, they put you on blast,</i>

660
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:04,693
you'll be out before you can say
"badabing badaboom."

661
00:51:05,661 --> 00:51:10,700
Mr. King, you didn't say we had
to do deal with this shit.

662
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:12,568
What the hell?

663
00:51:16,438 --> 00:51:18,540
It is courageous,

664
00:51:18,574 --> 00:51:24,246
your display in front of these
nice Italian colleagues.

665
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,285
However, shall we think
about the rest of our family?

666
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:33,556
And I only have
my youngest daughter.

667
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:38,795
You took the rest of our family.

668
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:40,496
Is that not enough?

669
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,367
You are the one
who brought this fire on.

670
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,668
I only put it out.

671
00:51:46,268 --> 00:51:48,737
It is not only my daughter,

672
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:51,841
a person I am eager for,

673
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:53,609
it is for all of us.

674
00:51:55,311 --> 00:52:01,217
Are we so ignorant
to take all our lives down?

675
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:06,523
Yes, I won't lie,
I want my daughter's life.

676
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:08,758
I know you Mexicans
won't kill the young,

677
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:11,260
but when my daughter grows
older,

678
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:13,696
she might be the object
of your revenge.

679
00:52:14,262 --> 00:52:16,900
I will do anything to stop this
war.

680
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:21,237
I know it's hard to believe,
but I'm sorry for your loss.

681
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:25,809
Mr. King, we're both
businessmen.

682
00:52:26,141 --> 00:52:28,711
We both knew and understood

683
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:33,550
the risks involved
in this type of business.

684
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:37,887
We both knew that our children's
lives could also be like a vapor,

685
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:40,523
and they could go like this.

686
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,527
And they did.

687
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,397
And now,
we both suffer the anguish.

688
00:52:50,565 --> 00:52:52,768
I live in hell.

689
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:57,273
I am the walking dead.

690
00:52:57,306 --> 00:52:59,509
We can end all of this now.

691
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:02,746
Mr. Solis, you don't desire to
live.

692
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,849
I can't give you the reason for
that.

693
00:53:06,882 --> 00:53:10,619
Your mother, she is...
She is not the reason?

694
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:12,921
What are you fuckin' playing at?

695
00:53:12,954 --> 00:53:15,958
My mother left me long, long
ago.

696
00:53:16,224 --> 00:53:18,862
Yet, she gave you life,
did she not?

697
00:53:19,561 --> 00:53:22,397
Yet, she is safe.
She's very safe.

698
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:24,867
You don't love her,
but she's still your mother.

699
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:28,204
I want this war to end
for my daughter.

700
00:53:28,737 --> 00:53:31,306
I have not seen my mother
in 30 years.

701
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,476
You think you get to me?

702
00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:35,512
Is blood not thicker than water?

703
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:38,580
We can end this meeting
for my daughter's life.

704
00:53:38,614 --> 00:53:42,284
My daughter's life
for your mother you hated.

705
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,662
-Man.
-Wait, wait.

706
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:56,365
Please, sit.

707
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:00,903
<i>No way, jefe.</i>

708
00:54:02,003 --> 00:54:04,406
Enough blood has flowed.

709
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:09,980
Enough. Enough has flowed.

710
00:54:11,981 --> 00:54:17,320
Can you assure me my mother
will stay alive and unharmed?

711
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:21,992
I assure you
that no harm will come to her.

712
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:25,661
Then I give you your daughter's
life.

713
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:32,567
My daughter's life,
you give me your solemn word?

714
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:40,343
I swear on my daughter's soul
that no harm will come to her.

715
00:54:55,423 --> 00:54:56,625
Hey, Rudy.

716
00:54:56,659 --> 00:54:58,961
<i>Where are you, man? I thought
you were at the casita.</i>

717
00:54:58,994 --> 00:55:03,066
<i>No, holmes, I'm not at the casita.
I'm at the accountant office.</i>

718
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:05,001
Yeah, this guy,
he don't do shit I say.

719
00:55:05,034 --> 00:55:07,003
I call him up 50 times,
he don't do shit.

720
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:10,005
Like, these, you know, lawyers
and his fucking' bail bondsmen

721
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:12,908
are a bunch of criminals,
holmes.

722
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:18,413
Hey, look, I need a takedown
guy.

723
00:55:18,447 --> 00:55:22,385
Somebody quick, smart,
but a badass.

724
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:24,820
Yeah, man, Hector is the best.

725
00:55:24,853 --> 00:55:28,423
Hector? Hector Ortiz?

726
00:55:28,456 --> 00:55:30,559
<i>Simón, Hector Ortiz.</i>

727
00:55:30,592 --> 00:55:33,495
Shit, he used to do my fuckin'
pickups in the 90's, holmes.

728
00:55:33,695 --> 00:55:34,864
He's still around?

729
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:37,500
Yeah, man. He's still there,
he's still around.

730
00:55:37,532 --> 00:55:40,001
<i>He's puro soldado, homie.</i>

731
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,909
It's certainly nice to ascertain

732
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:50,113
while you cancel
a perfectly good offer.

733
00:55:50,378 --> 00:55:51,913
I'm very busy.

734
00:55:51,947 --> 00:55:54,650
And, by the way,
I left you a message.

735
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:57,519
That was smart. You left
a message on my house phone.

736
00:55:57,552 --> 00:56:00,889
You didn't think of leaving it
on my cell phone?

737
00:56:02,123 --> 00:56:03,125
Ambassador Berman,

738
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:05,694
you know, I must have sat
in this office 33 times

739
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:09,699
since you became the German
ambassador to the USA.

740
00:56:09,731 --> 00:56:12,101
I've never found one mistake.

741
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,706
You're an amazing woman.

742
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,544
Who'd have thought?
May I?

743
00:56:21,577 --> 00:56:25,982
Two old age foes could have
such a collegial relationship.

744
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:31,921
William, I suggest you stop
trying to get me in bed

745
00:56:31,954 --> 00:56:33,689
every time you wanna know more

746
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:37,593
about Angela Merkel's
anti-Obama spy tactics.

747
00:56:37,626 --> 00:56:40,463
Maybe you are not British.

748
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:42,898
Maybe you are CIA.

749
00:56:42,931 --> 00:56:46,101
-I loathe them, darling.
-Do you?

750
00:56:46,135 --> 00:56:49,806
My father was not found with 23
bullets in his upper torso

751
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:51,074
for no reason.

752
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,942
He was raised in Bavaria,

753
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:55,110
and he did not know
any of this business

754
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:57,179
with the East side of Los
Angeles.

755
00:56:57,445 --> 00:56:59,449
And for some mysterious reason,

756
00:56:59,481 --> 00:57:02,518
he was gunned down
in the middle of the night,

757
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,186
on the night I bid him farewell.

758
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,954
Did you know something about
that?

759
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:08,824
Frankly, Greta, I,... I find
your paranoia disconcerting.

760
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:12,728
You know very well I have
no intel on your father's death.

761
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,766
And you also knew the risks of
your job, of your ambassadorship.

762
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:23,005
Especially a country like Germany
with so many historical enemies.

763
00:57:23,038 --> 00:57:25,675
And let me ask you something.

764
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,177
How do you know it wasn't another
country that paid the Mexicans?

765
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:31,847
Our country is only rich
because we work damn hard.

766
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:36,919
Yes, Katrina?

767
00:57:36,952 --> 00:57:41,658
<i>Mrs. Berman,
there's a very demanding man.</i>

768
00:57:42,724 --> 00:57:43,925
Solis?

769
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:45,461
<i>How did you know?</i>

770
00:57:46,728 --> 00:57:48,130
Instinct rules me.

771
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:50,199
We have a meeting.

772
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:53,902
I'm just finishing this meeting.

773
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:56,139
He can drive here
at his convenience.

774
00:57:56,472 --> 00:57:57,807
<i>He's already here
in the office, ma'am.</i>

775
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:00,242
But how did he come through
Security?

776
00:58:00,576 --> 00:58:02,010
<i>He had your passcode, ma'am.</i>

777
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:05,248
Yes. Yes, I remember.

778
00:58:06,114 --> 00:58:07,850
Okay, send him in.

779
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:13,822
-Mrs. Ambassador.
-What's this?

780
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:15,858
It's Mr. Solis.

781
00:58:16,692 --> 00:58:18,795
He's wearing an eyepatch,
for God's sake.

782
00:58:19,695 --> 00:58:21,597
I don't know who you are,

783
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:23,199
and maybe I don't care to know,

784
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,601
but I got a meeting
with the ambassador,

785
00:58:26,635 --> 00:58:28,137
and I suggest you let us have
it.

786
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,505
You "got" a meeting?

787
00:58:29,871 --> 00:58:31,239
I "have" a meeting
with the ambassador,

788
00:58:31,273 --> 00:58:33,242
-I think you'll find, dear boy.
-Out of my face, holmes.

789
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:35,677
-Let me just call Security.
-Yeah, you call Security.

790
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:37,780
They're all from my
neighborhood, motherfucker.

791
00:58:38,012 --> 00:58:40,215
Please, it's personal.

792
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,252
What was your first name?

793
00:58:43,284 --> 00:58:44,887
Mickey.

794
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:48,090
Well, touché, Mickey Solis.

795
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,730
<i>What got stuck up that guy's
culo?</i>

796
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:58,634
What the hell you think
you are doing here?

797
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:00,936
You can destroy my reputation
in one hour.

798
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:05,141
Hey, you told me to come here
when I needed to,

799
00:59:05,173 --> 00:59:05,974
when I needed something.

800
00:59:06,775 --> 00:59:09,878
And I need something right now,
a favor.

801
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:12,114
You could have called me
on my cell first.

802
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:14,817
I did. I left a message.
You didn't answer.

803
00:59:14,849 --> 00:59:17,987
Well, I don't have always my
cell.

804
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:20,590
Why are you risking my
reputation coming here?

805
00:59:21,123 --> 00:59:23,626
Mrs. Berman,
when your father was killed,

806
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:25,227
you came to me,
I didn't come to you.

807
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,597
You wanted to know
who killed him, I found out,

808
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,898
and I took care of business.

809
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:31,933
Now, it's your turn
to repay the favor.

810
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,336
It's not the proper time, Mr.
Solis. -Mrs. Berman!

811
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:37,740
My kids were
in the prime of their life.

812
00:59:39,173 --> 00:59:40,643
Now, you owe me a favor,

813
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:43,179
and I'm coming here
to fucking collect, you got it?

814
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:44,713
I paid you well.

815
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:48,250
Money doesn't mean everything
when your life's at risk.

816
00:59:48,282 --> 00:59:51,219
Now, you owe me a fuckin' favor,
and I need it now.

817
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:53,256
You need not curse.

818
00:59:54,356 --> 00:59:57,293
I need two passports for two
ladies.

819
00:59:57,326 --> 01:00:00,896
And two visas.
They gotta go to Asia.

820
01:00:01,163 --> 01:00:02,764
They gotta take a boat.

821
01:00:02,797 --> 01:00:04,699
And I need 'em now.

822
01:00:04,733 --> 01:00:07,769
I'm not the queen,
I'm a damn ambassador.

823
01:00:07,802 --> 01:00:10,339
How shall I get your passports,
and for whom?

824
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:12,774
You don't have to curse.

825
01:00:42,237 --> 01:00:44,072
How was your day at school?

826
01:00:44,106 --> 01:00:46,075
Very well thank you.

827
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:56,052
Hey. Don't think about it.
Give it to me.

828
01:00:58,653 --> 01:01:00,422
I could kill you in front of the
girl and make it easy.

829
01:01:01,923 --> 01:01:03,059
Take her in the car.

830
01:01:06,795 --> 01:01:10,133
You got five seconds to say your
prayers, and then, you're dead.

831
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:19,708
-What's your name?
-Mulan.

832
01:01:20,842 --> 01:01:26,114
Mulan. I know that it's been
a very difficult day for you,

833
01:01:26,148 --> 01:01:31,387
but I assure you, nothing is
going to happen bad to you.

834
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,456
-Okay?
-Okay.

835
01:01:33,688 --> 01:01:35,391
All right.

836
01:01:35,423 --> 01:01:37,326
There's gonna be a lady.

837
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,096
She's gonna come
and take you somewhere,

838
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:42,197
take you to Beijing
to your grandparents.

839
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:47,136
You told me
that you enjoyed it there, yes?

840
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:47,769
Okay.

841
01:01:48,336 --> 01:01:50,373
The lady that comes along...

842
01:01:54,342 --> 01:01:56,111
It's okay. It's Norma.

843
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:59,148
<i>Hey, Norma.
¿Como estas?</i>

844
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:01,083
Come here, baby.

845
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:03,485
-How are you?
-Hey, Mickey.

846
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:08,156
-Sorry about your family, man.
-It's okay.

847
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:12,293
Here's 30K in cash,

848
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:14,931
and two plane tickets to
Beijing.

849
01:02:17,065 --> 01:02:19,168
You got the passports ready?
The new ones?

850
01:02:19,768 --> 01:02:22,137
Got 'em. Good as new.

851
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:26,909
All right. Take care of her.

852
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:28,244
Hey.

853
01:02:30,445 --> 01:02:31,780
You're gonna be all right.

854
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,050
I promise you that, okay?

855
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:37,186
Go visit your grandparents
and have a good time, all right?

856
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:40,088
All right. Go.

857
01:02:40,922 --> 01:02:43,491
Take care, kid.

858
01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:46,095
<i>-Come on, mija.
-Go.</i>

859
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:48,330
You'll be all right.

860
01:02:48,362 --> 01:02:50,899
Have a safe journey.

861
01:03:21,797 --> 01:03:23,264
What the heck?

862
01:03:23,297 --> 01:03:24,899
It's okay.

863
01:03:24,932 --> 01:03:26,835
Mickey, is that you?

864
01:03:27,835 --> 01:03:28,837
Yeah, it's me.

865
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:31,273
Look, Dora.

866
01:03:31,306 --> 01:03:36,912
Dora, there's something
going on now.

867
01:03:36,945 --> 01:03:38,914
I want to talk to you about it.

868
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:41,117
I haven't seen you
since I was a kid, you know?

869
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:47,222
But, I don't want anything
to happen to you.

870
01:03:49,023 --> 01:03:51,527
There's some very dangerous
people.

871
01:03:51,827 --> 01:03:53,596
They might try to hurt you.

872
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,532
Here's 20,000.

873
01:03:57,164 --> 01:03:59,033
I don't want to go nowhere.

874
01:03:59,034 --> 01:04:00,302
-Listen to me.
-No...

875
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:01,503
-This is serious!
-No, no.

876
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:04,405
This is not a joke!
Listen to me.

877
01:04:04,438 --> 01:04:07,576
Now, you're drunk as usual, but
you're gonna listen to me now.

878
01:04:07,608 --> 01:04:10,246
You're gonna take this money
and you're going to Ireland

879
01:04:10,278 --> 01:04:12,481
until I tell you to come back.

880
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:15,418
Do you hear me?
This is not a fucking joke.

881
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,253
-How much?
-20,000.

882
01:04:18,286 --> 01:04:20,121
-How much?
-20,000.

883
01:04:20,355 --> 01:04:22,090
-Really?
-Yes.

884
01:04:22,123 --> 01:04:24,292
Hector, get her ready.
Get her stuff ready.

885
01:04:24,525 --> 01:04:27,962
Let's get her to the airport.

886
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:31,467
There was never any time
for that before. Why now?

887
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:36,172
Please, get ready. Please.

888
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,453
<i>Chingao.</i>

889
01:04:54,556 --> 01:04:57,126
Hey, Hector,
where the fuck are ya, holmes?

890
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,327
Hey, homeboy.

891
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,562
I'm over here in Soto, man,
checking out some firepower.

892
01:05:00,594 --> 01:05:04,399
Yeah, right. You're probably just
trying to get into that electric car

893
01:05:04,432 --> 01:05:06,034
all night or something, holmes.

894
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:08,269
It's hard to stay away from,
right?

895
01:05:08,302 --> 01:05:09,371
Think I'll steal it.

896
01:05:10,505 --> 01:05:12,207
Yeah, wait till you're done
with the job,

897
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:13,074
and then, you can steal it.

898
01:05:15,143 --> 01:05:17,413
All right, hurry up.
I'm waiting on you.

899
01:05:37,398 --> 01:05:39,234
-Yeah?
-Where's Rudy?

900
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:42,137
Rudy is getting ready to blast.

901
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:45,273
There's a time for war
and a time for peace.

902
01:05:45,306 --> 01:05:48,242
<i>Then, war it is.
What you need from me, cariño?</i>

903
01:05:48,275 --> 01:05:50,611
Hey, I haven't heard from
Hector. Have you heard from him?

904
01:05:50,644 --> 01:05:52,081
<i>Nada, mijo.</i>

905
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:57,086
<i>Look, I need you to bring
some fuego in your purse.</i>

906
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,588
I always have fire in my purse.
I need my soul.

907
01:06:00,621 --> 01:06:05,126
Hey, I got all the info we
needed. Everything's set up.

908
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:07,096
I got Woo King's address.

909
01:06:07,128 --> 01:06:09,230
He's now in Los Feliz.

910
01:06:09,264 --> 01:06:11,367
I'll see you guys at Beverly
and Highland, 30 minutes.

911
01:06:20,641 --> 01:06:24,512
Mickey, we gotta pull into that
park because I left the AKs.

912
01:06:25,213 --> 01:06:29,118
Hermano, fuck,
you left the AK's in a park?

913
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:31,185
Fuck.

914
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:33,456
All right, just...
We'll go in and get 'em.

915
01:06:46,134 --> 01:06:47,635
What's wrong?

916
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,706
That's Mickey Solis's car.
I know it. I know that car.

917
01:06:51,739 --> 01:06:53,308
He uses it on runs.

918
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:56,210
I got his ass!
I got his ass! I got his ass!

919
01:06:56,244 --> 01:06:58,646
Arresting someone's
worth more than head?

920
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,019
Arresting Mickey Solis,
I'll get a big bonus.

921
01:07:04,518 --> 01:07:06,187
Hey, where's my c-note?

922
01:07:07,155 --> 01:07:09,525
You want to get arrested, bitch?
Get out.

923
01:07:09,557 --> 01:07:11,326
Get out. Fuck off.

924
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:13,161
Fuck off, you bastard.

925
01:07:25,773 --> 01:07:26,775
Detective.

926
01:07:27,108 --> 01:07:29,210
I see you made bail.
Where'd you get the dough?

927
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:30,713
I thought you'd kinda lost
all your dough

928
01:07:31,045 --> 01:07:32,647
from that sour deal
that went down last year.

929
01:07:33,114 --> 01:07:34,682
Well, it's a land of
opportunity,

930
01:07:34,715 --> 01:07:37,351
and I'm, trying
to make a comeback

931
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:39,188
after all my heartache lately.

932
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,456
Where's your boy scouts at?

933
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:43,425
I'm off duty, churrosucker.

934
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:48,262
Well, you know, sir,
discrimination is against the law.

935
01:07:48,295 --> 01:07:50,631
And so is prostitution.

936
01:07:50,664 --> 01:07:52,534
I hear that they're doing about,
I don't know,

937
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:56,204
about a thousand dollar fine
nowadays?

938
01:07:57,072 --> 01:07:58,640
So, I suppose it's not gonna
make much difference

939
01:07:58,672 --> 01:08:02,210
if I spill your hot sauce all over
this car, which is probably stolen.

940
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,846
Hey, we're clean.

941
01:08:05,112 --> 01:08:08,216
Stay in the fuckin' car.
I'm calling this in.

942
01:08:12,554 --> 01:08:13,289
<i>Chingao.</i>

943
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:18,560
Mona, you gotta take this
fuckin' guy and make him good.

944
01:08:18,792 --> 01:08:20,595
Do something, baby.
Sex him up.

945
01:08:20,628 --> 01:08:22,530
Make it...
Make this shit go away.

946
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:24,600
<i>We're gonna do nine years, mami
. Go.</i>

947
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:26,635
Make it happen, baby.

948
01:08:28,136 --> 01:08:29,505
<i>Chingal.</i>

949
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,743
Okay, 1-Adam-7, 1-Adam-7.

950
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,615
Hey now, hold that...
Hold that call.

951
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:42,717
<i>Hey, I thought I told you
to get your culo in the car.</i>

952
01:08:43,518 --> 01:08:46,788
-You got your pillow?
-Yeah, I got it here with me.

953
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,890
If she don't make it happen,
bro, you gotta blast him.

954
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:51,460
<i>-You gotta blast him...
-Chingao, man.</i>

955
01:08:53,862 --> 01:08:58,266
Come on. I can walk a line for
you, if you want.

956
01:08:58,867 --> 01:08:59,802
Please, come on.

957
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,137
Hey, you look sexy,
but I don't do beaners.

958
01:09:02,337 --> 01:09:03,372
How do you call me?

959
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,309
Do you think you're gonna stop me
from calling this in, you beanhead?

960
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:09,812
What do you call me?

961
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:11,780
What do you call me, bastard?

962
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,886
Fucking make it happen.

963
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,721
Hit him hard.

964
01:09:23,757 --> 01:09:24,760
Let's go!

965
01:09:38,907 --> 01:09:42,811
<i>Hermanos, you go in the back,
I go in the front.</i>

966
01:09:43,912 --> 01:09:46,648
-Let's take out Woo King.
-Right on.

967
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,650
Mona, stick with Mickey.
Cover him.

968
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,920
Are you crazy?
I go with you. You are my man.

969
01:09:52,253 --> 01:09:53,755
I go with you everywhere.

970
01:09:53,787 --> 01:09:54,755
Okay, come on.

971
01:10:21,349 --> 01:10:23,619
I'm asking you one more time
again.

972
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,221
I won't repeat myself.

973
01:10:26,453 --> 01:10:28,657
Is there any way
you can send me more security?

974
01:10:29,256 --> 01:10:30,558
Five is not enough.

975
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:34,363
You know these Mexicans.
They're insane.

976
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:38,833
Mr. King, no one knows you're
here.

977
01:10:39,266 --> 01:10:41,569
You are in my house.
It's safe.

978
01:10:42,703 --> 01:10:44,939
Mr. Solis will never know
you're here.

979
01:10:44,972 --> 01:10:46,807
You're worried, Mr. King.

980
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:48,577
The Art of War:

981
01:10:48,609 --> 01:10:50,746
"The principle controlling
a large army

982
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,815
is the same as controlling
a few men."

983
01:12:47,595 --> 01:12:49,831
Woo King!

984
01:12:49,863 --> 01:12:51,099
You're mine!

985
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,503
Solis, you liar.

986
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:57,472
You lied to me.

987
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:24,867
You lied to me.

988
01:13:29,537 --> 01:13:32,474
Come on down, Emperor!
It's your day to die!

989
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:42,918
Mickey. Mickey.

990
01:13:43,618 --> 01:13:45,754
Time to go to the loo.

991
01:13:49,556 --> 01:13:51,092
The loo?

992
01:13:54,462 --> 01:13:55,631
Rudy?

993
01:13:59,434 --> 01:14:00,002
Rudy?

994
01:14:11,445 --> 01:14:13,015
Rudy! Mona!

995
01:14:45,512 --> 01:14:47,248
Let me cool you off.

996
01:14:56,890 --> 01:15:00,094
Mr. Solis, I am only a rose.

997
01:15:00,862 --> 01:15:05,667
Should a rose suffer
because it nears the thorns?

998
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:08,237
Fuck your Chinese philosophy.

999
01:15:10,637 --> 01:15:14,609
Mr. Solis, I negotiated
your mother's safety.

1000
01:16:07,127 --> 01:16:09,197
Rudy?

1001
01:16:09,229 --> 01:16:11,265
Mona?

1002
01:16:18,038 --> 01:16:20,975
Rudy! Rudy!

1003
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,677
Mona!

1004
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:13,261
Rudy.

1005
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:16,230
Mona.

1006
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:17,733
<i>Venganza!</i>

1007
01:17:34,414 --> 01:17:36,251
Do you know, Mickey?

1008
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:40,755
Do you know what plans we have
with your granddaughter?

1009
01:17:42,856 --> 01:17:45,126
When we steal her,

1010
01:17:45,158 --> 01:17:48,395
we're going to make sweet
one six million dollars

1011
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:51,099
for one movie.

1012
01:17:51,131 --> 01:17:55,136
Russians pay top dollars, snuff
film from your granddaughter.

1013
01:17:56,136 --> 01:17:59,073
Come on, I got something sweet
for you!

1014
01:17:59,106 --> 01:18:01,109
The taste of your own blood!

1015
01:18:06,913 --> 01:18:10,786
You die today,
you fuckin' evil bastard!

1016
01:18:51,425 --> 01:18:55,831
Chinese, we're the smartest
race.

1017
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,333
We shall overcome all.

1018
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:03,837
The dragon shall consume
Mexico and America.

1019
01:19:03,871 --> 01:19:06,240
It shall consume it like a fire,

1020
01:19:07,274 --> 01:19:10,311
and take its gold, its land,
even its children.

1021
01:19:11,345 --> 01:19:13,515
You shall bow before our feet.

1022
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:15,484
We shall be like a god.

1023
01:19:15,949 --> 01:19:17,284
God!

1024
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:39,941
Hey!

1025
01:20:02,863 --> 01:20:06,433
Mr. Harrison, please, turn
around.

1026
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:10,105
I have your final payment for
you.

1027
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:14,341
I remember you said that you
loved the Mexican community,

1028
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:16,344
that you embraced it.

1029
01:20:18,912 --> 01:20:22,550
But you forgot one thing, one
word.

1030
01:20:25,819 --> 01:20:27,855
<i>Venganza.</i>
