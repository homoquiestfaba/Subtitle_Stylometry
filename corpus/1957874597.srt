0
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:44,870
Holly?

1
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,655
Ooh, not yet.

2
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,502
Just going to get you to close
those eyes for me.

3
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:50,441
Perfect, yep.
Just keep them closed.

4
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,245
It'll be so much better
for the final reveal.

5
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:52,965
Just trust me.

6
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,489
Oh, okay.

7
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:56,143
Well uh, did you want some
hot cocoa?

8
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:57,555
Oh yeah, I'd love some.
That'd be awesome.

9
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,686
Okay, see you in a little bit.

10
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,189
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

11
00:00:59,363 --> 00:00:59,885
Oh.

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,061
Okay.

13
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:06,414
I got you, I got you.

14
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,331
That thing is deceptively heavy.

15
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:11,897
Yeah.

16
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,592
And uh, why was it
in your living room?

17
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:15,442
Well, everybody keeps
their best holiday décor

18
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:17,860
for parties in their living room
so it's accessible.

19
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:19,644
I will have to take
your word for it.

20
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:23,039
Wow.

21
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:25,998
Holly, it looks beautiful
back here.

22
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:27,783
Thank you.

23
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:29,630
Yeah, my client is a really
good friend of Eve's

24
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:31,632
so I'm pulling out all of
the stops for this party.

25
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:33,571
Promotion still dangling
in the balance, huh?

26
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,007
Holly, I'm so close.

27
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:38,054
You are the most hardworking,

28
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:41,405
kind and seriously creative
party planner.

29
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,147
Well, at least in
the Greater Denver Area.

30
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,584
She would be silly
not to give it to you.

31
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:48,630
Well if I do get that
lead planner position,

32
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:52,155
then I won't have to beg my best
friend to spend her lunch break

33
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,026
dragging stuff across town
for me.

34
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:56,507
Well at least I won't have to go
to the gym later.

35
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:57,681
So win-win.

36
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,380
Speaking of gym,

37
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:02,818
how did your date go with super
hot trainer Matt?

38
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:06,474
Uh yeah, I, I didn't go.

39
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,476
Why not?

40
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,236
It's just that I really want
to focus on work right now.

41
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,870
You can't put your life
on hold forever.

42
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:13,698
It's not forever.

43
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:15,023
Eve promised that she would
have an answer for me

44
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,353
by the end of the year.

45
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:18,399
Well then promise me you
will call Matt

46
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:22,098
as soon as Eve tells you that
you are the new lead planner.

47
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:26,494
Because those biceps?
Too good to waste.

48
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:27,886
Stop it.

49
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,279
Okay, you have my word.

50
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:31,586
Oh shoot.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,109
Um, I gotta run.

52
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,851
Oh, new boss
putting you to work?

53
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,940
Something like that.

54
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:39,376
See you soon.

55
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,595
Okay.

56
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,510
Bye, thank you again.

57
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:07,056
Hi Eve.

58
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:07,926
Holly?

59
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,100
Great news.

60
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:10,451
You have a new client.

61
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,017
Another one?

62
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,890
Uh yes, a huge one.
Pine Architecture?

63
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,413
Oh wait. Pine Architecture.

64
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,459
Uh, my friend Blaire
works there.

65
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,156
I know.

66
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,050
She is the one who referred you
for the job.

67
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,570
When you're all done with Faith
I need you to head down there.

68
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:25,335
Do you think you can make it
by 3:30?

69
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:27,294
Uh, sure. Yes.

70
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:28,588
That shouldn't be a problem.

71
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,384
That is my girl.

72
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:32,100
Swing by the office on your way
and pick up the brief.

73
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,474
Oh, and there is one condition.

74
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,215
You have to work
with the owner's son.

75
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,652
He wants him involved
in the entire process.

76
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,175
I think he's interested

77
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,457
in getting into events
or something,

78
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,178
I'm not really sure.

79
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,200
But he was very adamant
that he was heavily involved

80
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,573
in all your work.

81
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:47,314
Yeah, yeah, that's no biggie.

82
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,925
I've had weirder client requests
before, so.

83
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,622
You're crushing it girl.

84
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,383
I can't wait to see what you do
with this party.

85
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:54,756
Yeah, and...

86
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,061
just before you go.

87
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,411
Anything about the, you know,

88
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,239
the promotion?

89
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,110
I pitched you to
the board today.

90
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,460
Knock this one out of the park
and you're a shoe in.

91
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,854
Great. That's great.
Thank you, Eve.

92
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:07,159
Of course.
Go get em, kiddo.

93
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,073
I'll see you tomorrow.

94
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,249
Okay. Bye.

95
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:12,643
Okay.

96
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,476
Blaire, why didn't you tell me?

97
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,043
It wasn't confirmed.

98
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:22,817
I was just waiting for it
to be official.

99
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,397
Oh uh, I gotta take this.
See you soon?

100
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,007
Oh okay. Okay,
I'll see you soon.

101
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:30,531
Bye.

102
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:35,579
Afternoon Patsy.

103
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:37,494
Hi.

104
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,342
I would love a peppermint mocha
when you get a chance

105
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,126
and also any gift suggestions
you might have.

106
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,521
I'm meeting a new client today.

107
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,501
Oh, how exciting.

108
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:48,113
We just got some new handmade
ceramics in over on the wall.

109
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,550
Would make a great gift.

110
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,639
That would be perfect.
Thank you.

111
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:01,866
Here.

112
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,520
Oh. Thank you.

113
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,348
It's my duty to serve

114
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,239
the vertically challenged
individuals in my community.

115
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:08,699
Oh, well I'm glad

116
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,329
you're putting your talents
to good use.

117
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,180
Thank you.

118
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:12,573
- Oh.
- Oh.

119
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,618
I think you owe me.

120
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,534
Yeah, I think you getting
something down off the top shelf

121
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,016
and me giving you the last of
the best coffee in Denver

122
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,409
aren't quite equal.

123
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,497
I beg to differ.

124
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,849
I really need this
to impress a client.

125
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:31,418
And I really need that coffee
because it's my favorite.

126
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,202
Oh. That's solid reasoning.

127
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:34,595
Okay.

128
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,336
Patsy? Do you have
another shipment

129
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,310
of the Christmas blend
coming in anytime soon?

130
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:42,864
Oh sorry. That's the last of it
till next Christmas.

131
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,519
Okay. Of course it is.

132
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:50,088
Listen, I'm sure that you and
my client are totally comparable

133
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:54,528
and equally admirable recipients
of this incredibly rare coffee.

134
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:58,183
But how about I play you for it?

135
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,099
Rock paper scissors,
in the spirit of Christmas.

136
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,536
Are you serious?

137
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,755
As a snowstorm.

138
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,148
Fine.

139
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,105
Ooh.

140
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,456
- Oh dang.
- Yeah.

141
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,848
Best out of three?

142
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:12,459
I mean it's only fair.

143
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:15,157
Huh.

144
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,813
Aww.

145
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:20,162
That's what I thought.

146
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:23,295
Well, you win fair and square.

147
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,993
Don't say I never did anything
for you.

148
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,647
I wouldn't dream of it.

149
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,871
For you, Christmas blend black

150
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,483
and for you, peppermint mocha.

151
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:38,006
Thank you.

152
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:39,529
Ooh, bitter.

153
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:40,703
Sweet.

154
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,422
Oh, they should've been
the other way around.

155
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,882
I am so sorry.

156
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:46,710
No worries.

157
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,993
I'm still getting used to
this online ordering system.

158
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,323
Hey, online ordering
is the way of the future.

159
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:52,934
All the local shops
are doing it.

160
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:54,588
Hmm. Well if the old way works.

161
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,154
Gotta innovate to stay relevant.

162
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:57,591
Whatever you say.

163
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:00,376
There.

164
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,856
Thank you.

165
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,510
Thank you, Patsy.
You have a nice day.

166
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,816
Charge it on my account.

167
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,165
Tall guy.

168
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:08,558
Coffee girl.

169
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,256
Uh.

170
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,170
Oh, don't worry.
She paid for you.

171
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,694
Oh.

172
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:17,480
Merry Christmas.

173
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,836
Hi, how can I help you?

174
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,272
Hi.

175
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,970
I am here to see Mr. Pine
at 3:30.

176
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:31,015
Ooh. I got it.

177
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:32,364
- Hey.
- Hi.

178
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:33,844
This place is so cool.

179
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:35,542
I know.

180
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:36,456
You should come back here
and see the models.

181
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,413
They are stunning.

182
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:38,719
Okay.

183
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,045
So I need to finish setting up
for the meeting.

184
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,133
Can I get you anything
while you wait?

185
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:43,941
Hot cocoa, coffee, tea?

186
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:45,726
I'm okay.

187
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,181
Okay, well I'll come back
and get you when I'm done.

188
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:48,032
- Take your coat?
- Oh, thank you.

189
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:49,206
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

190
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:57,389
Hey.

191
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,261
Hey, uh, can you...

192
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:00,828
What is that?

193
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,394
It's called Christmas spirit.

194
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,222
What, you don't like it?

195
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:06,486
Hey. Do you have any recent
updates on the design?

196
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,202
Because we need to get that
over to engineering.

197
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,786
When I do you will be
the first to know,

198
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,467
but in the meantime
can you make getting me

199
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,051
the design software
priority numero uno?

200
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,232
Already on it.

201
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:15,973
Thank you.

202
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:17,322
Jingle bells, jingle bells...

203
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,935
Blaire.

204
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,502
Yes sir?

205
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:23,415
Did the model blueprint
get to Theo?

206
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,242
On its way now.

207
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,244
Great.

208
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,092
And everything's all squared
away with that party planner?

209
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,814
Uh yeah, yeah.
She's ready to go.

210
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:33,817
Do you think she'll work well
with Theo?

211
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,950
Holly Green is the kindest,

212
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:38,343
warmest, hardest working
person I know.

213
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,955
But she takes no nonsense
from no one,

214
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,566
so she'll give Theo
a run for his money.

215
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,962
What bet did you lose?

216
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,398
Oh, you didn't know?

217
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,226
I'm actually Santa Claus
moonlighting

218
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,619
as your office manager.

219
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,360
Now get back to work.

220
00:08:59,147 --> 00:08:59,887
What's this?

221
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,192
For the pitch.

222
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,933
I said digital.

223
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,326
Richard approved it.

224
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,328
What am I supposed
to do with this?

225
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:07,808
I don't know, build it.

226
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:09,897
Build it?

227
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,072
Ready?

228
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,554
Uh, yeah.

229
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,868
Hi.

230
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:27,828
Afternoon everyone.
Shall we begin?

231
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,264
As many of you know,

232
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:30,874
we have put in a bid
to the mayor

233
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,808
to design and build Denver's
new city center.

234
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:35,594
This would be
Pine Architecture's

235
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,359
first commercial contract

236
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:40,405
and it would be instrumental in
pushing us into bigger builds.

237
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,972
Now this is just a placeholder

238
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:43,646
until we get our design
up and running,

239
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,454
but you can see
what I'm going for.

240
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,370
Modern, svelte, the future.

241
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:52,461
The future of Pine Architecture
is commercial,

242
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:53,915
and we need to show
Mayor Donahue

243
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:55,595
that we are a hub of innovation.

244
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,988
What about the Christmas party?

245
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:59,729
What about it?

246
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,359
Well the Christmas party's
our ace in the hole.

247
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,080
Mayor Donahue attends
every year and...

248
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,189
A Christmas party is not going
to sway Mayor Donahue

249
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:06,518
into giving us the contract.

250
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,133
I've looked into it
and we are by far

251
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,913
the least technologically
advanced firm.

252
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,152
But as I said, we have an
advantage over the other guys.

253
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:13,874
Mayor Donahue knows us.

254
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,571
His values align
with our values,

255
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,465
the Christmas party
is as much of a priority

256
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,531
as is the pitch itself.

257
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:23,100
Which is why I've hired you
a party planner.

258
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:26,016
- Coffee girl?
- Tall guy?

259
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,888
Hi Holly.

260
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:30,020
Mr. Pine, I assume.
Nice to meet you.

261
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:31,021
What are you doing here?

262
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,893
You two know each other.

263
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:36,984
- Know would be a stretch.
- Sort of...

264
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:40,683
Uh, Holly Green
with Encore Events.

265
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,946
It's nice to officially
meet you.

266
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,079
Nice to officially meet you,
Miss Green.

267
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:49,910
And since you are
the son of my client,

268
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,084
these are for you.

269
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:52,913
Oh.

270
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,089
Charming how that worked out.

271
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,395
Best coffee in Denver.

272
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,049
So I've heard.

273
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:01,878
Well um, I think that's enough
for today.

274
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,619
Why don't we get back to work

275
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:07,405
and let Holly and Theo
get this party started?

276
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,016
Literally.

277
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,627
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

278
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,980
And then there were two.

279
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,034
Okay, I'm not entirely sure
how this worked out.

280
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:22,116
Your father sent in a form
and signed a brief.

281
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,987
Oh, so you already have
the brief?

282
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:24,901
Yeah, I do.

283
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,381
Perfect.

284
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,075
Well, just do whatever it says
in there

285
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,186
and I will be in my office
if you need me.

286
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,559
Oh, but I...

287
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,015
No, uh, I really gotta get back
to this.

288
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,997
Oh, uh yeah.

289
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:38,045
I think I forgot my coffee.

290
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,359
Well that was a quick meeting.

291
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,057
She already had the briefs,
so...

292
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,930
I know you think a flashy pitch
is the key

293
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,977
to landing this contract,
but that's just not the case.

294
00:11:57,151 --> 00:12:00,067
You need to show Mayor Donahue
why he'd want to work with you.

295
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:01,851
Of course they want to work
with us, Dad.

296
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,941
Not us, Theo. You.

297
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:07,857
You need to show him
that you understand,

298
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,860
that your values align with his.

299
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:12,751
The Christmas party's
the easiest way to do that.

300
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:13,994
The Christmas party...

301
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,257
Let me make myself very clear.

302
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:19,477
You'll work with Holly to plan
every aspect of this party,

303
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:23,003
or I'll remove us from
the running of the contract.

304
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:27,094
Whoa, that's a little drastic,
don't you think?

305
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:29,923
I mean I'm happy to help out
if it means that much.

306
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,533
It does.

307
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,058
Okay then.
I'll do it.

308
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:42,022
You mean like right now,
like right this very second?

309
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,027
Okay then.

310
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,201
I will do it.

311
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:51,640
I will get that mistletoe.

312
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:58,952
Holly? Holly?

313
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:00,518
Wait.

314
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,259
Oh.

315
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:04,150
Did you finish all of that
very important paperwork

316
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,175
that you had in there?

317
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:06,349
It would seem that I did.

318
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:08,526
Oh, okay. Good.

319
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,615
Wait.

320
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,966
I am here to help plan
the party.

321
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,750
Can't be too hard, right?

322
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:16,641
Just order some fake snow
and call it a day, right?

323
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,275
Oh.

324
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:19,818
Have you ever planned a
Christmas party before?

325
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,889
Um, no, but how hard can it be?

326
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:24,063
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

327
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:25,108
I think you're right.

328
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:26,346
You should let me handle it.

329
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,981
Wait.

330
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:31,898
Uh, this Christmas party is
very important to my father,

331
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:34,267
and maybe I haven't planned a
Christmas party before per se

332
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:38,905
but I am here to help you
with whatever you need.

333
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,123
Let me know.

334
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,995
So you feel bad about earlier?

335
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:45,955
Honestly, I am just gutted.

336
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,219
My sincerest condolences
for my unprofessional behavior.

337
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:50,612
Mmm-hmm.

338
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,135
Okay wait...

339
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:57,967
I am sorry because I was
rude and dismissive

340
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:02,058
and that was wrong.
I was wrong.

341
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,060
So please accept my apology,

342
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,324
because I do want to make this
the perfect Christmas party.

343
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:11,024
Okay, but you have
to follow my lead.

344
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:12,677
You can't just order fake snow

345
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,115
and pick out the first
Christmas tree you find.

346
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,117
- Got it?
- Got it.

347
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,901
Okay. I'll be back tomorrow.

348
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:20,468
Start helping out.

349
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:24,124
Why don't you get
some comfortable shoes?

350
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:27,997
What's wrong with my shoes?

351
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,043
These are comfy.

352
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:34,612
Have a, have a good day.

353
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:42,097
Mom? Dad?

354
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:43,273
We're in here.

355
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,846
Dad, is that cookie
supposed to be you?

356
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,239
Ha.

357
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:53,413
What makes you say that?

358
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:57,331
Hey, how was your event
today, sweetie?

359
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:58,985
It was great.

360
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,597
And I got a new client.
Pine Architecture.

361
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,425
Where Blaire works!

362
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,272
Yeah. I guess she was the one
that got me the job.

363
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,385
And Eve said that this
one might be the one

364
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,039
that pushes me right
over the edge,

365
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:12,824
so hopefully the board agrees.

366
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,261
That promotion is way overdue.

367
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,827
Hear, hear.

368
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,133
Thank you.

369
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:18,830
Hello, hello.
Sorry, I'm late.

370
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,398
Ooh, something smells nice.

371
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,924
What did I miss?

372
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:28,318
Well, Dad is making
cookie self-portraits

373
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:29,972
for the neighbors.

374
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,408
Again?

375
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:32,603
What do you think?
Pretty good, huh?

376
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:33,323
It's a spitting image.

377
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,369
Breathtaking.

378
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,980
Felix, your parents don't
have any dietary restrictions,

379
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,851
do they?

380
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:42,047
Well, it would explain why
they never eat my cooking.

381
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,160
But no, they love their gluten
and dairy.

382
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,770
Good.

383
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,139
Because the Green family
breakfast for dinner

384
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:48,163
is full of both.

385
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:48,860
Felix: Excellent.

386
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,514
Okay.

387
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:52,362
Dad, I notice that now
the upstairs hallway

388
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,954
also doesn't have a real floor.

389
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:56,520
Yeah.

390
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:58,435
I saw this really cool trick
with tiles

391
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,849
on the internet last week
and thought I'd give it a shot.

392
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,223
So I guess the guest bathroom
is finally done, huh?

393
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:04,224
No.

394
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:05,921
No, no, no, no, no.

395
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,031
Yeah, Dad likes to start
a new project

396
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,926
before the current one
is finished.

397
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,841
Aw. I mean,
that's not true.

398
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:16,192
I did take down the old curtains
before I installed the new ones.

399
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:17,367
True.

400
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,562
I don't think that counts, dear.

401
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:19,891
Yeah well.

402
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:20,892
Don't worry,
it'll all be done by...

403
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:21,763
Done by Christmas.

404
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:22,937
What, it will!

405
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,071
Come on. It will.

406
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:28,204
Uh, Joy?

407
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:36,386
Is there something you want
to tell us?

408
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,301
What's going on?

409
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:42,392
We were going to tell you
later tonight, but...

410
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:43,872
Oh my.

411
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,134
Both: We're pregnant.

412
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:46,527
What?

413
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,138
Oh my god, this is so exciting.

414
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:50,835
This is amazing.

415
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,576
Oh.

416
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,101
This is going to be the
best Christmas gift ever.

417
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,234
Come here.

418
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,116
Ooh.

419
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,292
So, if it's a girl

420
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:15,164
you're definitely naming it
after me, right?

421
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,905
You know Dad asked me
the same thing.

422
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,038
Oh, of course.

423
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,171
Gosh.

424
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,305
You guys seem really happy.

425
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,610
Mmm.

426
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,354
How did you know that he was
the right one,

427
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:34,618
like, or that it was
the right time?

428
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:41,495
Well, I don't know such a thing
as the right time exists.

429
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:46,978
But Felix is my best friend.

430
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,242
Where I stop, he starts.

431
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,071
He compliments me
in all the best ways.

432
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:56,858
Are you having second thoughts
about ending things with Nate?

433
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,032
No.

434
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:00,905
Nate was... great.

435
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,040
You know, perfect even.
Just not perfect for me.

436
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,497
But you know what, I don't even
have time to date right now.

437
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,392
I just, I'm focused
on this promotion.

438
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:12,961
Once I get it, things slow down,
then I will consider it.

439
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,050
I'll consider it maybe.
Maybe.

440
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:19,054
Here.

441
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:20,838
I want you to promise me
something.

442
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:23,189
Anything.

443
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:29,238
When love finds you,
you let it in.

444
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,501
Even if it doesn't feel like
the right time,

445
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:35,897
or it doesn't look exactly
like how you thought.

446
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:39,422
Promise me you'll
give it a shot.

447
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:43,513
I promise.

448
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,124
Good.

449
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:47,082
Okay, who's up for
Christmas charades?

450
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,563
- Let's do it.
- Let's do this.

451
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:51,173
I call these guys.

452
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,573
Glad you feel right at home.

453
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,141
Hey.

454
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:05,796
What?

455
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,146
Nothing.

456
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:10,105
Can you help me with something?

457
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,585
Uh yeah, sure.

458
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:19,549
Oh, thank you for getting those
floor plans approved so quickly.

459
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,464
Not a problem.

460
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:22,900
What's it say?

461
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:23,858
Uh, six feet.

462
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,251
Great.

463
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:26,991
Oh!

464
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,428
I'm so sorry.

465
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:29,255
It's tricks,
tricks of the trade.

466
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:30,429
Hey, Holly.

467
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:31,953
Hi, Mr. Pine.

468
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,367
What's first on the list today?

469
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,522
I was thinking Christmas tree.

470
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,611
Christmas tree.
My favorite part.

471
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:40,962
Me too. I promise
I won't disappoint.

472
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,833
Great.

473
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,444
Okay, let's measure the space

474
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:47,534
for the tree so um,
could you hold this?

475
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,318
- Yep.
- Like that, perfect.

476
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:51,277
- Sorry. Sorry.
- It's okay.

477
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:55,585
Oh, I got it.
Yeah. I'm good.

478
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,805
- Uh...
- A little higher.

479
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,372
Okay.

480
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:00,634
Higher.

481
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:03,376
Significantly higher.

482
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,770
Smidge lower.

483
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,556
Mmm, split the difference.

484
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,517
Ten feet. Perfect.

485
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:16,234
I'm pretty sure no one's going
to notice the actual height

486
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,868
of the Christmas tree, though.

487
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,653
Well, maybe not consciously.

488
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:21,747
But if it's too small,
it's going to feel sparse.

489
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,665
If it's too big, it's going
to feel overcrowded.

490
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:25,504
And subconsciously
they're going to feel like

491
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,539
their entire experience
of this party is ruined.

492
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,661
Just get your coat.

493
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,098
Okay.

494
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,154
Isn't this place magical?

495
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:46,332
Oh yeah, yep.

496
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:49,030
But I just know we are going
to find the perfect tree here.

497
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:50,466
I feel it in my bones.

498
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,338
Whatever you say, boss.

499
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:57,386
Hey. What's up?

500
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,215
Nothing, it's just I have
a lot going on at the office

501
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:02,826
with the pitch.

502
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,265
That one looks right, yeah?

503
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,354
No, it's definitely too short.

504
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,550
Also, I need to be able
to hang ornaments,

505
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:13,446
lights, garland.

506
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,274
Oh yeah.

507
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,208
So if there's so much going on
back at the office,

508
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:20,061
why was your dad so adamant
about you being involved

509
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:23,151
in the party planning process?

510
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,066
If you don't mind me asking.

511
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,044
You mean all of your clients
don't make their offspring

512
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:29,549
participate in your trades?

513
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,202
Yeah, no.

514
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,943
This would be a first for me.

515
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,554
That makes two of us.

516
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,164
So tell me about the pitch.

517
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,905
Well, I put in a bid
to design and build

518
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,559
Denver's new city centre,

519
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,430
but it's just not going
according to plan.

520
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:43,867
You bit off more than
you could chew?

521
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,695
No, no, no, no.

522
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:48,350
I think that Pine Architecture
could do very well

523
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,221
in the commercial sphere,

524
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,396
but I feel like going so hard
right out of the gate

525
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:55,270
on the first contract might not
have been the best idea.

526
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,403
We're just so behind
the other companies.

527
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:58,621
Hmm.

528
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,189
Hmm.

529
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,670
I don't know.

530
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:06,499
I mean, those models
that I saw at the office,

531
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:07,935
those are gorgeous.

532
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:10,198
My dad actually makes all those.

533
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,288
We hardly do anything digital.

534
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,421
He still mails handwritten
thank you notes.

535
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:17,118
I think that's sweet.

536
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,250
It is, but we are going to have
to modernize

537
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,470
if we want to move forward.

538
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:24,125
Which is why I was so resistant
to put so much energy

539
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,606
into this whole Christmas party
planning thing,

540
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,260
because I feel like
it's a distraction

541
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,392
from the real presentation.

542
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:33,482
Measuring Christmas trees isn't
going to make anyone innovate.

543
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:37,443
What's wrong with that one?

544
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:38,966
It's not full enough.

545
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,577
Oh. Right. Of course.

546
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:46,452
So, do you always put
in this much effort?

547
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:49,455
Little Christmas parties
are pretty cookie cutter, no?

548
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:53,023
Well, yep. They can be.

549
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:55,591
But I strive to make them
more than that.

550
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,569
I want to create an experience
that my client's

551
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:58,855
going to remember, you know?

552
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:01,205
Something that evokes an emotion

553
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,472
they can look back on years
later after the event and smile.

554
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:08,387
Are we getting warmer?

555
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:13,174
Uh yeah, slightly warmer.
Gotta take your time.

556
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,611
How'd you get into this?
The party planning thing.

557
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:17,570
Oh, in college I studied
hospitality

558
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,963
and event management,
and then after winning

559
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:23,140
a Christmas tree
decorating competition...

560
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:24,881
Oh, I'm shocked.

561
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:27,971
I got an internship at
a big firm in New York,

562
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:29,930
but they only took
on huge clients

563
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:32,411
and I was lacking that
personal connection

564
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:34,848
that I feel like makes events
so important.

565
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:36,806
Like us?

566
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,591
Exactly.

567
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:41,376
Yeah, I want to create
that personal connection

568
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,551
with someone.

569
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:44,118
I want to get to know the client

570
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:45,946
and then make something special
for them.

571
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,036
And I started working for Encore
a couple years ago.

572
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:55,521
Why are you laughing?

573
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,958
I'm not laughing.

574
00:23:58,132 --> 00:23:59,176
- Oh, you're not?
- No.

575
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,526
Don't!

576
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,875
- I wouldn't.
- No?

577
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,267
No!

578
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,880
Okay. All right.

579
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:08,882
Fine. There you go.

580
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:12,538
Oh, I'm going to-

581
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:13,539
Don't, don't.

582
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:14,713
Three, two, one...

583
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:20,633
Oh my... I am so sorry,
Mayor Donahue.

584
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,383
It's fine, Theo.

585
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,298
No need to apologize.

586
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,911
It's been a long time since
I've had a snowball fight.

587
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:38,868
Hey, who won?

588
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,042
I did.

589
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,914
She did.

590
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,219
Anthony Donahue.

591
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:43,393
Hi, nice to meet you.

592
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,787
Pleasure to meet you.

593
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:46,528
Searching for a tree,
are we Theo?

594
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:47,703
Yes, sir.

595
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:49,183
We are for the Christmas party.

596
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,359
Oh, my little Camilla
cannot wait.

597
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,362
She says it's her favorite event
of the year.

598
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,495
All she can talk about is
how excited she is

599
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,932
to see your party.

600
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:00,629
That is very sweet of her.

601
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:03,937
We have Holly Green from
Encore Events on the job

602
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:05,895
so she will not be disappointed.

603
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,984
Oh, and the pitch.

604
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:11,292
I'm very excited to see
the 3D model of your design.

605
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,860
Don't get me wrong,
love the digital stuff.

606
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,577
There's something magical
about what you

607
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,559
and your father put together.

608
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,519
Uh, I'm sorry.

609
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:25,262
Is that a Smith Family Farms
keychain from the grand opening?

610
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:27,438
Absolutely, and every
year since.

611
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:29,266
It's my family's favorite spot.

612
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,790
Ours too!

613
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:32,835
We've gotten a tree here
every year for...

614
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,315
- Ten years.
- Ten years.

615
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:35,577
Exactly.

616
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:36,970
What a small world.

617
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,450
Best kept secret
in all of Denver.

618
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,930
And we want to keep it that way.

619
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:42,104
Agreed.

620
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:46,129
Love to stay, but I have some
Christmas tree shopping

621
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:47,502
to do myself.

622
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,116
Holly, it was a pleasure
to meet you.

623
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:50,679
Nice to meet you.

624
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,222
And Theo, please give my best
to your father

625
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,526
and we'll see you both
very soon.

626
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,596
Okay.

627
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,644
Okay. Your dad was wrong.

628
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:02,430
The party isn't as important
as the pitch,

629
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,911
it's more important.

630
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:07,957
And luckily, I found us
the perfect tree.

631
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:19,534
Holly: Trust me.

632
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,580
The 10 foot tree
is the way to go.

633
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:23,364
I know what I'm talking about.

634
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:24,974
Theo: Okay.

635
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:27,368
Broom hockey.

636
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,544
Hey guys, can we have a turn?

637
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,415
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

638
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,026
Let's play.

639
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:35,550
I'm wearing a suit.

640
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:38,422
Care to make it interesting?

641
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,757
How could we possibly do that?

642
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,993
How about for every goal
that I score,

643
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,474
I get to ask you a question?

644
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,694
Okay. But every time
I score a goal...

645
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:54,003
I get to ask you
a question back.

646
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,439
Deal.

647
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:58,486
Three, two, one.

648
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,140
Ugh.

649
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:05,754
Aww.

650
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:07,168
I forgot to warn you, I'm great.

651
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:12,848
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

652
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:14,067
Okay.

653
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:18,506
Favorite Christmas memory.

654
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,902
Decorating the tree with my
family while drinking hot cocoa.

655
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:24,916
And after we finished,
we'd cozy up by the fire

656
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:27,863
and my grandpa would read us
all a Christmas story.

657
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:29,604
- That sounds magical.
- Mmm-hmm.

658
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:31,998
Three, two, one.

659
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:33,172
Two, one.

660
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,480
Wow. Two for two.

661
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:46,534
Thank you sir, what a gentleman.

662
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:51,582
All right. Favorite
Christmas dessert.

663
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,367
My mom's lemon ginger
ice box cake.

664
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,847
Hands down.

665
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,979
I love lemon ginger
ice box cake.

666
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:59,001
Have you ever had the one
from Leno's on the corner?

667
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:01,854
Uh, Leno's is stellar but still
not quite as good as my mom's.

668
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:03,072
I'm sure.

669
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:07,033
Three, two, one.

670
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,992
Yes!

671
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,125
All right. What you got?

672
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,475
Would you ever strike out
on your own?

673
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:16,042
What do you mean?
Leave Encore?

674
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:18,087
Yeah. Do your own thing.

675
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,611
Yeah. One day.

676
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:23,092
I just want to make sure
I have enough experience.

677
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:24,659
What do you mean?

678
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,313
Well, there's a tier system
at Encore.

679
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,097
You start out as
a junior planner

680
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:29,838
and you work
with a lead planner.

681
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:31,666
And there's my position.

682
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,191
You get to work on small
to medium events on your own.

683
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,063
And then there's lead planner,

684
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:39,630
where you'd have a team
of people that work for you.

685
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,589
Those are the kind of people
that get to do

686
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:44,897
the grand opening
at the City Center.

687
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,942
I just want to get there
before I leave.

688
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:48,814
Make sure I'm really ready.

689
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,554
You seem pretty ready to me.

690
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:55,037
Well, if your Christmas
party goes well,

691
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:58,214
I might be lead planner
by the end of the year.

692
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:00,826
Well I think I should end
on a high note,

693
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,002
and we should get hot chocolate.

694
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,874
Hot cocoa sounds amazing.

695
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:07,136
I'm freezing.

696
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,926
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

697
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,059
Okay, so we need to book
the rentals, hire the caterers,

698
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:20,976
secure decor, and most
importantly, pick a theme.

699
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:25,024
Enter Holly's Christmas
party questionnaire.

700
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,461
It's how I tailor the perfect
party for each client.

701
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:29,115
Okay, themes.

702
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,466
Isn't the theme Christmas?

703
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,468
Sure.

704
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:37,906
But the Christmas genre has
a lot of sub-themes within it.

705
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,971
You know, like Santa's workshop,
winter wonderland,

706
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:42,519
white elephant, crafting.

707
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:44,565
The list goes on and on.

708
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,045
You look overwhelmed.

709
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:49,222
Okay, what does Christmas
mean to you?

710
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:53,052
Good food, maybe?

711
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:55,750
Right. All right.
Um, let's try this.

712
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:58,709
Okay.

713
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:00,122
Don't think about it,
just pick the first three

714
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:01,146
that stand out to you.

715
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,190
What is...

716
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:02,931
Don't think about it.

717
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:04,237
Okay.

718
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:07,022
Nice.

719
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:08,371
Great combination.

720
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:15,988
So, elegant, featuring snow,
with an element of toys.

721
00:30:16,162 --> 00:30:18,033
Upscale North Pole.

722
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:23,560
We can mix elegant with fun,
black tie with a playful twist.

723
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,258
That sounds not terrible.

724
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:28,087
Great. Not terrible is just
a little bit below

725
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,611
what I was aiming for,
but I will take it.

726
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:37,879
So um, those 3D models.
Those are really cool.

727
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:39,074
I've actually never done one.

728
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:40,534
That's my dad's thing.

729
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,623
Well looks like you're going
to have to.

730
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:45,104
I'm not really the best crafter
that's ever lived.

731
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:46,975
What? You?

732
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:48,455
No!

733
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:49,949
But it sounds right up
your alley.

734
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:51,632
Yeah, it definitely is.

735
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:53,262
This one time I was planning
a Christmas party

736
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,896
I couldn't find the right
decorations,

737
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,246
so I just made them out of
clay and pipe cleaners.

738
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,596
Oh wow.
How did that turn out?

739
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,904
Well, the guests tried to
take them home as party favors,

740
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:04,906
so I would say it's
a huge success.

741
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,604
Sounds like it.

742
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:09,998
Well, if you're up for it,

743
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:12,958
I would like to formally
enlist your help.

744
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:14,960
I mean, since I am helping you
plan the party,

745
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:17,223
it's the least you can do.

746
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:20,095
I'd love to help.

747
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:23,098
But it has to be perfect.

748
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:25,013
I think you're being too hard
on yourself.

749
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:28,930
I heard Mayor Donahue talking
about you and the company.

750
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:31,193
He's really rooting for you.

751
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:35,241
And so am I.

752
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,025
Thank you.

753
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:40,159
Okay...

754
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,770
Let's get back to elegance.

755
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,822
You're here late.

756
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:54,260
Just trying to catch up on
everything I missed today.

757
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:57,176
Taking my advice, are we?

758
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,006
Well uh, I may have run
into Mayor Donahue today

759
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,965
and he may have hinted

760
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:08,013
that he would like to see
one of our classic models.

761
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:11,799
- Hmm.
- So you were right.

762
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,976
How did it go with Holly?

763
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,066
Good. Yep. Fine.

764
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,243
She has a very
unconventional way of working.

765
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:22,853
Is that so?

766
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:25,160
Yeah, like not in a bad way.

767
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:29,034
Just... different.

768
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:33,038
I'll leave you to it.

769
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,223
What is the first thing
elves learn in school?

770
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:46,399
Uh, algebra?

771
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:48,923
No, the elfabet.

772
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:51,186
Oh. Ha, ha.
Very funny.

773
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,666
You come up with that yourself?

774
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,363
You need to work on
your material.

775
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:57,236
What, says the guy in
a onesie at the office?

776
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,585
Hey!

777
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,021
This is kind of cute, isn't it?

778
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:01,892
Uh, North Pole chic.

779
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:06,027
What was that?

780
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,073
Ah. What?

781
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:11,946
What, with Nick?

782
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,121
Nothing.

783
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:15,906
Nothing's going on with Nick.

784
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,386
Ew.

785
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,084
If you say so.

786
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,260
Hi, Mr. Pine.

787
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:22,435
Holly, nice to see you.

788
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,045
What's on the docket today?

789
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,457
Actually, I was going
to do a little bit

790
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:26,481
of Christmas shopping.

791
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,006
Get some North Pole décor.

792
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,921
Theo, I was hoping
you'd come with me.

793
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:32,184
I would love to.

794
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:34,925
Great. Okay. Come on.

795
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,932
So, we have a tree topper
and the party favors.

796
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,543
I ordered those lights online,

797
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:45,129
they should be here
in a couple of days.

798
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:47,068
We just still need
the ornaments.

799
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:49,402
I really want to find something
that straddles the line

800
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:52,073
between elegant and playful.

801
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,075
Easier said than done, I assume?

802
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:55,511
Hopefully not.

803
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:56,965
You never know
with these things.

804
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:58,558
What are you looking at?

805
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:00,144
Is that the old city center?
Let me see.

806
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:01,474
Yeah.

807
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,826
Hmm. Looks like it could use
a facelift.

808
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,880
You're an active member
in the Denver community.

809
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,264
And proud of it.

810
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,092
What do you use the space for?

811
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:12,485
I don't.

812
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,183
Why not?

813
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:17,248
I think the outdoor space
is sorely underutilized.

814
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:19,883
I wish they did more, like,
local events out there.

815
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,494
Do you like the building now?

816
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:23,409
Not particularly.

817
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:26,325
If it was up to me, I would
hope that it would stand out.

818
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:29,067
Okay, and how would you do that?

819
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:31,895
Mmm, add glitter probably.

820
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,375
Glitter?

821
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:36,204
Yeah. I'm kidding,
I have no idea.

822
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:39,033
We're missing something.
Focal point.

823
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:42,167
Yeah. Something
that draws you in.

824
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,348
Did you ever come here
on school...

825
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:51,306
- School field trips?
- Yeah.

826
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,439
I'm glad it's quiet today,

827
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:56,050
but man I loved those
when I was a kid.

828
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:57,332
It was my favorite day
of the year.

829
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,053
Oh, mine too.

830
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:00,968
I used to buy my parents
Christmas presents

831
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,536
with the money I saved
from school lunch.

832
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,277
Usually I could only afford
an ornament,

833
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:07,251
but my Dad still puts them
all up on the tree.

834
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:08,976
Aww.

835
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,934
My family does
something similar.

836
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,415
We pick one ornament a year
to represent the whole thing,

837
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:17,506
like a soccer ball
or a graduation cap.

838
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,161
My grandma started it
a long time ago,

839
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:22,207
and it's a tradition
that I hope to carry on

840
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:24,600
with my own family someday.

841
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:27,037
So your Christmas tree
is basically the stories

842
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:29,257
of all your lives
woven together?

843
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:30,650
Exactly.

844
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:39,093
So, which one do you prefer?

845
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:40,529
That one.

846
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,096
You don't seem so sure.

847
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,489
They look the same.

848
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:46,231
Yeah, we'll come back to ribbon.

849
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:49,408
The ornaments are more important
to choose first anyway.

850
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,541
Is that a good gasp
or a bad gasp?

851
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:55,892
Oh, that's a good gasp!
Those are beautiful.

852
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:57,503
What do you think?

853
00:35:57,677 --> 00:35:59,394
I would be as bold as to say
they're perfect.

854
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,246
Me too.

855
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,030
We'll take them all.

856
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:15,390
- Hi.
- Hey.

857
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:16,957
Oh.

858
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:18,611
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I got it.

859
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,439
You got the hot chocolate.

860
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:21,962
Thank you.

861
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:23,136
Let's see what you got.

862
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:26,271
Okay. Here we go.

863
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:30,752
Oh.

864
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,537
That was pretty close.

865
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:32,711
Hmm.

866
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:36,150
That was worse, all right.

867
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:37,325
Last one...

868
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:40,110
I got it... I didn't get it.

869
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:41,938
I'll, I'll give it a shot.

870
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,202
- Really?
- Yeah.

871
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:55,474
Okay. So you're good at this.

872
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,713
I guess those years of little
league were good for something.

873
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:59,217
Hmm.

874
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:00,827
Oh, for the lady.

875
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,524
Thank you.

876
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:04,961
Actually, this is for you.

877
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,963
Oh.

878
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:11,316
It's just to remember that you
do have everything you need

879
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,492
right inside you there.

880
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,017
And also to remember
that very first year

881
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:19,367
that you ever planned
a Christmas party.

882
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:23,066
I don't think I'll be forgetting
this anytime soon.

883
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:25,503
Because I won.

884
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:28,289
Right. Time for crafting.

885
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,291
Crafting.

886
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,337
Come on.

887
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:33,729
Okay...

888
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,211
Follow me.

889
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,614
There sure is a lot
going on here.

890
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:51,617
Ooh, pom-poms.

891
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,532
Pom-poms, really?

892
00:37:54,663 --> 00:37:56,535
What's wrong with pom-poms?

893
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,493
They're just kind of boring.

894
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:01,801
Boring? Pom-poms?

895
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:02,976
Pom-poms are the best.

896
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,412
Take it back.

897
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,283
No.

898
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,460
What?

899
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:10,853
Pom-poms, no?

900
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:12,159
- No, don't like them?
- Hey!

901
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,165
She started it.

902
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,819
I didn't.

903
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,299
Yes, you did.
You totally did.

904
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:22,909
Are you throwing me
under the bus?

905
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,127
Yes.

906
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,260
Sorry, we'll clean it up.

907
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:29,307
Wow.

908
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,353
I know we're on
a tight schedule,

909
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:38,098
but I would love to show you
my plans for the pitch.

910
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:42,407
They're not perfect and I
haven't shown anyone yet, but...

911
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:44,104
I'd be honored.

912
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:54,244
What do you think?
I think this will work.

913
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:58,553
Oh, you're just, oh wow.

914
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:02,122
See, I actually made mine
look terrible on purpose

915
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:05,821
so yours would look really good.

916
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:07,435
Is that how you charm
all the ladies?

917
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:10,260
It works every time.

918
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:12,262
Oh, so you are a ladies man?

919
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:16,484
Just kidding. I actually got out
of a relationship a while ago.

920
00:39:16,658 --> 00:39:18,617
So I've just been
focusing on work.

921
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:23,361
How about you?

922
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:25,145
Same.

923
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,887
Yeah I, after my
last relationship,

924
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:34,415
I just decided that I wanted
to just focus on my career.

925
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:38,245
None of those pesky feelings
getting in the way, right?

926
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,900
Exactly.

927
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:46,209
Since we're being transparent,
I let you win at broom ball.

928
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,646
Sure you did.

929
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,909
Whatever you have
to tell yourself.

930
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:51,301
Did it work?

931
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:52,868
Are you charmed?

932
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:55,567
Oh, I'm the most charmed.

933
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,482
That's what I thought.

934
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:58,874
Oh, oh we're going.

935
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:01,181
Come on you charmer.

936
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:07,927
My car's just around the corner.

937
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:09,711
I can give you a ride home.

938
00:40:09,885 --> 00:40:12,081
Oh, I'm actually not going home.
I'm going to my parents.

939
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:13,367
But it's not far.

940
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,848
Oh no, it's getting dark.
I insist.

941
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:17,110
Come on.

942
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:18,459
Okay.

943
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:31,211
Okay, so tomorrow we have
to order a garland,

944
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,256
get that North Pole
playlist together

945
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,694
and confirm the numbers
for the caterer.

946
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:38,217
- Oh.
- Oh.

947
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,875
- Hi Holly.
- Hi Mom.

948
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:45,965
Uh, this is my client,
Theo Pine.

949
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:47,270
Theo, this is my mom, Lydia.

950
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,185
- Hey.
- Lovely to meet you.

951
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,058
This is perfect because
you can take Felix's place.

952
00:40:52,232 --> 00:40:53,538
He's stuck at work.

953
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:54,712
Place for what?

954
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,671
Gingerbread night.

955
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:58,107
Oh...

956
00:40:58,281 --> 00:40:59,848
Oh Mom, I'm sure
that Theo has work.

957
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,155
I would love to, Miss Green.

958
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:05,506
But as long as my boss
says it's okay.

959
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,901
Okay, it's settled.
I'll see you guys inside.

960
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:11,599
Yeah, my mom takes gingerbread
night very seriously,

961
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:12,948
just so you're prepared.

962
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:14,733
Well, of course she does,

963
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:16,907
because gingerbread night
is very serious business.

964
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:29,095
That looks nice.

965
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,577
So, you've met mom, Lydia.

966
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:35,449
This is my dad, Sam,
and my sister, Joy.

967
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,451
- Mr. Green, nice to meet you.
- You too.

968
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,168
- Nice to meet you, Joy.
- Nice to meet you.

969
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:41,629
The pleasure's all ours,
and don't mind the mess.

970
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,631
Yeah. We're in the middle
of remodeling.

971
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:45,938
It's a five-year remodel.

972
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:47,461
Oh.

973
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:49,550
Yeah. It's best not
to ask questions.

974
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:53,032
Dad fancies himself
a DIY home remodeler.

975
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:54,250
I don't fancy.

976
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:55,904
- I am.
- I am.

977
00:41:56,078 --> 00:41:58,516
Well, if this is your work,
I'm a fan.

978
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,343
Don't listen to them.

979
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:08,090
Is something wrong?

980
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:11,964
Oh no, I'm just making...

981
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:14,967
A bit of a perfectionist, maybe?

982
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:19,972
Getting started
is the hardest part.

983
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,321
What's going on there?

984
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:23,149
I'm adding some dimension.

985
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:27,283
Dad uh, lives for a little bit
of character.

986
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:28,457
If you hadn't noticed.

987
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,242
Ah.

988
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,549
Okay. Here.

989
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:34,856
Voila.

990
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,292
Oh!

991
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,033
That is very cool, Dad.

992
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,949
Yeah. Not bad
for a book editor.

993
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:42,342
Dad works in publishing.

994
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:44,257
Yeah.

995
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:46,999
Publishing pays the bills, but
home renovation fills the soul.

996
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:49,001
I hope I'm not overstepping,

997
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:51,615
but I'd be happy to help with
any projects you have Mr. Green.

998
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:54,006
Growing up on sites, I dare say
I'm a grout master.

999
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:56,574
I like this guy.

1000
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:58,228
All right, well if
you're coming over,

1001
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:01,013
don't forget to bring
your grout goggles.

1002
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:03,450
What are... grout goggles?

1003
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:05,147
It's best not to ask.

1004
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:06,995
Theo, Holly tells me that
you're about to take over

1005
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,498
your family's business.

1006
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:11,371
Yep. Uh, we have an architecture
firm downtown,

1007
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:13,425
but I promise I'm better
at building real houses

1008
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:14,853
than gingerbread ones.

1009
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:20,989
Hey Dad, can you flash
that light one more time?

1010
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:23,426
Yeah. Happy to.

1011
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:30,259
Oh, that would be so cool

1012
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:32,542
if you could do something
like that in the city center.

1013
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:35,003
You know, like a,
like a skylight?

1014
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:38,616
I don't know,
something like that?

1015
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,967
Just for that focal point
that you were hoping for.

1016
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:43,708
It's just an idea.

1017
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:06,948
So, thanks again for offering
to help my dad.

1018
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:09,908
Seriously, it was
all my pleasure.

1019
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:11,866
I'm actually really excited.

1020
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
Good.

1021
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:17,959
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

1022
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:19,613
See you tomorrow.

1023
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,843
Well.

1024
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:34,019
Isn't he a doll?

1025
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:36,238
Yeah. He really is.

1026
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,111
Hey Joy, would you come with me?

1027
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:40,939
I've got this video I want
to show you.

1028
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:44,856
It's about how to install
a hot water heater at home.

1029
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,945
No, Dad, no! Dad...

1030
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,990
No, it's just...

1031
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:51,645
No, come with, bear with me.
It's good to know these things.

1032
00:44:56,128 --> 00:44:57,912
Someone's in a good mood.

1033
00:44:58,086 --> 00:45:00,006
Because it's the most
wonderful time of the year.

1034
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:00,959
What's this?

1035
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:02,482
Inspiration!

1036
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:44,567
Oh, Holly...

1037
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,831
Peppermint mocha?

1038
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:48,006
Thank you.

1039
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,007
Here, let me grab your coat.

1040
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:50,181
Oh.

1041
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,839
- Oh my hair.
- Oh, sorry.

1042
00:45:55,013 --> 00:45:56,188
No worries.

1043
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,950
Do you want to have a seat?
I saved you one.

1044
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:01,193
Oh.

1045
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,066
Am I being buttered up?

1046
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,676
Possibly.

1047
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:10,028
Okay, I was thinking about
what you were saying last night.

1048
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,943
Which was?

1049
00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:13,553
About the skylight.

1050
00:46:13,727 --> 00:46:15,096
I think you were really
onto something.

1051
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,164
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1052
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:17,905
Pitch it to me.

1053
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,910
Well, uh, it's not like
fully flushed out yet.

1054
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:24,869
Okay, maybe this was a bad idea.

1055
00:46:25,043 --> 00:46:26,455
Come on, it doesn't have
to be perfect.

1056
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:27,959
Just tell me what
you're mulling over.

1057
00:46:30,048 --> 00:46:31,832
So, based on
inspiration from you,

1058
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:35,009
I was thinking a raised skylight

1059
00:46:35,183 --> 00:46:36,924
with a silhouette
of the Rocky Mountains

1060
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:40,275
and then paying homage
to the Colorado landscape.

1061
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:43,757
That's awesome, like
you're really onto something.

1062
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:46,934
But?

1063
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:51,069
But ooh, ah, what if instead
of a skylight, it's a sun dial,

1064
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:53,395
and then it illuminates
different parts of the mountains

1065
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:55,987
at different times?

1066
00:46:56,161 --> 00:47:01,470
That's actually so original and
very unique and totally Denver.

1067
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:02,644
Yeah.

1068
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:04,125
That's, that's great.

1069
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:08,303
Thanks.

1070
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:11,872
Uh, what else is
on the list today?

1071
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:15,267
Uh, I have to make a
North Pole playlist.

1072
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:17,617
Oh. Cool.

1073
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:19,793
And you have to make a model.

1074
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:21,795
How about we make a deal?

1075
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:24,250
I'll help you with the model
if you help me with the list.

1076
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,192
Deal.

1077
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:28,584
Should we get started?

1078
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:30,282
No, not here.

1079
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:31,500
What? Why not?

1080
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:33,067
Because we're being creative.

1081
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:34,460
Oh.

1082
00:47:34,634 --> 00:47:36,157
And this is not
a creative space.

1083
00:47:36,331 --> 00:47:37,985
Follow me.

1084
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,955
What is this place?

1085
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:53,348
This is my family's
creative space.

1086
00:47:53,522 --> 00:47:55,873
This is where my dad keeps
all of his like, DIY stuff,

1087
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:57,570
my mom's crafting.

1088
00:47:57,744 --> 00:47:59,964
So all these Christmas
decorations are yours?

1089
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:02,575
Oh, no, no, no. This is just
my back stock.

1090
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:05,099
I keep my favorite ones at
my apartment for easy access.

1091
00:48:05,273 --> 00:48:08,015
How do you not run your own
party planning business yet?

1092
00:48:08,189 --> 00:48:10,104
I mean, you have everything
you need right here.

1093
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:12,237
Yes. I definitely have
plenty of supplies.

1094
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:14,021
So, let's get started.

1095
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:18,504
Oh, like I said,

1096
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:19,960
I've actually never done this
on my own before.

1097
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:21,184
I have no idea how to use that.

1098
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,856
Oh, I haven't either.

1099
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,350
So we're on an even
playing field.

1100
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:25,946
Mmm-hmm.

1101
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,122
Shall we get started?

1102
00:48:28,296 --> 00:48:29,123
We shall.

1103
00:48:29,297 --> 00:48:30,733
Come have a seat.

1104
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:34,041
Good King Wenceslas looked out

1105
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:35,913
On the Feast of Stephen

1106
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:38,045
When the snow lay round about

1107
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:40,918
Deep and crisp and even

1108
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:44,008
Brightly shone
the moon that night

1109
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:46,445
Though the frost was cruel

1110
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:49,187
When a poor man came in sight

1111
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:52,886
Gathering winter fuel

1112
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:00,153
Take it out

1113
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,288
Hither, page,

1114
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:04,898
and stand by me

1115
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:07,292
If thou know it, telling

1116
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:10,208
Yonder peasant, who is he?

1117
00:49:10,382 --> 00:49:13,037
Where and what his dwelling?

1118
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:15,996
Sire, he lives a good
league hence

1119
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,912
Underneath the mountain

1120
00:49:19,086 --> 00:49:20,870
Right against the forest fence

1121
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:22,872
This playlist is looking good.

1122
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,048
It is.

1123
00:49:24,222 --> 00:49:26,441
I definitely want this song.

1124
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:34,754
What do you think?

1125
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,365
Only if you use that
as your grand entrance.

1126
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:38,540
Done.

1127
00:49:39,324 --> 00:49:41,152
Okay, how many more songs
do we need?

1128
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:43,981
Uh, actually,
just the final one.

1129
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:45,155
Okay.

1130
00:49:45,243 --> 00:49:47,158
Oh, how about this one?

1131
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:49,943
May I?

1132
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:51,292
Thank you.

1133
00:49:55,122 --> 00:49:56,819
How about this one?

1134
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,154
Yeah, I just think that one's
like a little too like...

1135
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:01,215
Yeah, you're right.

1136
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:02,509
It should be more wind down.

1137
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:04,871
Okay, uh...

1138
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:07,482
I love this song.

1139
00:50:07,656 --> 00:50:09,963
Oh, that's my favorite.

1140
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:16,361
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

1141
00:50:25,413 --> 00:50:26,893
Wow.

1142
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:29,504
No way. You know how to waltz?

1143
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:31,998
Well actually, technically
what you're doing isn't a waltz.

1144
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,901
A waltz is in 3/4.

1145
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:38,992
That's more like a foxtrot
or a rumba, which is in 4/4.

1146
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:43,083
Theo Pine, are you
a ballroom dancer?

1147
00:50:43,257 --> 00:50:45,477
I might have taken a class
or two in college.

1148
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:47,870
Ready?

1149
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,176
Okay.

1150
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:54,268
- Ah!
- You got it.

1151
00:50:54,442 --> 00:50:55,442
Okay...

1152
00:50:56,662 --> 00:50:57,662
Okay, ready?

1153
00:50:57,706 --> 00:50:59,012
Okay, now out.

1154
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:00,274
Okay.

1155
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:02,146
Nice.

1156
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,321
Mmm-hmm.

1157
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:05,497
- Oh wow.
- Ready for this?

1158
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:07,368
Oh. Well.

1159
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:11,111
And that's how you waltz.

1160
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:12,285
Wow.

1161
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:16,116
And I think that song
is perfect.

1162
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,294
That's a beautiful way
to end an evening.

1163
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:21,513
It is.

1164
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,342
Uh, I'm going to get it.

1165
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:29,303
Oh.

1166
00:51:29,477 --> 00:51:31,412
The Christmas decorations and
tree will be ready by tomorrow.

1167
00:51:31,436 --> 00:51:32,436
Nice.

1168
00:51:32,524 --> 00:51:33,568
Yeah.

1169
00:51:35,527 --> 00:51:38,399
My dad is so excited about
you helping him lay that tile.

1170
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:40,358
He can't stop talking about it.

1171
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:42,838
Well, your dad is a great guy.
I would be happy to do it.

1172
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:45,189
Yeah, he is, he is.

1173
00:51:45,363 --> 00:51:46,451
Uh.

1174
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:49,367
He can also be a
little spirited,

1175
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:51,282
so we should probably
have a code word

1176
00:51:51,456 --> 00:51:53,371
in case that gets
to be too much.

1177
00:51:53,545 --> 00:51:54,981
Oh.

1178
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,026
Something like,
"Where is Santa's hat?"

1179
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,724
No, that's terrible.

1180
00:51:58,898 --> 00:52:00,943
How about like, "Who ate
the last sugar cookie?"

1181
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:04,314
- That's, that's worse.
- That's worse, yeah.

1182
00:52:04,338 --> 00:52:05,557
Rudolph.

1183
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:07,167
Just Rudolph?

1184
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:09,014
Just keep it simple,
just say it like loudly.

1185
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:11,084
Commit to Rudolph.

1186
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:14,043
- Rudolph it is.
- Rudolph it is.

1187
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:16,394
Oh.

1188
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:21,442
Oh, shoot that's Blaire.

1189
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:24,619
I should get back and
fill her in on the new design.

1190
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:27,729
Is there anything else
you need from me?

1191
00:52:27,753 --> 00:52:30,190
No, you're all good.

1192
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:31,191
Okay. I'll just...

1193
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:32,366
Yeah.

1194
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,062
I'll just get this for you.

1195
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,237
Oh.

1196
00:52:38,372 --> 00:52:39,504
You got it.

1197
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:43,464
Okay.

1198
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:47,642
See you tomorrow.

1199
00:52:47,816 --> 00:52:49,514
Yeah, first thing.

1200
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:56,434
Well...

1201
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,178
Is it bad?

1202
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,310
No!

1203
00:53:04,398 --> 00:53:06,444
Theo, it's stunning.

1204
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:08,402
The mayor's going to love this.

1205
00:53:10,317 --> 00:53:11,317
Okay, yeah.
Lay it on me.

1206
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:12,569
I know you've got something.

1207
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:13,625
Just one suggestion:

1208
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:15,279
he loves Christmas so much.

1209
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:18,325
Maybe you could add some
Christmas decorations?

1210
00:53:18,499 --> 00:53:19,979
Holly, that is genius.

1211
00:53:20,153 --> 00:53:22,590
You're just such an amazing...

1212
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:23,764
Decorator.

1213
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:24,592
Hey Theo. Oh, Miss Green.

1214
00:53:24,766 --> 00:53:26,464
- Hi.
- Hi.

1215
00:53:26,638 --> 00:53:29,945
Holly was just saying that
we should add some festive

1216
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,383
decorations to the model
to make it more Christmassy.

1217
00:53:32,557 --> 00:53:34,994
A unique and personal touch.
I like it.

1218
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:36,865
Great.

1219
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:39,039
Well, the Christmas tree should
be here any minute.

1220
00:53:39,085 --> 00:53:41,305
Theo, want to come
get it with me?

1221
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:42,567
Yeah.

1222
00:53:59,366 --> 00:54:01,542
Man.

1223
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:05,938
Why don't you let the tall guy
do it?

1224
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:08,506
No. I got it. Yeah.

1225
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,899
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1226
00:54:11,073 --> 00:54:12,529
I don't think you can
even reach the top.

1227
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:13,553
Hey!

1228
00:54:13,598 --> 00:54:15,164
Am I wrong?

1229
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:16,427
No.

1230
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:19,865
Here?

1231
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,521
I am only relenting because
of decorating efficiency.

1232
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:25,523
That is perfect, thank you.

1233
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:30,615
So.

1234
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:33,531
I hear someone crushed
their first model.

1235
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:36,185
Well it's not perfect, but...

1236
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,187
Nothing is perfect.

1237
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:41,060
But you came pretty close.

1238
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:44,411
Thank you.

1239
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:46,848
So I guess that's all
the decorating tonight?

1240
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:47,545
No.

1241
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:48,981
Hmm.

1242
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:53,028
We still have all
of the ornaments.

1243
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:56,031
Oh wow, so we're going
to be here all night.

1244
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:57,337
It's a lot, yeah.

1245
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,035
I like that one though.

1246
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:02,908
There are worse ways
to spend an evening.

1247
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:03,909
That's very true.

1248
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,345
Yeah.

1249
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:09,567
Wow. Now that is
a Christmas tree.

1250
00:55:09,741 --> 00:55:12,265
What are you two doing here?

1251
00:55:12,439 --> 00:55:14,528
My computer needed a reboot.

1252
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:16,313
Yeah. It's a good thing
I'm so techie.

1253
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:17,531
Hah.

1254
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:21,056
You want some help?

1255
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:23,058
Ooh, ornaments.

1256
00:56:00,052 --> 00:56:03,011
Do you see what I see?
Should we set them up?

1257
00:56:03,185 --> 00:56:04,815
Well if we did, we'd have
to do it in secret.

1258
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:06,469
Ooh, we could like trap them
in an elevator.

1259
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:08,277
Oh, or lock them in an office.

1260
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:10,299
Or what if they like met at
a coffee shop and then like,

1261
00:56:10,323 --> 00:56:11,963
reached for the same bag
at the same time?

1262
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:16,851
We can, we can circle
back to that.

1263
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:18,025
Yeah.

1264
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,114
You're big on Christmas?

1265
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:20,377
Uh, massive.

1266
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:23,162
Uh, what about you Holls?

1267
00:56:23,336 --> 00:56:25,817
What's your favorite
Christmas tradition?

1268
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:27,601
Ooh.

1269
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:29,695
My family does the cutest thing
on Christmas Eve.

1270
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:33,390
We do like, breakfast for dinner
and my mom cooks everything.

1271
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:35,914
Eggs Benedict and bacon,
like anything you want.

1272
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:37,437
- Delicious.
- Yeah.

1273
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:39,352
My family does like
the same thing.

1274
00:56:39,526 --> 00:56:41,833
Except we have this big roast,
and then mashed potatoes,

1275
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:45,227
green beans, and then always
my mom's famous

1276
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,881
lemon ginger icebox cake.

1277
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:49,406
- Oh, so good.
- So good.

1278
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,886
Uh, favorite Christmas movie?
Mine's The Grinch.

1279
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,845
What? That's my
favorite movie.

1280
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:55,281
- Really?
- Yeah.

1281
00:56:55,455 --> 00:56:56,456
What about you, Theo?

1282
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:57,979
Oh, Miracle on 34th Street.

1283
00:56:58,153 --> 00:56:59,328
Ultimate classic.

1284
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:00,808
Totally.

1285
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:02,984
Uh, Christmas presents
on Christmas Eve

1286
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:04,377
or Christmas morning?

1287
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:06,292
- Christmas Eve.
- Christmas Eve.

1288
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:07,728
Wow.

1289
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:09,382
- Yeah, okay.
- Maybe we should...

1290
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:11,297
- It's getting... late.
- It's kind of late.

1291
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,168
We should check on
the computer program.

1292
00:57:13,342 --> 00:57:14,387
Rebooting of course.

1293
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:15,954
Yeah. It's probably rebooted.

1294
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:17,627
For sure. Yeah.
You guys are doing great.

1295
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:18,913
Um, looks fantastic. Festive.

1296
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:20,087
Blaire: Okay.

1297
00:57:20,175 --> 00:57:21,655
Nick: See you guys.

1298
00:57:24,571 --> 00:57:26,921
They totally have a crush
on each other.

1299
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:28,706
That is it,

1300
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,535
or he's just very excited
for his New Year's bonus.

1301
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,320
Okay, what's next on the list?

1302
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:37,236
Well, I just have a few things
left in my office,

1303
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,543
so tomorrow you're all free.

1304
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:42,981
So I won't see you tomorrow?

1305
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:44,722
No.

1306
00:57:44,896 --> 00:57:47,855
But Saturday I would love help
with the load-in.

1307
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:49,944
I'd love to see you Saturday.

1308
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:51,380
I'd be happy to help.

1309
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:52,817
Okay.

1310
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,082
It's just...

1311
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,479
I know it's lame, but I thought
we could do it together

1312
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:05,438
because I'm really bad
at decorations.

1313
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:06,831
So I kind of need your help.

1314
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:08,659
I don't know where to put it.

1315
00:58:10,443 --> 00:58:13,315
Is this a good spot?
What do you think?

1316
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,100
I think that looks great.

1317
00:58:20,409 --> 00:58:22,237
I have to get my coat.

1318
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:23,630
Your coat?

1319
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,111
Here.

1320
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:27,634
- Oh, thanks.
- Okay.

1321
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,419
Holly...

1322
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:31,769
Oh!

1323
00:58:33,727 --> 00:58:34,859
See you Saturday.

1324
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:36,033
Goodnight.

1325
00:58:36,121 --> 00:58:37,470
Okay, bye.

1326
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:41,343
I think she likes you.

1327
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:48,002
And let's add in
the wagyu beef sliders.

1328
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:49,613
Those are always a hit.

1329
00:58:49,787 --> 00:58:51,832
Great, thank you Carl.
You're the best.

1330
00:58:52,006 --> 00:58:53,442
Bye.

1331
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:55,227
Carl?

1332
00:58:55,401 --> 00:58:57,272
Of Taste Catering Carl?

1333
00:58:57,446 --> 00:58:58,752
Mmm-hmm.

1334
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:00,667
You got him for the PA event?
How?

1335
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:03,080
All the other planners say
that he's booked until February.

1336
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:04,628
Yeah, he's an old friend.

1337
00:59:04,802 --> 00:59:07,848
Oh. I gotta say, I am very,
very impressed.

1338
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:09,023
Huge favor to ask.

1339
00:59:09,197 --> 00:59:10,547
I need a day-of coordinator

1340
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:12,853
for the charity event
downtown tonight.

1341
00:59:13,027 --> 00:59:14,701
Might be good, you know,
get in one more event.

1342
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:16,988
Let the board know
that you're really ready.

1343
00:59:17,162 --> 00:59:18,772
If you have the bandwidth.

1344
00:59:18,946 --> 00:59:20,992
Yes, of course I do.
I'll squeeze that right in.

1345
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:22,863
Love it.
You are a lifesaver.

1346
00:59:23,037 --> 00:59:25,474
I'm going to email you
the deets right now.

1347
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:26,998
Carl.

1348
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:28,695
Impressed.

1349
00:59:32,003 --> 00:59:33,831
Look at that.

1350
00:59:34,005 --> 00:59:36,007
She looks just like you, Joy.

1351
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:37,724
We don't even know if
it's a girl yet, Dad.

1352
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:39,576
Oh yes we do.
She's a girl.

1353
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,186
Trust me. I know
these things.

1354
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,960
Well, for the record
I hope you're right.

1355
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:44,014
I am.

1356
00:59:44,058 --> 00:59:45,930
Hey guys, sorry I'm late.

1357
00:59:46,104 --> 00:59:48,367
Hi.

1358
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:49,673
How was it?

1359
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:51,413
Kind of weird, but really cool.

1360
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,024
It was amazing.

1361
00:59:53,198 --> 00:59:55,330
Oh, my gosh you guys.

1362
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:56,767
Look at that.

1363
00:59:56,941 --> 00:59:58,595
She looks just like Joy,
doesn't she?

1364
00:59:58,769 --> 00:59:59,552
Oh, that's nice.

1365
00:59:59,726 --> 01:00:00,858
Yeah.

1366
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:03,469
Oh, sorry.

1367
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:05,776
Hey.

1368
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,516
Hey, can I swing by the office?

1369
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,494
I really want to practice
the pitch one more time

1370
01:00:09,518 --> 01:00:10,868
before this afternoon.

1371
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:12,391
It'll be quick, I promise.

1372
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:14,005
Ooh, I'm not at the office
right now.

1373
01:00:14,132 --> 01:00:15,152
I'm actually at
my family's house.

1374
01:00:15,176 --> 01:00:16,395
Oh.

1375
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:17,918
Uh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't...

1376
01:00:18,092 --> 01:00:20,007
Hi Theo.

1377
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:22,029
Listen, why don't you come on
down and pitch it to all of us?

1378
01:00:22,053 --> 01:00:23,315
What was that?

1379
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:24,729
Doing it in front of an audience

1380
01:00:24,795 --> 01:00:26,115
will help you get
your nerves out.

1381
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:27,449
That's true.

1382
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,016
Well I wouldn't want to impose.

1383
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:31,062
No, no imposition.
Just come on down.

1384
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:32,324
Impose man, impose.

1385
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:33,978
We've got nothing but time.

1386
01:00:34,152 --> 01:00:35,152
Are you sure?

1387
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:36,196
Positive.

1388
01:00:36,284 --> 01:00:37,895
The people have spoken.

1389
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:40,506
Okay, uh, I'll be there in 10.

1390
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,725
Okay.

1391
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:46,468
What?

1392
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,992
Are you going to tell him?

1393
01:00:49,123 --> 01:00:50,342
Tell him what?

1394
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:51,691
That you have a crush on him?

1395
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:54,128
I do not have a crush on him.

1396
01:00:54,302 --> 01:00:55,913
Yeah, okay, yeah.

1397
01:00:57,088 --> 01:00:58,089
I don't!

1398
01:00:58,263 --> 01:00:59,090
Yeah no, we all believe you.

1399
01:00:59,264 --> 01:01:00,264
Dad! Don't look at me...

1400
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:05,444
There we go. Put that
right there.

1401
01:01:05,618 --> 01:01:06,880
Yeah.

1402
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:09,100
So, whenever you're ready, Theo.

1403
01:01:09,274 --> 01:01:13,582
Okay, um, well, as many of
you know,

1404
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,628
Pine Architecture has been...

1405
01:01:23,636 --> 01:01:26,595
And in closing, the focal
point of the main building

1406
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,903
will feature a skylight
that also acts as a sundial

1407
01:01:30,077 --> 01:01:31,862
to pay homage to
the Colorado landscape.

1408
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:33,907
Theo, that's fantastic.

1409
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:39,391
You crushed it.

1410
01:01:39,565 --> 01:01:40,131
So good.

1411
01:01:40,305 --> 01:01:41,872
Theo!

1412
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:43,351
Thanks guys.

1413
01:01:43,525 --> 01:01:46,398
I completely agree.
You're ready.

1414
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:47,965
Stay for some hot cocoa?

1415
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:50,445
I would love to,
but I have to go.

1416
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:51,620
Okay.

1417
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:52,915
Right, well, next time then.

1418
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,013
Oh, yes sir.
Next time.

1419
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:55,058
We will hold you to that.

1420
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:56,147
Deal.

1421
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,149
Theo.

1422
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,806
That was so great.

1423
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,982
You don't think it's too simple?

1424
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:09,029
I think sometimes simple
is perfect.

1425
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:10,988
How about you?

1426
01:02:11,162 --> 01:02:12,816
About the promotion, I mean.

1427
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:14,556
Oh, uh yeah.

1428
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,038
Eve has me filling in for
an event tonight, so...

1429
01:02:18,212 --> 01:02:19,474
Oh, another one?

1430
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:21,302
Yeah.

1431
01:02:21,476 --> 01:02:23,914
She thought it would be good
for the board to see.

1432
01:02:24,088 --> 01:02:26,003
I don't want to speak
out of line,

1433
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:30,529
but is it possible that they're
just stringing you along?

1434
01:02:30,703 --> 01:02:32,052
I mean, I've known you
for a week

1435
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:35,012
and you should be running
that company.

1436
01:02:35,186 --> 01:02:38,145
I mean, you're so talented
and driven.

1437
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:41,888
I guess what I'm trying to say
is you deserve answers,

1438
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:45,239
and you deserve that promotion.

1439
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:48,025
Just something to check out.

1440
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,635
Okay.

1441
01:02:51,202 --> 01:02:53,291
But I should go.

1442
01:02:53,465 --> 01:02:56,947
Please tell your family they're
really great and thanks again.

1443
01:02:57,121 --> 01:02:59,558
Yeah. They are great.

1444
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:01,995
Well.

1445
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:04,171
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1446
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:05,345
Guess I need this.

1447
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,826
Yeah, get that. Yeah.

1448
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,741
- Okay.
- All right.

1449
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:12,266
Text me when you're done.

1450
01:03:15,182 --> 01:03:16,769
I think we're going to have
to bump that up

1451
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,553
because I don't want to miss
the deadline, so.

1452
01:03:18,577 --> 01:03:19,728
I can definitely get the
electrical plans done by then.

1453
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:20,884
- Okay, great.
- Ooh!

1454
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:22,886
- Woah!
- Here it is.

1455
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,192
Man, that looks amazing.

1456
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:26,890
That is beautiful.

1457
01:03:27,064 --> 01:03:28,456
It looks awesome man.

1458
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,502
Ooh, you know what else
looks awesome?

1459
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:31,676
Is it time?

1460
01:03:31,764 --> 01:03:32,591
I think it is.

1461
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:34,071
Wait, time for what?

1462
01:03:34,245 --> 01:03:35,855
- Are you ready for this?
- Are you?

1463
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:37,161
- Am I ready?
- Let's do it.

1464
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:52,567
Wooo!

1465
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:53,742
Oh, yeah!

1466
01:03:57,224 --> 01:03:59,923
Oh no.
Oh no!

1467
01:04:00,097 --> 01:04:02,099
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no!

1468
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:04,188
I am so sorry.

1469
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:06,233
No, no, no.
It's not your fault.

1470
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:08,801
It's my fault,
I should've been more careful.

1471
01:04:08,975 --> 01:04:09,802
Uh...

1472
01:04:09,976 --> 01:04:10,803
The pitch is in an hour.

1473
01:04:10,977 --> 01:04:11,586
What are we going to do?

1474
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,066
It's okay.

1475
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,068
I will figure something out,
okay?

1476
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:18,855
We're just going to go
with plan B.

1477
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:20,595
I'm going to present
the blueprints,

1478
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:23,163
and Blaire, can you make
a digital copy of the model

1479
01:04:23,337 --> 01:04:25,165
to give to the mayor
when it's ready?

1480
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:27,951
Yeah, but I definitely can't
do that within the next hour.

1481
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:29,953
That's totally fine.

1482
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:33,870
Um, I will let him know we ran
into a little bit of a snafu

1483
01:04:34,044 --> 01:04:35,456
and we'll get him something
before the new year.

1484
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,047
Is that enough time?

1485
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:39,005
Absolutely, yeah.
I'll, I'll get on it.

1486
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,138
- I'll help you out.
- Thank you.

1487
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:49,165
And thank you everyone
for coming in today

1488
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:50,887
and listening to the pitch.

1489
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:54,847
And is there a model
of your design?

1490
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:56,196
Uh no, not at the moment.

1491
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,894
We ran into a little hiccup,

1492
01:04:58,068 --> 01:04:59,983
but my digital team will get
a copy to yours

1493
01:05:00,157 --> 01:05:02,028
before the new year.

1494
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:03,682
Okay, um...

1495
01:05:05,336 --> 01:05:07,164
Well, thank you for your time,
Theo.

1496
01:05:07,338 --> 01:05:08,992
You as well, sir.

1497
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:26,095
Hey.

1498
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:27,880
How'd it go?

1499
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:30,274
Honestly, I feel pretty good
about what we gave him.

1500
01:05:30,448 --> 01:05:32,102
And please thank
your family again

1501
01:05:32,276 --> 01:05:34,147
for letting me practice
on them today.

1502
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:36,062
Are you kidding?
They loved it.

1503
01:05:36,236 --> 01:05:37,996
Did you explain what happened
with the model?

1504
01:05:38,151 --> 01:05:39,936
Well, I didn't want to make
any excuses

1505
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:43,200
so I just told him that we'd get
him a digital copy stat.

1506
01:05:43,374 --> 01:05:45,028
And he was okay with that?

1507
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:46,899
We'll see.

1508
01:05:47,073 --> 01:05:49,423
Okay. Well I'm just finishing
setting up for the party.

1509
01:05:49,597 --> 01:05:52,905
So I will see you first thing
in the morning for load in.

1510
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:55,995
If anything else happens
just let me know, okay?

1511
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:56,996
I will.

1512
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:58,432
Okay, bye.

1513
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:01,000
Holly.

1514
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:03,916
Oh, Mayor Donahue.
What are you doing here?

1515
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:06,450
I'm on the board and drew the
straw that oversees the setup.

1516
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:10,444
And you have done a beautiful,
beautiful job.

1517
01:06:10,618 --> 01:06:12,142
Thank you.

1518
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:15,014
Listen, I have a question
for you.

1519
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:16,755
What's it like working
with Theo?

1520
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:18,602
I know his father Richard
well and trust him deeply,

1521
01:06:18,626 --> 01:06:21,934
but Theo's a bit of a wildcard.

1522
01:06:23,762 --> 01:06:26,852
Yeah. It's just because he's got
so many ideas.

1523
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:28,419
But his heart's
in the right space.

1524
01:06:28,593 --> 01:06:30,092
So you'd trust him
with something as big

1525
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:31,988
as this contract?

1526
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:33,467
If you were to ask me
a week ago,

1527
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:35,252
I would have said no.

1528
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,340
Oh.

1529
01:06:37,384 --> 01:06:38,951
Because you know Theo.

1530
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:41,954
No. It's, he's just, he's laser
focused you know?

1531
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:45,479
He's very specific once he gets
an idea in his head

1532
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:48,265
he's just like ooh, you can't
get that thing out of there.

1533
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:57,970
But he's passionate
and kind and smart.

1534
01:06:58,144 --> 01:07:00,103
And yes, he's young
and he's eager,

1535
01:07:00,277 --> 01:07:04,281
but he's got great vision.

1536
01:07:04,455 --> 01:07:07,153
So what I'm trying to say
is yes,

1537
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:11,114
I think that he would be great
for the city center contract.

1538
01:07:11,288 --> 01:07:13,072
Okay, good.

1539
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:15,074
Well thank you for your time,
Miss Green.

1540
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:16,902
I'll let you get back to work.

1541
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:17,859
Okay. Enjoy.

1542
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,252
Thanks.

1543
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:27,869
Hey kiddo.

1544
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,324
I just wanted to
congratulate you

1545
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,830
on another gorgeous event
last night.

1546
01:07:32,004 --> 01:07:33,962
- Thank you!
- Great job.

1547
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:34,963
Oh, Eve?

1548
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:36,139
Yes.

1549
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:38,141
I uh, I was just wondering.

1550
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:40,926
Have you heard anything from
the board about my promotion?

1551
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:46,018
Yeah. I, I did not want you
to hear about this today.

1552
01:07:46,192 --> 01:07:47,933
You have gone above
and beyond this season,

1553
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:49,978
and you know your work
is fantastic.

1554
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:51,980
But?

1555
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:55,984
But, I, I heard this morning
that the board is going to go

1556
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:57,159
with another candidate.

1557
01:07:57,247 --> 01:07:58,509
Really?

1558
01:07:58,683 --> 01:07:59,834
It's somebody who's been
here longer,

1559
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:01,512
just a little bit more seasoned.

1560
01:08:01,686 --> 01:08:02,991
I'm really sorry, Holly.

1561
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,428
But you know what?

1562
01:08:04,602 --> 01:08:06,256
We're going to try again
next year, okay?

1563
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,257
Yeah. Okay.

1564
01:08:07,431 --> 01:08:08,431
Okay...

1565
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:11,783
You know what? No.

1566
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:15,221
I don't want to wait
another year.

1567
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:17,005
I deserve to be running
my own team.

1568
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,007
Yes, you do.

1569
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:21,097
We just, we can't give that
to you right now.

1570
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:24,012
Okay.

1571
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:30,671
Well then, I'm sorry,
but I can't do this anymore.

1572
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,501
I'm going to have to quit.

1573
01:08:34,675 --> 01:08:36,895
Okay.

1574
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:42,553
But you need to know, you are
a huge asset to Encore,

1575
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:46,078
and I really wish that I could
give you what you deserve.

1576
01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:50,387
As much as I don't want
to see you leave,

1577
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:52,389
you're going to do great
wherever you go.

1578
01:08:52,563 --> 01:08:54,347
I mean that.

1579
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:56,088
Thank you.

1580
01:08:57,089 --> 01:08:59,874
I will follow through with
the Pine Architecture party

1581
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:02,094
because there's a lot riding
on that.

1582
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:05,489
But after that, I'm going
to have to be done.

1583
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,143
I understand.

1584
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:12,235
Holly?

1585
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:15,934
I am so proud of you.

1586
01:09:16,108 --> 01:09:19,546
You are a fantastic
party planner.

1587
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,071
You know what? Thank you
for everything, Eve.

1588
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:25,161
Thank you.

1589
01:09:28,033 --> 01:09:30,122
Okay. I don't understand.

1590
01:09:30,296 --> 01:09:32,448
Receptionist: I'm sorry sir, all
I know is that the mayor's going

1591
01:09:32,472 --> 01:09:34,082
in a different direction
at this time.

1592
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:37,477
But he wanted to thank you again
for your efforts.

1593
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:40,045
That doesn't make any sense.
How did this happen?

1594
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:42,569
Well, all I know is that he
mentioned someone named Holly.

1595
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:44,397
I didn't catch everything
he said,

1596
01:09:44,571 --> 01:09:47,444
but he made it clear
it was because of her.

1597
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:52,100
Thank you.

1598
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:53,493
You're welcome.

1599
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:01,022
Theo, hi.

1600
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,633
What did you say?

1601
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:03,982
What? To who?

1602
01:10:04,156 --> 01:10:05,505
Mayor Donahue?

1603
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,986
Did you say something
to Mayor Donahue?

1604
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,596
Back up.
What's going on?

1605
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,468
You tell me, Holly.

1606
01:10:11,642 --> 01:10:13,446
His office called and told me
we lost the contract.

1607
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:15,994
What? How is that possible?

1608
01:10:16,168 --> 01:10:17,430
His assistant said it was

1609
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:19,650
because something you said
to him.

1610
01:10:19,824 --> 01:10:21,260
When did you go see the mayor?

1611
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:23,044
I didn't go see him.

1612
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,308
I mean, I saw him last night
at a charity event.

1613
01:10:25,482 --> 01:10:26,682
And you spoke to him about me?

1614
01:10:26,831 --> 01:10:30,530
Uh, he asked me a few questions,

1615
01:10:30,704 --> 01:10:36,057
like if I thought you were ready
to handle such a big contract.

1616
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:39,104
And what did you say?

1617
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:43,369
I said when I first met
you that I,

1618
01:10:43,543 --> 01:10:45,676
I didn't think that you
were ready.

1619
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:48,896
So you said no,
that I wasn't ready.

1620
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:51,464
No, I said when I first
met you then

1621
01:10:51,638 --> 01:10:53,249
I didn't think that
you were ready,

1622
01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:55,343
but now that I thought
you were absolutely ready.

1623
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:57,209
Holly, you have known me
for a week.

1624
01:10:57,383 --> 01:10:59,255
And he knows that
you've known me for a week,

1625
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:03,563
so how much can a person change
in that short period of time?

1626
01:11:03,737 --> 01:11:06,479
Apparently, a lot.

1627
01:11:06,653 --> 01:11:08,351
Because you have.

1628
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:17,229
Well that doesn't really matter,
because we lost the contract.

1629
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:19,536
Theo, I'm sorry.
I'm, I'm so sorry.

1630
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:22,321
You know, it's fine.

1631
01:11:22,495 --> 01:11:26,064
But I no longer require
your services.

1632
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:30,895
Come on, let me just finish
the party and I can fix this.

1633
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:33,985
It's okay. I will handle
it myself.

1634
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,248
Really. I insist.

1635
01:11:53,178 --> 01:11:54,701
Holly. What are you doing here?

1636
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:57,574
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for the party?

1637
01:11:57,748 --> 01:11:59,184
I'm not going.

1638
01:11:59,358 --> 01:12:00,358
Why?

1639
01:12:03,493 --> 01:12:06,452
Because I messed everything up.

1640
01:12:06,626 --> 01:12:08,585
- Oh...
- I left Encore today.

1641
01:12:08,759 --> 01:12:10,543
Oh.

1642
01:12:10,717 --> 01:12:13,087
It turns out they were never
going to give me that promotion.

1643
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:14,678
So I quit.

1644
01:12:14,852 --> 01:12:16,652
And then I messed everything up
with the mayor

1645
01:12:16,723 --> 01:12:19,552
and it cost Theo the contract.

1646
01:12:26,994 --> 01:12:28,387
Well.

1647
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:30,084
First thing's first.

1648
01:12:30,258 --> 01:12:32,652
I'm surprised you didn't quit
long before this.

1649
01:12:32,826 --> 01:12:35,612
You've been running the show
at that company for years.

1650
01:12:35,786 --> 01:12:39,180
You don't have to wait for them
to deem you ready, Holly.

1651
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,052
You're too good for that.

1652
01:12:41,226 --> 01:12:44,577
Now you can focus on events
that you'd like to create.

1653
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:47,014
And Theo,

1654
01:12:47,188 --> 01:12:50,888
I'm sure you didn't mean for him
to lose the contract.

1655
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:54,326
I didn't. I really didn't.

1656
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,460
Well, I think you should
get ready,

1657
01:12:57,634 --> 01:12:59,505
go to that party,

1658
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:02,334
tell the mayor what you meant,

1659
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:06,338
and then go tell that boy
that you have feelings for him.

1660
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:07,992
Because you do.

1661
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:10,386
It's written all over your face.

1662
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:14,477
I don't, I don't even have
anything to wear.

1663
01:13:14,651 --> 01:13:16,348
My dress is at the apartment.

1664
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:19,395
Nonsense. I have the perfect
dress for you.

1665
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:29,840
I was cleaning out the closet
the other day

1666
01:13:30,014 --> 01:13:32,190
and look what I found.

1667
01:13:32,364 --> 01:13:33,844
It's Grandma's gowns.

1668
01:13:34,018 --> 01:13:35,367
Yeah.

1669
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:39,153
I think the red one
would be perfect.

1670
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,199
Me too.

1671
01:13:41,373 --> 01:13:43,331
Thanks Mom.

1672
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:44,506
I'll go put it on.

1673
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,030
Okay.

1674
01:13:54,386 --> 01:13:55,648
Ready for the big night?

1675
01:13:55,822 --> 01:13:57,345
Hey.

1676
01:13:58,782 --> 01:14:00,566
Hey, what's wrong?

1677
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:03,917
We're out.

1678
01:14:04,091 --> 01:14:05,397
What?

1679
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:06,398
Out of the running
for the contract.

1680
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:08,226
What happened?

1681
01:14:09,357 --> 01:14:11,447
I let us down.

1682
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:13,076
Which means my dad's going
to have to go through

1683
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,885
with those layoffs.

1684
01:14:15,059 --> 01:14:17,409
But I did put in a bid
to develop new homes

1685
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:20,586
in this new development
on the East Side.

1686
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,960
But until that goes through...

1687
01:14:22,022 --> 01:14:23,720
I'm confused.

1688
01:14:23,894 --> 01:14:26,094
I thought you didn't want
to build family homes anymore.

1689
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:29,900
Family homes are what built
this company.

1690
01:14:30,074 --> 01:14:31,684
And I want to move
into commercial,

1691
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:34,905
but not if it means losing
what makes us special.

1692
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:36,472
Yeah.

1693
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:38,909
Uh, Nick.

1694
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:40,867
Please don't say anything yet.

1695
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:42,481
I don't want to ruin the night,
okay?

1696
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:43,740
Of course.

1697
01:14:43,914 --> 01:14:45,916
My lips are sealed, I promise.

1698
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:46,917
Thanks man.

1699
01:14:47,091 --> 01:14:48,440
See you out there.

1700
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,928
Okay, you guys ready?

1701
01:14:58,102 --> 01:14:59,103
Both: Yes.

1702
01:15:02,976 --> 01:15:04,500
Oh, Holly.

1703
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:07,414
You look beautiful.

1704
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,026
Stunning.

1705
01:15:14,597 --> 01:15:15,989
Thanks you guys.

1706
01:15:18,035 --> 01:15:20,603
Wait, why are you so dressed up?

1707
01:15:20,777 --> 01:15:22,450
Hey, you're not the only one
that gets invited

1708
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:24,998
to fancy Christmas parties
around here.

1709
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:26,913
Okay Dad, touché.

1710
01:15:27,087 --> 01:15:28,654
Honey.

1711
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:32,005
Following your heart is always
the right choice.

1712
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:36,270
Not always the easiest one,
but always the right choice.

1713
01:15:36,444 --> 01:15:38,534
Go follow your heart.

1714
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:45,323
Now go enjoy yourself.

1715
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:46,977
Okay.

1716
01:15:47,151 --> 01:15:48,805
Have fun.

1717
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:12,829
Quite the event you
and Miss Green

1718
01:16:13,003 --> 01:16:15,266
managed to pull off here today.

1719
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,702
Thank you sir.

1720
01:16:16,876 --> 01:16:19,052
Is she here?
I haven't seen her.

1721
01:16:19,226 --> 01:16:22,447
My family is having a blast.

1722
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:25,493
Your pitch today,
so many great ideas.

1723
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:29,062
I loved the skylight
sundial thing.

1724
01:16:29,236 --> 01:16:30,324
Fantastic.

1725
01:16:30,498 --> 01:16:31,848
That was all Holly.

1726
01:16:32,022 --> 01:16:33,893
Actually a lot of that design
was her.

1727
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:36,896
I just had the rough ideas
and she helped me refine them.

1728
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:39,029
So sorry to hear about
your model.

1729
01:16:40,247 --> 01:16:41,901
I mean, what I saw of it?

1730
01:16:42,075 --> 01:16:43,337
Stunning.

1731
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:47,187
You know you're very lucky
to have someone

1732
01:16:47,211 --> 01:16:49,561
like Miss Holly Green
supporting you.

1733
01:16:49,735 --> 01:16:51,128
You know that, Theo?

1734
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:01,399
I have to say, Son.

1735
01:17:01,573 --> 01:17:03,880
Congratulations are in order.

1736
01:17:04,054 --> 01:17:06,883
I'm not going to lie Dad,
this party was all Holly.

1737
01:17:07,057 --> 01:17:08,798
Not about that.

1738
01:17:08,972 --> 01:17:11,037
I saw you put us in for the bid
for the Hanson community.

1739
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:12,497
You realize those are houses,
right?

1740
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:13,890
I do.

1741
01:17:14,064 --> 01:17:15,718
You were right.

1742
01:17:15,892 --> 01:17:18,590
Building family homes
where people make memories,

1743
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:20,418
that's what this company
is about.

1744
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:23,595
And I'm sorry that
I was so off-base.

1745
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:27,120
I was just trying to show you
that I deserve to take over

1746
01:17:27,294 --> 01:17:29,862
as CEO because I'm good at it,

1747
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:31,864
and not just
because I'm your son.

1748
01:17:32,038 --> 01:17:33,866
You did that.

1749
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,435
As well as securing
the city center contract.

1750
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:40,046
But that call from
the mayor's office.

1751
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,660
I thought we were out
of the running.

1752
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,049
That was a mistake.

1753
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:44,964
She called to correct it
this afternoon.

1754
01:17:45,138 --> 01:17:48,011
Mayor Donahue did have
some doubts at the beginning,

1755
01:17:48,185 --> 01:17:50,491
but you proved him wrong.

1756
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,972
And his conversation
with Holly helped immensely.

1757
01:17:53,146 --> 01:17:55,932
Gave him that outside
perspective.

1758
01:17:56,106 --> 01:17:58,108
You have so much talent.

1759
01:17:58,282 --> 01:17:59,962
You just needed to get out
of your own way.

1760
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,938
Working with Holly,

1761
01:18:02,112 --> 01:18:03,940
I've seen a different side
of you.

1762
01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:06,116
I'm really proud of you.

1763
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:09,075
Where is Holly, anyway?

1764
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:10,816
Oh no.

1765
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,035
I told her not to come.

1766
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:13,863
You what?

1767
01:18:14,037 --> 01:18:15,928
Because I thought her
conversation with the mayor

1768
01:18:15,952 --> 01:18:17,301
cost us the contract.

1769
01:18:17,475 --> 01:18:19,477
I didn't know it secured it
for us.

1770
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:21,871
Oh man, I should've known.

1771
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:25,004
Part of leadership is knowing
you're going to make mistakes.

1772
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:28,878
It's how you handle the mistake
that matters most.

1773
01:18:29,052 --> 01:18:30,183
You should call her.

1774
01:18:30,357 --> 01:18:32,229
She's something special,
that one.

1775
01:18:44,023 --> 01:18:47,940
Holly, there you are.
Fantastic party.

1776
01:18:48,114 --> 01:18:50,029
Oh! Thank you sir.

1777
01:18:50,203 --> 01:18:55,469
Um, actually I wanted to talk
to you about last night.

1778
01:18:55,643 --> 01:18:56,949
I'm worried that
I said something

1779
01:18:57,123 --> 01:18:58,646
that might have
gotten misconstrued.

1780
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:01,824
No, no. I think I heard you
loud and clear.

1781
01:19:01,998 --> 01:19:03,956
You and Theo work
so well together

1782
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:05,828
and now that he's doing
the build,

1783
01:19:06,002 --> 01:19:09,875
it makes sense to hire you
to do the opening.

1784
01:19:10,049 --> 01:19:10,571
Me?

1785
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,399
Yes! Yes.

1786
01:19:12,573 --> 01:19:14,837
He said he's going to be ready
probably in late summer.

1787
01:19:15,011 --> 01:19:16,403
Sure.

1788
01:19:16,577 --> 01:19:17,143
So I'd love to see what
you come up with.

1789
01:19:17,317 --> 01:19:19,058
Great.

1790
01:19:19,232 --> 01:19:21,341
Theo's very lucky to have
someone like you in his corner.

1791
01:19:21,365 --> 01:19:23,106
Thank you.

1792
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,127
Obviously there's going to be
a lot of other projects

1793
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:26,587
that I want to talk
to you about,

1794
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:30,200
so my office will give you
a call very soon.

1795
01:19:30,374 --> 01:19:31,854
Fantastic work.

1796
01:19:32,028 --> 01:19:33,116
Thank you.

1797
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:36,075
To you and your kin

1798
01:19:36,249 --> 01:19:41,864
We wish you a Merry Christmas
and a happy New Year

1799
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:43,038
Hi.

1800
01:19:43,082 --> 01:19:44,823
Congratulations.

1801
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:46,259
Eve will be thrilled.

1802
01:19:46,433 --> 01:19:47,870
You secured that promotion, no?

1803
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:50,524
Actually, there
isn't a promotion.

1804
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:55,878
The board decided to go
another way, so I quit.

1805
01:19:56,052 --> 01:19:57,314
That's a huge loss for them.

1806
01:20:00,099 --> 01:20:02,275
Look Theo, I just, I really want
to say I'm so sorry.

1807
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:04,974
No, no, I'm sorry.

1808
01:20:05,148 --> 01:20:07,106
I had the whole situation wrong.

1809
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,152
It was because of you
we landed the contract.

1810
01:20:09,326 --> 01:20:11,110
- You did?
- Yeah.

1811
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:13,025
And I am so sorry
that I would ever think

1812
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,288
you would jeopardize that.

1813
01:20:15,462 --> 01:20:18,074
So I hope you accept my apology.

1814
01:20:20,163 --> 01:20:21,947
I don't know.

1815
01:20:22,121 --> 01:20:24,210
Of course!

1816
01:20:24,384 --> 01:20:26,952
You got the contract?
You got the contract!

1817
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:29,128
And it was all because of you.

1818
01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:33,263
I couldn't have done it
without you, Holly.

1819
01:20:33,437 --> 01:20:36,266
I don't know how to say this.

1820
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:41,140
Holly, you challenge me
and make me laugh,

1821
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:45,014
and you've made me happier than
I ever thought that I could be.

1822
01:20:45,188 --> 01:20:47,016
And I know that I'm stubborn...

1823
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:49,018
And a little bit of
a perfectionist.

1824
01:20:49,192 --> 01:20:52,021
Yeah, that might be true.

1825
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:55,111
But I've never met anyone
like you.

1826
01:20:55,285 --> 01:20:59,985
And you are so kind and
sometimes a little high strung,

1827
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:04,163
but whatever you set out to do,
you can literally accomplish it.

1828
01:21:06,122 --> 01:21:07,863
Um, Holly?

1829
01:21:08,037 --> 01:21:12,302
I'm falling for you and I can't
imagine life without you.

1830
01:21:12,476 --> 01:21:13,476
Theo...

1831
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,957
Holly! You're here.

1832
01:21:15,131 --> 01:21:16,262
Hey!

1833
01:21:16,436 --> 01:21:17,457
Yes. I'm here.
You're here?

1834
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:19,831
Oh, I love this song.

1835
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:21,354
Shall we dance?

1836
01:21:21,528 --> 01:21:24,618
Well I could never say no
to Mr. Claus.

1837
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:30,581
What do you say?
Do you want to dance?

1838
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:32,322
Of course.

1839
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:34,387
I heard the dance floor
has got some good spring.

1840
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:35,411
It does.

1841
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,284
I've been thinking...

1842
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:40,088
you're probably the only person
on earth who's funnier than me.

1843
01:21:40,112 --> 01:21:42,985
Wow. Oh Nicholas.

1844
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:44,987
Was that a compliment?

1845
01:21:45,161 --> 01:21:50,079
I was just thinking maybe we
could go to dinner sometime?

1846
01:21:50,253 --> 01:21:52,255
I wouldn't hate that.

1847
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:54,083
Is that a date?

1848
01:21:54,257 --> 01:21:55,867
It's a date.

1849
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:57,041
Nice.

1850
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:02,351
What are they doing here?

1851
01:22:02,482 --> 01:22:03,962
I invited them.

1852
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:05,505
I told you we had a fancy
Christmas party

1853
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:06,965
to go to tonight.

1854
01:22:07,139 --> 01:22:08,139
Sneaky!

1855
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:10,929
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1856
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,884
- Hey.
- Hi, Merry Christmas.

1857
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:14,058
Merry Christmas to you.

1858
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:19,847
This night turned out
pretty magical, huh?

1859
01:22:20,022 --> 01:22:21,240
It sure did.

1860
01:22:22,241 --> 01:22:27,029
I would say the memories from
this experience are priceless.

1861
01:22:31,381 --> 01:22:33,165
Me too.

1862
01:22:35,428 --> 01:22:40,346
And I wanted to tell you
I'm falling for you too.

1863
01:22:59,148 --> 01:23:00,845
Merry Christmas everybody!
