- Actually, no, I'm okay.

22
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:07,825
The box is big. Can
you get the door for me?

23

- Sure.

24
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:10,222

- [Reporter] We interrupt
this program to bring you

44
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,507
a special news bulletin.

45
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,877
The bodies of two men
were found in a back lot

46
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,097
behind castcom cable company.

47
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,587
Police say the mo is the
same as the current killings

48
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,237
which have plagued our city.

49
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,737
Police are also dubbing this case

50
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,437
the vampire killer case
because of the fact that most

51
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,844
of the victims had gaping
wounds around their neck.

52
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:56,677

- [Woman] Hi, can I help you?

56
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,287
- Hi. My name is Seth. I'm your neighbor.

57
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,537
I just wanted to come and
welcome you to the neighborhood.

58
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,370
- Well, thank you.

59
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,867
Why don't you come in for a second?

60
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,800
I don't know many people around here.

61
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,677
Can I get you anything?

62
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,519
- Oh, no thank you.

63
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:18,877
I have a roommate. Her name is Tangie.

64
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,347
You'll get to meet her eventually.

65
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,853
I'm sure we'll become really
good friends for eternity.

66
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,620
Do you live alone?

67
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,993
- Yeah, I'm divorced.

68
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,750
- Mmm, wow, you are so beautiful.

69
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,833
- Excuse me?

74
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,067
Um, I've got packing that I have to finish.

75
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,587
So do you wanna come
for dinner tomorrow night?

76
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,267
- [Seth] Okay, it's a date.

77
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,155
- Great. See you tomorrow around 7:00?

78
00:14:27,238 --> 00:14:28,373
- [Seth] Yes.

79
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:30,299
- Thanks.

(Staff chatting indistinctly)

83
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:02,197
- Good morning. - [Bates] Good morning.

84
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,330
- You look like shit.

85
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,007
- Go fuck yourself.

86
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,297
Had a rough night.

87
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,427
- You always have a rough night.

88
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,197
What the hell do you do all night?

89
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,280
- Well, (sighing) I sit awake for hours

90
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,087
and I dread the thought
of looking at your face

91
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,417
each and every morning
as I come into the office.

92
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,637
- Imagine if we didn't like each other.

93
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,627
- Can you imagine that?

94
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,117
Hey, you got anything on the vampire case?

95
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,657
- Are you still insisting on
calling this the vampire case?

96
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,097
- You got a better explanation?

97
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,047
- Sure. Lunatic with an ice pick.

98
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,207
A nutcase with too much time on his hands.

99
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,140
Video tape editor who works too much.

100
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,117
- (Sighing) Yeah?

101
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,237
How about a vampire with
a terrific appetite for blood?

102
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,363
- Yeah, I know I got the jackets here.

103
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,677
Puncture wounds around the neck,

104
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,307
broken bones as if the
killer had super strength,

105
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,743
no blood left in the body.

106
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,657
I could give you half a
dozen reasons for that.

107
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,947
- Yeah, I bet you could, but
the best one is it's a vampire.

108
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,293
- Ain't no such thing. (Phone ringing)

109
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,733
Homicide. Badger.

110
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:11,963
What?

111
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,183
You're kidding.

112
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,283
Okay. Where is it now?

113
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,927
We'll be right down.

114
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,367
Check this out.

115
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,200
- [Bates] What do you got?

116
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:23,587
- Somebody was shooting an amateur video

117
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,907
the night of the last murder.

118
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,190
They got it all on tape.

119
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,857
- And where's this tape now?

120
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,833
- Down in the video room with herbie.

121
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,197
- Well, let's go down and see herbie.

122
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,113
- Amazing.

123
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:41,441
(Video whirring)

124
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,310
- Okay, herb. Show us what you got.

125
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,275
- Okay.

126
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:52,358
Say, has anybody seen
"spaceship explorer" last week?

127
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:54,127
- Right there, right there.

128
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,705
Hold that.

129
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:56,538
- Okay.

130
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:57,757
Can you move in a
little on that? Clear it up?

131
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,523
- I think so.

132
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,657
I just don't like that new show.

133
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,973
- Why not?

134
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:06,967
- Don't bother him now.

135
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,864
- But I like that show.

136
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:13,237
- "Deep space four," it really sucks.

137
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,407
I tell ya.

138
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,147
- Now wait a minute. I like that show.

139
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,517
- Would you please let the man do his job?

140
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,433
- Sorry.

141
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:23,049
(Tape whirring)

142
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,013
- Uh, herbie?

143
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:29,846
- [Herbie] Hmm?

144
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:31,267
- What the hell is this?

145
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,047
- Uh, vice had a raid
on a porno ring last night,

146
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,133
so I just managed to steal a copy.

147
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:41,047
- [Bates] Yeah, it looks like
the vice boys have been doing

148
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,003
their job again.

149
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,440
- I am in the wrong division.

150
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,063
- Right there. Hold that.

151
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,243
(Dark ominous music)

152
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,943
I could be wrong, but it sure
looks like a vampire to me.

153
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,363
- Oh. Maybe.

154
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,477
Herbie, give us a hard copy of that.

155
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,310
- Sure.

156
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:08,444
- If she's not a vampire, she
sure needs a new orthodontist.

157
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:12,787
- "Babylonia six" had a
show about a vampire once.

158
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,347
It was just terrible.

159
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,147
- [Bates] Herbie? - [Herbie] Hmm?

160
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,577
- [Bates] The video, please.

161
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,700
- [Herbie] Oh, yeah. Sure.

162
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:24,236
(Upbeat seductive music)

163
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,297
- [Woman] Oh my god.

164
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,857
You scared the hell out of me.

165
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,207
How did you get in here?

166
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,493
- The door was open.

167
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,627
- It was?

168
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,793
- Mmm-hmm.

169
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,997
- [Woman] Hey, I'm not
done with the salad yet.

170
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,347
- Smells delicious.

171
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,517
- [Woman] It's filet mignon.

172
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,050
How do you like yours cooked?

173
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,565
- Bloody.

174
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:59,017
- Okay, can you get the
champagne outta the fridge

175
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,477
for me while I finish cooking here?

176
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,033
- Okay. - [Woman] Thanks.

177
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:08,839
(Knife chopping)

178
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,417
Ow! Damn it!

179
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,037
- [Seth] What happened?

180
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,597
- [Woman] I cut my finger.

181
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,963
- [Seth] Let me look at that.

182
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:21,310
- [Woman] Mmm.

183
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,226
- Mmm.

184
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,330
I'm used to blood.

185
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,733
I used to be a nurse many, many years ago.

186
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,967
- Hey, what are you doing?

187
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,513
I'll get a bandage for
that. Don't worry about it.

(Upbeat rock music continues)

202
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,847
- I've been waiting for you.

203
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,227
- Yeah, I had to get my bandaid on.

204
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,060
Thanks.

205
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:52,087
- Here you go. - Thank you.

206
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,107
- You're welcome.

207
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,339
- Hey, listen.

208
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,887
I was wondering, is there
anything to do around here?

209
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,447
Like, what's the nightlife like?

210
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,030
- It depends what you're into.

211
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,427
- Well, you know, it's been
a while since I've been out.

212
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,607
So I was wondering maybe, you
know, about going out dancing.

213
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,157
- Oh, there's a great
club called after dark,

214
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,777
and I think you'd be into it.

215
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,307
Well, it opens after midnight,

216
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,347
it's in the city and it's underground.

217
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,147
Great music. Great atmosphere.

218
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,509
I'll take you there
tomorrow night if you want.

219
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:18,547
- [Woman] But it's open so late.

220
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,467
- [Seth] Yeah, but
that's an after hours club.

221
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,350
That's where you wanna go, isn't it?

222
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,397
Wouldn't you like to try it?

223
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,932
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

224
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:27,157
- It would be fun. - When do you wanna go?

225
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,467
- We can go tomorrow evening if you'd like.

226
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,787
- All right. Okay.

227
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,703
Hey, listen.

228
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,867
Have you heard that thing on the news

229
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,747
about those two guys
that got killed last night?

230
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,737
They're saying something about it being

231
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,867
a vampire that did it?
(Creepy ominous music)

232
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,783
- Hmm.

233
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,033
Cheers.

234
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:48,394
(Creepy ominous music)

235
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,727
- [Woman] Anyway, can
you believe that there's

236
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,853
such things as vampires?

237
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,853
- I gotta go.

238
00:27:03,378 --> 00:27:05,125

242
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,600
- Come on. Don't sit down.

243
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:20,557
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

244
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,027
- [Seth] Relax. We've got all night.

245
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,986
Sit. Grab a seat. I wanna go.

246
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:24,819
- I wanna go. Come on.

247
00:27:24,902 --> 00:27:26,227
It's been so long since I've been out.

248
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,057
I even put on my thong.

249
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,613
- I know. You look wonderful.

250
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,660
Just have a seat.

251
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,257
- What's the matter? You
don't wanna go out anymore?

252
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,727
- No, it's not that I don't wanna go out.

253
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,007
I just wanna relax for a moment.

254
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,447
- Yeah, well, I mean, you ran out on me

255
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,780
the other night so quick.

256
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,497
Did I do something?
You don't like my dinner?

257
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,443
- No, no. Everything was wonderful.

258
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,647
Well, I don't know if I should tell you.

259
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,933
- [Woman] Why not?

260
00:27:52,814 --> 00:27:54,127
Did I do something?

261
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,137
- No, I don't think you did anything wrong.

262
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,270
I just don't know if you're ready for it.

263
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:01,057
- Do I need to prepare for this?

264
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,189
I mean, like-

265
00:28:03,272 --> 00:28:04,722
- it depends. It's up to you.

266
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:07,263
Would you like to know?

267
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,270
- Is this gonna hurt?

- If this guy shows up,

272
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,077
he should have enough smack on him

273
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,110
to send him all the way to San Quentin.

274
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,130
- Well, we're homicide.

275
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,037
- Yeah, but he's bumped off about five guys

276
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,788
in the process of getting his dope.

277
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:01,087
- [John] Oh, that's why
we got this crummy detail.

278
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,887
- Yep, the vice boys were too busy

279
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,272
with a few other things, but, uh-

280
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:06,755
- yeah, they're understaffed down there.

285
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,297
- Where? - Your vampire!

286
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,317
- Where?

287
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,243
Go after her!

288
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,942
Well? - Did you see her?

289
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:37,197
- I didn't see nothing.

290
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,030
All right. You go back that way.

291
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:38,863
I'll go this way.

292
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:41,559
We'll see if we can cut her off, all right?

293

What?

296
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:01,919
- I saw her go up that way.

297
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:03,117
- So we go up there? - Yeah.

298
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,950
- All right. You go up that way.

299
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,500
I'll go around back. All right? Go.

- All right.

303
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:22,835
Check the rest in the backyard.

304
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:24,216
I'll check down in the basement.

305
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,132
- Right.

- [Bates] What?

313
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:13,770
- [John] Better take a look at this.

314
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:16,237
- [Bates] Yeah, all right.

315
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,377
- [John] All clear back there?

316
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,210
- [Bates] All clear.

317
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:20,991
- [John] What the,
what do you think this is?

318
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:21,824
- [Bates] I'm afraid to look.

319
00:33:21,907 --> 00:33:23,630
- [John] I hope it's cranberry juice.

320
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,547
- [Bates] It's warm. Very warm.

321
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,130
- [John] Warm cranberry juice.

322

(Bates sniffing)

323
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:34,356
- [Bates] Blood.

- (Sniffing) Blood.

325
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,100
- [Bates] Yeah. - [John] Shit.

326
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,583
- [Bates] Looks like
someone's down a quart.

327
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,543
- Shit.

328
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,157
Let's get outta here.

329
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,537
- [Bates] Yeah, I'm with you.

330
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,347
- Check out the garage or somethin'.

331
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:01,650
(Door whirring)

332
00:34:15,272 --> 00:34:17,105
What the hell is that?

333
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,607
- That over there is a '61 triumph.

334
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,440
- Nice car.

335
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:25,653
- That over there, well,
let's just say it ain't no coffin.

(Spaceship whirring)

337

- [Bates] I'll be damned.

340
00:34:45,588 --> 00:34:46,796
- [John] How are we gonna write this up?

341
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,629
- [Bates] I don't think we should.

342
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,062
I think this is gonna be an open case.

343
00:34:50,145 --> 00:34:53,645
(Tense suspenseful music)

344
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:58,460
(Spaceship whirring)

345
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,537
- [Kathy] She is timeless.

346
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,997
This is the phenomenon
discovered by my friend,

347
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,097
police detective John badger.

348
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,547
My name is Kathy, and I am
an undercover police officer

349
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,863
living in Florida.

350
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,077
John was working on a
cut and dried murder case

351
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,647
when suddenly, shockingly,
all the clues pointed

352
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,137
to the prime suspect being a vampire.

353
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,297
His discoveries were fantastic,

354
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,152
and became even more
outrageous when he suggested

355
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:38,133
that this race of beautiful
blood suckers hailed from space.

356
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,557
John and his partner were
on the verge of discovering

357
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,477
the vampire's lair when they witnessed

358
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,087
a remarkable and horrifying site.

359
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,517
John has filed the case as unsolved,

360
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,087
not daring to report the
unbelievable things he has seen.

361
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,967
My instincts tell me that
this blood-thirsty vampire

362
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,767
has not fled the planet, but
is merely relocated to my city.

363
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,527
A recent rash of
unexplained murders involving

364
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,477
female prostitutes drained of blood

365
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,997
convinces me beyond a doubt.

366
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,703
This is my story.

367
00:36:11,991 --> 00:36:15,408
(Seductive guitar music)

368
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,910
- [Vampire] You ready?

369
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:31,639
- Always.

370
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:36,872
(Seductive guitar music)

371
00:36:53,235 --> 00:36:56,735
(Tense suspenseful music)

373
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:11,044
(Kathy screaming)

374
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:12,710
- Was just a dream.

375
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:17,169
Yeah. Okay, I'll be there.

376
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,443
Go back to sleep. I've gotta go to work.

377
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,873
- Every day, same shit.

378
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,877
Every day.

379
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,853
- It's my job.

380
00:37:29,936 --> 00:37:31,777
- Then do your fuckin' job.

381
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,723
- [Kathy] Okay. Be unreasonable.

382
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:38,409
(Upbeat rock music)

383
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,537
- Who called you in?

384
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,277
- It's my case.

385
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,597
- You know, if the captain, he sees you,

386
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,217
he's going to suspend you.

387
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,567
- Well, let me deal with that, all right?

388
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,350
- [Detective] Another rug muncher.

389
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:58,023
- Oh, really interesting. Rug munching.

390
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:04,133
(Soft suspenseful music)

391
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,707
- And what the fuck is this?

392
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,540
- A murder.

393
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,853
- No, shit for brains. Kathy, outside.

394
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,398
You took a shot at detective
Carlos the other day.

395
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:20,707
- I know. It was dark.

396
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,297
It was an accident.

397
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,787
- I don't know what's going on with you,

398
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,324
but I know that it started
with unsolved murders.

399
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:28,920
Kathy, Kathy, go home.

(Tense suspenseful music)

402
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,910
- Son of a bitch.

(Tense suspenseful music)

404
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:26,403
Ugh, no way.

405
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,177
Joe, she's a vampire.

406
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,797
- Great. Who's the vampire?

407
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,357
- The killer.

408
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,527
Well, she's a vampire.

409
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,937
At least she thinks she is.

410
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,277
- And I'm a leprechaun
knocking around never never land.

411
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,857
- Come on, get serious.

412
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,997
I'm talking for real.

413
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,017
- Get off the pipe.

414
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,227
- Look, I'm gonna catch
this bitch with or without you.

415
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,157
- Well, have fun.

416
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,452
Try not to get bit.

417
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:53,883
- Asshole.

(Soft dramatic synth music continues)

422
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,664
- So what's your name anyway, honey?

423
00:41:26,747 --> 00:41:27,937
- Liette. What's yours?

424
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,227
- Cindy.

425
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,147
- I charged by the hour, Cindy.

426
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,457
- Well, don't worry about it, liette.

427
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,833
I have plenty of money.

428
00:41:36,636 --> 00:41:40,303
(Soft dramatic synth music)

429
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:49,861

(Upbeat rock music)

433
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,617
- [Kathy] Thought you
went to go find yourself

434
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,507
and clear your head or something?

435
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,857
- What's this shit?

436
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,027
- It's for work.

437
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,497
- What are you doing?

438
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,884
- I'm working on a case.

439
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:36,427
- "A living vampire." What is this shit?

440
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,264
- I told you, I'm working on a case.

441
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,787
"The book of nod."

442
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,767
- What are you being an asshole for?

443
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,747
- An asshole? You're being weird.

444
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,937
- No, I'm just doing my job.

445
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,520

(Bluesy guitar music)

448
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:46,387
- What you want, baby?

449
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,303
- I don't know.

450
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,131
- Do not tell me this is your first time.

451
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:53,553
- Yeah, it is.

452
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,037
Stop. I can't do this.

453
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,383
- Slow down, baby.

454
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,053
Relax.

455
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,533
Not so bad, was it?

457
00:44:30,143 --> 00:44:33,726
(Tense suspenseful music)

458

- Where have you been?

459
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,147
- [Kathy] You creep.

460
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,007
What are you doing here?

461
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:51,967
- I live here.

462
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:52,837
- It's been a long night.

463
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,877
I really don't feel like fighting.

464
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,777
- The hotel called.

465
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,177
You left your wedding
ring in one of their rooms.

466
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,647
- I'll pick it up later.

467
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,757
- What was his name?

468
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,807
- Who?

469
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,217
- The guy you fucked last night.

470
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,827
- Wasn't a guy. Was a girl.

471
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:06,967
- You fucked a chick?

472
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,433
- Happened last night.

473
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,667
Guess you could say I'm bisexual.

474
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,717
- When did this shit happen?

475
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,727
- I've always felt this way.

476
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,647
I just couldn't tell you.

477
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:18,873
Happened last night.

478
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,957
Maybe if you're nice, I'll
let you join in next time.

479
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,307
- What? I'm not good enough.

480
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,747
- I didn't say that.

481
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,997
- Well, I'd better get outta
here before I say something

482
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,923
I might regret.

483
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,454
- Todd, wait a minute.

484
00:45:32,537 --> 00:45:35,537
(Upbeat rock music)

485
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:54,378

- Ugh!

490
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,843
- Don't fight me. You can't win.

491
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,787
You have a gun?

492
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:49,927
Guns can't hurt me.

493
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,873
- Oh, I've got something for you.

494
00:46:53,014 --> 00:46:53,988
Ugh!

495
00:46:54,071 --> 00:46:56,320
- I'm blind!

496
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:58,837
I am 200 years old.

497
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,147
Do you think someone
hasn't tried to throw holy water

498
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,887
in my face before?

499
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:05,028
- This will be the last time!

500
00:47:05,111 --> 00:47:07,220

Hi, Todd.

505
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,257
Yeah, sure you can come on over.

506
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,119
We'll have a bite. (Chuckling)
