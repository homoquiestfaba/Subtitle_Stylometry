00:00:00,341 --> 00:00:02,758
(calm music)

2
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:13,723
(majestic music)

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,549
Hi, this is Maryam Ali.

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,040
Hi, this is...

5
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:26,999
A-E-I-O-U.

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,279
Nay, nay, nah, no, nu.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,939
Hi, this is Maryam Ali,
reporting live from Pakistan.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,829
Hi, this is...

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,499
Hi, this is Mary.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,370
Mary.

11
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,739
Hi, this is Mary Ali.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,049
Hi, this is Mary Adams reporting live

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,999
from Los Angeles, California,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,459
where we bring you the absolute best.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,743
Welcome to News Live at Five.

16
00:00:55,419 --> 00:00:58,002
(upbeat music)

17
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:27,732
(ball smacks)

18
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,059
Stay down, just butt
down, down, up, nice.

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,129
There's an arm right there,
there's a big league arm.

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,659
Nice.

21
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,279
Here we go.

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,199
Nice, there's a scoop.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,609
Good feet work.

24
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,450
Oh, there's a hop.

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,410
Come on now.

26
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:41,819
Let's go, less crap.

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,869
Get down, down, down, down, up, down, up.

28
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,011
Let's go.

29
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:50,589
You got it, Zack.

30
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,173
(upbeat music)

31
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:09,149
[Cameron] Hi, guys, I'm Cameron.

32
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,791
Everyone calls me Cam, and I'm an addict.

33
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,599
[All] Hi, Cam.

34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,089
I'm two years sober.

35
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,293
It's been hard as hell.

36
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,833
I struggle every day with the crash.

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,339
The click in the brain, it goes haywire.

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,379
We all know when the click hits.

39
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,439
You wake up three days
later in a California haze.

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,040
Is that what the sun feels like?

41
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,740
Where have you been, Cameron?

42
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,663
There's no sunshine in jail.

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,223
There's time and silence.

44
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,793
You in your head.

45
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,509
Words spinning around.

46
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,529
You think you're going crazy,

47
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,373
trying to battle something
that you can control.

48
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,429
I stand here strong

49
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,480
and able to talk and share with you guys.

50
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,651
I don't want you to be
afraid of what's in here.

51
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,570
Or out there.

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,523
Nobody is above anybody in here.

53
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,510
We're equals.

54
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,037
Equally human with flaws.

55
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:16,319
(bike clanks)

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,389
I've biked past here for
years on my way to school,

57
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,929
never thought of coming
in, but I'm here now.

58
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,459
I don't do drugs.

59
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,460
And I don't drink.

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,239
Much.

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,039
I don't like the way it makes me feel.

62
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,679
I mean, drink or no drink,
I'm still the same weirdo.

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,003
Butt down, there you go.

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,459
You've gotta look the ball
into your glove, all right?

65
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,199
Let's go, you gotta concentrate.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,033
Mr. Walker,

67
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,522
don't you think you're
being a little hard on him?

68
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:41,399
I can't afford to send him to college.

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Let's go.

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,763
Come on, Zack, you got it.

71
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:46,620
Atta boy!

72
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,620
That's a good throw.

73
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:50,503
You doing?

74
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:55,079
Are you laughing?

75
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,180
No, wasn't laughing.

76
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,273
You can pick the balls up.

77
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,413
(upbeat music)

78
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,229
Nicole, you need to focus, all right?

79
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,119
If you're gonna get into a good college,

80
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,799
you have got to straighten up.

81
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,850
Oh, okay, Dad, I'll just straighten up.

82
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,179
Go get cleaned up.

83
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,889
Your mother's bringing a guest home.

84
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,089
Guest?

85
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,039
A foreign exchange
student from Pakistan.

86
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,030
She's coming to live with us.

87
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:40,319
It's through the church.

88
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,659
Look, it's just for
your senior year, okay?

89
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,909
She can stay in your room,
you can take the guest room.

90
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,959
Screw that.

91
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,039
[Bill] Hey!

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Nicole!

93
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:57,155
(Nicole grunts)

94
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:59,573
(slow music)

95
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,589
Nicole will be happy to give up the room

96
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,590
for you this year.

97
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,763
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

98
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:22,764
Oh, Nicole!

99
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:29,789
Get up and go clean your room.

100
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,409
- No.
- Now.

101
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,699
Make her do it.

102
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,113
What is wrong with you?

103
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,419
So how was your flight?

104
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,339
It was long, but it was fine.

105
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,223
I'm happy to eat and sleep
tonight, so thank you.

106
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,489
You speak English very well.

107
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,159
I do detect a slight British accent.

108
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,789
I got an academic scholarship
to an international school.

109
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,540
My father couldn't afford to
send me to private school.

110
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:58,559
Oh, well, congratulations.

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Thank you.

112
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,223
Congratulations on being poor.

113
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,879
Nice of you to join us.

114
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,680
I've only come because I'm hungry.

115
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,420
Have a roll.

116
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,650
So tomorrow is Sunday and
every Sunday we go to church.

117
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,579
We never miss.

118
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,499
You know, I think you'll
like being around this.

119
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,333
It's nice.

120
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:26,733
It's spiritual and they
have wonderful music.

121
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,553
Do they have music in Pakistan?

122
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Yes.

123
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,859
Church is actually pretty boring,

124
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,139
just a bunch of old guys
telling women how to act,

125
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,613
what to say, how to dress.

126
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,063
So you get really sweaty in that thing?

127
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,849
Nicole, I'm sure it has a name.

128
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,229
It's called a hijab.

129
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,759
It's actually light.

130
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,289
Cool.

131
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,290
Cool.

132
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,289
You like being a Muslim?

133
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,130
Nicole.

134
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:57,869
I love being a Muslim.

135
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,069
It's who I am.

136
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,359
I'm going out.

137
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,559
We just sat down.

138
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,969
It's early.

139
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,039
You still have a 12 o'clock curfew.

140
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,989
Do they have a curfew in Pakistan?

141
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,099
I just stay at home.

142
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,023
Home is the safest place.

143
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,689
You're just gonna sit there
in that stupid head thing

144
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,829
or you're gonna come with me?

145
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,663
I can introduce you

146
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:16,880
to all the shallow losers
I go to school with.

147
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:21,659
(silverware clatters)

148
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,660
[Bill] Have fun.

149
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,260
[Beth] I'm making eggs, Nicole!

150
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,800
Why are you yelling?

151
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:41,883
I'm right here.

152
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,199
Plastic straws, really?

153
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
Where are my stainless steel straws?

154
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,673
Protein?

155
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:50,506
I hate eggs.

156
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:53,219
I've hated them my entire
life, turtle killer.

157
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,419
[Beth] Then I'll eat them.

158
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,059
Take note, stainless steel straws.

159
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,853
I'm driving to school, you wanna come?

160
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,500
Sure.

161
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:03,089
Cool.

162
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,259
Thank you so much for the eggs.

163
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,279
Have a good day.

164
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,445
You too.

165
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:07,446
- Bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

166
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,559
Eggs were great.

167
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,393
Really good.

168
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:12,536
Well, thank you.

169
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:13,537

Thanks for the announcement.

191
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,276
Hi, Zackie.

192
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:16,806

Good morning.

197
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,389
Hey, Scarlet.

198
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,219
Hi, Becky.

199
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,419
It's Grace.

200
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,380
Grace, right.

201
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,180
Do you have a tampon I could borrow?

202
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Borrow?

203
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,170
Uh, yeah!

204
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,693
Fellas.

205
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:42,920
- Mr. Walker.
- Mr. Walker.

206
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,873
Hi, boys.

207
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,869
You know I'm taking you out this year.

208
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,909
Oh, you are so cute, Jeff.

209
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,019
Well, come on.

210
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,219
I ask you out every year.

211
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,449
Never gonna happen.

212
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,699
Oh, like you think you
have a better shot than I do?

213
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,809
I'm gonna say yeah.

214
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,810
Well, we'll see.

215
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,133
Why would you do that?

216
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:05,993
Did you see the way she was
looking at me right there?

217
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:07,649
Yeah, but you totally embarrassed me.

218
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,689
I'm telling you, this
is my year with her.

219
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,819
I'm finally gonna get a
chance to take her out.

220
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,259
She's gonna be my girlfriend.

221
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,660
Not if I get to her first.

222
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,130
We gotta get her phone number.

223
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,950
Do you know someone who knows it?

224
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:20,969
Fail English?

225
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,829
I'm gonna fail too.

226
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,089
Put together a proposal
and see what we can do.

227
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,713
Another year of school,
another underpaid teacher.

228
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,449
How do you keep coming back?

229
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,799
I think it's obvious.

230
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,689
The great cafeteria food.

231
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,889
The jokes are getting old.

232
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,723
We're old.

233
00:10:38,724 --> 00:10:39,959
Yes, we are.

234
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,209
It's coming up on 20 years, Bill.

235
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,399
Yep, you're still not getting a raise.

236
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,233
Ah.

237
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:47,670
You are getting a new
student though, from Pakistan.

238
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,759
Maryam Ali.

239
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
She's...

240
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:54,144
She's a nice kid.

241
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,153
Zack, let's go.

242
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,559
So I was thinking you should run with me

243
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,969
on homecoming court.

244
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,803
Really?

245
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:11,039
Yeah.

246
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,873
I don't know.

247
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:12,899
You're the one with all the voters.

248
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,353
I think that if I vote
for you, you'll be good.

249
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,439
All right, I'm in.

250
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,273
- You're in?
- Yeah.

251
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:21,329
- Okay, great.
- Might as well, let's do it.

252
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,163
Awesome.

253
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:23,372
Sounds good, I'll see you later.

254
00:11:23,373 --> 00:11:24,743
- Okay, yeah, I'll see you.
- Bye.

255
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:28,051
You see that?

256
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,068
What was up with that?

257
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:30,887
You see that?

258
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:33,471
(bell ringing)

259
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,453
A-E-I-O-U.

260
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,459
Nay, nay, nah, no, nu.

261
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,119
Hi, this is Maryam Ali
reporting live from Pakistan.

262
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,139
Hi, this is...

263
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,959
A-E-I-O-U.

264
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,579
Nay.

265
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,489
A-E-I-O-U.

266
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,133
Nay, nay, nah, no, nu.

267
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,189
Hi, this is Maryam Ali.

268
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,869
Hi, this is Maryam Ali.

269
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,139
Hi, this is Maryam Ali
reporting live from Pakistan.

270
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,219
This is Mary Ali.

271
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,929
Hi, this is Mary Ali.

272
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,572
Hi, this is Mary Adams reporting live.

273
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:21,929
This Mary Adams reporting live from...

274
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,379
Hi, this is Mary Adams reporting live

275
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,249
from Los Angeles, California
here at News Live at Five,

276
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,073
where we bring you the absolute best.

277
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,483
(toilet flushing)

278
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,349
How long have you been in there?

279
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,513
A-E-I-O-U.

280
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,289
Diction warmups.

281
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,929
I sent in my application
to California University

282
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,729
for journalism.

283
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,679
I'm gonna be a reporter on TV.

284
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,169
Muslim girl on TV in America.

285
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,170
I can see it.

286
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,669
Hey, brown girl.

287
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,323
Was your dad a part of 9-11?

288
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,150
ISIS called.

289
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:07,739
They're looking for
their number one recruit.

290
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,139
Her dad wasn't a part of
ISIS cuz it was Al-Qaeda.

291
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,345
Seriously, guys.

292
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:12,929
(locker clangs)

293
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,013
Don't be assholes.

294
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,519
Dude, you gotta stick up for yourself.

295
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,929
They already don't like you.

296
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,139
I'm sorry.

297
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,973
(bell ringing)

298
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:25,949
Hey, let's go, quiet, quiet.

299
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,873
Pearl Harbor.

300
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,809
Terrorism before it had a name.

301
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,019
Do I have any students
with relatives still alive

302
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,220
that lived through this?

303
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,689
My great-grandfather was
the same age I am right now

304
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,429
during World War II.

305
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,338
Was your great-grandfather
a kamikaze terrorist?

306
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:48,172
(students laughing)

307
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:49,319
Guys, settle.

308
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,529
My great-grandfather was
thrown into prison camp

309
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,959
just because he looked Japanese.

310
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,549
Look Japanese?

311
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,169
You are Japanese.

312
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,849
No, I'm American.

313
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,089
I was born here, just
like my great-grandfather.

314
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,979
After the Pearl Harbor attack,

315
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,189
President Roosevelt ordered
100,000 Japanese put

316
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,689
into internment camps.

317
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,789
More than half of the
Japanese detained were

318
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,679
United States citizens.

319
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,079
One of them was my great-grandfather,

320
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,229
who basically was forced
to live in a horse stall.

321
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,729
Okay.

322
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,013
So if we did it with Pearl Harbor,

323
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,999
why didn't we do it with
the Muslims after 9-11?

324
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,459
This wasn't about any security risk.

325
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,699
All Japanese Americans living
in the United States were

326
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,379
profiled as enemy.

327
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,823
That's racial profiling.

328
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,419
Maryam Ali?

329
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,410
Yes.

330
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,479
Okay, so our new exchange
student wants to talk

331
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,630
about racial profiling.

332
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,579
So, what is racial profiling?

333
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,079
Someone give me an example.

334
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,159
Asians can't drive.

335
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
Hot girls are sluts.

336
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,489
I am not a race.

337
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,490
Yes, you are.

338
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,549
Cops shooting black people.

339
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,689
Okay, good.

340
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,609
All Mexicans are in the drug cartel.

341
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,378
White guys shooting up churches?

342
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,029
Black people are better at rapping.

343
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,829
Yeah, but Eminem is still good though.

344
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,239
Some of these are stereotypes.

345
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,379
There's a difference.

346
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,213
There is.

347
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:11,459
So, racial profiling,
someone give me an example.

348
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,679
All Muslims are terrorists.

349
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,959
What does a white boy
from Hermosa Beach know

350
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,463
about racial profiling?

351
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,533
My dad hates Muslims.

352
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,473
But I don't think all
Muslims are terrorists.

353
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,833
And I don't think all jocks are stupid.

354
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,963
Listen, 9-11's coming up, so be aware.

355
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I'm Zack.

356
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,653
I'm Maryam, the terrorist.

357
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:12,989
I don't believe that.

358
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,349
Let's leave this dumb
jock to his one brain cell.

359
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,609
Bye, Maryam.

360
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,439
Just call me Mary.

361
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,569
What's wrong with Maryam?

362
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,343
Nothing, I guess.

363
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,359
[Nicole] Mary?

364
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,949
It's easier.

365
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,983
Okay, Mary, what are you
gonna do with all American Zack?

366
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,662
I don't know.

367
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:44,669
I have an idea.

368
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,869
Take that thing off your head.

369
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,459
He didn't seem to
have a problem with it.

370
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,719
Oh, shit, it's America's future.

371
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,553
Shoot me.

372
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:50,913
Oh, shut up, weirdo.

373
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,889
So what's your excuse

374
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,929
for hanging out with this towelhead freak?

375
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,299
I'm not wearing a towel on my head.

376
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,099
Oh, I'm sorry, she meant dishrag.

377
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,119
It's called hijab.

378
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,469
It's part of our culture.

379
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,549
You ever take that thing off?

380
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,659
Yes, at night.

381
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,429
Then maybe people wouldn't stare.

382
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,349
I don't mind if they stare.

383
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,379
Are people's lives that
unoriginal and boring?

384
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,419
Well, we don't like looking at it.

385
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,253
Take it off.

386
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:15,269
If I were ever to take it off,

387
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,303
it wouldn't be because some
meathead chick told me to do so.

388
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:22,889
(Maryam screaming)

389
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,909
Give it back!

390
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,056
Mr. Walker, they're beating
up the new raghead girl

391
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:27,659
in the locker room.

392
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,660
Go to the field.

393
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,841
[Maryam] This is horrible!

394
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:31,680
All right, that's it!

395
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:32,789
Oh my god.

396
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,739
No, you need to go back to
wherever you came from, okay?

397
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,179
Oh my god, like I'm gonna-

398
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,180
- Hey!

399
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,130
What's going on?

400
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,123
Let's go, on the field.

401
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:43,109
You guys can beat each other up out there.

402
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,403
Yes, Mr. Walker.

403
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,190
Meathead chick?

404
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:51,599
How'd you come up with that one?

405
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,069
Google.

406
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,563
Good one, I'll see you outside.

407
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Hey, raghead.

408
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,750
What did you call me?

409
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,982
You heard me.

410
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:06,870
I did.

411
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:08,309
It's offensive, right?

412
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,599
Highly.

413
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,769
Well, maybe if you took it off,

414
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,479
people wouldn't call you that.

415
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,209
Or you could tell the students
to stop the name calling.

416
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,233
That might help.

417
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,083
Could you please leave?

418
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:19,113
I'm changing!

419
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:31,980
(knocking)

420
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Come in.

421
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:34,734
Hey, Dad.

422
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:35,730
Hey, girls.

423
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:36,830
What can I do for you?

424
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,620
Maryam was called a raghead today.

425
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,289
I'm sorry, what?

426
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,877
Maryam was called a raghead.

427
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,423
I apologize.

428
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,659
Sorry, boys at this age can be ignorant.

429
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,213
It was from a teacher.

430
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:00,703
I will have a conversation
with Mr. Walker.

431
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:12,094
(bell ringing)

432
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:18,389
You know, I'm thinking about
not wearing my hijab anymore.

433
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,682
Maybe if I stop wearing it,

434
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:21,749
then all these people would stop giving me

435
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,399
all this attention.

436
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,233
It's up to you.

437
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:26,248
Wear it or don't, I'll support it.

438
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,210
Own it.

439
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:28,379
Come on, own it.

440
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,519
Own it.

441
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
I'm a Muslim.

442
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,903
Say it, come on.

443
00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:33,903
I am a Muslim.

444
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,489
I'm a Muslim.

445
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,933
Yeah, you are!

446
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,633
Come on, I am a Muslim.

447
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,029
I am a Muslim.

448
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,634
- Yeah.
- I'm a Muslim!

449
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:47,468
That's right.

450
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:48,301
I'm proud of being a Muslim.

451
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:50,769
I'm so proud of being a Muslim!

452
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,989
Let's run into the water.

453
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,309
Run into the water.

454
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,493
Catch the sunset, into the water!

455
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,238
(calm music)

456
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,632
(waves splashing)

457
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,299
For once, Dad, I wish
I could just sleep in

458
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,653
and not be here so early.

459
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,353
The early bird gets the worm.

460
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,779
That is so fifth grade.

461
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,479
You know, if I want a
worm, I'll just take it.

462
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Any time of day.

463
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,680
You're like a big bird.

464
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:04,576
(Bob sighs)

465
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,809
You cannot call an 18 year
old student a raghead, Bob.

466
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,339
I was just showing her an example

467
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,679
of why people say what they
say when she wears that thing.

468
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,206
It's called a hijab.

469
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:28,499
I don't care what it's called!

470
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Sit down.

471
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Sit.

472
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,469
Look, you and I both know

473
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,289
that bullying is a serious
problem in schools.

474
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,119
Ours included.

475
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,279
Teen suicide is real.

476
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,733
Now the last thing I need
is a teacher who's a bully.

477
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,800
The fact of the matter is,

478
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:54,599
I can't tell her to take that thing off.

479
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Yes, you can.

480
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,403
They brought down our towers.

481
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,073
Bob, Maryam Ali is a little girl.

482
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,999
She didn't bring down the towers.

483
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,263
Extremists did.

484
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,680
There's a big difference.

485
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,273
Hijab.

486
00:22:17,274 --> 00:22:19,319
Not a rag or a towel.

487
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,949
First off, I don't wanna bomb the school.

488
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,969
This thing on my head
is not a rag or a towel.

489
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,009
This is called a hijab.

490
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,809
It does not just apply to clothes,

491
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:34,409
but it is a state of mind,
behavior, and lifestyle.

492
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,039
It celebrates a desirable
quality called haya,

493
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,809
which means modesty.

494
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,989
We wear it so people can
see us for our personality

495
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,643
and not by the way we look.

496
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,410
I have testimony I'd like to
share with you by Nadir Osman.

497
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:52,769
"I actually started to wear it

498
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,449
when I was about six years old

499
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,789
and that was a terrible
time to start wearing it

500
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,939
because that's when 9-11 happened.

501
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,119
It was the first time I'd
ever heard the word terrorist.

502
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,179
I was like, 'Mom, I was
called a terrorist today

503
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,799
by another student.

504
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,479
What does that mean?'"

505
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,799
This innocent girl thought

506
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,479
that she was embracing her culture

507
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,089
when actually she was being
perceived as a terrorist

508
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,699
due to a group of men that use religion

509
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,829
as an excuse for violence.

510
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,499
Maryam, this was an
assignment on terrorism,

511
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,703
not personal wardrobe.

512
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,799
Oxford defines terrorism as
the systematic use of terror,

513
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,929
especially as a means of coercion.

514
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,049
Terror is defined as the
state of intense fear.

515
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,689
So when someone of any color bullies me

516
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,143
for wearing my hijab, that is terrorism.

517
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,069
[Reporter] We have a breaking story.

518
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,959
[Reporter] There has been
some sort of explosion.

519
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,791
We don't fully know the details as of yet.

520
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,756
[Reporter] A plane that hit-

521
00:23:54,757 --> 00:23:56,716
- [Reporter] Apparently,
a plane has just crashed-

522
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:58,205
- [Reporter] Then there
was a loud explosion-

523
00:23:58,206 --> 00:24:02,623
- [Reporter] In New York
City just a few moments ago.

524
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:06,651
(explosions booming)

525
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,542
(intense music)

526
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:04,746
(calm music)

527
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:07,580
(waves splashing)

528
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,529
[Maryam] I love the ocean.

529
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:27,303
Waves are wild and
restless, sometimes angry.

530
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Are you angry?

531
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,173
What's the point of being angry?

532
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:40,293
Well, I like to come here and yell.

533
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,529
So no one can hear you?

534
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,530
Exactly.

535
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:47,429
(Zack yells)

536
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,839
Come on, try, try, try.

537
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,008
Like actually.

538
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:51,779
(Zack yells)

539
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,273
It feels good, come on, let it all out.

540
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:57,805
(Maryam yells)

541
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,096
(Zack yells)

542
00:26:00,097 --> 00:26:01,536
Oh god, that feels really good.

543
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:02,633
- Doesn't it?
- Yeah.

544
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,009
Don't take my picture.

545
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,389
Why?

546
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,859
You're beautiful.

547
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,910
You know that, right?

548
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,879
Can I see you with your hair down?

549
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Someday.

550
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,743
I'm cool with someday.

551
00:26:30,698 --> 00:26:32,849
Where were you born?

552
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,850
Pakistan.

553
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,193
My mom was Persian, my dad's Pakistani.

554
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:47,093
Okay.

555
00:26:47,382 --> 00:26:48,479
Okay?

556
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,980
My dad says that when he
doesn't know what to say.

557
00:26:52,284 --> 00:26:54,239
Well, I've never had a real conversation

558
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,133
with a girl outside of Hermosa Beach.

559
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,433
So, I know how boring that sounds.

560
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,770
Do you like school?

561
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,259
Well, I need Bs or
higher to get into Cal U.

562
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,479
So I just gotta maintain that average.

563
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,889
They don't just hand out scholarships

564
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,739
to great baseball players, so.

565
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,340
So you're saying you're great.

566
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,707
I don't like compliments.

567
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:23,369
I don't like boys who don't
know how to take compliments.

568
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,993
Okay, give me more, please.

569
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:36,406
(Maryam sighs)

570
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:38,740
What are you thinking about?

571
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,230
My mother.

572
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,273
She died in a terrorist attack.

573
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:54,990
(Maryam sighs)

574
00:28:04,547 --> 00:28:07,199
I remember that day, unfortunately.

575
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,779
It was a beautiful beach day.

576
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,319
My mother was telling me
why she named me Maryam.

577
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,019
Maryam means passing through the ocean

578
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,483
or bitterness of the ocean.

579
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,490
Bitterness?

580
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,366
But the ocean's so beautiful.

581
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,289
(laughs) Passing through
the ocean will lead you

582
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,329
to the pearl of the ocean.

583
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,369
There's pearls in the ocean?

584
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,159
Yes, and you are one of them.

585
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,160
You are special pearl, my
beloved star of the sea.

586
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:38,879
And I have a surprise for you.

587
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,720
For me?

588
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
Yes.

589
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:44,790
(gentle music)

590
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,733
It's beautiful, just like you.

591
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,350
Thank you.

592
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:56,193
I love you, Mama.

593
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
I love you.

594
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,229
Okay, we're late.

595
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,230
We have to go.

596
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,030
Wait, Mama?

597
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,673
I want to be just like you when I grow up.

598
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,753
No, you wanna be just like you.

599
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,819
We rushed to the mosque

600
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,706
and took our shoes off
before going inside.

601
00:29:26,707 --> 00:29:29,009
"I forgot my necklace," I said.

602
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,629
My mother wanted to go back with me.

603
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,109
I said, "Mama, I'm a big
girl, I can go by myself."

604
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,886
She smiled as I ran off.

605
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:38,249
"Maryam, your shoes!"

606
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,393
She went inside.

607
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,210
That was the last time I saw her.

608
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:44,729
I heard a loud explosion.

609
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,779
Mama, Mama?

610
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,349
I looked back and saw a cloud of smoke.

611
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,449
People were screaming.

612
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,309
Then silence.

613
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,573
I couldn't hear anything.

614
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,183
I couldn't hear anything.

615
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,662
(gentle music)

616
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,530
Where were you?

617
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,530
Beach.

618
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,669
Told you I don't want
you hanging around her.

619
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,959
She has a name, Dad.

620
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
It's Maryam.

621
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,563
I like her.

622
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:11,099
She's not like everyone else, you know?

623
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,449
Exactly.

624
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,450
She's a Muslim.

625
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,649
I got nothing against 'em,

626
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,299
I just don't want 'em
hanging around my son.

627
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,549
Do you know what casual
or unconscious racism is?

628
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,069
I don't need an education on racism.

629
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,213
I'm not a racist.

630
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,729
So ingrained in people,

631
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,049
they don't even know they're doing it.

632
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,609
Doing what?

633
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,859
Maryam is not an extremist.

634
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,509
There's a big difference.

635
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,579
And hey, we got KKK, right?

636
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,139
They hate Jews and blacks.

637
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,329
Should we hate them or forgive them?

638
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,559
That's different.

639
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,789
Why?

640
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,139
Because they're white people?

641
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,879
Hate is hate.

642
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,079
And Maryam is a strong,
intelligent, caring person.

643
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,389
And if anyone should
be angry or defensive,

644
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,413
it should be her.

645
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,779
Because she's the minority

646
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,583
up against the struggle every day.

647
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,969
Somehow she's the one who shows me

648
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,390
that people are just people

649
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,009
despite what they wear or
the color of their skin.

650
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:09,794
She uses reason instead
of violence and ignorance.

651
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:13,786
I'm just saying, why can't
you date a nice white girl?

652
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:14,787
That is so racist.

653
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,743
You can't let what happened
to Mom make you like that.

654
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,240
Don't you talk about her.

655
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,967
You don't even know.

656
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:37,935
I'm sorry.

657
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:38,936
I'm sorry.

658
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:41,644
I didn't mean, I didn't mean to say that.

659
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:42,645
I'm sorry.

660
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:45,655
Here.

661
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:46,972
What?

662
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:47,973
Here.

663
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,699
What's this?

664
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,989
You're going to California University

665
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,540
on a full baseball scholarship.

666
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,719
You opened it?

667
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Sorry.

668
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,790
You opened it.

669
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,450
Zack.

670
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:16,533
Zack.

671
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:23,228
(bat smacking)

672
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:37,467
(bat clatters)

673
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:48,000
(waves rushing)

674
00:34:30,723 --> 00:34:33,473
(glass clinking)

675
00:34:34,435 --> 00:34:35,268
Hey.

676
00:34:35,268 --> 00:34:36,268
Hey.

677
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:40,274
So this is Fesenjan and this is Tahdig.

678
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:42,495
Fesenjan and Tahdig?

679
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:44,542
Let me serve you some of this.

680
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:47,099
So the Tahdig is the crispy rice.

681
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,419
It's the best part.

682
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,420
All right.

683
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,717
This is the Fesenjan.

684
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:56,823
[Zack] Fesenjan.

685
00:34:56,824 --> 00:34:57,780
It's the best chicken piece.

686
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,780
Yummy.

687
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,589
This is how you eat it.

688
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,449
Just take the spoon.

689
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,249
Boom, you don't need a knife.

690
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,869
So easy.

691
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,970
Like that?

692
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:13,124
[Maryam] Yeah, just go like this.

693
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:13,958
And what's that?

694
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:15,989
Noon, or naan.

695
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,863
It's bread, try it.

696
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,929
It's like Pakistani pita or something?

697
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:22,953
Yeah, it's like pita
in Pakistan, India, Iran.

698
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,900
Wow, that's...

699
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,890
Do you, do you like it?

700
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:33,479
Yeah, it's interesting.

701
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,029
You know, I've never had
anything like it before.

702
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,529
You don't like it.

703
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,639
No, it was great.

704
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,799
I can make hamburgers, I can make pasta.

705
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,884
There's some on the shelf.

706
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:42,885
No.

707
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:44,875
See?

708
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,949
So this is kind of weird.

709
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,820
What?

710
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:01,683
It's like a first date.

711
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,150
I guess.

712
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:09,959
(Zack sighs)

713
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,110
So...

714
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,809
Nicole still pissed about
you stealing her room?

715
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,963
Nicole hasn't been around much.

716
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,259
Do you think it's because of me?

717
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,309
No, no.

718
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,479
That's just Nicky.

719
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,249
She's always out and about, you know?

720
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,210
I don't think I ever told you,

721
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:32,819
but we actually kind of grew up together.

722
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,653
Yeah?

723
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:34,679
She used to come over all the time

724
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,929
and we'd stay up all
night playing video games,

725
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,569
watching stupid movies and stuff.

726
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,149
She was like the cool
older sister I never had.

727
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,659
So your dad and Principal
White are best friends?

728
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,979
Yeah, I guess Bill is
my dad's only friend.

729
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
Pretty sad.

730
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,190
Yeah.

731
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,433
He's made a lot of stupid decisions.

732
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,630
Know if my mom was still around, she...

733
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Your mom?

734
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,420
You know, that...

735
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:15,933
That speech, that speech
you did was great.

736
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,803
Thanks, I worked really hard on it.

737
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:22,541
It showed.

738
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:24,299
Students were actually
interested for once.

739
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,939
I hope your dad will like me now.

740
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,649
Yeah, I hope so.

741
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,439
I really don't know why
the way I look bothers him.

742
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,779
Just ignore everything he says.

743
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,780
That's what I do.

744
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,580
I don't know.

745
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,736
What do you mean you don't know?

746
00:37:46,737 --> 00:37:49,053
Are you just dating
me to make your dad mad?

747
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,019
Why would you say that?

748
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,969
It's just a question.

749
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:54,970
Stupid one.

750
00:37:56,502 --> 00:37:57,502
Okay.

751
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:00,688
Okay.

752
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:03,227
What your dad says when he
doesn't know what to say, right?

753
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:04,161
Okay.

754
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:05,568
(Maryam laughs)

755
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:06,569
Yeah?

756
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,899
So where's our next date gonna be?

757
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,733
Oh.

758
00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:12,119
Roller skating?

759
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,953
Bowling.

760
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:13,786
I really wanna go bowling,

761
00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:15,521
please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

762
00:38:15,522 --> 00:38:16,649
I'm a pretty good bowler, so.

763
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,600
You're not gonna get any compliments.

764
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,173
It's fine, I don't need 'em.

765
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,033
Maybe we should just skip all
the bullshit and get married.

766
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,780
You're crazy, you know that?

767
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,433
Love makes people crazy.

768
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,179
And I'm voting for you
for homecoming queen.

769
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,719
Stop, Zack, that's so embarrassing!

770
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,553
It's too late.

771
00:38:49,554 --> 00:38:50,909
Be embarrassed, whatever.

772
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,310
You're gonna win, I know it.

773
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:56,609
(sighs) Homecoming queen.

774
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,760
Could you imagine?

775
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:07,055
(calm music)

776
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:14,949
[Bill] Good morning, Bob.

777
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,883
Bill.

778
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:17,669
I think the bell already rang.

779
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,139
Might wanna get to class.

780
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,140
It did.

781
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,030
Cheers.

782
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,109
You good?

783
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,110
Oh, I'm good.

784
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,379
[Students] I pledge
allegiance to the flag

785
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,049
of the United States of America

786
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:37,199
and to the Republic for which it stands,

787
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,829
one nation under God, indivisible,

788
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,829
with liberty and justice for all.

789
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,449
Do you have any plans this weekend or?

790
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,399
I'm free this weekend
if you wanna hang out.

791
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,629
Yeah, I think I'm gonna hang out

792
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,639
with some of my older friends.

793
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,049
Oh, I have a couple of older friends.

794
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,639
Some college kids, you know?

795
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,119
My parents might not be,
we can watch a movie or...

796
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,079
(clears throat)

797
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Oh, hello.

798
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,030
Boys.

799
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,173
Do you know the definition of assault?

800
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,449
An act either criminal or tortious

801
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,249
that threatens physical harm to a person,

802
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,083
whether or not actual harm is done.

803
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,000
So you know better.

804
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,919
You tore the new girl's head scarf off.

805
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,020
It's called a hijab.

806
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,790
I learned about that in class.

807
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,659
Okay, I'm sorry I messed her hair up.

808
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,710
I'm suspending you.

809
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,820
What?

810
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
What about Amber?

811
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,630
Who told on me?

812
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:44,879
Do you enjoy being mean?

813
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
Excuse me?

814
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,367
Go home and think about what you did.

815
00:41:50,368 --> 00:41:51,599
I know what I did.

816
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,099
Oh, and you're also out of the running

817
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,269
for homecoming court.

818
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,769
What?

819
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,179
No, no, you can't do that.

820
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,589
It's my senior year.

821
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,939
Well, maybe you should
have thought about that

822
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,583
before you shoved an
innocent girl into a locker.

823
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,003
Why is Maryam even here anyway?

824
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,243
Pack up your locker now and go home.

825
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,423
Your suspension starts today, Ms. Smith.

826
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:23,286
(Scarlet sighs)

827
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,883
I've come to collect my paper.

828
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,689
A D?

829
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:00,719
This paper was way better than a D.

830
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
I didn't think so.

831
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,679
What, do you think 'cause
you're diverse and different,

832
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,089
teachers are just gonna give you grades?

833
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,279
No, I study, I prepare.

834
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,443
I'm always overprepared.

835
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
I have work to do.

836
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,133
So this isn't about grades.

837
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:31,619
(student gasps)

838
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,620
I'm sorry.

839
00:43:45,493 --> 00:43:48,809
I have never in my entire
school life got a grade below B

840
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,369
and I don't intend to start now

841
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,559
because a certain teacher has a problem

842
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,219
with the color of my
skin and the hat I wear.

843
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,993
Please address this.

844
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,899
I'm sorry for not knocking.

845
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,920
That was very rude.

846
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:36,693
I forgot my bag.

847
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,620
Do you believe in God?

848
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,179
Why wouldn't I?

849
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,979
Do you believe those
murderers that flew those planes

850
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,749
into the Twin Towers believed in God?

851
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,389
Those Arabs do not represent who I am.

852
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,290
With all due respect,

853
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,419
I think it would help to let the past go.

854
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,679
People jumping from windows

855
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,223
'cause that was a better
way to die than burning up.

856
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,669
This was an intentional
act on American soil.

857
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,369
Makes it personal, one
year ago or 50 years ago,

858
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,624
don't you think?

859
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:10,859
I do think.

860
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,179
I can imagine.

861
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,829
Oh, you can imagine?

862
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:14,663
Listen, Maryam,

863
00:45:14,664 --> 00:45:18,119
I'm not interested in
letting 9-11, 2001 go ever.

864
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,529
Not going to be one of those Americans

865
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,749
that walks around feeling
sorry for himself,

866
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,133
but I will live on guard.

867
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,543
I choose to live for today and tomorrow.

868
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,839
Muslims aren't gonna stop being Muslims

869
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,449
and Christians aren't gonna
stop being Christians.

870
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,279
You and me, with all our differences,

871
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,713
is it possible that we
can just work together?

872
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,813
Stay away from my son.

873
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,059
You know what, I love your son.

874
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,110
No, you don't.

875
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,669
Yes, I do.

876
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:48,503
Do you really think

877
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:51,449
a university's gonna judge
his athleticism differently

878
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,850
if they find out that
he's dating a Muslim girl?

879
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,599
What do you know about losing someone?

880
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,999
You're white, Mr. America.

881
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,029
I know everything about losing someone.

882
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,133
I lost my wife on 9-11.

883
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,483
I lost my mom to a Muslim extremist.

884
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:20,814
I know firsthand, as do you.

885
00:46:21,584 --> 00:46:24,167
(gentle music)

886
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:43,072
(Maryam speaking in foreign language)

887
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:00,350
May God give us peace, happiness.

888
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,409
(slow music)

889
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,659
Oh my God.

890
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,760
Aren't you that senior that got suspended?

891
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,789
Scarlet, right?

892
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,309
You won homecoming like every year.

893
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,509
What is this?

894
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,243
The Muslim, Maryam,
was added to the court.

895
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,879
Says who?

896
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,263
Says this flyer.

897
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,909
Okay, what is happening?

898
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:18,149
First she comes here and then
she takes away my homecoming?

899
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:21,179
Took away your homecoming
by assaulting Maryam.

900
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,230
Oh, so it was you who told on me, Zack.

901
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,439
What does it matter?

902
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,729
Still did it.

903
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,393
Should we tell Maryam about
what happened last summer?

904
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,193
It happened once.

905
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:32,193
We were drunk.

906
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:33,923
What does it matter?

907
00:50:33,923 --> 00:50:34,923
We still did it.

908
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:38,159
Okay.

909
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,479
Why are you even here?

910
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,209
Tell me why I was the
only one who was suspended

911
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,609
and now I have no homecoming.

912
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,049
Jesus, get over yourself.

913
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,939
You won the last three years.

914
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,949
Why does no one get this?

915
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,019
This is my senior year!

916
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,329
It's her senior year too.

917
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:56,819
She deserves it way more than you do.

918
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,007
You know what, Zack?

919
00:50:58,008 --> 00:51:01,229
You are the only one who wants
to get inside Maryam's pants.

920
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:03,269
I don't understand why you're dating her.

921
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,020
You could have anyone in the
school and you choose her?

922
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,020
Why?

923
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,169
You know what, Scarlet?

924
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:13,259
Maybe if you were nice
to one person, just one,

925
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,209
maybe someone would like you for you.

926
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,309
Instead, you're a sad,
hopeless, little mean girl

927
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:20,189
throwing all your
insecurities at everyone else.

928
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,079
You don't like Nicole because she's gay.

929
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,179
You don't like Maryam
because she's a raghead.

930
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,953
And now me because I'm dating her?

931
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,373
Is there anything you like about yourself?

932
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,729
First week of school and it's already old.

933
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:36,730
The hot bully.

934
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,123
So cliche.

935
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,810
Have fun being suspended.

936
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,863
Screw you, Zack.

937
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,769
Have fun committing social suicide

938
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,989
by dating your new loser girlfriend.

939
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,763
You can have the dirty Muslim!

940
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:55,594
(Scarlet groans)

941
00:52:00,728 --> 00:52:03,311
(bat smacking)

942
00:52:25,326 --> 00:52:26,759
I just wanna apologize
for opening up your letter.

943
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,760
I'm sorry.

944
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:30,820
It's just a piece of paper.

945
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,073
Zack, it's a scholarship.

946
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,630
I haven't verbally accepted.

947
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,860
Why wouldn't you?

948
00:52:42,918 --> 00:52:43,751
You know, on Christmas,

949
00:52:43,752 --> 00:52:45,059
remind me to open up all your presents.

950
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,709
Okay, I get it, Zack.

951
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,483
I'm sorry, I messed up.

952
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,629
I've already apologized.

953
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,630
I'm sorry.

954
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:54,590
So what do you want?

955
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,199
Well, she stopped by my classroom.

956
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,969
Why are you talking to Maryam?

957
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,570
I just want you to be careful.

958
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,540
Why?

959
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,790
Well, for one, she
told me she loves you.

960
00:53:10,868 --> 00:53:13,049
I don't believe she'd tell you that.

961
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,550
She probably didn't mean it.

962
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,699
What's that supposed to mean?

963
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,559
It means you're young, Zack.

964
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,179
You both are young.

965
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,739
You met this girl a week ago.

966
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,670
Her name's Maryam.

967
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:27,089
Maryam, you met Maryam like a week ago.

968
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,039
It's a full ride, Zack.

969
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,809
It's a full scholarship.

970
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:31,833
Can't you see that?

971
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,079
And you're gonna throw it all away

972
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,680
'cause you think you're in love?

973
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,750
You wanna talk to me about love?

974
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,870
Do you know you have never
once told me that you love me?

975
00:53:51,803 --> 00:53:54,389
(sighs) Zack, let me help you at least.

976
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,433
Just don't.

977
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,973
Stay away from me.

978
00:54:03,522 --> 00:54:05,939
(slow music)

979
00:55:08,213 --> 00:55:09,732
Hi.

980
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:12,299
I don't care what he says,
I'm not going to college.

981
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,300
Why?

982
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,550
Because that's what he wants.

983
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,340
I'm sure he has some good in him.

984
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,503
Maybe before my mom
died, I wouldn't know.

985
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,799
I know, he told me.

986
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,600
Why wouldn't you tell me that
after all that I told you?

987
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:34,769
I never even met her.

988
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,093
I was barely a year old.

989
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,373
She went on a business trip
to New York, never came home.

990
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,999
You know, I used to hear
my dad crying all night

991
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,853
from my room, talking to my mom.

992
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,169
Sometimes, I'd really think she was there

993
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,263
in the room with him.

994
00:55:55,243 --> 00:55:56,522
'Cause I wanted to.

995
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:58,803
Give me some false hope
we could be a family.

996
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,523
Every morning after I'd wake up,

997
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,370
he'd be sitting in front of the TV,

998
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,809
empty beer cans everywhere,

999
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:12,839
screaming the most disgusting
shit about ragheads

1000
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,153
and God knows what.

1001
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,259
But after a while,

1002
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,263
his screaming stopped
sounding like screaming.

1003
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,913
All I could hear was him crying for help.

1004
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:33,423
I tried to help him.

1005
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:36,263
I thought I should

1006
00:56:36,264 --> 00:56:39,010
because he'd lost the most
important person in his life.

1007
00:56:41,295 --> 00:56:43,673
He never once thought that
maybe I needed help too.

1008
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,713
Maybe I was important too.

1009
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,723
He never gave me the chance to be a son.

1010
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,820
I never got the chance to have a mother.

1011
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:02,300
I know it sounds stupid, I...

1012
00:57:05,977 --> 00:57:08,773
I just feel like a boy
who never got to be a boy.

1013
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:14,943
I've never seen a boy in you.

1014
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:40,463
Here, Zack.

1015
00:57:40,464 --> 00:57:42,479
Stop, please.

1016
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,313
Zack, please.

1017
00:57:43,314 --> 00:57:44,609
I'm leaving.

1018
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,139
Come on, can't we just talk?

1019
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,740
There's nothing to talk about.

1020
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:49,870
[Bob] Here.

1021
00:57:51,475 --> 00:57:52,573
At least take this with you.

1022
00:57:52,574 --> 00:57:53,789
No, I don't want it.

1023
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:54,790
Let's go.

1024
00:58:08,662 --> 00:58:10,589
(knocking)

1025
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:11,590
Got a minute?

1026
00:58:16,824 --> 00:58:19,289
I need a place to stay.

1027
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,690
Well, where's your father?

1028
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,069
Sure.

1029
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,379
Maybe we can invite the entire school.

1030
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,403
Make it a sleepover.

1031
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,900
That's a joke.

1032
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,223
You sleep on the couch.

1033
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,060
I understand.

1034
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,319
I've known your dad my whole life.

1035
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,911
I've got this.

1036
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:47,495
(bat smacking)

1037
00:58:52,643 --> 00:58:55,226
(Bob grunting)

1038
00:59:04,024 --> 00:59:06,441
(calm music)

1039
00:59:12,238 --> 00:59:15,071
(waves splashing)

1040
00:59:17,449 --> 00:59:20,116
(birds calling)

1041
01:00:09,556 --> 01:00:12,627
Amber's helping Eddie for
your homecoming campaign.

1042
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:14,765
Amber, "throw me to the locker" Amber?

1043
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:15,766
Yes.

1044
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:19,233
Maybe it's her way of saying sorry.

1045
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,180
Okay.

1046
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,290
You know I don't care about homecoming.

1047
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,117
(Maryam laughs)

1048
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:42,509
You know it's happening
whether you like it or not.

1049
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,510
Stop.

1050
01:00:53,713 --> 01:00:54,930
Vote for Maryam.

1051
01:00:54,931 --> 01:00:55,764
And Eddie.

1052
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:56,999
Yeah, and Eddie.

1053
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,529
Eddie, I'm not gonna vote for you.

1054
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,530
It's gonna be the best homecoming yet.

1055
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,269
So stoked, it's gonna be awesome.

1056
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:04,920
Hey, excuse me, vote for Eddie.

1057
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,120
Thanks for your vote.

1058
01:01:08,185 --> 01:01:10,602
(calm music)

1059
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:28,630
Any left?

1060
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,899
Hey, I handed out all the flyers.

1061
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,050
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1062
01:01:48,193 --> 01:01:50,340
You know, I'm really
glad that you're here.

1063
01:01:50,341 --> 01:01:51,210
And I'm sorry about detention.

1064
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,210
It sucks.

1065
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:55,263
Well, I deserved it.

1066
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,863
Maryam didn't do anything
but wear a hijab.

1067
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,969
And people are afraid of
what they don't understand.

1068
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:04,503
I guess, yeah.

1069
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:08,039
Sorry about you and Scarlet.

1070
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,463
Yeah, we've been friends a long time.

1071
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,239
It's just, I'm done being a follower.

1072
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,703
I never wanted to be a bully.

1073
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,059
It's just every time I was
with her, I would follow along,

1074
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:26,060
and then afterwards I
would really feel not good.

1075
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,919
I just don't get mean people.

1076
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,439
Like, it takes so much energy.

1077
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,883
Why not just be nice?

1078
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:35,163
You know?
Yeah.

1079
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,740
You blocked me, Amber?

1080
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:04,830
I texted you like 10 times.

1081
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,220
Whatever.

1082
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:10,950
Here to get my stuff

1083
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:13,349
because apparently I'm the
only bad guy in all of this.

1084
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:15,303
I got detention, Scarlet,

1085
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,729
and I'm fine with it.

1086
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:18,690
Oh yeah?

1087
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:21,813
Well, I got suspended
and I'm not fine with it.

1088
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,219
You're helping Maryam now?

1089
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,220
I asked her to.

1090
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,519
This is a lot of work.

1091
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,139
First day of school,

1092
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,473
I lied through my teeth when
I said I'd vote for you.

1093
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,073
You are not good enough to stand by me.

1094
01:03:45,812 --> 01:03:47,312
What are you doing, Scarlet?

1095
01:03:49,043 --> 01:03:51,626
(can rattling)

1096
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,552
Come on, man, don't
take pictures of that.

1097
01:03:55,553 --> 01:03:58,720
(students chattering)

1098
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,593
Get these students to class.

1099
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:31,870
Bill!

1100
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,010
Who did this?

1101
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:41,339
Scarlet, this is too far.

1102
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,340
Shut up, Zack.

1103
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,989
There are a lot of cruel
people in this world

1104
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:49,833
who will do far worse things
than slam you into a locker.

1105
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,133
Consider yourself lucky.

1106
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,150
Happy homecoming.

1107
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,037
(slow music)

1108
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,489
I'm sorry.

1109
01:05:12,378 --> 01:05:14,338
It'll be okay.

1110
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:15,172
Just stop, don't.

1111
01:05:15,173 --> 01:05:16,953
No, no, let me go, Zack!

1112
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:22,088
What?

1113
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:23,780
What, you think this is funny?

1114
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,689
You all just stood around
and let this happen?

1115
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,073
You watched her do this?

1116
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:32,369
Eddie.

1117
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:34,220
There was nothing we could do, man.

1118
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:38,879
Amber?

1119
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,880
Grace.

1120
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,933
Zack, what's going on?

1121
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:49,909
You see this?

1122
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:50,760
You know about this?

1123
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,760
No.

1124
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,253
You're all guilty.

1125
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:02,848
- All right, guys.
- Who did this, who did this?

1126
01:06:02,849 --> 01:06:05,894
Everyone, go back to class right now.

1127
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:09,062
(students chattering)

1128
01:06:11,961 --> 01:06:14,378
(slow music)

1129
01:06:29,212 --> 01:06:32,045
(Scarlet panting)

1130
01:06:33,321 --> 01:06:35,120
Why did you do it?

1131
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:37,240
Why did you do it?

1132
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:38,241
Why?

1133
01:06:40,132 --> 01:06:41,639
No words?

1134
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,079
You had plenty to say the other day

1135
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,880
when you tore the hijab off my head.

1136
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,213
Say something!

1137
01:06:51,469 --> 01:06:52,649
Say something!

1138
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,650
Say something.

1139
01:06:58,684 --> 01:07:01,351
(Maryam crying)

1140
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:08,219
When I was a kid, I used
to love playing outside.

1141
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,483
It was my happy place.

1142
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,703
I loved breathing in the fresh air,

1143
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:19,203
pretending I was in some imaginary world.

1144
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,323
Just a barefoot kid running around,

1145
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:27,490
free as a bird.

1146
01:07:31,012 --> 01:07:32,012
It was beautiful.

1147
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:41,613
My parents were too busy
fighting inside to notice.

1148
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,553
Mom would cry.

1149
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,253
Dad would hit her.

1150
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:51,033
So she left.

1151
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,280
I remember one day, I...

1152
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,603
I chased this butterfly
into my neighbor's yard.

1153
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:08,463
He was selling lemonade.

1154
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:11,350
Alone.

1155
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:16,349
He asked me where my parents were

1156
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:21,033
and I told him that they
were inside fighting.

1157
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,243
He invited me in his house
to cool off, so I did.

1158
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:37,053
After he gave me some lemonade,

1159
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:44,579
he said that he could tell
my eyes were irritated

1160
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,599
from the swimming pool

1161
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,073
and he offered me these eyedrops
to help with the redness.

1162
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,520
I agreed.

1163
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,050
Felt nice to be taken care of like that.

1164
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,120
But the second he dropped them in,

1165
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,877
my eyes started to burn
and the room went black

1166
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,993
and I could feel his
hands moving up my legs.

1167
01:09:27,483 --> 01:09:28,483
And then,

1168
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:38,630
I felt his disgusting mouth

1169
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:45,183
in a place it did not belong.

1170
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:00,200
After it was all over, he
told me not to tell anyone.

1171
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:05,300
And for some reason I didn't.

1172
01:10:13,232 --> 01:10:17,065
The man still lives
across the street from me.

1173
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,203
Just the other day, I
saw him selling lemonade.

1174
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:34,383
And you were scared to speak up.

1175
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:38,883
He destroyed me.

1176
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,569
He molested your body.

1177
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,283
He cannot molest your soul.

1178
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,479
I want to kill him.

1179
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,480
You can't do that.

1180
01:10:51,395 --> 01:10:52,889
Why not?

1181
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:53,890
He killed me.

1182
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,600
I have to go.

1183
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:03,310
You should leave.

1184
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:15,208
(calm music)

1185
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,360
Dad!

1186
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:36,773
It's Zack's.

1187
01:11:36,774 --> 01:11:38,549
I told him he could stay here for a while

1188
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:40,019
until he and Bob work things out.

1189
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:41,369
I told him you wouldn't mind sleeping

1190
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:42,569
on the couch downstairs.

1191
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,279
I do mind, he can sleep on the couch.

1192
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,629
He's too big, honey.

1193
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,189
His feet will hang off the end.

1194
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:48,599
First Maryam and now Zack,

1195
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,463
you're helping everyone else but me.

1196
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,729
I found this in your room.

1197
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:54,630
You went through my room?

1198
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:57,209
That's my stuff, that's my personal stuff!

1199
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:58,379
Why didn't you tell me?

1200
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,149
Because it isn't true.

1201
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,559
Bill, stop.

1202
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,560
Let her talk.

1203
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:07,439
I'm gay, Mom.

1204
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,109
Why didn't either of you tell me?

1205
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:11,410
I didn't wanna hurt you.

1206
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:14,129
What do you expect from us?

1207
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,659
Bill.

1208
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,403
It's in the Bible.

1209
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:20,073
It's an abomination.

1210
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:23,279
It's a disease.

1211
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,349
Funny, that's what the police said.

1212
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:29,230
Honey, I think what your
father is trying to say is

1213
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,209
we can hate the act, but
still love the person.

1214
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:34,833
Act, I'm not a circus clown.

1215
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,322
Look, it's just a part
of what makes me up.

1216
01:12:38,323 --> 01:12:40,109
I don't have a choice.

1217
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:41,969
Yes, you do.

1218
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:44,099
God gives you a choice.

1219
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,800
I can be a Christian and be gay.

1220
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,510
Not in this household.

1221
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,350
Nicole!

1222
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:00,423
My daughter is not a disease.

1223
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:50,279
What's up, man?

1224
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,530
Nothing, man, I'm good.

1225
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:01,330
You're good?

1226
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:08,103
Bro, you've been acting off lately, okay?

1227
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,163
We've all noticed.

1228
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,789
You're the captain of our team.

1229
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:15,790
Our team.

1230
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:17,879
We need you, man.

1231
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,909
Yeah, I know, man, I'm sorry, okay?

1232
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:23,489
Just a lot going on right now, you know?

1233
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:24,490
Yeah, I know.

1234
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:28,613
I just don't know how much
more of this I can handle.

1235
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,659
It's your dad, huh?

1236
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:36,719
Yeah, I just can't get
away from him for a second.

1237
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,720
You know, school, baseball, years of it.

1238
01:14:39,567 --> 01:14:40,863
And now Maryam.

1239
01:14:50,038 --> 01:14:53,205
You know, I never even liked baseball?

1240
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,639
What do you mean you
never liked baseball?

1241
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,405
Well, my dad loves it.

1242
01:14:58,406 --> 01:14:59,400
You know, he played it in college

1243
01:14:59,401 --> 01:15:01,079
and tried out for the Dodgers

1244
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,172
and thought I could be
something like that.

1245
01:15:03,173 --> 01:15:04,979
What do you, hold on, hold on.

1246
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,029
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1247
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:08,129
Your dad tried out with the Dodgers?

1248
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:08,963
Yeah, man.

1249
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:09,796
That's insane.

1250
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:10,799
He didn't make it, you know.

1251
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,549
That's like my dream,
to play with the Dodgers.

1252
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:15,480
Do you know what that means?

1253
01:15:15,481 --> 01:15:17,459
That's insane.

1254
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:18,293
Yeah.

1255
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:19,510
Well, that's my problem, man.

1256
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:21,870
It's not my dream.

1257
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:26,193
I'd rather be on some beach in
a shack, just playing guitar.

1258
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:29,159
You play guitar?

1259
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,599
No.

1260
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,400
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't think so.

1261
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:36,050
Well, I mean, you could learn.

1262
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:38,669
Yeah.

1263
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:39,670
Guess I could.

1264
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:42,633
Well, hey, listen.

1265
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,209
I know your dad doesn't
like the whole Maryam thing.

1266
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,043
Yeah.

1267
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:53,459
But just know it's cool, okay?

1268
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:54,839
She's cool.

1269
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,840
And I got your back.

1270
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,379
Thanks, man, I really appreciate it.

1271
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:59,939
Yeah.

1272
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,040
You guys make out yet?

1273
01:16:02,276 --> 01:16:03,596
- No.
- Oh!

1274
01:16:03,597 --> 01:16:06,209
And now he's back, there he is.

1275
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,099
With a smile and everything.

1276
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,389
So I caught you.

1277
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:10,409
Yes.
Yeah, all right.

1278
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:11,340
Finally.

1279
01:16:11,341 --> 01:16:12,719
Now stop crying.

1280
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,327
Let's get some lunch.

1281
01:16:14,328 --> 01:16:15,728
- Okay, okay.
- All right, let's go.

1282
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:19,150
Wasn't crying.

1283
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,010
No, I saw you crying.

1284
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:26,200
(knocking)

1285
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,309
Can I stay in Zack's room?

1286
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:30,462
Why not?

1287
01:16:30,463 --> 01:16:31,463
Just like old times.

1288
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,139
Really, the whole bottle?

1289
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,909
Parents don't care, why should I?

1290
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:37,079
It's bad for your liver.

1291
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,419
So is walking in front of a car.

1292
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,470
Give me the bottle.

1293
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:43,450
Give it.

1294
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,133
Let's go for a walk.

1295
01:16:48,088 --> 01:16:50,073
God.

1296
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,513
So what happened?

1297
01:16:55,593 --> 01:16:58,176
(gentle music)

1298
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,991
[Nicole] You ever feel like an alien?

1299
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,760
I feel like an alien all the time.

1300
01:17:16,899 --> 01:17:19,379
You really hate Maryam, huh?

1301
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,380
No.

1302
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,220
Called her a raghead.

1303
01:17:26,339 --> 01:17:27,749
I did.

1304
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:29,369
I'm sorry.

1305
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:30,370
Don't tell me.

1306
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:35,860
Bob.

1307
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,283
You know what I see when I look at Maryam?

1308
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:43,653
An explosion of color and life.

1309
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:46,830
She's like a beautiful flower.

1310
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:51,293
If you don't wanna see beauty
in a flower, you won't.

1311
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:57,320
But I see what's on the inside,
specks of green and yellow,

1312
01:18:00,499 --> 01:18:02,832
washes of blues and purples.

1313
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:10,533
It's an explosion of life.

1314
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,593
Can't help but stare.

1315
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:20,010
So beautiful, it makes you wanna like cry.

1316
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,340
I don't ever feel like a beautiful flower.

1317
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:28,930
Not allowed to.

1318
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,523
I'm more like a cactus.

1319
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:37,623
It's cool to look at, but
you don't want to touch it.

1320
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:43,529
Did you tell Maryam this?

1321
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:45,580
She doesn't like me the way I like her.

1322
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:50,343
You tell your parents you like girls?

1323
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,340
I tried.

1324
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,040
Try harder.

1325
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:01,829
Straight white male is
gonna tell me to try harder

1326
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:04,380
in coming out to my
conservative Christian parents?

1327
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:07,990
Yeah.

1328
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,670
It's okay to be a little different.

1329
01:19:17,049 --> 01:19:19,493
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

1330
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:21,573
I do have a heart.

1331
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,089
If you could accept me all these years,

1332
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:26,103
why can't you accept Zack and Maryam?

1333
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:31,079
Guess I give everybody else advice,

1334
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,613
just can't take it for myself.

1335
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:35,920
Try harder.

1336
01:19:39,089 --> 01:19:41,756
(clicks tongue)

1337
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,977
Can I help you?

1338
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:13,593
I'm Scarlet Smith.

1339
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:17,729
Hi.

1340
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:18,930
You don't remember me?

1341
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:22,109
Yeah, I think I know you.

1342
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,460
I live across the street.

1343
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:25,830
Right.

1344
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:26,663
Right, yeah.

1345
01:20:26,663 --> 01:20:27,630
Hi, Scarlet.

1346
01:20:27,631 --> 01:20:29,639
I've grown up now, haven't I?

1347
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:30,857
Yeah, I'd...

1348
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:34,169
I'd offer you some lemonade, but...

1349
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:35,320
Why did you touch me?

1350
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:37,860
I don't think I did that.

1351
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:40,660
Yes, you did.

1352
01:20:43,767 --> 01:20:46,100
(gun fires)

1353
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:11,373
My name is Scarlet.

1354
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:15,453
I just started my senior
year at Hermosa Beach High.

1355
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:19,773
I am the most pretty.

1356
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,823
I am the most popular.

1357
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,363
I never wanted any of this.

1358
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:33,033
I just wanted someone to talk to.

1359
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:38,312
(gentle music)

1360
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,199
Mr. Bill.

1361
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,273
Mr. Principal Bill.

1362
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:26,099
I'm sorry for ripping the
new girl's headscarf off.

1363
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:30,479
No, I'm sorry for ripping
Maryam's hijab off.

1364
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,378
I know I was wrong and I'm here-

1365
01:22:32,379 --> 01:22:33,429
- What are you doing?

1366
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:36,239
Practicing an apology.

1367
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,089
Well, the bell just rang
and we're gonna be late.

1368
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:40,090
I'm just...

1369
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,959
I'm nervous, okay?

1370
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:43,793
I've gotta go in there

1371
01:22:43,794 --> 01:22:45,449
and talk to Principal Bill about all this.

1372
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:48,704
Well, Principal White
is not gonna come to you.

1373
01:22:48,705 --> 01:22:49,905
(laughs) You're right.

1374
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,280
I'm just scared.

1375
01:22:53,281 --> 01:22:56,163
You know, I've never
apologized for anything.

1376
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:59,126
I'll go with you.

1377
01:22:59,127 --> 01:23:00,719
You will?

1378
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,720
Mm-hm.

1379
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:05,410
I'm sorry.

1380
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,559
Don't worry.

1381
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,939
We're good.

1382
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,565
Let's go.

1383
01:23:10,566 --> 01:23:13,233
(sighs) Okay.

1384
01:23:14,686 --> 01:23:17,269
(gentle music)

1385
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,637
I have something for you.

1386
01:23:21,638 --> 01:23:22,638
What?

1387
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:25,259
What is it?

1388
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:26,943
It's a pearl from the ocean.

1389
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:29,549
There are pearls in the ocean?

1390
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,550
Lots.

1391
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,560
Come on, let's go.

1392
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,116
Close your eyes.

1393
01:23:47,117 --> 01:23:50,634
(students chattering)

1394
01:23:50,635 --> 01:23:52,559
An elephant or a zebra.

1395
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,423
But think about, let's
put the tree, one stem.

1396
01:23:57,489 --> 01:24:00,179
Like don't think about dirt.

1397
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:01,649
It's an even, it's an equal race.

1398
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:02,520
Hey, guys.

1399
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,520
Hey, everyone.

1400
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:11,579
I just wanted to say that I'm really sorry

1401
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:16,580
for everything I've done and
I'm here to make things right.

1402
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,859
But of course I realize my
reputation can't just change

1403
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:23,693
in one day.

1404
01:24:23,693 --> 01:24:24,693
So...

1405
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,330
Can I, can I help you guys with anything?

1406
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:32,973
I'd love to contribute.

1407
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:37,430
These need stapling.

1408
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,199
Okay, thanks, Grace.

1409
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,033
Bring it in.

1410
01:24:41,033 --> 01:24:42,033
Okay.

1411
01:24:45,387 --> 01:24:48,089
[Student] So we were saying by the...

1412
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:49,619
What did you say to her?

1413
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:50,789
Nothing.

1414
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:52,049
I listened.

1415
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:54,119
[Student] It's called
literature, dumb-ass.

1416
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,469
Oh my gosh.

1417
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:57,239
See, getting cheated.

1418
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,490
Everyone's, everyone's
always throwing shade.

1419
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,519
Yeah, you can't go wrong.

1420
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,813
I'm becoming more Zen.

1421
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,270
Yeah, I found this.

1422
01:25:08,532 --> 01:25:09,615
Okay, cool.

1423
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,420
Your mother was a strong woman.

1424
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:20,290
Stubborn.

1425
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:23,080
Which made her even more beautiful,

1426
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:27,940
'cause she was usually right.

1427
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:32,010
She used to wear her hair in this ponytail

1428
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:35,393
'cause it got in the way of her gardening.

1429
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:40,510
She would plant this
little seed into the ground

1430
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,003
and it would turn into
this like thing of colors.

1431
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,490
I'm not a flower kind of guy.

1432
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:56,913
Death is supposed to get
easier, dealing with it.

1433
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,670
People tell you "Just let it go."

1434
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:04,900
I can't.

1435
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,240
It's hard.

1436
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,893
So I take it out on you.

1437
01:26:19,993 --> 01:26:21,753
I wish I could just let things go.

1438
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:28,833
You lost your wife, your love,

1439
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,773
but I lost a mother.

1440
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:34,530
You think I sleep easy?

1441
01:26:34,531 --> 01:26:36,269
You think I just put that away?

1442
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:37,420
'Cause I never met her?

1443
01:26:40,859 --> 01:26:42,233
You don't think it hurts me too?

1444
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:47,980
I'm sorry.

1445
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:56,343
You're stuck in my own selfish pain.

1446
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:01,413
She was my flower.

1447
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:05,643
Love needs water.

1448
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,569
I guess the bucket just dried up.

1449
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:11,670
Bob the racist is getting all sensitive.

1450
01:27:13,009 --> 01:27:14,259
(laughs) It's pathetic.

1451
01:27:22,611 --> 01:27:24,278
I just want a dad.

1452
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:27,320
I just want a son.

1453
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:35,658
You punched me in the face.

1454
01:27:35,659 --> 01:27:37,742
(laughs)

1455
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:40,899
I know.

1456
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:42,730
Felt pretty good.

1457
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,293
Yeah, I bet it did.
