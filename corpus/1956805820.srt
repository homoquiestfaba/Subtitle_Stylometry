1
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:25,445
Hey.

2
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:30,973
Would you like breakfast?

3
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,827
Mmm, no, thank you.

4
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,893
I'll make flapjacks.

5
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:45,738
No, you have to go.

6
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:47,120
And I have to go get Amber.

7
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,420
She spent the night at
Elizabeth's last night.

8
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:53,653
Oh, stay in bed with me.

9
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,093
It's official.

10
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,287
There's six more weeks of winter.

11
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,553
Juanita.

12
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:30,430
Look, I know that the other
kids tease you

13
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,450
almost to the point of bullying.

14
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,070
You have to talk to me
when these things happen

15
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,563
so that we can get to the
bottom of it together.

16
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,610
And you have to remember

17
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,253
non-confrontational conflict resolution.

18
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,120
'Cause nothing ever comes from violence

19
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,460
and you know we can solve
problems with our words, right?

20
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,293
Right.

21
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:53,663
Sometimes, Miss Eva, all they
ever understand is suffering.

22
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,000
Go back to class.

23
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,143
And we are gonna pick this
back on Monday.

24
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,583
And don't be a lazy daisy.

25
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:14,120
May I have a moment of your time?

26
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,460
Yes, Miss Anthony, please, of course.

27
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,210
This is just a followup
courtesy call.

28
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,720
What is it?

29
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,480
The student you turned over
to us, Margaret Johnson.

30
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,700
Yes, I remember her.

31
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,480
She was turned over for
domestic abuse.

32
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,430
While Mr. Johnson was in our custody,

33
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,223
Mrs. Johnson bludgeoned
Margaret to death.

34
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,123
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,930
You did do the right thing by
calling us.

36
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,723
We just can't catch every criminal.

37
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,383
I'm so proud of you.

38
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,290
I know this is your last
concert before graduation.

39
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,400
Aren't you excited?

40
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,813
I'm so excited for Stanford, Mom.

41
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:57,980
I know.

42
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,110
Is Peggy coming tonight?

43
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,600
No, she had to work.

44
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,350
But I promise, I'll show her
the tape from the concert.

45
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,870
And oh, you wore it.

46
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,120
Yes, Mom,
I told you I was going to.

47
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,370
But just so you know,
just because you got me

48
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,350
a pre-birthday present does
not mean

49
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,670
that you can't get me another
present on the day of.

50
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,843
Well, I did get you a real
present on your birthday.

51
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,103
But you will have to brush
up on your French a bit.

52
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,110
Wait, what?

53
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,880
You're going to France, my dear.

54
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,011
Shut up.
Yes!

55
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:37,027
What?

56
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:38,178
Oh my God, Mom!

57
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:39,020
Oh my God.
The elbow, Amber,

58
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,496
I'm driving.
Sorry, sorry.

59
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:41,329
Oh my God.

60
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,873
I'm so excited!

61
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:46,120
France, France, France,

62
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,451
France, France, France, France.

63
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,992
You're taking real good care
of yourself

64
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:06,825
so I should take you out

65
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,200
and show you off to my friends.

66
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,470
We have a good time.
Mom.

67
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,520
Excuse me.

68
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,060
Get away from the car.

69
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,760
Okay, well,
you two ladies have a good night.

70
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,710
Mom, where were you?

71
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,291
Amber, why didn't you just
roll up the window?

72
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,370
Because you have the keys

73
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,210
and they're electric windows.

74
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,323
Talk about stranger danger.

75
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,713
Hold on.

76
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,480
Mom.

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,344
What is wrong with you?

78
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,683
Okay, here we go.

79
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,593
Nothing but a little happy.

80
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,470
Can you believe it was my last one?

81
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,379
I know, I don't wanna,

82
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:55,212
oh no, no, no, no.
Isn't that weird?

83
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:56,852
Yeah, I know that's weird.
♪ I'm old ♪

84
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:58,220
♪ I'm getting older ♪

85
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,370
Uh, yeah, right.

86
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,470
Okay.
Oh well,

87
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,390
I appreciate you coming.

88
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,761
I just wanted to tell you that.

89
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,650
So I'll see you inside
'cause you take forever.

90
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,660
Can you wait?

91
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,190
No, I have to go

92
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,157
practice my French.

93
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:12,686
I'm so excited.
Yes, you do.

94
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:17,086
Okay.

95
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:32,204
Amber!

96
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,250
Here, just take what you want.

97
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,780
Please leave us.

98
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,190
Please just leave us alone.

99
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,290
Baby, I'm gonna take what I want.

100
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,410
Oh God.

101
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,380
Please don't touch me.

102
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,023
What, you don't wanna dance?

103
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:57,840
Gentlemen.

104
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,673
Captain.

105
00:07:58,673 --> 00:07:59,740
What do we have?

106
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,230
We have a female,
approximately 16 to 18, no ID.

107
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,940
She was discovered about three
hours ago.

108
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,450
She had been redressed but
missing a shoe.

109
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,640
I have two appointments on my
schedule this morning,

110
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,440
one with the mayor's office
and one with the news media.

111
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,880
I know what I'm gonna tell
the news,

112
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,603
but what am I gonna tell the mayor?

113
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,330
Well, this victim

114
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,913
has the same MO as a
girl we found earlier.

115
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,900
We think we may have a
serial killer working.

116
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,430
Gentlemen, the doors to my office

117
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,700
will swing wide on this one.

118
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,810
I'll give you all the help
you need.

119
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,563
And, uh, welcome back.

120
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,130
Detective Grind.

121
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,830
Can I have a moment of your
time, alone?

122
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,840
I'll go talk to the doctor.

123
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,672
I'll be back, sweetheart.

124
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,280
Dr. Kurtz says that you're capable

125
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,490
of having a discussion and
I'm investigating your case.

126
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,423
Are you up to talking about it?

127
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,603
I'd like to ask you about
that night,

128
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:32,723
what you can remember,

129
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,253
do you recall the incident.

130
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,990
Uh well, I remember walking.

131
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:45,690
That's it.

132
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,940
That's the last memory
I have of my daughter.

133
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:51,733
You're being released.

134
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,333
Is that true, I can go?

135
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,810
Yes, I'm working on your
discharge papers as we speak.

136
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,540
The important thing is to relax,
control your stress.

137
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540
Thank you, Doctor.

138
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,040
Do you mind if I continue the conversation

139
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,110
while you're being processed?

140
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,250
Detective, please,
I don't know what else

141
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,460
I can tell you.

142
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,640
And whatever it is I can tell you,

143
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,214
it's not gonna bring my
daughter back.

144
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,530
I understand that.

145
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,030
But it is best that you tell me

146
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,863
everything you can
I just wanna

147
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,703
go home.
while it's fresh.

148
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,850
I just wanna go home.

149
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:30,052
Thank you.

150
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,910
Think she'll ever remember anything?

151
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,550
Right now it's a combination
of the brain trauma

152
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,140
and her emotional state.

153
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,660
Brain injury may heal in time,

154
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,550
but the emotional state,
even with counseling,

155
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,230
could take quite a bit longer.

156
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,370
Only time will tell.

157
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,042
It may come back to her in a flash.

158
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:54,250
And she took

159
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,440
this big cello

160
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,919
out of the closet.

161
00:10:57,982 --> 00:11:02,241
It was so big,
I had to prop it up

162
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:06,500
against the wall for her
so she wouldn't fall.

163
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:30,547
She was just

164
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:35,547
little miss rolly-polly thing.

165
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,580
She was just so round.

166
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:41,025
I thought I would just...

167
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,800
I love you.

168
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,480
I'm sorry, I just, I just,

169
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,438
I just have to deal with this
by myself.

170
00:11:58,438 --> 00:11:59,975
Please.

171
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,729
No!

172
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:20,646
No, no, no!

173
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:23,959
Oh.

174
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,494
Not fair, not fair, not fair!

175
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:46,074
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:48,811
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

177
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:51,631
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,110
Well, the first thing on my
mind in the morning is Amber

179
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,100
and the last thing before I
go to bed,

180
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,600
usually aided by a pill.

181
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,897
What kind of pill?

182
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:11,900
I don't know,
just something to make me sleep.

183
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,470
When I'm awake,
I can feel myself breathe, Doctor,

184
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,003
but I don't feel alive.

185
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,530
And then I walk outside
and everybody's doing

186
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,430
the exact same thing

187
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,740
over and over again every day.

188
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,130
Nothing changes,
the world doesn't stop.

189
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,043
All I know is that Amber's dead.

190
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,233
And that I wish it was me.

191
00:13:35,938 --> 00:13:40,930
You're the principal of an
all-girls school.

192
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,623
Look at the potential within
your control.

193
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,050
What good could have come
from you dying with Amber?

194
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,840
Well, maybe I wouldn't
have to walk around

195
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,440
feeling like a corpse,
now would I?

196
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,370
We need to look for ways

197
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,293
to help you find peace again.

198
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,210
Restore hope within yourself.

199
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,778
Hope?

200
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:07,678
Doctor.

201
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,233
My hope died with my daughter.

202
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,700
Just tell me something.

203
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,943
What kind of mother can't
protect her child?

204
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,243
Look, Eva,

205
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,920
you know, I have patients

206
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,040
that have done tremendously well

207
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,420
from writing a journal,
keeping track

208
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,720
of their thoughts and emotions.

209
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,070
Perhaps it'll help you

210
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,460
in recalling your attack.

211
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,220
We can review your journal
together and I can help you

212
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,960
work out the issues.

213
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,793
Consider it.

214
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:50,780
Fine, if you think it'll help alleviate

215
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,480
some of this pain.

216
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,650
Good.

217
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,130
I'm gonna write you a prescription

218
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,200
that'll help you..
Lemme guess.

219
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,890
To help me relax and not stress.

220
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,723
Yes.

221
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,790
That's exactly what I was
gonna say.

222
00:16:12,897 --> 00:16:17,027
"Mom, let me just start by
saying I love you

223
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:20,147
"and please don't be mad.

224
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:23,457
"I won't lie and say I'm
holding it for someone else.

225
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:25,467
"It is mine.

226
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:29,297
"I only smoke because it
helps me relax my mind

227
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:31,247
"and concentrate on my music.

228
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:33,187
"So when you ask me about it,

229
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:35,117
"and I'm sure you will,

230
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:37,057
"please don't be mad.

231
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:38,293
"Try to understand.

232
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:42,506
"I am sorry I didn't tell
you before you found this.

233
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,277
"Love, your favorite person
in the whole world."

234
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,417
I forgive you, baby.

235
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:56,794
I forgive you, I forgive you.

236
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,522
I forgive you.

237
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:09,014
I forgive you.

238
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,280
I do, I do.

239
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:14,364
I do.

240
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:40,888
And whatever it is I can tell you

241
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:43,321
it's not gonna bring my
daughter back.

242
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:26,210
You did do the right
thing by calling us.

243
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,676
Sometimes all they ever
understand is suffering.

244
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,830
Ow, son of a bitch.

245
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,350
I wanna close my account.

246
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,230
Sure, this one?

247
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,550
You can start with Amber's
college fund.

248
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,970
I'll wait.

249
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,880
Hi, how can I help you?

250
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,160
Hi, do you have physical training

251
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,000
of any kind against an opponent?

252
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,620
Uh yeah, we actually have
tons of classes you can take.

253
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,470
Kick boxing's really good for
your cardio

254
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,303
and keeping you lean.

255
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:29,310
No, sweetheart, I mean actual fighting

256
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,888
where my knuckles bleed.

257
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:07,269
Choke, choke him!

258
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,233
Hey, sugar tits.

259
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,930
What's shakin' that brings
out the bacon

260
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,730
on this fine evening?

261
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,540
Apparently a conversation

262
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,150
is being had about your handiwork.

263
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,960
Well, it's a dirty job but
somebody's gotta do it.

264
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,210
Come take a walk with me.

265
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,540
Are you insane?

266
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,470
There could be AMBER Alerts
out already.

267
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,640
Picked her up before work.

268
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,250
I met my quota so she's your
problem now.

269
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,780
Just make sure Allah drops the
truck back after he's done.

270
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,230
You have a good day, darlin'.

271
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:45,950
Soccer mom.

272
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,200
I betcha five bucks she
buys something cheap.

273
00:22:49,772 --> 00:22:51,344
Let me have a crack at her, man.

274
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:52,177
Go get her.

275
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:53,010
All right.

276
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,543
Welcome.

277
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:56,376
Can I help you?

278
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:00,178
I want that kind.

279
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,083
That's how you can tell the
kids are off to college.

280
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,500
The soccer mom cars are always
the first to get traded in.

281
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,286
I know what I want.

282
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:12,040
Right.
Something pre-computer age.

283
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,100
Pre-computer?

284
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,933
That one.

285
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,261
That one?

286
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:50,450
So what's the verdict?

287
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,880
Rose, step out.

288
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,030
The men are gonna talk.

289
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,790
Sit down.

290
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,273
Before you utter a single word,

291
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,580
know this, that if that word

292
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,890
is not the most brilliant thing

293
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,723
that's ever come out

294
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:21,183
of that stupid monkey mouth
of yours,

295
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,433
do not speak.

296
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,210
Jakey, Jakey, big mistakey.

297
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,975
You know how I feel about
answering questions, Bit.

298
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:47,615
You bring me attention I do
not want.

299
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,793
Dispose of the bodies like I taught.

300
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,980
Allah says you got another girl.

301
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,473
Good boy, go earn.

302
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,110
And don't call Rose sugar tits.

303
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,343
It hurts her feelings.

304
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,433
Hey, you wanna come home and fuck?

305
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,153
That would be fantastic.

306
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,113
I like it as rough as the
next girl.

307
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,310
But if you want me,
you're gonna have to take me

308
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,143
like a man.

309
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:04,303
Help.

310
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:08,391
Fuck!

311
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,493
So there we were locked in an
epic battle.

312
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,060
No we weren't.

313
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,683
You got knocked out.

314
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,080
And I thought you were gonna
be tough.

315
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,450
You know,
you hear stories about people

316
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,550
who were raped and murdered

317
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,033
and we just take it as facts, statistics,

318
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,385
things to be measured by.

319
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,283
I call this truth because
when I smoke it I can't lie.

320
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,945
And I smoke a lot.

321
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,513
See now, peace you would
think would be easy.

322
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,780
You would think using words

323
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,370
such as non-confrontational
conflict resolution

324
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,796
would be easy.

325
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:16,815
You're crazy.

326
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,540
No, you chose someone that
couldn't defend themselves

327
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,410
and you chose violence.

328
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,233
Violence begets violence.

329
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,023
So here is the untold story.

330
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,373
Those who think they escape justice.

331
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,750
Now, in all fairness,
the police do reserve the right

332
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,223
to first capture.

333
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:59,130
But what if there is no capture?

334
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,638
The criminal is completely free.

335
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,230
And in that freedom,
you have three options.

336
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,740
One, turn yourself

337
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,610
into the authorities,

338
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,280
confess and throw yourself
at the mercy of the court.

339
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,773
Two, kill yourself.

340
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,683
Or three, me.

341
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,530
And how unfortunate it is
that I found you first.

342
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,840
In a few moments, I have a feeling

343
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,480
you're going to have wanted
to choose

344
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,313
one of the other two options.

345
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:41,463
Just please don't hurt me anymore.

346
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:47,830
Shh, shh, shh, sh, shh.

347
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,997
Mommy.

348
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:51,959
Here, just take what you want.

349
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,700
Just please leave us.

350
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,290
Please just leave us alone.

351
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,123
Baby, I'm gonna take

352
00:29:56,123 --> 00:29:57,265
what I want.

353
00:29:57,265 --> 00:29:58,360
Oh God.

354
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,370
Please don't touch me.

355
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,652
What, you don't wanna dance?

356
00:30:00,652 --> 00:30:01,590
You don't wanna dance?

357
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,023
I think your exact words were..

358
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:07,836
Most times I like it when
a bitch begs...

359
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:08,946
But this ain't one of 'em.

360
00:30:08,946 --> 00:30:09,959
I agree!

361
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:58,800
When it comes to violence in society,

362
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,840
it works from the top down.

363
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,413
Only the strong survive.

364
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,280
Survival of the fittest and
all that.

365
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,233
So in here,

366
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,075
I am the top and you are the bottom.

367
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,010
Oh, and the shock collar is
set to zap

368
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,410
at anything above a whisper.

369
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,833
So feel free to scream.

370
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,700
You are about to learn the meaning

371
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,170
of don't fuck with my child.

372
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:35,730
You have information and you
will tell me

373
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,500
because you are going
to tell me every moment

374
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,683
of your life.

375
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,793
Where we start is up to you.

376
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,650
Just let me know when we get
to the part

377
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,033
about my daughter.

378
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,323
No, I haven't seen or heard
from him.

379
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,197
Neither have I.

380
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:12,210
I want you to tell our guest
that tonight

381
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,860
we have a brand new girl for him.

382
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,593
Tell him it's on the house.

383
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,420
Why on the house?

384
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,533
Make him pay.

385
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,913
No, I would rather keep the peace.

386
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,640
We couldn't deliver what he wanted

387
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,780
so we're gonna give them this
one for free.

388
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,200
He's a repeat customer, Rose.

389
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,103
But don't worry,
we'll get him on the next one.

390
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,553
Go!

391
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,180
Your room is ready.

392
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,163
Sounds wonderful.

393
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,880
Consider this one a gift.

394
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,980
What's the occasion?

395
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,910
The news media lately.

396
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,303
Don't worry,
I have everything under control.

397
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,123
Smile.

398
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,263
Some news, messenger.

399
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,973
Jake's trailer burned
to the ground, arson.

400
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,970
I'll leave it to you to pass
the message on.

401
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:38,230
Come on.

402
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,920
I don't know who your daughter was.

403
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,697
There were that many girls?

404
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:50,930
Well, I guess you'll learn
which girl was mine

405
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:51,763
as we proceed.

406
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,630
Call me when you're done.

407
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,533
Sure.

408
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,160
You can tell me as little

409
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,223
or as much information as you like.

410
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,063
How the process works.

411
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,733
All the details.

412
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,203
I will stop.

413
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,523
But only when I'm satisfied
with your answers.

414
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,040
Until then,

415
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,096
I'm gonna proceed

416
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,473
and assume that you like what
I'm doing.

417
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:15,626
You?

418
00:35:24,158 --> 00:35:25,287
So.

419
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,260
I tried the hot sauce

420
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,520
but it was just too hot for me.

421
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,773
It burned my tongue.

422
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,483
Please, I'll tell you everything,
I'm begging you.

423
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:55,847
You see, I just don't believe you.

424
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,520
But there is a way to guarantee

425
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,240
that you will tell me the truth.

426
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,280
Oh, yes you will.

427
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,980
You seem like the type that
works best under pressure.

428
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,559
Let's get serious.

429
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,900
Welcome to my reality.

430
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,130
I am the safety for a child.

431
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:02,930
Let them call out my name
and I will answer them.

432
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,380
I will answer.

433
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,033
I will save every child everywhere.

434
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,770
Purposely hurting a child?

435
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,997
That is unacceptable!

436
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,840
I am gonna fix it.

437
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,070
Suffering?

438
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,210
No, no, no, no, no, no.

439
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,500
No child should ever

440
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,597
have to suffer.

441
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:31,386
What kind of god would allow that?

442
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,703
I'll be back

443
00:37:37,703 --> 00:37:39,167
for the blonde, you understand?

444
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,433
Bitch, what the fuck you want,

445
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:10,723
what the fuck you want?

446
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:15,723
You!

447
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,780
Girls, any other bad guys in here?

448
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,270
No, just him.

449
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,690
I think he's waiting on Allah
to come back

450
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,954
with another girl like yesterday.

451
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,640
Reality, is it not

452
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,570
what we create?

453
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,263
My own earthbound heaven and hell?

454
00:38:47,854 --> 00:38:52,854
♪ I am a thunderous roar ♪

455
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:57,418
♪ That my enemies shall quiver before ♪

456
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:08,745
Coward!

457
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:16,780
I am the wrath and the sword
that shall smite down the evil.

458
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,123
I am the judgment that waits
for them upon my throne.

459
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,480
In the 17th chapter of Luke
it is written.

460
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,063
The kingdom of God is within
all men.

461
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,140
Not just one man nor a group
of men

462
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,673
but all men.

463
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,623
It is time for man to adjust.

464
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,440
I'm sorry, Eva, we're out of time.

465
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,200
I'm gonna recommend a group
counseling session.

466
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,980
This'll connect you with
other people

467
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,020
that have lost children to
violent crimes.

468
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,398
I believe this'll help you cope.

469
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:53,630
Shh.

470
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,530
Huddled masses of parents
who've lost children to evil?

471
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,833
Where are they?

472
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,070
Go to the police and tell them
what happened

473
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,820
with the men who took you.

474
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,490
And under no circumstances are
you to tell them about me.

475
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,493
You understand?

476
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,060
No matter what they say,
don't tell them what I look like,

477
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,880
what I drive, what I did, nothing.

478
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,630
Just tell them that you walked out.

479
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:27,610
We won't tell them anything.

480
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,323
Do you promise?

481
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,783
Get out!

482
00:40:33,326 --> 00:40:34,159
Oh man.

483
00:40:35,186 --> 00:40:36,019
And part of the imprints

484
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,060
have the A in his...

485
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,980
Thanks, Sara.

486
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,830
You're welcome.

487
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,300
How you doing, Sara?

488
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,535
Bite me.

489
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,047
She's just kidding.

490
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:53,090
Did we ever get any samples
back from that devil

491
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,250
in the pimp's building.

492
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,170
Yeah.

493
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,780
But everything either came
back negative

494
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,140
and/or relative to the
room and/or building.

495
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,670
There were no unmatched fibers

496
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,420
to the victims or the surroundings.

497
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,800
Yeah well, those zip ties,
they weren't part

498
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,440
of the structure or personal effect

499
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,575
of the two that were wearing them.

500
00:41:10,575 --> 00:41:11,640
That's not what I meant, pal.

501
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,270
I know what you meant,
but I'm just saying,

502
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,240
there's a connection between
the Captain here

503
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,580
and those two downtown.

504
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,413
The Captain?

505
00:41:20,315 --> 00:41:22,640
No one's seen Jake,

506
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,223
his home's torched.

507
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,273
Now TT and Allah are dead.

508
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,930
What's the word on the
street about that car?

509
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,193
My guy on the inside
is running the plate.

510
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,523
Everyone on the street is scared.

511
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:41,870
What do you mean?

512
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,820
The people we associate
with are either disappearing

513
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,313
or ending up dead.

514
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,193
You know, I'm starting

515
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:49,870
to take this kinda personally.

516
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,833
Our supply line has been severed.

517
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,000
Relax, Rose.

518
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,163
It's only one line.

519
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,380
We will have to go back
to Donovan for awhile

520
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,033
until we replace TT and Allah.

521
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,600
You know maybe,

522
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,993
maybe, maybe it was payback
for the Captain.

523
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,053
What you mean?

524
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:13,520
Maybe it was a cop.

525
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,510
I mean, maybe the cop knew
who killed the Captain

526
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,510
and decided to enact his
own version of vengeance.

527
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:25,960
No, no, cops don't do vengeance.

528
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,290
That's a civilian thing.

529
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,370
I call bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit on that, pal.

530
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,730
Cops do do vengeance.

531
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,360
What, you saying that it was
a cop

532
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,050
killing out of vengeance?

533
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:36,883
Not necessarily.

534
00:42:36,883 --> 00:42:39,180
No it's, no man,
it's not a cop thing,

535
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,040
it's a human thing.

536
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,340
What I'm saying is,
and you know this is true,

537
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,710
you fuck with a cop's family,

538
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,000
you fuck with a cop's friends,

539
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,057
pow, he will pop you, some will.

540
00:42:49,057 --> 00:42:49,890
And we still have

541
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:52,830
that contract with the
Russians and the Saudis.

542
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,870
Hey, I'm not giving them up.

543
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,900
They're too lucrative.

544
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,250
The Russians?

545
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,370
Do you really think it's wise

546
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,183
to cut off the Russians, Rose?

547
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,638
In Mother Russia,
they cut you off.

548
00:43:40,273 --> 00:43:41,106
I'm done.

549
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,343
Come here.

550
00:43:53,984 --> 00:43:55,067
Get in there.

551
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:05,963
Come on, we're gonna be late.

552
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,160
Alfred Rossi 1969.

553
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,390
A big case.
Woody, Woody,

554
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,480
this is a human thing.

555
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,960
Ain't no cop on duty or
off duty gonna pop no thug

556
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,840
and risk everything.

557
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,783
I mean, I don't care if
he's a friend or not.

558
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:25,833
Well, certainly not me or you.

559
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,313
So how's your vacation, partner?

560
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,025
That was a clean shot.

561
00:44:36,025 --> 00:44:37,420
I know.

562
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,730
I was cleared by IA.

563
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,140
I know that, too.
The guy had a gun

564
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:40,973
and you know it.

565
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:42,300
Now, let's get back to the case.

566
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,630
We both know who saved
your ass on that one.

567
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,173
Yeah.

568
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:54,091
And I owe him everything for that.

569
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,163
Good for you.

570
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,870
Let's just track down the zip
tie manufacturing company.

571
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,070
See how readily these
things are available,

572
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,400
what they're typically used for.

573
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,497
Let's just start there, all right?

574
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,100
That's the only link we got.

575
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,933
I'm with ya.

576
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:11,870
I goes, okay.

577
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:12,703
Start there.

578
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,077
Cranky today, ain't ya?

579
00:45:15,077 --> 00:45:16,576
The coffee sucks.

580
00:45:16,576 --> 00:45:17,835
Cranky, I'm busy.

581
00:45:17,835 --> 00:45:18,996
Let's go to Starbucks.

582
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,947
Nap time's over.

583
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,523
Let's continue.

584
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,043
13th and El Monte.

585
00:46:40,943 --> 00:46:42,743
I want you to call Mohammed.

586
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,230
Tell him we'll have a fresh
batch of girls

587
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,130
by mid-August just ready for shipment.

588
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,223
Tell him this time,

589
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,430
they pay the freight

590
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:55,600
and we'll reduce the cost

591
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,993
of each of the girls by 10%.

592
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,943
You are going to lower
the unit price that much?

593
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:12,393
Look, we wanna move more volume,
we have to think bigger.

594
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,470
We try to move them and
the Russians find out,

595
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,713
they'll have our heads.

596
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,440
No, I'd much rather lose 10%
on the upfront unit costs

597
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,813
than the backend security.

598
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:29,160
We lose that, we're sitting ducks.

599
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,840
We're sitting ducks for anyone

600
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,290
who can move in on our state.

601
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,993
But if we..

602
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:35,826
Hang on.

603
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:37,480
Uh, Luke, take the park way,

604
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,313
it'll be faster.

605
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,423
Luke, uh, I said to take the park.

606
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:52,063
Luke, can you roll down the
window all the way please?

607
00:47:56,738 --> 00:47:57,905
Mommy.

608
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,463
Luke, is there a malfunction
with the window?

609
00:48:04,973 --> 00:48:06,365
Oh shit.

610
00:48:06,365 --> 00:48:08,192
What's that smell?

611
00:48:08,192 --> 00:48:09,186
Rose, shut up, get out.

612
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:13,004
Oh my God.

613
00:48:13,004 --> 00:48:16,102
Open this, my God.

614
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:16,935
Oh no!
Oh my God,

615
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,123
Luke, go back.

616
00:48:18,123 --> 00:48:18,956
Open.

617
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,949
No wait!

618
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:23,211
Oh no.

619
00:48:23,211 --> 00:48:25,442
Open!

620
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:28,600
Bill.

621
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,900
I will not cooperate with you.

622
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,660
So let me get this straight.

623
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,960
Even though you acknowledge
that we are only here

624
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,570
to help you,

625
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,931
you still won't cooperate with us?

626
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:27,764
Shut up!

627
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,660
Good grief!

628
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,493
Excuse me.

629
00:49:31,493 --> 00:49:32,326
Yes, ma'am, we get it.

630
00:49:32,326 --> 00:49:33,830
We're not morons.

631
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:37,250
You can only ask the same
questions so many times

632
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,520
before even I think it's
ridiculous, pal.

633
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,353
I mean really.

634
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:41,740
She said no, let's move on.

635
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,560
Jesus Henry Christ.

636
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,610
I want some coffee.

637
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,990
Do you want something to drink?

638
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,550
'Cause you're gonna be
here for a long time.

639
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,280
This pleading the fifth shit

640
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,530
ain't gonna work forever.

641
00:49:57,558 --> 00:49:59,863
One of you will talk.

642
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:02,953
No coffee it is.

643
00:50:07,322 --> 00:50:12,322
I swear, they will let anyone
wear a badge these days.

644
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:15,600
I shouldn't say that.

645
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,493
He's a great cop.

646
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,060
Don't worry, I've got one
token where I work, too.

647
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,100
Thank you, affirmative action.

648
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:23,933
I know, right?

649
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,350
He's good for getting coffee.

650
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,962
If you'll drink after he's
touched it.

651
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:36,900
I never planned on drinking it.

652
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,760
Okay, okay, before he gets back,

653
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,760
let's cut to the chase.

654
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,851
Tell me the, how did they get ya?

655
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:46,273
Julia.

656
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,363
I really only know how it began.

657
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,560
I was walking to the mall to
meet a friend

658
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,010
and my eyes were blinded by
the sun.

659
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,693
This guy came up and he
punched me in the head.

660
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,280
I remember trying to crawl away

661
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,800
and he grabbed me by the legs
and pulled me

662
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,673
into this truck.

663
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,800
The truck was black, that's
all I remember about it.

664
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,700
Okay, then what?

665
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,683
He took me to the place.

666
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,350
Do you know where?

667
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,183
No.

668
00:51:16,183 --> 00:51:18,070
He had blindfolded me.

669
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:21,990
Just black, the kind of black
nightmares are made of.

670
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:24,270
Okay, could you hear things?

671
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:27,030
Planes, trains, automobiles,
anything at all.

672
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,360
No, I was drugged the rest of
the time.

673
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,490
I remember waking up in the hospital.

674
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,020
Okay.

675
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,707
If I need anything else,
I will be in contact with you.

676
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:38,150
You guys better go before it
gets back.

677
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,793
Well, that's it,
they want their lawyer.

678
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,230
We can't hold 'em any longer.

679
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,323
You will talk.

680
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,653
I guarantee it.

681
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,953
Okay, buddy boy, now that
old bitcherella's outta here,

682
00:52:11,953 --> 00:52:13,414
did you get all that?

683
00:52:15,505 --> 00:52:16,338
Oh.

684
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,573
So you had to go there?

685
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,690
I was good, huh?

686
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:21,540
Yeah, I got it.

687
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:26,173
Man, those zip ties are
popping up everywhere.

688
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:27,933
And a male.

689
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,320
That blows my theory of a female
killer right out the water.

690
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,510
Well, you're batting 50%.

691
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,300
That's better than Babe Ruth.

692
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,310
Oh, by the way,
thanks for the coffee.

693
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,460
Any time, brother.

694
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,560
Did they use that raw sugar I like?

695
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,643
Yes, I know how you like your coffee.

696
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,730
Hey, I told her she couldn't use

697
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,429
that pleading the fifth shit
all day, huh?

698
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,321
I love being a cop.

699
00:53:00,108 --> 00:53:02,757
Rose.

700
00:53:02,757 --> 00:53:05,210
It is not a thorn prick.

701
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:08,200
If you are going to be
a beast in the woods,

702
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,453
own the woods.

703
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,830
Do not ask for forgiveness.

704
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,339
It will not come.

705
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,373
Do not ask for death,
it will be denied!

706
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,620
What'd you do to help my daughter?

707
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,872
Did you say stop, this is
wrong, she is but a child?

708
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,240
No, you didn't.
No!

709
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,280
You helped!

710
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,820
You are a woman and you
allowed men

711
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,893
to touch and defile my daughter.

712
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,170
If we cannot stick together
as a species,

713
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,613
then womankind will always
be at the mercy of men.

714
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:53,723
You are worse than these two
low-lives in the worst way.

715
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,230
How dare you

716
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,480
help these cretins,

717
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,173
this shit that walks among us?

718
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,013
Do you really think that
they care for you, Rose?

719
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,383
Well, do you, love?

720
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:24,750
Because if you don't, then you
hurt my daughter for profit.

721
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,280
Whatever your reasoning was

722
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,490
in order to progress your lifestyle,

723
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,525
you chose the wrong child!

724
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:02,163
You didn't even ask me to stop.

725
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,340
You didn't take blame.

726
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,913
You just let me hurt her.

727
00:55:08,421 --> 00:55:10,470
Do you hear that, Rose?

728
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,620
He doesn't even care enough

729
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,173
about you to speak up.

730
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:16,193
Clearly not love.

731
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,710
Well, you all must be hungry

732
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,363
and I'm outta dog food.

733
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:28,423
Oh, that chunky cat food didn't
set well with you, right?

734
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,400
I'll make sure to get more of that.

735
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:35,920
And let's hope nothing happens
to me while I'm out.

736
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,623
Like another trip to
the hospital or death.

737
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,323
I'd hate to think of you
all here dying like this.

738
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,718
I'll be back!

739
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:51,853
Hello, Eva.

740
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:54,230
I got you flowers.

741
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,063
Oh.

742
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:58,333
Oh you got me roses.

743
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,123
Let's go.

744
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,250
Right, these zip ties

745
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,371
are used by the pros in both
construction and SWAT.

746
00:56:09,371 --> 00:56:12,210
Are you sure they confirmed
construction grade?

747
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,320
Uh huh, yeah, they are.

748
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,280
They're heavy duty.

749
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,986
They sell billions of 'em
with a B.

750
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,810
That many?

751
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,461
Well, with the construction
boom market

752
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,850
like they are,
they're selling like hotcakes, pal.

753
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,190
Hey, Woody.

754
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,260
Uh huh.

755
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,127
Hey, keep this bit of information
to yourself, all right?

756
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,970
'Cuz we don't know who did
the Captain.

757
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,960
I hear ya.

758
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,330
We'll get back to this in the morning.

759
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:35,810
Okay, give Desiree my love.

760
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,840
Yeah, yeah, I will.

761
00:57:17,388 --> 00:57:18,535
Are you kidding?

762
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,860
So that was fun, huh?

763
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,613
Mmm hmm, yeah.

764
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:38,909
You like that ice cream?

765
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,600
Yes, thank you.

766
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,550
Do you feel like sharing?

767
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:44,511
No.

768
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,173
Do you ever think about
dying your hair black?

769
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,940
I love you.

770
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:03,090
Thank you for a lovely evening

771
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:04,740
and for being so patient with me.

772
00:58:07,324 --> 00:58:08,531
Can I see you again this week?

773
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:11,030
Sure.

774
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,895
I look forward to it.

775
00:58:12,895 --> 00:58:13,728
Okay.

776
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,143
I want you all to know that
I had a great time out.

777
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,065
I laughed.

778
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,661
I ate.

779
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:49,459
I drank.

780
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:50,292
I sang.

781
00:58:52,636 --> 00:58:54,060
Woo!

782
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,428
I danced.

783
00:58:56,428 --> 00:58:58,723
Oh, I never felt so alive.

784
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:04,677
Happy Mother's Day to me.

785
00:59:07,052 --> 00:59:08,652
There's lots of work to be done.

786
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:10,533
Let's get to it.

787
00:59:12,092 --> 00:59:14,987
Woo, let's have a little fun.

788
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:16,050
Are you ready?

789
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,870
Are you ready to play?

790
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:19,254
Yeah, it's time to play.

791
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:27,899
Come on, come and play.

792
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,820
Answer one question for me.

793
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:45,050
If you do not answer the question,

794
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:48,973
well, Jake here, he's gonna die.

795
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:54,113
What is my daughter's name?

796
00:59:55,395 --> 00:59:56,544
I don't know.

797
00:59:56,544 --> 00:59:59,758
I don't..
What is my daughter's name?

798
01:00:01,737 --> 01:00:03,570
I don't know.

799
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:07,163
You killed a child

800
01:00:07,163 --> 01:00:10,593
and you didn't even know that
child's name?

801
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,403
Oh I, no, wait.

802
01:00:17,258 --> 01:00:19,425
The one her name was Bria.

803
01:00:21,403 --> 01:00:25,994
Ah, wrong!

804
01:00:25,994 --> 01:00:27,827
Emily, Betty.

805
01:00:29,487 --> 01:00:30,638
Jessica?

806
01:00:30,638 --> 01:00:32,452
I now condemn you
Jenny!

807
01:00:32,452 --> 01:00:34,535
to an eternity of hell.

808
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,467
Tell that bastard when you
get there more are coming.

809
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:45,253
Hey, Bill, isn't this how
you strangled my daughter?

810
01:00:48,546 --> 01:00:52,129
Oh no.

811
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,047
Oh no.

812
01:00:57,047 --> 01:00:59,513
My resolve is infinite.

813
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,980
Okay, so here's the deal.

814
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,600
It was at 849 Juniper Street.

815
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,373
That's on the northeast side
of town.

816
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:09,800
Now, you said he was there twice.

817
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,010
Whoa, whoa, what's this?

818
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:13,010
Information addressed to you
from the Captain's desk.

819
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:15,550
We're cleaning out his office.

820
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,690
Cleaning out his office.

821
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:19,093
What is it?

822
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:23,133
It's a working file on the
dead girls.

823
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:25,283
And we're just getting it now.

824
01:01:25,283 --> 01:01:27,410
Here's a photo ID of this guy.

825
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:29,270
Jake Fawthorp.

826
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:33,710
Info on his trailer that
apparently burnt down.

827
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:34,670
Hmm.

828
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,390
Man has no home.

829
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:38,870
I wonder why Cappy didn't
get this to us sooner.

830
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,602
He knew how important this was.

831
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,600
Fawthorp may be on the run, pal.

832
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,060
I'll put out an APB, huh?

833
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,430
Yeah, put on out on that truck, too.

834
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:52,293
All right.

835
01:02:01,553 --> 01:02:04,886
I can't, I can't,
I can't protect her.

836
01:02:07,531 --> 01:02:09,614
I can't, I can't protect.

837
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:13,579
I was a bad parent.

838
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:14,662
I couldn't...

839
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,980
Her body displayed for friends
and family to see

840
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,913
like a sideshow at a carnival.

841
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:33,397
It wasn't my fault.

842
01:02:35,755 --> 01:02:38,825
I was knocked down,
I was knocked down.

843
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:41,100
I couldn't help you.

844
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:43,683
I wonder all the time

845
01:02:45,843 --> 01:02:47,423
was she scared?

846
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,467
Did she call,
did she call my name?

847
01:02:55,467 --> 01:02:56,800
Mommy.

848
01:02:58,331 --> 01:03:03,331
I didn't help.

849
01:03:03,604 --> 01:03:04,521
I couldn't.

850
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,350
You realize that life goes
on right at the moment

851
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,353
when they close the lid on
the casket.

852
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,902
It is final.

853
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,759
I will never see my child again.

854
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:19,783
She's gone.

855
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,420
And you chose her for death.

856
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,010
You decided that!

857
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,160
Do you have any idea

858
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:35,530
what it's like to have a child
kidnapped, raped, murdered,

859
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:36,672
and dumped like trash?

860
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,579
It's a pain that no human
should ever have to endure.

861
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,463
You are the bane of my existence.

862
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,643
Hmm, you know,

863
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:57,440
I didn't want it this way,
but frankly,

864
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,817
I'm sick of looking at you

865
01:04:01,377 --> 01:04:02,427
Who are you?

866
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:05,493
I am a mother.

867
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,133
I, the jury, have found you guilty.

868
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,078
I, the judge,
have sentenced you to death.

869
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,700
And I, the executioner,
will carry out

870
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:23,973
that final punishment.

871
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:28,963
But just remember,
as you leave this world,

872
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,590
this was all your fault.

873
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:36,564
No please, please don't kill me.

874
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,773
Ask and thou shalt receive.

875
01:04:59,696 --> 01:05:01,862
Woo, I'm a lumberjack,

876
01:05:01,862 --> 01:05:03,819
I'm a lumberjack!

877
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:07,028
Felt good to me.

878
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,278
Let's continue.

879
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:13,493
Die, you motherfucking son of
a bitch!

880
01:05:24,237 --> 01:05:25,070
Oh, wow.

881
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,653
Didn't see that happening today.

882
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,673
See, Rose,
non-confrontational resolution.

883
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,263
You asked, you received.

884
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:45,828
Ooh now there is one.

885
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,990
Please, Detective, come in.

886
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,890
Will you sit down?

887
01:06:06,722 --> 01:06:11,200
We believe that we have a suspect

888
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,800
in the murder of your daughter.

889
01:06:15,064 --> 01:06:15,897
Really?

890
01:06:17,244 --> 01:06:18,077
Who?

891
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:22,493
This man.

892
01:06:23,673 --> 01:06:25,740
Do you know him?

893
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:26,573
Nope.

894
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,360
Look, I know this can
be really difficult,

895
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,510
but please will you take a
good look at it?

896
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:39,543
Hey.

897
01:06:39,543 --> 01:06:40,900
Hey.

898
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,000
What are you doing here?

899
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,320
Thought I was seeing you tonight.

900
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,550
Oh, right.

901
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:48,010
You know, I'm sorry, I can't really.

902
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,580
Yes, you can really.

903
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,320
I'm a little busy.

904
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,100
I came all this way to see you.

905
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,680
Don't you love me anymore?

906
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,823
No, no, no, come.

907
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,250
Okay, well,
it looks like you guys need to talk,

908
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,040
so I'm gonna go.

909
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,513
Yes, you should be going.

910
01:07:06,476 --> 01:07:07,659
Okay.

911
01:07:07,659 --> 01:07:10,460
Uh, no, not leaving.

912
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,493
To my bedroom.

913
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,060
Your bedroom?

914
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,993
Yes, my bedroom.
Okay.

915
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:22,230
Detective, you wanted
a moment of my time

916
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:23,540
and as you can see I have plans,

917
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,290
so can we please make it brief?

918
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,810
Now, are you sure you've
never seen this man?

919
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,453
Detective, I can't help you.

920
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:33,090
Has Amber ever mentioned a Jake.

921
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:36,650
I mean could be a boyfriend
or a girlfriend's boyfriend

922
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,247
or local pot dealer.
No.

923
01:07:38,247 --> 01:07:42,003
No, nobody nowhere no how.

924
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:43,803
Nothing.

925
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,370
You mind if I take a look in
Amber's bedroom.

926
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:02,910
Yeah, absolutely not.

927
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:04,010
Not without a warrant.

928
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,393
Eva.

929
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,733
Is that what I need to do,
get a warrant?

930
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:26,700
Detective, you misunderstood me.

931
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,520
See, I've created somewhat
of a shrine in Amber's room.

932
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,633
It's kinda become a sanctuary
for me.

933
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,883
I want no one in that room.

934
01:08:42,123 --> 01:08:43,330
A man was strangled

935
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:45,380
using the same zip ties as
your daughter.

936
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,373
Captain White, my captain.

937
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,230
Do you know Captain White?

938
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:56,160
Or have you had any affiliate,

939
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,000
you mind taking a look
at the picture please?

940
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,097
Or that picture or that picture?

941
01:09:03,137 --> 01:09:05,283
All I know is that he was your boss.

942
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:10,240
And I didn't even know that
until I read it in the papers.

943
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,920
You know, maybe he was a bad guy.

944
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,587
Do you know how to catch a bad guy?

945
01:09:14,587 --> 01:09:16,001
Yes.

946
01:09:16,001 --> 01:09:17,440
Yes, I do.

947
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,823
Call the police.

948
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:22,330
Detective, why do you keep
pushing me for answers

949
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:23,163
that I don't have?

950
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:24,073
Are we done?

951
01:09:31,304 --> 01:09:32,680
Yeah, we're done.

952
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,670
I'll get outta your hair.

953
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,270
I can see you're a wanted woman.

954
01:09:58,258 --> 01:10:00,560
It doesn't have to be this way.

955
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,050
I'm afraid it does.

956
01:10:19,671 --> 01:10:21,945
Car 32 come in.

957
01:10:21,945 --> 01:10:23,173
Yeah, Grind, go ahead.

958
01:10:23,173 --> 01:10:24,440
We have your location

959
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,740
on your suspect's vehicle.

960
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,040
Good, what is it?

961
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,013
Four miles north of Hunker
River Road.

962
01:10:32,514 --> 01:10:35,726
Work, work, work.

963
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,590
I wonder if he knows anybody
in the area

964
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,369
that would give him a ride

965
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,570
or loan him some transportation.

966
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:51,900
Way ahead of you, man.

967
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,810
He has a brother that lives
in town but get this.

968
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,730
I had a black and white
do a question on Bill

969
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:59,470
and no one, not even the
doorman of the building

970
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:02,980
has seen him, his girl,
or his car in days

971
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,554
and days and days.

972
01:11:04,554 --> 01:11:05,410
Really?

973
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:06,243
Yeah.

974
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,090
Put an ABP out on him and his girlfriend.

975
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:12,690
What's her name?

976
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:13,870
Rose Garden.

977
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:14,834
Rose.

978
01:11:14,834 --> 01:11:15,970
Yeah.

979
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:16,803
Rose Garden?

980
01:11:16,803 --> 01:11:18,590
That's her name, yeah.

981
01:11:19,981 --> 01:11:21,180
You're a good man, Wood.

982
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,321
That's what my girlfriend
calls me, good wood.

983
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:27,745
Let's go talk to some people.

984
01:11:27,745 --> 01:11:28,578
Let's.

985
01:11:36,434 --> 01:11:40,230
So I took your advice

986
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,403
and I wrote a journal.

987
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,143
See, you help me get my
message out to the masses.

988
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:51,900
Who says man's laws aren't
meant to be broken?

989
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,530
You can't control everybody's actions.

990
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:56,513
Wrong.

991
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:00,743
God has that power, right?

992
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:03,970
Do you believe you're a god?

993
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,320
I am in my reality.

994
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,060
Just so we're clear here.

995
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:12,380
It's my responsibility as
an officer of the court

996
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:15,480
to inform the police if you're
going to hurt someone.

997
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:19,060
Relax, Doctor, don't stress.

998
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:20,433
It's just a story.

999
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,523
I'm just sharing it with the world.

1000
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:28,823
Now the world will know
my words and who I am.

1001
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,548
Let's start at the beginning,
shall we?

1002
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:33,381
I've told you

1003
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:34,574
everything I know.

1004
01:12:34,574 --> 01:12:35,407
Right.

1005
01:12:35,407 --> 01:12:37,570
We just don't believe you.

1006
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:40,500
Look, if she said she
told you everything,

1007
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,890
what more do you want?

1008
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,500
The truth!

1009
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,340
I don't know anything else.

1010
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:48,360
Well, I really hate to do this,

1011
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,420
but we're gonna have to arrest you

1012
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,980
for withholding..
Just wait a goddamn minute.

1013
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,260
Then tell her to tell the truth.

1014
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,110
I have.

1015
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:54,563
There's nothing else to tell.

1016
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,520
Look, a woman saved our
daughter's life.

1017
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,934
That's all that matters.

1018
01:13:00,934 --> 01:13:02,090
Mom.

1019
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:02,923
A woman?

1020
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:04,813
Describe her.

1021
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:05,900
She was Caucasian.

1022
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:08,490
You promised you wouldn't say anything.

1023
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,113
She's a middle aged woman.

1024
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,380
That's all she would tell us.

1025
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,083
You can't arrest her.

1026
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,703
I mean, come on, the truth
will set her free, right?

1027
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,963
Hey, sweet baby.

1028
01:13:36,753 --> 01:13:38,343
I miss you so much.

1029
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:41,783
And I love you.

1030
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:51,003
Amber, I've done some really
bad things, really bad.

1031
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:56,750
And I may have to go away for awhile,

1032
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:57,993
but please don't worry,

1033
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,030
because I'm always gonna be
with you

1034
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:05,004
and you with me.

1035
01:14:05,004 --> 01:14:07,760
Because everything that
I'm doing I do for you.

1036
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:19,433
Amber, I have to go.

1037
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:22,150
Some men wanna play games
with me.

1038
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:32,912
So you think she saw us?

1039
01:14:33,745 --> 01:14:34,578
Oh yeah.

1040
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:38,177
Now let's see if we've rattled
her cage a little.

1041
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:41,102
We'll move in when we get
that warrant.

1042
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:41,935
Cool.

1043
01:14:58,297 --> 01:14:59,300
Car 32 come in.

1044
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,963
Woody, this may be our warrant.

1045
01:15:02,226 --> 01:15:03,300
This is H7, go ahead.

1046
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,190
Confirmation Jake Fawthorp.

1047
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:06,290
Dispatch, what's the location?

1048
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:08,070
1600 Lone Tree Road.

1049
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,873
That's where our boy Jake worked.

1050
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,583
Officers standing by waiting
for you.

1051
01:15:24,352 --> 01:15:26,350
Okay, don't let her out of
your sight

1052
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:27,880
and notify me of every move,
all right?

1053
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,713
Yes, sir.

1054
01:15:28,713 --> 01:15:29,546
Here we go.

1055
01:15:29,546 --> 01:15:31,795
You got it.

1056
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:38,903
I believe this is your suspect,
Jake Fawthorp.

1057
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:42,890
Can't be positive until
we get back to the lab.

1058
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:44,540
How you know it's him?

1059
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,310
We got his license.

1060
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:47,630
But like I said, we can't be sure

1061
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,310
until we take him back to the lab.

1062
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,501
So where's the other body?

1063
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,493
Over there and over there.

1064
01:15:58,739 --> 01:15:59,600
A vengeance.

1065
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,085
That's a civilian thing.

1066
01:16:02,085 --> 01:16:04,143
Oh, Eva, what have you done?

1067
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,603
She's treating us like some
small Podunk town cops.

1068
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,250
What's in the other bag?

1069
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,060
All male body parts.

1070
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:16,270
So chances are 50/50
that one Jake Fawthorp.

1071
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:17,530
I mean, pick a bag.

1072
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:18,528
He's got a penis, must be him.

1073
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,340
Wood.

1074
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:26,950
So assuming that that bag

1075
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,983
has bits of his brother,

1076
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:32,410
then the only person left is..

1077
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:33,243
Rose Garden.

1078
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,360
Rose Garden.

1079
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,369
Yep.

1080
01:17:11,954 --> 01:17:12,871
She lied.

1081
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:16,890
She lied, she lied, she lied!

1082
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:18,190
She lied about everything.

1083
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,030
That's why she didn't
ask a single question

1084
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:22,380
when I showed her that picture
of Jake.

1085
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,213
She knew who he was.

1086
01:17:23,213 --> 01:17:25,853
She knew exactly who he
was and where he was.

1087
01:18:15,217 --> 01:18:16,634
Help me please.

1088
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,520
Is she still here?

1089
01:18:19,357 --> 01:18:21,677
Is she still here?

1090
01:18:21,677 --> 01:18:25,080
No, she, she went out that door.

1091
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,946
I thought that you woulda
been dead by now.

1092
01:18:26,946 --> 01:18:28,900
I knew you guys were in trouble

1093
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,520
when they sent me to check on you.

1094
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,913
Why didn't you come sooner to
help us?

1095
01:18:34,861 --> 01:18:39,410
Oh, sweetheart,
I'm not here to save you.

1096
01:18:40,323 --> 01:18:43,850
And I don't give a shit if she
gets away.

1097
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:46,663
You're the last link that
ties any of this to me.

1098
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:51,003
You make me sick, sick!

1099
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,523
I'm glad I'm gonna be
the one who kills you.

1100
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:58,250
I never liked you.

1101
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,083
Please, please.

1102
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:00,965
Please don't kill me please.
Shh shh shh shh.

1103
01:19:00,965 --> 01:19:01,798
Please.

1104
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:07,497
As I've heard Jake say
a thousand times before,

1105
01:19:07,497 --> 01:19:11,840
"I love it when a bitch begs."

1106
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,410
Except this isn't one of 'em.

1107
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:14,900
I agree!

1108
01:19:20,936 --> 01:19:23,100
No, she's holding Rose hostage.

1109
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:27,300
Or Rose is dead and Eva can't
dump the body just yet.

1110
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,390
Either way that's old fashioned
red-handed if we catch her.

1111
01:19:40,102 --> 01:19:41,060
Get me that warrant.

1112
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,609
I'll get you that warrant.

1113
01:19:42,609 --> 01:19:44,776
You get me that warrant.

1114
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:27,777
Warrant serve.

1115
01:20:56,413 --> 01:20:58,230
Where the hell is Davis?

1116
01:20:58,230 --> 01:20:59,080
Wait a minute, look at this.

1117
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,660
We got a trail of blood.

1118
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:03,210
Drop, drop, drop, drop.

1119
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:04,473
Hope that's not Davis.

1120
01:21:08,603 --> 01:21:09,750
Are you ready for this?

1121
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:10,583
Let's do it.

1122
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:17,853
Oh man.

1123
01:21:19,102 --> 01:21:20,640
Fuck!

1124
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,473
Fuck!

1125
01:21:22,458 --> 01:21:23,291
Big fuck.

1126
01:21:25,792 --> 01:21:27,959
Hey what do you say, boss?

1127
01:21:38,098 --> 01:21:40,620
We'll meet again, Eva.

1128
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,069
I promise you that.

1129
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:27,020
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1130
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,910
If you change your mind,
now's the time.

1131
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:33,790
My daughter's been pimped out

1132
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:36,010
and eventually laid out in a casket.

1133
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,273
Now she's in the dirt.

1134
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:39,803
I have nothing to turn back to.

1135
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:43,180
I want 'em all.

1136
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:45,223
Ask and thou shalt receive.

1137
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,006
Hello.

1138
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,103
Can you hear my words?

1139
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:02,113
Let me be clear why you are here.

1140
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,183
You chose option three.

1141
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:15,403
Ignorance is no excuse for
not knowing the options.

1142
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:18,133
You will learn as we go.

1143
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:24,342
You will branded and then your
turn with Mom.

1144
01:23:29,442 --> 01:23:30,663
Woo!

1145
01:23:30,663 --> 01:23:33,147
That that is was coffin bolt.

1146
01:23:35,467 --> 01:23:37,533
Heaven's not what you imagined?

1147
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:40,903
Nothing is ever as it seems.

1148
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,493
Welcome to reality, my lamb.

1149
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:48,624
I am God.
