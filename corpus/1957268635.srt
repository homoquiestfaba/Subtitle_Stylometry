[intense music]

00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,666
[blood splashing]

3
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,750
- Hello there.

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,708
My name is Lincoln Maazel.

5
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:47,916
On my next birthday,
I'll be 71 years of age.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,541
I am an actor, I'm working.

7
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:51,666
I have a family.

8
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,083
Despite the many problems
and frustrations of the world

9
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,791
as it is today,

10
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,541
no one will deny that there
is still a basic fulfillment

11
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:05,750
which is drawn from living,
being active, and contributing.

12
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,583
There is a joy to life
available to those who

13
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,958
can interact with nature,
with their fellow man.

14
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,708
Unfortunately, this interaction
is denied to many groups,

15
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,541
for many reasons.

16
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,083
Levels of income,

17
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,708
environmental deprivation,

18
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,958
geographical accident,

19
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:28,333
perhaps the saddest cause
of denial and rejection

20
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:32,083
is very simply, old age.

21
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,625
Man lives his mature
life with hope.

22
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,750
He looks forward to the day
when he can reap the benefits

23
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,833
of his experience, his
earnings and his wisdom.

24
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,541
And yet, he often finds
he is not regarded

25
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,000
as a productive
member of his society.

26
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,250
And if he doesn't
have a reputation

27
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,708
and doesn't have
financial substance,

28
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,958
the situation is a
hundred times worse.

29
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,875
Some of the many problems
of aging are loneliness,

30
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:05,208
failing health,
inadequate transportation,

31
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,666
inadequate medical care,
inadequate housing,

32
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,625
lack of money,
improper nutrition,

33
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,375
and perhaps most acute,

34
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,333
the lack of compassion
and supportive services

35
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,541
from the younger
members of our society.

36
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,916
The oldest citizens
of the world represent

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,708
a much misused natural resource.

38
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:33,875
The wasting of this great
resource is a worldwide tragedy,

39
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,791
but this can be
corrected by people.

40
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,916
People who can be made aware.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,500
People who can care and who
can respond to the need.

42
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,958
Oh, you've heard the statistics,

43
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,708
and you've been preached
to about the problem.

44
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,708
You've seen news reports
and documentary material

45
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,875
dealing with the
plight of the elderly.

46
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,041
We will not repeat
what you have heard.

47
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,541
The amusement park which
you are about to visit

48
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,125
illustrates some of
the many problems

49
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,708
people of my age face
on a daily basis.

50
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,750
We intend for you to feel the
problem, to experience it,

51
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,541
and we ask for your
sympathy as you watch.

52
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,416
And when the film ends,

53
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,041
we hope you will have
the concerned interest
to take action.

54
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,541
The supporting players of
this film are not actors.

55
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,833
They are volunteers,

56
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,583
many of whom are
actively involved

57
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,666
in services to the elderly.

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,916
The older people in the
film are also volunteers

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,458
who are either concerned
enough to give us of that time

60
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:40,375
or who, in real life, are
living in institutions,

61
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,000
in lower income housing
areas, or in city slums.

62
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,291
The time spent in
shooting at Westview Park,

63
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,083
which facility was
donated to the production,

64
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,708
was for some of the
elderly players,

65
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:57,833
the only enjoyable time they
have had in recent years.

66
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:02,916
Remember, as you watch the
film, one day you will be old.

67

[door opening]

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,791
- Hello?

72
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,166
I say hello there.

73
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't you care to talk?

74
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,125
- No.

75
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:40,708
- Uh, tell me, um, would
you like to do something?

76
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:41,791
- No.

77
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,208
- Do you, um, do
you ever go outside?

78
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,208
- No.

79
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,125
- Don't you want
to ever go outside?

80
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:56,833
- Th-there's nothing,

81
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,750
nothing out, outside.

82
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:08,666
- Well, I'm going
outside anyway.

83
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:14,000
- You, you won't, you won't
like, you won't like it.

84
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:20,416
- Well I'll, I'll see for
myself if you don't mind.

85
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,875
Goodbye.

86
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,291
- Th-there's nothing outside.

87
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,083
Nothing.

88
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:37,083
[people chattering]
[amusement park music]

89
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,125
Nothing.

[amusement park chatter]

93
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,041
- [Man] I can't give
you more than $5 for it.

94
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,208
- Oh no, they're
worth more than that.

95
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,208
- [Man] No, I'm
afraid not, ma'am.

96
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,541
- Oh, please.

97
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,958
- They may have
sentimental value to me

98
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:58,958
but they're worth $5
to me and that's it.

99
00:07:59,041 --> 00:07:59,958
Take it or leave it.

100
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,458
- [Woman] All right then.

101
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,958
Okay, thank you.

102
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,708
- This is silver.

103
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,708
- All right, let me
take a look at it.

104
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,916
- [Man] That's real silver.

105
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,166
- I can't give you more than $5.

106
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,625
- Oh man, what you
talking about, listen.

107
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,041
- [Merchant] $5,
take it or leave it.

108
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,541
- [Man] You ain't looked
at the thing right.

109
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,708
- [Merchant] Not worth
anything more than $5.

110
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,041
I've examined it
very thoroughly.

111
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,458
- Well come on, come
on I'll take it,

112
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,458
but you are, you
are beating me now.

113
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,833
- [Merchant] There you are.

114
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,625
- How much you give me for it?

115
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,875
- I'll give you a buck.

116
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,166
- No, you can't, $15.

117
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,083
- What, take a buck, that's it.

118
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,333
- Oh my goodness.

119
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,500
- Who's next?

120
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,583
Yes sir?

121
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,541
- I'd like to get some tickets.

122
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,041
- Okay, fine.

123
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,541
Cash, that's what I like to see.

124
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,333
How much you have to spend?

125
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,916
- Well, I.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,958
- Time is money,
let's come on now.

127
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,500
- I'm, I'm on a budget, you see?

128
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,208
I have to be very careful.

129
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,000
- How much do you want to spend?

130
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:53,875
- Well, I.

131
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
- Just a minute folks, I'll
be with you in a second.

132
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,125
- I can afford about half.

133
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,666
- Half, all right,
fine, fine, fine.

134
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,291
- And this is gonna
be for an emergency.

135
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,166
- Sure, okay.

136
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,125
That's okay with me.

137
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,125
Sure okay, here you go.

138
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,458
- Thank you very much, sir.

139
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:08,875
- Who's next?

140
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:09,750
Step right up.

141
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,125
- Okay, it's fine.

142
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,458
- Oh!
- Oh!

143
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,125
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

144
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,166
- I'm terribly sorry.

145
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,375
I'm terribly sorry, I, I.

146
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,416
- Okay, step right across.

147
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,250
Here, that's fine,
go ahead, here.

148
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,250
One more, watch your step
there, watch your step.

149
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,083
Two, take two more here.

150
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,625
Hurry up, you're
gonna miss the car.

151
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,750
Okay, good.

152
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,166
Sorry ma'am, you're not aloud.

153
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,250
Read the sign there.

154
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,750
Let's go, come on, next, next.

155
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,791
Fine, fine.

156
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:00,791
I'm sorry, ma'am,
you can't get on.

157
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,250
- Oh please, please.

158
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,625
- Read the sign,
just read the sign.

159
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,541
- How come we can't get on?

160
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,541
- [Worker] Maybe next year.

161
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,791
- How come we can't get on?

162
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,958
- [Worker] Go right
through there?

163
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,208
- [Man] How come
we can't get on?

164
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,291
- [Man] We're going down!

165
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,208
We're going down!

166
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,833
We keep going downhill.

167
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,875
No we're going up,
we're going up!

168
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,375

[bell ringing]

174
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,500
All aboard!

175
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,166
Okay!

181
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,541
- Read the chart.

182
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,750
Start at the top, just
work your way down.

183
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,833

calm, Harry, take it easy.

188
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,166
- T.

189
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,916
- Okay, ma'am, you're okay.

190
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,291
But, sir, you're gonna have
to be a passenger from now on.

191
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,041
Cannot renew your
license with those eyes.

193
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,041

- See where you're going
for crying out loud.

198
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,791
If there's anything stupider
than a woman driver,

199
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:56,750
it's an old woman driver.

200
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,375
- What do you mean?

201
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,166
You made left hand turn
with a right hand signal.

202
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,666
- How old are you?

203
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,541
- Well, if it's any of
your business, I'm 67.

204
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:07,041
- If that's true you shouldn't
even be allowed on the road.

205
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,250
Anybody over 65 should
be made to ride the bus.

206
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,833
- What do you mean?

207
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:11,583
Don't you know, your left
hand from your right?

208
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,416
- [Man] Ah, you.

209
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,916
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

210
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,666
Wait, one minute.

211
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,750
What happened?

212
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,750
- [Man] She hit me from behind.

213
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:18,833
- Well, for goodness sake.

214
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,125
My version is, he doesn't know

215
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,583
his left hand from
his right hand.

216
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,666
- [Officer] Your
driver's license, please.

217
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,500
- [Man] She hit me from behind.

218
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,125
Now isn't it true

219
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,166
when somebody hits you from
behind it's their fault?

220
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,500
Right in front of your eyes?

221
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,333
- Okay listen,
that's why I'm here.

222
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,750
- Since I'm so old,

223
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,583
you better have a little
more respect for me.

224
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,916
That's what I say.

225
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,208
- There's no sense
arguing about it.

226
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,583
I'll make the report
of what I see.

227
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,291
- Oh, here's our insurance man.

228
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,791
- [Man] You can see the damage,

229
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,583
you know how much
something like this costs.

230
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,875
- [Woman] You're not even old
enough to be an insurance guy.

231
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,583
- We're here to
represent our client.

232
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,458
- [Woman] A kid in kindergarten
knows left and right hand.

233
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,166
- Officer, excuse me please,

234
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,333
but I was driving coming this
way and I saw the accident.

235
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,458
This man actually made
a left hand signal

236
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,750
and made a right turn.

237
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,541
I saw him do that.

238
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,458
- [Man] Aw, come on.

239
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,541
- [Woman] Exactly, good.

240
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,083
- Well, sir, all I can tell you

241
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,625
is the same thing I told them,

242
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,125
since I didn't see the accident,

243
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,500
I'll be glad to put
down what you said

244
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,875
and your name and address,

245
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,750
the insurance companies
will contact you.

246
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,083
Can I see your drivers
license, please?

247
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,750
- Yes.

248
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,041
- [Man] I would guess that
our company's gonna require

249
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,125
a slight adjustment in the rate.

250
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,833
- Good grief, man.

251
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,125
We can hardly afford it now,
the rates are high enough.

252
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,666
- Don't you worry, Harry.

253
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,666
We're not gonna have
any rate increase

254
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,416
'cause this was not our fault.

255
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,791
- According to your license,

256
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,500
you're supposed to be
wearing eyeglasses.

257
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,708
- Oh, yes, well.

258
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:30,583
- [Officer] Do you?

259
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,500
- I, I, I have them.

260
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,625
- [Man] Aha, aha.

261
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,291
- [Woman] Oh, what?

262
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,666
- [Man] Blind man, blind man
says he saw the accident.

263
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,583
- [Woman] Oh my goodness, Harry.

264
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,958
- [Man] I'd like to see
this hold up in court.

265
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,416
- [Woman] He didn't
have his glasses on.

266
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,583
- [Man] How could he be
a witness to anything?

267
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,791
I'm telling you,
I made a signal.

268
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,500
She smashed into me from behind.

269
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,875
That's all there is to it.

270
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:46,958
- [Woman] You made
a signal, all right.

271
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:47,833
- [Man] Clearly, you're wrong.

272
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,208
Look at this damage.

gonna tell you something.

275
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,250
I've had about enough
of both of you arguing.

276
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,541
I'm not gonna tell you again.

277
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,625
- [Man] I got my
own insurance man.

278
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,541
I'll take care of this myself.

with Mr John Wilson,

the landlord here who
owns the building.

335
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,541
Mr Wilson, why haven't you

336
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,041
made any repairs
to this building?

337
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,541
It's in deplorable condition.

338
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,708
- Well sir, do you
realize the kind of taxes

339
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,125
that we have to pay here?

340
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,791
- [Reporter] But aren't
the conditions here

341
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,916
unsafe for the people who
pay you rent, good money?

342
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,166
- [Mr Wilson] Well,
actually rent that I get

343
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,875
is no more than about $10
a week from these people.

344
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,333
And with that kind of money,

345
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,750
do you expect me to make
any more improvements

346
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,500
than what we have already?

347
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,083
- [Reporter] Well if you can't
make the repairs yourself,

348
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,166
Mr Wilson, then why don't
you sell this property

349
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,791
and let someone else make them?

350
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,333
- [Mr Wilson] Well, we tried
desperately to do that,

351
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,791
but who will buy it? Would you,

352
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,416
sir, would you consider
buying this property?

353
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,791
- [Reporter] I'm asking
you the question.

354
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,291
I'm asking the question
of you, Mr Wilson.

355
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,166
You tell me why
you can't sell it.

356
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,833
- [Mr Wilson] Well, not
too many people today

357
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:08,875
would take the chance to
buying this kind of property

358
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,875
knowing the circumstances
and the conditions here.

359
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,250
[woman laughing]

360
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,541
- [Reporter] Seems
the condition is that

361
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,958
you haven't made
any improvements.

362
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:15,791
You're telling me you
don't have the money.

363
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,250
- [Mr Wilson] Yes.

364
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,750
- [Reporter] What about
the condition inside?

365
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,125
Don't you have an
obligation to your tenants

366
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,500
to make these repairs
and make them now?

367
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,000
- [Mr Wilson] We have
made some repairs,

368
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,375
but unfortunately they're
the type of people

369
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:27,166
that just will not
take care of themselves

370
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,291
nor the place that
they're living in.

371
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,208
[train warning bell ringing]

372
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:41,958

[people chattering]

375
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,208
- Well you look better
than my mother looked.

376
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,416
You look wonderful.

377
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,208
[phone ringing]

378
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,125
- Oh, hello there.

379
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:01,208
- Dr Jones, my
husband is so bad.

380
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:04,041
I can't talk to him,
he won't answer me.

381
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,500
He doesn't take his medicine.

382
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,208
- I'd love to talk for
a longer period of time.

383
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:09,666
- You're too busy to come.

384
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,541
- Goodbye.

385
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,791

[mystical music]

389
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,958
- [Reporter] Could you
explain to our audience

390
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,625
if someone in this building
is burned to death tonight

391
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:43,708
or be injured in a fall down
these decrepit stairways,

392
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,250
how would you explain it, sir?

393
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:48,291
- Sir, I sincerely hope
that never happens.

394
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,083
[mystical music]

395
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,125

[phone ringing]

400
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,750
- I can't understand.

401
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:30,750
I can't get him to
even recognize me.

402
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,208
[people chattering]

403
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,708
Why can't you come to
come to see my husband?

404
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,791
We've always been good patients.

405
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:40,416
As poor as we are we've
always paid our bill.

406
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,625
Why are you punishing
me like this?

407
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,291
For heaven's sake,

408
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,791
didn't you take an oath
when you studied medicine

409
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:49,541
that you would be
kind to people?

410
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:52,958
Isn't that one of the things
a doctor's supposed to do?

411
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:55,541
What kind of a man are you?

412
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,250
I want you to come here.

413
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,375
Would you, please?

414
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,416
[people chattering]

415
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,083
- Doctor, I have a
ringing in my ear.

[people chattering]

417
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,916
- Well then, God help you

418
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,708
if you have to have
this on your conscience!

419
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:13,500
[drums beating rhythmically]

420
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,166
Mister, please, mister.

421
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:45,500
Oh my God, mister, please.

422
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,500
Can you give me a dime, I
have to make a telephone call.

423
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,666
Oh, why are people so mean?

424
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:54,833
Why can't anybody help me?

425
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:59,541
[drums beating rhythmically]

[men laughing]

432
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,250
- Tickets, man, dig, dig, dig.

433
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:00,750
Pick him, pick him.
Tickets, tickets, man.

434
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:04,625
No, no, come here, man.

435
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:07,291
Go through his pockets,
go through his pockets.

436
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,750
What you got, what you got?

437
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:09,583
Hey give me, give me
some of those tickets.

438
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:13,083
His tickets, man.

439
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,375
Give me some of that.

440
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,333
Wow!

441
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,958
[engines revving]

00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:50,625
[amusement park music]

443
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:40,625
- [Woman] Your name, sir?

444
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:41,500
- I, I.

445
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:43,583
- [Woman] Your name, sir.

446
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:44,666
- I, I, I have no receipt.

447
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,791
I can't.

448
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,625
I've got insurance.

449
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:49,833
- That's an awful
lot of paperwork.

450
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,250
Can't you pay cash?

451
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:55,750
- Cash, yeah I, I
uh, I got some cash.

452
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,791
- Get in there.

453
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:21,083
[heart beating]
[people chattering]

454
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,833
- Looks like a bandage.

455
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:30,791
Bandage, bandage here.

456
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,291
Bandage.
- Bandage?

457
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,125
- [Doctor] Bandage.

458
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,125
- [Nurse] Bandage.

459
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,458
Move down the line.

460
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,291
- [Doctor] This
looks like a bandage.

461
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:37,333
- Bandage?

462
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:38,083
- [Nurse] Move down the line.

463
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,000
- I need more.

464
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:40,666
I more than a bandage.

465
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,458
- Bandage?

466
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:43,000
- Bandage.

467
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,500
- [Old Man] I need
more than a bandage.

468
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:46,916
- [Nurse] Move down
the line please, sir.

469
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
- Did you have your
forms filled out, sir.

470
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:50,625
- I don't have any forms.

471
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:51,416
- [Nurse] You don't have any?

472
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,458
- No.

473
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:53,291
- [Nurse] We need your forms.

474
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:54,291
- I don't have any.

475
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,958
- [Nurse] Oh come on sir,

476
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:56,791
you'll have to go back to
the beginning of the line.

477
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:57,666
- I need a doctor.

478
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,041
- We need our forms.

479
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,041
Look, you should be
feeling a lot better,

480
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,500
they put a bandaid on you.

481
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:02,500
Take this and just go
back to the beginning.

482
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:03,833
- Go back?

483
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:04,875
- [Nurse] Yes, we
need our forms, sir.

484
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:05,791
- Go back.
[old man crying]

485
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:06,500
- Bandage.

486
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,875
- Bandage.

487
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,416
- [Old Man] I need
more than a bandage.

488
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,208
- Low cost of installation,
low heating process.

489
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,458
Something you've always dreamt
of in a perfect climate.

490
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:16,375
- As I've walked down
the road of life,

491
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:17,916
one thing's been true to me,

492
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,500
and that is that a man's
home is his castle.

493
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,083
Now home is just like the body.

494
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:26,625
That home gets old, it
gets weak, it gets tired.

495
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:28,833
Now there are many things
that can happen to a home.

496
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:31,000
The roof can leak, gas, fire.

497
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,000
All the devils of the
night can sneak in

498
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,125
and wipe out your
investment all at once.

499
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:38,458
Now ladies and gentlemen,

500
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:41,000
my father and I many years ago

501
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,875
decided that man's
home being his castle,

502
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:46,000
we formed Castle Rebuilding.

503
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,875
And we've been rebuilding
castles around this area

504
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:50,750
for a long, long time.

505
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:53,958
Saving the life investment
of many and many a person.

506
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,958
- [Merchant] Big five,
big public space.

507
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,041
Ma'am, let me show you that
just one moment please.

508
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:00,916
A place to live, a place to
live with nice big roomy houses.

509
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,416
Ma'am are you tired of
watering your grass?

510
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,875
Are you tired or
watering your plants?

511
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:05,958
Are you tired of
painting your house, sir?

512
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:06,916
You're darn right, you are.

513
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,500
Well I've got something.

514
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,083
- I am now gonna come on Monday.

515
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,666
And for those of
you who are willing,

516
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,458
I am gonna give you my card.

517
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:17,875
Castle Rebuilders, founded
by my father and myself.

518
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,583
- We'll accept your
home in a trade in

519
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,291
at a very fair market value.

520
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,833
In fact, you can have your
home independently appraised,

521
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:26,458
let us know what it is, our
appraisers will check it out,

522
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:29,125
and if that's a fair market
value you can trade your home in

523
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:31,791
for one of these
retirement, carefree homes.

524
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:35,041
- We make an estimate
absolutely free of charge.

525
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,791
Never do we charge one penny
for inspecting your furnace,

526
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,416
for inspecting your roof,

527
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,166
for inspecting your
electric wiring.

528
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,041
- What you have to do is watch
out for these fast talkers.

529
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:47,083
What one really
needs is a friend.

530
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:49,500
- Oh, yes, sir, you're
quite right, quite right.

531
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:51,666
- I think this is about the
best place to find a friend.

534

place, you're right.

535

in just one single
possession, his home.

541
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:11,625
Do you spend a lot of time
fixing your home, sir?

542
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,083
- [Man] Yes, I do.

543
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:13,916
- [Merchant] Do you find
that things go wrong?

544
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,541
- [Man] Yes, I do.

545

Do you find it makes you say,

549
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:21,166
I wish this home would
stop breaking down.

550
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,708
- [Man] But when do
I have to pay you?

have to pay me, sir.

It's so nice to find
a nice little girl.

Oh, what a lovely book.

591
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:58,166
Would you like me to
read the story to you?

592
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,250
Would you?

593
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,166
Oh, I would like to very much.

Let's see.

595
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:07,416
Oh, this is "The
Three Little Pigs."

596
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,791
Once upon a time,

597
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,416
three little pigs

598
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,291
went out into the world
to seek their fortunes.

599
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:15,708
- Want some chicken?

600
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:17,666
- Oh, I'd love to have
a piece of chicken.

601
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:22,291
I haven't had anything
to eat for some time.

602
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,958
Well, thank you, dear.

603
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,041
Wouldn't you like to
have a piece, too?

604
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:31,416
- No thanks, I already had some.

605
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,291
- Now the first thing
each of them had to do

606
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:35,291
was to build a house to live in.

607
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,416
The first little pig

608
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,833
met a man carrying
a bundle of straw.

609
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,500
Please, sir, he said.

610
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:46,416
Give me some straw to
build myself a house.

611
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,458
The straw house
was quickly built,

612
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,833
and the little pig was
just settling down nicely

613
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:56,583
when a big, bad wolf knocked
in the door and said,

614
00:46:56,666 --> 00:47:00,333
little pig, little
pig, let me come in.

615
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:02,833
Not by the hair on
my chimney chin chin,

616
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:03,958
said the little pig.

617
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,625
Isn't that funny?

618
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,500
Then the big, bad wolf,

619
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,958
uh, huffed and he puffed.

620
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:14,583
And he puffed and he huffed
and blew the house in.

621
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,416
He ate up the
frightened little pig

622
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,375
and that was the end
of that little pig.

623
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:19,833
- [Mother] Girls, come
on now, it's time to go.

624
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:22,375
- Now the little pig
had built himself

625
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:24,083
a house of bricks.

626
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:26,000
It took him much longer to
build a house, a straw house

627
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:27,500
and a house of sticks,

628
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,083
the little pig that just
got to the brick place.

629
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:31,166
When the big, bad wolf
knocked the door and said,

630
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,666
little pig, little
pig, let me come in!

631
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,583
And not by the hair of
my chimney chin, chin.

632
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:37,958
Hi there.

633
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:43,041
Oh, don't go.

And whether you return
to the white room,

desolate, destroyed, and
without any hope for the future,

677

will be beyond your control.
