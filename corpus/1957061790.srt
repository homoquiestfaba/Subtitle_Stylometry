1
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:46,900
Arkham Asylum July  3rd then made known

2
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,470
only as  the Joker has escaped proving

3
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,089
once again  that the system is broken

4
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,309
I've had to put my ongoing investigation

5
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:01,559
 of a serial killer Victor Zsasz on hold

6
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,469
the Joker is always top priority

7
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:19,590
his footprints into the West End sewer

8
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,790
caverns this is why I'm here

9
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,399
his path of destruction has already

10
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,940
begun putting Arkham nurse

11
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,720
twenty-three-year-old or Rebecca white

12
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,899
in the hospital she had only been

13
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,839
working at the asylum for two weeks

14
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:00,340
the news coverage of this has spread

15
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,569
like  a raging fire today  the people of

16
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:06,849
Gotham  are waking up to the Joker's

17
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,569
words the zebra has escaped  from the zoo

18
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:17,239
to feast on the  blood of the life

19
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,960
ever since my parents deaths  I rarely

20
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,600
appeared the city in daylight

21
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:03,439
but this alley  I know too well I come

22
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,329
here when I can no  longer silence the

23
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:10,459
demons in  my head

24
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,929
as with all children

25
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:17,329
 I look to my parents for help for an

26
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:20,830
answer

27
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,778
I'm not that insane

28
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,639
the Gotham skyline  towers home to

29
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,999
councilman  Johnson his wife and

30
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:26,710
ten-year-old son earlier this evening

31
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,410
 the councilman and his son were

32
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,519
kidnapped while his wife was  brutally

33
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,629
murdered  by the Joker

34
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,869
hearing this news tears have the only

35
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:47,218
humanity that I have left another child

36
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:50,590
stripped of its innocence by Gotham's

37
00:05:50,790 --> 00:06:02,990
underworld  - kidnapped one dead

38
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,520
can you confirm that  joker was here well

39
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,439
the preliminary evidence matches his

40
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:11,239
profile

41
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,994
are there any recognizable prints none

42
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:20,730
this was very clean and precise there

43
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,550
has to be something in here we  can use

44
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,559
all the evidence left here was

45
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,620
intentional as always

46
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,249
the city was the  Joker bad there's a

47
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:38,900
crowd  already gathering outside of the

48
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,999
hospital  for that poor Arkham nurse  I

49
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,900
hate to say it  could I blame Batman why

50
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,749
look I know our city is dirty we know

51
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,879
the only way to come clean is to put our

52
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,679
faith in a force that's greater than  the

53
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,400
law  a force that can take liberties

54
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,819
 where the law can't and we've given that

55
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,009
force the power to stop this madness and

56
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:13,409
it hasn't Gotham sick of Batman's

57
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:13,609
conscience so am I

58
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,969
to skill

59
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,680
shift  gears

60
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,210
your Harley it seems that that the lack

61
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,800
of conscience is what has created  these

62
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,000
freaks of Gotham

63
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:09,309
this city will  never know how lucky they

64
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:11,069
 are that I've never crossed that line

65
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:14,903
because  if I did step into that abyss  I

66
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,738
take all of Gotham with me

67
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,899
he's here open his cell

68
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:36,978
 partly where is he I'm not supposed to

69
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:36,779
talk to you

70
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,309
 two people are already dead their child

71
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,439
is missing  I thought he'd be with you by

72
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,660
now you're always at the  top of  this

73
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,959
dance card he doesn't care about you

74
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,270
Harvey he's just using you that's why he

75
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:57,490
 needed your help to  escape from Arkham

76
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,820
me he'll come back

77
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:15,079
he can't help himself he's going through

78
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,469
something terrible  you know this you

79
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:21,410
 know him better than anyone  I don't know

80
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:28,790
anything about  a missing kid but I do

81
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,050
know something about a little man owing

82
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,070
him a favor and that he plans to  cash a

83
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,179
 parlays reference to the little man

84
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:56,039
was obvious he runs one of the dirtiest

85
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,239
clubs in Gotham

86
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,719
 we go

87
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:58,259

88
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,874

89
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:03,489

00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,500
oops

91
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,859
 I could have taken the silent approach

92
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,429
slipped in unnoticed but I'm looking to

93
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:57,990
be noticed  I need to make it clear that

94
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,270
criminals will no longer be tolerated  in

95
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,069
Gotham

96
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:07,129
that's night it ends

97
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:49,880
I don't have time for your games Wesker

00:13:50,080 --> 00:14:00,129

 Carnival did you like Carnival

111
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:18,558
 god

112
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,909
councilman Johnson

00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:30,579
hey we got  time for shriek real boy bomb

114
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:30,779

are you sure you don't want any no well

116
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:49,740
then how  about a story once upon a time

117
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,069
there was  this fear slide who ruled over

118
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,099
the land unfairly  he would bully and

119
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,160
scare all of the  zebras sometimes in  the

120
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,309
devour them  one day one delivers the

121
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,509
challenges  alive

122
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:11,959
the councilman's body was  bound two

123
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:16,040
miles from here the missing child is now

124
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:25,528
lost both of his parents deaths for

125
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:25,728
safety  first

126
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,499
it's gonna be a great show

127
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:30,058
your best

128
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:03,970
 oh boy tell me

129
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:18,108
yeah

130
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:27,900
where do you think you're going

131
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:24,289
 I placed a tracking device in the Joker

132
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:27,923
before I let him go  I knew he would lead

133
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:31,558
 me straight to the child

134
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:30,628
 oh it's you

135
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,180
I see about my toy cow it's all fun and

136
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:44,020
games here see  give a little chain

137
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:26,140
why didn't you save my parents

138
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,490
the Joker was anything but anticlimactic

139
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,639
which is  exactly what this death is

140
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,250
with all of his mischievious almost

141
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,919
whimsical schemes the Joker was nothing

142
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,460
to roll your eyes at every performance

143
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,890
as he called him  at a point

144
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:05,700
even if a horrific death toll landed him

145
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,490
back in Markham it was always part of

146
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:15,039
his plan but this doesn't seem to  follow

147
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:15,239
any plan

148
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,608
is it possible that this child was  able

149
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:22,869
to do what should have been  done years

150
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:26,109
ago

151
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:33,639
is it really that  black-and-white is

152
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,358
this a victory is this a sign that the

153
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:41,000
 store is passing or getting worse

154
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:53,850
I failed I failed my parents and most of

155
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:53,649
all I failed him

156
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:56,180
the batmanning says to make sure  that

157
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,630
what  happened to Bruce Wayne never

158
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:00,430
happens to anyone else

159
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,290
how many more broken families  exist

160
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,309
because of  the Joker's reign of terror

161
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:11,690
 a terror that I couldn't seem to  end

162
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:23,370
even in death  the Joker is still getting

163
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:23,570
the last laugh

164
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:33,279
even without the Joker Gotham has a

165
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:33,479
share of scars

166
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:38,990
but for those that have amassed  too many

167
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:38,790
scholars

168
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:46,000
it has pushed them  over the edge

169
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:50,329
have I been wrong all these  years

170
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:54,629
as I just too afraid  to pull the trigger

171
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:58,659
 I can't believe that to be true

172
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:02,319
but as my city and I grow older  I began

173
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,558
to doubt  the choices that I've made I

174
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,200
often ask myself if I were faced with

175
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,419
 the same  situation

176
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:18,439
but I've taken the life of my parents

177
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:18,639
killer

178
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:24,389
that is the question  that has haunted me

179
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,589
 my entire life

180
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,490
the only answer  that I have is the life

181
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,059
 that I now live the answer to that

182
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,599
question is  that

183
00:26:52,319 --> 00:27:02,549
where there once was the sound of

184
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:02,349
laughter  ours

185
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:17,669
a cold  where they won't sing a thousand

186
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:26,328
voices lies a graveyard

187
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:42,999
we

188
