12
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,782
Jesus, Biff. What are you doing?
You want someone to see?

13
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:19,082
What do you say, Biff?
You'll kick ass in this getup.

Dr. Napalm. Man, this is some kind of good.

15
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,360
The camera will love and caress you
in this outfit.

16
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,166
And it's got its own built-in wad
for the female demographic.

17
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,772
This is what myself and your other assistant
will be wearing.

18
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,709
It's state of the art.
It'll take something like 1,100 degrees.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,107
These things retail for $6,000 apiece,
but this guy's gonna let me trade...

20
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,242
the Tilt-A-Whirl
and the Flying Bobs for them.

21
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,785
Good deal. What do you think?

22
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,845
Wait. Just one second.

23
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,019
Biff never said
who his assistants were gonna be.

24
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,886
What makes you think
one of them is gonna be you?

25
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,523
'Cause this here suit fits me like a glove.

00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,797
Not to mention the fact
that I just committed a major felony...

00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:09,307
and risked my job by trading off
two carnival attractions that I don't own.

28
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,842
So why the hell shouldn't I be his assistant?

29
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,673
I mean, right, Biff?

30
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,825
Don't, Biff.

31
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,048
<i>Attention, patrons.</i>

32
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,915
<i>Midlothian Shopping Center

33

34
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,929

- I think I got all the ticks out of them.
- You do?

36
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,038
- Let's make it up on the roof.
- No.

37
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,080
I told you, we're not doing it on the roof.

38
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,452
- Kitchen table?
- There's not enough room.

39
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,211
We could put the leaf in.

40
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,582
Okay.

41
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,788
Where's the leaf?

42
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,832
I don't know. You had it last.
Is it under the trailer?

43
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,560
I wouldn't put it under the trailer.
It would dry-rot under the trailer.

44
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,104
Vida, we have a bed.
Let's use it like normal people.

45
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,543
Wilder, three more days in this place.

46
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,377
Three more days and I'm free.
I can go anywhere I want.

47
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:55,079
Go to the city, see some dinner theater,
hear the symphony.

48
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,958
No. Don't mess with it.

49
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,098
Please? I really want to.

50
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,499
I really do.

51
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,693
Okay.

52
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,098
Are you gonna look
in the closet for the leaf?

53
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:55,146
Forget the table. I'm nostalgic for a bed.

54
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,838
Well, that was a good idea.

55
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,199
You got a little sixteenth note left on you.

56
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,536
Vida, I have to go to work.

57
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,713
Kierkegaard, 17 across.

58
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,112
Thanks.

59
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,623
Last night, I dreamt we were Elvis
and Ann-Margret in <i>Viva</i> Las Vegas.

60
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,723
Again?

61
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:59,133
Only this time you were booked
in this sort of hotel-casino type thing.

62
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,802
It was sort of hot and dimly lit.

63
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,206
It reminded me of No <i>Exit</i> by Sartre.
And we were like prisoners.

64
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,405
We were held captive
unless and until you would sing.

65
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,312
And you were Elvis,
so it wasn't like you couldn't sing.

66
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,282
But you wouldn't do it.

67
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,808
So I was standing there saying:

68
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,481
"Come on, King. Just sing a song already."

69
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,053
And you were saying, "No, thanks, ma'am.

70
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:25,289
"I think I'll just stick
with this valet-parking thing."

71
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,629
You think that means something?

72
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,736
Light my cigarette.

73
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,577
No matches, baby.

74
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,985
All right, take it out of your mouth.

75
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,756
No. Live dangerously, Wilder.
I know you can do it.

76
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,721
Come on.

77
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,502
Smoking is bad for you.

78
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,912
Oh, God, Wilder.
So is 362 days of house arrest.

79
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,075
If you just came out with this thing,
we could be rich.

80
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,314
You'd be an emperor.
You could be Gruppenfiihrer.

81
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,787
They would make you a Mayan sun god.

82
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,892
It's just a damn parlor trick.

83
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,086
- That's all it's good for.
- So you keep saying.

84
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,424
God damn!

85
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,996
If I called you up in the middle of the day...

86
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,668
and asked you to drop everything
and come home, would you do it?

87
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,872
Not if the house
was burning to the ground, Vida.

88
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,945
<i>Brass nozzles</i>

89
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:01,423

Ain't got all day!

94
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,617
Come on! Let's get this thing in the air!

95
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,383
You hear me? Come on! Chop-chop!

96
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,428
You're not getting paid to pick your butt!
Now get over here!

97
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,761
We're doing this one first, all right?

98
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,757
Shit!

99
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,926
So, where's the fire?

100
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,132
Your house. Again!

101
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,832
What can I tell you?

102
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,272
I was up on the roof exercising,
and as near as I can figure...

103
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,240
my empty drinking glass must've focused...

104
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,836
the sun's rays in such a fashion
as to ignite the dry grass.

105
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,806
- Twice in six months.
- I know.

106
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,080
Vida, you have bad luck with fire,
don't you?

107
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,285
Yes. And that's why it's so lucky
that I'm married to a fireman.

108
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,652
- Don't you think?
- Yes, Vida.

109
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:32,089
But I tell you,
this is mighty suspicious-looking.

110
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,762
And seeing as how
you're under house arrest for arson...

111
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,534
and seeing as how
you got only three days left--

112
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,935
No, two days. Don't count today.

113
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:45,235
Two days. I'd be real careful if I was you.

114
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,410
I'd be a regular Smokey the Bear.

115
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,576
Yes, sir, she will be.

116
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,828
What the hell was this about?

117
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,631
It was an accident.
It was a boredom-induced accident.

118
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,567
You just better watch your step.

119
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,256
Bring home the boots and helmet tonight.

120
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,832
You guys haven't seen each other
in five years?

121
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,627
Not since he married her.

122
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,303
Don't make it six. We're here.

123
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:17,504
Honey, just go say hi.
Tell him about being on the TV.

124
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,737
Just try it.

125
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,645
- Stay.
- Come on! Cindy!

126
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,558
Hark!

127
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,024
Burn him, Biff.

128
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,329
Not when I'm in makeup. In makeup, I'm Biff.

129
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,905
Badass Biff. Burn him, Biff.

130
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,640
He's my brother, Rex.

131
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:38,787
- They know what you can do?
- Sure do.

132
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:45,219
Why, we're just one
big old thermonuclear family, Wilder!

133
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:48,091
- That's right.
- Sure are.

134
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,693
Christ, Wallace. You're a clown.

135
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,594
Good job.

136
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,303
You, too, Wilder.

137
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,537
Photo-booth jockey.

138
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,271
Very impressive.

139
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:07,506
Kind of like the Marlboro Man or something.

140
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,685
And nice rug, Wilder.

141
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,291
Good look for you.

142
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,326
Real hair never grew back?

143
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,158
I'm real sorry about that.

144
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:28,797
Go drop your pants and chase a doughnut,
you and your single-helix friends.

145
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:34,600
Fellas, what did I say wrong?
He's gone all ballistic on me.

146
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,553
- How's Vida?
- Still with me.

147
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,115
Hell, I knew that.

148
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:49,720
Coming into town today...

149
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,353
we saw y'all's love burnt across the clouds.

150
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,728
Real meteorological phenomenon.

151
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:58,259
You and sweet Vida
still living in that trailer park?

152
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,225
Homey.

153
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,969
Why, I think that's just the perfect place
to just plop down...

154
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,339
and start grinding out rug rats.

155
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,310
Just be domestic.

156
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,714
Buy some spinning daisy reflectors
for the yard.

157
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,114
Let those beautiful,
dirty-faced little children...

158
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:17,120
just run around the neighborhood
with no pants on.

159
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,822
"A fate worse than death,"
proclaims my brother...

160
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,786
the clown.

161
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:27,689
This guy's been blowing our fuses
with his air conditioner, Biff.

162
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,965
This air conditioner?

163
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,197
- Don't do it.
- Is this the machine to which you refer?

164
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,261
I said--

165
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:40,504
This beautiful,
climate-controlled, frost-free...

166
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,239
tundra wonder?

167
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,986
Just like five years ago.

168
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,990
Hell, just like our whole damn lives, Wilder.

169
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,327
You ain't changed a bit.

170
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,626
Hey, baby. How was your day?

171
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:20,067
There he is. There's my man.
No small appliance is safe tonight.

172
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:24,538
Did you see that air conditioner go?
Looked like damn uranium or something.

173
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:27,140
I'm keeping a chunk of it for a paperweight.

174
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,413
You ought to do that on TV.

175
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,717
You got all the joints
cotter-pinned this time, Rex?

176
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,020
We might've left a box of them
back at Frostproof, I think.

177
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,685
- You got a quarter?
- Yeah.

178
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,559
I'll keep an eye out for falling kids, Biff.

179
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,433
My name is Wallace, Rex.

180
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:06,947
- Couldn't we maybe just have dinner first?
- No. You'd just get cramps.

181
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,062
Hello?

182
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,306
<i>Who is this?</i>

183
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,679
<i>Hydrant wrenches</i>

184
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,746
<i>and shiny brass nozzles</i>

185
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,540
<i>Maglites and doorstops</i>

186
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,644
<i>bingo</i>

187
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:59,058
Don't go in there!
That's my private clubhouse.

188
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:03,264
This here is my private clubhouse.
I'm just letting you see the outside.

189
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,130
Okay? You can't go in.

190
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,401
Looks like an outhouse to me.

191
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,939
Yeah, Horace. We don't even want to go in.

192
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,969
Besides, it's on fire.

193
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,144
What's happening?

194
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:50,706
Heads up!

195
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,415
<i>Unit 27, is that you?</i>

196
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:46,357
So, what are you looking at?

197
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,167
So, what are you looking at?

198
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:52,403
- You taught me how to do this.
- Yes, I did.

199
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,612
- About a year and a half ago--
- Right.

200
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:59,376
A year and a half ago,
Wilder was managing this medical pavilion.

201
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:03,548
It was a pretty good job, <i>too.</i>
I mean, good benefits, nice people.

202
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,145
For him, it was a great job and he knew it.

203
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,515
And everybody really liked him.

204
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,453
It was winter at the time,
and he'd have to wake up...

205
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,362
really early on snowy days
to go out and shovel all the sidewalks.

206
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:19,933
And I was always getting on his case,
you know, about using his stuff...

207
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,796
to clear the sidewalks.

208
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,636
'Cause it would only take a minute
to melt all that snow...

209
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:28,644
and it was 5:00 a.m.,
so no one was gonna see or anything.

210
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:31,881
That way, I figured
if he used a little bit of that voodoo...

211
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,679
he could rush right back home and see me.

212
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,912
But anyway, he wouldn't go for it.

213
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:40,081
It was a Saturday,
so I was off work and I was helping him.

214
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,818
It was really icy.

215
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:45,688
And he's out front shoveling away
like crazy, and I'm in the back.

216
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,965
And I remember standing there,
holding this snow shovel...

217
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,935
looking at these two sidewalks
covered with about an inch of solid ice.

218
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,529
I mean, no way.

219
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,133
So, I go over to the tool shed...

220
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,268
I get a big can of gasoline...

221
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,943
and very neatly, I pour it down the lengths
of these two sidewalks.

222
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,916
I strike a match,
and I light up the first sidewalk.

223
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,146
And I'm telling you, it worked great.

224
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,520
I mean, gas doesn't mix with water,
it just burns on the top and melts all the ice.

225
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,752
Then I sort of notice
that the fire's starting to move.

226
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,931
All that ice had turned to water.

227
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,193
And the sidewalks were on an incline...

228
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:30,637
so all this flaming water
is now moving slowly downhill...

229
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,403
onto the steps of this doctor's office.

230
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,447
To make matters worse...

231
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:41,182
on the door of this doctor's office
is a pet flap.

232
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,480
Only, it's not a pet flap.

233
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,418
It's a little drop-off door...

234
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,481
where they drop off
stool and urine samples.

235
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,526
But all I know is this flaming water...

236
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:54,587
is pouring through the stool-sample door
of this doctor's office.

237
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,032
$18,000 in damages.

238
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,569
Wilder lost his job.

239
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,506
He never yelled at me though.

240
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,377
That's when
the Department of Corrections...

241
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,184
gave me this two-pound fashion statement
to wear.

242
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:23,385
- But it comes off tomorrow.
- Comes off tomorrow.

243
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,696
Which one of you sent me
the wedding photo?

244
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:35,734
- Wilder sent you our wedding picture?
- Yeah, it figures.

245
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,796
He would twist the knife.

246
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,612
- There's no knife.
- Why wasn't I told about your house arrest?

247
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,944
The same reason
he didn't say you rolled into town.

248
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,779
-It's Wilder.
- Wilder's a schmuck.

249
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,315
I don't know why he hates me.
Why does he hate me?

250
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,654
Why don't you start with burning off his hair
at his bachelor party?

251
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,660
- He told you that?
- Yeah.

252
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,322
- He could have fought back.
- Oh, God!

253
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,268
Light me.

254
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:13,701
What?

255
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,943
- Light my cigarette.
- No, I can't do that.

256
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,040
Not without burning your face off.

257
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,946
Not while I'm looking at you.

258
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:27,618
- You know, when I think about you--
- Yeah, well, Wilder can do it.

259
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:47,606
<i>I'm gonna go on The David Letterman Show.</i>

260
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:52,112
I know someone
who's the head of booking for the show...

261
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,945
and I'm gonna go on.

262
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,753
I'm gonna burn some stuff on the air,
parlay some publicity...

263
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,984
maybe get myself a movie deal
or my own TV show.

264
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,353
And commercials?
A lot of money in commercials.

265
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,597
I can sell lighter fluid, radar ranges,
flame-broiled Whoppers.

266
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:17,172
You know, being able to burn stuff
with your mind is a God-given talent.

267
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:20,002
Just like being able
to slam-dunk a basketball.

268
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,978
The American public will eat it up.
I love being able to do it.

269
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:30,080
It's a damn shame
to waste a God-given talent all your life.

270
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,284
I don't disagree.

271
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,826
You see, I knew you'd say that.

272
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:45,698
I told you five years ago
you married the wrong guy.

273
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,019
<i>Mon frére!</i>

274
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,265
Hey, honey.

275
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,227
Did you bring the men home
for some lemonade?

276
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,431
Yeah.

277
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,732
Catch me, men.

278
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,576
Heads up.

279
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,776
I'm all over!

280
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,450
I think she's put on a couple of pounds.

281
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:55,295
<i>Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl</i>

282
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,633
<i>As I walk through this world</i>

283
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,643
<i>Nothing can stop the Duke of Earl</i>

284
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,851
<i>And you, you are my girl</i>

285
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:15,147
<i>No one can hurt you, oh no</i>

286
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,853
<i>Yes, I'm</i>

287
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:25,361
<i>Nothing can stop me now</i>

288
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,570
<i>'Cause I'm the Duke of Ear!</i>

289
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,366
<i>And when I hold you</i>

290
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,206
<i>You'll be my Duchess</i>

291
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,442
<i>my Duchess of Earl</i>

292
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:44,453
<i>And we'll walk through my dukedom</i>

293
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:47,615
<i>And a paradise we will share</i>

294
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,750
<i>Yes</i>

295
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,393
<i>I'm gonna love you</i>

296
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,199
<i>Come on let me hold you darlin'</i>

297
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:02,102
<i>'Cause I'm the Duke of Ear!</i>

298
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,522
<i>Yes, I'm</i>

299
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:30,826
<i>Come on let me hold you darlin'</i>

300
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:34,834
<i>'Cause I'm the Duke of Ear!</i>

301
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,157
That's the same car you had five years ago.

302
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,695
<i>Mon frére?</i>

303
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:07,701
That's the same car you had five years ago.

304
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,132
Yeah.

305
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,677
What's wrong with it?

306
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:23,017
It's the...

307
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,288
I don't know.

308
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,226
At least you got it up on blocks.

309
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,694
That's a real hip white-trash aesthetic.

310
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:37,555
Neighbors must be real jealous
you thought of it first.

311
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:45,198
Seems this car's an analogy to your life.
It ain't going nowhere neither.

312
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,270
Now, that's deep.

313
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,340
Bozo, is it?

314
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,654
Look, why are you here?

315
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,753
Why aren't you over
comparing herpes sores...

316
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:08,457
with that Algonquian roundtable
of shitheads you run with?

317
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,267
Why are you back in town?

318
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:16,169
Why are you sitting on my front porch
drinking out of my glass?

319
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,764
What makes you think you're welcome?

320
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,484
I came here to tell you that I'm going public.

321
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,620
<i>I'm gonna flame some stuff
on The David Letterman Show.</i>

322
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,958
What?

323
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:53,637
- Are you insane?
- Yeah! See, I knew you'd say that!

324
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,372
What's wrong with that idea?

325
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:01,315
Well, for starters, you'd be a freak.

326
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:05,611
Guys in wingtip shoes
would shove a probe up your ass...

327
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:09,283
stick you out on an Indian reservation
in the middle of the Mojave Desert...

328
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:11,520
and read you like a petri dish.

329
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,994
You read Fine-starter, didn't you?

330
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:20,662
They'll try to link you
to every fire going up the East Coast...

331
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,398
back to Horace Braintree's clubhouse.

332
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,633
Here we go
with Horace Braintree's clubhouse!

333
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:28,268
We were little kids! Nobody cares anymore!

334
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,404
Not even Horace freaking Braintree,
who last time I heard...

335
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:34,006
has an ex-cheerleader wife,
his own Buick dealership...

336
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,641
and a bunch of chubby little kids...

337
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,687
he takes off to karate class every Saturday!

338
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,822
Anyway, I'm doing it!

339
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,393
I'm going on Letterman!

340
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,897
I don't believe any
of your paranoid bullshit anymore!

341
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:54,969
And I figure I'd like to try being rich
for a change.

342
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:58,136
So I'll just see you in the funny papers.

343
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,267
I'll see you later, Vida.

344
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:09,410
<i>They're gonna put me in the movies</i>

345
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:13,245
<i>they're gonna make a big star out of me</i>

346
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:18,760
<i>They're gonna put me in the movies</i>

347
00:45:19,617 --> 00:45:22,621
<i>and all I gotta do ls act</i>

348
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:33,139
Did you hear the one about the carny
who committed oral sex on a chicken?

349
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,642
Well, he...

350
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,137
Take me up to the top.

351
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:24,625
What you figure? That brother of his?

352
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,588
All I know is...

353
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,625
I'm gonna get off the road and on TV...

354
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:34,159
or I'm gonna goddamn kill somebody.

355
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,677
I'm ready!

356
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,414
God, I'm sorry, Lloyd! I'm sorry!

357
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:06,011
It's just a little blood.
You'll come in, you'll be fine.

358
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:22,893
I'm free!

359
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:37,003
My debt to society is paid in full.

360
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,648
It's 12:47 and 23 seconds.

361
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:53,823
Time to screw. Let's do it in the booth.

362
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,229
- You're not serious.
- Yes, I really am.

363
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,671
Let's just find some hedges or something.

364
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,801
Baby, I'm raring to go!

365
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:11,745
- I know you are, honey, but...
- What?

366
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,505
No?

367
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:19,685
All right.

368
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:23,721
Let's go for a walk.
It's been a year since I went for a walk.

369
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,655
Come on. Out of that shoebox.

370
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:30,722
I'm waiting for a surprise visit
from my supervisor.

371
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:32,768
Don't want to lose my job.

372
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:48,108
So?

373
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:54,888
All right. What are we gonna
do tonight then?

374
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,322
Well, you know.

375
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,728
I'm calling bingo for the Women's Auxiliary.

376
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,955
It'll be great.

377
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,765
Maybe you'll come with me,
win us some money.

378
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:08,997
Bingo?

379
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,171
Wilder, no.

380
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,507
No symphony?

381
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,579
No dinner theater? Bingo?

382
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:21,738
I was supposed to call bingo last week
and I didn't go.

383
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,885
I mean, how many times have I missed...

384
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:28,079
because you didn't want me to leave?

385
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,388
And now tonight
you don't have to stay home.

386
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,926
Besides, the car isn't running.
You can't walk to a symphony.

387
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:43,770
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing.

388
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:49,710
I just had a quick flash
about the rest of my life, that's all.

389
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,641
I'll see you later, honey.

390
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:02,651
Sorry.

391
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,973
- Hi, Dick. Hi, Nick.
- Hi, Vida.

392
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,971
Who are you?

393
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,936
You found my dog!

394
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:00,110
Yeah, or vice versa.

395
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,406
Or vice versa.

396
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,019
So are you gonna explain the tie
or do I just have to guess?

397
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,885
Oh, it's no big deal.

398
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:13,190
I just happened to fall into two tickets
to this chamber-music thing...

399
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,890
they're doing downtown this afternoon.

400
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,334
You're a real shit, Wallace.

401
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:22,768
Yes, I am.

402
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:28,540
Come on! Ride up front with me!

403
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,772
Nope! I can't be inside today.

404
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,283
I do love Beethoven.

405
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:15,951
Mozart.

406
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,023
I love Beethoven.

407
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:27,168
Where to now?

408
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:31,137
I appreciate it,
but Wilder's gonna be mad as it is.

409
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:32,868
I better get home.

410
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:36,103
I'm sorry. Did you say
you wanted to see some fireworks?

411
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:57,451
Thirty-two years is an awfully long time
to keep a secret.

412
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:04,657
So, what was it that made you decide
to go public?

413
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,573
<i>8-12,.</i>

414
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,191
Good thing I didn't aim.

415
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,042
- So, anyway you were saying...
- Was I?

416
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:58,848
- Don't laugh.
- Don't say anything funny.

417
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:03,387
I mean, it's not much of a story, really.

418
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,291
The carnival was in Frostproof, Florida...

419
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,694
we weren't doing much business.

420
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:10,557
It was raining...

421
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:14,065
and I was watching Bewitched
on a bootleg cable box.

422
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:21,033
Now, on Bewitched,
what does Darrin always say?

423
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:24,973
"Sam, honey, don't use your magic powers
to make us rich or happy...

424
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:26,742
"or to improve our sex lives.

425
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:30,080
"In fact, don't use them at all,
it would be wrong."

426
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,713
And I realized that I'm watching this
on a crappy foam mattress...

427
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:36,758
I'm eating cereal straight out of the box...

428
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,617
and I'm alone.

429
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:43,423
And that's when it finally hit me.

430
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:46,468
Wrong? What's so wrong about it?

431
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,460
And the more I watched...

432
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:54,299
the more I realized
that Darrin reminded me of somebody...

433
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,708
and that somebody was Wilder...

434
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,338
and Sam reminded me of me.

435
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,508
That I wasn't living up to my full potential.

436
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:12,420
And then Bewitched ended
and <i>I</i> Dream of Jeannie came on...

437
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,561
and I figured it was some kind of a sign.

438
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:22,837
So here I am.

439
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:34,007
<i>6-47,.</i>

440
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:16,152
What are you doing?

441
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,758
I'm helping you with your shot.

442
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:22,956
Who are you, Andy Hardy?

443
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:26,023
Helping me with my shot?
Gee, that's original.

444
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,608
You're not keeping your wrists locked.

445
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:55,191
Where'd you get this move, Wallace?
A Nelson Eddy movie?

446
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,093
What is it?

447
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,125
Come on!

448
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,761
Hurry up! Come on!

449
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,778
<i>B-'H.</i>

450
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:04,688
<i>I fell into a burning ring of fire</i>

451
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:09,390
<i>I went down, down, down
and the flames went higher</i>

452
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,592
<i>and it bums, bums, bums</i>

453
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:18,062
<i>that ring of fire, that ring of fire</i>

454
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,890
Back up!

455
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:04,338
<i>I don't want to set the world</i>

456
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:08,139
<i>on fire</i>

457
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:13,720
<i>I just want to start</i>

458
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:18,321
<i>A flame in your heart</i>

459
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:25,494
<i>In my heart! have but one</i>

460
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:29,464
<i>desire</i>

461
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:34,440
<i>And that one is you</i>

462
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:39,169
<i>No other will do</i>

463
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:45,410
<i>I've lost all ambition</i>

464
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:48,046
<i>for worldly acclaim</i>

465
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:52,454
<i>I just want to be the one you love</i>

466
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:55,922
<i>And with your admission</i>

467
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,625
<i>that you feel the same</i>

468
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:02,267
<i>I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of</i>

469
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,236
Believe me

470
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,969
<i>I don't want to set the world</i>

01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:12,370

<i>A flame in your heart</i>

474
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,926
See you later, Wilder.

475
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:11,650
Can you hear me?

476
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,854
I know what you're thinking!

477
01:09:17,053 --> 01:09:18,930
We didn't do anything!

478
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:21,293
We didn't do it!

479
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:36,507
Say something!

480
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,260
Okay.

481
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:08,442
This is good.

482
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:10,978
It's morning, it's sunny.

483
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,569
We're gonna eat breakfast...

484
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,749
and then we need to sit down and talk.

485
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:19,111
The three of us.

486
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:23,018
We've all made mistakes.
We need to get things out in the open.

487
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:26,457
We need to establish a dialogue.
We need to talk about our feelings.

488
01:11:26,516 --> 01:11:29,326
Got any cereal?

489
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:36,364
Wilder is repressing his emotions.
He always represses his emotions.

490
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:40,469
I think if the three of us
could just put our problems into words...

491
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,066
just verbalize...

492
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:45,911
Get off that goddamn mower, now!

493
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:52,245
I made your breakfast! You come and get it!

494
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:01,055
I'm talking to you!

495
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:10,902
Stop it!

496
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,600
Do something!

497
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:24,243
All right, look.

498
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,777
This is me. This is the way I feel right now.

499
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:33,245
It's early. I'm tired.
I didn't get any sleep last night.

500
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,479
I was with your wife.

501
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,648
I'm eating your breakfast.

502
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:44,998
So come on, take a swing at me, please?
And let's get this thing over with.

503
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,801
Come on, you freaking iceman.

504
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:02,610
Okay then, it's official now.

505
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:07,253
You're a frightened coward.

506
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:38,082
Sorry, pissant clown!

507
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:41,378
Think you can mess around with my wife?

508
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:49,092
Don't! No!

509
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,640
You're dead, white boy!

510
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:13,949
Let's go pick out a nice wreath for you
because you're freaking dead!

511
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:30,237
All right! Stop it now!

512
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:33,836
Both of you! I live here, damn it!

513
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,875
What do you want to do?
You want to kill each other?

514
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,744
Thought that's what you wanted.

515
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:49,479
Your shoe's on fire.

516
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:54,388
Who's the white boy now?

517
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:35,869
Dirty, mud-hopping rat bastard!

518
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:42,901
Come out and fight
like the freak of nature you are...

519
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:45,411
or I'm coming in there to get you!

520
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:14,306
Let's say, for once in our lives,
that we have us a fair fight!

521
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:17,874
Flame me, boy! Burn my hair off!

522
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,407
Give me a reason to barbecue you!

523
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:22,908
Stop it!

524
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:27,486
- Wait until I get my hands on...
- Your ass is ash, Wilder!

525
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,885
Nobody's ass is anything! Do you hear me?

526
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:33,859
Nobody's ass is anything!
You boys come out of there now!

527
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:35,554
Hi, this is Vida Foudroyant.

528
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:37,962
We have another one
of those little situations here.

529
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,466
Okay, boy! Here it comes!

530
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:41,790
Run!

531
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:47,674
Are you okay?

532
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:53,809
You Okay?

533
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,492
Use your powers for once in your life!

534
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,552
Use them, you pussy!

535
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,392
Quit it.

536
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,242
Oh, my God! There's fire by the--

537
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:32,378
I'm coming! I'm okay! Everything's fine.

538
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,054
I'm sorry.

539
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,927
- What for?
- I'm talking to Wilder.

540
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:52,058
I'm sorry I was with your brother
on the roof.

541
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:56,232
It was a bad course of action on my part.

542
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:59,333
I know I came between you two.

543
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,671
I'm sorry I broke your trust.

544
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:11,684
I guess what I did was sort of reactionary.

545
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,184
I mean, yesterday
was my first night of freedom...

546
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:16,587
and you had to spend it calling bingo.

547
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:20,059
Now, don't get me wrong, bingo's great.

548
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:22,857
Normally, I'd say bingo's where it's at.

549
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:28,059
I guess I just got a little crazy. I got selfish.

550
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,328
I figured I'd steal you away...

551
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:34,533
from squinting at
a bunch of Ping-Pong balls all night.

552
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:39,409
I figured I'd get you out on the town
for once, for one night of real life.

553
01:20:40,703 --> 01:20:45,550
One night of freedom from that
country-western version of a Soviet gulag.

554
01:20:55,451 --> 01:20:57,954
Wilder, are you gonna say something?

555
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:01,729
You screwed my brother over bingo?

556
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:14,341
I think you're missing the big picture.

557
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:18,317
- You and I have very large problems.
- No shit.

558
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:20,611
No shit, Wilder.

559
01:21:22,778 --> 01:21:24,815
I'm tired of doing it all.

560
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:28,556
I'm tired of coming at you all the time.

561
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:33,590
And I'm tired of always having to be
the happiest person in a room.

562
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:37,503
What does he mean
you screwed me over bingo?

563
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:40,472
There was no screwing.
No screwing occurred.

564
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:43,009
Only because Zippy the Pinhead here
showed up.

565
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:46,239
- There wouldn't have been any.
- The hell there wouldn't have been.

566
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:49,111
We were gearing up
for some world-class screwing.

567
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:52,914
We were gonna do something
they haven't even invented a word for yet.

568
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:56,616
- Don't lie.
-It's a moot point.

569
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:01,851
"Moot point"? Jeez, good answer, honey.

570
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:05,259
"Did she or didn't she? It's a moot point.

571
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:08,927
"Pardon me while I go mow the lawn."
God! Why are you with him?

572
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:11,528
Just shut the hell up, Wallace. Okay?

573
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,746
Rm in jail again.

574
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,583
I'm free one day and I'm in jail again.

575
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,249
This is unbelievable.

576
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:33,215
I don't even belong here.

577
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,662
You started those two fires.

578
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:38,531
- Me?
- Yeah.

579
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:41,431
Honey, I do not live in a vacuum.

580
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:45,666
I think we all three share equal blame
for the day's unpleasantries.

581
01:22:47,863 --> 01:22:50,844
I didn't do shit.

582
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,506
I'm clean.

583
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:57,583
I spent all night putting out some sex fire
that you two started.

584
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:02,453
This morning I've got her yelling,
"Do something," at me.

585
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:06,653
I've got you practically wearing my slippers,
smoking my pipe.

586
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:09,327
You burned down my house,
you wrecked my life...

587
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:13,855
you steal my wife, and you two want me
to accept part of the blame?

588
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:17,135
I'm speaking only for myself, Wilder...

589
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:20,571
but, yeah, I think that would be
the big thing to do.

590
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,237
Fuck you both.

591
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,880
I take that as a no.

592
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:34,008
Have no fear, the cavalry's here.

593
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,319
Have no fear, the cavalry's here.

594
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:40,187
Couldn't let my premier attraction
just sit here with the riffraff.

595
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:43,458
I appreciate it, Rex. I really do.

596
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:47,130
- Just one thing.
- Anything, boy. You name it.

597
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:49,795
Steak dinner?
You want to borrow my sedan?

598
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,031
Some shirt of mine you been admiring?

599
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:55,940
I don't want to be bailed out
unless you bail her out, too.

600
01:23:57,466 --> 01:24:00,208
We're still thinking about Hollywood,
ain't we, boss?

601
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:02,806
Every minute of every day.

602
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:06,275
You're gonna bail me out?

603
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:08,546
Yeah.

604
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:15,718
We had to put the Ferris wheel up
for collateral just to cover your bond.

605
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:17,229
You sure about doing this?

606
01:24:17,286 --> 01:24:21,701
I mean, I know this girl in Tampa,
same hair color, same bone structure.

607
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,006
You're right.

608
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,042
She's worth the Loop-The-Loop.

609
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:32,305
Hell, she's worth whatever it takes.

610
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:38,516
Mrs. Foudroyanfs just lucky
the judge gave her a bond at all.

611
01:24:44,146 --> 01:24:46,490
It surprised the hell out of me.

612
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,925
I'm not gonna go
unless you bail out Wilder, too.

613
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,067
All right, bail him out, too.

614
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:04,807
There goes the shooting gallery.

615
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,790
Okay, come on, Wilder.

616
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:23,625
Come on, we're getting out of here,
you, me, and Wallace.

617
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:26,097
Me? Leave with you two?

618
01:25:27,022 --> 01:25:29,195
That makes no sense to me whatsoever.

619
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:33,535
I mean, I can't think of two people
I hate more in the world.

620
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,538
What part of that didn't you understand?

621
01:25:44,673 --> 01:25:45,879
You win.

622
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:51,287
I made a big mistake.

623
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:56,254
I let myself be suckered
by your brother, right?

624
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,863
By the summer night...

625
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:04,136
and by the need to want to be loved by you.

626
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:09,937
When you weren't there again,
by the need to be loved by anyone.

627
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:16,011
I know you think
these mistakes are unforgivable...

628
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:18,747
and you may be right.

629
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:23,150
But let me tell you something...

630
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:26,819
on the one-in-a-million chance
that you're wrong...

631
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:32,023
on the one-in-a-million chance that
you're gonna wake up tomorrow morning...

632
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:33,794
and want me back...

633
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,498
you're gonna have to fight for me, Wilder.

634
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:47,739
<i>Why did you leave me here all alone?</i>

635
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:52,310
<i>I searched the world over
and thought I'd found true love</i>

636
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:56,247
<i>but you found another and you was gone</i>

637
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:03,689
What did he say
when you gave him the notes?

638
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:07,784
He didn't say anything.
He wasn't there, so I put them in the slot.

639
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,093
What do you mean, he wasn't there?

640
01:28:10,152 --> 01:28:12,723
Vida, you got to give the guy a little time.

641
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:16,600
I mean, no offense,
but when a man's lost his home...

642
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:20,538
and his wife in the same day,
he's bound to be a little unpredictable.

643
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,768
He's gonna come back
to the booth eventually...

644
01:28:22,831 --> 01:28:26,176
and when he does, he'll find the notes.
Trust me.

645
01:28:49,191 --> 01:28:50,670
Cover for me.

646
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:32,972
- Was she with him?
- Not that I saw.

647
01:29:33,902 --> 01:29:36,212
Hell, he looked totally lost to me.

648
01:29:37,973 --> 01:29:40,510
Maybe he thinks she's still with me.

649
01:29:43,612 --> 01:29:46,422
Rex, I think I'm gonna take a pass
on tonight's show.

650
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:50,623
I need to save my strength
for a little unfinished family business.

651
01:29:52,287 --> 01:29:53,527
And, Rex...

652
01:29:54,022 --> 01:29:56,525
I want you to make
as much money as you can tonight...

653
01:29:56,591 --> 01:30:01,404
'cause tomorrow morning we're gonna
pack up and head for Hollywood, California.

654
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:03,833
You got it, Dr. Napalm.

655
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:26,118
Looks like we might need
that elephant again.

656
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:40,563
I'm calling you out!

657
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,531
Well, this is a surprise.

658
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:51,271
Did hell freeze over or what?

659
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,145
Where's Vida?

660
01:32:53,535 --> 01:32:56,072
Out buying more condoms. Why?

661
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:12,531
Where's Vida?

662
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:16,926
Actually, she's over at the hospital
being treated for thigh chafe.

663
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,269
Once you've had a clown,
you never go back.

664
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:48,267
Where's Vida?

665
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:52,196
She's over at the Sunoco restroom
vaselining up her body...

666
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:54,740
so she can squeeze into one of these...

667
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:57,436
the official Dr. Napalm assistant suit.

668
01:33:57,499 --> 01:33:59,604
Soon to be "as seen on TV."

669
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:10,419
I'm fighting for you, baby!

670
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:18,093
Get some fire extinguishers!
Get the power back on!

671
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:23,534
I'm gonna ask you one last time,
where's Vida?

672
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:27,337
Look outside, asshole.

673
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:41,779
That's for my pickup truck.

674
01:34:41,943 --> 01:34:44,719
And as for your sorry excuse for a wife...

675
01:34:45,313 --> 01:34:50,160
Vida's not here,
'cause she's a loser, just like you.

676
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:59,197
You're going on TV over my dead body.

677
01:34:59,594 --> 01:35:01,904
Ruin my home. Ruin my marriage.

678
01:35:02,163 --> 01:35:05,701
I'll be damned
if you're gonna ruin the rest of my life.

679
01:35:05,967 --> 01:35:08,538
You self-hating freak.

680
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:14,152
It's a gift...

681
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:17,951
not a curse.

682
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:31,166
And you don't deserve it. Just like
you don't deserve that woman you're with.

683
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:34,366
- Don't tell me what I do--
<i>- I'll</i> tell you whatever I like!

684
01:35:34,429 --> 01:35:38,138
Ever since we were kids,
ever since Horace Braintree's clubhouse...

685
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:41,373
when you convinced yourself
and damn-near convinced me...

686
01:35:41,436 --> 01:35:44,280
that we were murderers,
you've dreaded who we are!

687
01:35:44,339 --> 01:35:46,546
We didn't do anything, Wilder.

688
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:50,315
We didn't know that man was in there!
We were little kids!

689
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:57,727
Midlothian Shopping Center.
Multiple fires. Lord, what a day!

690
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:19,975
Look what that guy's doing
to our meal ticket.

691
01:36:22,143 --> 01:36:25,454
-It's gonna blow!
- Get the hell out of here! Come on.

692
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:36,763
Come on!

693
01:36:39,193 --> 01:36:40,866
Come on, sweetie!

694
01:38:01,743 --> 01:38:03,313
The doctor is in!

695
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:26,470
Get off of him. Get out of the way.

696
01:38:26,801 --> 01:38:30,180
Get out of that silly suit and stop this now!

697
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:33,842
My arm!

698
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:06,885
Oh, no. You think I killed him?

699
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,616
I might have killed him.

700
01:39:20,388 --> 01:39:22,061
Good shot, Wilder!

701
01:39:23,024 --> 01:39:24,628
Get back!

702
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:30,238
I'm not fighting you anymore, Wallace.

703
01:39:30,298 --> 01:39:32,642
There's no reason to fight anymore.

704
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:34,607
You win.

705
01:39:37,438 --> 01:39:39,042
Everybody knows.

706
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:42,445
You win.

707
01:39:45,546 --> 01:39:48,288
Don't give me that sanctimonious shit!

708
01:39:48,616 --> 01:39:50,823
It's over 'cause you say it's over?

709
01:39:51,085 --> 01:39:54,225
You don't get it, do you,
you passive-aggressive pissant?

710
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:57,064
You are not wiping away 32 years...

711
01:39:57,124 --> 01:39:59,695
of making me feel like a piece of crap...

712
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,263
simply because you choose not to fight!

713
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:05,342
Now get up and flame on!

714
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:20,255
I'm gonna take my wife for a spin
on the Tilt-A-Whirl.

715
01:40:20,314 --> 01:40:21,622
Want to come?

716
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:25,994
- What?
- I'm not fighting you.

717
01:40:29,891 --> 01:40:31,564
Then you're burning!

718
01:40:31,626 --> 01:40:33,367
Go!

719
01:40:35,663 --> 01:40:38,337
It's all right, folks. Everything's fine.

720
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,605
Don't run. Everything's under control.

721
01:40:54,282 --> 01:40:56,284
Okay, the Ferris wheel!

722
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:01,291
Okay!

723
01:41:18,406 --> 01:41:21,410
One way or the other, brother,
you're gonna burn!

724
01:41:26,681 --> 01:41:28,991
We are running out of places to go!

725
01:41:51,672 --> 01:41:53,709
All right, coming through.

726
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:58,690
All right, already.
So, who's got the bigger one?

727
01:41:58,746 --> 01:42:01,317
Biff the Clown, near as I can tell.

728
01:42:51,799 --> 01:42:52,834
Thanks.

729
01:42:54,135 --> 01:42:55,136
Yeah.

730
01:42:56,404 --> 01:42:59,248
Are you gonna walk over to those deputies?

731
01:43:06,313 --> 01:43:07,519
Me, too.

732
01:43:19,794 --> 01:43:20,932
Okay.

733
01:43:22,263 --> 01:43:23,674
Yeah, good.

734
01:43:50,157 --> 01:43:52,694
<i>And now a man who won't be offended,“...</i>

735
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:55,764
<i>if you call him an Amazon goddess...</i>

736
01:43:56,297 --> 01:43:59,301
<i>David Letterman!</i>

737
01:44:01,836 --> 01:44:04,510
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we were all terribly excited...</i>

738
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:06,313
<i>the last time our next guest was on...</i>

739
01:44:06,373 --> 01:44:07,579
Shoot! He's already on.

740
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:09,143
<i>Here he is, Dr. Napalm.</i>

741
01:44:11,879 --> 01:44:13,881
<i>Great to see you. How are you?</i>

742
01:44:13,948 --> 01:44:17,953
<i>How much time do you actually have left?
Is it four months until your parole?</i>

743
01:44:18,018 --> 01:44:22,091
<i>That's correct, David, four months,
provided I continue to behave.</i>

744
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:25,334
<i>And in the meantime,
my work-release program...</i>

745
01:44:25,392 --> 01:44:28,339
<i>sends me to hospital bum wards
and elementary schools, where L...</i>

746
01:44:28,395 --> 01:44:31,308
I really like his new Kingsford commercial.

747
01:44:32,066 --> 01:44:34,137
<i>Also, my various product endorsements...</i>

748
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:38,206
<i>have paid for the damage to property
I caused during my lawless period.</i>

749
01:44:38,472 --> 01:44:40,713
<i>And so I feel that the healing process...</i>

750
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:43,619
What time do you have to go back to work?

751
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:47,916
My last set doesn't start until 1:00.

752
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:36,570
<i>Whenever I'm with her</i>

753
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:39,338
<i>Something inside</i>

754
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,846
<i>Starts to b urn in'</i>

755
01:45:42,136 --> 01:45:45,447
<i>And I'm filled with desire</i>

756
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:47,749
<i>Could it be a devil in me</i>

757
01:45:47,808 --> 01:45:50,482
<i>or is this the way love': supposed to be?</i>

758
01:45:50,544 --> 01:45:52,581
<i>It's like a heat wave</i>

759
01:45:52,646 --> 01:45:54,922
<i>Burning in my heart</i>

760
01:45:55,216 --> 01:45:57,719
<i>I can't keep from cryin'</i>

761
01:45:57,852 --> 01:45:59,957
<i>It's tearin' me apart</i>

762
01:46:00,588 --> 01:46:02,932
Whenever she <i>calls my</i> name

763
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:06,460
<i>So slow, sweet and plain</i>

764
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:09,133
<i>Right then, right there</i>

765
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:11,767
<i>I feel that burnin' flame</i>

766
01:46:11,999 --> 01:46:14,479
<i>Has high blood pressure got a hold on me?</i>

767
01:46:14,535 --> 01:46:17,209
<i>or is this the way love': supposed to be?</i>

768
01:46:17,271 --> 01:46:19,251
<i>It's like a heat wave</i>

769
01:46:19,306 --> 01:46:21,616
<i>Burning in my heart</i>

770
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:24,516
<i>I can't keep from cryin'</i>

771
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:26,649
<i>It's tearing me apart</i>

772
01:46:44,231 --> 01:46:45,869
<i>Heat wave</i>

773
01:46:45,933 --> 01:46:48,504
Sometimes {stare in space

774
01:46:48,569 --> 01:46:51,778
<i>Tears all over my face</i>

775
01:46:51,839 --> 01:46:54,376
<i>Can't explain it, don't understand it</i>

776
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:57,149
<i>I ain't never felt like this before</i>

777
01:46:57,211 --> 01:46:59,851
<i>This funny feeling has me amazed</i>

778
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:02,360
<i>don't know what to do, my head's in a haze</i>

779
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:06,091
<i>It's like a heat wave</i>

780
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:08,598
<i>Well, it's all right, girl</i>

781
01:47:09,123 --> 01:47:10,932
<i>go ahead, girl</i>

782
01:47:11,492 --> 01:47:16,100
<i>Well, it's all right, girl
Ain't nothing but love, girl</i>

783
01:47:16,163 --> 01:47:19,076
<i>Don't pass up this chance</i>

784
01:47:19,133 --> 01:47:21,409
<i>This time ifs true romance</i>

785
01:47:21,468 --> 01:47:23,470
<i>It's like a heat wave</i>

786
01:47:24,872 --> 01:47:27,910
<i>Burning, burning, burning, yeah</i>

787
01:47:28,142 --> 01:47:30,144
<i>- Heat wave

788
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:33,214
<i>Burning, burning, burning, yeah</i>
