1
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:26,615
(dramatic music)

2
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:25,084
- Gentlemen, gentlemen please.

3
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:27,251
You must take your places.

4
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:29,192
Gentlemen.

5
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:35,904
- Ha ha, here's to us before we go

6
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:39,399
and take that village down below.

7
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,232
- Enough.

8
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:45,618
Get to your places or
we'll never be on our way.

9
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:48,973
This is not a time for
drunken celebration.

10
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:51,800
- Your Grace, we always
celebrate before a raid

11
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,687
and we always drink when we do.

12
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:56,520
- Shut up, you insect.

13
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:01,439
This is no game we play.

14
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,559
This painting shall be my legacy,

15
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:08,835
a record of the beginning
of my reign of greatness.

16
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:11,418
I think this is my better side.

17
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:14,741
Shh,

18
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:17,806
did you hear it?

19
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:21,177
It's the calm before the storm.

20
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,092
We shall reach down into
that village of weakness

21
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:26,605
and pull from it that
which will make me the most

22
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,688
powerful man on the earth

23
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,178
The jewel of Polaris.

24
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:37,629
We shall turn that village
inside out until we find it.

25
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:42,863
When I have the jewel of
Polaris I will be invincible.

26
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:46,712
(laughing)

27
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:52,921
- Your Grace.

28
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:57,501
I have heard Darbin, the great magician...

29
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:00,631
- Okay.

30
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:02,631
- Lives in that village.

31
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:09,033
He's said to be the most
powerful wizard in all the land.

32
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:12,088
Are we not to be afraid
of him, Master Falco?

33
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:15,505
- You dare speak his name in my presence.

34
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:21,040
For speaking that name
and for doubting my power

35
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,694
your punishment shall
be to never speak again.

36
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:25,527
- No, no.

37
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:37,115
- And for any other doubters
now or in the future

38
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:39,682
the punishment shall be even more severe.

39
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:40,515
Artist,

40
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:45,401
a little smaller on the nose I think.

41
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,568
How long we gonna be here?

42
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,449
- Stillness is a virtue, Your Grace,

43
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,032
and patience is its own reward.

44
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,246
- You seem different.

45
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:05,109
Yesterday you were much taller

46
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,236
and thinner.

47
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,523
Guards,

48
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:14,773
seize this man.

49
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,664
- It's Darbin.

50
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:25,164
- You are foolish to challenge me old man.

51
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:34,256
- The jewel of Polaris.

52
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:38,706
- You have perpetrated
evil far too long Falco.

53
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:43,264
I will now send you where
you can do harm to no one.

54
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:47,431
I send you and your shameless
cohorts into the prison

55
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:49,772
of this canvas.

56
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:51,521
- No.

57
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:21,388
(thunder and lightning)

58
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:44,848
(coughing)

59
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:56,154
- I will try to protect you

60
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:58,237
and all who reside herein

61
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:00,417
with

62
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,542
the jewel of Polaris.

63
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,689
(animal noises)

64
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,883
(coughing)

65
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:09,809
(dramatic music)

66
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:52,016
For so long the jewel of
Polaris has been desired

67
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,016
by evil men.

68
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:58,089
Please protect this treasure.

69
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,540
Only allow a pure individual,

70
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,072
one worthy of its power

71
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:05,655
to ever possess it.

72
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:33,271
- Can't five minutes go by
without you annoying me?

73
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,217
- What's your problem?

74
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,147
- You're my problem you little stain.

75
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:37,730
- Look, I finished.

76
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,909
- Sorry, but it's raining outside.

77
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,851
- So, go up to your sty.

78
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,520
- Can't, carpet's mean on the blade

79
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,037
and besides dad's up there.

80
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:50,063
- Of course you never do
anything that might annoy him.

81
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:53,102
- Why annoy him when I can irritate you?

82
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:55,119
- You spoiled little brat.

83
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,097
- Toro, toro.

84
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:57,427
- Get out of here.

85
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:58,971
- Missed me again.

86
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:01,888
Face it Kim, you throw like a girl.

87
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:07,383
- You got that part right,
flat as a pancake brother.

88
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:09,665
Now are you gonna stop
annoying me or do I need

89
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:10,677
to get rough?

90
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:14,260
- Rough, rough, rough,
rough, rough, rough.

91
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:16,978
- Is there a problem?

92
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,142
- No.

93
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:23,005
- Good, let's go then.

94
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:26,596
- You're lucky dad came down when he did.

95
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:28,433
I had you right where I wanted you.

96
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,068
- Yeah, you wish.

97
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:31,478
I can't believe I have to babysit you two.

98
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:33,107
- Who you callin' a baby?

99
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:34,757
- I'm not a baby.

100
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:37,331
- I know you're not a baby,
Casey, but you weren't

101
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,585
egging them on were you?

102
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,517
- No, I don't like it when they fight.

103
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:43,491
I just like the loose change
they drop on the ground.

104
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:45,741
Cleared 65 cents this time.

105
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,930
- Not too bad.

106
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,513
(gentle music)

107
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:15,857
Okay, here we are kids.

108
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:16,690
- Bye dad.

109
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,523
- Bye hon.

110
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:18,781
- Bye dad.

111
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,984
The museum closes at eight, don't be late.

112
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:21,943
- Take care of the kids for me.

113
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:24,681
- Don't worry dad, everything will be fine

114
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:26,931
unless Ben drives me to it.

115
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,992
- You don't have your roller
blades in there, do you?

116
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:38,601
- No way dad.

117
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:40,475
You know it's against the
rules to skate in the Museum.

118
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:41,767
Kim would kill me.

119
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,344
Art supplies.

120
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:44,875
- Art supplies.

121
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:45,875
- Later dad.

122
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:06,232
- Okay, here's the deal, freak.

123
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:08,886
I like my job at the
museum and I wanna keep it.

124
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:11,372
So, you go do your art report and try not

125
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:13,032
to embarrass me or get me fired.

126
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:13,865
Got it?

127
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:15,685
- Got it.

128
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:19,899
- Hello Kim.

129
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,538
- Hi Monty.

130
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:22,840
- Who's your pretty tag along.

131
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,409
- My sister, Casey.

132
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:26,246
- Nice to meet you Casey, I'm Monty.

133
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:27,163
- Hi Monty.

134
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,154
- You must be Ben.

135
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:33,641
Are you the artist in the family?

136
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:36,158
- The struggling artist.

137
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:37,285
- Keep practicing.

138
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:39,202
One day your pictures might
end up on the walls here

139
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,068
at the museum.

140
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:40,901
- You think so?

141
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:42,515
- Sure.

142
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:43,764
- Hey, could we order a pizza?

143
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:45,477
- Yeah, pizza, pizza.

144
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:46,728
- We'll see.

145
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:50,005
As long as you two keep out of trouble.

146
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:51,999
- Sure, no problem.

147
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,706
- Ben, you need to watch over Casey.

148
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:55,204
She's your responsibility.

149
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:56,236
- No way, I got my own plans.

150
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,105
- Ben, I mean it.

151
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:58,880
- I got my own plans too.

152
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,699
- Ben, you two stick together.

153
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,497
I don't have time to come looking for you.

154
00:14:02,497 --> 00:14:04,523
- All right, all right,
we'll stay together.

155
00:14:04,523 --> 00:14:08,690
Just in case we get separated
we have these walkie talkies.

156
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:12,790
- Real handful, huh?

157
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,295
Don't worry, I'll check on
'em when I make my rounds.

158
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,973
- Thanks, I'm sure
everything will be fine.

159
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:18,806
- Bye bye.

160
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:19,639
- Bye.

161
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:23,955
(dramatic music)

162
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:48,694
- The evil Falco depicted in the center

163
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:51,379
of the painting at right.

164
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:53,694
Lived in the mid 1600's.

165
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:57,093
A practitioner of alchemy
and witchcraft, Falco

166
00:14:57,093 --> 00:14:58,995
and his band of outlaws crossed Europe

167
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:02,822
raiding the countryside
pillaging religious artifacts

168
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:05,098
believed to bring good fortune.

169
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:06,596
- Scary looking.

170
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:08,398
- Everything scares you.

171
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:09,300
- Look at that one, Ben.

172
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,550
The painter forgot to finish his mouth.

173
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:18,489
- Freaky looking.

174
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:21,239
The village painting at the left,

175
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:26,380
Kaya del Sol was said
to be the last village

176
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,547
raided by Falco before his
mysterious disappearance in 1632.

177
00:15:31,943 --> 00:15:34,342
- Where do you think Falco disappeared to?

178
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:35,592
- I don't know.

179
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,072
- Got you lookin'.

180
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,167
- You scared the shit outta me.

181
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,284
- Everything scares Ben.

182
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:46,034
- Speakin' of scary, take a look.

183
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,898
I swear when we first got this painting

184
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:56,731
Falco's hat was in his other hand.

185
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,405
I figure this painting's haunted.

186
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:03,721
How about I show you a nicer exhibit?

187
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:06,197
Probably something more
to your taste, Casey.

188
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:07,101
What do you say?

189
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:07,934
- Yeah.

190
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,267
- Yeah, come on.

191
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:17,606
Now these paintings aren't
as scary as the ones

192
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,849
in the Falco room.

193
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:22,706
You know, when I just look
at these I get all inspired.

194
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:24,449
- I like them, too.

195
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,190
- Okay, well look.

196
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,872
I have to finish my rounds
so I'll see you two in a bit.

197
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:30,374
- Okay, bye Monty.

198
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:31,207
- Bye bye.

199
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,148
- Yeah, I'm inspired, too.

200
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:43,065
- Put those on and you're
destined for trouble.

201
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:48,807
(dramatic music)

202
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,482
(thunder and lightning)

203
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,925
My magician is a good magician.

204
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:09,879
He can make the storm go away

205
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:12,417
or make that mean Falco guy reappear,

206
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,892
but as a nice person this time.

207
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:17,917
He could change anyone into anything.

208
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:19,323
- Well, he can't turn me
into someone who cares,

209
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:20,156
now can he?

210
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:23,654
- You aren't leaving
me alone are you, Ben?

211
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:26,354
- Sorry C, but I gotta check
out that Falco painting again.

212
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:29,538
- But, it's haunted Monty said.

213
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:33,168
- Oooo, the painting's alive, Oooo.

214
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:35,984
- Quit it, I'm not going back in there.

215
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:37,645
- You're on your own then.

216
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:38,645
Testing 123.

217
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:42,976
Bye baby sister.

218
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:45,475
The ghosts in the
painting are gonna get me.

219
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:46,308
Bye.

220
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:50,804
(dramatic music)

221
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,002
- Coffee break?

222
00:18:09,002 --> 00:18:10,585
- All right, Monty.

223
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:12,434
Thanks.

224
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:15,165
Did you find my little migraines?

225
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:16,150
- Yeah, yeah.

226
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,749
Casey's drawin' away,
but Ben he's already got

227
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:21,201
to the kingdom of boredom
I'm afraid to say.

228
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,854
- That's usually when he gets
himself in the most trouble.

229
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,185
He always seems to stick
his nose just deep enough

230
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,775
to get it broken off.

231
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:28,980
- Yeah.

232
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,480
- Or get me in trouble trying.

233
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:37,411
Maybe I should go and check on him.

234
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:38,791
I'll be back in five.

235
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,624
- Okay.

236
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,367
(thunder and lightning)

237
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:02,538
(dramatic music)

238
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,330
- Ben,

239
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,163
Ben,

240
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:19,250
Ben, where are you?

241
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,731
- Don't be such a baby.

242
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:22,814
I'll be back in a minute.

243
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:32,994
- Please save me M.

244
00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:37,922
M the Magnificent, he'll
be able to do anything.

245
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:42,089
I'll give him a big smile
so he can make people laugh.

246
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:48,349
(sound of laughter)

247
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:51,099
(dramatic music)

248
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,650
- Are you lookin' at me?

249
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,664
- Renaissance paintings, who cares?

250
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:38,914
That one sucks.

251
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:41,773
Modernism, don't get it.

252
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,728
Hmm, that's cool.

253
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:47,478
(dramatic music)

254
00:21:15,036 --> 00:21:17,433
Case, you gotta come see this now.

255
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:19,317
The paintings, they are haunted.

256
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:21,484
- You can't scare me, Ben.

257
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:26,866
- I'm serious, Casey.

258
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:30,616
There's something really
weird going on here.

259
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:38,122
Whoa, whoa.

260
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:40,731
- Hello, Ben.

261
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:47,089
(dramatic music)

262
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:24,038
(rumbling)

263
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:44,680
- Oh, ouch.

264
00:22:56,784 --> 00:22:57,701
Where am I?

265
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,228
- Yeah, they're flickering down here.

266
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:03,089
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
give us five minutes.

267
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,189
We'll have the lights back on, okay?

268
00:23:05,189 --> 00:23:06,341
- [Ghostly Voice] You comin' or what?

269
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,674
- Yeah, I'm on your way now.

270
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,741
Charlie, it's Monty.

271
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,917
Yes, how's it goin' down there?

272
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,667
(dramatic music)

273
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:30,738
How we doin' down there?

274
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:32,131
I've got some uneasy people up here.

275
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:33,823
- [Ghostly Voice] It's bad,
Monty, but I'll do what I can.

276
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:34,723
- Yeah, all right.

277
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:36,973
I'll make the announcement.

278
00:23:38,972 --> 00:23:39,805
- Ben.

279
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,093
Casey.

280
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,083
(dramatic music)

281
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,150
(laughter)

282
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:00,774
(rumbling)

283
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:07,336
Oh, oh.

284
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:08,419
Where are we?

285
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:12,834
What did you do this time?

286
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,802
- Nothing, what're you lookin' at me for?

287
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:16,097
- Because you did this.

288
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,351
- I was mindin' my own business.

289
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:20,684
- I don't know what you did, but

290
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:22,601
this is the last straw.

291
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:25,625
You are grounded for life.

292
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,536
- Hey, dad put you in
charge, so if anyone's

293
00:25:27,536 --> 00:25:28,551
gonna be grounded.

294
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:29,641
- I told you to stay with Casey.

295
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,733
I was working, but did you do that?

296
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:32,606
No.

297
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:33,439
- Yeah, but.

298
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:35,432
- I told you not to touch anything.

299
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:36,632
But, did you listen?

300
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:37,465
No.

301
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:38,298
- Kim.

302
00:25:38,298 --> 00:25:39,636
- You have no sense of
responsibility whatsoever.

303
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:41,171
- Kim.

304
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:42,004
- What?

305
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:44,664
- Do not turn around.

306
00:25:45,988 --> 00:25:47,488
- You there, stop.

307
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:50,544
- Run Ben.

308
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:57,955
- Stop.

309
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:02,143
(dramatic music)

310
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,447
- Whoa, this is too weird.

311
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,820
It's really scary.

312
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,110
(mumbling)

313
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,969
(dramatic music)

314
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,039
- Hello there speed racer.

315
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,989
- I think something bad happened to Ben.

316
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:53,249
- No, it's just a mean old storm.

317
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:55,832
Come on, let's go look for him.

318
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,959
- What will we tell Falco
if we can't find him?

319
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,376
- If we find nothing we tell him nothing.

320
00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:18,453
- If these guys don't hurt
you I promise you I will.

321
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:20,286
- Get a life, come on.

322
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,379
- What's going on?

323
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:39,212
What's happening?

324
00:27:39,212 --> 00:27:40,286
- I think we're inside the painting.

325
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:41,439
- What?

326
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:43,427
- Inside the painting, the
village landscape painting.

327
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:46,346
At the museum did you see
that painting of Falco?

328
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:48,871
All the men were gone

329
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:52,301
and I noticed smoke was comin'
from the village landscape.

330
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:53,134
Come on.

331
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,760
Those two dudes that were chasing us.

332
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,967
He must be Falco.

333
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:06,217
He hasn't been around since the 1600's.

334
00:28:10,795 --> 00:28:12,807
I don't know how, but
somehow this painting's alive

335
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:13,848
and we're inside of it.

336
00:28:13,848 --> 00:28:17,433
- Great, so you've shrunk
us to microscopic size.

337
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:19,732
Funny, I didn't think your
brain could get any smaller.

338
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,396
- But, I didn't do this, Kim.

339
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:22,917
When I got to the Falco room the painting

340
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:23,752
was already smoking.

341
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:24,683
I didn't do anything.

342
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,038
- Of course, it's always, I didn't do it.

343
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,197
- But, I really didn't.

344
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:28,030
- I don't care if you didn't do it.

345
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,406
You better undo it because
I want out of here now.

346
00:28:31,406 --> 00:28:33,489
(scream)

347
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:41,167
- Ben said the pictures were different,

348
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,885
then he started screaming

349
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:44,218
and that was it.

350
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:52,693
Look, Monty.

351
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:54,460
It is different.

352
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,460
All the people are gone.

353
00:28:57,478 --> 00:29:00,645
- I always knew this room was haunted.

354
00:29:03,526 --> 00:29:04,690
- Look Monty,

355
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,607
an earring.

356
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:08,306
Kim was here, too.

357
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:11,277
- Looks like it.

358
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:14,619
Don't worry, Casey.

359
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,401
Everything's gonna be all right.

360
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:18,464
I'm sure they'll be back soon.

361
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,993
I'm sure they're just tied up somewhere.

362
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,160
- Okay, Monty.

363
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:28,787
(dramatic music)

364
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,401
- You know, one of us
must have been adopted.

365
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,506
- Very funny.

366
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:38,401
- I'm serious.

367
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,773
There's no way we both
have the same genes.

368
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:43,588
- Believe it and weep,
baby, same gene pool

369
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:44,795
and you're from the shallow end.

370
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:45,628
- Ahhh.

371
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:48,114
- Silence child.

372
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:52,736
What are you doing here?

373
00:29:54,396 --> 00:29:57,340
Think you'll be able to find it here?

374
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,388
Think we, the proud people of this village

375
00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:03,031
would just bow down to
you and let you have it?

376
00:30:03,031 --> 00:30:04,853
- Are you talking to us?

377
00:30:04,853 --> 00:30:06,039
Is he talking to us?

378
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:06,872
- I don't know.

379
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:07,710
- Shut your mouths.

380
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,007
You tell Falco we won't
go quietly and we'll never

381
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,535
give up the jewel of Polaris.

382
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:14,029
- He thinks we're with Falco.

383
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,983
- [Both] We're not with Falco.

384
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:18,180
- Two of his men were just chasing us.

385
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,520
- We're here by mistake.

386
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,473
- Oh, you did make a mistake

387
00:30:21,473 --> 00:30:23,973
and now you are our prisoners.

388
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,458
Danko, look.

389
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,474
Look at the capture we've made.

390
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:31,519
We'll be heroes.

391
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,352
- Heroes.

392
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:36,128
- Listen, little man,
you've got this all wrong.

393
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:38,661
- My name is Palmay, not little man.

394
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:39,494
Palmay.

395
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:43,555
- Okay, Mr. Palmay, like I said.

396
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:45,161
We're not with Falco.

397
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:47,125
We're just a couple of
kids that got sucked up

398
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,527
in a painting, okay.

399
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:49,674
- That's ridiculous.

400
00:30:49,674 --> 00:30:50,734
- Yeah, I know.

401
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,594
Maybe I can prove it to you

402
00:30:52,594 --> 00:30:53,427
in a

403
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:55,912
a battle of the wits.

404
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:57,343
- Great, emphasize your weakness.

405
00:30:57,343 --> 00:30:58,179
- Shut up.

406
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:00,875
But, if I win you have to grand me a wish.

407
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:01,819
- Which is?

408
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,533
- Put me in the village still tied up

409
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:07,311
and when Falco's men take me prisoner

410
00:31:07,311 --> 00:31:08,981
instead of releasing me, you'll know

411
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:10,744
we were telling the truth.

412
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,123
The favor is, you have to let my sister go

413
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,352
and help her get home.

414
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:16,580
- Are you feeling all right?

415
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,618
- That's my favor to you?

416
00:31:18,618 --> 00:31:19,759
- Yep.

417
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,235
All the proof you need.

418
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:22,904
- On the contrary,

419
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:24,896
you've proved it already.

420
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:28,202
The battle of the wits has
ended before it's begun.

421
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:29,702
Danko, untie them.

422
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:33,583
- I'll tell you what.

423
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,994
How 'bout you draw me a picture over here

424
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:37,410
and I go get us some hot chocolate?

425
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,947
- You won't be gone long will you?

426
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:40,274
- Back before you know it.

427
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,107
- Okay.

428
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:47,566
- Yeah, all right.

429
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,412
I'll make the announcement, sure.

430
00:31:49,412 --> 00:31:52,057
Ladies and gentlemen, please bear with us.

431
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:55,560
We'll have the lights back on
in about five minutes, okay?

432
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,566
- [Ghost Voice] Yo, Monty.

433
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:57,399
- I'm on my way.

434
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:58,566
Where are you?

435
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:06,049
(dramatic music)

436
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:22,751
- What's this jewel look like?

437
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,644
- It's the most beautiful
jewel anyone has ever seen,

438
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:26,144
as big as my fist,

439
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,350
a gorgeous emerald,

440
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,558
but its power is much more
impressive than its beauty.

441
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:34,066
- What can it do?

442
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:37,013
- It can virtually do
anything its owner commands.

443
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:38,633
- And that's what Falco's after?

444
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:39,960
- Yes.

445
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,788
Whoever possesses the
assembled staff with the jewel

446
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:45,612
in place can rule the world.

447
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:46,832
One man did,

448
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,889
Lescarus the Evil, whose reign of terror

449
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:52,616
lasted nearly 100 years.

450
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:54,866
No one could stop Lescarus,

451
00:32:56,705 --> 00:32:57,538
no one.

452
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,991
And when he was finally
defeated by a gathering

453
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:05,300
of brave wizards, the leaders of the world

454
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,151
decided to separate the
jewel from the staff,

455
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:12,318
thereby limiting the collective power.

456
00:33:16,702 --> 00:33:19,452
(dramatic music)

457
00:33:20,783 --> 00:33:23,228
The jewel was hidden in this very village,

458
00:33:23,228 --> 00:33:26,586
home of the last peaceful
warlock who possessed the staff.

459
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:29,913
If the staff was stolen
a messenger would be sent

460
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:32,686
in the opposite direction
of the thief therefore,

461
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:36,241
it became virtually impossible
for the thief to beat

462
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:38,372
the messenger back to this village

463
00:33:38,372 --> 00:33:40,622
where the jewel was hidden.

464
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,370
(dramatic music)

465
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:59,281
Two years ago Falco stole the staff.

466
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:01,050
Luckily we were able to learn of the theft

467
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,717
and prepare for Falco's arrival.

468
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:10,751
- That's a really cute story, but we need

469
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:12,370
to get going home.

470
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,312
Dad's expecting dinner at eight.

471
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:16,653
- Well, if you're from
another world as you claim,

472
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:18,880
only a magician can get you back.

473
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,163
- You're kidding me, right?

474
00:34:20,163 --> 00:34:21,961
- I wish I were.

475
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:23,559
Darbin, the great magician, was sent

476
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,809
to thwart Falco's invasion.

477
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:29,605
That was the last time
we saw either of them.

478
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:31,557
At first we thought Darbin was successful

479
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:34,415
as there were no signs of Falco.

480
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:36,430
Now we know the sad truth.

481
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,461
- Yeah, and so do we.

482
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:40,385
- So, if Darbin's the only dude in town

483
00:34:40,385 --> 00:34:44,169
that can get rid of Falco,
then we gotta find Darbin.

484
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,002
- Okay.

485
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:49,288
(dramatic music)

486
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:26,057
- Look.

487
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:31,329
(dramatic music)

488
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:05,171
- That's Falco with his hooligans.

489
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,780
- Hello, ugly old woman.

490
00:36:16,028 --> 00:36:19,947
You see, there's no need for any violence

491
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:22,334
or any suffering at all.

492
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:26,501
There's no reason for faces
to look like this one does.

493
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:30,365
Simply tell me where the
jewel is and we'll all

494
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:34,633
simply be on our way and your
good, honest, boring lives

495
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:36,475
can go on as peacefully as before.

496
00:36:36,475 --> 00:36:40,216
Now, we can't get fairer
than that, can we?

497
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:44,997
But, if you refuse to tell
me the location of the jewel,

498
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:48,184
I will make you suffer more than you've

499
00:36:48,184 --> 00:36:49,934
ever suffered before.

500
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:51,952
Boo.

501
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:55,083
(laughing)

502
00:37:04,673 --> 00:37:07,107
I understand you fled to the forest

503
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:09,931
when my men confronted you.

504
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:11,348
- We were scared.

505
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:14,686
We don't know anything.

506
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:16,469
- We were scared (mumbling).

507
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:17,895
You see, I think that
somewhere in the back

508
00:37:17,895 --> 00:37:20,282
of that tiny mind you do.

509
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:22,746
Tell me, where is it?

510
00:37:22,746 --> 00:37:24,610
Where's the jewel?

511
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,860
- I swear, Your Grace, we know nothing.

512
00:37:33,257 --> 00:37:35,507
(laughing)

513
00:37:42,685 --> 00:37:45,097
- If you know nothing, then
prepare for the education

514
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,428
of a lifetime.

515
00:37:46,428 --> 00:37:48,504
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

516
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:50,707
You are now my hunter.

517
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:53,150
You will neither eat
nor sleep until you find

518
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,966
the jewel of Polaris for me

519
00:37:54,966 --> 00:37:58,601
and with your size I expect you to look

520
00:37:58,601 --> 00:38:01,915
under every rug and beneath every stone.

521
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:04,469
If you find the jewel
then I may return you

522
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:06,408
to your normal,

523
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:07,325
we'll talk.

524
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:09,498
Take him inside.

525
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:16,074
And, I suppose you have
nothing to tell me, huh?

526
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:19,186
It's an epidemic.

527
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:25,033
This whole village is suffering
from tight lip disease.

528
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:27,700
Well, I've got the perfect cure.

529
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:38,977
Give a smile.

530
00:38:38,977 --> 00:38:40,144
Oh, you can't.

531
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,090
- We don't know anything.

532
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,785
Why don't you believe us?

533
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:49,029
- Because someone here
in this village knows

534
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,565
the whereabouts of this
jewel, because I nearly had

535
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:55,982
the jewel once and I will not fail again.

536
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:58,639
Do you know what it feels
like to have something

537
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,975
so close to your grasp,
but not quite reach it?

538
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:04,892
Do you know that agony?

539
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:08,579
I can see you're having
difficulty imagining this.

540
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,746
Let me help you empathize.

541
00:39:16,378 --> 00:39:17,942
Can't quite reach it, you see.

542
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:19,942
Do you feel the madness.

543
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,492
I'm just warming up.

544
00:39:32,257 --> 00:39:34,840
- I want to just slap that man.

545
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:53,992
- Only Darbin knew where the jewel was.

546
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,860
Now that he's gone

547
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,773
it seems that we're doomed.

548
00:39:58,773 --> 00:39:59,935
- Doomed.

549
00:39:59,935 --> 00:40:00,889
- No way.

550
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:02,976
All we have to do is find Darbin.

551
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:05,452
- No, no, no, no, it's
too dangerous out there.

552
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:07,390
- Well, I'm not waitin'
around here until Falco

553
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,918
finds the jewel.

554
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:10,119
We have to find Darbin

555
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,694
or some other magician

556
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:12,937
and we're not gonna find either of 'em

557
00:40:12,937 --> 00:40:14,472
sitting on our butts in here.

558
00:40:14,472 --> 00:40:15,985
- You're just gonna walk
right out that front door?

559
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:17,491
- No, I'm gonna get my skates first.

560
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:18,660
I plan on rolling out the front door.

561
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,123
- Not me, I'm not going
back out there again.

562
00:40:21,123 --> 00:40:22,149
- Suit yourself.

563
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:23,375
- Be careful.

564
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:26,013
Tell no one we're hidden here, no one.

565
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:26,846
- No prob.

566
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:27,919
See you later.

567
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:30,023
- No prob, see you later.

568
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:32,786
This is the last time I
let you go off on your own.

569
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:35,899
I'm not goin' after you this time.

570
00:40:35,899 --> 00:40:38,649
(dramatic music)

571
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,962
- Hey, Matthew, run.

572
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:07,388
- Come out, come out little one.

573
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:09,138
- Let's go down here.

574
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:12,854
Here little boy,

575
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:14,271
here little girl.

576
00:41:24,968 --> 00:41:26,801
- Dust in this pantry.

577
00:41:31,728 --> 00:41:34,228
(dog barking)

578
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:15,368
(thunder and lightning)

579
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,093
(screaming)

580
00:42:52,775 --> 00:42:54,108
- Man the gates.

581
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:57,633
- I've got it down here.

582
00:43:03,092 --> 00:43:05,184
- I want you all to know
that we're not going to leave

583
00:43:05,184 --> 00:43:06,191
until we have the jewel.

584
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:08,551
Resistance is futile.

585
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:12,718
Take them to the palace
jail and bring the others.

586
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:18,887
(dramatic music)

587
00:44:28,741 --> 00:44:29,658
- Wipe out.

588
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:48,282
- Ben, are you there?

589
00:44:48,282 --> 00:44:49,615
Can you hear me?

590
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:54,112
Ben, Ben, come on, pick up.

591
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:56,023
- Hello.

592
00:44:56,023 --> 00:44:57,067
Hello.

593
00:44:57,067 --> 00:44:57,900
Casey?

594
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,733
Yeah, it's me.

595
00:44:58,733 --> 00:44:59,976
- Where are you?

596
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:01,112
- You're not gonna believe it.

597
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:02,763
We're inside the painting,

598
00:45:02,763 --> 00:45:03,998
me and Kim both.

599
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:07,930
You remember that village
landscape painting?

600
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:10,582
Well, it was smoking and
I touched it and I got

601
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,053
sucked into the painting.

602
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:13,661
I came out of the haystack.

603
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:15,821
- Ben, I'm scared.

604
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:18,261
I want you and Kim to come home now.

605
00:45:18,261 --> 00:45:19,920
- We can't just come back.

606
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,753
- Why not?

607
00:45:20,753 --> 00:45:23,601
- Because I think the passageway
only goes one direction.

608
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:25,018
- No, it doesn't.

609
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:27,993
- Listen, I've got a crazy idea.

610
00:45:27,993 --> 00:45:30,213
I think a magician could get us back.

611
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:32,302
Here's what I want you to do.

612
00:45:32,302 --> 00:45:34,874
- So, without a village
magician how do you ever expect

613
00:45:34,874 --> 00:45:36,041
to beat Falco?

614
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,855
- Only with the power up here,

615
00:45:38,855 --> 00:45:40,951
together with the power down here.

616
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:42,615
- That sounds great,
but you aren't actually

617
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,549
doing anything up here except for hiding.

618
00:45:45,549 --> 00:45:47,758
That's not exactly an offensive maneuver.

619
00:45:47,758 --> 00:45:49,471
Sooner or later some of
Falco's men are gonna

620
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:52,350
come banging on that door.

621
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,683
- Open the door.

622
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,630
- I was hoping for that.

623
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:02,452
(pounding on door)

624
00:46:03,776 --> 00:46:05,109
- Open the door.

625
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:11,626
(dramatic music)

626
00:46:49,792 --> 00:46:51,155
- Hold on just a sec.

627
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:52,902
- Okay, now are you in the Falco room yet?

628
00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:54,706
- Yeah, me and Monty both.

629
00:46:54,706 --> 00:46:55,703
- Hey Monty, what's up?

630
00:46:55,703 --> 00:46:57,295
- Ben?

631
00:46:57,295 --> 00:47:00,520
Hey, just sippin' hot chocolate with Case.

632
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,025
- Cool, Case, I know it sounds crazy,

633
00:47:03,025 --> 00:47:05,766
but it's the only thing I got right now.

634
00:47:05,766 --> 00:47:07,957
- How can a picture
turn into a real thing?

635
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:08,790
- I don't know.

636
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:09,805
It just can.

637
00:47:09,805 --> 00:47:12,034
Hey, you remember that ad for the pizza

638
00:47:12,034 --> 00:47:13,266
that we were gonna order?

639
00:47:13,266 --> 00:47:15,371
Well, when I came into the
haystack it turned into

640
00:47:15,371 --> 00:47:17,035
a real pizza.

641
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:19,655
Now Case, look at the Falco painting.

642
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:20,488
- Yeah.

643
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:22,643
- No Falco, right?

644
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:23,745
- Right.

645
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:26,790
- Now look at the landscape.

646
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,779
It's still smoking, right?

647
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,773
- Right again.

648
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:33,320
But, I just don't know
if this is gonna work

649
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,112
with one of my pictures.

650
00:47:35,112 --> 00:47:37,466
- Casey, it's all we've got right now.

651
00:47:37,466 --> 00:47:39,040
So, what do you say?

652
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,145
Let's give it a try?

653
00:47:40,145 --> 00:47:42,145
- Okay, Ben, here we go.

654
00:47:46,376 --> 00:47:47,209
You do it.

655
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:52,618
- Well, how am I supposed
to stick it to the picture?

656
00:48:04,594 --> 00:48:06,908
- Monty's about to put
the picture on the wall.

657
00:48:06,908 --> 00:48:08,443
- Wait, wait, wait, don't put it up yet.

658
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:10,009
I have to know what he can do first.

659
00:48:10,009 --> 00:48:12,953
- Oh, now you're interested
in what he can do.

660
00:48:12,953 --> 00:48:15,211
You didn't care before, did you?

661
00:48:15,211 --> 00:48:16,601
- Casey, don't give me that right now.

662
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:18,256
We're in big trouble and I need your help.

663
00:48:18,256 --> 00:48:19,089
- What?

664
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:21,299
Hello.

665
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:24,509
Ben, you're not comin' in good.

666
00:48:24,509 --> 00:48:26,176
I'm losing you, Ben.

667
00:48:27,183 --> 00:48:28,556
- Not funny Casey.

668
00:48:28,556 --> 00:48:30,148
- Okay, okay.

669
00:48:30,148 --> 00:48:32,236
Just remember this when I need a favor.

670
00:48:32,236 --> 00:48:34,013
- Anything you want whenever you want it.

671
00:48:34,013 --> 00:48:35,647
- Thank you.

672
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:37,915
- Now, I want you to clear your mind.

673
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,892
Focus all your energy on the magician.

674
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:43,266
Try really hard to imagine that he knows

675
00:48:43,266 --> 00:48:45,760
everything about the world I'm in,

676
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,502
and this is the most important part.

677
00:48:47,502 --> 00:48:48,982
Focus very hard.

678
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:52,358
Imagine that he knows
exactly how we got here

679
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:54,751
and how we can get back, okay?

680
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:56,735
Now, stay focused,

681
00:48:56,735 --> 00:48:58,450
open your eyes.

682
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,811
Tell Monty to put the
painting on the wall.

683
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:02,287
Don't break concentration.

684
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:04,120
Something will happen.

685
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,088
- It's on the picture,
but nothing happened.

686
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:13,721
- Something will happen.

687
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:17,054
(thunder and lightning)

688
00:49:20,092 --> 00:49:22,342
- What do you think, Monty?

689
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:25,019
- I don't know.

690
00:49:25,907 --> 00:49:27,161
I think it worked.

691
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:28,852
- Ben, the picture's blank.

692
00:49:28,852 --> 00:49:31,068
Did the magician go through?

693
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:31,901
Ben, Ben.

694
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,397
- Casey, hello.

695
00:49:34,397 --> 00:49:35,738
Did it work?

696
00:49:35,738 --> 00:49:36,967
Hello, Casey,

697
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:38,568
are you there?

698
00:49:38,568 --> 00:49:41,068
Great, now what am I gonna do?

699
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,540
(rumbling)

700
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,927
- I wish they'd make these
things more in my size.

701
00:50:08,845 --> 00:50:10,095
Oh, good grief.

702
00:50:11,447 --> 00:50:12,940
Excuse me.

703
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,367
Do you know if there's
a phone around here?

704
00:50:14,367 --> 00:50:16,628
I could really go for some Chinese food.

705
00:50:16,628 --> 00:50:17,857
- Is that you, Monty?

706
00:50:17,857 --> 00:50:19,629
Are you the magician that Casey sent?

707
00:50:19,629 --> 00:50:21,296
- M the Magnificent.

708
00:50:23,692 --> 00:50:24,816
- Public speaker.

709
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:28,739
- I give inspirational
speeches to company executives,

710
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:30,431
even some presidents.

711
00:50:30,431 --> 00:50:32,938
I once counseled Lincoln.

712
00:50:32,938 --> 00:50:36,553
I told him that he was takin'
his job way too seriously,

713
00:50:36,553 --> 00:50:38,241
that he needed to get
out and see the yards

714
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:40,658
and go to the theater I said.

715
00:50:41,897 --> 00:50:43,690
That didn't work out so well.

716
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,825
- And a dancer.

717
00:50:44,825 --> 00:50:47,775
- Yes, a little tap,
but I'm more interested

718
00:50:47,775 --> 00:50:51,942
in interpretative jazz
(making musical noises).

719
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:56,360
- You think this is funny.

720
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,296
We're in really big trouble here.

721
00:50:58,296 --> 00:51:00,707
- Hey, it's just a joke.

722
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:01,540
It's not my fault.

723
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,233
Casey's the one that gave
me the sense of humor.

724
00:51:03,233 --> 00:51:04,066
Excuse me.

725
00:51:05,908 --> 00:51:07,106
Yell at her.

726
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,022
- Yeah, you're right.

727
00:51:08,022 --> 00:51:09,498
It's just that I got my sister and myself

728
00:51:09,498 --> 00:51:11,014
in a whole mess of trouble and you're

729
00:51:11,014 --> 00:51:12,530
the only one that can get us out.

730
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,138
- Actually, you're wrong there.

731
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:15,041
I can't help you.

732
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:15,874
- Why not?

733
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:18,946
- You wanna go home, right?

734
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:23,273
Even I, and don't you tell
anyone this, bad for the rap,

735
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:25,811
even I'm not powerful enough
to send you back home.

736
00:51:25,811 --> 00:51:28,246
- But, I told Casey to make
you able to send us back home.

737
00:51:28,246 --> 00:51:29,972
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

738
00:51:29,972 --> 00:51:33,639
You said, imagine,
imagine that the magician

739
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,193
knows everything about me
and the world that I'm in.

740
00:51:38,193 --> 00:51:40,266
Imagine that he knows
how we got here and how

741
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:41,899
we can get back home.

742
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:45,442
At no time did you say, make him be able

743
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:47,349
to send us back home.

744
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:48,965
It's all there in black and white.

745
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:50,382
Clear as crystal.

746
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,826
Look, only the power of the
assembled staff of Polaris

747
00:51:55,826 --> 00:51:57,320
can send you and your sister back home.

748
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,759
- Oh great.

749
00:51:58,759 --> 00:52:00,779
The staff's in the
possession of the most evil

750
00:52:00,779 --> 00:52:02,907
man on earth who's probably
gonna find the jewel

751
00:52:02,907 --> 00:52:05,531
of Polaris at which point
he'll be the most powerful

752
00:52:05,531 --> 00:52:06,578
man on earth.

753
00:52:06,578 --> 00:52:07,746
Can't get any worse.

754
00:52:07,746 --> 00:52:09,796
- Actually, it does get worse.

755
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:13,873
Do you remember the big bad
electrical storm back home?

756
00:52:13,873 --> 00:52:15,379
Well, I'm afraid when that storm ends

757
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:16,953
in the real world

758
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:20,037
so will the passage for another 100 years.

759
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:21,686
- A hundred years.

760
00:52:21,686 --> 00:52:22,936
Thanks a lot M.

761
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:25,017
Casey.

762
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,427
Hello, Casey.

763
00:52:26,427 --> 00:52:29,844
Let's just get my skates and go find Kim.

764
00:52:33,424 --> 00:52:34,456
- I mean, another hundred years.

765
00:52:34,456 --> 00:52:35,382
I know it's a long time.

766
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:37,031
You might wanna get a hold
of Casey 'cause that's

767
00:52:37,031 --> 00:52:37,896
not my doing.

768
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:38,813
She always.

769
00:52:41,082 --> 00:52:41,966
- Who goes there?

770
00:52:41,966 --> 00:52:42,823
- What are you lookin' at me for?

771
00:52:42,823 --> 00:52:43,714
You're the magician.

772
00:52:43,714 --> 00:52:44,547
Do something.

773
00:52:44,547 --> 00:52:45,930
- All right, all right,

774
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:50,097
but I'm a little new at
this so get back, way back.

775
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,378
Voila.

776
00:52:55,378 --> 00:52:57,019
- Pigs, that's the best you could do?

777
00:52:57,019 --> 00:52:58,777
- I'm just warming up.

778
00:52:58,777 --> 00:53:00,469
Give me a little more time.

779
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:01,802
I'll get better.

780
00:53:07,414 --> 00:53:10,164
(dramatic music)

781
00:53:19,893 --> 00:53:21,581
- Falco's men must have taken Kim.

782
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:23,831
How am I gonna get her too?

783
00:53:30,796 --> 00:53:31,629
- Sorry.

784
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,048
- Let's recap.

785
00:53:36,015 --> 00:53:37,567
I'm lost in another world.

786
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:41,133
I've lost my sister who's
either mad and looking for me

787
00:53:41,133 --> 00:53:43,065
or has been kidnapped by Falco

788
00:53:43,065 --> 00:53:47,037
and my only help is a
spastic magical moron.

789
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:48,517
- Hey, watch it.

790
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,203
I did that pig thing without a hitch.

791
00:53:50,203 --> 00:53:54,370
I could do the same thing to
you if you don't watch it.

792
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,309
(dramatic music)

793
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,882
- Palmay?

794
00:54:24,882 --> 00:54:25,715
What happened?

795
00:54:25,715 --> 00:54:26,624
- Who's that?

796
00:54:26,624 --> 00:54:27,948
- Oh, he's with me, he's.

797
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:29,040
- M the Magnificent.

798
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,873
- Knock it off.

799
00:54:29,873 --> 00:54:31,385
He's a magician that might be able to get

800
00:54:31,385 --> 00:54:33,087
Kim and me back home.

801
00:54:33,087 --> 00:54:35,466
- You know, I could make your
friend here a little taller.

802
00:54:35,466 --> 00:54:37,775
I can't guarantee he'll
be a center for the NBA,

803
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:38,967
but with a little magic.

804
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:39,800
- Shut up.

805
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,300
Where's my sister?

806
00:54:42,604 --> 00:54:45,130
- Falco took her and
Danko to the palace jail.

807
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,225
- Okay, so how do we get into the palace?

808
00:54:47,225 --> 00:54:50,238
- We need to see the village
magistrate who's our leader.

809
00:54:50,238 --> 00:54:51,957
He's currently hiding in the forest.

810
00:54:51,957 --> 00:54:53,136
- Well, what are waiting around here for?

811
00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:53,969
Let's go.

812
00:54:56,704 --> 00:54:59,454
(dramatic music)

813
00:55:02,451 --> 00:55:03,489
- I smell rogues.

814
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:04,477
We better go this way.

815
00:55:04,477 --> 00:55:07,227
- No, no, no, trust me, this way.

816
00:55:10,901 --> 00:55:11,984
- Halt, halt.

817
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:15,122
- M, take care of them.

818
00:55:15,122 --> 00:55:15,955
- M, take care of them?

819
00:55:15,955 --> 00:55:18,288
(screaming)

820
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:26,603
- Losers.

821
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:37,556
What took you two so long?

822
00:55:38,643 --> 00:55:41,000
- Not bad, M, not bad.

823
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,786
- Keep the faith, keep the faith.

824
00:55:42,786 --> 00:55:44,745
Palmay, where we headed to?

825
00:55:44,745 --> 00:55:45,578
Onward.

826
00:55:51,352 --> 00:55:54,102
(dramatic music)

827
00:56:13,097 --> 00:56:17,097
- When I get my hands on
him I'm gonna kill him.

828
00:56:23,072 --> 00:56:24,653
- Ben, can you hear me?

829
00:56:24,653 --> 00:56:26,188
It's Casey, are you there?

830
00:56:26,188 --> 00:56:27,361
- Hello.

831
00:56:27,361 --> 00:56:28,295
- Hey, Ben.

832
00:56:28,295 --> 00:56:29,543
What happened?

833
00:56:29,543 --> 00:56:32,208
I lost you after the picture went through.

834
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:33,298
- Hey guys, it's Case.

835
00:56:33,298 --> 00:56:36,930
Oh well, the good news is it
worked and he came through.

836
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,212
- I can't believe it worked.

837
00:56:38,212 --> 00:56:39,711
What's he like?

838
00:56:39,711 --> 00:56:41,646
- He's not too bad, but I
don't think he'll be able

839
00:56:41,646 --> 00:56:42,578
to get us home.

840
00:56:42,578 --> 00:56:43,447
- What's wrong?

841
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:45,838
- I'm in a great deal of pain.

842
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:46,900
- Oh, okay.

843
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,886
Well,

844
00:56:47,886 --> 00:56:49,918
let me take a look.

845
00:56:49,918 --> 00:56:51,447
Let's see what we've got here.

846
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:52,555
- Listen, what's the weather like there?

847
00:56:52,555 --> 00:56:53,670
Is it still storming?

848
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:56,159
- It's still raining really
bad, but why do you care

849
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:57,859
about the weather here?

850
00:56:57,859 --> 00:56:59,952
Are you in some kinda denial?

851
00:56:59,952 --> 00:57:00,924
- No, Case.

852
00:57:00,924 --> 00:57:02,829
Apparently, part of the
spell is that Kim and I

853
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:04,351
have to get back there
before the storm ends

854
00:57:04,351 --> 00:57:06,069
or we won't be able to get back at all.

855
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:07,551
- You guys have to come back.

856
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:08,662
You just have to.

857
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:09,980
Can I talk to Kim?

858
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:10,926
- Not exactly.

859
00:57:10,926 --> 00:57:12,207
- Not exactly?

860
00:57:12,207 --> 00:57:14,235
- Well, Kim's not here right now.

861
00:57:14,235 --> 00:57:16,087
Actually, she's been kidnapped by Falco.

862
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:17,051
- What?

863
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:18,680
- It's not my fault she
wanted to stay in the chapel

864
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,008
instead of comin' with me.

865
00:57:20,008 --> 00:57:21,166
I'm sure she's all right though.

866
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:24,916
Listen, I gotta go so
I'll talk to you later.

867
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:29,083
(dramatic music)

868
00:57:54,741 --> 00:57:58,353
- Ah, the mysterious damsel in distress.

869
00:57:58,353 --> 00:57:59,411
- Why am I being held here?

870
00:57:59,411 --> 00:58:01,744
- I'll ask the questions, dear.

871
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,293
- Don't call me dear.

872
00:58:04,293 --> 00:58:05,967
- I'm so sorry.

873
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:07,866
It was very insensitive of me.

874
00:58:07,866 --> 00:58:08,699
Please.

875
00:58:12,525 --> 00:58:13,774
From the look of your
wardrobe I'd say you're one

876
00:58:13,774 --> 00:58:15,575
of Darbin's sorcerer princesses.

877
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,084
Am I right?

878
00:58:17,084 --> 00:58:18,293
- Who is Darbin?

879
00:58:18,293 --> 00:58:19,600
And, where is my brother?

880
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,433
- Oh yes,

881
00:58:22,512 --> 00:58:25,351
the young boy with the magic feet,

882
00:58:25,351 --> 00:58:28,418
another of Darbin's sorcerer apprentices.

883
00:58:28,418 --> 00:58:30,835
Where is your brother indeed?

884
00:58:32,474 --> 00:58:35,019
It's a very good question
and one I'm glad you asked.

885
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:37,602
Tell me, where is your brother?

886
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:41,594
Dear.

887
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,863
- It's not my tongue, M.

888
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,946
It's my foot.

889
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,502
- I knew that, I knew that.

890
00:58:49,502 --> 00:58:52,999
Get ready for eternal foot comfort.

891
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:53,832
Oh, whoa.

892
00:59:00,731 --> 00:59:02,046
Let me try that again.

893
00:59:02,046 --> 00:59:03,043
- No, no, that's all right.

894
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:04,688
These feet just needed a rest.

895
00:59:04,688 --> 00:59:07,142
They're feeling much better, thank you.

896
00:59:07,142 --> 00:59:08,397
- No, no, no, no, no, I
can do it, I can do it.

897
00:59:08,397 --> 00:59:10,085
I can do it.

898
00:59:10,085 --> 00:59:11,085
Hokus pokus.

899
00:59:16,784 --> 00:59:17,876
- Wow.

900
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:20,263
These are wonderful.

901
00:59:20,263 --> 00:59:22,468
They're so light and supportive.

902
00:59:22,468 --> 00:59:23,844
- Yes, they are

903
00:59:23,844 --> 00:59:25,511
They look good, too.

904
00:59:27,089 --> 00:59:27,922
Oh yes.

905
00:59:29,205 --> 00:59:31,288
- Smoke, sparks, yelling.

906
00:59:32,925 --> 00:59:33,896
Oh, you two are doing wonders

907
00:59:33,896 --> 00:59:35,919
for our traveling inconspicuously.

908
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:37,452
- I'm sorry, Ben.

909
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:40,793
But, these shoes are wonderful.

910
00:59:40,793 --> 00:59:42,533
- Those boots were killin' his arches.

911
00:59:42,533 --> 00:59:43,793
- They're splendid.

912
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:45,614
Please keep it down.

913
00:59:45,614 --> 00:59:46,612
Can we go?

914
00:59:46,612 --> 00:59:47,994
- Okay, come, follow me.

915
00:59:47,994 --> 00:59:49,102
- They're splendid.

916
00:59:49,102 --> 00:59:53,269
See if you get a Christmas
present from me this year.

917
01:00:05,026 --> 01:00:05,859
- Palmay,

918
01:00:06,716 --> 01:00:07,805
I was worried.

919
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:08,903
Where have you been?

920
01:00:08,903 --> 01:00:09,736
- Hiding.

921
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:11,508
Falco's men have taken Danko.

922
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:12,597
- Yes, I know.

923
01:00:12,597 --> 01:00:16,414
Falco is making Danko shovel
coal into the palace furnace

924
01:00:16,414 --> 01:00:17,650
day and night.

925
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:20,567
Even big Danko cannot survive that.

926
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:25,334
Who are your friends?

927
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,617
- This is Ben and M.

928
01:00:27,617 --> 01:00:29,284
- M the Magnificent.

929
01:00:31,105 --> 01:00:33,524
- You know they saved my life.

930
01:00:33,524 --> 01:00:34,973
- Ah, then they are welcome here.

931
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:36,223
Please come in.

932
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:43,202
- Have you got anything to eat?

933
01:00:59,412 --> 01:01:02,860
- M, any chance you can turn
this into a root beer float?

934
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:03,693
- No.

935
01:01:05,673 --> 01:01:08,594
- Falco's rounded up most
of the villagers by now.

936
01:01:08,594 --> 01:01:12,107
The only way Falco will release
our friends and relatives

937
01:01:12,107 --> 01:01:14,561
is an exchange of the jewel.

938
01:01:14,561 --> 01:01:15,894
We must find it.

939
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:20,560
- Do you have any idea
where we might find Darbin?

940
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,143
Then we are doomed.

941
01:01:24,284 --> 01:01:25,810
- Hey, I can find Darbin.

942
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:28,776
- Son, you don't know
the danger out there.

943
01:01:28,776 --> 01:01:30,093
- Are you sure about this?

944
01:01:30,093 --> 01:01:32,266
- If I can find Darbin,
then I can use the jewel

945
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:36,394
as a bargaining chip to get
Kim back and get us home.

946
01:01:36,394 --> 01:01:37,835
It's a no brainer.

947
01:01:37,835 --> 01:01:40,769
Do we have any other choice?

948
01:01:40,769 --> 01:01:42,980
- All right, I'm in.

949
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,398
But, the jewel alone
will not get you home.

950
01:01:45,398 --> 01:01:48,214
You need the staff, too which Falco has.

951
01:01:48,214 --> 01:01:50,469
How are you gonna pull that off?

952
01:01:50,469 --> 01:01:51,479
- How am I supposed to know?

953
01:01:51,479 --> 01:01:53,070
Makin' this up as I go along.

954
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:55,092
- You don't actually need to find Darbin,

955
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:56,197
just the map.

956
01:01:56,197 --> 01:01:57,824
- The map.

957
01:01:57,824 --> 01:01:59,322
- Darbin created a map to the jewel.

958
01:01:59,322 --> 01:02:03,845
When he disappeared the
map disappeared with him.

959
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:04,678
- Darbin.

960
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:09,097
I think I know that name from somewhere.

961
01:02:09,953 --> 01:02:10,786
Casey, are you there?

962
01:02:10,786 --> 01:02:13,084
- Yeah, what's happenin'?

963
01:02:13,084 --> 01:02:14,348
- Quick, look at the painting.

964
01:02:14,348 --> 01:02:15,765
Who's the artist?

965
01:02:20,672 --> 01:02:23,173
- It says, A. Darbin.

966
01:02:23,173 --> 01:02:26,748
- So the painting must
be the map to the jewel.

967
01:02:26,748 --> 01:02:28,705
Case, do you see any directions or clues

968
01:02:28,705 --> 01:02:30,276
on the village landscape?

969
01:02:30,276 --> 01:02:34,443
- Yeah, it's by a rock with
all these symbols on it.

970
01:02:35,303 --> 01:02:38,957
It's on a scroll that
says, look under the roads.

971
01:02:38,957 --> 01:02:40,013
- Look under the roads.

972
01:02:40,013 --> 01:02:41,506
Great, thanks Case.

973
01:02:41,506 --> 01:02:42,839
Gotta go, later.

974
01:02:43,883 --> 01:02:45,383
- Under the roads.

975
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:48,669
- There are so many roads to the village.

976
01:02:48,669 --> 01:02:50,830
How do we know which one?

977
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:53,866
- Don't look at me, I just work for him.

978
01:02:53,866 --> 01:02:55,366
- Under the roads.

979
01:02:56,347 --> 01:02:57,998
I got it.

980
01:02:57,998 --> 01:02:59,852
It's not under any of
the roads in the village,

981
01:02:59,852 --> 01:03:01,307
but I know where it is.

982
01:03:01,307 --> 01:03:02,140
Come on.

983
01:03:03,683 --> 01:03:06,433
(dramatic music)

984
01:03:36,074 --> 01:03:37,787
- I thought the clue was under a road.

985
01:03:37,787 --> 01:03:38,620
- It is.

986
01:03:44,873 --> 01:03:48,510
Like the clue said, under the roads.

987
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:51,260
(dramatic music)

988
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:06,975
Darbin's hidden message.

989
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:19,998
The great jewel of Polaris
can be found in a pit.

990
01:04:19,998 --> 01:04:22,896
The entrance to the cave
can be found 100 paces

991
01:04:22,896 --> 01:04:25,488
from the great stone in the woods.

992
01:04:25,488 --> 01:04:27,860
- That rock is just a
few moments from here.

993
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,977
- The direction to walk
is that which follows

994
01:04:29,977 --> 01:04:31,585
the afternoon shadow.

995
01:04:31,585 --> 01:04:34,087
Before reaching the jewel
deep in the cave's catacombs

996
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:36,114
challenges await.

997
01:04:36,114 --> 01:04:38,686
- Darbin never made anything easy.

998
01:04:38,686 --> 01:04:41,118
- Mental, physical and psychological tests

999
01:04:41,118 --> 01:04:44,236
must be overcome in order
to possess the great

1000
01:04:44,236 --> 01:04:46,178
jewel of Polaris.

1001
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:47,783
- Wow, awful lotta trouble to go through

1002
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,283
just to hide a jewel.

1003
01:04:49,283 --> 01:04:52,118
Didn't Darbin know about
safe deposit boxes?

1004
01:04:52,118 --> 01:04:55,782
Would've saved him and us
a lot of time and effort.

1005
01:04:55,782 --> 01:04:57,169
- For anyone less than the strongest,

1006
01:04:57,169 --> 01:04:58,169
the bravest,

1007
01:04:59,613 --> 01:05:01,483
and most intelligent mortal

1008
01:05:01,483 --> 01:05:03,345
shall never exit the cave alive.

1009
01:05:03,345 --> 01:05:04,678
- Leaves me out.

1010
01:05:05,842 --> 01:05:08,464
- You gotta give old
Darbin points for drama.

1011
01:05:08,464 --> 01:05:10,597
What do you say kid?

1012
01:05:10,597 --> 01:05:12,687
- Like I said, no brainer.

1013
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:15,320
- All right, but when you
get home you tell Casey

1014
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,214
I want a vacation.

1015
01:05:17,214 --> 01:05:19,020
No more battles,

1016
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,136
no more death defying challenges.

1017
01:05:21,136 --> 01:05:23,159
I want a beach,

1018
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:24,800
a towel,

1019
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,633
a Slurpee.

1020
01:05:27,288 --> 01:05:28,121
Got it?

1021
01:05:28,984 --> 01:05:30,016
- Case, are you there?

1022
01:05:30,016 --> 01:05:31,632
- Yeah, what happened?

1023
01:05:31,632 --> 01:05:33,325
- I found a map.

1024
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:35,247
- Does that mean you're on your way back?

1025
01:05:35,247 --> 01:05:37,505
- No, we still have a
really long ways to go.

1026
01:05:37,505 --> 01:05:39,672
What's the weather like there?

1027
01:05:39,672 --> 01:05:42,042
- Monty says we haven't got much time.

1028
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,515
- All right, all right, I gotta go.

1029
01:05:43,515 --> 01:05:44,598
Over and out.

1030
01:05:46,882 --> 01:05:49,632
(dramatic music)

1031
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:06,014
- You should find the rock a few minutes

1032
01:06:06,014 --> 01:06:08,088
beyond those trees.

1033
01:06:08,088 --> 01:06:10,816
The cave entrance should be
somewhere on the other side

1034
01:06:10,816 --> 01:06:11,816
of the hill.

1035
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:15,378
- Please, take care of yourself then.

1036
01:06:15,378 --> 01:06:16,295
- You, too.

1037
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:23,146
- Palmay, I put steel tips in
those sneakers, so if anybody

1038
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,979
gives you any trouble.

1039
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:30,061
You know how to take 'em down.

1040
01:06:31,447 --> 01:06:33,697
(laughing)

1041
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,500
- Hey, here it is.

1042
01:06:42,483 --> 01:06:44,072
Circle of spokes,

1043
01:06:44,072 --> 01:06:47,191
two lines and the shadow,
so we should go this way.

1044
01:06:47,191 --> 01:06:48,123
- Yeah.

1045
01:06:48,123 --> 01:06:50,623
- One, two, three, four, five,

1046
01:06:51,575 --> 01:06:53,192
what's the matter?

1047
01:06:53,192 --> 01:06:54,025
- Nothing.

1048
01:06:54,986 --> 01:06:56,486
- I lost my count.

1049
01:07:00,439 --> 01:07:02,772
One, two, three, four, five,

1050
01:07:04,865 --> 01:07:06,727
what, what's the problem?

1051
01:07:06,727 --> 01:07:08,270
- It's just that you're
not interested in me.

1052
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:11,156
You never asked questions about me.

1053
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:12,721
Where's my family?

1054
01:07:12,721 --> 01:07:13,554
Brothers?

1055
01:07:13,554 --> 01:07:14,387
Sisters?

1056
01:07:14,387 --> 01:07:15,438
What are my hobbies?

1057
01:07:15,438 --> 01:07:16,602
Nothing.

1058
01:07:16,602 --> 01:07:18,510
- M, I'm sorry, okay.

1059
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,427
I've got a lot bigger problems
to deal with right now.

1060
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:21,916
We don't have time for small talk.

1061
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:23,704
Have we not stopped
once since you got here?

1062
01:07:23,704 --> 01:07:24,537
No.

1063
01:07:26,948 --> 01:07:29,125
Look, as soon as we get
some down time we can chat

1064
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:30,892
and you can tell me your
whole life story, okay?

1065
01:07:30,892 --> 01:07:34,942
- Well, I am an only child
from a place called Ishing.

1066
01:07:34,942 --> 01:07:37,897
It's like Cleveland only
the weather is better.

1067
01:07:37,897 --> 01:07:40,794
My hobbies, well, my hobbies
include, I love synchronized

1068
01:07:40,794 --> 01:07:44,961
swimming, playing the dulcimer
and strategic needlepoint.

1069
01:07:46,415 --> 01:07:48,937
- M, I just lost my count
again, so if you'll please

1070
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:50,815
help me out here and be quiet?

1071
01:07:50,815 --> 01:07:52,141
- I'm all out of quiet,

1072
01:07:52,141 --> 01:07:54,058
but I think I can help.

1073
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,201
98 paces.

1074
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:03,784
So, the entrance is very close.

1075
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:13,094
- Found the entrance, huh?

1076
01:08:13,094 --> 01:08:15,511
- So, are you comin' or what?

1077
01:08:21,031 --> 01:08:22,433
- You laugh.

1078
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:24,462
No thank you, no great job M,

1079
01:08:24,462 --> 01:08:26,447
just laughing at my expense.

1080
01:08:26,447 --> 01:08:29,104
I don't know why I do it.

1081
01:08:29,104 --> 01:08:29,937
Come on.

1082
01:08:34,809 --> 01:08:35,809
Oh, my back.

1083
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:39,992
(dramatic music)

1084
01:08:51,133 --> 01:08:52,747
- This may have been a mistake.

1085
01:08:52,747 --> 01:08:54,952
- Yeah, tell him that.

1086
01:08:54,952 --> 01:08:56,297
- Can you get this thing to work?

1087
01:08:56,297 --> 01:08:58,678
- Now I'm the department of power.

1088
01:08:58,678 --> 01:09:01,717
I can tell Casey got all the
imagination in the family.

1089
01:09:01,717 --> 01:09:03,979
Here, hold on to that.

1090
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:05,176
Lantern, lantern in my sight,

1091
01:09:05,176 --> 01:09:07,093
give us a little light.

1092
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:13,887
Voila.

1093
01:09:13,887 --> 01:09:14,843
- Okay, one more time.

1094
01:09:14,843 --> 01:09:18,128
After I get the jewel and the
staff, then what do we do?

1095
01:09:18,128 --> 01:09:20,707
- We go back to the barnyard
where all this started.

1096
01:09:20,707 --> 01:09:22,904
I place the staff into
the haystack and poof,

1097
01:09:22,904 --> 01:09:24,526
away you go.

1098
01:09:24,526 --> 01:09:25,433
- Cool.

1099
01:09:25,433 --> 01:09:26,361
- Maybe cool.

1100
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:28,267
Remember it'll only work
if it's still storming

1101
01:09:28,267 --> 01:09:29,514
outside the museum.

1102
01:09:29,514 --> 01:09:30,347
Let's go.

1103
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,750
(dramatic music)

1104
01:10:01,102 --> 01:10:02,176
Let's go this way.

1105
01:10:02,176 --> 01:10:04,379
I've been wrong before,
but I have a good feeling

1106
01:10:04,379 --> 01:10:05,629
about this way.

1107
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,820
(mumbling)

1108
01:10:19,508 --> 01:10:21,341
- Hey, check this out.

1109
01:10:22,494 --> 01:10:23,972
These stones probably have something to do

1110
01:10:23,972 --> 01:10:26,203
with the challenges Darbin wrote about.

1111
01:10:26,203 --> 01:10:27,316
What do you think M?

1112
01:10:27,316 --> 01:10:30,039
- No question about it, Ben.

1113
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:32,093
- What do you think all these
weird symbols are about?

1114
01:10:32,093 --> 01:10:36,260
- I have a feeling we're
going to find out pretty soon.

1115
01:10:37,182 --> 01:10:39,932
(dramatic music)

1116
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,300
- [Ghostly Voice] Only
intelligent pass in,

1117
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:55,151
thinking freely and able
to use the sixth sense

1118
01:10:55,151 --> 01:10:58,246
will know which stone would
come next in the sequence

1119
01:10:58,246 --> 01:11:02,453
and therefore, should
be placed in the hole.

1120
01:11:02,453 --> 01:11:05,535
- An intelligent person
with a sixth sense?

1121
01:11:05,535 --> 01:11:07,418
What's that supposed to mean?

1122
01:11:07,418 --> 01:11:09,759
- I think ESP is the sixth sense.

1123
01:11:09,759 --> 01:11:12,873
Maybe you should wait til
the stone talks to you.

1124
01:11:12,873 --> 01:11:16,068
- The next stone in the sequence.

1125
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:17,483
- I think it's the last one.

1126
01:11:17,483 --> 01:11:19,043
It's simple like the first one.

1127
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:21,704
Maybe they're like bookends.

1128
01:11:21,704 --> 01:11:22,628
- I don't know M.

1129
01:11:22,628 --> 01:11:24,361
Maybe the clue's in the instructions.

1130
01:11:24,361 --> 01:11:25,444
- Let me see.

1131
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:29,471
(rumbling)

1132
01:11:29,471 --> 01:11:31,936
I don't think I was supposed
to stick my head in the light.

1133
01:11:31,936 --> 01:11:32,769
- What are we supposed to do?

1134
01:11:32,769 --> 01:11:34,034
I can't leave without the jewel.

1135
01:11:34,034 --> 01:11:35,691
- Maybe if you pick the
right stone it'll stop.

1136
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,962
- A sixth sense, a sixth sense.

1137
01:11:37,962 --> 01:11:38,972
- Come on, come on.

1138
01:11:38,972 --> 01:11:39,893
- I don't know.

1139
01:11:39,893 --> 01:11:41,226
- Just pick one.

1140
01:11:46,913 --> 01:11:47,830
- I got it.

1141
01:12:01,456 --> 01:12:03,579
Yeah, a sixth sense.

1142
01:12:03,579 --> 01:12:05,776
First stone, no broken lines.

1143
01:12:05,776 --> 01:12:08,387
Second stone, one broken line.

1144
01:12:08,387 --> 01:12:10,549
Third stone, two broken lines.

1145
01:12:10,549 --> 01:12:13,716
Three, four, five, six, a sixth sense.

1146
01:12:17,502 --> 01:12:19,944
Thank you, thank you.

1147
01:12:19,944 --> 01:12:20,777
- Bravo, bravo.

1148
01:12:20,777 --> 01:12:21,610
- No more calls please.

1149
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:23,027
We have a winner.

1150
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:27,229
I'll be signing autographs
out in front of the cave

1151
01:12:27,229 --> 01:12:29,632
in a half hour, so please
tip your waitresses

1152
01:12:29,632 --> 01:12:31,166
and good night.

1153
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:33,947
- And a good night to you my friend.

1154
01:12:33,947 --> 01:12:34,780
- Uh oh.

1155
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:35,613
- What's that?

1156
01:12:35,613 --> 01:12:36,446
- Uh oh, what'd I do?

1157
01:12:36,446 --> 01:12:37,279
M.

1158
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:38,815
- Align the door.

1159
01:12:38,815 --> 01:12:39,648
The door Ben.

1160
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:40,600
- M, M, can you hear me?

1161
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,328
- Ben, can you hear me?

1162
01:12:43,328 --> 01:12:44,197
- M, can you hear me?

1163
01:12:44,197 --> 01:12:45,049
- Go on Ben.

1164
01:12:45,049 --> 01:12:47,049
I'll meet you out front.

1165
01:12:50,987 --> 01:12:51,820
- Okay.

1166
01:12:53,196 --> 01:12:55,946
(dramatic music)

1167
01:13:03,991 --> 01:13:06,241
- I'm really gonna do this.

1168
01:13:11,151 --> 01:13:13,717
- Case, can you hear me?

1169
01:13:13,717 --> 01:13:16,085
- Yep, loud and clear.

1170
01:13:16,085 --> 01:13:17,269
- M and I got separated.

1171
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:18,487
What's the weather update?

1172
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:21,529
- It's still thundering,
but it's stopped raining.

1173
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:22,978
Ben, are you okay?

1174
01:13:22,978 --> 01:13:24,533
- No, I'm not.

1175
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:27,012
I'm really scared Casey.

1176
01:13:27,012 --> 01:13:29,679
- Oh Ben, I wish I was with you.

1177
01:13:35,104 --> 01:13:35,937
- Great,

1178
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:37,958
room service.

1179
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:41,762
Compliments to the chef.

1180
01:13:41,762 --> 01:13:44,136
I think I ordered the brown slop,

1181
01:13:44,136 --> 01:13:45,598
not the green slop.

1182
01:13:45,598 --> 01:13:47,181
But, thanks anyway.

1183
01:13:52,069 --> 01:13:54,819
(dramatic music)

1184
01:14:05,618 --> 01:14:08,474
- [Ghostly Voice] You have
entered the final chamber.

1185
01:14:08,474 --> 01:14:11,790
Only a mortal strong of
body and mind shall pass

1186
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:13,784
the ultimate test.

1187
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:17,176
To get to the jewel of
Polaris you must prove

1188
01:14:17,176 --> 01:14:19,055
you are worthy

1189
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:20,222
or die trying.

1190
01:14:21,829 --> 01:14:24,579
(dramatic music)

1191
01:14:49,593 --> 01:14:50,464
- They went in the cave?

1192
01:14:50,464 --> 01:14:51,830
- Yes, Your Grace.

1193
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:52,747
- Oh goody.

1194
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:56,471
We've got them.

1195
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:59,221
(dramatic music)

1196
01:15:38,996 --> 01:15:42,663
- Benjamin Scotound,
you get me out of here.

1197
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:53,947
- Uh oh, busted.

1198
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:05,470
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1199
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:07,031
- Who is that?

1200
01:16:07,031 --> 01:16:09,864
- It is I, Darbin and who are you?

1201
01:16:10,788 --> 01:16:13,882
A boy who has successfully
reached this room

1202
01:16:13,882 --> 01:16:17,861
looking for the jewel
of Polaris, I presume.

1203
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:18,940
- Yeah, my name is Ben

1204
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,620
and I'm lookin' for the jewel.

1205
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:24,045
- Do you wish to have it
so you can use its power?

1206
01:16:24,045 --> 01:16:26,862
- Yeah, but I'm not gonna use it for evil.

1207
01:16:26,862 --> 01:16:29,129
I came from the future with my sister

1208
01:16:29,129 --> 01:16:32,077
and we accidentally arrived
the same time as Falco.

1209
01:16:32,077 --> 01:16:34,570
- Falco, I banished him to the canvas.

1210
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,570
- Yeah, well he escaped.

1211
01:16:37,683 --> 01:16:41,285
- Ben, you are not in here by accident.

1212
01:16:41,285 --> 01:16:44,481
You were sent here to help stop Falco.

1213
01:16:44,481 --> 01:16:48,648
Without you the village and
the world will not survive.

1214
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:54,232
Your future will not exist if
Falco takes over the present.

1215
01:16:54,232 --> 01:16:56,496
You must help them.

1216
01:16:56,496 --> 01:16:59,246
If you do you will help yourself.

1217
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:03,114
- I just don't know if I can stop Falco.

1218
01:17:03,114 --> 01:17:04,614
- Close your eyes.

1219
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:07,340
Open your mind.

1220
01:17:08,683 --> 01:17:10,016
Open your heart.

1221
01:17:11,722 --> 01:17:13,305
Now open your hand.

1222
01:17:20,027 --> 01:17:21,694
The jewel of Polaris

1223
01:17:22,621 --> 01:17:23,454
is yours.

1224
01:17:30,518 --> 01:17:31,851
- Thanks Darbin.

1225
01:17:57,945 --> 01:17:59,571
- I'll take the jewel.

1226
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:01,112
- Where's M?

1227
01:18:01,112 --> 01:18:03,869
- Your crazy friend is Falco's prisoner.

1228
01:18:03,869 --> 01:18:05,728
He said when he gets his magic wand back

1229
01:18:05,728 --> 01:18:08,823
he will turn us all into turkeys.

1230
01:18:08,823 --> 01:18:11,934
Give us the jewel now
and we won't kill you

1231
01:18:11,934 --> 01:18:13,702
and your friends.

1232
01:18:13,702 --> 01:18:14,831
- You want the jewel?

1233
01:18:14,831 --> 01:18:17,018
Sure, no problem,

1234
01:18:17,018 --> 01:18:17,851
go fetch.

1235
01:18:19,053 --> 01:18:21,803
(dramatic music)

1236
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:42,428
- You're okay now Ben.

1237
01:18:42,428 --> 01:18:43,845
We've got a plan.

1238
01:18:56,735 --> 01:19:00,120
- Your friend has evaded
my men and is in possession

1239
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,722
of the jewel.

1240
01:19:01,722 --> 01:19:03,751
- He's not my friend, he's my brother

1241
01:19:03,751 --> 01:19:05,703
and I don't care what he has.

1242
01:19:05,703 --> 01:19:07,926
- Well, I hope he's more
cooperative than you are

1243
01:19:07,926 --> 01:19:12,721
because if he doesn't give
me the jewel by sunrise

1244
01:19:12,721 --> 01:19:15,388
tomorrow will be your final day.

1245
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:18,711
- Could we eat first?

1246
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:23,122
- Shut up.

1247
01:19:24,446 --> 01:19:27,196
(dramatic music)

1248
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:51,485
- Hey buddy.

1249
01:19:59,987 --> 01:20:00,898
- Sorry M.

1250
01:20:00,898 --> 01:20:01,731
- It's okay.

1251
01:20:01,731 --> 01:20:02,916
It had a warranty.

1252
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:04,598
And I still have the receipt.

1253
01:20:04,598 --> 01:20:05,431
- Quiet.

1254
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:10,956
You may have bested my
guards, but your friend

1255
01:20:10,956 --> 01:20:14,240
and your sister are still my prisoners.

1256
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,317
If you give me the jewel

1257
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:18,167
I will not harm them.

1258
01:20:18,167 --> 01:20:21,161
In fact, I will set them free.

1259
01:20:21,161 --> 01:20:23,470
Now you can't get fairer than that.

1260
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:24,465
- Don't do it Ben.

1261
01:20:24,465 --> 01:20:25,786
- Listen to Kim, Ben.

1262
01:20:25,786 --> 01:20:28,274
He'll never stick to his word.

1263
01:20:28,274 --> 01:20:30,191
- First, set them free.

1264
01:20:31,338 --> 01:20:33,019
Then, you can have it.

1265
01:20:33,019 --> 01:20:34,177
- Ben, no.

1266
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:35,344
- My pleasure.

1267
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:43,708
- He's good.

1268
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,642
- Now, give me the jewel.

1269
01:20:48,642 --> 01:20:51,030
- You must promise me you'll
never use it for evil.

1270
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,863
- No evil?

1271
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:55,229
You're asking a lot.

1272
01:20:57,173 --> 01:20:58,006
All right.

1273
01:20:58,902 --> 01:20:59,902
It's a deal.

1274
01:21:01,205 --> 01:21:02,038
You.

1275
01:21:02,038 --> 01:21:03,205
- No, Ben, no.

1276
01:21:05,404 --> 01:21:07,154
- I give you my word.

1277
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:19,698
At last (laughing) foolish child.

1278
01:21:19,698 --> 01:21:23,865
Evil is too kinda word for
what I plan to do with you.

1279
01:21:31,982 --> 01:21:34,815
Oh I'm glad you find that amusing.

1280
01:21:42,976 --> 01:21:45,354
- Lookin' for this?

1281
01:21:45,354 --> 01:21:46,187
Or this?

1282
01:21:58,597 --> 01:22:02,413
Falco, you're not wanted
here or anywhere else.

1283
01:22:02,413 --> 01:22:05,445
I send you and your men
back where you belong,

1284
01:22:05,445 --> 01:22:07,320
back into the painting.

1285
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,153
- No.

1286
01:22:15,381 --> 01:22:17,964
(upbeat music)

1287
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:39,128
- Quiet please, thank you.

1288
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:40,919
That was very nice.

1289
01:22:40,919 --> 01:22:42,009
Palmay.

1290
01:22:42,009 --> 01:22:43,192
- Thank you magistrate.

1291
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:46,750
We want to thank you Ben
for saving this village.

1292
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:48,629
Please kneel.

1293
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:51,712
We award you with our Medal of Honor.

1294
01:22:54,617 --> 01:22:55,617
- Thank you.

1295
01:22:56,874 --> 01:22:59,549
I wish I could say my trip was wonderful,

1296
01:22:59,549 --> 01:23:02,323
but it's been a little crazy.

1297
01:23:02,323 --> 01:23:04,712
First of all, I'd like to thank Palmay.

1298
01:23:04,712 --> 01:23:09,024
Although he's a little person
he's got a really big heart.

1299
01:23:09,024 --> 01:23:12,333
And finally, I'd like to
thank M the Magnificent.

1300
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:14,874
Without his help we would not be here.

1301
01:23:14,874 --> 01:23:18,474
With his guidance it
helped me find the jewel

1302
01:23:18,474 --> 01:23:20,846
that will forever protect your village.

1303
01:23:20,846 --> 01:23:23,346
M, I'm sorry I lost your wand.

1304
01:23:26,944 --> 01:23:30,391
You can say something, but
please leave your cursing out.

1305
01:23:30,391 --> 01:23:34,420
It can take a little while
to get used to it, okay.

1306
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,860
- Thank you, thank you one and all.

1307
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:38,843
I'm so glad you're here.

1308
01:23:38,843 --> 01:23:41,287
It gives me great pleasure to say.

1309
01:23:41,287 --> 01:23:42,285
- Casey?

1310
01:23:42,285 --> 01:23:43,361
- Absolutely nothing.

1311
01:23:43,361 --> 01:23:44,778
- I've got Casey.

1312
01:23:48,997 --> 01:23:49,899
- Casey.

1313
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:53,188
- Ben, Falco and his men
are back in the picture.

1314
01:23:53,188 --> 01:23:54,924
What did you do?

1315
01:23:54,924 --> 01:23:57,529
- We did good, Case, real good.

1316
01:23:57,529 --> 01:23:59,475
But, we don't have time to
talk about that right now.

1317
01:23:59,475 --> 01:24:00,828
Is it still raining there?

1318
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:03,200
- No, I think the storm is over.

1319
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,144
- Listen carefully.

1320
01:24:05,144 --> 01:24:07,332
I want you to draw a
picture of a lightning bolt,

1321
01:24:07,332 --> 01:24:08,816
a quick one.

1322
01:24:08,816 --> 01:24:11,033
Put it on the village landscape.

1323
01:24:11,033 --> 01:24:13,496
Do it now and if
everything goes as planned

1324
01:24:13,496 --> 01:24:14,764
we'll be home soon.

1325
01:24:14,764 --> 01:24:15,706
- You got it.

1326
01:24:15,706 --> 01:24:17,446
One lightning bolt comin' up.

1327
01:24:17,446 --> 01:24:18,279
- Roger that.

1328
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:20,196
Come on guys, let's go.

1329
01:24:32,644 --> 01:24:34,394
Sure hope this works.

1330
01:24:36,612 --> 01:24:38,142
- Ben,

1331
01:24:38,142 --> 01:24:40,741
thank you again for saving
my life and the village.

1332
01:24:40,741 --> 01:24:45,506
I'll make sure that your
memory is never ever forgotten.

1333
01:24:45,506 --> 01:24:48,365
- I'll never forget you man.

1334
01:24:48,365 --> 01:24:50,386
M, I don't know what to say.

1335
01:24:50,386 --> 01:24:51,498
You made it all happen.

1336
01:24:51,498 --> 01:24:52,561
Without you I was lost.

1337
01:24:52,561 --> 01:24:54,208
- Don't sell yourself short.

1338
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:55,911
You made it happen.

1339
01:24:55,911 --> 01:24:57,171
- What happens to you now?

1340
01:24:57,171 --> 01:25:00,041
- I become an X-Files episode.

1341
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:00,874
- Cool.

1342
01:25:03,799 --> 01:25:05,814
- Now, you be sure to tell
Casey hello for me, okay?

1343
01:25:05,814 --> 01:25:06,647
- Okay.

1344
01:25:07,997 --> 01:25:10,916
- Now, get the heck outta here.

1345
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:13,901
- Okay, cross your fingers.

1346
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:15,234
Oh, spit it out.

1347
01:25:20,194 --> 01:25:22,694
- I send these two into the passageway,

1348
01:25:22,694 --> 01:25:26,111
back into the place from where they came.

1349
01:25:32,403 --> 01:25:34,487
- Where are those guys?

1350
01:25:34,487 --> 01:25:35,737
I don't get it.

1351
01:25:36,878 --> 01:25:38,878
Ben, Kim, are you there?

1352
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:41,200
Do you hear me?

1353
01:25:42,133 --> 01:25:44,883
(dramatic music)

1354
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,433
- Oh.

1355
01:25:54,874 --> 01:25:57,457
Oh man, that was one wild ride.

1356
01:26:02,968 --> 01:26:04,097
- Casey.

1357
01:26:04,097 --> 01:26:06,491
(screams)

1358
01:26:06,491 --> 01:26:10,158
- [Ghostly Voice] Go
ahead and do something.

1359
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:26,517
- I guess we can thank M for that huh?

1360
01:26:26,517 --> 01:26:28,366
- I could've died.

1361
01:26:28,366 --> 01:26:30,866
I'm so glad you guys are back.

1362
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:33,728
- Ben, I'm proud of you.

1363
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:36,764
- You're proud of me?

1364
01:26:36,764 --> 01:26:38,119
Did you hit your head?

1365
01:26:38,119 --> 01:26:40,032
- Hey, don't push it.

1366
01:26:40,032 --> 01:26:41,927
- What's with the jacket?

1367
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:43,927
And the pretty necklace?

1368
01:26:46,464 --> 01:26:48,119
- Thanks for watching over
her while we were gone.

1369
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:48,952
- Yeah, thanks a lot Monty.

1370
01:26:48,952 --> 01:26:50,075
- My pleasure.

1371
01:26:50,075 --> 01:26:51,707
There was no watching over her.

1372
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:55,636
This little lady can take care of herself.

1373
01:26:55,636 --> 01:26:58,187
- Hey, it looks like we are
having pizza for dinner tonight.

1374
01:26:58,187 --> 01:26:59,937
- Yeah, pizza, pizza.

1375
01:27:01,747 --> 01:27:03,998
- [Narrator] Falco met
his match and was finally

1376
01:27:03,998 --> 01:27:06,554
defeated in the village down below.

1377
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:10,110
As the legend goes his reign ended

1378
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:12,817
when he was outwitted by a young boy

1379
01:27:12,817 --> 01:27:15,984
with the help of a great big magician.

1380
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:21,396
(laughing)

1381
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:27,755
(dramatic music)
