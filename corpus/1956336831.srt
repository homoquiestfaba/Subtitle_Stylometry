Once the wormhole opens,

18
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:03,921
the protons and the energy generated
will break down our molecular structure,

00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,226
Of course you'd be hanging with this herb.

[girl laughs]

175
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:51,338
Fuck you, Jared!
I do not know what I saw in you.

176
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:54,546
- She ain't even on your level.
- [Jared scoffs]

[upbeat Latin music playing]

178
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:03,796
Inappropriate.

179
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,338
What? You used to be all about this dick.

180
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,296
I'm too tired of you lying on me!

181
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,213
- Get off me!
- You asshole!

182
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:14,880
[Sebastian] CJ, stop!

183
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:16,963
Boy, you telling people
I'm not a virgin, huh?

184
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,713
- CJ, stop!
- You asshole!

185
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:20,596
- Someone's gonna call the cops!
- Get off me!

186
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,391
- Just 'cause you a girl, don't mean...
- Don't mean what, lil' nigga?

187
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:25,671
What it don't mean?
What you was about to say?

188
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,380
Bro, why you not talking?
What it don't mean?

189
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:35,046
- Hey, baby! Let's go.
- Get the fuck outta here.

You're a bitch ass!

191
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,505
Yeah, I'll smack the shit out you, nigga.

192
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:43,296
Claudette.

193
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:46,796
Claudette!

194
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,856
I come out of work,
I see some dude 'bout to swing on you.

195
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,720
Then what?
My black ass would've been arrested.

196
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:53,475
I don't need
you always playin' big brother.

197
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,505
Aight. I'm the only big brother you got.

198
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:56,838
You, too, Bash.

199
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,981
- Should've thrown a slushy in his face.
- Know what?

200
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,713
I'm done arguing with you, yo.

201
00:10:00,796 --> 00:10:02,036
You figure out what to tell Mom

202
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:04,008
when she see you out here
acting like a hood rat.

203
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:06,088
All right. Relax. I'm not no hood rat.

204
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,588
That's what you look like to me.

205
00:10:07,671 --> 00:10:10,588
Every time somebody says something to you,
you're just ready to go off.

206
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:11,505
No, I'm not.

207
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:13,481
- Well, you do...
- All right, shut up, Sebastian.

208
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:15,105
Yo, you're the fucking hood rat, Calvin.

209
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:17,296
You're the one Mama has to worry about,
not me.

210
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,005
- [scoffs] You know what?
- Guys.

211
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:21,713
You got a control problem, CJ.
You need to deal with that shit.

212
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,505
You need to deal
with your control problem.

213
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,772
- Always trying to control me.
- We're not the same age.

214
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:27,671
Oh, my God!
You are three years older than me.

215
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:29,671
[cop shouts] Hello! Hey!

216
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,630
- We're good? You're a little loud here.
- Yeah. Everything's fine, officer.

217
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:37,046
Yo! Fair warning, I'm recording!
I'll send this shit viral!

218
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,505
[CJ]
All right. Uh, nothing's wrong, officers.

221
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,796
Are you deaf? We good.
Like my kid sister just said...

222
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,921
Let's see some IDs!

223
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:52,296
- You can't just come over here...
- Now!

224
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,546
- ...asking for fucking IDs.
- Starting with you!

225
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,588
Did you ask Francis Pierre
for his ID before you shot him?

226
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,338
That's right. Still rolling.

Get away from them, <i>Babylon!</i>

230
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,063
We gotta go.
We got something on East 38.

231

You okay?

236
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:47,671
I'm fine.

237
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:52,505
- You have a cut right there.
- I said I'm fine!

238
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:00,755
[CJ] I am so sorry.

239
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,213
Stupid-ass Jared, lying on me?

240
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:05,838
Saying that he was my first?

241
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,088
No, I would never. Not with him.

242
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:10,505
You know, he got the jump on me. [exhales]

243
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,088
'Cause had I seen him, I would've been...
[grunts]

244
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,546
Mm! Ooh, no doubt!

245
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,963
- I had to keep clean or whatever.
- For real.

246
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:25,755
No, but seriously, thanks for what you did
back there at the store. You have my back.

247
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:28,588
Always.

248
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:32,088
Now, unpack this shit.
We got a lot to do before the expo.

249
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,046
You're right. Mm. Okay.

250
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,838
It's gonna be a long-ass week.

251
00:12:37,338 --> 00:12:40,046
Hey, boy. Hey, CJ. What's the business?

252
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:42,380
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Hey, Mr. Thomas.

253
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:46,005
Glad you got home.
Need help with the lawn today.

254
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:48,421
Yeah. We just got back here, um.

255

We have a lot of work to do.
Expo's next week.

256
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:53,213
- So we're on a really tight deadline.
- [Grandpa] Hello, hello.

257
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:56,880
You guys just can't be hanging around
the garage like this all the time.

258
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:58,643
It's not healthy for your brain, you know.

259
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:01,231
[Sebastian] Yeah, we know.
We've been working on this for a year.

260
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,522
- We'll just give it a bit more time...
- [Grandpa] Listen...

261
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:05,586
It'll get us into college.
There'll be scholarships!

262
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,296
- Scholarships? Really?
- [Sebastian] Yes.

263
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,171
Now, I like that. I do!

264
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:13,463
Or is it that you two just like
being together alone too much, eh?

265
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:15,171
[snorts]

267
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,380
Listen, Sebastian.

268
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:20,755
- Expo's next week, right?
- Yeah.

269
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:24,421
Yes, you have enough time to finish
whatever it is that you're doing.

270
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:28,963
After that, you're going to get yourself
a proper summer job, right?

271
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:32,046
Can't have you
in this garage all summer, boy.

272
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:35,713
Make sense? One week, story done.

273

[Sebastian tuts]

274
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:39,671
What is that? What is that you do, boy?
You suck your teeth?

275
00:13:39,755 --> 00:13:40,921
- Nothing.
- Eh?

276
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:42,963
Unless you want to get
a hole in your teeth, eh?

277
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:44,255
[Grandpa sucks teeth]

278
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:56,130
Listen, when we get this up and running,
we gon' be out of here.

to come to their schools.

281
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,380
- Right? Okay.
- Right.

282
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,171
Just gotta put in this work.

[CJ] Hmm.

286
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:25,255
That's what it is. It's the tubing.

287
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:29,421
Yeah, I mean, it looks like the force
of the protons were just too much.

288
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,380
Yeah. Told you
those extra supplies would come in handy.

289

[Sebastian chuckles]

290
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:38,338
All right.

291
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:49,713
Can I help you?

292
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:51,963
We heard y'all got the juice.

293
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:54,630
What kind of juice?

294
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:56,893
- Orange juice?
- With or without the pulp?

295
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:58,880
- With the pulp.
- Who sent you?

296
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:01,130
- Your boy Eduardo sent me.
- And Kimberly sent me.

297
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:04,421

your lemon drops, your jolly chargers,

your sweet tooth headsets,
your hover-selfies...

301
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,213
I just came to get a new battery
for my phone, ma!

302
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:18,755
Yeah, and I'm just here
to pick up my auntie's laptop.

303
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:22,171
- Then why didn't y'all just say that?
- Y'all gotta speak up.

304
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:27,208
[CJ] All right.
Tell her we completely refurbished it.

305
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:29,755
The RAM's been boosted
to a 16 gigabyte DDR3,

306
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:33,713
and we took out the optical drive,
and we replaced it with these new SSDs...

307
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:36,588
Uh, tell her it works like a 2015.

308
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,463

- Word.

00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:54,255
[indistinct dialogue from TV]

339
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:56,880
- Hey, Kimberly.
- Hey, CJ.

340
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:59,088
Thanks for the upgrade
on my laptop, sweetie.

341
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:00,171
No problem.

342
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,546
Let me help my little sis with this.

343
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:23,296
Pshh!

344
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:26,630
All right. Damn.
I know you mad about earlier, aight?

345
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,796
But... I was just looking out for you.

346
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,463
Aight? I'm not trying to, like,
say you can't handle yourself

347
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:35,338
or come off all misogyny and shit either.

348
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,005
"Misogyny" is a noun defined
as the hatredof,

349
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:42,171
or contempt for,
or prejudice against women,

350
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:44,338
while "misogynistic"
is the correct adjective

351
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:46,463
you're looking for to describe <i>you</i>

352
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:49,046
as someone who professes misogyny.

353
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:51,463
Misogynistic.

354
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:55,713
I'm mad you really explained that though.

355
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:59,005
Like you just went mad hog for no reason.

356
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:01,838
I'm a little tired of people telling me
how I should act.

357
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:05,296
CJ, maybe if you listened more,
you would act right.

358
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,130
[water stops]

359
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,338
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

360
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,630
Calm down, aight?
What I'm... All I'm trying to say is,

361
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:14,421
you gotta learn to control
that temper of yours, CJ.

362
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:16,380
Well, I wonder where I get it from.

363
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:20,838
[chuckles]

364
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,421
- Yo...
- [giggles]

365
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:25,713
Yo, I'm just trying to look out for you

366
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:28,046
and make sure you ain't messing
nothing up for yourself.

367
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,130
Aight?

368
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,130
Damn, what was dude saying anyway?

369
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:33,046
He was just talking shit.

370
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:36,130
Look, man, I told you,
these dudes around here...

371
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:39,338
they can't do nothing for you. Aight?

372
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:41,880
You going places, CJ,
and since Pops is gone,

373
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,630
I gotta make sure that you get there.

374
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:47,005
You could go somewhere, too.

375
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:48,796
We could go together.

376
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,755
Get back focus. Take your SATs,
start applying to colleges.

377
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:56,546
You know, we could do big things!

378
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,588
Two Walkers, about to...

379
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,963
[whispers]...explode!

380
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:04,005
Boom!

381
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:09,421
Aight. It do sound better
than washing dishes

382
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:11,713
at the Texas BBQ, all right.
I ain't gonna hold you.

383
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:13,213
- Yeah.
- Word.

384
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:18,630
Damn, I hate it when you smart, man.

385
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:20,713
It's scary, but you inspire me.

386
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:29,046
So, are you gonna let me hold
dad's dog tags, or...

387
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:32,421
Dog tags? I ain't even remember I had
these on. You're talking about these?

388
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,255
- [laughs] Yes.
- Oh, no. Yeah.

389
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:35,838
You only get these over my dead body.

390
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:38,838
- Oh, come on!
- What happened to the medal he gave you?

391
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:43,046
It's upstairs, but I can't wear
that every day. It might fall off.

392
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:44,546
[sighs]

393
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:46,088
I just miss him, yo.

394
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:51,296
Yeah. I miss him, too, you know.

395
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,005
[Mom] Thinking about Dad?

396
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:00,088
Uh...

397
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:02,671
You okay? Hmm?

398
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:06,463
I haven't checked in in a while.

399
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:09,630
I'm, uh, fine. I'm okay.

400
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,546
I know, babe.

401
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,380
Come here.

402
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:26,338
You're just like him, you know that?

403
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:28,046
[chuckles]

404
00:20:28,588 --> 00:20:30,005
You and you brother, but...

405
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:35,088
Boy, I never met anybody as stubborn
as your daddy till I met you.

406
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,213
- Get some rest. Love you.
- Love you, too.

407
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:45,463
Uh, are you going to sleep?

408
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:48,963
I'm probably gonna stay up
for a little while. Catch up on my show.

409
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,921
Waiting up on Calvin?

410
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:53,088
[laughs]

411
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:55,463
Who told you to be so smart, huh?

412
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,255
- [Mom] Hmm?
- [CJ giggles]

413
00:21:01,463 --> 00:21:05,421
<i>All right. This is

If this works, we will time-travel
back one day into the past.

During our jump back, we have agreed
not to make any major changes

418

as to not break the time-space continuum,

419

in ways we could never imagine.

- Look, that wasn't there. Oh, Kim! Kim!
- Kim!

Why you're always acting
like a wiling bitch?

- What the...

- What?

- That's my brother! What now, punk?
- CJ, are you crazy?

488

Damn, bro, what took you so long?

848
00:47:01,713 --> 00:47:04,296
Had to grab some snacks
for y'all ungrateful asses.

850
00:47:14,713 --> 00:47:15,713
So...

851
00:47:16,296 --> 00:47:17,338
what's this about?

852
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,005
Y'all say you need some energy conduits?

853
00:47:22,713 --> 00:47:25,588
Uh, yeah, we need something
that can handle large amounts of energy.

854
00:47:26,755 --> 00:47:28,755
Why don't y'all build
a circuit board or something?

855
00:47:29,963 --> 00:47:31,421
For our specifications,

856
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,255
we need something
with obscene energy capacity.

857
00:47:35,671 --> 00:47:37,380
- Obscene?
- [Sebastian] Yeah.

858
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,380
How obscene?

859
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,130

860
00:47:41,213 --> 00:47:44,088

[Sebastian] Uh...

862
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,880

you built for the end-of-the-year project.

863

[scoffs] Nah! Nah! I'm sorry.
That ain't happening, B.

864

- Yo, listen to me.
- Sorry!

865
00:47:55,463 --> 00:47:57,213
I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important.

866
00:47:57,296 --> 00:48:00,216
- This is the only thing that's gonna work.
- Really? And what's this for?

867
00:48:04,671 --> 00:48:05,963
Um... [clicks tongue]

868
00:48:07,255 --> 00:48:10,713
Some new shit...
that, uh, we can't talk about yet.

869
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:15,463
So, y'all need my shit
to make your new shit,

870
00:48:15,921 --> 00:48:17,505
but you can't tell me shit?

871
00:48:17,588 --> 00:48:19,296
Well, shit. That's pretty much it.

872
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,963
- Yeah.
- What?

873
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,171
Nah! Nah! Sorry!

874
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:35,005
Give us the quantum circuit board,
and I'll go on a date with you.

875
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:38,296
Yes! I've been waiting on you
since the fourth grade.

876
00:48:38,588 --> 00:48:40,546
Imma treat you like a <i>princesa.</i>

Thank you very much.

878
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:50,171

Thank you. Thank you very much.

885
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:25,546
[CJ] So, this is like giving
the TRPs a lobotomy?

886
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,880
[Sebastian] Precisely.

887
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,683
Theoretically, we won't encounter
our previous time-traveling selves.

888
00:49:29,755 --> 00:49:32,421
I mean, those quantum boards
should be able to route enough energy

889
00:49:32,505 --> 00:49:34,713
from the gamma rays
to splice time entirely,

890
00:49:34,796 --> 00:49:37,463

of our previous time jumps.

891
00:49:37,755 --> 00:49:38,963
Whoa, that's wild.

892
00:49:40,213 --> 00:49:41,213
So, tomorrow?

893
00:49:41,963 --> 00:49:42,963
Tomorrow.

894
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:44,505
Let's get some rest.

They take a minute sometimes.

00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:30,005
Dreams of going to college
and becoming a scientist.

1016
00:57:30,088 --> 00:57:34,088
Instead, we now all sit here
mourning his loss,

1017
00:57:34,171 --> 00:57:39,671
a young man in our community full
of endless promise and potential,

1018
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:41,921
whose life been cut short.

1019
00:57:43,671 --> 00:57:45,171
And I have to admit

1020
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:49,171
I, like so many of you out there,

1021
00:57:49,463 --> 00:57:53,255
have to ask, "Where is the justice?

1022
00:57:53,963 --> 00:57:59,380
<i>Where is the justice for our sons,
and our daughters, and our communities?</i>

1023
00:57:59,463 --> 00:58:01,880
<i>When will it end, the grieving,</i>

1024
00:58:02,088 --> 00:58:06,505
<i>not just for Flatbush,
but for the whole nation,</i>

1025
00:58:06,588 --> 00:58:10,130
<i>and all the black
and brown communities within it?</i>"

1026
00:58:10,213 --> 00:58:12,630
<i>What does the Lord require of you,</i>

1027
00:58:12,713 --> 00:58:16,130
<i>but to walk just, and to be mercy,</i>

1028
00:58:16,213 --> 00:58:19,296
<i>and to love and live humbly
by your God?</i>

1029
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,046
<i>And the peace,
that which surpasses all understanding,</i>

1030
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:26,796
<i>will guard your heart
and your mind through Christ Jesus.</i>

1031
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,463
<i>I remember God's promises.</i>

1032
00:58:40,046 --> 00:58:42,755
- Mom?
- In the living room.

1033
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:45,380
[Grandpa sobbing]

1034
00:58:45,505 --> 00:58:46,505
What happened?

1035
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:48,921
Gloria...

1036
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:52,796
She at the Kings County Hospital.

1037
00:58:56,213 --> 00:58:58,380
They said it's a nervous breakdown.

1038
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:02,213
[sniffles]

1039
00:59:02,296 --> 00:59:05,880
She can't stomach to see
Sebastian gone, so...

1040
00:59:05,963 --> 00:59:06,963
[Mom] Mm-hmm.

1041
00:59:08,505 --> 00:59:11,963
[Grandpa sobbing]
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1042
00:59:20,505 --> 00:59:21,505
CJ.

1043
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,880
CJ!

1044
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,880
- Claudette! I know you hear me talking.
- What? I just wanna be left alone!

1045
00:59:28,921 --> 00:59:31,397
- Jesus! Why doesn't anyone...
- Do not play with me right now,

1046
00:59:31,421 --> 00:59:33,630
- and I'm dead-ass. We need to talk.
- What? What?

1047
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:39,130
This some sort of joke?

1048
00:59:41,463 --> 00:59:44,383
- Calvin, where did you get that?
- You know where the hell I got it from.

1049
00:59:45,755 --> 00:59:47,255
Now, explain to me what's going on.

1050
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:50,713
'Cause ain't nothing been right
around here since Sebastian got murdered.

1051
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,421
He was a better person than me,

1052
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,630
and damn sure was
a better friend than you.

1053
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,296
You know... I've been feeling like
this should've been me.

1054
00:59:59,546 --> 01:00:01,005
And then I find this shit?

1055
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,505
So, you tell me, am I wrong?

1056
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:19,296
I can't tell if I'm being punked,

1057
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,838
or if I'm still trying to wake up
from a dream right now.

1058
01:00:22,921 --> 01:00:24,213
Time machines?

1059
01:00:28,463 --> 01:00:29,546
[drops phone]

1060
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,255
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to do anything right now, CJ.

1061
01:00:36,338 --> 01:00:38,171
But I know how to fix this now.

1062
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:40,341
- I... I can handle it.
- You know how to fix it?

1063
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,255
Explain to me exactly how.

1064
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,588
I don't know. I'm just...

1065
01:00:44,963 --> 01:00:46,796
Imma jump back earlier or something.

1066
01:00:48,171 --> 01:00:50,880
You're gonna... You're just gonna
jump back earlier or something?

1067
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:53,213
Claudette...

1068
01:00:53,671 --> 01:00:56,338
explain to me exactly
how you're gonna fix this,

1069
01:00:56,421 --> 01:00:59,546
or I swear to God, on Pops'... grave,

1070
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:02,421
I'm destroying all them
little science experiments you got.

1071
01:01:02,505 --> 01:01:04,380
Calvin, I can't explain it right now.

1072
01:01:05,505 --> 01:01:08,463
How about this,
getting shot by police officers?

1073
01:01:09,505 --> 01:01:12,463
Or better yet, getting both
your asses killed by them damn thugs?

1074
01:01:12,546 --> 01:01:15,755
- Yes, but Sebastian didn't deserve this.
- No, he didn't.

1075
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:17,838
None of us do.

1076
01:01:19,046 --> 01:01:20,880
He didn't, and none of us do.

1077
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,255
[sighs]

1078
01:01:28,005 --> 01:01:32,005
[sighs] I just need some help first,
and then I could devise a plan.

1079
01:01:34,546 --> 01:01:36,713
Okay, then. I'm going with you.

1080
01:01:37,005 --> 01:01:40,796
No, Calvin, have you been listening?
There's only one working time machine.

1081
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,463
It has to be me. There's no other way.

1082
01:01:45,546 --> 01:01:46,546
[sighs]

1083
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,463
What you need
to get it back up and running, man?

1084
01:01:55,088 --> 01:01:57,546
Not "what." Who.

1085
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:01,838
Shit!

1086
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:05,755
CJ?

1087
01:02:07,213 --> 01:02:08,213
CJ!

1088
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:15,088
[knocking]

1089
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,588
[Abuela in Spanish]
Eduardo, who's knocking?

1090
01:02:17,671 --> 01:02:18,921
It's late!

1091
01:02:19,005 --> 01:02:21,338
[in English] CJ! Hey! How...

1092
01:02:23,296 --> 01:02:24,838
How you doing? Um...

1093
01:02:25,671 --> 01:02:27,046
Sorry about Sebastian.

1094
01:02:27,796 --> 01:02:29,505
Shit was crazy. It hit me hard, too.

1095
01:02:29,588 --> 01:02:31,505
I know. That's actually why I'm here.

1096
01:02:32,088 --> 01:02:34,046
Yo. You... Whatever you need.

1097
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:36,170
You need someone to talk to
or a shoulder to cry on.

1098
01:02:36,213 --> 01:02:38,171
No, we need your help, okay?

1099
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,135
Get dressed
and meet us outside in five minutes.

1100
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:42,755
Yo, it's mad late!
My <i>abuela </i>ain't gonna let me...

1101
01:02:42,921 --> 01:02:45,130
Wait. "We"?

1102
01:02:49,338 --> 01:02:51,505
Your bro...
You brought your brother to my house?

1103
01:02:51,588 --> 01:02:55,213
Yeah, and we ain't asking, all right?
Five minutes, and bring your tools.

1104
01:03:07,588 --> 01:03:10,796
Temporal relocation? What... Time travel?

1105
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,880
Man, this is...
This is stupid crazy! This is like...

1106
01:03:14,255 --> 01:03:16,046
[stammers] This shit is...

1107
01:03:25,171 --> 01:03:27,755
[beeping, whirring]

1108
01:03:40,963 --> 01:03:41,963
Yo, what's going on?

1109
01:03:42,046 --> 01:03:43,046
Shh!

1110
01:03:43,671 --> 01:03:46,463
[sucks teeth] Y'all gotta stop telling me
to be quiet, man.

1111
01:03:49,796 --> 01:03:52,296
[CJ] <i>My TRP took a beating
from the last two jumps.</i>

1112
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,380
<i>I can upgrade it, but I think
it might fry the circuit board.</i>

1113
01:03:55,463 --> 01:03:56,463
<i>Can you fix it?</i>

1114
01:03:56,505 --> 01:03:59,713
[Eduardo] <i>Of course, I got you.
Let me work my magic.</i>

1115
01:04:14,005 --> 01:04:18,255
My quantum circuit boards,
the genius creation that it is,

1116
01:04:18,338 --> 01:04:20,921
that y'all tried to repurpose
without my full authorization,

1117
01:04:21,546 --> 01:04:24,713
will create
an individual time splice for CJ.

1118
01:04:26,505 --> 01:04:28,963
<i>All she has to do is attune the frequency</i>

1119
01:04:29,046 --> 01:04:32,171
<i>to the TRP Three
to the TRP she previously used.</i>

1120
01:04:32,546 --> 01:04:38,130
That time splice will allow her
to reset that moment in time.

1121
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,171
This would seamlessly allow her to access

1122
01:04:41,255 --> 01:04:43,880
that moment
without Sebastian ever knowing.

1123
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:48,046
You two then jump back to present day.

1124
01:04:48,713 --> 01:04:50,755
And Sebastian's alive!

1125
01:04:55,796 --> 01:04:56,963
Are you sure about this, bro?

1126
01:04:57,046 --> 01:05:01,338
Hell, yeah! I mean, as much as you can
theoretically guarantee anything

1127
01:05:01,421 --> 01:05:03,046
that has yet to be proven.

1128
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:05,570
But the only way we can know for sure
is if we actually do it.

1129
01:05:14,213 --> 01:05:15,213
Thanks, Eduardo.

1130
01:05:16,005 --> 01:05:17,963
You know, I almost feel bad for you.

1131
01:05:18,463 --> 01:05:21,713
Really?
'Cause I'm still here, boo, <i>princesa,</i>

1132
01:05:21,796 --> 01:05:24,005
<i>- mamacita,</i> bae...
- Yo, yo. Yo!

1133
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:26,630
- You gotta go, bro.
- It's okay. I'm cool.

1134
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:28,380
- Give us some time alone.
- I'm cool.

1135
01:05:28,463 --> 01:05:30,630
You gotta, like,
really calm all that down.

1136
01:05:30,713 --> 01:05:33,838
- You getting a little too comfortable.
- That's cool. I'm cool.

1137
01:05:38,255 --> 01:05:40,213
But I'll never forget this, CJ.

1138
01:05:40,296 --> 01:05:43,505
Yes, you will.
Remember, none of this happened?

1139
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:45,963
[grunts] So close...

1140
01:05:47,088 --> 01:05:48,171
[chuckles]

1141
01:05:49,088 --> 01:05:50,880
You good, though? You set?

1142
01:05:50,963 --> 01:05:54,255
Your rotor-gamma photon-circuit thingy's
connected and all that?

1143
01:05:54,546 --> 01:05:55,963
You got your radio station tuned

1144
01:05:56,046 --> 01:05:58,006
- to the right frequencies and shit, right?
- Yes.

1145
01:05:59,005 --> 01:06:03,463
All right. Look, go back, tell Sebastian
exactly what happened, aight?

1146
01:06:03,546 --> 01:06:05,505
Try to get to us
before we hit Malcolm X Court,

1147
01:06:05,588 --> 01:06:09,005
and then bolt out of there.
Do not stay there. I'm serious.

1148
01:06:09,088 --> 01:06:11,505
Stay far away
from Carlito's bodega and shit,

1149
01:06:11,588 --> 01:06:13,838
- and if you see Jared and...
- Calvin.

1150
01:06:13,921 --> 01:06:15,755
- What?
- I know how to avoid Jared

1151
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,255
now that I've ran into him.

1152
01:06:18,213 --> 01:06:19,338
You're just stalling.

1153
01:06:20,505 --> 01:06:21,838
- Hand them over.
- [sighs]

1154
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:27,380
- You're just loving this, aren't you?
- Uh... No. Well, yes.

1155
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:30,755
But if there's any way to convince you
and Dennis, these are it.

1156
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:32,796
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Every second counts.

1157
01:06:33,546 --> 01:06:34,546
Take it.

1158
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:44,380
Look, man, make sure you try your hardest
to convince me, all right? But just...

1159
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:51,838
Just be safe, Claudette.

1160
01:06:58,588 --> 01:07:00,296
I don't want nothing to happen to you.

1161
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:08,630
It's okay.

1162
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,338
I'll see you yesterday.

1163
01:07:17,588 --> 01:07:18,963
[TRP powers on]

1164
01:07:19,046 --> 01:07:20,338
[rumbling]

1165
01:07:23,296 --> 01:07:26,213
[high-pitched droning]

1166
01:07:27,296 --> 01:07:29,755
[Jamaican man] What the bla...
What the blazes is going...

1167
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:32,588
[coughs]

1168
01:07:32,671 --> 01:07:36,671
Yo! What y'all deal wit? Why you gotta
make so much damn noise and<i> ting?</i>

1169
01:07:37,505 --> 01:07:38,880
Where the hell is she?

1170
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,921
[thump]

1171
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,546
- What took you so long?
- [giggles excitedly]

1172
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:49,380
CJ, what are you... What's going on?

1173
01:07:49,713 --> 01:07:53,171
- No time to explain. Come on. We gotta go.
- What the fuck did you do?

1174
01:07:54,005 --> 01:07:56,380
Domino! Domino on ya tail.

1175
01:07:56,463 --> 01:07:59,505
What is this?
You don't know how to play no dominoes?

1176
01:07:59,588 --> 01:08:01,463
- [laughs]
- [man] Hey, sonny.

1177
01:08:01,546 --> 01:08:04,255
You all right?
You look like you could use a drink.

1178
01:08:04,338 --> 01:08:08,463
No, I'm good. I'm just... I don't know.
I just feel a little off today, man.

1179
01:08:09,713 --> 01:08:10,713
You need a drink.

1180
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:14,546
Yo. We gotta go, dawg.
This lame-ass nigga Jared here.

1181
01:08:17,171 --> 01:08:19,171
What's up?
You 'bout to do something, nigga?

1182
01:08:19,255 --> 01:08:20,255
What's up?

1183
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:22,380
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get the fuck out of here.

1184
01:08:23,213 --> 01:08:26,213
You better not light another one.
You know these are for the cookout later.

1185
01:08:26,296 --> 01:08:27,338
Where did you get that?

1186
01:08:27,421 --> 01:08:31,171
CJ, you're headed the wrong way!
We need to go to Carlito's! Come on!

1187
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:33,630
Watch where you're going!

1188
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:37,380
And y'all still look crazy.

1189
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:39,755
[Dennis] She could definitely get it, huh?

1190
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:41,130
[both laugh]

1191
01:08:41,213 --> 01:08:42,338
[Dennis] Look at her!

1192
01:08:46,046 --> 01:08:49,046
Yo, don't let that Jared dude
get to you, son.

1193
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:53,755
No. I ain't thinking about him, nigga.
It's just... I don't know.

1194
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:56,505
Something about today is just off, bro.

1195
01:08:56,588 --> 01:08:58,088
- [Dennis] Word.
- [Calvin] Word.

1196
01:08:58,171 --> 01:09:01,421
Calvin! Calvin! Oh, my God! Thank God.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

1197
01:09:01,505 --> 01:09:04,046
- What's wrong with y'all?
- What the fuck is y'all wearing?

1198
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,713
Y'all like some <i>Space Odyssey </i>wannabes.

1199
01:09:05,796 --> 01:09:08,314
- Dennis, shut up! Look.
- [Sebastian] We have to get outta here.

1200
01:09:08,338 --> 01:09:09,755
- [CJ] Shh.
- [Sebastian] Come on!

1201
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:15,213
What is this? Some sort of joke?

1202
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:18,713
This shit supposed to be funny?
It's a damn funeral program.

1203
01:09:18,796 --> 01:09:20,880
This shit got my face on it,
disappearing and shit.

1204
01:09:20,963 --> 01:09:23,005
I know. I'm sorry,
but you gotta listen to us, okay?

1205
01:09:23,088 --> 01:09:25,005
Can we go? The cops about to come.
Come on!

1206
01:09:25,088 --> 01:09:28,130
- Why would the cops come here?
- You're going to get killed!

1207
01:09:29,546 --> 01:09:30,546
[Sebastian] CJ.

1208
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:38,421
Okay. Okay. Real funny.
Very funny, very creative.

1209
01:09:38,505 --> 01:09:40,963
Now y'all take that stupid shit
y'all got on off!

1210
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:43,606
- Y'all look ridiculous!
- Look, Carlito's bodega just got robbed.

1211
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:46,147
- We gotta get out of here.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1212
01:09:46,171 --> 01:09:49,130
- Out of the way!
- Where the fuck them niggas going, man?

1213
01:09:49,213 --> 01:09:52,046
Okay, remember these? You gave
these to me. Remember what you said?

1214
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:55,088
"Over my dead body"?
That's how I got these.

1215
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:57,814
- What the fuck? You got my tags?
- It's what I'm trying to tell you.

1216
01:09:57,838 --> 01:09:59,380
- Something bad is...
- Look, stop!

1217
01:09:59,838 --> 01:10:02,314
All right? I don't know when you snuck off
and had copies made,

1218
01:10:02,338 --> 01:10:04,463
but that shit is bootlegged, aight?

1219
01:10:05,088 --> 01:10:07,338
- Yo, fuck y'all. We out, bro.
- Calvin! Jesus Christ!

1220
01:10:07,421 --> 01:10:09,630
- The fuck is wrong with you, bro? Move!
- Stop!

1221
01:10:10,088 --> 01:10:12,588
[siren wails, tires screech]

1222
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,840
- This cannot be fucking happening!
- Yo, what's going on? What's going on?

1223
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,296
CJ. CJ, be calm.

1224
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,671
NYPD, where y'all coming from?

1225
01:10:20,755 --> 01:10:22,880
- Don't touch your pockets.
- Keep your mouth shut.

1226
01:10:22,963 --> 01:10:25,064
- Officer, the ones you want...
- Keep your mouth shut!

1227
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:26,421
I'm telling them what's going on!

1228
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:28,345
- What's going on?
- Stop talking! I'm serious.

1229
01:10:28,421 --> 01:10:31,064
- I need to see some IDs now.
- [Calvin] What's the problem, officer?

1230
01:10:31,088 --> 01:10:32,171
I said IDs, now.

1231
01:10:32,255 --> 01:10:34,380
- What you need to see IDs for?
- IDs, now!

1232
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,088
What, are you tough?

1233
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:39,546
- Calvin.
- [officer] Now!

1234
01:10:41,796 --> 01:10:44,088
Boy, you'd better shit me an ID, quick.

1235
01:10:46,755 --> 01:10:48,995
- You think I'm playing?
- [Dennis] Give it to him, dawg.

1236
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:54,046
- [Calvin] Bullshit, man.
- [officer] Yeah, whatever. Stay put.

1237
01:11:21,546 --> 01:11:24,307
- We got the right to know what's going on.
- Everyone be quiet, okay?

1238
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,338
If this got anything to do with Carlito's
getting robbed, we didn't do it.

1239
01:11:27,421 --> 01:11:29,314
- I didn't mention that.
- [CJ] Calvin, no. Stop.

1240
01:11:29,338 --> 01:11:30,938
- On the ground!
- He didn't do anything!

1241
01:11:30,963 --> 01:11:33,546
Get on the ground! On the ground, now!

1242
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:36,380
- He didn't do anything!
- Get on the ground!

1243
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:38,921
- On the ground!
- [Sebastian] CJ, let's go!

1244
01:11:39,005 --> 01:11:40,671
- Get the fuck down!
- Sebastian!

1245
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:43,880
[Sebastian] CJ! CJ! [grunts]

1246
01:11:44,421 --> 01:11:46,171

I'll see you yesterday.

Why didn't we stick to the plan

1266
01:14:45,296 --> 01:14:46,838
and stop the robbers at the bodega?

1267
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:49,255
What?

1268
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:54,771
How many times have you jumped back, CJ?

1269
01:14:57,421 --> 01:14:59,838
I'm not stupid! I...
You're wearing different clothing.

1270
01:15:04,463 --> 01:15:05,505
Claudette!

1271
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,296
You got no right to hide shit from me.

1272
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,763
- How many times have you jumped back?
- Once.

1273
01:15:10,838 --> 01:15:12,518
- Just once?
- Yes, just once, I'm serious.

1274
01:15:12,796 --> 01:15:13,796
Why?

1275
01:15:14,088 --> 01:15:16,288
We had a surefire plan!
And then you come a minute late,

1276
01:15:16,338 --> 01:15:17,963
and we don't go through with it. Why?

1277
01:15:23,005 --> 01:15:24,671
Why? I'm asking a question!

1278
01:15:25,213 --> 01:15:27,088
Because you died, Sebastian.

1279
01:15:30,171 --> 01:15:31,171
You died...

1280
01:15:32,296 --> 01:15:34,213
'cause the surefire plan fell through.

1281
01:15:54,046 --> 01:15:57,838
But remember, now that I went back,
it's like none of it happened.

1282
01:15:57,921 --> 01:16:01,088
No, no, no, CJ.
You just told me that I get murdered!

1283
01:16:01,588 --> 01:16:03,421
I know.
It's because we didn't do it right.

1284
01:16:03,505 --> 01:16:06,796
No, CJ, that's it. We're not...
We can't do this anymore.

1285
01:16:07,546 --> 01:16:10,255
I'm not willing to risk your life
or my life ever again.

1286
01:16:13,088 --> 01:16:14,088
You're giving up?

1287

1288
01:16:16,463 --> 01:16:17,463
On Calvin?

I thought your friends
were like your chosen family.

1290
01:16:23,171 --> 01:16:24,171
You are.

1291
