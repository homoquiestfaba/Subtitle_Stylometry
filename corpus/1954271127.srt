00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,373
Hi.

3
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,626
I'm here.

4
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,382
It's me...

5
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,885
Fred.

6
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,511
Hey, hello there.

7
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,809
So, I'm here...

8
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,811
with all my stuff.

9
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:52,566
And I came here to--
Anyway, here I am with it.

10
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,820
- I brought it all to your place.
- I see that.

11
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,824
- You can tell me to go if you--
- No, that's not what I--

12
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,827
- Surprise!
- Yes, it's quite the--

13
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:08,665
So, is your plane not something? Is it delayed?
Or what? 'Cause I don't get the--

14
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,421
No, my plane's not... I mean,
I'm here to see you...

15
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,551
and to see if maybe...

16
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,846
we could figure something--

17
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,974
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

18
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,685
You can't stand out on the landing
all day, so yeah, come in.

19
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,563
- I do have to go out soon, though.
- Yeah, no, great.

20
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:35,442
Look, I just didn't know how you were
gonna react, or, you know, what--

21
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,696
and I didn't wanna phone, but then I
though, yeah, I mean, should I phone...

22
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,868
how do you explain away fifty years
of a life over the phone, right?

23
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,997
I mean, I don't think I even have a
calling plan that'll support that.

24
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,876
It's a terrible joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Just a little nervous.

25
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,587
- Why?
- I don't know. I just am.

26
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,715
Well, there's no reason to-- I mean, we know
each other, Fred, we have for a long time.

27
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,385
There's no reason for either of us
to feel bad about things at all.

28
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,720
No, I know. Yeah, I know that.
I don't, you know?

29
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,890
I mean, but I didn't say bad. I
didn't say that.

30
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,726
I said nervous.

31
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,729
- Is that all right?
- Of course.

32
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,733
However you want to feel is
fine. It's okay.

33
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,610
Thanks.

34
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,747
Are you going somewhere or what? 'Cause
that is a lot of stuff you got there.

35
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,040
Oh, yeah, no, I...

36
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,503
On the plane you can only carry on
two things, you know, two bags.

37
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,506
So those two, and then these two
I checked.

38
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,051
And basically I had grabbed
everything from the house...

39
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,679
that was mine and...

40
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,057
well, not everything, but you
know what I mean.

41
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:53,937
Anyway, I did it all when Miriam
was at the store.

42
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,523
How 'bout that? What a coward.

43
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:03,071
Twenty four years of being married to
the woman and that's how I go about it.

44
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,703
Oh, well, I make myself sick.

45
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,998
Maybe you should call her.

46
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,543
Who?

47
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,716
Your wife.

48
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,012
Yeah, no, I will. I mean, at some
point, definitely, I'll call her.

49
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,975
And Chris, what about him?

50
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,106
- I don't know, what about him?
- Well, he's your son, for one thing...

51
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,609
so he's probably gonna want to
know what's up. I know I would.

52
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,694
Yeah, well, probably so.

53
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,114
- Can I get some water?
- Sure.

54
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,579
I don't think he'll like it.

55
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,708
True.

56
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,002
But maybe he doesn't need to
know.

57
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,171
Still.

58
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,629
I suppose, in some strange way, he's
the one who introduced us, though.

59
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:49,636
- Fred.
- No, I'm just saying that you know, kinda--

60
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,763
I introduced us. It wasn't him.

61
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:56,185
No, I know that. I know, I know.
But all I'm saying is that--

62
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,062
It was me. I put the note in
your pocket. So it wasn't him.

63
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:03,859
Yeah, I know, but if he had not
been seeing you, then...

64
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,153
No, no, come on.

65
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,071
What?

66
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,658
No, look, I'm not saying that he should
be, you know, all happy for me...

67
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,869
and he'll understand and
everything, I'm not saying that.

68
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:20,083
- I'm just telling you--
- He still sees me, Chris, from time to time.

69
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,670
We go for lunch, and so I'm not
sure he'll feel very--

70
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,672
You know what I'm saying. You
know exactly.

71
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:34,765
Lunch? Really?

72
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,685
- With Wonderboy?
- Sometimes.

73
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,812
Sometimes other things.

74
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,240
Other things, huh?

75
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,243
I didn't...

76
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:04,253
He's married now, you know? Just
in case he didn't mention it.

77
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,841
He did.

78
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,844
Yes, he is.

79
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:20,853
And he still... really?

80
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,362
And does Mandy know? Mandy is
his wife.

81
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,865
Yeah, I know.

82
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,992
I guess not, but I'm not that
deep a part of his life.

83
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,995
So I don't really know or care.

84
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:43,876
Great. I just bet she doesn't.

85
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,879
No, I guess the same. So go on.

86
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,882
Take it.

87
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,759
Thanks.

88
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,763
I have this terrible dryness in
my mouth.

89
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,016
It's so dry, it's like...

90
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:04,938
This dryness is like hanging in the
back of my throat. Can't get rid of it.

91
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,317
Do you feel sick or anything? Maybe you caught
something recently and it's just starting to--

92
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:12,946
No, that's not it. No. Thank
you, though.

93
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,828
I think I'm gonna go outside and
get a little fresh air.

94
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,790
Sure. Go ahead. I do have to get
ready in a minute, but...

95
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,293
Yeah. You said that.

96
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,331
So, you're going out?

97
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,836
- I am this morning.
- Where to?

98
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:13,924
You know, day off and... I don't
know, shopping?

99
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,847
They're all really sort of days
off for you, though, aren't they?

100
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:23,851
Right? I mean, 'cause you don't really
have a proper, you know, whatever.

101
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,186
Not that I know about any of
that.

102
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:30,899
No, I don't. No. Not a proper
one like you.

103
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,360
We can't all be lawyers, right?

104
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,281
There would be nobody left to
hate.

105
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,203
So you're going out. You're
going shopping.

106
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:48,876
Yeah. Something like that. You
know, seeing friends.

107
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,002
Good.

108
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:54,006
- But nothing specific or...?
- No, I didn't mean that.

109
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,051
Yeah, somewhat specific. Lunch.

110
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,761
Really?

111
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:05,142
Yes. Believe it or not, Fred, there are people
who are expecting to hear from me soon.

112
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:09,438
I'm not calling you a liar. I
was simply asking a question.

113
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,149
What about you? What about this?

114
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:17,029
Yeah, I know, I know. I can't
even wrap my head around it.

115
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,324
- It's wild.
- I know.

116
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:23,160
It is and I just--

117
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,412
Can you sit down?

118
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,457
- No, Fred, we are--
- Please, just sit.

119
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:32,920
- But I'm fine.
- Sit! Sit!

120
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,339
I'm sorry, but it's very uncomfortable
you just standing there.

121
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,342
- It's like you're timing me or something.
- I'm not, I promise.

122
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:41,345
Sit down. I mean, I know, like,
rationally you're not.

123
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:44,181
It just feels like you're, you
know, like...

124
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:50,187
...just keeping me on edge.
That's all. Okay?

125
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,482
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's fine.

126
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,485
It just felt like you we're
trying to, you know...

127
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,070
Thank you.

128
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,074
I'm sitting. Now we can talk.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean--

129
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,368
No, its fine, it's fine, it's
fine.

130
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:08,205
It just felt like you were just trying to
push me out the door, at least in your mind.

131
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,959
I wasn't. I wouldn't do that.
I'm not that kind of person.

132
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:18,382
I know that. I know that. I know that. I
know that now, and I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

133
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,509
You do keep checking you watch.

134
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,970
Yeah, I just have somewhere to
be.

135
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,975
You've made that very clear. You were not expecting me.
You've made that very clear.

136
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,102
I wasn't. It was a surprise.

137
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,980
A good one, I would have hoped.

138
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,108
Yeah, a shock even, but a good
one, yes.

139
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:40,237
Yeah, really? A good one?

140
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:44,116
Yes, a good one. It's nice to
see you.

141
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:47,244
It's nice to see you, too. It's
been a while.

142
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,998
- Yeah, years.
- I know.

143
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,001
And I did what I said I would
do, didn't I?

144
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,421
I stayed away.

145
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:02,259
No matter how hard it was, and it was
particularly hard at the beginning...

146
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,429
when we had first broken it off,
but...

147
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:11,268
I mean, I stayed away.

148
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,563
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

149
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:20,027
I kept my promise. I mean, there were
those e-mails and those phone calls...

150
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:25,449
and the birthday gift that I sent
you, that little iPod thingy...

151
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,285
with your name engraved on it...

152
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:32,164
but really, for the most part...

153
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:36,168
I did what I promised you I
would do, I stayed away.

154
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,295
- Thank you.
- Sure.

155
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,173
For being a gentleman.

156
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,050
Well, I don't know about that...

157
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,470
but I did what I said I would
do.

158
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,306
- Thanks.
- For a long time.

159
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,185
So.

160
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,067
So, yeah.

161
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,487
That's an understatement, right?

162
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:17,459
Yeah, so, what the hell do I do
now?

163
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,090
I mean, honestly, what?

164
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,218
You're not seriously asking my
advice on this, are you?

165
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,262
Kinda, yeah.

166
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,432
I'm not really in a good
position to answer that, Fred.

167
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,352
You just show up, your bags
scattered at your feet.

168
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:38,689
I don't really have answers for
a puzzle like that one.

169
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:42,359
I don't know what to say.

170
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,611
Okay.

171
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:49,658
- I'd like to help you, but I can't.
- Yeah, no, I know. I'm not expecting you to...

172
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:54,371
help me get out of this mess
that I created for myself here.

173
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,374
I wouldn't expect that of you.

174
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,710
Good.

175
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:05,299
I was just hoping you might throw a
few ideas my way, you know, but...

176
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,759
- I told you to call you wife.
- Gee, thanks.

177
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,262
- Well?
- Well what?

178
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:13,140
What good is that gonna do? Make
me say the words, "I left you"?

179
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:18,270
I think she got it. The empty closet
should be a pretty strong indication...

180
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,731
that it wasn't like the rapture
or anything.

181
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:25,402
Then maybe you should just do
what you want to do.

182
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,154
I am. I'm here.

183
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,282
I wanna be here.

184
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:35,704
I mean, is that what you're asking me?
What is it that I want to do exactly?

185
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:40,584
Like if you're saying, "What is it that exactly you want to do?
Where exactly do you want to be?"

186
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:44,421
Then that would be here with
you. Right now.

187
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,673
That's why I'm here.

188
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:52,179
I mean, and that's the first time I've
ever done that, put my needs first.

189
00:16:54,181 --> 00:17:00,437
Right? I've always done the
right thing, the decent thing.

190
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,439
I've never...

191
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,777
- True?
- I'm not disagreeing.

192
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:10,739
Yeah, but you're not exactly waving a fucking
flag in my direction either, are you?

193
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,450
I agree with you, Fred.

194
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,452
- There you go, is that better?
- Yes, thanks.

195
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,582
- Good.
- Don't say it if you don't mean it.

196
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,751
- I won't.
- Obviously not.

197
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:27,339
No, I mean, if you don't feel
it, you know, don't say it.

198
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,466
Don't say it to me. Just say it.
What?

199
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,594
You're being a little bit pushy! You're not pushy.
No, that's the wrong word.

200
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,222
You're being a little bit, you
know, charged up about things.

201
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,351
And it's a little bit unnerving.
Yeah, so just...

202
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,229
Just let it be.

203
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,774
I mean, come on.

204
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,235
I'm not like the Beatles or
something.

205
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,488
That's funny.

206
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:59,496
All right, so anyway, what time
do you have to go?

207
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,332
- No, I'm good on time.
- Take a shower, do what you gotta do.

208
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,793
I'm just gonna stay here. I'm
fine, I'll be all right.

209
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,671
- No, Fred.
- What? No, go, go.

210
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,799
I mean, go ahead. I've seen you in
a towel before, don't be bashful.

211
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,511
It's okay. It's all right. Go do
what you have to do.

212
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,680
- I'm all right.
- No, really, I mean it.

213
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,516
Go douche or whatever that, you
know, whatever.

214
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,810
Fred...

215
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,396
I'm fine, I said.

216
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:28,525
I might throw on some different
clothes, but otherwise...

217
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:32,529
Okay, fine. Yeah, no, good. I
mean, you ought to know, right?

218
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,825
You ought to know your schedule much
better than anyone. Particularly me.

219
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:40,412
- Yeah.
- Even Chris, right?

220
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,664
I should, yeah.

221
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:47,836
How is old Chris doing anyway?
How's Wonderboy doing?

222
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:52,424
He's good. The last time I saw
him, which was--

223
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,552
- When?
- I was just about to say.

224
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,639
- Okay, sorry.
- Fred, come on.

225
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:02,392
Just relax. Everything is fine.

226
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,728
It's okay.

227
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,571
That feels good.

228
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,325
Your hand there.

229
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,331
Your touch.

230
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:45,602
Okay, I'm glad, but I wasn't
trying to...

231
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,730
I know. You were just trying to
comfort me, that's all.

232
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,984
I know you weren't trying to get all sexy
or whatever, you know. I'm not stupid.

233
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,862
- I wasn't calling you anything.
- It's fine.

234
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:58,991
I knew it was what it was if it was
not filled with personal history.

235
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,367
I just wanted to be clear.

236
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,787
I got it. Look, and I just
reacted to it, okay?

237
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:07,749
When I feel a sensation, that's the way
I just react, whether it's good or bad.

238
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,794
I'm a reactive person. That's
the way I am. I have no...

239
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,798
And I'm not gonna apologize for that.
Not to you, not to anybody. So...

240
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,719
Anyway, I don't want to talk about this
anymore because my nerves are shot today...

241
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,930
and I really want you to see me
at my best.

242
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,685
I don't want you to, you know, see
me like some horrible, like--

243
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,607
It's fine. It's okay.

244
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,817
No, it's actually not okay. It's
not.

245
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:36,945
If it were okay, I would be saying to
you, "Hey, you know what? This is okay."

246
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:40,657
But actually this is not an okay
moment for me. Okay?

247
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,830
That was me being funny, okay?

248
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,588
Doesn't that feel good? It feels
good, actually...

249
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,549
to get it all out in one big
rush of laughter like that.

250
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,807
All right, I'm gonna go now.

251
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,646
You didn't mean any of that, did
you?

252
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,858
- No, not a word.
- I could tell.

253
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,864
I don't know what I said to make
you so angry, Fred, but...

254
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,867
- I'm not angry.
- You are, right now, aggressive.

255
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,830
Yeah, maybe a little aggressive.
Yeah, maybe a little.

256
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,584
However it feels, it's coming
off of you in waves.

257
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,546
Big tsunami waves of anger...

258
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:39,883
and it's hitting me so hard in
the chest, I feel...

259
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:42,594
I don't know, I feel...

260
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,893
I feel ready to start crying,
just right now as I sit here.

261
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,604
Just in case that's what you're
looking for.

262
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,898
I'm just being honest.

263
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,028
Sorry.

264
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,490
That's not what I...

265
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,910
That's not what I wanted. I'm
sorry.

266
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,914
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

267
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,751
I'm sorry.

268
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,504
I'm sorry.

269
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,635
I really am sorry, Velvet.

270
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,764
Don't do that.

271
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,892
What?

272
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:33,520
Velvet. Don't call me that.

273
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,772
Really?

274
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,524
Yeah. Why would I...?

275
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:43,655
Why would I want you calling me that now,
years later, when I'm not that girl anymore?

276
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,532
Please respect that.

277
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,662
- No.
- What's no?

278
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:54,541
Well, because I don't
necessarily believe that's true.

279
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,961
Excuse me?

280
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,922
- Excuse me, Fred?
- What?

281
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,924
How the fuck would you know what I'm
doing with my life unless you're here...

282
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,551
're me and
he day to day of what I'm doing?

283
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,678
How do you have an answer for
that?

284
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,931
- Because of what you said before.
- What was that? What did I say?

285
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,099
- About Chris.
- What?

286
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,686
About Chris, my son, whom you
used to go out with...

287
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,564
and who you now see privately.

288
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,816
That's what made me believe it.
That little fact.

289
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:23,987
- I said we go for lunch sometimes.
- And then, "And sometimes other stuff."

290
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,823
- I didn't mean--
- But you said, "And sometimes other stuff."

291
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,702
- I didn't mean "that."
- You just said it two minutes ago, Velvet.

292
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:33,580
Stop calling me Velvet!

293
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,584
All right! Okay! You stop! Stop
yelling at me!

294
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,837
I'm yelling because you keep
calling me Velvet!

295
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,840
All right! All right! So stop!
Fine! Just stop it!

296
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,593
Stop it. I'm stopping because
this is ridiculous

297
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:49,137
This is fucking ridiculous.

298
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,849
That's not me, that's not who I
am.

299
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,601
If you ask anyone in my life,
it's not anyone I associate with.

300
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,728
And if Chris were here, he really
would tell you the same thing.

301
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,021
Or anyone else that I'm seeing.

302
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,024
Seeing? I love how you put it
like that.

303
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,863
You make it sound so proper.
"Seeing. I'm seeing someone."

304
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:08,156
- How many guys are you "seeing"?
- No!

305
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,909
Seeing as in go for a quick
drink with or whatever!

306
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,036
I'm in a place in my life, Fred, believe it or not,
where I actually have friends or boyfriends...

307
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,039
not serious boyfriends, but
that's cool with me.

308
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,626
That's cool because that's what I need right now, the
space and the freedom and the plain old "me" time.

309
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,629
The thing to do what I do, which
is my work and my school...

310
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,632
and all the things I'm doing,
much like finding myself.

311
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,760
And I know it sounds mystical and bullshitty
to you, but that's not the fucking point.

312
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,680
The point is that I'm not longer called
Velvet in my life, and everyone that---

313
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,640
- I'm going.
- Nobody's stopping you.

314
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,893
No, you are, actually, Fred. In
a big way.

315
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:39,771
It may not feel like it, but you're putting
a huge fucking block in my road, okay?

316
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:43,817
- Really.
- I don't want to be rude, but you are.

317
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,903
It's starting to make me, I don't
know, a little bit worried...

318
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,029
I guess, having you here.

319
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,241
Worried?

320
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:50,259
Where'd you get that name anyway?
Velvet. Where'd it come from?

321
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:52,845
Oh, come on. Shit, I don't know.

322
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:56,265
- You know. Of course you do.
- No, I don't! I just started using it!

323
00:25:56,265 --> 00:26:01,270
Bullshit. Come on. Was it some guy
gave it to you, like a nickname?

324
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,981
No.

325
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:08,735
Well, what is it then? Is it for
like, what...

326
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:09,987
the way that your, like...

327
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:15,742
snatch feels around a guy's
thing?

328
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,998
Your cunt? I mean, I'd believe
that if you told me that.

329
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,296
Or your mouth? How soft your
mouth is?

330
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,179
That's what I was wearing when a guy
first fucked me when I was nine.

331
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,765
I was raped in a dress I was wearing
to church that had velvet bows on it.

332
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,769
Do you still like it? Velvet?

333
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,024
No. Not as much.

334
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:51,195
Well, then.

335
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,326
Jesus, is that...?

336
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:00,787
Now you know.

337
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,917
I mean, is that... honestly?

338
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:14,343
No. God, no.

339
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:19,932
You really think I'd fucking tell you something
personal about myself? Fat fucking chance.

340
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:23,977
You bitch. That's horrible.

341
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,939
Which part, the story or the
fact that it didn't happen?

342
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:29,942
- All of it. Both.
- Well, don't worry...

343
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:33,111
I'm sure it's happened to
somebody else.

344
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:36,949
Just not me. Well, not like that
anyway.

345
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,951
All right, I have to go.

346
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,829
Wait, wait, wait. Whoever this
person is...

347
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:46,250
you can put him off for a while, all right?
Come on, you have a guest.

348
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,962
- Guest I knew nothing about.
- Yeah, but so what? I'm here now.

349
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:52,840
- I can't.
- Why? Come on, wait, wait, wait.

350
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,843
I can't, Fred. I gave my word.

351
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:59,847
Sorry, I didn't realize it was that serious.
You gave your word.

352
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:03,100
What are you, like some fucking
Indian chief?

353
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,895
Who the fuck talks like that
anymore? "I gave my word."

354
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,231
I mean, who talks like that?

355
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:12,276
I can't. I said I can't, so I
won't.

356
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:14,862
All right, okay, yeah, great.
I'll just let you go.

357
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:18,115
Have your latte with your
married fella.

358
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:22,870
He's gonna tell his spouse that he has to run
back to the office really quickly "today, honey."

359
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,289
Forgive me...

360
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:30,127
for being so pedestrian about my
affairs, my comings and goings.

361
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,006
See, I wished that you felt that
way...

362
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:40,429
but I don't believe it for a second
that you feel at all contrite.

363
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:44,141
Oh, shit. What now, huh?

364
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:46,894
What? What now?

365
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:49,271
You can't even let a person say
sorry anymore...

366
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:53,442
without jumping on it and
challenging every fucking word.

367
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:55,944
What's the problem now?

368
00:28:55,944 --> 00:29:00,157
That. That. That. Exactly that.

369
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:05,037
That you do not feel one little bit sorry
for what you do or who you do it with.

370
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:10,501
- Not a bit.
- Just go. Just go before I get all...

371
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:13,253
- What?
- What?

372
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,923
What? Before you get all what?
Finish it.

373
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:18,258
What's the next line after that?
What is it?

374
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,469
I love when people do this, it
makes me laugh. Really.

375
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:23,263
They say these things, but then have
nothing to back it up. What is it?

376
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,308
What are you talking about? I
just said, go.

377
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,061
No. You made a threat. Let's
call it what it was.

378
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,480
It was a threat. You threatened
me.

379
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,275
You said "don't make me get
all..." what?

380
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:38,445
- What's next?
- Fred, just go!

381
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,948
No. I want to know what would
happen.

382
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:44,076
What would happen if I chose not
to honor your request?

383
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:48,372
Gosh, I don't know, I mean--

384
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:51,500
Okay.

385
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,211
What would I do...

386
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:57,381
if you wouldn't leave and you
stayed?

387
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:59,591
Okay, here's what I'd do.

388
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:05,347
I would go upstairs, I would
lock the door...

389
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:09,393
I would count to 100, and I
would pray...

390
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:12,229
that you're gone when I came
down.

391
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,108
That's what I'd do, Fred. That's
all I got.

392
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:19,528
- That's my plan.
- Well, that's good.

393
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:21,113
At least it's something.

394
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:23,574
Fred.

395
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:28,245
That's good. You have your little
plan, and that's good to have that.

396
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:31,123
But just so you know, I mean, it
wouldn't stop me.

397
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,002
- Please don't say things like that.
- What?

398
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,422
Please don't say things like
that.

399
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,090
Why? I'm not going to attack
you.

400
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,260
Oh, come on. But I'm serious.

401
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,012
I mean, if you go up there and you close
your bedroom door, it'll take me how long...

402
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,140
maybe five minutes to punch or
kick my way through it.

403
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,602
Right? Tops.

404
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:55,397
So I don't want you feeling all secure
when you go up there and you close it...

405
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:59,151
and you push that little button
on the handle. There.

406
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:04,198
I mean, you're dreaming if you think
that that's going to make you feel safe.

407
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,162
If I wanted to get at you.

408
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:14,583
Well, then I'd just leave the
door open...

409
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:19,463
and hope that you snap out of
this and go.

410
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:27,054
- Boy, you really want me gone, don't you?
- Yeah, I do.

411
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,058
And you really want me outta
here.

412
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,187
You just want me to go. Can't
wait.

413
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:37,314
You're about one minute away from
being officially not welcome here.

414
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:40,192
Seriously, sixty seconds from
it.

415
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:42,444
- That's a threat.
- Really?

416
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:46,073
How'd I do that? Big guy like
you? How's I able to do that?

417
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,493
I don't know. Like that. You
could do that. I don't know.

418
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,203
You could break something.

419
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:53,497
You could do that. You could do
that.

420
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,418
You could call the cops.

421
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:06,635
That wouldn't be good for either
of us.

422
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:08,512
Yeah, no, you're right.

423
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:11,640
Not with all that cash...

424
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,352
you no doubt have stashed around
here someplace.

425
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:21,608
All that unearned income, right? Well, I
guess it isn't really that unearned, is it?

426
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:25,487
'Cause you work pretty hard for
it, don't you?

427
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:28,115
Now, how else would you get me
outta here?

428
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:35,247
I'd ask nicely, Fred. And I
will.

429
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,501
Fred...

430
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,379
it's been really good to see
you.

431
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:45,132
Even if you don't believe it,
it's true. I'm glad.

432
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,302
And maybe we can get a meal
sometime.

433
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:51,138
Yeah, that'd be good, yeah. Lunch.
Yeah, that'd be great. Let's eat.

434
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,140
Fuck you!

435
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:57,186
I guess that is the point, really. It's why
I came back here, 'cause I wanna fuck you.

436
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:01,481
Fuck you, Fred! I'm trying to be
some sort of civil person here.

437
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:05,360
Yeah, okay. Yeah, all right. But
I mean, lunch? Really?

438
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,156
Whatever.

439
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:12,534
Don't do that. Don't say that.

440
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,704
I can't stand the way you...

441
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:18,332
young people say...

442
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:23,295
And you use it for everything. You make
it fit for every little thing that you--

443
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:26,548
But do you want to have lunch
with me? Is that what you want?

444
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:30,719
Do you want to sit down and eat
a salad or something and talk?

445
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,180
Because I would love nothing
more than that.

446
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:37,726
That's what I would love. That's
why I came.

447
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,273
Or is that gonna cost me like
$500?

448
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:48,195
Actually, I make up to $800 these days,
so yeah I do sometimes call that "lunch".

449
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,741
What about with Chris?

450
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:54,201
What do you call it with him, lunch or
do you call it something different?

451
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,829
- That is different 'cause he's special.
- Yeah, I bet.

452
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:01,375
He is. I don't know why it matters to you because
it doesn't even matter what you think...

453
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:04,503
but Chris is very dear to my heart.
He's one of my great friends.

454
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,547
I can tell him anything. I can
tell him my feelings.

455
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:10,843
I can tell him my actual dreams
and all that shit.

456
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:15,597
You know he helped me get into art school?
I don't know if you know that.

457
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,724
No, I didn't. No. That's
wonderful.

458
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:21,436
- Yeah. It's real wonderful.
- So, he and Mandy?

459
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:24,773
Or just him?

460
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:28,652
You can be such a fucking bastard, Fred,
that sometimes it's actually breathtaking.

461
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:33,490
No. What I am is a fucking fool.

462
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:36,618
What a fucking idiot I was...

463
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:41,373
to think I could come back here and try
to resurrect this fucking hopeless--

464
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,542
Let me ask you a question.

465
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:46,420
When you first saw me when I came back
here today, did you feel that way?

466
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,256
- No. But now, yes.
- Now yes?

467
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:53,385
But you're telling me, when I first
arrived and you saw me at the door...

468
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:56,263
didn't your heart just drop a little bit?
You thought like, "Aw fuck."

469
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,808
"What the fuck is Fred doing
here?" Tell me the truth.

470
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:03,520
- It was a surprise.
- A nice surprise?

471
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,647
Yeah, it was surprising. That
was my first--

472
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:07,691
You caught me off guard, Fred.
That's what happened.

473
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,652
So that was my first reaction,
surprise.

474
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:13,655
Yeah, not anger, not feeling
sick.

475
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:18,535
It was nice to see your face. But it's surprising
for you to be here with me like this, it is.

476
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:21,413
No, I know. I totally agree.

477
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:23,290
- Okay.
- I mean, I agree with that.

478
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,543
Thanks. Thank you.

479
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:29,421
But that's what I love about it.
That's why I'm here.

480
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:32,674
The honesty, the surprise, I
mean...

481
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:34,301
- Do you?
- Yes! That's why I'm here.

482
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:39,681
You're seeing me! I wanted to show
you me, for the first time, naked.

483
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,850
This is me.

484
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,562
This is the Fred that I always
wanted to show you.

485
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:48,565
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah, but I don't think you understand.

486
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,485
I just don't think you get it.

487
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:54,321
I have not been this person for
a long time.

488
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:57,824
I mean, maybe not ever.

489
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,870
Or maybe the first time I saw you, that's when.
Maybe not even then. I don't know.

490
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,541
Do you remember that? Do you remember
the first time that I saw you?

491
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,709
When Chris brought you up to the
lake house...

492
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:11,964
and I was standing there grilling
at the barbecue like an asshole...

493
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:15,717
babbling away, talking to you,
making small talk.

494
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:17,678
and Chris went into the house and
he was talking to his mother?

495
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:19,555
Do you remember?

496
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,557
And I'm sitting there jabbering
on and on and on...

497
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,602
and I was staring at you and you
were staring at me...

498
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:30,941
and you had that cute little
smile on your lips.

499
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:36,947
You just stared into my eyes, and
I don't think you blinked once.

500
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:39,741
And then you walked away...

501
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,452
and you went into the house...

502
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:45,372
to find my son.

503
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,627
And I knew then...

504
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:53,505
that we had to be together, that
I had to be with you.

505
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:57,843
And that there was nobody more
important, more beautiful...

506
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:01,638
or worth spending my time with.

507
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,390
I knew that I loved you.

508
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:06,935
And It's taken me a long time to
get there.

509
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:11,398
And that's why I've come here.

510
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:16,945
To get down on one knee and to
tell you how much I love you.

511
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:37,424
It's been four years, though.

512
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:43,764
I know. I know.

513
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:46,558
Do you? Okay, just so you do.

514
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,894
I do.

515
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:51,438
Well, people...

516
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,816
You know, people can do...

517
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:56,026
Things can be...

518
00:37:57,027 --> 00:38:00,656
Yeah, people do funny things.

519
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:02,991
Yeah. I know.

520
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:09,998
Why are you doing this to me
today, Fred?

521
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:13,877
'Cause I don't feel the same way
for you.

522
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,008
Not in the same way that you're
saying.

523
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:23,887
I don't. Not anymore.

524
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,766
- You don't?
- No.

525
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:02,759
I'm sorry.

526
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:07,055
I'm sorry.

527
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:17,774
Really, Fred, though, how could
I, you know? It's been so long.

528
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:21,778
How is it possible? I mean, how
really--

529
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:23,822
I'm sorry.

530
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:28,911
You know, you said sorry before and
it didn't sound so great then.

531
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:32,789
And now it just sounds repetitive. So could
you come up with something else maybe?

532
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:38,545
Oh, God. Please don't be mean
right now.

533
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,797
Well, what do you want me to be?

534
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:43,550
I just left my other life for
you.

535
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,802
For you!

536
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:49,681
- I didn't ask you to.
- No, I know that.

537
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:53,101
Okay, you're right. I'm aware of that
little crack in my fucking armor...

538
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:56,563
or my plan, or whichever one of those
fucking things gets a crack in it.

539
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,691
But still, what I did was I left
it for you. Okay?

540
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:01,818
- And, Fred, it's very flattering.
- Oh, come on!

541
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:04,947
Don't fucking do that! Don't be
condescending to me!

542
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:08,116
I am not a fucking toddler!

543
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:12,120
All right? Things are not going
great for me right now, okay?

544
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,959
So all I'm saying is that I threw away,
I pissed away my other life for you.

545
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,211
I'm sorry I didn't call first.

546
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:21,839
- Stop.
- Stop? No, I can't stop. I can't.

547
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,966
So hang on to your hats, okay?
Hang on to them!

548
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:27,719
Who the fuck says that anyway?
Is it the cowboys?

549
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,848
Not like the football team or
the whatever. Not those.

550
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:34,685
Like the wild west guys that go-- Is it them?
I don't know. Fuck them.

551
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:37,145
- I'm not sure.
- You what?

552
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:40,649
I really do have to go make a call because
I'm actually close to being late.

553
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:44,862
Are you really? That's okay, I'm sure that
he'll wait for you. He'll have an appetizer.

554
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:47,781
That's not the point. It's the
right thing to do.

555
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:52,870
The right thing. To call? Is that how you do it now?
It's done with a call?

556
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,665
- And I'd do the same for you.
- You would? Thank you so much.

557
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:58,792
God, that's so nice of you.

558
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,962
It's really true what they say about you girls.
You really do have hearts of gold.

559
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:04,047
Fuck, Fred! Fuck! What do you
want me to do!

560
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:08,177
Seriously, what is it that you
want me to do for you!

561
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:11,805
What is it? Just tell me what it
is!

562
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,641
Ultimately, I want you to suck
my cock.

563
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:17,686
But I'm willing to sweet talk
you a little more first.

564
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:19,938
Gee, thanks.

565
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:25,152
It's all right. Thank you for being so good
at your job and so goddamned understanding.

566
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:28,030
Fred, I gotta make a call upstairs.
So you do what you want to do.

567
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,240
- No, no, wait, wait.
- Whatever it is you want to do.

568
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,910
- Wait! Wait! Just--
- No, Fred, no.

569
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,662
- No, no, no!
- Don't stand in front of me like that!

570
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:37,789
Why not? Why shouldn't I make
things hard for you?

571
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:39,917
- Stop it. Stop it!
- Why? Tell me why?

572
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,211
- Come here. Sit down.
- No, stop it!

573
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,921
Come on. Sit down. I want to
talk to you.

574
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:47,216
Look, don't do it. Don't
push me, okay? Don't.

575
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:49,927
Don't do it. I don't want to be
pushed today, all right?

576
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,054
I want you to sit down and I want
you to talk to me. Sit down.

577
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:55,682
- Or what?
- Or what?

578
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:59,811
Really? Don't push me. You don't
want to know "or what".

579
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,688
Sit down.

580
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,702
- Now, do you need to make a phone call?
- I'm sitting.

581
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,247
- Good.
- I'm sitting.

582
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:21,083
So go ahead, make your call.

583
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,836
I have to go upstairs and make
it from the land line...

584
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:26,839
'cause otherwise he won't recognize
the number and he won't answer.

585
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:29,842
Okay, so go up and get it.

586
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:32,719
- Can I go now?
- Yeah, go, yeah.

587
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,722
Go ahead. I'll wait here.

588
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:39,101
- I'm getting up, okay?
- Yeah, get up and go get it, yeah!

589
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:42,771
Don't be so fucking dramatic.

590
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,331
You find it?

591
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:46,960
Did you find your phone?

592
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:14,363
Use your sexy voice.

593
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:39,263
Hi, yeah, it's me.

594
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:44,393
I'm just calling because I'm
gonna be...

595
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:48,856
I'm running a little bit behind.
Is that okay?

596
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:54,903
Yeah, what time do they stop
serving lunch?

597
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:58,115
Do you know what time the
kitchen closes?

598
00:44:58,115 --> 00:44:59,867
"Lunch".

599
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:02,995
No. No, that was the TV.

600
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:07,875
Hold on. Let me just turn it
down.

601
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:11,003
What was that?

602
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:19,469
That's so true.

603
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,139
We can do whatever we want.

604
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:29,271
I can't wait, either.

605
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:33,108
All right, Chris. Okay. Bye.
Bye.

606
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:39,907
No.

607
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:41,909
Chris?

608
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:46,914
No. My Chris?

609
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:48,040
Yeah.

610
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:55,923
No way. Seriously, who was that?

611
00:45:56,924 --> 00:46:01,178
It was Chris. I'm meeting him later.
I'm supposed to be there any minute.

612
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,475
Well, you better get going then.

613
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:09,269
Fuck.

614
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:12,564
- You told me to call from here.
- You could've resisted, all right?

615
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:15,317
Put up a little fight, at least
for my sake.

616
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,196
That's bullshit. You bullied me into it.
Now you can't act all hurt when--

617
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:21,198
This is unbelievable.

618
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:24,493
Fuck! Oh, my God! The irony of
it. I leave his mother today...

619
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:29,331
to come and be with you, and you're
going out to meet him for lunch!

620
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:32,209
Oh, my God!

621
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:34,586
- Sorry.
- No, don't be.

622
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:37,965
- It's okay.
- Fred.

623
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:42,344
No. You've broken the spell.

624
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:43,262
Thank you.

625
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:09,997
When you're settled, maybe we
can talk about this...

626
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,416
and, you know, have a...

627
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:17,129
- There's another one.
- What?

628
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:19,464
Another half sentence that you
have no intention of finishing.

629
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:22,342
- No, it isn't.
- Really?

630
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:26,388
Okay, all right, all right,
let's finish it then. Okay?

631
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:31,560
So, maybe when I get to my hotel
room and I get settled...

632
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,272
I take my socks and I put them away
in the drawer and all that, what?

633
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:40,152
What do I do? I sit around and I
wait for you call?

634
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:42,029
For lunch?

635
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,158
- What?
- And then..

636
00:47:46,158 --> 00:47:49,161
then maybe we can, you know...

637
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:53,582
talk about this thing between us
and...

638
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:59,296
I don't know. Just not now. Just
not now.

639
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:03,425
No, not when you're about to go
get my son's cock up your ass.

640
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:06,178
That is bad timing.

641
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:12,059
You're being so horrible today,
Fred.

642
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:17,606
Horrible. What have I done to
you?

643
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:22,069
- Do you really want the answer to that?
- Yeah.

644
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,322
I do, Fred, actually.

645
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:29,076
Even if it makes me late, I do
want an answer to that.

646
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:41,171
I don't know.

647
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,634
All I know is that...

648
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:48,762
I just hate you now. Because if I can't
have you, that's all I have left, hate.

649
00:48:50,514 --> 00:48:53,100
Because if I can't have you,
that's all I have left.

650
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:56,603
Hate.

651
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:02,651
How is that fair? I mean, to
another person.

652
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:10,242
Who said anything about fair?

653
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:13,370
I mean...

654
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,455
have you at all been listening
to me?

655
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:17,541
- Yeah.
- You have?

656
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:20,377
Because...

657
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:26,133
we're talking about love here.
Okay?

658
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:29,136
Love.

659
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:34,141
When has love ever been fair?

660
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,145
I guess that's right.

661
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:42,399
It's completely right.

662
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:48,697
Fred, maybe we can talk about
this...

663
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:53,160
another time, you know, when...

664
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,413
I don't know.

665
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:01,710
- When?
- I don't know.

666
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:06,423
Sometime in the near future.

667
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:09,301
Okay. well, just give me a time.

668
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,846
I mean, if I have to make an
appointment with you or something...

669
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,182
I'd rather do that and get it on
the books.

670
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:22,439
- We don't have to do that right now.
- No, no. It's easier for me.

671
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:28,612
- So, what, Tuesday?
- Let me check.

672
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:35,452
All right, Tuesday.

673
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,463
I can't. I have class then.

674
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:51,218
- Wednesday. What about Wednesday?
- No, I can't do Wednesday. I'm booked.

675
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,471
Monday. I left out Monday.

676
00:50:57,474 --> 00:51:01,478
No I can't. I can't do Monday.

677
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,609
All right, I don't know, you just tell me.
Tell me when. Tell me.

678
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:11,488
I can do... How's next weekend?

679
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:16,493
Really? You're gonna squeeze me
in on the weekend?

680
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,620
Like squeeze me in on Saturday?

681
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:22,249
No, I can't do... How's Sunday?

682
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,253
Are you serious? Really?

683
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:32,509
"I can't do Saturday, but I can
do Sunday"? Really?

684
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:34,511
Yeah.

685
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:38,807
Okay, yeah. No, that's fine. Yeah,
I mean, that's fine. Whatever.

686
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:41,435
I'm here for you, okay? And if
you need that...

687
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:43,645
you know, whatever you need. You
know, I'm here for you.

688
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:47,482
If you need to squeeze me in between your
yoga class and your job and your dog...

689
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:50,402
whatever the-- you know.

690
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:53,530
Maybe I should just take that shuttle
right back to Maryland right now.

691
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:56,283
- Maybe that's what I should do.
- Maybe you should.

692
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:59,411
Excuse me?

693
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,789
- Nothing.
- No, go ahead, say it.

694
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:06,835
I said, maybe you should. Maybe you
should go home and think about it...

695
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:09,838
and then call me on the phone...

696
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,425
and we can talk about it and see,
you know, what's what and...

697
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:15,594
We don't have to have this big
scene here.

698
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:19,681
- You think this is big?
- I do, yeah.

699
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:23,519
- Then you have a lousy memory.
- Why, 'cause of how we ended?

700
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,687
- Exactly.
- No, I haven't forgotten that.

701
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:28,565
Really? That's good, great,
awesome.

702
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:33,695
What are you so angry about,
Fred?

703
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:38,700
So bitter. I haven't done
anything.

704
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:43,455
So what? Shit happens to people who
haven't done anything all the time.

705
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:45,582
What does it matter?

706
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:48,585
It just depends on how we deal
with it when it lands at our feet.

707
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:51,839
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that is right. That's the truth.

708
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,716
The lesson is in the struggle.

709
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:57,344
That's what makes us shine...

710
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:00,514
or roll over and die like little
bitches in the dirt...

711
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:05,853
with our guts exposed and flies
shitting in our open mouths.

712
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:18,490
I'm sorry.

713
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:23,912
I'm not mad. I'm just...

714
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:29,459
I'm just very, very
disappointed.

715
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:31,503
I understand.

716
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:35,757
No, you don't.

717
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:41,388
Because if you did, you would
crawl over here and blow me.

718
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:44,641
Just out of sympathy.

719
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:51,899
Is that what you'd like?

720
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,652
I wouldn't hate it.

721
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,532
Is that what you'd like?

722
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:08,415
Would that make you happy? Would
it?

723
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,585
Don't, don't. Don't touch.
Don't.

724
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:13,712
Would it make you happy?

725
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:15,797
Don't! Don't! Don't do that!

726
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:19,760
Don't play those games. Why do
you play those games? Why?

727
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,429
- I hate games!
- I don't know what you mean.

728
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,682
Is that what you do with Chris? Do you
play those little games with him?

729
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:29,686
Is that what you do? Little kissy-kissy,
lovey-lovey games with him?

730
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:36,443
Chris doesn't make me suck his
cock.

731
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:42,533
He doesn't make me do anything.

732
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:45,702
Well, isn't he a fucking pussy.

733
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:50,457
I know he's really good with
computers and everything, but--

734
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:54,002
Imagine what he thinks of you.

735
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:58,590
I don't give a fuck what he
thinks about me.

736
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:01,677
Not at all.

737
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:05,722
I only know how I feel about
you...

738
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:09,726
and he could never, ever feel
the same way that I do.

739
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:18,485
Is that true?

740
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:21,864
That's the truth.

741
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:25,742
Isn't that what you like? The
truth?

742
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:27,870
You are one of those people,
aren't you...

743
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:32,791
who only wants the cold hard
truth.

744
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:35,544
Aren't you one of those people?

745
00:55:35,544 --> 00:55:41,633
Do you hate everyone, or is it
just me?

746
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:46,930
Now it's just you.

747
00:55:50,893 --> 00:55:53,937
That's kind of shocking to hear.

748
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,526
You asked for it.

749
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:05,657
I know. I know I did. It's
just--

750
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,793
Where are you going?

751
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:20,005
I'm going downstairs.

752
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:11,598
You know, I didn't feel this way
an hour ago.

753
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:15,602
I didn't come here to hate
you...

754
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:20,858
nor to grind my ego into the carpet
in order for me to get to that place.

755
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:22,401
Don't say that, Fred.

756
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:28,615
I don't regret any of the feelings I've
had for you or seeing you. I never have.

757
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:31,702
- Yeah?
- No, not one day.

758
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:38,750
And if you didn't think I was in love with you
at some point, then you just weren't listening.

759
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:43,881
- Maybe not.
- No. Absolutely so.

760
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:46,884
That there was a moment there
where...

761
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:50,179
I would've run off to China with
you on a dog sled.

762
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:53,891
I mean, I know that sounds stupid,
but you know what I mean, anything.

763
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:58,770
I would've done anything with
you or for you, all of it.

764
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:03,650
I know. Fuck.

765
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,778
I had you there for a second,
didn't I?

766
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:10,032
Yeah. You did. Completely.

767
00:58:10,032 --> 00:58:12,034
Broke it off with your son and,
you know.

768
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:16,205
All I wanted was just a little bit of
time, just to let the smoke clear.

769
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:18,790
And not even selfishly, not just
for me, but for everyone else...

770
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,918
just so they weren't all crushed
in the wreckage...

771
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:23,670
and that that didn't weigh on my
shoulders as well, you know.

772
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:27,049
It was weeks actually, it was just
weeks, and you couldn't do it.

773
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:30,052
- No, I know, but--
- No, I'm talking now, Fred. I am.

774
00:58:30,052 --> 00:58:32,763
And I listened to all your shit,
all your bile...

775
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:35,015
and the mean-spirited crap that
you tossed my way.

776
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:40,729
And now it's your turn to hear me out.
To hear what I have to say. All right?

777
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:43,815
Okay? I did have to back off a
bit.

778
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:49,071
I had to turn it down a notch 'cause I
just needed some fucking space to breathe.

779
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:53,700
To sleep in my own bed. So I didn't
feel like I had blood on my hands.

780
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,079
And you wouldn't let me do it.

781
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:00,707
Your hand kept fucking
tightening around my neck...

782
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:06,088
and I would wake up in the morning and I
would feel your fucking fingers in my neck.

783
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:09,967
And the messages...

784
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:15,973
Hundreds of messages daily.

785
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:19,852
And if I was busy or out or I
was doing something here...

786
00:59:19,852 --> 00:59:23,730
they just got so fucking mean
and so fucking dark.

787
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:28,110
Horrible, that I couldn't take
it anymore.

788
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,987
That was it.

789
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:39,746
That's what people do when they love each other.
That's what they do.

790
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:42,124
When you love somebody, you want to be
near them, you want to be with them.

791
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:44,751
That's just the way it is. But
you don't see it that way.

792
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,837
- No, I don't.
- Well, then fine.

793
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:50,299
Let's just leave it where it is
then. Dead.

794
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,136
- After all I did for you.
- Yeah, all you did for me.

795
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:57,306
- But none of it was ever real or genuine.
- Oh, come on.

796
00:59:57,306 --> 01:00:00,601
Please, all the gifts and the fucking...
Oh, my God!

797
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,146
No, not gifts. Little tests and
traps...

798
01:00:04,146 --> 01:00:07,316
to see if I'd react or if I
wouldn't react.

799
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:10,777
Little fucking prizes. I got
little fucking prizes.

800
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:13,322
If I loved you enough. Oh,
fucking Fred.

801
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:16,325
Right. That sounds just about
right. Yeah, that's right.

802
01:00:16,325 --> 01:00:21,038
So unfucking grateful. I gave
you everything.

803
01:00:21,038 --> 01:00:23,790
- Fred. Fuck, I was never ungrateful.
- Everything!

804
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,044
No, listen. Do you know what
everything is?

805
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:31,173
Everything is everything. Not
just lots of things.

806
01:00:31,173 --> 01:00:34,176
Not just some things. Not just
what you wanted to give.

807
01:00:34,176 --> 01:00:37,930
- Really?
- It's all of it.

808
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:40,015
It's all of it.

809
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:44,937
Great. This is great. I really love
your little revisionist history, okay?

810
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:47,189
But what really happened, what
really happened...

811
01:00:47,189 --> 01:00:50,400
was one day you were all kisses
and whispers...

812
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,072
and that tiny little smile of yours, and
then the next day it was like that!

813
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:59,076
You changed. It was just like I was
fucking your sister or something.

814
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:01,954
I mean, what is that? Your phone
calls started tapering off...

815
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:04,373
you pulled back emotionally.
What was that?

816
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:07,835
That's the shit that I'm talking about.
You choking me! That's what I'm saying!

817
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:10,212
No, no, no, no. You changed.

818
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:13,882
Something was gone. The way you
looked at me was different.

819
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:17,928
I had to take the pressure off. I needed to
put the brakes on. I needed to slow us down.

820
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:21,849
It didn't slow us the fuck down. What you
did was you brought us to a dead stop.

821
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:24,393
Wham! Like that! That's what
happened!

822
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:28,230
- I had to.
- You didn't have to!

823
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,233
- You made a choice!
- No, I didn't. That's bullshit, and you know it.

824
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:33,402
And this right here is why you
hate games, do you know that?

825
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:36,864
Because you can't stand to lose. That's
right, isn't it? No, that's right.

826
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,241
And it's fucking eating you up inside because
you know I didn't pull my love away!

827
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:42,870
You know you pulled your fucking love away!
Minute by fucking minute!

828
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,163
And you lost me! You lost me and
that is the fucking truth!

829
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:48,876
And you don't want to acknowledge
that inside, the fucking truth!

830
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:52,254
You don't want to fucking acknowledge
the fucking truth, Fred!

831
01:01:52,254 --> 01:01:55,132
- Fuck!
- Don't you fucking hit me.

832
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:57,134
Don't you fucking hit me!

833
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,018
That's the way these things go,
man.

834
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:09,021
Did you ever read "Lolita"?

835
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:12,191
It ends badly.

836
01:02:25,162 --> 01:02:27,039
You are funny, Fred.

837
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:36,924
You are. You're funny.

838
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:41,053
Yeah, I'm a real card.

839
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:43,931
You're a funny person, Fred.

840
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:47,184
That's one of the things that
always attracted me towards you.

841
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:50,938
- Really?
- Absolutely.

842
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:52,940
Jeez.

843
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:57,945
And I thought it was my big
thick cock the whole time.

844
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,493
There, you see?

845
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:07,079
Even that's a little bit funny.

846
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:10,332
Thanks. And obviously not the
case.

847
01:03:10,332 --> 01:03:12,960
No, no, no, that's not true. I
like it just fine, but you--

848
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,966
No. Jesus, don't finish that sentence
or I'll never take my pants off again.

849
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:22,094
I like it when you're like this.

850
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:24,221
I know.

851
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:27,516
My stomach is in knots, but I'm
trying.

852
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:32,396
I know you are. I appreciate it.

853
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:40,362
I know that you like the funny
me, the lighthearted me.

854
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:42,990
You know, the...

855
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,534
And I guess I thought that I'd come
back here and I'd knock on your door...

856
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:47,995
and you'd let me in and I'd tell
you a few jokes...

857
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:51,373
and I'd be back in your loving
embrace.

858
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:55,377
But you see how that's, I mean,
you see how that's impossible.

859
01:03:55,377 --> 01:04:00,007
You see how that's about a hundred percent
impossible, at least now, this morning.

860
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:03,135
No, I don't.

861
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:06,555
I don't think anything's
impossible.

862
01:04:06,555 --> 01:04:09,141
I don't. Nothing.

863
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:12,269
And that's the only thing that stops us from waking
up in the morning and having our Wheaties...

864
01:04:12,269 --> 01:04:14,396
and blowing our fucking brains
out.

865
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:17,566
- That little bit of hope.
- I'm not going to argue with that.

866
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:20,402
- You what?
- I'm not going to argue with that.

867
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:23,572
Well, you don't have to. It's
true.

868
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:26,033
All right, Fred. I gotta go.

869
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:31,038
You can make some eggs or have a bath
in here before you leave, if you want.

870
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:35,292
And here's the...

871
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:39,296
the spare key here that you...

872
01:04:39,296 --> 01:04:42,299
If you lock the door before you
go.

873
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:44,051
Wait, let me ask you something
before you go.

874
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:48,180
- Just... why?
- Why what?

875
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:52,601
Come here. Why? Why'd you do it
the first time?

876
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:56,188
- Do what?
- Put that note in my pocket.

877
01:04:56,188 --> 01:04:59,066
- No. No.
- "Girl for sale." Why?

878
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:02,444
No, Fred, I can't do this now.
I'm fried from this morning...

879
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:04,321
and I'm not doing this now. I
have to go now.

880
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:09,243
Yeah, okay, good. But you better call
the cops if you want me out of here.

881
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,287
I'm serious.

882
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:16,166
I will burn this fucking brothel of yours
to the ground if you walk out right now.

883
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:20,212
Do you understand that, Velvet?

884
01:05:22,214 --> 01:05:24,091
Whatever you say, Fred.

885
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:29,096
You've always had the card on this thing
of ours from the beginning anyway, so.

886
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:33,225
It's held, not had.

887
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:35,227
What?

888
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:38,272
When you're talking about cards.

889
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:40,107
I know you're gonna say the exact same
thing to the next fucking idiot...

890
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:43,235
who walks in here with his pants
down around his ankles.

891
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:47,656
When you're talking about cards,
you say...

892
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:50,242
"held" not "had".

893
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:53,120
"You held all the cards."

894
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:56,123
Okay, whatever the fuck it is, you've
always been the one holding or whatever.

895
01:05:57,124 --> 01:06:00,377
No, that is complete and utter
crap.

896
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:05,507
Who was holding all the cards the day you put
that piece of stationary into my pocket?

897
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:09,511
"Let's meet in the city for a
chat." A fucking chat.

898
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:12,264
You had the nerve to call it
that, a fucking "chat".

899
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:15,267
Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Let
me ask you a question.

900
01:06:15,267 --> 01:06:19,146
How many dads of how many undergrads
were you working on at the time?

901
01:06:20,147 --> 01:06:24,401
I wanna ask this question. I've never asked it
because I wanted to maintain some sort of dignity.

902
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:28,697
A sense of dignity or a sense of self-esteem,
but tell me, how many got notes?

903
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:32,534
- Just wanna know. Just curious.
- You don't want to know that. Not really.

904
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:34,161
- No, I do.
- No, you don't.

905
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:37,289
I mean, surprisingly, I actually
do.

906
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:40,292
'Cause I feel like we're at the
end here of this.

907
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:44,421
And, I don't know, there's like
a moment of clarity for me.

908
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:46,590
So, how many were there? Just
round it off. Come on.

909
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:51,178
Six. Five or six, maybe.

910
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:55,182
Wow... as you kids are prone to
say.

911
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:58,310
Wow. That's a lot.

912
01:07:01,313 --> 01:07:03,190
And how many takers?

913
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:10,572
Four... probably. About that.

914
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:13,575
Four? Jeez.

915
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:17,204
- What about the other two?
- Not a word.

916
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:20,791
I got a few hang-up calls, but, you
know, what are they gonna say?

917
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,585
Yeah, true, yeah.

918
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:27,214
So, is that how you, you know, pay for
tuition and books and everything like that?

919
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:30,342
- Is that how you did it?
- Pretty much.

920
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:32,553
And I got a trip to Europe one
summer, and Morocco, too.

921
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,222
And Morocco, she says. And
Morocco.

922
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:38,433
Wow. Bully for you.

923
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:43,355
It is what it is. I'm not exactly
beaming with pride over here.

924
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:46,733
Yes, but you're not exactly on your knees
begging for God's forgiveness are you?

925
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:49,611
- No, I guess not.
- No.

926
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:52,698
You're just comfortably right in
the middle, aren't you?

927
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:56,368
I'm not a murderer, Fred, if
that's what you're implying.

928
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:58,495
It was just something that I
did.

929
01:07:58,495 --> 01:08:03,750
Yeah, no, that's fine. I mean, you
know, it was a game, right? A game.

930
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:06,795
And we're all adults and, you
know, just, you know?

931
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:10,507
You just had all these daddies trying
to get into your tight little pants.

932
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:12,718
It's a good racket. I gotta hand
it to you.

933
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:16,638
No, it wasn't a racket, Fred. It
was a job, an after school job.

934
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:20,809
Yeah? It was a job and you just
accidentally fell for me?

935
01:08:20,809 --> 01:08:23,520
Out of all those other guys?

936
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,523
- Kind of, yeah.
- I don't believe that. Sorry.

937
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:29,276
- That's romance novel bullshit.
- It doesn't matter, it's true.

938
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:34,823
And what about them? What about
the other guys?

939
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:38,827
Not that I care about second
place, but what happened to them?

940
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:45,542
Some of them fell for me like you
did, whether I felt that way or not.

941
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:48,420
We made a mess of things. That's how
it goes, you know that. It's a risk.

942
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:52,466
And then a couple of them were great.
We'd go to a hotel or a spot uptown...

943
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:55,761
and I'd take the train up or whatever, and
then I'd be back in class by nightfall...

944
01:08:56,303 --> 01:08:59,431
$500 richer than I was that
morning.

945
01:08:59,431 --> 01:09:02,309
It doesn't suck to only work two
or three hours a week.

946
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:06,438
You know, when you're in school.

947
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:08,690
See, I would use a different
choice of words.

948
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:13,695
And "suck", when you're describing
the situation, could be confusing.

949
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:16,323
Make fun of me if you want, but
I see it as work.

950
01:09:17,324 --> 01:09:18,825
That's how I see it.

951
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:22,704
I think that you need to see it
a little differently next time.

952
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:23,872
- Really?
- Yeah.

953
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:28,460
So I can what, know that I should
be working in an Applebees?

954
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:32,464
Or stripping? Or strutting my
stuff at Hooters?

955
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:34,716
Is that what you think?

956
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:37,719
You use what you have, Fred, and
that's what I did.

957
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:40,138
Chris is good with computers,
and so he gets paid for that...

958
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:43,475
and you're an attorney and
that's your gift, you know...

959
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:47,479
and I have tits, and I'm not sorry
that I let men use me once in a while.

960
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:49,606
You can try and make me feel
guilty...

961
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:53,652
and tell me what I did was a bad thing,
but it wasn't. It wasn't for me.

962
01:09:53,652 --> 01:09:56,488
And you may not like it or
understand it...

963
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:58,824
but I did what I had to do at
the time.

964
01:09:58,824 --> 01:10:01,910
I still do from time to time.

965
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:08,375
- Anyway, I have to go, Fred.
- No, wait, wait!

966
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,753
No! What do you want! You're
just mean all the time!

967
01:10:11,753 --> 01:10:16,508
I'm just asking what happens
now! It's a serious question!

968
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:19,386
- I've already said!
- That's right, you could pencil me in on Sunday.

969
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,389
- Gosh, how could I forget?
- You don't have to.

970
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,517
No, it's fine! Something to look
forward to.

971
01:10:25,517 --> 01:10:27,644
- You're being an ass now, aren't you?
- Sorta, yeah.

972
01:10:27,644 --> 01:10:31,773
- Fuck it. Let's forget it then.
- And I thought it was all going so well.

973
01:10:31,773 --> 01:10:35,652
- Fred, please...
- No, you're right. Okay, fuck!

974
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:38,530
This is crazy. We're going around in circles.
I'm exhausted.

975
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:41,533
Here's what we do. You're gonna
go for your lunch thing, okay?

976
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:44,536
- And then you're gonna call me.
- I will.

977
01:10:44,536 --> 01:10:46,955
- Fine. If you give me a kiss first.
- What?

978
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:49,416
You heard me. Come on, it's just
a kiss.

979
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:52,961
- I'm not sure that's true.
- Come on, just a little peck.

980
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:56,965
- I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
- Pretty please?

981
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:01,678
- Okay, you can give me a kiss on the cheek.
- Fuck the cheek.

982
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:04,765
I want the whole-- All right, look.
All right, we'll prorate it.

983
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:07,976
Okay, so $500. That's probably
what, like...

984
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:10,812
A kiss would be $75 all in?

985
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,898
- Don't say things like that.
- All right, I'm sorry.

986
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,984
But I'm serious. Just a
little...

987
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:18,820
I'll give you one for free if you
let me go straight afterwards.

988
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:22,449
Really? That's a deal. Okay,
great. Let's do it.

989
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:26,703
No, you come here and kiss me.
I'm the girl.

990
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:28,455
- Really?
- Yeah.

991
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,879
You ready? Okay.

992
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:02,030
You always could kiss.

993
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:05,492
- You, too.
- I forgot.

994
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:07,536
Me, too.

995
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:15,878
- No, I have to go.
- Wait, come here, come here.

996
01:12:15,878 --> 01:12:18,797
Just one more. Come here. Come
here.

997
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:32,519
What? Please don't, don't.

998
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:35,647
Let me just stay here for a
second. Don't ruin it.

999
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:37,065
Don't.

1000
01:12:41,069 --> 01:12:46,074
I'm really gonna be late. I'm gonna be late.
I'll see you Sunday anyway.

1001
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:51,538
- I hope so.
- Yeah, me, too.

1002
01:12:51,538 --> 01:12:54,541
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1003
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:58,545
You know, if it happens
naturally or whatever.

1004
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:01,924
What do you mean, "naturally"?
What does that mean?

1005
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:04,801
- You know.
- Come here.

1006
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:09,681
What does it mean exactly, "naturally"?
You mean with or without a condom?

1007
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:13,685
No, I'm kidding. Really. Just tell
me what it means just so I know.

1008
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:16,104
Start again as friends or
whatever.

1009
01:13:16,104 --> 01:13:21,693
- Us? Friends?
- If you don't get too pushy about things.

1010
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:25,822
- Okay.
- If you take it easy.

1011
01:13:25,822 --> 01:13:28,700
I can do that.

1012
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:34,706
And if we start at regular hours
at first. Daytime hours.

1013
01:13:34,706 --> 01:13:37,960
- You mean like lunch?
- Yeah.

1014
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,713
But not as in code, like real
food.

1015
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:45,133
Maybe then.

1016
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:54,977
- Anything else?
- No, just like, things like that.

1017
01:13:55,978 --> 01:13:59,147
Are you sure there's nothing
else, no other rules...

1018
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:04,611
or guidelines that I have to follow
in order to be in your presence?

1019
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:06,738
- Fred!
- What?

1020
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:10,868
I'm only kidding, really. When did
you stop being able to take a joke?

1021
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:12,995
Right around the time they stop
being funny.

1022
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:17,624
Gosh, you're getting quicker,
aren't you?

1023
01:14:17,624 --> 01:14:20,127
- I learned from the best.
- I hope that means me.

1024
01:14:20,127 --> 01:14:22,880
- I was referring to Chris, actually.
- You know what...

1025
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,883
if you love Chris so much, go have fucking
lunch with him. I'll be right here.

1026
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:29,636
- I don't need your permission, Fred.
- You know what, just go.

1027
01:14:30,637 --> 01:14:34,016
I can go? Oh, thank you. Thank
you so much.

1028
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:38,896
- You know what? You're pushing it. Get out.
- You know what?

1029
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:42,191
I actually don't feel
comfortable leaving you here.

1030
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:45,027
This has been nice, or I've
tried to make it nice...

1031
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:48,906
but now I think you should go. I
think it's time that you leave.

1032
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:51,200
- More threats.
- It's not a threat.

1033
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:56,663
It's a simple fucking fact that
you have to leave. Now.

1034
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:01,084
All you had to do is ask nicely.

1035
01:15:06,048 --> 01:15:09,051
Do you want to help me with
these bags, please?

1036
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:13,805
- Gimme a kiss. Just one kiss.
- No! No! No! No, Fred!

1037
01:15:13,805 --> 01:15:16,225
Stop jerking me and fucking--!
What's wrong with you!

1038
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:18,810
- Come here! Just come here!
- Fred! Fuck!

1039
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:21,688
Shut up! Just get over here!

1040
01:15:26,693 --> 01:15:28,695
You fucking--!

1041
01:15:28,695 --> 01:15:30,948
Come here! Come here!

1042
01:15:38,956 --> 01:15:41,250
Shut up! Shut up!

1043
01:15:53,262 --> 01:15:55,055
Shut up!

1044
01:17:17,054 --> 01:17:19,348
Say hi to Chris for me.

1045
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:52,840
Hey, you all right?

1046
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:57,094
- Yeah.
- You sure?

1047
01:18:00,097 --> 01:18:04,101
My gosh, wow. That was really--
Did I hurt you?

1048
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:07,104
- No. I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

1049
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:10,107
- Did I hurt your head?
- I think you pulled a few hairs out.

1050
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:13,861
- I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.
- Did I hurt your hand? I feel like...

1051
01:18:13,861 --> 01:18:16,864
You bit it, but you didn't break
the skin or anything.

1052
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:19,867
Listen. About the no condoms
thing...

1053
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:23,120
you can't tell anybody that,
okay? Nobody can know that.

1054
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,998
Who am I gonna tell? I sit at a
computer all day, you know?

1055
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:30,878
You have a vivid imagination for
a computer guy.

1056
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:34,006
Yeah, I know. Anyway. So, okay.

1057
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,259
- I really love that accent that you do.
- You do?

1058
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:41,430
- Yeah. I love when you're, you know.
- It's my grandma's accent.

1059
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:45,142
Really? Wow, it's really good.

1060
01:18:45,142 --> 01:18:50,272
Here, okay. Here you go. So
that's that, the usual.

1061
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:53,901
And then, here's extra 'cause...

1062
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:55,277
we went over.

1063
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:59,281
- And then, and then just a little...
- That's cool.

1064
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:04,286
Here, take a little extra 'cause I broke that
thing over there. I'm really sorry about that.

1065
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:09,291
No, that's fine. That's just something from Crate & Barrel.
The agency will take care of that.

1066
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:12,044
Okay, all right, good. Okay,
great. I better get going.

1067
01:19:12,044 --> 01:19:14,171
- Gotta go?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

1068
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:16,173
- Give me a hand.
- I know you got stuff to do.

1069
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:19,927
- Okay, you all right?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

1070
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:26,475
I love how you always get to be like other
professions and I'm always a hooker.

1071
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:30,479
Yeah, I know. Well, next time you
can be whatever you want to be.

1072
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:34,066
- I wanna be a nurse.
- Great. I'll be the patient.

1073
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:42,950
I gotta get all this
stuff back to Goodwill.

1074
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:46,328
No, I'm dropping it off at
Goodwill, I am.

1075
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:48,080
I'm not kidding, I am.

1076
01:19:49,081 --> 01:19:53,210
- All right, next time.
- Yeah, right, thanks.

1077
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:58,215
No, next week I can't come. I
have a family thing...

1078
01:19:58,215 --> 01:20:03,011
- but I'll call you.
- Promise?

1079
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:05,347
Yeah. Of course I promise.

1080
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:08,517
All right, okay.

1081
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:10,519
Okay, bye.

1082
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:20,529
Good-bye, Velvet.

1083
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:26,368
- Yeah, bye, Fred.
- I know...

1084
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:30,998
You're sure you're okay? All
right. See you later.

1085
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:33,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

1086
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
