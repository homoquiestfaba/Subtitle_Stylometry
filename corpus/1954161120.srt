1
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,760
There is a legend about a bird...

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,387
which sings just once in its life...

3
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,640
more sweetly than
any other creature...

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,725
on the face of the earth.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,810
From the moment it leaves the nest...

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,104
it searches for a thorn tree...

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,815
and doesn't rest
until it's found one.

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,652
Then, singing among
the savage branches...

9
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,197
it impales itself upon the
longest, sharpest spine.

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,326
And dying, it rises
above its own agony...

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,579
to out-carol the lark
and the nightingale...

12
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,875
and the whole world
stills to listen...

13
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,504
and God in his heaven smiles.

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,967
For the best is bought only
at the cost of great pain...

15
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,761
or so says the legend.

16
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,741
Inside, everybody!

17
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,750
You, priest!

18
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,342
-Don't you know about the curfew?
-A man is dying.

19
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,010
And what's this?

20
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,474
His dinner?

21
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,810
His family is very poor,
his children are starving.

22
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,939
Meat! Chicken!

23
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,108
-We haven't seen this in months.
-All we get is macaroni.

24
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,735
For God's sake, have mercy on them!

25
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,614
Out whoring and drinking, more like.
All rotten priests are the same.

26
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,952
-On your way, priest.
-And don't break curfew again.

27
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,201
It's not much, but it
will help. Bring them out.

28
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,261
-Dear God. How many more?
-The Allies have landed in Sicily.

29
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,097
Mussolini can't last
now. It won't be long.

30
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,099
It will be long enough.

31
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,149
You are all welcome here.

32
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,653
And you can take this off.
You don't need it anymore.

33
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,489
-It is the law.
-It's a Fascist law.

34
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,951
-This is the house of God.
-lf there is a God at all.

35
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,620
He has forsaken us.

36
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,711
Perhaps it is we who
have forgotten him.

37
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,426
This man seems to
doubt the power of God.

38
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,264
So put your faith in me.

39
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,560
You're under my protection now,
and no harm will come to you.

40
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,979
And you don't need this.

41
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,399
Follow me.

42
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:29,204
No. There are too many already.

43
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,415
lf the Fascists find
out, what happens to me?

44
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,835
This is my church. I am responsible.

45
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,213
We are all responsible, Father.

46
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,344
I absolve you of any blame.
lf the authorities find out...

47
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,847
I値l say it was all my
doing. Go back to your dinner.

48
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,266
It's best you don't know.

49
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,021
Come along.

50
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,413
Come along.

51
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,138
Follow me this way. Come along.

52
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,745
It isn't much, I know, but you'll be
safe here for as long as you need to be.

53
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,040
Thank you from the bottom
of my heart. You are a saint.

54
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,876
No. Far from it. Please.

55
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,590
I値l try to find a
doctor for you tomorrow.

56
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,094
Meanwhile, make yourselves
as comfortable as possible.

57
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,598
Father, my grandson, Samuel...

58
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,227
protect him.

59
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,230
And find a safe haven for him...

60
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,941
if such a place still exists.

61
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,111
You can both live in that place.

62
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,531
I don't want to live.

63
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,242
I saw what the Nazis did...

64
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,245
to his parents.

65
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,622
To my wife.

66
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,835
When I know that the boy is safe...

67
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,922
I want to be with her.

68
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,843
I値l do what I can for him.

69
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:54,724
You swear on your sacred,
solemn love of God?

70
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,275
I swear on my sacred oath.

71
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,615
Now rest.

72
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,466
There are too many. We have
no food for them tomorrow.

73
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,051
I値l find some.

74
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,346
-And we need some medicine.
-I値l find some.

75
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,892
And you must rest, My Lord.
You put us all to shame.

76
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,061
No. We must do what we can.

77
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,136
I値l do the rest.

78
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,385
I know these are
difficult times, Ralph...

79
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,472
but when the Holy Father says mass...

80
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,267
his servant should not be late.

81
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,395
All across Europe, thousands
of displaced people...

82
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,523
are seeking some sanctuary
from this ravaging war...

83
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,360
and Holy Mother Church
is doing nothing.

84
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,862
What has that to do with being late?

85
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:59,575
We know that punctuality and
obedience are not your virtues...

86
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,953
but at least you could
show some respect.

87
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,250
And, you know, we do whatever we can.

88
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,920
No, Your Eminence, we do
as little as possible...

89
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,964
because we don't want to offend
one Great Power or the other...

90
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,758
until we know which side will win.

91
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,177
Meanwhile, the homeless
have nowhere to go...

92
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,347
no future to look forward to,
and no one to take care of them.

93
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,059
-So I do what I can.
-Are you going to be a politician now?

94
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,190
Listen to me, Ralph. Many
people admire your work.

95
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,985
It has even been discussed
with the Holy Father himself...

96
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,823
and I think your future as
a cardinal seems assured.

97
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,576
It's all I have hoped for
you, ever since I致e met you.

98
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,162
But...

99
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,834
you cannot have one
breath of scandal...

100
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,294
not one hint of it...

101
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,297
-to taint your dazzling future.
-What scandal?

102
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,424
You know perfectly well
what I知 talking about.

103
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:01,220
Your management of the great
fortune of Mary Carson...

104
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:06,016
which you brought into the Church,
and which you are in charge of.

105
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,687
-I致e used this much for the refugees.
-You cannot use any of it.

106
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,939
The money belongs to the Church...

107
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,650
and you cannot use the
tiniest fraction of it...

108
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,528
for purposes the Church
does not deem appropriate.

109
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,657
-Saving human lives is not appropriate?
-Of course it is appropriate...

110
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,325
and you know that.

111
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,036
But it is not up to you to decide.

112
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,330
-It is not your decision.
-What am I to do?

113
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,834
My priests and I
scrounge, beg, and steal...

114
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,627
to feed the refugees for one night...

115
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,422
never knowing whether
they will starve the next.

116
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,092
Then we have to
persuade the Church...

117
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,931
-to loosen her purse strings.
-And when the war is over?

118
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,644
-Then they can go home.
-Most of them have no homes now.

119
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,231
-There are other countries-- -Who
don't want them, won't take them.

120
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,192
Then we have to use our political...

121
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,695
diplomatic power...

122
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,157
and convince them to
change their policies...

123
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,951
and to help find
countries of refuge...

124
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,996
for these unfortunate souls.

125
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,123
I値l do...

126
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,042
what I can...

127
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,378
if you give me your sacred word...

128
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,755
now...

129
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,008
that you will not
use one penny more...

130
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,010
of the Carson money.

131
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,139
-I can't make that vow.
-You must.

132
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,312
Not only for me, but for yourself.

133
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,982
You have not only friends here.

134
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:41,028
There are powerful forces
lining up against you.

135
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,655
Let them do their worst...

136
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,742
and then, at last,
I値l know the truth.

137
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,078
Does God want me for my ability...

138
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,039
or does the Church want
me for Mary Carson's money?

139
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,501
To tell you the truth, the
Church definitely wants you for...

140
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,632
your ability to do the Church's work.

141
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,218
And God...

142
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,596
God...

143
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,725
All he wants...

144
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,019
is your faith.

145
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,527
I値l be careful, Vittorio.
There'll be no scandal.

146
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,615
I値l take it for a promise.

147
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,867
Come.

148
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,582
Turn her off, mate.

149
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,755
G'day, Mrs. O'Neill.

150
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,924
Bill, Tony. Any luck?

151
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:29,761
It's a waste of time. It's
dry. There's no water here.

152
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,056
But this whole area is an artesian
basin. There must be water.

153
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,560
-I知 at 3,000 feet.
-The sheep cannot last much longer.

154
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,771
This drought's killing
us all, Mrs. O'Neill...

155
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,233
and the thing is, Tony's joined up.

156
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,527
He's off to New Guinea.

157
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,864
His mom don't want him to
go, and that's a fact, but...

158
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,783
-I got to do my bit, Mrs. O'Neill.
-Yes.

159
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:54,369
I know you're desperate for water...

160
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,414
but we want to go to Sydney
with him to see him off.

161
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:59,666
Who knows when he'll be home again.

162
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,045
-All right, Bill. Thanks anyway.
-I知 sorry.

163
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,298
I値l come back on Monday,
and take this lot down.

164
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,924
Good luck in New Guinea, Tony.

165
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,844
I値l say g'day to your
brothers if I see them.

166
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,143
She needs a man around the place.

167
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,270
Women aren't cut out
for this sort of work.

168
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,856
Old Mary Carson ran
Drogheda good enough.

169
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:25,233
Mary Carson was different.

170
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,153
Miss Meggie's a lady.

171
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,003
...but when he retired in 1911...

172
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,339
he thought his military
career was over.

173
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,342
However, when the German
invaders defeated...

174
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,196
Now, Dane, we all know...

175
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,283
that the present German Nazi
leader is Adolf Hitler...

176
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,744
but can you tell me the name
of the allied Italian dictator?

177
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,457
-You there, Dane?
-Mommy! Mommy!

178
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,460
Dane, come back here this instant.
You haven't finished school.

179
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,920
Justine?

180
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:38,116
-...so I thought we'd lost you both.
-No, because it's boring.

181
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,659
-Justine.
-She can't hear.

182
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,745
Have you been studying
as well as your brother?

183
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:45,415
-Yes, Mrs. H.
-It's Mrs. Henderson, Justine...

184
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:48,418
not Mrs. H. Mind your
manners, thank you.

185
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,922
Then she asked me about Rome.

186
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,382
That's where your friend
the Archbishop is, isn't he?

187
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,760
-That's right.
-Does he know the Pope?

188
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,472
I think he's met him a
couple of times, yeah.

189
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,766
Any luck?

190
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,519
They're not going to be drilling
anymore, Mom. Tony's joined up.

191
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:11,900
-It's got to rain.
-It will, dear, in God's good time.

192
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:15,236
After a week of it, we'll
be wishing it'd stop.

193
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,446
Come on, you.

194
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:19,991
That's it for today, then, children.
Talk to you all again on Monday.

195
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,576
Over and out.

196
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,829
Why does she call me
''children''? I知 not a child.

197
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,874
You are for just a little
while longer yet, Justine.

198
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,378
Tell you what, why don't you go
and make us a nice cup of tea?

199
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,463
Why is it always me?
Why can't Mrs. Smith?

200
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:36,800
Because she's busy cooking
your dinner. Now, go on.

201
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:41,096
I have half a mind to go out
and drill that damn well myself.

202
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:43,098
No, Meggie, that's men's work.

203
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,059
So is running this place. I致e
been doing quite well at that.

204
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:48,853
-Isn't right. Your brothers should
be here. -They're not.

205
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,022
Bob and Jack are fighting
a war in New Guinea...

206
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,024
so I知 afraid running
Drogheda's up to me...

207
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,234
whether you like it or not.

208
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:56,653
Why bother? We don't
even own this place.

209
00:19:56,736 --> 00:20:00,323
-It belongs to the Church.
-That's why we have to take care of it.

210
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:03,368
My daddy would find
water if he was here.

211
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,248
The only liquid your father could find
would be the beer at the nearest pub.

212
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,419
I知 sorry, Justine.
I didn't mean that.

213
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,338
Yes, you did. You always do.

214
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,800
lf you hated him so much,
why did you marry him?

215
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,636
-Justine.
-I値l take care of her, Mom.

216
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:29,769
You must guard your tongue, Meggie.

217
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:33,273
That girl shouldn't grow up believing
her father is the devil incarnate.

218
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:35,275
-Why not? It's true.
-Then she has a point.

219
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:36,943
lf it's true, why did you marry him?

220
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:39,112
-Mom, it's old ground.
-Not to her.

221
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,530
And what's Dane to think?

222
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,825
-I mean, Luke isn't even his real father.
-He'll hear you!

223
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,828
No, he doesn't.

224
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:51,249
lf anyone knew, it would destroy
Father Ralph's position in the Church.

225
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,044
Mom, Luke isn't here.

226
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,840
Ralph isn't here. I知
Dane's mother and father...

227
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,927
-and that is all he need ever know.
-And you don't think blood will out?

228
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,431
That boy already has his heart
set on becoming a priest...

229
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:09,976
-just like his father.
-He's a child, he'll grow out of it.

230
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:14,022
I hope so. Otherwise, you'll
lose him to God as well.

231
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,114
Please...

232
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:27,994
just let it rain.

233
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:33,374
Dear God, please bring some
rain to stop the drought.

234
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,544
And God bless Justine,
and Grandma Fee...

235
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,963
and Uncle Jack, and Mommy...

236
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,842
and a very special blessing
for my daddy, wherever he is.

237
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,219
Amen.

238
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:47,805
Right, into bed.

239
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:00,610
Do you miss your father, Dane?

240
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:04,739
Well, I don't know him,
so I can't really miss him.

241
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:07,784
-I miss not having a daddy, though.
-Yeah, I know.

242
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:12,455
-Justine thinks you hate him.
-Hate?

243
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:16,167
That's a very strong
word, my darling.

244
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:20,421
-I don't hate your daddy.
-Do you think he'll ever come back here?

245
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:22,674
Why? Aren't I enough for you?

246
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:25,426
Yes. You're the best
mommy in all the world.

247
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:28,638
Yeah, you say that now,
but you know, one day...

248
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,766
you're going to meet
a beautiful girl...

249
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:34,686
you're going to fall in love...

250
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:37,355
get married, and
have lots of babies...

251
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:39,816
and then she'll be the
best mommy in all the world.

252
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:43,277
No, I知 going to be a priest.
Priests don't get married.

253
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:48,199
You are much too young to be
thinking about things like that.

254
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:50,034
Why? Would you mind?

255
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,789
No, not if it's what
you really wanted.

256
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,627
But it's a big decision to make.
Wait until you're much, much older.

257
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:02,588
-All right. Night, Mom.
-Good night, my darling.

258
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,756
Sleep tight.

259
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,135
-Don't let the bedbugs bite.
-Don't let the bedbugs bite.

260
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:08,469
Good night.

261
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,519
What on earth are you doing?

262
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:20,231
Just practicing for
when I知 an actress.

263
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:24,569
-It makes you look awfully grown up.
-I am grown up.

264
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,072
Not to me. You're
still my little girl.

265
00:23:32,618 --> 00:23:34,454
I do try, Justine.

266
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:39,208
I know you miss your
father, but he's not here.

267
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,753
You always call him ''your father.''
You never say ''my husband.''

268
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:46,007
That's because I don't think of
myself as married to Luke anymore.

269
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,552
You're not divorced. You're
Catholic, you can't be divorced.

270
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:53,598
-And you must've loved him to marry him.
-Oh, for pity's sake, Justine.

271
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:01,898
Yes, I thought I loved him once.

272
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,692
It took me a while to
realize I was wrong...

273
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:07,236
but he gave me you,
so it wasn't all bad.

274
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:10,114
You're right about one
thing: I do wish he was here.

275
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,493
That's not going to happen. I知
sorry, but that's the way it is.

276
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:16,662
-At least he'd love me.
-And do you think I don't?

277
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,958
You know, your father wasn't
the man you think he was.

278
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:24,921
Wash that makeup off
before you go to bed.

279
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,813
...on rural properties in Australia,
as the two-year drought continues.

280
00:24:43,022 --> 00:24:47,109
Overseas, Australian troops have
gained more ground in New Guinea...

281
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:50,529
but the Japanese continue
to inflict heavy casualties.

282
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,241
And, following the
invasion of Sicily...

283
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:56,118
the Allies have announced that
none of the Italian cities...

284
00:24:56,202 --> 00:24:58,955
including Rome, will be
excluded from bombing raids...

285
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,083
because of historical
importance. Meanwhile...

286
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,293
They won't bomb the Vatican.

287
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,003
He'll be safe.

288
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,047
...is besieged. It is
being softened up...

289
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,967
with fierce bombardment
from sea and air...

290
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,597
Sweet Mary, mother of Jesus...

291
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,893
have mercy.

292
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:26,148
Take this burden from me.

293
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,155
I think of her...

294
00:25:35,574 --> 00:25:37,284
every minute of my life.

295
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:40,830
Let me forget her.

296
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,332
Let me serve you in peace.

297
00:26:03,477 --> 00:26:05,354
I have repented my sin.

298
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,233
I will never see her again.

299
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:20,119
Only please, I beg of you...

300
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:24,665
take this burden from me.

301
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:44,977
''Dead.''

302
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:48,606
''Dead, and never
called me mother! ''

303
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,569
What are you laughing at?

304
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:57,615
-You. You look funny.
-This is a melodrama.

305
00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:00,493
It isn't supposed to be
serious. I was very good.

306
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,662
Why do you want to
be an actress, Justie?

307
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,124
I love being other people.
I don't like being me.

308
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:11,045
I hate it out here
in the Never Never.

309
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:14,798
-No one to talk to, nothing to do.
-You can talk to me.

310
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,010
Yes, but you go on
about Jesus all the time.

311
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:19,929
It gets a bit boring.

312
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:23,766
I want to be like
her, Aunt Mary Carson.

313
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,604
-Rich and interesting.
-She loved Jesus.

314
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,024
She must have. She left all
of her money to the Church.

315
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:33,275
She didn't really.

316
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,904
She left all her money to that priest
Mommy's so fond of, Father Ralph.

317
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:38,697
He's an archbishop.

318
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:41,450
I bet there was something
funny going on there.

319
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:45,037
-I bet really she was in love with him.
-You can't love a priest.

320
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,706
Yes, you can. You can't marry one...

321
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,752
but there's nothing to stop
you being in love with him.

322
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:55,464
It's very romantic, being in
love with a man you can't have.

323
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:58,425
Do you think Mommy ever loved Daddy?

324
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:01,470
Probably, when they got married.

325
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,389
Why does she hate him so much now?

326
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:05,599
-He left her.
-No, he didn't.

327
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,685
He was wonderful to her.

328
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,355
She left him. Mrs. Smith
told me. I壇 never do that.

329
00:28:11,814 --> 00:28:14,984
I壇 never walk out on a
man if I really loved him.

330
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,904
I wish Daddy would come here.

331
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:23,117
I know he'd take me away from
here, and we'd go to Sydney...

332
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:27,830
and I壇 become a great actress and
look after him for always and always.

333
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,877
Grandma's home.

334
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:38,299
We'd better get cleaned up.
You know how she goes on.

335
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:56,900
Mom.

336
00:28:57,484 --> 00:28:59,862
Mom, Mrs. Smith wants to know...

337
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:03,991
Mom, are you all right?

338
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:08,537
This is where you met Luke,
isn't it? Where you courted?

339
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,290
You should never have left
him. He's your husband.

340
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:13,625
Go back to him, I beg
you, and have babies.

341
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:17,379
-Have lots more babies.
-Mom, what's the matter?

342
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:24,178
Dear Mom...

343
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:27,389
this letter will probably come
as a bit of a shock to you.

344
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:31,018
It's hard to believe it was three
years ago we all said goodbye.

345
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:34,897
I致e seen a lot of action since
then, Mom. North Africa, Europe.

346
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:40,235
As you know, Mom, we've been shipped
to New Guinea to stop the Japs.

347
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,449
We've been fighting pretty hard on the
Kokoda Trail these past eight months.

348
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:47,826
The jungle's purgatory, Mom.

349
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:51,205
Anyway, some of the young
blokes were caught in an ambush.

350
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:55,209
They were wounded pretty
badly, held down by sniper fire.

351
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,921
Young lads, they were. Been
here since the beginning.

352
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:02,216
We couldn't just leave them
out there to die, Mom...

353
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:05,594
so me and a couple of
boys, we went to get them.

354
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:08,305
That's what we're here
for, isn't it, Mom?

355
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:10,933
Well, we got to the blokes safely...

356
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:13,227
and started leading
them out of there...

357
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,813
when the Japanese just
came out of nowhere.

358
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:17,731
Like ghosts, they were.

359
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:21,985
They had us pinned down pretty good
and, at first, we stood our ground...

360
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:24,363
but we had to get out of there.

361
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:26,281
We were trapped.

362
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:28,534
So I just let loose.

363
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:32,162
I don't know what happened then.
I think I got a couple of them.

364
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:35,165
The thing is, one of them got me.

365
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,167
I知 all right now.

366
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:39,836
Some specialists have looked at me.

367
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,797
Nothing serious, except...

368
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,549
''Nothing serious,'' he says.

369
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:46,510
Except he'll never be able
to have children, ever.

370
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:50,514
lf that isn't serious,
I don't know what is.

371
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:55,811
At least he'll be out of
the war. He'll be home.

372
00:30:57,688 --> 00:30:59,898
We need a man about the place.

373
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:42,524
Yes!

374
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:14,806
Luke?

375
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:18,935
What the hell are you doing here?

376
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:36,495
How are you feeling?

377
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:39,790
You want a cup of tea?
I reckon you need one.

378
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:44,711
Some folk might say it
was lucky I was passing by.

379
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:49,674
But then, gratitude never really was
one of your strong points, was it, Megan?

380
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:53,345
I put four sugars in there. You
probably had a bit of a shock.

381
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:54,930
And you're it.

382
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:58,558
There's some spares for the drill.
I値l see if I can get it going again.

383
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:00,143
There's no point, there's no water.

384
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:02,938
-Who says?
-Bill Masters. It's his drill.

385
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:06,399
Bill Masters couldn't direct
traffic down a one-way street.

386
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:09,528
No, it's there, but two
years without rain...

387
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:12,364
it'll be deep, and we surely need it.

388
00:33:12,697 --> 00:33:15,116
-''We''?
-Figure of speech.

389
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:18,954
Every station from here to
the black stump needs water.

390
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:22,374
-So how are you feeling?
-I致e got a lousy headache.

391
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:27,045
That's not surprising.
That's a nasty gash.

392
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:30,340
But I don't think
there's any harm done.

393
00:33:30,423 --> 00:33:33,593
You never answered my question.
What are you doing here?

394
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:37,889
I had a bit of time on my hands. I
thought I壇 come down and see my wife.

395
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,142
I haven't been your wife
for a long time, Luke.

396
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:45,230
And I wanted to see my boy.

397
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:51,861
I heard around the traps I致e
got a son. Why didn't you tell me?

398
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:55,991
Because I didn't think you'd care.
You never took much notice of Justine.

399
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:59,703
Boys are different.
I致e always wanted a son.

400
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:01,746
Megan...

401
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:06,459
I値l do whatever you say,
but I want to see my son.

402
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:30,692
-You want some more tea, Grandma?
-No, thank you, dear.

403
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:33,069
I think I値l have
a nap before dinner.

404
00:34:33,778 --> 00:34:35,655
Here's your mommy home.

405
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:43,705
-Who's that man?
-Go and get Justine, dear.

406
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:47,375
Tell her it's her father.

407
00:34:58,803 --> 00:34:59,846
Daddy?

408
00:35:03,975 --> 00:35:05,268
G'day, Mrs. C.

409
00:35:05,352 --> 00:35:06,561
Daddy!

410
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:14,986
Daddy!

411
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:21,159
That's what I call a real homecoming.

412
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:32,837
-This is Dane.
-G'day, Dane.

413
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:36,216
G'day, Dad.

414
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:47,435
Is it really you? It is!

415
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:52,357
What a sight for sore eyes you are.

416
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:55,401
It's me, Mrs. Smith. It's really me.

417
00:35:55,777 --> 00:35:57,237
Lost a bit of weight, I see.

418
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,031
Mr. Luke, what a card you
are. You haven't changed.

419
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:03,701
A bit older and wiser, perhaps.
I like to think so, anyway.

420
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,831
How about you get back in that
kitchen? I need a bit of feeding up.

421
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:13,044
-Welcome home, Luke.
-It's you that hasn't changed.

422
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:16,714
-You're looking younger than ever.
-Liar.

423
00:36:24,097 --> 00:36:26,724
This is a bit of
all-right, isn't it?

424
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,571
-I壇 forgotten how charming he can be.
-Yes, when he wants something.

425
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:44,450
Mom, he's too old for cane cutting,
and he's looking for a meal ticket...

426
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:47,579
-and it's not going to be me.
-You're too hard on him, dear.

427
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:49,998
A little Christian charity
might not go astray.

428
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:53,251
I am not going back to
Luke, Mom. He never loved me.

429
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:56,087
He spent more time with his
mates than he ever did with me.

430
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,172
What about the
children? They need him.

431
00:36:58,256 --> 00:37:00,633
So do you, only you're
too stubborn to admit it.

432
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:03,177
-I don't need anyone.
-We all need someone.

433
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:05,930
I miss your father.

434
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:08,975
You can't tell me you haven't
been lonely for the last 10 years.

435
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:10,226
I know what loneliness is.

436
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,854
Yes, I致e been lonely,
Mom, but not for Luke.

437
00:37:12,937 --> 00:37:14,480
No, obviously.

438
00:37:14,647 --> 00:37:15,815
You were unfaithful to him.

439
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:18,026
You've been pining for
10 years for a priest...

440
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:20,111
-a man you can never have.
-I have his son.

441
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:23,323
-His son needs a father.
-Luke is not his father.

442
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:27,160
-And I don't trust him.
-Then change him, dear.

443
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:29,370
You're quite a witch, after all.

444
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:32,999
It was for you that Father Ralph
broke his most sacred, solemn vow.

445
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:48,514
All tucked in?

446
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:53,603
Good as gold. At least the
kids were pleased to see me.

447
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:58,483
-Do you mind, Mrs. C?
-I don't mind you smoking.

448
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:00,943
But I do mind you calling me Mrs. C.

449
00:38:01,486 --> 00:38:04,072
-Fine. Fee.
-That's better.

450
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:08,076
It does my heart good
to see you sitting there.

451
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,662
-We need a man about the place.
-You surely do.

452
00:38:11,913 --> 00:38:14,290
Drogheda's not exactly
looking its best.

453
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:15,792
It hasn't been easy, you know.

454
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,169
Most of the able-bodied
men are fighting a war.

455
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,921
I think you've done great...

456
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:22,465
considering you've had
everything stacked against you.

457
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:26,135
-But if you need help, I知 here now.
-For how long?

458
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,473
As long as I知 needed, or wanted.

459
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:33,476
That raises the question
of where you'll sleep.

460
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:35,520
-Mom.
-It's all right, Megan.

461
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:38,481
I wasn't expecting to turn up here
like the proverbial bad penny...

462
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:41,818
-and jump straight into the cot with you.
-I知 glad to hear it.

463
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:44,445
I値l bunk down at the
old shearer's quarters.

464
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:45,947
It's not very comfortable.

465
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,991
It'll be a palace compared to
some of the places I致e slept in.

466
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:52,161
Besides, all those feather beds
up there, they make a man soft.

467
00:38:53,454 --> 00:38:55,581
That's just what Jack used to say.

468
00:38:58,543 --> 00:39:00,002
What do you think you're doing...

469
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:02,421
coming in here, charming
the pants off everyone?

470
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:05,633
-Not quite everyone, it seems.
-I知 serious, Luke.

471
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:07,468
What do you want?

472
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:10,012
Nothing that you're
not prepared to give.

473
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:13,391
You're my wife, and
they're my children...

474
00:39:14,475 --> 00:39:17,895
and I just want what I致e always
wanted: a little place of our own.

475
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:21,607
-I want to settle down with my family.
-Simple as that?

476
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:24,443
Luke, you can't just
ignore the last 10 years.

477
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:27,572
You can't just walk in here
as if nothing's happened.

478
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:31,659
All those years, the kids needed
a father, where the hell were you?

479
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:33,953
You walked out on me, remember?

480
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:37,081
And what about you, all those years?

481
00:39:37,456 --> 00:39:41,294
You can't tell me that you haven't
needed a husband, wanted a man.

482
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:46,799
The real reason that I致e come
back here is to say that I知 sorry.

483
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:48,467
I apologize.

484
00:39:49,594 --> 00:39:51,929
You were right, and I was wrong.

485
00:39:58,311 --> 00:40:00,062
Look, I miss you...

486
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,274
and I want you back.

487
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:05,943
I love you, Megan.

488
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:07,528
I always have.

489
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,954
-What's this?
-That's your dowry.

490
00:40:17,747 --> 00:40:20,583
There's $20,000 there,
with 10 years interest.

491
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:23,252
I don't want it.

492
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:26,213
When you left me, you told
me I could keep the money...

493
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:28,215
so long as you didn't
have to see me again.

494
00:40:28,883 --> 00:40:29,967
Well...

495
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:32,845
you've seen me.

496
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,182
Keep the money.

497
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:20,351
They can't do this.

498
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:23,562
The Allies are winning.
They can do what they want.

499
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,110
They're coming close to
San Lorenzo. I must go.

500
00:41:29,193 --> 00:41:31,612
There's nothing you
can do there tonight.

501
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:50,714
Keep calm. You are safe here.

502
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:55,094
What is it, Grandpa?
What's happening?

503
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:57,596
It is the end of the world.

504
00:42:44,018 --> 00:42:45,394
This is your doing.

505
00:42:45,477 --> 00:42:47,980
This is God's vengeance
for bringing them here.

506
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:49,982
You even brought Jews
to a Christian place.

507
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:52,693
-Father, that's enough.
-I curse you.

508
00:42:55,988 --> 00:42:59,283
What are you doing? Get
back down there. Go on.

509
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:04,788
You're safe here. You're
20 feet underground.

510
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:09,126
This is the best bomb shelter ever
built. Why would you want to be out?

511
00:43:11,086 --> 00:43:12,796
What I told you is true.

512
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,633
This is your sanctuary.
Here, you're safe.

513
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:17,551
That's why I chose this place.

514
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:20,012
Now, go back to your
places, all of you.

515
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:22,765
-Go on.
-I知 sorry, Father. We did try.

516
00:43:24,642 --> 00:43:26,852
Listen to me. Listen!

517
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:30,564
The bombs won't last much longer.

518
00:43:30,648 --> 00:43:33,150
And you should be happy,
they're American bombs...

519
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:36,362
and that means the end of the
war is coming closer and closer.

520
00:43:36,445 --> 00:43:37,947
Good for the Yanks!

521
00:43:39,323 --> 00:43:41,033
That's the spirit.

522
00:43:41,825 --> 00:43:44,244
I know you're all
frightened. I am, too.

523
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,290
But we're in God's hands now,
and he's spared our lives so far.

524
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,501
Let's give thanks to him.

525
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:54,421
-Should I pray, too, Grandpa?
-Pray, Samuel.

526
00:43:55,714 --> 00:43:59,510
Pray with all your heart.
Pray for that priest.

527
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:03,055
He will be your salvation.

528
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:09,436
Our Father, who art in heaven...

529
00:44:09,937 --> 00:44:11,814
hallowed be Thy name.

530
00:44:11,939 --> 00:44:14,900
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done...

531
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:17,820
on Earth as it is in heaven.

532
00:44:17,986 --> 00:44:20,489
Give us this day our daily bread.

533
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:22,700
And forgive us our trespasses...

534
00:44:22,783 --> 00:44:25,661
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

535
00:44:26,578 --> 00:44:28,956
And lead us not into temptation...

536
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,125
but deliver us from evil.

537
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:33,043
Amen.

538
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:49,017
Grandpa!

539
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:13,709
Samuel, come here, boy. Come here.

540
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:19,715
Hush. Don't cry.

541
00:45:20,174 --> 00:45:23,719
He's safe with God now, and
you'll be all right, Samuel.

542
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:25,429
I promise you.

543
00:45:26,305 --> 00:45:29,683
I swore to your grandfather
that I壇 keep you safe...

544
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,686
and I will.

545
00:45:34,521 --> 00:45:35,772
I will.

546
00:45:37,232 --> 00:45:40,360
You promised me no scandal,
and look what you have done.

547
00:45:40,527 --> 00:45:42,863
Thousands taken from
the Carson estate.

548
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:46,325
-Believe me, it was a worthy cause.
-You broke your word.

549
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:51,622
Food, yes. Medicine, clothing, yes.
All that, the Church might forgive.

550
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:55,667
But money to buy
passage to America...

551
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:57,169
for some
little boy--

552
00:45:57,252 --> 00:45:59,129
He was a very special case.

553
00:45:59,213 --> 00:46:01,840
It's always a special
case. Every case is special.

554
00:46:01,924 --> 00:46:04,509
I agree with you, but if
your enemies know about it...

555
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:07,262
they will do everything in
their power to destroy you.

556
00:46:07,346 --> 00:46:10,682
Is that what the Church is?
Intrigue, power, politics?

557
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:14,144
Yes, that's what the Church
is: power and politics.

558
00:46:14,353 --> 00:46:17,064
And you should have learned
that a long time ago.

559
00:46:17,147 --> 00:46:19,775
In their eyes, you committed a crime.

560
00:46:20,943 --> 00:46:23,779
The Church demands
obedience to your vows.

561
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:28,867
Where was your vow of poverty
when you used the Carson money?

562
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:32,287
Where was your vow of obedience
when you broke your word to me?

563
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:35,832
And let's not talk about
your vow of chastity.

564
00:46:38,627 --> 00:46:39,920
And on top of everything...

565
00:46:40,003 --> 00:46:43,674
you neglected the fortune
you're in charge of: Drogheda.

566
00:46:43,966 --> 00:46:46,718
-It's also the Church's property.
-Your Eminence?

567
00:46:46,802 --> 00:46:49,388
Don't you know that Drogheda
is devastated by drought?

568
00:46:49,471 --> 00:46:51,014
There is often drought in Australia.

569
00:46:51,098 --> 00:46:52,683
Drought.

570
00:46:53,058 --> 00:46:54,935
Perhaps you should see for yourself.

571
00:46:55,018 --> 00:46:57,479
I知 going to send
you back to Australia.

572
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:00,607
Not to Australia.

573
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:03,110
Vittorio, I beg you.

574
00:47:03,193 --> 00:47:05,821
I warned you, but
you wouldn't listen.

575
00:47:05,946 --> 00:47:08,740
lf this comes out, there
will be a scandal here...

576
00:47:08,824 --> 00:47:10,784
and you are better out of it.

577
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:12,411
And there, you can discuss...

578
00:47:12,494 --> 00:47:16,039
the resettlement of refugees
in that country after the war.

579
00:47:16,123 --> 00:47:19,084
It would do much to
repair your reputation.

580
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:20,669
Not Australia.

581
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:24,047
Please!

582
00:47:24,506 --> 00:47:25,757
Why not?

583
00:47:26,758 --> 00:47:29,010
Is there any temptation there?

584
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:37,018
Then perhaps, like our
Lord in the wilderness...

585
00:47:39,479 --> 00:47:41,732
you should learn to resist it.

586
00:48:19,352 --> 00:48:20,687
Can he drive it yet?

587
00:48:21,688 --> 00:48:22,939
The boy's a legend.

588
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:28,028
Go on.

589
00:48:28,236 --> 00:48:29,779
You're good.

590
00:48:48,173 --> 00:48:50,550
Don't pet the dog before dinner.

591
00:48:52,761 --> 00:48:54,221
There you go, Dad.

592
00:48:54,304 --> 00:48:58,225
-Great tucker, Justine.
-Thanks, Dad. Mom helped.

593
00:48:58,308 --> 00:48:59,976
I just supervised.

594
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,604
You'll make someone
a great little wife.

595
00:49:02,687 --> 00:49:05,899
I知 not going to get
married, not for a long time.

596
00:49:05,982 --> 00:49:07,567
I知 going to be an actress.

597
00:49:07,651 --> 00:49:10,403
My word, Dane, we're going to
have an actress in the family.

598
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:12,614
She just likes showing off.

599
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:15,408
And what about you, boy?
What do you want to be?

600
00:49:15,492 --> 00:49:16,785
A priest.

601
00:49:17,077 --> 00:49:19,204
Is that so? And why's that?

602
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:21,373
I don't know, I just want to.

603
00:49:21,456 --> 00:49:23,959
I think that's a terrific thing...

604
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:27,629
but having a wife and a family...

605
00:49:28,255 --> 00:49:30,674
that's a very special thing, too.

606
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:34,052
It's been hard on us
all, not being together.

607
00:49:34,135 --> 00:49:36,721
I bought a farm. Put a
deposit on it, anyway.

608
00:49:36,805 --> 00:49:38,098
We could all live together.

609
00:49:38,181 --> 00:49:40,350
And then you might decide that
having a family of your own...

610
00:49:40,433 --> 00:49:41,768
is much better than being a priest.

611
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:44,312
It's been pretty good this
last little while, hasn't it?

612
00:49:44,396 --> 00:49:45,480
-Yes.
-Too right.

613
00:49:45,563 --> 00:49:47,607
And it will get better
and better, I promise.

614
00:49:47,691 --> 00:49:50,235
When can we move, Dad?
When can we go there?

615
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:53,822
That's not up to me. That's
up to your mother to decide.

616
00:49:56,741 --> 00:49:59,494
But we'll talk about
that after dinner.

617
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,501
Can you pass the salt?

618
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,712
Pass the bread, Mom.

619
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:11,089
Yeah, good night.

620
00:50:11,423 --> 00:50:13,383
-Good night, darling.
-Good night, Dad.

621
00:50:14,259 --> 00:50:17,178
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, Justine.

622
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:23,018
You don't play fair, Luke.

623
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:25,437
You come swanning in here
like Father Christmas...

624
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,773
making them think you're the
most wonderful man in the world.

625
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:30,233
Well, I am.

626
00:50:32,068 --> 00:50:33,194
Walk me home?

627
00:50:33,278 --> 00:50:35,196
-Scared of the dark?
-No.

628
00:50:36,072 --> 00:50:37,866
Scared of losing you.

629
00:50:55,592 --> 00:50:57,594
This isn't going to work.

630
00:50:59,596 --> 00:51:01,389
At least let me try.

631
00:51:02,182 --> 00:51:03,975
You owe me that much.

632
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,854
And you owe it to the children.

633
00:52:41,447 --> 00:52:43,533
-Meggie?
-Mom!

634
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:47,287
-I知 going to Sydney.
-What's happened?

635
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,539
Jack's been sent there
to see some specialist.

636
00:52:49,622 --> 00:52:53,584
He says he'll be in hospital for a
while. I have to be there to see him.

637
00:53:03,428 --> 00:53:07,223
-Please, Mom, let me drive.
-No, I致e got to get used to it.

638
00:53:09,976 --> 00:53:12,854
Now that you're going to be
living with Luke on his farm...

639
00:53:12,937 --> 00:53:15,231
I値l be doing a lot of driving.

640
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:19,736
-The children told me.
-It's not definite yet.

641
00:53:19,819 --> 00:53:22,488
Hopefully, you'll have
more children. Sons.

642
00:53:22,572 --> 00:53:24,407
I already have a son.

643
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,285
What if he becomes a priest?

644
00:53:27,368 --> 00:53:29,871
Who'll inherit all this
if Dane never has children?

645
00:53:29,954 --> 00:53:32,999
He can't inherit Drogheda anyway,
Mom. It belongs to the Church.

646
00:53:33,082 --> 00:53:37,253
It's ours to care for, at
least as long as we have sons.

647
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:39,505
And it should have been ours.

648
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:43,176
Your father and your brothers
worked hard for this place.

649
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:46,429
It's the most spiteful
thing Mary Carson ever did.

650
00:53:55,521 --> 00:53:57,440
Just leave them there. Thank you.

651
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:05,198
-You sure you'll be all right, Mom?
-Oh, Meggie, I知 not a child.

652
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:07,158
Give my love to Jackie.

653
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:47,365
-Hello, Meggie.
-Ralph.

654
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:51,077
-You're looking very well.
-And you.

655
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:55,915
-I had no idea you were coming.
-It was all very sudden.

656
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:59,877
You didn't write.
You didn't telephone.

657
00:55:00,044 --> 00:55:03,756
Ten years of nothing. Only
letters to Mom about Drogheda.

658
00:55:04,298 --> 00:55:06,926
-What could I say?
-That you missed me.

659
00:55:08,094 --> 00:55:10,137
That you were coming home.

660
00:55:10,388 --> 00:55:12,974
I mean, how were you going
to get out to Drogheda?

661
00:55:13,057 --> 00:55:16,644
I値l be staying at the presbytery in
town. I was going to call from there.

662
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:18,396
Why there? Why are you staying there?

663
00:55:18,479 --> 00:55:21,607
I have a lot of Church
business to take care of.

664
00:55:24,193 --> 00:55:27,029
A lot of things have changed, Meggie.

665
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:30,283
Yes, they have.

666
00:55:38,457 --> 00:55:41,335
-How bad is the drought?
-It's over two years now.

667
00:55:41,419 --> 00:55:43,337
We're running half
the sheep we used to...

668
00:55:43,421 --> 00:55:46,257
which you'd have known if
you'd read the reports properly.

669
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,968
For pity's sake,
Meggie, stop the car.

670
00:55:57,393 --> 00:56:00,479
-Why did you come back?
-Because of the drought.

671
00:56:02,106 --> 00:56:03,774
To see for myself.

672
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:19,790
-Are you so unhappy I知 here?
-Yes.

673
00:56:22,918 --> 00:56:24,003
No.

674
00:56:26,297 --> 00:56:28,591
Ralph, 10 years ago
you said you loved me...

675
00:56:28,674 --> 00:56:32,428
and even though I knew you
loved God more, it didn't matter.

676
00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:34,472
But then you left me.

677
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:38,809
You went back to Rome and I
tried very hard to forget you...

678
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:41,520
without much success.

679
00:56:42,897 --> 00:56:45,941
I waited and I dreamed. I
didn't hear a word from you.

680
00:56:46,025 --> 00:56:49,236
And now, just when I thought I壇
found a way to live without you...

681
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,489
you turn up, out of the blue.

682
00:56:53,365 --> 00:56:55,284
Why have you come back?

683
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,830
Why do you always come back just
when I think I don't need you?

684
00:56:59,914 --> 00:57:02,750
I had no choice, Meggie.
The Church sent me.

685
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,127
I certainly had no idea
you'd be at the station.

686
00:57:05,211 --> 00:57:08,172
I had planned to keep some distance.

687
00:57:10,883 --> 00:57:13,594
But now, seeing you...

688
00:57:18,224 --> 00:57:21,018
I can't let things
be the way they were.

689
00:57:24,396 --> 00:57:26,315
I知 going back to Luke.

690
00:58:09,275 --> 00:58:12,403
You did very good. But you, mate,
you got to keep your head down.

691
00:58:12,486 --> 00:58:15,030
You got to keep your head
down near the horse's head.

692
00:58:15,114 --> 00:58:18,993
You gotta talk to him like a friend.
Gotta let him know you're his boss.

693
00:58:19,076 --> 00:58:20,244
Mom doesn't do that.

694
00:58:20,327 --> 00:58:23,872
Yeah, well, your mom's always
been a bit formal in the saddle.

695
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,751
Who's that with Mom?

696
00:58:28,252 --> 00:58:30,170
Trouble, that's who it is.

697
00:58:30,254 --> 00:58:34,466
Dane, Justine, I want you
to meet someone very special.

698
00:58:35,718 --> 00:58:39,513
This is Archbishop de Bricassart.
He's come all the way from Rome.

699
00:58:39,597 --> 00:58:41,140
Hello, Justine.

700
00:58:42,141 --> 00:58:43,601
Hello, Dane.

701
00:58:52,818 --> 00:58:56,196
-Dane, don't be so prissy.
-Justine, behave yourself.

702
00:58:56,322 --> 00:58:58,240
Hello, Luke. Thanks
for helping out here.

703
00:58:58,324 --> 00:59:00,826
I didn't do it for you.
I did it for Meggie.

704
00:59:02,244 --> 00:59:04,246
-I値l go and stable the horses.
-I will, Dad.

705
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:06,040
No. You stay here with your ma and...

706
00:59:06,457 --> 00:59:07,583
him.

707
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,668
-Dane.
-Yes, Dad.

708
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:14,590
Justine.

709
00:59:18,886 --> 00:59:21,555
He's too cute!

710
00:59:27,436 --> 00:59:31,357
-Have you ever met the Pope?
-Quite a few times.

711
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:34,860
-What's he like?
-Dane, he's just a man.

712
00:59:35,402 --> 00:59:37,029
In a white dress.

713
00:59:37,363 --> 00:59:38,572
Justine.

714
00:59:39,698 --> 00:59:41,742
It's all right,
Meggie. I知 used to it.

715
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:44,953
And it's true. The Pope
is a very special man.

716
00:59:45,204 --> 00:59:48,791
The representative of God on
Earth, but still, he's only a man.

717
00:59:48,957 --> 00:59:52,461
We're all only men, trying to
serve God the best way we can.

718
00:59:52,544 --> 00:59:54,463
That's what I want to do.

719
00:59:54,546 --> 00:59:56,882
Dane, that's enough.

720
00:59:59,343 --> 01:00:02,179
-That's a very big decision, Dane.
-No, it isn't. It's easy.

721
01:00:02,262 --> 01:00:04,139
Don't argue with
the Archbishop, Dane.

722
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,350
I知 not arguing, I知
agreeing with him.

723
01:00:06,433 --> 01:00:08,811
You're just a nipper, and
you're much too young...

724
01:00:08,894 --> 01:00:11,647
to be worrying about your future yet.

725
01:00:12,356 --> 01:00:14,108
So why are you here?

726
01:00:14,399 --> 01:00:17,528
There must be more important
things to do in Europe.

727
01:00:17,611 --> 01:00:19,488
My superiors were
concerned about Drogheda.

728
01:00:19,571 --> 01:00:21,323
Why? Have I been
doing such a bad job?

729
01:00:21,406 --> 01:00:23,450
You've been doing remarkably well...

730
01:00:23,534 --> 01:00:26,995
but the Vatican doesn't
understand Australian droughts.

731
01:00:27,412 --> 01:00:30,791
-What are you going to do, pray for rain?
-Of course.

732
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:32,709
And there are other reasons.

733
01:00:32,793 --> 01:00:36,672
The war in Europe is
winding down, at last...

734
01:00:36,755 --> 01:00:40,509
and countless thousands of
people are displaced, misplaced...

735
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:42,177
and can't go home again.

736
01:00:42,261 --> 01:00:44,555
They have no homes, or
even countries, to go to.

737
01:00:44,638 --> 01:00:46,682
We have to find other
places for them to live.

738
01:00:46,765 --> 01:00:48,475
-Here?
-Some of them, I hope.

739
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,020
I致e been sent here to try and
negotiate with the Australian government.

740
01:00:52,104 --> 01:00:55,607
-They're coming here?
-They have to go somewhere, Luke.

741
01:00:56,108 --> 01:00:57,860
Cripes, that's the
last thing we need...

742
01:00:57,943 --> 01:01:00,195
is a bunch of reffos
running around Australia.

743
01:01:00,279 --> 01:01:01,864
Luke!

744
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:05,117
I got no taste for
this. Best be on my way.

745
01:01:10,873 --> 01:01:12,499
I知 sorry, Ralph.

746
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:16,879
-Why don't people want the refugees?
-Because they're different.

747
01:01:18,255 --> 01:01:21,174
And people don't like
things to be different.

748
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:50,370
I used to come here when
I was sad or lonely...

749
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:53,874
when I needed to talk
to you, to see you.

750
01:01:55,584 --> 01:01:59,588
I壇 close my eyes,
and I壇 dream of you.

751
01:02:01,423 --> 01:02:05,260
And you'd always be here. Always.

752
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,847
Just as you are now.

753
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:12,768
Is that what it's like with God?

754
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:16,188
Can you walk into any empty
church and just talk to him...

755
01:02:16,271 --> 01:02:18,607
like I came here to talk to you?

756
01:02:20,817 --> 01:02:23,528
-I don't think God hears me anymore.
-Why?

757
01:02:24,404 --> 01:02:27,074
-What's happened to you?
-Perhaps it's the war.

758
01:02:29,201 --> 01:02:32,746
Perhaps I don't want
things to be different.

759
01:02:37,918 --> 01:02:41,046
-What do you think of Dane?
-He's a fine boy.

760
01:02:41,797 --> 01:02:43,632
You and Luke must
be very proud of him.

761
01:02:43,715 --> 01:02:45,467
He wants to be a priest.

762
01:02:46,176 --> 01:02:48,595
Stop him, I beg you.
I couldn't bear it.

763
01:02:49,179 --> 01:02:50,722
Because of me?

764
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:53,809
I lost you to God. I don't
want to lose Dane, as well.

765
01:02:53,892 --> 01:02:55,811
Meggie, you never lost me.

766
01:02:57,187 --> 01:02:59,481
You think I haven't wanted you?

767
01:02:59,648 --> 01:03:02,275
Every moment, waking,
sleeping, praying...

768
01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:04,653
you've been in my
heart and in my mind.

769
01:03:04,736 --> 01:03:07,823
I need the warmth of
someone real beside me...

770
01:03:07,906 --> 01:03:09,491
not the cold love of God.

771
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,034
Luke?

772
01:03:12,661 --> 01:03:15,330
He's changed, he
wants to settle down.

773
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,961
I知 pregnant. I知 going
to have Luke's baby.

774
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:23,797
-What?
-That's what you wanted, isn't it?

775
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,133
''Marry Luke and be
happy,'' you said.

776
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:29,636
''Settle down and
have lots of babies.''

777
01:03:31,138 --> 01:03:33,974
Well, that's exactly
what I知 going to do.

778
01:03:35,183 --> 01:03:37,352
I知 going to be a
good Catholic girl...

779
01:03:37,435 --> 01:03:41,189
and have lots and lots of
babies, Luke's babies...

780
01:03:41,273 --> 01:03:43,817
-just as you said I should.
-Oh, Meggie.

781
01:03:58,832 --> 01:03:59,916
Hello, Luke.

782
01:04:00,876 --> 01:04:02,002
You again.

783
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:06,464
For Meggie's sake, I think you
and l should sort a few things out.

784
01:04:06,548 --> 01:04:10,302
We've got nothing to sort out.
She's my wife, you're the intruder.

785
01:04:10,385 --> 01:04:11,511
But she lives here.

786
01:04:11,595 --> 01:04:14,472
Not for much longer.
Meggie's back with me.

787
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:17,434
-She's going to have my baby.
-Yes, she told me.

788
01:04:17,517 --> 01:04:19,185
I知 very pleased for you both.

789
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:22,188
Drogheda is a wonderful
place for children.

790
01:04:22,355 --> 01:04:24,608
No, we're not staying here.

791
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:27,193
-But there's no reason for you to leave.
-Yes, there is.

792
01:04:27,277 --> 01:04:30,322
You think I want this new kid
growing up in this Catholic hothouse?

793
01:04:30,405 --> 01:04:32,616
Look what happened to
the other two, to Dane.

794
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:34,868
The Church has never
interfered with your life.

795
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:37,203
Maybe not the Church directly.

796
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:39,080
But you have, haven't you?

797
01:04:39,873 --> 01:04:41,917
So, I知 buying a place of my own.

798
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,045
Not much by your standards,
but I think we'll be happy.

799
01:04:45,128 --> 01:04:47,714
And she won't be here for
you to come running back to...

800
01:04:47,797 --> 01:04:49,633
every time you need
a dose of reality.

801
01:04:49,716 --> 01:04:52,427
But you can stay on here. I値l
hire you to manage the place.

802
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:55,513
I知 not slaving the rest of my
days working for some mick in Rome.

803
01:04:55,597 --> 01:04:57,807
Meggie's brothers can break their
backs running this place for you...

804
01:04:57,891 --> 01:04:59,309
when they get back from the war...

805
01:04:59,392 --> 01:05:01,519
but I値l have no part of it.

806
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:04,689
You conned old Mary Carson
into giving you this place...

807
01:05:04,773 --> 01:05:07,901
and I壇 love to know the
truth of that one one day...

808
01:05:07,984 --> 01:05:09,611
but it's all yours now...

809
01:05:09,694 --> 01:05:11,571
lock, stock and barrel.

810
01:05:12,364 --> 01:05:14,658
And I wish you the joy of it.

811
01:05:15,075 --> 01:05:17,077
But I keep Meggie.

812
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,170
-My Lord.
-Why don't you call me Ralph?

813
01:06:50,503 --> 01:06:53,131
-Because you're an archbishop.
-Pretend I知 not.

814
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:55,133
Not here.

815
01:06:55,884 --> 01:06:58,511
It's one of the last
waterholes left...

816
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,054
because of the drought.

817
01:07:00,138 --> 01:07:02,682
The wild animals come
here at sunset to drink.

818
01:07:03,933 --> 01:07:05,518
I love it here.

819
01:07:07,854 --> 01:07:09,939
Do you like being a priest?

820
01:07:13,693 --> 01:07:16,487
Sometimes I find it
very difficult, Dane.

821
01:07:18,198 --> 01:07:21,868
I seem to spend my
life searching for God.

822
01:07:22,035 --> 01:07:25,205
Father Hammond, my
teacher, says God is here.

823
01:07:25,663 --> 01:07:29,083
-They say God is everywhere.
-Yes, but especially here.

824
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:33,129
You're very lucky, Dane.
Not everyone has this.

825
01:07:33,296 --> 01:07:36,424
-You said he was everywhere.
-You sound like a Jesuit.

826
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,011
I知 going to a Jesuit school
in Sydney in a couple of years.

827
01:07:40,094 --> 01:07:41,638
At least, I was.

828
01:07:41,721 --> 01:07:44,557
Now Dad's come back, and
he isn't too keen on it.

829
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:47,518
What's all this about you
wanting to be a priest?

830
01:07:47,602 --> 01:07:50,313
Everyone says I should wait
until I知 older to decide...

831
01:07:50,396 --> 01:07:54,108
-but I don't know why.
-You're very young, and you'll change.

832
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,986
In a couple of years, things
will happen to your body...

833
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:59,155
and you'll start getting
interested in girls...

834
01:07:59,238 --> 01:08:01,407
and that's a very big
problem for a priest.

835
01:08:01,532 --> 01:08:02,951
I know about girls.

836
01:08:03,034 --> 01:08:05,870
I致e seen the animals.
I know what goes on.

837
01:08:05,954 --> 01:08:09,123
You may know certain facts,
but you can't know the feeling.

838
01:08:09,248 --> 01:08:11,584
That doesn't happen till later.

839
01:08:13,002 --> 01:08:16,839
I fell in love once, and my
whole life has been a battle...

840
01:08:16,923 --> 01:08:19,175
to decide if I love
her more than God.

841
01:08:20,134 --> 01:08:22,637
But you wouldn't leave the Church.

842
01:08:25,306 --> 01:08:26,391
No.

843
01:08:27,684 --> 01:08:30,520
No, she deserves the best
that life can give her...

844
01:08:30,603 --> 01:08:32,980
and I don't think that's me.

845
01:08:33,815 --> 01:08:35,483
So it's all right?

846
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,862
I wish it were that easy.

847
01:08:43,574 --> 01:08:45,326
Look.

848
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,322
Where's the ward? Thank you.

849
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:28,119
So silly, all this
rain here in Sydney...

850
01:09:28,202 --> 01:09:31,080
and 1,000 miles away, we're
desperate for one drop.

851
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:37,587
Now, what did the
specialist say, Jack?

852
01:09:39,338 --> 01:09:41,132
Same as all the others.

853
01:09:41,966 --> 01:09:45,261
You ain't going to get any
grandsons out of me, Mom.

854
01:09:46,554 --> 01:09:49,098
Half a man, that's what I am now.

855
01:09:49,307 --> 01:09:52,643
Don't talk like that, you
can still have a fine life.

856
01:09:54,061 --> 01:09:58,065
It was never very important before,
getting married, having kids.

857
01:09:58,316 --> 01:10:01,986
Plenty of time for that, I
thought. Any bloke can do that.

858
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,155
That's the easy part.

859
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:07,074
I was wrong.

860
01:10:09,118 --> 01:10:12,163
-I知 sorry, Mom.
-Don't be silly.

861
01:10:12,663 --> 01:10:16,500
I know how much you wanted grandchildren
to carry on the family line.

862
01:10:16,584 --> 01:10:19,462
I have grandchildren:
Justine and Dane.

863
01:10:19,545 --> 01:10:21,005
Yeah, but they're Luke's kids.

864
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:23,674
They're not Clearys to carry
on at Drogheda, are they?

865
01:10:25,092 --> 01:10:29,388
''Sons,'' you always used to say.
''Sons are what a mother cares about.''

866
01:10:30,014 --> 01:10:33,017
All your sons have been
a disappointment to you.

867
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,646
Stu's dead, Frank locked up
for the rest of his life...

868
01:10:37,855 --> 01:10:39,273
and now me.

869
01:10:41,692 --> 01:10:44,445
My sons have been my greatest joy.

870
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:49,992
-Momma...
-It is God's will, dear.

871
01:10:50,618 --> 01:10:52,453
We must trust in him.

872
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,179
-What is it?
-It's Luke.

873
01:11:10,888 --> 01:11:14,058
He thinks you're encouraging
Dane to become a priest.

874
01:11:15,643 --> 01:11:18,813
-I won't be a problem much longer.
-Why?

875
01:11:20,481 --> 01:11:22,400
Because you're leaving...

876
01:11:22,483 --> 01:11:25,361
and when you all move away,
he won't have to see me again.

877
01:11:25,444 --> 01:11:28,406
-But I値l still see you.
-No, Meggie.

878
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:32,493
Sooner or later, I値l be
going back to Rome, and...

879
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:35,955
you two have a life together
that doesn't include me.

880
01:11:36,038 --> 01:11:39,250
We can still see each
other while you're here.

881
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:42,086
-You're part of my life.
-I知 part of your past.

882
01:11:44,338 --> 01:11:47,508
You've chosen a new life with
Luke, which is right and proper...

883
01:11:47,591 --> 01:11:49,760
though I don't think
it'll be easy for you.

884
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:52,513
The last thing you need
at the moment is me.

885
01:11:52,596 --> 01:11:55,641
I知 upsetting you,
making Luke angry...

886
01:11:55,725 --> 01:11:57,476
and hurting myself.

887
01:12:00,146 --> 01:12:02,565
I didn't want to come back here.

888
01:12:03,774 --> 01:12:07,194
And when I had to,
I swore to myself...

889
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:10,072
that I壇 see you as
little as possible.

890
01:12:10,948 --> 01:12:12,616
What a fool I was.

891
01:12:13,743 --> 01:12:16,162
What I really wanted
was for things...

892
01:12:16,704 --> 01:12:19,540
to be as they always
had been between us.

893
01:12:23,961 --> 01:12:28,090
But you're right.
Too much has changed.

894
01:12:30,426 --> 01:12:31,927
Go with Luke...

895
01:12:34,096 --> 01:12:37,725
and find as much
happiness as you can.

896
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,628
Well, here we are.

897
01:13:06,253 --> 01:13:07,838
Home sweet home.

898
01:13:11,091 --> 01:13:12,343
It's fine.

899
01:13:13,802 --> 01:13:16,472
-Where's all the livestock?
-There ain't none yet.

900
01:13:16,555 --> 01:13:20,226
This place hasn't been worked in years.
That's why I picked it up for a song.

901
01:13:20,309 --> 01:13:21,810
We'll get some stock cheap...

902
01:13:21,977 --> 01:13:24,647
and we'll have it looking
like a farm in no time.

903
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:27,149
Come on, Dane, let's find a creek.

904
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:31,153
Of course, it needs a
bit of fixing up, but...

905
01:13:34,531 --> 01:13:36,242
It's a great big kitchen...

906
01:13:36,325 --> 01:13:40,120
and the stoves come off the hearth.

907
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:43,582
I値l get you a new one
in a couple of years.

908
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:46,210
A bit of soap and water, you
won't even know the place.

909
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:51,757
You can hang the baby's
things up here. And look.

910
01:13:54,385 --> 01:13:56,845
We can put Justine in there...

911
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:02,184
and Dane can go in here.

912
01:14:08,524 --> 01:14:09,942
And this...

913
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,825
And this is us.

914
01:14:21,286 --> 01:14:23,080
So, what do you think?

915
01:14:25,749 --> 01:14:28,293
-It's awful, Luke.
-It's not that bad.

916
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:30,212
It is. It's terrible.

917
01:14:30,462 --> 01:14:33,007
It's gonna take months to
make this place livable.

918
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:35,759
When it does, we can put the
cot there for the little one.

919
01:14:35,843 --> 01:14:39,013
And then, when he gets bigger,
he can move in with Dane.

920
01:14:40,806 --> 01:14:42,725
So what's the bed like?

921
01:14:43,017 --> 01:14:45,060
I don't know. You try.

922
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:47,771
I知 going to go make a cup of tea.

923
01:14:57,573 --> 01:15:01,035
Well, this is the life.
All the family together.

924
01:15:03,078 --> 01:15:06,749
What are we gonna do about school,
Dad? Will we still use the wireless?

925
01:15:07,124 --> 01:15:09,835
At least you'll be going to
school in Sydney next year.

926
01:15:09,918 --> 01:15:11,462
I have to wait another two.

927
01:15:11,545 --> 01:15:14,631
Dane, your father doesn't
want you to go to Sydney.

928
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:16,675
He needs you here
on the farm, you see.

929
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:19,178
There's a school at
Gladstone, 20 miles away.

930
01:15:19,261 --> 01:15:20,846
It's a good school for country boys.

931
01:15:20,929 --> 01:15:22,765
-Is it Catholic?
-No.

932
01:15:22,848 --> 01:15:24,349
Then why do I have to go there?

933
01:15:24,433 --> 01:15:26,143
Because your father says so, darling.

934
01:15:26,226 --> 01:15:28,312
-But I知 going to be a priest.
-No, you ain't.

935
01:15:28,395 --> 01:15:30,522
lf you feel the same
when you leave school...

936
01:15:30,606 --> 01:15:33,066
-we'll talk about it then, all right?
-No, we won't.

937
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:34,943
It's not for now...

938
01:15:36,278 --> 01:15:37,613
it's for always.

939
01:15:47,456 --> 01:15:50,083
He'll never be able to have children.

940
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:52,377
Never have sons.

941
01:15:53,712 --> 01:15:57,090
He'll never know the beauty
of God's greatest gift.

942
01:16:06,642 --> 01:16:08,352
How can you do it?

943
01:16:09,603 --> 01:16:11,897
How can you possibly
choose a life like yours?

944
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:14,650
How can you not want
to have children?

945
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:20,239
I wanted to make the sacrifice...

946
01:16:20,697 --> 01:16:22,699
to prove my love for God.

947
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:29,748
You have every right
to be here, of course.

948
01:16:30,707 --> 01:16:34,044
But you must know, I would
much rather you weren't.

949
01:16:36,713 --> 01:16:39,633
You think I don't know
about you and Meggie?

950
01:16:40,759 --> 01:16:42,386
Mary Carson knew.

951
01:16:43,804 --> 01:16:47,057
She knew it the moment she
saw the two of you meet...

952
01:16:47,641 --> 01:16:49,434
all those years ago.

953
01:16:50,852 --> 01:16:53,313
And I think I always knew it, too.

954
01:16:53,855 --> 01:16:55,399
But I didn't want to believe it.

955
01:16:55,899 --> 01:16:59,444
And now, just when I thought everything
was over, you had to come back.

956
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:02,197
Fee, I知 a priest.
There's nothing between us.

957
01:17:02,281 --> 01:17:05,951
Then either I知 a
fool, or you're a liar.

958
01:17:09,413 --> 01:17:13,166
No, you're not a fool,
and I知 not a liar.

959
01:17:17,337 --> 01:17:20,132
That's all over now.
She's chosen Luke.

960
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:23,510
She chose Luke once before.
Look what happened then.

961
01:17:23,593 --> 01:17:26,263
Do you really think
Meggie doesn't love you?

962
01:17:26,346 --> 01:17:29,016
She doesn't want Luke. She
wants a father for the children.

963
01:17:29,099 --> 01:17:30,142
She wants you.

964
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:33,020
And all you would have to do
is to say the word, one word...

965
01:17:33,103 --> 01:17:34,938
and she would be with
you in a heartbeat.

966
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:36,315
I can't.

967
01:17:36,398 --> 01:17:38,692
I am nothing, I have nothing.

968
01:17:38,775 --> 01:17:40,694
Is that what you told her?

969
01:17:40,777 --> 01:17:43,822
Don't do to Meggie what
you did to Mary Carson.

970
01:17:43,905 --> 01:17:46,616
Don't destroy her with love.

971
01:18:15,187 --> 01:18:16,646
Grandma!

972
01:18:19,399 --> 01:18:22,319
You should see the new farm, it's
awful. But Dad's going to fix it up.

973
01:18:22,444 --> 01:18:24,279
How's Uncle Jack?
When's he coming home?

974
01:18:24,362 --> 01:18:26,073
Not for a while, dear.

975
01:18:26,156 --> 01:18:27,824
You're still here?

976
01:18:28,283 --> 01:18:30,327
-He won't let me be a priest.
-That's enough.

977
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:32,662
You don't discuss family
business with strangers.

978
01:18:32,746 --> 01:18:34,706
-Ralph is not a stranger.
-He is to me.

979
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:36,583
I壇 like to hear what
the boy has to say.

980
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:37,751
No.

981
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:40,670
Dane's my son, and I値l
bring him up my way.

982
01:18:40,754 --> 01:18:44,341
I don't want you interfering with his
education. I want you off this place.

983
01:18:44,424 --> 01:18:47,719
This is Church property, Luke. And
the Church demands that I be here.

984
01:18:47,803 --> 01:18:49,471
I値l stay as long as they need me.

985
01:18:49,554 --> 01:18:51,223
Then we'll get out of your way.

986
01:18:51,306 --> 01:18:53,600
My family and I will be out of
this place by the end of the week.

987
01:18:53,683 --> 01:18:54,851
What?

988
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:57,479
And if I ever catch you
sniffing around my boy...

989
01:18:57,687 --> 01:18:59,856
or my wife, or
anything else of mine...

990
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,983
I値l break your bloody neck.

991
01:19:02,067 --> 01:19:03,693
Luke, please.

992
01:19:15,956 --> 01:19:20,794
Luke, we cannot go to the farm,
not yet. There's too much to do.

993
01:19:20,877 --> 01:19:23,463
We're getting out of here.
There's a curse on this place.

994
01:19:23,547 --> 01:19:25,924
There's no running water,
the house is falling down.

995
01:19:26,007 --> 01:19:27,634
So we'll have to
rough it for a while.

996
01:19:27,717 --> 01:19:30,804
But I知 not going to be lorded
over by some snotty-nosed priest.

997
01:19:30,887 --> 01:19:32,138
He's just trying to help.

998
01:19:32,222 --> 01:19:34,808
I don't want his help, I
want him out of my life.

999
01:19:34,891 --> 01:19:38,311
I want him out of Dane's life,
and I want him out of your life.

1000
01:19:38,395 --> 01:19:41,231
I知 not going, Luke, not
until the farm is ready.

1001
01:19:41,314 --> 01:19:44,401
-You're my wife and you'll go where I say.
-You don't own me!

1002
01:19:44,484 --> 01:19:48,446
This is the same as last time, me
dancing to your beck and call...

1003
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:51,616
stuck in some dump
somewhere, never seeing you.

1004
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,536
-It's him, isn't it? That priest.
-Don't be ridiculous.

1005
01:19:54,619 --> 01:19:56,663
I never understood
before, but I do now.

1006
01:19:56,746 --> 01:19:59,165
So how many times has he
had his grubby hands on you?

1007
01:19:59,249 --> 01:20:00,917
Don't you ever say that!

1008
01:20:08,341 --> 01:20:10,302
-Luke!
-I知 sorry.

1009
01:20:12,554 --> 01:20:15,098
The baby, Luke, the baby!

1010
01:20:33,366 --> 01:20:34,743
Mr. O'Neill...

1011
01:20:36,286 --> 01:20:39,914
there was nothing we could do
to save the baby. I知 sorry.

1012
01:20:47,297 --> 01:20:49,716
And Meggie? Mrs. O'Neill?

1013
01:20:50,925 --> 01:20:52,510
She'll be fine.

1014
01:20:53,636 --> 01:20:55,096
I知 afraid...

1015
01:20:56,598 --> 01:20:59,934
Mr. O'Neill, I don't think she'll
be able to have any more children.

1016
01:21:00,018 --> 01:21:04,147
I could be wrong, and she should
see a specialist in Sydney, but...

1017
01:21:05,273 --> 01:21:07,317
She's resting now.

1018
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,820
Mr. O'Neill, I think she
might like to see you.

1019
01:21:11,112 --> 01:21:12,697
Yeah, sure.

1020
01:21:25,418 --> 01:21:27,212
How are you feeling?

1021
01:21:32,592 --> 01:21:34,636
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1022
01:21:36,262 --> 01:21:37,722
I was angry.

1023
01:21:39,432 --> 01:21:41,142
You made me angry.

1024
01:21:46,606 --> 01:21:49,651
You'll be up and about in a few
days, and we'll be out of here.

1025
01:21:49,734 --> 01:21:53,071
Didn't the doctor tell you?
There won't be any more children.

1026
01:21:54,113 --> 01:21:57,659
-Yeah, he told me.
-I値l never be able to give you a son.

1027
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:02,747
Don't get yourself all worked up
about it. I致e already got a son.

1028
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:05,333
I致e got Dane.

1029
01:22:16,135 --> 01:22:18,096
Meggie wants to see you.

1030
01:22:19,305 --> 01:22:22,767
Some Catholic mumbo-jumbo, I guess.

1031
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:58,344
Meggie, I知 so sorry.

1032
01:22:58,678 --> 01:23:01,306
It's my fault. I was such a fool.

1033
01:23:01,389 --> 01:23:03,641
-You couldn't have known.
-I could have.

1034
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:06,185
I was married to him, I
know what he's capable of.

1035
01:23:06,269 --> 01:23:07,687
There's no need for this now.

1036
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:11,107
I so much wanted to
believe that he'd changed...

1037
01:23:12,108 --> 01:23:15,570
and that I could live with him,
because the children needed a father.

1038
01:23:15,653 --> 01:23:17,905
You should have
written to me, told me.

1039
01:23:17,989 --> 01:23:20,700
I just couldn't stand
the guilt anymore.

1040
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:25,705
You have no idea how much
guilt a woman is made to feel...

1041
01:23:25,788 --> 01:23:27,248
when she leaves her husband.

1042
01:23:27,332 --> 01:23:29,709
You found the strength
to leave him once.

1043
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:34,380
I was unfaithful to
Luke, and I lied to you.

1044
01:23:35,173 --> 01:23:36,758
Don't do this to yourself.

1045
01:23:36,841 --> 01:23:39,177
This is God's revenge, isn't it?

1046
01:23:39,594 --> 01:23:41,346
He's taken my baby.

1047
01:23:42,597 --> 01:23:45,224
My poor, sweet, innocent baby.

1048
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:47,101
My baby.

1049
01:23:50,855 --> 01:23:51,981
Don't.

1050
01:23:57,028 --> 01:23:58,363
My baby.

1051
01:24:26,724 --> 01:24:28,893
Do whatever you want with me.

1052
01:24:30,728 --> 01:24:32,939
Do whatever you like with me.

1053
01:24:34,774 --> 01:24:36,734
You can have my faith...

1054
01:24:38,111 --> 01:24:39,862
have my vocation...

1055
01:24:41,197 --> 01:24:43,199
have my life.

1056
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:48,079
But not her.

1057
01:24:49,622 --> 01:24:52,041
Don't play games with her.

1058
01:24:53,334 --> 01:24:55,753
Let her be happy.

1059
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:58,798
Let her be happy.

1060
01:25:03,344 --> 01:25:04,846
Let her be happy.

1061
01:25:10,059 --> 01:25:13,604
It's not right, Justine. You
haven't been doing your homework.

1062
01:25:13,688 --> 01:25:16,148
Open your history book to Page 87.

1063
01:25:17,191 --> 01:25:18,985
Yes, Mrs. Henderson.

1064
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:24,407
You've been on your feet all
morning. Why don't you sit down?

1065
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:25,700
I知 all right, Mom.

1066
01:25:25,783 --> 01:25:27,743
Really. I promise you.

1067
01:25:29,161 --> 01:25:30,413
Where's Ralph?

1068
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:33,583
Went into town early to
talk to Father Hammond.

1069
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:35,793
Did you tell him?

1070
01:25:36,168 --> 01:25:38,880
You must. You must put
an end to these lies.

1071
01:25:38,963 --> 01:25:41,007
You must tell Luke,
and you must tell Ralph.

1072
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:43,801
No. The problem isn't with Ralph.

1073
01:25:44,218 --> 01:25:46,095
It's with Luke and me.

1074
01:25:50,016 --> 01:25:53,686
I can't tell Ralph about Dane.
But I can put the rest of it right.

1075
01:25:53,769 --> 01:25:55,563
I wish Ralph had never come back.

1076
01:25:55,646 --> 01:25:58,274
Look, don't blame Ralph, blame Luke.

1077
01:25:58,357 --> 01:26:01,110
He hit me. He caused this.

1078
01:26:22,089 --> 01:26:26,177
-So when will you be ready to go?
-I知 not going, Luke.

1079
01:26:27,178 --> 01:26:29,305
Look, I did a really bad thing.

1080
01:26:29,388 --> 01:26:32,308
I should never have agreed
to us getting back together.

1081
01:26:32,391 --> 01:26:35,895
You seemed pretty keen on the
idea till that priest turned up.

1082
01:26:35,978 --> 01:26:39,315
This has nothing to do with
Ralph. This is my decision.

1083
01:26:39,398 --> 01:26:41,817
-You're my wife.
-I was your wife.

1084
01:26:42,735 --> 01:26:46,238
Whatever there was between
us was over a long time ago.

1085
01:26:46,572 --> 01:26:47,907
I realize that now.

1086
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:50,076
-Is that your final word?
-Yes.

1087
01:26:50,701 --> 01:26:51,827
I知 sorry.

1088
01:26:51,911 --> 01:26:54,121
-Dane.
-What do you want with him?

1089
01:26:54,205 --> 01:26:55,998
It's none of your business anymore.

1090
01:26:56,082 --> 01:26:57,833
Go to your room, get
your things packed.

1091
01:26:57,917 --> 01:27:00,336
-Where are we going?
-We aren't going anywhere.

1092
01:27:00,419 --> 01:27:03,255
-It's just me and Dane.
-Oh, no. You are not having Dane.

1093
01:27:03,464 --> 01:27:05,257
You try and stop me.

1094
01:27:07,718 --> 01:27:09,845
-You're coming with me.
-But I don't want to go.

1095
01:27:09,929 --> 01:27:13,516
You'll do as you're told. Get to
your room and get your things packed.

1096
01:27:13,599 --> 01:27:16,185
-You must tell him now.
-I can't.

1097
01:27:16,602 --> 01:27:19,980
-What about me? Why not me?
-I don't want you. I知 sick of girls.

1098
01:27:20,231 --> 01:27:23,192
-All I want is my son.
-But I love you.

1099
01:27:23,275 --> 01:27:25,569
I want to be with
you. I don't like her.

1100
01:27:25,653 --> 01:27:28,406
-I hate her.
-Not half as much as I do.

1101
01:27:28,489 --> 01:27:31,742
You walked out on me once before.
I was a fool to trust you again.

1102
01:27:31,826 --> 01:27:34,745
-You can't just take Dane.
-He's my son, too!

1103
01:27:35,079 --> 01:27:38,707
All these years you kept him from me.
You never even told me I had a son.

1104
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:43,212
That's why I came back when I heard.
You think I came back here for you?

1105
01:27:43,504 --> 01:27:46,340
You think I came back for your
nagging and moaning again...

1106
01:27:46,424 --> 01:27:48,717
and carrying on like Lady Muck?

1107
01:27:49,135 --> 01:27:51,762
I was prepared to put up with
you for the sake of the boy.

1108
01:27:51,846 --> 01:27:55,224
But all I want is him. Now,
I told you to go and pack.

1109
01:27:55,307 --> 01:27:57,935
-No!
-You'll do without, then. Come on.

1110
01:27:58,936 --> 01:28:01,730
For God's sake, Luke,
please, don't do this.

1111
01:28:01,814 --> 01:28:02,982
-You watch me.
-Daddy!

1112
01:28:03,065 --> 01:28:06,402
-Daddy, I知 coming with you.
-You get back there with the other skirts.

1113
01:28:06,485 --> 01:28:09,613
Mommy, I don't want to go!

1114
01:28:09,697 --> 01:28:12,032
-Listen, please.
-Help me, Mommy!

1115
01:28:12,116 --> 01:28:15,870
-Take me with you, Daddy!
-As for you, go back to that priest.

1116
01:28:16,412 --> 01:28:19,081
-Meggie, tell him!
-You can't handle a real man.

1117
01:28:19,165 --> 01:28:21,292
Don't! No, don't!

1118
01:28:23,002 --> 01:28:24,336
Dane!

1119
01:28:30,134 --> 01:28:31,343
Mommy!

1120
01:30:42,933 --> 01:30:44,810
Luke's gone, and he's taken Dane.

1121
01:30:44,893 --> 01:30:47,855
-He can't do that.
-There wasn't much I could do to stop him.

1122
01:30:48,689 --> 01:30:52,025
Bring him back to me. Please
make Luke bring him back to me.

1123
01:31:18,802 --> 01:31:20,304
Come here, boy. Come on.

1124
01:31:24,975 --> 01:31:29,062
I致e been to the store, got you
some new pants and some shirts.

1125
01:31:29,897 --> 01:31:34,193
It's about time you were in long
pants, instead of those silly shorts.

1126
01:31:40,616 --> 01:31:44,578
This is a big adventure, two
blokes out here in the Never Never.

1127
01:31:44,703 --> 01:31:47,664
Why don't you go and
put those new pants on?

1128
01:31:48,373 --> 01:31:50,751
First long pants you've ever had.

1129
01:31:50,918 --> 01:31:53,337
They'll make you
feel like a new man...

1130
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,963
for a new life.

1131
01:31:55,881 --> 01:31:57,424
All right, Dad.

1132
01:31:58,091 --> 01:32:01,136
Look, boy, I know you're
upset, but it's done.

1133
01:32:02,554 --> 01:32:06,058
-So try and forget the past.
-I値l never forget Mom.

1134
01:32:06,767 --> 01:32:09,853
No one's expecting you
to. You'll see her again.

1135
01:32:10,228 --> 01:32:12,356
But in the meantime, Dane...

1136
01:32:12,689 --> 01:32:15,609
make the most of it,
because I知 all you got.

1137
01:32:35,963 --> 01:32:39,466
Look at you. Quite the
young man about town.

1138
01:32:40,842 --> 01:32:43,553
Two, four, six, eight.
Bog in, don't wait.

1139
01:32:49,309 --> 01:32:50,894
Can I say grace?

1140
01:32:51,561 --> 01:32:54,356
Well, you know, that
stuff gives me the willies.

1141
01:32:57,859 --> 01:32:59,277
lf you must.

1142
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:16,086
-Is there no chance between you?
-How can you ask me that?

1143
01:33:16,169 --> 01:33:19,631
-You were going back to him.
-Because the children needed a father...

1144
01:33:19,715 --> 01:33:21,717
and because I was lonely.

1145
01:33:22,008 --> 01:33:25,053
So I went back to Luke,
but it wasn't for love.

1146
01:33:25,512 --> 01:33:29,349
When he hit me, when I lost the
child, I realized he hated me.

1147
01:33:30,892 --> 01:33:34,438
He didn't come back here for
me, he came back here for Dane.

1148
01:33:34,521 --> 01:33:37,691
lf he had taken Justine as well,
maybe I could forgive him...

1149
01:33:37,774 --> 01:33:41,361
but he broke her heart,
and she blames me for that.

1150
01:33:43,905 --> 01:33:48,243
I致e made such a mess of
things. What am I going to do?

1151
01:33:48,368 --> 01:33:50,662
First of all, we must
get Dane back to you.

1152
01:33:50,745 --> 01:33:51,913
Yes.

1153
01:34:02,966 --> 01:34:06,303
I don't want to be too optimistic,
but I think you've got a good case.

1154
01:34:07,387 --> 01:34:11,975
It would be easier if you and Mr. O'Neill
were divorced or legally separated...

1155
01:34:12,058 --> 01:34:14,394
but in most cases of this kind...

1156
01:34:14,478 --> 01:34:17,314
the court will usually award
custody of any children...

1157
01:34:17,397 --> 01:34:19,399
-to the mother.
-Thank God.

1158
01:34:19,608 --> 01:34:22,819
Of course, you had agreed
to go back to Mr. O'Neill.

1159
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:27,199
-He attacked her physically.
-She is his wife.

1160
01:34:27,324 --> 01:34:28,909
She lost a child because of him.

1161
01:34:28,992 --> 01:34:31,203
And that will get a lot
of sympathy, of course...

1162
01:34:31,286 --> 01:34:33,580
but this is not a divorce case.

1163
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:36,750
Dane's welfare will be the
judge's primary concern.

1164
01:34:37,959 --> 01:34:41,213
Is there anything you
haven't told me? Anything...

1165
01:34:42,547 --> 01:34:44,507
I知 sorry to be personal.

1166
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:47,010
Anything that might
reflect on you as a mother?

1167
01:34:47,093 --> 01:34:50,764
Any special friendships outside
the marriage, for example?

1168
01:34:51,765 --> 01:34:56,019
Luke does not approve of my friendship
with Archbishop de Bricassart.

1169
01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:59,105
I imagine he'll try and
make something out of that.

1170
01:34:59,231 --> 01:35:01,650
I don't think that
will get him very far...

1171
01:35:01,733 --> 01:35:03,777
unless there's more to
it than meets the eye.

1172
01:35:04,611 --> 01:35:07,781
There's considerably more to it
than meets the eye, Mr. Gough.

1173
01:35:08,406 --> 01:35:10,533
The eye cannot see
what is in the heart.

1174
01:35:10,617 --> 01:35:13,620
And what is in my heart
is pure and wonderful.

1175
01:35:16,122 --> 01:35:17,499
Archbishop?

1176
01:35:18,792 --> 01:35:23,213
I am religious counselor to Mrs.
O'Neill. I have been for a very long time.

1177
01:35:23,296 --> 01:35:25,423
As you were to Mary Carson?

1178
01:35:26,257 --> 01:35:28,218
As I was to Mary Carson.

1179
01:35:28,927 --> 01:35:32,555
I知 sorry to have to probe,
but the court may do the same.

1180
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,851
So, let's see if we can't get
Dane back to you, Mrs. O'Neill.

1181
01:35:38,103 --> 01:35:39,437
Thank you.

1182
01:35:43,233 --> 01:35:44,651
I lied to him.

1183
01:35:45,276 --> 01:35:47,862
After all the promises I
made to myself and to you...

1184
01:35:47,946 --> 01:35:50,532
that I wouldn't tell any more lies...

1185
01:35:50,699 --> 01:35:52,325
and I couldn't tell him the truth.

1186
01:35:52,492 --> 01:35:54,869
We both lied, to get Dane back.

1187
01:35:56,121 --> 01:35:58,039
You heard what he said.

1188
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:02,168
lf anyone knew, if anyone found out
how much we have loved each other...

1189
01:36:02,252 --> 01:36:05,088
I shall lose Dane,
and I can't risk that.

1190
01:36:25,567 --> 01:36:27,694
Father Ralph. Is Mommy with you?

1191
01:36:27,777 --> 01:36:30,447
Not this time, Dane. I致e
come to talk to your father.

1192
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:33,116
-Want to see me on my new pony?
-Sure.

1193
01:36:40,957 --> 01:36:43,501
Meggie wants legal custody of Dane.

1194
01:36:47,964 --> 01:36:50,550
Look, Father Ralph, he can jump, too.

1195
01:36:56,681 --> 01:36:59,476
The natural place for that
boy is with his father...

1196
01:36:59,559 --> 01:37:02,187
and I値l take it to every
court in the land if I have to.

1197
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:06,232
You can't win, Luke. The
courts always favor the mother.

1198
01:37:06,608 --> 01:37:09,903
We'll see about that.
Now, if that's all...

1199
01:37:11,613 --> 01:37:14,449
you'd best be on your way. Cheers.

1200
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:26,586
Justine, I need to talk to you.

1201
01:37:29,255 --> 01:37:31,799
You can't stay in your room forever.

1202
01:37:33,343 --> 01:37:36,262
I have some news about
your father and Dane.

1203
01:37:44,562 --> 01:37:47,732
-What's the news?
-You may not like it very much.

1204
01:37:48,858 --> 01:37:51,694
I知 taking your father
to court to get Dane back.

1205
01:37:51,778 --> 01:37:55,573
-Why are you so horrible to Daddy?
-That's not fair, Justine.

1206
01:38:01,788 --> 01:38:03,289
Don't hate me.

1207
01:38:04,082 --> 01:38:05,875
You know, when I was your age...

1208
01:38:05,959 --> 01:38:09,796
I used to think your grandma
didn't love me. Well, I was wrong.

1209
01:38:11,005 --> 01:38:14,175
It breaks my heart to
think you feel the same way.

1210
01:38:15,677 --> 01:38:17,679
I just want to be happy.

1211
01:38:18,179 --> 01:38:22,183
We were happy, sort of,
when Daddy came back.

1212
01:38:23,101 --> 01:38:24,686
Till that priest showed up.

1213
01:38:24,769 --> 01:38:27,563
This has nothing to
do with Father Ralph.

1214
01:38:28,022 --> 01:38:31,025
And when we get Dane back,
we will be happy again.

1215
01:38:31,526 --> 01:38:34,779
I won't be, not here.
I want to be with Dad.

1216
01:38:35,905 --> 01:38:39,367
-After what he did to you?
-He didn't mean it. He loves me.

1217
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:42,704
Justine, Luke doesn't
love either of us.

1218
01:38:43,204 --> 01:38:45,206
He does, I know he does.

1219
01:38:46,666 --> 01:38:48,167
Listen to me.

1220
01:38:48,251 --> 01:38:50,420
They may ask you some
questions in court...

1221
01:38:50,503 --> 01:38:53,673
so I want you to think
about this very seriously.

1222
01:38:57,218 --> 01:39:00,138
Remember all the things
Luke did when he came back?

1223
01:39:00,221 --> 01:39:02,974
He never paid you any
attention. It was always Dane.

1224
01:39:03,057 --> 01:39:05,184
Now, that is true, isn't it?

1225
01:39:05,893 --> 01:39:08,229
Just think about it, promise me?

1226
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,193
It's all I ask.

1227
01:39:17,488 --> 01:39:19,449
Look, why don't you
have something to eat?

1228
01:39:19,532 --> 01:39:22,702
Or better still, come
downstairs and eat with us.

1229
01:39:23,578 --> 01:39:27,707
-Is he here, Father Ralph?
-Yes. He's helping me...

1230
01:39:42,889 --> 01:39:44,390
-Dane?
-Mommy!

1231
01:39:45,808 --> 01:39:47,977
Are you all right? Has
he been looking after you?

1232
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,687
We're doing great. Aren't we, Dane?

1233
01:39:49,771 --> 01:39:51,481
Why don't you come
and live with us, Mom?

1234
01:39:51,564 --> 01:39:54,275
And Justine, and Grandma.
We'd have a great time.

1235
01:39:54,859 --> 01:39:55,902
Darling.

1236
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:59,197
Luke.

1237
01:40:02,241 --> 01:40:03,451
Come on.

1238
01:40:05,077 --> 01:40:09,957
And is there no hope of reconciliation
with your husband, Mrs. O'Neill?

1239
01:40:10,041 --> 01:40:11,626
No, Your Honor.

1240
01:40:11,709 --> 01:40:14,962
I壇 have her back in a moment,
Your Honor, but she doesn't want me.

1241
01:40:15,046 --> 01:40:17,340
You hit me! I lost a
child because of you!

1242
01:40:17,423 --> 01:40:19,759
-What kind of love is that?
-That was an accident.

1243
01:40:19,842 --> 01:40:22,303
-You made me lose my temper.
-I warn you...

1244
01:40:22,386 --> 01:40:24,472
I will not tolerate
this sort of behavior.

1245
01:40:24,555 --> 01:40:27,308
This is a court of
law, not a farmyard.

1246
01:40:27,850 --> 01:40:29,393
Remember this:

1247
01:40:29,644 --> 01:40:33,481
I have to decide who is the
most suitable parent for the boy.

1248
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:38,152
At the moment, I am not
impressed by either of you.

1249
01:40:42,156 --> 01:40:43,824
Why did you wait 10 years...

1250
01:40:43,908 --> 01:40:46,911
before making contact with
your family, Mr. O'Neill?

1251
01:40:46,994 --> 01:40:49,872
I didn't know that I had a
son until a few months ago.

1252
01:40:49,956 --> 01:40:52,458
She didn't even tell me
that she was pregnant.

1253
01:40:52,542 --> 01:40:55,419
I heard it round the tracks,
so I was pretty cut up about it.

1254
01:40:55,503 --> 01:40:57,838
I mean, what man...

1255
01:40:58,464 --> 01:41:01,634
wouldn't want to be a
good father to his own son?

1256
01:41:01,717 --> 01:41:04,303
Most men want to be good
husbands to their wives.

1257
01:41:04,387 --> 01:41:05,805
I was that.

1258
01:41:06,222 --> 01:41:08,307
I was saving to buy
a place of our own.

1259
01:41:08,641 --> 01:41:12,311
Isn稚 it true that you already
had the money to buy your farm?

1260
01:41:12,395 --> 01:41:16,607
You had $20,000 given to
you by your wife's family.

1261
01:41:16,691 --> 01:41:20,486
That was her money, her
dowry. I wasn't gonna touch it.

1262
01:41:20,653 --> 01:41:23,364
But you still took it.
You stole it from me.

1263
01:41:23,447 --> 01:41:26,492
I put that money into
an account under my name.

1264
01:41:26,659 --> 01:41:28,953
And I never touched a penny of it.

1265
01:41:29,036 --> 01:41:32,623
I offered it back to Megan,
but she refused to take it.

1266
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:35,251
-Is that true, Mrs.
O'Neill? -Yes, but it--

1267
01:41:35,334 --> 01:41:37,086
Carry on, Mr. Gough.

1268
01:41:37,503 --> 01:41:38,754
Didn't you tell your wife...

1269
01:41:38,838 --> 01:41:41,090
that the only reason
you came back to her...

1270
01:41:41,173 --> 01:41:42,591
was for Dane?

1271
01:41:42,675 --> 01:41:44,427
That was a big part.

1272
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:47,138
Perhaps the biggest.

1273
01:41:48,514 --> 01:41:50,391
But I still loved her.

1274
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:54,270
And it was great. I thought
that everything was sweet.

1275
01:41:54,812 --> 01:41:57,565
Until that priest turned up,
and then everything changed.

1276
01:41:57,648 --> 01:42:00,151
Megan said it was over between us.

1277
01:42:00,234 --> 01:42:01,736
And I got mad...

1278
01:42:02,445 --> 01:42:05,031
and I said some things that
I shouldn't have said...

1279
01:42:05,114 --> 01:42:08,284
and I did some things
that I shouldn't have done.

1280
01:42:08,951 --> 01:42:10,161
Maybe.

1281
01:42:11,412 --> 01:42:14,457
Why do you think
the arrival of the...

1282
01:42:15,332 --> 01:42:18,127
-Archbishop de Bricassart, Your Honor.
-...priest...

1283
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:20,838
changed your wife's mind?

1284
01:42:21,630 --> 01:42:23,090
I don't know.

1285
01:42:24,133 --> 01:42:27,094
He's always had some
kind of hold over her.

1286
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:32,850
It's a Catholic thing.

1287
01:42:33,976 --> 01:42:37,021
So your son has been
raised as a Catholic?

1288
01:42:37,188 --> 01:42:38,272
Too right.

1289
01:42:38,731 --> 01:42:41,525
Look, I don't mind him
being raised a mick...

1290
01:42:42,359 --> 01:42:44,070
I beg your pardon, Your Worship.

1291
01:42:44,361 --> 01:42:45,738
But it's gone too far.

1292
01:42:46,155 --> 01:42:47,907
Dane is a good boy.

1293
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:51,035
But they've got their claws
in him. The Church, I mean.

1294
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:53,287
They even own Drogheda, his home.

1295
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:56,290
He goes on about being
a priest all the time.

1296
01:42:56,373 --> 01:42:57,917
He needs his dad.

1297
01:42:58,375 --> 01:43:01,045
And you don't want
him to be a priest?

1298
01:43:02,046 --> 01:43:03,714
What father would?

1299
01:43:05,925 --> 01:43:08,469
Why are you not in uniform,
serving your country?

1300
01:43:08,552 --> 01:43:11,096
I would be like a shot, Your Honor...

1301
01:43:11,347 --> 01:43:15,100
but I did my back cutting cane,
and the army say they won't have me.

1302
01:43:17,061 --> 01:43:19,688
Tell me about your farm, Mr. O'Neill.

1303
01:43:19,897 --> 01:43:23,692
It's a bit rough and ready at the
moment. Hasn't been worked in years.

1304
01:43:23,776 --> 01:43:25,694
But with some hard work...

1305
01:43:25,778 --> 01:43:29,156
And with your bad back, you
would expect Dane to help.

1306
01:43:30,157 --> 01:43:33,452
Of course. I couldn't
manage the place on my own.

1307
01:43:34,411 --> 01:43:36,080
And his schooling?

1308
01:43:36,747 --> 01:43:39,291
There's a good school 20 miles away.

1309
01:43:39,917 --> 01:43:41,502
How would he get there?

1310
01:43:41,585 --> 01:43:44,505
He'd walk part of the
way and catch the bus.

1311
01:43:44,713 --> 01:43:46,924
-How far?
-Four miles.

1312
01:43:47,675 --> 01:43:49,218
There and back?

1313
01:43:51,512 --> 01:43:53,681
So you would expect the boy...

1314
01:43:53,764 --> 01:43:56,600
to walk eight miles a day...

1315
01:43:56,976 --> 01:44:00,271
do his schoolwork, do his
homework, and help you on the farm?

1316
01:44:00,354 --> 01:44:03,566
It would be tough. But
all country boys do it.

1317
01:44:04,275 --> 01:44:07,611
Most country boys have a
mother to take care of them.

1318
01:44:08,487 --> 01:44:11,532
-Who would do the cooking?
-Me.

1319
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:14,785
-And the washing?
-Me...

1320
01:44:15,369 --> 01:44:17,246
till he was old enough.

1321
01:44:17,329 --> 01:44:19,957
And who would take care
of him if he got sick?

1322
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:22,793
Me.

1323
01:44:22,876 --> 01:44:24,753
As well as managing the farm.

1324
01:44:24,837 --> 01:44:27,047
You'd be a very busy
man, Mr. O'Neill.

1325
01:44:34,555 --> 01:44:38,058
I think Mr. O'Neill
cooked his goose today.

1326
01:44:38,809 --> 01:44:41,645
He sounded like he only
wants Dane for child labor.

1327
01:44:41,729 --> 01:44:43,814
-More like a slave.
-Indeed.

1328
01:44:43,897 --> 01:44:46,275
Can I have a word, Archbishop?

1329
01:44:46,358 --> 01:44:48,027
Excuse us, please.

1330
01:44:50,237 --> 01:44:51,780
It isn't over yet.

1331
01:44:51,864 --> 01:44:54,408
You heard what Mr. Gough
said. You heard Luke.

1332
01:44:54,491 --> 01:44:58,162
I don't think it's that simple. I
don't know what the judge will say.

1333
01:44:58,245 --> 01:45:00,956
He's going to give
Dane to me. He must.

1334
01:45:01,332 --> 01:45:03,000
Why take the risk?

1335
01:45:03,542 --> 01:45:05,586
Why not end it now? Tell the truth.

1336
01:45:05,669 --> 01:45:08,672
Tell someone Luke
isn't Dane's father.

1337
01:45:09,798 --> 01:45:11,759
Because there's no need.

1338
01:45:12,176 --> 01:45:14,428
All this time, I wanted
someone to understand...

1339
01:45:14,511 --> 01:45:16,013
what my life with Luke was like.

1340
01:45:16,096 --> 01:45:17,473
You never believed me.

1341
01:45:19,266 --> 01:45:21,185
Now everyone will know.

1342
01:45:25,147 --> 01:45:27,858
The judge wants to
put you on the stand.

1343
01:45:28,692 --> 01:45:30,944
-Why?
-It's this Catholic thing.

1344
01:45:31,028 --> 01:45:34,114
Shook him rigid when he heard
about Dane wanting to be a priest.

1345
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:35,741
Why, it shook me, too.

1346
01:45:35,824 --> 01:45:40,287
His Honor's real old-time
Protestant. He can't stand micks.

1347
01:45:41,872 --> 01:45:44,208
Begging your pardon, Archbishop.

1348
01:45:46,335 --> 01:45:48,545
Come on, Justine, we're going home.

1349
01:46:13,237 --> 01:46:14,655
Where's Justine?

1350
01:46:14,738 --> 01:46:16,490
She's not well. She's
not coming today.

1351
01:46:16,573 --> 01:46:18,909
But the judge might want
to ask her some questions.

1352
01:46:18,992 --> 01:46:20,410
She's sick.

1353
01:46:21,745 --> 01:46:26,208
In any case, I think it might be
better if the judge doesn't talk to her.

1354
01:47:20,846 --> 01:47:25,225
What is your relationship
with Mrs. O'Neill, Archbishop?

1355
01:47:25,309 --> 01:47:27,769
I致e known Mrs. O'Neill
since she was very young.

1356
01:47:27,853 --> 01:47:30,272
Since she first came
here many years ago.

1357
01:47:30,355 --> 01:47:32,858
I advise her on religious matters.

1358
01:47:32,941 --> 01:47:35,861
And what is your
relationship with Drogheda?

1359
01:47:35,944 --> 01:47:39,865
The Church owns Drogheda. The
Clearys manage it for the Church.

1360
01:47:40,157 --> 01:47:43,160
The Catholic Church
owns all of Drogheda?

1361
01:47:43,368 --> 01:47:45,370
-Yes.
-How so?

1362
01:47:45,912 --> 01:47:49,416
The property was left to the
Church by Mary Carson, who owned it.

1363
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:51,001
Left to you.

1364
01:47:51,126 --> 01:47:53,629
What does Mr. O'Neill mean by that?

1365
01:47:54,212 --> 01:47:58,008
The Archbishop was Mary Carson's
religious advisor as well.

1366
01:47:58,133 --> 01:48:00,135
She left the property
to the Church...

1367
01:48:00,218 --> 01:48:04,556
so long as the worth and ability of
Ralph de Bricassart is appreciated.

1368
01:48:05,557 --> 01:48:09,269
So, you would have a
considerable personal interest...

1369
01:48:10,187 --> 01:48:12,314
in what happens at Drogheda?

1370
01:48:12,481 --> 01:48:16,109
Not in the day-to-day running of the
place. The Clearys do that very well.

1371
01:48:16,193 --> 01:48:18,236
But we do have an
interest, of course.

1372
01:48:18,403 --> 01:48:21,239
It's more than an interest.
You're always poking your nose in.

1373
01:48:21,323 --> 01:48:24,242
Mr. O'Neill. Please.

1374
01:48:29,247 --> 01:48:31,875
Having control of such
an enormous property...

1375
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:34,252
must be helpful to your career.

1376
01:48:34,336 --> 01:48:36,963
Being a priest is not
a career, Your Honor.

1377
01:48:37,047 --> 01:48:40,759
Nevertheless, the Church
continues to appreciate...

1378
01:48:40,842 --> 01:48:42,969
your worth and ability.

1379
01:48:43,845 --> 01:48:46,014
I hope I致e been of service.

1380
01:48:47,766 --> 01:48:50,644
What is your Church's
position regarding...

1381
01:48:51,311 --> 01:48:53,647
Mr. and Mrs. O'Neill's marriage?

1382
01:48:54,731 --> 01:48:58,860
It is the position of the Church
that their marriage is sacrosanct.

1383
01:48:58,944 --> 01:49:02,948
So you would advise Mrs. O'Neill
that her place is with her husband?

1384
01:49:03,615 --> 01:49:04,699
Yes.

1385
01:49:04,825 --> 01:49:08,328
-And she chooses to ignore you?
-I only advise.

1386
01:49:08,954 --> 01:49:12,165
And do you also advise
Dane on religious matters?

1387
01:49:12,249 --> 01:49:14,835
I hardly know Dane. I致e spent
very little time with him.

1388
01:49:14,918 --> 01:49:17,796
But you have spoken
about religion with him?

1389
01:49:17,879 --> 01:49:19,923
-Briefly, yes-- -Do
you see what I mean?

1390
01:49:20,006 --> 01:49:21,758
The micks have really
got their claws--

1391
01:49:21,842 --> 01:49:25,804
Mr. O'Neill, I appreciate that
you're representing yourself.

1392
01:49:30,642 --> 01:49:34,187
So you are aware of Dane's
desire to become a priest?

1393
01:49:34,312 --> 01:49:35,397
Yes.

1394
01:49:35,522 --> 01:49:38,900
And have you tried to discourage him?

1395
01:49:39,651 --> 01:49:41,903
I have tried to point
out the disadvantages...

1396
01:49:41,987 --> 01:49:44,072
the sacrifices he must make.

1397
01:49:44,155 --> 01:49:48,159
So you have, in effect, advised
him on religious matters?

1398
01:49:48,869 --> 01:49:52,122
-I have briefly discussed God with him.
-See what I mean?

1399
01:49:54,416 --> 01:49:58,795
Do you have an attitude to
Dane's desire to become a priest?

1400
01:49:59,337 --> 01:50:00,672
Of course.

1401
01:50:01,631 --> 01:50:04,551
Are you able to share
that attitude with us?

1402
01:50:08,221 --> 01:50:11,349
A calling to the priesthood
is a sacred thing.

1403
01:50:13,018 --> 01:50:16,855
lf it's a true vocation, it's
the greatest gift I can imagine.

1404
01:50:20,233 --> 01:50:21,860
Even at his age?

1405
01:50:21,985 --> 01:50:23,737
He is very young...

1406
01:50:24,696 --> 01:50:27,532
but there have been
saints as young as he.

1407
01:50:28,116 --> 01:50:30,368
There have indeed, Archbishop.

1408
01:50:32,871 --> 01:50:35,040
That will be all. Thank you.

1409
01:50:56,227 --> 01:50:58,563
I値l go and see how Justine is.

1410
01:51:02,233 --> 01:51:05,820
I知 sorry, Meggie. It was an
unfortunate line of questioning.

1411
01:51:05,904 --> 01:51:08,365
You've broken all your other vows.

1412
01:51:09,115 --> 01:51:11,910
Why do you have to be
honest at my expense?

1413
01:51:11,993 --> 01:51:14,079
Because this is too important.

1414
01:51:14,162 --> 01:51:16,998
More important than
Dane coming back to me?

1415
01:51:17,165 --> 01:51:20,043
You heard the judge. You know
what he thinks about Catholics.

1416
01:51:20,126 --> 01:51:22,879
I couldn't lie. I
couldn't lie about Dane.

1417
01:51:22,962 --> 01:51:25,382
He's not going to become a priest.

1418
01:51:25,799 --> 01:51:28,426
He's a little boy growing up
here, miles from anywhere...

1419
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:30,470
and the Church is magical to him.

1420
01:51:30,553 --> 01:51:33,014
God's his friend, someone
to talk to when he's lonely.

1421
01:51:33,098 --> 01:51:34,516
But he'll grow out of it.

1422
01:51:34,599 --> 01:51:37,477
He'll want to get
married and have children.

1423
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,104
I couldn't lie.

1424
01:51:39,854 --> 01:51:41,147
Damn you.

1425
01:52:02,836 --> 01:52:07,090
There you are, at last. I致e got
dinner on and a nice cup of tea.

1426
01:52:07,173 --> 01:52:09,759
Mrs. Smith, where's Justine?
She's not in her room.

1427
01:52:09,843 --> 01:52:13,388
No? She took off early this
morning, just after you left.

1428
01:52:14,514 --> 01:52:17,142
-Didn't you know?
-No, we didn't know.

1429
01:52:17,267 --> 01:52:19,686
But where the devil could she be?

1430
01:52:28,778 --> 01:52:31,197
It went very well today, Dane.

1431
01:52:32,365 --> 01:52:36,202
-The judge doesn't like Catholics,
does he? -Not much.

1432
01:52:37,328 --> 01:52:38,621
Nor do l.

1433
01:52:39,747 --> 01:52:43,543
-Then why do you love me?
-Because you're my son.

1434
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:46,796
And I壇 love you no matter what.

1435
01:52:50,133 --> 01:52:52,218
Looks like we got visitors.

1436
01:53:02,395 --> 01:53:04,689
-Justine!
-Dane!

1437
01:53:08,776 --> 01:53:11,070
Hello, Dad. I致e got dinner ready.

1438
01:53:11,154 --> 01:53:14,324
What are you doing here? Stupid.
You're gonna ruin everything.

1439
01:53:14,407 --> 01:53:17,493
No, it's all right. I知
gonna make it all right.

1440
01:53:18,286 --> 01:53:19,704
You'll see.

1441
01:53:23,917 --> 01:53:27,420
Yeah, well, maybe you
can help after all.

1442
01:53:33,259 --> 01:53:34,636
That's a young girl.

1443
01:53:35,929 --> 01:53:37,805
Now, what's for supper?

1444
01:53:43,770 --> 01:53:46,814
Why did you run away
from home, Justine?

1445
01:53:47,899 --> 01:53:50,485
Because I wanted to be with my daddy.

1446
01:53:51,569 --> 01:53:54,072
-Don't you love your mommy?
-No.

1447
01:53:54,948 --> 01:53:57,950
She's never loved me.
She's never cared about me.

1448
01:53:58,034 --> 01:54:01,788
-Never been interested in what I wanted.
-That is not true.

1449
01:54:02,038 --> 01:54:04,040
Drogheda doesn't feel like home.

1450
01:54:04,123 --> 01:54:06,876
I wanted a proper
home, a proper family.

1451
01:54:07,043 --> 01:54:11,631
So you were happy when your
father came to Drogheda?

1452
01:54:12,173 --> 01:54:15,176
Yes. He was wonderful to us.

1453
01:54:15,301 --> 01:54:16,636
Even Mom was happy...

1454
01:54:17,845 --> 01:54:19,681
till he showed up.

1455
01:54:20,306 --> 01:54:22,058
Then Mom changed.

1456
01:54:22,934 --> 01:54:25,728
She didn't seem to care
about Daddy anymore.

1457
01:54:25,812 --> 01:54:27,855
She wanted to be with the priest.

1458
01:54:27,939 --> 01:54:31,901
She spent all her time with him,
whispering to him, hugging him.

1459
01:54:32,276 --> 01:54:34,654
She started having rows with Dad.

1460
01:54:35,113 --> 01:54:38,116
And then she said we weren't
gonna move to the farm.

1461
01:54:38,199 --> 01:54:40,910
We had to stay at
Drogheda without Dad.

1462
01:54:40,993 --> 01:54:44,455
I didn't want that. I just
want to be with my dad.

1463
01:54:46,249 --> 01:54:49,168
I don't understand why
she doesn't love him.

1464
01:54:49,919 --> 01:54:51,003
I do.

1465
01:54:53,047 --> 01:54:55,091
Tell me, Justine...

1466
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:58,928
how do you feel about your religion?

1467
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:05,977
I don't have a religion. I used
to be Catholic. Not anymore.

1468
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:09,439
I can't stand it now. They're
always ramming it down my throat.

1469
01:55:09,522 --> 01:55:11,524
Mom, the nuns, and now him.

1470
01:55:11,607 --> 01:55:14,068
-That is not true!
-It's worse for Dane.

1471
01:55:14,152 --> 01:55:16,737
-They're trying to force him to be
a priest. -Why do you say this?

1472
01:55:16,821 --> 01:55:19,115
-He doesn't want to be...
-You see what I mean?

1473
01:55:19,198 --> 01:55:23,286
It's not true, Justine. You're
lying! Why are you lying?

1474
01:55:23,369 --> 01:55:24,495
That's gone far enough!

1475
01:55:26,539 --> 01:55:30,293
All his life he has never had a
father. I brought him up on his own.

1476
01:55:30,376 --> 01:55:32,587
I never heard from
Luke, from my husband.

1477
01:55:34,172 --> 01:55:36,966
But Dane has been given
love and affection...

1478
01:55:37,049 --> 01:55:39,677
and my two brothers have
been like a father to him.

1479
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,470
For nine years...

1480
01:55:42,054 --> 01:55:44,182
For nine years he ignored Dane...

1481
01:55:44,265 --> 01:55:46,726
just as he completely
ignored Justine.

1482
01:55:46,809 --> 01:55:48,227
You walked out on me, remember?

1483
01:55:48,311 --> 01:55:50,855
-Mr. O'Neill. -I never
even knew that I had--

1484
01:55:50,938 --> 01:55:52,982
I will not warn you again.

1485
01:55:58,946 --> 01:56:00,865
The marriage was over.

1486
01:56:01,282 --> 01:56:03,951
Be that as it may,
do you not think...

1487
01:56:04,577 --> 01:56:07,872
that a man has the right
to know that he has a son?

1488
01:56:08,122 --> 01:56:12,001
Would you tell His Honor why you
won't go back to your husband?

1489
01:56:13,085 --> 01:56:15,504
Because he was violent toward me.

1490
01:56:16,797 --> 01:56:19,926
Because of him, I lost
the child I was carrying.

1491
01:56:20,051 --> 01:56:22,637
And I won't be able to have any more.

1492
01:56:24,096 --> 01:56:27,642
-Is this child Mr. O'Neill's child?
-Of course.

1493
01:56:29,810 --> 01:56:32,480
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

1494
01:56:34,482 --> 01:56:38,319
-Would you like a little break,
Mrs. O'Neill? -No, thank you.

1495
01:56:40,237 --> 01:56:42,949
Mr. O'Neill, do you
have any questions?

1496
01:56:47,995 --> 01:56:49,830
Why did you leave me?

1497
01:56:51,415 --> 01:56:54,877
Because you neglected me and
you ignored your children.

1498
01:56:55,169 --> 01:56:58,339
Dane wasn't even born
when you walked out on me.

1499
01:56:58,464 --> 01:57:01,759
Justine was. You didn't
even want to see her.

1500
01:57:01,842 --> 01:57:06,138
She was two years old before
you even set eyes on her.

1501
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:08,474
Because I was so busy working.

1502
01:57:08,557 --> 01:57:12,603
As Your Honor is very well
aware, this is not a divorce case.

1503
01:57:12,812 --> 01:57:14,730
Quite right, Mr. Gough.

1504
01:57:15,523 --> 01:57:19,276
I don't see any value in going back
over your marriage, Mr. O'Neill.

1505
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:22,279
We are agreed that there is
an irreconcilable breakdown.

1506
01:57:22,363 --> 01:57:23,656
I知 not.

1507
01:57:24,031 --> 01:57:26,867
I loved my wife and
my child, my children.

1508
01:57:27,535 --> 01:57:32,081
And I took my duty as a husband
and provider very seriously.

1509
01:57:32,331 --> 01:57:34,250
I tried to look after their future...

1510
01:57:34,333 --> 01:57:36,961
and I will not have
my boy become a priest!

1511
01:57:37,044 --> 01:57:38,462
You weren't even there!

1512
01:57:38,546 --> 01:57:41,340
All these years you haven't
cared what your son wanted to be.

1513
01:57:41,424 --> 01:57:44,468
-Why do you care now?
-I didn't know I had a son.

1514
01:57:44,552 --> 01:57:45,803
He lied to me.

1515
01:57:45,886 --> 01:57:49,473
He came back after all those
years and he said he wanted me.

1516
01:57:49,557 --> 01:57:53,060
He didn't want me.
All he wanted was Dane.

1517
01:57:53,728 --> 01:57:56,147
He lied to me and then he hit me.

1518
01:57:58,065 --> 01:58:01,318
What happened right before
I hit you? Right before?

1519
01:58:01,736 --> 01:58:03,779
-We had an argument.
-Why?

1520
01:58:04,739 --> 01:58:06,907
Because I wouldn't move to the farm.

1521
01:58:06,991 --> 01:58:09,160
-And what did you
do? -Nothing. l--

1522
01:58:09,243 --> 01:58:11,745
No. What did you do?

1523
01:58:11,954 --> 01:58:14,331
-I believe I tried to hit you.
-Mr. O'Neill.

1524
01:58:14,415 --> 01:58:15,541
She
made me--

1525
01:58:15,624 --> 01:58:18,627
I will not allow that
behavior in this court!

1526
01:58:18,919 --> 01:58:22,173
Violence is not an answer
to your marital problems.

1527
01:58:22,256 --> 01:58:25,634
There is nothing that Mrs.
O'Neill could have done...

1528
01:58:25,718 --> 01:58:28,429
that would justify
what you did to her.

1529
01:58:29,096 --> 01:58:33,100
I warn you, outbursts of this
kind do nothing to help your case.

1530
01:58:34,935 --> 01:58:37,104
Now, if you have any
further questions...

1531
01:58:37,188 --> 01:58:39,356
you'll ask them in
a gentlemanly manner.

1532
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,442
Otherwise, sit down.

1533
01:58:48,991 --> 01:58:50,451
No, I知 through.

1534
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,960
I am extremely sorry...

1535
01:59:01,378 --> 01:59:04,590
for the loss that you have
suffered, Mrs. O'Neill.

1536
01:59:04,673 --> 01:59:06,800
That will be all. Thank you.

1537
01:59:07,968 --> 01:59:09,303
Thank you.

1538
01:59:24,318 --> 01:59:25,945
I find myself...

1539
01:59:27,029 --> 01:59:29,573
in an extremely difficult position.

1540
01:59:31,158 --> 01:59:34,662
The only way I can
see to resolve it...

1541
01:59:35,871 --> 01:59:40,042
is to ask Dane some
questions in private.

1542
01:59:47,925 --> 01:59:50,678
Mr. O'Neill, do you
have any objection?

1543
01:59:52,096 --> 01:59:53,597
No, Your Honor.

1544
01:59:53,681 --> 01:59:55,849
-Mrs. O'Neill?
-No.

1545
02:00:02,314 --> 02:00:05,192
-Do you love your mother, Dane?
-Very much.

1546
02:00:06,068 --> 02:00:07,903
And do you love your father?

1547
02:00:08,112 --> 02:00:10,030
I don't know him very well.

1548
02:00:10,864 --> 02:00:13,033
I love the idea of having a father.

1549
02:00:13,242 --> 02:00:15,077
Do you like living with him?

1550
02:00:15,202 --> 02:00:18,080
Sort of. He's very good to me, but...

1551
02:00:18,622 --> 02:00:20,165
I miss my mom.

1552
02:00:21,917 --> 02:00:23,252
lf you could choose...

1553
02:00:23,919 --> 02:00:27,589
who would you rather live with,
your mother or your father?

1554
02:00:29,758 --> 02:00:32,928
lf I say Dad, then
my mom would be upset.

1555
02:00:33,429 --> 02:00:36,223
And if I say Mom, then
my dad would be cross.

1556
02:00:37,099 --> 02:00:39,685
I suppose that's why
you've got to choose.

1557
02:00:41,437 --> 02:00:43,522
Can't you give me any idea?

1558
02:00:46,275 --> 02:00:48,819
My dad isn't too keen
on my being Catholic...

1559
02:00:49,319 --> 02:00:52,489
so it would be better
if I lived with my mom.

1560
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:59,246
We're going to lose him.
You know that, don't you?

1561
02:01:00,539 --> 02:01:03,083
And it's so easy. You only
have to tell the truth.

1562
02:01:03,167 --> 02:01:05,169
I can't do that to Ralph.

1563
02:01:05,627 --> 02:01:08,005
You love him so much, you'd
risk everything for him?

1564
02:01:08,088 --> 02:01:10,215
Don't make it worse for me.

1565
02:01:10,299 --> 02:01:13,385
He is not going to give
Dane to Luke. He can't.

1566
02:01:14,428 --> 02:01:15,804
lf he does?

1567
02:01:17,639 --> 02:01:20,642
I don't know. I don't
know anything anymore.

1568
02:01:21,727 --> 02:01:24,563
I watch Dane with Luke,
and I see that he's happy.

1569
02:01:24,646 --> 02:01:27,399
They say he needs a father more
than anything in the world...

1570
02:01:27,483 --> 02:01:29,526
and I wonder if Luke isn't right.

1571
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:32,070
Maybe he does need a stronger
guiding hand than mine...

1572
02:01:32,154 --> 02:01:34,615
because if I知 not very careful...

1573
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:38,327
I知 going to lose Dane, no
matter what the judge decides...

1574
02:01:38,994 --> 02:01:41,455
to Luke or to God.

1575
02:01:47,085 --> 02:01:49,671
Dane, what does the Pope mean to you?

1576
02:01:50,756 --> 02:01:54,968
He's the head of the Church, and
the representative of God on Earth.

1577
02:01:55,928 --> 02:01:59,556
-Do you believe everything he says?
-Yes. He's infallible.

1578
02:01:59,973 --> 02:02:01,767
He speaks for God.

1579
02:02:02,351 --> 02:02:06,230
-And you love your king and country?
-Yes.

1580
02:02:07,022 --> 02:02:10,651
Now, if your king were to
tell you to do something...

1581
02:02:11,151 --> 02:02:13,612
to fight for your country...

1582
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:17,533
and the Pope wanted you
to do something else...

1583
02:02:18,367 --> 02:02:20,202
who would you believe?

1584
02:02:23,247 --> 02:02:26,208
Now, you promised to
tell me the truth, Dane.

1585
02:02:26,792 --> 02:02:30,545
Who would you obey? Your
king and country, or the Pope?

1586
02:02:33,590 --> 02:02:34,675
God.

1587
02:02:41,556 --> 02:02:45,435
This has not been an
easy decision for me.

1588
02:02:47,229 --> 02:02:49,273
As a general rule...

1589
02:02:49,523 --> 02:02:52,317
I believe that the best home life...

1590
02:02:52,609 --> 02:02:55,904
for any child of separated parents...

1591
02:02:56,446 --> 02:02:58,907
is with the mother.

1592
02:02:59,950 --> 02:03:01,243
However...

1593
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:04,830
this may not be true in Dane's case.

1594
02:03:06,123 --> 02:03:09,126
It is unfortunate that the
boy has been brought up...

1595
02:03:09,209 --> 02:03:10,836
in such a hotbed of Popery.

1596
02:03:10,919 --> 02:03:11,962
Your Honor.

1597
02:03:12,045 --> 02:03:14,339
I mean no personal
disrespect, Archbishop...

1598
02:03:14,423 --> 02:03:16,341
but I知 sure you'll agree...

1599
02:03:16,425 --> 02:03:19,219
that Dane has an obsession
with his religion.

1600
02:03:19,761 --> 02:03:22,723
I think Dane is a very
sincere young man, Your Honor.

1601
02:03:22,806 --> 02:03:24,766
Yes. So do l.

1602
02:03:25,434 --> 02:03:27,853
But what Mrs. O'Neill
cannot provide...

1603
02:03:27,936 --> 02:03:30,147
and what Dane so clearly needs...

1604
02:03:30,230 --> 02:03:33,233
is the strong, guiding
hand of a father.

1605
02:03:34,818 --> 02:03:37,195
Dane's obsession, in my mind...

1606
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:39,573
is unhealthy in one so young.

1607
02:03:39,781 --> 02:03:43,577
I think we need to undo some of
the damage that has been done.

1608
02:03:44,911 --> 02:03:49,791
But I don't know that Mr. O'Neill
can provide properly for the boy.

1609
02:03:50,667 --> 02:03:54,546
I believe that Dane's best
interests are probably served...

1610
02:03:54,629 --> 02:03:57,382
by sending him to a foster
home for a period of time...

1611
02:03:57,466 --> 02:04:00,510
-No! Mommy!
-...by making him a ward of the court.

1612
02:04:00,594 --> 02:04:02,804
No, please. Please, no.

1613
02:04:03,722 --> 02:04:05,015
Mrs. O'Neill.

1614
02:04:05,098 --> 02:04:08,393
-No, Mommy, don't let them take me.
-I知 attempting to be fair.

1615
02:04:08,477 --> 02:04:12,314
Is there anything you wish to
say, that might change my mind?

1616
02:04:14,191 --> 02:04:15,484
No, l...

1617
02:04:16,777 --> 02:04:18,028
Tell him.

1618
02:04:18,779 --> 02:04:23,074
Only that I知 his mother.

1619
02:04:23,158 --> 02:04:26,620
I gave birth to him, I致e
loved him all his life.

1620
02:04:26,953 --> 02:04:30,040
I know him better than
anyone else in the world.

1621
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:37,380
You say that he has had too
much religious influence.

1622
02:04:37,464 --> 02:04:40,217
Well, perhaps, but
it's not been unkind.

1623
02:04:40,342 --> 02:04:43,845
Dane's been free to decide
what he believes for himself.

1624
02:04:44,596 --> 02:04:48,308
None of us wants him to become
a priest. Why would I want that?

1625
02:04:48,391 --> 02:04:50,644
I want him to grow up
strong and healthy...

1626
02:04:50,727 --> 02:04:53,146
to find a wife and have
children of his own...

1627
02:04:53,230 --> 02:04:56,733
if only, selfishly, that I
might have some grandchildren.

1628
02:05:00,529 --> 02:05:03,448
But if his vocation is
to become a priest...

1629
02:05:04,741 --> 02:05:07,661
then none of us have the right
to take that away from him.

1630
02:05:07,744 --> 02:05:10,247
Not Luke, not you, not l.

1631
02:05:10,372 --> 02:05:11,873
Not anyone.

1632
02:05:13,625 --> 02:05:18,547
Please, you can't send him to strangers
who don't know him, who don't love him.

1633
02:05:19,214 --> 02:05:20,382
Please.

1634
02:05:21,675 --> 02:05:25,637
Believe me, Mrs. O'Neill, I think
you've done a sterling job...

1635
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:27,847
under very difficult circumstances.

1636
02:05:27,931 --> 02:05:30,100
But before the boy is much older...

1637
02:05:30,183 --> 02:05:33,436
I believe he needs a sense
of balance in his life.

1638
02:05:40,944 --> 02:05:42,279
Very well.

1639
02:05:43,905 --> 02:05:47,200
lf you won't let me have
him, then give him to Luke.

1640
02:05:51,204 --> 02:05:53,456
At least they know each other.

1641
02:06:03,967 --> 02:06:05,302
Very well.

1642
02:06:07,637 --> 02:06:11,850
I award custody of the
boy, Dane O'Neill...

1643
02:06:12,142 --> 02:06:13,393
to his father.

1644
02:06:13,476 --> 02:06:14,811
No, you can't do that.

1645
02:06:14,894 --> 02:06:16,521
-Mom.
-Because...

1646
02:06:23,737 --> 02:06:28,450
Because Dane is my only grandson,
perhaps the only grandson I値l ever have.

1647
02:06:28,533 --> 02:06:31,536
Please don't take away
my hope for the future.

1648
02:06:32,662 --> 02:06:36,166
I am trying to give you hope
for the future, Mrs. Cleary.

1649
02:06:42,547 --> 02:06:43,965
Mr. O'Neill.

1650
02:06:47,719 --> 02:06:49,763
Do not treat this lightly.

1651
02:06:50,346 --> 02:06:54,142
Do not abuse the boy.
Children are not property...

1652
02:06:54,225 --> 02:06:57,395
a way of getting free
labor for your farm.

1653
02:06:57,604 --> 02:07:00,106
I will want to see
Dane's school report...

1654
02:07:00,315 --> 02:07:04,360
and I will want to be certain that
you are caring for him properly...

1655
02:07:04,652 --> 02:07:07,363
before I let this
arrangement continue.

1656
02:07:10,158 --> 02:07:12,911
But me, what about me?

1657
02:07:13,828 --> 02:07:16,581
Your case is not in
my purview, young lady.

1658
02:07:17,415 --> 02:07:21,336
But it's not fair. I
want to be with my daddy.

1659
02:07:30,386 --> 02:07:32,388
This court is adjourned.

1660
02:07:37,268 --> 02:07:41,314
-I will come and see you whenever I can.
-But why does it have to be like this?

1661
02:07:41,397 --> 02:07:44,067
-Why can't we all be together?
-Dane, you know why.

1662
02:07:44,150 --> 02:07:45,693
You were so brave in court.

1663
02:07:45,777 --> 02:07:48,655
Why won't you come and live
with Dad? You're married to him.

1664
02:07:48,738 --> 02:07:50,281
I can't. I just can't.

1665
02:07:50,365 --> 02:07:53,243
-Why? Don't you love me?
-With all my heart.

1666
02:07:53,326 --> 02:07:54,494
Then why?

1667
02:07:54,577 --> 02:07:59,082
-Please don't cry, please.
-We have to go. It's a long way.

1668
02:07:59,707 --> 02:08:01,918
You have to go with Daddy now.

1669
02:08:02,210 --> 02:08:05,922
But be brave, and I will come
and see you as soon as I can.

1670
02:08:06,422 --> 02:08:08,967
-Come on.
-I don't want you. I want my mommy.

1671
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:11,594
It's a bit late for that now, sport.

1672
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:15,723
Didn't have to be like this.
It could have been so easy.

1673
02:08:16,432 --> 02:08:17,767
Come on.

1674
02:08:40,582 --> 02:08:44,127
-We should get you home.
-I want my son back.

1675
02:08:44,335 --> 02:08:47,880
God has had enough from me.
Make him give me my son back.

1676
02:09:39,015 --> 02:09:40,641
Hello, everybody.

1677
02:09:42,727 --> 02:09:43,895
Jack.

1678
02:09:46,022 --> 02:09:48,608
-Welcome home.
-Good to see you.

1679
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:50,360
Put a smile on your face, girl.

1680
02:09:50,443 --> 02:09:53,404
They only shot off my privates.
It's not the end of the world.

1681
02:09:54,113 --> 02:09:56,240
Good to see you, everybody.

1682
02:10:10,755 --> 02:10:15,301
-Luke's determined to keep the boy, then?
-And he has the court on his side.

1683
02:10:18,387 --> 02:10:21,307
You done well with the place,
Meggie. Can't have been easy.

1684
02:10:21,390 --> 02:10:22,725
It wasn't.

1685
02:10:23,601 --> 02:10:26,145
It is wonderful to have you
back to take charge again.

1686
02:10:26,229 --> 02:10:28,856
I壇 have come back sooner if
I壇 known how bad things are.

1687
02:10:28,940 --> 02:10:32,026
-How long since you've had rain?
-Why didn't you come back sooner?

1688
02:10:32,110 --> 02:10:34,821
I phoned the hospital. You
were discharged last week.

1689
02:10:34,904 --> 02:10:36,906
I was expecting you then.

1690
02:10:38,116 --> 02:10:39,742
Where did you go?

1691
02:10:40,952 --> 02:10:43,663
I went to Melbourne.
Went to see Frank.

1692
02:10:44,622 --> 02:10:47,083
Look, Mom, we all know
he's in for murder.

1693
02:10:47,166 --> 02:10:50,128
But he's my brother,
and I wanted to see him.

1694
02:10:52,463 --> 02:10:53,840
How is he?

1695
02:10:54,924 --> 02:10:57,218
He's very sick. It's pneumonia.

1696
02:10:58,928 --> 02:11:02,265
It's bad news, Mom. The
thing is, he might not live.

1697
02:11:16,654 --> 02:11:18,990
Looks like rain in those clouds.

1698
02:11:22,326 --> 02:11:25,663
We haven't had rain here
for two years. We need rain.

1699
02:11:30,835 --> 02:11:32,336
Somebody should've told me.

1700
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:35,089
I am his mother. I
have a right to know.

1701
02:11:59,697 --> 02:12:02,366
Almost everyone I
love is buried here.

1702
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:04,660
Dane isn't dead, Meggie.

1703
02:12:04,910 --> 02:12:08,831
A terrible thing has happened,
but it's not the end of the world.

1704
02:12:08,914 --> 02:12:11,417
You'll still see Dane.
You're still his mother.

1705
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:13,794
And in a few years, the
court order will expire...

1706
02:12:13,878 --> 02:12:15,713
and then you can have
him with you again.

1707
02:12:15,796 --> 02:12:20,134
But you can't stop living until then.
You have to go on and make the best of it.

1708
02:12:20,551 --> 02:12:23,554
You can't know what it means
to a mother to lose a son.

1709
02:12:23,638 --> 02:12:25,097
Look at Mom.

1710
02:12:25,348 --> 02:12:27,058
She went on living.

1711
02:12:27,141 --> 02:12:30,102
She didn't give up just because
her son Frank went to jail...

1712
02:12:30,186 --> 02:12:31,854
and she won't now.

1713
02:12:32,813 --> 02:12:34,315
Even if Dane were dead...

1714
02:12:34,398 --> 02:12:37,234
even if some terrible
accident had happened...

1715
02:12:37,443 --> 02:12:39,820
you'd grieve, but
you don't stop living.

1716
02:12:39,904 --> 02:12:41,822
Is that what you told
the mothers in Rome...

1717
02:12:41,906 --> 02:12:43,366
who lost their sons fighting?

1718
02:12:43,449 --> 02:12:47,286
Did you tell them to be happy
because their sons are with God?

1719
02:12:57,630 --> 02:13:00,466
At some point in the
war, I lost my faith.

1720
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:05,846
In all that suffering, I
couldn't see God's purpose.

1721
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:09,517
I couldn't understand how he
could let such evil happen.

1722
02:13:11,519 --> 02:13:12,812
I began to doubt.

1723
02:13:12,895 --> 02:13:16,148
My superiors sent me here
to work for the refugees.

1724
02:13:17,650 --> 02:13:19,276
But in the end...

1725
02:13:21,946 --> 02:13:23,531
I had to see you.

1726
02:13:26,700 --> 02:13:30,663
-I thought perhaps you might
still love me. -Perhaps?

1727
02:13:30,788 --> 02:13:33,415
I thought perhaps you
might still want me.

1728
02:13:33,499 --> 02:13:36,168
You might want to
make a life with me.

1729
02:13:36,585 --> 02:13:39,588
-You never told me this.
-You were going back to Luke.

1730
02:13:39,672 --> 02:13:42,967
-You were going to have his child.
-Do you think that mattered to me?

1731
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:46,470
Do you think I wasn't longing
to hear you say those words?

1732
02:13:46,554 --> 02:13:49,140
Perhaps, if you'd told me...

1733
02:13:50,057 --> 02:13:51,392
none of this would've happened.

1734
02:13:51,517 --> 02:13:55,104
Perhaps, if you'd been honest, I壇
have told Luke to leave long before.

1735
02:13:56,147 --> 02:13:59,525
Perhaps, if you hadn't lied to
me, I would still have my son.

1736
02:13:59,608 --> 02:14:02,111
-I didn't lie to you.
-You didn't tell me the truth.

1737
02:14:02,194 --> 02:14:04,864
Meggie, my list of
sins is long enough.

1738
02:14:05,364 --> 02:14:07,867
Besides, I had nothing to offer you.

1739
02:14:08,534 --> 02:14:10,786
You don't think love is enough?

1740
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:15,291
Ten years, Meggie. How could
I be sure you still loved me?

1741
02:14:15,374 --> 02:14:17,167
How could you not be?

1742
02:14:22,631 --> 02:14:25,301
All my life I致e loved you.

1743
02:14:25,426 --> 02:14:27,928
Sometimes I hated God
because he took you from me...

1744
02:14:28,012 --> 02:14:30,806
but always my love
for you was stronger.

1745
02:14:31,849 --> 02:14:33,434
Suddenly, I知 not so sure.

1746
02:14:56,916 --> 02:14:59,376
So are you going to
tell me what's wrong?

1747
02:15:01,253 --> 02:15:03,464
Why won't you let me see Mom?

1748
02:15:03,589 --> 02:15:06,008
You gotta get used to
this situation, Dane...

1749
02:15:06,091 --> 02:15:08,552
and I don't want her upsetting you.

1750
02:15:08,636 --> 02:15:11,221
-But she's my mom.
-And I知 your dad.

1751
02:15:11,305 --> 02:15:13,932
And you'll do as I
say. Now come down.

1752
02:15:16,644 --> 02:15:20,981
All right. You can stay up there all
night, if that's what you bloody well want.

1753
02:15:21,106 --> 02:15:24,526
But there's a storm coming, so
if you don't want to get wet...

1754
02:15:24,777 --> 02:15:28,072
and if you're hungry, and if you
want to sleep in a comfortable bed...

1755
02:15:28,155 --> 02:15:31,116
you'll come down. Otherwise,
I値l give your tucker to the dog.

1756
02:15:37,331 --> 02:15:38,457
Blue.

1757
02:15:42,044 --> 02:15:43,379
Come here.

1758
02:15:44,713 --> 02:15:47,758
I got a nice big piece
of steak for you tonight.

1759
02:15:47,841 --> 02:15:50,386
Yeah, Dane's piece. Come on.

1760
02:16:16,245 --> 02:16:17,913
My dearest Frank.

1761
02:17:17,055 --> 02:17:19,892
It's the rain we need,
but it's going to be bad.

1762
02:17:19,975 --> 02:17:21,977
There could be some
flooding. Where's Justine?

1763
02:17:22,060 --> 02:17:24,021
-She's in her room.
-You better get her down.

1764
02:17:24,104 --> 02:17:26,440
-We'll need all the help we can get.
-I値l fetch her.

1765
02:17:26,523 --> 02:17:29,484
-Seen Mom?
-She's with Mrs. Smith, isn't she?

1766
02:17:37,159 --> 02:17:39,036
Justine, open the door.

1767
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:42,039
-What for?
-I want to talk to you.

1768
02:17:43,457 --> 02:17:45,000
Your mother isn't here.

1769
02:17:56,845 --> 02:17:58,931
So, you're gonna spend
the whole day up here...

1770
02:17:59,014 --> 02:18:02,184
moping about how unhappy you
are, and what a mess your life is.

1771
02:18:02,267 --> 02:18:04,144
That's my business.

1772
02:18:04,227 --> 02:18:07,481
There are a few other things that
are your business first, young lady.

1773
02:18:07,564 --> 02:18:09,566
-You can ride, can't you?
-Yes.

1774
02:18:09,650 --> 02:18:13,320
Then get changed into your
riding clothes and put this on.

1775
02:18:13,779 --> 02:18:15,739
What if I don't want to?

1776
02:18:16,406 --> 02:18:19,409
Justine, you're a country girl...

1777
02:18:20,077 --> 02:18:23,246
and your family runs this
station. It's been good to you.

1778
02:18:23,372 --> 02:18:25,499
It's given you security
and a safe future.

1779
02:18:25,582 --> 02:18:27,834
When you're old enough
to go out on your own...

1780
02:18:27,918 --> 02:18:30,921
you can do whatever you want,
but right now Drogheda needs you.

1781
02:18:31,004 --> 02:18:32,172
Why?

1782
02:18:32,255 --> 02:18:34,466
As you well know,
there's a storm coming...

1783
02:18:34,549 --> 02:18:36,510
and half the hands are useless...

1784
02:18:36,593 --> 02:18:40,013
and animals are going to die
unless you get off your fat behind.

1785
02:18:40,097 --> 02:18:41,473
It's not fat.

1786
02:18:41,556 --> 02:18:44,976
Maybe not, but it sure is
lazy. And we need your help.

1787
02:18:45,894 --> 02:18:48,146
Are you going to help us, Justine?

1788
02:18:48,230 --> 02:18:50,565
Not for your mother or for me...

1789
02:18:51,274 --> 02:18:53,485
but for yourself and Drogheda.

1790
02:18:56,613 --> 02:18:59,449
lf you put it like
that, how can I refuse?

1791
02:19:03,453 --> 02:19:06,123
You would make a good
actress, you know.

1792
02:19:06,206 --> 02:19:08,125
You sure had me fooled.

1793
02:19:15,048 --> 02:19:16,466
Young Billy!

1794
02:19:17,759 --> 02:19:20,554
-Boys! You got them horses ready?
-Yes.

1795
02:19:20,637 --> 02:19:23,682
Right, we've got to get everything
up to the top paddock. Let's go!

1796
02:19:25,767 --> 02:19:27,644
There's a strong filly!

1797
02:19:54,671 --> 02:19:56,047
Move it!

1798
02:20:32,042 --> 02:20:33,668
Get on! Move on!

1799
02:20:42,969 --> 02:20:44,054
Move!

1800
02:20:45,388 --> 02:20:46,848
Get in there!

1801
02:21:05,075 --> 02:21:06,993
It's so very beautiful.

1802
02:21:07,744 --> 02:21:09,579
God in all his glory.

1803
02:21:10,580 --> 02:21:13,500
I thought you didn't
believe in God anymore.

1804
02:21:54,499 --> 02:21:57,335
We'll never make it
back to Drogheda now.

1805
02:21:58,128 --> 02:22:01,256
There's a boundary rider's shack
on One Tree Hill. We'll go there.

1806
02:22:01,339 --> 02:22:02,841
What about the others?

1807
02:22:02,924 --> 02:22:05,844
They'll be back at
Drogheda by now. Come on.

1808
02:22:17,689 --> 02:22:20,775
-Dane, hold that gate!
-I致e got it, Dad.

1809
02:22:20,859 --> 02:22:23,611
-Go on, get up there.
-Come on, Blue, get around back!

1810
02:22:23,695 --> 02:22:26,448
-Get up there! Move your behinds!
-Come on, Blue!

1811
02:22:26,531 --> 02:22:28,742
Get around back. Come on, boy!

1812
02:22:30,994 --> 02:22:34,497
-That all, Dad?
-No, I can't find that blasted ram.

1813
02:22:34,914 --> 02:22:38,626
-And that bugger cost me a fortune.
-Can't be too far away.

1814
02:22:39,669 --> 02:22:41,796
You get your horse. Come on. Giddap!

1815
02:22:42,839 --> 02:22:44,841
Blue, get behind!

1816
02:22:57,937 --> 02:23:01,816
Sorry if it's a bit rough and ready,
but it's only used in emergencies.

1817
02:23:01,900 --> 02:23:03,902
At least we won't starve.

1818
02:23:04,527 --> 02:23:06,404
It's safe and dry, anyway.

1819
02:23:06,488 --> 02:23:10,033
-I値l see if I can get a fire going.
-Here's your dinner.

1820
02:23:10,116 --> 02:23:12,785
-It's Bully Beef.
-Gourmet treats.

1821
02:23:18,041 --> 02:23:20,668
You know, I lied to
you the other day.

1822
02:23:21,878 --> 02:23:25,423
I致e never stopped
loving you. I never could.

1823
02:23:29,260 --> 02:23:31,554
It's just I知 so confused.

1824
02:23:32,013 --> 02:23:34,766
I don't understand
what you want from me.

1825
02:23:35,099 --> 02:23:37,560
I don't know what I want myself...

1826
02:23:38,603 --> 02:23:39,938
except...

1827
02:25:01,477 --> 02:25:02,687
Giddap!

1828
02:25:02,937 --> 02:25:04,439
Blue, come on!

1829
02:25:10,653 --> 02:25:13,573
Dane! It's a waste of
time. It's nearly dark.

1830
02:25:13,906 --> 02:25:15,867
We won't be able to see.

1831
02:25:16,743 --> 02:25:19,162
Over there! Told you!

1832
02:25:21,372 --> 02:25:22,999
Dane, be careful!

1833
02:25:39,849 --> 02:25:41,142
Dane! Giddap!

1834
02:25:47,690 --> 02:25:48,733
Dad!

1835
02:25:55,072 --> 02:25:56,199
Dane!

1836
02:26:01,662 --> 02:26:02,747
Dane!

1837
02:26:06,501 --> 02:26:07,627
Go on.

1838
02:26:13,758 --> 02:26:15,510
Dad! Help!

1839
02:26:15,801 --> 02:26:17,470
My leg! Over here!

1840
02:26:18,304 --> 02:26:21,724
-Dad, over here!
-Hold on, Son! Hold on!

1841
02:26:30,316 --> 02:26:32,860
-My leg! Over here!
-Hold on.

1842
02:26:33,444 --> 02:26:36,113
-Hold on.
-Dad, help.

1843
02:26:36,197 --> 02:26:39,158
-Dad, my leg hurts.
-Wait there. Hang on.

1844
02:27:10,147 --> 02:27:11,941
Okay. All right. You'll be fine.

1845
02:27:34,839 --> 02:27:36,173
Here, drink this.

1846
02:27:36,257 --> 02:27:39,468
The sugar's 'cause you've had a
bit of a shock, and the whiskey...

1847
02:27:39,552 --> 02:27:41,220
well, why not?

1848
02:27:44,557 --> 02:27:46,017
What about the ram?

1849
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:49,812
I値l go back in a tick. He's in
the bushes. He's not going anywhere.

1850
02:27:51,731 --> 02:27:53,107
It's broken.

1851
02:27:53,190 --> 02:27:57,028
It's not that bad, it's a clean break,
but it's going to have to be set.

1852
02:27:57,111 --> 02:27:59,405
-Now, you trust me?
-Yeah.

1853
02:27:59,530 --> 02:28:01,032
Good man.

1854
02:28:01,115 --> 02:28:02,783
Now, it's going to hurt.

1855
02:28:02,992 --> 02:28:04,118
All right.

1856
02:28:04,326 --> 02:28:06,537
So have another swig of this...

1857
02:28:07,621 --> 02:28:10,249
and you can say a prayer if you like.

1858
02:28:11,917 --> 02:28:14,545
I致e never done this on a
person before, only a dog.

1859
02:28:14,628 --> 02:28:15,963
You ready?

1860
02:28:32,897 --> 02:28:34,565
-Morning.
-Morning.

1861
02:28:35,399 --> 02:28:37,985
Stay there. You get breakfast in bed.

1862
02:28:40,154 --> 02:28:43,741
It's baked beans and Bully Beef, I知
afraid. That's the best I could do.

1863
02:28:43,824 --> 02:28:46,118
Smells marvelous. I知 starving.

1864
02:28:53,417 --> 02:28:56,796
-Last night was wonderful.
-Yes, it was.

1865
02:29:06,388 --> 02:29:08,057
We got lots to do.

1866
02:29:08,307 --> 02:29:12,561
We need to find some feed for the horses,
and I知 sure Blackie's starving, too.

1867
02:29:54,687 --> 02:29:58,524
Mrs. Cleary, I知 afraid he
doesn't want to see you, ma'am.

1868
02:30:00,859 --> 02:30:02,861
What do you mean? Why not?

1869
02:30:03,195 --> 02:30:06,156
He wouldn't say. He
was very determined.

1870
02:30:06,865 --> 02:30:10,911
But he must. I知 his
mother. He can't not see me.

1871
02:30:11,579 --> 02:30:14,123
I知 sorry. There's nothing I can do.

1872
02:30:15,374 --> 02:30:19,086
He can be difficult. They
get like that sometimes.

1873
02:30:19,336 --> 02:30:22,589
-Probably feels he's let you down.
-I知 his mother.

1874
02:30:22,798 --> 02:30:24,425
I知 sorry, ma'am.

1875
02:30:26,760 --> 02:30:30,764
-How is he?
-He's not very well at all, I知 afraid.

1876
02:30:35,394 --> 02:30:38,522
lf he won't see me,
does he need a priest?

1877
02:30:40,649 --> 02:30:43,861
Father Donovan's giving
him last rites now, ma'am.

1878
02:31:43,754 --> 02:31:46,924
I知 going to miss this
place, Bully Beef and all.

1879
02:31:48,509 --> 02:31:50,302
I致e been happy here.

1880
02:31:51,261 --> 02:31:54,765
That's what you said at Matlock
Island, but you had to leave.

1881
02:31:54,848 --> 02:31:58,060
This time, I知 not sure I want to go.

1882
02:31:59,061 --> 02:32:03,482
Ralph, all your life you've been so sure
what you wanted, what you believed in...

1883
02:32:03,774 --> 02:32:06,026
that I can't bear
to see you in doubt.

1884
02:32:09,363 --> 02:32:12,449
I don't know what's
real anymore. I don't.

1885
02:32:13,951 --> 02:32:17,246
In Rome, before the war,
I had a worthwhile life.

1886
02:32:17,329 --> 02:32:20,374
I thought I was doing some
good for the world, for God.

1887
02:32:21,124 --> 02:32:24,461
And then the war swept over
us, and God disappeared.

1888
02:32:25,462 --> 02:32:27,798
And now nothing makes sense anymore.

1889
02:32:27,881 --> 02:32:30,717
-But the refugees, I thought--
-Yes, working for them...

1890
02:32:30,801 --> 02:32:32,719
I feel I have a purpose again.

1891
02:32:32,803 --> 02:32:35,514
But even that puts
me at odds with God.

1892
02:32:35,973 --> 02:32:38,725
-With God or with the Church?
-Both.

1893
02:32:44,648 --> 02:32:48,068
lf I left the Church, I壇 have
nothing. You understand that.

1894
02:32:48,151 --> 02:32:50,737
You're a priest.
You have nothing now.

1895
02:32:50,821 --> 02:32:54,032
I致e never loved you for what
you have. I love for what you are.

1896
02:32:54,116 --> 02:32:55,742
And I love you...

1897
02:32:56,743 --> 02:32:59,288
so much. That I know.

1898
02:33:02,165 --> 02:33:04,751
lf you want me just as I am...

1899
02:33:04,835 --> 02:33:07,754
foolish, misguided, dirt-poor...

1900
02:33:09,631 --> 02:33:10,966
I知 yours.

1901
02:33:16,555 --> 02:33:19,641
I致e waited my whole
life to hear you say that.

1902
02:33:26,273 --> 02:33:27,316
No.

1903
02:33:31,153 --> 02:33:32,362
Meggie...

1904
02:33:34,197 --> 02:33:36,325
I知 offering to give
up the priesthood.

1905
02:33:36,408 --> 02:33:37,868
And do what? Shear sheep?

1906
02:33:37,993 --> 02:33:39,953
Why not?

1907
02:33:40,037 --> 02:33:42,164
No, Ralph.

1908
02:33:44,499 --> 02:33:46,376
When I知 beside you...

1909
02:33:47,002 --> 02:33:49,796
it's as close to
heaven as I can imagine.

1910
02:33:50,964 --> 02:33:53,467
But even when you're making love...

1911
02:33:53,884 --> 02:33:57,346
it's as if you're trying to
reach something beyond me.

1912
02:33:58,180 --> 02:34:00,390
Look, it's a wonderful idea...

1913
02:34:01,058 --> 02:34:04,186
the two of us living
together in the wilderness.

1914
02:34:07,814 --> 02:34:09,941
But it's not what you really want.

1915
02:34:10,025 --> 02:34:11,735
What I want is you.

1916
02:34:12,152 --> 02:34:15,072
We can always come back
here for a few days.

1917
02:34:16,865 --> 02:34:19,159
Depending on how long you stay.

1918
02:34:25,665 --> 02:34:27,334
lf you won't have me, either...

1919
02:34:27,417 --> 02:34:30,420
then I really don't know
what I知 going to do.

1920
02:34:32,214 --> 02:34:33,298
I do.

1921
02:34:34,299 --> 02:34:37,886
You're going to help me get
these sheep back to Drogheda.

1922
02:35:15,423 --> 02:35:17,884
Dane! Got a visitor.

1923
02:35:30,939 --> 02:35:33,441
-Gran.
-Dane.

1924
02:35:33,525 --> 02:35:36,152
Darling, what's happened?

1925
02:35:36,236 --> 02:35:38,780
Broke my leg. It hurts
like anything, Gran.

1926
02:35:42,033 --> 02:35:45,120
Gran, it hurts. Take me
home. Please, take me home.

1927
02:35:45,203 --> 02:35:47,289
-I want Mom.
-There, there, darling.

1928
02:35:47,372 --> 02:35:49,916
It'll be all right. Gran's here now.

1929
02:35:50,041 --> 02:35:52,419
She'll make everything all right.

1930
02:35:55,714 --> 02:35:56,882
There.

1931
02:36:15,025 --> 02:36:17,277
He's sleeping now. Doctor
gave him a sedative.

1932
02:36:17,360 --> 02:36:19,988
Put the leg in plaster. Said
you did a very good job...

1933
02:36:20,071 --> 02:36:22,240
-setting the break.
-That's a wonder.

1934
02:36:22,324 --> 02:36:25,160
Never actually done
it on a person before.

1935
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:28,538
Only on me dog, Blue.

1936
02:36:29,914 --> 02:36:33,084
-You've got a lot to do here.
-Yeah, heaps.

1937
02:36:35,086 --> 02:36:37,464
But I want to make a go
of it, for Dane's sake.

1938
02:36:37,547 --> 02:36:39,215
He's my son, and...

1939
02:36:43,803 --> 02:36:45,555
I can't manage the place on my own...

1940
02:36:45,639 --> 02:36:47,515
and the boy doesn't
seem much interested.

1941
02:36:47,599 --> 02:36:51,186
I知 not surprised. He wants to do
something else with his life, doesn't he?

1942
02:36:51,269 --> 02:36:52,604
We'll work it out.

1943
02:36:52,687 --> 02:36:55,023
-You'll break Meggie's heart.
-Like she broke mine.

1944
02:36:55,106 --> 02:36:56,983
She didn't break your heart.

1945
02:36:57,067 --> 02:37:01,446
She was a pretty girl and a good catch,
but mostly what you saw was her money.

1946
02:37:01,529 --> 02:37:04,115
I offered her that money
back, like I told the judge.

1947
02:37:04,199 --> 02:37:06,659
Only 'cause you knew
she'd never take it.

1948
02:37:06,743 --> 02:37:09,621
I壇 be surprised if
you even had the money.

1949
02:37:11,122 --> 02:37:13,958
Did you spend all of
it? All of her dowry?

1950
02:37:15,293 --> 02:37:17,295
Well, I kept a few quid.

1951
02:37:17,629 --> 02:37:20,590
Enough for the deposit
on this place, anyway.

1952
02:37:21,257 --> 02:37:22,884
Just as I thought.

1953
02:37:24,386 --> 02:37:26,721
You know, you were clever, Luke.

1954
02:37:27,263 --> 02:37:29,391
Maybe a bit too clever
for your own good.

1955
02:37:29,474 --> 02:37:31,768
Everything you did when
you came back to Drogheda...

1956
02:37:31,851 --> 02:37:33,770
was part of a plan to get Dane.

1957
02:37:33,853 --> 02:37:36,815
-And I got him, too.
-Is that such a triumph?

1958
02:37:42,070 --> 02:37:43,863
My first son, Frank...

1959
02:37:45,323 --> 02:37:47,492
was not my husband's child.

1960
02:37:48,368 --> 02:37:51,496
When Frank found out, he ran away
and got in with bad company...

1961
02:37:51,579 --> 02:37:53,665
and ended up killing a man.

1962
02:37:55,166 --> 02:37:57,210
And I never saw him again.

1963
02:37:58,086 --> 02:37:59,629
He died in a prison cell...

1964
02:37:59,712 --> 02:38:02,340
and I didn't even have
a chance to say goodbye.

1965
02:38:04,050 --> 02:38:07,679
-Don't let that happen to Dane.
-It can't. It's different.

1966
02:38:09,639 --> 02:38:12,183
Dane'll never turn bad like Frank...

1967
02:38:12,517 --> 02:38:15,979
because I値l always be there for
him, like a good father should...

1968
02:38:16,062 --> 02:38:18,273
to teach him right from wrong.

1969
02:38:18,356 --> 02:38:20,358
But you're not his father.

1970
02:38:23,194 --> 02:38:25,738
lf I知 not, I壇 like to know who is.

1971
02:38:29,492 --> 02:38:31,077
Can't you guess?

1972
02:38:38,710 --> 02:38:40,461
That bloody priest.

1973
02:38:44,465 --> 02:38:46,342
I知 going to kill him.

1974
02:38:47,302 --> 02:38:50,555
I知 going to break every
bone in his body, I swear.

1975
02:39:33,723 --> 02:39:36,142
So why didn't she tell the judge?

1976
02:39:37,518 --> 02:39:40,229
He never would've given
Dane to me if she had.

1977
02:39:40,313 --> 02:39:42,607
To keep Dane, she would've
had to destroy Ralph...

1978
02:39:42,690 --> 02:39:43,858
and his life in the Church.

1979
02:39:43,941 --> 02:39:47,528
She gave away the boy she loved
for the sake of the man she loved.

1980
02:39:48,321 --> 02:39:51,032
Still, it makes sense, doesn't it?

1981
02:39:51,115 --> 02:39:53,743
Now we know why
Dane's so keen on God.

1982
02:39:55,745 --> 02:39:57,538
-Does Ralph know?
-No.

1983
02:39:58,081 --> 02:40:00,208
And you must never tell him.

1984
02:40:01,668 --> 02:40:04,671
It's no wonder she never
told me we had a son.

1985
02:40:06,130 --> 02:40:08,132
So how does it feel, Fee?

1986
02:40:09,258 --> 02:40:13,346
Having a lying bitch for a daughter
and a fornicating priest as her lover?

1987
02:40:13,429 --> 02:40:15,348
It's in the past, Luke.

1988
02:40:15,848 --> 02:40:18,184
We've all done things we regret.

1989
02:40:19,686 --> 02:40:21,521
Ain't that the truth?

1990
02:40:21,854 --> 02:40:24,816
Biggest mistake I ever
made was marrying her.

1991
02:40:25,149 --> 02:40:27,568
Let me take Dane away. I beg you.

1992
02:40:28,903 --> 02:40:31,322
Let there be an end to this, now.

1993
02:40:32,865 --> 02:40:35,701
You tell his dad to come and see me.

1994
02:40:36,077 --> 02:40:38,788
You promise me you will never
tell Ralph or Dane the truth?

1995
02:40:38,871 --> 02:40:42,083
-Why would I promise a thing like that?
-Because if you do...

1996
02:40:42,166 --> 02:40:45,461
Ralph will be forced to leave the
Church, and he will marry Meggie...

1997
02:40:45,545 --> 02:40:49,340
and they and Dane and
Justine will be a family.

1998
02:40:50,007 --> 02:40:52,051
And you will have nothing.

1999
02:40:56,764 --> 02:40:59,058
Well, we can't have
that, now, can we?

2000
02:41:01,018 --> 02:41:04,897
All right, Fee. I promise
I won't tell a living soul.

2001
02:41:08,443 --> 02:41:10,945
But I want to speak to that priest.

2002
02:41:30,923 --> 02:41:33,384
Meg, Justine! Mom's home!

2003
02:41:38,890 --> 02:41:40,850
We were worried about you, Mom.

2004
02:41:40,933 --> 02:41:43,436
I知 quite capable of
looking after myself.

2005
02:41:43,769 --> 02:41:46,647
Are you all right? What
have you been doing?

2006
02:41:47,607 --> 02:41:50,526
I致e been trying to come
to terms with Frank's death.

2007
02:41:50,610 --> 02:41:53,362
But that was two days ago,
Mom. Where have you been?

2008
02:41:53,446 --> 02:41:55,615
I went to see Luke and Dane.

2009
02:41:56,490 --> 02:41:57,575
Why?

2010
02:41:57,909 --> 02:42:00,786
Because Luke is my son-in-law,
and Dane is my grandson.

2011
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:02,788
Is that reason enough?

2012
02:42:03,122 --> 02:42:05,291
I tried to persuade
Luke to give up Dane.

2013
02:42:05,374 --> 02:42:06,459
He wouldn't.

2014
02:42:07,418 --> 02:42:09,128
He wants to talk to Ralph.

2015
02:42:09,295 --> 02:42:10,463
To me?

2016
02:42:11,505 --> 02:42:14,133
Mrs. Smith, I would
love a cup of tea.

2017
02:42:22,058 --> 02:42:25,978
And so the spark ignites the fuel
and then forces the piston down.

2018
02:42:26,437 --> 02:42:29,106
-Hello, Dane. Luke.
-Father Ralph! Father!

2019
02:42:29,190 --> 02:42:31,025
Just hold your horses.

2020
02:42:31,108 --> 02:42:34,028
-You'll have plenty of time to talk to him.
-How's the leg?

2021
02:42:34,111 --> 02:42:37,573
Getting better. I致e been
through the war, as Dad says.

2022
02:42:37,907 --> 02:42:39,909
So what can I do for you?

2023
02:42:39,992 --> 02:42:42,578
-I thought you wanted to see me.
-Yes.

2024
02:42:42,995 --> 02:42:44,622
Just this once.

2025
02:42:44,997 --> 02:42:47,875
And then I never want
to see your face again.

2026
02:42:49,251 --> 02:42:51,963
Dane, take a good look.

2027
02:42:53,547 --> 02:42:55,925
Now, is that what you want to be?

2028
02:42:56,217 --> 02:42:59,512
A namby-pamby priest
in a woman's dress...

2029
02:43:00,346 --> 02:43:02,306
like this gutless wonder?

2030
02:43:02,390 --> 02:43:05,142
Is that why you got me
out here? To call me names?

2031
02:43:05,226 --> 02:43:07,812
Partly, yes.

2032
02:43:07,895 --> 02:43:09,730
I壇 hoped it was more serious.

2033
02:43:09,814 --> 02:43:13,609
I壇 hoped you were going to give Dane
back to his mother, where he belongs.

2034
02:43:13,693 --> 02:43:16,487
-Is that what you want?
-That's what Meggie wants.

2035
02:43:16,570 --> 02:43:19,532
-And you?
-I want what Meggie wants.

2036
02:43:20,783 --> 02:43:22,410
I値l bet you do.

2037
02:43:23,953 --> 02:43:25,538
I値l bet...

2038
02:43:25,621 --> 02:43:28,249
you're an expert at
what Meggie wants.

2039
02:43:33,963 --> 02:43:36,507
You shouldn't say things
like that in front of the boy.

2040
02:43:36,590 --> 02:43:37,800
Why not?

2041
02:43:38,175 --> 02:43:41,387
Why shouldn't the boy
know what his mother is?

2042
02:43:42,513 --> 02:43:44,014
And what you are?

2043
02:43:44,098 --> 02:43:47,601
All right, you've had your fun.
Now, for God's sake, let the boy go.

2044
02:43:47,685 --> 02:43:48,936
Make me.

2045
02:43:49,687 --> 02:43:51,439
I don't understand.

2046
02:43:53,441 --> 02:43:55,192
You want the boy?

2047
02:43:57,111 --> 02:43:58,779
You fight for him.

2048
02:43:59,697 --> 02:44:02,491
I知 a priest, Luke. I don't fight.

2049
02:44:02,575 --> 02:44:04,368
lf you don't fight...

2050
02:44:06,328 --> 02:44:08,205
you don't get the boy.

2051
02:44:09,165 --> 02:44:11,000
No! Stop!

2052
02:44:11,625 --> 02:44:13,169
This is stupid.

2053
02:44:13,919 --> 02:44:15,254
Dad, stop!

2054
02:44:16,338 --> 02:44:19,758
-I will not fight!
-A real man would.

2055
02:44:20,759 --> 02:44:22,887
No! Father!

2056
02:44:34,857 --> 02:44:36,901
Hit him, Father! Hit him!

2057
02:44:39,361 --> 02:44:41,238
Now you get out of here.

2058
02:44:41,322 --> 02:44:43,908
I won't fight a man
that won't fight back.

2059
02:44:43,991 --> 02:44:46,660
But that settles it. The boy is mine.

2060
02:44:49,205 --> 02:44:52,416
Dane, you come with me.

2061
02:44:54,210 --> 02:44:55,836
Father! No!

2062
02:45:01,300 --> 02:45:02,343
No!

2063
02:45:35,751 --> 02:45:37,169
The boy...

2064
02:45:38,170 --> 02:45:39,713
is mine.

2065
02:46:22,756 --> 02:46:24,925
-Dane?
-Mommy!

2066
02:46:27,886 --> 02:46:29,388
Dane!

2067
02:46:41,692 --> 02:46:42,860
Thank you.

2068
02:47:20,314 --> 02:47:22,483
This is an odd place to pray.

2069
02:47:23,233 --> 02:47:24,902
God is everywhere.

2070
02:47:25,068 --> 02:47:27,321
Our Lord was born in a stable.

2071
02:47:28,030 --> 02:47:30,240
And I needed somewhere quiet.

2072
02:47:32,910 --> 02:47:34,703
Dane prays here, too.

2073
02:47:35,662 --> 02:47:38,165
We all use it for different reasons.

2074
02:47:40,667 --> 02:47:42,586
I pretend it's a theater sometimes...

2075
02:47:42,669 --> 02:47:45,214
filled with people
cheering my performances.

2076
02:47:46,423 --> 02:47:49,635
And Mom used it as a
ballroom and danced with Dad.

2077
02:47:52,596 --> 02:47:54,515
Why did you have to come?

2078
02:47:54,598 --> 02:47:56,517
We were happy until you came here.

2079
02:47:56,600 --> 02:47:59,228
-Justie!
-Mom was gonna go back to Dad...

2080
02:47:59,311 --> 02:48:01,813
and he was gonna love
me, even if Mom didn't.

2081
02:48:01,897 --> 02:48:03,482
But you stopped that.

2082
02:48:03,565 --> 02:48:05,275
That had nothing to do with me.

2083
02:48:06,360 --> 02:48:07,444
No?

2084
02:48:09,404 --> 02:48:12,741
Funny that it all went wrong
just when you showed up.

2085
02:48:14,368 --> 02:48:17,579
And then, when Dad didn't
want me and took Dane...

2086
02:48:18,580 --> 02:48:20,540
I was sad at first.

2087
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:23,585
But then something else happened.

2088
02:48:23,835 --> 02:48:25,170
What was that?

2089
02:48:25,921 --> 02:48:28,548
I thought, ''lf Dane isn't here...

2090
02:48:29,341 --> 02:48:31,426
''Mom will have to love me.''

2091
02:48:33,428 --> 02:48:34,846
But she didn't.

2092
02:48:36,098 --> 02:48:38,850
And she won't now, because
you interfered again.

2093
02:48:39,810 --> 02:48:41,853
I did what had to be done, Justine.

2094
02:48:41,937 --> 02:48:43,522
Dane would never have been happy.

2095
02:48:43,605 --> 02:48:45,274
But I might have been.

2096
02:48:46,858 --> 02:48:49,987
This was my chance of
happiness with Mom...

2097
02:48:50,737 --> 02:48:52,447
until you got Dane back.

2098
02:48:53,615 --> 02:48:55,325
I thought you loved Dane.

2099
02:48:56,368 --> 02:48:58,954
I do, with all my heart.

2100
02:48:59,955 --> 02:49:01,957
But everyone loves Dane.

2101
02:49:03,583 --> 02:49:06,169
There doesn't seem to
be any left over for me.

2102
02:49:06,545 --> 02:49:09,673
Justine, that's not true.

2103
02:49:11,550 --> 02:49:13,135
Isn稚 it?

2104
02:49:14,845 --> 02:49:17,973
I saw you when you came
back, all beaten and bloody.

2105
02:49:19,850 --> 02:49:22,269
Did he put up a good
fight, my father?

2106
02:49:22,811 --> 02:49:24,771
To stop you taking Dane...

2107
02:49:26,064 --> 02:49:27,774
because he loved him?

2108
02:49:31,945 --> 02:49:33,947
But nobody loves me.

2109
02:50:06,354 --> 02:50:08,732
Justine thinks that
you don't love her.

2110
02:50:09,691 --> 02:50:10,859
I know.

2111
02:50:12,194 --> 02:50:14,696
I don't know how to
tell her that I do...

2112
02:50:15,113 --> 02:50:17,032
not in any way she'll believe.

2113
02:50:19,326 --> 02:50:22,037
I see so much of myself in Justine...

2114
02:50:22,537 --> 02:50:24,414
and too much of Mom in me.

2115
02:50:28,877 --> 02:50:30,045
When I was a little girl...

2116
02:50:30,128 --> 02:50:32,672
back in New Zealand,
before we came here...

2117
02:50:32,756 --> 02:50:34,257
we were very poor.

2118
02:50:35,050 --> 02:50:37,761
I remember I was about
four or five years old...

2119
02:50:37,844 --> 02:50:40,180
and there was a doll
in a shop window.

2120
02:50:40,263 --> 02:50:44,100
I used to go and look at her every
day. I even gave her a name: Agnes.

2121
02:50:44,976 --> 02:50:47,771
She was pretty, with golden hair.

2122
02:50:48,188 --> 02:50:50,649
I wanted her so much.

2123
02:50:51,441 --> 02:50:53,985
On my next birthday,
Mom gave me Agnes...

2124
02:50:54,069 --> 02:50:55,862
all wrapped in brown paper.

2125
02:50:56,071 --> 02:50:58,949
Don't know how she could afford
it, and I didn't care then...

2126
02:50:59,032 --> 02:51:02,661
because she had given me the
most perfect present I壇 ever had.

2127
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:05,413
So, you see...

2128
02:51:05,789 --> 02:51:09,167
it didn't matter that she never
told me she loved me, ever.

2129
02:51:10,001 --> 02:51:11,586
'Cause just once...

2130
02:51:12,170 --> 02:51:15,549
she'd given me the most
beautiful thing in the world.

2131
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:22,097
I致e never been able to find
quite the right doll for Justine.

2132
02:51:27,852 --> 02:51:30,438
-So you're going back?
-To Sydney.

2133
02:51:30,814 --> 02:51:33,149
The government has finally
agreed to an inquiry...

2134
02:51:33,233 --> 02:51:37,070
into refugees and stateless people.
Of course, I have to be there.

2135
02:51:38,613 --> 02:51:40,198
And then on to Rome.

2136
02:51:44,744 --> 02:51:46,997
Have you found what
you were looking for?

2137
02:51:47,080 --> 02:51:48,248
Oh, yes.

2138
02:51:51,084 --> 02:51:52,961
I found that loving you...

2139
02:51:54,087 --> 02:51:56,131
is a blessing, not a burden.

2140
02:51:58,300 --> 02:51:59,884
And in fighting for Dane...

2141
02:51:59,968 --> 02:52:02,470
I discovered a strength
I never knew I had.

2142
02:52:02,887 --> 02:52:04,639
And it's the duty of the strong...

2143
02:52:04,723 --> 02:52:07,726
to protect, to fight for those
who can't fight for themselves...

2144
02:52:07,809 --> 02:52:09,227
especially children.

2145
02:52:09,644 --> 02:52:13,398
That's why I have to go back to
the war. That's where my work is.

2146
02:52:15,525 --> 02:52:17,068
I haven't found God.

2147
02:52:17,902 --> 02:52:21,281
I wish I understood this
God that you love so much.

2148
02:52:21,364 --> 02:52:22,991
I wish I did, too.

2149
02:52:24,367 --> 02:52:27,412
At night, I look at
the infinity of stars...

2150
02:52:28,079 --> 02:52:29,873
and I feel...

2151
02:52:31,374 --> 02:52:34,252
something beyond mortality.
I don't know what it is...

2152
02:52:34,335 --> 02:52:37,047
but I have to find out, or try.

2153
02:52:39,299 --> 02:52:41,718
I don't care what's out there.

2154
02:52:43,928 --> 02:52:46,431
God is love, and love is here.

2155
02:53:04,157 --> 02:53:05,700
What are you reading?

2156
02:53:06,826 --> 02:53:08,161
Hamlet.

2157
02:53:09,370 --> 02:53:11,539
I知 learning Ophelia's mad scene.

2158
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:13,124
May l?

2159
02:53:16,878 --> 02:53:19,714
You really do want to
become an actress, don't you?

2160
02:53:20,089 --> 02:53:22,091
It's all I致e ever wanted to do.

2161
02:53:22,884 --> 02:53:25,595
Justine, I wanted to
tell you I知 sorry.

2162
02:53:26,596 --> 02:53:27,889
Come here.

2163
02:53:31,601 --> 02:53:34,896
Look, I know the last few
months haven't been easy for you.

2164
02:53:35,230 --> 02:53:37,774
All that business with
your father, and...

2165
02:53:39,025 --> 02:53:41,653
I am sorry things turned
out the way they did.

2166
02:53:43,613 --> 02:53:46,616
I壇 like to try and do
something to make it up to you.

2167
02:53:48,117 --> 02:53:50,870
How soon can you start
acting school in Sydney?

2168
02:53:51,788 --> 02:53:54,541
-I can't till I知 16.
-But if you were in Sydney...

2169
02:53:54,624 --> 02:53:57,877
you could go to acting classes,
or maybe see some theater.

2170
02:53:59,796 --> 02:54:01,631
-You mean-- -Look,
the thing is...

2171
02:54:01,714 --> 02:54:05,260
I don't want you to think that I知
trying to get rid of you, or anything.

2172
02:54:05,343 --> 02:54:07,470
I don't want to hurt you anymore.

2173
02:54:07,845 --> 02:54:10,807
Mom, don't be silly.
I wouldn't think that.

2174
02:54:11,766 --> 02:54:15,436
Going to school in Sydney is the
best present you could ever give me.

2175
02:54:16,020 --> 02:54:17,814
Better than a pretty doll?

2176
02:54:19,107 --> 02:54:20,191
Mom?

2177
02:54:20,858 --> 02:54:22,068
Never mind.

2178
02:54:23,236 --> 02:54:24,571
Just be happy.

2179
02:54:26,573 --> 02:54:29,492
Thank you.

2180
02:54:55,059 --> 02:54:56,185
All aboard!

2181
02:56:16,474 --> 02:56:19,602
I love you.
