Batman's methods as their own...

One of several splinter groups that formed...

was defeated by the Batman.

Were you a friend?

862
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:52,104
I think so. I honestly couldn't say.

863
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:54,774
Sounds about right.

864
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,621
[HEART BEATS]

865
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:16,462
[HEART BEATS]

866
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:40,319
-See that ledge? Get another lamp up there.
-Right, boss.

867
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:43,781
-And, you, one there too.
-Cool, boss.

868
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:46,158
OLIVER:
There's a fresh spring under here.

869
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:48,494
I want our water supply set up in one hour.

870
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:52,331
-We ain't got forever, people.
BRUCE: Sure we do.

871
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,355
Starting now,
I'm going to teach you everything.

872
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:19,692
All of my ways. All of my secrets.

873
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,778
You're going to be my army,
operating in the shadows...

874
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:24,864
...keeping Gotham safe.

875
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:28,492
And we're going to take
as long as we need.

876
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:31,662
Now, do what Oliver says
and get to work.

877
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,539
-Right, boss.
-You got it, boss.

878
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:37,042
MAN 1 : Give me a hand here.
MAN 2: Go. Come on, come on, come on.

879
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,671
OLIVER:
Heard the schoolboy found you out.

880
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:43,382
It's all right.
I think the message got through.

881
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:46,886
As long as we stay quiet,
he'll leave us alone.

882
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:51,557
-You gonna be all right with this?
-This quieter mysterious?

883
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:55,102
I spent 1 0 years looking for a good death.

884
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,729
This....

885
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:00,733
This'll be a good life.

886
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:28,260
Good enough.
