Boy: (Over speaker) <i> Laura?</i>

00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,385
<i>Laura!</i>

4
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:01,493
<i>Laura, just don't...</i>

5
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,397
<i>Laura, do you hear me?</i>

00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,399
Boy 2: <i> Hey! Put it down!</i>

00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,768
Boy: <i> It's okay. It's okay.</i>
<i>It's okay. Put it down.</i>

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,611
Girl: <i> Laura, stop it!</i>
Boy: <i> Let's go inside...</i>

00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:16,508
<i>Laura!</i>

Val: <i> What the fuck?</i>

13
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:42,935
Boy: <i> You better slap that ho!</i>

14
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,369
Val: <i> Yeah, whore, I will beat your ass.
</i> (Indistinct chatter)

15
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,238
<i>You'll beat my ass?</i> (Laughs)

<i>She's gonna beat my ass, everybody!
</i> (Boys cheering)

17
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,610
<i>Val is gonna beat my ass. Oh!</i>

00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:05,557
<i>I'm going to bed.</i> (Giggling)

24
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,460
(Sirens wailing in distance)

25
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,106
Blaire: Hey. Hey, baby.

26
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,942
Mitch: (Through monitor)
<i>What's up? You okay?</i>

27
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:24,743
Uh-huh.

28
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,480
<i>You sound, like, a little down.</i>

29
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,517
Oh. No, no, no, no. I'm great.

30
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,584
<i>Okay.</i>

31
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,155
(Music playing)

32
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,257
(Whispering) I got
something to show you.

33
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,791
<i>Ooh.</i>

34
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,461
<i>I'm excited. Hang on real quick.
I'm gonna pee.</i>

35
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,996
(Mitch urinating)

36
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,097
(In demonic voice) Mitch.

37
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,533
(Chuckling) <i>Hey. I'm here.</i>

38
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,170
I got something to show you.

39
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,105
<i>You doing your</i>
<i>demon voice again?</i>

40
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,206
Yeah.

41
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,040
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

42
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,808
You like them?

43
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,944
<i>Yeah. Oh, that's so hot.</i>

44
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,546
It's getting me there.
And feet, too. Yeah.

45
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,949
I love just the top of toes.

46
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,552
Blaire: (In normal voice) What, you...
wait. You don't like them, do you?

47
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:10,022
No, it's just, you know, there's
other things I wanna see more of.

48
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,791
Yeah, it was worth a shot. I
think I know what you want.

49
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,059
Yeah, let's keep moving up.

50
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,528
There we go. That's closer.

51
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,330
My bruised knees.

52
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,632
No. No, I don't wanna live there.
No? That's not it?

53
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,634
I don't wanna live there.
I wanna live higher.

54
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,136
Come on.
You're a real estate agent.

55
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,204
Sell this to me.

56
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,972
(Chuckles)

57
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:31,843
Well, you are now looking at the
outside of a human's right leg.

58
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,845
(Coughs)

59
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,147
You know what? You should
just let me come over

60
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,548
and show you how it's done.

61
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,817
No, you can't.

62
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,719
What do you mean, I can't?

63
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,056
No. My dad would kill you.

64
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:47,459
That's easy. Fine. That's worth it.
I'd die for you.

65
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,865
You're worth it.

66
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,401
I want you to
take that shirt off.

67
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,608
Make me.

68
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:12,618
Take that shirt off
before I cut it off.

69
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,453
That's really violent.

70
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:18,190
Take the shirt off,
or I'll cut it off.

71
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,561
(Laughing)

72
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,696
Hey, that worked.

73
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,833
That does it for you?
All right.

74
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,970
Keep going.
Keep going, you're...

75
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:35,240
Faster. Come on. (Humming)

76
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:38,443
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want
those hands down there.

77
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,413
No, no, no. Back down.
(Chuckling)

78
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,881
And I want those panties off,

79
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,950
or you're gonna lose them.

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,488
You're adorable.

81
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,456
And really sexy
when you're violent.

82
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,858
Yeah?

83
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,827
Um...

84
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,264
(Exhales)

85
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,465
What?

86
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,402
What, miss blue baller?

87
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,837
Hey, girls get them, too.

88
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,494
Don't... I don't wanna
hear about your balls.

89
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,106
That's so gross.

90
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,474
(Laughs) No, you know
what I mean. Like...

91
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,410
I don't know what you mean.

92
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:14,446
I just have this mental
picture of balls, but no.

93
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:18,950
Well, I feel like you. I don't
want to experience that anymore.

94
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,086
Um, which is...

95
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:21,887
(Snickering)

96
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,323
Why...

97
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,524
Do you have
a little speech planned?

98
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,825
I... (Laughing)

99
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,695
Stop!

100
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:32,197
What? I wanna make
prom night the night.

101
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,166
Yeah?

102
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,168
You're serious?

103
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,436
Mmm-hmm.

104
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,304
You wouldn't lie to me?

105
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,505
No.

106
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,776
You wouldn't lie to me?
You're serious?

107
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,778
No, I'm not lying to you.

108
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,613
That's great. That is...

109
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,682
(Whooping)

110
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,552
That's finally the reaction
I was looking for.

111
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,154
(Sing-song) two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?

112
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:59,725
Your boobies! Your, your,
your, your boobies!

113
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,193
Yeah. (Laughs)

114
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,794
Let's keep this show going.

115
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,564
(Stammering) I wanna
see what I'm getting.

116
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,407
Prom night. I got something
to look forward to.

117
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,501
Hey, we'll call him back.

118
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,536
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

119
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,572
It's just getting good.
Get the knife.

120
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,576
Get the knife, baby.

121
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,811
Let's see the whole show.

122
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:20,879
Oh, hey, guys.

123
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:21,980
Jess: Oh, shit!

124
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,982
Ken: What's going on? Adam: Oh!

125
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,417
Ken: Oh! Someone's
in their chonies!

126
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,518
Jess: What did we walk in on?
Adam: Uh-oh.

127
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,019
A little cybersex!

128
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,721
Someone's in their chonies!

129
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,423
Blaire, you're a dirty girl.

130
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,357
You're going to hell now.

131
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,692
Blaire: What?

132
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,993
Ken: What are you guys doing?

133
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:35,994
Going to hell
with the rest of us.

134
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,596
Nothing. What's up?

135
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,197
Hey, guys. Ken: Where are
you coming from, man?

136
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,332
Hey, Mitch. Why do you have

137
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,200
such a big boner, bro?

138
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,402
(Laughing)

139
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,537
What are you talking about?
I totally missed it.

140
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,372
Shut up. Ken: Hey, blaire.

141
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,573
Hey, Ken. Not funny.

142
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,208
How are you? Blaire,
your blouse, babe.

143
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,710
What?

144
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,745
(Chuckling) What are you calling
my girlfriend "babe" for?

145
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,781
Hey, Mitch, who's your buddy?

146
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,916
What? Who's your buddy?

147
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,351
Uh...

148
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,620
That's not with us.

149
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,188
What kind of sex
were you guys having?

150
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,256
I thought you guys
brought that in.

151
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,390
Blaire: Ken, we were
not having sex.

152
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,125
No, wasn't us. Were you
having a three-way?

153
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,594
No. What? Who is that?
Adam: Um...

154
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,729
I just tried to hang up on him.

155
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:11,563
I don't know.
It wasn't with us.

156
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,631
Jess: Cyber three-way!

157
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,232
Ken? Ken: Yeah? Uh...

158
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,034
I tried to hang up on this thing.
It wouldn't let me.

159
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,436
Jess: You take turns?

160
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:20,205
Mitch: (Stammering) Honestly,
he is not in with us.

161
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,940
That came with you guys.

162
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,642
It's not working.
Mitch: All right.

163
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,813
Ken: All right.

164
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,581
Blaire: What do you mean? Let's
just call each other back.

165
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,515
Yeah? Okay.

166
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,486
Bye. Bye.

167
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:42,894
(Music playing)

168
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,081
(Dialing)

169
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,020
(Line ringing)

170
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,931
(Music continues playing)

171
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:32,170
Ken: Hi!

172
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,705
Jess: Hi! Adam: Why is
this fucker still here?

173
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,507
What, Mitch's boner?

174
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,575
(Laughing)

175
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,844
What is this person's problem?

176
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:43,181
Ken: Guys, guys, it's
definitely a hacker.

177
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,617
He's spying to get info on
farts and boners, okay?

178
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,385
Is that what today's agenda is?

179
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,254
Ken: Well, we haven't
hit the farts yet,

180
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,190
but thanks to the Ken's
famous salsa,

181
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,627
the gas will be
rolling tonight, baby.

182
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,028
Blaire: Guys, hey.

183
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,430
All right, stop.
Jess: You're so gross.

184
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,599
Can we get rid of this person?

185
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,968
Um...

186
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,970
How about I call blaire back,

187
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,872
and then we'll go from there.

188
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,140
Jess: Bye. Ken: Bye.

189
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,724
What's up?

190
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:40,959
It's still there.

191
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,696
So, were you guys
really cybering?

192
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,531
No.

193
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,199
Is that, like, a thing you do?

194
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,236
It's... Huh?

195
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,104
Adam: It's really cute.
Blaire: It's still here.

196
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,606
Adam: You guys are so cute.

197
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,109
Jess: Hey.

198
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,645
Adam: Hey, guys. Jess: Heyo!

199
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,783
It's still here.

200
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,219
Whatever, fuck it.

201
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,320
Ken: It's just
probably a glitch.

202
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,122
How do we know that?

203
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,557
Yeah, I can't call the number

204
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,758
or anything like that.
So it's probably...

205
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,826
Adam: Oh, shit!

206
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:18,229
Three stars, motherfuckers!
Suck on that!

207
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,565
Ken: Um... yo, so I talked
to Kyle about Friday.

208
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,401
And I got the weed, but
he's out of Molly. So...

209
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,836
(Conversation fades)

210
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,433
Blaire: What?

211
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,096
Jess: Blaire, come back!

212
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,364
Blaire! Where'd you go?

213
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,102
Adam: Stop looking at porn!

214
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,570
Mitch: (Laughing) Shut up,
for, like, a second.

215
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:26,971
Jess: Are you talking to boys?

216
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:30,441
Hey, I'm writing
an email. Stop.

217
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,377
Ken: From the horse's mouth.

218
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,679
(Jess laughing)

219
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,630
Blaire: Guys, did you
talk to val tonight?

220
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,932
Jess: Oh, dude, when we
were at Adam's party,

221
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,834
she was telling people
I had a drinking problem.

222
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,302
Adam: You do.

223
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,604
I'm gonna add her. Can I just be honest?
I don't like val.

224
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:34,705
(Jess laughing)

225
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,107
Nobody likes val. (Dialing)

226
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,441
Can I just be honest? I don't like her.
(Line ringing)

227
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,809
The only person that likes val

228
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,344
is val. Is val. Yeah.

229
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,713
You just get me, Jess.

230
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,483
Adam: Hi, val.

231
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,551
Hey, val.

232
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,619
Ken: Hey, val.

233
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:52,190
Val. Turn up the sound,
you dumb bitch.

234
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,393
Val!

235
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,994
Can you hear me now, Ken?

236
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,296
Ken: Yeah, there you are, you floozy.
(Jess chuckles)

237
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,630
Hi, yeah.

238
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,332
You know, when you talk
and it's muted,

239
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,967
I can still hear you
on your end.

240
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,903
So I don't appreciate
"dumb bitch."

241
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:09,006
Okay. Did you guys
buy your tickets,

242
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,741
like, two weeks ago
like I asked you?

243
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,043
Ken: No, you said you
were gonna get 'em.

244
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,845
Val: No, you didn't.
No, I told you to buy them.

245
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,581
So now I'm hearing
that you guys

246
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,182
are gonna be seated
in the balcony,

247
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,584
and three of us are gonna
have to sit in the orchestra.

248
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,552
(Music playing) So, maybe you
should have bought your tickets...

249
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,187
Blaire: Why? Val: Sooner
like I told you.

250
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,022
Ken: All right. What? I don't care.
That's too bad.

251
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,591
I wish you bought
your ticket earlier.

252
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,859
Um, which seats are better,
balcony or orchestra?

253
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,761
Balcony. Balcony.

254
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:31,829
Ken: I'll take orchestra.
Okay, you're in balcony.

255
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,065
I can take one more in balcony.

256
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,600
I'll take it in the orchestra.
(Laughs)

257
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,401
Val: I'm sure you will.

258
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,837
Blaire: Jess. (Laughing)

259
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,919
Oh, my god! You're, like,
the only one that got that.

260
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,277
Blaire: Val.

261
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:47,912
Val: What?

262
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,434
Jess: Wait. What?
Blaire: Looking good.

263
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,949
Val: Thank you.

264
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,851
Blaire: (Chuckling) No. I got a
haircut, like, two days ago.

265
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:57,688
No. I mean, you look good right
now, too, but check your Facebook.

266
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,789
Val: What?

267
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,762
Blaire: These are
intense. Hold on.

268
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,364
Did you give Jess permission?
Jess! What the shit?

269
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,732
(Laughing) Dude!

270
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:08,899
Val: Why would you post that?

271
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,401
This is the first time
I'm seeing these.

272
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,902
These are incredible.

273
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:12,937
Val: Oh, my god. It just
came from your account.

274
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,405
I've never seen these before.
Jess!

275
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,606
These are amazing.

276
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,607
Val, I didn't know
you were so much fun.

277
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,476
Oh, my god! A bong?

278
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,479
Okay, seriously, I'm friends
with my mom on here.

279
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,580
All right. Val: Come on!

280
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:24,248
Ken: Should I look at these?

281
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,716
Is this worth a look? Val: What the hell!
Delete these!

282
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:26,984
Blaire: Jess, take these off.
They're not good.

283
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,119
Dude, I didn't...

284
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,453
Delete them, Jess.

285
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,389
I didn't do this, okay?

286
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,990
I don't know why you're
getting so pissed at me.

287
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,059
Oh, my god. You trashy little bitch.
Delete them.

288
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:37,995
Wait. Wait, did you
just call me trashy?

289
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,730
Are you serious? Yeah, Jess.

290
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,466
So, you're asking me for a fucking
favor, to take down these photos

291
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,934
that I didn't post in the
fucking first place...

292
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,470
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm asking for a favor?
I'm asking for...

293
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,005
You posted them. Yeah, I
didn't fucking do it, okay?

294
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,141
So you can be nice to me

295
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,809
and I can help you...
Mitch: You guys, shut up.

296
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,476
Blaire: Girls... Or you can
suck my fucking dick...

297
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,812
Val: You were the only one who
was at that fucking party.

298
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,681
Jess: And piss off. Ken: Whoa!

299
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,649
Close your trashy little mouth for,
like, one second and listen to me.

300
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,318
Blaire: Girls. Dude,
I will beat your ass

301
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,486
any goddamn day if you
come over here, bitch.

302
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,854
Val: Oh, I'm so sure.

303
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,589
I'm so sure. Blaire:
Listen, we are not ghetto.

304
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,191
No. Okay, how about
this? Mitch...

305
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,426
Blaire, really?

306
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,427
Do you want me to fucking
delete them or not?

307
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,028
Yes! Delete them now.

308
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,863
Look, I'll come
pick you girls up

309
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,632
and we can go fight outside
of a Wendy's or something...

310
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,835
Ken, not helping. Blaire: Ken.
Stop, you're not helping.

311
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,269
We can go to a taco
bell parking lot

312
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:19,370
and you guys can
slap-fight it out.

313
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,471
Jess: I'm deleting
them right now.

314
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,473
I'll pick both of you up.
Thank you, Jess.

315
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:23,541
Blaire: You wish.

316
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:24,675
(Laughing)

317
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,712
Ken: I am so wet right now.

318
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,113
Val: They're still here, Jess.

319
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,181
Jess: It's, like, not working.

320
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,782
Why are you so quick to assume

321
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,150
that I posted these
when I'm telling you...

322
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,685
Val: Who else would have?

323
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,121
Jess: I've never fucking seen
these photos before, okay?

324
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,857
Adam: Oh, my god! Shut up.

325
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,726
I try to hit delete,
and it disappears.

326
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,861
I reload the page,
it's still there.

327
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,896
I hit delete. I... I'm trying.

328
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:46,997
Ken: I have a headache.

329
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,232
I'm fucking trying to
help you. Okay, val?

330
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,935
You have a headache, Ken?
You have a headache?

331
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,071
Okay, it looks like
it's working.

332
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,906
Thank you.

333
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,209
Okay.

334
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,644
Unbelievable that you would
think that would be fine.

335
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:01,912
Okay, they're gone.

336
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,384
Ken: No, they're not.
Blaire: No. Adam...

337
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,585
You owe me a thank you.

338
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,353
Val: Adam! What the shit!
(Ken laughing)

339
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,654
Adam: What?

340
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:11,922
You posted some now, too?

341
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,524
Did you just copy
and paste them?

342
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:16,260
No. I didn't fucking post anything.
Jess: Holy shit!

343
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,662
Blaire: You guys need to stop.

344
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:21,332
I'm a bitch, Jess?
Adam: Chill out, val.

345
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,834
Don't... oh, you're doing
your nails right now.

346
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,237
Oh, you're so innocent.

347
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,072
I'm a bitch? Really?
Adam: Anger issues much?

348
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,607
Dude, I'm not even
fucking typing.

349
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,008
I don't know what to say.

350
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,943
What is happening right now?
What the fuck?

351
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,346
Okay, I've dated,
like, two guys.

352
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:37,548
I didn't type that.
Fuck you, okay?

353
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,549
I didn't type that.

354
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,117
Bullshit.

355
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,952
Ken: Hey, just... Somebody let
me know when it's fucking over.

356
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,221
I love that you think I'm a fucking
slut, and your ass is drunk...

357
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,290
I didn't type that!
Blaire: Girls, stop.

358
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,126
Please. Okay, yeah, blaire.

359
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:50,795
Just take Jess' side.
Of course.

360
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:53,931
I love you girls
so much. Let's be...

361
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,266
Oh, blaire, you're just
gonna take Jess' side?

362
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,967
I deserve that? No, I'm
not on Jess' side.

363
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,803
You just typed that. I don't think
she should have put these...

364
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,304
What?

365
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:01,572
No, I didn't type anything!

366
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:03,441
Oh, if you didn't type
it, then who did?

367
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,512
(Dog barking)

368
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,082
Well, who the fuck is Billie?

369
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,751
I told you I didn't
post those photos, val.

370
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,052
Guys, who is this?

371
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,287
I don't know. He was
here the whole time?

372
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,956
Blaire: Ken, you said
it was just a glitch.

373
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,392
Well, the glitch just typed!

374
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,300
(Dog barking)

375
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,769
Brucer.

376
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,471
Ken: Dude, I bet this guy's
been here the whole time.

377
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:36,807
Jess: I do not know a Billie,
but he apparently hates val.

378
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,642
This is Laura's account.

379
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,912
Ken: Are you sure?

380
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,647
(Stammering) I'm positive.

381
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:47,251
Val: Not Laura barns?

382
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,919
Yes, I'm still friends
with her on here.

383
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,088
I never, like, deleted it.

384
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:57,261
Jess: Seriously?

385
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,032
Who is doing this?

386
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,534
Ken: Uh...

387
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:07,104
Maybe it's Laura.

388
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,641
Ken.

389
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:12,009
Adam: Who hacks a dead girl?

390
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,379
Jess: Maybe it's her
brother or something.

391
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:16,847
Why would he do that, Jess?

392
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,349
Jess: He was a weirdo.

393
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,784
Not that weird!

394
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:46,577
Ken: It's probably just,
like, a troll or something.

395
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,345
What is a troll?

396
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,014
An Internet troll? Val: How do
you not know what a troll is?

397
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:52,149
Like, someone that just
harasses people online.

398
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,984
They just wanna get
reactions out of people.

399
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:59,557
Can we hang up on him?

400
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,358
Ken: No, I can't.
I can't hang up on him.

401
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,327
If we can't hang up... Fine,
I'll take care of him.

402
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,930
Hi, Billie, listen, sweetheart.

403
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,832
You're a fucking asshole, and if you
don't take these down right now,

404
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,902
I'll come over there and knock
the trash out of your ears!

405
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,609
Who the fuck is this guy?

406
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,852
Mitch: Okay.

407
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,554
All right, all right,
let's stop fucking around.

408
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,956
Everyone, hands up, right now.

409
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,124
Who's doing this?

410
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,527
Not me. Adam, here we go.

411
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,007
I told you it wasn't me, that's
all I can say. (Dog barking)

412
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,744
All right,
let's hang up on him.

413
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,379
Ken: There's, like, no...
There's no button.

414
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,981
Val: What do you mean?
There is no button.

415
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,115
Mitch: What do you mean?

416
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,517
There's no button
to hang up on him.

417
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,160
Val: Guys, he's, like,
sending me something.

418
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,662
(Dog continues barking)

419
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:17,501
Oh, my god!
Where did you get this?

420
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,337
(Distorted) This is fucked
up, do you hear me?

421
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,772
Brucer, shut up! Blaire:
Val, what is it?

422
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:23,173
Ken: Calm down, val.

423
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,175
No, I can't calm down,
this is messed up!

424
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,312
Jess: Aw, val, I told you
not to snapchat your boobs.

425
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,982
Val: Oh, really?

426
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,485
Really? That's a threat.
Yeah, you know what?

427
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,854
Yes, asshole, good news,
I'm calling the cops.

428
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,791
Congratulations, dipshit.

429
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,159
(Jess chuckles)

430
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,961
I'm calling.

431
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:45,429
Val, you don't need to call the
cops, all right? (Line ringing)

432
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,197
Just calm down. Val: Yes, I do.
I do need to call the cops.

433
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,699
Okay? It's a threat.

434
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:49,533
Hi. Hi. Um...

435
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,937
Um, listen, my name is
Valerie rommel, I'm online

436
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:56,473
and there's some asshole making
direct threats against me.

437
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,675
(Dog barking)

438
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,043
Brucer!

439
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,178
Ken: Yep. Val: Yeah. Hold...

440
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,114
Ken, I swear to god, if I find out
this is you, I will burn you alive.

441
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:06,116
You understand me? Ken: Are
you fucking kidding me?

442
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,052
Thanks for stopping by, val.

443
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:11,121
Real nice lady,
real nice chick.

444
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,290
She said she was gonna
burn me alive, dude.

445
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:16,894
Mitch: This isn't you, Jess?
Jess, it's not you?

446
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,696
No way. Not worth my time.

447
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,864
Adam: She can't do a powerpoint
presentation. How...

448
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,166
It's more... can't
really hear you, Adam.

449
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,868
More than likely, it's some
girl that she's pissed off,

450
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,070
and she's getting
fucking scared,

451
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,671
and she fucking deserves it.

452
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,239
I'm sorry. She takes a shit
on everyone at school.

453
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,875
Mitch: Should we take screen grabs
of the stuff that he was saying?

454
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,912
It's "Billie" with an I-e.
It's definitely a girl.

455
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,914
It's kind of
threatening, right?

456
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,382
He's been listening
this whole time.

457
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,583
Ken: It's not letting me
take a screen grab.

458
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,552
Mitch: Yeah, me neither.

459
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:42,820
Adam: Let's just get out of here.
Let's just hang up.

460
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,321
Ken: Let's just get out of here.
Let's just hang up.

461
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,990
All right. I'll see
you guys tomorrow. Hey!

462
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,225
Come over, Adam,
and we'll go see, uh...

463
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,728
Adam: Kyle? We'll go
across the tracks.

464
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,162
Adam: All right, I'm down.

465
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,231
Wait. Adam: What?

466
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,701
Blaire: I just got
an email from him.

467
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:58,902
Mitch: What is it?

468
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,705
Blaire: This is Laura's email.
Adam: What'd they say?

469
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,240
Blaire: It's a link.

470
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,942
Ken: It's just
a stupid troll, dude.

471
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:07,244
Obvious troll is obvious.

472
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,749
Just send it to Ken so he
can find out who it is.

473
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,183
Just forward it to me.

474
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:17,554
Yeah, let Ken, like, try to find
the ip address or something.

475
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:21,024
Okay, either I'm going crazy, or
there's no forwarding button.

476
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,926
Mitch: It's at the bottom, if you
click on, like, "reply all."

477
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,027
Blaire: No, I know where
it is, baby, but...

478
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,597
Mitch: You in gmail? Yeah.

479
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,199
Oh, my god, blaire, do you know
how to use a fucking computer?

480
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,868
Fucking open it! Blaire: I do.

481
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,870
Share me your screen.

482
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,039
Adam: Jesus.

483
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,307
Just forward the shit on to Ken

484
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,809
so we don't have to
deal with this again.

485
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,477
My god. Adam.

486
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,980
See, look.

487
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,048
It literally doesn't exist.
There's no "forward" button.

488
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,350
Do you see it?

489
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,323
Ken: No.

490
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:54,644
Jess: Dude, weird computer shit
happens to me all the time.

491
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,835
Click the fucking link, dude!

492
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,846
Ken: Yikes.

493
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:16,980
Blaire: Oh, val.

494
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,650
Val, you're fucking sick!

495
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:24,655
Ken: In Val's defense, her comment
wasn't completely unwarranted, okay?

496
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,290
Nobody wants to talk about it,

497
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,091
but I'll give you
the Ken-pinion.

498
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:29,626
Laura fucking sucked.

499
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,962
She was a big bully, okay,

500
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,084
and she deserved all the shit
she got from that video.

501
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,335
Ken, dude. Come on. (Laughs)

502
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,040
Blaire: Ken. What?

503
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,275
Ken: Sorry. I'm sorry,
that was in poor taste.

504
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,439
(Tone pinging)

505
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,615
Adam: "They should
lock you up."

506
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:40,751
"You monster"?

507
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,898
Adam: What the...

508
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,469
Okay, you're a fucking creeper.

509
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,371
What do you want?

510
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,379
Val, what'd the cops say?

511
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:11,481
Adam: What is it?

512
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,483
I think it's frozen.

513
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,085
(Dog barking)

514
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,590
Hey, val, you stupid
bitch, say something.

515
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,427
Adam: Did you guys
hear her call?

516
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,562
(Dog continues barking)

517
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:36,339
I'm calling her.

518
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:43,447
Adam: Guys, look at her mirror.

519
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,915
Ken: Do you guys see the mirror?
The mirror's fucked up.

520
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,450
Yeah.

521
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:48,018
What's going on over there?

522
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,819
(Line ringing)

523
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,587
Val!

524
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,655
Ken: Val?

525
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,958
Dude, maybe she's doing
this shit.

526
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,426
Like, for attention.
(Cell phone vibrating)

527
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,761
Mitch: Blaire, is it going through?
You think of that?

528
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,229
Yeah, I...

529
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:01,631
Look, look at it!
It's right there.

530
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:03,967
She's not...

531
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,869
Mitch: Holy shit.
(Continues vibrating)

532
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,170
Wait...

533
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,976
(Line ringing)
(Continues vibrating)

534
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,283
(Val screams)

535
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,152
Ken: What was that?
Mitch: Holy shit.

536
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:23,920
Adam: Shit. Val?

537
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:24,921
(Dog barking)

538
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:25,989
What?

539
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,259
Val!

540
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:31,228
Mitch: What the hell?

541
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,395
What just happened?
Jess: What's going on?

542
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,297
Did she close the computer?
Did it drop?

543
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,573
(Banging on door)

544
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,142
Man: Anyone home? Hello?

545
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,244
Hello? Blaire: Hello?

546
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,813
Ken: Hello? Mitch: Hey.

547
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:53,750
Man: Fresno county sheriff's office.
Somebody called 911?

548
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,586
(Door opens)

549
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,091
(Indistinct chatter)

550
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:02,759
Hello? Mitch: Can they hear us?

551
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,362
Hello, hey!
Down at the computer!

552
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:07,030
Hello? Hello?

553
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,798
Hey! Man: Dispatch, we got a...

554
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,267
Hello? Jess: Hello,
can you hear us?

555
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,668
Wait, what'd they say?

556
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,371
Ken: 10-35?

557
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,306
Mitch: I heard 10-25.
Which one?

558
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:18,475
Ken: 10-30. Mitch: 10-25.

559
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:21,411
What is that? 10-35...

560
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,615
No, it's a time check, so...
Mitch: That's insane.

561
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,917
(Indistinct radio chatter)

562
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,686
5250?

563
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,788
Mitch: 5250?
I didn't hear 5250.

564
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,326
No, it's a mental... (Gasps)

565
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,460
Mitch: No shit.

566
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:40,030
Val used to have seizures!

567
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,865
Man: Yeah, we'll start around the...
Guys, she...

568
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,633
Ken: Are you sure?
I don't remember.

569
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,236
Yeah, she told me,
like, a long time ago.

570
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,837
She had this sickness
that causes seizures.

571
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,472
Maybe she just had
a frickin' seizure.

572
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,708
Adam: Have you ever seen
her have a seizure, ever?

573
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,910
Man: Jesus. This is a 10-55.

574
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,845
No, dude, they said 10-55.

575
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,147
10-55?

576
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:58,081
Mitch: 10-55?

577
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,318
10-55...

578
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,154
10-55 is suicide.

579
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:06,189
Did they really just say 10-55?

580
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,324
(Jess screams)

581
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:08,425
Val? Jess: Oh, my god.

582
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:09,326
Mitch: Hey! Hey! Adam: Hey!

583
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:10,527
Hello? Hello?

584
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,696
Mitch: Shit. Adam: Shit.

585
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:13,930
Mitch: Okay.
All right, I'm calling.

586
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,265
Does anyone know
her parents' number?

587
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:16,667
Ken: I'll try to
get her back, okay?

588
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,953
Ken: Nobody accept.

589
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,689
No one accept it.

590
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,692
What...

591
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:22,966
Blaire: Who are you?

592
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,244
Blaire: What did
he send you guys?

593
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:35,045
What?

594
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,255
Ken: I can't fucking
shut it off.

595
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:51,161
We gotta get him out.

596
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,429
Mitch: Who cares? We have
to go over and help val.

597
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:53,697
Okay? We can do
this shit after.

598
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,598
Wait, wait, hold on.
The cops are with val.

599
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,133
Mitch: Yeah, we're
doing this shit after.

600
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,035
What's the point? Hold on.

601
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,104
What are you guys gonna do
that the cops can't do?

602
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,642
Fuck this! All right.
We're not doing this here.

603
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,011
Everyone, just fucking stop. Pick
up your phone, mute your computers.

604
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,045
I don't know where
my phone is, guys.

605
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,213
Seriously,
please don't do this.

606
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,181
Hold on, Jess...

607
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,615
(Inaudible)

608
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:13,950
(Breathing heavily)

609
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,557
Fuck, guys.

610
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,567
Guys?

611
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,701
Adam: Val's in five minutes.

612
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,470
Mitch: Whatever he's doing,
it can wait, okay?

613
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,691
Jess: Guys, I can hear you.
He can hear you.

614
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:36,973
He can turn your mics on.

615
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,008
Ken: Guys, can you just
fucking trust me, okay?

616
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,210
Install this program

617
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,011
and I'll find out who it is.
Mitch: You serious?

618
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,213
Adam: Who cares, dude?

619
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,581
Val's in fucking trouble.
You just saw her.

620
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,882
Mitch: Okay, everyone relax.

621
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:46,983
Blaire: Ken can
get him out, okay?

622
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,051
We need to stop this guy.

623
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,552
Jess: Please, Billie,
just let us leave, okay?

624
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,588
Ken: You guys wanna know
who this is or not?

625
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,224
Yeah, we're ready
to play, Billie.

626
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,825
Jess, we're gonna play a game.
What's going on, guys?

627
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,594
I don't know what's happening!
We're gonna play a game, okay?

628
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,763
You wanna play the game.

629
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:02,165
You wanna play the game. Jess,
you wanna play the game.

630
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:04,401
Jess: Okay.

631
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:05,835
Mitch: Okay, is it fixed?
Jess: What is it?

632
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,103
It's just a game.
We're just all

633
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,545
gonna download it
and play it, right?

634
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:14,110
I'm not doing anything, man. I
just wanted to play a game.

635
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:16,780
You like games.
You seem to like games.

636
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,515
Dude, I thought
we were gonna play.

637
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,950
All right. I have a fucking
great game for you, man.

638
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,685
Okay, you guys got it?
Blaire: Yeah.

639
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:26,089
Mitch: Okay.
I just launched it.

640
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:32,429
I got something
for you, Billie.

641
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,030
Ken: Fucking shit.

642
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,466
Okay, okay, okay.
Is it searching, guys?

643
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:37,901
Did everybody download it?
Blaire: Mine's got something.

644
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,636
Mine's got something.

645
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,539
Okay, good. Wait till
everybody got something.

646
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:46,309
Is it flagging? Has
everybody got some flags?

647
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:48,211
It should be more than one, too.
It should be multiple.

648
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:49,879
Jess: Yeah. Okay, cool.

649
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,648
Blaire: Yes. Okay, hit "trash."

650
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,551
Trash all of those and then empty
your recycling bins, okay?

651
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,586
Yeah, empty your recycling
bin after you trash it.

652
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:57,887
Do not save them.

653
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,689
Everything.
Everything that's flagged.

654
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,127
Mitch: It's not gonna
delete these.

655
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:07,130
Just fucking listen to me.
Trust me, dude.

656
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,998
Mitch: Shit. Shit. Jess: Okay.

657
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,052
(Stammering) Is it deleted?
What's going on?

658
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:12,101
Keep me updated, guys.

659
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,304
Okay. Okay, Adam's
is done. Mitch?

660
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,505
Mine's the same.

661
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:16,973
Okay, Jess? Mine's done.

662
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:17,907
Okay, blaire?

663
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:22,111
Blaire? Blaire! Mitch: Shit.

664
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:24,147
Blaire: There's a lot
in my recycling bin.

665
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,949
I don't know how to
make it go faster.

666
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,851
Mitch: What? Adam: I'm
gonna fucking kill you.

667
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,686
Adam, don't make him mad.

668
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:31,988
Mitch: She's right. Adam, you
are overreacting. He's got...

669
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,656
Ken: It's gonna be fine. We just need...
Blaire: Just stop.

670
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,024
We're just waiting
on Blaire's bin, guys.

671
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,694
Everything is gonna
be cool, I promise.

672
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:40,430
Blaire... There's a
pinwheel, I don't...

673
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,865
Why is he counting down?

674
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,933
Mitch: Don't listen to him. Don't
worry about it. Just get it done.

675
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,502
Ken: Okay. It's cool, blaire.

676
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,036
Blaire: All right, it's done!
Everything's... it's done.

677
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,439
Ken: It's done? It's done?
It's gone? Yes.

678
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:50,540
Adam: Thank god.

679
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,542
Is it gone? Is he out?

680
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:55,011
Mitch: Yeah. Yeah.
(Exhales deeply)

681
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,547
Fuck you, Billie. Suck on that, bitch!
(Ken tapping on table)

682
00:41:57,549 --> 00:42:00,116
Thank you, Ken.

683
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:02,652
Adam, you pulled out
a fucking gun!

684
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:04,888
Jess: Dude, what the hell was that?
(Laughing)

685
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,890
Mitch: Did you load that thing?
Yeah, man.

686
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:09,959
You were flinging it around!
It's going to go off.

687
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,294
Ken: Oh, my fucking god.
Mitch: I can't believe it.

688
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:12,996
Were you gonna shoot...
What were you gonna do,

689
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,064
shoot through the computer?

690
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,866
Guys! Guys, I saved your life.
We just...

691
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,701
Val used to get seizures.

692
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,036
I mean, that's the only thing

693
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,070
I can think of. Mitch:
We should call the cops.

694
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,338
Mitch: Okay.

695
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,374
I had a conversation
on my computer...

696
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,248
(Line ringing)

697
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:19,295
Female operator: (Over phone)
<i>911, please state your emergency.</i>

698
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:24,133
Adam: Yeah, hi, there's someone
threatening me and my friends online,

699
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:27,236
and they also threatened our
friend, Valerie rommel.

700
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,806
You sent some officers over
there earlier to her house,

701
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:31,574
but they didn't see
what we saw,

702
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:34,210
and there's a lot more
to the story. So...

703
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,579
<i>What is your friend's address?</i>

704
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:38,715
What? <i>Her address.</i>

705
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:40,883
Uh, guys?
Guys, what's her address?

706
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:43,620
Jess: Uh, hold on, I have
it in my desk. Hold on.

707
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:44,721
Adam: One sec.

708
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:50,460
Jess: 10705 east Bauer.

709
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,962
Adam: Yeah,
it's 10705 east Bauer.

710
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,497
And he keeps threatening us,

711
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:55,999
and he won't
leave us alone, and...

712
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:58,434
<i>Where are you right now, sir?</i>

713
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:01,904
Um, I'm at home.
Online, with my friends.

714
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:03,506
<i>Are you safe?</i>

715
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:04,674
Yeah.

716
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:05,742
<i>All of you?</i>

717
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:09,612
Yeah, we're good.

718
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,180
<i>Even Ken?</i>

719
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:12,348
What?

720
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,918
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

721
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,020
What?

722
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:18,182
Jess: But what just happened?

723
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:21,524
(Shushing)

724
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:27,096
<i>I said, "don't hang up."</i>

725
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,466
Blaire: Who did you call?

726
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:33,102
Fuck! It's this
fucking asshole!

727
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:52,021
Hey, genius, we can see you!

728
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,126
Hey! Hey, buddy!

729
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:02,365
Uh...

730
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,634
You know what?

731
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:08,037
What is that? It's
behind, like, a lattice?

732
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,073
Like, a crate
or something? Like...

733
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,308
It's not letting me hang up.

734
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,217
Jess: Wait, Ken! Ken!

735
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,519
Ken: What?

736
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:25,088
Wait, come back.

737
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,289
Ken: What?

738
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:28,658
Uh...

739
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,327
Back up a little bit.

740
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,396
Why? Just do it, dude.

741
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:54,851
(Thudding)

742
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:01,457
(Objects crashing)

743
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,863
(Scraping)

744
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,659
Ken, what the fuck's going on?

745
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:05,154
(Dialing)

746
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,222
(Line ringing)

747
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,232
Ken.

748
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:24,974
(Ken screaming)
Mitch: What the fuck?

749
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:26,342
Blaire: Ken? Ken?

750
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,584
Ken: Don't kill me!
Blaire: Ken!

751
00:47:29,814 --> 00:47:31,480
Jess: Is he okay?

752
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:32,815
Ken!

753
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:33,950
(Screaming)

754
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:35,351
Oh, my god! Ken! Ken...

755
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:38,154
Adam: Ken, come on!
Ken, stop fucking around!

756
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:39,755
Blaire: Oh, my god!
No! Don't...

757
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,658
Jess: Guys... Mitch: Holy shit!

758
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,726
Blaire: What was he doing?

759
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:46,062
Jess: (Crying) What the
fuck just happened? Ken?

760
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:48,965
Shut up, Jess! Just shut up!

761
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:51,868
Jess: What the fuck?
Adam: Shut up, Jess! Fuck!

762
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,502
This is so fucked up! Blaire:
This isn't funny anymore!

763
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:56,873
Adam: Fuck this shit! Okay? I'm
fucking out of here! You hear me?

764
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,140
(Door slams)

765
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:59,642
(Knock on door)

766
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:00,710
Adam: Fuck.

767
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,816
(Thud)

768
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:18,194
Adam: Fuck.

769
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:20,363
Hey, babe, go lock your door.
Go lock your door.

770
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:22,565
Blaire: What? I...
I think it is locked.

771
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:29,906
Adam: Hello?

772
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,576
Hello?

773
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:34,944
Oh, fuck.

774
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:44,086
What do you see? Adam?

775
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,022
Adam, what do you see?

776
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:47,456
Adam: Guys...

777
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:50,760
(Adam breathing heavily)

778
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:58,267
Adam: There's fucking
no one here.

779
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,870
I'm gonna go check it out.

780
00:49:00,872 --> 00:49:03,039
No, no, no. Don't. Don't.
Jess: No, don't do it.

781
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,373
No, Adam, no!
Jess: Don't go outside.

782
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,508
Adam: What? (Shushes)

783
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:07,743
(Knock on door)

784
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:09,312
Adam: What the...

785
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:14,083
Is it locked? Lock the door.

786
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:15,646
Lock your door.
Adam: Yeah, I fucking...

787
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:19,989
Who's there? Hey!

788
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:21,691
(Music playing in Adam's house)

789
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:24,994
Who's here?

790
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,165
I have a fucking gun!
You hear me?

791
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:32,134
(Loud thud)

792
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,637
Fuck. What the fuck?

793
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,884
What do you want?

794
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:58,527
Blaire: What video?

795
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:01,130
Val: <i> What the fuck?</i>

796
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:02,332
Boy: <i> You better slap that ho!</i>

797
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,133
Val: <i> Yeah, whore,</i>
<i>I will beat your ass.</i>

798
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,135
Laura: <i> You'll beat my ass?</i>
(Laughs)

799
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:08,371
<i>She's gonna beat</i>
<i>my ass, everybody!</i>

800
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:10,840
<i>Val is gonna beat my ass!</i>

801
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,341
<i>Val is gonna beat my ass!</i>

802
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,576
(Indistinct shouting)

803
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:19,115
Boy: <i> ...Slap that ho!</i>

804
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:21,083
<i>Slap that ho!</i>

805
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:24,453
Laura: <i> Val is gonna</i>
<i>beat my ass!</i>

806
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,155
<i>Beat my ass, everybody!</i>

807
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:27,723
(Videos playing at once)

808
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,205
Adam: No, this isn't on us, man.
Jess: This isn't our fault.

809
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:17,273
Adam: This is not on us.

810
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,759
(Adam breathing heavily)

811
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:48,063
Adam: What? What?

812
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,669
No. No, fuck this. I'm not...

813
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,305
I'm not fucking
playing any fucking...

814
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:58,140
(Thudding)

815
00:52:58,142 --> 00:53:00,242
Adam! Adam, stop!
Mitch: What? What?

816
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:14,356
Like the drinking game?

817
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:23,799
What? Wait, how do you play?
How do you play?

818
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:25,441
Mitch: I'm not playing
your fucking games.

819
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,837
Why don't you
fucking explain it.

820
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:30,906
It's your fucking game, man!

821
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,209
Somebody just tell me how to play!
Guys... Jess, how do you...

822
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:35,511
Dude, you... okay,
you put up five fingers,

823
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:36,979
and then if you've
done something,

824
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,781
you have to put
your finger down.

825
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:44,587
That's how it works.

826
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:53,796
This is the dumbest
fucking thing.

827
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,933
Wait. Why are you... why?

828
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,568
(Crying) I'm gonna lose.

829
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:03,299
Mitch: Are we doing this?
I don't wanna play.

830
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:10,946
Put your hands up. Put your hands up.
Put your hands up!

831
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,414
Just fucking do it.
Just fucking do it.

832
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,416
Fine, all right,
five fingers up, fine.

833
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,391
Who did that?

834
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:24,460
Wasn't fucking me.

835
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:27,616
Okay, fuck, it was me, okay?
(Buzzer sounds)

836
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,399
You said it was val.

837
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:32,568
Okay, I lied, all right?

838
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,136
You...

839
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:36,572
It's not like there's not
some kind of truth in there!

840
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:38,140
Jess, what are you doing?

841
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:39,708
Dude, it's not my fault! Why
are you doing that to me?

842
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,877
You're the one who's like, "I'm
not hungry, I already ate."

843
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,720
All that shit. Mitch: Do
not do this right now.

844
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:51,387
It wasn't fucking me.

845
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:52,888
It was one of you guys?

846
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,290
Mitch: Jess, stop it! Don't
attack people right now.

847
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,158
You know how much fucking
trouble I got in for that shit?

848
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,226
I'm sorry, it was me, okay?
(Buzzer sounds)

849
00:54:57,228 --> 00:54:58,327
We were drunk, and it happened,

850
00:54:58,329 --> 00:54:59,428
and I didn't know
how to tell you.

851
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,996
Fuck you! I'm sorry, Jess.

852
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:03,032
Fuck you!

853
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,401
Great friend, blaire.

854
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:06,935
I have apologized.

855
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:10,172
She's not apologized for starting
this rumor thing about me.

856
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:11,907
That is not true, by the way.

857
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,910
Hey! We're keeping
together on this. Stop it.

858
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,083
That was me. Easy.
(Buzzer sounds)

859
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,119
It was last year.
She kissed me.

860
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,654
I threw her off.
Nothing happened.

861
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,022
It's fine.

862
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:35,297
What? No, no, please tell me he's
lying, Jess, you fucking bitch!

863
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:37,032
Fuck you. It wasn't me, okay?
Shut up. Shut up!

864
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:39,034
Blaire? It was me, man.
Hey, it was me.

865
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,803
It was you? I'm sorry. Yeah.

866
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:42,504
What? Why? What do you mean, "what?
Why?"

867
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:43,806
Does it really fucking matter?

868
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:45,007
Yeah, it does to me, Mitch!

869
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,608
They put me in fucking handcuffs, man!
Guys, stop it!

870
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,610
I almost had a record!

871
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:51,046
My fucking dad almost
disowned me for that!

872
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:52,948
Dude, it was gonna be
both of us or one of us,

873
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,683
and I would do
the same shit for you.

874
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,318
So let me take the rap, huh?
Hey, it doesn't matter!

875
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,219
It doesn't matter!
Exactly, it doesn't matter!

876
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:58,721
Yeah?

877
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:00,356
Oh, my fucking hero, Mitch.
Hey! Knock it off!

878
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:01,724
My hero!

879
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:07,229
Oh, fuck. You guys
are fucked up, man!

880
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,997
Yeah, like you don't have
enough fucking money, okay?

881
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:11,800
Oh, keep it, bitch!
Fucking asshole.

882
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:13,702
Oh, yeah, let's listen
to blaire again,

883
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,071
'cause that keeps working
out so fucking well.

884
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:33,922
What?

885
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:38,260
Guys, are you serious?

886
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,829
None of us did that.
We wouldn't do that.

887
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:43,098
Blaire?

888
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,566
What?

889
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,201
Blaire, did you do that?

890
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:47,736
No!

891
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,338
How do we know?

892
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:52,508
Hey! It's not her.
It's not her.

893
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,376
I... we wouldn't do that. Put
down a finger and we'll see.

894
00:56:54,378 --> 00:56:56,512
She already said it.
Stop pushing her!

895
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:58,714
Yeah, I heard her say that! She
always tells the truth, Mitch?

896
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:00,015
Yeah! Yeah.

897
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,917
Oh, she does?

898
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,585
She always tells
the truth, right?

899
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,555
'Cause you always tell the
truth, right, blaire?

900
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:08,924
You always tell the truth.

901
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:19,568
Fine, it was me.

902
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,370
Adam, Jesus! You piece of shit!

903
00:57:21,372 --> 00:57:23,539
You're a fucking piece of shit.
You know that?

904
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,808
Oh, fuck you!
You're a piece of shit!

905
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,242
Jess: I'm just nothing to you, Adam.
You piece of shit.

906
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:29,144
Mitch, stop! Oh, fuck you!

907
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:31,580
He said if I traded you that
the three of us could live.

908
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:33,549
I was trying to save your life, Mitch.
Mitch: No!

909
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:35,117
(All talking at once)

910
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,792
Jess: I hate you! (Crying)

911
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,928
I hate you! I hate you, Adam!

912
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:49,465
'Cause you guys are all so
fucking perfect, right? Yeah?

913
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,233
Wait, wait, wait.
Guys, guys, guys.

914
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:53,068
Come on. Come on, please. Okay, okay.
All right. I see.

915
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,837
You know what? Fuck this.
Guys, come on.

916
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,405
Hey, I got an idea. Just
play the stupid game.

917
00:57:56,407 --> 00:58:00,309
Hey, Billie, why don't you lay off?
I got this one.

918
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:01,643
Jess: What the fuck
are you doing?

919
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,345
Easy one.

920
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:06,915
Never have I ever had sex.

921
00:58:08,419 --> 00:58:09,952
Hey, Billie, can we get
a timer, please?

922
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:11,653
What are you doing right now?

923
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,689
Oop! There goes my finger.

924
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:16,625
Hey, Jess, you only need
to put down one, not 50.

925
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:17,860
Fuck you, Adam.

926
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:20,596
Oh, okay. Whoa!

927
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:23,432
Hey, that's weird.
The timer's still going.

928
00:58:23,434 --> 00:58:25,890
Hey, Billie, why's the
timer still going, huh?

929
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:26,935
What are you doing?

930
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,604
Tick-tock...
What are you doing, Adam?

931
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:30,772
The round ain't over.
What are you doing?

932
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:34,376
Someone hasn't answered. Hello?

933
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:36,211
What are you...

934
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:38,313
I'm sorry.

935
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:40,716
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

936
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:42,784
I'm sorry, Mitch.

937
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,119
What do you mean?

938
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:46,555
Oh, okay, new question.
Blaire: I'm sorry...

939
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:49,291
Never have I ever

940
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:52,327
fucked my boyfriend's
best friend.

941
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,062
Blaire: What are
you doing, Adam?

942
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:56,131
There. You happy, blaire?
Why are you doing this?

943
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:58,400
What are you doing? Is he serious?
Mitchie, I'm so sorry.

944
00:58:58,402 --> 00:58:59,568
Don't... Jess: What?

945
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,669
Are you serious?
He's telling the truth?

946
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,337
God damn it, Adam!

947
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:03,839
What do you mean? What do you mean?
It was an accident.

948
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:05,974
It was an accident!
Mitch: It was an accident?

949
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:06,842
I didn't mean to do that, Adam.

950
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:07,910
Oh, my god!

951
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:09,745
I was drunk, okay? Oh, my god.

952
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:11,013
What were you doing?

953
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:12,481
It just...
I'm sorry, it just...

954
00:59:12,483 --> 00:59:14,917
How? How? I don't get it.
How? I hate you, Adam!

955
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:16,418
Fuck you, blaire.

956
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,221
Stop talking, Adam! Stop it!

957
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,757
But, hey, it doesn't
matter, remember, Mitch?

958
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:23,091
It doesn't
fucking matter, right?

959
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:25,894
It does matter.
It does matter, because...

960
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,764
We might all fucking die, but we're
better than you, you piece of shit!

961
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:31,099
(Music playing)

962
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,503
Blaire: Guys, stop.
Guys, please stop.

963
00:59:34,505 --> 00:59:36,672
(All arguing)

964
00:59:44,348 --> 00:59:46,615
Jess: Any other guy I liked
treated me like shit.

965
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:48,517
Mitch: I'm gonna fucking win this thing.
I'm gonna win this thing.

966
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:51,119
Never... never have I ever...
Everyone's hands up!

967
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:53,589
We're still playing!
We're still playing here!

968
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:56,425
Never have I ever
roofied Ashley Dane!

969
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:58,727
Fuck you, man! Okay?

970
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:00,195
Guys, what are we doing?

971
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:01,730
Oh, look at that! Finger's down!
We were drunk.

972
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:02,965
She's a fucking liar.
Look at that!

973
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:04,533
That's how you wanna play?

974
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:06,234
All right. Fine. Guys, come on.
Please, let's stop!

975
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,636
Don't talk to me.

976
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:09,271
I don't wanna hear from you, slut.
Fucking slut.

977
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,073
Please don't call me that.
Do not call me that.

978
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:13,742
How many guys, huh?
How many guys?

979
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:17,245
No more, I swear! Do you think I'm a slut?
Are you kidding me?

980
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:20,182
Oh, you swear? Like you
swore you love me?

981
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:24,586
No! Mitchie, I love you!

982
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:26,054
Perfect fucking blaire.

983
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:27,489
It only... You don't even know!

984
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:28,890
It only lasted, like, a second!

985
01:00:28,892 --> 01:00:30,325
Oh, fuck you, blaire!

986
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:32,227
Why would you tell me that?
Right, Adam? It only...

987
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:34,162
Why would you tell me that?
That doesn't make shit better.

988
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:37,399
I'm sorry, baby. I don't know
what else to say. I'm sorry.

989
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:38,900
Mitch, I... Mitch: Fucking...

990
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:43,472
Never... never have I ever forced
Ashley Dane to get an abortion!

991
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:46,341
Stop doing this, guys. I'm sorry, okay?
Everybody just...

992
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:48,143
Oh, it's four! It's four!

993
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,444
What are you...

994
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,980
don't fucking do this, man.
It's four.

995
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,116
Fuck you! You fucking
took my girl,

996
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:55,651
and you took her for yourself.

997
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,319
No, he didn't. I'm still...
It wasn't like that, man.

998
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,754
It wasn't like that! Mitch...

999
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:00,288
It wasn't? It wasn't like that?

1000
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,923
Adam: No, it wasn't!
It fucking wasn't!

1001
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:10,332
Blaire: (Crying)
Why is this happening?

1002
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,534
Why are you showing this?

1003
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,536
Mitchie, don't watch!

1004
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:16,338
Just don't watch, okay?

1005
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,775
Don't read into her shit,
okay? Don't watch.

1006
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:24,212
It didn't... Baby, it didn't
mean anything. I love you.

1007
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:28,316
Stop watching. Look at me, Mitch.
Mitch, look at me!

1008
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,185
I didn't mean it.

1009
01:01:30,554 --> 01:01:32,020
Guys?

1010
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,623
We were drunk, Mitch, okay?
It was my birthday.

1011
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:37,759
Oh, fuck you! I sent you a
fucking card, you piece of shit.

1012
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,130
Jess: No!

1013
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:44,466
No! Bullshit. Fuck you!

1014
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:46,635
I'm ready for you,
motherfucker!

1015
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:49,371
You hear me?
I'm fucking ready for you!

1016
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:53,308
Come on over! Now!
I'll fucking kill you!

1017
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,477
I'm gonna...

1018
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:56,311
(Printer whirring)

1019
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:58,280
Fuck.

1020
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:05,387
It's my printer.

1021
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:11,927
Fuck!

1022
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:13,895
What? What, Adam? Fuck!

1023
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,363
What is it? Mitch: What is it?

1024
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:17,933
Adam: Fuck. What is it?
What is it?

1025
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:19,901
It says I'm not supposed
to tell you what it says.

1026
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:23,705
Oh, come on, Adam. Don't do this to us.
Don't do this to us!

1027
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:24,940
Please don't do this to us!

1028
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,110
Jess: What's it say?
(Printer whirring)

1029
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:29,911
Tell us right now,
you piece of shit.

1030
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,913
You fucked my girl.

1031
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,615
I fucking told you I loved you.
You fucked her. Fuck...

1032
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:35,684
Oh, Mitch. You're never
gonna find out, okay?

1033
01:02:35,686 --> 01:02:39,187
So get your narrow fucking
head around that, you hear me?

1034
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:47,162
What's it say?

1035
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:49,030
Mitch: What is it?

1036
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:50,265
I can't. Adam: Fuck.

1037
01:02:51,702 --> 01:02:53,201
I can't.

1038
01:02:53,704 --> 01:02:55,904
I can't.

1039
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:59,207
You can't? Oh, Adam and blaire
with another fucking secret.

1040
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:00,642
No, no, no. No. It's
not like that, man.

1041
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:02,310
It's not like that. You
don't understand, okay?

1042
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:03,211
Mitch: I'm fucking finished.
I'm signing off.

1043
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,312
Mitch, it's not
like that, baby.

1044
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:06,581
No, no, no! She'll kill you!

1045
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,116
She'll kill you. Stop it!
You're gonna kill me?

1046
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,317
Hey, if you're gonna kill me,

1047
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:11,119
you better fucking
kill me right now!

1048
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,155
No! Stop, baby, okay?
Mitch. Mitch...

1049
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:16,458
Just calm down. Just calm down, okay?
...Just calm down, okay, man?

1050
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,893
Everybody just calm down.

1051
01:03:17,895 --> 01:03:20,462
Okay? Everybody just...

1052
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:22,964
Baby? It's okay. It's...

1053
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,467
I'm sorry. I can't tell you.

1054
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,569
Mitch: Look at me. Look at me.

1055
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:30,772
You have one minute.
Say what you want.

1056
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:32,941
What?

1057
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:36,912
Okay, okay, okay.
It, um... it just...

1058
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:39,948
We met up one more time to see

1059
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:42,517
if it was a fluke or
something more, okay?

1060
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,352
Okay. Where was this?
Adam: It was at my house.

1061
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,454
You shut up! Shh... Adam.

1062
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:48,757
Where? When? Just let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.

1063
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:53,028
It was in September right before
we went back to school, okay?

1064
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,763
We just...

1065
01:03:54,765 --> 01:03:57,532
We started to do it,
but then we stopped

1066
01:03:57,534 --> 01:03:59,668
because it was
really clear, okay?

1067
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,436
It didn't... It didn't...
She's not lying, man.

1068
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,805
Shut up! Shut up! Adam, stop.

1069
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:06,875
Did he touch you again? Did he
touch you again down there?

1070
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:09,010
Just for a second, okay?
Just for a second.

1071
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,846
Adam: She's not lying,
Mitch. She's not, okay?

1072
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:13,648
Okay? Mitch: Now
show me the paper.

1073
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,217
You don't want me to
show you the paper.

1074
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:16,952
No, I do, blaire.
Show me the paper.

1075
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:19,120
No, Mitch, why are you doing this?
No more fucking secrets.

1076
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:21,156
Blaire, I'm not fucking around.
Show me the paper.

1077
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:22,457
Or I walk!

1078
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,059
No, no, no!
Please don't leave me!

1079
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:27,295
That's it, blaire. Show me the paper...
You gotta understand...

1080
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:30,866
Mitch: I'm not fucking around, here!
Show me that paper!

1081
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:32,667
Sit the fuck...
Get back here, Mitch!

1082
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:35,670
Blaire: What are you... No, no, no!
Mitch, come back here! No!

1083
01:04:35,672 --> 01:04:37,706
Blaire: Oh, my god!

1084
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,708
(Rapid beeping)
(Jess screaming)

1085
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,144
No! No! No!

1086
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,582
Jess: Adam!

1087
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,488
You stupid bitch!

1088
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,258
I'm sorry, Jess.
You killed him.

1089
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,325
(Both crying)

1090
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,963
I didn't know what to do.

1091
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:09,170
Male automated voice: <i>Hello.
Can I share a secret with you?</i>

1092
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:12,540
<i>It's just three words.</i>
<i>Free live cams.</i>

1093
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:14,743
<i>Free live cams</i>
<i>are the absolute best.</i>

1094
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,678
<i>Having beautiful women</i>
<i>all over the Internet</i>

1095
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,713
<i>just waiting to fulfill your every desire.
</i> Blaire: No.

1096
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:20,215
<i>There's simply nothing</i>
<i>better than that.</i>

1097
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:22,517
Blaire: I'm not gonna
just sit here, guys.

1098
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:25,120
Adam... Adam was right, okay?

1099
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:28,523
We can't listen to her. I'm gonna
make this right, guys, okay?

1100
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,426
I didn't do anything.

1101
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,161
Jess, just do not answer,
do not give in!

1102
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:36,598
What?

1103
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,368
Don't answer. Whatever
you do, do not answer.

1104
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,604
(Loud thud) (Screaming)

1105
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:45,941
Oh, my god! Jess? Jess, just run.
(Loud thud)

1106
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:48,576
Just hide, Jess. Just hide
in your bathroom. (Crying)

1107
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,612
I'm gonna get you help!

1108
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,147
(Banging on door)

1109
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:00,455
God.

1110
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:09,597
Yes! Okay. Hi!
Guys, listen, look at me!

1111
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,833
Hey, look at me. Hi, hi.

1112
01:06:11,835 --> 01:06:16,004

1113
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:18,239

1117
01:06:31,922 --> 01:06:34,022
Hello?

1118
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:35,090
No.

1119
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:40,829
Hi. Hi.

1120
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:47,669
Can you hear me?
Hi, can you hear me?

1121
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:51,806
Hi. Hi. My name is blaire Lily, and...
No! Shit!

1122
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:53,475
You want some? Hi. You want some?
Hi!

1123
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:55,443
Hey, guys! Hello! Rando: Hey.

1124
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:56,678
Hi. Can you hear me?

1125
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,446
Rando: Hey.
Something is happening...

1126
01:06:58,448 --> 01:06:59,714
Rando: Something is happening.

1127
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:00,949
Dank: Can I tell you...

1128
01:07:00,951 --> 01:07:04,185
It's happening right now.
Hey! Just...

1129
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,221
I am being attacked!
Dank: She's saying...

1130
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:08,056
I need you to call the police!

1131
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:10,191
Rando: Shut up! She's being attacked!
Please.

1132
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,993
Police, yes, the police.

1133
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:13,661
Dank: We're gonna call the police.
I will do anything you want.

1134
01:07:13,663 --> 01:07:15,196
Dial the Fresno, California...

1135
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,865
Dank: Police. Please call them.
Police!

1136
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,099
Police! Stop being pricks!

1137
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:21,102
Oh, god!

1138
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:28,476
Hello? Can you help me?

1139
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:30,478
Are you okay? I... listen, I...

1140
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,013
There's something happening.

1141
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:34,716
Like, my friend is being attacked.
She needs your help.

1142
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:36,017
How can I help? Can I help you?

1143
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:37,385
Yes, yes.

1144
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:41,322
Can you call the Fresno, California
police and tell them that...

1145
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:44,492
My name is blaire Lily.
Look, here's her address.

1146
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:46,027
Look, look.
Here's her address...

1147
01:07:46,029 --> 01:07:46,961
Okay, one second.

1148
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,497
Okay. Here.

1149
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:52,834
Okay, one minute.

1150
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:54,736
4478 Winslow Avenue.

1151
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:56,071
Hi, there's this girl,
and she's online,

1152
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:58,106
and she says that there's
someone attacking her.

1153
01:07:58,108 --> 01:08:00,108
She's in Fresno, California.

1154
01:08:01,044 --> 01:08:02,710
Who's attacking you?

1155
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:05,013
Who? I don't know.

1156
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:06,915
There's something in my house...
She's just yelling a lot.

1157
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:08,416
And we're being attacked.

1158
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,919
She says there's something in her
house and she's being attacked,

1159
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:13,621
and it's her boyfriend
and all of her friends.

1160
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,792
Just tell them to
come to that address.

1161
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:19,360
You know who's attacking you?

1162
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:21,296
Okay. She says just
come to the address.

1163
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:23,498
Wait, what is it again?

1164
01:08:24,134 --> 01:08:25,467
What's the address?

1165
01:08:25,469 --> 01:08:27,268
Yes, I'll tell... I'm sending
it to you right now.

1166
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,470
Sorry, one minute.

1167
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:33,341
I... I just...

1168
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:36,077
Come on!

1169
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:40,615
Okay. So the address
is 4478 Winslow Avenue.

1170
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,317
And she said it was
in Fresno, California.

1171
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,652
Just tell them to get here!
Are they coming?

1172
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:48,723
Are you...
They're going to send a car.

1173
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,925
They are? They are? Thank you!

1174
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:52,494
Okay.

1175
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:54,596
Okay, great. Yeah, they said
they're five minutes away.

1176
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:57,832
They're five minutes?
Okay. Okay.

1177
01:08:57,834 --> 01:09:00,835
Okay, Jess. There's a car coming.
The cops are coming.

1178
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,504
They're going to be
there in 5 minutes.

1179
01:09:02,506 --> 01:09:04,839
Why are they taking so much...
The cops are coming.

1180
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:09,511
Blaire: (Softly) What?

1181
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:12,080
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Jess?

1182
01:09:12,082 --> 01:09:15,717
Jess! Jess! Just run. Jess,
just run, okay? Just...

1183
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:20,355
(Mumbling)

1184
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:24,859
(Jess screaming)

1185
01:09:29,099 --> 01:09:30,598
Blaire: Jess!

1186
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,844
No. Jess? Jess?

1187
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:43,678
(Choking)

1188
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:50,685
No! No! Oh, my god!

1189
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:56,057
What?

1190
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:07,735
I'm so...

1191
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:15,410
(Screams)

1192
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:16,711
(Distorted) Oh, my god!

1193
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:20,315
(Speaking indistinctly)

1194
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,318
Mitch? (Clattering)

1195
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,322
Oh, my god.

1196
01:10:28,358 --> 01:10:30,091
(Breathing heavily)

1197
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:33,261
Oh, my god!

1198
01:10:33,263 --> 01:10:34,729
(Muffled breathing)

1199
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,671
What are you doing?

1200
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:07,829
(Both sobbing)

1201
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:13,001
Mitchie.

1202
01:11:14,638 --> 01:11:15,837
(Knock on door)

1203
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:20,608
Blaire: Do you see...

1204
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:36,591
Blaire: Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
(Alarm beeping)

1205
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:37,825
(Music playing)

1206
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:43,298
What is that?

1207
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:49,437
It's an alarm I set for tomorrow.
We have a test.

1208
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:51,806
We do? Yeah, it's...

1209
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,877
Mitch, do you hate me?

1210
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:59,180
I don't hate you, blaire.

1211
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:00,448
You don't?
No, I don't hate you.

1212
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,849
I love you so much.

1213
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:03,151
I love you.

1214
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,359
That wasn't us, Laura!

1215
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:13,127
Laura, please.

1216
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:16,197
It was not us, I promise you.
It wasn't us.

1217
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,265
It wasn't us.

1218
01:12:21,104 --> 01:12:23,204
Please, Laura. It wasn't us!

1219
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:29,377
Blaire: I'm scared.

1220
01:12:29,379 --> 01:12:32,447
Mitch: Laura, I promise you.

1221
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:48,262
(Blaire whimpering)

1222
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:32,140
Mitch! (Grunts)

1223
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:36,778
(Screaming)

1224
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:42,450
Why did you do... Mitch? Mitch?

1225
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,421
Mitch!

1226
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:48,022
(Music playing)

1227
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:49,791
What?

1228
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:52,260
Guys, I'm so sorry!

1229
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:55,797
Why did you do that?
What... who was...

1230
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:02,103
What?

1231
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,972
What?

1232
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:09,110
(Timer counting down)

1233
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:16,317
No, no, no. Why are you
still counting down?

1234
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:17,618
Why are you...

1235
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:21,889
What do you want from me?

1236
01:14:21,891 --> 01:14:23,958
What do you think I did?

1237
01:14:25,562 --> 01:14:27,128
(Blaire sniffling)

1238
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:34,402
We were sisters, Laura.
Don't you know it?

1239
01:14:34,404 --> 01:14:36,337
I loved you.

1240
01:14:36,339 --> 01:14:37,705
Look.

1241
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:41,909
Look at us.
No, look at us. Look!

1242
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:42,977
Look at us.

1243
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:47,915
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

1244
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,389
I'm so sorry we drifted apart.

1245
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:03,698
What?

1246
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:11,072
(Countdown stops)

1247
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,346
No!

1248
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:47,041
<i>I got her.</i> (Laughing)

1249
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:49,076
I'm sorry.

1250
01:16:28,718 --> 01:16:30,284
(Door creaking)

1251
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:33,921
Blaire: No!

1252
01:16:35,692 --> 01:16:36,691
(Softly) Laura?

1253
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,259
(Screaming)
