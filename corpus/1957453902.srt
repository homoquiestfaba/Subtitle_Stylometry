[Becca screams]

7
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,070
[Joyce] Oh, God. What was that?

8
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,573
[Becca screams]

9
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:12,874
- [Sam] Becca.
- [Joyce] Sam?

10
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,274
[Sam] Call the cops.

11
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,264
[Becca cries]

12
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,735
- [Becca cries]
- [Sam] It's okay.

13
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,571
It's okay.

00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,506

17
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,182
[Sam] It's okay.

18
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:56,684
It's okay.

00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,807
[officer] Has your daughter
ever mentioned

22
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,043
anyone following her before?

23
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,513
Maybe some threatening calls
or text messages?

24
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:07,682
[Sam] Hey, Rebecca?

25
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,984
Has anybody been bothering you?

26
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:13,688
Rebecca?

27
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,556
Becca?

28
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,393
Has anybody been bothering you
at school?

29
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,797
Has anything happened
strange online?

30
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,333
No. Nothing.

31
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,044
- [Becca] Goodnight, dad.
- [Sam] Goodnight.

32
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:38,713
Sleep well.

33
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,618
Becca, what were
you doing up, anyway?

34
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,754
[Becca] I was just getting
a glass of water.

35
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,055
[phone vibrates]

36
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,957
Who's that?

37
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,828
It's nothing,
it's just Layne calling me.

38
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,097
He's calling you
at four in the morning?

39
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,665
[Becca] I don't know, Dad.

40
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,399
Probably to see if I'm okay.

41
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,434
How'd he know something's wrong?

42
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,470
[Joyce] Sam, let's just let...

43
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,939
- [Sam] I...
- [Becca] Dad!

44
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,074
I'm just gonna tell him
not to call so late.

45
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,047
Can I have it back?

46
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,986
If he calls back, tell him
you'll see him tomorrow.

47
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,555
Go to bed.

48
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,523
- [Becca] Goodnight, Dad.
- [Sam] Goodnight.

49
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,529
What, Joyce?

50
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,463
Well done, Sam.

51
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,066
After everything
she's been through,

52
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,001
you still have to do
that to her?

53
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:37,437
Why would he be calling so late?
She's probably tryna sneak out.

54
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,840
Why didn't you tell the police

55
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:40,675
about your car getting
broken into last...

56
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,643
Because it probably didn't have
anything to do with this.

57
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,045
It's probably just some

58
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,047
neighborhood junkies
breaking into cars,

59
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,582
or this Layne kid
for all we know.

60
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,517
Ah, so that's
what you're becoming?

61
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,953
Stereotypical
boyfriend hating dad.

62
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:55,455
I'll start liking her boyfriends
when she stops dating losers.

63
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,725
This Layne kid just rubs me
the wrong way.

64
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,961
And why would an 18 year old
wanna date a 16 year old,

65
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:01,629
- is beyond me.
- Okay, you know what?

66
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,664
I cannot have
this conversation tonight.

67
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,934
When you come to bed, will you
please leave the lights on?

68
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,503
I gotta be at work
in a few hours, anyway.

69
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,572
I'll get dressed
and get out of here.

70
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,908
You're going into work?

71
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:15,943
Call it off. They'll get it.

72
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:18,378
I've got an important
presentation this morning.

73
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,481
Look, I'll just make it
a half day.

74
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,650
Okay?

75
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:24,986
[Joyce] Okay.

76
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,455
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

77
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,099
<i>I love you.</i>

78
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,008
So, is that it, Sam?

79
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,185
Look, I get it.

80
00:06:58,586 --> 00:06:59,854
I understand.

81
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:04,625
And I enjoyed whatever this was.

82
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:06,861
A fling.

83
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,131
A mistake, whatever.

84
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,966
[Sam] I knew what I was doing.

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,434
And it wasn't a mistake.

86
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,875
It's just over.

87
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,695
[suspenseful music]

88
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:46,200
[Mel] So, do you wanna talk
about what happened last night?

89
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,770
[Becca] No. To be honest,
I'd rather not.

90
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,640
[Mel] Yeah. I get it.

91
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,609
I'm sorry, but you gotta
clean your car.

92
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:56,677
It stinks so bad.

93
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:59,146
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

94
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,083
What happened
after the cops got there?

95
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:03,818
- Did they catch the guy?
- No.

96
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,286
They told my dad
they'd let us know

97
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,154
if there were
any other break-ins.

98
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,623
They just sat outside all night.

99
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,759
Why? Are they gonna sit
outside tonight too?

100
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:12,960
I don't know. Maybe?

101
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:17,231
Maybe I could
come over after school.

102
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,768
I don't think
that's gonna be a good idea.

103
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,603
[school bell rings]

104
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,005
Come on. I'm freezing!

105
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:28,976
[Mel indistinct]

106
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:48,662
[background chatter]

107
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,164
Morning, Sam.

108
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,298
[Sam] Morning.

109
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,642
[suspenseful music]

110
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,735
[knocking]

111
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:28,936
- [Chris] Hey, bud. What's up?
- [Sam] Hey.

112
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,271
Morning, Chris.

113
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,940
Sorry. I didn't mean
to startle you.

114
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,675
[Sam]
No, that's okay. I'm just...

115
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,677
still a little jumpy
from this morning.

116
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,313
Yeah. Joyce called me
on the drive this morning,

117
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,183
and filled me in.

118
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,019
You guys gonna be okay?

119
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,654
[Sam]
Yeah, I think we'll be good.

120
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:47,988
You know, the police
are doing their thing.

121
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,990
They're just searching
for a lead.

122
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:50,991
How's Becca?

123
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:54,795
She's shaken up,
but she's tough.

124
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:56,897
You know,
I think she'll be okay.

125
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,666
She's a tough cookie, that one.

126
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,801
A true badass,
just like her mom.

127
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:04,205
Well, you just
make sure to take care

128
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:05,706
of my sister
and my niece, there.

129
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,208
You got it, chief.

130
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,377
[Chris] One more thing.

131
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,080
This weekend.

132
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:15,015
It's Aaron's baptism on Sunday.

133
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,151
You guys still...?

134
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,285
Yeah. Of course, Chris.

135
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,187
Okay.

136
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,989
Well, you let me know
if you need anything,

137
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,757
and I'll be seeing you
in the meeting.

138
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,127
Alright.
I will see you in there.

139
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,384
[phone rings]

140
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,825
Hey.

141
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,260
[Joyce] Hey, hon.

142
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,995
<i>You talked to Chris yet
this morning?</i>

143
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,696
[Sam] Yeah. Actually,
he was just in here.

144
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,032
Okay. I didn't want
to give him an answer

145
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,401
until after I had talked
to you about it.

146
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:08,836
What did you tell him?

147
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:10,838
I said we'd be there.

148
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,773
You sure?

149
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,342
- Cause we don't have to go.
- [Sam] <i>Joyce, look.</i>

150
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:16,777
<i>It's your brother's
kid, alright?</i>

151
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,045
<i>We'll make it work.</i>

152
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,947
You promise you're okay with it?

153
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,916
[Sam] <i>Yeah. I mean,
the only thing we have left</i>

154
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,484
<i>is the mess in the kitchen.</i>

155
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:26,086
Actually, I got most of it
cleaned up already.

156
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,255
- [Sam] <i>Really?</i>
- Yeah.

157
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:31,125
A little too slow
to the draw there, slick.

158
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,293
[Joyce laughs]

159
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,795
You can make it up to me
if you pick up dinner

160
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,163
on the way home, okay?

161
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:37,364
Love you.

162
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,072
[school bell rings]

163
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,054
[Mel coughs]

164
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,790
[Mel] Becca, I'm sorry,
but your car stinks so bad.

165
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,892
[Mel coughs]

166
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,898
[Becca] God. It smells like
something's dead.

167
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,838
[Mel] It's worse than it was
this morning.

168
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,007
[Becca] Look to see if there's
anything on the floor.

169
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,509
[Mel] Okay. No.

170
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:23,310
No, I don't see anything.

171
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:24,812
There's nothing down here
that can smell like that.

172
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,447
- That smells like death.
- [Rebeca] God.

173
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,215
What the hell is that?

174
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,050
[Mel coughs]

175
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,986
I can't do this.
Can you pull over?

176
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,188
[Becca] Okay. Okay, fine.
Just give me a second.

177
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,331
[both gag]

178
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,402
[Becca] Oh, God.

179
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,991
[phone ringing]

180
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,028
Hey, Bec. What's up?

181
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,162
[Becca] <i>Mom?</i>

182
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,264
Bec?

183
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:19,133
[Becca vomits]

184
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,336
[Joyce] <i>What's going on?</i>

185
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,105
<i>Just tell me what happened.</i>

186
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,044
[phone rings]

187
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,413
Did you tell anyone?

188
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:34,281
- Why would I do that?
- Did you?

189
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:36,050
Believe it or not,
it's not worth

190
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,951
screwing my life up
either, okay?

191
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,087
I got pictures of us
sent to me this morning.

192
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:42,590
What?

193
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:44,224
Someone emailed me
pictures of us

194
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,193
in your apartment this morning.

195
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,396
Did they say or want anything?

196
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,598
No.

197
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,600
You don't think
that she would hire

198
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:54,168
a private investigator, do you?

199
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,337
No. I don't think
that's what this is.

200
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,405
Look, I just wanna
forget about this.

201
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,474
I just made a mistake.

202
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,176
[phone beeps]

203
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,883
What?

204
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:15,255
Look, I have to go.
Alright? Just be cautious.

205
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,593
I think you're the one
that needs to be cautious, Sam.

206
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,103
[Sam] Jesus, Bec. Are you okay?

207
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,171
When would they have put
it in there?

208
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,610
Last night
or maybe today at school?

209
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,181
Has Layne been messing with you?

210
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:44,985
Okay, Dad.

211
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,155
Yeah, he broke in too,
and tried to kill me.

212
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,190
Why the fuck would he put
a deer in my car?

213
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,492
Hey, watch your mouth!

214
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,026
[Joyce] Hey, both of you,
stop it!

215
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,631
You're making a scene in
the middle of a police station.

216
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,470
Honey, why don't you go
check on Melanie?

217
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,707
I just saw her
walk in the lounge

218
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,174
with her mom and dad, okay?

219
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,377
Okay.

220
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:16,183
- Becca, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

221
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:21,121
[Sam] Hey, who's that?

222
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,691
She's a detective.

223
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,093
She talked to us
when we first got here.

224
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,195
She wants to talk to you, too.

225
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,296
Me? Why?

226
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,565
Mr. Hodges?

227
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,299
I'm Detective Savannah Simpson.

228
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,967
May I speak with you
in my office?

229
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,068
[Sam] Yeah.

230
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:38,706
[Savannah] Have a seat.

231
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,542
[Sam] So, did you need

232
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:43,043
another report
on what happened last night?

233
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,979
I wanted to ask,
in your opinion,

234
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,649
if you think that your daughter
might have a stalker?

235
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,384
Rebecca?

236
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,386
Or an ex-boyfriend
that ever was a problem?

237
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:54,154
You think Rebecca has a stalker?

238
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:55,623
Or maybe you?

239
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:01,195
In my opinion, this person
went through a lot of trouble

240
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,731
to break in,
only to steal nothing,

241
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,700
and to secretly open
Rebecca's car

242
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,635
and leave a dead animal inside.

243
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:10,370
No notes. No threats.

244
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,741
Which is why I wanted to ask you

245
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:16,544
if you think
you might have any enemies,

246
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,746
or someone who might be
upset with you.

247
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,651
Well, I did get
an email this morning.

248
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,453
An email?

249
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:30,491
Yeah. Someone talking about
my house in a suspicious way.

250
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:31,526
Really?

251
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,528
Did it say anything else?

252
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,395
Can you send me this email?

253
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,064
No. I deleted it.

254
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,601
You deleted it?

255
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,235
Yep.

256
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,103
Any reason why?

257
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:45,305
Well, it just freaked me out
a little bit,

258
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,742
and just wanted to forget
about it.

259
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,746
Okay. Well, maybe we can
log into your email

260
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,581
and you can archive it
from there.

261
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:55,182
[Sam] No, you can't.

262
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,484
No?

263
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:01,288
I cleared the trash bin.

264
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,457
And there's a lot of sensitive
work material, so...

265
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,563
Was that wrong of me?

266
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,332
No. No, it's okay.

267
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,769
Just gonna make my job
a little harder.

268
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:17,170
Yeah, sorry about that.

269
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,306
Well, if you do get another one,

270
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,475
can you please send it to me?

271
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,113
May be our only shot
at catching this guy.

272
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:28,148
[Sam] Thank you.

273
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:47,835
[soft thud]

274
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,676
[soft thud]

275
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,617
[creaking]

276
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,737
[knocking on door]

277
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,838
Becca?

278
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,574
[knocking on door] Rebecca?

279
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:29,109
- [Becca mumbles]
- [Sam] Hey, open up real quick.

280
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,278
[Becca grunts]

281
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:39,087
[Becca yawns]

282
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:40,922
What, Dad?

283
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,590
Is someone in here with you?

284
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:43,758
What?

285
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,660
[soft thud]

286
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:48,462
What was that?

287
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:50,898
Go to our room.

288
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,200
Shouldn't you call the cops?

289
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,469
No, not yet.
I'm gonna go check it out.

290
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:57,839
Tell your mother
what's going on.

291
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:01,241
Go, go, go.

292
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,688
Why the hell wouldn't we
call the police?

293
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,294
[Joyce] Sam, what is it?

294
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,496
Hang on a minute!

295
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,632
Damn.

296
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,654
What the hell is this?

297
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:53,460
You miserable little cocksucker.

298
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:56,263
- [paper rustles]
- [grunting]

299
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,302
- Rebecca?
- Dad?

300
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,971
- Sam, what is going on?
- Was someone in your room?

301
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:05,506
- What?
- Was Layne in your room?

302
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,574
[Joyce]
Sam, what happened outside?

303
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,744
Someone broke in my car.
It's probably just kids.

304
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,781
Is there anything else?

305
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:15,550
[door opening]

306
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:19,887
Lock the door.

307
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:22,255
Call the police.
Tell them what's going on.

308
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,392
[Becca] Mom?

309
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,661
It's okay. It's okay.

310
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:40,508
I have a gun, you piece of shit!

311
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:34,522
[Sam]
Oh, you think that's funny?

312
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:36,389
No gun, huh?

313
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:41,494
Fuck you! [grunting]

314
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:42,964
Fucking...

315
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:45,398
[grunting]

316
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:12,860
[door clicks]

317
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,695
[door shuts]

318
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:26,607
So this is what it's come to?

319
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:30,645
He knows we don't have guns
in the house.

320
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:32,146
And he knows how to get
in and out the house

321
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:33,748
before the cops get here.

322
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:36,884
Why don't we just move?

323
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:38,819
Because this is
my fucking house!

324
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:42,657
And I'm not gonna get run out
by some fucking sewer rat.

325
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,926
Somebody jealous
of something that I have!

326
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:48,029
What we have.

327
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:51,699
This? This is our house.

328
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,035
Our life.

329
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:59,040
- Joyce.
- Don't you ever raise

330
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,875
your voice to me
like that again.

331
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:04,912
Now, I am well aware you
have mentally checked out

332
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:06,479
these last few months.

333
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:08,249
So let me be very clear to you

334
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,151
that this marriage
takes two people

335
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:12,820
and our daughter
has two parents.

336
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:17,892
At least for this Christmas.

337
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:29,770
Joyce.

338
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,612
Hey, Joyce?

339
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:41,282
[knocking]

340
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:42,616
Joyce?

341
00:24:50,124 --> 00:24:51,258
What?

342
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:57,898
[gasps]

343
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:09,643
[sighs]

344
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:12,747
[grunts]

345
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,620
[gasps]

346
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:25,526
[knocking on door]

347
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:27,695
Who is it?

348
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:29,764
Mr. Hodges,
it's Detective Savannah Simpson.

349
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:31,832
Your wife said it would be okay
to come by and speak with you.

350
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:35,836
Hang on. Give me a second.

351
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:51,118
[rattling]

352
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,562
[decanter clanks]

353
00:26:13,808 --> 00:26:14,942
May I come in?

354
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:16,677
[Sam] Yeah, sure.

355
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:21,282
Guess you want some water,
whiskey, anything?

356
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,050
No, it's okay. On duty.

357
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,822
I used to always take
the option of not working.

358
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:29,690
Well, to be honest,

359
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:31,692
I spend a good chunk
of my day in the office.

360
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,330
It's the only way I can unwind
on my day off,

361
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:37,932
given the situation.

362
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:39,633
I understand that, Mr. Hodges.

363
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:41,802
No, please call me Sam.

364
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:43,137
Okay.

365
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,706
So, we have the stories
from the reports

366
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,108
the officers took last night.

367
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,809
But I wanted to talk more

368
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:50,778
about what we were discussing
at the station.

369
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:52,246
Sure. Go ahead.

370
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,181
Well, before it was a theory.

371
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:58,052
Now I think it's almost certain
whoever's doing this knows you,

372
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:59,220
or all of you.

373
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:03,057
I wanted to know
if you thought any more about

374
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,959
any enemies that you might have.

375
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,261
Or any older men
that might've been an issue

376
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,063
to Rebecca in the past?

377
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:14,235
Well, there is this boy that
goes to my daughter's school.

378
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:17,204
I think they're dating.

379
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:19,974
Layne Lewis, right?
She mentioned him.

380
00:27:21,075 --> 00:27:22,209
What'd she say about him?

381
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:26,180
Usual stuff high school girls
say about boys they like.

382
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:28,749
Yeah. Anyway, that's him.

383
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:33,888
Is there any specific reason why
you get a bad feeling about him?

384
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:37,725
[door opens]

385
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:40,895
[Becca] Mom, I don't need it.

386
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,963
[Joyce] ...for Christmas?

387
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:44,798
Hey, Savannah.

388
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:46,867
Mom says I need to wear
a warmer coat.

389
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,169
[Sam] Yes, you do.

390
00:27:49,303 --> 00:27:50,771
This is Layne.

391
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:53,073
Hey, Layne.

392
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:57,711
Why don't you wait here
while she gets her coat?

393
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:01,916
Hey, Mr. Hodges.

394
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:10,324
Would you like
some coffee, Savannah?

395
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,692
Oh, no, I'm...

396
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:13,894
- just about to leave.
- [Joyce] Oh, okay.

397
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:19,366
So if we could...

398
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,403
discuss further about
what you mentioned.

399
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:23,938
You need specifics?

400
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:25,306
It would help.

401
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,142
[Becca] I'm ready.

402
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:37,184
There's some Christmas cookies
in the kitchen if you want.

403
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:40,988
Do not let me forget to pick up
something for the baptism, okay?

404
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:42,122
[Sam] You got it.

405
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,058
I'm so sorry we have to go.

406
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:45,893
But my week is free

407
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,294
if you have any questions later.

408
00:28:47,328 --> 00:28:48,896
[Savannah]
Yeah. It's okay, life happens.

409
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,498
Thank you so much
for what you're doing.

410
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,001
Bye, hon.

411
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,208
So you mentioned Layne Lewis

412
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:03,043
because you
actually suspect him, right?

413
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:04,745
I'm sorry?

414
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:06,981
This isn't you just not liking

415
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:09,016
your only daughter's
boyfriend, right?

416
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:11,218
You actually believe that
it could be him?

417
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:17,024
Okay. I'll look further into it.

418
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,360
In the meantime,
we'll have a scout

419
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:21,028
who will spy
on the sub division.

420
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,296
Just in case.

421
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:28,802
Twelve gauge, huh?

422
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:31,338
Yeah, you can't be too careful.

423
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:34,842
You ever shot a firearm before?

424
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,112
Is that required to own one?

425
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:41,348
No. Not at all.

426
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,319
Well, I'll look further
into what we discussed.

427
00:29:45,654 --> 00:29:47,121
I'll be in touch.

428
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:54,529
[door closes]

429
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,005
[Layne] <i>Does your dad, like...</i>

430
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:07,975
not like me?

431
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,211
I know. I'm so sorry.

432
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:12,846
Why?

433
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,082
It's not you.

434
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:16,984
He's just been acting...

435
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:19,853
What?

436
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:23,123
I don't know.

437
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:24,559
He's just been acting
weird lately.

438
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:26,927
It's been like that
for a few months now.

439
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,296
I've never seen
my parents fight this much.

440
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:31,098
[Layne] Why are they fighting?

441
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,268
[Becca] I mean, I tried
listening in on their arguments,

442
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,236
but they always wait
until I fall asleep.

443
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:39,507
I don't know.
I think it's to do with his job.

444
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:44,078
Does your dad ever get, like...

445
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,181
mean?

446
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:50,250
- Or...?
- [Becca laughs] No.

447
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:54,589
The most he's ever done
was just yell a couple times.

448
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:58,859
But I just think
he's shutting off.

449
00:31:00,094 --> 00:31:03,330
- Emotionally?
- No, just as a dad.

450
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,034
[phone vibrates]

451
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:10,371
What is it?

452
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:12,139
[Julia] <i>Why did you call off
at work today?</i>

453
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:13,941
- <i>Is everything okay?</i>
- Yeah, everything's fine.

454
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:16,410
Look, I told you. We're not
talking outside of work.

455
00:31:16,977 --> 00:31:19,213
- <i>But I thought...</i>
- Hey, Chris is calling me.

456
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:21,148
I gotta go.
Look, don't call me again.

457
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,552
Hey, Chris. What's going on?

458
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:26,253
[Chris] <i>Hey, brother.</i>

459
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:27,254
<i>You guys doing
anything for dinner tonight?</i>

460
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:28,623
No. No plans yet.

461
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,630
[geese honking]

462
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,347
[Terri] So I'm arguing
with the cashier,

463
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,283
telling her there is no reason
my card should not be working.

464
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:59,052
And on the fifth try,
still convinced

465
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:01,255
that she's the idiot
with the broken card reader,

466
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:03,390
I finally look down,
and I see that

467
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:05,627
Chris has been putting in
the wrong pin

468
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,428
over and over!

469
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:08,663
[Terri laughs]

470
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,265
Woman, you're so fucking
stupid sometimes.

471
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:14,168
Now, had you given me
the credit card

472
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:15,402
instead of the debit card,

473
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:16,571
we wouldn't have even had

474
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:18,573
this whole going off on a tirade

475
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:20,240
on some 18 year old cashier.

476
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:21,709
"Can I see your manager?"

477
00:32:21,743 --> 00:32:23,410
She's always so spicy, this one.

478
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:24,712
[Joyce laughs]

479
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:26,648
Speaking of going off
on a tirade,

480
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,650
did you hear what happened
today at the office?

481
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:30,752
No.

482
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:32,119
[Chris] You know that...

483
00:32:32,754 --> 00:32:35,289
what's her name,
the new paralegal, Julia Hilt?

484
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:37,391
I've seen her around.

485
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:39,694
Well, she was caught...

486
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:43,464
texting in one of the most
important meetings.

487
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:46,634
Oh, are you kids not allowed
cellphones in the office?

488
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:50,237
Well, we had a really important
client today at the office.

489
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:53,575
And her face,
right into the glass.

490
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:56,210
I don't know. Social media.
Doing something, whatever.

491
00:32:56,578 --> 00:33:00,582
So, privately, Mike comes up
to her, with respect,

492
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:03,116
excuses themselves
into the hallway.

493
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,686
Tries to explain the situation.

494
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:07,387
Of course, she's not having it.

495
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,591
He's getting closer,
trying to calm her down.

496
00:33:09,624 --> 00:33:12,059
As soon as he barely even
touches her, she screams.

497
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:13,595
"Get your fucking
hands off me, Mike!

498
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:15,095
"Get your fucking hands off me!"

499
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:16,631
The guy's red
in the face embarrassed.

500
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:18,298
She's freaking crazy.

501
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:21,268
Is this normal? I mean,
normal behavior for her?

502
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:23,303
No, she's just some new
paralegal in the office.

503
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:25,573
She's a total wackjob.

504
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,408
Have you talked
to her before, then?

505
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:30,077
No. No, I just...

506
00:33:30,578 --> 00:33:32,514
I've heard of her around
the office, you know?

507
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:33,648
Coffee talk.

508
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:36,049
[Joyce] You're a gossiper, then?

509
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,652
- Guilty!
- [Terri laughs]

510
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,554
[cellphone rings]

511
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:41,823
[Chris]
You gotta try one of these.

512
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:43,123
It's Bec.

513
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:48,128
Hi, hon.

514
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,766
What do you mean
you're still at home?

515
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,735
What happened
to your plans with Mel?

516
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,606
Well, I wish
you had called us sooner.

517
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,208
You know we don't want you
home right now.

518
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:03,310
Yes.

519
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:05,412
Becca, yes.

520
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,582
We trust you.
You know exactly why...

521
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,651
Alright.

522
00:34:10,018 --> 00:34:11,819
Yeah, we're gonna
head back right now.

523
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:13,688
Love you.

524
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:16,256
Is everything okay?

525
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,792
Yeah. Just...

526
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:19,527
Becca's plans with her
friends got canceled today

527
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:21,696
so she's been home alone,
and I don't like that.

528
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:22,630
Okay. Yeah.

529
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:24,264
Well, you guys...

530
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:26,233
No, no. We'll see you guys
at the baptism.

531
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:29,504
Okay. Well, are you two sure
you're okay to drive?

532
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:32,105
Yeah. I've only had one,
but she's...

533
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,373
[Terri laughs]

534
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:41,448
[Christmas music]

535
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:50,692
Why don't you fuck me anymore?

536
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:52,860
What?

537
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:56,463
We used to do it all the time.

538
00:34:57,497 --> 00:34:58,800
Even in the car.

539
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,435
Remember how I used to
suck your dick

540
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:03,437
when you'd drive us home
from the movies?

541
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:06,206
Come on.

542
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,543
Come on.

543
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:11,478
Come on. Take your pants off.

544
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:12,614
- Come on.
- Stop.

545
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:13,848
- Honey!
- Stop it.

546
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:27,729
I miss when you'd jump
in the shower with me.

547
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,265
The way you'd slap my ass.

548
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:42,442
How many wives are begging
their husbands for that?

549
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:13,206
I'm okay.

550
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:15,743
Thank you.

00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,515
- [Sam] What was that?
- Becca?

553
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:22,884
It sounded like it was out back.

554
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,318
[Joyce]
Should we call the police?

555
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:27,454
[Sam] No. Get in the car, call
Becca and make sure she's okay.

556
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:28,956
[Joyce]
No. I'm gonna go check on Becca.

557
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,291
Get in the car. Call Rebecca.

558
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,761
It's probably just her shutting
a window or something.

559
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,974
[Joyce] Becca?

560
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,688
Becca?

561
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,599
[Sam] Come on, you bastard.

562
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:26,446
[Joyce gasps]

563
00:37:31,753 --> 00:37:32,820
Mom?

564
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:35,656
Is everything okay?

565
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,992
You scared the shit out of me.

567
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:42,429
You okay?

568
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:43,631
Yeah, everything's fine.

569
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:45,767
Did something happen?

570
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,467
- [Sam grunting]
- No.

571
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:50,605
No, it's fine, okay?

572
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:52,974

Okay. Let's see
who you are, huh?

576
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:29,744
You son of a bitch. I knew it.

577
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,521
- Hey.
- Hey.

578
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:43,390
Becca didn't hear anything.

579
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:46,727
- What happened to you?
- Oh...

580
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,564
Chasing a raccoon off
the back porch, and...

581
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:51,464
- I slipped.
- [Joyce laughs]

582
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:54,101
And also, I remembered
I left my phone at the bar.

583
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:56,003
So I gotta go get it.

584
00:38:56,037 --> 00:38:58,005
I can call Chris.
Maybe he's still there.

585
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:00,041
No, no, no. Don't.

586
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:02,043
They have a kid at home
and they gotta get back.

587
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:03,476
I'll just be a little bit.

588
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:04,812
- Okay.
- You gonna be okay?

589
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,047
Yeah. No, we'll be fine.

590
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,582
- Okay, honey.
- Okay.

591
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:09,016
Love you.

593
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,549
[Chris] Hey brother,
I'll see you this weekend.

594
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:50,017
Alright. We'll see you there.

612
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:56,077
[officer] Savannah,
Sam Hodges is here for you.

613
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,578
Thank you. Have a seat.

614
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:03,984
Alright, so what's this about?

615
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:08,756
First off, how are Joyce
and Rebecca doing?

616
00:43:09,757 --> 00:43:13,160
They're doing pretty good,
but it's been a stressful week.

617
00:43:16,097 --> 00:43:17,798
One that won't end, will it?

618
00:43:17,832 --> 00:43:19,266
I guess not.

619
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:25,206
So, about the young man
we were discussing.

620
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:27,374
- Layne?
- Yeah. Did you look into him?

621
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:30,111
The only problem with that, Sam,

622
00:43:30,545 --> 00:43:33,147
his mother reported him
missing this morning.

623
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:36,117
Becca didn't mention anything
about that.

624
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:38,886
Have you seen her yet today?

625
00:43:39,186 --> 00:43:40,988
Not since she left for school.

626
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:44,225
Cause we called her
after we heard this.

627
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,393
And his mother seems to believe

628
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:49,029
that he went to go
see her last night.

629
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:51,132
No. He doesn't come by
the house at night.

630
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:53,300
Yeah, I assumed as much.

631
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:58,139
That's what Rebecca said,
but I don't know.

632
00:43:58,172 --> 00:43:59,406
She already seemed...

633
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:01,842
upset and stressed.

634
00:44:02,276 --> 00:44:03,344
I'm sorry?

635
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:06,080
Well, after we talked
to Rebecca,

636
00:44:06,113 --> 00:44:08,282
we talked to one
of his closest friends,

637
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:10,117
and he also said

638
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:12,720
Layne was supposed to go
to your house last night.

639
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:15,756
And apparently
he didn't show up.

640
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:19,293
Much to your disapproval,
I'm sure.

641
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,661
The hell does that mean?

642
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:22,863
I don't know,
just the way you described him

643
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:24,732
the last time we communicated.

644
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:27,368
Didn't seem like you had
the highest opinion of him.

645
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,306
Yeah, I don't think
I can talk about this

646
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:33,841
until I speak to my lawyer.

647
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:35,676
Why?

648
00:44:36,277 --> 00:44:39,113
You're not being detained
or brought in as a suspect.

649
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:40,948
Yeah, but you did ask me
to come in.

650
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:43,350
To verify that he hadn't stopped
at your house last night.

651
00:44:43,384 --> 00:44:45,853
No, he did not come by my house,
and even if he did,

652
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:47,388
I wouldn't let him in.

653
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:50,057
Are you sure about that, Sam?

654
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:52,226
Are we done here?

655
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:54,361
I have to get back to my family.

656
00:44:54,395 --> 00:44:56,096
We're wrapping presents tonight.

657
00:44:57,898 --> 00:44:59,433
Yeah, you can go. You're free.

658
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:03,370
I'd bundle up, Mr. Hodges.

659
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:07,208

00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:25,359
Hello?

664
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:27,228
<i>How are things over there
at the police station?</i>

665
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:30,197
<i>Any interesting developments?</i>

666
00:45:30,532 --> 00:45:33,167
What are you doing in my house,
and where's Joyce?

667
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,837
She's just enjoying
a warm bath right now.

668
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:39,273
Don't worry.
I won't have a peak.

669
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:42,876
You don't mind if I poured
myself a glass of whiskey

670
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,512
while I'm here, right?

671
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,148
Look, I don't know
what the fuck you want,

672
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:50,884
but you got about 15 seconds
to get out of my house.

673
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,219
<i>Or what, Sam?</i>

674
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:56,090
All I have to do is leave
this envelope right here with me

675
00:45:56,123 --> 00:45:58,792
in front of the bathroom door
on my way out.

676
00:45:58,826 --> 00:46:00,494
A few snapshots.

677
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:02,263
One's from last night,

678
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:05,232
and a few more spicy favorites
I haven't shown you yet.

679
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:06,800
Get out of my house!

680
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:10,304
That temper's going to get
the best of you one day, Sam.

681
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:15,909
I want you to clear
your schedule for this evening

682
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:18,312
and take a rain check
on wrapping those presents.

683
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:20,047
We're helping Rebecca
pick out an outfit

684
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,815
for tomorrow's baptism,

685
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:23,518
because you and I are going
to meet up for a date.

686
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:25,319
And why the hell would
I do that?

687
00:46:25,352 --> 00:46:28,155
<i>Maybe I'd just like to sort
some things out.</i>

688
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:30,592
Sanctuary Club on Bennett. Nine.

689
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,560
- Look, I'm not...
- You know, it sound like

690
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:35,296
Joyce might be finishing up
her little soak right now.

691
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,298
Are we going to be meeting,

692
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:39,366
or am I leaving
this envelope here?

693
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:42,469
I'll be there.

694
00:46:43,638 --> 00:46:45,139
I'll find you, Sam.

695
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:52,547
Fuck!

696
00:46:53,347 --> 00:46:55,349
Fuck! Fuck!

697
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:57,051
God!

698
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:59,119
- Everything okay over there?
- What do you want?

699
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:03,157
Oh, sorry.

700
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:04,925
My car...

701
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:07,061
And, you know...

702
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:09,063
arguing with my wife.

703
00:47:18,405 --> 00:47:20,140
That guy looks like
he's ready to pop.

704
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:21,442
You know what's funny?
That's the guy

705
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,143
from Simpson's
home invasion case.

706
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:25,112
Who, the homeowner?

707
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:27,515
Yeah, him. She's having me look
into a few things on that guy.

708
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:29,416
Is he a suspect?

709
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:32,052
Get the feeling she's starting
to think that way at least.

710
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:34,955

You know, out of curiosity,

715
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,931
I've been looking at statistics
of stalker and break-in cases

716
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:46,867
to see how often someone from
the home or family is involved.

717
00:47:48,135 --> 00:47:49,604
How's that going for you?

718
00:47:49,637 --> 00:47:50,971
Not good.

719
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:53,474
Pretty useless rabbit hole,
to be honest.

720
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:55,376
Check this out.

721
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,044
D.O.J. numbers show

722
00:47:57,077 --> 00:47:59,480
there's almost
270,000 home invasions a year.

1.3 million victims

a stalker. Jesus Christ.

don't tell you, Castillo?

736
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:33,213
No, he said the same thing.

737
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,082
He said Layne hasn't gotten
ahold of him.

738
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:37,117
I mean, he snuck out
my window last night

740
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:40,655

- Mel?
- What?

742
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:51,666
Do you wonder if your parents
are capable of killing someone?

743
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:54,368
What?

744
00:48:56,336 --> 00:48:59,507
You ever think your parents
are just so damn boring

745
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:01,509
that they pretend
that everything's okay

746

I don't know.

748
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:07,414
Probably not my parents.

749
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:09,016
If anything,
they're probably just guilty

750
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:10,685

Now, before we continue
with our Christmas service,

805
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:51,933
on the Eve of little
Baby Jesus' birthday,

806
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:55,536
I wanna remind you
that one of our own

807
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,338
is about to have
her little boy baptized,

808
00:53:58,371 --> 00:54:01,642
to join us in union
with the Holy Spirit.

00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,617
Now, I wanna remind you
what that means,

810
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,920
that word baptism,
to us Christian folk.

811
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:16,389
Why?

812
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:20,561
Why do we, as parents,

813
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:22,830
have our little ones baptized?

814
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:28,069
Why do we lay their tiny
heads in the water,

815
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:29,804
and sometimes scare them,

816
00:54:30,403 --> 00:54:33,340
while we anoint them
with the holy water?

817
00:54:38,378 --> 00:54:42,049
We baptize
because our souls are thirsty.

818
00:54:42,817 --> 00:54:45,052
So we give it a drink
of that water.

819
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:50,057
That water, being what it is,
that we desire from the Lord,

820
00:54:50,091 --> 00:54:53,928
and what the Lord will promise
to give us in return.

and girls,

because it isn't a contract.

00:55:40,975 --> 00:55:43,911
It doesn't need consent
from both parties.

That's not what
baptism is, y'all.

836

It is simply
God's promise to us.

[all] No.

840

Because we have the freedom

841

We are given the opportunity
to turn away.

There is no salvation
where there is no faith.

and where there is faith,

848
00:56:29,456 --> 00:56:32,059
there is promise of salvation.

So before we welcome in another,

855
00:56:53,848 --> 00:56:56,784
let us take a moment
to heal one of our own.

856
00:57:07,862 --> 00:57:10,731
Little Miss Margaret has
recently been released

857
00:57:10,765 --> 00:57:12,600
from the hospital,

858
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:14,835
after she was burned

859
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:17,004
in her home's kitchen
while preparing supper.

860
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:21,943
Now, as she has confessed,

861
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:25,680
and as she told all of us
a few months back,

862
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:31,052
Margaret stepped outside
of her marriage.

863
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:33,788
She committed adultery.

864
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:36,724
But we forgive her.

865
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:40,493
Oh, we forgive her
and we love her,

866
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:43,197
because she repented
and she asked for forgiveness,

867
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,667
and the Lord in return
forgives her and loves her.

868
00:57:50,638 --> 00:57:52,139
So when we pray

869
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,009
for little Margaret's

870
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:58,679
painful healing
of her body to begin,

871
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:01,115
we are also gonna pray
for her soul.

872
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:07,655
'Cause I don't believe this was
just an accident, Margaret.

873
00:58:08,689 --> 00:58:10,825
I truly do not.

874
00:58:12,193 --> 00:58:13,728
I don't think this was just

875
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:16,063
a matter of some grease
catching fire.

876
00:58:24,572 --> 00:58:27,775
I think the Lord sensed that...

877
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:31,512
even though you had repented,

878
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,050
you were thinking of going down
that path of sin again.

879
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:40,721
Am I wrong, Margaret?

880
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:44,992
Shh. I know. I know.

881
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:49,196
And the Lord knew it.

882
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:55,269
And I truly think...

883
00:58:56,037 --> 00:59:00,007
that he placed
the demon Wrath in you,

884
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:01,909
and he caused that fire.

885
00:59:01,942 --> 00:59:03,978
And he caused that pain

886
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:07,181
to remind you of the fire
and pain that awaits you

887
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:09,250
should you ever
turn against Him again.

888
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:16,924
Because no matter how painful
flames upon the flesh may feel,

889
00:59:17,992 --> 00:59:20,194
it's the flames that
await our soul,

890
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:23,731
should we turn on Him,
that we must fear!

891
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,770
So we're not just praying
for her body to heal.

892
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:35,242
We're gonna cast
a demon Wrath out.

893
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:36,944
I mean it.

894
00:59:42,183 --> 00:59:44,351
Do you hear me in there, demon?

895
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:47,755
You're no longer welcome here.

896
00:59:47,788 --> 00:59:51,892
You leave this God-fearing woman
and you take that sin with you!

897
00:59:52,626 --> 00:59:55,896
You take that sin
back to hell with you!

898
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,633
And you take any adulterer
in this room

899
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:00,801
and you take them back

900
01:00:00,835 --> 01:00:04,772
to those lakes of fire!

901
01:00:05,973 --> 01:00:08,909
Go on. You take those sinners
and you leave!

902
01:00:08,943 --> 01:00:10,244
Go on! Get!

903
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:12,780
Leave.

904
01:00:13,347 --> 01:00:15,649
Leave. Leave.

905
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:17,852
Leave.

906
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:19,120
Leave.

907
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,821
Leave.

908
01:00:20,855 --> 01:00:22,323
- Leave.
- [parishioners] Leave!

909
01:00:22,356 --> 01:00:23,858
- Leave.
- [all] Leave.

910
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:25,025
- Leave.
- Leave.

911
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:26,660
- Leave.
- Leave.

912
01:00:26,994 --> 01:00:28,095
- Leave!
- Leave.

913
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:29,363
- Leave!
- Leave!

914
01:00:29,396 --> 01:00:30,865
- Leave!
- Leave!

915
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:32,800
Leave!

916
01:00:48,415 --> 01:00:52,353
And Our Lord has delivered
our sister back to us all.

917
01:00:54,388 --> 01:00:56,157
She is here to stay.

918
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,062
Now, let us welcome our sister
back to us, shall we?

919
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,865
[applause]

920
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,976
I'll see you
next week, Minister.

921
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:17,211
See you then, brother.

922
01:01:17,244 --> 01:01:18,779
- Thank you.
- You play one hell

923
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:20,447
of an electric guitar
probably, right?

924
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:22,883
Seriously, Terri's been trying
to bring me into the fold,

925
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:25,019
and full disclosure,
I gotta tell you

926
01:01:25,052 --> 01:01:26,854
I've been looking forward
to the whole

927
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:29,256
snakes and serpents kind of,
fire and brimstone thing.

928
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:32,826
I'd love to introduce you
to my sister and my niece.

929
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,030
Well, she's actually a
foster sister,

930
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:37,898
so you can take it easy on her.

931
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:40,201
Certainly, we're always thrilled
to watch our little family grow.

932
01:01:40,234 --> 01:01:43,170
Hey, guys.
I'd like to introduce you to...

933
01:01:43,638 --> 01:01:45,339
- Father...
- Minister.

934
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:47,241
[Chris] Minister Fairfield.

935
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:57,318
So you guys wanna go
grab breakfast?

936
01:01:57,351 --> 01:01:59,820
- Yeah. Sounds good to me.
- Tammy's up the street.

937
01:01:59,853 --> 01:02:01,155
Steak and eggs
special on Sundays.

938
01:02:01,188 --> 01:02:02,957
- [Terri] Chris?
- Yeah, babe?

939
01:02:05,426 --> 01:02:07,127
Merry Christmas, Sam.

940
01:02:09,531 --> 01:02:10,965
[suspenseful music]

941
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:20,007
- Who grabbed my shoulder?
- What?

942
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,076
Did you see
who grabbed my shoulder?

943
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:30,217
No, it's probably someone
just saying bye.

944
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:47,468
Hey, kid. I got
a really stupid question.

945
01:02:48,002 --> 01:02:51,506
Did you break that hand,
or did you lose any fingers?

946
01:02:53,874 --> 01:02:56,443
What I'm trying to ask you,
is your hand broken?

947
01:02:56,477 --> 01:02:58,312
Do you have all your fingers,
is what I'm tryna ask.

948
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:00,214
- It's just broken.
- Oh.

949
01:03:01,382 --> 01:03:03,083
Okay. Well, can I see it?

950
01:03:03,551 --> 01:03:05,252
Your hand. Let me see your hand.

951
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:07,488
Merry Christmas.

952
01:03:07,522 --> 01:03:09,290
Did you grab my shoulder
over there?

953
01:03:09,323 --> 01:03:10,824
- No.
- Do we have a problem?

954
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:12,259
No, there's no problem.

955
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:13,394
I'm just trying to see
your kid's fingers.

956
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:14,928
Excuse me?

957
01:03:15,162 --> 01:03:16,830
[Sam] I just wanna see
if he has all his fingers.

958
01:03:16,864 --> 01:03:17,931
Yeah, he's got
all his fingers, man.

959
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:19,099
Just let me see...!

960
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,271
Are you a psychopath?

961
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:25,839
Listen, I...

962
01:03:25,873 --> 01:03:28,108
No, shut up
for a goddamn second, Sam!

963
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:32,079
I'm sure you know at this point

964
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:35,215
you just elevated yourself
to chief suspect, Sam.

965
01:03:36,183 --> 01:03:37,951
Me calling in favors?

966
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:39,420
Because I'm looking for the guy
that's been stalking us.

967
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:41,889
He attacked me last night,
and in the fight,

968
01:03:41,922 --> 01:03:43,957
he lost two fingers
and then he ran off.

969
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:47,061
- What? Where?
- <i>It was after work last night.</i>

970
01:03:48,062 --> 01:03:49,531
And then in there,

971
01:03:49,564 --> 01:03:51,165
someone grabbed my shoulder
and said my name.

972
01:03:51,198 --> 01:03:53,033
And he was missing fingers.

973
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:55,502
You're either not keeping us
in the loop,

974
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:57,539
or you're being really
fucking creative.

975
01:03:57,572 --> 01:03:59,574
Now, which one
is more suspicious?

976
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:01,241
Look, it was last night,

977
01:04:01,275 --> 01:04:03,310
and I was gonna come in
after church today.

978
01:04:05,212 --> 01:04:06,581
Did you get a good look at him?

979
01:04:07,414 --> 01:04:08,516
No, nothing.

980
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,619
<i>Well, good news for you,
the boy's father sounds like</i>

981
01:04:11,653 --> 01:04:13,287
<i>he's not gonna press charges.</i>

982
01:04:13,555 --> 01:04:15,422
<i>I advise you
consider doing the same.</i>

983
01:04:15,757 --> 01:04:17,826
<i>Just chalk it up
to holiday stress.</i>

984
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:21,028
<i>No more secrets.</i>

985
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:23,565
Have a good Christmas, Sam.

986
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:50,224
What a beautiful ceremony.

987
01:04:50,257 --> 01:04:51,392
Becca.

988
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,128
No, I think we'll definitely
remember that one.

989
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:55,563
Enough. I get it.

990
01:04:55,597 --> 01:04:56,664
[Becca] Do you, Dad?

991
01:04:56,698 --> 01:04:58,198
Do you know what it was like

992
01:04:58,232 --> 01:04:59,634
for Mom and I
to have to stand there

993
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,502
and watch you run around
like a serial killer?

994
01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:03,671
Do I look like
a serial killer to you?

995
01:05:10,043 --> 01:05:13,013
What we doing?
Can we just go home?

996
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,050
Stay here.

997
01:05:17,552 --> 01:05:18,686
Or what?

998
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,320
Or your crazy fucking dad

999
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:22,356
is gonna chop you up
in a thousand pieces.

1000
01:05:23,424 --> 01:05:24,692
Stay here.

1001
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:40,340
Joyce, I'm sorry.

1002
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:42,544
They were at the house again,
weren't they?

1003
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,115
So you walking into a door
and smashing your eye,

1004
01:05:48,148 --> 01:05:50,017
that was all just bullshit?

1005
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:55,289
Why'd you lie about it?

1006
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:58,192
- Because I was afraid...
- Who has reason

1007
01:05:58,225 --> 01:05:59,627
to be messing with us?

1008
01:06:00,194 --> 01:06:02,429
Do you owe someone money?

1009
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:04,699
You think this is my fault now?

1010
01:06:12,105 --> 01:06:15,510
What I think
is that when you went back

1011
01:06:15,543 --> 01:06:17,077
to the bar
to get your cell phone,

1012
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:19,581
you were gone
an awful long time.

1013
01:06:38,098 --> 01:06:39,734
[upbeat music]

1014
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:45,239
[chiming softly]

1015
01:07:10,097 --> 01:07:12,432
What happened
this last year, Sam?

1016
01:07:18,105 --> 01:07:20,240
I keep going over it in my head.

1017
01:07:21,509 --> 01:07:23,343
The days and the months, and...

1018
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:27,247
I just can't figure out where...

1019
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:30,450
whatever this is,
where it started.

1020
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:42,496
I still love you.

1021
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:46,433
I promise I do.

1022
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:54,474
But I know
something has been going on.

1023
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:58,378
And it started before
all of this craziness.

1024
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:11,191
I have my suspicions.

1025
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:19,299
But I hated myself
for feeling them.

1026
01:08:19,901 --> 01:08:24,204
I mean, how could I think
that about you?

1027
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,410
It's what I tell myself...

1028
01:08:31,913 --> 01:08:34,782
alone at night,
wondering where you are.

1029
01:08:45,893 --> 01:08:47,260
I think...

1030
01:08:48,096 --> 01:08:50,497
what I was most afraid of,
though, was if...

1031
01:08:51,032 --> 01:08:53,200
I was right and I confronted you

1032
01:08:53,233 --> 01:08:54,869
and I made you stop doing

1033
01:08:54,902 --> 01:08:58,271
whatever it was you were doing.

1034
01:09:00,508 --> 01:09:05,880
And I would lose you completely.

1035
01:09:05,913 --> 01:09:07,314
[Joyce cries]

1036
01:09:14,922 --> 01:09:18,559
So I just swallowed my pride
and I looked the other way,

1037
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:22,897
and I convinced myself
this is just

1038
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:25,232
something that
marriages go through.

1039
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:29,604
Something we would go through.

1040
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:34,876
You would realize
you were making a mistake,

1041
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:37,177
and we would just move past it.

1042
01:09:49,657 --> 01:09:50,825
You see, Sam...

1043
01:09:56,764 --> 01:09:58,733
I love you so much...

1044
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:04,337
that I removed myself
from the picture.

1045
01:10:06,574 --> 01:10:11,612
And I just hope that
I'm worth coming back to

1046
01:10:11,646 --> 01:10:13,648
when you're finished.

1047
01:10:13,681 --> 01:10:16,651
[Joyce sobs]

1048
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,922
But I can't do it.

1049
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:22,990
I can't do it anymore.
I can't sit in the dark.

1050
01:10:23,024 --> 01:10:24,324
I can't.

1051
01:10:25,626 --> 01:10:29,864
It's torture,
and it has got to stop.

1052
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:36,470
So...

1053
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,478
is there someone else?

1054
01:10:48,082 --> 01:10:49,449
[Sam] There was.

1055
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:53,286
There was someone else.

1056
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:56,524
You're not crazy.

1057
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:01,495
[Joyce cries]

1058
01:11:09,402 --> 01:11:10,470

- [Sam] I'm sorry!

- [Joyce] Who is it?
- What does it matter?

1063
01:11:24,952 --> 01:11:26,854
- [Joyce yells]
- [glass smashes]

1064
01:11:29,857 --> 01:11:31,424
Who is it?

1065
01:11:37,665 --> 01:11:38,933
It's a girl at work.

1066
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:40,968
Her name is Julia.

1067
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,940
The crazy one?

1068
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:48,308
[Joyce cries]

1069
01:11:54,682 --> 01:11:57,018
You know what
the worst part of it is?

1070
01:11:57,384 --> 01:11:58,920
You thought I was so dumb,

1071
01:11:58,953 --> 01:12:01,722
you didn't even try
not to be obvious.

1072
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:05,425
She's too stupid.

1073
01:12:06,093 --> 01:12:08,062
She'll never figure it out.

1074
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:12,365
You think that fucking
little of me.

1075
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:15,069
[Sam] Look, it's over.
I ended it.

1076
01:12:17,104 --> 01:12:18,673
Look at me.

1077
01:12:19,273 --> 01:12:20,708
- It's you.
- [Joyce cries]

1078
01:12:21,209 --> 01:12:23,443
- [Joyce cries]
- I love you.

1079
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:28,749
You expect me to believe that?

1080
01:12:30,818 --> 01:12:31,986
[Becca screams]

1081
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:34,421
[Becca screams]

1082
01:12:36,724 --> 01:12:37,859
[Sam] Hey!

1083
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:44,799
[repeated thuds]

1084
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:48,435
[glass smashes]

1085
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:54,809
[glass crunches]

1086
01:13:08,589 --> 01:13:09,924
[Joyce screams]

1087
01:13:10,324 --> 01:13:12,360
[Becca and Joyce yelling]

1088
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:16,931
[man] I want you to hear
what daddy has done.

1089
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:18,900
[both grunting]

1090
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:28,542
[Joyce gasping]

1091
01:13:29,043 --> 01:13:30,578
Becca!

1092
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:31,579
Becca!

1093
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:36,984
[both grunting]

1094
01:13:37,618 --> 01:13:38,753
[thud]

1095
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:43,925
[man] Look at me!

1096
01:13:50,965 --> 01:13:52,133
[Joyce] No.

1097
01:13:52,533 --> 01:13:55,102
[man] I'll always be able to
find a way back in.

1098
01:13:55,336 --> 01:13:56,771
- [thud]
- [man yells]

1099
01:13:57,204 --> 01:13:59,206
[all yelling]

1100
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:04,812
[Joyce] Becca!

1101
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:06,981
- [man snarls]
- [Becca screams]

1102
01:14:07,014 --> 01:14:09,517
[Becca screaming]

1103
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:11,519
[Joyce] Becca! Becca!

1104
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,688
Stop, please!

1105
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:15,756
[man] Where you going, Rebecca?

1106
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,625
I still want you to hear this.

1107
01:14:17,658 --> 01:14:18,893
- [thud]
- [Joyce yells]

1108
01:14:21,929 --> 01:14:23,064
[gun reloading]

1109
01:14:34,942 --> 01:14:36,610
Now I have a gun.

1110
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:37,945
[gunshot]

1111
01:14:41,983 --> 01:14:43,551
- [Joyce] Sam!
- [Becca] Dad, dad!

1112
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:46,921
- [Becca cries]
- [Joyce] Oh, Becca. Becca!

1113
01:14:46,954 --> 01:14:48,756
[Becca and Joyce cry]

1114
01:14:49,423 --> 01:14:52,159
[Joyce] Are you okay?
Let me see.

1115
01:14:57,898 --> 01:14:59,066
[tense music]

1116
01:15:03,838 --> 01:15:05,006
Oh, quit being a baby.

1117
01:15:08,943 --> 01:15:10,978
Do me a favor.
Let me check your eyesight.

1118
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:14,281
Look straight ahead at me. Okay.

1119
01:15:21,288 --> 01:15:23,657
You didn't lose any
consciousness when he hit you?

1120
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:25,226
- No.
- Okay.

1121
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:26,293
Alright.

1122
01:15:26,694 --> 01:15:28,929
I think everybody's fine.
If you guys...

1123
01:15:29,163 --> 01:15:30,598
Who are you?

1124
01:15:30,631 --> 01:15:32,700
And why are you here?

1125
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:37,571
- Okay? Thank you.
- Thank you.

1126
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:39,840
Wait.

1127
01:15:40,074 --> 01:15:42,176
Before you leave, do any
of you guys recognize him?

1128
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,185
[camera clicks]

1129
01:15:51,786 --> 01:15:52,887
No.

1130
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:55,322
[Sam] What's his name?

1131
01:15:55,356 --> 01:15:56,824
[officer] There's not a wallet.
There's no identification.

1132
01:15:56,857 --> 01:15:57,892
Nothing on him.

1133
01:15:58,492 --> 01:16:00,895
Why, Sam? You recognize him?

1134
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:04,865
No.

1135
01:16:06,634 --> 01:16:08,269
No, I don't know who he is.

1136
01:16:10,304 --> 01:16:13,307
Alright, well,
we're gonna John Doe this guy.

1137
01:16:13,874 --> 01:16:16,110
We'll get his prints.
Blood at the lab.

1138
01:16:16,477 --> 01:16:18,579
I'm sure he's in the system.

1139
01:16:19,814 --> 01:16:21,282
Yeah, you guys can go.

1140
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:46,240
We'll get out of here
pretty quick

1141
01:16:46,273 --> 01:16:47,975
once we get all
the photos we need.

1142
01:16:48,476 --> 01:16:50,878
And you guys can hire someone
to get this cleaned up.

1143
01:16:51,378 --> 01:16:53,881
I know it's a shitty way
to spend the holidays.

1144
01:16:57,017 --> 01:17:00,121
Look, Sam,
I wanted to apologize.

1145
01:17:00,522 --> 01:17:02,289
You gotta admit,
you didn't make it easy on us.

1146
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:06,227
You know, all of this
and poking around.

1147
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,195
See if we can figure out
the fuck this guy is.

1148
01:17:09,163 --> 01:17:11,932
Maybe he had something to do
with Layne Lewis.

1149
01:17:16,704 --> 01:17:18,205
You've got some tough girls.

1150
01:17:21,175 --> 01:17:22,376
Yeah, they are.

1151
01:17:24,211 --> 01:17:26,847
So, what are you guys gonna do?
Stay at a hotel?

1152
01:17:27,882 --> 01:17:30,684
No, I think we're just gonna
drive ourselves to the hospital

1153
01:17:30,718 --> 01:17:32,186
and stay at the in-laws'.

1154
01:17:33,721 --> 01:17:34,655
Try and save Christmas.

1155
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:36,924
Sounds good.

1156
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:41,228
It's gonna be a pretty wide
investigation for a few days.

1157
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:45,232
Look, I'll try
to give you guys some time.

1158
01:17:46,734 --> 01:17:48,769
- Contact you after New Year's.
- Thank you.

1159
01:17:56,277 --> 01:17:58,112
Do you remember

1160
01:17:58,145 --> 01:18:01,015
the Christmas we spent
at the hotel when I was eight?

1161
01:18:02,082 --> 01:18:03,751
When we moved?

1162
01:18:04,051 --> 01:18:05,186
Yeah.

1163
01:18:05,953 --> 01:18:10,224
The reservation got screwed up
at the nice place with the pool.

1164
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:13,827
So Dad had to get us a new place
at the motel down the street.

1165
01:18:14,828 --> 01:18:17,264
I thought that was
the worst Christmas ever.

1166
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:20,301
I don't know.

1167
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:25,773
I remember you guys told me

1168
01:18:25,806 --> 01:18:28,175
that we wouldn't get
any presents that year,

1169
01:18:28,209 --> 01:18:29,376
because Santa wouldn't be able

1170
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:30,978
- to find us.
- Right.

1171
01:18:34,549 --> 01:18:36,083
But when I woke up,

1172
01:18:36,116 --> 01:18:38,152
you guys had set
all the presents out.

1173
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,922
Then we opened them
on the twin beds

1174
01:18:41,956 --> 01:18:45,159
before going downstairs
to eat pancakes and waffles.

1175
01:18:45,192 --> 01:18:47,127
Nuts and chocolate chip.

1176
01:18:47,962 --> 01:18:49,063
Yeah.

1177
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:56,170
Then we watched Christmas movies
all day in our PJs.

1178
01:18:58,339 --> 01:18:59,807
[Joyce sighs]

1179
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:01,775
You know...

1180
01:19:03,143 --> 01:19:05,479
When I think about Christmas,

1181
01:19:05,513 --> 01:19:07,848
that's the year
I actually think of.

1182
01:19:12,152 --> 01:19:15,956
Let's hope that's the Christmas
you always think of, sweetie.

1183
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,057
[Becca cries]

1184
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,893
Yeah.

1185
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,812
[inaudible]

1186
01:19:46,153 --> 01:19:47,988
[inaudible]

1187
01:19:50,224 --> 01:19:51,225
[inaudible]

1188
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:25,492
You look like shit.

1189
01:20:26,226 --> 01:20:27,861
Aww, thank you.

1190
01:20:37,639 --> 01:20:39,473
I want a fresh start this year.

1191
01:20:43,077 --> 01:20:44,345
Can we do that?

1192
01:20:45,346 --> 01:20:46,347
I'd like that.

1193
01:20:55,356 --> 01:20:56,924
I just wish your mom
let your dad keep

1194
01:20:56,957 --> 01:20:58,392
booze around here, you know?

1195
01:20:58,926 --> 01:21:01,395
I'm so sick of having eggnog.

1196
01:21:01,895 --> 01:21:04,498
Where's my scotch? [chuckles]

1197
01:21:04,898 --> 01:21:06,400
I doubt
if anything's open, though.

1198
01:21:07,501 --> 01:21:09,136
It's still early.

1199
01:21:09,169 --> 01:21:10,904
That liquor store on Union?

1200
01:21:10,938 --> 01:21:12,106
It's still open.

1201
01:21:12,774 --> 01:21:15,042
Well, I think you should go
get us something.

1202
01:21:15,075 --> 01:21:16,578
What if your mom catches us?

1203
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:19,046
Then we'll have to do what we
did when we were teenagers

1204
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:21,014
and we'll just have to hide it.

1205
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:22,216
- Okay.
- [both laugh]

1206
01:21:23,585 --> 01:21:25,919
- One more thing.
- Name it.

1207
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:29,022
Swing by Charlie's
and get us some pizza.

1208
01:21:30,224 --> 01:21:32,493
Their kitchen's open
tonight 'til 2.

1209
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:36,564
Okay.

1210
01:21:42,035 --> 01:21:43,170
Alright, darling.

1211
01:21:44,438 --> 01:21:46,006
I shall return.

1212
01:21:46,508 --> 01:21:47,642
Love you.

1213
01:22:04,057 --> 01:22:05,527
[Christmas music]

1214
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,428
[Sam] I ordered a pizza
about 15 minutes ago.

1215
01:22:07,461 --> 01:22:09,531
[man] Yeah, I was hoping you
wouldn't get here so quickly.

1216
01:22:09,564 --> 01:22:11,733
Burned that one. They're making
a new one for you.

1217
01:22:11,766 --> 01:22:13,300
It'll just be a second, man.

1218
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:15,969
Just grab a seat.
Maybe grab a drink.

1219
01:22:16,003 --> 01:22:17,304
It'll be right out.

1220
01:22:17,337 --> 01:22:18,706
[Sam] Yeah, let me get a whiskey

1221
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,307
- and a glass of ice, please.
- [man] Sure.

1222
01:22:40,695 --> 01:22:41,696
[chuckles]

1223
01:22:45,432 --> 01:22:46,634
Can I help you?

1224
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,738
No, it's nothing. I'm just...

1225
01:22:51,371 --> 01:22:54,208
relieved to see you putting
that ice on your face,

1226
01:22:54,241 --> 01:22:56,578
instead of ruining a perfect
glass of whiskey with it.

1227
01:22:56,611 --> 01:22:57,978
- That's all.
- [Sam laughs]

1228
01:23:02,049 --> 01:23:03,217
Hey, I'm sorry.

1229
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,351
What are you drinking?

1230
01:23:04,819 --> 01:23:07,287
[Devon sighs]
What am I drinking?

1231
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:09,757
Whatever this place's
cheapest scotch is.

1232
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:12,025
Hey, bartender.
Get him another scotch.

1233
01:23:12,059 --> 01:23:13,761
You didn't have to do that.

1234
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:15,563
Top shelf.

1235
01:23:16,598 --> 01:23:18,031
I appreciate it.

1236
01:23:18,766 --> 01:23:20,635
You look like
you could use another round,

1237
01:23:20,668 --> 01:23:22,436
and you didn't say
"no thank you."

1238
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:25,707
Well, my mom always said
to not let my pride

1239
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,241
get in the way
of a kind gesture.

1240
01:23:28,141 --> 01:23:29,544
Pleasure to meet you.

1241
01:23:30,512 --> 01:23:31,478
Sam.

1242
01:23:32,847 --> 01:23:34,181
Devon.

1243
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:40,120
You try giving the cat
a bath or something?

1244
01:23:41,488 --> 01:23:42,489
Come again?

1245
01:23:44,124 --> 01:23:45,593
Oh. [Sam laughs]

1246
01:23:45,994 --> 01:23:48,730
Oh. It's been a hell of a week.

1247
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:52,299
Well, I hope it's getting
better for you.

1248
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:55,168
Things are looking up
after tonight.

1249
01:23:56,538 --> 01:23:58,606
Some good news come
with those cuts, then?

1250
01:24:00,508 --> 01:24:04,712
Yeah. They represent a fresh
start, you could say.

1251
01:24:06,346 --> 01:24:08,215
And that's definitely something
I can give

1252
01:24:08,248 --> 01:24:10,217
my family for Christmas.

1253
01:24:12,486 --> 01:24:13,821
Well, they say simple gifts

1254
01:24:13,855 --> 01:24:15,723
usually resonate
the most with family.

1255
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:18,292
Well, if you have a wife.

1256
01:24:18,325 --> 01:24:19,827
[Devon laughs]

1257
01:24:19,861 --> 01:24:21,829
I'm not quite ready
for that road yet.

1258
01:24:23,898 --> 01:24:26,166
Keeping things simple
for the holidays, right?

1259
01:24:26,901 --> 01:24:29,503
I suppose that's a more
cheerful way to look at it.

1260
01:24:29,537 --> 01:24:31,271
Maybe if I was ready
to settle down,

1261
01:24:31,305 --> 01:24:34,308
I'd appreciate an easy life,
but I have no...

1262
01:24:34,809 --> 01:24:36,476
Marriage shouldn't be
in your cards

1263
01:24:36,511 --> 01:24:38,613
if that's
what you're hoping for.

1264
01:24:38,646 --> 01:24:39,681
Really?

1265
01:24:41,716 --> 01:24:43,350
Any advice for it, then?

1266
01:24:46,621 --> 01:24:47,722
Yeah.

1267
01:24:48,022 --> 01:24:50,692
Find somebody that
you love more than

1268
01:24:50,725 --> 01:24:52,192
your friends, your hobbies,

1269
01:24:52,225 --> 01:24:54,428
your top shelf scotch.

1270
01:24:54,461 --> 01:24:55,597
[Devon laughs]

1271
01:24:56,564 --> 01:24:59,499
You gotta be willing to give up
everything for that person.

1272
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:04,606
Well, that's what you did?

1273
01:25:06,473 --> 01:25:08,275
I married someone I loved

1274
01:25:08,308 --> 01:25:09,811
just as much
as all those things.

1275
01:25:14,314 --> 01:25:16,216
When you first meet someone,

1276
01:25:17,552 --> 01:25:19,152
they come into your life,

1277
01:25:19,186 --> 01:25:20,354
and you don't think
about what it's like

1278
01:25:20,387 --> 01:25:22,289
you coming into theirs.

1279
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,626
But eventually,
you're gonna have to choose.

1280
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:27,662
You're gonna have
to choose between...

1281
01:25:28,462 --> 01:25:31,899
the life that you had,
and your life with them.

1282
01:25:33,534 --> 01:25:35,369
And you'll see
other people do it,

1283
01:25:35,402 --> 01:25:37,739
and you tell yourself
that's not me.

1284
01:25:37,772 --> 01:25:39,641
That's not gonna be us.

1285
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:44,579
Then you'll feel selfish
for living both lives.

1286
01:25:44,946 --> 01:25:46,346
But here's the truth.

1287
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:49,817
Finding someone
you're not gonna resent

1288
01:25:49,851 --> 01:25:51,686
for forcing you
to make that choice.

1289
01:25:54,622 --> 01:25:55,923
Merry Christmas.

1290
01:25:55,957 --> 01:25:57,190
[Sam laughs]

1291
01:25:57,224 --> 01:25:58,392
[glasses clink]

1292
01:26:00,762 --> 01:26:02,664
So, is there a woman
in your life that knows

1293
01:26:02,697 --> 01:26:05,332
you're at a bar at Christmas
getting marital advice?

1294
01:26:05,365 --> 01:26:06,801
[Devon laughs] That's funny.

1295
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:09,336
No, no, no. Not me.
Nope. Nope, nope, nope.

1296
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:13,808
You see, my sense of romance has
always been a bit stinted.

1297
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:17,945
I had this one friend
when I was younger.

1298
01:26:18,713 --> 01:26:20,782
He met this girl
when we were kids.

1299
01:26:21,015 --> 01:26:22,684
You know,
he fell in love with her.

1300
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:26,319
And all he could do is
talk about her.

1301
01:26:27,689 --> 01:26:29,456
You'd swear
he'd never seen the stars

1302
01:26:29,489 --> 01:26:31,358
before seeing her eyes,
you know?

1303
01:26:34,261 --> 01:26:35,763
She thought the world of him.

1304
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:42,235
But years
after they were married,

1305
01:26:42,269 --> 01:26:44,539
before they ever had
a chance to have kids,

1306
01:26:46,674 --> 01:26:47,909
he got killed in a wreck.

1307
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:51,311
No goodbyes, no farewells.

1308
01:26:54,481 --> 01:26:56,617
He just never came home
from work one night.

1309
01:26:58,385 --> 01:26:59,419
She always kept his name.

1310
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:00,888
Never remarried.

1311
01:27:01,823 --> 01:27:03,758
Even after years and years.

1312
01:27:04,559 --> 01:27:07,829
She always kept his name
and always wears his ring.

1313
01:27:11,799 --> 01:27:13,801
She'll always be his,
no matter what.

1314
01:27:16,938 --> 01:27:20,340
You see, that right there,
that's my idea of a romance,

1315
01:27:20,373 --> 01:27:21,542
of devotion.

1316
01:27:23,477 --> 01:27:25,312
[Devon laughs]

1317
01:27:25,345 --> 01:27:26,981
Now good luck telling that
warm hearted story to someone

1318
01:27:27,014 --> 01:27:28,983
and then not
scare them off, right?

1319
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:36,591
Fuck.

1320
01:27:37,759 --> 01:27:39,392
Is it always so bleak in here?

1321
01:27:39,894 --> 01:27:41,529
Just during the holidays.

1322
01:27:41,562 --> 01:27:43,564
It's actually a good place
to bring somebody

1323
01:27:43,598 --> 01:27:45,032
if you just
wanna have a good time.

1324
01:27:45,066 --> 01:27:47,001
Oh, yeah? Friends or wives?

1325
01:27:48,703 --> 01:27:49,837
Something in between.

1326
01:27:53,107 --> 01:27:55,042
You know, that choice
you mentioned earlier

1327
01:27:55,076 --> 01:27:56,878
when you did have to choose,

1328
01:27:57,377 --> 01:28:00,615
would you ever
settle on a compromise,

1329
01:28:00,648 --> 01:28:02,984
or did you choose something
more convenient?

1330
01:28:03,017 --> 01:28:05,385
To be honest,
I didn't choose either.

1331
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,354
I took the easy way out.

1332
01:28:08,022 --> 01:28:09,289
Did it help?

1333
01:28:10,124 --> 01:28:11,659
Made me feel worse.

1334
01:28:13,828 --> 01:28:15,630
And I knew
it wouldn't fix things to stop

1335
01:28:15,663 --> 01:28:18,398
or go back,
so I just kept going.

1336
01:28:21,736 --> 01:28:23,971
They say hindsight's
always 20/20, right?

1337
01:28:26,607 --> 01:28:28,042
So going back was never
an option?

1338
01:28:33,648 --> 01:28:34,816
[Sam] Not for me.

1339
01:28:35,183 --> 01:28:36,851
It hasn't been.

1340
01:28:36,884 --> 01:28:38,619
That's because you're running
from something.

1341
01:28:39,587 --> 01:28:40,788
I don't run.

1342
01:28:41,088 --> 01:28:42,924
Don't lie to yourself like that.

1343
01:28:43,658 --> 01:28:45,793
You've been running
for a long time.

1344
01:28:47,128 --> 01:28:49,630
Afraid your responsibilities
have anchored you down.

1345
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:52,432
Afraid something one day
might catch up.

1346
01:28:53,067 --> 01:28:54,869
[tense music]

1347
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:59,106
How's Rebecca handling
everything?

1348
01:29:00,608 --> 01:29:01,676
She's scared.

1349
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:04,745
She's still scared.

1350
01:29:05,445 --> 01:29:06,547
And your wife?

1351
01:29:08,549 --> 01:29:09,784
And your wife?

1352
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,788
She's strong.

1353
01:29:17,158 --> 01:29:19,093
- How'd you know I'd be here?
- [Devon laughs]

1354
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:25,900
You're predictable, Sam.

1355
01:29:27,902 --> 01:29:29,436
You follow the same routine.

1356
01:29:29,469 --> 01:29:31,539
You listen to the same
radio stations.

1357
01:29:31,572 --> 01:29:34,542
You take the same way to work
at the same time every morning.

1358
01:29:38,512 --> 01:29:39,814
Now, I was here
the night you came

1359
01:29:39,847 --> 01:29:41,782
with your brother-
and sister-in-law.

1360
01:29:41,816 --> 01:29:45,052
I've sat in here and watched you
drink until close several times

1361
01:29:45,086 --> 01:29:46,654
right over there.

1362
01:29:48,122 --> 01:29:49,557
Creature of habit.

1363
01:29:51,959 --> 01:29:53,194
What if I make a scene?

1364
01:29:53,227 --> 01:29:55,630
[Devon laughs]

1365
01:29:58,099 --> 01:29:59,901
That would be stupid of you.

1366
01:29:59,934 --> 01:30:02,904
There's clearly a plan in place,
Sam, and you know that.

1367
01:30:04,071 --> 01:30:05,773
Let me ask you a question, Sam.

1368
01:30:05,806 --> 01:30:07,541
Why didn't you come clean

1369
01:30:07,575 --> 01:30:09,442
with the first piece
of leverage anyone had on you?

1370
01:30:11,112 --> 01:30:13,480
Before you killed someone
to protect it?

1371
01:30:14,749 --> 01:30:17,952
Like I said,
a creature of habit.

1372
01:30:20,054 --> 01:30:21,889
Tell me what to do next.

1373
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:26,727
You come with me quietly
in my car right now.

1374
01:30:26,761 --> 01:30:28,663
Then we drive back
to your house.

1375
01:30:29,196 --> 01:30:30,932
The police are already
gonna be there,

1376
01:30:30,965 --> 01:30:32,700
and so are your daughter
and wife.

1377
01:30:32,733 --> 01:30:34,201
Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry.

1378
01:30:34,735 --> 01:30:36,203
Her parents weren't hurt.

1379
01:30:36,237 --> 01:30:37,772
You know, we'll just...

1380
01:30:38,973 --> 01:30:40,541
We'll just drive over there

1381
01:30:40,574 --> 01:30:42,009
and, shit, you can tell them
everything, Sam.

1382
01:30:42,043 --> 01:30:43,978
You can tell them
fucking everything.

1383
01:30:45,947 --> 01:30:47,882
You can tell them
how we broke into your house,

1384
01:30:47,915 --> 01:30:49,550
stalked Rebecca,

1385
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:51,752
and you can even tell them
how we're the ones

1386
01:30:51,786 --> 01:30:53,754
who killed her boyfriend
when it's all over.

1387
01:30:54,722 --> 01:30:56,223
What do you think about that?

1388
01:30:57,758 --> 01:30:59,260
What do you get
in return for that?

1389
01:30:59,293 --> 01:31:00,995
[Devon laughs]

1390
01:31:01,729 --> 01:31:02,897
Come on.

1391
01:31:07,301 --> 01:31:10,771

Why are we doing this?

1396
01:31:20,915 --> 01:31:22,950
You're just gonna kill me
when we get there anyway.

1397
01:31:23,351 --> 01:31:25,485
[Devon] I can 100% assure you,

1398
01:31:25,753 --> 01:31:27,788
if you do everything I say,

1399
01:31:28,756 --> 01:31:30,024
it won't happen.

1400
01:31:30,891 --> 01:31:33,627
You went
to Oakridge University, yeah?

1401
01:31:34,929 --> 01:31:36,163
- [Devon shouts] Yeah?
- Yeah.

1402
01:31:36,731 --> 01:31:37,865
Yeah.

1403
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:43,604
You knew Molly Adwaller,
didn't you?

1404
01:31:45,272 --> 01:31:47,108
That's what this is about?

1405
01:31:51,645 --> 01:31:53,547
[Savannah] Just lower the gun.

1406
01:31:55,216 --> 01:31:56,217
Hey, you got us here.

1407
01:31:57,151 --> 01:31:58,819
Lower the gun.

1408
01:32:00,254 --> 01:32:02,590
I need you to lower the gun.

1409
01:32:03,824 --> 01:32:05,593
Hey, hey! Who's this guy?

1410
01:32:05,626 --> 01:32:07,261
What's his name?
Let's see your hands.

1411
01:32:07,294 --> 01:32:08,996
- Hands up!
- Show me your hands!

1412
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:10,898
Woah, woah, woah, woah!

1413
01:32:10,931 --> 01:32:12,967
Freeze, or I'll blow
your fucking brains out.

1414
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,635
Okay! Easy, easy, easy.

1415
01:32:17,605 --> 01:32:20,074
I want you all to put
your fucking guns down now!

1416
01:32:21,108 --> 01:32:22,877
Want us to lower the guns?

1417
01:32:23,544 --> 01:32:24,879
- Put them down!
- Okay, okay.

1418
01:32:25,212 --> 01:32:26,313
Put the guns down.

1419
01:32:27,114 --> 01:32:28,215
Look at me.

1420
01:32:30,284 --> 01:32:31,252
Just you and me here.

1421
01:32:32,019 --> 01:32:34,155
You're the one
who brought us here.

1422
01:32:35,056 --> 01:32:36,624
What are your demands?

1423
01:32:36,657 --> 01:32:38,125
For you to shut the fuck up
and listen!

1424
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,694
Okay, okay!
Okay, we're listening.

1425
01:32:41,395 --> 01:32:42,763
Listening to what?

1426
01:32:43,297 --> 01:32:45,866
[Devon] I want y'all to listen
to Mr. Hodges here.

1427
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,936
He's got a story I'd like
for him to tell all of you.

1428
01:32:49,737 --> 01:32:51,038
Right, Sam?

1429
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:57,912
- There was a girl...
- So they can hear you!

1430
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:00,848
Name was Molly.

1431
01:33:01,282 --> 01:33:02,883
She was at OU.

1432
01:33:04,085 --> 01:33:05,286
It was a party.

1433
01:33:06,854 --> 01:33:07,955
I was so drunk.

1434
01:33:07,988 --> 01:33:09,190
Tell the fucking story.

1435
01:33:09,223 --> 01:33:10,591
[Joyce] Sam!

1436
01:33:13,994 --> 01:33:15,229
She kept wanting to leave,

1437
01:33:15,262 --> 01:33:17,665
but I don't know why,

1438
01:33:18,299 --> 01:33:20,234
I followed her
to the bathroom and...

1439
01:33:21,335 --> 01:33:23,104
my friends held the door shut.

1440
01:33:26,073 --> 01:33:27,641
I didn't wanna scare her.

1441
01:33:28,409 --> 01:33:30,211
I just wanted to make her
feel bad

1442
01:33:30,244 --> 01:33:32,980
for making me look like a creep
in front of everybody

1443
01:33:33,013 --> 01:33:34,648
for just asking her out
on a fucking date!

1444
01:33:38,786 --> 01:33:41,055
I don't remember what she said
that pissed me off,

1445
01:33:41,088 --> 01:33:43,891
- but I hit her.
- Louder!

1446
01:33:43,924 --> 01:33:45,626
I beat her up!

1447
01:33:47,895 --> 01:33:49,864
I beat her up
until she was unconscious.

1448
01:33:49,897 --> 01:33:51,198
- Then I fucked her.
- Raped her.

1449
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:53,067
- I raped her! I raped her!
- Say it!

1450
01:33:57,104 --> 01:33:59,106
And she took it to the school.

1451
01:34:02,343 --> 01:34:05,246
But all my friends said
I wasn't at the party.

1452
01:34:09,116 --> 01:34:12,453
And my family lawyer
charged her with perjury

1453
01:34:12,486 --> 01:34:14,922
and defamation of character.

1454
01:34:17,491 --> 01:34:19,126
Then she left.

1455
01:34:20,828 --> 01:34:22,229
And we forgot.

1456
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:24,431
[Devon] She didn't forget.

1457
01:34:24,798 --> 01:34:27,401
She didn't forget.
She never forgot about you, Sam.

1458
01:34:28,002 --> 01:34:30,271
Every man that fucked her,
she remembered.

1459
01:34:31,772 --> 01:34:33,240
She fought a terrible fight.

1460
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:37,811
Dragging three sons from
different men along the way.

1461
01:34:42,116 --> 01:34:44,218
Her parents had rejected
their Catholic daughter

1462
01:34:44,251 --> 01:34:45,853
fallen from grace!

1463
01:34:47,888 --> 01:34:49,423
Her friends, she...

1464
01:34:49,456 --> 01:34:51,058
[Devon cries]

1465
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:52,726
There were no friends.

1466
01:34:53,528 --> 01:34:55,296
Only empty pill bottles and us.

1467
01:34:56,163 --> 01:34:59,033
Three young boys. Starving.

1468
01:34:59,767 --> 01:35:01,835
Regretting we couldn't
feed our mother!

1469
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:07,107
One of her suicide attempts
eventually was successful.

1470
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:10,512
And she left three parentless
children to the state.

1471
01:35:10,545 --> 01:35:11,779
Three!

1472
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:17,051
But we knew one man

1473
01:35:17,084 --> 01:35:18,819
better than the father
we never met,

1474
01:35:18,852 --> 01:35:20,154
and that was you, Sam.

1475
01:35:20,454 --> 01:35:21,989
[Devon laughs]

1476
01:35:22,022 --> 01:35:24,158
You see,
she always told us about you.

1477
01:35:24,725 --> 01:35:27,461
And we promised ourselves
one day we would find you.

1478
01:35:30,397 --> 01:35:32,333
You know what
she never told us though, Sam?

1479
01:35:32,366 --> 01:35:33,767
[Sam grunts]

1480
01:35:33,801 --> 01:35:35,402
Our oldest brother, Corey,

1481
01:35:36,303 --> 01:35:38,138
the one you shot last night...

1482
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:42,876
[Devon laughs]

1483
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:45,112
...she never did tell us
who his dad was.

1484
01:35:53,287 --> 01:35:54,455
Officers...

1485
01:36:02,096 --> 01:36:04,398
my brother and I are very sorry.

1486
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,867
[gun shots]

1487
01:36:10,605 --> 01:36:12,106
[Joyce cries]

1488
01:36:57,318 --> 01:37:00,921
[somber music]

1489
