00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:29,153
Bright Falls -
The Prequel to Alan Wake

2
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,069
So, Riley is, uh, surprising
us again tomorrow.

3
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:46,198
It's not gonna
be anyone left.

4
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,097
You're dying breed.

5
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:52,291
Jake, fine up,
we need the interview.

6
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,960
You know Riley
loves the book.

7
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:54,960
I bet.

8
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:56,960
Oh, and make sure to
get him a signed copy.

9
00:01:57,282 --> 00:01:58,960
Are we done?

10
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:00,556
Libby called again.

11
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:02,960
Hey, hold on a
second, alright?

12
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,819
I'm running out of excuses.

13
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,853
Hello?

14
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:11,760
Are you there?

15
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:14,596
I'm sorry, I had
to deal with that.

16
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:16,301
Have you been home?

17
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:18,093
<i>Come on, Hal.</i>

18
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:22,876
She, uh, didn't know you
were going to Bright Falls.

19
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:25,114
Well, I guess
she does now.

20
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:07,060
So, what are you, a
detective or Peeping Tom?

21
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,326
Uh, both.

22
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,460
Reporter.

23
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:14,351
Kinky.

24
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,268
Interesting choise of
the decor you have there.

25
00:03:19,303 --> 00:03:21,954
That's Alan Wake, the writer.

26
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,560
I am a big fan.

27
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:25,233
I can see that.

28
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:27,499
What can I say?
I like writers.

29
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,760
Wow, I didn't order this.

30
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:50,260
Happy birthday to you!

31
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:58,260
Happy birthday!

32
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:01,260
Happy birthday to you!

33
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:02,260
Happy birthday!

34
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:11,357
Bright Falls'
own deerfest

35
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:03,044
You Jake?

36
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,314
All it bucks of jiggle handle. Card
machine is down, so it'll have to be cash.

37
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:30,291
Just pay upon time.

38
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,050
You bet.

39
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,465
So is this quiet out here?

40
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:45,350
What did you do, you rid of
all the critters in the woods?

41
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:51,868
This quiet isn't what
you need to worry about.

42
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:37,850
<i>This is Pat Maine at KBF-FM.</i>

43
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:41,572
<i>Some people have asked me,
"What's the big deal about Deerfest?" </i>

44
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:47,138
<i>I think that this sums you know.
It's about friendship and community.</i>

45
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,107
Yeah, that's mainly
what the book's all about.

46
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,150
Still here.

47
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,308
Always.

48
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,138
You ever sleep?

49
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:04,819
I wonder why she
was wearing make up.

50
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:10,406
Hey!

51
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,637
It's great to see you again!

52
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,522
Great to see you too!

53
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:17,700
Sit.

54
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,908
How are things?

55
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:27,831
The same. Please don't ask
me about the weather.

56
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,150
How's Libby?

57
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,803
Good, you know, the same.

58
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:38,603
Will we just say
"good" or "the same"?

59
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,299
Forget it, don't answer,
you're here for business.

60
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:44,871
Yes.

61
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:47,067
The standard below
the full puffery.

62
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:49,794
What did you expect?
It's Bright Falls.

63
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:57,974
You know, I never figured
out why you moved here.

64
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,605
No, I guess not.

65
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:09,842
You know, I... I've actually
gotta run, deadlines.

66
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:13,201
If you need me,
you know where to find me?

67
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,008
Sure.

68
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,030
It's great to see you again.

69
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,272
You too.

70
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:32,242
Hi, Jake Fisher,
here to see Dr. Hartman.

71
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:33,841
Go right in.

72
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,948
Dr. Hartman, Jake Fisher.

73
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,567
What have you got there?

74
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:47,230
That's my camera, I use it to
record interviews if that's okay.

75
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,761
You're a writer, aren't you?

76
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:51,132
Yeah.

77
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:54,933
So... write.

78
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:04,518
So maybe you could start by telling me what
inspired your book "The Creator's Dilemma".

79
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:14,430
For years I talked with patients, who seem lost,
trapped in the reality of their own devising.

80
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:17,277
Can you imagine?

81
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:30,504
Neither could I, until I began to think
of their dilemma... as a universal one.

82
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,181
...It's really just about people.

83
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:54,732
Nice chatting, Jake.

84
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:02,482
If you need anything else
for your article, let me know.

85
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:15,426
Hey, this is Hal,
leave a message.

86
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:22,011
Hey, Hal. I, uh, I don't
know what happened. I, uh...

87
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Hey, wait!

88
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:38,300
<i>Daniel!</i>

89
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,300
Hey!

90
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:05,300
Hey! Um, can I talk
to you for a second?

91
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,300
Sure.

92
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,386
Some more private?

93
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:10,012
Okay.

94
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:15,305
Didn't Hartman say anything?

95
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,607
I don't think he knew.

96
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:21,968
And this morning I, uh
woke up in the woods...

97
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:26,973
And my arms were just all
covered in this like red mud.

98
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:31,117
So what do you think happened?
You can potter in your sleep?

99
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,920
No, I woke up in the woods.

100
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:38,551
Listen, sometimes staying out
here just gets in your head.

101
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:40,608
Well, I'm done with this story.

102
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:41,782
I know.

103
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:51,066
Call me if you need anything.

104
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,934
Thanks.

105
00:13:58,258 --> 00:14:00,783
You know... you're right.

106
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,286
When you're done with your
story you really should go.

107
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:06,800
Get back home, clear your head.

108
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,727
That's why I came here, Al.

109
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
I think you should leave.

110
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:12,639
I'm gonna have to
send out for this.

111
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,132
How long?

112
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:20,444
Oh, three... four...

113
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:22,360
...six days.

114
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,021
Six days?

115
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,867
Nothing... overnight?

116
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:29,681
Well, if I can get Mary
Beth to get Joe

117
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:34,020
to make his rounds up to
Fern Ridge for Tuesday...

118
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,225
That's pinning on the weather
tall elevation, of course.

119
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:05,507
Shel? My damn, what're you...

120
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:18,049
Wake alleged in the cause
$30000 equipment damages.

121
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,612
You alright?

122
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:26,026
Some woman just bit a
cop in the parking lot.

123
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:27,014
What?

124
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:38,673
You don't look so good, Jake.

125
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,162
Woman is like a feral animal!

126
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:55,603
Give me a towel!

127
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:59,157
Give some wet!

128
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,313
Deerfest - Bright Falls world
famous buckstravaganza

129
00:19:04,313 --> 00:19:07,218
featuring stag party
and the Doughboys!

130
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:10,144
Admission is only a buck.
So come back and come hungry,

131
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:15,597
and don't come alone. It's a feast
for the senses at Deerfest.

132
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,351
Jake, how are you doing?

133
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,251
I'm fine. Fine.

134
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:56,351
Your message got cut.
Everything go ok?

135
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,351
Yeah, you bet it.

136
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,030
Did you get the book
signed for Riley?

137
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:17,410
Can I talk to you for a
minute off the record?

138
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,137
Of course.

139
00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:24,364
Since I got here I've... I...

140
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:30,351
I've been blacking out and
waking up in really strange places.

141
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,230
What kinds of places?

142
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,607
In... the woods, the lake...

143
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:45,013
Look, I'm really weird when I live here,
it's... it's not gonna stop.

144
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:47,851
Anything else?

145
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:51,781
Yeah. I... I think I killed...

146
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:59,105
...a deer with my car.

147
00:23:01,998 --> 00:23:04,515
It happens.

148
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:10,084
May I?

149
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:21,455
You know, I help people with
problems just like yours.

150
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:26,242
Stay with us.

151
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:31,231
What the hell is that thing?!

152
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:32,415
Just a light.

153
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:33,860
Ah!

154
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:52,520
Can I help you?

155
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:57,392
When did you contact with
the owner of this motel?

156
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:00,548
Sam?

157
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:04,357
No, I haven't seen him in a couple days.

158
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:06,651
He's gone missing.

159
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:09,361
I've found his boy in the
woods looking for him.

160
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,800
May I?

161
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:14,799
Sure.

162
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:33,438
Well that's particular.

163
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:39,184
Well, I'm from the city, you know.

164
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:41,515
And uh...

165
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:46,553
It's gonna some kinda stupid but I...

166
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,896
...left the door open last night.

167
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:59,500
And... Some kind of wild
animal must have... came in here.

168
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:09,267
What squirrel animal did this?

169
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,606
You see the markings?
Well, I'd say it's a 14 points stag.

170
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,966
You know...

171
00:27:29,797 --> 00:27:31,030
See the pattern?

172
00:27:32,146 --> 00:27:34,853
Cut and buck.

173
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:38,254
Horn rib entry points.

174
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:44,561
You had a trophy deer here,
you know that?

175
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:49,028
Imperial. That first old
Sam'll have a prize.

176
00:27:54,801 --> 00:28:02,020
It's too bad a flue tube... probably
on some blender. It's got a bad habit.

177
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:10,134
Boys are gonna love this.

178
00:28:23,793 --> 00:28:25,839
<i>...had no idea...</i>

179
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:30,351
<i>Are you there?</i>

180
00:28:30,678 --> 00:28:31,196
What's wrong?

181
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:34,076
I need your help.
Come with me.

182
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:36,503
You have to tell me
what's happening.

183
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:38,005
Just drive.

184
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:45,851
Are you gonna say anything?

185
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,283
Where am I even heading?

186
00:28:48,283 --> 00:28:50,406
Just get me out.

187
00:28:50,924 --> 00:28:53,693
That's it. You just need
to ride out of town.

188
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,351
Why did you come looking for me?
You could've just driven yourself.

189
00:28:56,351 --> 00:28:57,851
No, I couldn't have.

190
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,082
I'm not in control.

191
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:03,851
What does that mean?

192
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:08,851
Jake!

193
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:46,851
What happened, officer?

194
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,077
Some guy missed the turn here.

195
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:51,686
Probably a deer or something.

196
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:53,953
Just be careful to this
next stretch of road.

197
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,488
Okay, thanks.
