1
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,807
There are places in my neighborhood
no one ever thinks about.

2
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,816
You see them every day
and every day you forget about them.

3
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:15,163
These are the places where all the things
happen that people are not allowed to see.

4
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,834
You see, in Brooklyn,
money changes hands all night long.

5
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,421
It's just not the kind
you can deposit in a bank.

6
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:28,882
All that money
needs to end up somewhere.

7
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,513
They call it a drop bar.

8
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,262
A bar the bosses choose randomly
each night...

9
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,352
...to be the safe for an entire city.

10
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,943
You never know up front
when your bar becomes the drop bar.

11
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,517
You just take all the city's dirtiest money...

12
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,942
...and bag men come and go
from all over town...

13
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:54,534
...and nobody ever sees it coming.
Nobody ever sees it going.

14
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:02,044
And then they could tell you
to be the drop bar next week.

15
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,877
Or maybe even next year.

16
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,551
The point is, you never know.

17
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,215
In the meantime...

18
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,880
...me...

19
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,386
...I just tend bar.

20
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,386
And wait.

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Bobby, you want to sprinkle the infield
with the general?

22
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,903
This is fucking awesome.
We spend $80 million...

23
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:37,162
...to drag a bunch of Jersey geriatrics
across the river to wet-shit their depends.

24
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,777
The old guard.

25
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,326
They're not that old.

26
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,460
You see Stackhouse block lebron
with his Walker?

27
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,168
Gentlemen, these are on the house.

28
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,997
When he speaks, he says nice things.

29
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,967
Rardy, can you clean that up?

30
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,677
Okay, if it's for Richie.

31
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,798
You got new pants, Sully?

32
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,515
Yeah, I'll send them to the dry cleaners.

33
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,975
-Rardy, we're not thanking you.
-Fuck you.

34
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,845
Fucking sphinx, that guy.

35
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,808
-Cousin Marv, thanks for the drink.
-Thanks, Marv.

36
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,150
Shall we say something for the kid?

37
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,492
-Sully, go ahead.
-Yeah, Sully, do it up.

38
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,159
Richie "glory days" whelan. Fort Hamilton,
class of '92 and a funny prick.

39
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,542
May he rest in peace.

40
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,499
Glory days.

41
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,329
Fucking a.

42
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,512
Let me guess.

43
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,180
You bought them the round.

44
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,176
Yeah. They're only...

45
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,180
They're celebrating the anniversary
of a very close friend, Marv.

46
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,062
The kid's been dead, what...10 years now?

47
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:55,244
Ought to be a point where you move on.
Stop scoring free drinks off a corpse.

48
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:59,737
Speaking of which, stop letting her ride
a stool all night and not pay for her drinks.

49
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,032
-Who, Millie?
-Yeah, Millie.

50
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,544
She doesn't drink that much.

51
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,752
When's the last time you charged her?

52
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,869
It's Millie, you know.

53
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:15,507
After midnight, you let her smoke in here
even though it's illegal.

54
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,877
You think I didn't know that?

55
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:21,642
If she can't pay her tab tonight,
she don't come back in here till she does.

56
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,557
Her bar tab is, like, 120 bucks.

57
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,386
It's about $140.

58
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,232
But she can't afford it, you know?

59
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,977
Yeah, I'm gonna start crying now. Okay?

60
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,399
And get all the candy canes
and Christmas shit down.

61
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,323
It's December 27th. Come on.

62
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,739
Gentlemen.

63
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,914
Why don't you go fuck yourselves?

64
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,936
...hallowed be thy name.

65
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:16,782
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

66
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,109
Give us this day our daily bread.

67
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,281
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

68
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,872
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

69
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,120
Peace be with you.

70
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,959
Peace be with you.

71
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,635
Peace be with you.

72
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,380
Body of Christ.

73
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,970
The body of Christ.

74
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,473
The body of Christ.

75
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,470
The body of Christ.

76
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,355
That's not good.

77
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,699
What are you doing in there?

78
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,536
All right. All right, now.

79
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,375
Hey. What are you doing in my trash?

80
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,551
You have a dog in your trash can.

81
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,881
It's a boxer.

82
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,217
Jesus.

83
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,562
You have a dog here in your trash.

84
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,566
This one's bleeding.

85
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,239
-What's your name?
-Bob saginowski.

86
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,414
Let me see your license.

87
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:36,753
My license? My wallet is in my pocket.
You'll have to take it out.

88
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:52,098
I just sent that picture to four people.
We clear?

89
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,479
-He's freezing.
-Yeah, well, it's cold.

90
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,598
Let's bring him inside.

91
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,284
I'm Nadia, by the way.

92
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,162
Is it bad?

93
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,158
It's not that deep, but, man.

94
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,964
Someone beat the shit out of this dog.
See these knots?

95
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,669
That's not skull, that's contusions.

96
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,457
Are you a vet?

97
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,299
No, I'm a waitress at the ashmont grill.

98
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,644
But I worked at animal rescue
one summer as a tech.

99
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,299
Careful.

100
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,981
They're so hard, this breed.
To find them a home.

101
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,143
Boxers?

102
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,306
This isn't a boxer. It's a pit bull.

103
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,822
That's a dangerous dog.

104
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,988
It's not the dog's fault his owner is a dick.

105
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,995
This guy...

106
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,993
...look at him.

107
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,329
He's nothing but sweet.

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,710
You'll need a crate--makes them feel safe.
I have one you can borrow.

109
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,724
And food and chew toys and stuff.

110
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:14,007
But I was, I was just passing a garbage can.
I can't--

111
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,846
-I'll just take him back.
-To who? The guy who beat him?

112
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,891
I'll take him to the proper authorities.

113
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,015
That would be the shelter.

114
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,062
Right.

115
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:28,029
After they give the owner seven days
to reclaim him, if he decides not to...

116
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,068
...this dog will be put up for adoption.

117
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,912
But who knows
what kind of person will take him?

118
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,371
I don't know.

119
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,366
You can take him. You take him.

120
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,714
I work nights. I work a lot.

121
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,923
We'll have to send him to animal rescue.

122
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,880
Okay, look, can you, can you...

123
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,721
...give me a couple days to think about it?
Please?

124
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,009
I have to think about this.
It's a big responsibility.

125
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,892
I don't know anything about--

126
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,599
please, just a couple days. I'll come back.

127
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,891
Please, a couple days.
Hold him till the weekend.

128
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:06,227
Just the weekend. It's a couple days.
Please. Please.

129
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,282
Saturday morning.

130
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,901
Thank you.

131
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,914
All right. Thank you.

132
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,949
Saturday.

133
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,582
Bob?

134
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,830
-The dog needs a name.
-Right.

135
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,589
Oh, my God.

136
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,551
You're going to be okay.

137
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:41,096
Do you know a Nadia Dunn? Nadia Dunn?

138
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,097
You don't?

139
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,186
You don't?

140
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,437
No.

141
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,268
That's the girl who's holding the dog.

142
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,778
The dog again.

143
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,447
You know, I was thinking
that training a dog...

144
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,951
...housebreaking, and all that, that's...

145
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:03,618
...I mean, that is
a huge responsibility, right?

146
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,123
Well, it's a dog.

147
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:11,553
It's not like some long-lost retarded
relative shows up in a wheelchair...

148
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,127
...a colostomy bag hanging out of his ass.

149
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,643
Says, "I'm yours now. Take care of me."

150
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,800
It's not that.

151
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,468
It's a dog.

152
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,146
Yeah.

153
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,124
What?

154
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,620
What?

155
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,041
No.

156
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,304
It's a fucking bad idea.

157
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,376
We should hit it for everything or not at all.

158
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,052
Little brother, listen.
My guy says we got to show him...

159
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,893
...that we can handle our shit.

160
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,309
Says we do it in steps.
See how the owners respond.

161
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,388
They could respond
pretty fucking bad, you nut.

162
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,061
So that's what we'll see.

163
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,735
Your guy. Your fucking guy
talks a whole hell of a lot.

164
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,195
It's a fucking drop bar.

165
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,910
Not tonight it isn't.

166
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:26,906
Okay?

167
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:29,919
Okay.

168
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,237
Don't think about it, just fill it.

169
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,619
Okay, we won't cause any trouble.

170
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,409
You're making trouble!

171
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,286
-Do you know what the fuck you're doing?
-Marv.

172
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,962
Do you know whose money this is?

173
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,619
Fucking fill the bag!

174
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,630
All right.

175
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,458
Just take it easy.

176
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,144
There you go.

177
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:30,938
Go ahead.

178
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,150
You fucking talk too much.

179
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,786
Where's rardy?

180
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,002
Rardy?

181
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,673
What the fuck?

182
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,460
-You all right?
-Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

183
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,798
-I'm okay.
-Look at his head.

184
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,010
Split open. We got to call an ambulance.

185
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:08,644
That's bad. Rardy, don't move.
Just stay where you are.

186
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,391
-How bad do I look?
-Don't move. It's not good.

187
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,074
I'm putting something on your head.

188
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,574
Hold that.

189
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,907
There's one for your face.

190
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,748
The 8 o'clock at St. dom's.

191
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,252
Every morning we see each other
and we've never met.

192
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:40,765
-Detective evandro Torres.
-Hi. I'm Bob saginowski.

193
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,677
-A shame about St. dom's.
-What do you mean?

194
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:49,427
I just found out they're folding it
into St. Mary's. Can you believe that?

195
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:50,848
I did not know that.

196
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,599
-You're the bartender?
-Yeah.

197
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,101
The guys with the guns--
want to take a walk?

198
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:59,274
They sound like anyone
who ever came in here before?

199
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:03,858
Nah. The guy closest to me,
I could see that his watch had stopped.

200
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:09,623
Officer Bernardo says you said they were
covered head to toe? Hoodies, masks?

201
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:13,538
Yeah, but I could see his wrist
as it was turning.

202
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:17,129
The face of the watch
was in front of me, like that.

203
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,789
-And it was stopped?
-Yeah. It said 6:15.

204
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,046
How much they take you for?

205
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,467
Well, whatever was in the register.

206
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,053
So, if I was to ask around,
I wouldn't hear anything about...

207
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:32,143
...anyone making book here,
or someone moving money around?

208
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,561
Excuse me?

209
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,479
-I wouldn't hear that?
-Nah.

210
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,898
-Do you have insurance, rardy?
-What do you think?

211
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,147
No, we don't have insurance.

212
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,743
-The whole thing's a travesty.
-Yeah, he took a pretty bad hit.

213
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,987
Nah, I meant St. dom's.

214
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,322
Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:51,244
Beautiful church. They did mass right.

216
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:55,663
No group hugs after the our father.
No folk singers.

217
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,751
By the time the seculars get done
persecuting the church...

218
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:02,751
...all we'll have left is a bunch of condos
with stained glass windows.

219
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,835
What's up with
the surveillance cameras in there?

220
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,841
They don't record.
They're just a deterrent for crime.

221
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,684
Why don't you take communion?

222
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,178
Excuse me?

223
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,516
I've seen you at mass for years.
You haven't taken communion once.

224
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,359
Well, you know, that's my business.

225
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,362
You think so, huh?

226
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,365
Yeah, I think so.

227
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,698
Jesus. I fucking know so.

228
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,706
So was he gonna let you
wear his letter jacket...

229
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,553
...or did he have to twist your nipples
a few times first?

230
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,972
Why the fuck would you tell that cop
about the watch?

231
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,389
-I don't know.
-You don't know.

232
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:53,638
It just came out.

233
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,559
Well, next time, why don't you
nip that impulse in the bud?

234
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,479
What the fuck is wrong with you?

235
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,808
It was very unlike me, Marv.

236
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,065
They took us for
five thou and some change.

237
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,741
Five thousand?

238
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,995
Thank God they picked up the envelope,
so we're not on the hook for that.

239
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,582
So we're all right. We're okay.

240
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:20,245
No, they took us for
five large and some change.

241
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,076
It's their bar, it's their money.

242
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:27,418
They're going to want it back.
So we're not so fucking okay.

243
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,185
Bob?

244
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,351
-You all right?
-Yeah.

245
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,099
-Kind of early for the eight.
-Yeah. I figured I could wait.

246
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,607
Well, come on in.

247
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,139
It's just a bowl and some food.

248
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,811
Thank you. Thank you.

249
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,313
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

250
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:00,015
You know, I've never owned a dog before...

251
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,179
...so, you know...

252
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:07,192
I have no idea what I'm doing. At all.

253
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,186
You'll need bowls.

254
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,858
A leash.

255
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,865
Poop bags.

256
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:25,873
And from now on,
keep your shoes up on a shelf.

257
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:30,552
Let me see if I can find the bed section.

258
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,050
What do you want?

259
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:41,889
This is the best book I know.
You should read it.

260
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,154
Everything is in here.

261
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,494
What are you naming him?

262
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:02,079
Well, I was thinking about maybe rocco.
I like the name rocco.

263
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,157
But then I thought Mike.

264
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,253
Mike?

265
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:11,092
-You don't like Mike?
-No. Mike is not a great name for a dog.

266
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,253
Rocco is better.

267
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,092
Okay.

268
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,258
So did they name you Nadia
after the gymnast?

269
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,511
-Yeah.
-So you're a gymnast?

270
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:22,933
No.

271
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,597
Here you go. See?

272
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,936
"Rocco". Hey, he likes it.

273
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,773
Yeah, I like Mike.

274
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:40,955
-You have him?
-Yeah.

275
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,455
Be patient.

276
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,787
Bye, thank you.

277
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:12,611
"Make sure the bottoms of the two
side panels rest inside the bottom."

278
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,329
Hey, rocco?

279
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,498
I made you a safe place.

280
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,023
Bob?

281
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,034
Cold one, huh?

282
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,987
Who needs snow blower
when you have Bob?

283
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,700
Maybe you come to my house later.

284
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,870
Sure.

285
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:07,872
I'm kidding.

286
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,453
This guy.

287
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,536
You on the welfare?

288
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,961
Excuse me?

289
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,459
Bob does all the work. You watch.

290
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,382
No, I was shoveling.

291
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,630
-You're shoveling, all right.
-He was.

292
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:22,553
Come.

293
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,581
You know this guy?

294
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:49,911
No.

295
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,832
But I know this guy.

296
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,329
Moment I know him, I know him.

297
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,087
Somebody robbed my bar.

298
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,260
Yes. That's right. I'm sorry, Mr. umarov.

299
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,265
Call my father Mr. umarov.

300
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:09,514
Bob...

301
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,768
...call me chovka, eh?

302
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:16,017
That's right, I'm sorry, Mr. chovka,
somebody did rob your bar.

303
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,771
Who robbed our bar?

304
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,356
We don't know. They wore masks.

305
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,609
That's right. So we couldn't see.

306
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,781
Police report says
one wore a broken watch.

307
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:26,912
You tell them this?

308
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:31,869
Yeah, I did. I wasn't thinking.
It just came out.

309
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,710
So what are you doing
to get my father's money back?

310
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,628
Well, we put the word out.

311
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,786
-In the neighborhood.
-That's right.

312
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,958
They got the word out in the neighborhood.

313
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,216
So the word is out there, huh?

314
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,138
-The word.
-That's right.

315
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,390
With my money.

316
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,308
Find my fucking money.

317
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,585
"Find my money."

318
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:17,668
If we knew where their money was,
it would mean we knew who robbed us.

319
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,460
Which would mean we were in on it,
which means they'd shoot us in the face.

320
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,003
Fucking chechnyans.

321
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:26,006
Chechens, Marv.

322
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,511
They're from chechnya,
but you call them chechens.

323
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,104
Yeah, chechnya.

324
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:39,349
I said that. You don't call people
from Ireland irelandians, do you?

325
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,695
What the fuck are you talking about?

326
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:52,284
Yo, yo. What's the sunset
nightcap this evening?

327
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:56,044
-You bring your own cup?
-What, I just got out of the womb?

328
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,041
-Cheers.
-Salud.

329
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:03,711
So what up, evandro?

330
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,802
You remember Marvin stipler?

331
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,298
Cousin Marv?

332
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,301
He got pushed off his own book,
nine, ten years ago, by the chechens.

333
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:15,222
His bar got held up. It's owned by
one of papa umarov's shell companies.

334
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,767
What kind of dumb-ass
holds up one of his bars?

335
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:18,889
You got me.

336
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,312
Major crimes up on the umarovs?

337
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,654
We barely survived the last budget cuts.

338
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,240
We're not sticking our heads up to go after
some Russian John q barely knows exists.

339
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:30,488
Chechen.

340
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,576
You want him, he's all yours.

341
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,091
Hey, baby brother, you ready to eat?

342
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,510
-What?
-Are you ready to eat?

343
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,430
No.

344
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,721
I ate already.

345
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:57,103
-I ate already.
-When did you eat?

346
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,430
I ate.

347
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,608
Oh, no. Hey, hey, no.

348
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:15,125
Rocco, stay there. Stay.

349
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,124
Don't do it.

350
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,289
Don't do it. Don't jump.

351
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,459
Crikey Jesus.

352
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,629
That was close.

353
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,628
You gave me a heart attack.

354
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,731
-Where the fuck you been?
-Getting here.

355
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,145
-You got the money?
-No.

356
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:52,818
-What do you mean, no?
-I mean no 'cause fucking bri has it.

357
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,241
Bri has it.

358
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,493
-Did you tell your brother about me?
-No.

359
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:59,493
Why the fuck you hit rardy so hard?

360
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:01,415
-I had to.
-You had to.

361
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:04,923
And I had to call an ambulance.
So there's an ambulance and cops.

362
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,500
What's with his watch?

363
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:11,262
People noticed it's broke. Tell him
to get a new one and get rid of that one.

364
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:12,843
Today.

365
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:19,604
What's the next step?
When do we hit a real drop bar?

366
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:23,348
Let's just assume I'm not some asshole
without a plan, okay?

367
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:26,442
When an airplane goes down, what's
the safest airline to fly the next day?

368
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,692
The one that had the crash.

369
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,364
Right. There you go.

370
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:31,779
So we just wait.

371
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,987
I don't understand
a fucking word you're saying.

372
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,360
It's like you're speaking Brazilian.

373
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,698
Just let me take care of it, okay?

374
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,794
Keep your head down.

375
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,866
It's not Brazilian.
Brazilians speak Portuguese.

376
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:44,964
Where you going?

377
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,248
I'm leaving.

378
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,461
Stay here.
We can't be seen together, genius.

379
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,880
-Fuck you. How long?
-I don't know. Ten minutes!

380
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,381
Sit.

381
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,222
Sit. No, that's standing. Come here.

382
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:58,392
Go, go. Oh, man.

383
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:07,728
How you doing?

384
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,980
Good.

385
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,401
Shit. Rocco, come on!

386
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,074
Come. Good boy.

387
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,899
You didn't read the book, did you?

388
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:19,574
Some of it, yeah. No.

389
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,078
Not a lot.

390
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,080
I was thinking--now the holiday's over...

391
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:26,829
...I lost a shift at the restaurant.

392
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,422
I'm sorry.

393
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,590
So maybe you could hire me, you know?

394
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:37,588
Pay me to babysit rocco
when you're working?

395
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,600
Hey, well, that's not such a bad idea.

396
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,100
I work a lot at the bar.

397
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:46,689
That would be very kind of you.

398
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,939
You have a number I can call?

399
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:53,268
Maybe call.
You want to arrange this properly?

400
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:55,863
Just put it there.

401
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,951
-Have you got a pen?
-No.

402
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:00,871
I think I have a pen.

403
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,948
Where's that pen when you need it?

404
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,885
-Does it work?
-Yeah.

405
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,799
Here you go.

406
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,474
Great. That's a great idea.

407
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,143
And I need a key.

408
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:27,808
Well, like, maybe I could...
If you call me, I'll either have it...

409
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,153
...and drop it around yours,
or I could leave it at the bar for you.

410
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Call me.

411
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:36,154
Yeah, I'll call you...On this number
you gave me right now.

412
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:37,863
Happy new year, by the way!

413
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:40,317
Happy new year!

414
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:48,328
We should join that show.

415
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,503
You can't fucking sing.

416
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,009
Not that one, the other one,
where the people...

417
00:29:57,256 --> 00:30:00,836
...go around the world
picking up clues and stuff.

418
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,506
It'd be cool. Let's do it.

419
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,677
We could see things.

420
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,522
What things?

421
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:10,847
I don't know. Other countries.

422
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,693
Other ways.

423
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:16,193
You see the old man today?

424
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,193
Yeah, I was by.

425
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,034
They want their money, Marv.

426
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:27,038
Who?

427
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:28,866
The home.

428
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,459
They'll get it.

429
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:34,207
It's the collection agency now,
not the home.

430
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:38,213
Medicaid cutbacks. Me retiring.

431
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:41,378
They're going to ship him out.

432
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:44,965
To where?

433
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,060
To a lesser place.

434
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,062
Maybe it's time.

435
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:54,555
Yeah.

436
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,241
Just kill him.

437
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,156
Our father. Because it's inconvenient.

438
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:06,407
He's dead, Marv.

439
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,580
So what are all those beeps
coming out of the machines...

440
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:13,669
...he's hooked up to, and the waves
on the screen of the thing?

441
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,579
That's life.

442
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,091
That's electricity, is what that is.

443
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:30,768
The other day, I picked up his hand
and put it on my cheek.

444
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:34,775
And I could hear his blood.

445
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:41,937
So you want to unplug him?
Go ahead, your decision.

446
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,607
Take it easy.

447
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:46,112
No, make the decision.
I'll be all right with it.

448
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:51,872
That'd be a first.

449
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,959
Never mind. It's okay.

450
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,885
I'll get to Europe in another life.

451
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:02,595
Rocco. Come to heel.

452
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:05,433
Come to heel. Come to heel. And sit.

453
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,093
-You see that?
-Yeah, I saw it.

454
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,718
He almost gave me the paw.

455
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:14,434
When I watch TV, he sleeps on my leg.

456
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,268
-Really?
-Out.

457
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,943
-Come.
-I'll be right back.

458
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:23,441
Crazy. Come on.

459
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:37,925
That's a nice dog.

460
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:40,956
Thank you. I appreciate it.

461
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,302
Yeah, that's a nice-looking dog.

462
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:55,643
Don't forget to feed it.

463
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,319
Tell me where the hospital is?

464
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:15,326
Bang a u-ey, go down to the end here.

465
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:18,162
Take a right. There'll be signs.

466
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,133
Thanks.

467
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:43,523
I promise, tomorrow we'll go to the park.
But I'm in a mad rush today.

468
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,191
I will be back very soon.

469
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,840
Hey, man, how you doing?

470
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,683
Mind if I step in? It's kind of cold outside.

471
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,769
Thanks a lot.

472
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:21,599
Jesus.

473
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:30,948
Can I help you?

474
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:33,526
Yeah. Where are you keeping him?

475
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:35,702
What are you talking about?

476
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:40,462
The dog. You keep him in the kitchen?
The cellar?

477
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:47,304
I remember you. You came up to me in the
park and told me I had a nice-looking dog.

478
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:50,126
Yeah, well, he's not your dog.

479
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:53,133
Yeah, he's my dog.

480
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,385
Yeah? You register him?

481
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:59,467
City says you have to license it.
How about a chip?

482
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:01,975
-Excuse me?
-A security chip.

483
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:06,227
Implanted in the dog. Pooch goes missing,
shows up at a vet. Vet scans the dog.

484
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,821
Up pops a barcode with the owner's info.

485
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,817
The owner, meanwhile,
walks around with a slip of paper.

486
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:16,115
It has the security chip
account number on it.

487
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:17,328
Check it out.

488
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,665
You got my dog.

489
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,498
No, it's my dog.

490
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:30,591
You beat him.

491
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,337
I'll tell the cops you did.

492
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:37,014
What do you want?

493
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,853
It's kind of sunny, right?

494
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:56,867
But you never know, I guess.

495
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:36,566
You never ask about it.

496
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:42,737
You're the only person I ever met who
didn't ask about it in the first five minutes.

497
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,950
It's your business, not mine.

498
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:49,747
You'll tell me when you tell me,
or you won't.

499
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:54,756
I did it to myself. I was pretty high.

500
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,680
You did that?

501
00:36:58,594 --> 00:37:00,264
With one of those...

502
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:01,926
...like, a peeler.

503
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,264
Peeler?

504
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,675
You know, a potato peeler?

505
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:08,774
Oh, God, yeah, I know what that is, right.

506
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,950
I was a different person then.
I didn't really like myself.

507
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:20,454
Do you like yourself now?

508
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:26,791
Sir, you cannot have a dog in here.
Dog goes, you guys go, okay?

509
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:40,641
I'm telling you...

510
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:43,299
-...I got guys following me.
-You don't.

511
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:45,805
I do. I told you about the guy in the car.

512
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:48,388
He was asking you for directions.

513
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:52,978
It was the way he asked.
The way he was looking at me.

514
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:54,483
I'm not a fucking idiot.

515
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:01,317
What about you?
The guy with the umbrella.

516
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:04,407
He's just interested in the dog.

517
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,083
The dog.

518
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:10,002
How do you know?
Maybe he's just telling you that.

519
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:17,378
It's too much for them to...

520
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:20,762
...put them back where they found them,
because that would require courtesy.

521
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:23,506
You should just get a dumpster, Marv.

522
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:27,346
"Just get a dumpster, Marv.
Get a dumpster."

523
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:28,853
Sure.

524
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:32,188
You remember I don't
own the bar anymore, right?

525
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:34,692
Yeah.

526
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:37,694
Yeah, but it's not your bar chovka took.

527
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:39,283
That was 10 years ago.

528
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:41,698
No, it was eight-and-a-half years ago.

529
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:43,871
All right.

530
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,199
Eight-and-a-half years.

531
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:03,893
Dottie thinks we should visit Europe.

532
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:07,809
That's what I've become--
a guy that goes to Europe with his sister.

533
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,060
Hops in a, a tour bus...

534
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,560
...with a fucking camera around my neck
like a fucking jerkoff.

535
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:21,816
What?

536
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:27,738
You need to see this, Marv.

537
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:30,247
No, I don't.

538
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:32,906
I don't need to do anything.

539
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:40,588
I'm just going to stand right here.
I'm going to stand right the fuck here.

540
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,093
No.

541
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:45,088
You really should take a look at this.

542
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:49,597
I don't need to see Europe.
I don't need to see dottie.

543
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,268
And I don't need to see what's in that bag.

544
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,946
What the fuck?

545
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:17,791
We need to do something with it.

546
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:19,964
What, the money or the...

547
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:21,497
...thing?

548
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:24,377
I bet what's in here adds up to
what we lost that night.

549
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,303
Why'd they give it back to us?

550
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:28,805
So we give it back to them.

551
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,641
That's clearly what they expect.

552
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:55,158
Like you're wrapping a piece of meat.

553
00:40:57,499 --> 00:40:59,749
Like you've done it a thousand times.

554
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,509
Do you wonder if
you hadn't mentioned the watch...

555
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:13,774
No, I don't.

556
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:15,426
Well, I do.

557
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,189
Hi, guys. You got any zima?

558
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,518
No, we're closed.

559
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:23,527
Well, your door was unlocked, so--

560
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:26,435
I'm sorry about that,
but we're closed now, so...

561
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:28,859
Yeah. Yeah.

562
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:30,124
You got to go.

563
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:31,615
Hey, Bob.

564
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:34,538
How you doing? Nice to see you.

565
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:37,211
All right, come on.

566
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,051
Say hi to Nadia.

567
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:48,216
Don't forget to stitch her up
when she stabs herself, okay?

568
00:41:56,892 --> 00:42:00,562
Tossing the missing piece of
the one-armed man around like a ham...

569
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:02,652
...and the front door's open!

570
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,903
-He didn't see anything.
-But he could've.

571
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:08,566
But he didn't.

572
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,739
You know that guy?

573
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:15,992
Yeah. That's the guy
I told you about with rocco.

574
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:18,085
Who claims the dog is his?

575
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,576
You know who else he is?

576
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:23,666
No.

577
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,840
He's the guy who says
he killed Richie whelan.

578
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:34,935
-That guy?
-Yeah.

579
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:38,931
-That's Eric deeds?
-Yeah, that's Eric deeds.

580
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:42,522
And he's fucked in the squash, that guy.

581
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,772
Been in the joint a couple times.

582
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:48,526
He did a 30-day in the cuckoo house,
if I recall.

583
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:51,198
So you watch that fucking kid.

584
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,950
Some fucking day, Marv.

585
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,789
Yeah, some fucking day.

586
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:05,464
Will you pass me the sports bag
by the wasp-and-ants spray?

587
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:07,464
Yeah, sure, I'd love to.

588
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:09,884
Thank you.

589
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,478
I'm going for a walk now.

590
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:28,319
Okay.

591
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,330
Fucking Christ.

592
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,767
Don't look at that. Don't look at it.

593
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:08,862
Hey, hey, what's this?

594
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:10,777
Go get it. Go on.

595
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:15,697
Yeah, play with it. My big red bone.

596
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:18,375
Go get it. Go get that!

597
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,200
Get the bone!

598
00:44:43,225 --> 00:44:44,315
Shit.

599
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,810
Mr. saginowski.

600
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:52,728
-How you doing?
-I'm good.

601
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:58,735
We haven't caught them yet.

602
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:01,581
Yeah, well, you know, I assumed...

603
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,750
That we didn't do our job?

604
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,670
No, I just heard it was hard to
make an arrest on robbery cases.

605
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:13,422
-What's up with the bag?
-This is...

606
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:17,425
It's my poop bag and sometimes
I keep leashes and balls...

607
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,256
...and stuff in my bag.

608
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:20,851
Kind of empty.

609
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:25,933
Yeah, well, I used my last poop bag
and I lost the ball.

610
00:45:28,437 --> 00:45:29,767
Richie whelan.

611
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:32,936
-What about him?
-You know him?

612
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:37,112
Sure. His friends were in the bar
the other day, toasting his anniversary.

613
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:38,953
What anniversary?

614
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,198
Of the last time anybody saw him.

615
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,530
Which was at your bar.

616
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:44,954
That's right. Yeah, he left.

617
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:47,787
He took his car
and they found it someplace.

618
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:50,133
Astoria. Torched.

619
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,251
That's a good-looking dog.

620
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:53,634
Thank you.

621
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:56,303
You know an Eric deeds?

622
00:45:57,633 --> 00:46:00,973
Tall guy? Beard? He's, like, a brooder?

623
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:03,047
Maybe.

624
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:05,975
I mean, you working in that bar. Come on.

625
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:09,138
You know people, Mr. saginowski.

626
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:11,648
I got a picture.

627
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:21,991
Nah. You think maybe he robbed the bar?

628
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:23,324
No.

629
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:27,373
I'm hearing here and there that this guy...

630
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:30,002
...has something to do with
the whelan disappearance.

631
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:32,997
Really?

632
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,840
That's a really good-looking dog.

633
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:01,361
I came by to give him his afternoon walk.

634
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:02,613
Great.

635
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:05,035
I freaked. Is your cell on?

636
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:09,037
Yeah, but it's on vibrate. I couldn't feel it.

637
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:10,708
I called a bunch of times.

638
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:13,116
I know, I could see that. I'm sorry.

639
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,875
-I thought you were working today.
-I am, it's just I had this...

640
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:20,222
You know what? It's a really long story.

641
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:23,389
I'm sorry. I should have called you.
I apologize.

642
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:25,389
It's okay. Hey.

643
00:47:25,888 --> 00:47:28,058
So you know Eric deeds, huh?

644
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:32,562
No. I don't "know him" know him...

645
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:35,905
...you know? I know him from around.

646
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:38,232
So you don't know him?

647
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:40,567
Not really, no.

648
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:45,237
That's funny, because
the way he said it, I figured...

649
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:47,164
Figured what?

650
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:49,913
I don't know. You know, maybe...

651
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:52,905
-I don't know.
-Why are you on my ass about it?

652
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:55,669
I was just asking a question.

653
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:57,498
No, you were insinuating.

654
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:59,496
No, I wasn't.

655
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:03,759
Now you're arguing just to argue with me.

656
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:05,676
No.

657
00:48:05,928 --> 00:48:06,928
-See?
-I'm not.

658
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:09,506
I don't need this shit, okay?

659
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:14,443
Wait. What happened here?
Did I say something wrong?

660
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,944
You think you can push me around?

661
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:20,364
No. Wait.

662
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:22,609
Don't you fucking touch me.

663
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:47,468
I don't understand.

664
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:53,139
I asked her one question.

665
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:57,809
A question. Simple.
And then it all came out sideways.

666
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:02,652
You don't get it. They get in a mood...

667
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:07,071
...you could give them the hope diamond
and they'd complain about the weight.

668
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:08,492
Am I right?

669
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,580
Bob, you ain't actually
talking about a girl, are you?

670
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:13,497
Bobby's got himself a girl?

671
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:17,003
Guy gets a dog, becomes a pussy magnet.

672
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:19,502
They're flinging it at my man now.

673
00:49:23,422 --> 00:49:25,092
I'm gonna go play some pool.

674
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:33,006
How are you?

675
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,020
Chovka, let me get you a drink.

676
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:43,191
Marv? Stella--Andre, he drinks Stella.

677
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:58,035
There you go.

678
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:04,385
Here it is.

679
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:11,045
I put it in a ziploc.
But it's all there. You can count it.

680
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:13,467
Ziploc?

681
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:15,722
Well, it was a little wet.

682
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:19,888
I was going to dry it,
but we don't have a dryer.

683
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:23,149
So I figured I'd put it in a ziploc.
If you spread it out...

684
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:26,738
...on a table,
it should be good come the morning.

685
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:30,319
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Bob.

686
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:32,489
This isn't what you gave me last time.

687
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:35,081
That? No, that's not the bowmore 18.

688
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:38,410
You didn't like it.
You said it smelled like feet.

689
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:43,747
I figured that you would prefer this
a lot more. This is very special.

690
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:52,089
It's Irish.

691
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,361
We die.

692
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:05,773
All of us...

693
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:07,191
...Andre.

694
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:11,446
But before you do, you have to
try this fucking whiskey, man.

695
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:15,204
Yeah, get him one. Come on. Here.

696
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:22,956
You handle the drop.

697
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:25,788
All right. Which night?

698
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:27,961
Super bowl.

699
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,300
Okay.

700
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:42,813
Is good.

701
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,570
Detective evandro Torres.

702
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:59,659
-Jimmy Sullivan.
-Thanks for seeing me.

703
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:03,162
So you got nothing else about
the night glory days vanished?

704
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:07,245
The only thing I remember
was that he left the bar to score weed.

705
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:10,673
And the guys he got it from
were a couple of shitheads.

706
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:15,676
A nutjob named deeds and
his junkie buddy-- what was his name?

707
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:18,138
Tim Brennan.
He was in the original statement.

708
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,350
That's the guy.

709
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:23,689
He was going to see them both?
Or only one?

710
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:25,846
I don't remember.

711
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:31,863
But Bob saginowski and cousin Marv?

712
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:35,031
-You trying to tie them to this?
-Nah, I just--

713
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,780
you got me out here in front of the guys
I work with, looking like a snitch.

714
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:41,544
Thanks for that. But cousin Marv's place?

715
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:45,540
That's my bar. All right?
Don't fuck with my bar.

716
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,520
You know, I'm...

717
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,270
I'm sorry.

718
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:13,535
I don't care if you know him.

719
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:14,937
It's just that...

720
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:19,779
...the way that he said hi, you know,
it sounded like it meant something.

721
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:22,541
I was just asking.

722
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:27,212
What else did he say?

723
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,381
He said that rocco was his.

724
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:34,384
That he has a chip in his neck to prove it.

725
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,409
He used to be my boyfriend.

726
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:08,583
In the beginning, he was charming.

727
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:10,919
He was really nice.

728
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:15,265
I know a lot of people said things
about him, but I don't judge people.

729
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:16,587
I don't want to prejudge people.

730
00:54:17,758 --> 00:54:19,048
Sure.

731
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:21,426
It just became too much.

732
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:25,102
I haven't seen him in a while.
I thought he was gone.

733
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:46,788
I'm sorry.

734
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:50,115
I'm so sorry.

735
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,461
-I'm sorry.
-You don't have to explain.

736
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,752
Everybody has a past.

737
00:54:57,297 --> 00:55:00,967
And if this guy put rocco in your trash,
that's not your fault.

738
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:05,141
And as for rocco, he won't blame you.
You know?

739
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:08,313
He don't know no better.

740
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:26,829
He's not just going to go away.

741
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,330
Eric? No.

742
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:32,671
He doesn't strike me as the type
that wants to do that.

743
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,500
He's not.

744
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:40,515
He killed a kid named glory days.

745
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:47,182
Yeah. I heard that.

746
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:50,175
I heard that.

747
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,480
Richie whelan.

748
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:56,307
Why?

749
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,190
I don't know.

750
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,029
He's not a big fan of "why". Eric.

751
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:09,044
It's broken.

752
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:12,211
Yeah, it is.

753
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,921
Do you want me to fix it?

754
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,090
-You want to fix it?
-Yeah.

755
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:22,259
Sure.

756
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:24,935
You want another beer?

757
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,430
Yeah.

758
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:43,447
So I heard that cousin Marv
doesn't own the bar?

759
00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:45,609
That some hard guys do.

760
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:48,284
But you're not a hard guy.

761
00:56:48,951 --> 00:56:51,121
So why do you work there?

762
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:54,207
You know me and cousin Marv
go way back, right?

763
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:57,206
Yeah, Marv is actually my cousin.

764
00:56:57,459 --> 00:56:58,459
Yeah?

765
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:01,304
Marv and his sister, dottie...

766
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:05,470
...his father and my mother,
they're all sisters.

767
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:06,797
Really?

768
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:08,892
Did they share makeup?

769
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:10,967
Why would they do that?

770
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:14,774
You said they were sisters.

771
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:18,150
You're right. Yeah. You know what I mean.

772
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:21,147
Why are you jumping on me like that?

773
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:23,323
-It's fun.
-Fun.

774
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:26,147
Fun.

775
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:31,991
Yeah, Marv thought he was a tough guy.

776
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:35,499
We had a crew once.

777
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:38,537
Back in the day, when we was young,
we made a little money...

778
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:40,504
...but it was never, you know...

779
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:44,513
So a mean crew rolls into town,
and, you know...

780
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:48,091
...we flinched. That's it. End of the crew.

781
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:50,514
But you're still in the life.

782
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:52,512
Me? No.

783
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:54,852
No. No, no, no.

784
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:57,194
I just tend the bar.

785
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:14,945
What are you doing? Get in.

786
00:58:15,204 --> 00:58:16,544
You fucking come out here.

787
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:18,618
Are you nuts? It's freezing! Get in.

788
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:20,884
I'm not getting in the car!

789
00:58:21,877 --> 00:58:23,547
You think the trunk's lined with plastic?

790
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:25,209
How should I know?

791
00:58:25,464 --> 00:58:28,134
Here, go look then. Go ahead.

792
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:34,716
Don't you fuck with me.
Don't you fucking dare!

793
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:37,064
-Nobody's fucking with you.
-You hear?

794
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:39,727
-All right?
-Yeah.

795
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,070
Want to call your mommy
and tell her you're okay?

796
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:52,490
Don't joke. Last time anybody saw
my brother alive, he got in a car with a guy.

797
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:53,831
All right.

798
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:56,913
You're right. I'm sorry.

799
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:00,667
Take it easy.

800
00:59:03,752 --> 00:59:07,092
What we got here is
a risk-versus-reward kind of thing.

801
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:11,589
We took the risk. And up to now,
it's not been working out so well, I know.

802
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:13,184
Yeah, but?

803
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:17,603
But I know where
the super bowl drop off will be.

804
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:21,846
So if you want to hit them back for bri,
you hit them back for a million.

805
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:24,274
It's suicide. Fucking suicide.

806
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:25,936
I got news for you, fitzy.

807
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:28,783
We're dead already,
we're just walking around.

808
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:31,281
The only way to get out is to leave.

809
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,530
I'm not doing another one, man.

810
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:35,952
-You're not?
-I'm not.

811
00:59:36,952 --> 00:59:38,952
-You sure about that?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

812
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:42,035
Okay, I'll square it with you then.

813
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:45,789
I'm buying something with it.

814
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:49,302
First, you don't tell anybody
what we just discussed.

815
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,631
You don't tell anybody.

816
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:56,301
Second, I need a place
to hole up for a couple days.

817
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:58,472
What, you're on the street?

818
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,057
-You didn't close the trunk.
-I closed it.

819
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,730
Not very well.

820
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:07,905
I closed that fucking thing.

821
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,400
Forget about the trunk.
No, I'm not on the street.

822
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:14,657
Everybody knows where I live.
Nobody knows where you live.

823
01:00:15,574 --> 01:00:19,664
So can I shack up with you tonight
or maybe tomorrow night?

824
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:21,752
Not with me, but I know a place.

825
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:23,327
All right?

826
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:25,082
Got cable?

827
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:28,174
-Motherfucker, what?
-You know, cable.

828
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:30,511
Fuck you.

829
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:35,684
You have to get behind it!
Slam it with two hands!

830
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:46,577
Here you are.

831
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:55,089
Good night.

832
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,590
Good night.

833
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:00,597
I got that.

834
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:04,925
Bob?

835
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:08,272
Thanks.

836
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:10,267
For what?

837
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:13,611
Good night.

838
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:38,802
Sorry I was so long.

839
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:42,468
I didn't take you with me.
You want a Chewie?

840
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:16,335
Here.

841
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,970
There you go. For you.

842
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:25,638
-Mind if I sit down?
-No, have a seat.

843
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:36,187
What's up?

844
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:42,817
I was wondering
why you don't like my cousin.

845
01:03:42,865 --> 01:03:44,495
He took my dog.

846
01:03:45,242 --> 01:03:46,282
He didn't take your dog.

847
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:48,496
You beat the crap out of it
and put it in a trash can.

848
01:03:49,705 --> 01:03:51,375
I felt bad about it.

849
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,380
That count?

850
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:55,668
Yeah.

851
01:03:56,044 --> 01:03:57,384
Okay, good.

852
01:03:58,046 --> 01:03:59,376
And now you want it back.

853
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:02,723
What kind of question is that?
I don't know what I want.

854
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:04,548
I don't know.

855
01:04:05,387 --> 01:04:09,017
But I don't want him walking around
thinking he's the shit.

856
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:11,018
He needs to learn.

857
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,890
Learn what?

858
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:15,017
That he shouldn't have fucked with me.

859
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,860
Are you fucking with me?

860
01:04:19,902 --> 01:04:21,572
Me? No, no.

861
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:24,532
I'm too old for that shit. I come in peace.

862
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:27,083
Why is that? Is there a war?

863
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:29,236
Not that I know of.

864
01:04:30,037 --> 01:04:31,197
Good.

865
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,540
In the bar the other night,
you made my cousin nervous.

866
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:37,209
You don't see that often.

867
01:04:38,086 --> 01:04:41,256
I think there's a way
you and I can sort that out...

868
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,590
...and both be happy.

869
01:04:57,606 --> 01:05:00,276
Look at you. You're looking good.

870
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:04,112
Eric deeds' psych file.

871
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:06,954
You got three minutes to read it.
There better be no grease on those fingers.

872
01:05:24,466 --> 01:05:25,966
Well, I'll be damned.

873
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,140
Like you fucking weren't already?

874
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:33,813
What? Not what you were expecting?

875
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,640
My file?

876
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:38,652
Yeah.

877
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:17,194
You know what you're gonna do?

878
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:19,847
You got to give me 10.

879
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:24,861
Ten grand. By tomorrow morning.

880
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:28,861
-Who's got $10,000?
-Come on.

881
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:33,875
Listen. You want the dog,
you give me 10. Simple.

882
01:06:34,703 --> 01:06:38,873
Listen here, pal. You can't walk into
people's lives and expect them to--

883
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:42,376
listen, listen. Take it easy. Listen to me.

884
01:06:42,669 --> 01:06:45,669
That is life. That's what it is.

885
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:48,884
People like me coming along
when you're not looking.

886
01:06:49,218 --> 01:06:52,218
Just get my money, 10:00 A.M.,
your place, okay?

887
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:56,224
And if you don't get it,
I'll go to the cops and get my dog back.

888
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:59,847
Simple. And then I'll forget
to feed it for a while.

889
01:06:59,895 --> 01:07:02,525
And then when the dog
gets all yappy about it...

890
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:07,066
...I'll beat his fucking head with a rock.

891
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,900
All right? You picture that.

892
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:13,414
Yeah.

893
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:17,584
Remember what I did to Richie whelan.

894
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:19,247
Yep.

895
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:23,752
And I had a partner back then.
I still have him.

896
01:07:25,254 --> 01:07:26,424
You okay?

897
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:28,723
Okay. It was good to see you.

898
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:46,436
-Bobby, how's it going?
-Good. You?

899
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:47,903
Good.

900
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:52,614
What's happening?
I thought you took early retirement.

901
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:55,236
What can you do?
I'll do another year or two.

902
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:59,294
Hope the phlebitis don't get too bad.
See how I feel. Marv?

903
01:08:00,122 --> 01:08:01,792
I'm heading out to work.

904
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:04,294
-Good day, dot.
-You, too!

905
01:08:04,626 --> 01:08:06,456
Are you going to eat something?

906
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:08,093
Yeah.

907
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,300
Okay.

908
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:19,968
Biggest day in the world tomorrow,
I can't get you on the phone.

909
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:23,437
Yeah. I forgot to tell you, I don't feel good...

910
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:25,308
...so I'm not coming in.

911
01:08:25,981 --> 01:08:28,651
Call the bartemps.

912
01:08:28,984 --> 01:08:30,324
I did already.

913
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:34,159
Super bowl. We always use them.

914
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:38,661
-So what do you need me for?
-I don't.

915
01:08:40,996 --> 01:08:42,156
But...

916
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:47,843
...you're blowing off
the biggest tip day of the year.

917
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:51,168
What, I work for tips now?

918
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:53,167
You ever go to the front of the bar...

919
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:56,797
...and look at the sign on the bar?
Whose name is on it?

920
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:59,600
That's my name.

921
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:02,519
'Cause I used to own it once.

922
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:05,518
Yeah, you been playing that flute
a long time now.

923
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:10,192
And you've been awfully fresh since...

924
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:13,526
...you got that dog
that you mistake for a kid.

925
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:16,870
Marv, you can't redo it.

926
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:20,536
All right? They pressed, you blinked.

927
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:22,869
It's done. It's over.

928
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:26,542
It's been over for a while now.

929
01:09:30,712 --> 01:09:35,222
Well, I'm not the guy who wasted
his entire life waiting for it to start.

930
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:36,974
I did that?

931
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:40,716
At least I had something once.

932
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:44,390
I was respected. I was feared.

933
01:09:44,893 --> 01:09:49,903
When I walked into a place, people sat up.
They sat up straight. They noticed.

934
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:51,902
What'd you ever have?

935
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:55,244
And the fucking bar stool
you put that old biddy at.

936
01:09:55,571 --> 01:09:59,411
You don't think I don't know
that you did it on purpose?

937
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:04,751
That was my stool and nobody sat on that
stool because it was cousin Marv's stool.

938
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,080
And that meant something.

939
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,583
That meant something!

940
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:11,749
But it didn't.

941
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:14,762
Ever.

942
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:20,757
It was just a stool.

943
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:29,442
Are you doing something desperate?

944
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,363
Again?

945
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:35,109
Marv?

946
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:41,448
Are you doing something
that maybe we can't clean up this time?

947
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:44,955
I told you, I don't feel good.

948
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:48,874
So why don't you get the fuck out of here?

949
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:51,632
Really.

950
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:54,635
Good-bye, Marv.

951
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,300
I hope you feel better soon.

952
01:11:02,804 --> 01:11:04,814
Don't forget to eat something.

953
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:32,252
The body of Christ.

954
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:35,339
The body of Christ.

955
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:38,665
The body of Christ.

956
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:41,682
The body of Christ.

957
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:45,432
The body of Christ.

958
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:06,697
Should we go?

959
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:08,702
Let's move out.

960
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:20,216
Rocco, I'll have to lock you down in a sec.

961
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:22,379
We have a long day.

962
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:06,927
Hey, didi, how you doing?

963
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:10,102
I got to...I got to talk to you.

964
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:12,429
I want to take you someplace tonight.

965
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:15,271
It's a lot of fun.

966
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:17,768
Then we're out of here.

967
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:16,253
Hi. How you doing?

968
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:18,422
What do you want?

969
01:14:20,085 --> 01:14:21,915
I don't want you here. Please leave.

970
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:24,841
No, listen to me.
Sit down and listen to me, okay?

971
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:27,877
I want you to go. This is my home.

972
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:31,676
I'm not your girl anymore.
I want you to leave.

973
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,600
Come on, take a seat. Come on.

974
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:39,773
Don't play that shit. Sit down.

975
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:47,858
You look good, by the way.

976
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:52,120
We're going somewhere tonight.
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

977
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:54,701
And after that, we're out of here.

978
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:58,287
I want you to go. Please.

979
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:03,287
You're going to go.

980
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:06,299
And make yourself pretty, all right?

981
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,073
Good to see you, man.

982
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,030
-Where you been?
-I came back to see you, Jimmy.

983
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:31,873
He said, I'm coming right back for you.

984
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:56,059
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise and remove your hats...

985
01:15:56,098 --> 01:16:00,438
...as we honor America with
the singing of our national anthem.

986
01:16:00,727 --> 01:16:04,607
Two dos equis, three amstel, two shots
of Jack and a Dewar's on the rocks.

987
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:07,068
-You hear that, rardy?
-Coming up.

988
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:12,798
Hey, Bob?

989
01:17:13,675 --> 01:17:14,755
Bob?

990
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:15,801
Bob!

991
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:18,473
Can I get two more Heineken on 1-3?

992
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:20,345
Rardy? Two more Heineken.

993
01:17:58,345 --> 01:18:00,175
-White wine, right?
-Yeah.

994
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:12,355
Can you get me a stoli rocks
and a house chard for the lady?

995
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:17,242
I didn't see you this morning.

996
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:19,201
Yeah, so what?

997
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:22,204
So you don't want the money?

998
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:25,210
-You bring it?
-What?

999
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:26,707
Did you bring the money?

1000
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,093
You strike me as
the type who would bring it.

1001
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:32,377
-Two Stella and an amstel.
-Sure.

1002
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:34,881
Rardy, two amstels and a Stella.

1003
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:36,423
Why is she here?

1004
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:38,894
She's my girl.

1005
01:18:50,606 --> 01:18:53,726
Give me that piece of paper
and you get the money.

1006
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:55,067
What paper?

1007
01:18:56,570 --> 01:19:00,070
The microchip and the license,
like we agreed.

1008
01:19:00,115 --> 01:19:01,445
Why would I do that?

1009
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:06,042
Because that's why I'm paying you
the money. That's the deal.

1010
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:09,041
That's a deal. Hold on a second.

1011
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:12,538
You can keep the change. Keep the change.

1012
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:14,304
Two stellas and one amstel.

1013
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:16,376
What's up? Wait a minute.

1014
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:19,716
I can't talk right now. Wait a second.

1015
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:21,392
Here you go.

1016
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:23,557
What's that noise? Where are you?

1017
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:26,385
I'm at the place. Your place.

1018
01:19:26,725 --> 01:19:28,055
The bar?

1019
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:30,810
Why the fuck you show up so early?

1020
01:19:31,063 --> 01:19:34,653
This was simple. You show up at the
designated time, do the thing and leave.

1021
01:19:36,068 --> 01:19:38,818
I know what he seems like,
but I shit you not, do not fuck with him.

1022
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:42,661
Stay away from him. He already thinks
you want to kill him over some fucking dog.

1023
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:44,331
Just stay in the back.

1024
01:19:44,576 --> 01:19:45,906
Yeah, I got it.

1025
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:50,751
And you're in a bar. Don't drink too much.
I'll see you at 2:00, you fucking idiot.

1026
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:58,915
What an amazing game!

1027
01:19:59,258 --> 01:20:02,258
Twenty-seven to 23, your final score!

1028
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:24,121
-Are you with him?
-No.

1029
01:20:24,157 --> 01:20:25,487
So why are you here?

1030
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:30,286
-What were you talking about?
-I told you, nothing.

1031
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:31,539
Bob.

1032
01:20:32,457 --> 01:20:33,877
Yeah, we do.

1033
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:35,847
This is not good. This is so not good.

1034
01:21:37,523 --> 01:21:39,363
I don't want to be here.

1035
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:41,361
I didn't want to come here.

1036
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:45,033
He was waiting in my house
when I got home.

1037
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:51,044
I'm sorry, Bob.

1038
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:57,794
He has a gun.

1039
01:22:09,888 --> 01:22:12,058
I'm going to the ladies'.

1040
01:22:18,564 --> 01:22:20,574
What were you talking about?

1041
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:21,937
Football.

1042
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:26,910
Give me another shot, will you?

1043
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:43,961
What was the name of your partner?

1044
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:48,303
Wouldn't be much of a threat
if you knew who he was, would he, Bob?

1045
01:22:48,594 --> 01:22:49,934
Yeah, but...

1046
01:22:50,429 --> 01:22:53,099
...he helped you kill Richie whelan, right?

1047
01:22:54,933 --> 01:22:56,313
That's the rumor, Bob.

1048
01:22:56,602 --> 01:22:58,772
More than a rumor. It's what you said.

1049
01:22:58,812 --> 01:23:02,322
Then it's more than a rumor, Bob.
What time is it?

1050
01:23:03,275 --> 01:23:07,785
You know, you don't have to
keep calling me Bob all the time.

1051
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:10,163
I'll see what I can do, Bob. What is that?

1052
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:12,279
The 10 grand you wanted.

1053
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:14,294
This is 10 grand?

1054
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,290
Yeah.

1055
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:21,135
You know what I think?

1056
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:26,670
I'm going to look in the safe at 2:00.

1057
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:33,965
Time lock goes off at 2:00 A.M.
you got 90 seconds to close it...

1058
01:23:34,014 --> 01:23:36,474
...or it triggers two silent alarms.

1059
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:39,017
We should look in the safe at 2:00.

1060
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:42,646
Now you listen.

1061
01:23:43,815 --> 01:23:47,315
I'm happy to pay you 10 grand for the dog.

1062
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:51,487
Yeah. Ten grand for the dog.

1063
01:23:52,157 --> 01:23:53,487
But that's it.

1064
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:57,501
And how much for her?

1065
01:23:57,829 --> 01:24:02,329
How about that?
How much should he pay for you?

1066
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:05,838
Eric, please. Please don't do this.

1067
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:11,338
-Where's Marv?
-Marv?

1068
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:14,049
You need him for something?

1069
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:15,895
I don't want anything.

1070
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:19,521
I just don't want him
creeping up my back all of a sudden.

1071
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:22,692
Yeah, my sweet cousin Marv.

1072
01:24:24,022 --> 01:24:27,362
You know he's had some trouble,
Marv. Yeah.

1073
01:24:27,693 --> 01:24:31,033
Like, about 10 years ago, man, he had...

1074
01:24:31,363 --> 01:24:32,703
...a problem with the cards.

1075
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:35,204
I didn't know that, Bob.

1076
01:24:35,242 --> 01:24:37,542
But he was more of a loan shark back then.

1077
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:40,707
And I remember this kid...

1078
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:43,711
...he was into him for a shitload of money.

1079
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:47,250
Hopeless case when it came to
the dogs and b-ball.

1080
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:52,221
Just degenerate, really. Kind of kid who'd
never be able to pay back what he owed.

1081
01:24:52,259 --> 01:24:53,889
It's 1:57, all right?

1082
01:24:53,927 --> 01:24:56,387
And then the kid goes to a.C. And he...

1083
01:24:56,722 --> 01:25:01,392
...hits up a slot machine for 22 grand.

1084
01:25:02,227 --> 01:25:03,397
Bam.

1085
01:25:03,937 --> 01:25:08,267
Who'd have thunk it? It was, like,
a fraction more than what he owed Marv.

1086
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:10,737
So he didn't pay up
and you roughed him up.

1087
01:25:10,777 --> 01:25:14,947
No, no. That's not what happened.
He paid back Marv, every cent.

1088
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,910
He was a good guy.

1089
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:18,910
It's 1:58, all right?

1090
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:22,912
What he didn't account for
was Marv skimming off his own stash.

1091
01:25:22,956 --> 01:25:25,626
Because of his habits
and his gambling debts.

1092
01:25:25,918 --> 01:25:29,798
And this kid coming out of the blue
with 22 grand was a...

1093
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:31,418
...what'd he say?

1094
01:25:32,424 --> 01:25:35,264
"A viable business opportunity."

1095
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:37,601
That's my cousin Marv.

1096
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:42,770
So long as nobody knew
that he'd paid Marv back off, you know?

1097
01:25:43,602 --> 01:25:44,942
You see where this is going?

1098
01:25:45,604 --> 01:25:47,274
Yeah, kid had to be ripped off.

1099
01:25:47,314 --> 01:25:49,774
No. Kid had to be killed.

1100
01:25:51,318 --> 01:25:53,818
So nobody'd know he'd paid Marv back off.

1101
01:25:54,821 --> 01:25:56,491
So that's what we did.

1102
01:25:57,282 --> 01:25:59,122
So you...

1103
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:01,663
-...killed him.
-Yeah, I did.

1104
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:03,997
I shot him in the face, twice.

1105
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:08,133
Then I wrapped his head in a towel
and stabbed him in the heart...

1106
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:11,628
...so he would bleed out, put him
in my bathtub and watched him drain.

1107
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:13,974
Then I put him in an oil tank...

1108
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,470
...with laundry detergent and lye...

1109
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:18,851
...and sealed it back up.

1110
01:26:23,308 --> 01:26:25,308
Want to know what his name was?

1111
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:27,484
It's 2:00, Bob. It's 2:00.

1112
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,810
His name.

1113
01:26:31,483 --> 01:26:34,493
-I would not know, Bob.
-Yes, you do. This is something you know.

1114
01:26:34,528 --> 01:26:36,198
-I wouldn't know that, Bob.
-Guess.

1115
01:26:37,155 --> 01:26:39,985
I know it's 2:00,
and you got to open the safe!

1116
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:41,033
Listen to me.

1117
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:42,656
His name...

1118
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:44,831
...was Richie whelan.

1119
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:49,536
Everybody called him glory days?

1120
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:53,376
I killed Richie whelan, okay?

1121
01:26:53,964 --> 01:26:55,304
Sure you did.

1122
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:26,867
Fucking punk.

1123
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:32,790
Go out to dinner dressed like you're still
in your living room. You wear those...

1124
01:27:33,045 --> 01:27:34,885
...big hippity-hoppity clown shoes.

1125
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:38,130
You speak to women terribly.
You treat them despicably.

1126
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:42,143
You hurt harmless dogs that can't defend
themselves. I'm tired of you, man.

1127
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:44,467
I'm tired of you. You embarrass me.

1128
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:48,558
You know,
he would have kept coming back.

1129
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:52,150
People like this, you let them
take something from you...

1130
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:55,067
...and they keep coming back.

1131
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:58,487
You still owe them
and they never, never change.

1132
01:27:58,737 --> 01:28:00,737
You can never change their mind.

1133
01:28:06,828 --> 01:28:08,158
You just...

1134
01:28:09,248 --> 01:28:12,578
I mean, you just fucking shot him.

1135
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:17,418
Yes, I did. Absolutely.
He was going to hurt our dog.

1136
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:35,857
Bob?

1137
01:28:36,108 --> 01:28:39,108
Can I...Can I go now?

1138
01:28:40,445 --> 01:28:42,605
Yeah, of course. You can.

1139
01:28:45,117 --> 01:28:47,617
So you...You'll let me go?

1140
01:28:49,121 --> 01:28:50,791
Sure, sure.

1141
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:52,620
Why not?

1142
01:28:53,292 --> 01:28:58,302
And, and nobody will ever
hurt you again. Okay?

1143
01:28:58,797 --> 01:29:01,467
This is done. Okay?

1144
01:29:02,801 --> 01:29:04,471
You got your stuff?

1145
01:29:05,804 --> 01:29:07,144
Go on now.

1146
01:29:11,143 --> 01:29:15,313
But now...Now you'll think I'll talk.

1147
01:29:15,898 --> 01:29:17,228
I won't talk, Bob.

1148
01:29:17,816 --> 01:29:19,226
I know you won't.

1149
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:21,654
I promise. I won't.

1150
01:29:21,987 --> 01:29:25,817
Nadia, you can't. Not with these people.
They won't--

1151
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:28,165
your people, Bob.

1152
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:31,584
No, they're not my-- I'm not them.

1153
01:29:32,497 --> 01:29:34,167
And I'm not this.

1154
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:10,817
You've seen better days, huh?

1155
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:18,200
Andre?

1156
01:32:28,048 --> 01:32:29,378
He just came in.

1157
01:32:29,675 --> 01:32:32,555
Yeah, that's right.
When I opened up the door.

1158
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:35,386
I was just letting Millie out, and...

1159
01:32:35,722 --> 01:32:39,892
Put a gun in your face,
but you said, "not tonight," huh?

1160
01:32:40,227 --> 01:32:41,897
I didn't say anything.

1161
01:32:42,396 --> 01:32:44,186
You ever see him before?

1162
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:45,231
Yeah.

1163
01:32:46,525 --> 01:32:48,195
Yeah, he was in here.

1164
01:32:48,569 --> 01:32:51,239
Over there, watching the game.

1165
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:55,029
Caught my attention
'cause he was on his own.

1166
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,750
Maybe he wasn't.

1167
01:32:59,246 --> 01:33:01,406
-No, he was, though.
-Or maybe he wasn't.

1168
01:33:01,707 --> 01:33:02,957
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.

1169
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,380
Sure you do.
You say he was on his own, alone.

1170
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:08,420
I say he wasn't. What's to follow?

1171
01:33:10,215 --> 01:33:11,215
You.

1172
01:33:12,092 --> 01:33:13,552
You're alone.

1173
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:16,931
Sometimes it's good to be alone.

1174
01:33:18,056 --> 01:33:19,386
Say it.

1175
01:33:21,393 --> 01:33:22,733
Say it.

1176
01:33:24,938 --> 01:33:26,438
I'm alone.

1177
01:33:28,066 --> 01:33:30,936
No way, my man. You have friends.

1178
01:33:31,945 --> 01:33:34,945
Speaking of friends, your cousin Marv?

1179
01:33:35,282 --> 01:33:39,082
He told me he's retiring.
He want you to be the boss of the bar.

1180
01:33:40,287 --> 01:33:42,457
I said, "of course, it's your bar."

1181
01:33:43,457 --> 01:33:45,127
"But it's not your money."

1182
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:47,959
"So why you always trying
to take my money?"

1183
01:33:48,295 --> 01:33:49,965
So I made him a deal.

1184
01:33:50,297 --> 01:33:53,967
"You and your druggy friends
leave my money alone...

1185
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:58,469
...and I'll pay you a ticket
to a nice, quiet place."

1186
01:34:02,309 --> 01:34:03,599
So what do you think?

1187
01:34:04,978 --> 01:34:08,478
Take down his name, put up yours.
"Bob's bar."

1188
01:34:09,316 --> 01:34:11,986
Has a nice ring to it, huh? "Bob's bar."

1189
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:15,033
"Bob's big bad bar."

1190
01:34:15,364 --> 01:34:17,534
I'm kidding, my friend. Lighten up.

1191
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,870
Sure.

1192
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:29,380
-Did he fit?
-Yeah. Had to break his legs, but he fit fine.

1193
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:32,881
Smile. Don't mind,
everything's gonna be okay.

1194
01:34:33,966 --> 01:34:35,626
Get some rest.

1195
01:34:45,561 --> 01:34:46,731
Good night.

1196
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:48,899
Good night.

1197
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:09,581
There are some sins you commit
that you can't come back from...

1198
01:35:09,835 --> 01:35:11,845
...no matter how hard you try.

1199
01:35:12,087 --> 01:35:17,087
You just can't, you know? It's like
the devil is waiting for your body to quit.

1200
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:22,264
Because he knows...He knows that...

1201
01:35:23,765 --> 01:35:25,925
...he already owns your soul.

1202
01:35:26,185 --> 01:35:30,195
And then I think, maybe,
you know, there is no devil.

1203
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:33,942
You die, and God, he says:

1204
01:35:34,776 --> 01:35:36,106
"Nah."

1205
01:35:37,946 --> 01:35:39,946
"Nah, you can't come in."

1206
01:35:40,282 --> 01:35:42,452
"You have to leave now."

1207
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:47,118
"You have to leave and go away
and you have to be alone."

1208
01:35:49,374 --> 01:35:51,544
"You have to be alone forever."

1209
01:36:25,994 --> 01:36:28,664
I'm sorry to hear about cousin Marv.

1210
01:36:30,082 --> 01:36:32,922
It was a carjacking gone bad
is what they said.

1211
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:34,998
Carjacking? Right.

1212
01:36:35,504 --> 01:36:38,344
That was an execution.

1213
01:36:39,007 --> 01:36:40,217
A block and a half from this bar.

1214
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:45,011
Anyway, it fucking sucks
and I'm really sorry.

1215
01:36:45,848 --> 01:36:47,178
Thank you.

1216
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:50,597
Are you going to
the church closing tomorrow?

1217
01:36:50,853 --> 01:36:52,023
Yeah, of course.

1218
01:36:52,271 --> 01:36:54,271
I don't know yet. I got a shift.

1219
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,280
They sold it. To milligan development.
What'd I tell you?

1220
01:36:59,528 --> 01:37:01,858
Condos with stained glass windows.

1221
01:37:06,702 --> 01:37:07,702
Eric deeds.

1222
01:37:08,036 --> 01:37:09,866
I mentioned him to you once.

1223
01:37:10,706 --> 01:37:11,786
Yeah, I remember.

1224
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:15,461
-You didn't then.
-I remember you mentioning him.

1225
01:37:15,711 --> 01:37:19,051
He was in this bar super bowl Sunday.
You see him?

1226
01:37:19,298 --> 01:37:23,468
No. There was a lot of people in here
on super bowl Sunday, so...

1227
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:25,549
Yeah, that's true.

1228
01:37:26,138 --> 01:37:30,138
It's just this was the last place
he was ever seen and then...

1229
01:37:30,559 --> 01:37:32,139
Just like Richie whelan.

1230
01:37:33,729 --> 01:37:37,399
Ironic, 'cause deeds
supposedly killed whelan.

1231
01:37:37,733 --> 01:37:42,073
Bodies getting clipped or vanishing
all over the place, but...

1232
01:37:42,571 --> 01:37:45,241
...come on, man, you don't see anything?

1233
01:37:45,741 --> 01:37:49,241
Nah. You know,
that's this neighborhood, right?

1234
01:37:50,412 --> 01:37:52,082
But he could turn up.

1235
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:54,501
People do all the time.

1236
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:58,250
That's true. If he does,
it'll probably be in a psych ward.

1237
01:37:59,254 --> 01:38:02,344
Which is where he was
the night whelan disappeared.

1238
01:38:03,592 --> 01:38:06,262
I'm not lying. It's true.

1239
01:38:06,678 --> 01:38:10,848
Deeds always took credit for the whelan hit
'cause nobody else wanted to.

1240
01:38:11,099 --> 01:38:13,349
He thought it would help his street cred...

1241
01:38:13,602 --> 01:38:15,602
...but he didn't kill whelan.

1242
01:38:15,938 --> 01:38:17,268
He didn't?

1243
01:38:26,114 --> 01:38:27,284
Yeah.

1244
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:39,631
No one ever sees you coming,
do they, Bob?

1245
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,680
Rocco. Something we got to do.

1246
01:39:54,369 --> 01:39:57,709
When you left the bar,
I know that meant stay away.

1247
01:39:58,373 --> 01:40:02,383
I know that meant stay away,
but you didn't say it.

1248
01:40:05,714 --> 01:40:08,724
So if you say it, then...

1249
01:40:09,051 --> 01:40:13,051
...I will just go. Believe me, Nadia,
I will leave right now.

1250
01:40:14,223 --> 01:40:15,893
But you have to say it.

1251
01:40:31,907 --> 01:40:33,407
Let me go get my jacket.

1252
01:40:34,243 --> 01:40:35,413
Yeah?

1253
01:40:36,578 --> 01:40:38,578
Sure, great. Great.
