1
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,567
- Jason?

2
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,533
- I saw it, I saw it.

3
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,967
- You're okay.

4
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,267
- It was so clear.

5
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,033
I know everything now!

6
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,467
I know everything.

7
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,500
- Do you have to go today?

8
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,867
- We play every Wednesday, Eve.

9
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:59,133
- Did you pay the
gas bill yesterday?

10
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,067
- I thought you put
that in the mail.

11
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,100
- I said I'd wait to see how
much money you brought home.

12
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,433
- Well, I don't have any
patients again today.

13
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,733
I will put it in
the mail at lunch.

14
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:53,433
Do you have any
severance money left?

15
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,333
- Yeah.

16
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:57,633
Couple hundred.

17
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,933
I was thinking of saving
it for Skye's crib.

18
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:09,600
- Good thinking, sweetie.

19
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,233
'Cause Logan's gonna
need a good crib.

20
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,200
- Are you sure you can't stay?

21
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,600
- I'm already late, babe.

22
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:28,867
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

23
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:06,633
You ready?

24
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,433
Ready? You ready?

25
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,400
- Ah!

26
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,467
You got lucky on that one.

27
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,867
Having some
good luck today, man.

28
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,567
- Well, I would too
if I kept faking out

29
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,300
a half blind guy
on his bad side.

30
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,867
- What, you're really gonna
play the cripple card?

31
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:19,867
- I'm just saying, you
wouldn't be half as good

32
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,433
if I was twice as sighted.

33
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:23,867
- Ah fuck, all right,
man, all right.

34
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,500
No more fakes for
the rest of the day.

35
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,467
Game point.

36
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,267
- You see me?

37
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,400
- Oh.
- You see me?

38
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,300
Oh, you
think that's funny?

39
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,100
Here, see this.

40
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,700
- Oh, yeah, I saw that!

41
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,000
Woo hoo!

42
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,167
Oh, what's up now?

43
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,333
See, that's game.

44
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,133
- Get out.

45
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:40,900
- That's game, buddy.

46
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,867
So uh, how's Evie?

47
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:47,600
- She's good, man, she's good.

48
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
- Yeah?

49
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,400
Yeah?

50
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,600
She's good.

51
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,167
- That uh, that didn't
sound convincing.

52
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:56,733
- Well she's pregnant, man.

53
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:58,633
How would you be?

54
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,567
- Luckily I'll never
have to deal with that.

55
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,433
- I don't know, man.

56
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,567
It's been a little hard for
her since she stopped working.

57
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,333
It doesn't really help that
I'm not bringing in much.

58
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,333
Might take a loan out
from her dad, last week.

59
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:21,067
- Ah.

60
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,700
I didn't uh,

61
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,900
I didn't know you were
hurting that much.

62
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:28,867
- Neither did I.

63
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,600
This is it.

64
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,467
- One more.

65
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,533
Ah, there you go.

66
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:37,500
Finally.

67
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,900
- But listen, if you need
some money, let me know.

68
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,333
- No, no, no, we're good.

69
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,800
I'll be fine.

70
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,967
- You sure?
- Business oughtta

71
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,467
pick up soon, I just
had my brochure,

72
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,333
sent it on Monday, so I oughtta
see some business from that.

73
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,700
And the weather oughtta
get shittier soon, so--

74
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
- Oh, there you go.
- Yeah.

75
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,000
Doctor Jason
Pyatt, suicide preventer.

76
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,400
Well uh, all right, you know.

77
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:00,133
Let me know.

78
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,100
- Thanks.

79
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,067
I will.

80
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,433
- I know you got a lot of
competition in this town.

81
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,667
- Yeah, but they're all 80.

82
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,467
I figure I got another
year of struggling,

83
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,233
then they'll all croak
and gimme their business.

84
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,333
But how 'bout you,
man, how's class?

85
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,667
- You know, uh.

86
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:15,933
It's uh...

87
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,133
Ugh, sometimes I feel
like I'm teaching

88
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,167
the future stars of
America's Most Wanted.

89
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,867
I mean, you got the
gangsters on one side,

90
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,133
the nerdy white
kids on the other,

91
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,733
and the Asian mafia
sprinkled everywhere.

92
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:27,633
- Shit, man.

93
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,533
Shouldn't you be carrying?

94
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:30,967
- Oh, I do.

95
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,100
- You serious?

96
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:35,633
- Hell yeah, I'm serious.

97
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:36,733
I carry every day.

98
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,233
- No, man, I guess,

99
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,567
I guess I would too
under the circumstances.

100
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,100
- Hey man, I already
lost this eye,

101
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,400
I'm gonna do what I can
to save the other one.

102
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,433
- Yeah.

103
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,700
- No, they're really
smart kids, though.

104
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,133
They seem pretty
involved so far.

105
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,233
- It's a cool class.

106
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,600
- Hey, they relate
to it, you know?

107
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,867
I'm teaching a
group that's made up

108
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:00,000
of 70% delinquents about
social issues and violence,

109
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,533
they have a lot to say.

110
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,467
- Yeah.

111
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:03,900
Hey, we still on for after work?

112
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,433
- I believe it's the only
thing on your schedule.

113
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,300
- Oh, oh, touche huh?

114
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,200
- I mean if you're sure
that's all right with Evie.

115
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,333
If she doesn't wanna come--

116
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,167
- Nah, she's fine, she's fine.

117
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,333
I'll see you at 6:30.

118
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:18,433
- Sounds good.

119
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,333
- All right.

120
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,333
I'll see you later, teach.

121
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,667
- I'll see you then.

122
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:22,667
- Bye.
- You keep that lisping

123
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:23,900
to a minimum, all right?

124
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,667
All right,
all right, all right.

125
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:55,233
Hello.

126
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,067
Thank you for calling
Jason Pyatt's office.

127
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,567
Hello, thank you
for calling Do...

128
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:29,167
What's up, this is Jase.

129
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,867
I'm really busy, holla back.

130
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,900
- Doctor Pyatt?

131
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,533
- Yeah, can I help you?

132
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,067
- You can.

133
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:36,367
- Mister Darnell.

134
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,133
Sorry I didn't
realize it was you.

135
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:40,433
- That's all right,
Doctor Pyatt.

136
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:42,933
How is everything?

137
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,567
- Uh...

138
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,700
Yeah, things could be better.

139
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:49,500
- Work is slow?

140
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,600
- Yeah, all week.

141
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,400
- Yeah.

142
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,867
- How have you been?

143
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:53,500
What can I help you with?

144
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,100
- Well,

145
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:57,500
I just wanted to
see a familiar face.

146
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:00,267
Talk to someone I could trust.

147
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:02,867
Speaking of which.

148
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:03,700
Mmhmm?

149
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:05,367
- I uh,

150
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,100
found this on a news stand.

151
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,200
Good picture.

152
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:11,933
Yeah.

153
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:13,933
But, I just don't know

154
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:15,700
if I can trust someone
who uses balloon font.

155
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,900
Especially like--

156
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,100
- Mmhmm, tell me, please.

157
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,267
- "Dedicated to you happiness."

158
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:26,433
Dedicated
to "your" happ--

159
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:27,933
- No, "you" happiness.

160
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:29,867
- That's brilliant.

161
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,467
Well, it got your
attention, didn't it?

162
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,867
- Yes sir, you're right.

163
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,900
Effective, very effective.

164
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,900
Do you have some time
for a very tired old man?

165
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,967
Yeah, of
course, come on in.

166
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:43,900
You want a Red Hot?

167
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:45,333
- No.

168
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,567
Thank you.

169
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:47,567
You got
the first hour free.

170
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:48,533
Ooh.

171
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,467
- Can I offer you anything?

172
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,633
- No, I'm all right, thank you.

173
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:15,133
- Well, make
yourself comfortable.

174
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,300
- I'd like to sit
here if that's okay.

175
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,300
- Yeah, absolutely.

176
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,767
I'm glad you came in today.

177
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,867
Didn't have anybody else
on the books, and uh...

178
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,000
Ooh, it's nice to
see a familiar face.

179
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:40,100
Mind if I record this session?

180
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,200
That's fine.

181
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,133
Thank you.

182
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:45,567
So when was our last session?

183
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,533
- It was June, I believe.

184
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:48,733
That long?

185
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,233
- Yeah.

186
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,867
- Mr. Darnell, I gotta tell
you, you're my best customer.

187
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:53,933
- Well then I'm
sorry to tell you

188
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:55,367
that I'll be leaving
town for awhile,

189
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:58,100
I just came by to talk to a
good friend one more time.

190
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:00,100
- Well, today is yours, sir.

191
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,333
Good, good.

192
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,267
- So.

193
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,867
What do you wanna talk about?

194
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,567
- Well I'll tell you, it's
a very important day for me.

195
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,867
I suppose at my age,
every day's important.

196
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,033
Sure.

197
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,367
- You know, there's a
lot of questions in life

198
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,867
that you can't answer until
you've lived as long as I have.

199
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:19,667
- Well, that's why we're here.

200
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,133
- Yeah.

201
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,867
I'd like you
to consider me a friend.

202
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,267
- Oh, I do, I do.

203
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,633
You know, I really appreciate
all the talks we've had.

204
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,733
You know, your patience
in our conversations.

205
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,233
I know I've been a
bit coy about my past.

206
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,367
Really my life.

207
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,433
- I wouldn't judge you.

208
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:41,633
You can count on that.

209
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:46,633
- By my age, you cherish trust.

210
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,933
It's harder to find someone
who'll really listen.

211
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:50,967
- Well certainly Mr. Darnell,

212
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,433
you have more than just me?

213
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
- A young man like you,

214
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,400
you know, he knows
what he wants in life.

215
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,867
Dreams, goals, places
he'd like to go,

216
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:04,300
things he'd like to see.

217
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:08,000
But you never really believe
it until it actually happens.

218
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,733
Dreams fade with age,
and they're replaced

219
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:14,600
with the harsh reality of
what life brings to the table.

220
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:16,633
I waited for that time.

221
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,867
I had a wife,
responsibilities, a career.

222
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,167
But my imagination
got the better of me.

223
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:29,867
- So, you had a difficult time
with life's little demands?

224
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,000
- No, no, there's supposed
to be something more,

225
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,433
something I hadn't
seen, but had to see.

226
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:38,333
But my life as I knew it would
never allow me to see it.

227
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,200
- Did you ever find that?

228
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:44,533
- I...

229
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:46,400
- Take your time.

230
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:53,600
- Have you ever looked up
at the stars and wondered?

231
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,300
- Yeah, yeah.

232
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:57,600
Always.

233
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,867
- I wondered, too.

234
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,967
I was fascinated
by the universe.

235
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,233
Space, time.

236
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:05,900
Are we alone, what happens next?

237
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:10,233
I wondered so much, I felt
like nobody saw what I did.

238
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:14,400
- Like you're a man in the
world, beneath the world.

239
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,233
- Yes.

240
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:16,867
Exactly.

241
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:18,733
- Of course, I...

242
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:21,300
I've felt like that often.

243
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,300
But it's all in
the manner I feel.

244
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,733
Perception is a powerful thing.

245
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,000
You've traveled a
lot in your life.

246
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,633
- Oh yeah.

247
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,000
- When I was in school
I had the opportunity

248
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,133
to visit the Louvre.

249
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,433
I wasn't really
into art galleries,

250
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,300
not until I saw
this one painting.

251
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,700
Most people wouldn't
give it a second glance,

252
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,267
it's not as vast or as
detailed as many other,

253
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:48,100
you know, paintings
in that gallery.

254
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,333
My friends dismissed it
immediately, but I didn't.

255
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,867
- What's its name?

256
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:54,633
- The painting?

257
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:55,867
Yeah.

258
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,700
- It's called Nude Youth
Sitting By The Sea.

259
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,467
I'll never forget it.

260
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:04,933
- I remember it.

261
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,100
- You've seen it?

262
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,533
- The Penitent Man.

263
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,933
- It's all perception.

264
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,167
Exactly.

265
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,033
- My friend saw a man
sitting on a cliff.

266
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,600
But I saw something
so much more.

267
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,533
His tortured soul.

268
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:23,533
- Why do you think he
sits there like that,

269
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:24,700
with his head buried?

270
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,033
- I, you know...

271
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,200
I always felt he was
suffocated, stuck in a way.

272
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,433
Like he wanted to look forward,

273
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:38,033
wanted to see the
future, but he couldn't.

274
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,333
He couldn't know
what was coming.

275
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:43,367
- Why do you feel
suffocated, Dr. Pyatt?

276
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
- Isn't this your session?

277
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
- Forgive me.

278
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,933
- No, no, no, no, don't
worry, don't worry.

279
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:53,067
Maybe you're right.

280
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,867
- What if the boy
by the sea is not

281
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,233
angry at the at the road ahead?

282
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:04,300
What if it's the road that came?

283
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,333
- I'm not sure I follow.

284
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:12,500
- What if he's haunted by
things he cannot change?

285
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,100
- Does something haunt you?

286
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,767
- Something haunts all of us.

287
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,967
- Let's go back to what
you were saying earlier.

288
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,867
You said there was
something missing,

289
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,900
something you couldn't
see but wanted to see.

290
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,367
Let's go back to that.

291
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:32,467
- I don't think it's something
many people could accept.

292
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:34,867
- Well, it's my
job to understand.

293
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,867
- Yes, I know it is.

294
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,900
And I'm sure you'll
do your best.

295
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,433
But you'll think I'm crazy.

296
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,100
I never intended
to follow science

297
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,000
into anything more than a hobby.

298
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,533
But I was curious.

299
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,467
Why things happen
the way they do,

300
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:00,233
those questions that
no one can answer.

301
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,767
But one day I understood.

302
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:09,000
It was as if all the
forces in the universe

303
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
had come together in that
one moment in space and time,

304
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,767
to deliver an answer to me.

305
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:20,867
All those things we cannot
change but wish we could.

306
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,233
Something reached
out and spoke to me,

307
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:29,867
and I understood.

308
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:33,867
To all those that wished

309
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:35,633
they could see the
beginning of time.

310
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:40,100
To all those that've
dreamed of witnessing

311
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,633
the first man climb out
of the primordial slime.

312
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:47,433
Finally they could.

313
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:51,033
Since H.G. Wells it's been
one of the greatest mysteries

314
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:54,133
and fantasies in human
history, but not anymore.

315
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,167
I've been given the secret.

316
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:03,867
And it was so simple.

317
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:24,000
- I have a hypothetical for you.

318
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:26,433
- Shoot.

319
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,333
- What if somebody
came to you and said,

320
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,000
"Ovid, I can take you
back to the moment

321
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,433
"your classroom was hit, to
the moment you were injured."

322
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,633
What would you do?

323
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
- I'd call the cops.

324
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,300
I'm serious.

325
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,000
- What are we
talking about, here?

326
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,900
- Will you just humor me?

327
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,267
- I'd think he was crazy.

328
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:47,667
- But what if were possible?

329
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:48,600
I mean, wouldn't you
take that opportunity

330
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,867
to set things right?

331
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,167
- "Set things right"?

332
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,467
You mean save my eye?

333
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,767
Avoid the bomb somehow?

334
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,700
- Yeah.

335
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:00,033
- My life would be different.

336
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,067
You know when you were a
kid, you'd see that crazy guy

337
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,233
walking down the
street with one arm.

338
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:06,400
You point and you stare,

339
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,667
you whisper to your
friends about him.

340
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,267
Well when you become the
subject of those stares

341
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,867
it really turns the tables.

342
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,900
- So, hypothetically...

343
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,467
- Hypothetically
if I could go back

344
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:20,067
and save my eye somehow?

345
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:22,033
Sure, it'd make my life easier.

346
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:22,900
- Yeah.

347
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:24,867
- But I wouldn't do it.

348
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,267
I mean, changing what
happened would change my life

349
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:28,867
and everything
I've done with it.

350
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,567
I mean, teaching
overseas during the wars,

351
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:33,567
all those kids, who knows
where they would be.

352
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,433
- Okay, you're
right, you're right.

353
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,700
But who knows?

354
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,933
You coulda gone on to
do other great things.

355
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,600
- Let other men do
other great things.

356
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,467
I think I'm doing what
I'm supposed to be doing.

357
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:43,300
- Yeah, but I guess it'd
be impossible to know.

358
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,000
- All right, let
me put it to you.

359
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,767
What if your dad hadn't
died when you were a kid?

360
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,667
- Yeah, I don't know.

361
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:55,367
- Yeah, but don't you think...

362
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,300
His death defined who you are.

363
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,767
- Yeah, in many ways.

364
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,900
If you could go back
and save his life somehow

365
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,367
do you think you'd be
doing what you're doing?

366
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,533
- Well business as it
is, maybe I shouldn't be.

367
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:08,933
- Come on, man.

368
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:12,100
I'm just saying our
lives make us who we are.

369
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,433
And who knows if you'd be
doing what you're doing,

370
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:16,233
who knows if you'da
got a chance to?

371
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,133
- I guess if my dad was
still alive I could've always

372
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:21,900
become that secret agent
I always wanted to.

373
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,267
- All right, man, you
asked for my opinion,

374
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:25,633
I'm just giving it to you.

375
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:27,133
- Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

376
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:29,433
You're right.

377
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:31,600
Thanks, man.

378
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,867
How's that sandwich?

379
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,033
- Oh, it's awesome.

380
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:38,300
Your salad good?

381
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,567
- Nah, not really.

382
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:42,167
- See?

383
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,733
Everything happens for a reason.

384
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:48,933
So.

385
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,633
Just to clarify.

386
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,500
You're telling me
that you're from...

387
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:57,600
Yes.

388
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:01,200
And you
discovered some way to...

389
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:03,500
Yes.

390
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,967
- Well I'd be very
interested in hearing it.

391
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:07,100
- Oh, I'm sure you would.

392
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,567
My secret's worth a lot.

393
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:13,100
- Well, we are under doctor
patient confidentiality.

394
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,767
- I know.

395
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,267
- Nothing you can say
can leave these walls.

396
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,667
I encourage my patients
to be as open as possible.

397
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:21,867
- Assuming that you really
wanna keep your practice.

398
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:22,767
- Right.

399
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:23,533
- Do you?

400
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,133
- Excuse me?

401
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,700
- Do you wish to
keep your practice?

402
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,667
Do you enjoy what you do?

403
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:33,200
- Of course.

404
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,267
This is my life.

405
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:37,633
I try to help people, like you.

406
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,900
- Why do you feel the
need to help other people?

407
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:45,033
- I believe you walked
into my office today.

408
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:46,967
- Do you take the
time to help yourself?

409
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:48,867
- Are you trying to
put me on the couch?

410
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,033
- I'm sorry.

411
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,933
I meant no disrespect.

412
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:53,700
- No, no, no.

413
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
That's fine.

414
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,033
Let's get back to your story.

415
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,100
- Yeah, you're right.

416
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:04,100
- Can you describe how
the answer came to you?

417
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,500
- How is not as
important as why.

418
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,267
- Okay.

419
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:09,233
What motivated you?

420
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,333
- Surely there are
things in our lives

421
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,100
we wish could be changed.

422
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,533
When you get older, however,

423
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,933
you grow comfortable in
the way things turned out.

424
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,300
That was not the
case for me, Doctor.

425
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,500
- I see.

426
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,400
- Some of the worst
crimes against humanity

427
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,433
are done with the
best of intentions.

428
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:29,500
This was the greatest
find in history,

429
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,333
and it was bound to
revolutionize the
way people live,

430
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,600
the way they thought.

431
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,267
By sharing it, not only
did I think it would be

432
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:38,600
a great leap in science, but
would be enhancing the world

433
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,133
with pure,
unadulterated knowledge.

434
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,633
But knowledge is nothing
without understanding.

435
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,267
I made a few calls, the
reaction was immediate.

436
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,167
As you can imagine, it
was much like yours.

437
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:51,767
A swift nod and a
quick dismissal.

438
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,400
I was nobody.

439
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:56,567
I was not part of
the well established
scientific community.

440
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:59,033
I got the government to listen,
they brought me deep inside,

441
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:01,200
surrounding me with the
world's great scientists.

442
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,133
Not the ones you hear about.

443
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:07,033
They studied my work,
cross-examined my calculations.

444
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,133
It was real.

445
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,567
Before I even had a
chance to think about it,

446
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,267
the government was at my door

447
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:16,633
offering me the biggest
check I'd ever seen.

448
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:19,200
I was young, inexperienced.

449
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:21,467
The amount of
zeroes on that check

450
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,067
could've fixed a small country.

451
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:26,467
And they calmly slid it
across the table to me.

452
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,267
- So you took the money.

453
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:32,233
- It was one of those moments

454
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:34,400
when you're presented
with two roads.

455
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:39,067
If I'd known the
road that I chose,

456
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,733
would I have made
the same decision?

457
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,933
I would like to think no.

458
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,600
- So what happened after
you took the money?

459
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,000
- I spent some, bought
a new house, car.

460
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,533
Life was great.

461
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,967
I was, I was the most famous
scientist in the world.

462
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,100
And I never considered
myself a scientist.

463
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,100
It was newspapers and magazines,

464
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,500
and talk shows and
movie premieres, and...

465
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:06,333
Everyone knew my face.

466
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,867
But really quickly, in a
couple years it went public.

467
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:11,500
You cannot contain
human curiosity.

468
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,733
Everyone's always
looking for the next

469
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:16,400
great leap in technology,
and this was it.

470
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:18,600
Got a question?

471
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,967
Some time, we'll
give you the answer.

472
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:23,567
- Yeah, I do have a question.

473
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,033
So how does this thing work?

474
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,567
Anybody can just travel back?

475
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,133
- No, that's not
what I intended.

476
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:35,467
You can't just give anyone
the power to actually go back.

477
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:37,933
Think of the
ramifications of that.

478
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:42,333
What I envisioned was more
like a window in time.

479
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,533
- A window?

480
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:44,867
Like what, like a,
like a big screen

481
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,500
where you could
just see history?

482
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,967
- Overly simplified, yes.

483
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,733
Once it was released publicly,

484
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:51,467
people could see any
time they desired

485
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:54,567
without directly
affecting past events.

486
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,500
It was the only way
to keep it safe.

487
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,867
So we thought.

488
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:00,267
- So theoretically,
anybody could see anything.

489
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:02,767
- Think about it
as memory recall.

490
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,300
Every man's experiences, they
can revisit even vividly.

491
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,300
Now imagine events in time
as memories for the world

492
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,833
in a space time continuum.

493
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,167
I discovered a way
to harness that.

494
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,900
- Now you mentioned being able
to see the creation of man.

495
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,567
I mean, you'd have
seen humans assemble,

496
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,500
develop their gods and
destroy each other.

497
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,967
I mean, Jesus Christ.

498
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:23,433
- He was just a man.

499
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,333
Imagine the devastation
from a revelation like that.

500
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,467
95% of the world's population

501
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:33,433
believed in a God in some form.

502
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,500
The scientists and
the politicians and
eventually the public

503
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,733
were able to go back and see

504
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:42,067
the Christian son of
God as a mortal man.

505
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:43,467
It shook the foundations.

506
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,833
Even atheists began to
lose hope for the future.

507
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:51,300
Southern evangelists began
lashing out violently

508
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,400
at anybody who supported
the new discovery.

509
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,100
The world was more
divided than ever.

510
00:30:56,867 --> 00:31:00,533
The road to hell had been
paved with good intentions.

511
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:02,133
And it was just the beginning.

512
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,167
- Well what happened,
some kind of big war?

513
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:08,767
- Once the technology
was simplified,

514
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,567
the government went to a
few large corporations.

515
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:13,933
To develop it for
high-end consumer use.

516
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:17,100
They figured it was a great
way to build the world economy.

517
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,000
Like commercial missions
to the moon or Mars.

518
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:23,267
They figured they could
make a lot of money,

519
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:24,667
and they were right.

520
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,567
Only the most wealthy
could afford it, at first.

521
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:30,067
But with any new technology
price decreases with time.

522
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:32,900
People were going
back to the beginning.

523
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,933
They were peering into new
dimensions of space and time,

524
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:38,333
looking for positive
proof of evolution.

525
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,867
The origins of man.

526
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,567
The mythic stories
from ancient Greece.

527
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,000
It spread like wildfire,

528
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,233
and it formed civilization
as we know it.

529
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,367
- If this techology existed,
we could learn everything.

530
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,567
- Everything.

531
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,133
- I mean, think of
what we could do.

532
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,233
What we could
accomplish with that.

533
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:57,900
- Oh, the things we
could accomplish.

534
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:01,300
I used to think like
that when I was your age.

535
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:05,700
But like I said, my imagination
got the better of me.

536
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:09,200
Civilizations come and go.

537
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,133
People live and die.

538
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:12,533
All for a reason.

539
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,967
These things I listed,
they are times and places

540
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:18,767
we were never meant to see.

541
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,967
Some, including myself, argued

542
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:25,300
that human progression was
as natural as time itself.

543
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:27,767
So we proceded.

544
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:31,967
All of society's mysteries and
questions could be answered.

545
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,500
I spent so much
time concentrating

546
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,000
on the fallout
from travel that I

547
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,733
never considered the
ramifications of viewing.

548
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:44,100
Men would look back
and find the secrets

549
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,700
the government was
hiding from them.

550
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,600
Why are the Kennedys
being killed?

551
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,633
Two brothers, a son.

552
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,067
Scholars would look back
at the savage nature

553
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:55,467
of European settlers
who stole the country

554
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:56,867
from Native Americans.

555
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,700
The truth divided us.

556
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:02,100
And individually armed us.

557
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,467
The world lost faith not just
in God, but in everything.

558
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,733
Anarchy replaced order.

559
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:14,267
Crime, corruption,
destruction took over.

560
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:16,467
No one was afraid
of anything anymore.

561
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,133
No more questions.

562
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,967
No more beliefs.

563
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,433
And all because I couldn't
see down that road.

564
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,100
- Time viewing, huh?

565
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:38,000
But you're not actually
viewing me, you're here.

566
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,600
You're actually sitting right
here, so how is that possible?

567
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:44,700
- You don't believe me?

568
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,700
- It's not my job
to believe you,

569
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,067
but I wanna understand.

570
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,867
So, so, okay, so
you created this

571
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:51,767
amazing technology but not now,

572
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:53,000
some time in the future.

573
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,767
Now that technology
only allows you to see,

574
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:58,433
so how are you here?

575
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:01,900
- I want you to understand
why, moreso than how.

576
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,867
- You gotta understand
that a man of reason

577
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:07,000
the things you're telling me
are all impossible to accept.

578
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,167
I understand.

579
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,300
- I've studied all this.

580
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,733
I've fantasized about it.

581
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:13,300
I mean, most scientists,

582
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,867
people like Albert Einstein--

583
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:17,700
- Hawking.

584
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,100
- Stephen Hawking.

585
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,333
They don't even believe
something like this is possible,

586
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,467
yet you're sitting
here telling me

587
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,667
that you're actually living
proof that it exists.

588
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,100
- Yes, I am.

589
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,767
- The idea of taking a man,
or a woman, from one time

590
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:33,000
and putting them into another
that already happened?

591
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:37,333
It, there's just so many
questions that arise from that.

592
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,500
- I was as skeptical as
you are when I began.

593
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,233
- Okay, one of the biggest
issues that comes up

594
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:45,133
right away is causality.

595
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:47,267
So if you change something
in the past, then...

596
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:49,500
- The grandfather
paradox is something

597
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,200
we all debated for a long time.

598
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,033
If Jimmy goes back into the
past and kills his grandma,

599
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:57,233
will Jimmy or his
family ever exist?

600
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,100
- Right.

601
00:34:58,533 --> 00:34:59,733
So,

602
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,933
- I came to two
conclusions about time.

603
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,300
Many theories existed.

604
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,600
But now I could
eliminate the arguments

605
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,133
that travel wasn't possible.

606
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:10,067
Or that only forward travel was.

607
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:12,500
I did tests and experiments

608
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,367
that lead me to
two possibilities.

609
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,633
Either time was
circular, constant,

610
00:35:17,633 --> 00:35:20,900
or when you went back it
would create an offshoot.

611
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,533
- Like a separate timeline.

612
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:24,067
- That's right, a
new branch of time,

613
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:27,133
moving forward, parallel
to the original,

614
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:29,000
with its own events
and outcomes.

615
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,500
- So which is it?

616
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,733
- A definitive answer
to that question

617
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,000
is close to impossible.

618
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,867
Even if Jimmy goes and
kills his grandfather

619
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:39,167
and wipes out his whole
family in the process,

620
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:43,200
does time ultimately find
its way to the same outcome?

621
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,367
Or is it set in a new
direction, a new course?

622
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:49,333
Or does the original
future coexist

623
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:52,100
with a separate timeline
that Jimmy created?

624
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,467
Or, does Jimmy fail?

625
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,700
Maybe if Jimmy tried
to do something

626
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,467
as significant as kill his
grandfather in the past,

627
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:04,133
time or fate would not allow it.

628
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,633
The gun would jam.

629
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,600
Or a bird would get in the way.

630
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:26,867
- I don't understand.

631
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:28,700
So, if you're from the future,

632
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:31,367
theoretically a time
far after Jimmy would've

633
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:33,900
killed his grandfather wouldn't
you see the changes it made?

634
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,700
- It's not that simple, Doctor.

635
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,767
Firstly, only the
traveler would ever know.

636
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:44,067
If time had changed, we
would never experience it.

637
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:47,600
To us, Jimmy never existed.

638
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:51,400
- Okay, okay, what if someobdy
went back and killed Hitler?

639
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,000
- What if Hitler was killed?

640
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,467
- What?

641
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,133
- What if originally
Hitler was killed?

642
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,867
And someone went
back and changed it?

643
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:02,900
Kept him alive.

644
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:06,900
To us, we would remember
it as our history.

645
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,500
As if it always happened.

646
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,533
Many people believe that time
eventually corrects itself.

647
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,467
If Hitler was dead,
someone would likely

648
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,233
step up and take his place.

649
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,200
Thank God, mercifully I've
never had to test that theory.

650
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,933
- Yeah, but you can.

651
00:37:27,867 --> 00:37:29,067
- I guess so.

652
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:30,667
- You being here brings
all that into question.

653
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,933
I gotta drink, man.

654
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:39,667
You want a soda, a
scotch, water, what?

655
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,200
- Glass of water'll
be great, Doc.

656
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:47,067
So what's the diagnosis, Doc?

657
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:47,900
- Well,

658
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:52,400
you are either crazy,

659
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,033
a very, very accomplished
pathological liar,

660
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,133
or you're telling the truth.

661
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:12,600
- Does it scare you if I am?

662
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:17,600
- I think,

663
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,133
I think regardless
of what happens now

664
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,900
there'll always
be that curiosity.

665
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,133
I can safely say I've never
seen anything like this before.

666
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:28,267
- Good.

667
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:30,300
That's all I could hope for.

668
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,333
- Guess what I still don't
understand is how you're here.

669
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,867
Or if there's some other
reason why you're here.

670
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,900
Is there?

671
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,433
- It's all about causality.

672
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:41,600
The only remaining question
for our species is fate.

673
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,967
Can we change our path?

674
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:46,500
Or is it always set?

675
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:50,600
I didn't know if coming here
would accomplish anything.

676
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:53,700
But I know if I didn't
try and talk to somebody

677
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,467
about what I know, it would add

678
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:58,600
to the long line of regrets
that I keep with me.

679
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:01,567
Maybe fate does exist,
and maybe it doesn't.

680
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:04,867
Maybe it's our destiny to
live with mistakes I've made.

681
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:07,600
Or it could be my
destiny to change them.

682
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:09,867
- Or maybe our
sessions have just

683
00:39:09,867 --> 00:39:11,433
been leading up to this moment?

684
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,067
- That's why I came
back, Doctor Pyatt.

685
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:19,500
Just for the possibility.

686
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:24,267
- I'm gonna force myself
to remain skeptical,

687
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:27,000
as a sane man would, but,

688
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,467
with that being said I
still gotta know more.

689
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:36,167
- Did you ever wish you
could change things?

690
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,600
- Of course.

691
00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:40,400
I don't think you're ever
gonna be alone in that.

692
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:47,767
- There was a time when I
lived to help other people.

693
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:49,900
Like you're doing.

694
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,233
You can go to bed at night
with a clear conscience.

695
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:55,400
You wake up in the
morning knowing,

696
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,233
that you're trying to
make the world better.

697
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,333
You can do that every
day, I had that once.

698
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,667
But it came with a cost.

699
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:06,500
- Did you begin to feel
like your discovery

700
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
made you feel isolated somehow?

701
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,467
- Oh, yes I did.

702
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:13,000
But I had to lose everything
before I saw that.

703
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:15,467
- If you don't mind,

704
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,833
what is "everything"?

705
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:22,000
- My friends, my family mainly.

706
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,100
After a while I
pushed them away.

707
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,567
But not by choice.

708
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,200
- They didn't see what you did?

709
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:34,800
- No, this time I didn't
see what they did.

710
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,867
Who would've guessed
that I'd be rewarded

711
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,233
for opening Pandora's box?

712
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:43,600
I was once revered, but now
I was hit with backlash.

713
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:47,500
If there was one singular
cause that united people,

714
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,433
it was hatred over
what I had done.

715
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,233
- How did that make you feel?

716
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,567
Was that painful?

717
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,300
- Of course.

718
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,067
But it was not the
kind of pain you feel

719
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:58,900
when someone you love
breaks your heart.

720
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,700
It was sort of a
mass humiliation.

721
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,600
A public failure.

722
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:05,900
I felt like a fraud
in my own house.

723
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,200
I created something
revolutionary,

724
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,333
but revolution does not
imply forward progress.

725
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:14,200
I felt like a fraud

726
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,233
because I wanted to
make the world better.

727
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,933
- But instead it turned on you.

728
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,000
- Yes it did.

729
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:24,867
- And what about that other
pain, did you feel that, too?

730
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:26,167
- For a time.

731
00:41:27,133 --> 00:41:28,600
I had a friend.

732
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:32,867
- What, somebody who stuck
by you through everything?

733
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:33,967
- Yes, he did.

734
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:36,500
Early on, he helped
me with my work.

735
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,633
Became my partner.

736
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,733
- He must've really
cared about you.

737
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,567
To see what others wouldn't.

738
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,667
- He understood that the
outcome of my discovery

739
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,233
was not what I had intended.

740
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,967
Or he pretended.

741
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,400
- Something you wanna tell me?

742
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:03,700
Jason?

743
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:06,267
- Sorry, man, what's up?

744
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:09,400
- What's on your mind, man?

745
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,267
- I don't know if I can
really talk about it.

746
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:15,033
Why not?

747
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,200
- It's that old doctor
patient privelege.

748
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,400
- All right, come on.

749
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,700
Just uh, don't tell
me the dirty details.

750
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,933
What's going on?

751
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:25,500
- I just really wasn't
prepared for today.

752
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:30,200
This old patient of mine
came in off the street.

753
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:32,167
We'd been talking
for about a year,

754
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,200
I didn't think anything of it.

755
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,900
I mean he's a normal enough guy.

756
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,700
I mean, you know, normal
in a certain light,

757
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,233
but he sits down
in so many words

758
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:39,267
he tells me that...

759
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:42,867
- What?

760
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:44,533
What, he's a robot,
he's an alien?

761
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:46,500
- He's from the future.

762
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,067
- Ha ha, so he's crazy.

763
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:52,567
Is this why you brought
up the whole changing--

764
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,100
- I've seen crazy before.

765
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:56,900
This guy was very convincing.

766
00:42:59,633 --> 00:43:00,900
- All right, come on.

767
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,333
What's his angle?

768
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,900
Was he uh, trying to get
money out of you or something?

769
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,567
- Come on, man, listen.

770
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:08,000
Just hear me out, I'm
not an idiot, all right?

771
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:10,633
- All right.

772
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:15,300
- He just said some
pretty scary stuff.

773
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:18,667
Look, let's pretend this
guy's the real deal.

774
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:21,000
He comes in, tells
me that the world's

775
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,967
gonna go dark in a few years.

776
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,867
And everything is
severely screwed up.

777
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:27,033
And that he came back
because he wanted

778
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:28,433
to see what he could
do to change it.

779
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,733
That's why I brought
that thing up before.

780
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,733
I just wanted to know
what you would do.

781
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:38,700
- If the world gets
worse and worse

782
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,667
over the next few years, then
I'd say we had it coming.

783
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,367
I mean, who are we to play God?

784
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:44,533
What's done is done.

785
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,533
- Yeah, yeah.

786
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,633
- Ah, man, you're
really hooked on this.

787
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,033
- What's up?

788
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:56,300
- You need to take
some time off.

789
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,233
Spend some time with your wife.

790
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,867
How's your marriage, Jason?

791
00:44:02,867 --> 00:44:03,667
- What do you mean, man?

792
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:04,900
My marriage is fine.

793
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:07,667
- You sure?

794
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:10,600
I mean, all you do is
spend time with me,

795
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,367
playing basketball or at work.

796
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:14,333
- Okay, what happened
to rituals, man?

797
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,667
- Come on, man, I love
you, you're my best friend,

798
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:19,867
but uh, I mean you have
a pregnant wife at home.

799
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:21,500
With your first
child, she loves you.

800
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,367
And all you do is talk to me
about work, week after week.

801
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:27,867
- I know.

802
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,867
Are you sure?

803
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,300
- I just gotta
get my head right.

804
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,867
I will.

805
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:37,100
- I just, I don't want you to
mess things up for yourself.

806
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,533
- How can I mess things
up with you in my corner?

807
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,633
- Okay, but I can't fight
all your battles for you.

808
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:43,867
- I know, I know.

809
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:46,033
Especially in your
condition, Jesus.

810
00:44:46,867 --> 00:44:47,533
- Really?

811
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,900
Ass.

812
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:53,967
- I'm serious, though, I can't
save your marriage for you.

813
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:54,900
- Does that mean
you're not gonna

814
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,300
write me love sonnets anymore?

815
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,533
- Nope.

816
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,333
Okay, maybe for your
birthday, maybe.

817
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:11,000
- How do you do it, Doctor?

818
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:12,900
- I'm sorry?

819
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,367
- Manage your relationships?

820
00:45:16,067 --> 00:45:18,867
Surely your wife is lonely
while you're here at work.

821
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:21,433
Dealing with colorful
characters such as myself.

822
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,333
What does she think of
your chosen profession?

823
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,133
- Our marriage has
its problems, but...

824
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:32,267
I mean, they always do.

825
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,233
She understands
that this is my job

826
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,700
and this is what supports us.

827
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:41,100
And every relationship
has its sacrifices.

828
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,533
- What does she
sacrifice for you?

829
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:44,467
- That's uh, I don't think
that's any of your business.

830
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:47,233
- How often do you
see your friends?

831
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:50,067
- Let's backtrack, I don't
wanna get derailed again.

832
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:52,333
Let's talk about your partner.

833
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:54,267
Now he was probably
closer to you

834
00:45:54,267 --> 00:45:56,033
than most people around you.

835
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,167
- Yes, he was.

836
00:45:59,867 --> 00:46:01,267
He was one of the
remnants of my life

837
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:02,867
before everything changed.

838
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,000
Although he was happy for me,

839
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,867
he thought that
I should sit back

840
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,333
and enjoy the fruits of
my labor with my family.

841
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:13,900
But I could not sit still.

842
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:17,267
I had to be involved
in every adjustment,

843
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:20,333
every refinement to what
I'd given to the world.

844
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,100
- Don't you mean what
you had sold the world?

845
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,867
- Sold.

846
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:26,900
Yes.

847
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:28,867
I had to be at
every demonstration.

848
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:32,100
I might as well have
been government property.

849
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,067
- As your partner stood
by on the sidelines.

850
00:46:36,067 --> 00:46:37,300
- As everyone did.

851
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:39,667
Everyone that was close to me.

852
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,767
You know, in some ways,

853
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,900
my partner was more
naive than I was.

854
00:46:46,267 --> 00:46:49,100
Once the repercussions
were being felt,

855
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,133
no one could've imagined just
how bad it was gonna get.

856
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,167
He was there to adivse
me, to comfort me even.

857
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:57,467
To see me through the storm.

858
00:46:57,933 --> 00:47:00,333
Together we tried to
pick up the pieces.

859
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:02,167
Tried to undo what I had done.

860
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,233
- Did any of it work?

861
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:05,267
- No.

862
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:06,633
- Why?

863
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:09,467
- We tried to stop the
mass consumerization of it.

864
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:11,133
Plead with the government.

865
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:13,500
By this time the
damage was too severe.

866
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,700
The technology was
in too many hands.

867
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,867
Unsteady hands at that.

868
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:19,867
We tried to make attempts
to set things right,

869
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:21,000
but it was futile.

870
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:25,100
That's when I decided,
I have to go back.

871
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,633
Some how, some way,
I had to go back.

872
00:47:27,633 --> 00:47:30,167
I fell deeper and
deeper into my work,

873
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:33,533
trying to push the boundaries
of my initial discovery.

874
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:35,700
To allow for actual travel.

875
00:47:36,867 --> 00:47:38,867
To send a man into the past.

876
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:42,067
My partner pleaded
with me to stop.

877
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,100
But I couldn't.

878
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:47,867
I needed to know if
change was possible.

879
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,667
That's around the
time he turned on me.

880
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:54,900
- Now when you say
he turned on you,

881
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,100
he didn't merely cut you
out of his life, did he?

882
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,500
- Human beings were
once again reduced

883
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,167
to mindless barbarians
and I was responsible.

884
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:05,467
We would've been better
off if a meteor had struck

885
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:06,967
and wiped the slate clean.

886
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,400
Or that a bomb had forced
us to start all over again.

887
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:16,900
But I did it, I
actually did it, Doctor.

888
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,433
See viewing was
only the beginning.

889
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:20,533
But like a rudimentary
computer it only took time

890
00:48:20,533 --> 00:48:24,333
and development before
a new model was born.

891
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,700
You harness a wormhole,
speed up one end

892
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,200
and slow down the other end.

893
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,567
- Go on, go on.

894
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:34,767
- I can't.

895
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:36,567
- Mr. Darnell, you realize--

896
00:48:36,567 --> 00:48:38,600
- Please, please, I can't.

897
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:39,933
Let's leave it at this.

898
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:41,200
- How does it work?

899
00:48:43,867 --> 00:48:45,267
How does it work?

900
00:48:45,267 --> 00:48:46,700
- You have to understand
if I answer that question

901
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,167
you could rip a hole through
everything as we know it.

902
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:51,133
- But that's why
you're here, isn't it?

903
00:48:51,133 --> 00:48:52,367
To change the past,

904
00:48:52,367 --> 00:48:54,033
so you're gonna have
to give me something.

905
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:55,867
- Doctor Pyatt I was under
the impression it was never

906
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:58,200
a good idea to force a
patient to divulge anything

907
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,700
they weren't comfortable with.

908
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,067
- I can't, um, I
can't keep doing this.

909
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:03,333
- All right, all right.

910
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:06,633
I know this must be frustrating.

911
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,467
I can't give you everything,
it just wouldn't be safe.

912
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:21,133
- I'm listening.

913
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:22,400
- You say you like science?

914
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,200
- I do.

915
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,367
- Then go back and
read the concepts

916
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:28,867
presented by Hawking,
Einstein, Lewis.

917
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:33,633
Light speed, black
holes, wormholes.

918
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:37,233
They were so close.

919
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:40,233
There was just one
small piece missing.

920
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,733
I'm sure you're aware,

921
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:45,300
that you're somewhat familiar
with the concept of wormholes.

922
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:48,300
- Sure, yeah, they're
fascinating to wonder about.

923
00:49:48,933 --> 00:49:51,000
- If you don't mind, could
you tell me what you know?

924
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:54,867
- Um...

925
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:58,300
They're a consequence
of Einstein's

926
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,133
theory of general relativity.

927
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:02,433
A wormhole in theory would,

928
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:07,733
act as a shortcut or a passage
way through space and time.

929
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,367
- The physics are even
simpler than your definition.

930
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:12,867
A wormhole creates a tunnel

931
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:15,700
effectively cutting through
two locations in space time.

932
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,500
- Yeah, yeah, therefore
eliminating the need

933
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,700
for three dimensional
travel through space.

934
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,200
No more rocket ships.

935
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,833
I like Stargate, too.

936
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,500
- Oh, wow, Stargate.

937
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,567
It's been a long time
since I've seen that movie.

938
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:29,533
Who was that guy in it,

939
00:50:29,533 --> 00:50:31,167
he was really good
in that old western?

940
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:34,367
- What, Kurt Russell?

941
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,867
- Kurt Russell, he
was good, wasn't he?

942
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:39,233
- Listen, nothing you are
telling me is new information,

943
00:50:39,233 --> 00:50:41,767
all right, the theories
about wormholes have existed

944
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:45,800
for a long time, but nobody
knows if they actually exist

945
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,600
or how to find them.

946
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,500
- But I do.

947
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:50,533
They're everywhere.

948
00:50:50,867 --> 00:50:52,800
Just a matter of seeing
them or harnessing them.

949
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,333
- But you haven't
explained either.

950
00:50:56,633 --> 00:50:57,867
How do you see them?

951
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:00,367
How do you harness them?

952
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,400
A machine, some sort of gateway?

953
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,967
- Of course you need a
machine to sustain a wormhole.

954
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:07,167
But this is where I stop.

955
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,667
I have given you the gun.

956
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:11,900
Let me keep the bullets.

957
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:20,167
- Please, continue.

958
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:24,433
- I found a way to go back.

959
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:26,567
I was alone, but I found it.

960
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:29,133
My old partner was the
only one that knew,

961
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:31,100
but for now, it'll
stay that way.

962
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:34,667
The only question is,
can the ripples I create

963
00:51:34,667 --> 00:51:37,367
be enough to change the future?

964
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:39,767
Or create an alternate one?

965
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,000
- Ripples?

966
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,533
- Think of the water
in that glass as time.

967
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:48,467
Time moves forward
constantly, untouched,

968
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:49,667
as still as the water.

969
00:51:50,267 --> 00:51:52,000
Go back and try to
change something,

970
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:55,433
and it creates a ripple effect.

971
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,067
Change has to
catch up with time.

972
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,667
And everything around it
either changes, or suffers.

973
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,600
- Unless the ripples were
always meant to happen.

974
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,933
- That's what I wanna find out.

975
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,633
The truth is, he
had every reason

976
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,400
and every right to want me dead.

977
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:21,600
I would've done it
myself if I'd thought

978
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,867
that would change anything.

979
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:26,033
- Would you say you have
suicidal tendencies?

980
00:52:27,767 --> 00:52:29,367
- I feel that ultimately
I will have to

981
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:31,633
pay for my sins with my life.

982
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:35,633
I now am only here to set
the wrong things right.

983
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:39,967
My parter pursued
me at great length

984
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:41,600
once he knew what I had done.

985
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,300
And as much as I felt
it was on my shoulders

986
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,667
to set everything
right, he was convinced

987
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,700
that anything I did
to fix the present

988
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:53,933
would continue to
make matters worse.

989
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:57,000
- Have you ever thought
that he may be right?

990
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,300
- He might be.

991
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,333
I don't know yet.

992
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:02,100
I think it's worth the risk.

993
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:06,733
I'm just afraid of what
lengths he might go to,

994
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,567
to see his mission through.

995
00:53:11,033 --> 00:53:12,233
- And your wife?

996
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:14,567
Did you lose her, too?

997
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,900
- You know that saying,

998
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,700
you don't know what you've
got until you lost it?

999
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,533
- Sure.

1000
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:24,967
- When I was a young
man, she kept me steady.

1001
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:28,000
I cannot remember
the precise moment

1002
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,500
where it all fell apart.

1003
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,433
It was gradual.

1004
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:34,033
Like a small scale of illusion.

1005
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,700
Just somewhere down the line,

1006
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:40,967
she realized I couldn't
give her what she needed.

1007
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,767
I didn't even put up a fight.

1008
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:48,367
I apologized, watched
her walk away.

1009
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,700
- Did you love her?

1010
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,867
- Yes, I did.

1011
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:53,233
- And you just let her go?

1012
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:56,733
- I might not have loved
her if she'd stayed.

1013
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,967
How can I respect
someone who stayed

1014
00:53:59,967 --> 00:54:02,233
with someone that couldn't
even respect themselves?

1015
00:54:02,867 --> 00:54:04,500
- Well I think if
you love somebody,

1016
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,500
you make it work
through anything.

1017
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:10,367
I think it's that simple.

1018
00:54:12,467 --> 00:54:13,867
Have you ever considered
you couldn't handle

1019
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:15,967
being there for her
because you didn't want it?

1020
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:17,433
Or you were afraid of it?

1021
00:54:17,867 --> 00:54:20,167
- Doctor Pyatt, if you weren't
sitting here talking to me

1022
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:21,867
right now, what
would you be doing?

1023
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:26,167
- I'd be sitting here waiting
for somebody else to talk to.

1024
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:28,000
- You wouldn't be
home with your wife?

1025
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,567
- This is my job.

1026
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:32,767
It's what makes us money.

1027
00:54:32,767 --> 00:54:34,533
- You're a psychologist
without patients.

1028
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,767
That would explain that
ridiculous brochure.

1029
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:39,767
No, you wouldn't be
sitting here doing nothing,

1030
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:41,867
because Doctor,
this is your escape.

1031
00:54:43,433 --> 00:54:45,733
By being here, you don't
have to face your problems.

1032
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:47,633
You know what I'm
saying is true.

1033
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,767
Maybe you have as much reason

1034
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:52,533
for being on that couch as I do.

1035
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:56,167
- You can't even begin to
understand my situation.

1036
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:58,700
- Yes I can.

1037
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,767
- Oh, well then by all
means, don't stop there.

1038
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:09,033
- Relationships demand
constant attention.

1039
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:11,500
I thought I understood that.

1040
00:55:13,867 --> 00:55:15,033
It was only when my wife told me

1041
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:17,067
that she didn't love me anymore,

1042
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,467
that i realized that I hadn't
given enough of myself.

1043
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:27,567
Relationships demand constant
attention or they fail.

1044
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,367
From someone that learned
a little too late,

1045
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:39,300
make her your priority
over all things.

1046
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:42,367
Your passions, your
job mean nothing

1047
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:44,467
in the face of love, true love.

1048
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:48,167
I've experienced a
lot in my lifetime,

1049
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:49,700
both good and bad.

1050
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:52,867
You're a young man, you
don't wanna be pushing 80

1051
00:55:52,867 --> 00:55:55,067
sitting in a
psychologist's office,

1052
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,333
reminiscing about what you
wish you'd done differently.

1053
00:56:00,533 --> 00:56:01,500
Trust me.

1054
00:56:05,133 --> 00:56:06,300
One morning you wake up

1055
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,300
and forget to kiss
your wife good bye.

1056
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,300
And suddenly you can't
remember the last time you did.

1057
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:26,333
- So I guess I'm
gonna talk to you,

1058
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:28,867
'cause I think you can hear me.

1059
00:56:31,067 --> 00:56:33,300
Feels like it's been a
while since we talked.

1060
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,567
Tracy called this morning.

1061
00:56:40,867 --> 00:56:42,267
I guess there might
be a new temp agency

1062
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:44,600
I could sign on with,
so there's some hope.

1063
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:50,900
Listen, no one knows

1064
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,567
how long it's gonna
be until you wake up.

1065
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:56,600
My mom said she'd
move in to help,

1066
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,133
while you're, while you're away.

1067
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,233
And I'm really dreading that.

1068
00:57:02,633 --> 00:57:04,433
So you need to come to.

1069
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:07,100
I need you.

1070
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,067
And she does, too.

1071
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:16,133
I've been alone a lot lately.

1072
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,233
Without a job and you at work,

1073
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:21,567
and I've had a lot
of time to think.

1074
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:24,867
I haven't done much
else with my time.

1075
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:29,233
The bills keep piling up.

1076
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,067
And I notice how big the
hole gets when you're gone.

1077
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,300
I miss you.

1078
00:57:38,467 --> 00:57:41,067
And I just keep trying
to piece together

1079
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,767
where everything went wrong.

1080
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:47,633
When did it get so bad for us?

1081
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,433
It doesn't seem like
it's been six years.

1082
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,300
I remember, I was
working downtown,

1083
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,033
and you came in
early in the morning

1084
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:01,067
and your tooth was
cracked in half.

1085
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:05,867
And you were freaking out,
your voice was so high-pitched.

1086
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,333
And we rushed you to the chair,

1087
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:12,133
and the doctor turned the TV
on to try to calm you down

1088
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:13,633
but that didn't work.

1089
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,233
And we numbed you, but
apparently not enough

1090
00:58:17,233 --> 00:58:20,633
because when I went to start
working on your filling

1091
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:22,267
you just screamed.

1092
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:30,133
And afterwards you had
the nerve to ask me out.

1093
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,967
You were still all
swollen at the time,

1094
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,067
and you looked like a balloon

1095
00:58:34,067 --> 00:58:36,067
and sounded so ridiculous.

1096
00:58:39,867 --> 00:58:41,067
What happened?

1097
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,567
I mean, when we were dating

1098
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:47,300
you used to come by
work from time to time

1099
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,633
just to surprise me, or say
hello on your lunch break.

1100
00:58:54,633 --> 00:58:55,933
Was it the baby?

1101
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,400
Does the responsibility
scare you?

1102
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:05,967
When you come out of this,

1103
00:59:07,667 --> 00:59:09,433
I want to start again.

1104
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:16,967
Because, without you,
our family doesn't work.

1105
00:59:19,433 --> 00:59:22,067
God, I'm so confused.

1106
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:27,500
And the police can't even
identify the man who shot you.

1107
00:59:31,633 --> 00:59:32,867
God.

1108
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,567
Ovid came by to
check on me today.

1109
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,267
To see you.

1110
00:59:41,433 --> 00:59:43,733
You really know how to
choose your friends.

1111
00:59:45,433 --> 00:59:48,267
He cares a lot for you, for us.

1112
00:59:49,533 --> 00:59:51,033
I hope you realize that.

1113
01:00:24,633 --> 01:00:26,000
- The price of my
ambition extended

1114
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,500
far beyond my wife,
Doctor, it was everything.

1115
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:33,067
Where I'm from, there
are no taxes, no IRS.

1116
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:37,867
No gas stations or
fuel pumps, no warfare.

1117
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,767
No Ronald McDonald's,
no shitty movies,

1118
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:43,667
we don't make those anymore.

1119
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,467
Human kind had acquired
all the information

1120
01:00:48,467 --> 01:00:51,633
it could ever desire,
and it was maddening.

1121
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:58,033
Once you put the power of
God into the people's hands,

1122
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:02,467
they don't believe in anything
anymore but themselves.

1123
01:01:04,533 --> 01:01:06,567
- So, are you a natural skeptic.

1124
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:10,200
- I haven't always been,
remember I've seen what happens.

1125
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,700
I've seen men kill
whole families

1126
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,633
because they didn't
believe in their god.

1127
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:17,867
Politicians murder
each other for control.

1128
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:20,433
Corporations playing
chess with peoples' lives

1129
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:21,700
for a percentage.

1130
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,567
In a way, time has shown me

1131
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:26,400
that people are just
fucking selfish.

1132
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,567
And I'm no different.

1133
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:32,167
Like Icarus, I flew
too close to the sun.

1134
01:01:41,367 --> 01:01:42,567
You gonna get that?

1135
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,033
- You can't expect
any rational mind

1136
01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:56,867
to believe that you're
from the future.

1137
01:01:57,933 --> 01:01:59,467
- I know, that's
why I'm telling you.

1138
01:01:59,933 --> 01:02:01,367
- You certainly can't expect me

1139
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:02,700
to believe what you're saying.

1140
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,867
- You must realize
how important it is

1141
01:02:05,867 --> 01:02:07,233
for you to keep an open mind.

1142
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:09,867
I imagine you've got
something of a feel for me

1143
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:11,033
by this point.

1144
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,400
Surely you see that
I have a sober mind.

1145
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:19,133
And despite the fact
that I sincerely believe

1146
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:20,500
what I'm telling you here,

1147
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,300
I show no signs of lunacy.

1148
01:02:26,567 --> 01:02:27,667
- I think it's still a bit early

1149
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:29,567
for a full diagnosis on that.

1150
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,867
- You're still trying to wrap
your head around me, huh?

1151
01:02:32,867 --> 01:02:35,233
- There are just a lot of
questions that need to be asked.

1152
01:02:35,867 --> 01:02:37,600
All right, so far everything
that you've told me

1153
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,033
requires no shred of proof
or any irrefutable data.

1154
01:02:41,867 --> 01:02:43,333
- What do your
instincts tell you?

1155
01:02:43,867 --> 01:02:45,300
- Being a man of science myself,

1156
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:48,700
going on instincts is not
something I commonly do.

1157
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,667
- Even if you don't believe
I'm from the future,

1158
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,267
you can't ignore the
plausibility of my story.

1159
01:02:55,867 --> 01:02:58,600
And being a man of science,
you must consider it.

1160
01:03:02,267 --> 01:03:03,867
And this is where I get off.

1161
01:03:09,867 --> 01:03:11,033
- Wait, what?

1162
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:12,867
- I've already allowed
this conversation

1163
01:03:12,867 --> 01:03:14,200
to go on too long.

1164
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:18,167
- Now hold on, I
mean, I have sat here

1165
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:21,233
and listened to your
stories, your lectures,

1166
01:03:21,233 --> 01:03:22,667
your, what, your life lessons.

1167
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,267
I've sat here as this
conversation became

1168
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,600
far more than a therapy session.

1169
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,767
You can't just, you can't play
games with people like this.

1170
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,067
- I'm sorry.

1171
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:35,567
- That's it?

1172
01:03:35,567 --> 01:03:36,767
- That's all I have.

1173
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:38,167
- Oh.

1174
01:03:39,967 --> 01:03:42,600
- Your life may've been
easier had I not entered it.

1175
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:45,767
But if you don't mind,
I selfishly will cherish

1176
01:03:45,767 --> 01:03:47,033
the talks we've had.

1177
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,867
You've reminded me of a
world that's worth it.

1178
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:55,400
And I'm grateful.

1179
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:10,500
You ever hear "fools walk in
where angels fear to tread"?

1180
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:50,000
- Thank you.

1181
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:51,667
- No, no, no.

1182
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:52,867
- Oh, I got it.

1183
01:04:52,867 --> 01:04:53,633
- No, man, we--

1184
01:04:53,633 --> 01:04:55,100
- No, lunch is on me.

1185
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,600
- I appreciate it.

1186
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,667
- No problem.

1187
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:03,433
Oh hey, thank you.

1188
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:07,867
- Hey I'm sorry about earlier.

1189
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:09,600
I mean you were totally right
about everything you said.

1190
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:12,200
- I know.

1191
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:15,867
- And I promise
you'll see less of me.

1192
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,300
- Good.

1193
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,467
You know what I mean.

1194
01:05:21,467 --> 01:05:22,900
- Yeah, yeah.

1195
01:05:25,567 --> 01:05:26,533
- What?

1196
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,700
- Today was just so crazy,

1197
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,400
I can't get it outta my head.

1198
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,733
- It definitely doesn't
happen every day,

1199
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:34,000
but take my advice.

1200
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,867
Separate your work life
from your home life.

1201
01:05:36,867 --> 01:05:39,600
You know when you married
Evie you made a commitment.

1202
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,633
I mean, you had your
chance to bail out.

1203
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,933
- I don't wanna bail
out, I love her.

1204
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,400
- Then why don't you do
something tonight to show her?

1205
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,400
- Shit.

1206
01:05:50,567 --> 01:05:52,733
Gotta put the gas
bill in the mail.

1207
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,600
- That's not exactly
what I meant by--

1208
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,267
- No, no, no, no, I
just remembered though,

1209
01:05:57,267 --> 01:05:58,367
but I know what you mean.

1210
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:01,867
I will.

1211
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:04,500
- Let me know how it goes.

1212
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:07,467
- Yeah sure, I'll
just film it for you.

1213
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:08,667
- Really?

1214
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:10,400
- No, man, what is
a matter with you?

1215
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:13,967
- I just haven't had a lot of
time for a sex life, lately.

1216
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:17,633
I mean, I gotta
take what I can get.

1217
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,933
- All right, man,
I'm gonna head home.

1218
01:06:21,933 --> 01:06:23,433
- All right.
- I'll catch you later.

1219
01:06:23,433 --> 01:06:25,167
Okay, you give the
Missus the best for me, okay?

1220
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:26,000
I will.

1221
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:29,067
- Hey you know, give
her a kiss for me.

1222
01:06:29,067 --> 01:06:30,000
- Always.

1223
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,467
- Yeah, a nice big juicy one.

1224
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:33,467
That wasn't very nice.

1225
01:08:00,133 --> 01:08:01,300
- What brings you in?

1226
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,300
- Uh, some special
flowers for my wife.

1227
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,100
- Okay.

1228
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,867
Anniversary, birthday?

1229
01:08:06,867 --> 01:08:08,200
- Uh, kinda a little make up.

1230
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,933
- Been there before.

1231
01:08:09,933 --> 01:08:11,133
Right over here.

1232
01:08:21,933 --> 01:08:22,900
- Let's go with the red.

1233
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,100
- Sounds good.

1234
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,033
Got a nice assortment
here that actually

1235
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:26,433
somebody backed out on,

1236
01:08:26,433 --> 01:08:27,733
so it's already got
the baby's breath,

1237
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:29,300
a nice green mix all with it.

1238
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,067
- How much is that?

1239
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:31,133
$59.99.

1240
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:32,167
- Yes, let's do it.

1241
01:08:32,167 --> 01:08:33,600
- Okay.

1242
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,167
Okay, I've actually got some
change for that right now.

1243
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:40,967
- Awesome.

1244
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,500
- Here's 40.

1245
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:44,867
- Thanks so much for that.

1246
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:46,033
Yeah, feel
free to look around,

1247
01:08:46,033 --> 01:08:46,967
I'm just gonna set
these down for you.

1248
01:08:46,967 --> 01:08:48,200
Awesome, thanks a lot.

1249
01:09:14,033 --> 01:09:14,867
- Thanks again.

1250
01:09:14,867 --> 01:09:15,667
- Yeah, yeah.

1251
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,267
- Look at me, look at me.

1252
01:11:35,133 --> 01:11:36,200
What are you doing?

1253
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,000
- Let me go.

1254
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,333
- No, no, no.

1255
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,100
- Let me go.
- No, no, no.

1256
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:40,733
Give me a chance.

1257
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,167
I'm here, I'm gonna fix this.

1258
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:51,000
- You ruined everything, Jason.

1259
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,067
- If you're so goddamn smart,
what are you doing here?

1260
01:11:54,067 --> 01:11:55,633
- It's the only way.
- It works.

1261
01:11:55,633 --> 01:11:56,867
It's the only way.

1262
01:12:08,567 --> 01:12:09,367
- Please.

1263
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,567
Just give me a chance.

1264
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:11,767
I can fix it.

1265
01:12:11,767 --> 01:12:13,667
- Get out of my way,
or I will put you down.

1266
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:20,567
- Oh, sorry!

1267
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:22,267
- This is where it ends.

1268
01:12:22,267 --> 01:12:24,267
Right here, right now.

1269
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,333
- Yeah.
- Have a good night.

1270
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:33,567
Oh, hey, watch the elevator,
it's really slow today.

1271
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:35,167
- Yeah, does it ever go faster?

1272
01:12:35,167 --> 01:12:35,867
Later.

1273
01:12:35,867 --> 01:12:36,533
Yeah.

1274
01:12:36,533 --> 01:12:37,767
Night!

1275
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:10,700
- No!

1276
01:15:14,567 --> 01:15:15,400
I'd
been given the se.

1277
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:40,567
- With that device,
you have a device.

1278
01:15:41,733 --> 01:15:43,133
The device.

1279
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,633
When the singer have flown
off requiring gravity.

1280
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,333
We could harness the
combined collection

1281
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,300
of wormholes to lead
through space itself.

1282
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,733
And with that previous formula,

1283
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,367
secured,

1284
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,367
we could eliminate
three dimensional
travel through space.

1285
01:16:03,933 --> 01:16:06,967
At the fraction at the energy
thought to be required for it.

1286
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:12,533
- Jason...

1287
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:15,900
Please tell me what's happening.

1288
01:16:17,367 --> 01:16:18,700
I'm in the dark.

1289
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:23,433
Who were those men, and
why did he shoot at you?

1290
01:16:26,867 --> 01:16:27,700
Please.

1291
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:42,567
- Please.

1292
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:48,000
Try to keep an open mind.

1293
01:16:50,033 --> 01:16:51,767
- Okay.
- All right.

1294
01:16:51,767 --> 01:16:53,167
- Okay.

1295
01:16:53,167 --> 01:16:54,767
Do you remember where I took
you for our second date?

1296
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:57,700
Yeah.

1297
01:16:58,933 --> 01:17:00,200
- Tell me, please.

1298
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,667
- Gasworks Park,
on the big hill.

1299
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,167
You wanted to show me the stars.

1300
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,633
- Do you remember what
I said to you there

1301
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:11,867
before I kissed you?

1302
01:17:11,867 --> 01:17:12,733
Jason, I
don't understand what--

1303
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:14,067
- I looked up.

1304
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,567
I looked up at the sky,

1305
01:17:21,867 --> 01:17:23,433
and I said, "Evelyn,

1306
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:27,400
"this is my canvas."

1307
01:17:28,533 --> 01:17:30,100
And the possibilities,

1308
01:17:33,033 --> 01:17:34,900
oh, the possibilities
are endless.

1309
01:17:40,133 --> 01:17:41,267
I see 'em now.

1310
01:17:43,233 --> 01:17:44,600
The possibilities.

1311
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:49,000
The possibilities are
laid out in front of me,

1312
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,633
like a pattern of stars.

1313
01:17:54,767 --> 01:17:56,233
- What happened?

1314
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,000
What happened to you?

1315
01:18:01,267 --> 01:18:04,167
- That man with the gun, okay?

1316
01:18:07,167 --> 01:18:08,333
He wasn't a bad man.

1317
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:10,000
- He tried to kill you, Jason.

1318
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:17,733
- That was Ovid.

1319
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:19,700
What?

1320
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:21,400
- That was Ovid.

1321
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,233
- Ovid, our friend Ovid,

1322
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,733
- your best man, Ovid?
- Yeah, yeah.

1323
01:18:25,733 --> 01:18:27,300
- Jason, Jason,
- He came back.

1324
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,200
how is that possible?

1325
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,233
- He came back.

1326
01:18:31,567 --> 01:18:32,667
He's Ovid.

1327
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:35,867
50 years from now.

1328
01:18:39,467 --> 01:18:41,967
Today a patient of mine
came into my office.

1329
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:44,933
We've been talking
for about a year.

1330
01:18:45,433 --> 01:18:46,733
And I didn't think
anything of it.

1331
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,233
But he told me,

1332
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,667
he told me a fantastical story.

1333
01:18:54,233 --> 01:18:57,133
About a man who made an amazing,

1334
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:03,667
an amazing discovery,
that changed everything,

1335
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:05,267
but it didn't change
it for the better.

1336
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,433
It made everything worse.

1337
01:19:13,267 --> 01:19:14,433
It made it much worse.

1338
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,000
And I knew he wasn't crazy.

1339
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,067
But I couldn't believe
what he was saying,

1340
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:24,767
because I couldn't
accet it to be true.

1341
01:19:24,767 --> 01:19:25,867
But it was.

1342
01:19:29,867 --> 01:19:31,100
It is.

1343
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,067
- The other man in the
hallway, that was him.

1344
01:19:34,067 --> 01:19:34,867
Yeah.

1345
01:19:34,867 --> 01:19:36,100
- Well who was he?

1346
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:41,867
- It was me.

1347
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,233
- I don't understand!
- Please, please,

1348
01:19:44,233 --> 01:19:46,000
please, please, please, please,

1349
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,500
just try to keep
an open mind, okay?

1350
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,267
He came back,

1351
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:55,867
to warn me about the future.

1352
01:19:58,967 --> 01:20:00,400
Hey.

1353
01:20:04,767 --> 01:20:07,567
This is one of the most
difficult moments of my life.

1354
01:20:09,233 --> 01:20:10,400
This thing could,

1355
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:12,433
it could fix everything.

1356
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,333
It could solve all
of our problems.

1357
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,700
Easily.

1358
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,900
We'd have, we'd have money.

1359
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,500
And we'd have freedom.

1360
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,433
We'd have time.

1361
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:34,233
Look in my jacket.

1362
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:35,933
Look in my jacket.

1363
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:39,800
Look at the inside pocket.

1364
01:20:46,267 --> 01:20:47,200
Look closer.

1365
01:20:48,933 --> 01:20:49,933
Look closer.

1366
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:00,100
- Is this a joke?

1367
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:01,767
- No.

1368
01:21:02,767 --> 01:21:03,900
- And so what, you,

1369
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:07,400
you discovered a way to...

1370
01:21:09,767 --> 01:21:10,700
- Yeah.

1371
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:14,733
- Jason, I wanna believe you,

1372
01:21:14,733 --> 01:21:16,633
- I really do.
- Please believe me.

1373
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:23,700
I'm not crazy.

1374
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,900
I'm not crazy.

1375
01:21:32,067 --> 01:21:33,867
You better not be.

1376
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:40,000
- Well maybe after Logan's born.

1377
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,467
- I don't think Skye will
give us that much trouble.

1378
01:21:49,433 --> 01:21:50,267
Do you?

1379
01:21:50,267 --> 01:21:52,900
- No, no, of course not.

1380
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,633
Oh, Eve.

1381
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,333
I'm so sorry.

1382
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:05,700
I'm so sorry.

1383
01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:08,267
I haven't been there.

1384
01:22:08,767 --> 01:22:10,200
I haven't been there at all.

1385
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:12,300
I'm sorry.

1386
01:22:13,533 --> 01:22:15,067
It's gonna be different, okay?

1387
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:16,733
It's gonna be different.

1388
01:22:20,133 --> 01:22:21,367
It's gonna be different.

1389
01:22:22,267 --> 01:22:23,667
It's all gonna be different.

1390
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,100
Oh.

1391
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:41,867
- So, what do we do now?

1392
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,200
I mean, I guess we have
to call someone, right?

1393
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:48,433
I mean, someone has to do
some tests on this discovery.

1394
01:22:49,033 --> 01:22:51,667
I mean, you have to,
you have to have someone

1395
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:53,633
confirm it before
you sell it, right?

1396
01:22:53,633 --> 01:22:54,867
No, I
don't think I can.

1397
01:22:54,867 --> 01:22:56,167
- What do you mean?

1398
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:58,000
- I don't think
I can do it, Eve.

1399
01:22:58,967 --> 01:23:00,433
I don't think I can do it.

1400
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:02,167
- I don't understand, you
just sat there and told me

1401
01:23:02,167 --> 01:23:03,867
that this would fix
all our problems.

1402
01:23:03,867 --> 01:23:05,000
I did, I did.

1403
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,200
- Well then am I
missing something?

1404
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,367
- Well you didn't
hear what he said,

1405
01:23:07,367 --> 01:23:08,300
okay, you didn't
hear what he said.

1406
01:23:08,367 --> 01:23:10,300
This thing destroys everything.

1407
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,367
- Well if this is all true,

1408
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:13,633
I mean how could you
turn your back on it?

1409
01:23:13,633 --> 01:23:16,133
You said yourself, this
is an amazing discovery.

1410
01:23:16,133 --> 01:23:18,267
- Why would my best
friend wanna kill me?

1411
01:23:21,633 --> 01:23:23,000
Why would he want me dead?

1412
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,667
No, if this is the chance
to go back and make

1413
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:25,867
this thing right, then--
No, this would fix

1414
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:27,567
everything, Jason.

1415
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,867
We need that money.

1416
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:33,667
We need it badly.

1417
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:38,000
- We'll get the money.

1418
01:23:39,867 --> 01:23:41,300
We'll get through
this, this is--

1419
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,267
- And, I mean...

1420
01:23:44,267 --> 01:23:46,233
What, are we just gonna
keep this to ourselves?

1421
01:23:46,233 --> 01:23:48,300
I mean, the world
should know about this.

1422
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,733
- There are some things the
world should never know about.

1423
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:50,767
But Jason,
I think that if you--

1424
01:23:50,767 --> 01:23:52,333
- Do you trust me?

1425
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:53,133
Jason, I think--

1426
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:54,267
- Do you trust me?

1427
01:23:56,233 --> 01:23:57,067
I'm sorry.

1428
01:24:00,233 --> 01:24:01,400
Do you trust me?

1429
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,233
- Yes.

1430
01:24:06,233 --> 01:24:07,867
- Then please,

1431
01:24:10,967 --> 01:24:13,533
just try to understand
that I can't do this.

1432
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,133
- Get some sleep.

1433
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,000
We'll leave in the morning.

1434
01:25:59,467 --> 01:26:02,500
- Oh, look at you,
walking around already.

1435
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,033
We'll have you back on that
basketball court in no time.

1436
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,933
Doctor?

1437
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,867
Hey, you there?

1438
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,000
- Yeah, sorry.

1439
01:26:21,533 --> 01:26:22,700
Just a bit fuzzy.

1440
01:26:23,133 --> 01:26:25,567
- Well, we're lucky
that's all it is.

1441
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:27,467
We were worried we
were gonna lose you

1442
01:26:27,467 --> 01:26:28,500
for a minute, there.

1443
01:26:36,767 --> 01:26:37,967
- Yeah, not this time.

1444
01:26:42,933 --> 01:26:44,733
- Got a little, got a little.

1445
01:26:47,167 --> 01:26:48,867
All right, all right,
all right, come on now.

1446
01:26:53,933 --> 01:26:55,100
I got it, thank you.

1447
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:57,300
- You ready?
