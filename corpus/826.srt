1
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,450
Morning, professor.

2
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,810
Good morning.

3
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,450
What do we have
on the board today?

4
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,770
Dr. Cross will be wanting
to pick up

5
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,570
those three 629 Pullmans.

6
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,170
And 630 Observation.

7
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,930
Shouldn't be a problem.

8
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,650
What number?

9
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,490
Um, 423.

10
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,970
I'll have your train
in two weeks.

11
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,850
Uh, okay.

12
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,490
Hi.

13
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,570
Hey.

14
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,170
You forget something?

15
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,570
No.

16
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,570
Hike!

17
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,010
Hike!

18
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,290
All right.
Nice throw.

19
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,490
Nice throw.

20
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,090
Hey, buddy, where's Snow White?

21
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,530
Grumpy or Sleepy
over there, huh?

22
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,890
Lorraine, look.

23
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,650
He's gonna hear you.
Stop.

24
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,970
Miss.

25
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,730
Paper or plastic?

26
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,210
- Paper.
- Sorry.

27
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,410
I didn't see you.

28
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,130
- Cash or charge?
- Cash.

29
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,130
Who's showing the movie tonight?

30
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,730
Carl.

31
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,610
The billowing smoke
as it's coming forward.

32
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,730
My wife was inside the car,
staying warm,

33
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,610
but I was on the hood.

34
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,210
There's people standing by here
as it's going by.

35
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,650
The traffic, of course,

36
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,010
was stopped
to allow the train...

37
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,210
Oh.

38
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,650
Now, here I was hanging out
shooting this

39
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,010
in Canada.

40
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,530
This is Canada.
It's cold.

41
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,330
Snow.

42
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:22,210
The scenery was,
uh, really spectacular.

43
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,450
See, because the train
is moving forward,

44
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,890
the smoke is coming back.

45
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,370
It was not extremely windy,
but the smoke did billow.

46
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,490
And, oh, we're about to go
into a tunnel.

47
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,570
Yeah, we're in a tunnel.

48
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,770
For about a minute.

49
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,530
It got colder
when we were in the tunnel.

50
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,450
It was one of the darker tunnels
in Canada.

51
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,130
Lunch.

52
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,570
He was a nice man.
He was a nice man.

53
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,490
I don't think we've ever met.

54
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,930
No, but I've seen you around.

55
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,130
Well, like, you're one of
those memorable people.

56
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,250
I brought you down here
to discuss your inheritance.

57
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,210
In his will,
Henry bequeathed to you

58
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,650
some property
in Newfoundland, New Jersey.

59
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,570
It's about half an acre of land.

60
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,050
It's got an old train depot
on it.

61
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,690
I have an appraisal of
the property for your records.

62
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,170
- What's happening with the shop?
- The building's been sold.

63
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,570
Golden Spike will be closed,
and the inventory liquidated.

64
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,010
This is all, of course,

65
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,610
in accordance with the terms
I drew up in Henry's will.

66
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,290
How soon?

67
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,850
If everything goes as planned,
no hitches, anything,

68
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,610
a thing like this
takes about six weeks.

69
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,050
I have some preliminary
paperwork for you to sign.

70
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,570
Some other papers
being drawn up.

71
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,490
We have the keys to the depot.

72
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,130
You ever been out to New Jersey?

73
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,210
No.

74
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,890
I drove through it once.
Let me tell you.

75
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,490
I mean, it's pretty,
but there's nothing out there.

76
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,330
Nothing.

77
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,130
Then where'd you go?

78
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,050
I see.

79
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,810
Good.

80
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,570
So, what else, dude?

81
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,730
Yeah?

82
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,650
Andy, why don't you
come out here, bro?

83
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,850
I'm going out of my mind.

84
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,450
Holy shit.

85
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,970
Hey, let me call you back.

86
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,130
Bye.

87
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,410
Wow.

88
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,010
How you doing?

89
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,970
Fine.

90
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,610
Do you sell coffee?

91
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,490
Cafe con leche.
It's the house special.

92
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,250
- You'll love it. Trust me.
- Okay.

93
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,250
I also got hot dogs and muffins.

94
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,250
You live around here?

95
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,970
- Yeah.
- I never seen you around.

96
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,290
Where you from?

97
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,170
- Hoboken.
- No shit?

98
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,290
I live in Manhattan, dude.

99
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,890
So, why you out here?
Work?

100
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,090
Family?
Just, like...

101
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,970
How much do I owe you
for the coffee?

102
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,330
Oh, shit.
Sorry, man.

103
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,850
It's a buck.

104
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,650
Is there a convenience store
nearby?

105
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,210
Yeah. Down the road about
a mile and a half on the right.

106
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,650
This is my pop's truck,
by the way.

107
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,290
He's sick.
That's why I'm out here.

108
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,290
He can't get out of bed.

109
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,370
I'm taking care
of this shit for him.

110
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,130
I've been here for six weeks.

111
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,210
It's driving me crazy.

112
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,490
Thanks.

113
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,170
Hey, I'm here every day
from 7:00 to 3:00.

114
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,610
I'm Joe Oramas.
What's your name?

115
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,650
Fin.

116
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,370
Fin?

117
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,690
Yeah.

118
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,210
Cool.

119
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,850
Hey, your place around here?

120
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,650
Yeah.

121
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,730
Oh, shit.

122
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,810
Oh!

123
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,730
Aah!

124
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,730
Oh, my God.

125
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,690
Oh, my God.

126
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,850
Oh, my God.
Just stay there.

127
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,170
Don't move.

128
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,090
Don't try to get up.

129
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,010
Oh, I'm so sorry.

130
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,490
God.

131
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,610
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

132
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,930
- Can you move everything?
- Yeah.

133
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,450
Are you sure?

134
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,530
Yes.

135
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,010
I'm fine.

136
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,610
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

137
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,890
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

138
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,730
Can I give you a ride somewhere?

139
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,250
No.

140
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,850
You're sure?

141
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,450
Yes.

142
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,130
I'm sorry.

143
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,250
Hey.

144
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,730
Yoo-hoo.

145
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,170
- Good afternoon, Olivia.
- Hi.

146
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,850
One cafe con leche,
two sugar, coming up.

147
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,170
- How you doing today?
- I'm fine.

148
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,450
Here you go.

149
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,810
Oh, hey, did you hear?

150
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,410
Someone moved into the depot.

151
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,130
Oh, that's great.

152
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,650
Yeah.
He's an interesting guy.

153
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,170
Actually, he's a little guy.

154
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,490
Shit.

155
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,250
That it?

156
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,370
Uh, two packs of Drum
and some beef jerky.

157
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,330
Help yourself to the jerky.

158
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,330
Oh, shit.
There he is.

159
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,330
Ow!

160
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,770
Oh! Oh!

161
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,610
God! Oh!

162
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,210
Oh, my God.

163
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,370
Oh. Oh. Oh.

164
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,090
Oh, my God.

165
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,890
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

166
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,210
I can't.
I am so sorry.

167
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,050
- Here.
- Stay.

168
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,690
I saw you.

169
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,210
I tried to put
my cafe con leche down,

170
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,730
and it spilled all over my ass.

171
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,450
It burned me very bad,
so I swerved.

172
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,410
Can I at least give you a ride
back to your train station?

173
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,650
The hot-dog guy
told me where you lived.

174
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,970
No, I'm fine.

175
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,930
You're sure?

176
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,930
Yes.

177
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,890
You're fine?

178
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,450
You're...

179
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,650
Ow.

180
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,970
Yeah?

181
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,450
Did she ask about me?

182
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,090
What'd you tell her?

183
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,890
Don't fucking tell her that.

184
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,610
I don't know.
Make some shit up.

185
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,450
I'll call you back.
Bye.

186
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,930
Hey, Fin.
Bro, you live here?

187
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,970
Yes.

188
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,930
Wow, we're neighbors.
Nice.

189
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,570
Hey, what happened to you?

190
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,850
Nothing.

191
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,770
Listen, do you want to
go down to the Mill

192
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,770
and grab a beer later?

193
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,810
No, thanks.

194
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,610
- You don't drink?
- I do.

195
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,050
You don't want to drink with me?

196
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,890
- I don't like bars very much.
- Oh.

197
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,810
Hey, how about I go get a six?
We can have it right here.

198
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,770
No, thanks.

199
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,690
What are you gonna do?

200
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,610
I'm going for a walk.

201
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,170
Oh, cool.

202
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,810
You mind if I come along, man?

203
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,130
I need the exercise.

204
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,530
I'm turning into a fat shit.

205
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,330
I usually go alone.

206
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,530
I'm a good walker, bro.

207
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,290
I prefer to go alone.

208
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,210
Okay.
All right.

209
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,970
Maybe next time, right?

210
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,370
You know where to find me!

211
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,530
Hi.

212
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,770
You're safe.
No car.

213
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,650
I never told you my name.

214
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,970
Olivia Harris.

215
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,090
This is for you.

216
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:47,610
A housewarming-slash-sorry-
l-ran-you-off-the-road gift.

217
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,810
Oh.
Thank you.

218
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,130
It's dark.

219
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,170
Do you have any glasses?

220
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,570
Or we could just swig
from the bottle.

221
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,970
I have mugs.

222
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,330
Oh.

223
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,210
When I was 19,
I actually slept with a guy

224
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,690
because he rolled
his own cigarettes.

225
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,570
Cheers.

226
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,850
You never told me your name.

227
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,890
Fin.

228
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,970
Oh, that's a good name.

229
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,810
You can get that if you want.

230
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,610
My phone's disconnected.

231
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,850
Oh, shit.
It's mine.

232
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,090
I always forget
I have this thing.

233
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,410
My husband gave it to me
in case of an emergency.

234
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,490
Although he's not
my husband right now.

235
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,090
We're separated.

236
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,210
You don't have a phone?

237
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,410
No.

238
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,970
I love that.
I hate phones.

239
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,170
I have two.
Never answer either of them.

240
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,290
How'd you find this place?

241
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,650
I inherited it.

242
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,770
It's very nice.

243
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,250
Oh!
I love this.

244
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,690
What is this?

245
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,250
It's an old ticket box.

246
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,930
Oh, look at this little drawer.

247
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,890
- Careful. That doesn't...
- Oh!

248
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,130
Oh!

249
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,610
Oh, God.

250
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,090
I'm so sorry.

251
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,330
Oh, my God.

252
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,090
Oh.

253
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,850
Can I sit here for a moment?

254
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,770
Who left you this place?

255
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,450
My friend Henry.

256
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,010
When did he die?

257
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,850
Three weeks ago.

258
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,890
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,330
My son, Sam, died.

260
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,410
Two years ago.

261
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,810
Would you mind not looking
at me right now?

262
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,090
Shit.

263
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,130
Olivia!

264
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,690
You miss your train last night?

265
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,050
Hey.

266
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,650
Brought you a cafe con leche.

267
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,890
Thanks.

268
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,210
Whoa.

269
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,210
So, what happened?

270
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,730
What do you mean?

271
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,930
I been here for six weeks.
I don't get two words.

272
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,850
You're here 24 hours.
It's sleepover time?

273
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,650
She brought me
a bottle of bourbon.

274
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,570
Are you serious?

275
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,570
You should get that.
It's probably her.

276
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,090
My phone's disconnected.

277
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,210
Something's ringing.

278
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,010
She left her phone.
Sweet.

279
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,370
So, what happened?

280
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,330
- Be right back.
- Yo!

281
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,890
Hold on!

282
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,770
Come on.
Tell me what happened.

283
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,570
You're not going anywhere
today, are you?

284
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,770
I'd like to return this.
Do you know where she lives?

285
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,930
I'd freeze her out.
But that's just me.

286
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,330
You're very lucky, bro.
She's a pretty woman.

287
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,170
She got that sexy, smart
older-woman thing going.

288
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,050
Do you know where she lives?

289
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,490
She's on Green Pond Road.
Three miles down the road.

290
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,690
Hey, listen.

291
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,530
If you guys do something later,
can I join you?

292
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,370
We're not gonna do something.

293
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,450
I know.
But if you do, can I join you?

294
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,210
We're not gonna
do something later.

295
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,610
Okay, but if you do?

296
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,930
- Okay.
- Cool.

297
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,130
Hey.
You the man.

298
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,290
You the man.

299
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,610
Hi, leave a message.

300
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,330
Olivia?

301
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,290
Are you there?
Liv?

302
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,050
Look, I really need to
talk to you now.

303
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,890
It's important,
so please call me back.

304
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,370
And I hope you're well.

305
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,010
Okay.

306
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,330
Bye.

307
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,730
Shit.

308
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,010
Janice?

309
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,130
Hi!

310
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,730
- Hey.
- I had a client down here.

311
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,610
- I thought I'd drop by.
- Oh, how nice.

312
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,290
You know, I hate to do this,
but I've actually gotta run.

313
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,330
- Well, that's too bad.
- I know.

314
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,770
Our crazy lives.

315
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,490
How are you?

316
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,770
I'm good.
I'm good.

317
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,290
I gotta go.

318
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,730
Oh, that's okay.
We ought to set a date.

319
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,410
- Definitely.
- I would love that.

320
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,770
Oh, you forgot your phone.

321
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,170
Just leave it.
Bye.

322
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,570
Aah!

323
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,650
Oh, I'm so sorry.

324
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,090
Oh, God, I didn't know anybody
was in here.

325
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,730
Can I help you?

326
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,890
Check this book out?

327
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,290
Okay.

328
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,370
Um, do you have a library card?

329
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,130
No.

330
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,010
Okay, well, do you live in town?

331
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:19,970
Yes.

332
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,850
Okay, well,
I need a proof of address.

333
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,450
If you could bring
in a piece of mail,

334
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,730
then I can give you a card.

335
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,530
You can put it on mine.

336
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,090
- Hi.
- Hi.

337
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,210
No, thanks.
I'll come back.

338
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,250
You sure?

339
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,690
Yes.

340
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,210
Sorry about last night.
I overstayed my welcome.

341
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,810
Bye.

342
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,650
Bye.

343
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,610
Hey, Emily.

344
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,730
Oh, God.
I just screamed in his face.

345
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,970
Oh.
It's all right.

346
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,370
Olivia left it.

347
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,490
You're my hero, dawg.

348
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,850
Hey, Fin.

349
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,570
You want a cold one?

350
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,690
So, what else?

351
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,970
Hey, Fin, I'm taking off!

352
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,010
Manana, baby!

353
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,770
Hey, what are you doing?

354
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:09,090
I'm searching the trucks
for the company name.

355
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,330
Well, these are trains,
not trucks.

356
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,370
The wheels on the trains
are called the trucks.

357
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,650
What grade are you in?

358
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,210
I'm finished with school.

359
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,330
Are you a midget?

360
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,090
No.

361
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,970
Where do you live?

362
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,570
In the depot.

363
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,730
My name is Cleo.

364
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,210
My name's Fin.

365
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,370
Bye.

366
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:43,850
Hey, Fin!

367
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,330
Wakey, wakey, baby!

368
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,930
Hey, I'll be at the truck.

369
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,050
Hey, Joe!

370
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,650
Big Joe!

371
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,370
What's up, fellas?

372
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,650
Oh, look at the stash.
Ron Jeremy.

373
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,530
Thank you.

374
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,850
I'll get your coffees.

375
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,490
You know how I like it.

376
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,850
- All right.
- Thanks, bro.

377
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,010
Hey, how's your old man?

378
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,170
He's doing better.

379
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,410
Hey, let me get one of those.

380
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,890
How long is he gonna be out?

381
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,810
Holy shit.
Look at that.

382
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,210
It's fucking Mini-Me.

383
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:30,890
Hey.

384
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,210
"Da plane!
Da plane!"

385
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,490
- Fin!
- You know him?

386
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,570
Fin!

387
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,050
"Hey, boss!
Hey, boss!"

388
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,010
Shut the fuck up.

389
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,170
- Hey!
- What?

390
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,890
Shut up.

391
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,810
- Why don't you ease up, Joey?
- Two bucks.

392
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,130
- I got it.
- I'm light, man.

393
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,730
Okay.
Of course you're light.

394
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,490
Hey, Joe, we're still playing
softball every Friday night.

395
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,770
Why don't you come by, man?

396
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,770
You should bring
your little buddy.

397
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,050
How funny would that be?

398
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,290
Him walking up to the plate,
you know?

399
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,690
It's like, "Throw one in there!
Throw one in there!"

400
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,290
- All right, see ya, Joe.
- Take it easy, man.

401
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,370
Hello, Olivia.

402
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,410
Hi.

403
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,570
One cafe con leche,
extra sugar, coming up.

404
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,450
- Thanks.
- All right.

405
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,450
Gonna pop in on Fin?

406
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,010
What? Oh, no.
I just drove past him.

407
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,490
Where?

408
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,130
The pond on Lake End Road.

409
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,650
Tell you what.

410
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:52,850
This one's on the house
if you do me one favor.

411
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,530
What?

412
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,730
Do you like it out here, Olivia?

413
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,850
Yeah.

414
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,530
- What do you do for fun?
- I don't.

415
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,810
Me neither.
It sucks, right?

416
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,530
There's not enough cool people
around here, you know?

417
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,290
- Do you live alone?
- Yep.

418
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,130
Do you not like me or something?

419
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:19,930
Why?

420
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,370
You're not exactly pleasant
towards me.

421
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,170
Are you gonna say hi to Fin?

422
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,570
I gotta get going.

423
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,370
I know he wanted to thank you
for the book.

424
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,810
Bye, Joe.

425
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,730
Hey.

426
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,570
What's going on?

427
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,410
Olivia says hi.

428
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,250
She just gave me a ride.

429
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,130
What are you doing?

430
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,050
Watching trains.

431
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,930
What's this?

432
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,930
A train guide.

433
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,610
Can I look at it?

434
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,330
What time did
the last train come?

435
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,170
Hour and 23 minutes ago.

436
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,690
Seriously?

437
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,410
Holy boring.

438
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,410
Mind if I hang out a while?

439
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,210
No.

440
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,650
- Are you hungry?
- No.

441
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,010
Thirsty?

442
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,210
No.

443
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,330
You don't really say much,
do you?

444
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,330
Guess not.

445
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,890
Guess not.

446
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,210
Hey, hold on.

447
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,770
Olivia!

448
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,250
Hey!

449
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,850
- Oh.
- Hey.

450
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,850
You missed a great day
of train watching.

451
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,610
Oh.

452
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,490
Maybe next time.

453
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,170
Hey, Olivia!

454
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,890
Yeah?

455
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,850
Could you give us a ride home?
My feet are killing me.

456
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,810
Uh...

457
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,970
Man, when you guys taste this,

458
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,930
you're gonna be so happy
we did this, trust me.

459
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,010
Anybody?

460
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,970
No, thanks.

461
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,530
Fin.

462
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,650
Everyone's doing it.

463
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,250
It's there if you want it.

464
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:15,730
Hey, Fin.
Let me ask you a question.

465
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,970
What do you think of Amtrak?

466
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,290
I don't know.
I've never ridden on Amtrak.

467
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,450
- You've never ridden Amtrak?
- No.

468
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,570
That's weird, right?

469
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,810
I thought that's what
you train guys did.

470
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,650
How's your dad, Joe?

471
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,890
Well, he's driving me nuts,
but he's better.

472
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,250
Thanks.

473
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:40,170
Chuleta con cebolla,
con arroz con frijoles.

474
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,690
Cuban surprise, in other words.

475
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,050
Bring 'em in.

476
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,850
What?

477
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,250
Grace.

478
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,050
- Really?
- Yeah, we gotta give thanks.

479
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,250
Come on.
Bring them in.

480
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,730
Hands around.

481
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,370
- Who wants to say it?
- You.

482
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,890
God, thank you for letting us
sit here and enjoy this meal.

483
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,050
Please watch over everybody.

484
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,770
Please let my dad heal

485
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,130
'cause he's driving me
fucking crazy.

486
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,850
Anybody you guys
want to mention?

487
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:19,810
No.

488
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:20,890
Amen.

489
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,370
Let's dig in.

490
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,850
- Olivia, plate.
- Oh.

491
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,370
Fin?

492
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,410
Let me ask you a question, Fin.

493
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,290
Do you people have clubs?

494
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,490
What do you mean?

495
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,930
You know, like
a "train of the month" club.

496
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,970
Yeah, there are clubs.

497
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,770
What do you guys do?

498
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,250
Well, they get together,

499
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,970
and they look at
old photographs,

500
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,410
and sometimes
they watch a movie.

501
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,130
Watch a movie?
That's cool.

502
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,290
Oh, shit.
Sorry.

503
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,450
This looks good.

504
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,530
Uh, what kind of movies?

505
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,050
Well, there are people
called train chasers.

506
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,050
They follow a train,
and they film it.

507
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,410
Are you a train chaser?

508
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,610
No.

509
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,050
How come?

510
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,890
I don't know how to drive a car.

511
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,930
And I don't own a camera.

512
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,930
That'd do it.

513
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,450
I gotta split.

514
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,050
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

515
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,370
That was my dad.

516
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,130
He can't find his medication.

517
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,650
Totally sucks.

518
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,290
This was fun, right?

519
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,410
Yeah.

520
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,290
Cool.

521
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,050
All right, well,
we'll do it again, all right?

522
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,890
Bon appetit.

523
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,570
This is really good.

524
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,490
Yes.

525
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,530
We don't have to talk.
We can just eat.

526
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,050
I'm cool with that.

527
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,530
Okay.

528
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,650
Hey, Sancho Panza,
what's this called again?

529
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,410
Walking the right-of-way.

530
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,770
How am I doing?

531
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,770
You're doing okay.

532
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,090
I told you
I was a good walker, bro.

533
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,970
Boom!

534
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,490
Give me another one.

535
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,250
That one?

536
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:09,970
Boom!

537
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,690
Hi.

538
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,970
- Hey.
- Hi.

539
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,890
Did you get any mail yet?

540
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,210
No.

541
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,890
Bye.

542
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,050
You're fucking
unbelievable, bro.

543
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,530
I don't suppose you
want to grab a beer.

544
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,370
No, thanks.

545
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,890
You gotta get over
the bar thing.

546
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,010
Seriously.

547
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:55,010
All aboard! Tickets, please!

548
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,290
Next stop, Cleveland, Charity,

549
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,130
Newark, San Diego,

550
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,570
California, Winston.

551
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,330
And San Diego, California.

552
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,250
Next stop.
Thank you very much.

553
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,330
All aboard.

554
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,530
Hi.

555
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,010
Hi.

556
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,210
What are you doing?

557
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,810
I was looking for Fin.

558
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,450
What's your name?

559
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,370
Cleo.
What's your name?

560
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,810
Olivia.

561
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,090
Are you Fin's mother?

562
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,770
No.

563
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,090
No, I'm just his friend.

564
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,410
Do you want to see
my spike collection?

565
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,730
I don't know.
What's a spike collection?

566
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,130
You know, like, train spikes?

567
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,570
Oh.

568
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,530
Actually,
that sounds kind of cool.

569
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:48,570
I'd like that.

570
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,810
Come on.

571
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,330
I don't need a ticket?

572
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,370
No.

573
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,130
- You sure?
- Yeah.

574
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,290
Be careful.

575
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:01,130
Hey, how about from
L.A. To San Francisco?

576
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,890
The Starlight Express.

577
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,570
That's gotta be
fucking beautiful.

578
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,930
Yeah, but I think
the Zephyr would be better.

579
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,530
The Zephyr?
Where does that go?

580
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,850
Through the Rocky Mountains
outside of Denver.

581
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,730
Great mountain passes.

582
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:18,970
Hey, Fin!

583
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,330
Somebody left you something.

584
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,010
Ooh, what's that?

585
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,050
"Happy moviemaking.
Olivia."

586
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,050
What's it for?

587
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,010
Train chasing.

588
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,850
No, it's not.

589
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,330
Yeah, it is.

590
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,170
- Can I see?
- Nope.

591
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,330
Hey.
I know. I'm late.

592
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,890
My pop was up coughing
all night.

593
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,370
He kept me up.

594
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,850
Hey, grab those chairs,
would you?

595
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,450
Hey, man, question.

596
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,370
Why don't you ever sit
in the lounge?

597
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,650
The lounge?

598
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,290
The lounge.

599
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,330
I like to read when I eat.

600
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,090
You can't read in the lounge?

601
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,490
You'll talk to me.

602
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,010
Not if you don't want me to.

603
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,130
Fin, I promise.

604
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,210
I'll read, too.
I got a book in here.

605
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,410
Here.

606
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,330
I'll read, too.

607
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,170
This isn't so bad, right?

608
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,970
Right.

609
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,330
You reading about trains?

610
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,090
Yep.

611
00:41:59,170 --> 00:41:59,970
You know what?

612
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,970
You should get a job
on the railroad.

613
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,410
You said you weren't gonna talk
to me if I sat here, Joe.

614
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,010
I haven't said anything in,
like, 20 minutes.

615
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,370
Nine.

616
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,130
- You timed me?
- Mm-hmm.

617
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,850
That's cold, bro.

618
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,890
Hey, you gonna walk
the right-of-way today?

619
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,530
No.

620
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,930
Tomorrow?

621
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,250
Yeah.

622
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,050
The number for Olivia Harris
on Green Pond Road.

623
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,330
Thank you.

624
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,610
What?
Go back to your book, man.

625
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,370
I don't think we should do this.

626
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,690
Seriously?

627
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,010
Come on.
You can do it.

628
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,450
This is a little scary.

629
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,210
This is really beautiful,
Fin.

630
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,570
You sure there's no trains
on this track?

631
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,530
No, it stops right down there.

632
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,850
I'm starving.

633
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,290
You want some beef jerky?

634
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,010
Absolutely.

635
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,730
You had it all this time?

636
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,090
Want some?

637
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,570
I'll pass.

638
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,810
Fuckin' delicious.

639
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,850
Let me have a piece.

640
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,610
Fuckin' good.

641
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,450
So beefy.

642
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,290
This is good.

643
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,370
That was a good walk.

644
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:31,530
Why is it called
"walking the right-of-way"?

645
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,890
It's complicated.
You know, it's, uh...

646
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,210
I'll let Fin answer this one.
Fin?

647
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,410
When the railroads
were being built,

648
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,130
the government took
a lot of private land,

649
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:46,570
saying the railroad needed
the right-of-way

650
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,370
through the property.

651
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,490
Hey, can we get some sodas?

652
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,290
We're closed!

653
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,490
I'll play soccer with ya,
though!

654
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,490
Ooh!

655
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:08,450
- He does enjoy life.
You guys want to play?

656
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,810
Let me have it!

657
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,970
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

658
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,610
Whoa!

659
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:19,690
Whoa!

660
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,370
- Ooh.
- Jesus!

661
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,130
Are you okay?

662
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:37,090
Uh, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

663
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,010
I'll see you later.
Bye.

664
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,490
Bye.

665
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,650
Olivia!

666
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,050
Hey!

667
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,770
Olivia!

668
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,330
Where's she going?

669
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,610
This is Joe Oramas
reporting live

670
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,890
from the inside of Gorgeous
Frank's Hot Dog Emporium.

671
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,170
Open every day from 7:00
to 3:00. Keep it on me.

672
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,130
Camerawork by...
turn it on you, turn it on you.

673
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,250
Finbar McBride!

674
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,810
Whoo!
We're train-chasing, baby!

675
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,770
Coming at you live
from the Susquehanna train!

676
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,890
Whoo!

677
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:51,010
This fuckin' train is huge!

678
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,130
Yeah!

679
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,330
Whoo!

680
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,850
Hi, leave a message.

681
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,490
Olivia, hey, what's up?
Scorsese and Coppola here.

682
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,090
Listen, we're done
with the movie.

683
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,210
We want to screen it.

684
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,450
We can either do it at Fin's
pathetic little hovel of a home

685
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:25,770
or we can do it
at your beautiful home

686
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:26,570
with your beautiful self.

687
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,450
Get back to us.

688
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:31,810
Shit.

689
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,570
Coming!

690
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,890
You're early.

691
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:54,850
Are we early?

692
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:55,810
No.

693
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,370
We're not early.

694
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,290
Well, there's wine and beer
in the fridge

695
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,490
and liquor in that funny
little cabinet in the corner.

696
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,890
I'll be right back down.

697
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,250
Holy shit.

698
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,530
I heard that, Joe.

699
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,770
What? I was just talking
about the view.

700
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,330
Bullshit.

701
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:20,850
It's just that
they're a little...

702
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,850
I don't want to hear it, Joe.

703
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,930
What do you think?

704
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,770
What?

705
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,130
Hey, Olivia!

706
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,730
You got a garlic press?

707
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:38,650
No.

708
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,570
How can you not have
a garlic press?

709
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,490
Still no.

710
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,010
All right.
You keep talkin'.

711
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,410
I'm gonna go cook
without the garlic press.

712
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,410
I'm not used to having people
in my house.

713
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,370
Especially loud people.

714
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,290
It's a nice house.

715
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,410
Yeah.

716
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:57,650
David bought it
as a getaway place, so...

717
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,130
I moved down here and got away.

718
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,850
Where did you used to live?

719
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,530
Princeton.

720
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,570
I know.
I didn't get very far.

721
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,930
I just couldn't stay there
another minute.

722
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,130
Everyone looking at me.
The poor woman whose son died.

723
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,490
How about you?

724
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:18,010
What made you pick Newfoundland?

725
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,810
I wanted to live near Joe.

726
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,650
Guys.

727
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:29,490
Would you come up here and talk?
Seriously, this sucks.

728
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,050
Finbar McBride!

729
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,690
Whoo, we're train-chasing, baby!

730
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,250
Trains are really cool.

731
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,810
They are.

732
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,690
So are horses.

733
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,490
Whoo!

734
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,770
What?

735
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,210
I was just thinking that.

736
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:15,850
Give me the joint, man.

737
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:19,810
This fuckin' train is huge!

738
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,450
Shh. Shh.

739
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,930
Yeah!

740
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,970
Have you ever been in love, Fin?

741
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,370
Yeah.

742
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:40,410
What happened?

743
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,650
I was young...

744
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,810
and, uh...

745
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,610
really angry.

746
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,090
About what?

747
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,130
Um...

748
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,370
Being a dwarf.

749
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:09,690
You know, it's, uh...

750
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,930
It's really funny how...

751
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:19,290
different people...

752
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:22,650
see me and treat me.

753
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:34,930
Because I'm actually just
a very simple, boring person.

754
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,130
What about you?

755
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,930
Are you still in love
with David?

756
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,650
Yes.

757
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,930
I don't think he's moving.

758
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,250
I'll wake him.

759
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:58,250
No, you're not gonna have
any luck.

760
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:02,090
- Maybe I should go.
- No. No.

761
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,490
You're not leaving.
You're both staying here.

762
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:07,810
And don't argue
because I'm just too tired.

763
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:09,530
Would you like some water?

764
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:11,850
No. I'm all right.
Thanks.

765
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,970
- You can get under the covers.
- No.

766
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:21,930
I'm fine.

767
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,810
I brought you some water anyway.

768
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,570
And a towel.

769
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,050
That's Sam, huh?

770
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,690
Yeah.

771
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,930
He fell off the monkey bars.

772
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:51,450
I turned my head for a second.

773
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,410
Looks like a happy kid.

774
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,730
He was.

775
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:07,010
Well...

776
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,730
- Good night.
- Good night.

777
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,090
Hi.

778
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:01,730
Who are you?

779
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,130
I'm Fin.

780
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:04,970
Where's Olivia?

781
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,290
I think she's upstairs sleeping.

782
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,450
Hey, you're Olivia's ex.

783
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:10,690
I just saw your picture
in the kitchen.

784
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,090
Yes.

785
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,490
I'm Joe.

786
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:17,570
I think Olivia's sleeping, man.
Tore it up last night.

787
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:18,810
Huh.

788
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,010
David?

789
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:26,730
Hi.

790
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,010
What are you doing here?

791
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,650
I wanted to talk to you.
And you won't call me back.

792
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,050
I didn't feel like talking.

793
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,650
Yeah, yeah, I got that much.

794
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:41,650
Can you guys leave us alone?

795
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,410
Thanks.

796
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,330
Are you gonna be okay?

797
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,250
Yeah.

798
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,850
You wanna explain that?

799
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:03,690
- No.
- No, what?

800
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,770
I'd just like to know
what the hell's going on.

801
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:07,450
No, I came all the way down here

802
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,690
because you won't pick up
the phone.

803
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,210
I have nothing to say to you!

804
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,850
Don't walk away from me.
Can you listen to me?

805
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,530
Fin!

806
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:38,530
Here, Fin.

807
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,170
It's a permissión slip
so you can speak at my school.

808
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,530
I can't speak
at your school, Cleo.

809
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,530
Yes, you can.

810
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,770
You can pick any Friday
that you want.

811
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,290
I'm sorry.
I can't.

812
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:54,810
Why?

813
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,370
It's just not something
I can do.

814
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,730
You have to!

815
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:58,970
I'm sorry.

816
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:02,370
But I already told everyone
you were coming!

817
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:03,330
I'm sorry, Cleo.

818
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:04,530
No, you're not.

819
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:07,010
If you were sorry,
then you would come.

820
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,690
What was that all about?

821
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,770
I guess no coffee
for Olivia today.

822
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,410
No.

823
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:25,970
Guess not.

824
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,810
I didn't like that guy, man.

825
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:52,170
Who?

826
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,850
Olivia's ex.

827
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,170
Uptight white guy.

828
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:00,250
Can I ask you
a personal question?

829
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:02,010
Sure.

830
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,450
You've had sex, right?

831
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:07,170
Yes.

832
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,850
With a regular-sized chick?

833
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,130
Yeah.

834
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,850
With a regular-sized chick.

835
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,210
You ever had it
with someone your own size?

836
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,330
No.

837
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:25,130
Do you wanna?

838
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,850
I don't want to talk
about this, Joe.

839
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:30,090
- Why?
- I just... I just don't.

840
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:17,890
Hi.

841
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,050
Hi.

842
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:19,970
I have my bill.

843
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:21,490
Oh. Cool.

844
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,650
I can make you out
a card right now.

845
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:28,170
I just need you
to fill that out.

846
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,610
There you go.
And I'll get your card.

847
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:37,450
Your first name is Finbar?

848
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:38,850
Yes.

849
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,570
My name's Emily.

850
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:41,530
Hi.

851
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,250
Hi.

852
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,050
You have a nice chin.

853
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,010
Thanks.

854
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:59,810
A nice chin?

855
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,050
Yeah.

856
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,290
Seriously?

857
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,490
Yeah.

858
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:06,970
Fuckin' weird.

859
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,650
That's Olivia.

860
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:19,810
Hey! Olivia!

861
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:21,450
That was her, right?

862
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,610
I think so.

863
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,690
What was that?

864
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,930
She had to see us, right?

865
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:33,970
Shit.

866
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,130
It's my pop.
We're going to the Mill tonight.

867
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,170
He wants to know
if you want to join us.

868
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,330
Okay.

869
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:47,450
Really?

870
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:48,730
Yeah.

871
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,490
Yeah, Good to Go.

872
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,730
Yeah, okay.
Address?

873
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,850
34 Green Pond Road.
Yeah. Name?

874
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:06,810
Harris.
All right.

875
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:08,890
Right, okay.
Two of those.

876
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:09,930
Yeah.

877
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,810
All right.
Yeah. Is that it?

878
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,890
Okay, my delivery boy's
out of the store now,

879
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,970
so it's gonna be
a couple of hours.

880
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,210
Yeah, okay. Bye.

881
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,770
Excuse me.

882
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:24,530
That delivery for Olivia Harris.
I'll take it to her.

883
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:26,170
What?

884
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,970
She's a friend of mine,
and I'm...

885
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,930
I'm gonna go that way.

886
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,250
You're gonna have to pay for it.

887
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,410
- Yeah. Sure.
- Before you leave the store.

888
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:36,530
Yeah.

889
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:53,370
- Hey.
- Hey.

890
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,090
I got your groceries.

891
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:56,450
I was in the store
when you called,

892
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,090
so I thought
I'd bring them over for you.

893
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:00,010
Thank you.
How much?

894
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,010
How are you?

895
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,970
I'm fine.

896
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,610
How much?

897
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:09,450
$20.

898
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,490
I got it.
I got it.

899
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:17,010
Thank you.
Bye.

900
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,370
Can I get you something?

901
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,810
Yeah.
Just a beer.

902
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,250
Anything else?

903
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:02,810
Getting a jump on happy hour?

904
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:04,890
No.
I'm waiting for a friend.

905
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,450
Oh. Me, too.

906
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,530
Do you mind if I sit here?

907
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,890
So, I saw you
at the hot dog stand.

908
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,370
I live in the depot.

909
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,010
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

910
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,570
Oh, cool.

911
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,810
You're like that old guy
in the movie

912
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,890
who does the telegraph thing.

913
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:26,370
Something like that.

914
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,250
Oh.

915
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,170
Hang on.

916
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:34,370
Hey, where are you?

917
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:38,450
So you couldn't call?

918
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,370
No, it's fine.

919
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,050
Don't come.
I... no.

920
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:45,450
Just do whatever
you're gonna do.

921
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:49,930
No, actually, I met a friend,
and we're having a drink, so...

922
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,810
I'm gonna go.

923
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,170
Oh, my God, he's such a prick.

924
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:55,490
You want your fries here,
sweetie?

925
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,530
Yeah, thanks.

926
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:04,530
I'm pregnant.

927
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:09,050
I haven't told anyone yet.

928
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,570
Even Chris.

929
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:14,370
I was gonna tell him today.
He's probably gonna freak out.

930
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:18,010
You don't have to say anything.

931
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:20,490
I just wanted to say it.

932
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:25,170
Thank you.

933
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:31,650
Here.
You can have some of my fries.

934
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:34,810
"You say
you're brokenhearted"

935
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:35,810
Where's your friend?

936
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:38,690
"You can't sleep at night"

937
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:42,690
I don't know.

938
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:52,530
Can I give you a ride home?

939
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:54,290
No, thanks.

940
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:56,930
Thanks for hanging out.

941
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,570
Sure.
Of course.

942
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,810
Hey, baby.

943
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:09,570
This your little friend, huh?

944
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,610
Fuck you, Chris.
I'm leaving.

945
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,170
Emily.

946
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,330
Emily, wait.

947
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:16,530
- Get off of me!
- Hey.

948
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:18,370
Please, don't do that.

949
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,570
This is none of your business,
all right?

950
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,650
You want to get out of my way?

951
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:25,170
Oh, my God, stop it!
Stop it!

952
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,890
Fin, go! Go!
Just go!

953
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,490
What's that guy's problem?

954
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,010
Fucking freak.

955
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:36,730
You're such a fucking prick.

956
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:39,010
Emily.
What?

957
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:27,170
Hey.

958
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,690
What's up?

959
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,290
- I brought you some coffee.
- Thanks.

960
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,650
Hey, man, I'm sorry
about last night.

961
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:40,090
My pop, you see,
he got a little pain,

962
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:42,050
and so I got nervous, you know.

963
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:44,810
And I called the doctor.
He's okay, though.

964
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,410
By the time I called the Mill,
you were gone already.

965
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:49,570
You gotta get a phone, bro.

966
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,970
So, was the Mill fun last night?

967
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,650
Nope.

968
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,010
Any word from Olivia?

969
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:56,890
- No.
- You wanna do something tonight?

970
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,370
No.

971
01:05:58,850 --> 01:05:59,730
What the fuck, man?

972
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:02,530
I said I was sorry.
What more do you want from me?

973
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:06,810
I want to be left alone, Joe.

974
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:08,570
Okay?

975
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:11,210
That's what I want.

976
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:16,290
Fine.
Be alone.

977
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,130
Hi, leave a message.

978
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:20,010
Pick up the phone.

979
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:21,770
Liv?

980
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,410
You're starting to scare me.

981
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:24,810
Olivia?

982
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:27,250
Pick up the goddamn phone!

983
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:51,130
I was just about to knock.
I'm sorry.

984
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:54,170
No. Come in.

985
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:01,050
Whoa.

986
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:03,490
This place is cool.

987
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:05,370
Can I...

988
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:10,090
Wow. So, are you
gonna fix this up?

989
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,250
I don't know.

990
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,330
- I suppose so.
- You should.

991
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:15,770
You could make it really nice.

992
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:18,010
It's really nice
right now, but...

993
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,650
Where do you sleep?

994
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:22,610
Couch.

995
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:24,290
Oh.

996
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:29,610
So, I just wanted to come by
and say I'm sorry.

997
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,090
Chris can be such an asshole
when he gets angry,

998
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:33,490
but he's really not a bad guy.

999
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,970
It's just...

1000
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:40,050
God, it's so nice
and quiet in here.

1001
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:43,090
Everybody's freaking out at my
house about me being pregnant.

1002
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:44,850
I live at home.

1003
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,890
I was gonna move in
with Chris, but...

1004
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:55,890
So, did the conductor guy
used to live here?

1005
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:59,010
No. The conductor
worked on the train.

1006
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:02,250
The station agent
worked in here.

1007
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:04,970
Doing what?

1008
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:06,970
A lot of things.

1009
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:08,930
The train brought in the mail.

1010
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:11,690
And the agent delivered it.

1011
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:13,290
They sold groceries.

1012
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,050
They cut hair.

1013
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:16,370
Really?

1014
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:17,730
Yeah.

1015
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,530
Are you gonna open a salon?

1016
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:22,770
I'm retired, actually.

1017
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:24,530
Aren't you a little young
to be retired?

1018
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:27,850
No.
Dwarfs retire early.

1019
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,050
Common fact.

1020
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:31,570
Yeah, lazy dwarfs.

1021
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:57,330
Can I stay here tonight?

1022
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:59,690
Just sleep?

1023
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,650
Hey, Fin.

1024
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:34,050
Is that your girlfriend?

1025
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:36,730
No.

1026
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,530
Is that other woman
your girlfriend?

1027
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,370
You mean Olivia?

1028
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:43,930
Mm-hmm.

1029
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:45,250
No.

1030
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,890
I liked her.

1031
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,650
Yeah. Me, too.

1032
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:53,170
When is she coming back?

1033
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,290
I don't know.

1034
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:00,770
What?!

1035
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:03,450
There is nothing!
There is nothing!

1036
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,810
You have no right to say that.

1037
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:08,850
You just show up,
and you tell me this?

1038
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:11,970
I've known you for 17 years!

1039
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:15,450
You've known me
17 fucking years,

1040
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:18,850
and you don't...
you have no clue?

1041
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:20,730
No, David.
What?

1042
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:22,450
What would be...

1043
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:25,250
What could be
more important than this? What?

1044
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,690
How could you do this?

1045
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,130
Just go to hell!

1046
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,330
Olivia.

1047
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:42,890
Go away.

1048
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:45,410
Are you okay?

1049
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:49,330
I don't want you here, Fin.
Go away.

1050
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:50,890
- Please, Olivia, just...
- Look...

1051
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:54,010
I'm not your fucking girlfriend
or your mother, all right?

1052
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:55,210
I know that.

1053
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:56,890
- Are you all right?
- You're not a child!

1054
01:12:57,010 --> 01:13:00,570
Get off the fucking porch,
and leave me alone!

1055
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:24,290
"Lay me down"

1056
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:47,850
Two.

1057
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,530
Down it slow.

1058
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,610
Oh!

1059
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:49,410
Here I am!

1060
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:53,570
Take a look.

1061
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:58,330
Take a look!

1062
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:02,970
"Lay me down..."

1063
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,810
Olivia?

1064
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:32,090
Olivia?

1065
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:45,290
Olivia?

1066
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:54,810
Did you take these?

1067
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,450
He's having another baby.

1068
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:00,610
Did you take all of these?

1069
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:03,250
Oh, gosh.

1070
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:05,170
I gotcha, I gotcha.

1071
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,370
Come on.

1072
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:09,050
Oh, God, Fin.

1073
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:16,810
I want...

1074
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:20,330
I want...

1075
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:23,010
I want Sam back.

1076
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,410
I want him back.

1077
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:31,170
Oh, God.

1078
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:35,970
I want him back.

1079
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:34,650
You can come in now,
Mr. McBride.

1080
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:39,850
Everyone, I want you
to give Mr. McBride

1081
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,010
your full attention.

1082
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:50,770
"I am here
to speak about trains.

1083
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:52,730
The first real train
in this country

1084
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:55,370
was built by Peter Cooper
in 1829.

1085
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:58,290
Does anyone know
what it was called?"

1086
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:03,850
"It was called the Tom Thumb."

1087
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:08,890
"Since that time,

1088
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:13,290
trains have helped make
this country what it is today.

1089
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:14,610
A long time ago,

1090
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:18,410
most people never left their
towns because travel was hard."

1091
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:19,450
Uh, yes?

1092
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:21,010
How tall are you?

1093
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:22,370
Jacob!

1094
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:25,490
I'm, uh... I'm four feet
and five inches tall.

1095
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:27,330
I'm taller than you.

1096
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:28,970
Jacob, come with me.

1097
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:29,970
I'm so sorry.

1098
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,130
Be back in a minute.

1099
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:33,890
Such a jerk.

1100
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:42,890
What about blimps?

1101
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,530
I think blimps came later.

1102
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:46,010
When?

1103
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:48,090
I'm not sure exactly.

1104
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:49,570
Blimps are cool.

1105
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:51,290
Well, so are trains.

1106
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:54,250
Yeah, well, they're both cool.

1107
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:56,450
Trains and blimps.

1108
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:08,770
Anybody hungry for dessert?

1109
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,170
I'm stuffed.

1110
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:11,810
Yeah. Me, too.

1111
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,490
There's plenty of food.

1112
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,810
We can have it
for lunch tomorrow.

1113
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:28,130
Hey, when were blimps invented?

1114
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,170
I have no idea.

1115
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:34,330
Yeah, me neither.

1116
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:39,130
You can go down to the library
and ask that little hottie.

1117
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:40,930
She is cute.

1118
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:43,570
It's the librarian fantasy, man.

1119
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:46,730
Glasses off, hair down.

1120
01:22:46,810 --> 01:22:48,770
Books flying.

1121
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:51,970
She doesn't wear glasses.

1122
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,410
Well, buy her some.
It's worth it.
