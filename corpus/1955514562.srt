00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:03,551
(calm presentation music)

2
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:14,171
(ominous music)

3
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:58,487
Nice house.

4
00:02:58,488 --> 00:02:59,405
You own it?

5
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:02,100
The bank owns it.

6
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:17,775
Is Oscar home yet?

7
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:19,386
No.

8
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:20,720
Still at school.

9
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:24,896
Let me know when he gets back.

10
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:31,195
(ominous music)

11
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,733
Hey, mom.

12
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:49,933
Rob, Oscar's home.

13
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:51,381
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

14
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,243
How was school?

15
00:03:52,244 --> 00:03:54,781
Awesome, I got a B plus today
on my test.

16
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:56,372
Excellent.

17
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:57,973
Can I go play video-games?

18
00:03:57,974 --> 00:03:59,301
- I don't see why not.
- Cool.

19
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:01,923
Hey, can you just do me a favor and

20
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:03,452
make sure you change out
of your school clothes?

21
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,286
Sure.

22
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,651
Slow down young man.

23
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:15,960
I had the right of way.

24
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:18,051
Oh, it's your world, huh?

25
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:20,719
(ominous music)

26
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:32,259
(electricity buzzing)

27
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,200
(coughing)

28
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:41,794
Help me!

29
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:44,391
Are you okay?

30
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:51,065
Is he okay?

31
00:04:57,121 --> 00:05:00,121
(suspenseful music)

32
00:05:01,315 --> 00:05:02,424
Oh God.

33
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:04,883
Oscar, can you help me
with this, sweetie?

34
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:05,884
Sure, mom.

35
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:15,784
(car revving)

36
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:19,097
Oh my God.

37
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:20,141
- Did you run him over?
- Oscar.

38
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:21,941
Are you okay, sweetie?

39
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:23,461
Oh my God, I don't know what happened.

40
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:25,781
The brake must have slipped.

41
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:28,699
Thank God, I got in the car in time.

42
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:53,950
Okay, so I'll see you tonight?

43
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,520
You know you shouldn't skip
the rest of the practice.

44
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:59,381
I have some things I have to do.

45
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:00,611
All right.

46
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:02,251
I'll see you tonight.

47
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:03,585
Okay, see you.

48
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:07,453
(suspenseful music)

49
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:30,893
(ominous music)

50
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:58,506
(glass breaking)

51
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:08,592
(ominous music)

52
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:33,943
[Mom] What a nice surprise!

53
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:34,776
[Rob] Thanks, Oscar.

54
00:08:34,777 --> 00:08:36,719
Geez, I didn't know
you knew how to cook.

55
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,553
My dad taught me before he died.

56
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:46,081
Hey, there's something I think
we need to talk about.

57
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:52,303
Sure thing, sweetie, what's going on?

58
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:54,283
(coughing)

59
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,117
Stop drinking so fast.

60
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,063
[Rob] Thank you.

61
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:04,563
I might have made
the coffee a little hot.

62
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:06,513
This is good, sweetie, what's in it?

63
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:08,944
Eggs spread in syrup.

64
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:10,695
Wait, what is this?

65
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:14,944
Powdered sugar.

66
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:17,195
(coughing)

67
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:21,973
Oh my God.

68
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:25,688
(coughing intensifies)

69
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,306
Oscar?

70
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:28,140
Oscar!

71
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,052
Help!

72
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:34,546
Oscar!

73
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:36,797
(coughing)

74
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:45,011
What'd you do?

75
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:49,349
(coughing)

76
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,657
(ominous music)

77
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,669
(snake rattling)

78
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,087
(gun firing)

79
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:23,898
What do you want me to do with it, boss?

80
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,930
Put it in the bag.

81
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:28,098
(panting)

82
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,836
(gun firing)

83
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:41,059
[Boy's Voice] Dear Vincent.

84
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,608
I've been waiting to see
you for such a long time.

85
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:46,609
I'm up for a parole soon

86
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:51,279
and I think I have a good chance.

87
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,219
I like you, I've taken
a liking to science

88
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,040
but I also have developed
a love of writing.

89
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,039
I hope to see you soon.

90
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Love, Oscar.

91
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,029
(suspenseful music)

92
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,989
(chainsaw revving)

93
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:15,444
(upbeat music)

94
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:26,510
Hey, Vincent.

95
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:28,531
This was mailed to
the school care of you.

96
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:31,710
Looks like it's been in
circulation for a while.

97
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,379
It's probably my brother Oscar.

98
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,132
Trying to cheese me
from getting the job.

99
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,940
I didn't know you had a brother.

100
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:40,420
Long story.

101
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:44,171
I'll see you at
the awards banquet tonight.

102
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:48,479
(crowd applauding)

103
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:53,460
It's been a pleasure for me and you guys

104
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:55,250
should really be proud of your kids.

105
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,190
They worked really hard.

106
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:58,930
It's a pleasure to teach them today,

107
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:02,001
it was so hard, and it's just
been a great experience.

108
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:04,012
So, anyway without further ado,

109
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:07,180
let's give out the warm welcome
waiting for them, all right?

110
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,848
The Most Valued Scientist award.

111
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:16,332
This year the award is going
to go to Miss Katie Anderson!

112
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,083
(crowd cheering)

113
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:36,851
Thank you all so much.

114
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:39,971
This team has really given me something

115
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:42,012
to look forward to this year,

116
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,550
and God, I can't speak for everyone.

117
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,377
But getting out of bed in the morning

118
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,710
and going to high school
can be the worst

119
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,711
experience of your life.

120
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:55,001
But this team has made me see past that.

121
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:57,002
It's given me a purpose,

122
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:01,811
a reason to get up, so thanks.

123
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:04,562
(crowd cheering)

124
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:19,773
That's it.

125
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:20,650
Thank you guys so much for coming.

126
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:22,172
It's been a great night.

127
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,923
(crowd cheering)

128
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,535
Hey, congratulations.

129
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:28,368
With my success?

130
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:29,678
Yes, and I will talk to you tomorrow.

131
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,511
- Okay.
- Yeah.

132
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,512
Anyway, I need you to...

133
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:35,828
Congratulations.

134
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:37,108
Thank you so much.

135
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:39,367
Congratulations.

136
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:41,457
Well, kiddo, it's time to go home.

137
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,291
Can I stay just a little longer?

138
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,471
Sure.

139
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:47,497
Okay.

140
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:49,248
But who are you gonna ride home with?

141
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,416
I can give her a ride, Miss Anderson.

142
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,449
[Mrs. Anderson]
Are you sure, Mr. Burton?

143
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,457
[Vincent] No problem.

144
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,767
Well?

145
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:56,798
Bye.

146
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,299
Just drive safe.

147
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,658
Did you have fun up there?

148
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,492
Yeah.

149
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,231
Did you?

150
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:04,839
No, I was very nervous.

151
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,136
I hate speeches.

152
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:07,770
I was so nervous.

153
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:11,421
Your speech was a lot better than mine.

154
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:13,261
So why don't you just hang out and then

155
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:15,551
come to me before you leave,
I'll give you a ride.

156
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:16,999
- Okay.
- Right?

157
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,759
- Cool, thanks.
- You got it.

158
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,427
(ominous music)

159
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Well, this is the end of the road.

160
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,698
Thanks for everything.

161
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,116
You're welcome.

162
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,703
Katie.

163
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:47,869
I probably shouldn't tell you this,

164
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,856
but I'm gonna tell you anyway.

165
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:50,930
What?

166
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,829
You're beautiful.

167
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,663
Oh...

168
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:57,890
Thanks.

169
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,308
You're welcome.

170
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,357
Oh sorry.

171
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,377
(ominous music)

172
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:36,866
(calm music playing on the radio)

173
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:41,757
* Does it ever seem like living *

174
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:45,628
* Slowly someone's life *

175
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:48,962
* But the day you don't *

176
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,625
Hey, what's up?

177
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:53,925
Where were you?

178
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:56,879
That's right, you had your
science nerd thing tonight,

179
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,737
didn't you?

180
00:17:57,738 --> 00:18:00,737
I won Most Valuable Scientist award.

181
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:03,238
You won most valuable, what?

182
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:05,630
Oh God.

183
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:08,948
Just shut up, you're such a jerk.

184
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:10,836
I'm sorry, it's just I've never heard

185
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:12,188
of that award before.

186
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:14,668
Well you are an idiot.

187
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:17,348
So, are you gonna come over or what?

188
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:18,507
I don't know.

189
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:19,676
I could hardly move at practice,

190
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,567
I was so tired from last night.

191
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:22,916
Come on, pussy.

192
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:23,855
Shut it.

193
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,175
What are you, wet?

194
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:27,795
That sounds like
something a guy would say.

195
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,356
Well, are you coming over or not?

196
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,825
Do I have to call someone else?

197
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:34,607
Yeah, no I'll see you at midnight.

198
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:37,025
(rock music)

199
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:49,949
(chair falling over)

200
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:54,567
Shh!

201
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:56,108
What?

202
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,192
My parents.

203
00:18:58,928 --> 00:18:59,761
So?

204
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:04,266
I thought you stood me
up 'cause I'm some kind

205
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:05,887
of a brain now.

206
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:07,497
The only change I notice is your tits

207
00:19:07,498 --> 00:19:09,998
got a little bigger this year.

208
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:14,687
Wait hold on.

209
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:15,559
Come here.

210
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,497
Just slow down.

211
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:17,767
Katie.

212
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:18,600
Come here.

213
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:19,433
Stop!

214
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:21,133
(groaning)

215
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:22,384
What's wrong?

216
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:24,693
But, I mean,

217
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:29,165
when are we gonna get serious?

218
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,424
I've been fucking you for two years now,

219
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:33,225
you keep asking me the same question.

220
00:19:33,226 --> 00:19:36,367
I know but only on the deal though.

221
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:37,927
What's up with that?

222
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:38,760
So what?

223
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,874
I like to keep
my private life to myself.

224
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,645
We both know you don't
keep anything to yourself.

225
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:46,563
Good night.

226
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:50,936
Yeah, fuck this.

227
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:52,677
Don't, big boy.

228
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:55,005
Are you fucking with me?

229
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:55,839
Not yet.

230
00:20:12,516 --> 00:20:15,183
(ominous music)

231
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:31,394
* I don't know what you want *

232
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:36,862
* I don't know what I'm thinking of *

233
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,701
(phone ringing)

234
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:55,193
* If you're thinking of who I am *

235
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:59,223
* This evening you don't have a clue *

236
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,214
(phone ringing)

237
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:03,047
Hello?

238
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:04,073
What's up?

239
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:05,633
Nothing.

240
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:07,231
Can you come get me?

241
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,523
I'm still in bed.

242
00:21:09,524 --> 00:21:12,323
Well, I mean not now but like later.

243
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:13,157
Maybe.

244
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:16,943
What's in it for me?

245
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:20,395
Come on.

246
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:21,228
Nothing.

247
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:24,345
Tell me a dirty little secret.

248
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:25,346
Let's see.

249
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay.

250
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:31,846
I did it with Carl.

251
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:32,694
Again?

252
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:33,528
Big whop.

253
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:36,558
Give me the detail.

254
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,017
I thought of Mr. Burton.

255
00:21:39,018 --> 00:21:40,851
You really are sick.

256
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,177
I'll be there at one.

257
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,276
And don't get your panties on a bunch

258
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:46,158
if I'm a little late.

259
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,992
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

260
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:54,387
I'm seeing Carl.

261
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:57,747
You're what?

262
00:21:57,748 --> 00:22:00,857
I know, Katie's gonna
be really mad at me.

263
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:04,198
You have to tell her right away.

264
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,686
I can't.

265
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:08,077
If you don't I will.

266
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:11,078
(upbeat rock music)

267
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,938
All right, let's go back
to chapter four.

268
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,939
(upbeat rock music)

269
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,870
* Come on ladies let's dance *

270
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:39,218
* Come on ladies why don't
you take off your pants *

271
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,280
* Come on ladies let's dance *

272
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:49,756
* Come on ladies why don't
you take off your pants *

273
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:52,919
* Sometimes it's like a hard on look *

274
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,090
* Take a lesson chance
with me riding someone *

275
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:58,946
* Maybe the risk isn't worth a lot *

276
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:01,266
(class bell ringing)

277
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:03,237
* And the captain stops my hand *

278
00:23:03,238 --> 00:23:05,127
* He's always telling me *

279
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:06,836
* Telling me how stupid I am *

280
00:23:06,837 --> 00:23:10,666
* I always hated the cops anyway *

281
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,047
* So I just *

282
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:14,465
(rock music)

283
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:32,886
Cute hair.

284
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:41,634
(sobbing)

285
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:42,968
What's going on?

286
00:23:43,995 --> 00:23:44,914
What's wrong?

287
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:49,394
I accidentally told everyone
you're fucking Amy and Carl.

288
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:50,775
Are you serious?

289
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:52,815
No I'm fucking with you.

290
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:54,885
Goddamnit, Kathy.

291
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:56,094
Can't believe I fell for that shit.

292
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:58,415
You are such trailer trash.

293
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,301
Yeah, well at least I haven't fucked

294
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:03,135
everyone in the trailer park,
you stupid slut.

295
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,067
(ominous music)

296
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,827
* Money comes happy and
it should lead the way *

297
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,248
* Happiness it always
should lead the way *

298
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:39,499
* My situations on now *

299
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,179
* Now that I'm gone
thing's gonna change *

300
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,238
* In a second now *

301
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:50,807
* I don't know where *

302
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:51,641
No shit.

303
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:56,576
(class bell ringing)

304
00:24:56,577 --> 00:25:00,744
All right, so everybody's here
which is awesome.

305
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:04,837
So this week we are
going to be talking frog.

306
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,405
(class giggling)

307
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:10,118
So, tell me, I guess you speak frog?

308
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,719
So anyway if you notice
there's frogs in front of you.

309
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,497
We are going to be
doing some dissecting.

310
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:18,519
Does anybody want to guess

311
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,567
what the largest internal
organ is in a frog?

312
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:22,797
Merideth?

313
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:25,228
The largest internal organ
in a frog is their liver.

314
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:26,062
Correct.

315
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,966
All right let me peel back
the skin and muscle tissue

316
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,615
and pin it to the cork board.

317
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:45,598
(class bell ringing)

318
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,207
Get off your gloves.

319
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,337
Thank you, Tommy.

320
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,516
Put it in the garbage can.

321
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:53,600
(indistinct chatter)

322
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,847
Well that was a good lesson.

323
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,667
Yeah, it was a lot of fun, huh?

324
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:04,030
Hey, congratulations on the award.

325
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:05,598
Thank you, it was nothing.

326
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,431
Oh.

327
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,357
State Science Teacher
of the Year is nothing?

328
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,534
Come on, Vincent.

329
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:10,417
It must feel pretty good.

330
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:12,926
Well, maybe a little bit.

331
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:14,236
I'm gonna have an assembly
so the whole school

332
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:15,404
can celebrate.

333
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:17,796
By Katie.

334
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:18,630
Bye.

335
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:21,475
Let's do it.

336
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,020
Thank you so much.

337
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:30,853
Thursday.

338
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:32,271
Thursday works.

339
00:26:34,397 --> 00:26:37,277
(phone ringing)

340
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:38,110
Hello?

341
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:39,397
Hey, Marge, it's me.

342
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:40,337
[Marge] Hi, Hon.

343
00:26:40,338 --> 00:26:42,417
I just wanna let you know
I'm running a little late.

344
00:26:42,418 --> 00:26:43,875
What's going on?

345
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:46,046
We have installed a new
computer system today.

346
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:47,907
It's gonna help us track down fugitives,

347
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:50,267
but she's gotta give me a rundown.

348
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:51,777
Can't it wait until tomorrow?

349
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,395
Come on, honey, I'll cook.

350
00:26:53,396 --> 00:26:54,486
What are you gonna make?

351
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,715
How does steak tartar sound?

352
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:57,697
Raw?

353
00:26:57,698 --> 00:26:58,806
All right, I'm gonna stop
by the butcher shop

354
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:00,025
on the way home.

355
00:27:00,026 --> 00:27:01,443
All right, bye.

356
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:07,466
All right.

357
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,860
I got some time.

358
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:14,564
Why don't you give me the rundown
on this internet thing?

359
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:18,334
It's a T1 internet connection actually.

360
00:27:18,335 --> 00:27:19,884
How's that different from before?

361
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:21,965
We had a dial up connection.

362
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:23,086
Oh yeah.

363
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:25,155
Now we get background checks faster

364
00:27:25,156 --> 00:27:27,094
and we can get on the paper site

365
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:29,845
and look up public records.

366
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:31,513
That's gonna help.

367
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:54,166
What's going on, Katie?

368
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:56,705
I don't know, you tell me.

369
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,132
What are you talking about?

370
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,174
The whole school is talking about it.

371
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:02,875
Jennifer Johnson is the whole school?

372
00:28:02,876 --> 00:28:04,315
Screw you.

373
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,395
You want to?

374
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:06,345
Right now?

375
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:08,331
You kept our relationship a secret

376
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:11,785
to try and get with my best friend.

377
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:12,619
I'm not.

378
00:28:15,316 --> 00:28:16,574
We're done.

379
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:19,575
(suspenseful music)

380
00:28:33,693 --> 00:28:34,610
Mr. Burton?

381
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,235
Yes, Katie?

382
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:41,115
[Katie] I wanna spend time
with you alone.

383
00:28:41,116 --> 00:28:43,235
I need to talk to you.

384
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:45,524
[Vincent] Well, okay.

385
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:48,377
My family owns a cabin
just outside of town.

386
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:49,637
I've been needing to get out there

387
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:50,926
and clean the place up,

388
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:51,798
make sure everything's all right.

389
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,777
Why don't you come and meet me there?

390
00:28:53,778 --> 00:28:54,926
We can talk.

391
00:28:54,927 --> 00:28:56,427
[Katie] I'd love to.

392
00:28:56,428 --> 00:28:57,281
[Vincent] Good.

393
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:00,865
Just take route three
out to Burton Meadow.

394
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:31,371
Hey, Liberty Base, I'm just
finishing up my patrol here.

395
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:35,370
I'm on the east fork
of Old Country Road.

396
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,552
[Woman On Radio] Over.

397
00:29:36,553 --> 00:29:39,220
(ominous music)

398
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:24,163
So you used to live here
when you were younger?

399
00:30:24,164 --> 00:30:27,232
Yeah, my father grew up in Liberty.

400
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:30,128
This was a family summer cabin.

401
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:30,962
Oh yeah?

402
00:30:33,673 --> 00:30:38,112
That must have been lonely
with no kids around.

403
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:40,362
Well there is my brother.

404
00:30:40,363 --> 00:30:41,863
What's his name?

405
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:44,502
Oscar.

406
00:30:49,484 --> 00:30:53,484
So would you ever wanna
have a family someday?

407
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:56,545
Well, do you mean kids?

408
00:30:57,993 --> 00:30:58,826
Yeah.

409
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:03,277
I don't know why you
wanted to ask me this, do I?

410
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,111
Yeah.

411
00:31:05,016 --> 00:31:05,849
Forget it.

412
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:12,529
Do you wanna show me your bedroom?

413
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:20,075
I got you, I got you.

414
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:26,979
(upbeat music)

415
00:31:30,225 --> 00:31:31,714
I don't wanna hurt you.

416
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:33,965
This isn't my first time.

417
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:37,606
(ominous music)

418
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:45,422
I'm ticklish.

419
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:54,199
(fire crackling)

420
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:08,365
Hey, the wind's picking up out here.

421
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:12,421
(ominous music)

422
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:23,721
(fire crackling)

423
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:36,634
(coughing)

424
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:50,274
Base, I'm gonna check out a fire,

425
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:52,503
the cabin on Burton Meadow.

426
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:55,445
It could just be a burn pile
but I'm at a weird angle here.

427
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,186
[Woman On Radio] Roger that.

428
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:59,687
(fire raging)

429
00:33:17,032 --> 00:33:19,365
(screaming)

430
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:24,242
(siren wailing)

431
00:34:06,904 --> 00:34:08,925
Is anybody else in the cabin?

432
00:34:08,926 --> 00:34:11,133
Vincent, is anybody else in the cabin?

433
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:11,967
No.

434
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:15,473
(ominous music)

435
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:48,725
Vincent?

436
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:50,685
I told John about you coming
over for dinner tonight.

437
00:34:50,686 --> 00:34:52,853
How's seven o'clock sound?

438
00:34:53,854 --> 00:34:54,954
Sounds great.

439
00:34:54,955 --> 00:34:56,994
John's in early patrol so he should be

440
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:58,995
home sometime after six?

441
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:03,057
Okay.

442
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:20,390
(indistinct chatter)

443
00:35:23,475 --> 00:35:26,058
(bell ringing)

444
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:35,726
I have individual points
more than anybody else

445
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:37,644
in the state right now.

446
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,977
(ominous music)

447
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:53,932
All right guys, stop the chatter.

448
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:56,511
Let's start off where we left last week

449
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:58,345
about internal organs.

450
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:00,842
Tommy?

451
00:36:00,843 --> 00:36:02,111
How about stop making out?

452
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:04,271
How about stop talking, all right?

453
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:05,578
I know you guys probably much rather

454
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,252
talk about external organs, all right?

455
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:11,253
These are frogs we're talking about.

456
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:16,700
So not that's any of my business but

457
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:17,621
do you have any idea how this

458
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:20,922
cabin fire could have started?

459
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:23,590
(phone ringing)

460
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:26,731
Hello?

461
00:36:26,732 --> 00:36:28,311
Oh hi, Deb.

462
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:30,562
So, Vincent, I'm curious.

463
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,451
You want these people
that's a vegetarian

464
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:36,271
'cause you wanna eat a healthier diet,

465
00:36:36,272 --> 00:36:39,551
or does it have some sort
of moral conviction?

466
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,469
It's a good question.

467
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:43,165
Both.

468
00:36:44,342 --> 00:36:46,141
You ever been hunting?

469
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:47,410
My God.

470
00:36:47,411 --> 00:36:51,442
You sure she's not in
one of her friend's?

471
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,275
I will.

472
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:55,841
I will tell him right now of course.

473
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:56,675
All right.

474
00:36:58,472 --> 00:36:59,805
Good night, Deb.

475
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:06,345
(sighs)

476
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:11,103
That was Debbie Anderson, Katie's mom.

477
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,563
Apparently Katie's went to
Jennifer Johnson's house

478
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,992
last night and then she didn't come home

479
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:17,283
after school today.

480
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:18,752
Now Debbie's absolutely terrified

481
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:21,483
that something's happened
to her daughter.

482
00:37:21,484 --> 00:37:24,192
Remember that call I got about
two months ago?

483
00:37:24,193 --> 00:37:28,040
Neighbor said someone was
screaming out at night.

484
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:29,560
I drove all the way out there.

485
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:31,640
It was the Johnson's TV
turned up too loud

486
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:33,912
'cause Kathy was passed out
on the remote.

487
00:37:33,913 --> 00:37:35,731
I guess it was a night off.

488
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:39,391
Was Jennifer in class today, Vincent?

489
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:40,931
Yeah, Jennifer was in class.

490
00:37:40,932 --> 00:37:43,051
So I'm gonna have to go
talk to the Andersons

491
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,392
before it gets too late.

492
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:47,112
You know, John, I could
compile a list of students

493
00:37:47,113 --> 00:37:49,083
you might wanna talk to,

494
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:53,712
you know, just in case
they know anything about Katie.

495
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:55,702
Yeah, that'd be great, Vincent.

496
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:57,533
I'll come by and talk
to you in the morning.

497
00:37:57,534 --> 00:38:00,832
Drive careful and I'll save
you some dessert.

498
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:01,814
Is there meat in it?

499
00:38:01,815 --> 00:38:03,062
No.

500
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:05,462
Then don't bother.

501
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:06,934
And I didn't forget about
your cabin, Vincent.

502
00:38:06,935 --> 00:38:07,912
I'll come by tomorrow afternoon.

503
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:09,243
I'll take you up there if you want,

504
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:10,542
see if there's anything you can salvage.

505
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:11,543
All right.

506
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:15,643
- Good night.
- Good night, babe.

507
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,970
(ominous music)

508
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,740
Hey.

509
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:43,000
You Jennifer Johnson?

510
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:43,918
Yes, sir.

511
00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:47,361
You wanna get in the car?

512
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:02,300
Katie Anderson stay at
your house last night?

513
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:05,301
Yeah, I mean, it's my dad's house.

514
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:08,361
You know where she is?

515
00:39:09,342 --> 00:39:12,302
No, she was gone when I woke up.

516
00:39:12,303 --> 00:39:14,470
You know where she went?

517
00:39:15,863 --> 00:39:19,091
I thought she was with Carl Pierce.

518
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:20,092
All right.

519
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:22,529
That's all.

520
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:34,451
Where were you, Jenny?

521
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:36,452
I was worried about you.

522
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,625
What's her name?

523
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,764
Your slutty friend.

524
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:48,304
Katie.

525
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,972
(ominous music)

526
00:39:53,964 --> 00:39:57,131
Her mother called, she can't find her.

527
00:40:00,255 --> 00:40:02,374
I'll let you go pass out,

528
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:04,814
puke all over yourself again.

529
00:40:04,815 --> 00:40:05,982
Fucking witch.

530
00:40:07,244 --> 00:40:09,494
(giggling)

531
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:38,130
(phone ringing)

532
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:40,862
Hey, what's going on?

533
00:40:40,863 --> 00:40:42,823
Hanging out with Carl.

534
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:43,672
What's up with Katie?

535
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:45,352
She really sucker something at.

536
00:40:45,353 --> 00:40:48,163
I mean I heard she spent the night
at your house last night.

537
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:50,544
Yeah, I mean we just like
watched movies and stuff.

538
00:40:50,545 --> 00:40:52,963
I heard this rumor that Katie's

539
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:55,513
seeing this way older guy.

540
00:40:55,514 --> 00:40:58,154
And the only person
that she told was you.

541
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,213
Who told you that?

542
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:00,453
Am I wrong?

543
00:41:00,454 --> 00:41:02,064
She was seeing someone.

544
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:04,314
But she swore me to secrecy.

545
00:41:04,315 --> 00:41:05,722
Come on, baby.

546
00:41:05,723 --> 00:41:07,456
You can tell me.

547
00:41:07,457 --> 00:41:09,416
Didn't we swear not to tell secrets?

548
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:12,445
I swear to God, Jennifer.

549
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:15,306
Okay, but you can't
tell another living soul.

550
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,307
Come on, just tell me.

551
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,239
Jen?

552
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:27,352
I think she freaking hung up on me.

553
00:41:27,353 --> 00:41:29,665
The service out here sucks.

554
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:32,333
(ominous music)

555
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,946
Great work on the dissection, guys.

556
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,165
Everybody who participated passed.

557
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,565
Just goes to show you
how far willing participation

558
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:02,733
will take you.

559
00:42:04,227 --> 00:42:07,194
(bell ringing)

560
00:42:07,195 --> 00:42:09,862
Wait, I need to take attendance.

561
00:42:25,987 --> 00:42:28,654
Well, as I'm sure you're aware

562
00:42:29,526 --> 00:42:32,565
Katie Anderson's still missing.

563
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:36,666
Spoke to the parents last night,
they're not doing so well.

564
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:38,456
Debbie Anderson's a complete wreck.

565
00:42:38,457 --> 00:42:42,314
She's already convinced her
daughter's been kidnapped.

566
00:42:42,315 --> 00:42:44,136
And Marge reminded me
I'm supposed to come down

567
00:42:44,137 --> 00:42:46,428
and pick you up to take you
up to see your cabin today.

568
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:48,258
I remember what you said
about compiling a list

569
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:50,570
of Katie Anderson's friends.

570
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:54,868
I figured I'd get me two
birds with one stone.

571
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:57,619
I went to the cabin last night.

572
00:42:59,851 --> 00:43:03,490
It's a strange thing, I don't
remember any of it at all.

573
00:43:03,491 --> 00:43:05,450
You're pretty out
when I dragged you away.

574
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:06,284
Yeah.

575
00:43:07,979 --> 00:43:10,168
But I don't remember any of it.

576
00:43:10,169 --> 00:43:12,002
It's just total blank.

577
00:43:14,976 --> 00:43:17,809
Could be smoke inhalation.

578
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,560
Maybe come back to you
when you see daylight.

579
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:24,929
Let's go take a look.

580
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,178
What do you know about Katie Anderson?

581
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:40,965
Well the first one's
our real connection.

582
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:43,049
You know, she's charming.

583
00:43:43,918 --> 00:43:46,147
Good student, all around
great kid really.

584
00:43:46,148 --> 00:43:49,773
Word on the street, as they say,

585
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:51,112
is that Katie's known around school

586
00:43:51,113 --> 00:43:53,392
as one of the big party
animals in senior class.

587
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:55,022
Yeah, I've heard all those
rumors you're talking about.

588
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,112
I happen to know that they're not true.

589
00:43:57,113 --> 00:43:59,192
In fact I could put you in contact

590
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:00,613
with her ex-boyfriend who's responsible

591
00:44:00,614 --> 00:44:01,693
for spreading those lies.

592
00:44:01,694 --> 00:44:02,872
Who's that?

593
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,923
[Vincent]
Carl Pierce, a senior class jock.

594
00:44:05,924 --> 00:44:10,072
He's had a crush on Katie since
they were in the 8th grade.

595
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:12,740
(ominous music)

596
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:48,323
Looks like it was a pretty nice bike.

597
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:51,772
I don't recognize it.

598
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:52,940
What's that?

599
00:44:54,673 --> 00:44:56,090
I guess it was.

600
00:44:59,573 --> 00:45:03,332
You never did answer
my question last night.

601
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,192
I asked you if you ever gone hunting.

602
00:45:06,193 --> 00:45:07,813
No.

603
00:45:07,814 --> 00:45:09,231
I'm not a hunter.

604
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:15,253
[Woman On Radio]
We have a report of a homicide

605
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,675
in the town limits.

606
00:45:16,676 --> 00:45:20,443
You must report to
13 Johnson Road, immediately.

607
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:23,111

608
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:31,864
Liberty One, I'm on my way, over.

609
00:45:31,865 --> 00:45:33,473
Homicide I gotta go back in.

610
00:45:33,474 --> 00:45:34,824
I'm gonna stay here and
look through the rubble

611
00:45:34,825 --> 00:45:36,301
to see if I can find something else.

612
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:37,681
Didn't you come here last night?

613
00:45:37,682 --> 00:45:41,099
It's too dark, I couldn't see anything.

614
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:47,573
This will help you dig.

615
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:48,595
I'll come back in a few hours.

616
00:45:48,596 --> 00:45:51,645
If I can double back myself
I'll send somebody else.

Oh my God!

You have to help my sister.

623
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,934
You have to help my sister.

624
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:19,224
Calm down, calm down.

625
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:22,142

What do you mean she's okay?

Get away from me!

Oh my God.

632
00:47:36,077 --> 00:47:37,996
Bullshit, officer.

633

Nobody tells me nothin'.

634
00:47:41,397 --> 00:47:42,814

This place is a mess.

This is Liberty One.

641
00:48:05,438 --> 00:48:09,605
I need forensics and a body bag
out on Johnson Road.

642
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,672
[Woman On Radio] Copy that.

643
00:48:11,673 --> 00:48:14,249
What's the situation?

644
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,329
I've never seen anything like it.

645
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:18,769
It's a goddamn bloody mess in there.

646
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,929
Could you also send my wife
to pick up Vincent

647
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:23,887
at the Burton Cabin?

648
00:48:23,888 --> 00:48:27,129
I hate to do it but
this is gonna take all day.

649
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,011
She'll love you for it.

00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,277

Yeah.

I don't know, I just passed out.

658

No bumps or scratches?

No.

Carl Pierce, Principal's Office please.

664
00:53:46,273 --> 00:53:48,856
Carl Pierce, the office please.

665
00:53:53,162 --> 00:53:55,412
I wonder what he did now.

666
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:01,535
What did I do?

667
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:05,872
I didn't say that
you did anything, Carl.

668
00:54:05,873 --> 00:54:07,956
I just wanna talk to you.

669
00:54:20,002 --> 00:54:23,002
Well, where were you two nights ago?

670
00:54:26,253 --> 00:54:31,153
I was making home movies
with my girlfriend, Sheriff.

671
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:33,040
Your ex-girlfriend's
been missing for three days

672
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,761
and she's been presumed dead.

673
00:54:34,762 --> 00:54:36,303
And as you probably know her best friend

674
00:54:36,304 --> 00:54:37,793
was just found stabbed to death

675
00:54:37,794 --> 00:54:40,812
in her own bedroom two nights ago.

676
00:54:40,813 --> 00:54:44,723
So those would be some
pretty sick movies, Carl.

677
00:54:44,724 --> 00:54:48,141
Now, 7:45 two nights ago,
where were you?

678
00:54:49,116 --> 00:54:53,323
Night practice, season starts
in two weeks.

679
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:55,043

680
00:54:55,044 --> 00:54:56,063
Yes.

00:54:56,064 --> 00:54:57,147
Yes, officer.

00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:02,012
Well it was really nice
talking to you, Carl.

00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,602
Pretty good, how's it going?

686
00:55:10,603 --> 00:55:13,154
I just got one question for you.

687
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:16,034
Was Carl Pierce at night
practice two nights ago?

688
00:55:16,035 --> 00:55:17,202
Yes, he was.

689
00:55:19,523 --> 00:55:21,852
All right, coach, that's all, thanks.

690
00:55:21,853 --> 00:55:23,311
It's not him.

691
00:55:23,312 --> 00:55:24,821
I mean, he's got a problem
with authority,

692
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,532
but his alibi's clean.

693
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:28,343

694
00:55:28,344 --> 00:55:30,261

695
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:33,091
Look, there was no blood

696
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:34,823
on the inside of the coat pocket.

697
00:55:34,824 --> 00:55:36,492
It was only the cellphone.

698
00:55:36,493 --> 00:55:38,452
That means that the blood
on the phone was dry

699
00:55:38,453 --> 00:55:40,021
when it was placed in Carl's pocket.

700
00:55:40,022 --> 00:55:41,482
Placed?

701
00:55:41,483 --> 00:55:42,423
It's gotta be a setup.

702
00:55:42,424 --> 00:55:43,482
That's the only thing
that's making any sense

703
00:55:43,483 --> 00:55:44,452
to me at this point.

704
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:47,106
Unless Carl gave his locker
combination to somebody.

00:55:47,107 --> 00:55:48,863
The only way that someone can get in

is through the secured
files in my office.

have keys to the school.

she had a new boyfriend.

So, did she give you
any useful information?

739
00:58:11,122 --> 00:58:12,372
She was as useful as she can be

740
00:58:12,373 --> 00:58:14,081
under the circumstances.

741
00:58:14,082 --> 00:58:15,492
It's not everyday
a teenage girl finds out

742
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:17,982
her two best friends have been murdered.

743
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:21,502
I thought Katie was just missing?

744
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:23,972
Her parents called
last night devastated.

745
00:58:23,973 --> 00:58:25,852
They said they notice that
her bike had been missing.

746
00:58:25,853 --> 00:58:27,853
It's been over two days.

747
00:58:28,773 --> 00:58:32,690
They think she might have
been hit or abducted.

748
00:58:34,422 --> 00:58:36,190
I gotta be going, I'm sorry.

749
00:58:36,191 --> 00:58:39,024
But I think it'll work itself out.

750
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:42,959
Vincent, you forgot your...

751
00:58:44,933 --> 00:58:45,933
Your papers.

752
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:53,222
Excuse me.

753
00:58:53,223 --> 00:58:55,890
(ominous music)

754
00:59:22,951 --> 00:59:24,368
Amy, over here!

755
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:28,263
Hey.

756
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:29,097
Hey.

757
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:32,782
How's that practice, huh?

758
00:59:32,783 --> 00:59:34,550
Let me give you a ride home.

759
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:37,012
I was just gonna call my mom.

760
00:59:37,013 --> 00:59:40,430
You'll be fine, let me give you a ride.

761
00:59:42,853 --> 00:59:44,172
Okay.

762
00:59:44,173 --> 00:59:46,673
(car revving)

763
00:59:50,581 --> 00:59:53,248
(ominous music)

764
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,144
(screaming)

765
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:14,535
What are you doing?

766
01:00:17,842 --> 01:00:21,259
You know, I can walk
the rest of the way.

767
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:27,469
I wanna ask you something, Amy.

768
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:30,220
Do you know who Katie was seeing?

769
01:00:32,973 --> 01:00:33,806
No.

770
01:00:36,072 --> 01:00:38,489
No idea who she was seeing?

771
01:00:40,082 --> 01:00:41,951
I don't know.

772
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:42,785
Sorry.

773
01:00:47,014 --> 01:00:48,681
Why are you sorry?

774
01:00:50,865 --> 01:00:53,615
It's just a question, that's all.

775
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:20,802
I thought I was giving you a ride home?

776
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:24,222
Yeah, well, Vincent said he didn't mind.

777
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:25,055
Who?

778
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,430
My science teacher.

779
01:01:26,431 --> 01:01:29,544
Since when do you call your
teachers by their first names.

780
01:01:29,545 --> 01:01:31,864
Since he's someone that's
actually there for me.

781
01:01:31,865 --> 01:01:34,302
I want you to come inside
and not leave this house

782
01:01:34,303 --> 01:01:36,402
until the cops have
all this figured out.

783
01:01:36,403 --> 01:01:37,573
But I mean I can't even...

784
01:01:37,574 --> 01:01:39,661
You heard your mom.

785
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:40,912
Dad?

786
01:01:40,913 --> 01:01:43,913
Your mom's already started dinner.

787
01:01:54,763 --> 01:01:58,930
Thank you for giving my daughter
a ride home, Mr. Burton.

788
01:02:38,734 --> 01:02:39,613
Prints come back?

789
01:02:39,614 --> 01:02:43,197
We should get something
back by tomorrow.

790
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:30,522
(gasping)

791
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:52,932
(sobbing)

792
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:04,439
Where the fuck am I?

793
01:04:05,315 --> 01:04:07,648
This is the make out spot.

794
01:04:09,816 --> 01:04:11,095
Don't you remember how many times

795
01:04:11,096 --> 01:04:12,903
you took Katie here?

796
01:04:12,904 --> 01:04:15,321
What are you gonna do, man?

797
01:04:21,651 --> 01:04:22,484
Please.

798
01:04:23,846 --> 01:04:25,444
Please, don't hurt me.

799
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:26,278
Shh!

800
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:29,594
I'm not gonna hurt you, Carl.

801
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:30,485
I don't wanna die.

802
01:04:30,486 --> 01:04:33,534
I just need you to
fill out some paperwork.

803
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,535
Don't worry.

804
01:04:35,886 --> 01:04:37,735
I've got a pen.

805
01:04:37,736 --> 01:04:40,069
(screaming)

806
01:04:41,955 --> 01:04:45,288
Now I want you to listen very carefully.

807
01:04:47,136 --> 01:04:49,954
I would hate to do the other leg

808
01:04:49,955 --> 01:04:53,955
knowing how important
football is to you, sport.

809
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:58,032
I need you to fill out a little report

810
01:04:58,033 --> 01:04:59,616
and sign your name.

811
01:05:03,113 --> 01:05:06,581
You can do that, can't you, Carl?

812
01:05:06,582 --> 01:05:07,832
I know you can.

813
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:11,930
And do you know how I'm sure?

814
01:05:11,931 --> 01:05:14,050
Because I've got Katie's dead body

815
01:05:14,051 --> 01:05:16,468
with your baby inside of her.

816
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:22,751
Now you're gonna write
down every last word.

817
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,502
Put your hands out, get this pen.

818
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,101
Or it'll be your last breath.

819
01:05:29,102 --> 01:05:30,162
Here, let me help you out.

820
01:05:30,163 --> 01:05:31,830
Let me help you out.

821
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,860
Now start writing.

822
01:05:40,008 --> 01:05:42,675
(car exploding)

823
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:46,323
(screaming)

824
01:05:49,828 --> 01:05:52,495
(ominous music)

825
01:06:12,105 --> 01:06:15,022
(knocking on door)

826
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:26,167
(knocking on door)

827
01:06:26,168 --> 01:06:27,216
Oh, hey Vincent.

828
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:29,567
- Hey, Marge.
- Hey.

829
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:30,401
You okay?

830
01:06:32,668 --> 01:06:33,918
Carl confessed.

831
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:36,518
Carl confessed?

832
01:06:36,519 --> 01:06:39,519
He pushed this note under my door.

833
01:06:47,826 --> 01:06:48,659
Rocky.

834
01:06:50,248 --> 01:06:51,385
Rocky, you in there?

835
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:52,219
Open up.

836
01:06:54,146 --> 01:06:56,714
Whoa, awful jumpy for a cop,
aren't you Sheriff?

837
01:06:56,715 --> 01:06:58,365
Dammit, Rocky.

838
01:06:58,366 --> 01:06:59,916
Almost got yourself shot.

839
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:01,097
(laughs)

840
01:07:01,098 --> 01:07:02,356
(phone ringing)

841
01:07:02,357 --> 01:07:03,190
Hold on.

842
01:07:05,698 --> 01:07:07,281
Hi, hon, it's me.

843
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:11,457
Yeah, Vincent just brought me
a confession note,

844
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:12,708
signed by Carl.

845
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:15,697
How'd you get a confession?

846
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,096
Slid under his door.

847
01:07:17,097 --> 01:07:17,929
All right, just keep him there.

848
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:19,235
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

849
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:21,486
- I will.
- All right, bye.

850
01:07:27,315 --> 01:07:28,845
He wants you to
stick around for a minute

851
01:07:28,846 --> 01:07:31,894
since you found
the confession, all right?

852
01:07:31,895 --> 01:07:33,145
- Sure.
- Yeah.

853
01:07:34,107 --> 01:07:35,336
Hey, why don't you just sit here

854
01:07:35,337 --> 01:07:37,754
and I'll make us some coffee?

855
01:07:38,977 --> 01:07:40,665
Can I use your bathroom?

856
01:07:40,666 --> 01:07:41,499
Sure.

857
01:07:44,107 --> 01:07:45,505
Goddammit, Rocky.

858
01:07:45,506 --> 01:07:47,554
You mean to tell me this
didn't strike you as funny?

859
01:07:47,555 --> 01:07:49,474
There's an industrial drum of cycle oil,

860
01:07:49,475 --> 01:07:50,834
a bundle of shop towels,

861
01:07:50,835 --> 01:07:52,514
an eight ounce bottle of chloroform,

862
01:07:52,515 --> 01:07:55,432
hydrochloric acid and AA batteries?

863
01:07:57,235 --> 01:08:00,026
I guess everything
kind of strikes me funny.

864
01:08:00,027 --> 01:08:02,016
Do you even sell chloroform here?

865
01:08:02,017 --> 01:08:04,106
Special order.

866
01:08:04,107 --> 01:08:07,690
Well I need
the security tapes from 3:30.

867
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:12,502
(ominous music)

868
01:08:21,825 --> 01:08:24,908
It should be somewhere on this one.

869
01:08:27,465 --> 01:08:29,132
Freeze that frame.

870
01:08:31,685 --> 01:08:32,602
That's him.

871
01:08:33,795 --> 01:08:35,445
Emma, you found anything yet?

872
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:36,563
Got your print match.

873
01:08:36,564 --> 01:08:38,624
Oscar Dillasaw.

874
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:41,224
Former resident of Liberty
who sliced his parents,

875
01:08:41,225 --> 01:08:44,892
did 10 on a manslaughter
plea as a juvenile.

876
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,562
You scared me.

877
01:08:55,563 --> 01:08:58,230
(siren wailing)

878
01:09:16,433 --> 01:09:19,072
You just stay out of here!

879
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:21,740
(ominous music)

880
01:09:22,822 --> 01:09:25,155
(screaming)

881
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:38,292
(ominous music)

882
01:10:07,185 --> 01:10:09,018
You got that coffee?

883
01:10:11,171 --> 01:10:12,042
Shit!

884
01:10:12,043 --> 01:10:12,876
Marge!

885
01:10:25,251 --> 01:10:26,084
Marge!

886
01:10:28,902 --> 01:10:30,461
Marge!

887
01:10:30,462 --> 01:10:32,712
(gurgling)

888
01:10:41,211 --> 01:10:42,044
Baby?

889
01:10:43,401 --> 01:10:44,401
Amy Jones.

890
01:10:46,819 --> 01:10:48,098
Amy Jones.

891
01:10:48,099 --> 01:10:49,677
Hang on, baby, hang on.

892
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,138
Hang on, baby.

893
01:10:51,139 --> 01:10:51,972
Baby?

894
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:54,052
Come on.

895
01:10:57,102 --> 01:10:59,769
(ominous music)

896
01:11:33,763 --> 01:11:34,596
Hello?

897
01:11:37,534 --> 01:11:38,367
Amy?

898
01:11:46,273 --> 01:11:48,023
I'm gonna kill you!

899
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:50,706
Bastard!

900
01:11:57,654 --> 01:11:59,722
Oscar, why are you doing this?

901
01:11:59,723 --> 01:12:01,091
You tell me.

902
01:12:01,092 --> 01:12:02,389
You're sick.

903
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:04,213
I thought they locked you away?

904
01:12:04,214 --> 01:12:07,152
I patiently did my time.

905
01:12:07,153 --> 01:12:09,181
Why are you killing all these people?

906
01:12:09,182 --> 01:12:10,362
To protect you!

907
01:12:10,363 --> 01:12:11,195
From what?

908
01:12:11,196 --> 01:12:12,201
Yourself!

909
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:14,612
Do you know what they do to
men that fuck middle girls?

910
01:12:14,613 --> 01:12:16,101
They put them away.

911
01:12:16,102 --> 01:12:18,701
I killed anyone that could destroy you.

912
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:19,602
I'm gonna kill you.

913
01:12:19,603 --> 01:12:20,971
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

914
01:12:20,972 --> 01:12:23,222
(grunting)

915
01:12:44,813 --> 01:12:46,896
Freeze, drop the knife.

916
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:49,572
I had to kill him.

917
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:50,914
It's all over.

918
01:12:50,915 --> 01:12:52,592
He killed your wife.

919
01:12:52,593 --> 01:12:54,010
Drop the knife.

920
01:12:56,344 --> 01:12:57,402
He's behind you!

921
01:12:57,403 --> 01:12:59,820
(gun firing)

922
01:13:10,507 --> 01:13:13,174
(ominous music)

923
01:13:48,605 --> 01:13:51,022
(calm music)

924
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:07,250
* You didn't wake up
before you hit the ground *

925
01:14:10,115 --> 01:14:15,023
* And I didn't stay up long enough *

926
01:14:15,024 --> 01:14:17,831
* To see you falling *

927
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:21,999
* You never asked for
the world but then *

928
01:14:24,566 --> 01:14:28,263
* You jumped from the rooftop *

929
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:32,143
* 'Cause you had to
have the last laugh *

930
01:14:32,144 --> 01:14:35,674
* Look where you are *

931
01:14:35,675 --> 01:14:39,335
* Look where you are now *

932
01:14:39,336 --> 01:14:42,855
* Look where you are *

933
01:14:42,856 --> 01:14:45,689
* I heard you say *

934
01:14:46,896 --> 01:14:51,063
* Every day above ground
was a good one *

935
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:08,348
* You never see her *

936
01:15:08,349 --> 01:15:11,959
* Hair in braids and blue eyes *

937
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:16,660
* 'Cause we didn't try hard enough *

938
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:20,300
* She's still waiting to hear you sing *

939
01:15:20,301 --> 01:15:23,051
* A song for her *

940
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:30,249
* You jumped from the rooftop *

941
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:34,049
* She still asks me *

942
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:37,551
* Where are you now *

943
01:15:37,552 --> 01:15:41,071
* Where are you now *

944
01:15:41,072 --> 01:15:44,721
* Where are you now *

945
01:15:44,722 --> 01:15:47,555
* I heard you say *

946
01:15:48,402 --> 01:15:52,140
* Every day above ground *

947
01:15:52,141 --> 01:15:56,308
* Every day above ground
was a good one *

948
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:28,729
* When you fall back down *

949
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:32,521
* And you lost your crown *

950
01:16:32,522 --> 01:16:36,231
* Get back up, walk around *

951
01:16:36,232 --> 01:16:40,081
* Turn that frown upside down *

952
01:16:40,082 --> 01:16:44,081
* Take my hand once again *

953
01:16:44,082 --> 01:16:47,551
* We will all understand *

954
01:16:47,552 --> 01:16:51,135
* Help you find a new plan *

955
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:59,400
* It's time to help you *

956
01:16:59,401 --> 01:17:02,919
* Get you back on your feet *

957
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,753
* And on your way *

958
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,247
* If the tables were turned around *

959
01:17:14,133 --> 01:17:17,972
* I know you'd be there for me *

960
01:17:17,973 --> 01:17:21,352
* It all works out *

961
01:17:21,353 --> 01:17:24,992
* Don't get lost and forget *

962
01:17:24,993 --> 01:17:28,629
* Turn the lights off and rest *

963
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:32,489
* Don't you worry no more *

964
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:36,329
* Kill your pain and sores *

965
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:39,889
* We'll be there when you wake *

966
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:43,721
* No more sweat or the shakes *

967
01:17:43,722 --> 01:17:47,561
* Feel the love if you can *

968
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:51,395
* Lost your mind, feel insane *

969
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:59,379
* You're feeling hopeless *

970
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:03,547
* And all your dreams have gone away *

971
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:10,270
* Take the time *

972
01:18:10,271 --> 01:18:13,521
* To heal your sorrows *

973
01:18:14,362 --> 01:18:17,590
* Disappear from the world *

974
01:18:17,591 --> 01:18:20,591
* Live for tomorrow *

975
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,361
* Hope you changed your ways *

976
01:18:51,362 --> 01:18:55,041
* There's not much more to say *

977
01:18:55,042 --> 01:18:58,809
* When the dark turns to gray *

978
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:02,550
* Broken hearts fade away *

979
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:06,230
* La da da, da, da *

980
01:19:06,231 --> 01:19:09,961
* La da da, da, da *

981
01:19:09,962 --> 01:19:13,679
* La da da, da, da *

982
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,597
* La da da, da, da *

983
01:19:21,309 --> 01:19:24,642
* It's time to help you *

984
01:19:25,819 --> 01:19:29,127
* Get you back on your feet *

985
01:19:29,128 --> 01:19:31,961
* And on your way *

986
01:19:33,363 --> 01:19:37,530
* If the tables were turned around *

987
01:19:40,573 --> 01:19:43,991
* I know you'd be there for me *

988
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:46,909
* It all works out *

989
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:55,113
* And I hope *

990
01:19:55,114 --> 01:19:58,447
* That it all works out *

991
01:19:59,706 --> 01:20:02,554
* And I hope *

992
01:20:02,555 --> 01:20:06,404
* That it all works out *

993
01:20:06,405 --> 01:20:09,945
* And I hope that it all *

994
01:20:09,946 --> 01:20:13,806
* That it all works out *

995
01:20:13,807 --> 01:20:17,406
* That it all works out *

996
01:20:17,407 --> 01:20:21,333
* That it all works out *

997
01:20:21,334 --> 01:20:24,667
* That it all works out *
