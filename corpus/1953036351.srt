1
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,200
What are you looking at?

2
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,000
I am looking at bucket, thinking...

3
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,400
I like you.

4
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,400
I like you because I can
say what's on my mind.

5
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,700
What?

6
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,800
Why haven't you ever kiss me?

7
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,700
I am scare.

8
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,900
Scare that when...

9
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,200
When Tip ask me if I ever
kiss you, I'll have to say yeap.

10
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,000
That scares you?

11
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,600
Tip is my best friend.

12
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
I don't want to mess with that.

13
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,200
I don't want to be with somebody
who is scare to be with me.

14
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,400
Mostly, I don't want to be like,
like when I kiss other girl.

15
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Why don't you kiss me right there?

16
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
I don't have to be
like the other girls.

17
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,100
- Okay. Where?
- Right there.

18
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,700
Here.

19
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,100
...not to let it hurt you or anything.

20
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,600
Called the Butterfly Principle
which is basically a bird...

21
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,500
Flaps its wings and it cost a fall,

22
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Cause a chain reaction of a
painting to be made of the apple.

23
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,600
Somebody looks at the painting,

24
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,100
Forgets they got to pick
their mama at church and...

25
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,600
Runs the red light and get
for 80 bucks.

26
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,500
Now, all because the bird flaps its
wings which is 6 million miles away.

27
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,100
- Gotten into the car accident
- Yeah, crack its ass from the stairwell

28
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Are you kidding me?

29
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Snap his whole goddamn neck.

30
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,900
They say he is paralysed and
put him in wheelchair.

31
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,000
We never know anybody
in a wheelchair before.

32
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,300
That kid is a dumb ass.
He's not a good driver.

33
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,900
Hey, Mary Margaret.

34
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,100
Check her out, dude.

35
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,900
Look at that. On the street.

36
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,000
I like to hang out her for a few
afternoon, man and make some pizza...

37
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,600
That's gross.
That's gross.

38
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,500
You should pick it up and spin it.

39
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,200
The other way. The other way.
The other way.

40
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,300
Hurry up, so we can go eat.

41
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,200
You can tell stuff that is useful.

42
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,100
I am not Spanish.

43
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,200
I've been to school but
they're not supposed...

44
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,700
To know all the words
in the dictionary.

45
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,600
- You got a Spanish cousin?
- I know that...

46
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,300
A blondie girl is meatball soup,

47
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,200
- I don't think so.
- M.U.J.E.R.

48
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,200
- Think Seniorita is a woman.
- That's right.

49
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Tip, I saw that your sister
is back in town.

50
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,700
It's pretty cool.

51
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,600
She looks a lot different than
the last time I saw her, she...

52
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,600
- She's gotten older.
- Yeah, you're the same.

53
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Don't talk about his sister, man.

54
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,500
That was purely just wondering
what was happening.

55
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,900
He has more friends than his relatives,
I would care about if they...

56
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,700
I want something greasy.

57
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,900
- How is it going?
- Fine.

58
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,800
There is a pubic hair by the ashtray.

59
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,000
- Kind of gross.
- I am sorry.

60
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,900
- Got to clean that up.
- I can get Pat to clean up for you.

61
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,800
What do you get with a mouse fat?

62
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,000
With the mouse's fat?

63
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,100
- Bacon.
- Then bacon it is.

64
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,100
- What do you guys want?
- Some black coffee. Straight-up.

65
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,600
- I want medium with bacon.
- Okay.

66
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,400
I just want to get a hamburger.

67
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,400
And cheese.

68
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,900
- How do you know it was that one?
- I don't.

69
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,200
It's so dark in there. I don't even
know how you guys even make...

70
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,200
Why don't you drop some
mothballs in this tank?

71
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,600
You boys think you got all answers.

72
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,600
Don't do anything weird to my truck.

73
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,900
He's here.

74
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,000
What's up, Bo?

75
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,100
Nice ball.

76
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,800
Come on, we're going to bother somebody
- Bother who?

77
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,000
- A boy.
- How are you doing?

78
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,400
- You got a problem?
- Yeah. I do.

79
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,900
We'll take a look at it.

80
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,800
- What're you doing?
- I was dumping whatever in the bucket

81
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,500
Dumping the dirty water
out of this bucket.

82
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,300
How are you doing?

83
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,700
- That's a great shirt you got.
- Thanks.

84
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,600
Well, I got to go. My dad is
over there waiting for us.

85
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,300
Don't work too hard.

86
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,100
Okay. Take it easy, you guys.

87
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,900
I will see you later.

88
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,400
I want you to do what you
say you're going to do.

89
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,700
- Can I have by 4:00 this afternoon?
- Absolutely.

90
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,500
Geoff, you bringing this
cart in here again?

91
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,500
What was that all about?

92
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,400
I told you're my number
one best friend.

93
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,100
- Good for you.
- Something smells.

94
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,800
You find my cutter?

95
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,000
Your tools are in your own same bag.

96
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,900
This is what you're talking about?

97
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,200
- No.
- Would you need this?

98
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,300
Yes.

99
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,600
Have you ever thought about
a normal past time?

100
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,500
Cooking, make a pie.

101
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,300
You're just jealous
because I do lunch.

102
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,900
What should I do with that?

103
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,600
Looks like you ain't fixing, Elvira.

104
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
I am working on it.

105
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,800
I will slap you naked
and hide your clothes.

106
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Hey brother, hie.
Come here.

107
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,100
- Hey, how you're doing?
- I'm good.

108
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,300
- You okay?
- I am fine, I am fine.

109
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,100
You guys are working
out there or what?

110
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,100
No, we are just wrestling.

111
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,100
And then I hit my tooth...

112
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,400
Earlier this morning when I was
working on Joe's car break...

113
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,900
And I fell and it looked like...

114
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,700
- What happened to it? What you do?
- I don't know.

115
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,900
Hey, Leland. You tell your
child to stop biting my dog.

116
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,400
He got red marks all over
his body from her fangs.

117
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,500
Fangs, we call.

118
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,800
Dogs have bacteria, sweetie.

119
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't want to be like my brother.

120
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,600
Which one?

121
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,300
Well, neither of them.

122
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,100
Tip spent all day drunkard, lazy.

123
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,900
He's not like my father who really
work, study for everything he has.

124
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,600
What did they think of you?

125
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,300
I think that they're afraid
I'm going to end up like Tip.

126
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,600
Living at home 4 years from now,
working at the mill.

127
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
I worked at the mill one summer.

128
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,900
They wrap blankets and plastic and...

129
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,400
We're working a cake, it's like
dust and stuff in the air and...

130
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
There is this sprinkling system
that turns on every hour...

131
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,400
To keep the fibres down and
you get rain on.

132
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,000
At least you have that experience.

133
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,000
I have never even been inside.

134
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,200
You know, I never have a real job.

135
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,100
Never been paid for anything normal.

136
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,000
I just don't want to go
to college and...

137
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,800
Have to be like, you know,
4 years and...

138
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,000
Writing bad poetry.

139
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,700
Listening to drums.

140
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I think there is probably just as much
bad poetry in the breakroom at the mill

141
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,600
Yeah.

142
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,300
What?

143
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,200
I got a secret.

144
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,100
But you have to come here.

145
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,600
Come over there?

146
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,900
Hey Bo, if Cliver saw
race this weekend...

147
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,100
I might need you to ride along
with me if you don't mind.

148
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm not kidding either.
When the hell I get angry?

149
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,700
Like that short trees race track that
I did with Robin on the back of them.

150
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,000
And Cliver saw him
got out of his car,

151
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,600
He climbed the tree and
kicked that dude's ass.

152
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,600
The dude up the tree was saying,

153
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,600
"Get out, go. Go down. Go out of
this tree. Get out. Stop climbing."

154
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,600
You remember that?

155
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,600
Hey, let's get some mothballs and
make my truck go faster.

156
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,100
Why are you all so quiet?

157
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,100
Marshall...

158
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,300
Says you hang out
with my little sister.

159
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,900
Saw you all hanging out.

160
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,700
Did he?

161
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,900
So what?

162
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,900
I hope there is no more talk
about that kind of stuff,

163
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,800
I get uncomfortable, you know.

164
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,700
We've been asked about things,

165
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,100
Margaret came down here
with her sweater earlier.

166
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,300
So what, you're a lover now?

167
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,000
What do you care, man?

168
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Not like she's your sister.

169
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
Damn.

170
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,500
"You keep getting older
and you don't ever die."

171
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,500
God.

172
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,200
You know there're a few things
about me that you don't know.

173
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,400
There are a few things about me
that you don't know.

174
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,400
- Oh, really?
- Oh really.

175
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
I'll like to play you a song about it
- Okay.

176
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,600
Here we go, 2, 3 and...

177
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,800
Snake eyes, going to win or lose.

178
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,800
That's great. I don't know
you play instruments.

179
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,800
You didn't say much about that.

180
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,600
- Well, he doesn't really talk to me.
- Watch the retractor there.

181
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,700
I'll watch my own instrument.
Thank you.

182
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,300
You're welcome.

183
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,700
Are you stupid or just blind, Noel?

184
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
I'm neither one.
You clearly don't know him.

185
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,100
What are you talking about?
He fucked every girl in this town.

186
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,700
- That is not true.
- It is true. I asked him.

187
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,400
- Did you asked him?
- Did you sleep with her or not?

188
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,100
And he walks away.

189
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,800
- I think I hate you.
- He won't walk away from me.

190
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,000
All right, because you are different.

191
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,000
Tip, could you put that down, please?

192
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,300
What makes you so special?

193
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,900
What makes you so special
besides the fact...

194
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,500
That you're new back in town and you
don't know what kind of guy he is.

195
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,300
I think I hate you.

196
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,100
I hate you.

197
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,000
If he is so horrible,
why are you his best friend?

198
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,100
Put that down!

199
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,000
Get out!

200
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,600
No, get a girl to do,
I'm not doing that.

201
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,400
But you've such a funny face.

202
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,600
- Excuse me.
- Look...

203
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,800
No, mom.

204
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,400
I need a hand. Just a little help.

205
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,800
- I don't want to do that crap.
- It is a couple of hours, please?

206
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,200
Don't touch me with
that clown costume.

207
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,400
Hello?

208
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,800
Awesome, mom.
Awesome.

209
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,500
With you, it taste different.

210
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,500
I like hanging out with you coz...

211
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,000
You look around and listen.

212
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,800
You know...
you follow.

213
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,000
When we're little,
I was too dumb to notice.

214
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,400
Did you just fart?

215
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,800
And here you are.

216
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
You always be happy.

217
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,400
- Did I say something stupid?
- No.

218
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I pretend that...

219
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,100
I only have 10 seconds left to live.

220
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,400
One, two, three...

221
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
I like the mountains.

222
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,500
All right.
That's good.

223
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,500
What's wrong now?

224
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,800
Last night, I had a bad dream,
and you're in the river.

225
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,700
And you aren't moving,
and you were freezing,

226
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,300
And I was watching and cry.

227
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,700
Will you stay here with me?

228
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,200
Oh yeah, I will stay, be your friend.

229
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,200
Always be your daddy.

230
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,600
Can I go play now?

231
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,100
It's like this.
"Strong as a bird. Fast as a...

232
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
You know what I mean?

233
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,100
Hey, what's going on?
Do you want a pretzel?

234
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,500
Strong as a eagle,
fast as T.

235
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,600
You know what I mean?
It's like lndian talk.

236
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,200
We're going to start a band.

237
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,600
What do you play?

238
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
You hear that before?

239
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,400
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, I am into it big time.

240
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,900
With my dream, you know.

241
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,700
I tell a lot of people, you know,
that I am into...

242
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,800
They look like me like
I am an alien or something.

243
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,600
Fast as a cob.

244
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,300
What I want to do? I'll sit there...

245
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,200
By myself in the dirt
with nobody around.

246
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,400
Start all over and put new ones down.
Make a wish.

247
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,400
That's really cool.

248
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,600
I love music.
Music makes me happy.

249
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,100
- I play the trombone.
- Do you?

250
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,600
- How long?
- About 4 years.

251
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,000
I can play
for longer than that.

252
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,500
Like ten.

253
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,100
Since you are like 12?

254
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,800
You want to see my teeth?

255
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,500
Tall as a bear.

256
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,200
...no, bird.

257
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
Tricky, it's tricky.

258
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,200
Pretzels are carbohydrate and they
expand in your stomach and turn to fat

259
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,300
Well,

260
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,100
- Eat it up. Eat more.
- I will.

261
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,200
Pancakes expand in your stomach too.

262
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,500
- Did they really?
- They do.

263
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,400
I didn't know that.

264
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,000
Don't you think about, you know,

265
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,900
When you order a pancakes
in the restaurant...

266
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,400
And just like sit in your
stomach like a brick?

267
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,700
- Usually I don't go for pancakes.
- What do you go for?

268
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,700
- Eggs?
- Really?

269
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,200
You know, what about waffles
or stuff like that?

270
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,300
No, the place that I go are
usually not that fancy.

271
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
So you two going out?

272
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
We hang out a lot.

273
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,700
It's different when it's a family.

274
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,300
I won't know that.

275
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,800
But Tip see you exactly
what he hates himself.

276
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,800
You think he'll just forgive and
forget about it?

277
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,400
Go up, tell it's all right.

278
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,400
"Go ahead, get my sister.
I've seen what you done...

279
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,100
With every other
girl in town. It's okay."

280
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,900
What you want me to do?
Turn the things off?

281
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,500
What do you want Tip to do?

282
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,700
I want him to calm down, I guess.

283
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,800
That's not going to happen.

284
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,300
Maybe if you didn't go down on...

285
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,200
Every girl's history book
as the asshole's ex-boyfriend.

286
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,900
But you have.

287
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,800
I have a dream that...

288
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,000
You grow a garden on
a trampoline and...

289
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,900
I was so happy that
I invent a peanut butter.

290
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,600
I saw them together today.

291
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,100
He's going to fuck your sister
like you fuck me...

292
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,600
And everybody else in this town.

293
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,700
Are you fucking my sister?

294
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,600
You didn't even feel anything.
I am just another girl.

295
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,300
But still kept going.

296
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,700
I thought I love him,
I thought he is in love with me.

297
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,000
I thought one day he'll wake up and...

298
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I don't even know who
have you been talking to.

299
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,700
Tip, stop!

300
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,800
What the hell are you talking about?

301
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,000
I don't even know who
have you been talking to.

302
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,000
What do you got to give, Tip?
What do you got to give?

303
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,100
He is just jealous, man.
He want to fuck his own sister.

304
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,000
Tip.

305
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,500
Tip.

306
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,600
We ain't friends no more.

307
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,900
You're on my top 10.

308
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,800
Who is that girl at the river?

309
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,300
Tammy Clinard.

310
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
She is this girl...

311
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,600
Did you date her?

312
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Did you sleep with her?

313
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,400
You have too much shit on this bed.

314
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I got a long time ago.
I was drunk.

315
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,000
Wait. Can I say something?

316
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,400
- I am sorry.
- No, don't be sorry.

317
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,200
I just want to say that...

318
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,800
I never have sex with anyone before.

319
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But I trust you.

320
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
You trust me?

321
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,400
Do you trust me?

322
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,500
I make some ugly mistakes.

323
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,700
With girls?

324
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,700
There are most really ugly.

325
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,700
And anything...

326
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,700
That will make you feel
more comfortable for you to know...

327
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,100
I want to tell you that stuff...

328
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,200
Because I care about...
because I care about you.

329
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,600
A lot.

330
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,900
And when...

331
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,300
You know when people
from before come up...

332
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,800
And I want you to understand...

333
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,500
What they hate when they see me.

334
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,900
I think that...

335
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,200
I feel like...

336
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,900
If everything that you
have done before...

337
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,000
Makes you who you are now, then...

338
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,900
No matter how...

339
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:34,200
Ugly it is, I'm just going to learn
and deal with it because...

340
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,900
Right now, it's...

341
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,300
You and me.

342
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,300
You're the best boyfriend for me,
and I know that...

343
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,800
I am the best girl for you.

344
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,400
So...

345
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,900
If you don't choose to say
those things, I won't ask.

346
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,700
The first time I had sex,
I was 13 years old...

347
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,300
And it was in a basement, with
this older girl that I didn't know.

348
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,800
And then when we're,
when we are finished...

349
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,200
I was nervous...

350
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,700
I try to be cool and I told a joke.
It was stupid.

351
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,400
She never spoke to me again.

352
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,000
I just want to make sure that
in a million years from now...

353
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,400
I can still see you up-close and we'll
still have amazing things to say.

354
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,400
I am going to go now.

355
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,800
Okay.

356
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,100
How am I suppose to think
this girl is enough for you?

357
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,900
You'll meet her and then you'll know.

358
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,400
What if you ain't good for her?

359
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,900
Crazy.

360
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Educated or honest or strong.

361
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,900
You don't have any faith.

362
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,400
You're my man that's
ever been in my life.

363
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,700
I am pretty strong.

364
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,700
You are funny.

365
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,400
But you know, maybe...

366
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,800
I get hurt, and I'm worry about others
like me that don't mean any harm.

367
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,100
I've stood where she stand.
I've seen the look you have.

368
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,000
I am just happy.

369
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,800
Look at me and say that.

370
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,400
I am happy.

371
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,200
I don't believe you.

372
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,300
Are you in love now or something?

373
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,200
What do you mean?

374
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
When you finish being in love,
you should come over to my house.

375
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,900
I got a water bed.

376
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,800
What is that suppose to mean?

377
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,000
What's up? When you're hooked with
your friend. I've been working out.

378
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,600
Check out this pipes. Look at this.

379
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Noel, wait up.

380
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,400
Who is number two?
Who is back up for you?

381
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,000
- What?
- Who'll be the 2nd one you go with?

382
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:20,000
First choice is not available.
Who is number two?

383
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,300
I don't want to choose number two.

384
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,400
You don't have to act or anything but,
just if you had to, who'll it be?

385
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,400
It won't be anybody.

386
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
If you had to choose a
certain back up, if you...

387
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,900
Why would I have to choose?

388
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,600
You have to, everyone else is gone.

389
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
What if I want to be alone?

390
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Okay, you can't choose alone or
number one. Who is number 2?

391
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,500
This is a ridiculous question.

392
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,000
Who you'll have sex with more?
Me or a preacher?

393
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
All those people that
pass through your life...

394
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,500
And they come and go find that
they're all gone and there is no...

395
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,600
There is no second best,
and she's the one...

396
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,900
Who talks to you,
with all you need to be...

397
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,700
And she laugh at the
funny thing that you say...

398
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,900
Like she was, she is in on a joke,
and then she whispers in your ear.

399
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,300
You know, when she first died...

400
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
I won't even shaken...

401
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:33,400
Because I could see myself
in her eyes before they close.

402
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,500
I was naked, looking over her.

403
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,000
The good stuff that
you've felt with Elise...

404
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,700
- Was that worth it?
- I think about that...

405
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,400
But how I felt if
something happen to you.

406
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,900
Or your mama...

407
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:05,200
Your Feng-Shui or
love another woman again?

408
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,600
I never want to feel that close.

409
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Ever again.

410
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,700
- Are you still seeing Eric?
- Yes.

411
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,200
My brother can do that. My brother've
listened to me and he pumped his...

412
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,700
That's really disgusting.

413
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,100
- Did he ever get jealous?
- Yeah.

414
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,900
- He does.
- He is jealous.

415
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,600
You talk to another guy?

416
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,300
Yeah but he, I mean
he understand sometimes...

417
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,100
He will sit there and he'll watch.

418
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,700
But you know, just joke. It's not that
he's not worry about me or anything.

419
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,700
He's worry about the other man.

420
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,200
That's true.

421
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,300
I have learn that in a hard way.
You cannot trust man.

422
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,000
Have you ever had any
bad run in with man?

423
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:07,000
I've been to boarding school with
all girls since I was 1 2, so...

424
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,800
Not much experience.

425
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,800
You got something on your hair.

426
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,200
I like it when you smile at me.

427
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,200
You want to spend the night together?

428
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,200
You mean like a summer party?
A sleep over?

429
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
I think that's a good idea.

430
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,600
It smells like
is in here.

431
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,500
Two rooms.

432
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,600
What do you want to do?

433
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,700
What do you mean?

434
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,700
I don't know. Did you want
to get drunk or something?

435
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,400
Not really. Do you want to get drunk?

436
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,200
No. I don't.
I didn't know.

437
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,700
Do you want me to give up my pillow?

438
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,400
I still have my pillow.

439
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,300
I realise this.

440
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,400
I want to show you something.

441
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,500
I used to go fishing a lot...

442
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,300
My dad.

443
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,400
One summer when I was 12...

444
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,100
We went to Lake Sturtsum together.

445
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,900
I was a good fisherman so I used
to get to real fishing, you know.

446
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,300
My dad would take them and
cut them up and he cooked them.

447
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,400
And we get to eat them.

448
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,900
One day, I was...

449
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,200
I was driving the boat.

450
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,500
I wasn't suppose to coz,

451
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,600
But my dad let me take the
wheel because he was drunk.

452
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,600
There was these kids
out in the middle...

453
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,000
Swimming.

454
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,600
I guess I let the boat
get away from me.

455
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,700
I ran over this little boy.

456
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,700
We almost have killed him.

457
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,200
He wasn't coming out when everybody
was screaming hysterically.

458
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
My dad...

459
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,900
Push me down at the bottom of the
boat and he told me not to look.

460
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,500
I grabbed the fish hook from the
bottom and I just started scratching.

461
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,300
Then when I came home,
I was...

462
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,900
...mom and Tip that it was
an accident. But it wasn't.

463
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,100
You're the first person that
I want to tell that to.

464
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:23,400
Because you're the first person I want
to talk to for more than 5 minutes...

465
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,200
Ever.

466
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,100
Baby, I like,
I like that you trust me.

467
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,400
Does it hurt still?

468
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,600
It hurts because...

469
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,000
I know what was going through
my head when I did that...

470
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,400
It was like a release, you know.

471
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,000
I was glad, I was glad
that I have the pain.

472
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
You are so nice.

473
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,900
Sometimes, I am scare of myself.

474
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,700
But I am not scare with you.

475
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,400
Get undress.
Get into the water.

476
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,600
Are you okay?

477
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,700
I thought I was wearing my boxers.

478
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,000
It's cool.

479
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,000
Two seconds.

480
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,000
You are a baby.

481
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,000
Excuse me?

482
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,100
You see that right there? You
see that. It's tough skin, girl.

483
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,800
I don't know if you know
anything about Celtiques...

484
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,600
That is our symbol for fit size.

485
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,600
Are you okay?

486
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,900
I tore my nuts.

487
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,000
No more cannon-balls.

488
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,200
And no more pulling pants games.

489
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,800
Only what?

490
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,900
It hurts.
I like it when it hurts.

491
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,600
Kiss me on the neck.

492
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,100
You want me to kiss you on your neck?

493
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,900
Right there.

494
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,700
- Right there?
- Right there.

495
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,700
You sure right there?

496
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,900
Where again?

497
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,900
I don't want to have sex with you.

498
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,400
Are you attracted to somebody?

499
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,200
You're the best.

500
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,400
Will you just sleep here with me?

501
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,400
Sometimes I can't tell...

502
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,800
I can read your mind.

503
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,600
I don't want to be like what
it was like everything else.

504
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You fuck her yet?

505
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,800
Did you?

506
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,500
Is it top secret?
Is it I am not suppose to know?

507
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,100
Special delivery?

508
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,600
I don't know if I can go out
with her for this long...

509
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,100
I probably at least
have feel her boobs.

510
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,200
I meant to tell you that.

511
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,700
She have nice boobs.

512
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,900
Sometimes your...

513
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:21,100
Friends aren't good to you or you
might not be good to your friends?

514
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,800
I talked to Beth last night. She and
the girls think I'm avoiding them.

515
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,700
You mean you were?

516
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,900
I guess I just lost track.

517
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,400
So we decide to go to
Vicki's house next weekend.

518
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,000
Would you want to go?

519
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,200
And pine needles and cone and sand.

520
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,800
Fun like in the lake
in the winter time.

521
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,100
I like the sound of water.

522
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,000
It makes me pee.

523
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,100
I guess that...

524
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,100
I will just go and...

525
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,100
Learn how to miss you...

526
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,500
You can do the same thing here.

527
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,300
I want to dance.

528
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,100
But I don't want you to watch.

529
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,700
Mom?

530
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,500
What are you doing?

531
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,900
What are you doing?

532
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,100
Mother.

533
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,900
Where have you been with my car?

534
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,400
I forgot about your thing.

535
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,000
You're suppose to be here, oh God,
4 hours ago or something like that.

536
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,500
Did you know that it was Levante's
birthday party, I told you that actually

537
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,200
I remembered you saying
something, yeah, Levante.

538
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,100
- The kid that couldn't walk.
- I waited for an hour.

539
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,000
Then I rode my bicycle.

540
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,800
By the time I got there, the party
was over and he was back in bed.

541
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,900
Sorry.

542
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,800
That's all you have to say?

543
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,900
I am really sorry.

544
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,300
Listen, I'm sorry I forgot about it.

545
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,800
I don't even remember you
telling me about it...

546
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,100
But I believe that you did,

547
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,400
I've been a little occupied
lately and I understand.

548
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,500
I miss it.

549
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,200
Where were you?

550
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,400
I was just off.

551
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,300
Doing what?

552
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
Hanging out with...

553
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,400
- This girl?
- Yes, with this girl.

554
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,600
Mom, I'm not a kid anymore.
I got to go with how I feel.

555
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,000
I just do what else
am I suppose to do. Stop feeling?

556
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,100
Your selfishness, I pay the price.

557
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,400
I live here because I love you and
I don't want to see you alone.

558
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,100
I'm sorry if you're just jealous or
sad or you just want to shelter me.

559
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,000
I am very happy actually.

560
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,000
God jerk...

561
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,100
Don't call me a fucking jerk.

562
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,000
He's gotten up behind you.

563
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,800
Come on!

564
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,300
Hey, Tip.

565
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,300
I missed you at the race.

566
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,800
We didn't do real well.

567
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,200
Of course I will.

568
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,200
She changed a lot.

569
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,900
I know.

570
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:28,600
This is hard for me because
I know what you're. You're like me.

571
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,200
We are partner in crime.

572
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,900
She makes me decent.

573
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,300
You banged a lot of chicks, huh?

574
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,200
You took them down and
left by the way home.

575
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:06,400
Man, look at us.
We're getting old.

576
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,300
Not me, man.

577
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,800
I still sleep with my light on,
wet my bed or suck my fucking thumb.

578
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,200
All the girls I've been with, I never
spent a night away from home.

579
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,300
I afraid I will have bad dreams.

580
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:44,500
Last summer, I have this collection.

581
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,300
It was real special to me.

582
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,400
One day, I get home
from work and Justin...

583
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,500
He let them all go, you know.

584
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,300
I know he was just a kid but...

585
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,200
Hurtful things is bad.

586
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,300
You have a collection?

587
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,400
You want to hear something funny?

588
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,500
What's that?

589
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,700
I will be daddy.

590
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,100
You're going to be what?

591
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,800
Rachel came and find
her buddy yesterday.

592
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,700
The truth is...

593
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,600
I don't want to lose her.

594
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,300
Last night, I've decided...

595
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,600
Can you believe that I cried?
I cried because I was happy.

596
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,300
A pussy, huh?

597
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,400
Yeah, you're a pussy.

598
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,300
When I get this morning,
I cry myself back to sleep again.

599
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,400
Do you love her?

600
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,500
I guess.

601
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,000
There you go.

602
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,100
Come here.

603
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,600
Sit.
Good boy.

604
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:36,300
This ain't exactly a sport,
Tip is not much of an athlete.

605
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,100
He says he think I am a victim.

606
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,500
- He thinks you're a victim?
- Yeah.

607
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,100
What do you think?

608
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,000
Do you miss my sister?

609
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,000
Why, do you?

610
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,600
Yeah.

611
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,500
Yeah, me too.
She's nice, ain't she?

612
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,700
Teach you how to play what?

613
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,000
Teach me how to play piano.

614
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,500
- Teach you how to play piano?
- Yeah.

615
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,200
Sure I can.

616
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,500
- For 50 bucks.
- Huh?

617
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,600
Give me a five, dude.

618
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,500
My hand.

619
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:25,900
Hello.

620
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,300
What's up?

621
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,400
What's going on?
Where are you?

622
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,300
I'm at Vicki's lakehouse.
We're having a party at the deck.

623
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,800
You're having a party?

624
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,700
It's just a bunch of drunk people.

625
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,500
I got a suprise for you.

626
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,500
What suprise?

627
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,300
It's kind of drastic.
I don't know if you'll like it.

628
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,000
What is it?

629
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,600
What is it?

630
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,100
It is a suprise.

631
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:00,600
Why don't you just give it to me
when you get back here, I guess.

632
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,200
I was hanging out with Justin.

633
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:09,700
He wants me to play...
teach him how to play the piano.

634
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,700
I don't know, not sure what to do,
I don't know the right...

635
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,100
Like a lesson, coz I don't really know
how to play the piano that well.

636
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,200
Hello?

637
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,600
Yeah?

638
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Are you having a good time?

639
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,300
There was this guy,
he keeps looking at me,

640
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,400
He was such a dolt.
I hope he'll leave.

641
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,400
- I miss you.
- Yeah, I miss you too.

642
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:42,300
So, is this guy a friend
of Vicky or whatever?

643
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,900
He is just a friend.
It's kind of raining here.

644
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,600
- Is it really?
- Yeah.

645
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,500
Really raining actually.

646
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,400
That was perfect.

647
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,900
What's wrong?

648
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,500
I think your hair looks great.

649
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,800
It makes you look
completely different.

650
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,500
- You think?
- Yeah.

651
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,500
It's great.

652
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,700
Where did it all go?

653
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,700
It makes your eyes look
bigger in a really good way.

654
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,700
It's so short.

655
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,900
- It's not that short.
- It's pretty short.

656
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,900
- It looks really good though.
- Thank you.

657
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,700
I am really happy you're here.

658
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,300
I miss you a little bit.

659
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,900
I am sorry.
I am a little hangover.

660
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,700
I hear you.
Big weekend.

661
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:38,100
There's this guy, Patrick, who's there
and he was going around and he was...

662
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,400
He was moaning everyone, you know...

663
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,700
You'll be like talking and there'll
be like this big butt around you.

664
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:48,600
And there's like this house
of elderly people and he...

665
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:53,600
He pull down his pants, he shot a
firecracker through his leg at them.

666
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,000
It was funny. You'll have thought
it was cool if you were there.

667
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,900
Do you...

668
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,500
Let's go somewhere.

669
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,100
I mean I have a place for us...

670
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,500
I have a suprise for you.

671
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,500
- You do?
- I do.

672
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,300
Come on.

673
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,500
It's not far, I promised.

674
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,700
Could we talk for a second?

675
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,000
Sit down.

676
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,100
I have such a funny weekend.

677
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,400
Funny how?

678
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,900
There was this guy that I met at the
lake. He is a friend of a friend.

679
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,800
What about him?

680
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,400
Baby?

681
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,800
Baby, what did he do to you?

682
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,100
What?

683
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,300
We fucked.

684
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,600
I didn't mean for it...

685
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,900
I don't know how it happened.

686
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:37,600
I didn't plan...
I tried so hard not to make it hurt.

687
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,300
Did he hurt you?

688
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,900
- He raped you?
- No...

689
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:47,000
Not to make it hurt you.
I don't want to hurt you.

690
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,700
What are you talking about?

691
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,900
I'm talking about...what,
I don't know what, I don't know...

692
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,600
I don't know what I am talking about.

693
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,800
I am trying to be open with you.

694
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,500
Why?

695
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,500
Just don't say anything.
Just shut up.

696
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,200
I'm just trying to figure out,
I'm just trying...

697
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,200
To figure out what
I'm going to do here.

698
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,900
Wait a second.
What am I going to do?

699
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,200
How am I supposed
to just get past this?

700
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,500
What do you...

701
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,000
What do you telling me that
you had sex with some guy?

702
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,000
I don't know.
I don't know.

703
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,200
What do you mean you don't know?
That's what you just said.

704
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,000
- You just said that to me.
- I know I said it. I know I said it.

705
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,800
I didn't mean it...

706
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,400
I mean I didn't...

707
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,300
Listen, if you just tell me
what you want me to do here...

708
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,900
I mean tell me what I did to you...

709
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,600
That's what I'm trying to say here.

710
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,400
I need to figure out what I need here,
okay?

711
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,400
And I feel sick, I feel sick.
I feel sick.

712
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:07,700
Who is this guy?
You had sex with some guy?

713
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,500
Do I know who he is?
Just tell me I know who he is.

714
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,300
Tell me I know who he is.

715
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,400
- Where does he live?
- I love you.

716
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,500
I love you.

717
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,200
- What?
- I love you.

718
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,400
- You what?
- I love you.

719
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,600
Why would you said that?

720
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,800
What is wrong with you?

721
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,900
What did I do to you?

722
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,800
It's just that I love you...

723
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,400
Because I want you to love me,

724
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,500
Don't try to correct something that
you fucked up by saying I love you.

725
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,100
Why would you said that to me?

726
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,200
What's wrong with you?

727
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,500
- What did I do to you?
- Did you hear me?

728
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,900
I said, "l love you" because how
else, how else am I suppose to...

729
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,600
How else am I suppose
to explain to you...

730
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
That this isn't
something that you did?

731
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,900
This is not something that you did.

732
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,100
I love you.
That's how I feel.

733
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,700
I'm looking at you right now
and I hear you talking...

734
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,000
And all the words
that are coming out of...

735
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,500
Your mouth are like
coming out of a stranger.

736
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,700
Why don't you put your fucking
hair back and come back.

737
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,800
Just come back.

738
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,900
The worst part is,
I don't even know this guy.

739
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,500
He is just some guy that she met at the
lake, and they hang out at the lake,

740
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,300
And then, he just
fucks her brain out.

741
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,400
I mean you don't understand, she...

742
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,600
I've been through 26 woman in my life.

743
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,000
You know all of a sudden, I stop and
this girl breaks to the surface...

744
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:08,000
This virgin breaks to the surface and
she did the exact same thing to me.

745
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,500
- She is a virgin?
- Yeah.

746
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,900
You mean you never did...
Damn.

747
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:20,700
If anybody smile at me ever again,
I'm going to freak out.

748
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,600
And he say one little thing...

749
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:41,800
Girls are smart.
They figured this out.

750
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,900
Woman make you act like monkey.

751
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,100
They become monkey and
they get vulnerable.

752
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,900
They let your guard down...

753
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,900
They identify your weakness...Bam!
They're in control.

754
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:56,100
This is creative thinking, kind
of like when you're dating Kelly.

755
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:01,500
I mean if you want to bust a nut,
that's your business.

756
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,700
But you're about to have a baby.

757
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,700
You can't even afford your braces.

758
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,300
Mary Margaret, I see you.

759
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,400
Where have you been?

760
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,600
I haven't been anywhere.
I've been right here.

761
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,200
Nowhere.

762
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,900
Let me get that for you.

763
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:16,000
You put that back on.
I'll put that on for you.

764
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,800
You have a great ear-rings.

765
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,900
My dad
for the baby.

766
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,300
Congratulations to your...
Happy Birthday.

767
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:39,200
Baby, when baby get borned,
it's like a woman's time.

768
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,000
It's only girls in there,

769
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:46,900
You know, you try to pop your head in
and they don't want you around.

770
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,300
I don't know.

771
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:55,600
Listen, I want to talk about
when we're dating...

772
01:19:55,700 --> 01:20:00,300
I wanted to say to you that,
if I hurt your feelings...

773
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,500
If I hurt your feelings,

774
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,700
- Then I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

775
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,000
- I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.
- Shut up.

776
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:14,500
I'm really sorry. I'm trying to
apologise to you in a real way.

777
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,800
You're not sorry.
You know how I know that?

778
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,300
Because you're not
smart enough to be sorry.

779
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,000
Guys like you,

780
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,900
They don't quit...

781
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
And they never leave.
You're going to be here forever.

782
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,400
How does it make you
feel knowing that?

783
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,700
Hey, what's happening, Sattler?

784
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:41,600
Hey Bust-Ass, nice outfit.
Your mama get that for you?

785
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,100
You let me borrow them?

786
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,300
Hey, do you want to know a secret
that I didn't tell anybody ever?

787
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,000
No.

788
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,800
When I was walking in the dark
I had before Dwayne...

789
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,700
This dog named Mr T...

790
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:08,100
When he was a puppy, he had a, his
hair was sticking out like a mohawk.

791
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:13,100
And you know how ducks fly home
in a V? It's like a V shape.

792
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,800
And they get home...

793
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:20,500
And I was walking my dog and...

794
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,800
I looked up and there
is a big V above me,

795
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,300
And l, there is all these ducks
flying back to their home.

796
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:33,200
- Can I please get a beer?
- And right when they flew above me...

797
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:40,600
I saw them and they're crashing
to a big house, the whole V.

798
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:47,500
And then they hit the ground,
and they just kind of curl up.

799
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
You ever fucking see that?

800
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:56,000
Have you ever seen a mistaken nature?

801
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,600
Have you ever see an
animal make a mistake?

802
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,400
What kind of pleasure
you having here?

803
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,300
Really?

804
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,500
What kind of gas you put in here?

805
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,500
87.

806
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,000
We thought it'll go faster.

807
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:58,100
- I might have one.
- Where do you keep it?

808
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,700
Hey.

809
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,100
Where are you going?

810
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,500
What?

811
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,600
Come for a ride with me.

812
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,700
Why?

813
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,500
Coz I want to talk to you.

814
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,800
You car break down?

815
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:50,000
Leland got it started.

816
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,700
I am in a truck.

817
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,700
What are you thinking about?

818
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:06,300
I'm thinking about how we
sit in this car right now.

819
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,500
I wish we could talk.

820
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:22,400
It sounds to me like you
got Bust-Ass to talk to.

821
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,300
We're just friends and you know it.

822
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,200
Oh, you guys are friend?

823
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,600
That's awesome.

824
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,000
Actually, I didn't know that.
I thought he was my friend.

825
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,900
But it's great that you guys
are tight like that.

826
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,100
We just started talking.

827
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:45,200
He's really fun. We went bowling when
Blake and those guys are there.

828
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,000
Yeah, I don't know.
It's cool this is so easy for you.

829
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,800
At least I am trying.

830
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,400
You see this is why you
don't know anything about me.

831
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,000
I mean, you know a lot.

832
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,100
And that's yours.
You can keep it.

833
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,500
I'm just the guy who thought...

834
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,000
He was finally on the right track
and making the right moves.

835
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:17,700
Bust-Ass said that...

836
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:20,300
Don't tell me what Bust-Ass said.

837
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,700
That's not even his name.
His name is Tracy.

838
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,200
I don't care what that
fucking dick said.

839
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,200
- I can't even talk to you.
- Listen to me,

840
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:37,200
Every single girl I've ever touched,
I regret every night.

841
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,100
What is that mean?

842
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,300
Are you saying that...

843
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:58,200
You think that we should just
forget about each other?

844
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:08,700
That's the saddest thing
in the whole world.

845
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:14,500
I'm just saying that...in the future,
don't come crying to me coz...

846
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:21,800
Coz I'm not feeling anymore your
midnight phone calls coz you fuck up.

847
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,500
Wait, wait,
please stop.

848
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,600
Would you come over one last time?

849
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,800
Because I am sorry, I am sorry.

850
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:45,100
And I want to make sure that the
words in my head come across to you.

851
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:51,600
I want you to see the feelings
I have for you.

852
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,700
You can touch me.

853
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,900
Are you okay?

854
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,400
I don't know what to
say to you anymore.

855
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:39,000
Don't say anything.

856
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,200
Don't smoke in my room.

857
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:20,100
When you sit around crying,
it ain't going to do you any good.

858
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,900
I got news for you.

859
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:26,700
You got to grow up and balance your
personal life with responsibility.

860
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,600
What am I suppose to do, dress up
like a clown and change bedpans?

861
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:34,100
I don't understand why I've to
listen to this crap when you're...

862
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:36,400
Fucking standing here
with a broken heart about...

863
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:42,500
That's good.
That's a good one.

864
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:45,400
Do you know what this is?

865
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,500
Do you know what this is?

866
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,100
Clown's clothes.

867
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:55,700
That's what.

868
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:59,200
This is what I get for
living through hard times.

869
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,200
These are the clothes I wear.

870
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,100
This is my face now.

871
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,000
Do you want to look like me?

872
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:13,200
Do you want to look like this?

873
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,800
I was fucking beautiful.

874
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,600
Look at me.

875
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,400
I got my own battle to attend to.

876
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,500
I didn't mean that I don't love you.

877
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I don't.

878
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:27,000
It is just that I can see the future
and you got other opportunity...

879
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:31,900
Opportunity I didn't have.

880
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,700
I don't know the kind of
moment that have got...

881
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,600
Where is that going to get you?

882
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:50,900
I just want to be like
she never existed.

883
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,400
No, you don't.

884
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,200
I can tell you that right now.

885
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,700
Justin, it's good to see you, pal.

886
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:48,900
I miss you.

887
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,300
I miss you too.

888
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:57,800
Stop the world.

889
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,100
You came to the door.

890
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,600
I did.

891
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:12,900
And I got some stuff to say,
if you don't mind.

892
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,600
You got paper-towels?

893
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:19,100
Yeah.

894
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,600
We're making macaroni and cheese,
do you want some?

895
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,000
No.

896
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,900
It's all over.

897
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
No, I am sorry.
I am sorry.

898
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:45,600
Take it easy, buddy.

899
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,900
Be strong.

900
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,000
What did you do?

901
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,000
I got to fire my truck.

902
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,800
Does it hurt?

903
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,500
Yeah.

904
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,900
I'm not the smartest guy in the world.

905
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,500
I guess what I was trying to do
is become a better person.

906
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,900
You know what I think?

907
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:25,800
My problem is not anything
that you did.

908
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,400
It's between me and...

909
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:35,600
Me.

910
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:46,100
Well, I did what I did.

911
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:51,200
It felt...

912
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:53,300
So...

913
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,100
Wrong.

914
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,700
And that's when I realised
that I love you.

915
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:09,200
You can't understand it but
that's what I have found out.

916
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,500
It is an emotional thing.

917
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,000
Nobody tells you that part.

918
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,000
It's true.

919
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:22,700
I miss your face.

920
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:30,000
You know what?

921
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,500
You're not allowed to hate me.

922
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:38,000
Because I am not going to let you.

923
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:46,700
Nobody said we
have to be perfect.

924
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:04,300
I wish it didn't hurt with
every thought of you.

925
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
You have my heart.

926
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,000
Can you close your eyes?

927
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,600
Pretend you can see the ocean.

928
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:13,300
Pretend you standing over the ocean.

929
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,200
You are a millionaire.

930
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:22,400
Pretend we're running under the ocean.

931
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:26,400
You jumping across mountains.

932
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:31,600
You jumping across mountains.

933
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,700
I used to be the richest
man in the world.

934
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:02,300
Now, I'm sitting here
looking out at the state...

935
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,000
Happier than I have ever been.

936
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:10,700
With next to nothing.

937
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:20,800
I thinking about growing a beard.

938
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,600
You know when you hit me,

939
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:54,200
It hurt.

940
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,900
I mean it hurts.

941
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,400
But it help me.

942
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,700
Have you ever held a baby?

943
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,900
Are we always going to be this old?

944
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,400
I don't want to do it alone.

945
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,400
I mean...

946
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,600
...I brought you all the way out here.

947
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:08,300
It's not like I'm the one
who need swimming lessons.

948
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:14,400
And the fact that you're not even
trying, that baffles me, really.

949
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:17,300
What are you afraid of?

950
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,200
There is no sharks in here.

951
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:24,500
Suppose the water all
comes walking down...

952
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,900
The tracks and sees you,
what is he going to say about you?

953
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:38,300
If there is a time in the world,
there is time to take a chance...

954
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,700
...it's time right now to take a
chance. What's this? Water. Get in it.

955
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:46,400
It is water. Listen.

956
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:53,400
This river goes two ways.
That way and that way.

957
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,500
You know what I am saying?

958
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:01,000
It's like a puzzle with pants,
if you think about it.

959
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,600
Are you happy now?

960
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:24,600
