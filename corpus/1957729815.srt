1
00:00:01,188 --> 00:00:03,938
(coins rattling)

2
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:09,706
(machine buzzing)
(bills slapping)

3
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:13,007
(suspenseful music)

4
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:16,008
(scissors snipping)

5
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:23,968
(suspenseful music)

6
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:43,199
- Catherine, do me a favor
and keep an eye on my station.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,220
And shut it down when it's finished.

8
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:46,221
Thanks.

9
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,965
(suspenseful music)

10
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:33,569
Hey.
- Hey.

11
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,942
Jill, you're late, it's 11:30.

12
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:36,789
- It's 11:15.

13
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,330
You set your watch fast, didn't you?

14
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:43,283
(suspenseful music)

15
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:52,160
- Okay, you can let me out here.

16
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,930
(suspenseful music)

17
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:10,149
(sighs) Okay.

18
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,150
- Wait a second.

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,193
Good luck, baby.

20
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,247
- I'll see you in a few.

21
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:20,037
(car door slams)

22
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:23,038
(suspenseful music)

23
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:37,552
(dramatic music)

24
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,611
This is a robbery!

25
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:41,676
I want everybody down!

26
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,416
I want everybody on the ground!

27
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,275
Now!

28
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:46,566
You too, Captain Kirk!

29
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,724
Hey, either everybody's
down or everybody's dead!

30
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:50,608
Let's go!

31
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:51,958
Slide that gun over nicely.

32
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,860
Stay down!

33
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:00,031
(dramatic music)

34
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:01,639
Throw it in the bag.

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,299
- I, I just opened up my window.

36
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,359
I don't have any cash.

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,560
- Well then, you better
get some, get going!

38
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:09,694
What are you looking at?

39
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,978
Back up!

40
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:15,979
Come on, hurry up.

41
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,808
Turn away.

42
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:21,609
Hurry up, you got 10 seconds
or I put one in your brain.

43
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,407
Hey, get down!

44
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,009
Back off!

45
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,010
Come on!

46
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:31,713
Turn away!

47
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,371
What are you looking at?

48
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:38,755
Stay down!

49
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:40,129
Come on.

50
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,130
Back off!

51
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:49,508
(suspenseful music)

52
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,599
All right, all right,
come on, close it up.

53
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,454
That's enough.

54
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:55,455
Woman, move it, move it!

55
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:59,399
(suspenseful music)

56
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,499
Well, you're all very lucky

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,300
because you get to wake up tomorrow.

58
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Have a nice day.

59
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:10,237
(suspenseful music)

60
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:27,507
(car door slamming)

61
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:29,266
(engine revving)

62
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:32,184
(tires screeching)

63
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:37,601
(suspenseful music)

64
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:52,438
(siren wailing)

65
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:00,793
(tires screeching)

66
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:03,544
(sirens wailing)

67
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:19,032
(tires screeching)

68
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,783
(sirens wailing)

69
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,497
(tires screeching)

70
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,067
- [Man] Hey, hey!

71
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,057
No!

72
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:35,292
No, please!

73
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,445
(garbage crashing)

74
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:40,363
(tires screeching)

75
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:44,388
(car crashing)

76
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,271
- Hey, hey, hey!

77
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:49,272
Whoa!

78
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:55,750
(Jeff laughs)

79
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:58,953
(suspenseful music)

80
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:01,787
(water splashing)

81
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:08,130
- Jill, we did it!

82
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:11,996
(Jill squeals)
(Jeff laughs)

83
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,486
(lips smacking)

84
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:16,849
It worked.

85
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,774
It was perfect.

86
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:21,669
I went in there, and I could
hear my heart pounding.

87
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,029
It was such a rush.

88
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,059
Mm.
(lips smacking)

89
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,459
- That's great, but let's
talk about it in the car

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,909
'cause we gotta get outta here.

91
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,910
- Okay.

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,339
I was in that Hyundai
in three seconds flat.

93
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,329
I had it hotwired in five,
and then I don't know.

94
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,099
I just, I hit the wave.

95
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,915
I was in the zone, you know what I mean?

96
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:48,916
Here I was robbing a bank,
and I felt, I don't know.

97
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,609
Serene.

98
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,149
- You were great.

99
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,909
- We were great.

100
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,949
Hey, you wanna see? (laughs)

101
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,899
Come on, I'm gonna buy you a ritzy lunch.

102
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,289
- Shouldn't we get that stuff home first?

103
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,849
- No, I wanna feel what
it's like to lay down cash

104
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,021
for a $100 meal, just like the yuppies.

105
00:07:06,022 --> 00:07:07,379
- Honey, they don't call
'em yuppies anymore.

106
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,380
- Oh, whatever they call 'em.

107
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:10,059
The point is they can
afford to live the life

108
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,489
that I want for us.

109
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,319
So come on, you pick anything.

110
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,856
Morton's?

111
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:17,479
(loud blasting)
(Jill gasping)

112
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
- What was that?

113
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:23,476
(suspenseful music)

114
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
- It's dye.

115
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,039
They planted it.

116
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:39,623
They ruined it.

117
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:44,944
Son of a bitch!

118
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,931
(suspenseful music)

119
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:02,313
(people chattering)
(camera clicking)

120
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,981
(phone ringing)

121
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,519
- Hi, I'm Tom Lasalle, FBI.

122
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,889
Can you tell me if the
surveillance camera was working?

123
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,009
- Always.
- Okay, good.

124
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,539
We're gonna need that video.

125
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,833
Now, can you describe this guy for me?

126
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,240
- He, he was um...

127
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:29,833
I'm sorry, my teeth always
chatter when I'm scared.

128
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,779
- Just take your time, and
I'll help you out here.

129
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,233
Was he short, tall?

130
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:39,441
- Tall.

131
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,455
Over six feet.

132
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:43,759
He, uh...

133
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,843
A nice build.

134
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,799
He had on sunglasses and a Cubs hat.

135
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,469
- And a fake beard.

136
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,079
- Fake?

137
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,359
How do you know the beard was fake?

138
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,795
- My eight-year-old son
just played Abe Lincoln

139
00:08:58,796 --> 00:08:59,967
at Stevenson Elementary,

140
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:02,759
and his beard was a lot
better than this guy's.

141
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,019
- Okay, I want you both to
take a look in this book

142
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,329
and tell me if you can identify the weapon

143
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,057
that he was using.

144
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:09,058
Thank you.

145
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,889
- At least our guy's a Cubs fan.

146
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,026
- This guys a bully and an amateur.

147
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:19,479
- Yeah, all it takes is one guy like this

148
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,632
to give all bank robbers a bad name.

149
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:23,623
- Not to mention Cubs fans.

150
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:29,011
(suspenseful music)

151
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:32,095
(footsteps thudding)

152
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,843
- It's worthless, every single bill.

153
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,226
- Honey, forget about it.

154
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:40,923
Let's just enjoy our dinner.

155
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,370
- Yeah, you're right, I'm sorry.

156
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,689
That's good-looking steak.

157
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,690
- Filet mignon.

158
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:50,169
- [Jeff] Can we afford that?

159
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,723
- After the next bank,
we can afford anything.

160
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,860
- I should have been more careful.

161
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,689
I should have been watching better.

162
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,583
- Honey, it's, you know what?

163
00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:58,859
It's a learning process.

164
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,039
It's like my chem lab.

165
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,149
You gotta work it out till
you find the right formula.

166
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,899
It's all trial and error.

167
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,624
Here, I got you a present.

168
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,625
- Hey.

169
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:18,800
(laughs) Hey, look at that.

170
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:21,632
- I love you.

171
00:10:22,778 --> 00:10:23,861
- I love you.

172
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,989
(lips smacking)

173
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,190
- It was fun, wasn't it?

174
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,450
- It was great.

175
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,849
- Ah, you got it.

176
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,850
- I got it.

177
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,519
- So how's work?

178
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,729
- Oh, it's all right.

179
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,259
I got a wacko robbing banks in a disguise.

180
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,219
Wears a fake beard and a
hat like yours actually.

181
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,969
- Don't let Shaughnessy tell
you how to run the case.

182
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,549
He's a horse's ass!

183
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,929
Woke me up last week, some bull.

184
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,930
- Pop, Pop.

185
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,539
Shaughnessy's dead, you're retired,

186
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,439
and I'm not working the job anymore.

187
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,213
I'm with the Feds, remember?

188
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:13,763
- Yeah, yes, I know that!

189
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,689
Don't talk to me like I'm some brewer.

190
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,523
- Okay.

191
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:19,559
- What'd you get?

192
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,329
- Stuffed deep dish from Muno's.

193
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,089
- Mushrooms, you remember?

194
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,367
- Absolutely, and anchovies.

195
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:26,493
- Good boy.

196
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,139
So wear's a fake beard, huh?

197
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,859
I had a guy like that once,
wore a hippie wig too.

198
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,003
- Yeah, what happened?

199
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,053
- Damned if I remember.

200
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:42,482
(horn honking)

201
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:45,733
(Jill exhaling softly)

202
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,841
(distant dog barking)

203
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:56,350
(Jill exhaling)

204
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,159
- Jill come to bed.

205
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,429
- No, I can't, I have too much energy.

206
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,899
I've gotta work it off.

207
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,569
I checked the street guide.

208
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,904
There are 11 branch banks in
Chicago near an expressway.

209
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:12,563
There's no need to hit the
same municipality twice.

210
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,400
You know what else?

211
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,679
We're too conspicuous.

212
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,809
We need to get one of
those, what do you call it?

213
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,089
Utility vehicles.

214
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,789
We also need to get two getaway cars.

215
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,680
It'll just double our ability

216
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:23,219
to lose the police if they're on a trail.

217
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,409
- Okay, I can steal two cars.

218
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,469
- You know that sharpshooting
badge got in the Marines?

219
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,659
Are you still good enough to
take a surveillance camera?

220
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,769
- A Marine is always ready.

221
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,759
- Great, then all I need to
worry about is the silent alarm.

222
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,059
- Honey, can we do this tomorrow?

223
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,769
I really think you need to take a break.

224
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,720
- No, Jeff, I'm on a roll.

225
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,549
I can feel my blood
running through my veins.

226
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,240
- Exactly, you need some sleep.

227
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:40,799
- No, I can't sleep until I nail this.

228
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,178
- Nail, what?
- The silent alarm!

229
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,023
Damn it, Jeff, pay attention!

230
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,573
Honey, go keep my side
of the bed warm, okay.

231
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:57,594
(Jill exhaling loudly)

232
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,918
(phone ringing)

233
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:19,956
(gunshots blasting)
(people screaming)

234
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,285
- All right, listen up!

235
00:13:22,286 --> 00:13:24,436
This is a police scanner.

236
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,979
So if any one of you decides
to press a silent alarm,

237
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,924
I will hear about it on this.

238
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:33,399
And when I do, I'm gonna start shooting.

239
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,492
Fill up that bag.

240
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:35,326
(woman screams)

241
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:36,964
Shut up, shut up or
you'll never scream again.

242
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:38,215
You understand?

243
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,183
I am watching you, suspender man.

244
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,013
What are you thinking about, move!

245
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,149
You listen to me, you slip
a dye packet in that bag,

246
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,040
and you're gonna be in the obit section

247
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,363
of the Trib tomorrow.

248
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,759
Don't you eyeball me!

249
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Turn away!

250
00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:01,478
Come on!

251
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:04,878
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

252
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,797
Hurry up, that's enough!

253
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,316
Turn away!

254
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:17,183
You count to 100.

255
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:21,423
(suspenseful music)

256
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:59,664
(shoes clacking)

257
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,028
I knew it.

258
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:08,543
(tires screeching)

259
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:11,969
(laughs) I'm telling
you, it was clockwork.

260
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,749
Total clockwork.

261
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,009
You are a genius!

262
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,213
- Yes I am, but do you love me?

263
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:22,029
- Yeah, I love you, Jill.

264
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,868
I love you for your spirit.

265
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:26,101
I love you for your soul.

266
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:27,904
I love you for your will.

267
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:30,738
(objects banging)

268
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:34,957
(sultry rock music)

269
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,839
- I'd say you got a pretty
favorable evaluation.

270
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,059
With one area of exception,
bureau communications.

271
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,950
- Communications?

272
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,312
- It's a diverse organization, Tom.

273
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:56,249
There's a certain methodology
you have to follow.

274
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,509
You've gotta talk the talk
to get where you want to get.

275
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,409
- Well sir, it's a pretty Byzantine system

276
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,159
that wastes a lot of
time that could be spent

277
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,583
doing other things like, I
don't know, fighting crime.

278
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,240
With all due respects, sir.

279
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,209
- Let me put it another way.

280
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,989
This ain't the Chicago police.

281
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,179
It's the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

282
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,245
That implies a certain formal
structure and tradition

283
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:20,503
that you can either accept or reject.

284
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,743
Unfortunately, if you choose the latter,

285
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:27,113
you'll have a very short career.

286
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,209
You know what a blue flamer is?

287
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,469
- No, sir, I can't say that I do.

288
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,159
- It's one of those byzantine FBI terms.

289
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,199
It's used to describe an ambitious agent

290
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,709
whose career takes off like a rocket.

291
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,313
They can either soar to
the top or crash and burn.

292
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,400
- Point taken, sir.

293
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Thank you.

294
00:16:51,517 --> 00:16:52,401
(detective groans)

295
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:53,789
- What was that all about?

296
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,426
- Space travel.
- Excuse me?

297
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:56,509
- You know where I come from,

298
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,359
having been on the
Chicago force is a plus.

299
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,439
Here it's a debit, what is that?

300
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,949
- Hey wait up, I've got news.

301
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,810
- What?

302
00:17:03,811 --> 00:17:04,909
- The guy with the beard and the cap

303
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,419
just robbed another bank.

304
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,410
Guess what?

305
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:09,439
Not only did he shoot out
the surveillance cameras,

306
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,609
but he brought a police scanner this time.

307
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,755
- Police scanner?
- Yep.

308
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:14,932
What do you think?

309
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,369
- I think he went from
being dangerous and dumb

310
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,653
to dangerous and smart.

311
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:23,102
(people chattering)

312
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,089
- Can you come take a look at this, Jill?

313
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,090
It's not working.

314
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:32,449
- Did you load your standards?

315
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,339
- Put them both in the outside
lanes, just like you said.

316
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,173
- Let me see.

317
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:37,080
Oh, here's your problem.

318
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,192
You didn't pour the gel right.

319
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:40,189
See, if the cross linkings too high,

320
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,029
then the proteins can't penetrate.

321
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,430
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

322
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:46,849
Hey.
- Hey.

323
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,369
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, I was early.

324
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,989
I thought I'd stop by.

325
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,129
This place always makes me feel so in awe.

326
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:53,963
- Of what?

327
00:17:53,964 --> 00:17:55,949
- Oh, science, of you.

328
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,850
Hey, I flunked chemistry.

329
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,850
I never could figure it out.

330
00:17:57,851 --> 00:18:00,339
It always looked like fun though.

331
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,173
- It is.

332
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:02,160
You know, I could teach you.

333
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,000
- Really?
- Really.

334
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:04,583
- Thanks for staying to help out.

335
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,109
- Oh, no problem.

336
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,469
You remember my husband Jeff.

337
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,303
- Of course, how are you?

338
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:09,949
- Good.
- Still a policeman?

339
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,829
- No, I'm in business for myself now.

340
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,830
- Really, what?

341
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,749
- Honey, we're gonna be late.

342
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,829
- Some other time, Jeff.

343
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,409
Nice seeing you again.

344
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,699
Oh, Jill.

345
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,609
The state evaluation committee
confirmed for next Friday.

346
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,679
The way your work is going.

347
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,475
I think the department's
a shoe in for that grant.

348
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:27,999
- Really?

349
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,849
- Your wife has a first-class mind.

350
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,429
- Don't I know it.

351
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,857
- See you tomorrow.

352
00:18:33,768 --> 00:18:36,768
(suspenseful music)

353
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:45,013
(engine revving)

354
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:52,124
(suspenseful music)

355
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:10,968
(tires rumbling)

356
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:13,886
(tires screeching)

357
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:21,317
(car door slams)

358
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:24,318
(suspenseful music)

359
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:29,633
(car door slams)

360
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:32,301
(siren wailing)

361
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:40,448
(footsteps thudding)

362
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:43,366
(tires screeching)

363
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:52,518
(footsteps thudding)

364
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:55,352
(thrilling music)

365
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,719
- Hey, bearded wonder strikes again.

366
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,689
Local cops in pursuit,
and our guys on foot.

367
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,779
- How far from here?
- Two miles.

368
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,730
You wanna give it a shot?

369
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:04,109

a guy come through here

with a beard and a Cubs cap?

Kerry came through here

405
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,722
looking for Ernie Banks.

406
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:28,459

407
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,059
We got an armed psychotic
running amuck as we speak.

Can you help me?

410
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,279

417
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,119
Well, those dancers seem nice.

418
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,360

423
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:19,009
- A tire went flat.

424
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,639
I had to run for it.

425
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,759
Ooh, I almost bought it.

426
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,271

What, what is it?

429
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:27,548
- I'm just thinking, baby.

430
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:29,179
They can't touch us.

431
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,749
We're just too good.

432
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,755
Hey, it's all for you.

433
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:34,876
- How much?
- I don't know.

434
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:36,386
I didn't have time to count it.

435
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:37,220
- [Jill] Oh my God.

436
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:39,282
- But we are on our way, baby doll!

437
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:40,837
(Jill squeals)
(Jeff laughs)

438
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:41,996
- Well, it looks like being in business

439
00:23:41,997 --> 00:23:43,562
for yourself agrees with you.

440
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,146
- Yeah.
- Come here.

441
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:47,579
(lips smacking)

442
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,219
Wow, oh my God.

443
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,529
Look at all this money.

444
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,309
- Ooh, look at this, a little more.

445
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,209
Oh, hey, just a little more.

446
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,908
Oh, there's a little more.
(Jill squeals)

447
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:57,398
Oh, and there's just a little more, hey!

448
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:58,898
(Jill squeals)

449
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,194
- Can we afford diamonds?

450
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:02,163
- Yes, we can.

451
00:24:02,164 --> 00:24:04,480
- Can we afford furs?

452
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:05,789
- Yes, we can.

453
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,278
- Can we afford...
- Yes, we can.

454
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,392
- We can?
- Yes.

455
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:10,546
- Yes, yes, we can?
- Yes, we can.

456
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:11,866
Yes, we can.

457
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,789
Hey, yes, we can, hey!

458
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,977
Yes, we can.

459
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:15,978
Yes, we...

460
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:23,537
(children chattering)
(dog barking)

461
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:25,781
- So my parents are going
through divorce proceedings,

462
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:28,562
and my sister decides that
she'll take me to this bar.

463
00:24:28,563 --> 00:24:30,492
And she leaves me alone with this guy,

464
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:33,349
just a real jerk who eventually
loses interest in me.

465
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,250
And he leaves me alone.

466
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:35,949
So now I'm sitting there by myself.

467
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,783
I'm a nervous wreck.

468
00:24:36,784 --> 00:24:39,476
I'm on the verge of tears,
and it's my birthday.

469
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,025
- Jill, that's so sad.

470
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:44,019
- She was like this little wounded bird.

471
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,559
So fragile.

472
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,009
So beautiful.

473
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,559
- Jeff was watching the whole time.

474
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,919
- Well, but I didn't want
to just bust in, you know.

475
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,917
Only now she's alone and
she's looking so sad.

476
00:24:53,918 --> 00:24:56,479
So I get up the courage, and
I go over and I sit down.

477
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,712
- You know what he says?

478
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:00,429
Nothing. (laughs)

479
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,959
He just walks over and
takes me in his arms.

480
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,699
This total stranger just
takes me in his arms.

481
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,085
And that's where I've been ever since.

482
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:07,086
- Oh.

483
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:11,887
(lips smacking)

484
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:13,859
(dog barking)

485
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,969
- So what'd you do
after the Marines, Jeff?

486
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,519
- Oh, this and that.

487
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,489
I was a police officer for a while.

488
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,441
- Really?
- Yeah.

489
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:24,955
But I didn't have the personality.

490
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,909
You know, I'd stop somebody
for a routine traffic violation

491
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,639
and I felt like I was
harassing him, you know.

492
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,191
I never had the heart to
give the guy a ticket.

493
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:34,299
I guess I always had a
problem with authority.

494
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,100
So when I became the authority,
I felt like a hypocrite.

495
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,163
- So now you own a bookstore?

496
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,269
It's a pretty tough business, isn't it?

497
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,899
- It can be, yeah.

498
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,689
Hey, the chicken's almost done.

499
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,529
Jill, why don't you give Ed
and Debbie some more wine?

500
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,500
- Okay.

501
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:49,579
- None for me, thanks.

502
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,259
Doctor's orders.

503
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,529
- What's it like?

504
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,819
- Not drinking?

505
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,428
Boring.

506
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,459
- Being pregnant.

507
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,699
- Well, aside from feeling like someone's

508
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,843
stepping on your kidney,
it's pretty great.

509
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,859
- Jill, I think Ed would
like some more wine.

510
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,073
- Oh, I'm sorry.

511
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:09,745
Here you go.

512
00:26:09,746 --> 00:26:12,943
- Hey Ed, take a look at these babies.

513
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,510
- [Ed] Pretty nice.

514
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:16,869
- [Jeff] Yeah, you gotta have some toys.

515
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,099
(dog barking)

516
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,729
- You know, I read somewhere the other day

517
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,709
that these big chain bookstores

518
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,311
are killing off all the independents.

519
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:27,869
- Well, we deal mainly in
used books and periodicals,

520
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,970
so it's not a problem.

521
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,510
I've got some money put away.

522
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Inheritance.

523
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,999
It's kind of hard to talk
about though, you know?

524
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,289
- Yeah.

525
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,969
Well, hey, welcome to the neighborhood.

526
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,159
I think you're gonna like it here.

527
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,709
- Already do.

528
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,729
Well, here's to finally
having a house of our own.

529
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,849
(glasses clinking)

530
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,649
Oh, I'm sorry, Jill!

531
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,989
Are they okay?

532
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,299
- Traffic along Michigan
Avenue is slow this morning

533
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,549
due to repairs on a broken
water main in Downtown Chicago.

534
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,649
A spokesman for the construction firm

535
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,409
predicts the work will
continue through the weekend.

536
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,709
- [TV Announcer] Protesters
are expected in Daly Plaza

537
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,529
this afternoon following last
night's city council decision

538
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,586
to delay action on proposals
for increased safety patrols

539
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:12,569
in the Cabrini Green housing project.

540
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,649
- We're still a few months
away from baseball season,

541
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,269
but at least one Cubs fan is
already showing the colors.

542
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,389
The bank robber dubbed The
Bearded Bandit struck yesterday

543
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,029
for the fifth time.

544
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,149
On all five occasions, he
has sported, what else?

545
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,879
A Cubs baseball cap.

546
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,209
- Well, Brenda, at least
we know his heart's

547
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,110
in the right place.

548
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,943
- That it is.

549
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,699
- You're an idiot, Phil.
- Coming up next on WXTW,

550
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,290
Chicago 8, we'll be going...

551
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,319
- What are we drinking today, Captain?

552
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,250
- [Father] I'll have the usual.

553
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:38,799
Bring the kid a root beer.

554
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,633
- Yeah, right.

555
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:41,029
You got a dark ale, Pat?

556
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,030
- Big shot.

557
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:44,759
- Pop, you said you had a guy once

558
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,693
used a beard in a bank heist?

559
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,939
- Why are you asking?

560
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,529
You writing a book on my exploits?

561
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:56,129
- This guy, my guy, he's
knocking over banks like crazy.

562
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,409
Now he's becoming a celebrity.

563
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,439
He's making me look very bad.

564
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,413
I don't know, I just
thought you might be able

565
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:03,109
to tell me something I could use.

566
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,909
- A long time ago, Tommy,
but I can tell you this.

567
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,113
Bank robbers are a different breed.

568
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:09,990
- In what way?

569
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:11,609
- Think about it.

570
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:14,618
Your average burglar works
in the middle of the night.

571
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:17,349
White collar guys do it with paper,

572
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,239
both quiet like and behind the scenes.

573
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,693
But bank robbers, they like the show.

574
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,739
The customers as the audience.

575
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,877
The beard and the wig?

576
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:30,663
The costume, it's a bust-out line of work.

577
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,600
- They want attention.

578
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,229
- They want respect publicly.

579
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,410
They want to be feared
and admired all at once.

580
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,079
- Well, what about the cap?

581
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Why that one?

582
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:49,213
- Like anybody else, he
just wants to belong.

583
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,879
There's something everybody looks up to.

584
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,233
Only with him, it means even more.

585
00:28:58,433 --> 00:28:59,593
- That's amazing, Pop.

586
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,689
You come in here, you get
down with your cronies.

587
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,563
It's like your sharp as the old days.

588
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,839
- Yeah, that last rain really
did a number on your roof.

589
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,159
- Yeah, how bad?

590
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,459
- Take a look.

591
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,019
It's been leaking for a long time.

592
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,199
A lot of those joists are
almost rotted through.

593
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,789
- Well, can I get away without a new roof?

594
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,919
- Well, the problem is,

595
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,699
even if I flash it and do some patches...

596
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,069
- It'll just get worse.

597
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,479
- Oh, excuse me.

598
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,230
I give up, I have looked everywhere

599
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:31,209
and there is no Dylan Thomas.

600
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,499
- I'll check the reference guide.

601
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,469
- You mean you don't know if you have it?

602
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,711
- No, I'm not a walking computer, lady.

603
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:37,669
I'm just a working stiff unlike you.

604
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,289
So just relax and I'll
look the damn thing up.

605
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,290
- Don't bother.

606
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,589
- You know, none of my business, pal,

607
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,433
but I think you gotta work
on your bedside manner.

608
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,099
- The deductible on this policy is so big,

609
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,139
I gotta practically pay for
a whole new roof myself.

610
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,589
(sighs) Insurance companies
are the criminals.

611
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,249
I'll tell you that.

612
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,603
Corporations, the IRS.

613
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,059
I mean, think about it.

614
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,509
What is the difference
between us and them, huh?

615
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,510
I mean, really?

616
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,849
Jill what's the matter?

617
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,263
- Just one of my phases.

618
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,633
It'll pass, like always.

619
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,209
But Jeff, we're gonna have
to start robbing bigger banks

620
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,614
or more of them.

621
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:28,769
- [Jeff] What do you mean?

622
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,509
- I mean, after every
job we think we have it

623
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,393
made in the shade, but we don't.

624
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,203
We have a mortgage now, a new business.

625
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,099
- [Jeff] Well, we'll just
have to score bigger, I guess.

626
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,149
- That's what I'm saying.

627
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,150
We'll have to.

628
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,643
And then we'll have to
continue to have to, forever.

629
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,583
- Whoa, honey, hang on.

630
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
This is natural.

631
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,333
We're just trying to figure
out the little irregularities.

632
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,210
- Not so little.

633
00:31:02,211 --> 00:31:03,865
- Sure they are.

634
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:06,583
Hey, it's like you told
me, it's trial and error.

635
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,120
We can make this work, Jill.

636
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,483
(fingers snapping)

637
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:12,809
I know what'll make you feel better.

638
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,688
Come on, let's get you're coat.

639
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:16,235
There we go.

640
00:31:16,236 --> 00:31:19,069
(thrilling music)

641
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:25,412
(motorcycle engine humming)

642
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:38,329
(gunshots blasting)
(glass shattering)

643
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:45,856
- Whoa!

644
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:48,011
- (laughs) Feel better?

645
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:49,012
- A little bit!

646
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,000
- You just need a good night's sleep,

647
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:52,619
and you'll be your old self again.

648
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,509
- Yeah, who was that?

649
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,743
- Beautiful lonely girl in a
bar who turned into my wife.

650
00:31:57,744 --> 00:32:01,852
(gunshots blasting)
(glass shattering)

651
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,369
- I guess we're pretty lucky.

652
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,520
- Yeah, I guess we are.

653
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,909
We're getting by on our own terms, Jill.

654
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,809
That's what this country's
all about, isn't it?

655
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,609
The individual making it?

656
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,153
- We're robbing banks, Jeff.

657
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,679
- Yeah, 'cause I got fired
by some stupid bureaucracy

658
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,733
when we were $19,000 in debt.

659
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,699
We weren't meant to live like monks, Jill.

660
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,549
Besides nobody's getting hurt.

661
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,459
Money's insured by bigger
criminals than we are.

662
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,563
No big deal.

663
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,949
- You know that night in the
bar when I first met you,

664
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,899
you know what I was thinking about

665
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,995
right before you walked in?

666
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:36,996
I was thinking about how to kill myself.

667
00:32:39,135 --> 00:32:41,899
(thrilling music)

668
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
You saved my life.

669
00:32:44,469 --> 00:32:47,302
(thrilling music)

670
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:53,764
(vault clanks)

671
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:56,849
- There you go, that wasn't so hard.

672
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,006
Well, you know what?

673
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:00,963
You wasted too much of my time!

674
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:03,169
- Please.

675
00:33:04,422 --> 00:33:06,922
(Jeff laughs)

676
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,873
- Relax.

677
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:11,867
When I'm gone, you can
take the rest of the day

678
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:13,899
off to celebrate.

679
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,900
You're not dead.

680
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,824
Fill up that bag.

681
00:33:19,825 --> 00:33:20,825
Get going.

682
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,198
- [Officer] Crime lab, I'll get it for ya.

683
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,866
(radio chatter)

684
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,306
- Let me see.
- It's not.

685
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:32,974
- No?
- Well, it's...

686
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,169
Well, that looks like it.

687
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,170
- This one?
- Yeah.

688
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:38,633
It's, I can't be sure,
but it's pretty close.

689
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:42,969
I really lost my composure in there.

690
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,959
I just thought I'd be cooler
in a situation like that.

691
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,669
He was ready to shoot.

692
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,640
It was no bluff.

693
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,473
- How do you know?

694
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:50,799
- His eyes.

695
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,709
- You said he was wearing shades.

696
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,789
How did you see his eyes?

697
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,255
- Well, I couldn't.

698
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:56,727
I felt them.

699
00:33:56,728 --> 00:33:59,089
- Okay, thank you.

700
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,097
- Tom.
- Yo.

701
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:02,279
- We may have the getaway car.

702
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,650
- Let's get outta here.

703
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,510
- [Officer] Clear!

704
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:10,702
(radio chatter)

705
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,455
- [Tom] Okay, thanks.

706
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:19,399
- [Man] Actually it was the
guy that came around there.

707
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,379
- Wow, it's all jacked up.

708
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,220
- No prints.

709
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:25,679
- Well, he's been meticulous
about wearing his gloves.

710
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,002
- Are you with the FBI?

711
00:34:27,003 --> 00:34:28,199
- That's correct.

712
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,539
- What can you tell us about the search

713
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,520
for the Bearded Bandit?

714
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:33,042
- That a thorough and vigorous
investigation is underway.

715
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:35,159
- Has his popularity hindered
that investigation at all?

716
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,889
- Look, he's popular to the media.

717
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,199
To us, he's a thug who carries a gun.

718
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,029
Then he sticks it in people's
faces and steals their money.

719
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,289
Then he drives around like a
maniac through their streets

720
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,429
in broad daylight
endangering even more lives.

721
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,033
You made him into a hero.

722
00:34:51,742 --> 00:34:53,895
Is that a hindrance?

723
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:54,959
No, not really.

724
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,360
It's just a pain in the ass.

725
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,540
- Thank you.

726
00:34:59,823 --> 00:35:01,909
- Okay, there's one security guy.

727
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,780
He looks about 16.

728
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:03,969
I bet his gun's not even real.

729
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,349
Did you study this floor plan?

730
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,379
- [Jeff] Twice, Jill, and relax.

731
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,169
- Yeah, I will, after we have the money.

732
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,742
Now, you know the off ramp
is four blocks to the east,

733
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:11,389
but the merging lane is really short now

734
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,223
because of road work.

735
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:13,130
That thing you stole have pickup?

736
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,010
- It's fine, I tested it.

737
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,593
- Would you put that new
toy down for one minute

738
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:16,470
and just look at me?

739
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:17,924
This is not about guns,
this is about banks.

740
00:35:17,925 --> 00:35:19,669
- I know that honey, but without the gun,

741
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,479
there's no bank, right?

742
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,013
- Right, okay, time to go.

743
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,369
- Jill, are you all right?

744
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,370
- Fine, you ready?

745
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:31,367
(suspenseful music)

746
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,959
The parking is lousy,
there's a self parking lot

747
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,793
across the street.

748
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:39,650
- I got it, Jill.

749
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,650
I got it.

750
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:43,119
- What's the matter?

751
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,389
- Well, I'm a little worried about you.

752
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,589
I mean, you're wired for sound.

753
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,713
- Don't worry about me,
just worry about you.

754
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:48,356
I'm fine.

755
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:50,259
- All right, I'll see you at the off ramp.

756
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,168
- Norris West.

757
00:35:51,169 --> 00:35:52,847
- West, right.

758
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:57,294
(car door slams)

759
00:35:57,295 --> 00:36:00,295
(suspenseful music)

760
00:36:08,003 --> 00:36:13,003
(car door slams)
(engine revs)

761
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,458
(engine revs)

762
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:26,459
(suspenseful music)

763
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:41,052
(workers chattering)

764
00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:45,525
(suspenseful music)

765
00:36:57,536 --> 00:37:00,119
(horn honking)

766
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,990
- [Jill] Jeff!

767
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,856
- [Jeff] What is it, what's the matter?

768
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,349
- I just remembered that
the Norris East ramp

769
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,439
is closed because of construction.

770
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,228
You have to use the west ramp.

771
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:18,679
- Jill, we already agreed on the west ramp

772
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,763
because of the construction, remember?

773
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,499
- Wait, what, what are you doing?

774
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,519
- [Jeff] I'm taking us home.

775
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,237
- I'm sorry, I don't know what's wrong.

776
00:37:29,238 --> 00:37:30,347
I screwed this whole thing up.

777
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,939
What's happening to me?

778
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,656
- I don't know, baby,
but it's gonna be okay.

779
00:37:34,657 --> 00:37:36,736
I'm gonna take care of you.

780
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:39,320
(tool buzzing)

781
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:44,014
(suspenseful music)

782
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:53,754
(siren wailing)

783
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:03,066
(Jeff groans)

784
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,500
(sighs) Oh God.

785
00:38:15,814 --> 00:38:18,314
(dog barking)

786
00:38:22,738 --> 00:38:25,405
(door creaking)

787
00:38:29,178 --> 00:38:30,866
(dog barking)

788
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:32,653
Jill, what are you doing?

789
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:37,899
- Oh, hi, I just, I meant to
get the car washed earlier,

790
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,059
but I got busy, I didn't
have a chance to do it.

791
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,579
And then I just couldn't sleep.

792
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,739
So I was just thinking about
how dirty this car was.

793
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,859
So I just thought I'd come out here,

794
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,693
and I'd just get it done real...

795
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:46,923
- Jill, stop.

796
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,280
- Do you think I'm going crazy?

797
00:38:54,463 --> 00:38:55,463
- No.

798
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,620
- Then what is it?

799
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,149
- I don't know, honey.

800
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,007
But we're gonna find out, I promise you.

801
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:09,573
(dog barking)

802
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,108
- Manic depression is a treatable illness,

803
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:18,553
but it needs to be managed correctly.

804
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,749
I'd like to start you on
some medication, Jill.

805
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,393
On an inpatient basis.

806
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,594
- You mean in the hospital?

807
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:29,514
- Yes.

808
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:31,605
You see, it usually takes a while

809
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:34,209
to work out the right dosage.

810
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,403
That's better monitored on the premises.

811
00:39:37,816 --> 00:39:40,839
You're close to being in a crisis state.

812
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,615
So I think that the structure
we can offer you here,

813
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,209
along with the observation
and the counseling

814
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,713
would be very beneficial.

815
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:48,714
- How long?

816
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,039
- Three or four weeks.

817
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,099
We'll monitor the progress
and take it from there.

818
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,889
- What about my work at the lab?

819
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,415
- You're on the verge
of a breakdown, Jill.

820
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,383
You need to think about yourself.

821
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:04,759
(phone ringing)

822
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
- What about Jeff?

823
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,880
- He can visit.

824
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,939
I don't necessarily think it's a good idea

825
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,640
for him to visit every day though.

826
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,909
- Why not?

827
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,619
- Any illness like this
requires a certain amount

828
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,373
of self-examination and understanding.

829
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,929
And that's always better done away

830
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,963
from the family or spouse.

831
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,509
It's for the best, Jeff.

832
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,510
Really.

833
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,910
- Yeah, I get it.

834
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,516
- So are there any other stresses

835
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:41,123
or problems we haven't talked about?

836
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,809
- I can't think of any.

837
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,810
Jill?

838
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,390
- No.

839
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:55,097
- Well, I can admit you today.

840
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:59,599
Most policies provide up to 30
days, so you should be fine.

841
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,743
- Doesn't matter, money is no object.

842
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,469
Whatever it takes to make Jill better.

843
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,169
We're doing real well, and I
can't think of a better way

844
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,520
to spend the money, doctor.

845
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:11,275
- Good.

846
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,399
- What I don't get is the guy who

847
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,459
robbed the first bank was a cowboy,

848
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,429
a bust-out impulse freak.

849
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,879
But each robbery since then has been

850
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,049
more carefully thought
out than the one before.

851
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,369
- That's what I've been telling you.

852
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,009
They're copycats, smarter ones.

853
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,039
- Nah, I don't know if I buy that.

854
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,639
- What makes you so sure that it isn't?

855
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,499
- There's been no activity
for the last three weeks.

856
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,439
If they were copycats,
they'd be out there working.

857
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,109
You gonna eat those fries?

858
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,973
- Oh, they were cold 10 minutes ago.

859
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,327
- Excuse me.

860
00:41:40,328 --> 00:41:44,203
Can we get another order
of fries and a Greek salad?

861
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,210
Thanks.

862
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,290
What?

863
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,689
Salad's healthy.

864
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,289
- Tom, you passed
healthy about 11 o'clock.

865
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,461
- Yeah, well, that's genetic.

866
00:41:55,462 --> 00:41:56,295
(partner laughs)

867
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:59,239
Anyhow, each of the recent robberies

868
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,889
has taken place on a Monday.

869
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,189
I think that's key.

870
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,223
- What, you have a hunch?

871
00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:05,573
- Go with me on this.

872
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:09,529
Barber shops are closed on Mondays, right?

873
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,639
- You think he's a hairdresser?

874
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,159
- No, not necessarily.

875
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,739
I'm just saying that I
think Monday's his day off.

876
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,489
- Oh, that really narrows the field.

877
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,059
He robs banks.

878
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,789
What makes you so sure
that he's got a job?

879
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,899
- He blends in somehow.

880
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,869
Seriously, we should check
out all the businesses

881
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,919
that are closed on Mondays.

882
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,083
Barber shops, restaurants, theaters.

883
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,110
You got a better idea?

884
00:42:31,111 --> 00:42:35,101
- No, maybe you've got something.

885
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:37,319
- I'll tell you something
else, I think it's a team.

886
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,469
- A team.
- Yeah.

887
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,320
- Why?

888
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:40,359
- Gets away too easily.

889
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,169
He's definitely got
someone driving for him.

890
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,241
Besides, this guy's a peacock.

891
00:42:45,242 --> 00:42:47,569
You know, loves to show off.

892
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,229
A partner would appreciate his efforts.

893
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,522
- Like I appreciate yours.

894
00:42:51,523 --> 00:42:52,523
- Right.

895
00:42:56,447 --> 00:42:58,080
You think this looks like me?

896
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,483
This cute guy with the badge?

897
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,213
- No, he's got more hair.

898
00:43:06,414 --> 00:43:09,081
(dog barking)

899
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:12,082
(suspenseful music)

900
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,613
(water splashing)

901
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:35,530
(footsteps thudding)

902
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,498
- Sir, visiting hours ended at nine.

903
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:45,859
- Well, I just wanna see my wife.

904
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,519
- Well, maybe you can come back tomorrow.

905
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,649
- Look, I pay through the
nose for her care, okay?

906
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,849
I work late, I want to see her now.

907
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:53,999
- Sir, think of your wife,
it's almost midnight.

908
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,860
She's asleep.

909
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:57,009
- Jill hasn't fallen asleep
before dawn in five years.

910
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,260
That's why she's in here.

911
00:44:01,258 --> 00:44:03,841
(somber music)

912
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:07,348
She looks so peaceful.

913
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:15,842
Could you see that she
gets these in the morning?

914
00:44:15,843 --> 00:44:17,510
Tell her I love her.

915
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:23,191
Thank you.

916
00:44:24,988 --> 00:44:27,738
(birds chirping)

917
00:44:37,751 --> 00:44:38,780
- Hi, baby!

918
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:39,888
- Hey!

919
00:44:39,889 --> 00:44:42,369
(Jill squealing)
(lips smacking)

920
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,283
- God, I missed you!

921
00:44:43,284 --> 00:44:44,679
I don't think I've been away from you

922
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,656
for a whole week before.

923
00:44:45,657 --> 00:44:46,738
- Are you doing all right?

924
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:48,029
- Yeah.

925
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,853
Yeah, everybody's really nice here.

926
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,243
It's just, I'm afraid, Jeff.

927
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:02,235
- Afraid of what?

928
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,099
- Dr. Anspach doesn't
think I should see you

929
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,915
until I get outta here.

930
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:09,599
She thinks I have some kind
of dependence thing on you.

931
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,339
I keep telling everybody
it's not dependence.

932
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,402
It's love.

933
00:45:13,403 --> 00:45:15,999
- Well, what do you mean everybody?

934
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,343
- We have these group therapy sessions.

935
00:45:18,344 --> 00:45:20,719
Everybody shares their problems.

936
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,879
Everybody has an opinion.

937
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,869
And my group thinks that you

938
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,839
have some kind of control over me.

939
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,673
- Wait a minute, you're sitting around

940
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:30,239
with a bunch of strangers
talking about our lives?

941
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,297
- Well, that's what
this place is all about.

942
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:35,363
If I don't talk about my
problems then I never get...

943
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:38,999
Oh honey, I would never
say anything about that.

944
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,199
- Well, who knows what you'd say?

945
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,533
They might put you under
hypnosis or something.

946
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,120
- You're right.

947
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,410
I should leave.

948
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:51,349
Besides, that chem lab's probably just

949
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,183
falling apart without me.

950
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:53,799
- No, you can't leave, Jill.

951
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
It's helping you.

952
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,639
The other night when I saw you sleeping,

953
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,299
it was so beautiful.

954
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,009
- Hmm, I am rested.

955
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,813
Never felt like this before.

956
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,010
- Well, then you have to stay.

957
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:10,903
- No, it's no good.

958
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,319
Dr. Anspach says I've been
holding back on my feelings.

959
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,070
And I realize now that I have been.

960
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,049
I'll never be able to
let go in here, Jeff.

961
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,050
So what's the point?

962
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:24,460
I have the medication,
that's what's helping.

963
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,263
It's time for you and me
to get back to our lives.

964
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:36,386
(thrilling music)

965
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,470
- Okay, I'll meet you at the river point.

966
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:52,330
You all right?

967
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,270
- Better than ever.

968
00:46:56,622 --> 00:46:59,729
(thrilling music)

969
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,059
It's okay.

970
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,757
Good luck, I love you.

971
00:47:02,758 --> 00:47:05,671
- I love you.
(lips smacking)

972
00:47:05,672 --> 00:47:08,505
(thrilling music)

973
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:29,269
(radio chatter)

974
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,103
- What happened to Lanford?

975
00:47:30,104 --> 00:47:31,599
I thought we were on Lanford.

976
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,053
- We were, it changes to Oak.

977
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,669
- I will never get this straight.

978
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,809
- I guarantee you'll
have this all down cold

979
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,409
by the time you start working dispatch.

980
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,899
It's just...

981
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,733
Uh oh.

982
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,961
Expired plates on that Mazda.

983
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:47,079
You get to witness the
actual issuing of a ticket.

984
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,080
Excited?

985
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:53,188
(siren wailing)

986
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,739
(tires screeching)

987
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,349
This guy's either stupid or spooked.

988
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,350
Wait here.

989
00:48:20,893 --> 00:48:23,400
(radio chatter)

990
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,401
(suspenseful music)

991
00:48:27,714 --> 00:48:28,572
(woman squeals)

992
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,715
(rifle blasting)
(window shattering)

993
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:33,601
- Back up, back up, get us outta here!

994
00:48:33,602 --> 00:48:37,160
(rifle blasting)

995
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:39,795
(tires screeching)

996
00:48:39,796 --> 00:48:42,799
(car crashing)

997
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,393
(rifle blasting)
(officer groaning)

998
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:50,394
(woman screaming)
(rifle blasting)

999
00:48:52,178 --> 00:48:54,859
(dog barking)

1000
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,693
(thrilling music)

1001
00:49:04,804 --> 00:49:06,214
Hello?

1002
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:09,465
Hello, somebody please help us, please!

1003
00:49:10,521 --> 00:49:11,604
Officer down.

1004
00:49:12,924 --> 00:49:15,007
Please, somebody help us.

1005
00:49:18,802 --> 00:49:19,802
Please.

1006
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:24,472
(suspenseful music)

1007
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:41,351
(tires screeching)

1008
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:50,666
(boat horn honking)

1009
00:49:52,029 --> 00:49:54,529
(Jeff groans)

1010
00:49:56,297 --> 00:49:58,880
(Jeff panting)

1011
00:50:12,084 --> 00:50:14,245
(water splashing)

1012
00:50:14,246 --> 00:50:17,246
(suspenseful music)

1013
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,641
(engine revving)

1014
00:50:26,642 --> 00:50:29,559
(tires screeching)

1015
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:35,743
(water splashing)

1016
00:50:44,573 --> 00:50:47,573
(suspenseful music)

1017
00:50:49,353 --> 00:50:51,932
(water splashing)

1018
00:50:51,933 --> 00:50:52,933
- Jeff!

1019
00:50:54,673 --> 00:50:55,760
Jeff!

1020
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:56,844
Are you okay?

1021
00:50:58,374 --> 00:50:59,752
- I'm fine.

1022
00:50:59,753 --> 00:51:02,086
- What is it, what happened?

1023
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,829
Huh?

1024
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:05,663
Damn it, Jeff.

1025
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:06,496
Will you tell me what the hell happened?

1026
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,298
- I shot a cop.

1027
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:09,510
- Oh my Good.

1028
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:10,928
Did you kill him?

1029
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,909
- I don't know.

1030
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:15,259
- Why?
- Because I had to.

1031
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,170
- But why?

1032
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:17,529
- Why do you think, Jill?

1033
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:18,922
It was him or me, he pulled a gun on me.

1034
00:51:18,923 --> 00:51:21,209
What the hell was I supposed to do, huh?

1035
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,179
Get shot, surrender?

1036
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,979
Would you rather be attending my funeral?

1037
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,813
- How can you say that?

1038
00:51:25,814 --> 00:51:27,539
- How can you accuse me?
- I am not accusing you!

1039
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,920
I am trying to find out what happened!

1040
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:33,233
(Jeff panting)

1041
00:51:33,234 --> 00:51:34,734
- I'm sorry, baby.

1042
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:37,732
I screwed up big time.

1043
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:38,741
Oh, please forgive me.

1044
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:40,259
- It's okay, okay, there's
nothing to forgive, honey.

1045
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,319
You're here with me, you're fine.

1046
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,280
Let's go get in the car, Jeff.

1047
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,266
Come on, get in the car.

1048
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,739
We gotta get outta here.

1049
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,989
- Okay, we haven't been able
to interview Officer Dixon.

1050
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:48,769
He's still in critical condition,

1051
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,079
but the dispatcher trainee
who was riding along

1052
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,709
said the guy just stepped
out of his vehicle

1053
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,899
and opened up on him
with an assault rifle.

1054
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,229
- You think he's your guy?

1055
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,229
- Well, the ride along gave
us a pretty good description.

1056
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:01,479
Big guy, over six feet, bushy
beard, wearing a Cubs cap.

1057
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,750
Oh, then there's this.

1058
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:05,619
This was found in an abandoned Mazda

1059
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,529
not far from the shooting.

1060
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,739
We're working on finding out who

1061
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,219
manufactures this particular
brand of fake beard

1062
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,533
and who distributes it
in the Chicago area.

1063
00:52:13,534 --> 00:52:14,739
- What about prints?

1064
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,729
- No, nothing usable yet.

1065
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,469
- Okay, here's a list of all the cars he's

1066
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,509
stolen that we know about.

1067
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,349
He seems to use Japanese cars exclusively.

1068
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,439
So let's get going on
a list of all the ones

1069
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,679
that have been stolen in
the area in the last year.

1070
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,683
And make sure that all the
officers in your departments

1071
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:32,299
are alert to any vehicle
that looks abandoned

1072
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,976
or suspicious in any way.

1073
00:52:33,977 --> 00:52:35,059
(phones ringing)

1074
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,989
Okay, ballistics.

1075
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,489
Thank you.

1076
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,459
He seems to be primarily using a shotgun.

1077
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,845
Although some of our witnesses
have seen .38 caliber

1078
00:52:43,846 --> 00:52:46,309
and nine millimeter handguns as well.

1079
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,089
And now he's sporting an assault rifle.

1080
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,989
So clearly this guy is
some sort of gun freak

1081
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,259
with the arsenal to prove it.

1082
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:54,519
So let's check out all the gun
shows and all the gun shops,

1083
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,083
particularly the ones that
are closed on Mondays.

1084
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,133
It's just a hunch I'm working on.

1085
00:53:04,043 --> 00:53:05,043
- Jeff?

1086
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:07,950
I need to know.

1087
00:53:10,865 --> 00:53:12,173
Were you shooting to kill?

1088
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,063
- I'm a moral person.

1089
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,163
I'd put my values up against anybody.

1090
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,460
I'm not some...

1091
00:53:28,012 --> 00:53:30,449
(sighs) Some what, some CEO who

1092
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,569
gives himself a 30 million salary

1093
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:35,119
and runs his company into bankruptcy.

1094
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,051
I'm not some tobacco executive
selling poison to teenagers.

1095
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:39,885
- I know that, but...

1096
00:53:39,886 --> 00:53:42,437
- I mean, have I ever given
you any reason to doubt

1097
00:53:42,438 --> 00:53:45,459
that I'm a caring person
or that I'm devoted to you?

1098
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,293
- No.

1099
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:48,809
- Or even that I would kill for you?

1100
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,839
- I never wanted that.

1101
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,290
- [Jeff] Well, neither did I.

1102
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,340
- Are you sure?

1103
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,080
- I don't know.

1104
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,300
- Jeff, don't pull away from me.

1105
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,023
I need you now.

1106
00:54:11,273 --> 00:54:13,260
- (sighs) I need to take a walk.

1107
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:17,068
(door creaking)

1108
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:24,980
(fork clangs)

1109
00:54:24,981 --> 00:54:26,138
(woman shouting)

1110
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:27,779
- What's the matter with you today, kid?

1111
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,699
You hardly said a word during lunch.

1112
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,272
- You guys yacking away
like you do, who could talk?

1113
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:33,433
- Nah, that ain't it.

1114
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,499
- My bank robber's
still knocking 'em over.

1115
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,269
He shot a cop last time.

1116
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:41,009
This guy's gonna kill someone, Pop.

1117
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,626
I can feel it.

1118
00:54:42,627 --> 00:54:44,045
I can't let that happen.

1119
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:46,499
- Sometimes you can't help it.

1120
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,669
- Sometimes you can, you always managed.

1121
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,509
- Almost always.

1122
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,969
All it took was one bullet.

1123
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,363
The night I caught mine,

1124
00:54:56,350 --> 00:55:01,350
I thought it was all
over, but I lucked out.

1125
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,860
- Lucked out?

1126
00:55:02,861 --> 00:55:06,929
You retired 10 years too
early, and your pension sucks.

1127
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:11,623
- Yeah well, we're still going
to lunch every Wednesday.

1128
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,523
Cheer up, kid!

1129
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,763
(soft rock music)

1130
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:24,181
(computer keys clicking)

1131
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,690
- Jill?

1132
00:55:29,712 --> 00:55:34,127
♪ And I believe that
you'll always be there ♪

1133
00:55:34,128 --> 00:55:39,128
♪ To take care of me ♪

1134
00:55:40,893 --> 00:55:42,771
♪ Shine down on me ♪

1135
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,272
(Jill groans)

1136
00:55:46,569 --> 00:55:50,049
♪ Shine down on me ♪

1137
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,343
- Honey, I need to talk.

1138
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,950
I crossed the line the other day.

1139
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,033
And even as I was firing
at him, I knew it.

1140
00:56:06,054 --> 00:56:08,857
It scared me, but at the same time,

1141
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:12,073
it was the ultimate control.

1142
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,700
- I know.

1143
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,100
- You do?

1144
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:20,970
- Yeah.

1145
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,960
That's why next time
I'm going in with you.

1146
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,809
- What are you talking about?

1147
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,060
- No more getaway driver.

1148
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:31,879
We are full partners from here on in.

1149
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,059
- Oh no, Jill.

1150
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,893
That's crazy.

1151
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:35,423
- No, Jeff, it's the only way.

1152
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,489
It's like you said, you crossed a line,

1153
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:39,790
and there's no going back.

1154
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,560
You asked me the other day

1155
00:56:43,561 --> 00:56:45,460
if I would rather attend your funeral.

1156
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,200
And the truth is I could never do that.

1157
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,803
So where you go, I go.

1158
00:56:52,804 --> 00:56:53,804
It's that simple.

1159
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:03,809
(rifle blasting)

1160
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:07,759
- All right, any one of you
moves and all of you die.

1161
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,593
Is that clear?

1162
00:57:08,594 --> 00:57:10,579
Come on, let's go, finish up!

1163
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,199
Come on, next one!

1164
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,283
You, kiss the ground!

1165
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,243
Get down, turn away.

1166
00:57:19,107 --> 00:57:20,599
(whistles) Hey!

1167
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,649
What are you doing?

1168
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,150
Get away from there, get down!

1169
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:28,429
(loud banging)

1170
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,239
Hey, hey.

1171
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,590
What's going on back there?

1172
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:33,820
Get up, get up, get up.

1173
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:37,552
(woman whimpers)

1174
00:57:38,466 --> 00:57:39,819
You stay in my sight
or I'll shoot your eye

1175
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,051
out the back of your head.

1176
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:42,218
You stay right there!

1177
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:44,123
- [Woman] Oh God.

1178
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:46,957
(thrilling music)

1179
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:55,014
- Okay, look away.

1180
00:57:55,015 --> 00:57:56,015
Stay down!

1181
00:57:58,292 --> 00:57:59,801
Okay.

1182
00:57:59,802 --> 00:58:01,279
All right, you, get up.

1183
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,672
Let's go.

1184
00:58:02,673 --> 00:58:04,423
Look down, turn away!

1185
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,297
Look away.

1186
00:58:07,298 --> 00:58:09,101
(dramatic whooshing)

1187
00:58:09,102 --> 00:58:10,519
- Oh!
- Here, come here.

1188
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,353
Feel your heart.

1189
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:12,679
- Oh God, it's pounding, is yours?

1190
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,836
- No, it's all routine for me by now.

1191
00:58:14,837 --> 00:58:16,319
But you sure know you're alive when

1192
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,359
your heart's beating like that.

1193
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,830
Hey, you were awesome.

1194
00:58:18,831 --> 00:58:20,229
- Oh no, my hands were shaking.

1195
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,299
I dropped the money.

1196
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,709
- Yeah, but you picked
it right back up again.

1197
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,717
All $18,000.

1198
00:58:25,718 --> 00:58:26,718
- Oh, $18,000, ah!

1199
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,358
- Whoo!

1200
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:33,026
(both laughing)

1201
00:58:35,403 --> 00:58:37,249
- We've got a pretty good
consensus on the second guy.

1202
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,513
- Second guy, as in partner?

1203
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,789
- You're bound to be
right some of the time.

1204
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:45,009
So he's early to mid-20s.

1205
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,169
He's 5'6-ish.

1206
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:47,959
He's not as beefed up as the original.

1207
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,679
He's got the same kind
of fake beard though.

1208
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,113
Same shades and another diehard Cubby fan.

1209
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:56,209
But, best of all, we have home movies.

1210
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:57,170
- Who's?

1211
00:58:57,171 --> 00:58:58,619
- Film student from Northwestern.

1212
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,759
He never goes anywhere
without his trusted camera.

1213
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,690
- Wow.

1214
00:59:01,691 --> 00:59:04,027
Let's hope he knows how to use it.

1215
00:59:04,028 --> 00:59:07,627
(high-pitched tape scratching)

1216
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:10,628
(suspenseful music)

1217
00:59:18,702 --> 00:59:21,521
(phone keys beeping)

1218
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:24,189
(phone ringing)

1219
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:28,939
- Hello?

1220
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,790
- Hey, this guy's partner is a woman.

1221
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:33,783
- Tom?

1222
00:59:33,784 --> 00:59:35,519
- I've been watching the
tape, the way they move.

1223
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,353
The way they relate.

1224
00:59:36,354 --> 00:59:38,739
The way the big one puts his hand

1225
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,250
on the other one's lower back
and kind of guides him around.

1226
00:59:42,251 --> 00:59:43,559
- So?

1227
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,629
- So guys don't do that
with each other, Sylvia.

1228
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,499
- Okay, that's great, Tom.

1229
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,276
You show me in the morning,

1230
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:53,103
and I promise I'll be
much more interested then.

1231
00:59:59,723 --> 01:00:02,223
(phone beeps)

1232
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,725
- You, hey!

1233
01:00:06,726 --> 01:00:08,939
Let's go, get up!

1234
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,207
- This is Jake Hepburn
and Tracy Rheinstahl.

1235
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:14,799
Affectionately known as Hepburn and Tracy.

1236
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,739
They knocked over a half
dozen convenience stores

1237
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,680
back in '88.

1238
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:19,779
- How tall is Tracy?
- 5'10.

1239
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:20,903
- Our lady's shorter.

1240
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:25,339
- Placido Gonzalez and Cece Vega.

1241
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,699
Convicted of grand theft auto.

1242
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,133
She did two years, he did four.

1243
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:32,649
- He's too beefy.

1244
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:33,819
- Yeah, but he's tall enough.

1245
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,759
He could have lost weight
in prison, and she's 5'8.

1246
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,053
- She's so buxom.

1247
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:42,314
- Sir, Agent Lasalle's becoming
personally involved here.

1248
01:00:42,315 --> 01:00:43,319
(cops laughing)

1249
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,019
- Well, she would be hard to
mistake for a teenage boy.

1250
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,559
All the same though,

1251
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,409
I want you to talk to
them both, just in case.

1252
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:53,079
They're the last known team on the list.

1253
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,239
Okay, thanks everybody.

1254
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,240
Nice work.

1255
01:00:59,794 --> 01:01:03,839
- I can never tell if he
loves me or hates my guts.

1256
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,010
- My guess, a little of both.

1257
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:12,490
(suspenseful music)
(footsteps thudding)

1258
01:01:16,518 --> 01:01:19,601
(fountain splashing)

1259
01:01:30,097 --> 01:01:31,523
- Aren't you freezing?

1260
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,269
- No, I'm all right.

1261
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,770
You stop taking your medicine?

1262
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,558
- You know what's so
interesting about not sleeping?

1263
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:43,459
You start to dream while you're awake.

1264
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,999
- About what?

1265
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,189
- I dream that we're on this other planet,

1266
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:50,439
and the atmosphere is really thick.

1267
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,679
Like the sequencing gels I use in the lab,

1268
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,469
but when the light strikes it from behind,

1269
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:57,039
it's so beautiful, you can't resist it.

1270
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,179
So we just, we sit on lawn chairs,

1271
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,968
and we just stare at the sky endlessly.

1272
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,373
And then other times I
dream that we have a baby.

1273
01:02:07,426 --> 01:02:09,376
- Well, that one we can make come true.

1274
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:11,980
- Will we?

1275
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:13,710
- Yeah.

1276
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:15,930
I'd like that.

1277
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:21,759
Jill, on the next job,

1278
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,849
I don't want you to go
with me into the bank.

1279
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,332
I want you to go back to driving the car.

1280
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:26,739
- Why, you said I did a great job?

1281
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:27,749
- And you did,

1282
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,869
but you've been a bit strung out lately.

1283
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,959
And I don't think it's
safe for you to go in

1284
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,527
that wired, you know?

1285
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:36,301
- Are we still a team?

1286
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:39,620
- Forever.

1287
01:02:43,736 --> 01:02:46,649
(somber music)

1288
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:51,650
(static buzzing)
(phone ringing)

1289
01:02:59,366 --> 01:03:00,320
(phone beeps)

1290
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,320
- Hello?

1291
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,660
I'll be right there.

1292
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,320
Pop?

1293
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,360
Pop, you all right?

1294
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,233
- He's looking for a showdown.

1295
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:21,999
- Who is?

1296
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,969
- It don't matter to him if he dies.

1297
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:27,879
As long as he makes a scene doing it.

1298
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,849
Controlling his destiny
and everyone else's.

1299
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:32,116
- Pop, what are you talking about?

1300
01:03:32,117 --> 01:03:33,459
- The bank guy.

1301
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,689
I saw him on the news.

1302
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:36,843
In bango, 1970.

1303
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:41,119
My dead, bearded, fake
hippie perp comes to mind

1304
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,123
as vivid as yesterday.

1305
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,949
- You brought that guy down?

1306
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:48,029
- We had him cornered.

1307
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,599
There's no way out.

1308
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,879
He knew it.

1309
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,759
He could have waved a white
flag and done some jail time.

1310
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,749
But it's as if he imagined
the headlines after his death,

1311
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,779
and he just started shooting.

1312
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:00,949
He had an arsenal on him.

1313
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,799
He even tossed a grenade.

1314
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,209
By the time I finally hit
him, he killed my partner.

1315
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,439
A rookie.

1316
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,559
And wounded three others, it was awful.

1317
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,459
And that bastard was still
breathing when I got to him,

1318
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,483
and he laughed at me, Tommy.

1319
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,223
It was as if he'd won somehow.

1320
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:23,113
He died with that grin on his face.

1321
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:27,159
- My guys going out in a blaze of glory.

1322
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,759
- That's what these guys think.

1323
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,593
- Oh man.

1324
01:04:29,594 --> 01:04:33,643
- But the truth is, no one cares.

1325
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,659
No one remembers who they are.

1326
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:41,163
It's a lousy two minutes of
fame, and there's no glory.

1327
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:56,682
(car door slams)

1328
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,023
- Okay, all set.

1329
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,573
- You wanna try to get
the other car tonight?

1330
01:05:12,574 --> 01:05:13,407
- No, tomorrow.

1331
01:05:13,407 --> 01:05:14,407
I'm tired.

1332
01:05:15,975 --> 01:05:16,849
- You think it'll be all right

1333
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,309
to leave it here for two days?

1334
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,710
- Yeah, who's gonna bother
a beat up old Toyota?

1335
01:05:22,761 --> 01:05:25,428
(siren wailing)

1336
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,028
(tires screeching)

1337
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:31,612
(men shouting)

1338
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:36,755
- She's nagging, I'm just a peaceful man!

1339
01:05:36,756 --> 01:05:38,790
Wait a minute, listen, officer, listen!

1340
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:41,181
I'm just a peaceful man, and
she's always provoking me!

1341
01:05:41,182 --> 01:05:44,217
(water splashing)
(woman laughing)

1342
01:05:44,218 --> 01:05:45,949
- That's for all of you jerks!

1343
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:46,817
- Get him in the car!

1344
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,229
- I hope they put you up under the jail

1345
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:50,799
and burn that sucker down!

1346
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,429
- Lady, shut the window
or you're going to jail.

1347
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:55,919
- Oh, yeah right, big man!

1348
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,358
Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep!

1349
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:58,716
Oh, I'm so terrified!

1350
01:05:58,717 --> 01:06:00,132
Oh, I'm scared of you!

1351
01:06:00,133 --> 01:06:01,899
- Reminds me of my second wife.

1352
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,538
- I thought you were still married to her.

1353
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:04,539
- I am.

1354
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:09,298
Look at that.

1355
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,269
- [Cop] Why would somebody
cover up their steering column

1356
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:13,270
with a towel?

1357
01:06:15,256 --> 01:06:17,386
- Let's run a make on that.

1358
01:06:17,387 --> 01:06:18,387
- Yeah.

1359
01:06:20,622 --> 01:06:23,289
(phone ringing)

1360
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:29,001
- Lasalle here.

1361
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,730
Leave it right where it is.

1362
01:06:35,446 --> 01:06:38,408
(phone beeping)

1363
01:06:38,409 --> 01:06:41,409
(suspenseful music)

1364
01:06:58,427 --> 01:07:00,609
There you go.
- Good.

1365
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:02,403
Okay, I got another one for you.

1366
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,073
- [Tom] Great.

1367
01:07:04,074 --> 01:07:05,329
- They say the universe
is expanding, right?

1368
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,163
- [Tom] Right.

1369
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:08,179
- So my question is
what's it expanding into?

1370
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:10,709
I mean, what's bigger than the universe?

1371
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:14,341
- Maybe there's this giant void around it.

1372
01:07:14,342 --> 01:07:17,039
- Well, well, a void would
still have to be the universe.

1373
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,701
I mean, isn't the universe
by definition, everything?

1374
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,549
- You know what, I didn't read that book.

1375
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:24,423
- Well, they just throw
these terms around.

1376
01:07:24,424 --> 01:07:25,883
Drives me crazy.

1377
01:07:30,429 --> 01:07:33,309
- All I know is we're caught in a void

1378
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,996
created by a mean ass couple.

1379
01:07:34,997 --> 01:07:37,639
And I personally cannot
wait for their universe

1380
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,763
to expand into our laps.

1381
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,079
- Well, on a more basic note,
the Celebrity Deli now has a

1382
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,703
Bearded Bandit special sandwich.

1383
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:49,187
- No, really?

1384
01:07:49,188 --> 01:07:50,653
- [Partner] Yep.

1385
01:07:52,383 --> 01:07:53,966
- God, I hate that.

1386
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,925
- Now this is an '82 Cheval Blanc

1387
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:05,893
from the Saint Emilion
region near Bordeaux, France.

1388
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:11,559
Now they say that 1982
was the best wine year

1389
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,964
of the century, and this
and the Mouton Rothschild

1390
01:08:15,965 --> 01:08:17,773
are the best of the '82s.

1391
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:22,015
Which means they are
barely good enough for you.

1392
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:22,849
(glasses clinking)

1393
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,259
- How do you know so much about wine?

1394
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,839
- Well, I decided it's
time for a little class.

1395
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,699
So I've been reading back issues

1396
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,772
of Wine Spectator Magazine.

1397
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:34,440
(both laughing)

1398
01:08:37,352 --> 01:08:38,352
Mm.

1399
01:08:41,863 --> 01:08:43,780
- You know what I want?

1400
01:08:47,607 --> 01:08:50,209
I wanna have three kids,

1401
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,329
and I wanna have 'em all right away.

1402
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,679
- Three kids right away?

1403
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,600
- Mm-hmm.

1404
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,560
I have this theory.

1405
01:08:56,561 --> 01:08:58,139
It's three kids that make a family

1406
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,440
because you gotta have
more kids than parents.

1407
01:09:01,498 --> 01:09:03,309
(lips smacking)
- That sounds dangerous.

1408
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:06,862
- It is dangerous, that's the point.

1409
01:09:06,863 --> 01:09:08,729
When the kids outnumber the parents,

1410
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:11,513
that's when we find out
what we're really made of.

1411
01:09:13,847 --> 01:09:16,067
I think that kids will
make us a real family.

1412
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,463
That's my dream.

1413
01:09:19,891 --> 01:09:21,291
- Then that's what we'll do.

1414
01:09:22,747 --> 01:09:23,803
We'll make a family.

1415
01:09:31,214 --> 01:09:34,214
(suspenseful music)

1416
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:44,358
(birds chirping)

1417
01:09:45,369 --> 01:09:48,119
(engine humming)

1418
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,280
- Think he's coming.

1419
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:08,550
- Yeah, we got him.

1420
01:10:08,551 --> 01:10:11,093
- Okay, we'll go when
he's inside the Toyota.

1421
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,999
- I should be there by noon easy.

1422
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,319
Why don't you find us
a good spot for lunch?

1423
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,643
Maybe by the lake.

1424
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:20,963
Okay, gorgeous?

1425
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:25,080
- Yeah, the lake would be good.

1426
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:29,890
(car door slams)

1427
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:30,850
- Okay, he's making his move.

1428
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:31,850
On my command.

1429
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,430
- Be careful.

1430
01:10:36,585 --> 01:10:37,585
I love you.

1431
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:43,999
- So what do you think, is
that the guy from the video?

1432
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,793
- No way, but let's nail him anyhow.

1433
01:10:47,681 --> 01:10:48,681
- Go.

1434
01:10:49,568 --> 01:10:52,401
(thrilling music)

1435
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,559
(tires screeching)
Put your hands up!

1436
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,260
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Hands up!

1437
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:05,243
- Hey, hey.
- Out of the car!

1438
01:11:05,243 --> 01:11:06,076
- Hey, what is this?

1439
01:11:06,077 --> 01:11:07,747
- Out of the car, you're under arrest.

1440
01:11:07,748 --> 01:11:09,219
- Oh, come on.
- Shut up.

1441
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,919
Put your hands up there, spread your legs.

1442
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,123
- Hey, hey, easy.
- Spread 'em!

1443
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:16,940
- Go, Jill!

1444
01:11:18,924 --> 01:11:20,985
(engine revving)

1445
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:22,503
(tires screeching)

1446
01:11:22,504 --> 01:11:23,466
- Grab his hands!

1447
01:11:23,467 --> 01:11:24,712
- Driving!

1448
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,482
- All right, turn around.
- She's on the move.

1449
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:28,255
- Get on the ground, face down!

1450
01:11:28,256 --> 01:11:29,980
Hands behind your head.

1451
01:11:29,981 --> 01:11:30,981
Good.

1452
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:32,958
Be right there.

1453
01:11:34,266 --> 01:11:37,183
(tires screeching)

1454
01:11:40,727 --> 01:11:43,023
(car crashing)

1455
01:11:43,024 --> 01:11:44,031
(woman screams)

1456
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:46,346
- What's the matter with you?

1457
01:11:46,347 --> 01:11:49,264
(tires screeching)

1458
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,413
(thrilling music)

1459
01:12:19,029 --> 01:12:21,696
(siren wailing)

1460
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,240
- This is FBI, 012414.

1461
01:12:28,365 --> 01:12:29,357
- [Dispatcher] Go ahead, FBI.

1462
01:12:29,358 --> 01:12:32,029
- We've got an armed
and dangerous suspect.

1463
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:34,784
We need some marked units
for felony car stop.

1464
01:12:34,785 --> 01:12:37,535
(sirens wailing)

1465
01:12:50,835 --> 01:12:54,819
Suspect is heading south
onto Irving Park Road.

1466
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,873
Turning west onto Wise.

1467
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,884
Subject is a White female
driving a green Jeep Cherokee.

1468
01:13:01,885 --> 01:13:04,802
(tires screeching)

1469
01:13:05,968 --> 01:13:10,639
- Okay, see if you can
talk to her on the speaker.

1470
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,473
(thrilling music)

1471
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:18,437
(gunshot blasting)
(glass shattering)

1472
01:13:18,438 --> 01:13:20,084
You okay?
- Yeah.

1473
01:13:20,085 --> 01:13:23,085
(gunshots blasting)

1474
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,735
(sirens wailing)

1475
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:37,194
(tires screeching)

1476
01:13:39,383 --> 01:13:44,383
(sirens wailing)
(tires screeching)

1477
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:48,433
(dramatic music)

1478
01:13:48,434 --> 01:13:51,593
(gunshot blasting)
(window shattering)

1479
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:54,524
(gunshots blasting)

1480
01:13:54,525 --> 01:13:56,046
(tires screeching)

1481
01:13:56,047 --> 01:13:58,772
(car crashing)
(window busting)

1482
01:13:58,773 --> 01:14:01,690
(tires screeching)

1483
01:14:07,228 --> 01:14:09,978
(sirens wailing)

1484
01:14:21,236 --> 01:14:24,069
(thrilling music)

1485
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,023
- Ma'am, turn off your engine.

1486
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:38,332
Step outta your vehicle with
your hands in plain sight.

1487
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:41,536
(suspenseful music)

1488
01:14:41,537 --> 01:14:45,039
Anything else will be
considered an act of aggression.

1489
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,919
Ma'am, please step out.

1490
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,570
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

1491
01:14:51,502 --> 01:14:54,252
(dramatic music)

1492
01:15:05,684 --> 01:15:07,689
No chance for escape.

1493
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,340
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

1494
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,248
Please, you'll make
things worse, now come on.

1495
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,009
We have no intention of harming you

1496
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:24,273
if you just step out of the car.

1497
01:15:28,002 --> 01:15:30,835
(thrilling music)

1498
01:15:32,918 --> 01:15:35,115
- How come no one's saying anything?

1499
01:15:35,116 --> 01:15:37,369
(gunshot blasting)

1500
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:38,583
What was that noise?

1501
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,510
What the hell is happening out there?

1502
01:15:46,144 --> 01:15:48,556
What did they do to her, huh?

1503
01:15:48,557 --> 01:15:49,974
What did they do?

1504
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,429
- Mr. Erickson, I'm Agent Lasalle.

1505
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:02,263
This is Agent Whitmeyer.

1506
01:16:02,264 --> 01:16:03,635
We'd like to talk to about...

1507
01:16:03,636 --> 01:16:05,485
- Where's Jill?

1508
01:16:05,486 --> 01:16:07,969
- We've been able to put together
a great deal of evidence.

1509
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,869
We can place you at the
scene where the officer

1510
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,469
was shot for starters.

1511
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,499
We can also...
- What happened to Jill?

1512
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,241
- [Tom] We can connect
you to three separate.

1513
01:16:14,242 --> 01:16:16,473
- Just tell me where my wife is!

1514
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,663
- I'm sorry to tell you.

1515
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,643
Your wife is dead.

1516
01:16:27,111 --> 01:16:29,039
(dramatic music)

1517
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,083
- She was just trying to get away.

1518
01:16:32,072 --> 01:16:33,439
- We know that, believe me.

1519
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,273
We tried.

1520
01:16:34,274 --> 01:16:36,803
- Why didn't you kill me
instead, you bastards!

1521
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:40,430
Why didn't you just kill me too?

1522
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:45,490
Oh!

1523
01:16:47,242 --> 01:16:48,875
Oh God.

1524
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:49,876
Jill.

1525
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:52,679
- We didn't kill her, Jeff.

1526
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,680
- Oh, yes you did.

1527
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,849
I was a cop once.

1528
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:57,683
I know how it was.

1529
01:16:57,684 --> 01:16:58,699
- You weren't a cop for long

1530
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,056
'cause you didn't know how it works.

1531
01:17:00,057 --> 01:17:01,489
And you weren't out there with us.

1532
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:02,437
We didn't kill her!

1533
01:17:02,438 --> 01:17:04,453
We didn't want to kill anybody.

1534
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,374
She killed herself.

1535
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,375
- No.

1536
01:17:13,574 --> 01:17:18,574
No, no! (cries)

1537
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:26,598
(Jeff cries loudly)

1538
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:30,283
- We're gonna leave you
alone for a few minutes.

1539
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:37,933
You hungry, you want some
coffee or food or anything?

1540
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:43,400
Okay, we'll see you in a bit.

1541
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,097
- Can I see her?

1542
01:18:11,955 --> 01:18:14,455
(phone rings)

1543
01:18:22,717 --> 01:18:25,300
Oh, she's beautiful, isn't she?

1544
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,173
It's strange to see her so still.

1545
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:37,720
She used to have so much
trouble getting to sleep.

1546
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,483
And we were gonna have a baby.

1547
01:18:59,559 --> 01:19:02,142
(somber music)

1548
01:19:05,523 --> 01:19:06,929
(Jeff cries)

1549
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:07,930
- Okay, okay.

1550
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,120
Let's go.

1551
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:29,610
- I don't know.

1552
01:19:31,192 --> 01:19:33,742
I mean, it's pretty hard
to tell without the beard.

1553
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,349
I mean, do you think you could
get them to say something?

1554
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,350
- Sure.

1555
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:42,989
(hand knocks)

1556
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:49,274
- You got 10 seconds, or I
put a bullet in your brain.

1557
01:19:49,275 --> 01:19:50,335
- [Man] You got 10 seconds,

1558
01:19:50,336 --> 01:19:53,253
or I'll put a bullet in your brain.

1559
01:19:57,515 --> 01:20:02,265
- You got 10 seconds, or I'll
put a bullet in your brain.

1560
01:20:06,495 --> 01:20:10,254
You got 10 seconds, or I'll
put a bullet in your brain!

1561
01:20:10,255 --> 01:20:13,088
(thrilling music)

1562
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:17,473
(woman groans)

1563
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,289
- Harry, I thought you were retired.

1564
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,079
- Not till I get the cabin built.

1565
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,309
So how's the captain?

1566
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,909
- Ah, he's still kicking.

1567
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:34,279
Still busting my chops.

1568
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,739
- Ah, good for him.

1569
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:37,589
That old man of yours
is a real piece of work.

1570
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:39,199
Sure taught me some things.

1571
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,439
- Yeah, me too.

1572
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,619
- You two testifying?

1573
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:42,879
- All the way.

1574
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,819
- Stick it to him.

1575
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:45,820
- See you, Harry.

1576
01:20:48,186 --> 01:20:51,629
(footsteps thudding)

1577
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,365
- [Lawyer] So what you're
saying, Officer Dixon,

1578
01:20:53,366 --> 01:20:56,109
is that you are unable
to identify Mr. Erickson

1579
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,949
as the man who shot you
during a routine traffic stop

1580
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:01,163
on November 4th of last year.

1581
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:04,899
- The man who shot me
was wearing a fake beard,

1582
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:08,369
sunglasses and a baseball cap.

1583
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:10,923
- I understand that perfectly
well, Officer Dixon.

1584
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:15,067
Let me put this to you simply.

1585
01:21:15,068 --> 01:21:18,899
Can you positively identify Jeff Erickson

1586
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,359
as the man who shot you?

1587
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,349
- I cannot positively
identify Mr. Erickson,

1588
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:27,336
but I can give you a good...
- Thank you, officer.

1589
01:21:27,337 --> 01:21:28,803
- What's in that frame?

1590
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:33,093
- Photo of his wife.

1591
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,128
- Now agent, Whitmeyer,
will you tell the jury

1592
01:21:39,129 --> 01:21:42,679
what, if anything, was
unusual about the bullets

1593
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,739
that were recovered from
Officer Dixon's wounds

1594
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:48,091
and from the body of his squad car?

1595
01:21:48,092 --> 01:21:50,839
- The ballistic tests on the bullets prove

1596
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,929
that their striations, their fingerprints,

1597
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:56,919
if you will, match those
retrieved from the walls

1598
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,129
and the security cameras
of a bank we believe

1599
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:02,199
was robbed by Mr. Erickson
and his wife, Jill.

1600
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,509
At the time of his arrest,

1601
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:07,529
we recovered a Ruger Mini-14
rifle that we then ascertained

1602
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:10,273
was the same weapon that
fired all the bullets.

1603
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,140
- [Judge] Court is recessed until

1604
01:22:12,141 --> 01:22:13,187
nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

1605
01:22:13,188 --> 01:22:15,688
(gavel bangs)

1606
01:22:22,482 --> 01:22:23,609
- Thanks.

1607
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:26,113
- Agent Lasalle, are you married?

1608
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:30,334
- No.
- How come?

1609
01:22:30,335 --> 01:22:32,668
- I don't wanna...
- How come?

1610
01:22:37,673 --> 01:22:39,809
- I haven't found the right girl.

1611
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:40,810
- I did.

1612
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,149
Tomorrow's our anniversary.

1613
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:45,683
It would've been 10 years.

1614
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:51,720
I just wish I could be with her, you know?

1615
01:22:57,673 --> 01:23:00,006
(hand pats)

1616
01:23:02,590 --> 01:23:03,590
- [Man] Yeah, I did.

1617
01:23:19,471 --> 01:23:22,054
(somber music)

1618
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:27,219
- How'd it go in court today?

1619
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:28,799
- I don't know, it's weird.

1620
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,249
This guy sits there paying no
attention at his own trial.

1621
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,969
He just daydreams or
stares at that damn picture

1622
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:38,869
of his wife or me.

1623
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:40,622
- Or you, what's that about?

1624
01:23:40,623 --> 01:23:43,179
- I don't know, he's
trying to psych me out

1625
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:46,169
maybe or connect.

1626
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:49,124
I mean, he told me that tomorrow was gonna

1627
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:51,293
be their 10th anniversary.

1628
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,939
- You wanna send him a card, what?

1629
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:54,913
- I know, I know, it's crazy.

1630
01:23:54,914 --> 01:23:57,409
I mean, I hated this guy's
guts the entire time I

1631
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:58,243
was tracking him.

1632
01:23:58,244 --> 01:24:03,229
It's just, he talks about
her, he's so broken up.

1633
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:05,339
- Tom, it's an act.

1634
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,949
He's just a thug, period.

1635
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:09,679
You gotta let it go.

1636
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:12,079
You did good work in this
case, but now it's over.

1637
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,269
You won.

1638
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:15,813
Time to relax, get some rest.

1639
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:22,439
- The chase lasted
approximately 15 minutes.

1640
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,029
It speeds up to 100 miles an hour.

1641
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:26,769
- And during the course of this chase,

1642
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,209
gunfire was exchanged?

1643
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:29,210
- That's correct.

1644
01:24:30,017 --> 01:24:33,939
- Now Agent Lasalle, at
any time did you believe

1645
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:37,559
that Mrs. Erickson's
actions were offensive

1646
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:38,789
rather than defensive?

1647
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:39,623
- Absolutely.

1648
01:24:39,624 --> 01:24:42,509
We pulled up next to the Jeep
Cherokee so Agent Whitmeyer,

1649
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:45,784
who was seated in the passenger
seat, could speak to her.

1650
01:24:45,785 --> 01:24:48,129
At that point, Mrs.
Erickson aimed her pistol

1651
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:49,783
and fired straight at our windshield.

1652
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:50,929
- Did you shoot back?

1653
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:52,092
- No, we did not.

1654
01:24:52,093 --> 01:24:55,153
Eventually she came to
a stop in a cul-de-sac

1655
01:24:55,154 --> 01:24:57,849
and turned around to face us.

1656
01:24:57,850 --> 01:24:59,549
Nothing happened for a long time.

1657
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:01,949
We asked her several times to step out.

1658
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:03,279
- But she didn't do that.

1659
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,480
- [Tom] No, she did not.

1660
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,520
- Why?

1661
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:08,420
- She was...

1662
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,239
When we opened the driver's side door,

1663
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,063
we found Mrs. Erickson's body.

1664
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,699
It appeared at the time
and was later confirmed

1665
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,419
by the medical examiner
that the bullet wound

1666
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,799
to her right temple was self-inflicted.

1667
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,089
(fist slams)
- Liar!

1668
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:27,439
You murdered her in cold blood!

1669
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,009
Jill would never have left me alone.

1670
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:30,964
She loved me, we were like one person.

1671
01:25:30,965 --> 01:25:32,089
(gavel bangs)
- Counselor.

1672
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:33,999
Please keep your client under control.

1673
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,266
- You ran her down like
a dog and you shot her!

1674
01:25:37,267 --> 01:25:39,147
Admit it, come on, admit it!

1675
01:25:39,148 --> 01:25:41,569
(gavel bangs)
- All right, that's enough.

1676
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:44,459
Marshals, please escort Mr.
Erickson out of the courtroom.

1677
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:47,479
See counsel for both
sides in my chambers now.

1678
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,531
Court is recessed until nine
o'clock tomorrow morning.

1679
01:25:49,532 --> 01:25:50,932
(gavel bangs)
- Liar, liar!

1680
01:26:00,758 --> 01:26:05,309
(footsteps thudding)
(door buzzing)

1681
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:06,143
- Got room for one more?

1682
01:26:06,144 --> 01:26:07,363
- Yeah, it's no problem.

1683
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:11,519
- You folks through already?

1684
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,939
- Defendant blew a fuse.

1685
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:14,413
Court's recessed until tomorrow.

1686
01:26:14,414 --> 01:26:16,997
- See you then.
- See you, Eric.

1687
01:26:20,918 --> 01:26:24,585
(handcuffs rattling softly)

1688
01:26:34,166 --> 01:26:37,833
(handcuffs rattling softly)

1689
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:54,029
(door buzzes)

1690
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:56,509
- Ah, damn.
- What's the matter?

1691
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:57,510
- Van's not here.

1692
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,794
Just hold on a minute, let
me see if I can find it.

1693
01:27:00,795 --> 01:27:02,036
(elevator door thuds)

1694
01:27:02,037 --> 01:27:02,960
(dramatic music)

1695
01:27:02,961 --> 01:27:04,268
- [Man] Hey!

1696
01:27:04,269 --> 01:27:06,852
(men shouting)

1697
01:27:08,009 --> 01:27:09,812
- Look out!

1698
01:27:09,813 --> 01:27:12,813
(gunshots blasting)

1699
01:27:13,725 --> 01:27:16,558
(thrilling music)

1700
01:27:21,248 --> 01:27:22,749
(gunshot blasting)

1701
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:25,333
(guard groans)

1702
01:27:26,477 --> 01:27:29,310
(thrilling music)

1703
01:27:33,885 --> 01:27:38,885
(gunshot blasts)
(Jeff groans)

1704
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:43,919
(Jeff groans)

1705
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,003
(footsteps thudding)

1706
01:27:48,036 --> 01:27:52,927
- Put it down, Jeff!

1707
01:27:52,928 --> 01:27:54,518
You won, you took a lot of people out!

1708
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:56,823
Now just put it down!

1709
01:27:56,824 --> 01:27:59,657
(thrilling music)

1710
01:28:14,227 --> 01:28:15,227
Don't.

1711
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:26,360
(gunshot blasts)
(body thuds)

1712
01:28:30,145 --> 01:28:33,228
(footsteps thudding)

1713
01:28:39,161 --> 01:28:40,828
In a blaze of glory.

1714
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:45,323
(somber music)

1715
01:28:51,537 --> 01:28:54,409
(people chattering)

1716
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,759
Harry Belluomini, a security guard

1717
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,816
and former Chicago police
officer, and Roy Frakes,

1718
01:28:59,817 --> 01:29:02,159
a deputy United States Marshal,

1719
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,549
were killed in the line of duty.

1720
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:06,899
How Jeff Erickson obtained a handcuff key

1721
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:09,349
is still a matter of investigation.

1722
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:12,019
However, such keys, which
fit almost all brands

1723
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:14,597
of handcuffs, are readily available.

1724
01:29:24,056 --> 01:29:26,889
(thrilling music)

1725
01:29:53,619 --> 01:29:56,369
(dramatic music)

1726
01:30:15,763 --> 01:30:18,346
(bright music)
