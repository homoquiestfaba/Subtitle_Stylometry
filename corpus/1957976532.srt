1
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,189
Is this urine?! Taste like urine..

2
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,593
Yea...take it good.

3
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:41,161
That's what you get for ruining
everything motherfucker.

4
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,497
I got business bro! I gotta go!

5
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,277
If you're not careful, you're
going to die today.

6
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,114
Wait...what, what?!

7
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,216
Who are you??? Why was he peeing on me?

8
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,553
What's going on?

9
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:16,564
Well...uh no. I don't know.

10
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:19,734
Maybe

11
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,402
I'll literally tried to drink
myself to death last night...

12
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,404
... and I guess that didn't work.

13
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:25,940
Now, I'm here.

14
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,649
Oh my gosh...

15
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:36,483
it's her.

16
00:03:55,536 --> 00:04:00,208
Man, I can believe I've had a crush on
her ever since that Kid Cudi concert.

17
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,577
And Tarantino night a Cinespia

18
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:05,046
... or that one time we
went to the coffee --

19
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,697
Nate, go talk to her

20
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:24,899
She's the girl of your dreams

21
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,602
Go talk to her.

22
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,505
Owwww!!!!

23
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,409
You got him bro!

24
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,558
Yo naked dude! It's clear you need some
balls but can we at least have ours back

25
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,995
Don't you know this is a
family friendly park?

26
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,731
He coming. Ew.... what a weirdo.

27
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,866
This guy's a fool

28
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,438
Aww, it's so small. At least
cover your nuts dude.

29
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,408
Do you guys have a phone I can use?

30
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,978
Why? So you can take dick pics?

31
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:14,282
Why do you want to take dick pics?
To send them to your boyfriend?!

32
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,283
No!!!

33
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,784
I don't have a boyfriend.

34
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,786
Come on please! Let me use your phone!

35
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,621
I'll use that "find my phone" app
so I can find my phone! Please!

36
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:21,756
I know you guys have phone!

37
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:24,158
Dude, you're definitely going
to sneak a dick-pic in there

38
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,092
No, I'm not!

39
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:26,426
You're lucky Iphone's have zoom...

40
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:30,131
'cuase we'd definitely need it to
see that tiny schlong of yours

41
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:32,332
More like a microscope

42
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,001
Why are you naked in public?

43
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,636
Why are you here?

44
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,939
Look, to be honestly with you guys...

45
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,875
I really don't know what happened
last night but--

46
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:44,879
it would be a really nice start if I cou
use your phone so I can find my phone

47
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,415
Please...

48
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,689

00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:57,225

51
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,630
Please. Please. Give me phone.

52
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,799
Come on guys. Give me a phone.

53
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,835
Gimme phone-phone. Phone-phone a gimme.

54
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,271
Give it to me guys. I'm desperate.

55
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,607
What are you doing with my son?!!!

56
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:20,480
Stranger Danger! Stranger Danger!!!

57
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,417
His mom's about to beat the
shit out of you dude.

58
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,987
You're fucked dude.

59
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:27,255
What??

60
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:29,590
Dude, you better run.

61
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:35,029
I'm gonna beat that tiny little
thing right off of you!

62
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,164
Get him mom!!!

63
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,740
I don't care how small that things
is...it's still harassment!!!

64
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,115
Leave me alone lady!!!

65
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,619
You're going to jail buster!!!

66
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,095
Oh man...

67
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:14,402
Believe it or not...this isn't even
the worst birthday I've had.

68
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:16,537
Geez.... look at me.

69
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:20,308
I couldn't even kill myself last night,
yet somehow I'm living in hell.

70
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,310
You my friend....

71
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,146
... represent my life.

72
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,083
Grrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!

73
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:31,218
Ah man....

74
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,220
Later guy who I woke up next to

75
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,826
I won't stop until I have my
hands around your neck!!!

76
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:52,373
You sicko!!!!

77
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,709
You're crazy!!!! Stop chasing me!

78
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:07,021
Thank God

79
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:10,157
I've always heard that you're twenties
is where you find yourself

80
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,459
You know, that deep stuff.

81
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,260
Who you are

82
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:15,763
and get a real sense of yourself,
all that stuff.

83
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:19,767
Well I'm 29 now and I frickin'
hate what I found so far

84
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,502
No wonder I'm depressed

85
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,304
To make matters worse...

86
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:26,007
I'm hungover and I have no idea
what happened last night

87
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:27,508
I really don't.

88
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,510
I wish I were dead.

89
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,146
But I can't even seem to do that right

90
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:35,950
So let's see... I pissed off
a random homeless person

91
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,952
who by the way, peed in my mouth.

92
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:41,055
and I'm 100% sure there was
alcohol in his urine

93
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:43,057
Then, I think I made really
good friends with a stoner

94
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:46,193
or some sort of Hippie. Not sure
what language he speaks

95
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:49,497
Exposed my testicles in front
of the local teenagers

96
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,298
And lastly --

97
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,340
Dear Nate...

98
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,176
I know you're going through
a tough time right now

99
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:06,981
and I can't express how sorry I am
to hear about a good young man

100
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:10,718
such as yourself, suffering
from despression

101
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:13,120
and suicidal thoughts...

102
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,723
but if you wanna live here motherfucka..

103
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:18,926
You're going to need to
pay you're goddam rent!

104
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,028
The rules apply to everybody!

105
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:24,632
You don't I wont throw you out because
you're acting like some bitch, Nate?!

106
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,268
Peace dawg!

107
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,403
This is me, evicting you!

108
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:31,939
Oh, and my daughter showed me your
little internet video....

109
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,942
if my dick was that small,
I'd be depressed too.

110
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,744
Pay your motherfucking rent, Nate!!!

111
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,080
Video? What video???

112
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,588
Owww!

113
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,890
This motherfucka Nate. Haha!

114
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,627
Sup? Youngblood?

115
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,964
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

116
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,499
Is evicting me really that funny?

117
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,366
Nice card by the way.

118
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:04,105
Nah, it ain't that. It's
your dick youngblood.

119
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,640
Your dick and balls are smaller
in person than it is on camera.

120
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:13,180
You're shit is so small it probably
make pussy tighter.

121
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,982
What the heck?!

122
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,984
You know what? I feel bad for
evicting you and shit...

123
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,286
I'm going to let you in your apartment.

124
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,223
Really? Why?

125
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:26,127
That way you can find your dick and mayb
one of your balls, little nigga.

126
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,763
Alright... we'll let me in.

127
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:32,099
Move over little bitch!

128
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:36,203
Thanks Byron.

129
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,339
Shut the fuck up.

130
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,080
Yea... yea baby girl.

131
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,916
Yeah, that motherfucka is by the park

132
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:54,288
Yeah....find my shit or I'm gonna
kill your motherfuckin' ass.

133
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,760
Uh huh....I'm hanging up bitch.

134
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,730
This girl better not be playing
with my money....

135
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,433
If this turns out to be one of those day
I swear I'm gonna kill somebody!

136
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,275
Ok, new day. New start.

137
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,076
You got this Nate.

138
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,445
Lets try and piece together whatever
happened last night.

139
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:22,116
First things first, where
the heck are my pants?

140
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:25,520
Knowing me, I probably left
my phone in my pocket

141
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,755
That's so Nate... like I always do.

142
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,757
But if I get my pants, I get my phone.

143
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:34,795
If I get my phone I can at least find so
evidence of what I did last night

144
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,131
Who is " pillow man " ?

145
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,975
No frickin' way!

146
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,283
Woops! Gonna need that.

147
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,829
Just a little bit--

148
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,333
Hi-yaa!!!

149
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:16,303
Come on....

150
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,774
That's exhausting.

151
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,413
Wow. That guy's weak.

152
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,482
Even I can get those pants down.

153
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,051
Easy now. She's just a young woman.

154
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,486
Haha!

155
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,289
Oh man!

156
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,291
How high is that???

157
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,792
Come on!!!!

158
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,395
Wait a second....

159
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:42,530
That's him.

160
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:43,764
Huh?

161
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,299
The guy with the tiny wiener

162
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,434
He's the one.

163
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:55,510
Yea...the one? Right.

164
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:58,946
Come on, let's go!

165
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,414
Boss says Nate needs us
now, more than ever.

166
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:02,216
What? Why?

167
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:04,552
'Cause! Today is the big day.

168
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,155
Oh right...the big day.

169
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:09,189
Right.

170
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,964
Come on! You forgot what
we were sent to do.

171
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,300
Didn't you?

172
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,716
Ahhhh!!!!!!!

173
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,151
Ohhh!

174
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,586
Is that how he's going to die?

175
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,120
Not that I know of

176
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,456
Oh yea right. I knew that.

177
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,531
Dude, did you just see that?

178
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:53,233
That guy with the man-gina just ate
shit falling out of that tree.

179
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,707
Listen Cheech and Dong...

180
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,709
You need to focus more on selling
this shit than smoking it.

181
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:04,011
Especially since we lost all
of our weed last night.

182
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,014
Focus!

183
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,620
What the fuck?

184
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:15,590
That's weird...I've never seen
your eyes so open before

185
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,925
it's creeping me out.

186
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:25,399
I can't understand you.
I can't understand you.

187
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:31,305
Dude, you're so high that I don't think
you understand that you're mumbling

188
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:44,218
Oh that's funny...

189
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:49,223
"Pillow Man! Pillow Man

190
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:13,213
I don't even have to make a dick
joke. His dick is the joke!

191
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,820
Hey, you guys are the dealers...

192
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,255
Can I get some chronic?

193
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:25,025
Even though you're like ten
I'd still sell ya weed ...

194
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:29,496
but unfortunately that pillowcase in tha
video happens to be our weed so no.

195
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:35,235
Oh word. Could I get your number then?

196
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,371
No!

197
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,175
Come on, let's go stony baloney.

198
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,831
Can I help you guys?

199
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:06,033
You really don't have any idea
what going on, do you?

200
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,469
Nope. I don't think I ever really do.

201
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,471
Not you. Him.

202
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,039
Who me?

203
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,341
What are you guys ---

204
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,342
Hey!

205
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,444
Aren't you that kid that told
me I was going to die today?

206
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:18,713
Uh huh

207
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:19,881
What do you guys want?

208
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,282
Unless you're here to magically fix
everything's that's happened

209
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:22,851
or kill me

210
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:24,117
I don't want to hear it

211
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,753
Actually, we are

212
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,956
Which one? Kill me or fix it?

213
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:30,290
I don't know I forgot.

214
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,696
It's gotta be around here somehwhere

215
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:37,331
Aha! Here it is.

216
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,701
Maybe that video that Byron was
talking about is on here

217
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,035
Get that video delete son!

218
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,203
Why?

219
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,039
Because that video could
cost your your life

220
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,475
Uhh... that's a little dramatic

221
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:49,677
don't you think?

222
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:52,714
Haha. My life?

223
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:56,049
Uh huh... I'm going to
go check my voicemails

224
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,852
so if you'll excuse me

225
00:16:57,952 --> 00:17:02,256
I could really use some happy birthday
messages right about now

226
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,592
... you weirdos.

227
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,972
: You have 2 new voicemails

228
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,307
Press #1 to hear your messages

229
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:29,017
You pressed #1. Do you really
want to hear you messages.

230
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:32,252
Yes. That's why I pressed #1

231
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,254
Are you sure? They are not good.

232
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,890
What the -- ?

233
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,892
Yes! Why am I even talking to you?

234
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:39,694
You're just a product of Apple.

235
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:44,032
You use our technology every moment
of the day. So technically...

236
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:44,532
..so are you.

237
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:46,734
Just please play me my messages, okay.

238
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:48,201
That's all I'm asking for.

239
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:50,203
Fine but I just have to say...

240
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,907
that after hearing your messages....

241
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:55,175
you're life sounds terrible

242
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,545
I know! I know, okay!

243
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:00,414
Just play me my messages. Please.

244
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:03,417
Here, you go. First, message:

245
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:06,955
Hello, Mr. Childress, my
name is Richard Taker.

246
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:09,323
Dick Taker?

247
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,492
I'm heading the new management
team at Centrix ...

248
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:14,762
..and we're not gonna need you anymore.

249
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:18,265
In fact, never knew why we needed you
in the first place, to be honest.

250
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,702
A machine by a retard could do your job

251
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:23,538
When I asked around the office
so I should keep you...

252
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:25,873
... no one knew who you were.

253
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,810
Sorry, a little harsh

254
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,144
Anywho, take care.

255
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,281
Are you kidding me?

256
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,282
As if my life wasn't bad enough

257
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,283
I'm out of a job

258
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,150
I don't have an apartment

259
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,953
or any shred of dignity

260
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,990
Oh yeah... and my life
is no somehow at stake

261
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,324
Help me out a little bit!

262
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,401
Stupid grass!

263
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,788
: Sorry.

264
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:16,223
That first one was rough

265
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,526
I know... I know.

266
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,528
And they don't get any better

267
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:23,330
Are you sure you want
to hear the next one?

268
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,667
Yes! No -- I don't know.

269
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,770
2nd message:

270
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,004
: Yo!

271
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:31,773
What's up fuck-face! It's your big bro..

272
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:34,742
Wanted to wish you a happy
bday 'cause ....

273
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,277
Dad told me how you've been
wanting to kill yourself

274
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:41,783
and honestly it wouldn't
be that bad of an idea

275
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,350
I mean, bro...

276
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,484
you can't get laid

277
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:47,055
your job is going nowhere

278
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:49,356
and -- you're basically already dead

279
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,925
I'm kidding. Kidding.

280
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,292
I love you bro

281
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,260
No homo

282
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,361
... homo

283
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,698
End of messages.

284
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:03,336
My brother was right on every level.

285
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:07,942
It's my birthday and I'm spending it
outside of the apartment that I don't ow

286
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,277

287
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:15,149
Man, this is - this is terrible

288
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,284
My life is terrible

00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,955
It's not like... I still wanna kill myse

290
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:23,390
but at this point, I feel like dying

291
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,027

292
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:29,097
What's up cry-baby?

Drug habits!!!

317
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,514
You think I go on drugs just
because I'm black ?

318
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:04,318
No. No. I never said that.

319
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:07,054

00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:10,024

the park with a little wiener

325
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,268

00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,110
Trying to help somebody. Ha! I
don't know why she's with him?

330
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,112
She's too cute to be with him.

00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:33,446
Pssst!

00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:42,056

What the fuck?

335
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:47,328
That's the first time I've ever
been able to to understand you.

336
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,729

337
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,698

00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:56,871
this guy has our weed and
I'm trying to get it back

340
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:58,406
Oh dude, well if he has our weed:

341
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:00,408
Hey man! Can we --

342
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:01,375

343
00:24:02,977 --> 00:24:04,145
Uhhh....

344
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:05,146
everything okay over there?

345
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:06,681
Nothing! We're fine.

346
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:12,286
I think he's trying to tell
us something but ----

347
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:14,288
I don't know.

348
00:24:14,388 --> 00:24:16,691
I really can't make out what he's saying

349
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,893
He's fine. He's feeling great

350
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:21,028
He's just leaving

351
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:24,765
Bye. Bye. Bye. See you.

352
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,466
Bye.

353
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:33,174
Uhh... I'm glad that wasn't weird at all

354
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:34,976
Well look....

355
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:36,944
Can a baller get a couple
dollars over here?

356
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:38,746
Hello.

357
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:41,816
Here man. There should
be like 5 in there...

358
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,551
go get yourself a nice warm burrito

359
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:46,153
I'm sorry for calling you an addict

360
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:49,290
It's all good. Thanks for
the crack money dumbass

361
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,625
Oh come on man, I though you were my n-

362
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:54,895
Don't you dare say that word

363
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:57,198
I was going to say "New Friend"

364
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,867
that's even worse!

365
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:04,438
You think I'd be friends with a
pansies-ass panty-waste like you?

366
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:07,508
Ha! Walking around in pink
shorts.....

367
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:17,585
I'm in the money!
I'm in the money!

368
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:19,920
To get me my crackie.

369
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:30,231
Well, I officially got outsmarted
and assaulted by a crackhead

370
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:32,733
Can't say I'm surprise with
the luck I've been having

371
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:36,771
Well if it makes you feel any better dud
that's the funny shit I've ever seen

372
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,809
Ever since I started seeing her...

373
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:43,512
You mean staking her!

374
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,179
-Nooooo

375
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,180
As I was saying...

376
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,683
even without saying a word to her I knew
she was the perfect girls for me

377
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,652
And I know what your thinking --

378
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,687
-Man! You just wanna plow that ass

379
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:55,656
-No. No!

380
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:57,458
It's not that --

381
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:00,628
-Oh okay. I got it, so you
don't wanna fuck her?

382
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,997
-Well, I mean I do, but -- Hey!

383
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:05,699
...will you just let me finish for once?

384
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,368
-Haha. That's what she said.

385
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:09,703
You're weird as fuck dude.

386
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:13,040
I dig it. I'm Cameron

387
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,376
I'm Nate.

388
00:26:15,476 --> 00:26:16,777
Owww!

389
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:18,145
What the heck?!

390
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,347
What was I supposed to do?
Let you rape my tits

391
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:22,016
I was trying to shake your hand

392
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,151
Oh my bad.

393
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:28,322
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself...I
woke up naked

394
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:30,124
on that bench right there

395
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:32,493
with no recollection of what
happened that night before

396
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:35,729
Oh! and apparently there is some video
flying around of me on the internet

397
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,731
Oh I saw that, it's embarrassing as fuck

398
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:39,733
You saw it?

399
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:42,303
Yea... it's like this small

400
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:44,772
I was talking about the video

401
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:48,275
Right. I was as well.

402
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:04,692
You don't have to follow me, ya know?

403
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:10,297
You should probably just...
leave me alone.

404
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:28,315
So.... about the pillowcase in that vide

405
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,918
I can't do this anymore.
My life is terrible!

406
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:33,954
It's just so hard being alive
you know. I hate it!

407
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:36,357
I'm sure your life is fine.

408
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:38,527
My own brother told me
I should kill myself

409
00:27:38,627 --> 00:27:40,728
Oh well -- yea that's bad

410
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:42,930
So about this pillowcase....

411
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,331
Huh?

412
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,901
What about that pillowcase?

413
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,970
You, me. The park. My pillowcase.

414
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,573
You mean...like, like...

415
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:52,473
... a date?

416
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:54,675
Uh. Um, no. What?

417
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:57,646
Oh you know...something like...

418
00:27:57,745 --> 00:28:00,447
chill...and casual, you know?

419
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:03,918
Man, this is gonna suck.

420
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:06,655
But I do need my weed back

421
00:28:06,754 --> 00:28:09,223
What's worse? Boss man killing me or...

422
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:12,393
spending an entire day with
this pathetic meat flap

423
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:16,665
Fuck it. Let's do it.

424
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:19,967
I know you can help me find my pillowcas
Nate. You're so smart.

425
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:23,771
Well.... okay

426
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:27,007
Wait.... there's...

427
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:29,009
something weird about this

428
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:31,546
You've never been this nice
to me. What's going on?

429
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:34,081
Uh, nothing. No. There's nothing
illegal in the pillowcase

430
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:37,484
There's nothing weird. I .... I....

431
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,356
Who said anything about it being illegal

432
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:47,761
No you can't!

433
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:49,531
Whoa!!!

434
00:28:49,631 --> 00:28:50,998
Look!

435
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,934
You're friend!

436
00:28:55,302 --> 00:28:57,404
He just got dragged into the
bush by a homeless man

437
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:59,206
I'm not surprised

438
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:01,509
You know how high that
kid is all the time ?

439
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,077
I'm mean I literally watched
him bake a cake

440
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:05,446
I'm mean, that's pretty normal

441
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:07,781
He was using glue as the frosting!

442
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,820
I seriously think he was taken,
maybe we should call the cops

443
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,523
No! Don't call the cops!

444
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:16,890
Don't worry about him. He's fine.

445
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:19,226
Don't worry about my friend

446
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:23,497
So you wanna tell me why you were uh....

447
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:25,466
rocking out with your cock
out in that video?

448
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:27,468
Na uh.

449
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:28,603
Come on! Tell me

450
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:29,837
Na uh.

451
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:33,340
Come on, I'm literally bored as
shit, I'll just keep asking you

452
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,409
No! It's embarrassing

453
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,477
Tell me!

454
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:37,244
Not gonna happen

455
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:39,280
Come on tell me, I wanna know!

456
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:39,947
No!!!

457
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:40,814
Tell me!!!!

458
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:41,650
No!!!!!

459
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,017
TELL ME BITCH!!!

460
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,353
Yeah, just tell her already.

461
00:29:57,364 --> 00:29:59,768
Seriously, who are you guys
and what do you want?

462
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:02,202
Don't worry about who we are

463
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:03,605
I don't know even know who I am

464
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:05,806
Then why have you been
following me around all day?

465
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:06,874
We are here to help you

466
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:08,876
And what is that supposed to mean?

467
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,211
I said don't worry about it!!!

468
00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:20,120
I remember, I'm supposed
to tell you something

469
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:27,227
Hello?

470
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:30,197
Hello?! Yo!!

471
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:34,134
Come on!!!

472
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,437
Hello?

473
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:38,573
Hello! Wake up old fuck

474
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:44,178
Do you remember what he's
trying to tell us?

475
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,714
Yep.

476
00:30:45,814 --> 00:30:47,716
And are you going to tell us?

477
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:49,083
Nope

478
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:54,723
It's way funnier this way

479
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:57,424
I don't wanna die! What will
be funnier this way?

480
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:59,226
You'll see

481
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:02,229
Come on. He's not quite ready yet

482
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:04,431
Where are you guys going?!!!

483
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:05,966
I'm ready. I'm ready.

484
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:08,235
I think I'm ready.

485
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:10,572
Hey come back....trust me...

486
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:15,008
Is it just me or was that really weird

487
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:17,444
Do you know what he was going to say?

488
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:19,947
Chill out dude

489
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,449
Excuse me?

490
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,252
My life is falling apart in front of
my eyes and you want me to chill?

491
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,455
Yep. Pretty much. I know just what'll he

492
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:30,792
Smoke this.

493
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:33,093
No, no, no, no, no.

494
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:35,630
That is not going to help. I promise you

495
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,566
I can't. I wont.

496
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:40,367
No. I'm not gonna hit that.

497
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:42,570
Seriously dude? You're
going to be like that?

498
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,773
Stop being such a pussy

499
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:47,975
This is the last of my stash I'm
trying o be nice, for once

500
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,414
No. I don't want to smoke it

501
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:55,617
You're literally a high
speed tampon tunnel

502
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:57,951
just fucking smoke it!

503
00:31:59,486 --> 00:32:02,456
I'm not a highway --- speed, whatever!

504
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:04,091
I'm not.

505
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:05,894
Let me ask you something and be honest

506
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:10,130
How has your life turned out
so far by NOT smoking weed?

507
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:13,066
Dang it. She's right.

508
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,135
Wait! That doesn't mean that suddenly

509
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:18,338
things are going to be better
because I'm high

510
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:21,041
Wait, isn't that the point
of getting high?

511
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:24,211
Gosh...this is so confusing

512
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,548
So you're going to hit
this or what my dude?

513
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:35,088
She called me "her dude"?

514
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,090
That's so cool!!!!

515
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:39,059
How can I possibly say "no" to her?

516
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:41,395
I'm her "dude"

517
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:44,331
Wait Cameron!

518
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,547
I don't know what it is about her?
But she's everything I'm not

519
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,587
She's exactly what I need my entire life

520
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:12,392
And this is my chance to be,
not the wimp I always am

521
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:16,063
This is the chance to
change my crappy life

522
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,766
Just smoke the damn thing Nate

523
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:20,768
And tell her... tell her how you feel

524
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:23,103
This. Is. Your. Moment ---

525
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:26,841
I uh--- yeah.. fine

526
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:29,176
screw it

527
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:32,145
I'll give it a try

528
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:47,529
First time, I see

529
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:51,365
What gave it away...the coughing?

530
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:54,034
No. Pretty much just everything about yo

531
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:56,370
I got it. I got it.

532
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:06,648
Are you gonna pass that shit or what?

533
00:34:06,748 --> 00:34:10,450
And totally unrelated do you
have any recollection

534
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:12,720
of where you put that pillowcase?

535
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,223
Are you good dude?

536
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:19,459
Damn dude, you're dope
cherry is popping hard

537
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:28,101
I swear my shit's not laced

538
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,742
Seriously ?

539
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:36,476
I have to have a frickin'
seizure five minutes

540
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:38,478
into my first date with
the love of my life

541
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,815
Really Nate? That's what you're doing

542
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:45,152
Are you good dude?

543
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:10,310
Come on dude! Snap out of it!

544
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:31,231
What the??? Why are you smiling?

545
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:44,244
He's going straight towards that shit

546
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:46,581
Come on, snap out of it dude!

547
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,318
Oh my god, no!

548
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:53,855
Is that a boner?

549
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:56,189
Ewww!

550
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:02,295
Oh my God, it is a fucking boner!

551
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:04,632
Or is it? Seriously, I can't tell.

552
00:36:23,051 --> 00:36:25,285
Nate ...

553
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,589
Nate ...

554
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,760
Hello! Are you okay?

555
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,495
Nate! Hello!

556
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:38,566
Little pecker boy. Earth to baby dick.

557
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:42,103
Come on little pincho, let's go!

558
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,438
That rock could've killed

559
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:54,515
Whoa!

560
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:00,655
Am I still dreaming?

561
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:03,958
First time getting your rocks off?

562
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:05,159
'Cause the rocks.

563
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:06,794
You saved my life

564
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,597
Ew. You are hard.

565
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:13,266
Oh shit. This is too easy. If
I tell him I saved his life

566
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:16,104
he'll definitely have to
find my weed for me

567
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:17,304
I don't know how to thank you

568
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,706
Oh, I do.

569
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:21,241
Really, anything . I'll do it.

570
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:24,411
About that pillowcase?

571
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:51,038
Come on man! We gave you money
already. Now what do you want?

572
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:53,674
I saw you over here shaking
with a little hard on

573
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:56,711
I heard some yelling and shit
I wanna make sure you alright

574
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:58,513
Yah, I'm fine.

575
00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:00,948
Wait, don't you remember
what you saw earlier

576
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:02,315
Oh yeah...

577
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:04,619
Hey... you dragged her
friend into the bush

578
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,689
You know where my dealer
is --- ah, I mean friend

579
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,358
You know where he went, do you?

580
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:14,195
Your friend? He went into...like a bush

581
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:18,666
aka my summer home, thank you very much

582
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:22,003
And I just figure... since
you live in a bush

583
00:38:22,103 --> 00:38:25,740
Look, let me tell you something:

584
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,742
I don't know nothing else, look

585
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:30,578
I just came over here because he was
shaking his shit with a little hard on

586
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:32,914
that's all I know, don't ask me stuff

587
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,888
Wait! Why do you give a fuck about
Nate? No one cares about Nate

588
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:44,625
I just came here because he gave me some
crack money, i figure he's nice

589
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:48,361
You know, tit for tat, tit for tat

590
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:50,463
You're getting pretty fucking defensive

591
00:38:50,565 --> 00:38:52,800
Why don't you tell me where my dealer is

592
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:56,336
Dealer????

593
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:58,639
Friend. Damn it. Friend.

594
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,075
You know...you bet -- I gotta go

595
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:03,343
See ya!

596
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:07,014
Where are you going, you have no where
to go! You're a homeless man.

597
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:09,884
I'm like Flash. Crack Flash.

598
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:11,686
That was pretty low

599
00:39:11,786 --> 00:39:13,353
You probably should apologize

600
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:15,690
Apologize?! Why should I apologize?

601
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,795
Maybe we can still catch him?

602
00:39:20,895 --> 00:39:22,997
Wee!!!!

603
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:25,233
Or not.

604
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:27,702
I'm sorry, I understand you have
to find your pillowcase

605
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:30,071
No, you don't understand Nate!

606
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:32,340
I can tell from knowing you for
like 20 minutes that you

607
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:34,474
don't see things for what they are

608
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:39,547
You stand around all worhtless and
ignorant, like Rosie O'Donnell's vagina

609
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:41,849
I don't need your help.
I can find it myself

610
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:43,684
Wait....

611
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:45,820
What?

612
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:47,989
Nothing.

613
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:50,124
Nevermind.

614
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:53,027
Okay??

615
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,502
Not so fast sister!

616
00:40:01,602 --> 00:40:03,804
The hell you want rugrat?

617
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,473
Ah!!!

618
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:08,309
I wouldn't try anything
crazy if I were you?

619
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,111
Oh yea, and why is that?

620
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:13,147
Because there's a cop in the
park but you can't see him

621
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,482
-What? -So?

622
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:17,652
He's right

623
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:19,987
Oh yea? A cop? Then who is it then?

624
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:24,292
Oh my gosh!!! You're a Narc

625
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:26,360
I knew it! You're way to lame to be norm

626
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:28,029
-It's not ---
-I'm not a cop!

627
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:30,898
Yeah. You are! I may be
high but I'm no dumb

628
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,499
What?

629
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,069
What would a cop wanna do with
a stupid pillowcase anyway?

630
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:37,505
Well this has been fun. Let's
go, enough for now.

631
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:39,840
Don't worry Nate. This
is al part of the plan

632
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:45,646
What plan? Tell me the plan!

633
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:48,448
So is this it, to arrest me?

634
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:51,953
Becuase you were too afraid to
do it before, pussy-police man

635
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:54,088
No!!!

636
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,992
What a birthday...

637
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:01,128
Oh, I'm sure that's your
whole cover story.

638
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:03,130
An innocent little birthday
boy undercover Narc

639
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:08,169
I can't believe I'm in love wit you
considering how mean you are

640
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:09,971
Ha! You're in love with me?

641
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:13,007
I just called you a whinny little bitch

642
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:17,011
Oh! And I forgot to tell you. She's
only using you by the way.

643
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:18,579
Using me?

644
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,348
What could she be using me for?

645
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:23,150
You'll see.

646
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,455
So I'm stuck with an undercover
cop who's in live whit me?

647
00:41:27,555 --> 00:41:29,991
I wish I could say this is the
first time this is happened

648
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:34,362
What the fuck are you laughing at?

649
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:36,163
Oh you were serious...

650
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:38,399
Wait , this is really happened
to you before?

651
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,201
Yeah, a lot of weird shit has happen to

652
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:44,505
Abusive boyfriend, absent father,
you don't see me crying about it

653
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,841
I didn't know all that happened to you

654
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:52,646
Wait, if you're not a Narc, finish this

655
00:41:52,747 --> 00:41:55,082
the entire thing

656
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,585
No way! Last time I did that I almost di

657
00:41:57,685 --> 00:41:59,820
It's just a joint

658
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,057
You're not going to die, I know. I sell

659
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:05,926
What were you going to say?

660
00:42:06,027 --> 00:42:06,761
Nothing

661
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:08,029
No! Right there-- I know!

662
00:42:08,129 --> 00:42:09,230
You said - I knew ....
right there, you said

663
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:09,897
No.

664
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:10,765
You would know because you sell ....?

665
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:12,566
Stop interrogating me Narc!

666
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:14,568
I'm not. I'm not a Narc!

667
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:15,836
Hold up a second...

668
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:17,371
why is it such a big deal if I was a cop

669
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,939
Because....

670
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,909
I guess I should come clean now...

671
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:24,245
The whole reason why I have this
pillowcase is because --

672
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:32,620
Did you hear that?

673
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,622
It came from over there

674
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:37,391
What the hell was that?

675
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:39,827
I don't know but it came from that bush

676
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:41,462
What is it with bushes these days?

677
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,964
Eh? Everyone shaving them.

678
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,566
No?

679
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:00,281
Ow!!

680
00:43:02,817 --> 00:43:06,253
Urg! What the hell is that smell?

681
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:07,955
I knew I smelled half
digested Chipotle....

682
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:10,624
... what the hell are you doing dude?

683
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:12,893
I was uh - uh--

684
00:43:12,993 --> 00:43:15,496
Where you masturbating in the bush?

685
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,364
Uh... yea!!

686
00:43:17,465 --> 00:43:18,632
Actually, I was jerking it!

687
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:19,633
Man, I was getting it on!

688
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:20,634
Shit. Ain't no big deal

689
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:21,836
More room after this.

690
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:24,171
It's afternoon delight time

691
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:26,707
That's why you have the creepy
little smirk on your face

692
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,310
Then what was that noise?

693
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:32,012
Well - it- it was porn!

694
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:35,616
Really? Because I never heard
porn sound like that before

695
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:38,352
Oh yea... cause you're the expert on por

696
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:41,255
Hey dawg! Crackheads are into
some freaky ass shit

697
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:42,790
you don't know nothing about

698
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,193
Well then go weirdly masturbate

699
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:47,695
No, bad crackhead!

700
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:49,697
Git! Git!

701
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:51,398
No! Get out of there!

702
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:53,000
Go!

703
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,635
Wait! What about your friend?

704
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:55,870
He never told us about that!

705
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,204
Yea, what did you do with my dealer ---

706
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:59,240
ahh...I mean friend.

707
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,041
Catch me if you can!!!

708
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:03,277
Can't forget my beer bottle

709
00:44:03,377 --> 00:44:06,447
I know some bad people that can
do some bad things to you!

710
00:44:06,548 --> 00:44:07,882
Hey, we're back!

711
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:10,918
I hate to ruin the moment but
I got some more news for you

712
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:12,453

news to work here brat

713
00:44:12,554 --> 00:44:13,754
but thanks

714
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,789
I'm sick of all of this!

715
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,527
Whatever you have to say, just say it!

716
00:44:18,627 --> 00:44:20,728
Ummm....

717
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:22,463
Maybe it's a clue or something

718
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:24,899
A clue? This isn't a game Nate

719
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:27,301
We need to find the pillowcase before
the cop does or else ---

720
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:31,205
Wait, Why does it matter if the cops
find the stupid pillowcase anyways?

721
00:44:34,775 --> 00:44:35,910
I'm waiting....

722
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,112
you guys want to hear what
I have to say or not?

723
00:44:38,212 --> 00:44:39,446
-Yes! -No!

724
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:42,316
Where am I? What happened?

725
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,451
Who pulled the catheter out?

726
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:48,523
Oh you!

727
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:52,726
I know wher you put that
Poke-GAY-Man pillowcase

728
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:54,361
Where the fuck is it, Old Man?!

729
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:55,062
Tell me!

730
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:57,398
Yeah, where is that shit?

731
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:01,636
Are you two gonna tell me or no?

732
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:03,437
It's simple, you have two options...

733
00:45:03,538 --> 00:45:06,207
...you can tell me what
you know or you can die

734
00:45:06,307 --> 00:45:08,475
Yeah, 'cause you're really
the one in charge here

735
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:11,613
I'd say so considering I can
twist your twerpy ass neck

736
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:13,013
Look! We've all had a long day

737
00:45:13,113 --> 00:45:15,015
... why don't you just tell
us where it is, okay?

738
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:17,418
'Cause I want you to find it, not her!

739
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:19,887
Why? It's hers!

740
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:21,822
Not if she can't find it

741
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:24,526
Where the fuck is my pillowcase
snot-nose mistake?

742
00:45:24,626 --> 00:45:26,227
I don't know where it is....

743
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:28,495
He does.

744
00:45:28,597 --> 00:45:30,497
I- I - seem to remember...

745
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,499
I can't ---

746
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:34,502
I can't recall what ---

747
00:45:34,603 --> 00:45:36,504
where it is...

748
00:45:36,605 --> 00:45:38,607
I just can't seem to remember

749
00:45:38,707 --> 00:45:40,808
Uhh... does that mean you don't
know where it is Old Man

750
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:43,110
Whoa! Whoa!!! Okay...

751
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,812
Let's just calm down, okay

752
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:46,548
People are starting to stare

753
00:45:46,648 --> 00:45:48,349
Whatever! I don't give a fuck dude.

754
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,784
...if they aren't going to tell
me where my pillow case is...

755
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:53,153
I don't need them. And I don't need you!

756
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:55,322
Wait...what?

757
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:59,193
You really don't understand that I've be
using you to get to my pillowcase

758
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:01,862
Well, I though that we were --

759
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:03,931
"We" .... aren't shit Nate.

760
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,703
Not only are you depressing as fuck but
you're too stupid to know I'm using you

761
00:46:08,802 --> 00:46:09,837
to find my pillowcase

762
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:12,106
Oh my God! I gotta go!

763
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,108
That stupid ass little short
and a polk-a-dot tshirt ...

764
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:16,511
Who wear bow ties anymore?

765
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:19,648
Wow. This is awkward...

766
00:46:19,748 --> 00:46:21,982
Looks like we did our job here

767
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:27,788
It's your fucking birthday dude...
go do something fun like...

768
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:30,157
I don't know... kill yourself.

769
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:33,827
Haha!! And I thought I was
roasting millimeter Peter

770
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:35,929
Haha! Good job boo

771
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,332
What's up little dick motherfucka?

772
00:46:38,432 --> 00:46:41,335
Okay, seriously...how do you
guys know each other?

773
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,406
You still ain't found that shit yet?

774
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:48,242
Uhh... no?

775
00:46:48,342 --> 00:46:50,477
Come on baby girl...you konw that my shi

776
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:53,314
If you don't figure this
out I will kill you.

777
00:46:53,414 --> 00:46:55,684
Seriously!!! What the heck
is going on here?

778
00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:58,152
If this was so important,
how did I end up with it?

779
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:00,755
Hold up... not so Magic Mike has a point

780
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:03,123
How did he get that shit?

781
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:05,893
So this motherfucka, done stole our shit

782
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:07,895
Whoa! "Our" shit?

783
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:10,898
Cameron...how do you know my landlord?

784
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:15,069
This beautiful bitch is my daughter

785
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:19,507
And you just called your own
daughter a little bitch?

786
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:20,642
Hell yea I did!

787
00:47:20,742 --> 00:47:23,077
But she' not even black?

788
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:25,079
She's not my real daughter

789
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:27,081
Right, like I was supposed to --

790
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,083
Don't back talk me baby-dick

791
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:31,085
She metaphorically speaking my daughter.

792
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:33,420
...we done did business together for yea

793
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:36,591
Oh... my.... gosh....

794
00:47:36,691 --> 00:47:37,858
I knew it!

795
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,894
I knew it! This whole time I didn't
want to believe it but ...

796
00:47:40,994 --> 00:47:41,962
What?! What the fuck?

797
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:43,765
You knew what I do this whole time?

798
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:47,167
Well yea....I mean, I didn't
think it was true but ...

799
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:48,035
Yea...

800
00:47:48,135 --> 00:47:49,604
...you're a prostitute.

801
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:52,973
I'm no hoe.

802
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:55,342
I may be a lot of things but
I'm not a fucking hooker

803
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:58,078
...and even if I were I wouldn't
be interested in you.

804
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,848
Really?

805
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:01,850
Have I not made it clear to you Nate...

806
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:04,184
... that I don't give a fuck about you

807
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,421
But... but you saved my life

808
00:48:07,522 --> 00:48:09,156
About that.... I didn't.

809
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:11,158
But you pushed me out of the way

810
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,026
No.

811
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:14,696
But you took credit for
it when I thank you

812
00:48:14,796 --> 00:48:15,229
I know!

813
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:17,565
I taught her everything she knows baby!

814
00:48:19,634 --> 00:48:21,902
I can't believe you guys

815
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:24,204
You know what...

816
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:26,206
Maybe I will go kill myself...

817
00:48:26,306 --> 00:48:28,208
.. and put an end to this
whole stupid day.

818
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:30,578
Good luck! Hope you actually
succeed this time

819
00:48:30,678 --> 00:48:33,615
Or maybe... maybe I'll find that
pillowcase before you guys...

820
00:48:33,715 --> 00:48:35,015
... and never give it back to you!

821
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:36,684
That's right!

822
00:48:36,785 --> 00:48:39,019
Kiss this little wiener goodbye!

823
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:43,157
Owww! That hurt.

824
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:45,459
Let's try this again.

825
00:48:50,832 --> 00:48:53,066
Stop chasing me!!!

826
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:57,639
I don't need you guys in my life!

827
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:01,208
I'm never gonna give back that pillowcas

828
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:07,014
You don't even know where you going!!!!

829
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:14,656

831
00:49:16,591 --> 00:49:18,992
My kidneys 'bout to explode out this bit

832
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:29,069
You got me chasing this guy around
in my motherfuckin' dress shoes?

833
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:31,271
So you been out here fucking up all day?

834
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:32,306
Uh huh....

835
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:34,308
So why the fuck are you still
standing here then??

836
00:49:34,408 --> 00:49:37,745
You better figure this shit out and
find my motherfuckin' pillowcase

837
00:49:37,846 --> 00:49:39,747
.... or you're going to meet
this long cold hard ---

838
00:49:39,848 --> 00:49:41,950
Please don't make me suck
your dick....please! No!

839
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:44,686
Don't make me suck your dick! Please....

840
00:49:44,786 --> 00:49:48,055
What?!!! Bitch, I don't want no
motherfuckin' head from you !!!

841
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:50,090
I'm talking about my gun!

842
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,059
You better get this shit right.

843
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:54,361
I don't know which is worse.....oh God

844
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,065
Silly bitch.

845
00:50:08,977 --> 00:50:11,211
Where the heck did I put this pillowcase

846
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,216
Okay... what would I be doing if I was

847
00:50:16,316 --> 00:50:18,753
running around naked in a park,
blacked out ---

848
00:50:28,596 --> 00:50:31,131
Hello...

849
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:33,535
: Sup fag...

850
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:36,103
Nice. Always good to hear from my big br

851
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:38,673
How's your asshole little bro?
Sore? Loose?

852
00:50:38,773 --> 00:50:41,108
Do you have to wear a diapers
from all the butt-sex?

853
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:45,613
Do you even have control over your
bowel movements anymore??? Haha!

854
00:50:45,713 --> 00:50:48,148
I'd take it you haven't killed
yourself yet, am I right?

855
00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:51,819
Uh.. yeah. No, not yet.

856
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,320
Pshhh....weak

857
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,055
So what have you been doing today?

858
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:57,090
Trying to look for this little kid...

859
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,392
That's not creepy at all

860
00:50:58,492 --> 00:50:59,761
No it's not like that....

861
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:01,829
... he has my pillowcase.

862
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,998
That didn't make it any less
weird, what the fuck?

863
00:51:04,097 --> 00:51:06,801
Look, it's a complicated
situation alright?

864
00:51:06,901 --> 00:51:08,468
After I got evicted this morning --

865
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,269
Ouch!

866
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:12,040
Yea... anyways...

867
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:15,910
After I got evicted, this old man
and this kid came up to me ...

868
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,780
... telling me this weird
and random information

869
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,017
Oh! And I talked to the girl I've
liked in like forever...

870
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:26,888
... now I have to find her pillowcase
before she does.

871
00:51:26,988 --> 00:51:27,822
Why?

872
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:28,856
What do you mean why?

873
00:51:28,957 --> 00:51:30,858
The pillowcase doesn't even matter...

874
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:31,759
Bro...

875
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:34,596
... you're life is still going
to be shitty anyways

876
00:51:34,696 --> 00:51:36,898
Well...what if it has a
whole bunch of money?

877
00:51:36,998 --> 00:51:40,501
So what if it does... you wont have
anyone to spend the money with

878
00:51:40,602 --> 00:51:43,337
You've never had girlfriend.
And mom died last year...

879
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:45,974
...and she was like your
only friend, ever.

880
00:51:46,074 --> 00:51:47,041
Wow man...

881
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,610
... you're the best.

882
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,410
No problem bro

883
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:52,279
I figured if you hadn't
killed yourself yet,

884
00:51:52,379 --> 00:51:54,082
you needed a little dose of reality

885
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:56,416
... little motivation

886
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:01,789
Yea...

887
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:06,426
You're going to die today

888
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,664
I don't care how small that things
is... it's still harassment

889
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:13,067
That's even worse!

890
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:17,038
You think I'd be friends with a little
pansies-ass panty waste like you?

891
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,840
It's like this small

892
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,109
You're in love with me, I just called
you a whinny little bitch

893
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:25,546
Have I not made it clear Nate, that
I don't give a fuck about you

894
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:34,022
You're right man... yo'ure
absolutely right.

895
00:52:34,122 --> 00:52:36,156
Facts bro. Facts. Big facts.

896
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:40,360
I cant' believe I let myself believe
that any of this mattered.

897
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,162
Haha. Come on Nate...

898
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:45,933
Nate, I'm just fucking with you ! Don't
actually do anything you dumb-ass....

899
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:51,304
Nate, are you there?

900
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:53,508
Nate pick up the phone!!!

901
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:56,077
Don't actually do it dumb-ass!

902
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:58,412
Nate!!! Nate!!!

903
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:13,460
Why am I so worthless?

904
00:53:17,065 --> 00:53:19,299
I miss you Mom....

905
00:53:40,188 --> 00:53:42,289
Oh oh!!! Is he doing what
I think he's doing?

906
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:43,691
I think so...

907
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:46,561
You youngsters and you're crazy
ways of masterbating

908
00:53:46,661 --> 00:53:48,563
Back in my day, all we had to do was ---

909
00:53:48,663 --> 00:53:49,931
He's going to freaking kill himself!!

910
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:50,698
Who??

911
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:51,566
Him!

912
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:52,066
What?

913
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,067
Our guy!

914
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,068
What guy??

915
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:54,969
Nate!

916
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:55,570
Nick?

917
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,003
Nate!!!

918
00:53:56,104 --> 00:53:57,004
Nick???

919
00:53:57,105 --> 00:53:58,639
We have to do something! Quick!

920
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,775
Nick who?

921
00:54:04,645 --> 00:54:06,547
Good thing we ain't looking
for Nate's dick....

922
00:54:06,647 --> 00:54:08,883
.... we'd never find that shit

923
00:54:10,151 --> 00:54:11,853
What the fuck you smiling for?

924
00:54:11,953 --> 00:54:14,922
You don't smile unless I say
you can motherfucking smile

925
00:54:16,691 --> 00:54:18,593
Matter of fact, you can smile
when you find my shit

926
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:21,461
You know how much that motherfucking
pillowcase was worth?

927
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:24,364
Yea... I know I can pay like
5 months rent with it

928
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:26,567
Why the fuck did you lose it then?

929
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:28,569
I didn't lose it , it got stolen!

930
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:31,271
You allowed it to get stolen! Boom Bitch

931
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:33,241
It's your motherfucking fault!

932
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,209
I didn't say it was stolen from me?

933
00:54:35,308 --> 00:54:36,711
From who then????

934
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:38,913
I don't know. Probably that
stoner kid you hire

935
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:40,148
Who???

936
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:41,816
The kid that's stoned all the time....

937
00:54:43,918 --> 00:54:45,820
That motherfucka?

938
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,220
Yeah....

939
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,420
Where is he then?

940
00:54:47,522 --> 00:54:50,892
I don't know...he just disappeared
into some bush

941
00:54:50,992 --> 00:54:54,862
Not where the fuck is he then...where
the fuck is he NOW?

942
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,672
No fucking way....

943
00:55:04,772 --> 00:55:06,339
Bitch how much that shit
have you been smoking?

944
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:08,341
No , look!

945
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:10,678
That kid is about to hang himself

946
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:18,619
He is about to kill himself?

947
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,189
Dope. That's dope as a motherfucker.

948
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:23,356
No! Not dope.

949
00:55:23,456 --> 00:55:26,393
Even though he's kind of a pussy
he shouldn't hang himself

950
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:28,196
Bitch what???

951
00:55:28,296 --> 00:55:30,198
I gotta do something! I can't
let him hang himself....

952
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:33,134
I almost let him die once today already.
I'm not that shitty of a person

953
00:55:33,234 --> 00:55:34,202
Yes, you is.

954
00:55:34,302 --> 00:55:35,837
No....

955
00:55:35,937 --> 00:55:37,972
Not anymore.

956
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:41,408
Bitch what????

957
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:58,358
This is it Nate!

958
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:00,161
This will make everything better

959
00:56:00,261 --> 00:56:04,031
This is your chance to end all
the pain and sufffering

960
00:56:04,131 --> 00:56:06,366
Just jump off this branch...

961
00:56:07,268 --> 00:56:09,503
... and end your crappy life

962
00:56:12,273 --> 00:56:14,742
Wait Nate, don't kill yourself!!!

963
00:56:14,842 --> 00:56:16,277
What are you guys doing here?

964
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:17,311
I don't know actually

965
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,815
Nate, don't do this! I know your life
is pretty freaking terrible...

966
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:22,783
... but that doesn't mean
you have to kill yourself

967
00:56:22,884 --> 00:56:24,919
because your wiener
is smaller than mine

968
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:27,288
Why should I listen to you?
Who even are you guys?

969
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:28,556
Why are you guys doing this to me?

970
00:56:28,656 --> 00:56:31,458
All you've done is complicate
my entire day!!!

971
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:33,561
Huh? What do you want little kid? What?

972
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:35,296
Leave me alone!

973
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:36,564
I don't --

974
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:38,566
You say " I don't" one more time...

975
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:41,369
I swear! I swear I'll jump off!

976
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:43,070
Calm down pussy

977
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,872
I won't calm down , okay!

978
00:56:44,972 --> 00:56:48,709
My life is filled with anxiety,
depression and bad luck!

979
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:51,178
Okay, I wont come down!

980
00:56:51,279 --> 00:56:53,748
Screw this! I'm done.

981
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:56,984
Dude stop!!!!

982
00:56:59,153 --> 00:57:00,988
You came back for me?

983
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:02,857
Look, I know I've been
a bitch to you all day but

984
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:05,159
I'm not going to stand around
and let you die

985
00:57:06,459 --> 00:57:07,561
What are "they" doing here?

986
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:08,629
Good question.

987
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,031
We are here to protect him

988
00:57:10,131 --> 00:57:11,498
Protect him? From what?

989
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:12,667
From you for one thing

990
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:14,735
What is that supposed to mean?
You talk in riddles

991
00:57:14,835 --> 00:57:17,338
I guess we should finally tell you...

992
00:57:17,437 --> 00:57:19,674
See this young man and I... we are--

993
00:57:21,676 --> 00:57:23,544
Mothergoose....

994
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:25,146
Toddler-Genitals doesn't know a thing.

995
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:27,848
I repeat....Toddler-Genitals
doesn't have a clue

996
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,850
Oh no! Not this fucker again....

997
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:34,956
What do you want homie? You've
been following us all day

998
00:57:36,357 --> 00:57:38,259
Seriously man! Enough's enough, okay...

999
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:40,594
... you've been following us --- whoa!!!

1000
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:50,504
I can't breathe! Someone help....

1001
00:57:54,508 --> 00:57:56,711
Get him down!!!!

1002
00:58:02,717 --> 00:58:04,952
Ahhhh!!!!!!!!

1003
00:58:14,428 --> 00:58:15,463
You were going to let me die....again

1004
00:58:15,563 --> 00:58:17,365
No! I ---

1005
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:19,100
You moved.

1006
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,901
But you didn't

1007
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:22,903
Dude, I was going to save him!!!

1008
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:26,407
He would've died if that noose
wasn't made by such an idiot

1009
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:28,743
You did kind of let him fall

1010
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:32,346
No! Bad crackhead...

1011
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:34,682
Gotta go!!!

1012
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,786
I should follow her. See ya.

1013
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:42,123
Can't catch me blondie!

1014
00:58:45,026 --> 00:58:47,094
I wonder why he keeps doing that?

1015
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:48,329
I know why!!

1016
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:50,664
Oh really? Why??

1017
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,902
I forgot.

1018
00:58:55,002 --> 00:58:56,505
Shocker.

1019
00:58:56,604 --> 00:58:59,974
At least he didn't almost
let me kill myself twice.

1020
00:59:00,074 --> 00:59:02,309
I didn't let you kill yourself...it
was a reaction

1021
00:59:05,012 --> 00:59:08,482
Who the care Nate! We all would've
let you die out here

1022
00:59:08,582 --> 00:59:11,052
I heard you know where my
pillowcase is little boy?

1023
00:59:11,152 --> 00:59:13,254
Oh yea... and why should I tell you?

1024
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:14,622
Why u should tell me?

1025
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:16,223
Oh my gosh!

1026
00:59:16,323 --> 00:59:18,392
This is why you should
tell me motherfucker!

1027
00:59:18,492 --> 00:59:19,760
Dude, put that shit away!

1028
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,631
Tell me where that pillowcase is or I'm
going to pop a cap in both your asses!

1029
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:25,966
Pop a cap?

1030
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:29,270
Ah! I think I get it now

1031
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:33,074
Calm down. It's in the only
hole dug in the park idiot

1032
00:59:33,174 --> 00:59:37,378
Jesus Byron! What are you doing? What
does a landlord need a gun for?

1033
00:59:37,478 --> 00:59:40,448
Goddamn bro, yo really don't see
things for what they is do you?

1034
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:41,348
He really doesn't

1035
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:44,418
You're ignorant. Not like politically
correct ignorant

1036
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:47,388
... like completely ignorant to everythi

1037
00:59:47,488 --> 00:59:49,190
What are you guys doing?

1038
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:53,094
You don't see things for how
they really are, Norman

1039
00:59:53,194 --> 00:59:56,397
They are all filtered in that
messed up head of yours

1040
00:59:56,497 --> 01:00:00,734
I want an example... how
do I not "see" things?

1041
01:00:00,835 --> 01:00:02,837
You haven't seen that this
girl is just using you

1042
01:00:02,937 --> 01:00:07,007
That's 'cause she's not... is she?

1043
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:11,011
Of course the girl of my
dreams would be using me

1044
01:00:11,112 --> 01:00:13,347
I'm the girl of your dreams

1045
01:00:17,118 --> 01:00:19,153
Well yea....

1046
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:23,592
Oh shit... maybe the girl
of your wet dreams

1047
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:25,126
Fuck you dude.

1048
01:00:25,226 --> 01:00:26,694
Fuck me, bitch?

1049
01:00:26,794 --> 01:00:29,463
I can end your motherfucking
life right now

1050
01:00:29,564 --> 01:00:32,733
Thanks Nate. That's like the nixes
things anyone has ever said to me...

1051
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,401
but I'm really not though

1052
01:00:34,503 --> 01:00:36,937
I wish you could see yourself
the way I see you.

1053
01:00:42,877 --> 01:00:45,779
I don't know what's happening...but
whatever it is....

1054
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,883
...it's really cute

1055
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:51,018
It's only fitting that you

1057
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:56,525
If this works out perfectly...you can
stay with your percker-wood boyfriend

1058
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:59,226
I'll go find my shit and you're out.

1059
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,495
Wait! I'm you're business partner,
I wont have a job!

1060
01:01:01,596 --> 01:01:05,499
I don't care if you have a job,

1061
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,902
I'm coming back and I'm killing everybod

1062
01:01:08,002 --> 01:01:10,337
That's alright. He'll never find it anyw

1063
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:12,072
And how do you know that?

1064
01:01:14,643 --> 01:01:15,510
I forgot!

1065
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,811
You don't! Exactly

1066
01:01:28,122 --> 01:01:30,357
Cameron! Wait! Please!

1067
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:47,708
Cameron... it can't be that bad

1068
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:50,477
I mean what's the worst that can happen
if he finds it before you do?

1069
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:52,012
He shoots me

1070
01:01:52,112 --> 01:01:53,314
Oh.

1071
01:01:53,414 --> 01:01:54,215
...and you.

1072
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:55,550
What??

1073
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,084
No one's getting shot

1074
01:01:57,184 --> 01:01:59,420
Oh yea? How did the barrel
of the pistol taste?

1075
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:02,990
Cameron, I think it would be easier if y
just told me what is in that pillowcase?

1076
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:05,326
Why is it so important?

1077
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:11,600
Tell him the truth ... for once

1078
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,602
What the fuck? How are you in my thought

1079
01:02:13,702 --> 01:02:15,236
Don't worry about that

1080
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,905
What the -- ?

1081
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:19,907
Tell Nate you sell drugs

1082
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:21,576
Poor guy thinks the world of you

1083
01:02:21,676 --> 01:02:23,877
The least you can do is tell him the tru

1084
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,717
Soooo.... are you going to tell me?

1085
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:31,418
Ok Nate... the pillowcase has ---

1086
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:32,419
Money!

1087
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,922
Money, isn't it?

1088
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:37,124
Yeah... yea....

1089
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:37,891
It's money

1090
01:02:37,992 --> 01:02:40,394
I knew it! It had to be money

1091
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:41,862
Yeah? Yeah!

1092
01:02:41,962 --> 01:02:44,198
There's money in the pillowcase!

1093
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,936
Gosh Cameron... this is so bad

1094
01:02:49,036 --> 01:02:50,672
This is so bad!

1095
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:52,574
Is it a lot of money?

1096
01:02:52,674 --> 01:02:54,375
Yah! It's a lot of money!

1097
01:02:54,475 --> 01:02:57,411
That's why we need to find
it before Byron does!

1098
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:59,947
Why? Why would it matter? Who
cares if you find his ---

1099
01:03:02,016 --> 01:03:04,251
So wait! Who's money is it?

1100
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:07,187
It... I... it's like..

1101
01:03:07,288 --> 01:03:09,323
both of ours

1102
01:03:09,423 --> 01:03:11,859
I don't get it. What is that
even suppose to mean?

1103
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:16,263
I can't believe I'm about to do this...

1104
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:21,636
Nate...

1105
01:03:21,736 --> 01:03:23,971
You like me right?

1106
01:03:24,773 --> 01:03:27,141
Yes.

1107
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:29,476
Then you're going to just have
to trust me on this one, okay?

1108
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:33,581
I promise I'll explain everything
when we're not about to die

1109
01:03:34,582 --> 01:03:35,784
You're a terrible person

1110
01:03:35,883 --> 01:03:37,318
Shut up you little twerp!

1111
01:03:37,418 --> 01:03:39,320
Okay...

1112
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,322
I trust you

1113
01:03:41,422 --> 01:03:43,891
Just promise me that whatever
we're doing...

1114
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:46,393
isn't like.. breaking the law or anythin

1115
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,929
You're not going to lie
to him again, are you?

1116
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:51,733
I promise.

1117
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:54,234
Alright. Let's do this

1118
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:56,437
And... you guys are going
to helps us right?

1119
01:03:56,538 --> 01:03:57,104
No, no and no!

1120
01:03:57,204 --> 01:03:59,541
Not if she's going to be with us

1121
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:01,543
What the fuck dude?!

1122
01:04:01,643 --> 01:04:04,078
You're a bad person!

1123
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,715
A really, REALLY, bad person!

1124
01:04:06,815 --> 01:04:09,016
No she's not, okay!

1125
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:11,352
She's the most amazing girl I've ever me

1126
01:04:12,821 --> 01:04:15,022
Seriously Nate?

1127
01:04:15,122 --> 01:04:18,125
What is it with all this?

1128
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:20,427
You met me only a few hours ago

1129
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:23,330
Not really, I mean..

1130
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,366
I've seen you around town
every now and then ..

1131
01:04:38,713 --> 01:04:40,948
Oh!!! Oh !!!

1132
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:20,020
: May I have
your attention please..

1133
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,356
... the store will be closing in 5 minut

1134
01:05:23,792 --> 01:05:25,727
Please bring your items
to the checkout now...

1135
01:05:25,827 --> 01:05:28,228
... we thank you for shopping
with us today.

1136
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:38,105
Ah....

1137
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:47,347
I know it's weird but...

1138
01:05:48,883 --> 01:05:51,719
I feel like everything that's
happened in my life

1139
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,287
... especially today

1140
01:05:53,387 --> 01:05:55,590
... has led me to you.

1141
01:05:56,624 --> 01:05:59,393
I mean...

1142
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:01,763
You're me... just like the opposite of m

1143
01:06:01,863 --> 01:06:03,798
Which is something that I always needed!

1144
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:06,501
Someone who's into the
same things as me ...

1145
01:06:06,601 --> 01:06:09,036
But at the same time experiencing
them so much differently

1146
01:06:11,539 --> 01:06:13,974
While I walk around this
scared depressed wimp...

1147
01:06:14,876 --> 01:06:18,045
... you don't give a crap

1148
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:21,516
You push me away from the flaws inside
the person that I really am

1149
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:23,651
Awww... Nate

1150
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:27,822
Let's go find that pillowcase

1151
01:06:27,922 --> 01:06:30,959
See Nate... how do you not see
that she's just using you

1152
01:06:31,058 --> 01:06:32,092
How do you know?

1153
01:06:32,192 --> 01:06:34,896
You just poured your heart out to
her and all she had to say was...

1154
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:36,898
" Let's go find the pillowcase "

1155
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:39,233
Don't listen to that little fucker..

1156
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:41,870
I was just using you...
but I'm not anymore

1157
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:45,172
It's just...I'm kind of in
a life or death situation

1158
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:46,808
with this pillowcase thing

1159
01:06:46,908 --> 01:06:49,343
... so I can't really focus on
the romantic shit, you know?

1160
01:06:50,645 --> 01:06:51,980
Okay...

1161
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,982
.. let's find that pillowcase

1162
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:56,651
See ya! Wouldn't want to be ya!

1163
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:58,653
Hey wait!

1164
01:06:58,753 --> 01:07:00,454
What?

1165
01:07:00,555 --> 01:07:03,123
Where are you guys going? We
can't do this without you

1166
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:04,258
I know, that's why we're leaving

1167
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:06,260
We told you it's in a hole ...

1168
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,262
Now go find the hole!!!

1169
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:10,397
Something you're tiny
little penis can't do

1170
01:07:10,497 --> 01:07:12,132
Why are you being like this?

1171
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:14,434
'Cause there's drugs in
that pillowcase Nate!

1172
01:07:14,536 --> 01:07:16,436
Not necessarily the bad kind. ...

1173
01:07:16,538 --> 01:07:18,773
But it's the principle that
the Boss cares about

1174
01:07:20,975 --> 01:07:21,876
I'm hungry.

1175
01:07:21,976 --> 01:07:24,211
Want tacos?

1176
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:12,794
Drugs??

1177
01:08:12,894 --> 01:08:14,328
Drugs Cameron? Seriously....

1178
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:16,330
Come on dude! Drugs!!!

1179
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,533
It's just some fucking pot, okay...

1180
01:08:18,633 --> 01:08:19,901
Good pot.

1181
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:21,903
Pot ?

1182
01:08:22,003 --> 01:08:24,338
Yea... dope, weed, marijuana

1183
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:26,206
I know what it is! I know what pot is.

1184
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:29,611
But you just got done telling me that we
weren't breaking the law or anything

1185
01:08:29,711 --> 01:08:30,812
It's legal!

1186
01:08:30,912 --> 01:08:33,213
Not a whole frickin' bag!

1187
01:08:33,313 --> 01:08:35,415
You lied to me...

1188
01:08:35,516 --> 01:08:36,249
... again.

1189
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,452
Nate wait! I'm sorry --

1190
01:08:38,553 --> 01:08:39,887
No!

1191
01:08:39,988 --> 01:08:41,421
I thought you were different...

1192
01:08:41,522 --> 01:08:44,391
... but you're just like everyone else

1193
01:08:44,491 --> 01:08:48,161
Nate!!! I'm so fucking sorry dude ...

1194
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:50,430
No, you're not sorry

1195
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:52,432
You're doing this so you can
find you're stupid pot

1196
01:08:52,533 --> 01:08:54,434
No I'm not dude, I swear!

1197
01:08:54,535 --> 01:08:56,704
Believe you? I'm supposed
to believe you???

1198
01:08:56,804 --> 01:08:59,373
Because you've had such a good
track record of being honest?

1199
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:02,076
You're right. I'm sorry ... I've
lied to you a lot today

1200
01:09:02,175 --> 01:09:05,546
It's such a shitty thing for me to
do to such a sweet guys like you

1201
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,783
And I don't know...

1202
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:12,020
... maybe you bring out some weird
guilt in me but I realized...

1203
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,354
I need to change

1204
01:09:18,425 --> 01:09:20,995
And I know this is way too late and...

1205
01:09:21,095 --> 01:09:24,231
you're probably really over it

1206
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:28,603
I don't know what I can do to show you
that I actually do care about you Nate

1207
01:09:31,139 --> 01:09:33,508
You actually care about me?

1208
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:35,643
Yea.

1209
01:09:40,148 --> 01:09:42,050
It's 'cause of goofy shit like that

1210
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:44,952
That goofy-ass smile your just got

1211
01:09:45,053 --> 01:09:49,322
I think it's so fucking awesome how
someone can be so suicidal....

1212
01:09:49,423 --> 01:09:51,324
... yet have such a hopeful
outlook on life

1213
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:53,061
Well, to be honest...

1214
01:09:53,161 --> 01:09:56,631
... you brought out the hope in me

1215
01:09:56,731 --> 01:09:58,633
If you don't want to help
me find the pillowcase...

1216
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:00,968
... it's whatever, but, I just --

1217
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:05,940
I'd like to see you around more often...

1218
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,275
... that is if we are still alive

1219
01:10:10,645 --> 01:10:12,747
Yea... I'll help you Cameron

1220
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:13,981
Really?

1221
01:10:14,082 --> 01:10:17,085
I mean it's not like I have anything
to do on my birthday

1222
01:10:17,185 --> 01:10:20,788
Plus... I know if I don't I'll
never be able to see you again

1223
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:22,924
And...

1224
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:26,226
I don't want to die

1225
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:28,930
Not anymore

1226
01:10:31,498 --> 01:10:32,967
We tried to tell ya, Neal!

1227
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:35,302
It's Nate ---

1228
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:37,337
-- nevermind

1229
01:10:37,437 --> 01:10:40,208
Aren't you going to stop them?

1230
01:10:40,307 --> 01:10:42,543
Nah... I'd rather team up with you anway

1231
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:46,446
Damn dude... that was cheesy as fuck

1232
01:10:47,414 --> 01:10:50,585
Let's go find that weed!

1233
01:10:50,685 --> 01:10:55,189
Now they got a pimp out here on his hand
and knees going through sticks and shit

1234
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:58,993
This reminds me of the time I lost my
weed in that strippers booty hole

1235
01:11:00,762 --> 01:11:02,997

1236
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:06,667
Mothergoose, mothergoose, come in!

1237
01:11:06,768 --> 01:11:08,870
Suspect, "pimping ain't easy" in sight

1238
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,005
Come in...do you copy?

1239
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:15,109
I'm looking for MY weed...

1240
01:11:15,209 --> 01:11:17,111

1241
01:11:18,112 --> 01:11:20,347
Oh hell nah!!!

1242
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:24,886
What the fuck???

1243
01:11:24,986 --> 01:11:27,021

01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:36,329
That crackhead faster than a motherfucke

1245
01:11:38,431 --> 01:11:41,102
What is that ?

1246
01:11:41,202 --> 01:11:43,436
What do we got here?

1247
01:11:45,438 --> 01:11:46,941
Oh hell nah!!!!

01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:48,943
Snitching-ass bitch!

I knew it!!!

1250
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:53,548
Oh yea... I'm going to
kill this motherfucka!

1251
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,285
: Home base to "dirty dick" .

possible 10-32 , please stand by..

01:12:09,564 --> 01:12:11,799
Move out the way! Pimp coming!!!

1255
01:12:14,235 --> 01:12:16,838
Fanny pack. Walkie-talkie ...

1256
01:12:16,938 --> 01:12:18,639
Pimp. Pimp!!!

1257
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:21,008
Someone here is a cop

1258
01:12:21,108 --> 01:12:22,777
I got it! You're the cop!

1259
01:12:22,877 --> 01:12:24,779
You're the one the kid
was telling us about!

1260
01:12:24,879 --> 01:12:27,248
Remember the kid and the old man told
us there was a cop in the park

1261
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:30,184
Well, well, well ...

1262
01:12:30,284 --> 01:12:32,520
Cop or not I'll still dust your ass!

1263
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:36,057
I ain't no cop. I aint!

1264
01:12:36,157 --> 01:12:37,490
I ain't no bitch-ass cop!

1265
01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:40,360
Come here! You sneaky ass bitch!

1266
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,697
Ahhh!! Let go of me!!

1267
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:46,801
What this about you being
a motherfuckin police?

1268
01:12:47,434 --> 01:12:49,670
Owww!!!

1269
01:12:51,706 --> 01:12:53,608
So how the hell would a crackhead
have an iphone?

1270
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:57,044
I knew your dirty ass was the police!

1271
01:12:57,144 --> 01:12:59,247
It's 2019 Einstein, Everyone's
got an iphone!

1272
01:12:59,347 --> 01:13:00,815
I'm recording you ass too --

1273
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:03,851
Put that phone away nigga! You think
this is a motherfuckin' game?

1274
01:13:03,951 --> 01:13:06,053
Everybody going to see this
shit! Black-on-Black crime!

1275
01:13:06,153 --> 01:13:07,855
Black-on-Black crime!

1276
01:13:07,955 --> 01:13:09,257
Oh, I see you a high motherfucker -

1277
01:13:09,357 --> 01:13:11,458
you think I wont shoot
your motehrufuckin' ass

1278
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:13,294
Ah! I ain't no cop, put that away!

1279
01:13:13,393 --> 01:13:16,297
I'll kill you even if you is the police,
nigga. Put that phone down!

1280
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:18,633
-- Dust his ass! -- No!!

1281
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:22,136
Put that gun away, man. You're trippin'!

1282
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:25,472
Everybody calm down! I'll forget
everything is you just ---

1283
01:13:25,573 --> 01:13:28,042
Check on, two. Check- check...

1284
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:31,812
Speak clearly and let me know what
y'all are doing in the park

1285
01:13:31,913 --> 01:13:34,282
The thing that I hate more than
tenants who don't pay their rent

1286
01:13:34,382 --> 01:13:36,250
is the motherfuckin' police!!

1287
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:42,924
I got you now!!!

1288
01:13:43,024 --> 01:13:45,793
Hi-yahh nigga!

1289
01:13:45,893 --> 01:13:49,263
Oh hell , I'm out of bullets. I'll be ba

1290
01:13:49,363 --> 01:13:51,732
Cameron come on!

1291
01:13:51,832 --> 01:13:54,434
Oh my god, he almost shot his ass

1292
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:56,436
Yea, because you told him to

1293
01:13:56,537 --> 01:13:59,240
Well I didn't think he actually would

1294
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,408
Then why would you say "dust his ass " ?

1295
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:02,343
I wanted to sound cool!

1296
01:14:02,442 --> 01:14:04,111
So now it's cool to kill someone?

1297
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:06,881
Yeah..... no.

1298
01:14:06,981 --> 01:14:09,583
I didn't think he actually would.

1299
01:14:09,684 --> 01:14:11,585
Maybe Byron was right... I should go

1300
01:14:11,686 --> 01:14:13,888
What? No... seriously?

1301
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:15,890
What about you changing and everything?

1302
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,225
Or was that another one of your lies, to

1303
01:14:24,065 --> 01:14:26,100
I'm sorry.

1304
01:14:52,293 --> 01:14:54,061
I told you she sucks!

1305
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,062
Really for free?

1306
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:57,932
Maybe she can do something
with my limp cobra ?

1307
01:14:58,032 --> 01:15:01,736
Just leave me alone already. I've
had enough of this. I'm done!

1308
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:03,971
You're not sick of us... you're
sick of yourself son

1309
01:15:04,071 --> 01:15:06,440
What is that supposed to mean?
How do you even know --

1310
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:07,541
We've been following you for years Nate

1311
01:15:07,641 --> 01:15:09,110
... well, off and on

1312
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,644
Huh?

1313
01:15:10,745 --> 01:15:11,812
What are you talking about?

1314
01:15:11,912 --> 01:15:14,248
We're not real, Nate

1315
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:16,050
Okay... okay...

1316
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,552
I officially don't have no idea
what's going on anymore!

1317
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:21,155
We're your guardian angels, Nick

1318
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:22,556
Hasn't that been obvious?

1319
01:15:22,656 --> 01:15:24,859
Yea... oh yea.... real obvious

1320
01:15:24,959 --> 01:15:27,194
Pretty much seems like the
opposite of that to me

1321
01:15:32,266 --> 01:15:37,071
Yeah. you're right. Now it all makes sen
why I've had such a crappy life

1322
01:15:37,171 --> 01:15:39,740
I've had two of the worst guardian
angels in the world

1323
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,574
You guys are ---

1324
01:15:40,674 --> 01:15:42,376
Anyway!

1325
01:15:42,476 --> 01:15:47,982
After watching you for the past 24 hours
it's pretty clear that you're depressed

1326
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:50,618
And we needed to do something

1327
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:54,288
Gee thanks, like I haven't heard about
my depression like 20 times today

1328
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:58,826
That's 'cause we haven't been there for
you and ignored our responsibilities

1329
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:02,696
Deep down. We just want
the best for you Nate

1330
01:16:04,598 --> 01:16:07,268
Wait ..

1331
01:16:07,368 --> 01:16:09,603
You said the last 24 hours ...

1332
01:16:10,638 --> 01:16:12,873
How were you there for me last night?

1333
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:15,376
We did all of this to help you

1334
01:16:15,476 --> 01:16:18,245
Help? Help?

1335
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:21,816
How is being trapped in this
crazy situation helping me?

1336
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,384
To give you a chance, son

1337
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:25,386
A chance for what?

1338
01:16:25,486 --> 01:16:27,721
Change.

1339
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:34,529
Son, you see life as a serious of ...

1340
01:16:34,628 --> 01:16:37,498
... unchanging, unfortunate events

1341
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:40,401
Well, at least I can remember
what I did ten seconds ago

1342
01:16:40,502 --> 01:16:42,937
Huh??

1343
01:16:43,037 --> 01:16:45,272
It's not about him, Nate. It's about you

1344
01:16:45,372 --> 01:16:48,742
You walk around all sad and unhappy when
you have so much to be grateful for

1345
01:16:48,843 --> 01:16:50,545
You're healthy, you're alive --

1346
01:16:50,644 --> 01:16:53,013
I'm a walking embarrassment.
Can't do anything right...

1347
01:16:53,114 --> 01:16:55,316
... oh, and have the worst guardian ange

1348
01:16:56,817 --> 01:16:59,920
Yea ... my life is just great

1349
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,189
See, its stuff like that.
Focusing on the negative

1350
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:05,693
Okay, then how do I make myself happy
when I've lived such a crappy life?

1351
01:17:05,793 --> 01:17:07,695
Take the chance we are giving you!

1352
01:17:07,795 --> 01:17:10,431
Right ... and what is that?

1353
01:17:10,532 --> 01:17:12,700
Grow a pair of testicles

1354
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,604
Live life! Make a damn change!

1355
01:17:15,703 --> 01:17:18,439
There's s pillowcase full of marijuana .

1356
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:21,576
... a girl you're in love with and ...

1357
01:17:21,675 --> 01:17:23,978
... your life is on the line!

1358
01:17:24,078 --> 01:17:26,313
So grow a pair and do something!

1359
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:30,885
AFter everything you've
been through today ...

1360
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:33,420
... you can get through whatever
life has to throw at you.

1361
01:17:33,522 --> 01:17:35,256
So embrace that ...

1362
01:17:35,356 --> 01:17:36,724
... dumbass!

1363
01:17:36,824 --> 01:17:39,393
You never know what will
happen when you do

1364
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:40,761
Yea ...

1365
01:17:40,861 --> 01:17:42,763
Yea .. you know what--

1366
01:17:42,863 --> 01:17:44,198
You are right

1367
01:17:44,298 --> 01:17:46,700
that's like the only thing I haven't don

1368
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:50,838
Wait, I'm confused though ...

1369
01:17:50,938 --> 01:17:54,975
... I know that I have to change, I just
don't know how to do all that sutff

1370
01:17:55,075 --> 01:17:57,778
When the time comes you'll know... I thi

1371
01:17:57,878 --> 01:18:00,114
Good luck Nate. I believe in you

1372
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:03,751
Thanks

1373
01:18:07,188 --> 01:18:10,491
So what do we do know besides
you not killing me

1374
01:18:10,592 --> 01:18:13,928
I'm going to find my bullets
and you better ind my shit

1375
01:18:14,028 --> 01:18:16,297
or I'm going to kill your
ass when I get back

1376
01:18:16,397 --> 01:18:17,131
But --

1377
01:18:17,231 --> 01:18:19,266
Catch you later baby, I"m out.

1378
01:18:22,604 --> 01:18:24,305
Shit ...

1379
01:18:24,405 --> 01:18:26,508
If I had the dick the size
of half a grape...

1380
01:18:26,608 --> 01:18:28,275
... where would I put that pillowcase?

1381
01:19:25,499 --> 01:19:29,770
Halt! Oh and I forgot to tell you. We're
not actually you're guardian angels

1382
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,474
Do you believe in unicorns too?

1383
01:19:33,575 --> 01:19:35,175
I've just being doing some
community service

1384
01:19:35,276 --> 01:19:36,910
by taking this old dude to the park

1385
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:41,583
... or maybe we are.

1386
01:19:41,683 --> 01:19:43,917
The boss said not to tell him

1387
01:19:45,286 --> 01:19:46,954
Well... whatever you guys are

1388
01:19:47,054 --> 01:19:48,956
I just want to say thank you

1389
01:19:49,056 --> 01:19:51,292
I couldn't have done it without you

1390
01:20:07,676 --> 01:20:09,910
Oh ....

1391
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,279
Hi ...

1392
01:20:12,379 --> 01:20:14,915
Uh, sup dude ...

1393
01:20:15,015 --> 01:20:17,418
Any luck finding it yet?

1394
01:20:17,519 --> 01:20:19,554
Nope. You?

1395
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:24,224
Who knew finding a pillowcase filled
with weed would be so hard?

1396
01:20:27,562 --> 01:20:30,097
Yea... you know, almost
as hard as my penis

1397
01:20:31,932 --> 01:20:34,803
Sorry, I was trying to be funny

1398
01:20:34,902 --> 01:20:37,137
... that was a really bad joke

1399
01:20:41,743 --> 01:20:43,310
Sorry for bailing on you, dude

1400
01:20:45,212 --> 01:20:47,314
It's alright. I'm sorry too

1401
01:20:47,414 --> 01:20:49,450
Wait, what ?

1402
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:52,520
Well... I've been doing some thinking

1403
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,055
-- you know, the past
couple of minutes and

1404
01:20:56,658 --> 01:21:00,327
... and I've realized how ignorant
I've been to things my entire life

1405
01:21:00,427 --> 01:21:02,831
I've been stuck in my head,
where it sucks.

1406
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:04,998
And I can't do anything to change it

1407
01:21:05,099 --> 01:21:06,166
What are you talking about?

1408
01:21:06,266 --> 01:21:07,901
Everything! Everything!!!

1409
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:12,473
Everything since last night has shown
me just how wrong I've been living

1410
01:21:12,574 --> 01:21:18,680
For example; I've been so infatuated wit
getting the hopes of your love that ...

1411
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:21,850
... I had no idea that you were
using me to get to your drugs

1412
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:25,252
Just like I'm always thinking
about the things I don't have

1413
01:21:25,352 --> 01:21:27,988
Oh! And then there's that pillowcase thi

1414
01:21:28,088 --> 01:21:31,191
Which I now realized it was the only spa
i need tin order to change my life

1415
01:21:32,326 --> 01:21:33,628
I could have easily done what I always d

1416
01:21:33,728 --> 01:21:35,597
... and said "screw it!"
"Forget about it" !

1417
01:21:35,697 --> 01:21:38,966
but then, I would've have
regretted it for hours

1418
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:42,035
But now, I see that life
is way more exciting

1419
01:21:42,136 --> 01:21:45,305
when you embrace the beauty
of it's surprises

1420
01:21:45,406 --> 01:21:48,643
It's definitely a life worth living

1421
01:21:48,743 --> 01:21:50,845
Dude, that dope and all but why are
you telling me all of this ?

1422
01:21:50,944 --> 01:21:52,847
Because "you".

1423
01:21:52,946 --> 01:21:53,648
You ...

1424
01:21:53,748 --> 01:21:56,083
You helped me change

1425
01:21:56,183 --> 01:21:58,285
And you can help me continue to change

1426
01:21:58,385 --> 01:22:00,921
Why me? What do I have to do
with changing your life?

1427
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:02,956
I don't know ...

1428
01:22:03,056 --> 01:22:05,125
Maybe it's your whole " I don't
give a crap" attitude or ...

1429
01:22:05,225 --> 01:22:07,361
... the fact that you're mean to everyon

1430
01:22:07,461 --> 01:22:08,696
... or how you're always
screwing up or ---

1431
01:22:08,797 --> 01:22:10,964
Get to the point!

1432
01:22:11,064 --> 01:22:13,568
I guess, what I'm trying
to say is just ...

1433
01:22:13,668 --> 01:22:15,035
... being with you

1434
01:22:15,135 --> 01:22:17,739
brings out the best possible version of

1435
01:22:17,839 --> 01:22:22,744
I can step out side of this stupid, wimp
scared persona that's I've given myself

1436
01:22:22,844 --> 01:22:26,213
I mean, I smoked marijuana with you...
I would never normally do that

1437
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,249
-- like what? Me? No!

1438
01:22:29,349 --> 01:22:32,887
I saw a guy get almost frickin' shot!

1439
01:22:32,986 --> 01:22:36,624
And none of it would have happened,
if it weren't for you

1440
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:42,664
Uh... Cameron... if I --

1441
01:22:42,764 --> 01:22:44,532
--- find your marijuana...

1442
01:22:44,632 --> 01:22:45,600
... will you --

1443
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,401
Jesus, no! What the -- ?

1444
01:22:47,502 --> 01:22:49,102
I was going to say "help
me continue to change "

1445
01:22:49,203 --> 01:22:52,105
Then why did you get on one knee ?

1446
01:22:52,206 --> 01:22:55,008
I uh -- had a cramp

1447
01:22:55,108 --> 01:22:57,344
You got a deal weirdo.

1448
01:22:59,948 --> 01:23:01,850
Oww... . thanks

1449
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:04,184
Whoa! Whoa! What the fuck dude?

1450
01:23:08,422 --> 01:23:10,892
I was uh... trying out my new lifestyle

1451
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:13,327
Too much too soon?

1452
01:23:13,427 --> 01:23:16,196
You can't just lick someone's
face like that!

1453
01:23:18,298 --> 01:23:20,535
No friggin' way!

1454
01:23:22,871 --> 01:23:25,807
Is that what I think it is?

1455
01:23:25,907 --> 01:23:28,141
Holy fuck, that's it!!!

1456
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:47,294
Holy shit dude, it's still here!!

1457
01:23:47,394 --> 01:23:49,597
I can't believe it , thank you so much!!

1458
01:23:52,366 --> 01:23:54,268
Nate... thank you so much for everything

1459
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:56,604
Thank you, I can't say it enough

1460
01:23:56,704 --> 01:23:59,774
I'm a little pissed that you took it
in the first place but thank you --

1461
01:23:59,874 --> 01:24:03,243
Thank you for everything. I don't
know what I can do to repay you

1462
01:24:03,343 --> 01:24:04,244
Thank you Nate.

1463
01:24:04,344 --> 01:24:06,581
Anything for you.

1464
01:24:16,824 --> 01:24:18,726
Haha... I'm just happy you got
what you wanted Cameron.

1465
01:24:18,826 --> 01:24:21,663
You know I searched the
whole park for you.

1466
01:24:21,763 --> 01:24:23,263
Freeze! LAPD!

1467
01:24:23,363 --> 01:24:27,334
Ya'll under the arrest for the possessio
of marijuana and intent to distribute

1468
01:24:27,434 --> 01:24:28,770
Got you sweetheart! You're going
to jail for a long time!

1469
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:31,305
Turn around! You're going to
spend the night in county

1470
01:24:33,641 --> 01:24:36,276
God... you smell like shit for a Narc

1471
01:24:36,376 --> 01:24:37,645
I was committing to my character

1472
01:24:37,745 --> 01:24:40,314
You can't arrest her for that!
That pot isn't hers

1473
01:24:40,414 --> 01:24:42,316
She did say it was "her shit"

1474
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:44,652
.. and it is in her hands, isn't it?

1475
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,422
Home base, officer dirty dick --

1476
01:24:48,523 --> 01:24:50,858
Haha!!

1477
01:24:50,959 --> 01:24:52,860
I didn't pick my own undercover name

1478
01:24:52,961 --> 01:24:53,995
That's even worse!

1479
01:24:54,127 --> 01:24:55,997
I didn't make this name up

1480
01:24:56,096 --> 01:24:57,999
Hahahahah!!!

1481
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:00,334
Seriously... that means your dirty dick

1482
01:25:01,803 --> 01:25:04,237
You are not the one to talk
in this department pal

1483
01:25:06,975 --> 01:25:08,876
And you. I finally got you.

1484
01:25:08,977 --> 01:25:10,678
I knew it was you the whole time

1485
01:25:10,778 --> 01:25:12,947
Good job dude, it only
took you the whole day

1486
01:25:13,047 --> 01:25:17,051
And you... I would've be arresting you
if I knew your role in this operation.

1487
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:19,787
Clearly you're not a drug dealer

1488
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:22,890
You're coming to get booked
sister. Come on Blondie!

1489
01:25:24,224 --> 01:25:26,126
What the fuck???!!

1490
01:25:26,226 --> 01:25:27,929
Oh hell no!

1491
01:25:28,029 --> 01:25:28,495
Freeze! Don't move!

1492
01:25:28,596 --> 01:25:30,965
I'm packing now, bitch!

1493
01:25:31,065 --> 01:25:32,100
I found your weed!

1494
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:35,036
I think it's a little late for
that now, don't you think?

1495
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:35,637
Wait!

1496
01:25:35,737 --> 01:25:37,204
What the hell??

1497
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:39,874
If you're going to shoot them , you're
going to have to shoot me first

1498
01:25:39,974 --> 01:25:43,778
I used to want this moment to happen...b
now that it's here...

1499
01:25:44,946 --> 01:25:47,615
I'm kind of scared...

1500
01:25:47,715 --> 01:25:50,150
I don't know what I'm doing
but .. .it feels right

1501
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:54,756
Plus, I know that I don't
want to be alive...

1502
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:58,325
... if she weren't

1503
01:25:59,459 --> 01:26:01,696
Cute speech bitch

1504
01:26:04,264 --> 01:26:06,166
This is for Ned!!!

1505
01:26:06,266 --> 01:26:08,670
Ahhhh!!!

1506
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:10,337
GFreeze dirtbag!

1507
01:26:10,437 --> 01:26:12,339
What the fuck is going on?

1508
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:13,373
-Got you Byron! - Hi-yah!!
-What now bitch?

1509
01:26:13,473 --> 01:26:16,309
Don't you dare move!

1510
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:19,013
Wow. You guy really are my guardian ange

1511
01:26:19,113 --> 01:26:21,348
I don't know

1512
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:26,754
Come on!

1513
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:28,890
Good job, partner

1514
01:26:30,058 --> 01:26:32,560
Detective, you smell like shit

1515
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:35,395
Just playing my part, sir

1516
01:26:35,495 --> 01:26:37,165
You actually smell like
dog shit, like if --

1517
01:26:37,264 --> 01:26:40,068
-- if the dog ate Taco Bell the night
before, that's what you smell like

1518
01:26:40,168 --> 01:26:42,235
Roger that, roger that sir.

1519
01:26:42,335 --> 01:26:43,738
You smell like a fucking porter potty

1520
01:26:43,838 --> 01:26:45,540
Silence!!!

1521
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,875
Yea... he's not wrong. Stay out
of the station for a while

1522
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:52,345
Com on, Flavor-flav, let's go!

1523
01:26:52,446 --> 01:26:55,482
You know, I'd give you a pretty damn goo
hug right now if I wasn't handcuffed

1524
01:26:55,583 --> 01:26:58,519
Well ... it's a good thing I'm not

1525
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:01,155
Yea, I hate to break up
this weird little moment

1526
01:27:01,254 --> 01:27:04,025
but it's time for your ride downtown

1527
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:05,492
For some obvious questioning

1528
01:27:05,593 --> 01:27:07,829
Whoa! You can't do that
to her. Not this time!

1529
01:27:08,796 --> 01:27:11,231
Yea, I can. Listen glasses --

1530
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:15,268
This isn't some romantic comedy where
you think you're Ben Stiller

1531
01:27:15,368 --> 01:27:18,806
This is real life. And she broke the law

1532
01:27:18,906 --> 01:27:22,009
Well I hope to see you when
all of this is done

1533
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:23,276
You will

1534
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:25,278
And in case we don't --

1535
01:27:25,378 --> 01:27:27,849
Okay, we're done here

1536
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:30,017
Oh come on man! Wait --

1537
01:27:30,118 --> 01:27:32,820
Seriously? We were this
close...we -- just --

1538
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:35,890
: Haha! We are
totally going to smash that

1539
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:37,592
What?! No

1540
01:27:40,494 --> 01:27:43,263
Yea ... okay, maybe

1541
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:47,400
Wait! Cameron!!!

1542
01:27:51,038 --> 01:27:53,473
You bald looking Night Court
motherfucker, get off me!!!

1543
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:57,512
Yep. I know... life tough. It's tough

1544
01:27:57,612 --> 01:27:59,781
There you go, there you go

1545
01:27:59,881 --> 01:28:02,349
Who's smell like garbage now?
Talking about me all day, uh huh?

1546
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:04,484
Get in the car 'cause
you're going downtown

1547
01:28:04,585 --> 01:28:06,921
Pay back's a bitch, ain't it, uh huh

1548
01:28:07,021 --> 01:28:09,056
Cameron, wait!

1549
01:28:17,031 --> 01:28:19,066
Cameron, listen ...

1550
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:21,669
Next time ...

1551
01:28:21,769 --> 01:28:24,437
Next time you see me I
won't be such a pansy

1552
01:28:24,539 --> 01:28:26,240
Dude, you took a bullet for me.

1553
01:28:26,339 --> 01:28:29,877
You're officially stripped of your
label of "world's biggest pussy"

1554
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:32,412
I know. You're right. Except
there's one more thing ..

1555
01:28:35,482 --> 01:28:37,118
Would you wanna go out with me?

1556
01:28:37,218 --> 01:28:39,452
This mother -- psshh..

1557
01:28:40,855 --> 01:28:43,090
You know, whenever you're out of the joi

1558
01:28:44,592 --> 01:28:46,694
Dude... I'm never out of joints

1559
01:28:46,794 --> 01:28:48,262
but sure

1560
01:28:48,361 --> 01:28:50,598
My nigga Nate

1561
01:28:53,601 --> 01:28:55,803
Alright we're done here...

1562
01:28:55,903 --> 01:28:58,338
Enough of this hallmark shit little Rome

1563
01:29:07,782 --> 01:29:10,017
: Suspect in custody

1564
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:28,636
Good job, Nate. You did it
... you passed the test

1565
01:29:30,771 --> 01:29:32,640
You're my guardian angel too?

1566
01:29:36,476 --> 01:29:38,713
Me neither!

1567
01:29:40,514 --> 01:29:42,683
Well, whatever you guys are...

1568
01:29:42,783 --> 01:29:44,685
I wanna say thank you

1569
01:29:44,785 --> 01:29:46,721
You literally saved my life

1570
01:29:46,821 --> 01:29:48,856
You're welcome and now...

1571
01:29:48,956 --> 01:29:51,391
... you're saving you're own life

1572
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:56,898
Later Nate.

1573
01:30:06,607 --> 01:30:07,575
I caught it .

1574
01:30:07,675 --> 01:30:10,477
Nice try bitches

1575
01:30:10,578 --> 01:30:12,780
Oh yeaa ooo yea... -- yea, yea, yea

1576
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:19,887
Doesn't change the fact that
you still have a baby dick
