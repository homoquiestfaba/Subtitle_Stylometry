Hmm?

19
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:42,336
You remember the guys from the University of Washington.

20
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,164
Skylar.

21
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,513
Hey, guys.

22
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,123
Huh.

23
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:48,820
We've got some literature about the campus

and the program.

25
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,736
You should come for a visit.

26

Just give us a call,

Oh, yeah.

00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,707
Thanks.

I'm not very good at this.

What did I do?

62
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,874
So this is a big game.

63
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:27,615
You nervous?

64
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:28,877
Um, I'm OK.

00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:29,965
Sure he is.

dress in here, anyway?

It'll be all right.

Breathe.

93
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:36,553
Hang in there.

Thank you.

You're very welcome.

100
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,003
Do you think your parents like the table, Chloe?

101
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:53,744
OK.

102
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,224
It's weird enough being on a double date with my parents

103
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
without you stressing
about where we sit.

104
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:00,011
Right.

105
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,404
Ah.

Mrs. Pierce, you look
very nice tonight.

Oh, well, thank you.

108
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:07,845
You know what they say.

109
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,673
If you want to know what a woman will look like in 20 years,

110
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,980
just take a look at her mother.

111
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,723
And from where I'm sitting,things are looking very good.

112
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:16,680
[laughing]

113
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,465
Now, tonight's on me.

114
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:19,683
Oh, Paul, you don't
have to do that.

115
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:20,597
No, no.

116
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:21,468
That's not necessary.

117
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:23,905
It's your anniversary.

118
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:24,993
Try that.

119
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:26,255
Oh.

120
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,125
You'll like it.

121
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:35,438
Mr. and Mrs. Pierce, you two are very important to me.

122
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,007
A marriage like yours makes people believe in marriage.

123
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:42,314
When you have two people
who are committed,

124
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:45,143
keep working
together, never stop...

125
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,144
Why are you being so weird?

126
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,630
Mr. Pierce, I think you know how much I love your daughter.

127
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,502
I truly do.

128
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:57,417
And that's why I wanted the two of you here today.

129
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,070
Uh-oh.

130
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:02,073
What's happening?

131
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:03,553
Chloe?

132
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,250
CHLOE: Yes?

133
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:08,253
I know I've only lived
a fraction of my life,

134
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:12,954
and I am so lucky to
have already found you.

135
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,651
The only mistake I
can make in my life

136
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:17,349
would be to not ask you to spend the rest of it with me.

137
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,180
Oh!

138
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,753
PAUL: Will you spend the rest of your life with me?

139
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,059
Yes.

140
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:32,539
Of course I will.

141
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,497
Oh.

142
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,804
Put it on.

143
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,632
DEBORAH: Oh.

144
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:39,633
It fits.

145
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:40,634
[giggling]

146
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,287
Daddy, I'm getting married.

147
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:45,334
That is so wonderful.

148
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,294
Mr. Pierce, if I could just be half the husband you are.

149
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:51,427
I was.

150
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,777
I was, but you be.

151
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:54,735
You be.

152
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,040
I'm not.

153
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:57,433
DEBORAH: Huh?

154
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,653
Walter, what's going on?

155
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:00,958
WALTER: Um...

156
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:01,872
CHLOE: Daddy?

157
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:05,659
Um, I...

158
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:10,533
I did something that
I didn't mean to do,

159
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:11,839
that I didn't understand.

160
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:13,536
What?

161
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:21,326
She was sweet, and
she was nice to me,

162
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:28,508
and I slept with Nisha.

163
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,777
CHLOE: You...

164
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:39,649
[WHISPERING] I'm sorry.

165
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,085
WAITRESS: And how are
you folks this evening?

166
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,788
MRS. ECKERMAN:
It's bad, isn't it?

167
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,137
Don't worry, sweetheart.

168
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:50,878
These folks are like
magicians nowadays.

169
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,184
I wish I had
better news for you,

170
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:55,012
but it's the worst
tear I've seen.

171
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:57,275
This is major.

172
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,451
How long until he's back?

173
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:03,107
When the swelling goes down,we can talk about surgery.

174
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:07,808
But realistically, he
won't be coming back.

175
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:10,201

00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:11,899

BOY: Hey, Mrs. E.

178
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,643
Will you excuse
us for a second?

179
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,122
I've got to talk to my son.

180
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:21,517
Later, guys.

181
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:30,047
Hey.

182
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,441
Where's Dad?

183
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,792
He's having a little
trouble right now.

184
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:37,794
Why?

185
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:43,191
Well, we never know what life has in store for us.

186
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,933
And Sky, you have got
so much ahead of you.

187
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,854

Go!
Go!

Go!
Go!

376
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,699
Yeah!

[cheering]

378
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,442
Hey, aren't those
guys underage?

379
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:10,399
Yeah, what can I say?

380
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,532
Manager's a football fan.

381
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:13,750
Football brats.

382
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:14,664
Great.

383
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:16,144
[laughing]

384
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,145
Hey, look who's here.

385
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,190
It's the mascot.

386
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,104
Hey, mascot!

387
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:23,978
[music playing]

388
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:28,809
Hi, guys.

389
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,071
How are you doing?

390
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:31,942
We were just talking
about the game.

391
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:34,554
You know we lost, right?

392
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:35,511
Yes.

393
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:38,340
Yes, I do.

394
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,647
So do you think
that it was my fault?

395
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,344
Or maybe it was your
fault that we lost.

396
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,002
Because, I mean, the mascot’s a really important part

397
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:50,134
of the game, right?

398
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,180
But you did your part, correct?

399
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,616
- Well, I...
- Sit down.

400
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,096
We want to have
a drink with you.

401
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:57,054
[SINGING] ...stop treading water.

402
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:58,099
If the sun is setting...

403
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,535
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

404
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:05,498
No, guys, he can't
drink with us.

405
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:06,368
He's just a mascot.

406
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:12,418
[laughing]

407
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:15,159
DINKY: Hey, you're dismissed.

408
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,031
Woo!

409
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,555
OK, gentlemen,
whenever you're ready.

410
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,557
More beer.

411
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:23,167
I don't think so.
DINKY: He's the Eck.

412
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:24,386
He's the Eck.

413
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:25,822
DINKY: I think we'll
have some beer.

414
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,258
You know what?I'm going to go get the manager.

415
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,172
What, you didn't hear him?

416
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:29,304
I'm the quarterback.

417
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,437
Right, OK.

418
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:32,829
Wait!

419
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,744
You don't think I can
still play football?

420
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,050
Oh, boy.

421
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,791
Watch this.

422
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:38,748
[grunting]

423
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:39,619

[zapping loudly]

426
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:45,799
Can somebody call Joe, please?

427
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:46,974
Jesus.

428
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:47,975
Go, Bulldogs!

429
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:16,830
Unbelievable.

430
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:32,759
MAN: Hey, Christine.

431
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:34,195
Call for you.

432
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:35,196
They said it was urgent.

433
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,026
Hello?

434
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:46,076
Dad did what?

435
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:47,077
[sighing]

436
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,436
WALTER: I always knew
you'd end up in jail.

437
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,438
Just didn't know I'd
be in here with you.

438
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:05,313
[sighing]

439
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,227
Hi, Dad.

440
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:10,318
Christine, hi!

441
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,190
Come here.

442
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,410
What are you doing in town?

443
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,846
Why do you think I'm in town?

444
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:17,804
Oh.

445
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:18,761
CHRISTINE: Mm-hmm.

446
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:19,719
Right.

447
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:20,589
Hey, Chrissy.

448
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:24,027
Well, well, well.

449
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:26,421
What have we here?

450
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,597
I didn't know they arrested big football stars.

451
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:33,254
I'm not anymore.

452
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:35,038
I heard.

453
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:36,649
So I thought that
you were out following

454
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,433
the Dave Matthews Band.

455
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:39,826
I was.

456
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:42,176
But I kind of stumbled
into tree planting.

457
00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:43,873
TONY: I'm sorry, Christine.

458
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:46,833
I can't release Walt. He has no known place of residence,

459
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:48,878
and we're showing that he has no money in any of his accounts.

460
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:49,749
Yes.

461
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:50,706
I know.

462
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:51,707
They emptied them.

463
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:52,621
Who did?

464
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,493
Mom and Chloe.

465
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:55,929
Oh.

466
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,147
What about me?

467
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:58,845
TONY: You've got to stay, too.

468
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:00,542
You're only 17, and I can’t get a hold of your parents.

469
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:01,500
No, no, no.

470
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,066
They're in the mountains.

471
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:04,372
Their cell just
doesn't work up there.

472
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,026
I don't know, you guys.

473
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:07,244
It looks like you're
sort of screwed.

474
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:15,165
Dad, maybe you should
just bunk with Sky.

475
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:16,993
- What?
- No, Christine.

476
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:17,994
Are you kidding me?

477
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,256
Well, think about it.

478
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:20,997
That way, you'll
have a place to stay,

479
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:23,609
and you'll have a guardian.

480
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:24,523
What?

481
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:26,481
No.

482
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:29,049
Will that work?

483
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,355
God, Walt. After
all these years.

484
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:32,226
Come on.

485
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:36,360
Tony, look at them.

486
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:37,274
OK.

487
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:38,145
No.

488
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:39,233
No.

489
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:40,495
I am not going to stay with him.

490
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:41,844
I don't want to
stay with you, either.

491
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:43,542
- Are you kidding me?
- Then stay in jail.

492
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,856
DEBORAH: Chloe,
quick, come here.

493
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,510
What is she doing?

494
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,860
Is she bringing
your dad back here?

495
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,601
And why is she doing
anything for Sky?

496
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:14,834
I'm gonna get my family back.

497
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:19,099
Yeah.

498
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:20,317
It really looks like it.

499
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,455
Why did you do that?

500
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,543
Do what?

501
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:31,285
Bring your dad here?

502
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,113
I didn't bring him here.

503
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:34,244
I brought him next door.

504
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,034
Well, I couldn't
just leave him there.

505
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:42,078
Well, I would have.

506
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:44,515
I would have.

507
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,344
How do I look?

508
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:49,608
Like an old man in a
little boy's pajamas.

509
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:51,174
Burrito?
WALTER: Yeah.

510
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:52,132
Thanks.

511
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:53,133
SKYLAR: Get used to it.

512
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,221
There's not much else.

513
00:26:56,876 --> 00:27:00,880
Man, this stuff is good.

514
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:05,798
To be your age and to eat this stuff all the time.

515
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:07,364
So when was the last
time you talked to her?

516
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:11,238
Christine, I haven’t seen her for almost a year.

517
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,283
I think you know
the reason for that.

518
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:14,415
No.

519
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:15,459
Why?

520
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,809
Because of our misunderstanding?

521
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:18,854
Is that what you call it...

522
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,900
a misunderstanding?

523
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,857
No.

524
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:25,252
Because you crushed her.

525
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:28,298
Why did you do that?

526
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:31,606
Why'd you crush your wife?

527
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:34,522
Yeah.

528
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,873
Maybe when you're my
age, you'll understand.

529
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:42,878
On second thought, I hope you never understand.

530
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:44,880
Where should I sleep?

531
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:47,578
There's an air mattress
down in the rec room.

532
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,233
You've got to blow it up.

- Oh!

00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:18,958
OK.

537
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,308
Go downstairs and
get my entrance.

You look beautiful.
Look at you.

00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,229
Gorgeous.
- You are stunning.

544
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,186
I like your hair.

545
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:31,144
Oh, you are so pretty.

546
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:32,623
I'm going to get Skylar.

547

Hey.

Hi.

551
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:40,849

00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,460
Hi.

554
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:45,288
SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: I'm here to take Christine to the dance.

555
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,116
Hi.

556
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:50,293
Skylar, who's that?

557
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:51,512
SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]:
Oh, that's Loretta.

558
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,296
No, I know that.

559
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:55,559
What... why is she with you?

560
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,647
SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]:
Oh, because I'm

561
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:59,128
going to the dance with her.

562
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:01,478
Come again?

563
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:03,742
Um...

564
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,178
SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: I'm...

565
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:06,440
I'm going... I'm going to
the dance with Loretta.

566
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:15,275
Um, what's going on?

567
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:18,452
You told me that we
were going to the dance.

568
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:20,062
Uh, no.

569
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:21,890
I said... I said that I would take you to the dance.

570
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:24,588
But I'm going with Loretta.

571
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:25,764
CHRISTINE [ON VIDEO]: Sky.
SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: I...

572
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,374
I know why you
folks are confused.

573
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:30,551
It's... there's a big difference between "take" and "go."

574
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,031
Do you folks have a dictionary?

575
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,859
I mean, we can clear
this whole mess up.

576
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,512
CHLOE [ON VIDEO]: Chris,
don't... don't cry.

577
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:36,383
SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: I mean...CHLOE [ON VIDEO]: Asshole.

578
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:37,253
[CRYING] Stop filming.

579
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:38,037
CHLOE [ON VIDEO]: Fine.

580
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:39,038
OK.

581
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:39,995
Sorry.

582
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:40,822
CHRISTINE [ON VIDEO]: OK.

583
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:42,084
Choose... her or me.

584
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,564
I choose not to choose.

585
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:45,000
WALTER [ON VIDEO]: What’s the matter with you?

586
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,262
SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: What’s the matter with you?

587
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:47,524
Get out of here,
you little prick.

588
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:48,787
SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]:
Hey, just be calm.

589
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:49,439
Calm down.- Get out... just get out.

590
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,919
Hey, old man!

591
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:51,833
WALTER [ON VIDEO]: Get
the hell out of here!

592
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:52,094
Damn, get off my property!

593
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:57,099
[sighing heavily]

594
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,583
[music playing]

595
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,301
ERIC: Good morning,
Walt. What's up?

596
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,086
Hey, Eric.

597
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:31,046
Um, just getting the paper.

598
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:32,656
Well, aren't you going
to take the rest of it?

599
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:37,270
Um, just going
to wait till later.

600
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,315
Breakfast is almost ready, so...

601
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:40,577
Oh.

602
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:41,491
Take it easy.

603
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:49,151
You know, on second thought, I think I'm going to take a walk.

604
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:50,457
I'm going to earn my breakfast.

605
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:55,810
SKYLAR: Where have you been?

606
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:57,072
If your parents
got the newspaper,

607
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,291
I wouldn't have to steal mine.

608
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,249
They stopped
while they're gone.

609
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,772
Oh, that makes sense.

610
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,122
It's the business section.

611
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:04,471
Trust me, they'll
never know it's gone.

612
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:05,602
You want a burrito?

613
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:06,473
No, thank you.

614
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:07,735
OK.

615
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,649
I'm going to start
with a smoothie.

616
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,434
Suit yourself.

617
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:14,046
So Walter, what do
you got on for today...

618
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,483
other than getting
your family back?

619
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,964
So I should probably
lend you some clothes.

620
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:20,443
I mean, we're practically roommates now.

621
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:26,623
You know, I saw your trophies.

622
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,016
It's none of your business.

623
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:29,365
All right.

624
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:30,801
OK.

625
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:34,196
I mean, we are
practically roommates.

626
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:36,024
Maybe it'd be a good idea to get some exercise.

627
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:36,982
It'd be good for your knee.

628
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:37,852
No.

629
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,593
Not a chance.

630
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:41,073
Well, you got to start working if you plan to get it back.

631
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,556
Do you want it back?

632
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,123
It... it'll never
be what it was.

633
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:51,561
Yeah, well maybe
my marriage, either.

634
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:54,347
What else are we going to do?

635
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:55,261
[door shutting]

636
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:56,392
[women laughing]

637
00:31:56,523 --> 00:31:59,569
Oh, I think it's them.

638
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,093
Yup, it's them.

639
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,268
What are they carrying?

640
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:03,182
SKYLAR: I don't know.
- Go look.

641
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:04,183
No.

642
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:05,401
Come on, Skylar, please.

643
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:07,534
Just do this for me, please.Please.

644
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:10,102
- OK.
- Thank you.

645
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:11,320
DEBORAH: Yeah.

646
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:12,756
Yeah.

647
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:14,149
CHRISTINE: Besides,
Joe's going to give it...

648
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,629
DEBORAH: Yeah, I agree.

649
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,675
This'll be really good for me.

650
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:19,633
Hey, is that Skylar?

651
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:20,634
CHRISTINE: Yeah.

652
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:21,765
DEBORAH: What is he doing?

653
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,376
Hobbling on his crutches.

654
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:24,986
Some comeback.

655
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:26,248
Poor kid.

656
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:27,119
Whatever.

657
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:30,296
Well?

658
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:34,343
[PANTING] Yoga mats.

659
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:36,084
The ladies are
carrying yoga mats.

660
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:39,958
Yoga mats?

661
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:47,269
Hi.

662
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,445
I came to pick up my check.

663
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:51,839
Oh, your wife already
called, and we deposited

664
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,320
it right into your account.

665
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,365
What?

666
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:57,453
You've never done that before.

667
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:58,411
Why?

668
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,021
Is there a problem?

669
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:02,806
[stuttering]

670
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:03,720
No.

671
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:05,200
No, no, no, no problem.

672
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:06,332
No problem.
Oh.

673
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:07,986
Hey, there.
You got a minute?

674
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:09,639
They're... they're
looking for you.

675
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,250
Joe.

676
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,338
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.

677
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:13,861
Oh, Joe.

678
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:18,909
J... oh.

679
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,303
[crying]

680
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:27,831
JACK: Walter.

681
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:30,182
You know Tom Jerret, folks from human resources,

682
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:32,619
Beth from legal.

683
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:33,707
Yeah, of course I do.

684
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:34,969
Please, sit down.

685
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,375
You may have noticed Nisha in here a moment ago.

686
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,594
Yeah, I did.

687
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:52,900
She's very upset.

688
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,423
WALTER: I know.

689
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:56,208
Which brings me to ask,how is everything at home?

690
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:57,122
You can tell us.

691
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:58,688
What's going on?

692
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:01,996
Um, I sort of moved out.

693
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:02,910
Oh.

694
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,694
Oh, that's too bad.

695
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:06,609
Walter, having an
affair isn't a problem.

696
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,220
But doing it at work is.

697
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,918
I mean, we've all done things we'd like to keep quiet.

698
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,007
These are modern times.

699
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,661
Have you heard of the internet?

700
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,271
Yeah, I believe I have.

701
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:19,187
It's a great way
to meet ladies.

702
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:21,668
Not that we'd want to know about you doing it from work.

703
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:23,844
Oh, no, no.

704
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:26,064
JACK: I think we're all
saying the same thing.

705
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,109
TOM: Don't dip your
pen in the company ink.

706
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,589
And if it happens
again, we have to put

707
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,330
it on your permanent record.

708
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,420
Not that we'd ever let anyone read your permanent record.

709
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,423
[laughter]

710
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:39,599
You've been a great
employee, Walter...

711
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:42,819
working weekends, never
taking a vacation.

712
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,084
Hey, how much vacation
time you got saved up?

713
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,220
Hey, hey.

714
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:53,613
How'd it go?

715
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,484
I'm taking a little time off.

716
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:57,399
Oh, I know what's happening.

717
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,836
There's a place you can go where they understand.

718
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,056
Yeah.The Executive Suites Motel.

719
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:02,752
I know.
I tried that.

720
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:04,580
No, no, no no.

721
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:07,061
You know, there's a book I think you ought to read.

722
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,497
It's the best book ever written.

723
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:11,587
And it's called the Bible.

724
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:12,501
Have you heard about it?

725
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:13,415
OK, yeah.

726
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:14,590
Yeah, I heard about it.

727
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:15,896
I think they have
it at the motel.

728
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:17,419
Thanks, Joe.- It'll keep you company.

729
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,900
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe,everything's under control, OK?

730
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,944
I'm eating burritos.

731
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:22,424
I'm wearing "Star Wars" pajamas.

732
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:23,947
I'm sleeping on an air mattress.

733
00:35:24,078 --> 00:35:26,428
Thank you.

734
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,908
No, no, no, no, sir.
You are correct.

735
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:29,431
You have no money in
any of your accounts.

736
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:31,085
So she could just clean
out all my accounts?

737
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:31,999
Correct.

738
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,914
They're joint accounts.

739
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:36,525
But we never took
the money out jointly.

740
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:38,919
Actually, we never put the money in jointly, either.

741
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,791
Well, that's not how joint accounts work, sir.

742
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:43,445
Well, what can I do?

743
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:45,012
Well, I think you should understand the principles

744
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,840
of banking first.

745
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,189
Now, here's a brochure.

746
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,148
It's called Your Future is Now.

747
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:52,150
I think that'd be a
very good start for you.

748
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,370
Look, what can you do to get me access to my money?

749
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,504
Well, you should've thought of that before, frankly.

750
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,549
Before what?

751
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,943
Well, sir, there are only a few reasons why a woman

752
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,379
empties all the bank accounts.

753
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,555
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

754
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:07,904
Where's the manager?

755
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,428
I want to talk to the
manager right now.

756
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:11,995
I am the manager, sir.

757
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:13,388
You're, like, 22.

758
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,215
27.

759
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:19,177
What am I going to do?

760
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:20,526
You should have
thought of that before.

761
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:28,273
[gasping]

762
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,753
I have a Sears card.

763
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,451
Pardon me, sir?

764
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:35,062
I have a Sears card.

765
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,718
My family and this bank may have lost faith in me,

766
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:41,982
but the good people at Sears,they still believe in me.

767
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,158
I've got this card to prove it.

768
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:47,117
[laughing]

769
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:01,741
Finding what you need?

770
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:03,264
Uh, no.

771
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,614
None of these is exactly right.

772
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,268
Oh, well, what would
the perfect card say?

773
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:11,141
I'm sorry.

774
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,970
We've got lots of
"I'm sorry" cards.

775
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:15,276
I'm sorry you got laid off.

776
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:16,321
WALTER: Nope.

777
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,887
I'm sorry you're turning 40.

778
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:19,541
[laughing]

779
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:21,369
No, no.

780
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,023
You can buy a blank card and write whatever you want inside.

781
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,158
Yeah, that's a good idea.

782
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,638
And how will you be
paying for this, sir?

783
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:33,468
Um, with my Sears card.

784
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,209
Great.

785
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,952
What's my available
credit limit?

786
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:41,433
You have $718 remaining.

787
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:43,739
Ooh, all right, then.

788
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,176
I just better take necessities.

789
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,961
I definitely need this.

790
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:50,703
Um, forget the clothes.

791
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,661
And I want the yoga book.

792
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:55,185
Great.

793
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,578
[chatter from television]

794
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,058
WALTER: How's the
training going?

795
00:37:58,188 --> 00:37:59,842
Pretty good.

796
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:02,323
I just about figured out how to change channels with my chin.

797
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:03,672
WALTER: Oh, wow.

798
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:05,892
Got you something.

799
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:07,372
What's that?

800
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:08,982
WALTER: It's a vest so
you can run in the pool.

801
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:10,723
It takes the weight
off your joints...

802
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:13,813
for example, your knee.

803
00:38:13,943 --> 00:38:15,945
How do you know that?

804
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:16,859
I read.

805
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:32,614
Hey, when you're done here,I, um, I need your help

806
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:33,528
writing a love letter.

807
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:42,102
What would you usually write?

808
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:43,495
I'm not sure.

809
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,540
Never written a love letter.

810
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:46,976
Honestly?

811
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:49,936
Love letters are something I get, not give.

812
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:52,591
Well, you might want to start learning, jock boy.

813
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:54,462
Your days are up.

814
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:55,463
Thanks.

815
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:58,423
[Walter chuckling]

816
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,294
So what did you do
when you were courting?

817
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:02,035
Courting.

818
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:03,297
How old do you think I am?

819
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:04,907
Let's see.

820
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:06,082
You guys were getting together in the '80s, all right?

821
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:07,780
So that's a very romantic time...

822
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,172
Flock of Seagulls, Styx.

823
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:10,739
Late '70s, actually.

824
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,827
Really?

825
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,700
Was there even music back then?

826
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,918
Like what... that doo-wop stuff?

827
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:18,747
[SARCASTICALLY]
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

828
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:20,793
What was your guys' song?

829
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:24,536
What was yours
and Chrissy's song?

830
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:25,711
That's personal.

831
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:26,538
Oh, now, it's personal.

832
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:30,890
I figured you could use some words from your song.

833
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,760
That's all.

834
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,022
All right.

835
00:39:33,153 --> 00:39:33,980
I'll tell you my song.

836
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,982
You tell me your song.

837
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:37,853
You wouldn't know it.

838
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,724
Too old.

Try me.
Sing it, then.

841
00:39:40,856 --> 00:39:42,118
Sing it.

842
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:43,163
Maybe... maybe if I
hear it, I'll know it.

[laughing]

846
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:02,008
I just wanted to see if I could get you to sing it.

Sorry.

Didn't mean to laugh.

I just... you know, I
thought it was funny.

00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:19,417
Lovin' Spoonful.

856
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:27,555
She used to work
at a tennis club.

857
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:31,690
And me and my friends,
we snuck in one day.

858
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,823
And there she was,
stringing a racket.

859
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:42,527
And she looked up
at me and said, hi.

860
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:47,619
And I couldn't even speak.

861
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:51,100
The next day, I
went and sold my car

862
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:52,580
and bought a
membership to the club.

863
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,239
It's the only thing I
ever really went after.

864
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,028
Till now?

865
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,378
Yeah, until now.

00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:10,772
We're home.
- Hey.

868
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,645
Mm.
Something smells good.

So far, it's just
boiling water, Mom.

871
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:20,390
Oh.

872
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:23,263
Well, still, it's nice to know that somebody is making

873
00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:25,918
something for me for a change.

874
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,093
You look great, Mom.

DEBORAH: Oh, thank you.

876
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,008
How was your yoga class?

877
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:30,575
I loved it.

878
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:32,228
How's your instructor?

879
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:33,969
Why do you ask that?

880
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,015
Sometimes they move
too slow or too fast.

00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:39,845

Stop it, you.

886
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:47,330
So everybody noticed my ring.

887
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,115
Really?

888
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:50,595
Wow.

889
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:52,292
Oh, I'm sorry.

890
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:54,468
I thought my sister
might be happy for me.

893
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:00,692
Is this something your new hippie friends taught you, or...

894
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:03,172
or did you get this new personality off the internet?

895
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:05,958
Many people have lost their lives just so that you

896
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:07,350
could have your little shiny...
- Well, is it...

897
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:09,048
CHRISTINE: ...bauble of...

898
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:10,484
...is it so wrong to want a man and a home and a family?

899
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:11,877
Is that so bad?
- Yeah.

900
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:13,487
Look how well it
worked for Mom and Dad.

901
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,707
Listen, your dad was a
very good man who ended

902
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:17,360
up doing a very bad thing.

903
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:18,318
And I just can't forgive him.

904
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:19,362
That's all.

905
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:21,582
Yeah, Chris, like you and Sky.

906
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:22,496
DEBORAH: Girls, don't.

907
00:42:29,242 --> 00:42:30,417
He just disappointed me.

908
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:37,511
I thought that there was a part of him that only I could see.

909
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,382
I thought he was more
than a football player.

910
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:44,344
I was mad at myself
that I was wrong.

911
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:53,179
Yeah, well, now, he’s not even a football player.

912
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:54,136
So then, what is he?

913
00:42:57,096 --> 00:42:57,879
Skylar.

914
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:01,622
Let's make him something to eat.

915
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:03,058
[scoffing]

916
00:43:03,189 --> 00:43:05,931
[music playing]

917
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:11,153
WALTER: She's coming this way.SKYLAR: What has she got?

918
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:12,067
Oh.

919
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:17,159
[knocking]

920
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,204
Yeah?

921
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:19,597
Who is it?

922
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:20,685
You know who it is.

923
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:22,382
I saw you peeking.

924
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,781
[gasping]
- Food!

925
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:31,260
It's a casserole.
It's from my mom.

926
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:32,174
She made food.

927
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:34,612
That's a good sign.

928
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:36,309
It's got shellfish in it.

929
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:37,658
She knows I'm
allergic to shellfish.

930
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:38,572
Yes.

931
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:39,660
Yes, she does.

932
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:40,530
It's for Sky.

933
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:44,534
Wait, wait, wait, wait, Chloe.

934
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,232
Chloe, please tell your mom that I really want to talk to her.

935
00:43:46,362 --> 00:43:47,276
Please.

936
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:48,277
She won't talk to you, Dad.

937
00:43:54,544 --> 00:43:55,458
[grunting]

938
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:56,329
WALTER: Sky.

939
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:57,243
Hmm?

940
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,595
How do I look?

941
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:03,989
Like an old man
who's lost his mind.

942
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,819
Isn't that supposed
to say kick me?

943
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,037
Thanks for your support.

944
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:12,519
[music playing]

945
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:20,919
[rain trickling]

946
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:52,733
[sighing]

947
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:10,142
[rain pouring]

948
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:36,777
Hey, Walt. What are you doing?

949
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:37,735
Just standing here.

950
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:40,259
I'm not bothering anybody.

951
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:48,658
There's been a complaint made, Walt. You gotta leave.

952
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:49,529
All right.

953
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:54,490
All right.

954
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:55,578
Go home.

955
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:56,492
Ha.

956
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:07,634
STUDENT: [WHISPERING] He’s supposed to be the best.

957
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,940
STUDENT: [WHISPERING]
Guys, he's coming.

958
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,726
STUDENT: [WHISPERING]
Pay attention.

959
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:15,816
RANJA: Welcome, yogis.

960
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:18,993
Let's begin to breathe.

961
00:46:19,124 --> 00:46:19,820
ALL: Om.

962
00:46:31,266 --> 00:46:32,180
Namaste.

963
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:35,096
CHRISTINE: What are you doing?

964
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:36,141
Yoga.

965
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:37,055
Walter sent you, didn't he?

966
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:38,012
No.

967
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:39,492
I'm doing yoga.

968
00:46:39,622 --> 00:46:40,928
It'll be good for the knee.

969
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:43,757
Now, is there anybody
here new to yoga?

970
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:49,241
RANJA: OK.

971
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:50,633
Anybody here with an injury?

972
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:55,116
WALTER: No, no, no, no, no.

973
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:56,509
He hasn't given up at all.

974
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,119
As a matter of fact,
he's in physical therapy

975
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,904
right now, as we speak.

976
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:01,166
Yeah.

977
00:47:01,296 --> 00:47:02,732
Weight training?

978
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:03,733
Yeah.

979
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:07,520
Yeah, that among other things.

980
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:11,480
Look, sir, I know circumstances have changed.

981
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:15,180
But is there any chance that you might have a spot for him?

982
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,530
[applause]

983
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,881
RANJA: Now, your
meditation for today

984
00:47:21,012 --> 00:47:23,884
is to concentrate
on what you want,

985
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,190
not on what you don't want.

986
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,104
WOMAN: OK.

987
00:47:26,234 --> 00:47:27,845
RANJA: Namaste.

988
00:47:27,975 --> 00:47:28,758
OK.

989
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:30,282
Walter did send me.

990
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:32,762
I knew it.

991
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,808
How's the knee?

992
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:37,811
It's not bad.

993
00:47:37,942 --> 00:47:40,945
Will you at least see him?

994
00:47:41,075 --> 00:47:45,688
Um, OK, just a second.

995
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:48,039
[whispering]

996
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:53,566
All right.

997
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:56,830
We'll talk to him
under one condition.

998
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:58,571
What?

999
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:01,226
You gotta get an AIDS test.

1000
00:48:01,356 --> 00:48:02,183
Oh, man.

1001
00:48:10,713 --> 00:48:11,497
Hi.

1002
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:20,027
I only smile because you remind me of one of my daughters.

1003
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:22,334
Oh, nice.

1004
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:25,032
Are you really trying to pickup a woman in a sex clinic

1005
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:25,903
with a line like that?

1006
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:44,312
Sky, when do you think you’re going to start weight training?

1007
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:46,967
Do I look like I'm going tobe weightlifting any time soon?

1008
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:48,708
Why do you ask?

1009
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:50,318
The recruiters wanted to know.

1010
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:51,319
I called them yesterday.

1011
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:52,755
What recruiters?

1012
00:48:52,886 --> 00:48:54,018
The guys from the University of Washington.

1013
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:55,758
That's the only
number I could find.

1014
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:57,325
I'll call some of the other recruiters if you want me to.

1015
00:48:57,456 --> 00:48:58,239
No.

1016
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:04,942
What'd they say?

1017
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:06,334
[chuckling]

1018
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:07,248
No, no.

1019
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:08,423
I don't want to know.

1020
00:49:08,554 --> 00:49:11,035
They said that
if you work hard,

1021
00:49:11,165 --> 00:49:12,471
there may be a place for you.

1022
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:18,216
Not interested.

1023
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:20,870
All right.

1024
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:25,223
Well, I wish more dads would take on the responsibility

1025
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:28,487
of bringing in their sons.

1026
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:31,446
It's for me.

1027
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:33,405
Oh.

1028
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:36,321
Good luck, Dad.

1029
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:37,975
[laughing]

1030
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:39,280
OK.

1031
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:40,325
I just need to ask
you a few questions.

1032
00:49:40,455 --> 00:49:41,587
OK.

1033
00:49:41,717 --> 00:49:43,197
I... I've never done
this before, so.

1034
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:44,982
That's OK.

1035
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:48,724
What prompted you
to come in today?

1036
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:51,989
Um, I just think it's
a good idea to check

1037
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:54,295
things out now and then.

1038
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:56,080
Oh, I see.

1039
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,603
Right.

1040
00:49:57,733 --> 00:50:00,345
And would you consider yourself to be high risk?

1041
00:50:00,475 --> 00:50:01,868
No, no, not at all.

1042
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,567
I'm not... am I?

1043
00:50:05,698 --> 00:50:06,916
Have you been with
any sex workers?

1044
00:50:09,832 --> 00:50:11,530
- What?
- Prostitutes.

1045
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,229
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,no, no, no, no, of course not.

1046
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,015
But you have had relations with someone other

1047
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:19,712
than your wife?

1048
00:50:19,842 --> 00:50:23,498
Um, yeah.

1049
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:25,761
Heterosexual,
homosexual, or both?

1050
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:29,156
Listen, I slept with a woman.

1051
00:50:29,287 --> 00:50:30,984
It wasn't my wife.

1052
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:34,379
It's cost me everything.

1053
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:37,034
So can we just do this?

1054
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:38,513
OK.

1055
00:50:38,644 --> 00:50:39,427
Thank you.

1056
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:43,823
So negative is good.

1057
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:45,303
Yes, it's good.

1058
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:46,782
But it doesn't sound good.

1059
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,306
I know, but it is.

1060
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:49,916
So positive is the bad one.

1061
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,091
But you'd think that negative would be the bad one.

1062
00:50:51,222 --> 00:50:52,005
What is this...

1063
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,398
"Who's on First"?

1064
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:55,313
Oh, you do know some
things before 1988.

1065
00:50:55,443 --> 00:50:56,227
Oh.

1066
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:57,228
Come on.

1067
00:50:57,358 --> 00:50:58,098
I'll race you to the clock.

1068
00:50:58,229 --> 00:50:59,012
Let's go.

1069
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:13,244
[engine starting]

1070
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:20,207
[engine starting]

1071
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:21,643
[tires squealing]

1072
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,959
Mom, Dad, when's the last time we went for dinner together?

1073
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:33,829
Oh, I remember.

1074
00:51:38,704 --> 00:51:41,315
Hey, uh, do you
take the Sears card?

1075
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:42,229
I'll ask.

1076
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,100
All right.

1077
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:44,101
Thanks.

1078
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:45,102
OK.

1079
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:47,191
Let's get down to business.

1080
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:49,584
WALTER: OK.

1081
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:54,328
Um, Deb, you know
of my love for you.

1082
00:51:54,459 --> 00:51:56,635
Not that.

1083
00:51:56,765 --> 00:51:57,940
You know what we
need to see first.

1084
00:51:58,071 --> 00:51:58,811
Hand it over.

1085
00:52:01,553 --> 00:52:02,336
Thank you.

1086
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:10,866
Negative's the good one.

1087
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:12,259
Good.

1088
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,522
So what is it you
wanted to see me about?

1089
00:52:14,653 --> 00:52:16,959
I want to come
back home to you.

1090
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,265
OK.

1091
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:19,962
No.

1092
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:23,009
Now, what we wanted to talk to you about is the wedding.

1093
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,923
The wedding.

1094
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:24,793
OK.

1095
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:25,925
What about the wedding?

1096
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:27,274
CHLOE: It's gotten a lot bigger.

1097
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:30,756
And we're going to
need some more money.

1098
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:31,670
How much?

1099
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,540
DEBORAH: $25,000.

1100
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:33,759
Holy.

1101
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:36,718
$25,000... I don't
have any money.

1102
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:41,462
Well, we thought you could dip into your retirement plan.

1103
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:44,770
DEBORAH: Walter, um, since you...

1104
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,033
well, since you
betrayed our family,

1105
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,254
we've had a lot of time to...to think about the wedding.

1106
00:52:50,384 --> 00:52:59,045
And Dad, we want you to
be there more in spirit.

1107
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,308
What?

1108
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:04,355
I'm not allowed to
come to your wedding?

1109
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:05,965
Well, I'd prefer
it if you didn't.

1110
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:06,835
Chloe.

1111
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:11,753
Chloe, it's always
been a dream of mine

1112
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:13,364
to walk you down the aisle...

1113
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:14,930
both you girls.

1114
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:16,236
Yeah, well, maybe you should have thought of that

1115
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:17,585
before you ate off the menu.
[gasping]

1116
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:18,456
SKYLAR: Holy.

1117
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:20,022
Chloe, stop it!

1118
00:53:20,153 --> 00:53:22,808
Chloe, I'm not going to give you $25,000 if I can't

1119
00:53:22,938 --> 00:53:23,722
even come to your wedding.

1120
00:53:25,854 --> 00:53:26,725
All right.

1121
00:53:26,855 --> 00:53:29,771
Um, just... just a second.

1122
00:53:29,902 --> 00:53:31,208
Girls.

1123
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:34,036
[whispering]

1124
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:36,213
Well, this is going great.

1125
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:37,562
Yeah, super.

1126
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:38,998
Hmm.

1127
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:42,306
If you hammer steel,
it just gets stronger.

1128
00:53:42,436 --> 00:53:44,525
OK, here's what we propose.

1129
00:53:44,656 --> 00:53:47,006
You can walk me to,
but not down, the aisle

1130
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:49,835
if you agree to our financial considerations.

1131
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:52,011
Done.

1132
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:56,145
Um, we do not take
Sears cards, sir.

1133
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:59,148
Oh, man.

1134
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:14,425
CHRISTINE: There's an
old tree planter joke...

1135
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:16,688
Well, hello.

1136
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:18,994
What's a tree planter's joke?

1137
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:22,824
Just the meanest and dirtiest jokes imaginable.

1138
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:24,826
Something to keep your
mind off planting trees?

1139
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:27,264
Exactly.

1140
00:54:27,394 --> 00:54:29,657
Why are fat girls so nice?

1141
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:33,661
I don't know.

1142
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:35,663
Why are fat girls so nice?

1143
00:54:35,794 --> 00:54:37,491
Because they have to be.

1144
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:39,232
Oh.

1145
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:43,410
Why are you telling
me that terrible joke?

1146
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:48,415
You're nicer since you hurt your knee, helping my dad.

1147
00:54:48,546 --> 00:54:50,722
We're helping each
other, actually.

1148
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:52,332
He's not such a bad guy.

1149
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:55,901
Yeah, well, of course
you'd think that.

1150
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:56,989
What's that supposed to mean?

1151
00:55:00,558 --> 00:55:02,734
You know, you're only
a year older than me.

1152
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:05,432
And you're always
way ahead of me.

1153
00:55:05,563 --> 00:55:08,783
Yeah, I know.

1154
00:55:08,914 --> 00:55:12,265
I don't mean it
as a compliment.

1155
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:16,704
You're always looking back,waiting for me to fail you.

1156
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:18,706
And you did.

1157
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:20,012
I know I went about
it the wrong way.

1158
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:22,275
I just didn't want a girlfriend.

1159
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:24,843
Well, maybe you should've told your girlfriend that.

1160
00:55:24,973 --> 00:55:26,453
Chris, you weren't
my girlfriend, OK?

1161
00:55:26,584 --> 00:55:28,150
Just because we had
sex doesn't mean that...

1162
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:29,935
Oh, my gosh, you are such a fucking football player.

1163
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:30,849
Yeah, I am...

1164
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:31,763
or was.

1165
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:32,894
Oh.

1166
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:33,982
You know what?

1167
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:35,854
You could never get past that.

1168
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:37,769
I am a football player.

1169
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:39,074
It's all anyone's
ever been telling me

1170
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:40,511
since I could hold the thing.

1171
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:44,036
God, I am so tired of
this football country.

1172
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:47,909
All anyone ever talks about is follow your dream.

1173
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,954
And what do they really mean?

1174
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:49,955
Yeah, follow your dream.

1175
00:55:50,085 --> 00:55:50,999
Be a rock star.

1176
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:51,913
Be on TV.

1177
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:53,132
Be an athlete.

1178
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:54,829
What's better...
follow your dream,

1179
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,005
or travel to the middle of nowhere and be a tree planter?

1180
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:57,919
Is that better?

1181
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,618
No.

1182
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:07,146
How about listen to the
voice inside of you?

1183
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:11,106
Maybe it's saying
do the other thing.

1184
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:13,587
Maybe it's saying
don't follow your ego.

1185
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:16,329
Just... just live your life.

1186
00:56:21,726 --> 00:56:22,466
You know what?

1187
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:25,207
I did plant trees.

1188
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:28,907
But next year, I'm going
to be off at college,

1189
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:32,301
and you're going to be
sitting here thinking

1190
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:33,433
about what you used to be.

1191
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:41,920
[splashing]

1192
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:45,880
[rattling]

1193
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:12,167
[SINGING] Baby, it's all right.

1194
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:16,389
Stop your crying now.

1195
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:29,315
Nothing is here to stay.

1196
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,450
Everything has to begin and end.

1197
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:37,932
A ship in a bottle won't sail.

1198
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:41,588
All we can do is
dream that the wind

1199
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:50,162
will blow us across the water,a ship in a bottle set sail.

1200
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:54,514
Some might tell you
there's no hope in hand

1201
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:57,952
just because they feel hopeless.

1202
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:05,351
But you don't have to
be a thing like that.

1203
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,310
You'll be a ship in
a bottle set sail.

1204
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:18,233
[music playing]

1205
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:49,656
What have you got there?

1206
00:58:49,787 --> 00:58:50,701
It's from Sky.

1207
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,880
I think this is
Dad's handwriting.

1208
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:57,098
WALTER: Sky, Chloe's here.

1209
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:01,189
SKYLAR: What is she doing?

1210
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,062
She's coming this way.

1211
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:05,542
I see you.

1212
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:12,157
Hi, Chloe.

1213
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:13,724
We need clarification.

1214
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:16,814
Which one of you sent this?

1215
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:17,728
I did.

1216
00:59:17,858 --> 00:59:18,598
Hm.

1217
00:59:18,729 --> 00:59:20,513
Figures.

1218
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,341
You should think about
apologizing some time

1219
00:59:22,471 --> 00:59:24,343
instead of moaning about
your sucky little knee.

1220
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:34,832
Wasn't for you.

1221
00:59:34,962 --> 00:59:35,702
Oh.

1222
00:59:38,836 --> 00:59:42,274
Well, that makes sense.

1223
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:45,669
Come here.

1224
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:48,454
He's an idiot.

1225
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,414
[SINGING IN HEADPHONES]
I beg your pardon.

1226
00:59:52,545 --> 00:59:57,376
I never promised
you a rose garden.

1227
00:59:57,506 --> 01:00:00,771
I could promise you things like big diamond rings,

1228
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:07,212
but you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover.

1229
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:11,564
So you better think it over.

1230
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:16,047
Well, if sweet-talking you could make it come true, I would

1231
01:00:16,177 --> 01:00:18,005
give you the world right...

1232
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:21,443
[breathing heavily]

1233
01:00:21,574 --> 01:00:25,404
You never get there by forcing it but by forgiving your body.

1234
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:38,330
Oh.

1235
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:39,636
Sorry.

1236
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:42,813
Oh, she finally
got you to apologize.

1237
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:43,727
That, too.

1238
01:00:43,857 --> 01:00:44,597
I'm sorry.

1239
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:49,602
You are?

1240
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:50,516
Yeah.

1241
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:57,828
Great.

1242
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:00,874
Now I have to seriously think about forgiving you.

1243
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:03,181
Look, I'm trying really
hard not to be a jerk.

1244
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:04,791
Good.

1245
01:01:04,922 --> 01:01:06,575
You're finally
admitting you're a jerk.

1246
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:07,446
Hmm.

1247
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,973
You do realize that
it's important to think

1248
01:01:13,104 --> 01:01:13,887
about your future?

1249
01:01:14,018 --> 01:01:16,760
Oh, yes, very much so.

1250
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,197
That's why I'm dipping into my retirement money.

1251
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:23,592
Because the future is now.

1252
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:25,420
Your little pamphlet
taught me that.

1253
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:26,508
I'll get you a
cashier's check.

1254
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:29,076
Could I have cash?

1255
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:33,037
You think I can just go and get you $25,000 in cash?

1256
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:34,429
Yeah.

1257
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,693

Hello.

01:01:47,051 --> 01:01:48,443
So you started
playing again, huh?

1261
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:51,055
Uh, not really.

1262
01:01:51,185 --> 01:01:51,925
Weren't you watching?

1263
01:01:54,972 --> 01:01:57,844
You look good.

1264
01:01:57,975 --> 01:01:59,716
How'd you know I was here?

1265
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:01,065
I saw your car.

You saw my car?

1267
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,113
That's a polite way of saying that you've been stalking me.

1268
01:02:06,244 --> 01:02:07,898
[LAUGHING] Oh, come on.

1269
01:02:10,857 --> 01:02:12,641
You look skinny.

1270
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:16,950
Maybe it's from all the stalking I've been doing.

1271
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:20,954
I came because of the, um...
I have your money.

1272
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:22,216
Oh, no, that's not my money.

1273
01:02:22,347 --> 01:02:23,522
That is Chloe's money
for her wedding.

1274
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:24,697
So you ought to give it to her.

1276
01:02:30,703 --> 01:02:33,053
a lot of thinking about us.

1278
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:34,838
Mm-hmm.

1279
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:37,014
WALTER: And?

1280
01:02:37,144 --> 01:02:41,105
And I think that somehow,we're going to be OK.

1281
01:02:41,235 --> 01:02:42,367
We will?

1282
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:43,237
Yeah.

1283
01:02:45,718 --> 01:02:50,157

All right.

1285
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:00,951
Tell me what the recruiter said.

1286
01:03:04,084 --> 01:03:04,998
What'd they offer?

1287
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:05,956
I know it's not first string.

1288
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:06,826
Was it second?

1289
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,134
Third?

1290
01:03:10,264 --> 01:03:12,223
No, um...

1291
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:14,573
I don't know what
they had in mind, Sky.

It's the weekend.

01:03:18,446 --> 01:03:22,015
I mean, you could call them,but no one's going to be there.

01:03:22,146 --> 01:03:23,625
You're right.

1296

Ah, nah.

You know, Deb and I used to play that game all the time.

1358
01:05:14,214 --> 01:05:19,263
We'd just pick up
and go with no plans.

1359
01:05:19,393 --> 01:05:23,484
We'd be driving
along, see a river,

1360
01:05:23,615 --> 01:05:30,535
stop, take off our
clothes, go for a swim,

1361

what you did to her?

Um, it just, um, evaporated.

laughing, joking,whistling, making up songs.

1369
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,111
And then, we started
impersonating

01:06:25,242 --> 01:06:27,809
ourselves being in a good mood.

1371
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:30,987
And then, eventually, we started impersonating ourselves.

1372
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:36,514
We stopped describing our future to each other.

1373
01:06:36,644 --> 01:06:39,473

just evaporated.

1375
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:59,841
you know, that I was missing, and I went with her.

1376
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:05,325
And I told myself that I just wanted what everybody else had.

1377
01:07:05,456 --> 01:07:07,284
But what I'd really done...

1378
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:09,851
what I'd really done, Skylar...

1379
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:15,509
is I gave up the kind of love that everybody else wants.

So then, what am I
supposed to do with you?

1408
01:08:38,418 --> 01:08:40,551
Well, the recruiters said that they were interested,

1409
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:41,421
and they, uh...

01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:42,466

What?

1415
01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:59,700
They inferred interest.

1416
01:08:59,831 --> 01:09:01,789
They inferred... you said that they were interested.

1417
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,400
What they said
was is that they

1418
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:06,403
were happy that you
were working out

1419
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:09,188

always a chance.

While you're in bed sleeping, he's working out.

He's had a setback, yes.

1431

But he's a champion.

He's also a great young man.

May I?
- I don't know.

What the... who's he?

1454
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:06,000
He's Ranja, our
yoga instructor.

1455
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:09,352
And I found a book of tantric sex under Mom's bed.

1456
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:11,179
What?
What's talcum sex?

1457
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,572
Tantric, Dad.

1458
01:11:12,703 --> 01:11:13,747
It's when a guy wants
to look in your eyes

1459
01:11:13,878 --> 01:11:16,054
and do it for a
really long time.

1460
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:17,403
What?

1461
01:11:17,534 --> 01:11:19,449
Well, well, well,
that didn't take long.

1462
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:20,406
You're intruding.

1463
01:11:20,537 --> 01:11:21,842
What are you doing here?

1464
01:11:21,973 --> 01:11:24,584
Listen, leotard,
I'm her husband.

1465
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:25,542
Walter.

1466
01:11:25,672 --> 01:11:27,283
Why is he in my house?

1467
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:29,720
We're having a
simple glass of wine.

1468
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:31,287
I thought you
were a yoga teacher.

1469
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:32,766
Well, I'm many things.

1470
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:34,942
I'm many things for
Deborah, as well...

1471
01:11:35,073 --> 01:11:38,511
a friend, a confidant.

1472
01:11:38,642 --> 01:11:40,513
Deborah, are you
in love with him?

1473
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:45,649
Are you, really?

1474
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:47,912
Well, no, not
that... not really.

1475
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:51,089
But how does it feel?

1476
01:11:51,219 --> 01:11:54,962
Listen, listen,
what we need to do...

1477
01:11:55,093 --> 01:11:58,226
Deborah, we need to spend more time together again.

1478
01:11:58,357 --> 01:11:59,445
Look, maybe we could
go to that Dave

1479
01:11:59,576 --> 01:12:02,230
Matthews Band show as a family.

1480
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:03,275
It would be good for us.

1481
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:04,189
Come on.

1482
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,451
Dad, stop it, please.

1483
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,629
I can't do this anymore, Dad.

1484
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,805
It is too tiring.
I can't.

1485
01:12:11,936 --> 01:12:13,416
Chloe.

1486
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:14,330
CHLOE: I can't.

1487
01:12:17,289 --> 01:12:20,205
You know, I used to think that I wanted to marry

1488
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,772
someone who was just like you.

1489
01:12:24,818 --> 01:12:26,646
And now, I realize I'm
lucky because I have

1490
01:12:26,777 --> 01:12:29,649
a man who is nothing like you.

1491
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:30,781
- Come on.
- No, Dad.

1492
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:31,695
Please, don't.

1493
01:12:38,832 --> 01:12:39,616
WALTER: OK.

1494
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:41,748
Um, here.

1495
01:12:41,879 --> 01:12:44,142
It's just... take...
take the money.

1496
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:45,230
Take the money.

1497
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,144
No, Dad.

1498
01:12:50,757 --> 01:12:51,932
Paul, I'm so sorry.

1499
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:53,194
It's OK.
It's OK.

1500
01:12:53,325 --> 01:12:54,108
CHLOE: I'm sorry.

1501
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,109
I...

1502
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,546
You seem upset.

1503
01:12:56,676 --> 01:12:59,287
Well, change is good.

1504
01:12:59,418 --> 01:13:01,420
I'm going to change
your face, fruit loop.

1505
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:02,378
[shouting]

1506
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:03,422
Ranja!
SKYLAR: Stop!

1507
01:13:03,553 --> 01:13:04,336
Stop it!

1508
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:05,250
WALTER: Come here!

1509
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,294
Come here, you!

1510
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:08,819
Get off me!

1511
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:11,430
TONY: So Walter, you got
to get clear on this.

1512
01:13:11,561 --> 01:13:13,606
You know how a
restraining order works.

1513
01:13:13,737 --> 01:13:15,129
Yeah, yeah, I do.

1514
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,914
And you know you're still out on that other thing.

1515
01:13:17,044 --> 01:13:18,655
Yeah.

1516
01:13:18,785 --> 01:13:20,700
I mean, if it wasn't me,you'd probably be going back in.

1517
01:13:20,831 --> 01:13:21,658
I know.

1518
01:13:21,788 --> 01:13:22,572
I... I... I appreciate it.

1519
01:13:22,702 --> 01:13:23,790
I'm done.

1520
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:25,705
I won't make contact again.

1521
01:13:25,836 --> 01:13:27,011
OK.

1522
01:13:27,141 --> 01:13:29,796
We got it all
back but about $300.

1523
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:31,581
The neighbors thought
you were giving

1524
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:33,278
it away, like the furniture.

1525
01:13:57,737 --> 01:13:58,651
MR. ECKERMAN: We're home.

1526
01:13:58,782 --> 01:14:00,087
Better start cleaning up.

1527
01:14:00,218 --> 01:14:01,437
Hey, you.
Ah.

1528
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:02,873
- Hey, Mom.
- Missed you.

1529
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:03,569
You too.

1530
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,396
Hey, buddy.

1531
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:05,876
How's it going, man?

1532
01:14:06,006 --> 01:14:06,964
- Good.
- Yeah?

1533
01:14:07,094 --> 01:14:08,095
Yeah, it's OK.

1534
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:09,096
I've had someone
staying with me.

1535
01:14:09,227 --> 01:14:09,836
Oh, great.
Who?

1536
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:14,667
Hi.
I've been staying here.

1537
01:14:14,798 --> 01:14:15,581
Walter.

1538
01:14:15,712 --> 01:14:16,626
Yep.

1539
01:14:16,756 --> 01:14:17,714
It's time for me to shove off.

1540
01:14:17,844 --> 01:14:19,280
Um, do you need any money?

1541
01:14:19,411 --> 01:14:20,804
No.
WALTER: You all right?

1542
01:14:20,934 --> 01:14:23,371
- No, I'm OK.
- OK.

1543
01:14:23,502 --> 01:14:24,938
Bye.

1544
01:14:25,069 --> 01:14:26,157
I... I'll send these clothes to you as soon as I...

1545
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:27,027
Uh, wait.

1546
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:34,861
Just... um... here.

1547
01:14:34,992 --> 01:14:36,123
You're giving me your jacket?

1548
01:14:38,778 --> 01:14:39,475
Thanks.

1549
01:14:43,087 --> 01:14:44,001
Thanks for everything.

1550
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:45,655
SKYLAR: You too.
- All right.

1551
01:14:45,785 --> 01:14:46,569
Take care.

1552
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:48,527
Bye.

1553
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:49,485
See you.

1554
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,540
What?

1555
01:15:29,394 --> 01:15:30,177
DEBORAH: Hey.

1556
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:37,663
Girls, I think your
dad might be leaving.

1557
01:15:44,191 --> 01:15:45,541
Thank you very much.

1558
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:47,673
I thought it was an excellent class, as well.

1559
01:15:47,804 --> 01:15:49,806
I haven't noticed
you here before.

1560
01:15:49,936 --> 01:15:51,198
Excuse me.

1561
01:15:51,329 --> 01:15:54,332
Oh, excuse me, ladies.

1562
01:15:54,462 --> 01:15:55,463
Yes, Deborah?

1563
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:56,900
You know what?

1564
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:58,510
I think it's going to be
better for me to start

1565
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:00,294
taking the afternoon class.

1566
01:16:00,425 --> 01:16:01,992
Not Malcolm's class.

1567
01:16:02,122 --> 01:16:03,471
But he wears a headset.

1568
01:16:03,602 --> 01:16:05,256
Why?

1569
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:07,650
Well, you know, because some instructors are kind of slow,

1570
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,608
and some are kind of fast.

1571
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:11,262
And um, Ranja...

1572
01:16:11,392 --> 01:16:12,132
Hm?

1573
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:18,269
I think it was
wildly inappropriate

1574
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:20,053
for you to give me this book.

1575
01:16:20,184 --> 01:16:22,403
I'm sorry.

1576
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:24,231
I wanted you to be
open to new things.

1577
01:16:24,362 --> 01:16:25,493
Well, yeah.

1578
01:16:25,624 --> 01:16:27,365
I know what you wanted.

1579
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:29,933
But I thought you
were getting a divorce.

1580
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:31,978
Well, I'm still
a married woman.

1581
01:16:34,938 --> 01:16:36,330
Wasn't that the
same book he gave you?

1582
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:38,942
Yeah, it was.

1583
01:16:39,072 --> 01:16:41,858
MR. ECKERMAN: Son, University of Washington just called.

1584
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:45,165
MRS. ECKERMAN: When did
you go to Washington?

1585
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:46,645
Walter and I
took a little trip.

1586
01:16:46,776 --> 01:16:48,255
Why?

1587
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:51,215
They made you an offer.

1588
01:16:51,345 --> 01:16:52,564
What?

1589
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:54,131
MR. ECKERMAN: How
did you manage that?

1590
01:16:54,261 --> 01:16:55,480
A little hot dogging.

1591
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:56,960

1592
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:59,440
Well, what's the offer?

1593
01:16:59,571 --> 01:17:01,573
It's not what you think.

Team mascot?

1598
01:17:13,193 --> 01:17:15,761
It's part of the
athletics department,

1599
01:17:15,892 --> 01:17:17,545
and it comes with a scholarship.

1600

Hey, hey, hey... how
was your vacation?

1605
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:39,437
Truthfully?

1606
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:41,221
Mm-hmm.

1607
01:17:41,352 --> 01:17:43,180
Not good.

1608
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:45,312
I was in a lot of pain.

1609
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:49,055
So I took something, and
it made me feel better.

1610
01:17:49,186 --> 01:17:51,057
So I just kept taking them and taking them and taking them.

1611
01:17:51,188 --> 01:17:52,276
Pills.

1612
01:17:52,406 --> 01:17:54,365
Burritos.

1613
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:55,932
Yeah, I couldn't
stop eating them.

1614
01:17:56,062 --> 01:17:57,803
How about that?

01:17:57,934 --> 01:18:00,632

1618
01:18:04,723 --> 01:18:05,506
I need to talk to you.

1619
01:18:08,553 --> 01:18:10,033
OK.

1620
01:18:10,163 --> 01:18:12,905
I'm quitting.

1621
01:18:13,036 --> 01:18:14,777
Why?

1622
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:16,517
I think this will
explain everything.

1623
01:18:28,312 --> 01:18:29,487
I think we need
to call someone.

1624
01:18:38,278 --> 01:18:41,020
[dog barking]

1625
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,326
All clear.

1626
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:44,284
No traces of anything.

1627
01:18:44,415 --> 01:18:45,633
I'm going to open it now.

1628
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:52,162
I think it's a CD.

1629
01:18:58,037 --> 01:18:59,952

But I do.

1638

I can give you hope if you can find a way to let me back in.

1810
01:29:33,455 --> 01:29:36,109
Deborah, I know I...

1811
01:29:38,808 --> 01:29:42,159
I wandered away from who I was.

1812
01:29:42,289 --> 01:29:46,598
And I broke the beautiful thing that we had built together.

1813
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:52,038
But know that I never
stopped loving you...

1814
01:29:52,169 --> 01:29:52,952
any of you.

1815
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:57,174
So now, I'm...

1816
01:30:00,743 --> 01:30:03,615
I'm here by myself.

1817
01:30:03,746 --> 01:30:05,704
I'm alone and ashamed.

1818
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:12,363
But know that I'm...

1819
01:30:12,494 --> 01:30:16,585
I'm filled with quiet
love for all of you.

1820
01:30:19,283 --> 01:30:22,286
I hope you all have
a great day today.

1821
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:23,461
[sobbing]
OK.

1822
01:30:23,592 --> 01:30:24,375
Bye.

1823
01:30:35,255 --> 01:30:36,213
We know you miss him.

1824
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:44,003
Have you two been talking?

1825
01:30:44,134 --> 01:30:45,962
It wasn't just
his fault, you know?

1826
01:30:46,092 --> 01:30:48,660
It was kind of the both of you.

1827
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:49,922
What do you mean?

1828
01:30:50,053 --> 01:30:51,054
For the last few
years, Mom, I have

1829
01:30:51,184 --> 01:30:52,969
dreaded coming here for dinner.

1830
01:30:53,099 --> 01:30:55,275
It's the same food,
same conversation.

1831
01:30:55,406 --> 01:30:58,583
CHRISTINE: You were in
the garden or cleaning.

1832
01:30:58,714 --> 01:30:59,845
You never stop moving.

1833
01:30:59,976 --> 01:31:01,543
It's like you were
in your own army.

1834
01:31:01,673 --> 01:31:02,674
CHLOE: But then this happened.

1835
01:31:02,805 --> 01:31:05,808
And Mom, you got
your spirit back.

1836
01:31:05,938 --> 01:31:07,984
And... and look at Dad.

1837
01:31:08,114 --> 01:31:10,508
He got his spirit back, too.

1838
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,728
I forgave Sky.

1839
01:31:12,858 --> 01:31:14,643
And I know it's not the same.

1840
01:31:14,773 --> 01:31:15,644
You have more at stake.

1841
01:31:15,774 --> 01:31:17,515
But you can forgive Dad.

1842
01:31:17,646 --> 01:31:20,475
I think, in a way,
you already have.

1843
01:31:20,605 --> 01:31:21,388
Come on, Mom.

1844
01:31:21,519 --> 01:31:24,130
You can do it.

1845
01:31:24,261 --> 01:31:25,218
Well, I... I...

1846
01:31:25,349 --> 01:31:27,003
I don't even know where he is.

1847
01:31:27,133 --> 01:31:28,918
I think I do.

1848
01:31:29,048 --> 01:31:30,702
Where?

1849
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:33,183

1850
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:39,494
Ah!

1851
01:31:39,624 --> 01:31:42,801

1852
01:31:42,932 --> 01:31:43,759
Sorry.

1853
01:31:43,889 --> 01:31:45,064
Oh, it's OK.

1854
01:31:45,195 --> 01:31:45,978

Oh.

1861
01:32:06,825 --> 01:32:08,479
Do you have a Walter
Pierce staying here?

1862
01:32:08,610 --> 01:32:09,436
What did he do this time?

1863
01:32:09,567 --> 01:32:11,090
Oh, he's not in trouble.

1864
01:32:11,221 --> 01:32:12,135
He's my husband.

1865
01:32:12,265 --> 01:32:13,658
Oh.

1866
01:32:13,789 --> 01:32:15,573
Yeah, he was staying here, but he checked out.

1867
01:32:15,704 --> 01:32:17,009
Oh.

01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:18,010

[SINGING] Come and talk of all the things we did today here

1872
01:32:46,473 --> 01:32:50,782
and laugh about our
funny little ways

1873
01:32:50,913 --> 01:32:56,092
while we have a few
minutes to breathe.

1874
01:32:56,222 --> 01:33:01,793
Then I know that it's
time you must leave.

1875
01:33:01,924 --> 01:33:05,710
But darling, be home soon.

1876
01:33:05,841 --> 01:33:09,148
I couldn't bear to wait
an extra minute if...

1877
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:11,150
I want you back.

1878

[SINGING] It's not
just these few hours,

1881
01:33:18,244 --> 01:33:22,771
but I've been waiting since I toddled for the great...

1882
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:26,601
Walter, you are
required at home.

1883

[SINGING] And now, a quarter of my life is almost past.

1884
01:33:37,655 --> 01:33:42,442
I think I've come to
see myself at last.

1885
01:33:42,573 --> 01:33:48,579
And I see that the time spent confused was the time

1886
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:52,148
that I spent without you.

1887
01:33:52,278 --> 01:33:55,499
And I feel myself in bloom.

1888
01:34:00,112 --> 01:34:03,507
So darling, be home soon.

1889
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:08,947
