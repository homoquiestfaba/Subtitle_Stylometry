Mr. Townsend,
I was wondering...

00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,501
Do you know what's
most important to me?

00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,200
Do you?

Don't you think?
Sure.

agree with me?

pretty well here, I think.

fraudulent claims.

183
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,667
Virgil has debunked
15 fraudulent claims

184
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,334

185
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,567
Congratulations.

186
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:30,534
Alas, the tedium
of paperwork

187
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:31,834
proves too much
for him.

188
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:33,567
You could've paid
those 15 claims.

189
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:36,567
John here was just asking
for more responsibility.

190
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:37,667
Isn't that right?

191
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:40,267
He could be a fraud man.

192
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:41,467
Put him on Le Sabre.

193
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,501
I was thinking
the Wildcat.

194
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:43,834
Giving him Wildcat?

195
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,133
What's the Wildcat?

196
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,467
1970 Buick Wildcat,
mint condition.

197
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:49,968
The owner...
a Miss Tasty D. Lite...

198
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:51,701
says she was rear-ended

199
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:53,501
in the desert
outside of Vegas.

200
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,033
Virgil is gonna go
investigate the claim,

201
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,133
and I want you
to go with him.

202
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,968
I can't.
Uh, I... don't like Vegas.

203
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:02,334
You don't like Vegas?

204
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,000

Las Vegas?

I don't like it.</i>

206
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,667
Then why did you say
you didn't like it?

207
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:13,367
So...
the car is totaled.

208
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,367
$17,000.

00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,334

confined to a wheelchair.

210
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,534
She's also filed
$180,000 in lost wages.

211
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:24,601
What do you think
our Miss D. Lake does

212
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:29,267
in order to justify
$180,000 in lost wages?

213
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:33,367
I was gonna say...
sounds like a stripper name.

214
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:36,067
Yeah, that's right.
She's a stripper.

215
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:39,834

"Up or out."

216
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:41,801

217
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:43,467
I want you

the stripper,

477
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:55,133
get her to contradict
the evidence,

I take him
to his wife's house.

And his wife was, like,
"Well, thank you.

I told you.

1115
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:52,767
The first step
to fraud detection

1116
01:08:52,834 --> 01:08:54,000
is admitting
that you're a fraud.

1117
01:08:54,067 --> 01:08:56,467
That's bullshit.

1118

Regardless of what
you think you saw,

1119
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:00,200
a woman
had an accident.

1120
01:09:00,267 --> 01:09:02,901
Her policy stipulated
she was due compensation.

1121
01:09:02,968 --> 01:09:04,934
The insurance adjusters
found no fraud,

1122
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,434
so they paid the claim.

1123
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:09,267
They paid...

1124
01:09:10,501 --> 01:09:11,834
You.

1125
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:15,467
They paid you.

1126
01:09:15,534 --> 01:09:16,901
Don't worry, though.

1127
01:09:16,968 --> 01:09:18,367
I told Mr. Townsend
you were top-notch.

1128

You'll get your
Adjuster Level 6.

Heh. That's $1,000.

That's $1,000.

Yeah. Why not?
