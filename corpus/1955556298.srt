1
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:05,482
Spring 1945. World War II.

2
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,887
Allies advancing Europe
trampling German war

3
00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:14,259
machine in its unstoppable
progress towards Berlin.

4
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:19,859
But while fighting in Europe closer to the
end, the war continues in the Pacific.

5
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,995
American and Japanese
forces fighting in

6
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:26,294
the air, at sea and in the
countless small islands.

7
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:31,812
The battle lines are
constantly moving.

8
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,929
At one nameless
atoll, unexpected

9
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,289
the enemy is waiting for your
turn on the battlefield ...

10
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,340
3 months later ...

11
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:35,425
-That was well captain, -Can we
go back to the stomach now ?

12
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:38,347
We have to try this baby
before our guys get it.

13
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:39,850
If you say so.

14
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:42,107
Just remember, you
break it, you pay it.

15
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:20,977
The keeper has act again.

16
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:26,034
one of these days going to put one
of these planes into their parts

17
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,510
I'm just looking out f
or all of us as you know

18
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,400
shut up and grace

19
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:41,340
- okay I was thinking .
 - That's not good.

20
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,231
No really I've been
giving it some thought

21
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:46,514
ِAll I'm saying is this...

22
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:50,067
Switches the planes
where they are needed.

23
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:53,871
And sometimes, like now,
we fly the first plane.

24
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:55,374
Right? - Aha.

25
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,764
I think that if we are the first crew,
then we need to give him a name.

26
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:02,585
You want to give the
name of the plane?

27
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:04,445
Will only call the
plane by yourself.

28
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,283
Will the plane called the huts?

29
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,920
And why not? Is there
a better name?

30
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:11,420
Viki, Lena.

31
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,505
- Hold on

32
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,905
 Roger that I wonder what he wants
to name the plane after her

33
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:21,540
Roger that

34
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:24,931
I'm sorry honey, the captain
says he will not be able to.

35
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:26,647
Prepare for landing.

36
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:30,400
Fools.

37
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:32,698
Ready for landing Keeper

38
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:37,964
Roger that Nicki told on girls will all be
wearing grass skirts before you know it

39
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,355
Welcome to Hawaii, ladies.

40
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,405
Roger that

41
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,293
Captain ... - Say, Viki.

42
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:57,733
You must report to the command.

43
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,280
We should be ready to wait.

44
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:03,720
It will not be good news.
- Never.

45
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,873
Betsy, come with me.

46
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,908
girls if the brass
hats come by remember

47
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:15,445
just so that's what I'm
saying like to see

48
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:17,692
Of course, Captain.

49
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:32,381
Come in

50
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:41,020
Sir, Maxine Vest, Women Air
Force pilot, is reporting.

51
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,961
Miss West, this is Colonel Toler.
- Colonel.

52
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:46,133
Ms. Vest.

53
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:49,355
B29 was delivered
as ordered, sir.

54
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:52,778
Keep this document. You need
to take them and 10 th.

55
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:58,254
The 10-tu? Perhaps Colonel knows we're
flying from Wichita to Lombija.

56
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,428
With a rather nasty weather.

57
00:08:00,468 --> 00:08:02,559
You'll fly again.

58
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,067
As soon as the plane is
supplemented by fuel

59
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:08,243
You and your team you'll
fly on a modified B29,

60
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:11,132
Colonel Toler, its
people and cargo,

61
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:14,512
the airport, and 10, where you
will receive further instructions.

62
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:15,766
Cargo, sir?

63
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:18,817
The burden and mission of Colonel
Toller are a military secret.

64
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:20,949
I understand, sir.

65
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:23,791
You will be under the
command of Colonel Toller.

66
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:25,923
Understand? - Yes, sir,

67
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:28,889
Moving for an hour, I
propose to inform the crew.

68
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:31,022
I understand, thank you sir.

69
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:39,004
What happens? - There is
nothing more than a holiday.

70
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:16,745
This is madness, kidnaps a pig.

71
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:19,212
I can not fly in the storm.

72
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,812
Viki, Toller say that we need to
bypass the storm, we are overweight.

73
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:25,919
I see.

74
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,325
Colonel, Captain says
we must change course.

75
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:29,663
Not. - But, Colonel ...

76
00:09:29,663 --> 00:09:32,714
There will be no change
of course for nothing!

77
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:37,180
Tell that to Mrs. Vest.

78
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,199
Captain, the Colonel says there's
no change of course for nothing.

79
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,839
I see.

80
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:53,945
It's getting worse, Captain.
- Son of a ...

81
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:56,916
We have to change course.

82
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:58,792
Betsy, take control and
maintain a straight line.

83
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:01,675
I'm going to explain
to the colonel.

84
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:04,645
Tell him in my name, captain.

85
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:10,288
Viki, find a place to land
until the storm passes.

86
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:12,029
We get out of the storm.

87
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,509
Colonel, before
you say anything,

88
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,184
consider insistence on suicide.

89
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,398
We can rise above the storm.
I need to land.

90
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,072
If you still can. There
are no other options.

91
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:28,713
What was that, goddamn it?

92
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:33,190
There is a good chance to
land in occupied territory.

93
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,572
I can not let the enemy
grabs our cargo.

94
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:38,079
We have no choice, sir.

95
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,274
Captain, something flying past us.
Something great.

96
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:51,251
Looks like we have company. In this case it is better to
finish at the bottom of the ocean than in their hands.

97
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:54,938
Stay on course.
Murphy, get ready!

98
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:59,140
Did you feel it? Be
careful with that enemy.

99
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,220
Find me a place to land.
- Do you have orders, Miss!

100
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,139
You really would
shoot me, Colonel?

101
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:23,876
Lena! Lena, honey,
can you hear me?

102
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:27,592
Lena, wake up!

103
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:29,491
- Captain!

104
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:32,594
Wake up! - Captain!

105
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:36,130
She is gone Captain.

106
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:40,358
She's dead.

107
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:48,686
Max ... - Position for
emergency landing.

108
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,432
What happened there?
Are you all right?

109
00:11:57,158 --> 00:11:59,830
Lena is dead. - What?

110
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,875
And now together. Pull!

111
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,232
Did you see what hit us?

112
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:10,220
I have no idea, but I
know it was not a plane.

113
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:22,401
That! - We made it!

114
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:24,913
We have not pulled out.
Running out of fuel.

115
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,466
Come on, we must
somewhere to land.

116
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:33,548
We're in the middle of nowhere, Max.
No dole nothing.

117
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:35,580
What attacked us
came from somewhere,

118
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:38,315
There must be some
place, the last hope.

119
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:53,194
One island!

120
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,571
Thank God. - Last hope ...

121
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:58,429
Remind me to sometimes
take to the track to bet.

122
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:02,609
We're going too fast for landing.
We'll have to make a circle.

123
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:09,506
Viki, tell everyone that
bind, We'll be landing.

124
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:10,759
Done. - I understand.

125
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:20,247
What happens? - Sit down, sir!

126
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:23,260
Please, Colonel. Trust
the captain about this.

127
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:26,184
We believe.

128
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,181
Damn, we lost and others.

129
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:40,896
Well, this is going to hurt.
Hold on!

130
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:48,628
Damn it, do not betray
me now, we will succeed!

131
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:51,811
I promised myself that I
would die happy in bed.

132
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:54,355
I do not intend to
break that promise.

133
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:55,860
Hold on!

134
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:28,753
This will be it through
the eye of a needle.

135
00:14:50,362 --> 00:14:52,409
Help me to stop him!

136
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:15,355
I told you so! - Impressive.

137
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:21,290
Congratulations, you have
succeeded despite the poor odds.

138
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:26,640
We have avoided the pan. Let's see
if we have fallen into the fire.

139
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:58,990
I found this. Take it.

140
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:05,822
We'll watch each other.
- I understand.

141
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,928
Sergeant Li, Miss Smith!

142
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:31,540
Let me see your grenade.

143
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,920
Miss Smith ... - I'm huts.

144
00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:35,218
Do you know how to use this?

145
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:38,444
I know. - Okay. If it
encounters a stranger,

146
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,485
I want to make the catch and
throw them on the plane, okay?

147
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,117
Yes.

148
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:47,633
The explosion will destroy all around.
I'm counting on you.

149
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:52,857
You'll be fine.

150
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:54,946
I do not think there's someone.

151
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:57,832
Maybe just an animal.

152
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:03,557
I not wered.- Good. You will
need us to take us back.

153
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,480
Okay.

154
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:13,002
Captain, have you seen
the side of the plane?

155
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:16,388
Yes. What you could
do it on the B29?

156
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:18,395
And if there are more?

157
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:20,567
Can it be fixed? - To correct?

158
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,078
Should not the first
to find what we do so?

159
00:17:24,114 --> 00:17:26,419
It was not a Japanese plane.

160
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,765
Thank you, though I have
no experience, I realized.

161
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,151
Whatever it was, it does
not change our situation.

162
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:37,285
We need to get off. Is it
possible to sustainably?

163
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:39,961
I have no idea. Parts
of the problem.

164
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,642
No luck, Colonel.

165
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:48,905
Okay. First things first. Check
for enemies on the island.

166
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:51,936
You and your girlfriend stay here
and repair the damage to the plane.

167
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,841
You'll be safe here. - We
do not need security.

168
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,601
My girls have received the same
training as the male pilots.

169
00:17:58,638 --> 00:17:59,772
They can take care
of themselves.

170
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:03,205
 After what happened last
year, we must do something.

171
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,355
I think confusing
orders with options.

172
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:11,014
Just advise colonel on the
resources under his command.

173
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:19,917
Well, Miss Quigley will remain with Ms.
Smith to repair the damage.

174
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:21,087
done

175
00:18:24,223 --> 00:18:26,311
Betsy, I've got to know
what it takes to take off.

176
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:27,817
Aye, aye, Captain.

177
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:30,282
Keep your weapon with you and
be close to the aircraft.

178
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,459
Watch the sky.

179
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:37,972
Before you ask, I'm staying
with you, Captain.

180
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:41,525
That's what I thought.
Stay close.

181
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:44,744
Spread out or stay in sight.

182
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:47,335
We will look for evidence of the
presence of the enemy on the island.

183
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:49,761
Fuel, medical supplies
and parts for airplanes.

184
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:52,357
Possible sources of water and food.
You do not have to say

185
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:56,055
how dangerous it is. If you see any
movement on the ground or in the air

186
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:59,460
do not think, shoot immediately.
Here we go.

187
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,402
This place is creepy. - Quiet.

188
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:28,879
What was that? - They call
him the wind, silent.

189
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:40,291
For God's sake!

190
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,017
Here someone.

191
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,109
How he got to the tree?

192
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:52,499
Colonel, this is a
Japanese uniform.

193
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:59,201
Well the answer to one question.
Proceed with caution!

194
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:31,544
This is bad, Marv.
- You worry too much

195
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:41,335
Radio is destroyed.

196
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:46,223
On a secret mission we have.
We will not call for help.

197
00:21:46,476 --> 00:21:53,575
We landed in an empty enemy base. At least I hope
it was empty. Okay, maybe empty. Too scared.

198
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,164
I guess you're right. Cheer
up, on a tropical island

199
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:02,552
we with 4 beautiful women. When
the sun comes up tomorrow,

200
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:05,325
the sky will be blue
and me in paradise.

201
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:12,195
Just think about it. This
is no time for romance.

202
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:14,143
Who said anything about romance?

203
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:19,325
Son, enjoy life whenever
and wherever you can.

204
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:21,750
Life is too short.

205
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:30,484
Damn, and it's shorter.

206
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:44,068
Not good.

207
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:33,977
Maxi, calm down.

208
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:35,645
Will not be able to.
- Colonel, if you propose

209
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:39,370
Calm down, things are not
what they look like.

210
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:44,684
I found the runway with
a lot of empty Zero.

211
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,245
I understand. Murphy ...

212
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:51,443
Pull slowly and cover
us background.

213
00:23:52,153 --> 00:23:54,084
 Make sure that there are no
more of these friends there.

214
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:55,749
I see.

215
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:02,811
This is the captain. That any
evacuation would not be here.

216
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:05,402
A no planes would
not be left behind.

217
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,328
So, whatever happened here
was not the usual battle?

218
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:13,051
That's right.

219
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:15,350
Put the gun down and
let the girl, now!

220
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:12,119
What the hell was that?

221
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:16,854
Enough of this shit, give up
or I'll blow your head off!

222
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,382
Shoot the first one to move.

223
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:23,434
But sir ... - They did not
fire a single bullet ...

224
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:26,067
I think you do not
have ammunition.

225
00:25:27,404 --> 00:25:29,243
Is not that right?

226
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:35,470
Capture them.

227
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:40,194
How is Murphy? - We have to stop
the bleeding and get to safety.

228
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:42,293
Who knows when it will
reappear miracle.

229
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:45,398
Go back to the plane.

230
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:49,896
Take a torch for protection. He
used it when we were attacked.

231
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:53,719
Li and I will find a comfortable
accommodation for our new friends.

232
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:56,162
Ms. Vest, go with them. And
please, no discussions.

233
00:25:56,747 --> 00:26:00,466
I understand, but if
you need to call.

234
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:19,783
At ease, Murphy.

235
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:27,137
They make you problems?
- No, sir.

236
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:30,665
Occasionally something babble but I
think it is happy that they are full.

237
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,119
Do not underestimate them. They
succeeded where their comrades are not.

238
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:36,836
And a few months. They
must be capable of.

239
00:26:36,873 --> 00:26:39,301
I see. Will we soon the island?

240
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:42,603
We are working on it.

241
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:08,768
I expect to find more tombs.

242
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:12,572
What miracle does not leave
anything for burial.

243
00:27:13,826 --> 00:27:18,714
<I> There's a time for everything. For
each question in heaven. </ I>

244
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:25,653
<I> time to be born and a time to die.
</ I>

245
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:32,634
<I> Time to plant and a time
to harvest planted. </ I>

246
00:27:35,475 --> 00:27:40,156
<I> Time to demolish and a
time to build. </ I>

247
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,010
<I> Time to weep and a time to laugh.
</ I>

248
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:53,947
<I> The time for mourning and
a time to dance. </ I>

249
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,346
<I> Time to disease and
weather for loss </ i>

250
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:07,951
<I> Time to stay and a time to go.
</ I>

251
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:13,675
<i>During the war and
times of peace.</i>

252
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,892
Some flights soul.

253
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,185
Cables are broken,
damaged two engines

254
00:29:38,228 --> 00:29:39,817
Some cables are damaged.

255
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:43,452
But the good news is that there
are parts of the island.

256
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:46,086
We can sustainably plane
and fly out of here.

257
00:29:46,671 --> 00:29:49,096
When? - 4 to 5 days.

258
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:51,979
Unacceptable. - That's
the thing, Colonel.

259
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:55,198
And at the time they are not
included outgrown Canaries.

260
00:29:56,158 --> 00:29:57,748
What was that, Captain?

261
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:00,756
I have no idea. Like
something out of King Kong.

262
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:04,434
And there are more. One is not
enough to destroy the base.

263
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:08,128
You heard those screams last night.
We need to get out of here.

264
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:10,997
Radio the plane is correct.
We can call for help.

265
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,591
Can not. The mission was a secret
environment full of enemies.

266
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:17,474
We can not risk it. - We
have no other choice.

267
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:20,107
Maybe there is something.

268
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:25,206
Japanese planes. - I
do not like it, Bets.

269
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:29,930
They have 20mm cannons for defense.
They're too vulnerable.

270
00:30:31,225 --> 00:30:32,312
Explain.

271
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:39,083
We blow up one of them.
Take off all unnecessary.

272
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:41,549
Leaving only a reservoir,
control and wings.

273
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:44,390
We could get to Australia
for assistance.

274
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:49,030
Ms. Vest is right. It would not
be raised from the ground.

275
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:52,249
The screaming stopped at dawn,
which means love at night.

276
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:55,425
Pokretenjem engine and takeoff
to attract their attention.

277
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:58,476
Claws those things are
almost growled B29.

278
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,569
Zero would cut up like paper.

279
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:04,082
How much ammunition
they have ZERO?

280
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:08,131
There are many, but there is no
ammunition for rifles and pistols.

281
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,516
Colonel, we need only
one stripped Zero.

282
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:14,483
You could pick it up in
the air ready to fight.

283
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:17,535
The rest of my crew
would fly to him.

284
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:19,208
This could be good.

285
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:23,009
If all goes well, they would
be here for 16 hours.

286
00:31:25,475 --> 00:31:27,984
When I say that, I do not think
this is the best solution.

287
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:31,035
I'd rather wait to raise
B29 into the air.

288
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,880
The decision is yours.

289
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,057
Accepts offered.
Do what you can.

290
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:43,422
I'm glad you said that. I see.

291
00:31:43,573 --> 00:31:46,290
Betsy, organize Zero and
let Viki help with fuel.

292
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:48,086
I see.

293
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:52,532
Colonel. Just a minute.

294
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:54,482
Yes, Miss West?

295
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,624
I've already lost a crew member
for something from the comics.

296
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:01,671
There are chances to
lose another one.

297
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:05,933
Do not you think we deserve knowing
why it is so important to your cargo?

298
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,197
I understand how you feel.

299
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:11,617
But let me once again
refer to the facts.

300
00:32:12,412 --> 00:32:15,171
This mission is top secret.

301
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:17,010
Highest priority axes.

302
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:21,357
And what is the nature of my cargo is
concerned, is not none of your business.

303
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:24,073
I do not care for your
lack of cooperation.

304
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:27,374
But if you and your girlfriend try
to find out what is my mission ...

305
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:30,969
I will not hesitate to
kill you on the spot.

306
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:34,063
I see.

307
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:40,416
It will be a shame if this man stood
in front of the propeller in motion.

308
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:47,597
What do you think they are?

309
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:50,320
Dinosaurs.

310
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:53,749
Honey, you're your comics
you destroy the brain.

311
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:56,632
Dinosaurs are extinct. - Do not.

312
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,190
Nobody's seen. There are more.

313
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:03,462
That's what they said about dragons, and
yet it is the type found on that island.

314
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,670
You mean the Komodo dragons?
They are not really dragons.

315
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:09,801
They look like they did.

316
00:33:10,594 --> 00:33:14,440
What do you think, Captain?
- I have no idea.

317
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:16,696
I'm just glad that it looks
like the fire is dismissed.

318
00:33:18,536 --> 00:33:21,727
Viki, what do you have?
- Just a moment, keeper

319
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:26,189
It is possible, but
there is a catch.

320
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:30,574
To ZERO reached their destination,
they must be stripped to the bone.

321
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:33,750
Even when we take weapons
and all unnecessary ...

322
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:36,801
a pilot may not weigh
more than 50kg.

323
00:33:36,837 --> 00:33:38,792
Even if everything off?

324
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:41,256


325
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:42,778
That's right. - I'm
a heavy 62kg.

326
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:45,202
Would I have been
able to reach you?

327
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:47,755
I would not know. There
are no guarantees.

328
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:52,140
There must be some way.
- Yes, I am serious 50Kg.

329
00:33:53,352 --> 00:33:57,246
Heavy 50Kg and I can fly.

330
00:33:57,991 --> 00:34:00,750
No, you're not ready for this.

331
00:34:01,543 --> 00:34:03,508
With all due respect, I did.

332
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:06,225
You're on a whole crew
of at least flown.

333
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,487
It is a long flight and
without those damn flying.

334
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:16,172
You're a brave girl, but I do not.
I will.

335
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:18,556
It is the best choice because of the
weight. You know that, Captain.

336
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:23,737
I said that I will not fly.
The thing is over.

337
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:27,164
Ms. Vest, Girl's
our best chance.

338
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:38,282
Is that an order, Colonel? - No,
of course, you know better.

339
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:45,095
Captain, huts need to
fly, and you be escorted.

340
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:52,576
Huts years to zero.

341
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,418
Betsy, Vicky and I
are flying escort.

342
00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:58,009
You'd better fail or you'll
become flooded Mom butt.

343
00:34:58,046 --> 00:35:00,015
You understand? - Yes madam.

344
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:02,858
Okay. We fly at dawn.

345
00:35:13,015 --> 00:35:15,647
Thank you, Colonel. - Ms. Vest.

346
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:35,750
You'll make a hole in
the floor, Takase.

347
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:38,468
Something is bothering you?

348
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:43,817
This was not how he
imagined his end, Captain.

349
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:49,459
Do you feel that you
are approaching death?

350
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:54,439
You know it would kill us. If we
are to die, let us die in battle.

351
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:58,529
Too fast prigrljuješ death.
Our execution is not certain.

352
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,479
With all due respect, sir,
how can you say that?

353
00:36:01,497 --> 00:36:03,628
You know that the
Americans are relentless.

354
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:06,931
You need to learn patience.
As our captain.

355
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:09,856
He is waiting to see if our
enemy to destroy one another.

356
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:13,450
Patience, for the sheep. I will
die in battle for their country.

357
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,257
Do me a favor, Takashi.
Do not hurry to die.

358
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:22,561
The young soldiers are still
rushing to their deaths.

359
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,831
This is the tragedy of war.

360
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:33,470
Hello. - Hello.

361
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:38,988
I'm Vanesa. My friends
call me Huts.

362
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:44,588
Nick from home, so ...
- ice cream cones.

363
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:49,603
Their slogan was ... Huts,
handsome, cute, fun to eat.

364
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:54,829
Sorry, did not mean to ...

365
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:00,429
I am Li, John Li.

366
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:04,817
They call me a Li. - I know.

367
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:07,744
I was wondering...

368
00:37:12,465 --> 00:37:16,687
Is everything all right? - Yes.

369
00:37:17,523 --> 00:37:20,741
I have to watch them, but
I have it under control.

370
00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:22,957
I bet it is.

371
00:37:28,263 --> 00:37:29,644
Well...?

372
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:34,116
I just wanted to ...

373
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:39,717
I do not know if you know,
tomorrow I'm going on a mission.

374
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:43,102
I never really ...

375
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:47,909
Namely...

376
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:17,291
I just wanted to know what it
feels like to kiss you ...

377
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:19,799
before I go.

378
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,061
Huts ... - I gotta go.

379
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:30,373
Thank you.

380
00:38:36,852 --> 00:38:38,231
I like you.

381
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:47,092
You too.

382
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:31,316
All right, ladies,
line up in formation.

383
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:33,818
Betsy and I protect hips,
Viki protects the background.

384
00:39:33,855 --> 00:39:35,491
Done. - Understood.

385
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:43,892
Captain, is this time
really necessary?

386
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:46,901
Done. - I wish I had not.over

387
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:03,007
Captain, the bandits to 6 hours.
- Understood.

388
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:06,796
Viki, stay with huts, Betsy
and I are going to attack.

389
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,975
Only peaceful huts,
proguraćemo you through this.

390
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:13,817
I understand, sir,
but come back soon.

391
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:28,612
Do you have a canary
in the tail, Betsy.

392
00:40:28,697 --> 00:40:30,033
I see.

393
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,675
You are mine. He was
just busted girl.

394
00:40:49,426 --> 00:40:51,809
Stay calm. Do not freaking.

395
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:05,769
When it could so. - What
does it say, sir?

396
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:10,826
Viki!

397
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:16,844
See, stay calm and
keep the course.

398
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,506
Viki. - Do not worry.

399
00:41:36,746 --> 00:41:38,364
You are mine!

400
00:41:40,046 --> 00:41:43,342
I told you not to worry.

401
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,774
Fine, but do not wait
for more last minute.

402
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:56,467
Huts, Betsy and I are
going back in formation.

403
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:58,849
Aye, aye, Captain. Thank you.

404
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,943
Looks like we'll
make it, Captain.

405
00:42:01,984 --> 00:42:03,364
No maleriši, Betsy.

406
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:09,174
Captain, at 3 hours.

407
00:42:09,758 --> 00:42:11,346
Damn, I told you, Bets.

408
00:42:15,191 --> 00:42:17,700
We will not succeed, I order the
return to the airport immediately.

409
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:19,836
But, Captain. - Without
debate, huts.

410
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:21,376
Just 4 100 of them.

411
00:42:21,419 --> 00:42:22,673
On landing, immediately.

412
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,243
Move your butt, ladies.
Here they are.

413
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:42,150
Captain, wait. I'm
going with you.

414
00:42:42,485 --> 00:42:45,200
No, Betsy. Rinse huts to safety.
I'm coming for you.

415
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:04,928
I'm hit! - How bad is it?

416
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:08,189
They can not land. - Betsy?

417
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:12,450
Can, Captain. Be careful.
Bring huts house.

418
00:43:13,036 --> 00:43:15,712
I'll wait for you. Done.

419
00:43:27,246 --> 00:43:30,089
They will not be
able to, dammit.

420
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:40,746
Huts in 12 hours. Above you.

421
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:50,001
Not!

422
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:03,140
Nothing we could, Captain.
- Tell that to the huts!

423
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:05,866
Max ... - Enough Betsy.
It's an order!

424
00:44:06,158 --> 00:44:09,377
But that is not right
and you know it.

425
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:15,898
She was still a child.

426
00:44:16,774 --> 00:44:20,912
What are we going to do now? How
to get out of this nightmare?

427
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:24,131
You can not.

428
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:29,606
Do you know English? - Obvious.

429
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:34,287
Bring him here, Murphy.

430
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:49,751
I studied at Brown University in
the United States. Class 138th

431
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:52,803
I can not tell you
how impressed I am.

432
00:44:54,784 --> 00:45:01,393
Identify slide, duck I'm Osun, an officer
of the Imperial Japanese Air Force.

433
00:45:01,393 --> 00:45:04,143
And others know English?
- Unfortunately no. Just me.

434
00:45:04,143 --> 00:45:07,890
You do not ... - That's
enough, Miss Quigley.

435
00:45:08,058 --> 00:45:11,192
What the hell happened here?

436
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:15,121
Come on, you spoke to
did not want to share.

437
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:22,376
There is no harm if I tell you. Excavation
of the tunnel on this island ...

438
00:45:22,376 --> 00:45:28,705
a group of my people discovered a cave
with eggs of these primeval dragons.

439
00:45:33,465 --> 00:45:35,848
What we are more destroyed,
the more of them appeared.

440
00:45:36,225 --> 00:45:40,781
We could not call for help because it
would not come as soon as possible.

441
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:44,678
We found behind enemy lines,
obsessed with monsters.

442
00:45:45,002 --> 00:45:47,676
We tried several times
to escape, as you are.

443
00:45:48,053 --> 00:45:50,727
But all attempts failed.

444
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:53,988
Destroy all you lift into the air.
- Wait a minute!

445
00:45:54,531 --> 00:45:58,084
You knew that we would not
succeed, and you have not told us?

446
00:45:58,418 --> 00:46:01,553
Would you believe us? Ms.
West, you are the enemy.

447
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:05,063
What you are is less, the better for us.
- Son of a bitch!

448
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:09,829
I'm sorry about the
death of a young girl.

449
00:46:10,163 --> 00:46:13,799
Also sorry for the death of the
50 young people from my company.

450
00:46:14,802 --> 00:46:17,561
This island is a nightmare,
as you said, your sergeant.

451
00:46:18,522 --> 00:46:22,952
But I do not have an obligation to help.
You are still enemies.

452
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:29,052
Then you have no reason to
not execute immediately.

453
00:46:29,302 --> 00:46:32,980
You will not do it. It's
not in your nature.

454
00:46:33,315 --> 00:46:36,826
Try me. - We'd be dead,

455
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:42,255
that the colonel did not think
we would be beneficial.

456
00:46:42,256 --> 00:46:47,351
Calm down, Miss West. We
might still be of use.

457
00:46:48,194 --> 00:46:51,245
But I promise you that when the time
comes, you can pull the trigger, right?

458
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:55,884
Agree slide, duck I have a few
hundred questions for you, Captain.

459
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:00,163
You'll have to wait. The day was long.
I'm tired.

460
00:47:02,305 --> 00:47:09,426
Can I go back to my people?
- Give it back there, Murphy.

461
00:47:14,942 --> 00:47:17,463
All the rest. We
continue at dawn.

462
00:47:17,463 --> 00:47:20,712
Murphy, you first stand guard.
- Yes, sir.

463
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,138
This change in 3h.
Keep the fire.

464
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:30,729
We do not want visitors tonight.
Go to sleep. Dismissed.

465
00:47:43,383 --> 00:47:45,676
Captain? - Say, Takashi.

466
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:49,422
Should not we call that a plan?
- For what?

467
00:47:49,422 --> 00:47:53,634
Getaway! - I have more important
things on his mind than escape.

468
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:56,881
Captain? - The colonel
is an unusual man.

469
00:47:56,881 --> 00:48:02,052
Such a person always has a mission,
and I would like to know that.

470
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:05,935
But monsters? - We
survived monsters.

471
00:48:05,935 --> 00:48:08,434
Our problems are coming to an end.
Think, Takashi.

472
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:14,913
The Americans brought
our means of escape.

473
00:48:14,913 --> 00:48:19,764
When you fix it, swollen by
and leave them on this wall.

474
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:24,973
Only the three men against us,
and one of them was injured.

475
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:27,514
A wife? - They are not a threat.

476
00:48:28,009 --> 00:48:31,544
Means of escape is our wish
that whenever you use it.

477
00:48:33,685 --> 00:48:36,653
But before we go,

478
00:48:37,154 --> 00:48:44,384
I want to know what led to the
colonel to our little home.

479
00:49:14,562 --> 00:49:18,449
I will not be solved so easily.
- I almost did.

480
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,336
May I ask, why Colonel sneaking through
the jungle in the middle of the night?

481
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:24,843
I need to know how many
of those creatures.

482
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,834
Looking for their nests.

483
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:29,584
You said there was an attack on the other
side of the island. That's where I went.

484
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:32,336
I'm going with you. - It
is dangrous Miss Vest!

485
00:49:32,371 --> 00:49:35,880
Do not be afraid, Colonel,
I will keep you back.

486
00:50:44,718 --> 00:50:47,560
We must be close.

487
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,617
I'm sorry about the girl.

488
00:50:52,997 --> 00:50:56,340
She had a name. Her
name was Vanessa.

489
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,776
Her friends caهاتسts.
- I'm sorry about huts.

490
00:51:06,078 --> 00:51:09,632
The decision was difficult,
but I had to try it.

491
00:51:13,015 --> 00:51:18,325
You need to move on.
- That's right.

492
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:36,505
What is it? - See for yourself.
Careful.

493
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:43,696
There are hundreds of them.

494
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,702
Colonel ?!

495
00:52:03,672 --> 00:52:05,929
Hold me!

496
00:52:16,128 --> 00:52:19,721
We got company. - I
noticed, Colonel.

497
00:52:23,317 --> 00:52:26,743
Time to go. - I understand.

498
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:55,191
Are you OK?

499
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:57,527
You will not be happy until
we all get hurt, right?

500
00:52:57,528 --> 00:52:59,303
Incorrect.

501
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:02,813
Is not it? I've already lost
two members of my crew.

502
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,698
Two good and devoted wife.
What am I saying?

503
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,957
Huts was still a child, and
we are almost joined her.

504
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:13,555
What are you doing that's worth all this?
- I can not say.

505
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:16,773
If you have not noticed, we are
in a very unusual situation

506
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,073
from which we may draw.

507
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:21,872
If you can not get out, you
will not complete his mission.

508
00:53:22,415 --> 00:53:27,808
I understand that it is a big risk,
the price is great, amožda be higher,

509
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:32,740
All I can say is
that it is worth it.

510
00:53:34,286 --> 00:53:36,584
You have my word.

511
00:53:36,835 --> 00:53:40,305
Colonel, this is not enough to fight.
We need to know what we are fighting.

512
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:45,152
Sorry, but your
word is not enough.

513
00:53:46,322 --> 00:53:49,373
That's all you'll get.

514
00:53:51,296 --> 00:53:54,973
Let's get out of here. You
need to fix the bomber.

515
00:54:03,413 --> 00:54:07,511
We can help to rectify
the plane refueled.

516
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,346
And why should we believe you?

517
00:54:12,442 --> 00:54:15,282
Desperate people take
desperate action, Colonel.

518
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:19,384
We want to survive, just like you.
- Not.

519
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,391
They Canaries multiply.

520
00:54:24,102 --> 00:54:27,028
There were only a dozen when
we were first attacked.

521
00:54:27,279 --> 00:54:30,705
Listen to their shouts, they
must have been a hundred.

522
00:54:31,457 --> 00:54:34,467
Every lost moment is critical.

523
00:54:34,844 --> 00:54:38,788
My people are trained pilots
and mechanics, we can help.

524
00:54:38,788 --> 00:54:39,788
I said no.

525
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,775
Colonel Toler,
stupidly stubborn.

526
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:48,678
Murphy, put it there.

527
00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:55,573
It could be the difference
between life and death.

528
00:54:55,574 --> 00:54:57,622
I do not know what
you're talking about.

529
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:01,884
You did not fight against them.
You can not trust them.

530
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:06,188
even to help us, not to take them with us?
- Yes.

531
00:55:06,357 --> 00:55:10,160
Colonel, I know we're at war,
but we will not go to the wall

532
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:14,632
If we all cooperate, and transportation
of the plane is your mission.

533
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:18,938
They want to hijack a plane.
- I know, sir.

534
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:24,453
We just need to keep control of the
situation. - You took these people to us?

535
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:28,926
There are seats on the plane, if you
help us, have earned their places in it.

536
00:55:29,303 --> 00:55:32,312
And I'd love to see them in prison.
- That's your opinion.

537
00:55:32,814 --> 00:55:38,037
In the end, the decision is mine.
- I understand.

538
00:55:38,497 --> 00:55:42,175
But my point is still valid. The sooner
we get off this rock, the better.

539
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:48,529
We could use them. - Well,
we will use them.

540
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:52,499
But if you cross the
border, I will kill them.

541
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,885
I do not promise them
off the island, right?

542
00:55:58,894 --> 00:56:03,869
I Miss West, if something goes
awry, blood will be on your hands.

543
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:07,754
No, from my point of view.

544
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:06,222
FKO

545
00:59:47,433 --> 00:59:50,986
Looking for something, Captain?

546
00:59:53,075 --> 00:59:57,378
Just curious, Colonel. Sorry.

547
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:03,774
What are you looking for?
- We'll play this game?

548
01:00:04,694 --> 01:00:07,259
Radim what would you
do in my situation.

549
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:11,882
I think I found something
interesting, if I tell you?

550
01:00:15,268 --> 01:00:20,159
If you ever catch the plane, you will
not hesitate to blow your brains out.

551
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:26,678
Do you understand me, Captain?
- You made your point, Colonel.

552
01:00:35,707 --> 01:00:39,216
Colonel, commands are corrected
and patches should hold.

553
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:43,814
Damage to the engine was repaired, but I
can not guarantee how long it will endure.

554
01:00:45,026 --> 01:00:49,008
Takashi popped radio
from Zero, but we

555
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:52,994
they should be used for a
direct connection with ours.

556
01:00:54,264 --> 01:00:55,997
The rest is up to the
middle of some controls.

557
01:00:55,998 --> 01:00:57,733
We should be ready
by tomorrow night.

558
01:00:58,485 --> 01:01:00,406
Do we have a problem.

559
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:03,457
There is not enough fuel
for the escort and bomber.

560
01:01:03,918 --> 01:01:06,008
We will reach our destination.

561
01:01:06,009 --> 01:01:08,097
There are some gas on the
other side of the island.

562
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:10,980
From Araguna. - We've seen it.

563
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,284
It is surrounded by
our flying friends.

564
01:01:15,078 --> 01:01:18,003
Unfortunately, this is
our only alternative.

565
01:01:19,424 --> 01:01:21,889
It seems that risk again.
There is a chance that

566
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:24,355
get there without
attracting their attention.

567
01:01:24,858 --> 01:01:27,557
We truck to the edge of the beach.
- I'd like to help.

568
01:01:27,574 --> 01:01:30,165
I'm sure you'd like,
but it is better

569
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,757
to leave you under
supervision to Murphy.

570
01:01:33,173 --> 01:01:34,262
Murphy? - Yes Sir

571
01:01:34,637 --> 01:01:39,151
Please escort the captain to
the POW barracks. Captain?

572
01:01:39,653 --> 01:01:44,292
Would you go to g. Murphy? - Of
course, Colonel. Good luck.

573
01:01:50,186 --> 01:01:52,651
We start in the morning
because you love the night.

574
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,661
Let's hope that by
then pospavati.

575
01:01:55,954 --> 01:02:00,132
Let's all but Murphy and navigator
to guard the prisoners.

576
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:05,691
You know what we're dealing with,
be quiet and oprezni.- understand.

577
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:11,544
Back in the lion's den, Betsy.

578
01:04:15,927 --> 01:04:18,101
Start! Go!

579
01:04:26,376 --> 01:04:29,971
Go! I'll catch you!
It's an order!

580
01:04:37,284 --> 01:04:38,956
Come on!

581
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:49,488
Turn it on! Move on!

582
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:20,750
Be careful where you shoot!
- Sorry!

583
01:05:43,111 --> 01:05:46,415
Can a little help, Bets?

584
01:06:10,823 --> 01:06:13,539
Colonel? - Go Li!

585
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:30,968
Shit!

586
01:06:35,107 --> 01:06:37,572
For God's sake!

587
01:06:46,558 --> 01:06:48,899
Step on it!

588
01:07:10,883 --> 01:07:13,557
Whatever happens,
just keep going!

589
01:07:17,152 --> 01:07:19,242
Li!

590
01:07:30,109 --> 01:07:33,536
This is for you, huts. The
sweetest kiss of my life.

591
01:08:25,237 --> 01:08:31,547
They are to escape.
- That's right.

592
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,292
I'd like to think
that this Toler

593
01:08:36,293 --> 01:08:38,444
you do to help us, not only
because of the mission.

594
01:08:39,656 --> 01:08:43,001
Even so, it would
probably be denied.

595
01:08:45,299 --> 01:08:51,903
Toler and Li died we went to the wall.
Let us not fail them.

596
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:16,478
Stay in the truck, Betsy.

597
01:09:42,809 --> 01:09:46,363
The situation has changed.

598
01:09:49,205 --> 01:09:53,133
This time we have
the ammunition.

599
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:57,146
Tell your wife to drop the
guns and get out of the truck.

600
01:09:57,147 --> 01:10:00,322
Shoot, Captain! Shoot the dogs!

601
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:03,039
Enough!

602
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:08,180
Do it now, or both die.

603
01:10:14,992 --> 01:10:17,040
Stay there, Bets!

604
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:22,055
Where's the colonel and another soldier?
- They're dead.

605
01:10:24,355 --> 01:10:29,371
It's over. Put the gun down,
and no one will harm you.

606
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:34,845
We are not barbarians.
We are not Americans.

607
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:39,442
Let her go, or I'll kill you.

608
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:44,791
Then you will all die.
Put the gun down.

609
01:10:49,388 --> 01:10:52,063
Okay.

610
01:10:58,877 --> 01:11:03,181
I do not play games.
Too much is at stake.

611
01:11:03,683 --> 01:11:07,027
More than you know, Miss West.

612
01:11:07,402 --> 01:11:10,079
It is no longer just
a survival issue.

613
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:19,147
I give you one more chance to
surrender oružje.- Go to hell.

614
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:24,037
To try to avoid.

615
01:11:43,304 --> 01:11:45,814
Now it's over! - Whether?

616
01:11:46,774 --> 01:11:50,327
I know that is your mission.
- How?

617
01:11:51,037 --> 01:11:54,716
I participated in the project FCO to
see if it has succeeded or failed.

618
01:11:57,474 --> 01:12:03,241
I do not know what kind of bomb ...
- It not ever say that.

619
01:12:06,754 --> 01:12:12,855
Extermination. Genocide, killing my people.
You must stop ...

620
01:12:13,063 --> 01:12:15,238
That's it, Captain!
Knock it off!

621
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:22,927
I'd rather die like a soldier,
but from your device.

622
01:12:22,928 --> 01:12:26,312
I said, stand down!

623
01:12:29,156 --> 01:12:32,897
On behalf of the spirits
of the dead

624
01:12:32,922 --> 01:12:37,077
and the legacy of Rioja, I promise,
will lead the charge!

625
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:49,132
It was still dangerous.
- He was dying!

626
01:12:49,509 --> 01:12:53,689
I died like a soldier. - You
killed him in cold blood.

627
01:12:54,024 --> 01:12:56,322
Did not you intend to few
days ago, Miss West?

628
01:12:57,032 --> 01:12:59,457
Sorry, I should have let
you pulling the trigger,

629
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:03,406
Tell me, what is your mission.
What's in the area

630
01:13:03,407 --> 01:13:05,894
bomb, or you'll never
get off this island!

631
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:08,735
Msلآنسة فست Seized your team!

632
01:13:11,869 --> 01:13:13,918
You do not have such powers.
You're a civilian.

633
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:16,634
And you do not go
out without us.

634
01:13:17,094 --> 01:13:20,271
What's in the area for bombs?
- Bomba, Miss West.

635
01:13:20,606 --> 01:13:24,618
Do not play with me. This is
not just an ordinary bomb.

636
01:13:26,122 --> 01:13:30,094
This is the atomic bomb. The most
powerful weapon in the world.

637
01:13:30,637 --> 01:13:33,937
Take it to a city the size of New
York and turn it into ashes.

638
01:13:34,815 --> 01:13:38,619
We'll throw it to Japan
and end this war.

639
01:13:39,413 --> 01:13:41,670
And if he fails, we'll
throw some more.

640
01:13:44,387 --> 01:13:49,235
The real is it? - Yes.
I was on the plane.

641
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:55,462
So this is meant by "genocide".

642
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,066
You will kill thousands!
- Hundreds of thousands!

643
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:05,327
We'll save countless
American lives.

644
01:14:12,097 --> 01:14:15,106
Maks! - Let her go.

645
01:14:42,316 --> 01:14:45,074
All these people ...

646
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:04,007
and the island full of monsters.

647
01:15:24,362 --> 01:15:26,662
Time to go.

648
01:15:29,084 --> 01:15:31,885
Everything is ready?

649
01:15:32,113 --> 01:15:33,521
Are you sure you
want to at night?

650
01:15:33,557 --> 01:15:37,026
These creatures are propagated around
the clock. It is no longer important.

651
01:15:37,276 --> 01:15:40,119
We're ready to go, Captain.
- You do not need this.

652
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:44,173
Can everyone in the bomber.

653
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:48,938
Betsy and I, accompanied by the best
guarantee that we will bomb go from here.

654
01:15:49,649 --> 01:15:52,071
After all, it is our mission.

655
01:15:52,406 --> 01:15:57,154
We will be safer than in the ZERO B29.
He would have given us a better shelter.

656
01:15:57,757 --> 01:16:00,892
This is our best chance,
and I want to leave here.

657
01:16:01,309 --> 01:16:05,112
You will get to the base 10, and the
Zero, Betsi.- not birini these for us.

658
01:16:06,701 --> 01:16:09,461
As long as we stick close to
you and mark our position ...

659
01:16:10,629 --> 01:16:13,639
we will succeed.
- It's too big a risk.

660
01:16:14,517 --> 01:16:17,109
It seems that many
reksiramo lately.

661
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:22,834
Remember what happened to the huts?
Last chance to fly with me.

662
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:27,180
I can not, Captain. In
addition, I saw how you fly.

663
01:16:29,479 --> 01:16:31,276
Okay.

664
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:04,462
It was an honor to serve with you.
- The honor was mine.

665
01:17:05,214 --> 01:17:08,309
Call me madam again and
I'll rip your head off.

666
01:17:09,352 --> 01:17:12,110
Happy landings, girls.

667
01:17:26,448 --> 01:17:28,954
Ms. Vest. - Colonel?

668
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:35,559
They are good soldiers. We
should be proud of them.

669
01:17:35,892 --> 01:17:38,484
Every minute of every day, sir.

670
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:45,339
Come on, Colonel.
Waiting for us the sky.

671
01:17:54,493 --> 01:17:57,544
Let's go girls. Stay close.
- I understand.

672
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:07,073
Are you at the point, Colonel?
- I confirm.

673
01:18:08,285 --> 01:18:11,379
They come at 6 o'clock. There
must be thousands of them.

674
01:18:11,922 --> 01:18:13,720
Stay calm, Betsy, and follow me.

675
01:18:14,053 --> 01:18:16,227
We'll take their numbers.

676
01:18:17,815 --> 01:18:21,701
We're coming, Captain.
- Stay in formation, Betsy!

677
01:18:21,911 --> 01:18:25,923
Colonel, you have the honor.
- With pleasure, Miss Vest!

678
01:18:31,482 --> 01:18:33,446
This was good.

679
01:18:33,781 --> 01:18:38,922
I still come. Let's get started.
- Permission granted. Give 'em hell, girl.

680
01:18:50,081 --> 01:18:54,721
We have company in 3 hours, above.
- I understand, Colonel.

681
01:19:03,748 --> 01:19:07,050
Not! Damn! - What happens?

682
01:19:09,725 --> 01:19:13,695
The fourth engine was again
on fire, Colonel. Not good.

683
01:19:22,138 --> 01:19:25,356
Viki, these things are faster
than lightning. Are you OK?

684
01:19:25,357 --> 01:19:28,576
Yes. Damn.

685
01:19:29,579 --> 01:19:32,295
New tactics. I'll be the
bait, you follow me?

686
01:19:32,296 --> 01:19:35,011
Admittedly, I follow you!

687
01:19:38,647 --> 01:19:43,663
I just hope that you're as
good as you think I am jesi.-.

688
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:54,239
Do not get too close!

689
01:20:03,302 --> 01:20:06,480
Somehow suddenly too quiet.
- I beg your pardon?

690
01:20:08,157 --> 01:20:11,708
Do not scratch it, baby.
- I understand.

691
01:20:13,757 --> 01:20:17,685
Just a walk in the park. Are
you going again? - Can.

692
01:20:26,798 --> 01:20:28,971
How are you doing, girls?

693
01:20:29,641 --> 01:20:34,655
We stick to, boss. But just barely.
- Take care.

694
01:20:47,193 --> 01:20:49,577
Betsy, change places!
Immediately!

695
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:24,307
Viki! - Viki? Betsy,
what's happening?

696
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:30,452
Were seized Viki and I were on the tail!
- I am coming. Hold on!

697
01:21:33,169 --> 01:21:35,251
You can not, Vest.
- We'll be back!

698
01:21:35,342 --> 01:21:37,917
We have to continue, a bomb in the
first place. Nothing else matters.

699
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:40,692
We'll be back! - Continue mission!
It's an order!

700
01:21:41,862 --> 01:21:45,665
I can not hear you, Colonel! Too
much interference on the line!

701
01:22:00,254 --> 01:22:02,761
Betsy, what's happening?

702
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:09,825
Vest, turn around now!
- I will not leave!

703
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:14,295
She's done. Nothing can.
- Not. He'll pull through.

704
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:19,521
He's a good pilot. I will not leave you
alone on that island. We'll be back.

705
01:22:39,582 --> 01:22:41,922
Vest, what happened?

706
01:22:42,467 --> 01:22:48,820
Something hit us, check.
- I'm on it!

707
01:23:34,043 --> 01:23:37,134
Ms. Vest! - Colonel,
what hit us?

708
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:42,025
Bomb was dropped.

709
01:23:44,932 --> 01:23:46,665
Climb up as fast as you can!

710
01:23:50,927 --> 01:23:54,898
Colonel, are you all right?
Contact!

711
01:24:58,221 --> 01:25:03,654
God, what have we done?
- Sign me up, Captain.

712
01:25:03,905 --> 01:25:07,249
Betsy? Betsy! How did
you get out from there?

713
01:25:11,094 --> 01:25:15,273
I pulled out of kovita and asked for you.
Looks like we missed in the clouds.

714
01:25:16,068 --> 01:25:18,951
Probably so.

715
01:25:19,996 --> 01:25:23,465
I think I would avoid the
explosion I was not far away.

716
01:25:25,596 --> 01:25:28,398
It was an ugly firecracker.

717
01:25:33,956 --> 01:25:40,935
Captain, I've never seen
anything like it. Never.

718
01:25:42,525 --> 01:25:46,536
It looked like the end of the world.
- I know.

719
01:25:49,713 --> 01:25:52,639
Is there damage to the plane, Betsy?
Are you OK?

720
01:25:53,015 --> 01:25:55,188
I'm a little banged
up, but I'll be fine.

721
01:25:55,523 --> 01:25:57,990
There is no way to land.
I'm gonna have to jump.

722
01:25:58,657 --> 01:26:00,538
Stay with me as much as you can.

723
01:26:00,539 --> 01:26:03,019
I'll mark your position and I
will send someone to pick you up.

724
01:26:03,255 --> 01:26:04,299
I see.

725
01:26:07,267 --> 01:26:10,611
Max ... - Yeah, Bets?

726
01:26:11,989 --> 01:26:14,958
I thought, when we
return to Tinigan ...

727
01:26:15,293 --> 01:26:18,469
to call the plane after
the huts, as she wanted.

728
01:26:18,969 --> 01:26:23,317
We have to force them to do so. Right?
- Okay.

729
01:26:24,152 --> 01:26:28,333
I'll leave them to paint it.
- Agreed.

730
01:26:29,335 --> 01:26:31,248
Thank you, Max.

731
01:26:35,911 --> 01:26:37,821
It's all right, Betsy.

732
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:41,875
Just hold on and stay close.

733
01:26:45,385 --> 01:26:47,555
Go home.
