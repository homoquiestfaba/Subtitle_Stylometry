00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,535
SANTA:
This is Christmastown in the North Pole.

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,430
One of the things you need to know
is that everyone who lives here...

3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,406
is happy all the time. Really happy.

4
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,808
I mean, really, really happy.

5
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,609
Honestly, sometimes it's a bit much.

6
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,979
But happiest of all was Buddy the Elf.

7
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:46,284
Well, he wasn't really an elf,
but we'll get to that later.

8

(SINGING) Christmas elves enjoy themselves
By donning gay apparel

9
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,322
Or by singing songs in Santa's shop

10
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,759
Fa-la-la, la-la, la-la-la

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,477
Of course, I always like it
When they sing a Christmas carol

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,671
I like it even better when they stop

13
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:05,374
Night and day, they dance and play
They never sleep much either

14
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,307
Would some peace and quiet be a crime?

15
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,810

16
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,438
Of course, I love each one of them
But Santa needs a breather

17
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,711
Because they're just so happy
all the time

18
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,548
- They're oddly
- Happy all the time

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,781
- Ungodly
- Happy all the time

20
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:23,519
When they sing until they're bluish
Santa wishes he were Jewish

21
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,219
- 'Cause they're
- Happy all the time

22
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,387
- I swear they're
- Happy all the time

23
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:31,525
- Bizarrely happy
- All the time

24

Who makes them look apathetic

25

We might end up diabetic

26

But he'll leave your eardrums ringing

27

He has to tell the world he's singing

Sorry, Ming Ming.

34
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,390
That's okay, Buddy.

35
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,168
(SINGING) My spine will heal
Because I'm happy all the time

36
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,567
Okay, elves, you've got toys to make.

37
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,641
Yay! Time to go to work.

39
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,078
Happy all the time

40
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,877
Making toys is so appealing
That I spend each morning squealing

41
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,518
True, he's happy all the time

42
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,052
- Who knew? I'm happy all the time
- Happy all the time

43
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,850
He's unnaturally happy

00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:32,395

Oh, no. I made a big mess again.

It's okay, Buddy.

I only made 400 rocking horses.

Well, Buddy, let me tell you a story
I should have told years ago.

A story.

Whoo-hoo! I love story time.

Holy moly! My legs! My legs!

62
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,812
- Aah!
- A story about your legs?

63
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,311
I love it already.

64

No, Buddy. Just listen.

65
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:31,717
Once upon a time, on a Christmas night,
I slid down the chimney of an orphanage.

66

While I was putting presents
under the tree...

67
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,126
a baby crawled, unseen,
into my toy sack...

68
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,730
and I brought him back here by mistake.

69
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,029
Never having stolen a baby before,
I didn't know what to do.

70
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,536
So the elves took him in
and raised him as one of their own.

71
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:54,737
And as the years went on,
he grew bigger and bigger and bigger.

72
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,775
Oh. So I'm a giant elf.

73
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,179
- No. Buddy, you're...
- Wait.

74
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,787
I thought this was a story
about your legs.

No, this is your story.

- Well, actually, Buddy the Human.
- Human?

78
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,359
Your mother's name was Susan Wells.

79

Now all you have left is your father,

or peppermint sticks?

Uh, he doesn't like either.

94

Well, the world's greatest dad must have
a top-of-the-line, one-horse open sleigh.

Well, then how does he dash
through the snow?

he's just lost the Christmas spirit.

We'll eat gingerbread instead

What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,841
When a room is gloomy
And its atmosphere has called it quits

343
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:53,609
Then you must remember
That December is a time for glitz

344
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,219
Never stop until each limb
On your Christmas tree

345
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:01,290
Is sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingley

346
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,625
Pick up every ornament
That's sitting, waiting on a shelf

347
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:11,029
While you're busy decorating
Why not decorate yourself?

348
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,535
Soon you'll bring a smile
To every person you see

349
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,008
- I'm sparkle-twinkle-jolly... What?
- Close enough.

To thine own elf be true

On every wall and every nook

SANTA: So Buddy did his best
to spread Christmas cheer.

365
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:24,970
But it would take more than some tinsel and
lights to get Walter off the Naughty List.

366
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,871
Can you please pass the maple syrup?

367
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,808
I'm sorry. I didn't set out any syrup.

368
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,538
It's spaghetti.

369
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,877
That's okay. I think I have some.

370
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,051
Cool. Hey, me next.

Oh.

We've been tinkering with the story
of a snowman that comes to life...

named Freezy the Snowman.

378
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,139
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We even have a song.

(SINGING) Freezy the Snowman

380

do you wanna hear me play the kazoo?

00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,013
Buddy, enough with the kazoo!

385
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:21,197
I'm sorry. But my boss, Mr. Greenway,
gets really cranky when he's upset.

What kind of an office is this?

387

Doesn't anyone do any work around here?

as poorly run as this one.

Get back to work!

Oh. When my boss is having a tough day,
we bring him milk and cookies...

398
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,592
and sing Christmas carols
so he forgets his troubles.

399

Buddy, you're a genius.

400
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,107
We distract Greenway with tinsel and eggnog,
and all that other holiday nonsense...

402

and he won't notice
how lame our ideas are.

403
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:15,749
Oh. I can help decorate. And we can all
dress up like gingerbread men and sing.

404
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,615
Uh, that's okay, Buddy.
We can handle it from here.

I'm not very good.

Well, neither am I.
I was the worst skater in the North Pole.

They called me the triple klutz.

Anyway, so who's your favorite reindeer?

Mine's Dasher, followed by Comet,

I wish I could still get as excited
about the holidays as you.

to spread Christmas cheer...

00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,376
No way, José.

683
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:22,719
Go spread as much Christmas cheer as you can
and we'll get that sleigh off the ground.

684
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,382
Go, go, go.

685
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,330
Get those presents!

686
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,228
All right, Buddy.

687
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,732
Lock and load.

688
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,560
Let's do this.

689
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,105
There's too many, Buddy. Hang on.

690
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,636
Hyah! Hyah!

691
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,982
MICHAEL:
Okay, let's spread some Christmas cheer.

692
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,176
We can't let Buddy down.

693
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,287
Buddy? Buddy the Elf?

694
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,851
How do you know Buddy?

695
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,422
He's the one who told me...

696
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:00,359
the best way to spread Christmas cheer
is singing loud for all to hear.

697
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,623
A song. That's a great idea.

698
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,289
We should go out there and sing.

699
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,163
Uh, I don't like singing
in front of people.

700
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,306
Oh, where's your Christmas spirit?
Buddy needs us to do this.

701
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,906
Walter, if she doesn't wanna sing...

702
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,272
If Buddy's in trouble,
then I wanna help. Let's go.

703
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,555
Come on, Jovie, you can do this.

704
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,452
It's for Buddy.

705
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,586
(SINGING) All you have to do

706
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,628
Is move your voice much higher

707
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:38,494
High, low, high, low

708
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,535
High

709
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:47,501
Just sing a Christmas song

710
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:52,478
It's like magic if things go wrong

711
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:56,744
Just spread some Christmas cheer

712
00:37:56,907 --> 00:38:01,083
By singing loud for all to hear

713
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:06,122
Just sing a Christmas song

714
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,994
And keep on singing all season long

715
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:15,365
Think of the joy you'll bring

716
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:19,599
If you just close your eyes and sing

717
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,604
Give me those presents!

718
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,009
Buddy, I don't think we can outrun them.

719
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,279
BUDDY: We just need
a little more Christmas spirit.

720
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,581
Come on, Dad. Sing.
Show some Christmas spirit.

721
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,526
(SINGING) Just sing a Christmas song

722
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:43,894
And keep on singing all season long

723
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,730
Just sing a Christmas song

724
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:52,398
And keep on singing all season long

725
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,376
SANTA: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

726
00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:00,877
ALL (SINGING): And if you're short on cheer
Think about that year

727
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:05,043
You woke up to find
A brand-new snow had fallen

728
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,816
The ornaments you made
Way back in second grade

729
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:13,485
Untangling the Christmas lights
Took your father several nights

730
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:17,565
Your mother claimed that she had proof
There were reindeer on the roof

731
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:23,638
Remember who you were back then
Let those moments live again

732
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,434
Live again

733
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,734
BUDDY: Whoa!

734
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,770
(GRUNTS)

735
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,842
I'm okay.

736
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,642
SANTA: Good job, everybody.

737
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:40,221
Santa's got his mojo back.
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

738
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,891
You want a ride back to the North Pole,
Buddy?

739
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,154
No, thanks, Santa. I'm happy here.

740
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,922
This is Jovie.

741
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,066
I think she's my girlfriend.

742
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,793
Heh, heh, heh. Hi, Santa.

743
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,837
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

744
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,996
Oh, no.

745
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,772
I don't have any presents.

746
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,643
ALL (SINGING):
Just sing a Christmas song

747
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:12,311
It's like magic if things go wrong

748
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:17,289
Think of the joy you'll bring
If you just close your eyes

749
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,859
If you just close your eyes

750
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,121
SANTA: Now, that's the spirit.

751
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:26,997
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all, a good night!

752
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:33,664
ALL (SINGING): And sing

753
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:37,741
This is the most amazing
Christmas Eve ever!

754
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,644
Yeah. I don't even care
that I quit my job.

755
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,375
I quit my job.

756
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,712
What are we gonna do?

757
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,979
We'll just cut back on some things.

758
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,989
- You still got each other.
- And one heck of a story, Mr. Hobbs.

(GASPS)

760
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,852
A story. That's it.

(SINGING) Page one

762
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:05,940
Fresh out of toys
Santa makes his way back

763
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:12,876
When he hears a small noise
From inside of his pack

764
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,643
A sound that's not unlike a baby's cry

765
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,846
It's enough to leave
the jolly guy perplexed

766
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,046
And?

767
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,625
(SINGING)
Come on, Buddy, what comes next?

Page two

769
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:29,757
Back from his ride
Santa gathers his elves

770
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,365
ELVES (SINGING): He gathers his elves

771
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:37,632
BUDDY: And they quickly decide
They'll raise the baby themselves

772
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:41,038
The North Pole
Isn't made for humans, though

773
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:45,442
And soon the phony elf
Begins to grow so tall

774
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:49,141
- He
- Learns he's human after all

775
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:53,453
ALL: It's the story of Buddy the Elf

776
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,820
It's the story of Buddy the Elf

It's the story of

WALTER: And the books
will fly right off the shelf

ALL: It's the story of Buddy the Elf

780
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,994
And maybe Buddy helps his dad

781
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,662
In a setting much like this

(TIRES SCREECHING)

783
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:19,811
And maybe his father learns
A son is something he can't dismiss

784
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:26,785
They might learn that they need each other
Much more than they know

785
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:33,418
Maybe the point of the story
Is it's never too late to grow

786
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,791
It's never too late to grow

787
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,093

It's the story of

And the books will fly
right off the shelf

00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:52,844
It's the story of Buddy the Elf

792
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:56,246
- SANTA: I love it, I love it, I do
- ALL: The elf

793
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,149
- I love it, I love it, I do
- ALL: The elf

Love the story, love the story

That's the story of Buddy the Elf...

which has gone on to become the
best-selling children's book in the world.

799
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,304
And it probably
won't come as a surprise to you...

800
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:23,843
that they all lived happily ever after.

801
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,242
Read it again. Read it again.

802
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,713
