1
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,745
<i>What is it?</i>

2
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,114
<i>Can</i>
<i>you stop filming me?</i>

3
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,215
<i>Yeah.</i>

4
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,119
<i>-It's a heart.</i>
<i>-Little heart?</i>

5
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:04,164
All right,
settle down, class.

6
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,366
Hey.

7
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,202
Settle down, class?

8
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,239
Thank you.

9
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,841
We have a guest here that
would like to talk to you

10
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,476
about a very important issue.

11
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,613
-Detective Mitchell?
-Thank you.

12
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,180
Hi everyone.

13
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,381
I'm investigating
the disappearance

14
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,518
of your classmate,
Melissa Brown.

15
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,385
A daughter, a sister,

16
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,454
and a dear friend
of many of you.

17
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,323
This case has been
frustrating and heartbreaking

18
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,692
for all concerned.

19
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,594
Unfortunately, at this
point in the case,

20
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:34,394
we suspect foul play.

21
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,731
Any detail could be
vitally important

22
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,265
in helping us locate her.

23
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,167
And as always,
Counselor Fink's office

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,170
is always open if you
guys need to talk.

25
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,371
Okay?

26
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,205
Notebooks out.

27
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,119
You know this girl?

28
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,190
Hey, Schroder.

29
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,227
What's up?

30
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,295
Hey, so this is
kind of awkward,

31
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,900
but your dad is on the
board at Penbrook, right?

32
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,503
You want me to put in a good
word for you, don't you?

33
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,370
Someone else already
asked you to do that?

34
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,906
Yeah, just you and every other

35
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,474
scholarship kid at this school.

36
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,712
Well, difference is I'm
actually just wait listed.

37
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,446
So, I was thinking
maybe if your dad

38
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,948
could write me a letter
of recommendation

39
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,315
that would help swing
things in my favor?

40
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,885
Yeah, that's not
really how this works,

41
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:06,453
but I wouldn't expect
you to understand that.

42
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,422
I mean, we barely
even know each other.

43
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,193
We've been in every class
together since freshman year.

44
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,763
Right. Uh...

45
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:18,398
Maybe you should just
call my dad's office.

46
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,267
I have tried, multiple times.

47
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,537
His secretary just keeps
telling me that he's busy.

48
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,471
So I thought--

49
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:25,305
There you go.

50
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,206
He's a busy guy.

51
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,842
His dad's a fucking
congressman, bro.

52
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,409
- Busy guy.
- What the fuck do you expect?

53
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,411
Hey, are you still having your

54
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,213
Heaven and Hell party tonight?

55
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,349
Do you see this man's face?

56
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,351
Yeah, it's to be expected.

57
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:41,689
It's a theme party, in
case you didn't catch that.

58
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:52,867
Hey.

59
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,301
Hey.

60
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,204
Well, what was that?

61
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,774
Um, we're gonna go to
a party tonight.

62
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,374
-His party?
-Yeah.

63
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,375
Yeah, no way am I going.

64
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,377
Yes, it's gonna be fun.

65
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,012
We hate fun.

66
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:06,279
Well, this...

67
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:10,518
Is this about Penbrook?

68
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,986
Okay, so what's your plan?

69
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,321
You're gonna, what, use
Schroder to get to his dad?

70
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,656
I don't know, I don't know.

71
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,390
I don't know, this
might be my only chance,

72
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,926
and you're not gonna
leave me behind.

73
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,595
Of course not, but
we're not even invited.

74
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:23,363
You don't have to be invited
to a high school party,

75
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,933
you just show up...um,

76
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,467
in themed costumes.

77
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:28,335
Nope!

78
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,722
That's your
Mama's coat, isn't it?

79
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:24,457
Huh.

80
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:27,427
Are your girls
cold or something?

81
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,531
Actually, I like my
body being covered up.

82
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:31,398
Thank you.

83
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:36,737
All right,
Zara.

84
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:38,973
Y'all are in the fancy part
of town, I'll tell you what.

85
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,473
Why don't you hand
out some of these

86
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,542
business cards for
me at the party?

87
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,144
Dad.

88
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,513
Actually, you can
just pull over.

89
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,714
Right here's fine.

90
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,416
Mess up this
guy's grass.

91
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,450
Dad, stop.

92
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,520
Dad, Dad, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

93
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:53,855
- Stop, okay.
- I stopped!

94
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,056
Thank you.

95
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,489
Thanks for
the ride, Mr. Murphy.

96
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:57,692
You're welcome, darling.

97
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,960
Y'all have fun.

98
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:00,995
Okay.

99
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:01,929
-For you?
-Oh, god.

100
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:02,930
You actually bought them.

101
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:04,165
Oh, Dad?

102
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,233
Hey, what are you doing?

103
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,300
I'm just gonna
walk you over there.

104
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,502
No, it's okay,
Dad, it's okay, your back.

105
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,837
I don't want you to
strain your back.

106
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,072
I want you to be safe.

107
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,405
It's okay, it's
just, it's right there.

108
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,440
We'll be fine.

109
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,643
All right, you win.

110
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,680
Thank you.

111
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,381
Okay, well, we'll call you.

112
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,416
I know.

113
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,654
'Cause if you don't,
I'm rolling right up

114
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,023
to the front door
in my baby here.

115
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,625
God, I hate how
much you love this car.

116
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,426
Okay, we'll call. Bye!

117
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,864
Not as much as I love you.

118
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:38,900
The wings look good!

119
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,669
-Black is a nice touch.
-Yeah, I like them.

120
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,938
So excited, you know?

121
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:46,207
I can hear your sarcasm.

122
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,175
I cannot believe
you're making me do this.

123
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,176
It's not
gonna be as bad--

124
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,145
I mean, look at them,
they're already leaving.

125
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,179
Clearly it sucks.

126
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:53,480
No.

127
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:54,282
-Zara--
-Please.

128
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:55,716
Come on, Eden, seriously.

129
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,951
Look at this fucking house!

130
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,485
Listen to me, okay?

131
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,855
I have a plan, and it's
gonna go so smoothly,

132
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:04,625
and we'll be super fast, and
if while we're here, you know,

133
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:05,726
Schroder decides
that we're besties

134
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,194
and he wants to
introduce me to his dad,

135
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,562
and then I get to go
to Penbrook with you,

136
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,898
then all this is worth it.

137
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:13,634
You really think that
you're gonna become besties

138
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:15,036
in one fucking night?

139
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,504
Schroder sucks.

140
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,872
-Listen--
-Schroder sucks.

141
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,173
I know he does.

142
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,341
But here's, okay--

143
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,844
Let's maybe not look at how
everybody else is dressed.

144
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:27,480
No, listen, it's all
gonna work out, okay?

145
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:28,549
And we're gonna be
roommates next year.

146
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,483
We just have to do this.

147
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:31,686
It's gonna be great.

148
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,921
I swear I have a plan
and it's gonna be

149
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,523
so quick, and then
we can leave.

150
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,992
You're so good at
being so manipulative.

151
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:45,800
Nope.

152
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,034
No, no, no, please, please.

153
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,269
-Eden.
-Yeah.

154
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,837
We're just gonna be here
for like five minutes.

155
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,671
Okay?

156
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:51,639
This will be so fast.

157
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:52,506
Hey, yo.

158
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:56,143
Phones go in the box.

159
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:57,545
Why?

160
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,848
Congressman
Schroder lives here.

161
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,583
You really think we'd
be throwing a party?

162
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,152
Here, I'll just, can you put
your phone in there, please?

163
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:06,887
You coming in or not?

164
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,689
I hate you.

165
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:09,757
We're gonna get
them back, right?

166
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,593
After the party, smart girls.

167
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:14,562
Oh, hey.

168
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,163
Okay.

169
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,167
I hate it here.

170
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:08,849
Let's go.

171
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,053
Okay, I need you to go
get Gooch off the table.

172
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,120
-What?
-Yes.

173
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:14,355
No, Gooch?

174
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,157
He's like a horny
trust fund baby.

175
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,358
Listen, the sooner you do this,

176
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,794
the sooner we can
go home, okay?

177
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,228
-You promise?
-I promise.

178
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:22,129
Please?

179
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:23,330
-Okay.
-Okay.

180
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,001
You got it.

181
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,669
All right.

182
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,838
-It's going right in.
-Sup.

183
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,078
Hi.

184
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:37,945
Hi.

185
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,149
Yeah, okay.

186
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:43,017
So um...

187
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,755
Do you wanna make me
a drink or something?

188
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,925
-What do I do?
-Go.

189
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:55,329
Yeah.

190
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,263
Yeah.

191
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,032
-Totally.
-Great, okay.

192
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,802
Alright, I guess it's just
me against you two.

193
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:05,239
Whoa, looks like you
could use a partner.

194
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:08,843
Un-fucking-believable.

195
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:17,151
So, you play the cello, right?

196
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,388
It's called an oboe.

197
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,757
What the fuck do
you do with an oboe?

198
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:26,060
Get a full ride to Penbrook.

199
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,728
What?!

200
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:28,563
Wow!

201
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:30,331
Well, I realize
that it's the least

202
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,867
competitive scholarship
for ivy league schools.

203
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,803
And nobody, obviously,
plays the oboe, so.

204
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,772
But now you're like going
for free though, right?

205
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,708
-Yeah.
-It's like...

206
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,245
Really fucking smart.

207
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,412
I am fucking smart.

208
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,783
Only way I'm getting into
college is if my dad donates

209
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:53,754
like a million dollars,
which is not gonna happen.

210
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,425
'Cause he calls me
his little fuck-up.

211
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:05,432
So what are you making
over there, hmm?

212
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:06,535
Yes, this.

213
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:10,938
It is a gift for your
tongue, for your taste buds.

214
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,340
Sorry, I'm sorry.

215
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:15,709
For you.

216
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,083
Oh fuck.

217
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,752
-Good fuck?
-Yeah, actually.

218
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,720
Actually It's
like really good.

219
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,322
-You like it?
-Yeah.

220
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,091
Is this gonna get me
fucked up, though?

221
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:34,795
Have you
seen my sister?

222
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,865
Has anybody see my sister?!

223
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,900
Did you see her?

224
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,802
-You're a liar.
-I just told you I didn't.

225
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,270
You're all liars!

226
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:58,052
-Is that Melissa's sister?
-You know where she is?

227
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:58,886
Yeah.

228
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:02,957
What about you?

229
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,393
Have you seen my sister?

230
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,362
This is not a
good luck, sweetie.

231
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,764
-My god, shut up.
-Oh, fuck!

232
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,032
Hey, all right, all right.

233
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,467
Come on, it's a party!

234
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,269
Get her outta here.

235
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,204
No, get your hands off me.

236
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,552
One of you knows something.

237
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,419
I'm not leaving here
until I find out

238
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:36,190
-where the fuck my sister is!
-That didn't fucking work.

239
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,157
You got that?!

240
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,392
-Yo.
-No, no, don't touch me.

241
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,160
Just go take care
of this bitch okay?

242
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,463
I'll drive her home.

243
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,098
I'll take her home.

244
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,935
It's in the garage.

245
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:48,802
Okay.

246
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:49,903
I'll be back.

247
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,509
You okay?

248
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:55,342
Mm-hmm.

249
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,052
Tanya, you're home.

250
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,132
My sister used to do this.

251
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:26,140
Tanya.

252
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:29,843
-Are you okay, honey?
-I'm fine, Dad.

253
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,879
Let's just get you
in the house.

254
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,415
-Look, I was worried to death.
-I'm okay.

255
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,936
Jesus.

256
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,840
Thinking
of stealing it?

257
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:12,986
Let me show you something.

258
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:16,558
That's what I gotta live up to.

259
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,661
If I don't become
president, I'll basically

260
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:22,162
be considered a fuck-up.

261
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,099
Well, just become
president then, right?

262
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,900
Can't be that hard.

263
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,504
Okay.

264
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,575
Ah, you're killing me.

265
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:34,875
Killing me.

266
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,314
When my family
first landed here,

267
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,583
a native chief gave that to my

268
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:44,118
great-great-great grandfather.

269
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,089
Right.

270
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:55,563
See this?

271
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,336
My great grandfather stole
this from a German soldier

272
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,539
he killed in World War II.

273
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:06,608
Still works.

274
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,577
Wanna hold it?

275
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:13,981
Schroder, so, you know,
speaking of your family.

276
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:15,784
Mm-hmm.

277
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:20,220
What do you think about
introducing me to your dad?

278
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,625
My dad?

279
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,063
You're really determined
to use me, aren't you?

280
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:36,638
Hmm.

281
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,111
What's your pitch?

282
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,384
Penbrook has been
my dream school

283
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,120
for as long as I can remember,

284
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:55,989
and not a single other
person in my family

285
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,525
has gone to college.

286
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,493
I mean, I've had no help.

287
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:00,728
I don't come from money.

288
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:02,996
I haven't had any tutors.

289
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:04,666
I couldn't afford SAT prep.

290
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:09,002
I mean, Schroder, I
have done all of this

291
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,038
completely on my own,
and I'm just wait-listed.

292
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,105
And if I could just
talk to your dad.

293
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,313
That's wonderful.

294
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,082
But it's also a lie.

295
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:26,019
You said you've done it
completely on your own,

296
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,155
If I did hear correctly,
and that's not true.

297
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,525
'cause now you need my help.

298
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:33,795
If I could just
talk to your dad.

299
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,555
Where are you going?

300
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:03,023
We're still on the
table, partner.

301
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,129
All right, you guys
ready to get fucked?

302
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,197
All day, bro.

303
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,533
All day, let's go.

304
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,067
Don't miss, no pressure.

305
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,469
Oh!

306
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,137
Okay, okay.

307
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,706
Hey, you got it, you got it.

308
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,841
All right.

309
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,174
All you, bro.

310
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,443
Well, you know, it was...

311
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,218
Fuck your fucking game.

312
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,654
- Demon little whores.
- Okay.

313
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:33,755
Ok, Zara, jeez.

314
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:35,222
-Hey!
-Hey.

315
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,123
Hey, what's up?

316
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,124
Are you drunk?

317
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,293
No.

318
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:42,229
I just had a little one.

319
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,363
Hey, Eden?

320
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,232
Can we go home now?

321
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,201
Yes, we are gonna
go home so soon.

322
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,537
People are gross here.

323
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:51,338
They are, I know.

324
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,641
Can we pause the game
for just two minutes?

325
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:55,142
-Two minutes.
-You look naked!

326
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,243
-Come on.
-All right.

327
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,144
You got two minutes.

328
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,211
Otherwise I'm getting
another partner.

329
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,781
Okay, that's fine.

330
00:17:59,814 --> 00:18:01,248
Okay, I'll be right there.

331
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,316
Bye.

332
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:05,753
Joel, I'm coming for you.

333
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:06,888
- No, no, no.
- What?

334
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:09,156
No, we're just gonna
take a nap really fast.

335
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,290
Up here?

336
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:11,693
And then we're
gonna go home.

337
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:12,860
Yeah?

338
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:14,796
-Oh, look at those douches.
-Okay.

339
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:16,864
-Douche!
-Oh, God, Zara.

340
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:18,600
-Douche!
-No, Zara.

341
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:19,433
You're good.

342
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,435
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

343
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,437
-He's looking at me.
-Okay, come here.

344
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,739
Give me your hand.

345
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:27,642
-Woman, give me your hand.
-Okay, okay.

346
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:29,677
Come on.

347
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,311
-Ooh.
-Come on.

348
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,479
Watch yourself.

349
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:33,748
Steps, one, two.

350
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:34,849
There you go.

351
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,121
How did
you get your phones?

352
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:44,692
Zara.

353
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:45,560
Come on.

354
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,463
Let's get you to bed.

355
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:54,602
I don't want a roommate
who eats my toothbrush.

356
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,704
I want you.

357
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:59,306
I know, that's what
I'm working on, okay?

358
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,340
-Okay.
-Okay.

359
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:01,809
-Eden?
-Yeah.

360
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:03,276
I love you.

361
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,211
Love you.

362
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,880
Just gonna rest a little bit.

363
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,815
-You're my best friend.
-You're my best friend.

364
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:08,950
I'll be back.

365
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:11,819
-Forever and ever.
-I know.

366
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:12,687
Love you.

367
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,155
Love you.

368
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:32,239
Oh, there we go, there we go.

369
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,508
-Yeah.
-Great.

370
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,244
You gonna drink that?

371
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:37,912
Oh.

372
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:00,568
Let's go.

373
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:03,270
Let's go!

374
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:05,940
Fuck yeah, bro.

375
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,743
Make this cup, I'll
make sure my dad

376
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:11,512
writes you that
recommendation letter.

377
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:13,246
Really?

378
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,881
Okay, okay.

379
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:14,916
Shake on it.

380
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:25,727
Okay.

381
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,669
Yes!

382
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:36,436
Deal's a deal.

383
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,672
Deal's a deal.

384
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:38,639
You're killing me.

385
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,575
-You're killing me.
-Yes.

386
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:45,613
Okay, I'm gonna go check on
my friend, no take-backs!

387
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:56,289
Hey, guys.

388
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:02,395
Just chilling with my
girl, we're cuddling.

389
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,375
Zara, wake up.

390
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:17,444
What are you doing in here?

391
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:18,613
Nothing.

392
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:19,947
I was making sure she was okay.

393
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:22,449
-Okay, Gooch, leave.
-Yeah.

394
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:23,483
-Yeah.
-Get out!

395
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:24,986
I'm going. I'm sorry.

396
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,020
Hey, Zara?

397
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,356
Hey.

398
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:30,892
Zara, you need to wake up.

399
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:32,492
Zara!

400
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:33,326
No.

401
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:40,835
Hey, Zara.

402
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,851
Oh, hey,
can I come back--

403
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:58,052
No, Gooch, please.

404
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:59,452
Leave, get out.

405
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:00,487
Get out!

406
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:18,105
<i>Pass her back,</i>
<i>come on, pass her back.</i>

407
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:19,740
<i>Share the wealth,</i>
<i>share the wealth.</i>

408
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:23,811
<i>You recognize her?</i>

409
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:24,411
<i>- You recognize her?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

410
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:24,946
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-Who?</i>

411
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,346
<i>Hey.</i>

412
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:28,783
<i>Melissa, right?</i>

413
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:30,450
<i>Come on, shy girl, hang</i>
<i>out with us, come on.</i>

414
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,721
<i>Come on. Hey, we're</i>
<i>cool with that.</i>

415
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:35,089
<i>I'll open the door for you.</i>

416
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,858
[Melis <i>...just go</i>
<i>home now, right?</i>

417
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:38,526
<i>We got you.</i>

418
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,459
<i>Hey.</i>

419
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:40,628
<i>I just wanna go home now, okay?</i>

420
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:42,897
<i>Yeah, going home, yeah,</i>
<i>well, we gotta make</i>

421
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,165
<i>a couple stops first, but yeah.</i>

422
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,133
<i>- What's with the phone?</i>
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

423
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,335
<i>Just like, ignore him.</i>

424
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,570
<i>Look, we're gonna</i>
<i>get you home safe.</i>

425
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:50,605
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-I promise.</i>

426
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:51,672
<i>Promise, all right?</i>

427
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:53,541
<i>We're the coolest people</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

428
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:15,930
<i>What is that?</i>

429
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:19,100
<i>Can you</i>
<i>stop filming me?</i>

430
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,433
<i>Yeah.</i>

431
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,470
- <i>It's a heart.</i>
<i>- A heart?</i>

432
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:28,441
<i>Yes!</i>

433
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,143
<i>Oh!</i>

434
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:33,114
<i>Melissa, this one's yours.</i>

435
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,151
<i>Y'all ready to roll?</i>

436
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:38,519
<i>Y'all ready to go?</i>

437
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,121
<i>Go, go where?</i>

438
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:41,589
<i>We ain't going home.</i>

439
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:45,559
<i>You all right?</i>

440
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:47,595
<i>I just started.</i>

441
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:04,545
<i>- Whoa!</i>
<i>- Shit!</i>

442
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:10,051
<i>You all right?</i>

443
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:11,652
<i>Can I go home?</i>

444
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:13,154
<i>Oh, that's not</i>
<i>my call, sorry.</i>

445
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:14,989
<i>To the coolest</i>
<i>people in school.</i>

446
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:17,792
<i>The coolest, the coolest.</i>

447
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:19,994
<i>Why the fuck did you</i>
<i>throw that out?</i>

448
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:21,963
<i>You wanna go home?</i>

449
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:24,497
<i>You're not going</i>
<i>fucking home, okay?</i>

450
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:32,206
- <i>Just gonna go.</i>
<i>- Oh, you're gonna go?</i>

451
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,473
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Why are you going?</i>

452
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:35,009
<i>Why would you not</i>
<i>wanna hang out with us?</i>

453
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:39,747
<i>Get in the car.</i>

454
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:42,383
<i>Get in the car.</i>

455
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,552
<i>We gotta take her home, so</i>
<i>we're gonna go take her home.</i>

456
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,654
<i>Get in the car.</i>

457
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:02,870
Oh, shit.

458
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:03,738
Shit.

459
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,073
Hey, Zara.

460
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,744
Hey, Zara, I need
you to get up.

461
00:25:09,777 --> 00:25:12,580
I need you to get up and help
me find a charger, please?

462
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:13,647
Zara.

463
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:34,835
-Hey.
-Hey.

464
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:38,572
Mind if we come in?

465
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,741
Zara actually
isn't feeling good,

466
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:43,244
so I don't think she'd like
people to see her like this.

467
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:44,678
Right.

468
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:45,346
Yeah.

469
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:50,351
Well, Gooch forgot something,

470
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,653
so if we could just come in.

471
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:53,854
What'd you forget, Gooch?

472
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,624
Like, I left in...

473
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:01,862
His phone.

474
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,230
He left
his phone in there.

475
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:04,698
Just trying to get it.

476
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:06,367
Got it, okay.

477
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,768
I actually think I saw it.

478
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:08,769
I'll just grab
it really quick.

479
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:09,470
No, that's fine.

480
00:26:09,504 --> 00:26:10,271
No, I'll bring it to you guys.

481
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,138
It's fine.

482
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:18,846
She locked the door.

483
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:30,991
Shit, shit, shit!

484
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:32,726
Will you calm down?

485
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,228
It's not like she's
got the passcode.

486
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:48,809
I don't have a passcode.

487
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:50,144
What the hell is
wrong with you?

488
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:51,645
You're fucking killing me.

489
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,947
I kept forgetting it, guys.

490
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,217
Who the fuck doesn't
have a passcode?

491
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,259
Eden.

492
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:08,195
You okay in there?

493
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,298
Yeah, yeah, I'm
just helping Zara.

494
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:12,967
Sorry, just gimme a second.

495
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,737
How about I come in there
and grab the phone, okay?

496
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,807
Schroder, do your parents
have a charger in here?

497
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:32,720
Did the phone die or something?

498
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:34,088
I just wanna charge
it up so I can

499
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:35,856
call my dad to
come pick us up.

500
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,757
Yes.

501
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,360
Yes, I think that's
a wonderful idea.

502
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:41,095
Come on out, we'll
give you your phone

503
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:43,197
so you can call your dad.

504
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,966
I don't wanna leave
Zara in here by herself,

505
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,301
so why don't you just

506
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,370
give me the phone charger
under the door.

507
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:51,972
I can help.
Let me help.

508
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,841
-I can help.
-No.

509
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:56,143
I think you've done enough.

510
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:00,915
Yeah, that'd be a little
weird though, right?

511
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:03,017
To give you a charger
when you could just

512
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,419
come out here and
get your phone.

513
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:06,754
Schroder, I saw the video.

514
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:17,731
What?

515
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:18,799
Stop.

516
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,834
Stop.

517
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:23,737
Come on now.

518
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:27,741
Mm.

519
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:28,409
What, uh...

520
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:30,377
What video?

521
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:34,481
I saw you with
Melissa on Friday.

522
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:37,184
I thought you said
the phone died.

523
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:38,419
It did.

524
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:39,787
So you didn't see
the whole video.

525
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,789
I saw enough of it.

526
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,792
Schroder, where is she?

527
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,864
The last time that
we saw Melissa Brown

528
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:55,869
is when we dropped
her off at her house.

529
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,137
I swear to God.

530
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,942
Okay, if that's the truth,
then give me a charger

531
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:03,143
and let me finish
watching the video.

532
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:06,213
I'm not sliding a charger
under the door, even though--

533
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:08,849
I'm not leaving this
room until you give me

534
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:11,553
a charger and I finish
watching the video.

535
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:14,355
I think you're gonna think
this is all really silly

536
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:16,790
once you see this video.

537
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:18,892
Why don't you come on out?

538
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:22,396
Charge up the phone,
give you your phone,

539
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:27,034
and then we'll all watch
the video together, okay?

540
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:28,235
How does that sound, Eden?

541
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:29,403
Is that good for you?

542
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:30,804
You wanna be reasonable,
give me a charger

543
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:35,009
in the next 30 seconds
or I'm gonna scream.

544
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:35,876
30.

545
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:38,846
29.

546
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:41,015
-What we fucking doing, man?
-28.

547
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:41,882
27!

548
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:44,385
26.

549
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:47,921
25.

550
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:50,257
24!

551
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:53,260
23.

552
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:55,796
22.

553
00:29:57,331 --> 00:29:58,600
21.

554
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:10,044
Everyone!

555
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:11,513
Get the fuck out!

556
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:14,915
Get the fuck outta my house!

557
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:22,990
Zara.

558
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:24,958
Zara, come on, I
need you to wake up.

559
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,960
Please, Zara, please wake up.

560
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:27,895
Get the fuck outta here!

561
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:30,097
Get the fuck out of my house!

562
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,601
Zara, come on.

563
00:30:33,635 --> 00:30:35,903
Come on, I need you to wake up.

564
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:50,984
-Get outta here!
-Shit!

565
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,654
Go on, get out!

566
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:53,887
Go on, come on!

567
00:30:56,658 --> 00:31:00,662
Wait!
Wait!

568
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:02,329
Hey, please wait!

569
00:31:02,363 --> 00:31:03,964
Hey!

570
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:04,898
Wait, wait!

571
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,000
No!

572
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:38,600
Schroder?

573
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,034
Schroder?

574
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:51,579
Schroder?

575
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,265
No.

576
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:36,450
Fuck!

577
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:50,197
She broke my
fucking nose, man!

578
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,131
Hey.

579
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:53,768
Keep your
fucking voice down.

580
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:57,605
Look what you've done.

581
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:00,040
Look what you've done, Gooch.

582
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,176
Go downstairs.

583
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,612
Get cleaned up, now.

584
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:09,082
'Cause you wanna help, right?

585
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:10,685
You wanna help?

586
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,654
Then fucking go!

587
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:13,521
Now!

588
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:21,529
Don't get blood on my carpet.

589
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,212
Fuck.

590
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:12,847
Is this really
your smartest idea?

591
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,181
Good point.

592
00:35:15,248 --> 00:35:15,883
You do it.

593
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:18,285
No way.

594
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:20,287
I hurt my shoulder, I'm done.

595
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,288
Oh, Kendra,

596
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:24,592
you'd like, perpetrate
this door like so easy.

597
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:29,262
Of course I could.

598
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,766
But I'm not risking my athletic
career for this bullshit.

599
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:33,400
Athletic career?

600
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:36,203
Let's be clear on
something, all right?

601
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:39,473
No one's gonna remember shit
about either one of you two

602
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:41,408
if they see this video.

603
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,481
If they see this video, it's
fucking over, all right?

604
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:50,518
Get up and knock this
fucking door down.

605
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:54,154
No, man, I'm pretty
fucked up, I can't.

606
00:35:57,692 --> 00:36:01,729
I want you to think about
your father's face...

607
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,702
When he finds out that
you're part of all of this.

608
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:11,371
Think about how disappointed

609
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:14,709
he's going to be
when he realizes

610
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:15,877
he was right.

611
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:17,612
Oh.

612
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:24,384
You're exactly the fuck-up
he always thought you'd be.

613
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:48,442
I'm fucking empty, dude.

614
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:55,348
Move out the way.

615
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:09,030
Get up, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

616
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:09,864
Get up, get up, get up.

617
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:10,665
Listen.

618
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:11,933
Look at me, look
at me, look at me.

619
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,034
I need you to go
around, all right?

620
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:16,037
I need you to get the ladder
and get the phone, okay?

621
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:16,738
All right?

622
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:17,905
I need you to do this for me.

623
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:18,740
I need you.

624
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:19,807
I need <i>you.</i>

625
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,374
Make me proud, all right?

626
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:22,510
Come on.

627
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:23,443
You good?

628
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:24,444
-You good?
-Yeah.

629
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:25,880
I believe in you.

630
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,280
Get that shit.

631
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:48,169
Eden!

632
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:49,871
Yo, Eden, what
the fuck is this?

633
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:51,806
Hey, Schroder?

634
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,373
Schroder!

635
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:55,643
I would stop banging
on that, dude, like,

636
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:57,277
this thing looks
really expensive.

637
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:59,747
-What the fuck!
-Fuck!

638
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:02,382
Zara, Zara.

639
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:03,383
Thank God you're awake.

640
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:04,819
I don't feel so good.

641
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:06,954
Zara, get up, get
up, come help me, please.

642
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:08,823
Zara, please get up.

643
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:10,691
Zara, get the fuck up!

644
00:38:26,674 --> 00:38:28,009
Oh, shit, man!

645
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,511
God dammit, that
thing's too heavy.

646
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:31,546
We're not getting in.

647
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:32,947
We're not trying to get in.

648
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:52,767
Gooch, what are you
doing out there?

649
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,634
Okay.

650
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:04,078
Hey, Zara.

651
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:04,946
Hey.

652
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:07,615
Hey.

653
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:09,550
I threw up, don't--

654
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:11,719
-You what?
-I threw up.

655
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:12,653
Your drink.

656
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,490
Here, sit down, sit down.

657
00:39:18,726 --> 00:39:19,560
Okay.

658
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:22,362
Oh.

659
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,167
You okay?

660
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,536
-What happened?
-Why are you here?

661
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:31,873
I gotta do something.

662
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:33,875
Just say hi to
Eden really fast.

663
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:34,709
Okay?

664
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:36,409
Oh yeah, okay.

665
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:37,745
You go and rest.

666
00:39:37,778 --> 00:39:39,046
Oh, why?

667
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,016
Ok,
ok, stop! Shroder!

668
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:44,886
It'll be okay.

669
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:52,560
I will be right back.

670
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:53,527
Okay.

671
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:55,696
Eden!

672
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:04,572
Hey, Eden.

673
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:07,508
- Look.
- Let us in!

674
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:11,712
I'm really sorry
about all this.

675
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:12,847
Just please gimme
the phone back.

676
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,149
How'd you get it here?

677
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:17,484
I don't want anyone
else to get hurt, okay?

678
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:19,452
- Please give the phone back.
- No.

679
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:20,788
- And all this can be over.
- No.

680
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:22,723
- Come on, Eden.
- No.

681
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:24,592
Give the fucking phone back!

682
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:25,660
-Stay the fuck away.
-Come on!

683
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:26,894
-Stay back!
-Give me it back!

684
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:29,496
Fuck!

685
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,932
Fucking phone.

686
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:32,499
Just give me back
the fucking phone

687
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:34,635
and this can all be over!

688
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:35,836
Where is it, Eden?!

689
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,171
Gooch?

690
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:38,639
What are you doing?

691
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:39,740
She won't gimme back my phone.

692
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:41,208
Zara.

693
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:43,744
You mean this phone?

694
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:45,079
Get it.

695
00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:49,784
Shroder, I got it,
I got the phone!

696
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,087
Let go!

697
00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:55,089
Let go! Shroder!

698
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:56,857
Oh, you
crazy fucking bitch!

699
00:40:58,491 --> 00:40:59,627
Oh, she's
got the phone!

700
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:02,129
Fuck you.

701
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:05,533
Fucking bitch.

702
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,638
Fucking bitch!

703
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:20,514
What now, hmm?

704
00:41:35,863 --> 00:41:38,132
Let's fucking go.

705
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:49,010
Oh hey, are you kids with
that party over on Northgate?

706
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:50,544
My daughter's there too,
I was just wondering

707
00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:51,846
if it's still going on?

708
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:54,015
Nah, got broken
up, it's fucking lame.

709
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:55,750
Yeah, super boring.

710
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:07,194
Aww, shit, let's fucking go.

711
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:10,731
Let's
fucking go. This...

712
00:42:10,765 --> 00:42:12,133
This is what I'm
talking about.

713
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,134
Zara,
Zara, come here.

714
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,135
I need you, I need you
to help me get his arms.

715
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:15,069
- What?
- Help me get his arms.

716
00:42:15,102 --> 00:42:18,005
- Help me get his arms!
- Oh yeah!

717
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:19,607
Here we go. Fuck yes!

718
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:21,642
Woo!

719
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,746
What the
hell's going on?

720
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,886
Fucking door down!

721
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:37,058
Get him in the bathroom.

722
00:42:47,835 --> 00:42:48,669
Shit.

723
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:52,640
Let's go.

724
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:53,674
Let's go!

725
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:57,011
Get him in the bathtub.

726
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:58,579
Go ahead, go ahead.

727
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:12,726
Hey, Schroder.

728
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:17,031
Fuck!

729
00:43:19,934 --> 00:43:21,102
What now, hmm?

730
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:24,539
Eden!

731
00:43:27,908 --> 00:43:30,277
Eden, what are we doing?

732
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:32,646
- Yes, okay.
- Eden, stop, stop!

733
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,415
-What the fuck?
-Come help me.

734
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:35,883
Do what?

735
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:40,888
That looked expensive.

736
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:42,289
No shit. Come here.

737
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:44,658
Hey.

738
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:46,160
What are you doing?

739
00:43:46,193 --> 00:43:48,362
What does it
fucking look like?

740
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:49,296
-No.
-What?

741
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,398
You can't get a new door?

742
00:43:53,033 --> 00:43:56,103
I don't want to spend my whole
weekend shopping for doors.

743
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:21,061
Let's make a deal, Eden.

744
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:25,166
Give me the phone
and I'll let you leave.

745
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,133
How's that?

746
00:44:30,804 --> 00:44:31,939
Get up.

747
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:34,942
What the fuck?

748
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:37,811
What's going on
in there, Gooch?

749
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:39,380
Uh...

750
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:44,351
So, I'm in a tub and
she's got a hair dryer and...

751
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:47,855
Fuck, man, I think they're
gonna electrocute me!

752
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:49,658
Okay.

753
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:52,993
Let's think
on this, okay?

754
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:54,828
Let's breathe.

755
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:56,230
Let's calm down.

756
00:44:56,263 --> 00:44:58,199
No, dude, no, please,
please, please.

757
00:44:58,232 --> 00:45:00,367
Just get outta
here, guys, help me.

758
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,472
Are you seriously
crying right now?

759
00:45:05,507 --> 00:45:06,307
Shut up.

760
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,742
Hey,
you're not a killer.

761
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:09,810
Okay?

762
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:13,347
You're just a scholarship kid--

763
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,982
Get the
fucking phone, Kendra!

764
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:16,183
Fine.

765
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:17,051
Yes.

766
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:20,387
I'm sending Kendra now.

767
00:45:20,421 --> 00:45:24,358
Let's just not do
anything stupid, okay?

768
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:27,861
We don't want
anyone getting hurt.

769
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,064
Kendra, hurry!

770
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:34,101
Eden, stop.

771
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:36,370
Fine. It's fine, it's
fine, it's fine.

772
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:37,805
It's not fucking fine!

773
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:39,440
-It's not fucking fine!
-It's gonna be fine.

774
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:40,474
What the fuck?

775
00:45:40,508 --> 00:45:41,842
Dude, we're not killers.

776
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:42,910
We're not fucking killers.

777
00:45:42,943 --> 00:45:44,211
What the fuck are you doing?

778
00:45:44,245 --> 00:45:45,913
We need to get the fuck
out of this bathroom.

779
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:47,047
How are we gonna get the
fuck outta this bathroom?

780
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:48,115
We're gonna figure it out.

781
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:52,353
I just
wanted to take her home.

782
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:54,922
I told Shroder but he
doesn't listen to me.

783
00:45:56,257 --> 00:45:58,359
Listen, I need you
to tell me where she is.

784
00:45:58,392 --> 00:45:59,393
He's never listened to me.

785
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:02,329
I need you to
tell me where Melissa is.

786
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:03,197
Wait.

787
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:05,399
This was all about Melissa?

788
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:13,107
If you want get out of this,

789
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,543
you have to give
him what he wants.

790
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:19,847
Just give him the phone back
and this can all be over.

791
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:24,018
How did he get in here?

792
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:28,322
He came in through the window.

793
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,925
Okay, okay, the window.

794
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,093
The window.

795
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:33,894
We're gonna go
through the window.

796
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:34,928
-What?!
-Okay.

797
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:35,796
No, no, no, no.

798
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:36,897
I need you to go
through the window.

799
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:37,965
Are you serious?

800
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:38,999
No way is that safe.

801
00:46:39,033 --> 00:46:40,267
What if it slips?

802
00:46:40,301 --> 00:46:42,002
Do you wanna get
asked instead, Zara?

803
00:46:42,036 --> 00:46:44,539
That's our only option.

804
00:46:44,572 --> 00:46:46,940
Listen to me,
listen to me, okay?

805
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:48,842

00:46:51,646 --> 00:46:52,980

808
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:55,215

809
00:46:57,318 --> 00:46:58,252
Fuck!

810
00:46:59,587 --> 00:47:02,557
They cut the power.
They cut the power.

811
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,891
Zara, please.

812
00:47:03,924 --> 00:47:04,925
Please, please, will you please

814
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:08,162
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

815
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:10,364
Okay.

816
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:12,032
Help me, Zara.

817
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:13,334
Help me please.

818
00:47:24,044 --> 00:47:24,945
Oh god, I can't.

819
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:26,080
Yes you can, yes you can.

820
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:27,515
I'll be right behind you.

821
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:29,584
I need you to go down, I'm
gonna be right behind you, okay?

822
00:47:29,617 --> 00:47:30,585
God, I can't.

823
00:47:30,618 --> 00:47:31,985
I'll be right behind you.

824
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:32,986
-I'm sorry.
-I need you to go.

825
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,887
-Okay.
-Okay.

826
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:49,203
Oh my god.

Oh my god.

828
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:18,533
Zara, look at me, look at me.

00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:19,933
It's okay, okay?

830
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,402
I need you to go.

831
00:48:21,435 --> 00:48:22,936

832
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:23,937

00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:27,241
Okay.

Zara.

837
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,920
I'm so sorry.

838
00:48:42,055 --> 00:48:45,025
You believe me right?

839
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:45,693
Right?

840
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:49,363
Gooch!

841
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:52,065

842
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,368
-Status update, now!
-Get out.

843
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:55,737

00:48:58,172 --> 00:48:59,940
Go. Get out right now.

846
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:04,044
Gooch!

847
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:07,047
Kendra fell, they're

848
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:11,653
Zara, come on!

849
00:49:14,689 --> 00:49:15,523
Oh.

Please help, please help.

852
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:31,238
I'm really hurt.

00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:33,140
- Hey, do you have a phone?
- I'm really hurt!

854
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:34,642
Do you have a phone?

855
00:49:36,243 --> 00:49:40,582
I'm sorry, sorry.

856
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:41,415
Hey, hey.

00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:42,784
Hey, what's your code?

858
00:49:42,817 --> 00:49:45,152
What's your passcode?

00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:47,321
Five-eight, oh-two

860
00:49:55,563 --> 00:49:58,198
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

861
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:01,736
Eden, I can't, I'm

862
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:15,215
Eden!

00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:43,110
Where you going?

866
00:50:43,143 --> 00:50:44,111
We're going the wrong way.

867
00:50:44,144 --> 00:50:46,213
You're going the, fuck, oh god.

868
00:50:46,246 --> 00:50:47,549
No, no, no, no.

Schroder.

870
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:57,491
Get my phone. Get my phone.

871
00:50:57,525 --> 00:50:59,259
-No.
-We gotta call someone.

872
00:50:59,293 --> 00:50:59,894
We're not getting your phone.

873
00:50:59,928 --> 00:51:01,128
We're not calling anyone.

874
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:02,864
We're not calling anyone until
we can Gooch's phone, okay?

875
00:51:02,897 --> 00:51:04,799
Fuck the phone, man!

876
00:51:04,832 --> 00:51:06,266
Do you see me?

877
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,168
-You fucking see me?
-Shh.

878
00:51:08,201 --> 00:51:08,803
Okay, look--

I'm gonna fucking die.

880
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:13,541
Here, here.

881
00:51:13,575 --> 00:51:15,710
That's not gonna do shit.

882
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:17,645
No, hold it there,
hold it there.

883
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:18,211
I'm gonna die.

884
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,479
You're not gonna die.

885
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:21,049
I don't
want your pills.

886
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:22,182
You're
in a lot of pain,

887
00:51:22,215 --> 00:51:23,150
this is gonna help you, okay?

888
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:24,284
I don't want

00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:38,298
Look at me.

893
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:40,400
I'm gonna die.

894
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:43,905
After all we've been through
you can't leave me like this.

895
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:46,273
You can't leave me like
this, you're my best friend.

896
00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:47,107
Please.

897
00:51:48,342 --> 00:51:51,244
-Stop fucking crying, okay!
-Fuck off!

00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:52,279
Oh, shit!

00:51:58,686 --> 00:52:00,220
Fuck!

900
00:52:00,253 --> 00:52:02,189
You can't
leave me, man.

901
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:03,691
I'm gonna die.

902
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:19,807
You're my best friend, man.

903
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:24,211
I have to get that phone.

904
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:26,213
No, fuck the phone.

905
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:28,716
No, no.

906
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,519
Oh, fuck.

907
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:33,554
You can't leave me, you can't.

908
00:52:33,588 --> 00:52:35,222
No, Schro, Schro!

909
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:42,162
Best friend.

910
00:52:44,464 --> 00:52:46,333
And then the phone died.

911
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:52,674
So all you saw was Melissa
getting in Schroder's car.

912
00:52:52,707 --> 00:52:55,510
Zara, are you not listening?

913
00:52:55,543 --> 00:52:58,613
They were with her the
night that she disappeared.

914
00:52:58,646 --> 00:52:59,279
So?

915
00:52:59,312 --> 00:53:01,983
That doesn't prove anything.

916
00:53:02,016 --> 00:53:03,618
It proves that they
lied to the cops

917
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:05,953
and that they
know where she is.

918
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:07,254
You don't know that for sure.

919
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:08,321
My god.

920
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:11,559
-Are you serious?
-Look.

921
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:13,326
If this is what
you think it is,

922
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,429
we're not getting out until
we give them that phone.

923
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:16,664
I know.

924
00:53:16,698 --> 00:53:18,265
That's why this is
going to the police.

925
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:20,802
No, we have to give
it back to them.

926
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:22,537
Look, we can tell
the police ourselves,

927
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:25,573
but right now we need to
get the fuck out of here.

928
00:53:25,606 --> 00:53:28,543
Zara, his dad is
a congressman.

929
00:53:28,576 --> 00:53:29,577
So?

930
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,444
So?

931
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:34,015
Can you think about
that, for a second?

932
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:34,949
Who are we?

933
00:53:36,117 --> 00:53:39,721
You really think anyone's
gonna believe us over them?

934
00:53:39,754 --> 00:53:42,322
This is the only chance
we have to help find her.

935
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:43,825
We have to take
this to the police.

936
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:44,692
Eden.

937
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,294
Give me the phone.

938
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:53,568
Give me the phone.

939
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:57,572
No.

940
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:00,942
-No!
-Give me the phone!

941
00:54:00,975 --> 00:54:02,442
-Zara!
-Give me the phone!

942
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:03,376
Zara!

943
00:54:59,534 --> 00:55:00,333
Hello?

944
00:55:03,604 --> 00:55:04,972
-Zara.
-Let go!

945
00:55:05,006 --> 00:55:06,073
Fuck, Zara.

946
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:07,909
No!

947
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:08,743
Zara.

948
00:55:08,776 --> 00:55:09,610
Ow!

949
00:55:21,756 --> 00:55:22,590
Eden?

950
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,459
Please, Zara!

951
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:27,862
Eden, stop!

952
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,438
Give it to me!

953
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:52,352
Eden!

954
00:55:55,488 --> 00:55:58,425
You up there, sweetheart?

955
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,093
Fuck!

956
00:56:00,528 --> 00:56:01,361
Please.

957
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:04,397
Zara, please, that is
the only proof we have.

958
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,067
I don't care about proof.

959
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,434
I wanna go home!

960
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:09,904
Eden?

961
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:15,509
Dad?

962
00:56:17,011 --> 00:56:18,445
Is that you, sweetheart?

963
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:20,681
Oh my god, Dad, what
are you doing here?

964
00:56:20,715 --> 00:56:22,750
What the hell happened here?

965
00:56:25,452 --> 00:56:26,453
No!

966
00:56:26,486 --> 00:56:27,487
No!

967
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:28,522
Eden, run!

968
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:33,493
No!

969
00:56:36,496 --> 00:56:38,099
Get the fuck off me.

970
00:56:38,132 --> 00:56:38,966
It's over!

971
00:56:39,901 --> 00:56:42,502
Now it's my turn to count.

972
00:56:42,536 --> 00:56:45,606
You've got 10 seconds to
give me back that phone.

973
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,807
Schroder, stop!

974
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:49,744
I split your daddy's
head wide open!

975
00:56:49,777 --> 00:56:50,611
Ten!

976
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:53,547
Nine!

977
00:56:53,581 --> 00:56:56,050
Sweetheart, just give
him his phone, all right?

978
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,151
Eight!

979
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:58,719
- Stop, stop, stop!
- Seven!

980
00:56:58,753 --> 00:57:00,588
I have it, Schroder!

981
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:02,857
Bring it to me.

982
00:57:04,926 --> 00:57:05,760
Now!

983
00:57:06,627 --> 00:57:07,628
Six!

984
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:08,996
- Got it!
- Five!

985
00:57:27,915 --> 00:57:29,482
Fuck.

986
00:57:29,517 --> 00:57:30,151
You.

987
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:37,525
You know, Eden, I don't
think I'm gonna invite you

988
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:39,527
to any more of my parties.

989
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,598
Barrett Theodore Schroder.

990
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:48,936
- What's going on here?
- Dad.

991
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,672
I didn't think you were
gonna be home until Sunday.

992
00:57:51,706 --> 00:57:53,541
Well, your mother
wasn't feeling well.

993
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:55,943
You need to explain everything
that's happening now.

994
00:57:55,977 --> 00:57:56,777
Right now.

995
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:57,979
Yes.

996
00:57:58,012 --> 00:58:00,681
Well, you see, me and
some of my friends

997
00:58:00,715 --> 00:58:02,683
were just having
little get-together,

998
00:58:02,717 --> 00:58:05,753
and things got out of
hand, but I've got it all

999
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:07,588
under control now,
everything's cool,

1000
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:08,656
it's all cool,
everything's cool.

1001
00:58:08,689 --> 00:58:11,092
No, everything is definitely
not cool, young man.

1002
00:58:44,091 --> 00:58:47,328
I just think we all need
to take a deep breath.

1003
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:49,864
Are you fucking shitting me?

1004
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:01,108
It's her fault.

1005
00:59:01,142 --> 00:59:02,109
She started all of this.

1006
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:04,178
She stole Gooch's phone and...

1007
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:04,879
Her fault?

1008
00:59:04,912 --> 00:59:06,680
- Her fault?
- Yes.

1009
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:08,215
When I walked into
this mad house,

1010
00:59:08,249 --> 00:59:10,117
you were chasing my
daughter around with an ax!

1011
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:11,719
Mr. Murphy.

1012
00:59:11,752 --> 00:59:15,022
I'm happy we have this
opportunity to talk this over.

1013
00:59:15,056 --> 00:59:16,157
Talk?

1014
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,025
You better start
explaining a few things,

1015
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:20,594
or I'm gonna go talk
to the cops, all right?

1016
00:59:20,628 --> 00:59:23,764
Oh.

1017
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:24,732
Not necessary.

1018
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:27,068
How did this get so out
of control, Barrett?

1019
00:59:27,101 --> 00:59:28,302
I was just trying to
protect you, that's all.

1020
00:59:28,335 --> 00:59:30,638
I know this is a big year with
the election and everything,

1021
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:31,839
and I just didn't--

1022
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:35,376
The only person he's been
trying to protect is himself.

1023
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:37,278
I've seen the video.

1024
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:38,345
Dad, don't listen to her--

1025
00:59:38,379 --> 00:59:40,748
Did you know he has
a video on his phone?

1026
00:59:40,781 --> 00:59:41,715
Dad--

1027
00:59:41,749 --> 00:59:43,217
Of Melissa Brown being
forced into his car

1028
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,252
the night that
she disappeared?

1029
00:59:45,286 --> 00:59:46,887
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1030
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:48,756
What's this got
to do with that?

1031
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:49,990
What?

1032
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:52,326
Gooch, Gooch, come on,
talk to my parents.

1033
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:53,961
Tell them the truth.
You know what happened.

1034
00:59:53,994 --> 00:59:55,996
What happened, Schroder?

1035
00:59:56,864 --> 00:59:57,865
Tell them.

1036
00:59:58,999 --> 01:00:00,768
It is your phone, Gooch.

1037
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:01,702
Gooch?

1038
01:00:01,735 --> 01:00:02,736
Why don't you just
tell us what's on it?

1039
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:03,804
Why don't you?

1040
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:06,740
Tell them.

1041
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:09,110
Fucking tell them.

1042
01:00:11,178 --> 01:00:12,746
Fucking pussy, goddamn.

1043
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,949
Why don't you find
a charger for that?

1044
01:00:14,982 --> 01:00:17,952
Watch the video yourselves.

1045
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:20,020
Good luck getting
into Penbrook, bitch.

1046
01:00:20,054 --> 01:00:21,388
Oh, excuse me?

1047
01:00:22,323 --> 01:00:23,224
-Did you-
-Barrett.

1048
01:00:23,257 --> 01:00:24,325
Excuse me?

1049
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:25,426
Did you not hear him?

1050
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:27,795
He said, "good luck getting
into Penbrook, bitch."

1051
01:00:27,828 --> 01:00:29,964
Okay, well that's not the
way we're raising this house,

1052
01:00:29,997 --> 01:00:31,098
is it, Barrett?!

1053
01:00:31,132 --> 01:00:32,766
You respect women in this house.

1054
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,635
You have to apologize.

1055
01:00:35,803 --> 01:00:36,804
Apologize?

1056
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:38,739
For what?

1057
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:39,673
Apologize!

1058
01:00:39,707 --> 01:00:40,708
Barrett.

1059
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:42,977
I'm sorry, Mom.

1060
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:45,813
Not to me, asshole.

1061
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,818
I'm sorry, Eden.

1062
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:55,156
- Thank you.
- Un-fucking-believable.

1063
01:00:55,189 --> 01:00:56,690
Excuse me.

1064
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:57,324
So.

1065
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:00,694
What exactly did you see, Eden?

1066
01:01:00,728 --> 01:01:01,729
She didn't see shit.

1067
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:03,230
I saw enough to
know that your son

1068
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:06,300
and Gooch and Kendra are
hiding something massive.

1069
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,101
Oh.

1070
01:01:07,134 --> 01:01:08,802
Hiding
something massive.

1071
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:09,670
And uh...

1072
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:13,440
Where is Kendra?

1073
01:01:20,748 --> 01:01:21,382
Kendra.

1074
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:24,418
Kendra!

1075
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:26,787
No.

1076
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,855
Hey.

1077
01:01:31,392 --> 01:01:33,794
Son.

1078
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:34,862
What?

1079
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:39,333
-Dad?
-I'm here.

1080
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:44,872
Let's call
her an ambulance.

1081
01:01:44,905 --> 01:01:46,774
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1082
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:50,244
Need to
call an ambulance.

1083
01:01:50,277 --> 01:01:52,379
Will you
say something to your son?

1084
01:01:52,413 --> 01:01:55,282
What do you want me to say?

1085
01:01:55,316 --> 01:01:56,817
Do you want me to say
it's all gonna be okay?

1086
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,254
That this little mess
up of his is acceptable?

1087
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:01,922
Did you want me to
feel sorry for him?

1088
01:02:01,956 --> 01:02:04,158
I just want you tell
me how to fix it.

1089
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:05,459
You amaze me.

1090
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:10,130
After all these years, you
still haven't figured it out.

1091
01:02:10,164 --> 01:02:12,199
No matter what anybody says,
they're only going to do

1092
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:14,001
what's best for them.

1093
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:19,873
Not this one.

1094
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:21,842
She's different.

1095
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:23,978
Nah, you just think she is.

1096
01:02:26,113 --> 01:02:26,947
Hmm.

1097
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:05,953
Darling, thank you.

1098
01:03:07,488 --> 01:03:10,324
I'd like to begin by
apologizing to each of you

1099
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:14,028
for everything that my
son did this evening.

1100
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,232
Barrett knows better. I
don't know quite how

1101
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:20,000
everything got
so out of control.

1102
01:03:20,034 --> 01:03:22,936
That is not how our
family handles things.

1103
01:03:24,138 --> 01:03:25,139
Thank you.

1104
01:03:29,276 --> 01:03:30,911
Mr. Murphy.

1105
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:33,414
You own a a septic
tank company?

1106
01:03:34,882 --> 01:03:36,016
Yeah.

1107
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,084
Is that a good--

1108
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:38,886
well sure it is,
everybody shits.

1109
01:03:38,919 --> 01:03:42,256
Do you know, the county
is accepting bids

1110
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:44,124
for the new
municipal contracts.

1111
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:45,859
I think in order to make
amends for this evening,

1112
01:03:45,893 --> 01:03:47,227
my husband would be
more than willing

1113
01:03:47,261 --> 01:03:49,330
to talk to his
friends on the board,

1114
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:52,333
if that's something that
you would be interested in?

1115
01:03:52,366 --> 01:03:54,001
And do I understand
that you have

1116
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:55,936
a scholarship to
Penbrook in the fall?

1117
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,971
Well, that's impressive.

1118
01:03:59,306 --> 01:04:01,375
Unfortunately, a lot
of those scholarships

1119
01:04:01,408 --> 01:04:03,243
don't cover all the costs.

1120
01:04:03,277 --> 01:04:04,512
Oh.

1121
01:04:04,546 --> 01:04:06,380
Oh my husband and
I love supporting

1122
01:04:06,413 --> 01:04:08,449
underprivileged students.

1123
01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:10,284
So this might help me
feel like you're on

1124
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:13,621
a little more equal footing
with the other students

1125
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:14,823
next year.

1126
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:16,957
And that way you
can focus on your studies

1127
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:19,993
instead of all these annoying
financial distractions.

1128
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:20,961
Ah, true.

1129
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:25,933
- Oh.
- I know.

1130
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:29,937
Yeah.

1131
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:31,740
Yeah.

1132
01:04:31,773 --> 01:04:33,040
- Huh.
- Yeah.

1133
01:04:39,246 --> 01:04:41,148
You can't just buy us off.

1134
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:42,983
Oh, well. I think we just--

1135
01:04:43,016 --> 01:04:44,151
We're not doing that at all.

1136
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:45,687
The character that
you've shown tonight

1137
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,055
is just express that
you are the exact kind

1138
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:51,992
of bright young woman
that belongs at Penbrook.

1139
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:52,794
Oh, yes.

1140
01:04:52,827 --> 01:04:54,328
If you wanted to
go to that school,

1141
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:56,330
that wouldn't be
a problem at all.

1142
01:04:56,363 --> 01:04:57,998
Couple of phone calls.

1143
01:04:58,031 --> 01:05:00,334
But we would to have to
have our agreement in place.

1144
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:01,168
Sure.

1145
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:15,182
-Eden.
-What?

1146
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:16,417
Don't.

1147
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,051
We can't make any
decisions until we see

1148
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:19,621
what else is on that phone.

1149
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:21,455
It doesn't matter.

1150
01:05:21,488 --> 01:05:23,056
What do you mean?

1151
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:27,695
Miss, your
friend is right.

1152
01:05:27,729 --> 01:05:31,131
No matter what you do,
it is not going to change

1153
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:32,499
what transpired.

1154
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:37,104
That municipal contract.

1155
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:39,206
It's a big deal, right?

1156
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:43,511
We have been trying
to get one for years.

1157
01:05:43,545 --> 01:05:46,046
How much is it worth?

1158
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:56,390
We wouldn't have to worry
about money anymore.

1159
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:59,193
And your dad could
finally afford his surgery.

1160
01:05:59,226 --> 01:06:01,962
You wouldn't have to watch
him limp around every day.

1161
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:06,734
Penbrook is all we have talked
about since we were kids.

1162
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:07,602
I know.

1163
01:06:09,169 --> 01:06:12,574
And I need you there
with me next year.

1164
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:18,479
We can't let them
get away with this.

1165
01:06:19,814 --> 01:06:22,684
My son, I assure you, will
be dealt with appropriately.

1166
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:24,184
You have my word.

1167
01:06:24,218 --> 01:06:26,186
You're on my side, right?

1168
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:29,022
I mean, you, you have to
think about Melissa's family.

1169
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:31,526
-What about your family?
-Zara.

1170
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:40,635
It's your
decision, sweetheart.

1171
01:06:54,682 --> 01:06:56,784
We're not making a deal
until we watch that video.

1172
01:07:14,569 --> 01:07:15,637
<i>Schro.</i>

1173
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,137
<i>Look at her, dude,</i>
<i>you're fucking scaring</i>

1174
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:17,906
<i>the shit out of her.</i>

1175
01:07:17,939 --> 01:07:19,206
<i>Can we just let her go home?</i>

1176
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:21,074
<i>Fuck, shut up!</i>

1177
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:29,383
- <i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

1178
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:31,251
- <i>Dude, you're drunk.</i>
<i>You're fucking drunk.</i>

1179
01:07:31,285 --> 01:07:32,185
<i>Bro, you're</i>
<i>gonna fucking hit her!</i>

1180
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:32,921
<i>Fuck this bitch.</i>

1181
01:07:32,954 --> 01:07:34,254
<i>Dude, no, don't...</i>

1182
01:07:34,288 --> 01:07:35,389
<i>Dude, no.</i>

1183
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:36,658
<i>Bro, get</i>
<i>your hand off the wheel.</i>

1184
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:39,259
<i>Schroder, please</i>
<i>just fucking pull over...</i>

1185
01:07:39,293 --> 01:07:40,327
<i>You gotta</i>
<i>chill out, man.</i>

1186
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,395
before you do
something fucking stupid.

1187
01:07:41,428 --> 01:07:43,665
<i>Hey, hey watch out!</i>

1188
01:07:44,966 --> 01:07:46,266
- <i>What the fuck?!</i>
<i>- What the fuck?!</i>

1189
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,401
<i>Holy shit!</i>

1190
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:49,136
<i>Schroder, what</i>
<i>the fuck was that?!</i>

1191
01:07:49,169 --> 01:07:50,638
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1192
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:52,172
<i>You just</i>
<i>fucking ran over her!</i>

1193
01:07:54,676 --> 01:07:57,144
<i>Fucking shit, bro!</i>

1194
01:07:57,177 --> 01:07:57,812
<i>What the fuck!</i>

1195
01:07:57,845 --> 01:07:59,112
<i>Shit.</i>

1196
01:07:59,146 --> 01:07:59,781
<i>Shit.</i>

1197
01:08:39,486 --> 01:08:40,755
That's what I was
trying to save you.

1198
01:08:43,223 --> 01:08:46,661
You're too young to make
a decision that difficult.

1199
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:48,830
It's not really that
hard of a decision.

1200
01:08:48,863 --> 01:08:50,497
We're gonna leave and I'm
taking the phone with me.

1201
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:51,365
Let's go.

1202
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:53,835
Barrett.

1203
01:08:53,868 --> 01:08:56,203
Where do
you think you're going?

1204
01:08:57,304 --> 01:08:58,806
Back your ass up, son.

1205
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:02,209
-Zara.
-I don't feel so good.

1206
01:09:03,544 --> 01:09:05,312
I think they've done
something to us.

1207
01:09:05,345 --> 01:09:06,313
Barrett, Barrett, Barrett.

1208
01:09:10,585 --> 01:09:11,819
Hey, come on.

1209
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,394
Come on.

1210
01:09:21,228 --> 01:09:22,262
Come on.

1211
01:09:34,642 --> 01:09:36,811
Think about it, Eden.

1212
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:38,311
Would you rather
four years in prison

1213
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:40,682
or four years in the
college of your dreams?

1214
01:09:40,715 --> 01:09:41,481
Prison? What's
he talking about?

1215
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:43,216
It doesn't
matter, come on.

1216
01:09:47,622 --> 01:09:51,659
These girls are responsible
for a young woman's death.

1217
01:09:51,693 --> 01:09:53,226
Kendra's dead?

1218
01:09:54,261 --> 01:09:55,730
Unfortunately.

1219
01:09:55,763 --> 01:09:57,832
But it
wasn't our fault.

1220
01:09:57,865 --> 01:09:59,332
It was self-defense.

1221
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:01,669
Well, I'm sure that's what
your lawyer will argue,

1222
01:10:01,703 --> 01:10:04,639
but it might be a little
bit difficult finding one.

1223
01:10:04,672 --> 01:10:07,775
I know every prosecutor,
DA, and judge in the county,

1224
01:10:07,809 --> 01:10:10,611
and I'll see to it that you
serve the maximum sentence.

1225
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:19,252
Kendra's dead.

1226
01:10:21,421 --> 01:10:23,323
This is all your fault.

1227
01:10:24,525 --> 01:10:26,527
Go get that phone, okay?

1228
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,266
Get it yourself.

1229
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,401
Come on.

1230
01:10:34,434 --> 01:10:35,268
Zara.

1231
01:10:38,506 --> 01:10:39,907
- Dad?
- I got it.

1232
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,509
-Dad?
-I got it.

1233
01:10:43,745 --> 01:10:44,779
No, no, no.

1234
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:01,796
Dad, she's getting away.

1235
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:02,663
Barrett.

1236
01:11:11,739 --> 01:11:12,573
Oh.

1237
01:11:32,727 --> 01:11:35,997
You didn't really think
that I would let you

1238
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,032
hurt my family, did you?

1239
01:12:03,658 --> 01:12:04,491
Hey.

1240
01:12:06,961 --> 01:12:08,328
There you are.

1241
01:12:11,132 --> 01:12:11,966
It's okay.

1242
01:12:20,508 --> 01:12:22,577
What did you do?

1243
01:12:24,645 --> 01:12:27,148
Lorazepam and propofol.

1244
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:30,051
At high enough
doses, it induces you

1245
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:32,987
into temporary paralysis.

1246
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,156
Trust me, I know.

1247
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:37,625
My parents used to slip
it in my food and drink

1248
01:12:37,658 --> 01:12:39,093
when I was a kid.

1249
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:20,534
I wanted to tell the police.

1250
01:13:21,501 --> 01:13:23,871
But Mother wouldn't have it.

1251
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:31,646
You don't have to do this.

1252
01:13:33,014 --> 01:13:33,848
I do.

1253
01:13:35,216 --> 01:13:36,416
You don't.

1254
01:13:45,626 --> 01:13:48,029
Don't cry.

1255
01:13:48,062 --> 01:13:50,765
Please, you don't
have to do this.

1256
01:13:50,798 --> 01:13:51,799
It's okay.

1257
01:13:52,934 --> 01:13:53,768
It's okay.

1258
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:06,547
Come on, son.

1259
01:14:07,615 --> 01:14:08,516
Get outta the car.

1260
01:14:11,252 --> 01:14:12,153
Schroder.

1261
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:15,756
No.

1262
01:14:42,149 --> 01:14:42,984
Gooch.

1263
01:14:44,185 --> 01:14:46,187
Put Kendra in the trunk.

1264
01:14:47,254 --> 01:14:48,022
Why?

1265
01:14:48,055 --> 01:14:49,223
Because she's
got a hole in her

1266
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:51,859
and it deserves
an explanation.

1267
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:56,664
I can't.

1268
01:14:56,697 --> 01:14:58,032
I'm sorry?

1269
01:14:58,065 --> 01:14:59,233
Gooch?

1270
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:01,202
Well, you wouldn't
have to if you didn't

1271
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:03,204
shoot your little film.

1272
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:04,071
Go on with it.

1273
01:15:35,736 --> 01:15:37,304
Come on.

1274
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:06,667
Do you know, Eden...

1275
01:16:10,838 --> 01:16:14,842
You'd have done really,
really good at Penbrook.

1276
01:16:16,043 --> 01:16:17,211
I should know.

1277
01:16:19,814 --> 01:16:22,683
I was a scholarship
girl myself.

1278
01:16:26,187 --> 01:16:27,688
Please.

1279
01:16:29,056 --> 01:16:30,224
Night night.

1280
01:18:36,784 --> 01:18:37,885
Come on!

1281
01:19:13,187 --> 01:19:14,021
Dad?

1282
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:21,762
Dad.

1283
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:50,424
Eden, this isn't the way.

1284
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:51,859
We need to go to the police.

1285
01:19:53,628 --> 01:19:54,461
We will.

1286
01:21:30,525 --> 01:21:33,595
<i>Less than one hour ago, a</i>
<i>car careened off Winslow Road</i>

1287
01:21:33,628 --> 01:21:35,630
<i>and plunged into Tillery River.</i>

1288
01:21:35,663 --> 01:21:38,966
<i>Authorities have recovered three</i>
<i>bodies from inside the car,</i>

1289
01:21:38,999 --> 01:21:41,101
<i>a man and two teenagers.</i>

1290
01:21:41,135 --> 01:21:45,072
<i>Warning, some of these</i>
<i>images are distressing.</i>

1291
01:21:45,105 --> 01:21:47,975
<i>A police correspondent</i>
<i>called the deaths, quote,</i>

1292
01:21:48,008 --> 01:21:49,511
<i>"unfortunate."</i>

1293
01:21:49,544 --> 01:21:51,613
<i>Preliminary findings</i>
<i>had attributed this</i>

1294
01:21:51,646 --> 01:21:53,615
<i>to an alcohol related incident,</i>

1295
01:21:53,648 --> 01:21:55,983
<i>but as you can see</i>
<i>behind me, this is still</i>

1296
01:21:56,016 --> 01:21:57,484
<i>a very active scene.</i>

1297
01:21:57,519 --> 01:21:59,554
<i>What was at first</i>
<i>deemed an accident</i>

1298
01:21:59,587 --> 01:22:01,955
<i>now looks like there's</i>
<i>some suspicious activity</i>

1299
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:04,592
<i>involving stab wounds</i>
<i>onto the bodies,</i>

1300
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:06,528
<i>indicating some</i>
<i>degree of foul play.</i>

1301
01:22:17,371 --> 01:22:18,706
Hello, angel.

1302
01:25:37,437 --> 01:25:38,271
Mom.

1303
01:25:53,387 --> 01:25:55,923
Get the fuck outta my
car, you fucking bitch!

1304
01:25:55,957 --> 01:25:57,659
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1305
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:11,371
Fuck you, Eden!

1306
01:28:47,862 --> 01:28:51,464
School's gonna be
real weird on Monday.

1307
01:28:54,535 --> 01:28:55,402
No, no.

1308
01:29:01,909 --> 01:29:02,743
Asshole.

1309
01:29:07,748 --> 01:29:08,583
Oh my god.

1310
01:29:11,085 --> 01:29:12,553
It's okay.

1311
01:29:12,587 --> 01:29:14,789
It's okay, it's okay.

1312
01:29:14,822 --> 01:29:15,723
Yeah, yeah.

1313
01:29:20,828 --> 01:29:21,662
Okay.

1314
01:29:22,763 --> 01:29:23,598
Okay.

1315
01:29:30,838 --> 01:29:32,506
You're killing me.

1316
01:29:46,787 --> 01:29:48,488
I'm gonna get you home, okay?

1317
01:29:48,522 --> 01:29:49,422
-Okay.
-Okay.

1318
01:29:49,456 --> 01:29:50,423
Okay.
