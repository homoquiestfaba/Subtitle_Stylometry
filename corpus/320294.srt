1
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:07,832
So there I was,
face to face with the biggest,

2
00:00:07,906 --> 00:00:10,704
meanest leopard on this side
of the Serengeti. And...

3
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:13,836
You roared so loud,
his spots flew clean off.

4
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:16,278
Dad, I've heard this
like a billion times.

5
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:19,317
Do you know the one where
I made the laughing hyenas...

6
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:21,375
Cry? Yep.

7
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:23,318
- The croc attack?
- Dad.

8
00:00:23,388 --> 00:00:25,288
OK. Think.

9
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:27,518
Yeah, you do that.

10
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:29,618
All right, Mr. Smart Guy,

11
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,493
here's one I know you haven't heard.

12
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:38,025
It all started in the little place
I like to call...

13
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:41,695
...the wild.

14
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:46,970
<i>They were the fastest wildebeests
on the savannah.</i>

15
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:50,278
<i>We're talking fast.</i>

16
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:53,443
<i>All the other lions
had given up the hunt hours ago,</i>

17
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:55,281
<i>except your old man.</i>

18
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:58,084
<i>Fortunately, I knew a short cut.</i>

19
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,462
<i>I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.</i>

20
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,394
<i>Classic wildebeest trap.</i>

21
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:11,399
<i>So, what did you do next?</i>

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,131
<i>- What did I do?
- Yeah.</i>

23
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:16,697
<i>That's when I gave them the roar.</i>

24
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,724
<i>- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.</i>

25
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:36,955
<i>I only thought it was over.</i>

26
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:41,398
<i>But they had a secret weapon.</i>

27
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:44,401
<i>He was the biggest wildebeest
I've ever seen.</i>

28
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,336
<i>- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?</i>

29
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:52,901
<i>I meant 1,401 feet tall!</i>

30
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,878
<i>Cool.</i>

31
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:57,938
<i>And he had two... No, four</i>

32
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,951
<i>of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.</i>

33
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:05,151
<i>- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!</i>

34
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:06,815
<i>I mean, green.</i>

35
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:09,190
<i>And he hated the environment.</i>

36
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:12,230
<i>To pull this off, I knew I was
gonna have to dig deep,</i>

37
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:14,288
<i>deeper than I ever had before.</i>

38
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,300
<i>So I swallowed my fear,</i>

39
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:18,563
<i>sucked in the biggest breath I could.</i>

40
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:19,968
<i>Dad, I'm ready!</i>

41
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:21,232
<i>- You got it?
- I got it!</i>

42
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:22,967
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!

43
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,669
Roar, son!

44
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:52,036
Story of my life.

45
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:55,665
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.

46
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,868
Hey, come on. That was much better.

47
00:02:57,943 --> 00:03:01,208
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.

48
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:05,545
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.

49
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:09,018
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.

50
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:12,523
- OK. Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.

51
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:15,082
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,889
Maybe it's something technical.

53
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:20,022
Maybe you're not opening your mouth
wide enough. Like this.

54
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:23,761
Dad, thanks for the technical help,

55
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:27,168
but if you wanted me to roar like you,
you'd take me to the wild.

56
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,039
Hold on a second. We've got
everything we could ever want here.

57
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:33,100
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.

58
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:34,475
- It's boring.
- Boring?

59
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:36,844
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.

60
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:39,315
But don't worry. I finally figured out

61
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,614
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?

62
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:44,382
The pigeons say
those green boxes go there.

63
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:47,220
Those boxes are bad news. Stay away.

64
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,886
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,

65
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,657
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.

66
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:55,757
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!

67
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:57,131
It's a rat!

68
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:58,931
Get that rat off my baby!

69
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,301
A rat?

70
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,099
Hello!

71
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:04,767
Silly, silly rat.

72
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:09,271
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!

73
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,947
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby
I've ever seen!

74
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,686
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?

75
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:26,795
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."

76
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:29,663
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...

77
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:32,862
- Octave.
- Octave!

78
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:36,834
You ready to cheer me and your old man
as we capture our fifth straight

79
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:40,241
turtle-curling title?

80
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:44,211
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?

81
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:46,846
So, you really think
it dropped an octave?

82
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:49,148
Absolutely.

83
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:53,248
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.

84
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:59,186
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol. I'll stick with the nuts.

85
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,292
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.

86
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,461
He's 11, but he's still roaring
at a nine-year-old level.

87
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:07,698
Little help here, Sammy?

88
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,837
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high,

89
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,436
with all those stories
about Samson the Wild.

90
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:19,813
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.

91
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:24,151
OK. I'm not gonna argue with someone
who can use my tail as dental floss.

92
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:27,555
- You got something right there.
- Where?

93
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:30,220
- No, no, other side.
- Here?

94
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,388
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.

95
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:33,997
<i>Attention, friends.</i>

96
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:37,432
<i>Stop by the gift shop and get
the most popular plush in America:</i>

97
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:39,436
<i>Nigel, the "l-Like-You" Koala.</i>

98
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:42,905
<i>- Look, honey! The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

99
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:47,172
<i>That's right. He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.</i>

100
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,774
Finally.

101
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:56,116
And the zoo will officially be ours
in T-minus three...

102
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:58,615
...two...

103
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,318
...and showtime!

104
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,126
Here I come!

105
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:07,687
Who put that bar there?

106
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:14,795
That tickles!

107
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:18,707
- Did too!
- Did not!

108
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,005
- Did too!
- Did not!

109
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,306
Out of my way, ya bum!

110
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:23,313
There's that moth-eaten koala!

111
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:26,873
I've told you flamingos
a hundred times, walk.

112
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,886
- How about an autograph?!
- Don't...

113
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:31,354
Birds! Find the string on his back!

114
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,517
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.

115
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,590
Off my co-captain, now.

116
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:39,129
Sorry, Samson.

117
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:41,592
That didn't hurt.

118
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:45,659
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.

119
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:50,401
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...

120
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:51,464
Perfect, right?

121
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:55,775
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.

122
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:58,247
Watch where you're goin', you big...!

123
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:09,287
Bridget.

124
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:11,989
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.

125
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:18,325
Of course. I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.

126
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:20,667
It goes around your left hoof.

127
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,468
Did you get that out of the trash?

128
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,804
You did! You trash-picker!

129
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:28,437
I'm not a trash-picker. I'm a recycler.

130
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:31,482
That's a lot more romantic. Isn't it?

131
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,176
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.

132
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,719
Romantic? Don't mention
romance to me, Benny.

133
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:38,221
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.

134
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,689
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.

135
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,557
Benny, only the female
orb-weaver spider

136
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:46,028
will date a male
one-twentieth her size.

137
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:48,565
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.

138
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:52,199
But at least he dies happy.

139
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,498
Let's get Ryan, dude!

140
00:07:57,575 --> 00:08:00,237
Dude! We said that at the same time!

141
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:02,245
Dude.

142
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:10,250
Hey! Hey, Ryan.

143
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:14,722
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?

144
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:17,591
Come on, Ryan. We need you.
You're our biggest fan.

145
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:22,759
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!

146
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:25,769
Thanks, man. Right back at ya!

147
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:27,998
You were saying, Dad?

148
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:30,906
Listen. About this afternoon,
I was just trying...

149
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,274
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?

150
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:39,847
OK. I'II... see you there, then.

151
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:51,518
Come on, dude.

152
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:54,258
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?

153
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,493
Eze. Duke.

154
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,627
Man, he always guesses.

155
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:02,503
We're gonna stalk the gazelles
while everybody's at the game.

156
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:06,476
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!

157
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,011
The Ryanator.

158
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:11,308
I'm comin' down.

159
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:15,047
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!

160
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,553
Now eyeball-free!

161
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:19,715
We're into the final period
of the curling championships

162
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,123
and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.

163
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,496
What a beauty!

164
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:26,621
Yeah, sweep!

165
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:30,930
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!

166
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,936
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!

167
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,768
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.

168
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,330
What? "Tough to beat"?

169
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:39,808
That's just the way we like it,
right, guys?

170
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:44,644
I can't believe this!

171
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:48,447
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!

172
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,818
We cannot lose to flightless birds!

173
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:55,155
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.

174
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:57,626
As long as we stay focused.

175
00:09:57,695 --> 00:10:00,459
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh! I know!

176
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:03,626
Maybe he's sulking 'cause
he lives in his father's shadow

177
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,828
and he roars like a schoolgirl.

178
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:07,838
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!

179
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:11,000
Nigel! Nigel! Will you sign my dolly?

180
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:13,600
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.

181
00:10:13,678 --> 00:10:15,270
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

182
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:18,747
- You're so cuddly! We love you!
- That's it! I am not cuddly!

183
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:22,183
I'm a vicious jungle animal
from the streets of London!

184
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:24,380
- Fear me!
- Get him! Get him! Get him!

185
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,116
- Help me!
- Girls! Put him down.

186
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:29,387
I am not a doll!

187
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,758
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!

188
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:34,525
Nigel! Get your paws off my girlfriend!

189
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,567
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!

190
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:42,366
<i>Really nice day!</i>

191
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,274
What is up with
Samson's team tonight? Brutal!

192
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:47,675
Benny?

193
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:49,940
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?

194
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:51,276
I do!

195
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:53,711
What was that?

196
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,185
Just your daily dose
of vitamin Benny, baby.

197
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:58,484
<i>- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!</i>

198
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:00,387
<i>- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!</i>

199
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,153
Cannonball!

200
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:06,528
Next year, I should just coach.

201
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,095
Check it. The Thomson gazelle.

202
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:12,966
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.

203
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:17,064
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.

204
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:20,440
Let's get a closer look
at these slim jims.

205
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,002
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.

206
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:25,072
Maybe we should just
go to the game.

207
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,414
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.

208
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:31,478
Yeah, if he were our age,
he would so be rockin' out with us.

209
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:34,525
He'd be in there,
runnin' 'em down like they were...

210
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:37,755
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.

211
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:38,921
Ready, man?

212
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:40,720
We'd better not.

213
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:43,392
Oh, yeah? Are you gonna stop us?

214
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:46,266
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!

215
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,805
The whole series
comes down to this throw!

216
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:51,808
There's no tomorrow! It's do or die!

217
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,366
Ya know what I mean.

218
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:56,436
Guys, I know we're down,
but we're gonna pull this out

219
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,414
'cause we're gonna use...

220
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:01,043
<i>...the secret play.
- The secret play!</i>

221
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:05,317
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!

222
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,415
Larry, the first part of the secret play

223
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:09,050
is keeping it secret.

224
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:10,458
- OK.
- Follow my lead.

225
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:13,156
I'm going to need
a double effort from everybody.

226
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,995
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.

227
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:18,627
- Good. Ready, and...
- Break!

228
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:20,730
Quiet.

229
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:23,296
On three, dude. One, two...

230
00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:24,773
No!

231
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,714
Now you did it, Ryan.

232
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:39,314
Feelin' mean, Donald?

233
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,687
Bring it on!

234
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,124
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!

235
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:45,287
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.

236
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:47,854
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!

237
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:53,302
Samson, it's a shame your little brat
isn't here to see you lose.

238
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:56,966
I can't... hold it!

239
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,101
Oh, no! What are you doin'?

240
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,675
And here comes Samson. Look at that guy.

241
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,718
Is he a beauty or what?

242
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,844
Larry! Bridget! Sweep!

243
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,513
What a recovery!

244
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,558
He's sendin' in Bridget
and Larry to do the job!

245
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,718
Sweep faster, Larry! Sweep, sweep!

246
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:18,557
- I am!
- Come on, man!

247
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:21,063
Team Penguin
is sending their ace, Victor...

248
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,794
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?

249
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,996
Nigel, how are we looking?

250
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:30,131
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.

251
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,540
This is cheating
and you will die for this.

252
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,339
I can't hear you, Nigel.

253
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:37,006
Move left a bit...

254
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,881
OK. Move left and hit!

255
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:43,580
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!

256
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:46,387
What a move!

257
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:54,060
Folks, we are inches away
from the greatest upset

258
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:56,396
in turtle-curling history!

259
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,935
- Oh, no! I can't believe my eyes!
- No!

260
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:01,028
Looks like Samson might have choked!

261
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:05,234
- Nice!
- Yes!

262
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,004
Unbelievable!

263
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,275
Samson and his team
have clinched the title!

264
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:13,181
- No, wait! I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?

265
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:17,244
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!

266
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:20,882
Stampede? Stampede!

267
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,492
Please! Stop!

268
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,368
Watch out!

269
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:45,281
Dude. Busted.

270
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:47,078
Catastrophic.

271
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,210
Told you I'd come to the game.

272
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:50,720
You think this is funny?

273
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,086
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!

274
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:54,624
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

275
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:57,286
Chasing the gazelles
or costing us the game?

276
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:59,386
All you do is sit up
in your tree and sulk.

277
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,432
- If you just...
- What's the problem?

278
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:03,399
Is all this because you can't roar?

279
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:08,930
Ryan, I didn't mean that.

280
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:11,474
Know what I'm doing
when I'm sulking in my tree?

281
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:15,103
I'm thinking how great it would be
if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.

282
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:17,673
Ryan, I didn't...

283
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:20,615
'Cause it would make being
Ryan the Lame a lot easier.

284
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:22,516
Ryan, I'm sorry.

285
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:26,079
Ryan! Please don't...

286
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:28,022
...leave.

287
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:31,425
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.

288
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:34,294
And you were worried
he wouldn't show up.

289
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,369
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.

290
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:46,910
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.

291
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:50,243
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?

292
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:53,613
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?

293
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:56,209
I'm saying you
have to tell him the truth.

294
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:59,222
I don't think I could do that, Benny.

295
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,882
I mean...

296
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,756
What's he gonna think of me
when he finds out?

297
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:06,285
I don't know.

298
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,628
But if you don't tell him...

299
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,031
...you're gonna lose him, Sammy.

300
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,914
The green boxes.

301
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,825
OK, they're all loaded up!

302
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:26,199
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!

303
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,034
I changed my mind! I don't wanna go!

304
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:31,135
Help!

305
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,800
Ryan.

306
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,369
Help me!

307
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:37,971
Watch out!

308
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,543
Sam!

309
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:42,483
- Wait for us!
- Dad!

310
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:44,453
- Ryan!
- Dad!

311
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:46,513
Don't let them take me!

312
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,024
- No!
- Ryan!

313
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,082
Help!

314
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:54,121
- No!
- Dad! Help me!

315
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:56,063
Ryan!

316
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:07,210
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.

317
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:09,838
Get me... the pigeons.

318
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,382
I am wanting snake eyes!

319
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,353
Come on, baby.

320
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:19,048
Come on, just throw it.

321
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,118
Thanks.

322
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:30,997
Hamir! You are the
great loser of all time!

323
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:34,003
What offerings must I make, I wonder?

324
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:35,663
Hamir! Hamir!

325
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,503
Get a grip on yourself!

326
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:43,011
Benny! I am needing till Friday
before I am paying you back!

327
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,547
No, no. It's Ryan.

328
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:47,584
He's in one of those green boxes
and they took it away!

329
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:49,084
We've got to find him!

330
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:51,951
That is not good! Not good at all!

331
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:56,018
I know! I know!

332
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:59,028
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!

333
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:03,228
The green boxes go to the big water

334
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,825
where stiff lady
with spikes on her head...

335
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:08,736
- Hamir? I can't understand...
- Spikes!

336
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:12,469
Just tell me where the green boxes go.

337
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:15,979
Stiff lady, spikies?

338
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:18,808
Yes, like my wife says,

339
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:22,751
the truck takes them to her! To her!

340
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,452
Though I hate telling bad news,
there is more bad news to tell.

341
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:33,862
When the sun rises, the green boxes
leave on boat-boat and never return!

342
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:39,130
I am sorry for this. I really am.

343
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:42,102
Hello?

344
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,868
No. Not good. Not good.

345
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:48,741
You always say that.

346
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:51,213
I keep on sayin' it. No one's listenin'.

347
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,216
Like a broken record here.

348
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,081
OK. When do we leave, Sammy?

349
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,483
Yeah, when do we leave?

350
00:20:56,554 --> 00:21:00,149
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.

351
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:03,284
This is now a rescue mission
and I am the only one going.

352
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,828
We'll come too! We're not afraid.

353
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:07,158
Are we, guys?

354
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:08,960
Afraid? No.

355
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:11,763
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."

356
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:13,531
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.

357
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:16,164
Not that I'll ever have
one of my own at this rate.

358
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,073
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,

359
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:21,509
"We will fight them... with peaches."

360
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,974
Yeah. Anyway.

361
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:28,109
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me? OK.

362
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:31,643
If you don't mind
being hunted down, shot at...

363
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:33,349
<i>...stuffed...
- OK!</i>

364
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:35,449
...or worse, then fine.

365
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:38,893
I have a recurring nightmare
about taxidermy and spot remover.

366
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:42,865
Well, they have to catch us
before they can stuff us and I'm fast.

367
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:46,027
Nobody's leaving but me. Got it?

368
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:48,671
- You're the boss.
- You bet.

369
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:50,502
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.

370
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:52,201
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.

371
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,744
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.

372
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:57,679
Now that they're out of the picture,
what's the plan?

373
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:24,240
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.

374
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:25,832
I got it all taken care of.

375
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,845
I know this city...

376
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:30,403
...like the back of my paw.

377
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:33,882
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue,
couple lefts, couple rights,

378
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:35,976
bada-boom, past Broadway and...

379
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:40,513
You're there!

380
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:47,628
What are you doing here?

381
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,397
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!

382
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:55,461
She said,
"We're gonna help you find Ryan."

383
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,302
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.

384
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:59,774
I've got popcorn up my bum.

385
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:01,674
Do I look trashy in this?

386
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:03,673
OK, here's my...

387
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:07,205
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?

388
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:10,447
I only have until sunrise
before Ryan is taken away forever!

389
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:12,921
And now I have to worry about you three?

390
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:17,292
All right, fine. When do we
get off of this thing, Benny?

391
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:18,692
Benny's here?

392
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:20,753
Yeah, he's right there.

393
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:22,992
Benny?

394
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,029
Benny!

395
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:30,633
Great. Now what am I gonna do?

396
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,768
Guys! Guys! I think we should duck!

397
00:23:33,844 --> 00:23:34,970
What is she saying?

398
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:37,707
She said, "Duck down!"

399
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:39,112
Duck!

400
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,283
I am not in the mood
for a game of footsie

401
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:46,619
or hoofsie or pawsie or...

402
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,851
That wasn't my paw. It was this!

403
00:23:50,861 --> 00:23:53,261
I didn't steal it. I borrowed it.

404
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,322
It'll light the way to Ryan.

405
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:01,659
The walls are moving.

406
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:03,393
Right, right. The walls...

407
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:04,764
The walls are moving!

408
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:06,860
Larry, hold your breath!

409
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:11,234
Larry, stay straight!

410
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:14,574
Everybody out!

411
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:17,079
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...

412
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:25,553
This is definitely not good. Samson!

413
00:25:25,622 --> 00:25:28,523
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!

414
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:29,889
Larry!

415
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:35,628
The garbage! It lives!

416
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:42,433
Guys?

417
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:44,906
OK, anybody? I'm freakin' out.

418
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:48,575
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?

419
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:51,405
We're over here, Nigel.

420
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:53,416
Right. I'll be there in a minute.

421
00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:55,748
Think. What did Benny say?

422
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:59,050
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.

423
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:00,954
Bridget, can you see the green lady?

424
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:02,992
I'm looking, I'm looking,

425
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,893
but I can't see over anything
for a change.

426
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:08,659
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?

427
00:26:08,732 --> 00:26:10,563
Is that you, Larry?

428
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,794
Up here, Nige.

429
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,269
You're a very furry snake.

430
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:17,273
Guys... We don't want
to draw attention to ourselves.

431
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:25,240
Dogs. This should be fun
for you, Samson.

432
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:26,907
Nigel! Grab Bridget!

433
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:29,179
- What?
- Run!

434
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:34,657
I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up!

435
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:37,455
Shouldn't you be
tearing them to shreds?

436
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:41,760
All part of the plan. This maneuver's
known as the Serengeti Slip.

437
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:44,357
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.

438
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:49,961
What next?

439
00:26:51,575 --> 00:26:53,236
Page 11?

440
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,771
Go on, you mutts!

441
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:59,179
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.

442
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:04,277
Taken you to a... To a disco!

443
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:06,648
Larry, improvise!

444
00:27:08,725 --> 00:27:10,989
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.

445
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:14,360
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!

446
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:16,592
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.

447
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,192
You're a lion. Be a lion.

448
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:23,262
Look at that guy!

449
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:27,236
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.

450
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:30,638
OK...

451
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:32,443
- Larry, coil!
- Check!

452
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:41,814
- Sam!
- I improvised. Now jump!

453
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,223
- Down there?
- Yes!

454
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:49,299
We're leaving, Larry!

455
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:10,209
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there,

456
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:13,279
why didn't you just do
what you did in the wild?

457
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:15,348
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them

458
00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:17,017
or lionify them?

459
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,460
I don't have time
to fight dogs, Bridget.

460
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:21,724
We have to find Ryan, remember?

461
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:23,891
What is this stinky place?

462
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,128
It...

463
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:28,262
...appears to be a human bathing area.

464
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:31,273
You mean humans
don't lick themselves clean?

465
00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:32,808
Disgusting!

466
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:36,744
They're hopeless. It is hard to believe
they are at the top of the food chain.

467
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:40,579
I can't imagine beginning the day
without licking myself.

468
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:43,142
No hurry, but is there a plan?

469
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,620
Of course there's a plan.

470
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:48,089
We follow this water to the big water,

471
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:50,217
and then we find the lady with...

472
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:57,891
Larry, either your stomach is growling
or something in it is growling.

473
00:28:57,968 --> 00:28:59,629
Wasn't me.

474
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:03,364
What?

475
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:13,142
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy! Twins!

476
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,684
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now,
'cause these guys

477
00:29:15,752 --> 00:29:18,220
are seeming to have acid reflux
or something!

478
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:20,848
Everybody... stay calm.

479
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:22,482
- Calm?
- Not good.

480
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:28,460
Yo. Boo!

481
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,797
I'm gonna say,
it looks like you and your crew here

482
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,734
are a little far from your borough.

483
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:38,602
Far from your borough! I love it.

484
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:40,336
We're going to the big water.

485
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,810
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.

486
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:46,946
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.

487
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,521
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.

488
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,388
- No idea. You?
- Doesn't even register.

489
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,054
- You're battin' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...

490
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,128
Make your bloody mind up.

491
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,001
The big female
with the spikes on her melon!

492
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:07,400
They're tourists.

493
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:11,032
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.

494
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:12,973
First take the Broadway culvert.

495
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:16,240
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?

496
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,975
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!

497
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,517
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?

498
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:23,143
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!

499
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,053
The Wall Street culvert
is blocked with construction.

500
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:27,681
- That is true.
- All right.

501
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:29,316
Guys, you gonna help or not?

502
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:32,123
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.

503
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:34,390
We're one big family, right?

504
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:36,728
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...

505
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,361
You done runnin' your mouth yet,
Carmine? Are ya?

506
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:44,168
I apologize. He never got over
being flushed down the toilet.

507
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:46,197
Yeah.

508
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:49,939
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last
ten minutes in this neighborhood.

509
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:51,446
It's a jungle down here.

510
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:53,813
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What? No.

511
00:30:53,884 --> 00:30:56,284
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!

512
00:30:56,353 --> 00:30:59,015
How ya doing?

513
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:01,284
I'm so cuddly! I like you!

514
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:06,587
I've seen a lot of those things
floatin' here in the sewer.

515
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:10,561
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.

516
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,625
Just wait for me!

517
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:23,240
Are we in the right place?

518
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:25,713
Any place without
two hilarious alligators

519
00:31:25,782 --> 00:31:27,716
seems a move in the right direction.

520
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:32,653
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.

521
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:37,185
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.

522
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,287
And it's sunrise,
which means we're a tad short on time.

523
00:31:41,364 --> 00:31:43,730
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.

524
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,428
It's gotta be around here,
so I need you to...

525
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:48,835
Yeah. So we should
shout out if we see a box

526
00:31:48,905 --> 00:31:51,066
that looks like the ones over there.

527
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:54,469
It hasn't left yet! We can make it!

528
00:31:54,544 --> 00:31:56,444
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!

529
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,310
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?

530
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:06,753
Run!

531
00:32:12,395 --> 00:32:13,987
No!

532
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:15,656
No!

533
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:17,324
Ryan's on that thing!

534
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,958
We've got to stop it!

535
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:21,162
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!

536
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:23,729
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!

537
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:33,377
I failed. Again.

538
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,577
I only count one failure.

539
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:38,280
It's big, but it's just one.

540
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:42,382
Goodbye, Ryan. We're gonna miss ya.

541
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:48,222
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?

542
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:52,394
It's a human and I do not
think he works for the zoo.

543
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:55,029
Perhaps now
is a good time to improvise.

544
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:56,436
What?

545
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:05,948
Great! One problem down...

546
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,482
Far out.

547
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:09,075
Cool.

548
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,017
One disaster to go.

549
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:22,927
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!

550
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:25,160
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?

551
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:27,931
None of us. We're animals. Great!

552
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:42,877
- Hold on, Larry. Do that again.
- Do what?

553
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:45,080
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!

554
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:47,749
But I don't know my opposites!

555
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:50,182
No, Larry, like this!

556
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:01,170
I think I've got it.

557
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,437
Well, that was easy.

558
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:09,708
Oh, dear. Has anyone
got any eucalyptus wipes?

559
00:34:09,779 --> 00:34:11,940
This isn't so difficult.

560
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:15,007
I'm the lion of the sea!

561
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,609
Well done, sir.

562
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:20,884
Captain of our team
and now captain of this vessel.

563
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:21,981
You're brilliant.

564
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:26,825
I hate to be Miss Negative,
but in this melee,

565
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:28,830
we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.

566
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:33,028
- What, nothing?
- Nothing. He's gone.

567
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:36,035
No.

568
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:47,573
There! Nelson! The green boxes!

569
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:49,949
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!

570
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,113
And my love!

571
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:55,589
Let's go in!

572
00:34:56,793 --> 00:35:00,251
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun. To the north.

573
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,389
Starboard... Leftboard.

574
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:04,126
Just follow my finger.

575
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,395
Please. You guys
wouldn't know the answer

576
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:08,869
if it fell from the sky
and hit you in the head.

577
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:10,929
Oh, my! It's a bat! It's a bat!

578
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:12,998
Get it off me! Get it off me!

579
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:17,112
- Benny!
- Benny?

580
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,408
Geese!

581
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:23,352
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.

582
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:26,111
Benny, you made it!

583
00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:31,053
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.

584
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:33,061
Even not-so-best friends,

585
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:35,563
who knock you off
a speeding garbage truck.

586
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:38,795
Excuse me, but I begged them
to go back and get you.

587
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:39,857
Just so you know.

588
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:42,905
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat
from up there?

589
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:46,032
Well, it just so happens
I saw it heading that way.

590
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:47,576
And we're in luck!

591
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:50,579
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!

592
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:53,514
Experts at intercontinental travel.

593
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,244
Hey, birdie, OK,

594
00:35:55,318 --> 00:36:00,153
is it true that Canada has lax
immigration policies for koalas?

595
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:02,623
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.

596
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:05,923
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?

597
00:36:05,995 --> 00:36:08,930
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.

598
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:12,126
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?

599
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:16,294
Hey, Benny, thanks.

600
00:36:16,372 --> 00:36:22,242
And FYI, Bridget was very concerned
when you fell off the truck.

601
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:30,283
Bet you didn't know
I could ride geese, did you?

602
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:32,719
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.

603
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:38,889
Sammy? We going to the wild now?

604
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:41,624
I think we are, Larry.

605
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:45,158
I can't take it anymore.

606
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:47,162
He's taunting us! Listen!

607
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:52,167
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!

608
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:55,830
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?

609
00:37:55,905 --> 00:37:58,203
The crew,
they're on the verge of mutiny.

610
00:37:58,274 --> 00:37:59,366
Nigel, please.

611
00:37:59,442 --> 00:38:01,967
If you don't give us
ice creams pretty quick,

612
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:03,774
you're gonna walk the plank, sir!

613
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:05,838
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,

614
00:38:05,915 --> 00:38:08,509
I'm getting off this
death cruise right now.

615
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:15,451
Iceberg! Permission
to go down with the ship, sir.

616
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:17,288
Hang on! Stuff that!

617
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,625
Run! Swim!

618
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:21,823
Nigel?

619
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:25,197
Look, I'm a starfish.

620
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:27,395
Guys, look.

621
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,928
Gosh. Must feel like a lifetime
since you've been here.

622
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:33,942
Yeah... a lifetime.

623
00:38:45,688 --> 00:38:47,019
What the heck?

624
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,320
Wow! Look!

625
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:52,793
They're releasing the green boxes
back into the wild.

626
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:54,056
- Larry.
- Guys,

627
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,655
they're putting animals
inside the green boxes.

628
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:58,860
I just can't figure out why.

629
00:38:58,935 --> 00:39:01,961
It's a tunnel to another dimension,
can't you see?

630
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:03,835
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?

631
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:05,169
It's all right, Nigel.

632
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:07,641
Think it has anything to do with that?

633
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:12,513
Hang on a second. Either I'm starving
or Larry is making sense.

634
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:15,983
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.

635
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:32,765
Ryan?

636
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:35,534
Ryan!

637
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:39,903
Oh, no!

638
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,899
Ryan!

639
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:46,976
We've got to move fast!

640
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,779
Ryan!

641
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:54,488
Ryan! Ryan!

642
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,822
Ryan! Where are you, buddy?

643
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:03,757
Ryan!

644
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,528
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!

645
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:07,899
I was so close. He was right there!

646
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:10,132
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!

647
00:40:10,206 --> 00:40:14,472
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.

648
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:16,034
I don't want to run anymore.

649
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:18,672
Good. 'Cause frankly,
you need a good sports bra.

650
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:20,716
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.

651
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:23,684
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.

652
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:25,687
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?

653
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:27,188
I mean, he got it! Let's go!

654
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:29,588
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!

655
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:32,855
I'm not designed for this! I want a car.

656
00:40:35,598 --> 00:40:38,465
Hey, guys, I found him! Ryan!

657
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:41,930
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?

658
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:44,269
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?

659
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,333
Yeah, now that I think about it,
he did come through here. Hello?

660
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:51,312
Come on out, baby lion! Your dad's here!

661
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:54,646
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!

662
00:40:57,253 --> 00:41:00,484
Funky. I was under the impression
you had Ryan's scent,

663
00:41:00,556 --> 00:41:03,047
not this olfactory insult.

664
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:04,286
I...

665
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,262
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator
instincts must've kicked in since,

666
00:41:08,331 --> 00:41:10,322
you know, I haven't eaten for a while.

667
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,833
Exactly!

668
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:14,699
You never know when those
instincts are gonna kick in.

669
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,363
Excellent. Fantastic!

670
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:18,304
We get to see the legend in action.

671
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:20,433
I'd love to,
but we just don't have time.

672
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,775
We got the time, Sammy. Just...

673
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:26,110
And then you do this. And then this bit.

674
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:29,007
Rip him apart!

675
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:31,513
The horror.

676
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:41,758
I can't bear to watch! But I have to.

677
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,932
Go on. Get out of here.

678
00:41:47,003 --> 00:41:49,198
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.

679
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:52,002
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?

680
00:41:52,075 --> 00:41:55,374
No. It's just I'm allergic to nuts.

681
00:41:55,445 --> 00:41:58,141
Now I get it. You're gonna toy with me?

682
00:41:58,214 --> 00:42:01,274
Beat me up a little,
then pounce when I get my hopes up?

683
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,045
How exciting.

684
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,950
Come on, guys. Ryan can't be far.

685
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:08,684
Hey! I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.

686
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:10,749
My flesh has fruity wood notes!

687
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:14,593
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.

688
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:16,188
You call this wild?

689
00:42:16,265 --> 00:42:19,598
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!

690
00:42:19,669 --> 00:42:23,571
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!

691
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:26,472
Maybe I should hide
behind the koala for protection.

692
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:29,170
While we're at it,
could you slap me in the face?

693
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:30,644
No. What are you, a twit?

694
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:33,113
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother! I'm leaving.

695
00:42:33,182 --> 00:42:35,309
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!

696
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:37,477
It's a lion with moral issues!

697
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:40,652
And I've had it with you too!

698
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:42,384
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!

699
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:45,319
Teensy question.

700
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:48,727
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.

701
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:50,595
That hyrax back there?

702
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,930
It was sort of like
you couldn't eat him.

703
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:57,439
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.

704
00:42:57,507 --> 00:43:00,374
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say that you're...

705
00:43:00,443 --> 00:43:01,876
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.

706
00:43:01,944 --> 00:43:05,004
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...

707
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:08,278
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...

708
00:43:08,351 --> 00:43:10,148
The wild?

709
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:16,255
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.

710
00:43:16,325 --> 00:43:17,758
What?

711
00:43:19,028 --> 00:43:20,825
I'm just a phony.

712
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:24,626
Truth is I can't protect you out here.

713
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:28,166
Please just go back to the boat.

714
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:31,499
I've got to find my son.

715
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:37,369
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle
with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.

716
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:40,381
Actually, I'm nine inches,
but other than that, yes.

717
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:42,383
So that means...

718
00:43:42,451 --> 00:43:44,851
We are going to die!

719
00:43:47,123 --> 00:43:49,057
Hey, guys! Guys!

720
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:53,826
Will the three of you calm down?

721
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:55,329
How could he lie to us?

722
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:57,059
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.

723
00:43:57,133 --> 00:44:00,000
Maybe he lied 'cause he
didn't want to tell us the truth.

724
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,531
OK, yeah, whatever. Whatever.

725
00:44:02,605 --> 00:44:04,732
Let's just go back to the boat, then.

726
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:08,243
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!

727
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:10,905
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait! Where you goin'?

728
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,448
Stop right there! Stop!

729
00:44:13,516 --> 00:44:16,451
Bridget, if you go, I'm...

730
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,453
I'm breaking up with you.

731
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:20,682
We were never going out
in the first place.

732
00:44:20,756 --> 00:44:22,246
Then we're taking a break.

733
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:23,815
- Nigel!
- All right!

734
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:27,654
Hey, listen!

735
00:44:28,264 --> 00:44:31,097
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.

736
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:34,694
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.

737
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:37,432
And... so is Ryan.

738
00:44:41,978 --> 00:44:44,503
OK, OK, focus, Samson.

739
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,175
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.

740
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:51,778
I mean, how big
can this place be, anyway?

741
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:02,864
Ryan!

742
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:20,372
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?

743
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:25,285
You remind me
of my buddy back home.

744
00:45:25,354 --> 00:45:28,983
A bloodthirsty monster!

745
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:30,320
Where? Where?

746
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:33,021
He's a killer! Get away from my baby!

747
00:45:34,897 --> 00:45:36,228
Calm down, lady!

748
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:39,700
Won't anyone save my baby?

749
00:45:41,737 --> 00:45:43,432
Bye-bye.

750
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,974
Ryan! Ryan!

751
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:51,308
Sammy!

752
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,848
I wasn't meant for the wild.

753
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:56,544
I was made to nibble and be elegant

754
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:59,247
and to appear in children's books
as the letter G.

755
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:01,415
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?

756
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:04,084
It's just leaves and vines and...

757
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,523
Oh, that's my foot.

758
00:46:06,595 --> 00:46:08,654
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.

759
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:10,995
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.

760
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:14,802
Oh, I see. All right, OK, yeah.

761
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,829
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.

762
00:46:18,908 --> 00:46:20,842
Nigel! I gave you an order.

763
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,879
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?

764
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:25,277
Nigel.

765
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:28,481
That's not funny, Nigel.

766
00:46:28,551 --> 00:46:30,951
- He's gone! We're doomed.
- Nigel!

767
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,956
First Ryan, then Samson,
and now Nigel!

768
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:36,582
I do believe in zoos.

769
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:39,025
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.

770
00:46:39,095 --> 00:46:41,825
- Don't panic. I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!

771
00:46:41,897 --> 00:46:44,058
I say we fan out and circle.

772
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:47,068
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.

773
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:48,797
Run for your lives, everybody!

774
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:52,898
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?

775
00:46:54,944 --> 00:46:58,505
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.

776
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:01,675
That means they don't hunt. They graze.

777
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:03,680
But they're licking their chops.

778
00:47:03,753 --> 00:47:05,983
I'll take the one with the funny knees.

779
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:08,489
The funny knee...?

780
00:47:08,557 --> 00:47:10,422
Benny, no!

781
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:17,891
Benny?

782
00:47:18,934 --> 00:47:20,663
Get them.

783
00:47:21,604 --> 00:47:24,539
Just, hey, back off. I'm sorry,

784
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:27,269
I'm not that kind of koala bear.

785
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:31,340
Right.

786
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:38,745
Excuse me? Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you,

787
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:41,619
<i>but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?</i>

788
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,491
Right.

789
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:53,796
Could you possibly not go
towards the big smoking thing?

790
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:57,138
<i>G'day, mate
G'day, mate</i>

791
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:59,834
<i>G'day, mate
G'day, mate</i>

792
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:01,706
<i>G'day, mate
G'day, mate</i>

793
00:48:01,777 --> 00:48:04,905
What a strange place for a party.

794
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:15,053
Very good, very organized.

795
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:18,755
Can I use your toilet?

796
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:21,626
<i>I'm having a</i>

797
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:23,426
<i>Really nice day
Really nice day</i>

798
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:25,524
<i>Really nice day</i>

799
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:26,727
<i>I'm having a</i>

800
00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:28,633
<i>Really nice day
Really nice day</i>

801
00:48:28,704 --> 00:48:30,433
<i>Really nice day</i>

802
00:48:30,506 --> 00:48:33,566
<i>- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away</i>

803
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:38,443
They're frighteningly
horrible monster beasts...

804
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:40,243
...but they're not bad dancers.

805
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:42,784
<i>I'm so cuddly
I like you</i>

806
00:48:42,852 --> 00:48:45,320
<i>I'm so cuddly
I like you</i>

807
00:48:45,387 --> 00:48:49,187
Step-kick, pivot-kick,
walk, walk, walk.

808
00:48:49,258 --> 00:48:51,317
<i>- I'm having a
- Really nice day</i>

809
00:48:51,393 --> 00:48:52,690
Oh, no!

810
00:48:52,761 --> 00:48:55,662
<i>Tickle away
Tickle away</i>

811
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:58,131
<i>I'm so cuddly, I like you
Good day</i>

812
00:48:59,768 --> 00:49:02,669
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.

813
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:05,002
Leader. Prophet.

814
00:49:05,074 --> 00:49:06,803
Choreographer.

815
00:49:07,877 --> 00:49:10,641
And with your help... carnivore!

816
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:14,979
No! Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!

817
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:16,711
This is not fair.

818
00:49:28,664 --> 00:49:32,259
Oh, I get it. A yoga retreat.

819
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:36,064
Ryan!

820
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:41,438
You can do this. Use your instincts.

821
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:52,574
Follow your instincts.

822
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:04,962
Use your instincts.

823
00:50:06,065 --> 00:50:07,726
OK.

824
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,734
Down this way.

825
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:14,065
This way.

826
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,834
A lion cub.

827
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:45,899
We must tell Kazar.

828
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,131
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.

829
00:50:50,209 --> 00:50:51,904
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

830
00:50:56,048 --> 00:51:00,075
Thank you very much,
but I'm afraid I've got to run.

831
00:51:00,152 --> 00:51:01,585
Koalas are very busy bees.

832
00:51:01,654 --> 00:51:04,122
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...

833
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,385
For centuries,
we've watched our brethren

834
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:08,893
perish at the claw of the lion.

835
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:12,658
Today, we put our hooves down.

836
00:51:12,731 --> 00:51:17,691
No longer will we dwell
at the bottom of the food chain.

837
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,103
Well, yes. I should say so.

838
00:51:21,173 --> 00:51:25,542
There were those who doubted
that you'd arrive to lead us.

839
00:51:26,011 --> 00:51:28,673
But I always believed in the Omen.

840
00:51:28,747 --> 00:51:32,410
The Omen! Right. Remind me again?

841
00:51:32,485 --> 00:51:34,749
Sent down by the gods years ago...

842
00:51:36,755 --> 00:51:39,747
Oh, no! Not you!

843
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:57,772
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

844
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,113
Oh, Great Him,

845
00:52:05,184 --> 00:52:09,314
you must lead us
in our transformation from prey...

846
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:12,685
...to predator.

847
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:16,788
Hold it. I am the Great Him?

848
00:52:18,564 --> 00:52:21,431
- The Great Him?
- Him.

849
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:27,295
So this is all your fault!
That's it! You...!

850
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:29,398
- Kazar!
- Kazar! Don't listen to him!

851
00:52:29,475 --> 00:52:31,909
- Kazar! Over here!
- Kazar! Over here!

852
00:52:31,977 --> 00:52:35,140
How dare you interrupt my audience
with the Great Him!

853
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:38,581
But... but we found a lion cub!

854
00:52:39,985 --> 00:52:41,919
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?

855
00:52:41,987 --> 00:52:44,455
With big hair? Well, a mullet, really.

856
00:52:44,523 --> 00:52:48,015
Oh, Great Him,
you brought two lions with you?

857
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:50,357
Well, like any Great Him,

858
00:52:50,429 --> 00:52:52,863
I travel with an entourage.

859
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,365
Worry not, Your Himness,
I shall have Blag bring the lions here.

860
00:52:57,436 --> 00:53:01,998
And he better not screw this up,
like you screwed up my dance number!

861
00:53:02,074 --> 00:53:04,201
I lost count for one verse.

862
00:53:04,276 --> 00:53:06,642
Step-kick, pivot-kick,
walk, walk, walk.

863
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,277
Why do we even bother rehearsing?

864
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:14,976
A good chorus line
is so hard to put together.

865
00:53:17,723 --> 00:53:19,122
Take to the skies!

866
00:53:19,191 --> 00:53:21,125
We're taking! We're taking!

867
00:53:23,262 --> 00:53:25,856
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.

868
00:53:25,931 --> 00:53:28,661
Bring us those lions!

869
00:53:32,137 --> 00:53:36,506
The gods celebrate
the fulfillment of the prophecy.

870
00:53:36,575 --> 00:53:39,169
We stamp our hooves

871
00:53:39,245 --> 00:53:42,078
in praise of the Great Him!

872
00:53:42,147 --> 00:53:43,978
Holy moly!

873
00:53:44,049 --> 00:53:46,244
<i>Holy moly
Holy moly</i>

874
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:49,515
You are our king!

875
00:54:05,437 --> 00:54:08,736
Looky, looky who's there.

876
00:54:09,808 --> 00:54:11,070
Surprise!

877
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:15,044
No!

878
00:54:17,082 --> 00:54:19,050
Sorry we're late for dinner!

879
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,459
That's pathetic!

880
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,090
Get off!

881
00:54:33,165 --> 00:54:35,133
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!

882
00:54:38,437 --> 00:54:40,632
- Ryan!
- No!

883
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:43,703
I'm coming, son!

884
00:54:45,344 --> 00:54:47,039
Dad?

885
00:54:47,112 --> 00:54:48,977
- Help!
- Let's scram!

886
00:54:49,048 --> 00:54:50,948
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?

887
00:54:51,016 --> 00:54:53,644
- I can't believe it! I found you.
- How'd you find me?

888
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:55,744
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

889
00:54:55,821 --> 00:54:57,755
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.

890
00:54:57,823 --> 00:54:59,154
It's OK, son.

891
00:54:59,224 --> 00:55:01,852
And then I escaped,
and I ran into the jungle...

892
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:04,623
...then those vultures came
and tried to kill me.

893
00:55:04,697 --> 00:55:07,325
You wouldn't have been scared. I was.

894
00:55:07,399 --> 00:55:09,765
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

895
00:55:10,336 --> 00:55:11,803
Listen.

896
00:55:13,305 --> 00:55:14,897
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!

897
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:17,168
Run!

898
00:55:17,843 --> 00:55:20,334
Dad, you should be chasing them!

899
00:55:20,412 --> 00:55:22,812
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!

900
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:25,213
But now's your chance
to show me for real!

901
00:55:28,987 --> 00:55:30,750
This way!

902
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:38,721
- Dad? What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!

903
00:55:45,237 --> 00:55:47,398
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?

904
00:55:47,473 --> 00:55:49,498
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!

905
00:55:49,575 --> 00:55:51,202
You could kick their rumps!

906
00:55:51,276 --> 00:55:54,837
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens! Get back here!

907
00:55:54,913 --> 00:55:57,006
Ryan! I can't fight them.

908
00:55:57,916 --> 00:55:59,679
What do you mean?

909
00:56:01,754 --> 00:56:03,847
I was young...

910
00:56:03,922 --> 00:56:06,049
...still just a cub.

911
00:56:06,992 --> 00:56:09,256
Ladies and gentlemen.

912
00:56:09,328 --> 00:56:11,489
Children of all ages.

913
00:56:11,563 --> 00:56:14,896
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!

914
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:18,903
Witness the greatest day
in our young lion's life!

915
00:56:18,971 --> 00:56:22,873
The day he discovers his roar!

916
00:56:22,941 --> 00:56:24,636
Dad, I can't do it!

917
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,200
Now, go!

918
00:56:26,278 --> 00:56:30,180
Listen as Samson
unleashes a roar so mighty,

919
00:56:30,249 --> 00:56:33,707
it launches a wildebeest
clear off the savannah!

920
00:56:38,223 --> 00:56:40,691
Samson! Dig deep!

921
00:56:52,938 --> 00:56:54,428
I should have known.

922
00:56:54,506 --> 00:56:58,567
If you'd been born in the wild,
you'd know how to roar.

923
00:56:58,911 --> 00:56:59,969
Dad?

924
00:57:01,113 --> 00:57:03,707
Dad! Dad!

925
00:57:03,782 --> 00:57:05,716
Please!

926
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,987
Dad.

927
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:13,115
When they shipped me to the zoo,
I never wanted anyone to know

928
00:57:13,192 --> 00:57:17,424
where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.

929
00:57:17,496 --> 00:57:19,589
I should have told you sooner.

930
00:57:19,665 --> 00:57:23,101
But... all those stories you tell?

931
00:57:23,168 --> 00:57:26,069
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

932
00:57:26,138 --> 00:57:29,164
Everything you told me was a lie?

933
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:33,710
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.

934
00:57:34,646 --> 00:57:36,614
Help!

935
00:57:36,715 --> 00:57:38,649
Ryan!

936
00:57:40,285 --> 00:57:42,412
Ryan! Run!

937
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,815
Not so fast, Tigger.

938
00:57:48,494 --> 00:57:50,223
Dad!

939
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:54,065
Ryan!

940
00:57:54,132 --> 00:57:55,565
Dad!

941
00:57:58,003 --> 00:58:00,904
- Help!
- Ryan.

942
00:58:00,973 --> 00:58:02,964
Help! Dad!

943
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:06,101
- Ryan.
- Dad! Help me!

944
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:17,054
What?

945
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:21,349
Wait! What? What? Wait!

946
00:58:21,426 --> 00:58:23,690
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey! Hey! Hey!

947
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:28,225
Get off me!

948
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:30,366
What is goin' on here?

949
00:58:30,435 --> 00:58:34,462
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.

950
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,337
Wait. You guys think I'm a...?

951
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:39,434
<i>- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.</i>

952
00:58:39,511 --> 00:58:41,479
<i>- Ja.
- Roll! Roll!</i>

953
00:58:41,547 --> 00:58:43,640
What the...? Hey!

954
00:58:43,715 --> 00:58:46,377
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!

955
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:48,510
I'll give you something to roll about!

956
00:58:52,057 --> 00:58:54,457
It's a good thing
Bridget didn't see that!

957
00:58:54,526 --> 00:58:57,518
Bridget? Larry! They're gone.

958
00:58:58,597 --> 00:58:59,825
I gotta find them!

959
00:58:59,898 --> 00:59:02,492
No! I gotta find Samson first!

960
00:59:02,568 --> 00:59:04,035
No! First...

961
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,399
Sam. Sam!

962
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:24,713
Bridget! Larry!

963
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:26,553
Oh, Ryan! You're alive!

964
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,616
Good to see you guys.

965
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:31,162
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.

966
00:59:31,229 --> 00:59:33,993
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.

967
00:59:35,767 --> 00:59:37,428
What are you guys doing here?

968
00:59:37,502 --> 00:59:39,766
We came here
with your father to find you.

969
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:43,330
And he's probably out there
right now lookin' for us.

970
00:59:44,509 --> 00:59:46,306
I wish he were.

971
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:49,142
But some of these wildebeests
pushed him off a cliff.

972
00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:50,772
- What?
- What?

973
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:54,250
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.

974
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,219
Oh, Ryan.

975
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:58,552
I'm sorry I got you into this.

976
00:59:58,624 --> 01:00:02,355
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased
with what I brought you.

977
01:00:02,427 --> 01:00:04,895
What's this? Where's the other lion?

978
01:00:04,963 --> 01:00:08,660
Right. Well, I was gonna tell you,
there was this cliff and...

979
01:00:10,135 --> 01:00:13,002
Why are you looking at me like that?

980
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:16,802
That's twice you've been
out of step today, Blag!

981
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:18,137
You klutz.

982
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,872
You know we can't ascend
to the top of the food chain

983
01:00:20,946 --> 01:00:24,006
until we eat a lion!

984
01:00:25,651 --> 01:00:28,643
Well, at least there'll
be enough for my ascension.

985
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,244
What about the rest of us?

986
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:33,155
Step-kick, pivot-kick!

987
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,791
Ouch! I twisted a hoof!

988
01:00:40,866 --> 01:00:44,029
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.

989
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:48,436
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!

990
01:00:51,677 --> 01:00:53,941
Why did I let him go off by himself?

991
01:00:54,012 --> 01:00:58,108
He couldn't catch a cold,
much less his own lunch.

992
01:00:59,718 --> 01:01:01,310
Bet I could catch you.

993
01:01:01,386 --> 01:01:02,717
Please.

994
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:05,916
My natural predator
is fuel inject... What?

995
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:09,256
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!

996
01:01:09,327 --> 01:01:12,660
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?

997
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:15,591
I lost Ryan.

998
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:18,966
There were too many. They just took him.

999
01:01:19,037 --> 01:01:21,699
Who? Who took him?

1000
01:01:21,773 --> 01:01:25,334
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!

1001
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:27,275
They got Larry and Bridget too.

1002
01:01:27,345 --> 01:01:30,610
Couldn't fight, couldn't...

1003
01:01:30,682 --> 01:01:32,274
Come on, Sam. You're a lion.

1004
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,477
You come from a long line of kings.

1005
01:01:34,553 --> 01:01:36,817
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.

1006
01:01:36,888 --> 01:01:38,879
But fighting's in your blood!

1007
01:01:38,957 --> 01:01:42,393
No. I'll never be a real lion.

1008
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:45,362
Wrong! You are a real lion.

1009
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:47,330
Doesn't matter where you're from:

1010
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:50,232
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.

1011
01:01:50,302 --> 01:01:52,236
It's what's in here.

1012
01:01:52,304 --> 01:01:54,602
That determines who you are!

1013
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:57,164
At least, that's what you
always told your son.

1014
01:01:57,242 --> 01:01:59,733
Now he's out there, Sammy,

1015
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:02,837
and he needs you.

1016
01:02:02,914 --> 01:02:05,439
Who else is gonna
teach him how to roar?

1017
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:11,254
That's it, Sammy.

1018
01:02:16,628 --> 01:02:17,890
That's it.

1019
01:02:23,468 --> 01:02:27,199
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.

1020
01:02:27,272 --> 01:02:29,866
Yeah! Nothing's gonna stop us!

1021
01:02:29,941 --> 01:02:33,342
Except that we have no idea
where we're going!

1022
01:02:34,446 --> 01:02:36,107
Follow your instincts.

1023
01:02:36,181 --> 01:02:37,842
Follow your instincts.

1024
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:42,182
- What is that?
- My... instincts?

1025
01:02:46,124 --> 01:02:48,752
- Benny?
- You're almost there.

1026
01:02:50,162 --> 01:02:51,424
That settles it, then.

1027
01:02:51,496 --> 01:02:55,159
My mother definitely drank pool water
when she was pregnant with me.

1028
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:56,757
Benny, look.

1029
01:02:56,835 --> 01:02:59,201
The freaks with hooves!

1030
01:02:59,271 --> 01:03:00,602
Ryan's in there.

1031
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,035
You can't just barge in. That's suicide!

1032
01:03:04,109 --> 01:03:07,636
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.

1033
01:03:07,712 --> 01:03:10,704
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.

1034
01:03:10,782 --> 01:03:14,240
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!

1035
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,516
Fool! You blew our cover!
Men! Scatter!

1036
01:03:18,557 --> 01:03:20,718
Not so fast!

1037
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:24,228
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.

1038
01:03:24,296 --> 01:03:25,661
Who are you guys?

1039
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:28,426
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak. He's Camo.

1040
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,663
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?

1041
01:03:31,736 --> 01:03:34,102
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.

1042
01:03:34,172 --> 01:03:36,265
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.

1043
01:03:36,341 --> 01:03:39,777
It's not like I told them our plan
is to use them to defeat Kazar's...

1044
01:03:39,845 --> 01:03:42,678
Listen, just tell me,
did they take my son in there?

1045
01:03:42,747 --> 01:03:44,544
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.

1046
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:47,847
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!

1047
01:03:47,919 --> 01:03:50,353
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this? Men!

1048
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:53,186
Hey! No! Stop! Sammy!

1049
01:03:53,258 --> 01:03:57,558
- Idiot! That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret. This one's confidential.

1050
01:03:57,629 --> 01:03:59,563
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.

1051
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:03,431
Super-secret.
Top-secret. This is ultra-secret!

1052
01:04:03,501 --> 01:04:04,991
Enough! No more!

1053
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:08,699
Show 'em the super-top-secret
"no more?" Gotcha!

1054
01:04:08,773 --> 01:04:09,797
No!

1055
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:12,974
I got an idea.

1056
01:04:16,848 --> 01:04:19,874
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.

1057
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:22,351
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.

1058
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,854
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.

1059
01:04:25,924 --> 01:04:27,448
Oh, my.

1060
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:43,939
You have got to be kidding me.

1061
01:04:53,084 --> 01:04:55,814
Nigel, I don't know
what you're trying to pull,

1062
01:04:55,887 --> 01:04:57,946
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!

1063
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:00,949
Why, you little...

1064
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:02,721
Silence, again!

1065
01:05:02,794 --> 01:05:06,195
You do not speak to me!

1066
01:05:06,264 --> 01:05:07,697
Nigel, what's the deal?

1067
01:05:07,766 --> 01:05:10,701
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?

1068
01:05:10,769 --> 01:05:14,296
Yes, we shall! What's on the menu?

1069
01:05:14,372 --> 01:05:15,771
Them.

1070
01:05:16,908 --> 01:05:18,432
Oh, no.

1071
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:21,172
Eat friends and be god,
don't eat friends...

1072
01:05:21,246 --> 01:05:23,578
God, friends, god, friends. God, I...

1073
01:05:23,648 --> 01:05:25,240
Well, that was subtle.

1074
01:05:25,317 --> 01:05:26,477
Prepare the meat fire!

1075
01:05:30,155 --> 01:05:31,713
Wait!

1076
01:05:33,658 --> 01:05:36,923
We cannot cook them without...

1077
01:05:38,363 --> 01:05:39,455
...onion!

1078
01:05:39,531 --> 01:05:42,989
Onions. Onions. Onions.

1079
01:05:44,202 --> 01:05:46,102
Well, that was fast.

1080
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:48,298
Let the ritual begin.

1081
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:53,741
Move it!

1082
01:05:53,812 --> 01:05:56,110
I am so mad at you!

1083
01:05:57,248 --> 01:06:01,480
Wait! We also need... hats!

1084
01:06:02,954 --> 01:06:06,583
Do we not have the party hats of death?

1085
01:06:06,658 --> 01:06:08,216
I've got mine!

1086
01:06:08,293 --> 01:06:11,956
And before the feast, we must all...

1087
01:06:12,364 --> 01:06:13,956
What the...?

1088
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,061
...levitate...

1089
01:06:16,134 --> 01:06:17,999
...and spin uncontrollably!

1090
01:06:18,069 --> 01:06:20,663
And feel a bit sick.

1091
01:06:21,573 --> 01:06:22,904
How do I stop this thing?

1092
01:06:22,974 --> 01:06:24,703
- Guys.
- Benny?

1093
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:26,801
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!

1094
01:06:27,712 --> 01:06:29,646
We've got a plan. Follow me.

1095
01:06:29,714 --> 01:06:32,308
- We?
- I can fly!

1096
01:06:32,384 --> 01:06:35,842
Oh, Great Him,
we are humbled by your power.

1097
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,788
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!

1098
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:44,387
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!

1099
01:06:44,462 --> 01:06:46,953
Major malfunction! Abandon ship!

1100
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:58,941
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.

1101
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:01,672
Great Him, it's another miracle!

1102
01:07:01,746 --> 01:07:04,943
You've delivered us a real lion!

1103
01:07:05,016 --> 01:07:07,143
Blag, your luck has turned.

1104
01:07:07,218 --> 01:07:11,552
Thanks to the Great Him,
we shall all ascend tonight.

1105
01:07:11,623 --> 01:07:14,615
Nigel, we've got
to create a distraction.

1106
01:07:15,527 --> 01:07:16,824
Hang on a sec!

1107
01:07:16,895 --> 01:07:19,557
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!

1108
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:22,794
Ready? Stand back...

1109
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:26,462
...as the Great Me attacks the lion

1110
01:07:26,538 --> 01:07:30,065
over 73 times my size!

1111
01:07:33,812 --> 01:07:36,975
Dad? My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!

1112
01:07:37,048 --> 01:07:38,845
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!

1113
01:07:42,787 --> 01:07:44,254
Whack, whack, whack!

1114
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:45,721
- Dad!
- What? Ryan!

1115
01:07:47,325 --> 01:07:50,089
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!

1116
01:07:54,933 --> 01:07:58,164
At long last,
the cosmic balance has shifted.

1117
01:07:58,236 --> 01:08:01,034
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!

1118
01:08:01,106 --> 01:08:03,006
And predator has become prey!

1119
01:08:03,074 --> 01:08:05,702
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!

1120
01:08:05,777 --> 01:08:08,610
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies

1121
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,807
who's at the top of the food chain!

1122
01:08:12,617 --> 01:08:15,085
Let's eat the brat first.

1123
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:18,412
Over my dead body!

1124
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:33,864
Yeah.

1125
01:08:35,406 --> 01:08:36,998
Dad!

1126
01:08:40,478 --> 01:08:43,106
He's gonna kill Samson
if we don't do something!

1127
01:08:43,181 --> 01:08:45,877
Why don't we use the secret play?

1128
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:49,716
I know. Shut up, Larry. That's stupid.

1129
01:08:49,787 --> 01:08:52,119
No! It's brilliant!

1130
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:54,954
They laughed at me
when I spoke of the Omen.

1131
01:08:55,026 --> 01:08:58,655
But look who's laughing now!

1132
01:09:04,202 --> 01:09:07,069
Little to the left. Yeah.
No! Little to the right!

1133
01:09:07,138 --> 01:09:09,902
Next floor: Bottom of the food chain!

1134
01:09:10,141 --> 01:09:11,540
Ding!

1135
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,604
Fire!

1136
01:09:20,885 --> 01:09:23,547
We gotta find something bigger!

1137
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:26,089
I know where we can
find something bigger.

1138
01:09:29,827 --> 01:09:32,125
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!

1139
01:09:32,197 --> 01:09:33,824
You should have stayed at home.

1140
01:09:33,898 --> 01:09:37,163
Now our shrine will become your tomb.

1141
01:09:37,235 --> 01:09:38,600
Fire!

1142
01:09:45,977 --> 01:09:47,842
Ryan!

1143
01:09:49,214 --> 01:09:50,203
Ryan!

1144
01:09:52,183 --> 01:09:54,276
I don't typically eat dessert

1145
01:09:54,352 --> 01:09:56,479
before the main course!

1146
01:09:56,988 --> 01:09:59,582
Get away from my son!

1147
01:10:09,033 --> 01:10:10,193
Ryan.

1148
01:10:16,808 --> 01:10:20,005
Ryan, are you still with me?

1149
01:10:20,078 --> 01:10:24,276
It's OK, Dad. I just want you to know

1150
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:28,911
I'm sorry you didn't have a father
like the one I have.

1151
01:10:28,987 --> 01:10:30,648
Ryan.

1152
01:10:33,324 --> 01:10:35,155
How touching.

1153
01:10:35,226 --> 01:10:38,059
But then, last words usually are.

1154
01:10:40,231 --> 01:10:41,459
Finish them.

1155
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:51,899
What are you doing?

1156
01:10:51,976 --> 01:10:55,776
I command you to attack them,
like true predators!

1157
01:10:55,847 --> 01:10:59,180
We're tired of pretending
to be something we're not.

1158
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:03,380
But most of all, we're tired of you.

1159
01:11:06,724 --> 01:11:09,318
Blag. Fine.

1160
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:11,294
I'll kill them myself!

1161
01:11:16,834 --> 01:11:20,326
Dad, remember what you
always told me in your stories:

1162
01:11:20,405 --> 01:11:21,804
Dig deep.

1163
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:43,325
Oh, yeah, baby!

1164
01:12:05,383 --> 01:12:06,714
Let's go.

1165
01:12:06,784 --> 01:12:08,877
Yeah.

1166
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:11,513
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!

1167
01:12:11,589 --> 01:12:15,286
And for the record,
I've always hated your choreography.

1168
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,193
It's so... '80s.

1169
01:12:20,198 --> 01:12:21,597
That's right! Run!

1170
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:24,191
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!

1171
01:12:24,268 --> 01:12:26,259
I will hunt you down!

1172
01:12:28,673 --> 01:12:30,504
Everyone! To the boat!

1173
01:12:30,575 --> 01:12:32,338
Top of the food chain, Ma!

1174
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:35,709
Top of the food chain...

1175
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:39,716
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!
I'm so cuddly! I like you!</i>

1176
01:12:39,784 --> 01:12:42,150
<i>I'm so cuddly! I like you!
I'm so cuddly!</i>

1177
01:12:50,762 --> 01:12:53,060
Hurry! We're never gonna make it!

1178
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:55,861
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters! Push!

1179
01:12:56,968 --> 01:13:00,267
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!

1180
01:13:11,749 --> 01:13:15,276
At least I saw the wild
before it disappeared.

1181
01:13:15,353 --> 01:13:17,844
I can still see it. It's right...

1182
01:13:17,922 --> 01:13:20,857
Here. I found my roar.

1183
01:13:21,392 --> 01:13:23,917
We both did, son.

1184
01:13:24,629 --> 01:13:28,998
You know, Dad, this'll be our first
story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.

1185
01:13:29,066 --> 01:13:31,330
I don't think anybody's
gonna believe it.

1186
01:13:34,272 --> 01:13:36,240
Incoming!

1187
01:13:41,446 --> 01:13:43,573
<i>I'm so cuddly!</i>

1188
01:13:43,648 --> 01:13:46,776
<i>Cuddly! I'm so cuddly!</i>

1189
01:13:46,851 --> 01:13:49,843
I know you're cuddly. But can you float?

1190
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:54,849
<i>- I'm having a
- Really nice day</i>

1191
01:13:54,926 --> 01:13:56,791
<i>Really nice day
Really nice day</i>

1192
01:13:56,861 --> 01:13:58,795
Step-kick left!

1193
01:13:58,863 --> 01:14:00,558
<i>Really nice day</i>

1194
01:14:00,631 --> 01:14:01,620
Step-kick right!

1195
01:14:02,934 --> 01:14:05,334
- Splendid.
- No! Smashing. Hey!

1196
01:14:05,403 --> 01:14:07,803
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?

1197
01:14:07,872 --> 01:14:10,067
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.

1198
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:13,008
Hey, look, everyone! I'm a secret agent!

1199
01:14:14,779 --> 01:14:17,805
Bridget, I get it. You're more
than a tall, lanky goddess.

1200
01:14:17,882 --> 01:14:19,941
You're a strong, independent female.

1201
01:14:20,017 --> 01:14:22,542
You don't need to be defined
by your relationship

1202
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,918
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.

1203
01:14:27,992 --> 01:14:29,459
What was that?

1204
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:33,429
Just your daily dose
of vitamin Bridget, baby.

1205
01:14:33,498 --> 01:14:35,056
Oh, yeah yeah!

1206
01:14:35,132 --> 01:14:36,793
<i>Really nice day
Really nice day</i>

1207
01:14:36,868 --> 01:14:37,857
Look out!

1208
01:14:40,872 --> 01:14:43,238
Step-kick, pivot-kick,
walk, walk, walk.

1209
01:14:43,307 --> 01:14:46,674
Yes! Did y'all see that? Check this!

1210
01:14:46,744 --> 01:14:49,975
Go, Blag! Go, Blag! Go, Blag!

1211
01:14:50,047 --> 01:14:51,878
Hey, Blag.

1212
01:14:51,949 --> 01:14:55,441
- No parkin' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?

1213
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,782
Dad?

1214
01:14:56,854 --> 01:14:59,345
Make some room there, big guy!

1215
01:15:00,992 --> 01:15:03,483
<i>Really nice day
Really, really nice day</i>

1216
01:15:03,561 --> 01:15:05,722
Yeah!

1217
01:15:06,497 --> 01:15:09,864
Pretty crazy, right? Pretty wild!

1218
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:14,934
Well, technically, it...

1219
01:15:15,006 --> 01:15:17,372
It's awesome.

1220
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:19,739
Yes, right.

1221
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:22,711
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on! Everyone!

1222
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:28,710
This is gonna be a long ride home.

1223
01:15:28,786 --> 01:15:30,344
<i>I'm havin' a</i>

1224
01:15:30,421 --> 01:15:34,414
<i>Really nice day
Really nice day, really nice day</i>

1225
01:15:34,492 --> 01:15:37,393
<i>- I'm having a

1226
01:15:37,461 --> 01:15:38,928
<i>G'day</i>

1227
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:44,726
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?

1228
01:15:44,802 --> 01:15:46,394
Just get out.

1229
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:48,404
Sorry about that, everybody. Sorry.

1230
01:15:48,472 --> 01:15:49,905
Hello.

1231
01:15:50,942 --> 01:15:52,603
Do carry on.

1232
01:16:25,876 --> 01:16:27,468
Come on!

1233
01:21:20,137 --> 01:21:23,072
All right,
everybody exit in an orderly...

1234
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:25,165
All right, single file! Keep it...

1235
01:21:26,977 --> 01:21:30,344
I seem to do a lot of falling
and screaming in this adventure.
