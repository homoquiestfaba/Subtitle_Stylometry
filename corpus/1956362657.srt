1
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,204
You feel strong.

2
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,081
You feel calm.

3
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,375
There is no fear in your heart.

4
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,918
Look across at your brothers...

5
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,383
and see me in their eyes.

6
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:20,468
You are all like sons to me.

7
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,938
I am with you.

8
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,071
God is with you.

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,530
Paradise awaits you.

10
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,610
God is great.

11
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,695
VT station. Quickly.

12
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,368
Cafe Lilopal, quick.

13
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,293
Yes, Brother.

14
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,712
We're leaving now.

15
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,840
You know the Taj Hotel?

16
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,161
Your sister didn't come. Again.

17
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,415
She's at home with the flu.

18
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,199
Sorry.

19
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,242
How late are you?

20
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,125
Very.

21
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,789
Get some rest and
I'll see you in the morning.

22
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,435
It's okay my darling.
It's okay.

23
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,601
Why are you crying?

24
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,813
Why are you crying?

25
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,668
Look around you, my brothers.

26
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,975
Look at all they've stolen...

27
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,012
From your fathers.

28
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,804
From your grandfathers.

29
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,477
Remember your training.

30
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,311
Don't draw
attention to yourselves.

31
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,397
Don't be late
to your destinations.

32
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,034
Timing is critical.

33
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,319
Start with the
train station first.

34
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,116
All other targets
within the next 30 minutes.

35
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,251
Remember, the whole
world will be watching.

36
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,067
Ajmal?

37
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,331
- Ajmal, where are you?
- I'm in the toilet come quickly.

38
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,269
Ajmal?

39
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,599
Coming! Coming!

40
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,627
Behind the car!

41
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,346
We'll kill these fuckers.

42
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,389
All of them!

43
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,317
Let's go!

44
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,486
Kill the bastards!
Kill them all.

45
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,891
I'll take the one...

46
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,018
with curly hair.

47
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,324
Yes, she's sexy.

48
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,146
And...

49
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,454
also...

50
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,414
The tall one.

51
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,451
What did he say?
Give him the phone.

52
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,990
Are you fucking blind?

53
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,292
You didn't see me coming?!
You didn't see?!

54
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,077
Who drives like this?!

55
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,539
You can't see straight!
You jumped in front of my car!

56
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,462
So what, you'd run me over?!

57
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,800
What's your problem?!

58
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,326
There's been an attack.
Is the hotel safe?!

59
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,618
Yes, of course.

60
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:13,951
So everything is okay there?

61
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,786
Yes, sir. All okay here.

62
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,342
Have you ever seen such a place?

63
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,303
Imran...

64
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,802
It's just a hotel.

65
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,354
It looks like paradise.

66
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:02,982
Let's unpack here.

67
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,897
A bit further back.

68
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,613
The girls are
in my suite already?

69
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:10,528
Okay.

70
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:14,204
Start without me,
and I'll be up after dinner.

71
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:45,522
Phase one is complete, Brother.

72
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,311
We're moving upstairs.

73
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:48,983
Well done,
you've done good work.

74
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,399
One thing...

75
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,574
Keep your
phone on at all times.

76
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,976
I want to hear their
cries with my own ears.

77
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:59,415
These animals have no humanity,
Abdullah, remember this.

78
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:00,658
Yes Brother.

79
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,991
None of them
deserve Allah's mercy.

80
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:04,907
Yes Brother. God is great.

81
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:06,707
God is great.

82
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,277
Where is she?

83
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,241
She's here somewhere.

84
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,649
I saw her come in.

85
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:49,527
Houssam?

86
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:52,241
Houssam, come here!
Look at this.

87
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:55,198
Look, they have a
machine to flush their shit.

88
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,415
Even shitting is fun.

89
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:00,078
Imran?

90
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,381
Hello, Brother.

91
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,588
Imran! What's happening?

92
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,757
I've just finished
killing another woman.

93
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:08,628
Well done.

94
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,934
Now listen...
I have to tell you something.

95
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,220
Yes, Brother?

96
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,514
Stand them up in
a doorway next time.

97
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:18,346
So when the bullet goes through
their heads, it goes outside.

98
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,892
You don't want it ricocheting
back into the room.

99
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,313
Okay?

100
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:23,524
Okay, Brother. Okay.

101
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,774
There are a few
people gathered downstairs,

102
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:27,686
throw some grenades at them.

103
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:29,865
There's no harm in throwing
a few grenades, my brother.

104
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:30,653
Grenades?

105
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:31,566
Yes! Yes!

106
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:32,947
Yes, Brother.

107
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,620
We will give them a surprise.

108
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:36,118
Throw some grenades.

109
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,289
Okay, okay, Brother.

110
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,327
What did he say?

111
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,080
He said "Throw the grenades."

112
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:42,422
Yeah, we've got some.
Let's throw them.

113
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:20,491
Rashid!

114
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,071
Try this.

115
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,902
What is it?

116
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,566
It's very tasty, try it.

117
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:25,625
You ate this?!

118
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,237
Go on, try it.

119
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:29,415
You moron!

120
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,374
This is pork, throw it away!

121
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:33,544
Spit! Spit! Spit!

122
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,501
Do you need water?

123
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,095
Take it, take it.

124
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:40,589
May Allah forgive you.

125
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,846
You dumbass, they're vegetables.

126
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:54,814
Watch.

127
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:57,615
Eat it.

128
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,281
Fucking asshole.

129
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:01,527
Why are you getting angry?

130
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:02,648
Go away.

131
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:03,904
Imran, I was just kidding!

132
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,236
Get fucked.

133
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,070
- We need to go upstairs!
- I'll go from the other end.

134
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,576
Imran, come back, buddy.

135
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:28,298
Papa will come home
and we'll play together.

136
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:30,554
It's okay, Seva.

137
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,261
It's okay.

138
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:33,853
It's okay...

139
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,257
It's okay.

140
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:15,347
Get them back!

141
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:18,315
Hey, cameras back! Go back!

142
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:21,811
Cameras get back! Get them back!
Get them back now!

143
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:38,704
I've got four men.

144
00:43:38,744 --> 00:43:40,164
- Only four?
- Yes.

145
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:42,042
We have to do something.

146
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,536
Special Forces are hours away,
they're still in Delhi.

147
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,503
- Still in Delhi?!
- Yes.

148
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,842
And we have orders to
stand down until they arrive.

149
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,673
We have to do something...

150
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,585
The CCTV room is
on the second floor.

151
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:56,336
So?

152
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:57,467
So?!

153
00:43:58,013 --> 00:43:59,313
We'll go up there!

154
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:02,596
We'll see their positions!
We can't just wait here.

155
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:25,872
If we just stand here...

156
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,173
there won't be anyone left.

157
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:12,325
God is watching
over you my child.

158
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:15,036
Close your eyes,
let's pray together.

159
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,423
Prayers?

160
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:19,344
What good have prayers
ever done us, Mother?

161
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:21,089
What can I say?

162
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:22,511
I'm worried about you.

163
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:30,426
I love you. I'll pray for you.

164
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:32,886
I'll call you.

165
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,445
Okay, my dear.

166
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:35,012
Call 409.

167
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:38,675
Hurry up and call 409!

168
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:51,651
Call 409.

169
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:53,987
Call 409!

170
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,409
Call!

171
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:48,322
Hands up.

172
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:50,026
Keep your hands up.

173
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,367
Who are you?

174
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:57,619
Please, I have a family!

175
01:05:58,667 --> 01:05:59,537
He's clean.

176
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:00,845
We're police.

177
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:02,798
This area is not safe, go back.

178
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:05,511
CCTV room, where is it?!

179
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:08,299
Where is the CCTV room?

180
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:10,928
CCTV room? Tell me!

181
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:12,557
Tell me!

182
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:22,109
Move. Move. Move.

183
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:29,111
Hang on, Brother. I'll check.

184
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:34,295
Seems Chinese.

185
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:36,082
Could be Japanese.

186
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:39,206
But she's dressed
like an American.

187
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:42,628
Good, we want Americans.
But alive next time.

188
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,460
We need rich hostages.
Important hostages.

189
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:48,303
No passport, no wallet. Nothing.

190
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:50,139
Check her bra.

191
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:54,894
Put your hand in
her bra and check there.

192
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:07,606
No, I'm so sorry Brother...

193
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:10,741
I can't touch her there.

194
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:13,783
She's an infidel.
It's not a sin.

195
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:15,158
Check.

196
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:24,093
Imran, check now.

197
01:07:50,904 --> 01:07:51,704
Get Up!

198
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:52,408
Up!

199
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:56,237
Hands up! Hands up!

200
01:07:56,577 --> 01:07:57,867
Hands up! Hands up!

201
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:00,247
Turn around! Turn that way!

202
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:01,959
Turn that way!

203
01:08:04,543 --> 01:08:05,633
Hurry up!

204
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:10,762
I've got a white boy.
Chinese girl's boyfriend.

205
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:14,177
Well done, Imran.
Take him to the suite.

206
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:16,933
And find more hostages.
Important looking hostages.

207
01:08:16,972 --> 01:08:18,312
This way, this way!

208
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:20,524
Inshallah, Brother.

209
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:23,603
Are you deaf, asshole?
I'll fuck you up!

210
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,030
Right! Right!

211
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:13,903
You don't understand
left and right?!

212
01:09:15,822 --> 01:09:17,992
Yes, I'm here. Open the door.

213
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:29,423
Stay quiet.

214
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:34,218
This way, this is the room.

215
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:37,715
Go.

216
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:39,260
Go!

217
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:10,748
- They're just boys.
- Hello?

218
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:12,214
- Hello sir.
- Yes, Patel?

219
01:10:12,254 --> 01:10:13,424
We've reached the CCTV room.

220
01:10:13,964 --> 01:10:15,674
There's only two of us left.

221
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:16,716
Send more men.

222
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:20,507
I can't, there's
too many VIPs inside.

223
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:23,138
We've got orders to
wait for Special Forces.

224
01:10:27,644 --> 01:10:28,694
Where is this room?

225
01:11:25,118 --> 01:11:26,408
Colaba Police.

226
01:11:26,787 --> 01:11:27,497
Open up.

227
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:48,934
Mohit Singh.

228
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:52,229
Colaba Police, open up.

229
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:59,107
We are here to save you.

230
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:02,361
There's another one!

231
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:04,196
Main lobby.

232
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:08,449
There's the Chambers Lounge,
there are many people there.

233
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:49,286
Open up, motherfuckers.

234
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:02,264
How many people are in there?!

235
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:04,129
At least fifty,
could be more by now.

236
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:06,138
Fifty people?

237
01:13:16,647 --> 01:13:17,897
How many bullets do you have?

238
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,020
Six.

239
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:19,816
You?

240
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:21,322
Same.

241
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,280
Open up!

242
01:13:23,612 --> 01:13:25,492
Open up, fuckers!

243
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:31,451
None of you will be spared!

244
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:38,459
Stay here and
lock the door, okay?

245
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:15,583
Open up, motherfuckers!

246
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:33,104
It's just one guy. Get ready.

247
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:37,852
Abdullah?

248
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:40,689
Abdullah? What is it?

249
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:42,404
There's two more!

250
01:14:44,818 --> 01:14:46,528
There are people in there.
I heard noises.

251
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:47,700
We've got to shoot them.

252
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:48,608
Kill them all.

253
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:49,985
No, no, no.

254
01:14:50,032 --> 01:14:50,992
Shoot!

255
01:15:12,137 --> 01:15:14,307
- They have gone this side.
- Houssam, be careful.

256
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,175
Are they behind us?!

257
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:20,062
I don't know.

258
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,621
Doctor? We need a medic please.

259
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:54,895
Hey, Houssam...

260
01:15:56,431 --> 01:16:00,561
Do you believe the Bull will
give the money to our families?

261
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:08,146
Imran, we're in
service of Allah...

262
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,150
Nothing else matters.

263
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:15,495
The Bull says we need
more hostages, let's go.

264
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:18,411
His leg is hurt,
it's hard for him to walk.

265
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:19,753
What happened?

266
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:22,961
It's just a scratch.
Houssam, you go too.

267
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:24,415
Take care.

268
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:25,629
Imran...

269
01:16:26,128 --> 01:16:28,338
Keep an eye on
the American, okay?

270
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:31,377
Alright, good.

271
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:04,997
Hello?

272
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:06,752
Father! Father, it's Imran.

273
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:09,673
Imran? Thank God. Thank God.

274
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,760
Jamilla!
Jamilla, it's your brother.

275
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:18,349
How's your
training going, Imran?

276
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:21,852
Training is going well, Father.

277
01:17:21,892 --> 01:17:24,192
Father, I called to say...

278
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:28,726
Father I love you so much,
I love you all so much...

279
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:33,821
We all love you very much.
Your mother misses you a lot.

280
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:37,316
You're making us
all proud, my son.

281
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:41,794
Father, I wanted to ask, did
they give you the money yet?

282
01:17:42,454 --> 01:17:44,624
No, not yet my child.

283
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:46,335
No money yet.

284
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:49,465
But don't worry, these
are very noble men of Allah.

285
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:51,708
Very good people.

286
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:55,299
Father, make sure you
get the money from them.

287
01:17:55,342 --> 01:17:58,432
They swore it on the Holy Quran.

288
01:17:58,762 --> 01:18:01,262
Father, give my love
to Jamilla and Mother.

289
01:18:01,306 --> 01:18:02,556
- Father.
- Imran?

290
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:06,018
- Father... Father... Father
- Imran, are you there? Imran?

291
01:23:23,378 --> 01:23:24,458
Go that way.

292
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:25,958
Go that way!

293
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:28,379
Go that way!

294
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:30,638
Go back!

295
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:40,308
Hey!

296
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,021
Shut up and move.

297
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:47,688
Rashid, what's going on?

298
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,450
I got two more, Brother.
High rollers.

299
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:53,993
Good. Put them with the others.

300
01:23:54,743 --> 01:23:57,703
Later, you'll line
them up by the windows.

301
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:01,289
And blow their brains out
for all the cameras below.

302
01:24:17,307 --> 01:24:18,097
Go!

303
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:19,675
Get down!

304
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,100
Get down!

305
01:24:23,146 --> 01:24:24,436
Stop! Get down!

306
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:25,648
Get down!

307
01:24:32,322 --> 01:24:33,572
Tie him up.

308
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:47,304
Hands behind your back.

309
01:24:48,672 --> 01:24:50,762
Whoah. Gently, gently.
Just her hands...

310
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:01,597
She look local?

311
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:00,287
Who is Brother Bull?

312
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,159
You can do whatever
you want to me.

313
01:26:04,665 --> 01:26:06,215
I don't know.

314
01:26:07,835 --> 01:26:09,215
Brother Bull...

315
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:11,548
what did he ask you to do?

316
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:14,593
He said...

317
01:26:15,259 --> 01:26:16,799
"You are Muslims."

318
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:19,716
"The infidels defraud you."

319
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:21,925
"They left you in poverty."

320
01:26:23,141 --> 01:26:25,481
"They left you behind,
as they went ahead."

321
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:27,478
"Go."

322
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:29,563
"Do Jihad."

323
01:26:30,357 --> 01:26:31,777
"Go and do Jihad."

324
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:54,758
Call him again.

325
01:27:39,009 --> 01:27:41,469
What was your plan?
Where were you going next?

326
01:27:41,803 --> 01:27:43,563
We were going to die.

327
01:27:57,945 --> 01:27:59,825
His phone is off.

328
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:16,304
Houssam and I were just outside.
We're here now.

329
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:18,469
Yes, we already lit the fire.

330
01:28:19,675 --> 01:28:21,015
Okay, I'll ask.

331
01:28:24,513 --> 01:28:25,813
What's your name?

332
01:28:26,056 --> 01:28:27,266
What's your name?

333
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:31,312
What? What's your name?

334
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:33,192
Tell me! Speak!

335
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:34,900
- What's your name?
- I don't understand.

336
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,320
What, asshole? What?

337
01:28:36,358 --> 01:28:37,148
Abdullah...

338
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:38,072
Yes?

339
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:39,240
Ask him in English.

340
01:28:39,903 --> 01:28:41,743
Ask him. "What is your name?"

341
01:28:43,156 --> 01:28:44,026
What?

342
01:28:50,497 --> 01:28:51,157
Tell him.

343
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:00,473
Asshole.

344
01:29:00,924 --> 01:29:04,514
I'm sorry Brother, I don't
understand. It's a long name.

345
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:07,929
That's alright, Abdullah. Check
his pockets, check his wallet.

346
01:29:08,765 --> 01:29:11,015
Check everywhere,
you will find something.

347
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:11,809
Okay, Brother.

348
01:29:12,144 --> 01:29:12,944
Hold this.

349
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:14,900
Check his pockets.

350
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:24,110
What's all this?

351
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:28,540
Yes sir, this is Houssam.

352
01:29:28,577 --> 01:29:29,237
Yes Houssam?

353
01:29:29,661 --> 01:29:31,791
We found his
wallet and passport.

354
01:29:32,164 --> 01:29:34,044
Send me a photo of it.

355
01:29:34,082 --> 01:29:35,382
Just a second.

356
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:37,417
Good, we will
run a check on him.

357
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:38,551
Sending it now.

358
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:42,219
Don't touch it.

359
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:45,184
Fuck off!

360
01:29:46,762 --> 01:29:48,052
Fucking peasants.

361
01:29:56,688 --> 01:29:57,518
You dog!

362
01:29:57,564 --> 01:29:58,524
Spit on me!

363
01:29:58,565 --> 01:29:59,065
Spit on me!

364
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,113
Just try, you dog!

365
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:02,443
Spit on me!

366
01:30:02,903 --> 01:30:03,533
Spit on me!

367
01:30:05,072 --> 01:30:06,362
You, stay down!

368
01:30:09,535 --> 01:30:11,545
Heads down! Heads down!

369
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:15,539
- Houssam?
- Yes?

370
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:17,538
What's that noise,
what's happening?

371
01:30:18,085 --> 01:30:21,055
Abdullah, he's gone mad!
He broke the Russian's ribs!

372
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:24,007
- Put the Russian on.
- Okay, Okay.

373
01:30:27,928 --> 01:30:28,968
Speak to him.

374
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:16,847
Put Abdullah on.

375
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:20,903
Yes Brother?

376
01:31:20,939 --> 01:31:21,859
What are you doing?!

377
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:23,649
He spat in my face, Okay?

378
01:31:23,692 --> 01:31:25,322
Abdullah, calm down.

379
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:27,744
This is not the
time to get angry.

380
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:30,530
These people are
not important anymore.

381
01:31:32,117 --> 01:31:35,787
CNN just showed that Special
Forces have landed in Mumbai.

382
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:39,540
You should be clear-headed
about what to do next.

383
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:41,752
- Understand?
- Yeah...

384
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:44,419
- Yes, Brother!
- Yes! Yes, Brother Bull.

385
01:31:45,589 --> 01:31:46,549
Abdullah...

386
01:31:47,132 --> 01:31:48,382
It's time.

387
01:31:48,967 --> 01:31:51,967
From Mumbai to Washington,
let them hear their screams...

388
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:54,561
as we've heard
our Muslim brothers scream.

389
01:31:54,598 --> 01:31:55,928
God is great, Brother.

390
01:31:58,143 --> 01:31:59,103
Listen.

391
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:01,354
Brother is saying, it's time.

392
01:32:01,813 --> 01:32:03,023
All praise to Allah!

393
01:32:05,108 --> 01:32:07,188
Imran, you stay here.

394
01:32:07,236 --> 01:32:09,486
Keep an eye on them.
If anyone moves...

395
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:12,991
Anyone moves,
you shoot them. Okay?

396
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:21,621
Stay down!

397
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:23,417
Stay down!

398
01:32:24,962 --> 01:32:27,262
Don't you understand?!
Get down or I'll shoot you!

399
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:19,395
Brother says we must light
every corner of the hotel.

400
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:55,416
Quiet!

401
01:35:55,464 --> 01:35:56,514
Quiet!

402
01:35:56,548 --> 01:35:57,378
Quiet!

403
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:03,597
Be quiet, or I'll shoot you!

404
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:04,349
Quiet!

405
01:37:24,887 --> 01:37:26,467
Get to the Chambers lounge!

406
01:37:26,763 --> 01:37:28,353
A lot of people are escaping!

407
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:29,850
Sisterfuckers, sons of pigs.

408
01:37:29,892 --> 01:37:30,772
Hurry, go now!

409
01:37:30,809 --> 01:37:32,309
Yes, Brother! Yes!

410
01:37:32,686 --> 01:37:35,436
Go upstairs!
People are escaping!

411
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:37,769
Yes, Brother.

412
01:37:38,442 --> 01:37:40,112
Yes, understood. I'm going now.

413
01:37:47,826 --> 01:37:49,446
- Hello Brother.
- Imran.

414
01:37:49,745 --> 01:37:51,335
Many people are escaping
from the Chambers Lounge.

415
01:37:51,371 --> 01:37:52,121
What?

416
01:37:52,623 --> 01:37:53,753
Get to the Chambers
Lounge, right now.

417
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:56,383
Chamber Lounge...

418
01:37:56,418 --> 01:37:58,208
Okay, what about the hostages?

419
01:37:58,253 --> 01:37:59,673
Kill them all.

420
01:38:00,714 --> 01:38:01,674
Okay, Brother.

421
01:39:30,095 --> 01:39:33,515
There is no God but Allah...

422
01:39:34,183 --> 01:39:36,813
Allah the kind,
Allah the gentle...

423
01:39:37,394 --> 01:39:38,314
Hey witch!

424
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,227
How do you know this verse?!

425
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:43,320
There is no God but Allah...

426
01:39:47,905 --> 01:39:49,455
Shut up... Shut up...

427
01:39:49,698 --> 01:39:51,028
Shut up.

428
01:39:51,074 --> 01:39:52,784
Shut up or I'll shoot you!

429
01:39:56,413 --> 01:39:58,293
How do you know this verse?!

430
01:39:58,332 --> 01:39:59,962
How do you know it?!

431
01:40:02,044 --> 01:40:03,344
Shut up! Shut up!

432
01:40:08,217 --> 01:40:09,377
Shut up!

433
01:40:09,718 --> 01:40:11,758
Shut up or I'll shoot you!
I will shoot you!

434
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:13,179
I'll shoot you,
I'll shoot you...

435
01:40:13,889 --> 01:40:15,599
Imran, talk to me.

436
01:40:15,641 --> 01:40:17,731
Is it done?
Have you killed them?

437
01:40:17,768 --> 01:40:20,018
No Brother...
One of them is Muslim.

438
01:40:20,062 --> 01:40:21,652
One of them is Muslim.

439
01:40:21,688 --> 01:40:23,188
It's okay if he's Muslim.

440
01:40:23,607 --> 01:40:24,607
Finish him off.

441
01:40:26,485 --> 01:40:28,575
Focus on your mission.
Finish him off.

442
01:40:30,072 --> 01:40:33,532
It's a woman, she's performing
Salah. She's performing Salah!

443
01:40:33,575 --> 01:40:35,485
Eyes down! Eyes down!

444
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:40,250
Shoot her, Imran. Shoot her!

445
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:44,382
God willing this is also a
good deed. Just shoot her.

446
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:46,590
Imran, shoot her!

447
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:53,010
Close your eyes!
I'll kill you!

448
01:40:53,053 --> 01:40:54,553
I'll kill you!
Close your eyes!

449
01:40:54,596 --> 01:40:55,556
Eyes down!

450
01:40:55,597 --> 01:40:56,347
Eyes down!

451
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,350
Imran!?

452
01:41:01,562 --> 01:41:02,402
Imran?

453
01:43:01,098 --> 01:43:03,388
It's blocked.
Let's go further up.

454
01:43:52,107 --> 01:43:54,027
This is it. This is it.

455
01:43:55,903 --> 01:43:56,903
Abdullah!

456
01:43:56,945 --> 01:43:58,565
Get back. I'll teach them...

457
01:44:36,235 --> 01:44:37,155
Brothers!

458
01:44:58,632 --> 01:45:00,382
- Rashid, get back!
- They've gone this way!

459
01:49:30,737 --> 01:49:31,567
Stop.

460
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:34,616
Stop, or we'll shoot you!

461
01:50:15,574 --> 01:50:17,784
Allah awaits you.

462
01:50:17,826 --> 01:50:20,616
For Allah's sake,
you must not retreat.

463
01:50:35,844 --> 01:50:36,764
Houssam?!

464
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:37,803
Give me a magazine!

465
01:50:38,388 --> 01:50:39,928
I'm out. I'm out.

466
01:50:51,944 --> 01:50:53,864
Be brave, my lions.

467
01:50:53,904 --> 01:50:56,034
The whole world is watching you.

468
01:50:56,073 --> 01:50:58,373
Allah awaits you in paradise.

469
01:50:59,117 --> 01:51:01,287
Keep your phones on...

470
01:51:01,328 --> 01:51:04,618
so the whole
world can hear you roar.

471
01:51:19,012 --> 01:51:20,432
All glory to Allah!

472
01:51:20,472 --> 01:51:21,312
God is great!
