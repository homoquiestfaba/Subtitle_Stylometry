3
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,285
Terri!

4
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,206
You clean up the tub ring?

5
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,876
I'm still in here, Uncle James.

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,712
Did you? Last night you
said you'd clean it up.

7
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,676
I can't clean it because
I'm still in here, okay?

8
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,681
You'll be late
for school, Terri.

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,559
Do you want me to go to school or
do you want me to clean the tub,

10
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,644
because I can't do both.

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,607
I'm hungry.
You cook us up some steaks.

12
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,235
No. Those are
for dinner, okay?

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,657
How about I make us some beans on toast?
How's that sound?

14
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,983
Hey, guys, come on.
Let's go.

15
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,526
Why didn't you pass it to me?

16
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,153
Go.
All right.

17
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,115
Yeah, wait up.

18
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,331
Zach, wait up!

19
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,556
Hey, slow down!

20
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,162
For all you people who
want to blame the camera

21
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,915
for your bad yearbook picture,
recent freshman's shot.

22
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,085
But don't look for us, though.

23
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,045
Because we nailed our pictures!

24
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,422
Yeah! I know I did!

25
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,215
Until tomorrow, peace!
Peace!

26
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,134
Peace.

27
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,887
All right, people, I got a
couple of announcements to make.

28
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,516
Want to remind you that those
large, round, metal receptacles

29
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,976
you see around campus?

30
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,769
They're for trash.
Use them.

31
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,856
Hey!
National Honor Society essays

32
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,233
and applications deadline
is next Wednesday.

33
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,401
You can give them to me,

34
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,819
or there's a designated box...
Yo.

35
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,821
In the main office.
Trash heap.

36
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,323
You know this?
The Pioneers will be playing

37
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,491
three away games this month
and the team needs drivers.

38
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,617
You know this.

39
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,244
Shit is old school.
And if anyone's parent can volunteer,

40
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,495
please have them contact...

41
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,456
Old school?
Hip-hop.

42
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,708
Go Pioneers!

43
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,295
Rappers get all the pussy.
We're instituting a no-tolerance policy...

44
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,921
against cell phones.
Okay.

45
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,591
If you're found texting or...
Yes, Terri.

46
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,676
May I go to the restroom,
please?

47
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,763
You just got here.
Absolutely not.

48
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,098
If you're found texting or
using your phone in class,

49
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,226
phone will be confiscated and returned
to you at the end of the school day.

50
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,271
You may use the phone
during nutrition and lunch.

51
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,731
You know about eating pussy, right?
The library

52
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,984
will be closed intermittently next
week while construction's going on.

53
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,986
And if your study hall
is being relocated,

54
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,237
there will be a notice
posted by the door.

55
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,281
Why are you doing this?

56
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,116
We're all aware of the false...

57
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,202
Players be choking
to death on the pussy.

58
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,703
Disruptions to the entire
school, as well as...

59
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,580
Okay, I get it. Okay?

60
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,667
Do not take it lightly and, then,
the authorities will not either.

61
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,961
You know about
eating butt holes, right?

62
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,172
- I said I get it!
- Terri!

63
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,384
Chill out, titty-balls. Damn!

64
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,135
Titty-balls.

65
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,639
Has reminded me to ask you not
to leave food in your lockers.

66
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,642
Mr. Ribis, I see you brought
a hat to school today.

67
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,768
Yes, I did, sir.

68
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,353
You know that I collect hats.

69
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,358
I have a large collection.

70
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,195
If you would like your hat
to stay yours and not mine,

71
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,157
I suggest you put it in your
backpack and keep it there.

72
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,700
Go to class, Mr. Ribis.

73
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,452
You got it,
Mr. Fitzgerald.

74
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,084
We have mice in the attic.

75
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,087
We have to do
something about this.

76
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,715
We have valuable
documents up there.

77
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,761
Feeling better, Uncle James?

78
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,096
Up and down.

79
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,641
I'm gonna go to the market and
get some traps and some cheddar.

80
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,561
You can set the traps tonight
before bedtime, okay?

81
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,232
I don't want to do that,
Uncle James.

82
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,860
Well, if I set them,
I'll forget to check.

83
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,571
I can remind you.
No, Terri.

84
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,448
You have no chores.

85
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,784
You have no one breathing
down your neck.

86
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,994
I mean, you live a prince's life here.
You know that.

87
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,956
I know.
Good.

88
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,334
I'm gonna set up the ladder
next to the crawl space.

89
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,559
I want to talk to you
about my boyfriend.

90
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,810
Well, I don't want
to talk to you.

91
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,520
Oh, you tango divine!

92
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,860
I don't know if you have heard,

93
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,069
but there's going
to come a time...

94
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,626
How did we do up there?

95
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,963
Terri?

96
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,758
Five mice!

97
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,884
That's not bad.

98
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,142
Well, we'll put them
in the marsh.

99
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,020
Let the other animals
pick them off.

100
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,066
Just think of it as
feeding the animals, Terri.

101
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,596
I'm hurrying as fast as I can.
I just really don't want.

102
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,264
- Mrs. Vick to...
- All right, class.

103
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,601
Now today we're going to
learn how to crack an egg.

104
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,520
Do you know how to crack an egg?
No.

105
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,314
I'm sure you think you do,
but there is a special way.

106
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,109
Now what you do is,
one, two, three, crack.

107
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,985
It's all in the wrist.

108
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,988
One, two, three, crack.
Wrist.

109
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,824
It's so easy and a way...

110
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,118
I just want to be with you.

111
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,453
This is just
the perfect moment.

112
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,538
All right, come on, come on.

113
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,957
I know you guys think you'll
never lose your memory,

114
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,458
but believe me, you will.

115
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,918
One, two, three, crack.

116
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,134
Ms. Hamish,
please send Terri Thompson in.

117
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,835
Terri Thompson.

118
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,381
I had hoped we wouldn't
have to meet like this.

119
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,217
In fact, I was sure
we wouldn't have to.

120
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,555
Do you know
all the students' names?

121
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,100
No, it wouldn't be possible for me
to know all the students' names.

122
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,020
No.
Why do you...

123
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,148
I mean, how do you know mine?

124
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:48,780
Well, every year there's two groups
of kids, who stand out here.

125
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,032
Okay?

126
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,868
There's the
good-hearted kids.

127
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,705
And there's
the bad-hearted kids.

128
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,291
And those are the ones
whose names I learn.

129
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,253
And which one am I?

130
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,674
Don't you know, dude?

131
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,385
I don't know if I know.

132
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,640
Well, you strike me as one of
the good-hearted ones, Terri,

133
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,310
which is why I'm upset that
we have to meet here today,

134
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,145
for reasons of discipline.

135
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,189
Sit down, Markson!

136
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,733
Sit down!
In the chair!

137
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,076
There's something wrong
with that kid.

138
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,328
Is he one of the bad hearts?

139
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,082
No. With him, we're dealing
with a third category.

140
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,626
As yet, unnamed and unknowable.

141
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,422
Where were we?

142
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,926
You were getting mad at me
about my tardies.

143
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,262
No. Um...

144
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,349
Listen, you want a Malt Ball?

145
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,310
Yeah. Thank you.

146
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,525
I'm not mad, but

147
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,240
we have a real problem here
on our hands,

148
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,118
and I'm for
dealing with it head-on.

149
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,287
What do you think about that?

150
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,458
Okay.

151
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,753
Good.

152
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,817
Well, what's the deal?

153
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,655
Your grades are dropping.

154
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,493
Your teachers are telling me you
won't participate in the lessons,

155
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,038
you've begun to wear
pajamas every day.

156
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:04,957
Do you understand,

157
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,754
from my perspective, how those things
could be categorized as red flags?

158
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,339
They're just comfortable on me.

159
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,468
Why are you late
to school every day, Terri?

160
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,855
It's getting harder to be able...
Okay.

161
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,610
Okay.

162
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,363
Stop right there.

163
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,796
You all right there,
Ms. Hamish?

164
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,339
Fine.

165
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,008
You're just clearing out
the old pipes, huh?

166
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,763
Dynamite.
Listen, do me a favor.

167
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,725
Set aside my Monday mornings
for Terri Thompson.

168
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,021
Terri Thomp...

169
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,817
Thomp... Thomp...

170
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,696
And if you could also let
Mrs. Davidson know

171
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,116
that Terri is mine
on Monday mornings, please.

172
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,868
All right?

173
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,413
T-H-O-M...

174
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,085
So here's what I'm proposing.

175
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,423
We meet once a week
and check in with each other.

176
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,552
See how we're faring
against the world.

177
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,805
You know what I mean?

178
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,810
Really?

179
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,772
What is weird about
two guys sitting down,

180
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,066
sharing snacks and
shooting the breeze?

181
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,694
Nothing, I guess.

182
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,945
Nothing is right, dude.

183
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,281
And by the way,

184
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,743
you get out of homeroom at
the beginning of each week.

185
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,244
Come on!
Are you kidding me?

186
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,539
Up high!
Fitzy needs a high five.

187
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,359
All the traps were
empty this morning.

188
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,819
That's very good, Terri.

189
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,364
We won't be seeing those
boys any more, will we?

190
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,534
No, I think they'll come
back, probably next week.

191
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,995
I bet they'll come back.
Mmm.

192
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,248
I don't think so.

193
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,333
Once you dispatch
that front line,

194
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,044
the troops always fall back
for safer ground.

195
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,131
You know, they got to find their
food in the woods like before.

196
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,429
You got plans for the weekend?

197
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,373
A hummingbird in flight

198
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,417
has the highest metabolism
of all animals

199
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,711
with the exception of insects,

200
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,673
which is necessary to support the
rapid beating of their wings.

201
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,427
Incubation can last
two to three weeks.

202
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,220
After hatching...

203
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,305
What's this about
cheddar cheese?

204
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,599
When did you start liking that?

205
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,105
I don't understand.

206
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,400
I need you
to explain this to me.

207
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,947
You enjoyed hurting these
animals, is that it?

208
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,041
I don't know.

209
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,629
Well, I'm so ashamed.

210
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:07,009
I didn't even know you were capable
of doing something so ugly.

211
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,068
It's like I went crazy
or something.

212
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,988
I've never done
anything like that before.

213
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,868
It's bloodlust, dude.

214
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:38,249
It can be a hard habit to break, they
say, once you get started in on it.

215
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,918
I think I'm going to
become a vegetarian.

216
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,546
Whoa.
Wait a minute now.

217
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:48,008
Let's not get carried away.
I mean, you are remorseful.

218
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,219
And that's a positive.

219
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:54,765
I knew a kid growing up that used to tie
flaming tennis balls to cats' tails,

220
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,975
and loved every minute of it.

221
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,352
Apparently, he's a cop now.

222
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,856
Anyway, the thing about
this mouse scenario is

223
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:05,776
even if your uncle says he doesn't
understand why you did it,

224
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,363
guess what, he does.

225
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,618
He does and so do I.
All right?

226
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,663
Now, that's not to say
that it's not wrong or weird

227
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,832
because, believe me, it is.

228
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:25,880
But it's important for you to get
that we get it, okay? We get it!

229
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,758
Right?

230
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,061
Open your legs. Okay?

231
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,697
What the hell is your problem?
You promised me.

232
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,532
Open your damn legs.

233
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,245
Terri, can you do
the French toast?

234
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,462
Hello, Earth to Terri.
What?

235
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,963
You're on French toast, okay?

236
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,423
Yeah, sure.

237
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,116
Oh, my God.

238
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,079
What, Terri?

239
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,459
What? What?

240
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,046
Guys.

241
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,967
Oh, my God.

242
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,887
Oh, my God.
Seriously?

243
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,931
I can't believe they're doing
that in class. Oh, my God.

244
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,267
In class. In class.
So gross.

245
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,478
Hey, guys, come over here.

246
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,440
Do you see that?
Right below the desk.

247
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,987
You stud.

248
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,240
Is he so desperate to get some?

249
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,783
I'd say.

250
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,835
Damn, dude.

251
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,051
Oh, my God.

252
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,015
Oh, my God!

253
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,976
What is it?

254
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,610
Tell me what it is.
Come here.

255
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,961
Is it true?

256
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,715
Is it true?
Yeah. Yeah, here.

257
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,637
It's true.
It's true!

258
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,473
Watch the finger.
I'm sorry.

259
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,934
Let me see it again!
Let me see it again!

260
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,687
Watch it! Watch it!

261
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,856
Come on, use your traps.

262
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,483
That's it. All right.

263
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:36,695
I got a nose down here, so don't...
Don't kick back. Push!

264
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,907
Hey!

265
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,994
Mr. Thompson,
we've been waiting for you.

266
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,290
I'm sorry, Mr. Flemisch.
There was a hold-up last period.

267
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,042
A what? A hold-up?

268
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:54,421
What do you mean, like a robbery?
Like a bandido-esque...

269
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,176
You know,
let me ask you something.

270
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,930
This is something that's been
bothering me for quite a while now.

271
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:07,601
Why do you bear so blatant a grudge
towards physical education and wellness?

272
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,938
Hey, Mr. Flemisch.

273
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,691
I don't think grudge
is the right word.

274
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,817
Oh, I'm sorry.

275
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,652
Well, let's get it right, then.

276
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:21,448
How do you feel about physical
education and wellness, Terri? Hmm?

277
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,330
The feeling is no feeling.

278
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,292
All right, Terri.
Well, I got some news for you.

279
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,504
After warm-ups today, we're going
to start working on the high jumps.

280
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,215
Now, will you or
will you not participate?

281
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,634
And I encourage you to
think before you answer.

282
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,388
I will not.

283
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,808
Well, then you get out of my
gymnasium and don't come back!

284
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,976
Shit!

285
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,819
Ms. Miles!

286
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,322
Mr. Ribis,
you are in deep doo-doo!

287
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,492
No, I'm not mad.
I am furious!

288
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:11,331
I am disappointed because I
just lost two average students.

289
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,544
This kind of thing
is punishable by law!

290
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,421
What's wrong, Marcus?
Are you out of your mind?

291
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:22,509
Those guys got in trouble
and it made my meeting stop.

292
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,387
Don't worry, Marcus.
You'll be back in there soon.

293
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,682
I don't know how much more
these two lovebirds can take.

294
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,643
Do you meet with Mr.
Fitzgerald every Monday?

295
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,107
Who all comes into these meetings, Ms.
Hamish?

296
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:44,281
Well, let's see.

297
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,076
On Mondays,
there's you and Marcus.

298
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,038
And on Tuesdays, Amber Zane.

299
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,291
Amber Zane?
That's right.

300
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,711
And on Wednesdays, there's that
little boy in the wheelchair.

301
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,047
I can never remember his name.

302
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,590
Donny Washburn.

303
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,968
Oh ! Donny.
That's right.

304
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,972
And on Fridays,
there's Chad Markson.

305
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,977
It's quite a group.

306
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,741
Terri? What's up, dude?
You all right?

307
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,369
Good hearts my ass!

308
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,169
Fuck.

309
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,265
Nice pajamas, man.

310
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,681
Uncle James?
Are you okay?

311
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,518
Terri, what are you doing here?

312
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,563
Did you take too many pills?

313
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,858
I just need to be
near some bodies.

314
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,526
Come on, let's get you home.

315
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,861
Okay.

316
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,780
Terri?

317
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,617
Check it out.
Double D's got a shit slip.

318
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,330
People, hush!
Terri, go.

319
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,183
What did you do?

320
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,644
I cut school yesterday.

321
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,904
Donny, wait out here
one second, will you?

322
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,125
- Hey, dudes.
- Hey, Donny.

323
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,502
You already done in there?

324
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,128
We're taking five
so he can see you guys.

325
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,214
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

326
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,633
What? Oh.
These things?

327
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,054
Seriously, what do you guys
do in there, play volleyball?

328
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,181
Cool Breeze Club.
Members only.

329
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,599
Get your butt in here!

330
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,227
Right now!

331
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,313
Uh-oh ! Watch out.

332
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,356
What is it with you?

333
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,650
It's always something,
isn't it?

334
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,195
What did he do?
Do you know?

335
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,114
It's bad, dude.

336
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,990
He's not too happy with you
ditching either, Terri.

337
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,369
You're off the creek, pal,
and that's three detentions.

338
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,871
Count them, one, two, three.
Now, get out of here.

339
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,383
Geez!

340
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,931
Mr. Thompson,
we've got a problem!

341
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,308
Get in here.
Close the door.

342
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,563
- Have a seat.
- Here it comes.

343
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,773
What can you be thinking?

344
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,776
The school is not a country club.
Heads up.

345
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,697
I'm not
really mad at you, okay?

346
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,032
Just go along with me,
all right?

347
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,911
Not an option
for you to be coming in here

348
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,081
and try to do that kind
of thing in my school!

349
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,924
Sorry, Ter. That was a little show for old Ms.
Hamish out there.

350
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,761
She loves it when I lay into you kids.
It's keeping her going.

351
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,932
You yelled and screamed
at me for her?

352
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,227
Sounds bad, I know.
Yeah. Um...

353
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,606
The thing is
she's not doing so hot.

354
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,026
Truth is she's dying.

355
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,777
She's dying now?

356
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,114
Not this second, no, but soon.

357
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,783
What is she dying of?

358
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,368
She's dying of cigarettes.

359
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,748
Okay? She's dying of death.

360
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,251
Was it all a joke
with Chad Markson, too?

361
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,794
No, dude.

362
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,716
It's always something with that
kid, and today he outdid himself.

363
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,970
I will show you
in pictograph form

364
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,474
what I'm talking about.

365
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,815
This is what he said to Mr.
Flemisch in front of the entire class today.

366
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,237
Yeah. Yeah,
he's a tough one.

367
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,241
Very smart and very angry.

368
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:31,289
But, Terri, I didn't call you in here
today to talk about Chad, did I?

369
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,293
No.

370
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,630
I called you in to talk about what
you said in the hallway there.

371
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,966
I was mad.

372
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,594
And I don't blame you, dude.

373
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,597
But I think you
misunderstood the facts.

374
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,140
What's to misunderstand?

375
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:54,813
I'm a part of a group
of monsters, you know?

376
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,323
I'm going to
show you something,

377
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:10,287
and it's something that I've never
shown to any other student, okay?

378
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:33,226
Come on, Terri. There's something
in there I think might help.

379
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,190
Do you recognize that guy?

380
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,819
Cute little baby, happy baby.

381
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,404
Simpler times, right?

382
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,574
Moving right along.

383
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,828
And what could go wrong?
It's a Shangri-La.

384
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,043
Boom.

385
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:06,176
Now, whenever I'm
down or depressed,

386
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,097
I take a look at that
and it clears me right up.

387
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,560
This picture makes you
feel better?

388
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,770
Of course.

389
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,858
Because you see, Terri, I
thought I was a monster, too.

390
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,405
And believe me when I tell
you, I was treated like one.

391
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,080
I like this person.

392
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,210
I look forward to these days
and I look forward to my life.

393
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,963
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

394
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,633
Mr. Fitzgerald,

395
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,304
you were treated like a monster
because you were a monster.

396
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,390
Wait a second.
I'm treated like a monster

397
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,974
because that's what
I am to them.

398
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,309
Terri.
This morning,

399
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,937
they asked me if I suck
on my own breasts.

400
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,242
Mr. Fitzgerald?
Are you okay?

401
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,374
I'm just tired.

402
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:26,464
You know, sometimes I think I should
just leave you kids on your own.

403
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,966
The way these
other kids treat you,

404
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,927
maybe that's preparation
for the real world.

405
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,853
I'm just trying
to help you, right?

406
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,401
I'm just trying to
give you some help, Terri.

407
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,574
I guess I just wish I
didn't need help, you know?

408
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,713
Coming at you.

409
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,555
So, what about the ditching?

410
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:21,102
Don't worry about it.
I mean, I already yelled at you, right?

411
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,731
Am I right?
You were so freaking scared.

412
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,399
I wasn't that scared.

413
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,277
Oh, dude, you were scared.

414
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:36,409
Heather Miles and parent
to see you, Mr. Fitzgerald.

415
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,995
Thank you, Ms. Hamish.
Just ask them to have a seat, please.

416
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,581
We're just about
finishing up here.

417
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,709
What are you
going to do with her?

418
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,378
What can I do?

419
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,841
Ribis is out. It wouldn't be
right if she got to stay on.

420
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,178
Where will she go?

421
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,597
She will transfer
to Hollyfield,

422
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,849
I would imagine,
like Ribis did.

423
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,768
All right, Terri,

424
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,063
we will see you
next week, yeah?

425
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,406
Okay, Heather, Mrs. Miles,
if you could join me here?

426
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,827
Have a seat.

427
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,045
Could you tell Mr. Fitzgerald that
I need to see him right away?

428
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,880
What?
Tell him it's an emergency.

429
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:39,264
Mr. Fitzgerald, Terri Thompson
says he wants to see you.

430
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,808
He says it's an emergency.

431
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,816
Dude, I have an important conference here.
What is up?

432
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,318
I know, sorry.
It's about Heather.

433
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,571
What about her?

434
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,198
Terri, I'm in the middle
of a...

435
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:01,244
It just seemed to me like Dirty
Zach was making her, you know?

436
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,836
That is not what I heard.

437
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,506
It's my understanding she
was a willing participant.

438
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,217
Maybe once they got started, but
I saw it from the beginning,

439
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,178
she was shaking her head
and holding him off.

440
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,349
I'm telling you, she
didn't want to do it.

441
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,310
You can't kick
somebody out of school

442
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:29,022
for something that they didn't
want to do, Mr. Fitzgerald.

443
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,485
Terri, can I ask
where this is coming from?

444
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,614
This sudden concern?

445
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,241
What do you mean?

446
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,665
All I know is that
she didn't want to do it.

447
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,335
That's the truth.
No bull.

448
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,799
Okay.

449
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,264
Chad?

450
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,898
Just wanted to come over and see
what you're doing today, okay?

451
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,110
Oh!

452
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,671
Everything all right?

453
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,548
Best ever.
Thanks, Uncle James.

454
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,470
Yeah, it's great.
Thanks.

455
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,271
Where's your mom?

456
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,982
I don't know.

457
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,526
Where's your dad?

458
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,696
I don't know.

459
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,304
You don't like the beans?

460
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,473
I like the beans, Terri.

461
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:18,024
I'm glad you're having a good time.
This is super fun.

462
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:27,867
I'm Joe Hollywood and I can
make you and I can break you.

463
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,369
So, don't forget to IM me

464
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:35,875
because I'm hemorrhaging money here and
the 101 's a freaking parking lot.

465
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:42,089
The humane thing to do would be to take the
set outside and put it out of its misery.

466
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,884
I might have mastered life.

467
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:48,137
Yeah, baby.
Joe Hollywood.

468
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,615
So, what did Fitzgerald
give you for ditching?

469
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,076
Uh, he was...

470
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,579
He was...
He was pretty mad.

471
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,832
Yeah, he was mad.
He was mad.

472
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,124
He's a weird dude.

473
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,126
Half the time, I think he wants
to hit me, the other half,

474
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,379
I'm scared he's gonna
kiss me or something.

475
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,172
He wants to help us, Chad.

476
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,007
It only creeps me out.

477
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,010
This one time, he shows me this
picture of him as a teenager

478
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,095
with hardly any clothes on.

479
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,807
He kept putting his hairy
freaking mitts on my shoulders,

480
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,475
going on about my good heart.

481
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,769
I think it's some straight up weird
shit I don't even want to...

482
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,396
He didn't show you Yesterdays.

483
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,232
Yeah, that was it, Yesterdays.

484
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,359
"I've never shown this to
anyone before in my life."

485
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,111
Chad, you have to go.

486
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,737
Why? What's wrong, Terri?

487
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,323
I've got homework to do.
I need to be alone. Please go, Chad.

488
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,783
It's Sunday.
What are you talking about?

489
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,618
Chad, please
just leave me alone.

490
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,287
Terri, what's wrong?
Just leave, Chad.

491
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,581
Whoa! Dude, Terri. Chill out, man.
All right. You need to go.

492
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,125
Terri, what the hell
is the matter with you?

493
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:03,212
What are you?
Faggot fucking psycho?

494
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,714
Fucking big-titty
piece of shit?

495
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,799
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

496
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,222
Where'd your friend go?

497
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,307
Home, I guess.

498
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,144
I'm glad you're
having visitors.

499
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,481
I do understand it.

500
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,567
Well, you're
underestimating me.

501
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,238
Wait. How could you... How...
Well, how could you think that I don't understand it?

502
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,826
Because it's got nothing to do
with aesthetics, that's why.

503
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,828
No. It's basic mathematics.

504
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,832
It has to do with incoming money
and outgoing expenses, Janet.

505
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,335
Hello?

506
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,967
The woman wants to cannonball into a
pool of ltalian high-heeled shoes.

507
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,893
You tell me something, Terri, is there
anything wrong with my aesthetic?

508
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,358
What's up with you, Terri Bear?

509
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,109
Don't call me that.

510
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,159
All right, let's have it.

511
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,912
Come on, tell me what's wrong.

512
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,705
Me and Chad Markson
hung out this weekend

513
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,917
and my uncle made us beans
on toast and we talked.

514
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,380
Beans on toast?

515
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,423
What, you live
in a hobo village?

516
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,802
You guys go off on your
donkeys after that?

517
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,806
He told me that
you showed him Yesterdays.

518
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,851
Oh, I see.

519
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,897
Yeah. "Oh."

520
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,236
Fitzgerald.

521
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,033
Where?

522
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,579
The same handwriting?

523
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,876
All right, I'm coming down.

524
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,089
Let's take a walk.

525
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,513
I don't even understand this.

526
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,934
Well, a zombie is someone that's
died and comes back to life.

527
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,186
Yeah, I know
what a zombie is, Bob.

528
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,358
I don't see the connection.

529
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,781
Well, go get the paint.

530
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,331
I'm sorry, Terri.

531
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,961
Come sit down
over here with me.

532
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,647
Did you notice the new
secretary in my office?

533
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:13,861
A temp agency sent her over to help out while Ms.
Hamish was in the hospital.

534
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,656
Her name is Samantha.
She's a really sweet girl.

535
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,327
She's a newlywed,
she lives here in town.

536
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,121
And...

537
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,333
I could tell from the
moment she got here

538
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:30,503
that she really wants
to work here permanently.

539
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:35,299
I mean,
it's a five-minute commute,

540
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,843
very convenient for her,
right here in town.

541
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,931
It'd be a great job
for her, you know?

542
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,435
Anyway, this morning,

543
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,397
she was trying to figure out through
a series of sideways questions

544
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,400
exactly how serious
Ms. Hamish's illness was.

545
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,780
And she was acting
concerned, of course,

546
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:02,368
but I could see in her eyes, you
know, she doesn't know Ms. Hamish.

547
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,078
She can't help it.

548
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:09,542
There's a part of her that wants Ms.
Hamish to die.

549
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,295
It'll get her the job.

550
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,882
So?

551
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,428
So, Ms. Hamish
is dead, Terri.

552
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,765
I got the call
about an hour ago.

553
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald.

554
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,897
Don't say things
you don't mean, Terri.

555
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,900
You're not sorry she's gone.

556
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,069
You barely knew her.

557
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,737
Sorry.

558
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,408
Now, after I got off the
phone with the hospital,

559
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,035
I called the temp agency
and I told them,

560
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,496
you know, we're gonna hire
Samantha permanently.

561
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,082
And they thanked me and they said
they'd call her and give her the news.

562
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,419
And I said, "You know, if you don't
mind, I would rather do it,"

563
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,462
because I kind of wanted
to spring the news on her.

564
00:52:55,547 --> 00:53:00,301
You know, what a great way for she and I
to start our working together, right?

565
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:06,640
But now, I have to tell
her she's got the job

566
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:13,397
and I will have to watch
while she pretends to be sad.

567
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,529
Life's a mess, dude,

568
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,744
but we're all just doing
the best we can, you know.

569
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,956
You, and me, and Samantha,

570
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,295
we're just doing what we can.

571
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,299
So, if I hurt you

572
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,344
or if I lied to you, all I
can tell you is I'm sorry,

573
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,348
and I will try to do better.

574
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:54,563
Maybe I will do better or maybe
I'll do even worse. I don't know.

575
00:53:56,149 --> 00:54:00,653
I screw up all the time because
that's what people do,

576
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,156
you know?

577
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,161
Okay, Mr. Fitzgerald.

578
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,917
Ms. Hamish's funeral
is this Friday.

579
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:20,381
She doesn't have any family
or even any friends.

580
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:24,134
I was going to go over there
alone and pay my respects,

581
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,973
but I got to be honest, it is
starting to feel like a real downer.

582
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,685
I just don't know. Uh...

583
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,940
Do you want to come with?

584
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,244
You can come sit
over here with us, Terri.

585
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,328
I'm okay. Thanks.

586
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,040
What a jerk!

587
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,884
Enough, people, enough.

588
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,140
This is something that we're going
to have to get through together,

589
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,349
as a group.

590
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:19,732
Now, there will be
a test this Friday

591
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:25,112
where you will be asked to
showcase your mucho sewing skills

592
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,865
with a traditional
Mexican poncho.

593
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,873
Take them off, Heather.

594
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:41,170
Take the sunglasses off,
Heather Miles.

595
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,005
Take them off,
Heather! God!

596
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,848
Hey, everybody, look at
me, I'm Joe Hollywood.

597
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,183
I am successful.

598
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,436
You should come because I'm
going to help you out.

599
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:01,190
I'm hemorrhaging.
I'm on a parking lot.

600
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,275
Oh, Joe Hollywood.

601
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,985
Very nice, Terri.

602
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,076
Would you mind if we
continue with the lesson?

603
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,452
I'm sorry, Ms. Vick.

604
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:25,047
Now, the traditional
Mexican poncho

605
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,343
is centuries and centuries old.

606
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,887
And what makes it extraordinary

607
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,973
is the individuality
of all the design,

608
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,975
and that's where
you all come in.

609
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:42,314
Each one of you is going to leave
indelibly your own imprint.

610
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:48,821
The traditional Mexican
costume is exquisite.

611
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:54,243
And because they do not have the kind
of industrialization that we have,

612
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,203
they've been able to maintain

613
00:56:56,704 --> 00:57:02,084
this ancient and traditional
culture and dress.

614
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,337
You're all capable
of going on the computer.

615
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,965
I want you all
to look and decide

616
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,551
where is your
particular poncho from.

617
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,512
Think about what towns,

618
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,515
is it going to be Minatitlán?
Is it going to be Oaxaca?

619
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,351
Is it going to be
San Miguel de Allende?

620
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,314
What have we got? We've got yarn.
Look at those colors.

621
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,609
And the Mexican flag.
Look how brilliant that flag is.

622
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:33,198
I want you to incorporate these with
bright, basic colors into your ponchos.

623
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,909
And for people that are shy,

624
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,872
this will be excellent to start
coming out and wear bright colors

625
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,583
and say to the world,
"Here I am. This is me."

626
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,719
Bye, guys.

627
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,601
Oh, my God, that was so funny.

628
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,353
Bye, Heather.

629
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,366
Hey, hold on a minute?

630
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,416
Um, hi.
Do you have a second?

631
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,168
Yeah, sure.

632
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,839
I guess I just wanted
to say thank you

633
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,593
for doing that thing in
there, with the sunglasses.

634
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,262
Okay, yeah.

635
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,141
Can I ask you something,
though?

636
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,189
I mean, why did you help me?

637
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,151
I'm... I don't know,
why not?

638
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,197
I don't know.

639
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:02,120
Since last week, it seems like
everyone has decided to hate me

640
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:03,872
except for you.

641
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,461
Do you know what I
think it is, Heather?

642
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,342
I think that there's
good-heart kids

643
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:17,219
and that there is
bad-heart kids

644
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,303
here at the school.

645
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:23,308
But when I look at you,
when I really look at you,

646
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:27,813
I know that you're
a good-heart person.

647
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,525
And I guess that

648
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:38,532
makes me want to help you
or be nice to you or...

649
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:43,704
Because that's what
good hearts get.

650
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,163
I don't know.

651
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,292
Well, thank you, Terri.

652
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:51,795
I'll see you tomorrow.

653
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,756
Bye, Heather.

654
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:08,872
Hi, Chad.

655
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:48,346
Terri Thompson, the man with the plan.
Terri T, super kid.

656
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,642
Hi, Samantha.
Terri ! Terri!

657
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,397
Terri Thompson's
here to see you.

658
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:58,523
Yeah, just one second.

659
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,037
Look, I'm sorry I freaked
out on you, okay?

660
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,292
Why?

661
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,839
Why'd I freak out on you,
or why am I sorry?

662
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,634
Why?

663
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,099
Okay.

664
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:38,438
I freaked out on you because you made
me feel bad about Mr. Fitzgerald.

665
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:44,861
And I don't want to feel bad about
him because he's my good friend.

666
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:45,946
And you can think I'm...

667
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,365
All right.
Who is ready to mourn?

668
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,330
Samantha, why wasn't Chad told that
his Friday meeting was canceled?

669
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:59,209
Um... Right.
Just... One second.

670
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,044
I'm sorry about this, Chad,

671
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,421
but you must have heard
about Mrs. Hamish's passing.

672
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:07,259
Well, Terri and I are just going to
the funeral to see her off, so...

673
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,511
Yeah.

674
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,556
We'll make it up next week.
We'll do Thursday and Friday.

675
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:13,640
How about that?

676
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,433
Mr. Fitzgerald,
could Chad come with us?

677
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:19,062
I was just going to say
the same thing.

678
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:20,939
To the funeral?

679
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,567
You know, I really liked Ms.
Hamish.

680
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,486
She was...
She was my friend.

681
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,490
Yeah.

682
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,368
I don't know, Chad...

683
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,454
Yeah? I can go?
I'm really going to miss her.

684
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,835
I'm going to need you to cut out
any kind of weirdness there, Chad.

685
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,086
Can I have your word on that?

686
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,629
Oh, yeah. Totally.

687
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,798
All right, boys.

688
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,053
What? What?

689
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,391
Please write down the schedule,
Thursday and Friday.

690
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,855
Terri, check out her skull.

691
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,650
Gracias. Thank you.

692
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,960
Please don't make me laugh.

693
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,588
Boys, have some respect.

694
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,966
There's a dead person
right here.

695
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,847
We're just...
This is us.

696
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,015
Sure.

697
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,768
All righty.

698
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,898
Please. Please.

699
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,133
Amen.

700
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,226
Amen.

701
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,187
Um...

702
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:57,512
No baked beans in this whole place,
if you can believe it or not.

703
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,811
I just never know what to get.

704
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,483
What are you getting?

705
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:14,237
Are you guys ready to order?

706
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,115
You know, we're going to need another
minute, if that's all right.

707
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,158
Of course.

708
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:29,502
Hey, that reminds me.
What's up with you and that girl Heather?

709
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,255
Oh ! Did you see that?

710
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,215
That did look like
something, yeah.

711
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,718
Nothing.
We've just been talking.

712
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,804
She's coming over tonight.

713
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:43,266
Wait, like, tonight?
As in tonight, tonight?

714
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,227
7:00, she said.
And it's a date?

715
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,646
She didn't say.

716
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,482
What are you guys going to do?

717
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,234
I don't know.

718
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:56,279
I guess I'll...

719
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,240
I'm going to show her around and
I'll show her my paperbacks,

720
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,702
and introduce her
to Uncle James.

721
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:06,498
And he's got some old records and
I think she likes music, so...

722
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,876
ls your heart breaking
right now?

723
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,669
Mine is.

724
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:14,923
All right, Terri, no offense,

725
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:16,633
but it's time to take your
head out of your ass, okay?

726
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,301
Chad, watch it.

727
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,678
Sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald.

728
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,890
You have the biggest set of tits in
the entire school, besides yours,

729
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,517
coming to your house tonight.
Chad.

730
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:29,270
She says she just wants to come
over and see where I live.

731
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,106
Oh, you're going to blow it.

732
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,733
If you do, she won't.
Get it?

733
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,155
What is wrong with you, Chad?
Honestly.

734
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,368
Right here. Stop.

735
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,619
Okay.

736
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:55,213
Listen, Ter, thanks for
tagging along today, Ter.

737
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:59,509
It was weird.

738
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:01,636
It was really weird.

739
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,388
It was awesome.

740
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,392
And good luck tonight, Terri.
You look out for yourself, okay?

741
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,228
Thanks, Mr. Fitzgerald. Bye.

742
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:19,654
Don't touch the radio.

743
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:47,557
What's with the face?

744
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,475
Someone steal your crackers?

745
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,604
Are you...

746
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,607
You look pretty good.

747
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,068
No rhyme or reason to it.

748
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:02,614
I don't want to be rude, but I want
to take advantage of this window,

749
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:04,449
if you don't mind.

750
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,533
Yeah, sure.

751
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,912
I'm going to go
clean for a bit.

752
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,320
Oh.

753
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:07,280
Hey, Terri.

754
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,531
How's it going?

755
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,657
What are you doing here, Chad?

756
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:13,244
Look, I don't want to break
up a party or anything.

757
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,455
Is she here?

758
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,914
No, but she's going
to be here any minute,

759
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,374
and I just put
Uncle James down.

760
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,959
Are you gonna get
out of here or what?

761
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,544
Yeah, totally.

762
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,171
Listen, though.

763
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,633
Can I use your restroom
real quick?

764
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:29,510
No. Go pee in the woods.

765
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,304
I'll see you tomorrow and
I'll tell you all about it.

766
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,100
I'm afraid it's a little more
serious than that, Terri.

767
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,228
Are you almost done in there?

768
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,483
What? Who is it?

769
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:47,737
Terri? Terri Thompson?

770
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:52,325
I never liked you, Terri.
Why are you so mean?

771
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:59,540
Delivery!

772
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,877
Delivery, Terri.

773
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,634
Ooh!

774
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,263
Hi, Terri.

775
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,477
Terri?

776
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,029
Um...

777
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:32,740
ls that your uncle?

778
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:36,661
It's my friend Chad.
He'll be gone in a minute.

779
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,997
Terri.

780
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,334
What's wrong with him?

781
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,711
A few different things,
I think.

782
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:02,812
Have you been
drinking alcohol, Chad?

783
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,148
A little bit.

784
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:17,034
If you honestly think that I'm going to
kill the buzz of a $200 bottle of whiskey.

785
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:21,164
$200 for one bottle?

786
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,790
It's not $200, Chad.

787
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,334
It is so and it is
fucking delicious.

788
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,463
You want...
You want me to go get it?

789
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:35,094
I don't want any, Heather, but
if you do, you should go ahead.

790
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,559
Yeah? I should go?
I'm going to find it.

791
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,064
Never mind, Chad.

792
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:57,033
You know, he's probably
not going to find it anyways.

793
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:03,414
Hey, do you want to go
see your uncle?

794
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,883
Can he hear us?

795
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,676
I'm not sure.

796
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:21,766
Anyways, even if he could hear us,
he wouldn't remember it later on.

797
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:26,604
He looks sad.

798
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:39,492
Maybe he can hear us,
but he just doesn't care.

799
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:46,582
What are you doing?

800
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:06,352
There's no use in pretending you're
thinking of anybody but yourself.

801
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:17,488
Why do you say that?

802
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,449
Heather, he's sick.

803
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:24,203
Does he talk to you like that?

804
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:29,750
No.

805
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:34,964
Last one to puke
is a rotten egg.

806
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,844
Hmm.

807
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,349
Meet you in the shed then,
fuckers.

808
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:52,732
Come on. Let's let him rest.
You can go have a drink with Chad.

809
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:05,369
I propose a toast,

810
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:10,291
to good times and friends.

811
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:18,215
That's not how you're
supposed to drink it, Terri.

812
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,508
It's how I drink it, okay?

813
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:20,593
Wait a minute.

814
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:23,054
Shut up and listen, you guys.

815
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:26,057
Sounds like...
Like...

816
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:34,565
Hey, give me that.
They're not yours.

817
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:35,691
Hey!

818
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,570
What the hell was that?

819
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:40,863
Chad, they're my uncle's.

820
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,948
Your uncle has
a whole houseful, okay?

821
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:46,077
He's not going to notice
three little pills missing.

822
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:55,252
I don't think we should.

823
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:56,962
Well...

824
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:04,053
Think she'll fuck us both?
Yes or no?

825
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,555
What? What?

826
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:08,891
I know you met
her first, Terri.

827
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,768
Chad, I want you to
take it easy, okay?

828
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,978
No, I'm pretty sure that...

829
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:16,440
Do we really need
the radio right now?

830
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,067
Look, look at me.

831
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,487
I need you to take a breath
and calm down.

832
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:23,739
Look at me.
Calm down, okay?

833
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,449
I'm totally calm.

834
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:29,537
Look, pay attention
next time I'm over there

835
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:32,248
because she's looking at me
like I'm up for auction.

836
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:35,126
Maybe we can just deal
without the radio.

837
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:42,299
I don't want you to be uncomfortable,
but I think it would be okay

838
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:44,385
if we just took one each.

839
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:46,429
Fuck, yeah.
Let's do it.

840
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:50,933
What's it going to do to me?

841
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,435
Just make you feel nice.

842
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:54,478
I already feel nice.

843
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:57,231
You can always feel nicer.

844
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:00,025
Only one, though, right?

845
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,652
Only one.

846
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:23,883
You took two pills.

847
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,262
Shh!

848
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:29,972
Don't tell Terri.

849
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,892
Who cares about that guy?

850
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:36,145
I care. He's my
great big sweetheart.

851
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,188
Hey.

852
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:39,857
Uh...

853
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:45,112
Heather, I have a question.

854
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:46,822
Um...

855
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,868
Why did you get fingered
that one time? Chad!

856
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,246
Come on.
I'm sorry, Heather.

857
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,249
You don't have to answer
that if you don't want to.

858
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,878
I'll answer it.

859
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,844
Oh, good.

860
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:37,331
All girls get fingered
sooner or later, Chad,

861
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,918
but I guess you wouldn't
know about that.

862
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,712
Yeah. That's nice.

863
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:46,549
Look, what I was
trying to get at is,

864
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:49,844
why did you get fingered
in Home Economics?

865
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:55,015
That's where he
wanted to do it.

866
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,270
He said nobody would see.

867
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,607
But why Dirty Zach?

868
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:08,696
Because he wanted to, okay?

869
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:13,617
And it feels good to be wanted.

870
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,123
Maybe that sounds
sad to you guys.

871
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:22,293
I don't know.

872
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:35,139
No, it's not sad.

873
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:38,267
It's not sad at all.

874
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:14,053
I feel strange.

875
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:15,304
I feel awesome!

876
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,017
It's probably
just the pill, Terri.

877
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,852
Is it too strong?
Are you okay?

878
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,023
You look like an adult
over there.

879
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:28,859
I do?

880
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,569
Like a big shot.

881
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:35,282
You're so shiny.

882
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,035
I am?

883
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:40,955
I'm shiny?

884
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:43,874
I just want to
fuck the whole world.

885
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,293
Cut a hole in the ground,
I'll fuck it all night.

886
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,927
It feels like I peed my
pants, but I didn't.

887
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:57,054
Me, too.

888
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,265
Hey, let's pee our pants
on purpose, huh?

889
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:01,600
What?

890
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:04,853
Go for it, Chad.

891
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:05,980
Yeah?
Yeah.

892
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,564
You don't think I'll do it?

893
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,774
I hope you do.

894
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:12,653
I'm doing it, doing it right now.
Okay.

895
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,898
What did you think of that?

896
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:54,611
Chad, that was amazing.

897
01:23:58,658 --> 01:24:00,909
What did you think about that?

898
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,456
Well, it was new.

899
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:06,874
Yeah?

900
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,208
Your turn.

901
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:12,463
My turn to what, pee all over my clothes?
No, thank you.

902
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:15,257
You got to do something.

903
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:18,218
I mean, I didn't just
do all that for nothing.

904
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:21,096
I think you did, actually.

905
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:24,183
Chad, what are you
talking about?

906
01:24:24,267 --> 01:24:26,727
You have to do something,
Heather.

907
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:31,190
Gee, Chad,
what do you want me to do?

908
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,444
Yeah, that's right.

909
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,824
I want you to suck my cock.

910
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:54,421
Cock?

911
01:24:56,466 --> 01:25:01,011
You call that little pink thing
stuck to your balls a cock?

912
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,279
Fuck this.

913
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:37,673
Terri.

914
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:42,845
Fucking hell!

915
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:12,541
Hey, guys.

916
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:35,522
You're not drinking your drink.

917
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:41,945
You're supposed to hit it,
not babysit it.

918
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,884
What are you thinking about?

919
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,971
He wants to see your tits.

920
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:27,282
Do you want to see?

921
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:30,452
I don't know.

922
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:32,996
No, no.

923
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:38,001
She wants to see your tits.

924
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,004
Show her your tits, Terri.

925
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,286
Let's take our clothes off.

926
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:13,578
I can't.

927
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:15,914
I'll help.

928
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:14,931
Terri.

929
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:17,517
Look.

930
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,366
Terri, come here.

931
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:48,465
Terri, come over here.
Come on.

932
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:52,469
Terri.

933
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:07,025
Terri, please come over here.
I'm right here, please.

934
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:11,921
Terri.

935
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:29,394
Did you have somebody
over here last night?

936
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:31,521
A girl?

937
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:34,441
Yeah.

938
01:33:35,067 --> 01:33:36,568
A pretty girl.

939
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:48,515
Who... Was...
What happened?

940
01:34:58,275 --> 01:34:59,484
Come on.

941
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:13,206
Thank you, Terri.

942
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:16,793
There's some aspirin
in the nurse's station.

943
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:19,587
Yeah, that would be good.

944
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:34,853
Well, that was easy.
What the hell is this lock for anyway?

945
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:36,563
Aspirin and iodine?

946
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,484
Can I have one, too?

947
01:36:09,388 --> 01:36:14,517
Sky hoop.

948
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:32,327
What do you think?

949
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,748
She's embarrassed.

950
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:40,835
I'm not going to say
anything about what happened

951
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:43,379
if that's what
she's worried about.

952
01:36:43,672 --> 01:36:46,466
Well, I'm sure she
would appreciate that.

953
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:58,895
It's okay.

954
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:02,690
I don't think I'm ready for
all that stuff yet anyway.

955
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:07,487
Who is, you know?

956
01:37:20,459 --> 01:37:24,420
So, do you think you and your
wife are going to get divorced?

957
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:27,757
No. No.

958
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:31,302
Just a fight.

959
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:34,764
One of many.

960
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:41,771
What was it about?

961
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:48,570
For some people, Terri,
enough is just not enough.

962
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:02,959
How do I look?

963
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:06,462
Like you slept in a car.

964
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:08,256
Oh, well.

965
01:38:08,674 --> 01:38:10,800
Are you going to go home now?

966
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:13,011
Yeah. I might as well
get it over with.

967
01:38:13,095 --> 01:38:15,305
Where are you gonna go?

968
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:17,891
I'll probably see
how Chad's doing.

969
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:23,271
Listen, Terri, we did not
just enter school property.

970
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:26,149
Okay.
Yeah?

971
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:28,943
Are we clear on that?
Very clear.

972
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:30,320
All right.
Lay five on me.

973
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:42,957
Come on, lay five on me.

974
01:38:44,668 --> 01:38:47,670
I will see you on Monday
for our meeting, yeah?

975
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,297
Monday.
All right.

976
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:55,720
Thank you.

977
01:41:06,518 --> 01:41:12,231
I called her,
chatting on the phone today.

978
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:17,361
It's something I rarely do.

979
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:25,536
But for reasons
that I can't explain

980
01:41:26,663 --> 01:41:30,666
I feel I'm splitting in two

981
01:41:32,836 --> 01:41:37,673
I don't know who I've been

982
01:41:41,011 --> 01:41:44,597
I'm a stranger in my skin.

983
01:41:45,974 --> 01:41:51,854
Used to be somebody.

984
01:41:52,648 --> 01:41:54,690
Now I'm someone else

985
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:02,865
I took a look at my reflection

986
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,827
I didn't recognize myself.

987
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:10,873
The person in the mirror
was a shell.

988
01:42:13,335 --> 01:42:18,965
Hollow on the inside,
as empty as a bell.

989
01:42:19,883 --> 01:42:25,888
And I can hear it
ringing out for miles around.

990
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:30,476
Friends say I need help.

991
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:40,486
But I know I'm not crazy
I'm only someone else.

992
01:42:42,739 --> 01:42:44,282
Oh, oh

993
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:47,410
I want someone else

994
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:54,250
I used to be somebody.

995
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:57,837
Used to be somebody.

996
01:42:58,672 --> 01:43:00,715
Now I'm someone else.

997
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:03,236
And time takes it all

998
01:44:06,281 --> 01:44:09,408
I feel the seating's changing

999
01:44:09,576 --> 01:44:13,246
I hear the thunder roll.

1000
01:44:15,457 --> 01:44:17,041
Oh, oh

1001
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:20,253
I want someone else

1002
01:44:24,883 --> 01:44:27,343
I used to be somebody.

1003
01:44:28,178 --> 01:44:30,680
Used to be somebody.

1004
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:33,641
Now I'm someone else.

1005
01:44:38,522 --> 01:44:39,772
All right.

1006
01:44:44,486 --> 01:44:46,862
Now I'm someone else

1007
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:53,369
I am someone else

1008
01:45:06,633 --> 01:45:07,633
