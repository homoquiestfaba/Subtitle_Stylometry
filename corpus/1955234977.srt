1
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,707
Who are you? What do you want?

2
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:24,377
Know what? Fuck you.

3
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:28,515
Your little girl needs you, Gigi.

4
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:30,183
Mommy?

5
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:34,221
Mommy?

6
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,408
- Bonjour, sweetheart.
- Bonjour, Gigi.

7
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:58,545
- You look sleepy.
- Oh, I just woke up.

8
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:00,780
I'm glad you called. How
is everything at home?

9
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:02,449
- Everything's fine.
- Yeah?

10
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,351
Marie decided to dress
herself this morning.

11
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:06,553
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey, it's mommy.

12
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:08,421
Hi, mommy, it's Marie.

13
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:09,689
That's Marie Fini?

14
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:12,459
Yes, it's Marie Fini Genereau.

15
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:15,695
Wow. Hello, Marie Fini Genereau.

16
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:17,864
Bonjour. Here's daddy, mommy.

17
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:21,568
I guess she's got better
things to do, mommy.

18
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:22,702
Yes.

19
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:24,404
What time's your audition, babe?

20
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:26,673
11:00. I need coffee, Richard.

21
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:29,409
Go, get coffee. Call me after.

22
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:30,777
- I love you, babe.
- You too.

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,613
Je t'aime. Bye-Bye.

24
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:39,352
You think you can treat me like this

25
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:41,454
And not pay for it, bastard?

26
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:44,557
You obviously have no idea who
you're dealing with, mister.

27
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:48,528
Aw, yeah, you better believe I do.

28
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:50,863
What do you think... you
think... you think you can

29
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:54,033
Treat me like this and
not pay for it, bastard?

30
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:57,437
You obviously have no idea who
you're dealing with, mister.

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,440
Oh, yeah, you better believe I do.

32
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:52,659
Thank you.

33
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:55,828
- For you.
- Thanks, Ms. Genereau.

34
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,902
You think you can treat me like this

35
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:04,737
and not pay for it, bastard?

36
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:07,440
You obviously have no idea who
you're dealing with, mister.

37
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:11,010
- You have real balls, bitch.
- Oh, you better believe I do.

38
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:13,045
Jesus, I hope that gun's not real.

39
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,082
And what if it were, bastard?

40
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:23,089
That was great. Thanks, Gigi.

41
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:24,624
Thank you. Merci beaucoup.

42
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:26,659
I have to say I love this role.

43
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:28,495
I'm excited to play a heroine.

44
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:32,064
To be honest, I think you
might be too young for the role

45
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:34,634
And probably a little too sexy for it.

46
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,437
I can do it another way for you.

47
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,406
Let's try the woman's daughter, okay?

48
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,408
Uh, you can just give me a cold reading

49
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,643
and maybe a little less accent.

50
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:47,013
Page 88 at the top, three lines.

51
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:07,800
It says that I am, um, 20-something

52
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:10,069
drug addict prostitute in a relationship

53
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:14,741
with a married couple and
that I am naked and tied up?

54
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,912
So French.

55
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:41,601
Thank you.

56
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:54,146
Two males, one
African-American, one white.

57
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:02,021
I'll meet you back in the lobby, okay.

58
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:07,026
- Okay.
- Let's move out.

59
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:22,642
What?

60
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:25,578
Never seen a clown before?

61
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:30,049
No funny business, clowny.

62
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,921
I'll be off in a moment.

63
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,729
Fucking hell.

64
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,665
What do we do now?

65
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:47,266
Okay, everyone's gonna be okay.

66
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,235
Just relax. This is officer Munoz.

67
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:50,903
This is officer Munoz.

68
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:53,272
Do you read me? Does anyone read me?

69
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,241
Is anyone on this frequency?

70
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:56,976
Isn't there a phone on the panel?

71
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,811
No. There's a button here.

72
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:01,781
Well, press the fucking button.

73
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:11,858
Jesus.

74
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:13,192
This is officer Munoz.

75
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:15,261
I'm stuck in the elevator, guys. 10-13.

76
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:19,599
- What is a 10-13? -
It's police bullshit for

77
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:20,900
"We're fucked in the fucking asshole."

78
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,068
Do you mind, sir?

79
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,703
Yeah, I fucking mind. Do you mind?

80
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:24,904
Come on, what's it
been, like, two minutes?

81
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:28,107
Can everyone please just shut up?

82
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,277
Doesn't anyone's phones work?

83
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,613
Well, mine is... is... it's so dark.

84
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:35,147
- I don't know if I can find it.
- I don't have any bars.

85
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:36,983
Nah, cell phone bollocks.

86
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:39,285
We're gonna be okay. We're
gonna get out of here.

87
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:41,654
- Why isn't anyone responding?
- And what's that fucking alarm?

88
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:43,790
You're not helping things, sir.

89
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:46,058
Can you just pry open the doors?

90
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:56,035
Let me try. I can do it.

91
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:58,905
Come on!

92
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:00,840
Fucker!

93
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:03,676
I'm not feeling well. So...

94
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,977
what about the ceiling?

95
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:06,979
Can we just open that
up and climb out there?

96
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:08,114
Ladies first.

97
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:10,182
I don't appreciate your humor.

98
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:11,350
Nobody's climbing anywhere.

99
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:12,619
I have a condition, young lady...

100
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:13,986
just hang on, ma'am.

101
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,154
Can't you use your stick?

102
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:19,091
The stick on your belt?

103
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,968
We're in the parking garage.

104
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:30,302
Come on.

105
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:33,339
I'll help you down. One at a time.

106
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:37,810
Be careful.

107
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:39,278
Be careful.

108
00:07:39,311 --> 00:07:41,147
Hang on to me, okay, okay.

109
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,717
I got you. You're all right.

110
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:47,820
Okay, okay.

111
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:48,988
Let's go.

112
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:53,993
Hello.

113
00:07:56,996 --> 00:07:58,064
What?

114
00:07:58,097 --> 00:08:01,267
- Thank you.
- Okay.

115
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:23,322
Merde!

116
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:28,427
I can fucking manage. I'm
not a bleeding spastic.

117
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,863
The exit gate's locked down.

118
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:35,001
Fucking hell. So we
take the fucking stairs.

119
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,740
I don't fucking believe it.

120
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:43,009
Did anyone try the other elevator?

121
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,077
There must be a power outage.

122
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,345
Yeah, but why are the lights still on?

123
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:47,880
Those are the emergency lights.

124
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:50,249
What is the fucking emergency?

125
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:52,051
And how soon will this be over?

126
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:53,820
I need something in my stomach.

127
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:57,389
No way.

128
00:08:57,423 --> 00:08:59,325
Hold that door, hold that door!

129
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,260
Hold that door, hold
that door! Oh, shit.

130
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:03,830
- What's the problem?
- You just locked us in.

131
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:05,898
- A fucking dungeon.
- What are you talking about?

132
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:08,935
Are you sure the exit gates are locked?

133
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:11,070
Ah!

134
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:14,073
- Hey, asshole!
- Who are you people?

135
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:24,083
Come on, let's try to lift it.

136
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,226
- Who's that?
- Hey!

137
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,828
- Help!
- Help!

138
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:36,763
Help!

139
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,173
Help!

140
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:50,176
No, don't leave!

141
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,477
No!

142
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,146
He was looking right at us.

143
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,948
Maybe he went for help.

144
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,149
What are you saying?

145
00:09:57,183 --> 00:10:00,119
We're... we're trapped down here?

146
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:04,090
Why are you dressed like a clown?

147
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,092
Because he is a fucking clown.

148
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,426
This is Officer Munoz.

149
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,029
Does anybody in the
building read me? Come in.

150
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:11,964
I'm not even getting static.

151
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:14,333
Honey, let's just call 911, huh?

152
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,868
Nobody's getting reception.

153
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:19,205
Oh, that alarm is giving me a headache.

154
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:22,074
It's giving us all a headache.

155
00:10:26,378 --> 00:10:29,115
Is that your car?

156
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:36,055
Why is the trunk open?

157
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:47,299
Stop!

158
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,506
- Hey!
- Turn around, bitch!

159
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,175
- Put your gun down!
- You put yours down.

160
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,810
- Put it down and let go of her!
- Put yours down!

161
00:10:57,844 --> 00:10:59,511
Put it down and let the
woman go! Let her go!

162
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:03,850
I'll fucking pull the
trigger! I'll do it right here!

163
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:06,452
Everybody just back away.

164
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:07,519
Nobody fucking move!

165
00:11:07,553 --> 00:11:08,921
Just take your finger

166
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:10,189
Slowly off the trigger.

167
00:11:10,222 --> 00:11:11,858
Can you do that, D?

168
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:13,826
Boom. Her head explodes like a pumpkin.

169
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,928
- You hear what I'm saying?
- Oh, my god, oh, my god.

170
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:17,429
Please, I've got a little girl.

171
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:19,398
- She's got a little girl, D.
- No, no, no, no.

172
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:20,900
I'm getting the hell out of here,

173
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,101
And I'm taking this woman with me.

174
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:24,203
Okay, everybody just move behind me.

175
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:26,939
This man escaped a prison bus last night

176
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,941
and eluded a manhunt...
he's a violent killer.

177
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:31,443
I didn't murder that
woman. I'm innocent.

178
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:34,546
So put the gun down,
and we'll discuss it.

179
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,048
Can you do that, D?

180
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:37,917
Don't you fucking smooth talk me.

181
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,419
Hey, man. Whoa, whoa.

182
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:41,954
There's gotta be a way to negotiate.

183
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:43,890
Nobody's talking to you.

184
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:45,591
It's okay, I'm a lawyer.
I do this for a living.

185
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,526
Please, just put your guns down.

186
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,229
That's the only sensible option here.

187
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:51,530
The only sensible option

188
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:53,099
would be to let me just
walk up out of here.

189
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:54,133
We're trapped down here, D.

190
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,603
Now, I'll lower my gun if you go first.

191
00:11:57,636 --> 00:11:59,271
You put your gun on the floor.

192
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:00,472
I can't give up my gun, I'm sorry.

193
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:01,974
Who's making the fucking rules?

194
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:05,377
- He's gonna kill me!
- Okay, okay.

195
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:08,180
I'll put my gun on the ground
if you let the woman go.

196
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:11,317
But I want you to do the same.

197
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,618
Is that a deal?

198
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:15,521
Well, I have to sit down.

199
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:19,358
I'm... I'm... I'm really...
I'm not feeling well.

200
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:32,338
Fuck.

201
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:35,674
That's the best you're gonna get.

202
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:37,443
You're gonna be okay, ma'am.

203
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:41,280
- You scared me to death.
- I had no other choice.

204
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:45,251
I'm an innocent man, wrongly accused.

205
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:47,419
I fucking believe him, don't you?

206
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:49,188
Well, I'm glad you're
all having a good time.

207
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:50,990
Now I want the fuck out of here!

208
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:52,358
We're locked in here, D!

209
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:54,626
There's been a power outage,

210
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,931
And the doors are sealed, so
you can just cool off, okay?

211
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:00,632
Uh, excuse me?

212
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:05,171
Your friend is bleeding really bad.

213
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:07,940
Fuck him. He ain't my friend.

214
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:10,076
That fool followed me out the hole.

215
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,410
He's gonna die like that.

216
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:14,380
You shouldn't have
fucking shot him then.

217
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:16,148
It's a gutshot.

218
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,350
Nothing y'all can do but let
the motherfucker die in peace.

219
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:20,219
I'm gonna try to radio
for help, all right?

220
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:23,522
- I'm going for my radio...
- Stay off the fucking radio!

221
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:26,959
Hey, hey, D, is it?

222
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:28,594
The officer's right.
We're trapped down here.

223
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:31,030
Now, the only thing we can do

224
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:33,532
is work together and discuss

225
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:35,968
a reasonable solution
to this problem, okay?

226
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:37,203
I look reasonable to you, motherfucker?

227
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:38,437
Hey, I got no dog in this fight.

228
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,339
Then stop fucking lawyering me!

229
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:43,642
All right. You figure it out, cool.

230
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:47,413
Somebody has to figure it out.

231
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:49,581
Can we just please
talk about this, okay?

232
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:52,251
Yeah, let's discuss how you
locked the fucking door on us.

233
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:54,186
We're down here because all
the other floors were locked.

234
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,387
Yeah.

235
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:59,191
How did you get onto the stairs?

236
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:04,130
Why were you in the stairwell?

237
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,332
Now there's a girl you
don't meet every day.

238
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,567
Very fucking high class.

239
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,502
- Shut up.
- I thought you were a lawyer.

240
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:11,637
Same fucking difference.

241
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,305
No, I never said I was a lawyer,

242
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,506
And what does it
matter what I do anyway?

243
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,175
All the other floors were locked?

244
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,543
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, yeah.

245
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:19,078
That's good then.

246
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:20,346
That means there could
be others on the stairs.

247
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:22,014
Getting their own fucking blow jobs.

248
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:25,151
Hey, old lady's in trouble over there.

249
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:36,162
Ma'am? Ma'am, can you hear me?

250
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:37,563
Oh, my god.

251
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:40,699
Ma'am? Ma'am, can you hear me? Ma'am?

252
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:42,034
Let me get in there.
Let me get in there.

253
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:43,035
Okay.

254
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:44,136
Ma'am.

255
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,437
Listen to me, listen to me.

256
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:47,239
- Ma'am.
- Looks like she's dying.

257
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:48,540
Ma'am, you said you had a condition.

258
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:51,143
Can you indicate that?

259
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:53,679
Maybe she's having a heart attack.

260
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:55,481
I've got an AED in my car.

261
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:58,750
Check in her bag if she's got
a prescription or anything.

262
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:00,719
Maybe she's diabetic.

263
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:03,089
I got an auntie in
Tallahassee who's a diabetic.

264
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:05,057
- She could be in insulin shock.
- No, you gotta give her sugar.

265
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,193
- Bleeding sugar.
- Just, like, candy or gum

266
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:09,161
- Or something, anything.
- Here, sugar.

267
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:11,063
- She's trying to say something.
- What do I do? What do I do?

268
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:12,398
Uh, put it on her tongue.

269
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:14,400
- Let me get in there.
- Okay.

270
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:17,703
Hold her head.

271
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:19,171
Move aside.

272
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:24,810
See, this is what happens.

273
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:28,214
This is what happens when I don't eat.

274
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:29,615
Are you going to be all right now?

275
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:34,486
Uh, there's some cheese and
crackers in my car from the airline.

276
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,623
The keys are in my purse.

277
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:43,795
Hey, what happened to that black man?

278
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:59,745
I could have just shot you in the back.

279
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,681
There are cops out on the street, D.

280
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:05,151
How far do you think you'll get
running around with a shotgun?

281
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:07,853
I ain't just doing this for me.

282
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,255
I'm working to spring all y'all.

283
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:11,190
We don't need your help, D.

284
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:13,659
But you do need my cooperation.

285
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:18,597
Now what does that alarm mean?

286
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,299
I think the building could be on fire.

287
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:22,701
What? Get after it, man.

288
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:23,869
Crank up that gate.

289
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:27,439
Well, be my guest, Beverly hills.

290
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:30,209
All right, one of you, go help him.

291
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,581
Jesus Christ.

292
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:42,821
Come on. Give me a hand.

293
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:57,769
All right.

294
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:06,545
I'm a clown. I blow up balloons.

295
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:08,214
No, come on. We need your help!

296
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:10,249
Come on, I think you
were making progress.

297
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:12,618
- Fucking help.
- Why can't he just slide under?

298
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,487
Yeah, you can fit under there.

299
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:17,889
Don't need y'all's fucking advice.

300
00:17:17,923 --> 00:17:21,793
Move, fuck it. Just move.

301
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:29,935
Now you be thinking real hard
about shooting an unarmed man.

302
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:31,937
You put a gun to a woman's head,

303
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,805
And you're telling me what to do?

304
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,409
I let the foreign chick go, didn't I?

305
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:38,877
Tell that to the fucking judge.

306
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,581
Let's get the fuck out of here.

307
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:50,956
Fuck.

308
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:03,269
Innocent man, wrongly accused.

309
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:07,839
All right, your turn.

310
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:10,309
Let's go.

311
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:26,625
- My foot!
- Look out! Oh, my god!

312
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:28,927
Come on! Lift it!

313
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,698
Are you all right?

314
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:34,700
I think so, but it hurts.

315
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:37,803
Oh, great, now we're really
fucking trapped in here.

316
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:40,306
You have to go and get help.

317
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:42,341
I'll find someone to get you out.

318
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:43,575
Find a police officer,

319
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:46,845
and tell them my name is officer Munoz.

320
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:51,983
Where are my cheese and crackers?

321
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:24,516
Oh, my god.

322
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:59,385
Sir! Sir, can you help me, sir?

323
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:00,786
I've got my hands full right now.

324
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:02,454
There are people trapped
in a parking garage.

325
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:03,622
A man is dying.

326
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:04,823
You're gonna have to find an EMT.

327
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:08,560
An EMT? Where do I find an EMT?

328
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:15,701
Help. I need your help.

329
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,436
A lot of people here need help.

330
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,004
There is an officer
trapped in a parking garage

331
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:21,440
Just over there with a
group of other people.

332
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:23,074
- A police officer? Is he hurt?
- She's... no, she's not hurt,

333
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:25,444
But she needs your
assistance. They all need...

334
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:26,745
there are officers in
trouble here on the street.

335
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:27,979
Officers down.

336
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:29,047
Can you tell me what happened?

337
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,382
Nobody knows what's happening.

338
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,783
Nobody knows how many are affected

339
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:33,752
or how widespread this whole mess is.

340
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,931
I need to get word

341
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:47,499
to my husband and daughter in New York.

342
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,167
Forget it, lady. Power's out.

343
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,769
The city's in gridlock.

344
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:53,004
We haven't had communication
since yesterday.

345
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,507
Yesterday? What do you mean?

346
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:19,831
Go, go, go!

347
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:34,105
Stay together!

348
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:51,623
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

349
00:22:51,657 --> 00:22:54,526
Mommy!

350
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,863
- Mom!
- Mommy, help me.

351
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:05,163
I need to get up to my room.

352
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:06,331
- Nobody's allowed upstairs.
- Out of my way.

353
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:07,933
But I've got to get up there.

354
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,067
I'm sorry, but it's for security.

355
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,003
Um, who do I talk to?

356
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:14,706
You're talking to him.

357
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,908
I've got cash. I can pay you.

358
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:27,318
- Come on.
- Do you know what's happening?

359
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:30,689
End of the world, for all I know.

360
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:04,322
Merde, merde, merde!

361
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:06,624
Damn it.

362
00:25:19,938 --> 00:25:21,873
Come with me.

363
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:25,276
I'll give you the money back.

364
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,379
- Be quiet and keep moving.
- You know how to use that?

365
00:25:28,413 --> 00:25:30,048
I'm trained, and I'm deadly.

366
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:34,085
'Cause I don't want an accident.

367
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,987
Here.

368
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:38,389
- What do you want me to do?
- Open it.

369
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:39,825
There's no power to the locks.

370
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:41,059
Kick it in.

371
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:43,995
Well, you got real balls, bitch.

372
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:47,833
You'd better fucking believe I do.

373
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:52,430
Out of my way.

374
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:00,405
Ms. Genereau, Ms. Genereau.

375
00:27:00,438 --> 00:27:02,373
Over here.

376
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:04,442
Hurry up. There's still room.

377
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:05,777
They said the airport is open

378
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:07,245
and that flights are still leaving.

379
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:08,947
- They said that? Who said that?
- The bus driver.

380
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,082
He thinks he can get there
by taking the back roads.

381
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:14,920
Come on, he's got one seat open.

382
00:27:14,953 --> 00:27:16,988
Come on.

383
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:29,868
Hey, can you hear me?

384
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:34,272
- Sir, do you hear me?
- Yeah, I fucking hear you.

385
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:36,307
Is there anything I can do for you?

386
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:40,011
Fucking put a bullet in my head.

387
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:43,081
And then put one in that fucker D’s.

388
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,257
What the fuck are you doing?

389
00:27:57,328 --> 00:28:01,099
This is absolute madness!

390
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:04,302
They've been gone for over an hour.

391
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,306
- We're getting out of here.
- Thank god.

392
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:12,143
Girl's thinking on her feet.
First drink's on me, dear.

393
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,187
There it is again.

394
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,293
What the hell is that?

395
00:28:28,326 --> 00:28:30,061
You wanna die down here?

396
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:32,463
Come on.

397
00:28:32,497 --> 00:28:33,631
Look.

398
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,000
On three. One...

399
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:38,103
two...

400
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:42,273
What's that noise?

401
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:00,992
Where have you been?

402
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:04,029
What the hell happened to you?

403
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:07,365
Come on. Spit it out.

404
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:08,967
What is it?

405
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,135
You don't wanna leave here.

406
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:12,470
What are you talking about?

407
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:15,440
There is no power, no nothing.

408
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:17,342
Something terrible is happening.

409
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,644
- Then I have to get out there.
- No, you don't understand.

410
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:21,579
The police have lost all control.

411
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:33,524
Oh, you can always count on a fireman.

412
00:29:41,132 --> 00:29:43,434
That's no fucking fireman.

413
00:29:45,236 --> 00:29:47,072
Figured y'all would still be here.

414
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:48,373
Where'd you get that truck?

415
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:50,175
It's a rescue vehicle, ain't it?

416
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,044
Look like y'all need rescuing.

417
00:29:59,184 --> 00:30:03,021
Now we're getting serious.

418
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:07,492
How y'all like it behind bars?

419
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,341
This looks absolutely impossible.

420
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:25,376
Yeah, well, that's what I
told myself this morning,

421
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,711
But here I fucking am.

422
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:30,315
Why did you come back for us?

423
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:34,485
Been called a monster my whole life.

424
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,688
Why did you come back?

425
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:40,558
- I promised those people.
- Yeah?

426
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:44,529
Then we're both fucking stupid.

427
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,765
- What are you doing?
- Move, move, move, move.

428
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:51,136
Fucking open the door.

429
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:05,116
Shit, shit, shit.

430
00:31:06,217 --> 00:31:07,352
You okay, dude?

431
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:10,121
- You okay?
- Yes.

432
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:12,623
Get the hell out of my way.

433
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:16,127
- You okay? Here you go.
- Whoa, all right.

434
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:18,463
You're no fucking fireman!

435
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:22,200
He fucking hijacked this truck.

436
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:23,534
Come on, you bitch!

437
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:25,570
- Can we get out?
- Stay in the fucking car.

438
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:27,705
Hey, hey!

439
00:31:27,738 --> 00:31:30,408
Move the fuck out of my way.

440
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:31,409
Whose fucking idea was this?

441
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:34,145
Easy!

442
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:36,181
- Move!
- What are they doing?

443
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:38,516
They're trying to roll us.

444
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,353
I think they want to kill us.

445
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:44,522
Move right now!

446
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:45,723
Stop! Hey!

447
00:31:45,756 --> 00:31:47,358
Go, go, go!

448
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:22,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

449
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:24,862
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

450
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:29,167
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

451
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,750
All right! All right, easy!

452
00:32:45,783 --> 00:32:48,153
Jesus.

453
00:32:48,186 --> 00:32:51,222
Ah, worse than a fucking plane crash.

454
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:53,324
At least you crash-landed in Bel Air.

455
00:32:53,358 --> 00:32:55,226
This is where the old lady lives?

456
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,428
I just had these gates fixed.

457
00:32:57,462 --> 00:33:00,898
Graciela, can you open the gate?

458
00:33:00,931 --> 00:33:03,168
Graciela, I'm home, honey.

459
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:05,336
Who's Graciela? Is that your daughter?

460
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,738
She's my housekeeper, Graciela,

461
00:33:07,772 --> 00:33:10,241
but I don't know why
she's not answering me.

462
00:33:10,275 --> 00:33:12,610
She's not answering
because she can't hear you.

463
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:14,345
The power's out.

464
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:16,481
Maybe we could just climb over.

465
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:18,283
If she had a bleeding bar, we could.

466
00:33:18,316 --> 00:33:19,850
I knew this was a bad idea.

467
00:33:19,884 --> 00:33:21,319
We should have just gone to the station.

468
00:33:21,352 --> 00:33:22,653
What we should have done is gone home,

469
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:24,255
But you saw the situation
out there, right?

470
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:25,823
She says she has food for us here.

471
00:33:25,856 --> 00:33:27,458
Dining in the fucking dark, so...

472
00:33:27,492 --> 00:33:28,559
Hey, y'all, we need a place to sleep.

473
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:30,361
Okay, everyone just stop,

474
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:31,662
- And let's figure this out.
- Just stop?

475
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:33,431
You're an officer. You haven't...

476
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:34,532
- is that the best you got?
- That's your plan?

477
00:33:40,738 --> 00:33:43,508
Everyone get out of the way!

478
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:52,350
Pfft!

479
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:42,500
Graciela, I'm home, dear.

480
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:43,934
Wow.

481
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:49,774
You live here all by yourself?

482
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:52,477
With Graciela, wherever she is.

483
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,580
Fucking died and went to heaven.

484
00:34:55,613 --> 00:34:59,350
This house must be worth a fortune.

485
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:02,620
It's worth 100 million
if it's worth a penny.

486
00:35:02,653 --> 00:35:05,623
Who makes $100 million?

487
00:35:05,656 --> 00:35:07,458
Not all the clowns in the world.

488
00:35:07,492 --> 00:35:11,696
Excuse me. I'd like
to try the telephone.

489
00:35:11,729 --> 00:35:14,699
Well, there's one in the kitchen.

490
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:17,568
Hi, mom.

491
00:35:17,602 --> 00:35:20,305
Give me a kiss to the camera.

492
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:21,972
- Mwah.
- Oh!

493
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:24,842
- Seafood, look at that.
- And to daddy too?

494
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,611
- A kiss.
- Look at daddy. No?

495
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:29,680
No? Just mommy. You prefer mommy, right?

496
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,720
Shy in front of the camera.

497
00:35:35,753 --> 00:35:37,988
Any luck with the phone?

498
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:40,891
There wasn't even a dial tone.

499
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:42,393
Hmm.

500
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:45,730
This food's gonna spoil.

501
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:48,366
Do you know there is no water?

502
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:54,972
I think the shit has hit the fan.

503
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:56,407
You're not saying this is some kind

504
00:35:56,441 --> 00:35:58,075
of terrorist attack or something.

505
00:35:58,108 --> 00:36:01,011
I work with people who have
their hands on the hot buttons,

506
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:02,847
people who work at the highest levels.

507
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,015
And they all assure me it's
not a matter of "if," you know,

508
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:06,984
but "when."

509
00:36:14,692 --> 00:36:17,662
♪ out came the sun and dried... ♪

510
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:21,866
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't believe this.

511
00:36:21,899 --> 00:36:24,902
Me neither. Caviar.

512
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,052
Oh.

513
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:47,091
I'm gonna fucking marry this woman.

514
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,762
Graciela?

515
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:54,098
Graciela? Honey?

516
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:01,539
Graciela?

517
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,141
Graciela?

518
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:07,044
Where are you...

519
00:37:07,077 --> 00:37:10,481
oh, there's a strange man in the house!

520
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:11,749
It's okay, don't be frightened.

521
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:13,384
Who are you? What do you want?

522
00:37:13,418 --> 00:37:15,119
It's okay. I don't want anything.

523
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:17,588
- What did you do with Graciela?
- I didn't do anything with her.

524
00:37:17,622 --> 00:37:19,123
Then what are you doing in my house?

525
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:23,594
Nothing. I came here with you?

526
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:25,463
It's me, David.

527
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,432
The clown.

528
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:36,507
You people are trying to kill me.

529
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:50,521
How much that fucking set you back?

530
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,022
I just pay her health insurance.

531
00:37:52,056 --> 00:37:54,659
You're fucking shitting me, right?

532
00:37:54,692 --> 00:37:57,795
Her COBRA plan was,
like, a grand a month.

533
00:37:57,828 --> 00:37:59,697
I figure it's a win-win.

534
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,066
Obamacare cover that?

535
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,534
It better,

536
00:38:03,568 --> 00:38:06,103
or she's shit out of luck.

537
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:13,043
I tell ya, I got a
fucking COBRA plan for her.

538
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:39,036
Ya mind if I mixed in?

539
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:40,705
I was just getting out, actually.

540
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:43,574
Ah, right.

541
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,745
Then may I assist you with your cape?

542
00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:02,793
We're really no different, are we,

543
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:05,530
than this helpless little bee?

544
00:39:05,563 --> 00:39:08,999
We got the milk of human kindness.

545
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:14,672
You know, I'm really
frightened about all this.

546
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:18,042
Allow the shelter of my arms.

547
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:21,011
How will we pay for our sins?

548
00:39:23,247 --> 00:39:25,282
As part of the health plan?

549
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:27,852
The book of revelation?

550
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:30,955
Have you ever read it?

551
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:33,524
I mean, have you ever really read it?

552
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:35,159
You speaking of the Bible?

553
00:39:35,192 --> 00:39:37,995
Maybe that explains everything.

554
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:39,530
What it is John saw

555
00:39:39,564 --> 00:39:42,900
about the serpent and
who the prostitute is.

556
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:47,171
I prefer "escort" or "fille de joie."

557
00:39:57,682 --> 00:40:01,185
Or moggy fucking skanky whore.

558
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:11,562
Put down the shotgun and eat, D,

559
00:40:11,596 --> 00:40:14,264
or it's gonna be a long night.

560
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:17,101
What, are we best
friends now or something?

561
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:19,904
Hmm?

562
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:21,939
Cop shoots a nigga every 28 hours.

563
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:23,741
Does anyone know what day it is?

564
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:28,045
The date... it's Wednesday the 28th.

565
00:40:28,078 --> 00:40:30,881
But I was told we haven't had
communication for a whole day.

566
00:40:30,915 --> 00:40:35,185
Why would they say such a thing?

567
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:39,657
- Well, that's really weird.
- What... what is really weird?

568
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,159
The old lady and I share
a birthday, March the 7th.

569
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:45,896
March the 7th? That's...
that's my birthday.

570
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,131
Get out. You're kidding me.

571
00:40:47,164 --> 00:40:49,900
That's my birthday too.

572
00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:53,103
When's your birthday?

573
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:57,107
My birthday? March 7th, why?

574
00:40:57,141 --> 00:40:59,810
- Who is he? Who are you?
- He's the fucking clown.

575
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:00,978
How do you know he's the clown?

576
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:04,314
Who wears pants like that?

577
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:06,784
When's your birthday, clown?

578
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:09,920
It's David. It's March 7th.

579
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:12,890
March 7th? That's my birthday.

580
00:41:12,923 --> 00:41:15,125
March 7th is my birthday.

581
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:17,394
March 7th is everyone's birthday.

582
00:41:17,427 --> 00:41:19,296
What are you pointing that at me for?

583
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:21,899
We'd like to know your birthday.

584
00:41:21,932 --> 00:41:23,267
None of your fucking business.

585
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,670
He's been drinking. He's drunk.

586
00:41:25,703 --> 00:41:27,638
- He was drunk on the elevator.
- So?

587
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:29,807
Is that a fucking crime?

588
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,342
It's a misdemeanor, actually.

589
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:39,116
Not in my fucking country, it ain't.

590
00:41:42,687 --> 00:41:45,055
What do you do here? In America?

591
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:48,726
- I don't work a fucking circus.
- I do private birthday parties.

592
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,194
So does she, I fucking betcha.

593
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:52,763
Hey, there's no need
to insult her, okay?

594
00:41:52,797 --> 00:41:55,766
Or what? Wanna fucking fight?

595
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,136
It's been a long, strange day.
Tempers are a little short here.

596
00:41:59,169 --> 00:42:00,304
And why must everything be

597
00:42:00,337 --> 00:42:02,106
"Fuck you, fuck this, fuck that"?

598
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:03,774
It's a manner of fucking speaking.

599
00:42:03,808 --> 00:42:07,277
"It's a manner of fucking speaking."

600
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:08,679
Do you even have any friends?

601
00:42:08,713 --> 00:42:10,314
In high fucking places, ya twink.

602
00:42:10,347 --> 00:42:11,816
How do you even know I'm gay?

603
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:15,052
You're gay as fucking Christmas.

604
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:17,287
You are just a hateful human being.

605
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:19,423
It's them fucking parades I hate.

606
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:22,292
You know, hate speech
in itself is a crime.

607
00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:23,393
Oh, yeah, right.

608
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:25,029
Fucking murderer standing there,

609
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:26,997
yet I'm the fucking criminal.

610
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:28,432
I'd watch yourself there, Ireland.

611
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:31,001
You know, I've always wanted to know,

612
00:42:31,035 --> 00:42:34,038
what's it fucking like to kill someone?

613
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:35,205
You always wanted to know?

614
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,741
Don't pretend you haven't

615
00:42:36,774 --> 00:42:37,942
fucking thought about it, mademoiselle.

616
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:39,243
I never thought about it once.

617
00:42:39,276 --> 00:42:41,245
Aw, I've thought about it plenty.

618
00:42:41,278 --> 00:42:42,713
I'm thinking about it right now.

619
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:44,148
So what's the fucking answer?

620
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:46,050
I don't know what the fucking answer is.

621
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,952
I've never killed anybody
my whole fucking life.

622
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,453
Two foul mouths in my house.

623
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:51,121
Well, then why'd they put you in prison?

624
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:52,356
'Cause I'm a black man.

625
00:42:52,389 --> 00:42:54,024
And the prison industrial complex

626
00:42:54,058 --> 00:42:55,760
needs black men to feed your system.

627
00:42:55,793 --> 00:42:57,094
There's more niggas in prison today

628
00:42:57,127 --> 00:42:59,329
than there were slaves in the civil war.

629
00:42:59,363 --> 00:43:00,831
How long were you in prison?

630
00:43:00,865 --> 00:43:03,968
I've been incarcerated 13 goddamn years.

631
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,402
You ever take one for the home team?

632
00:43:05,435 --> 00:43:07,204
Fuck you, motherfucking shamrock.

633
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:09,039
Up the Queen's bridal path.

634
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:10,440
Aren't you afraid that
he's gonna shoot you?

635
00:43:10,474 --> 00:43:11,942
Okay, okay, we're gonna shut this down.

636
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:14,211
Says he's never killed anybody.

637
00:43:14,244 --> 00:43:16,513
I take the man at his fucking word.

638
00:43:16,546 --> 00:43:18,949
Oh, I didn't say I never shot a man.

639
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:22,019
I'm out of here.

640
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:23,921
That the way they do it in prison?

641
00:43:23,954 --> 00:43:25,455
Yeah.

642
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:29,994
Fight like a fucking
man, ya lepre-coon.

643
00:43:35,966 --> 00:43:39,103
Fight like a man, huh? Fight like a man?

644
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:41,305
Stop it! Stop it!

645
00:43:42,439 --> 00:43:44,875
- Oh, my goodness.
- Come on!

646
00:43:44,909 --> 00:43:46,811
Stop it, stop it!

647
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:49,079
Just stop it!

648
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:52,449
I'm tired of this. I'm sick of it.

649
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:56,153
Don't any of you have families at all

650
00:43:56,186 --> 00:43:58,889
that you're worried about?

651
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:04,094
Well, if you don't, I do.

652
00:44:04,128 --> 00:44:06,130
I just want this to be over.

653
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:10,367
I want to know my husband
and daughter are safe.

654
00:44:13,203 --> 00:44:16,240
I just wanna go.

655
00:44:18,876 --> 00:44:22,146
Someone's coming. Maybe it's help.

656
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:47,371
Oh, that's Graciela's little car.

657
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:53,343
Who the fuck are these guys?

658
00:44:53,377 --> 00:44:55,312
Anybody moves, and you're dead.

659
00:44:55,345 --> 00:44:58,115
Stop! I'm a police officer.

660
00:44:58,148 --> 00:45:00,150
I am armed, and I will shoot you.

661
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:01,952
Oh, look at the chica fuerte.

662
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:17,167
We don't need no unnecessary violence.

663
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,974
Mujer, someone wanna talk with you.

664
00:45:24,008 --> 00:45:27,577
Graciela, come talk to Francis.

665
00:45:27,611 --> 00:45:32,382
Oh!

666
00:45:35,052 --> 00:45:37,187
Lo siento, Francis.

667
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:40,290
I didn't want to come to your house.

668
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:43,127
They made me.

669
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,494
It's... it's all right, Graciela.

670
00:45:49,299 --> 00:45:52,636
They want numbers to the safe.

671
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:55,605
Please, I don't want them to hurt you.

672
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:57,908
I-I don't remember the combination.

673
00:45:57,942 --> 00:46:01,445
I don't even... I-I have
it written down somewhere

674
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:03,147
in the... in the... in the house.

675
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,249
Well, then, go find it for us, chocha.

676
00:46:08,485 --> 00:46:10,654
Get in the house, now!

677
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,489
Go!

678
00:46:12,522 --> 00:46:14,291
Go, go, go! Wait up!

679
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:21,598
Keep going! Don't stop!

680
00:46:24,668 --> 00:46:26,670
Wait!

681
00:46:27,604 --> 00:46:29,339
Wait!

682
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,441
Keep running!

683
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:36,346
Hey.

684
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,448
Help her! She needs help.

685
00:46:38,482 --> 00:46:40,017
My glasses! I can't...

686
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:44,388
where are they? I can't...

687
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:48,558
Fuck. Fuck.

688
00:46:48,592 --> 00:46:50,327
I can't... I can't see a thing!

689
00:46:53,263 --> 00:46:55,966
Drop the fucking box and run!

690
00:46:58,268 --> 00:47:00,304
Fuck! Come on!

691
00:47:13,217 --> 00:47:16,420
- Stop!
- Keep moving, keep running.

692
00:47:16,453 --> 00:47:18,388
- I left my purse in the house.
- Forget the fucking purse.

693
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:20,757
But my phone is in it.

694
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:28,065
I ca... I can't see a thing.

695
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:31,035
We're over here! We need help.

696
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:32,336
I'm with the old woman.

697
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:34,604
- Help!
- What the fuck are you doing?

698
00:47:34,638 --> 00:47:37,041
- The old woman, she needs help.
- Fuck the old woman!

699
00:47:37,074 --> 00:47:39,576
- Aah!
- Wade!

700
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:42,712
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

701
00:47:42,746 --> 00:47:45,049
Oh, fuck me!

702
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:48,752
- What did you do?
- I fucking broke my leg.

703
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,120
I think I fucking snapped it!

704
00:47:50,154 --> 00:47:51,621
Oh, my god, are you in pain?

705
00:47:51,655 --> 00:47:53,390
Yes, I'm in fucking pain!

706
00:47:53,423 --> 00:47:55,125
- Okay, okay.
- Fuck!

707
00:47:57,661 --> 00:47:59,696
Who's there?

708
00:48:11,675 --> 00:48:13,077
Bleeding black forest out here.

709
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:14,411
Are you okay? Are you all right?

710
00:48:14,444 --> 00:48:19,349
All right? Do I fucking look all right?

711
00:48:19,383 --> 00:48:21,218
I'm sorry you fucking asked.

712
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,523
Stop!

713
00:48:26,556 --> 00:48:28,592
- We have to stop.
- I see a light over there.

714
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:32,329
- We can't leave the others.
- Hey, I came back.

715
00:48:32,362 --> 00:48:37,334
I did my part. Now it's
every man for himself.

716
00:48:41,805 --> 00:48:45,075
Then I'm going back for them!

717
00:48:50,814 --> 00:48:53,517
Hey!

718
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:55,385
Just... fuck!

719
00:48:55,419 --> 00:48:57,654
Just wait here for us.

720
00:48:57,687 --> 00:48:59,223
Wait right here.

721
00:48:59,256 --> 00:49:01,558
Fuck.

722
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:33,557
Hello?

723
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,826
Who is there?

724
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,629
Who is that?

725
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:09,926
Hey!

726
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:14,931
What is it? What is it?

727
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:23,240
- What is that?
- What the fuck is that?

728
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:25,909
Fucking hell.

729
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:27,744
Oh, ew.

730
00:51:05,749 --> 00:51:08,352
This can't be happening.

731
00:54:18,575 --> 00:54:20,510
Who made this?

732
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:26,510
Godem
