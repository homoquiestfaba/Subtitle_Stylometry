1
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:17,349
Mr. Zander,
former Green Beret.

2
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,022
Medal of Honor
recipient.

3
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,659
CIA operative.

4
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:33,665
rmer head of the Black
Cobra Mercenary Society.

5
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,837
I thought you would have
been a bigger challenge,

6
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,174
but what a
disappointment you are.

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,978
You're beginning
to sound like my father.

8
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,016
Is there anything you
would like to tell us now?

9
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,851
Yeah.

10
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,587
I want to thank you.

11
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:59,158
You just saved me 1.500 bucks
in a root canal.

12
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,895
Heh.

13
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,532
Joke.

14
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,469
Don't misunderstand me.

15
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,805
I find you very funny,

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,310
but I'm done with you
and your jokes.

17
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:23,048
So tell me, Mr. Zander,

18
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,984
do you have
any final words

19
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,720
before I remove your
head from your body?

20
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:33,258
Yeah, I do.

21
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,564
Nice leg.

22
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,504
Aah!
Aah!

23
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,777
<i>Sayonara, amigos.</i>

24
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,586
Cut!

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,887
Cut! Cut!

26
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,388
Darren, where are you?
Where are you?

27
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,090
I-Is this how you
take care of me?

28
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,825
It was supposed to be
taken care of.

29
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,926
What happened?

30
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,061
Sorry. It just
malfunctioned.

31
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,162
My bad, baby.
My bad.

32
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,163
Malfunctioned?
My bad.

33
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,764
Wait. This is smoke.

34
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,066
How could smoke
not function?

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,200
No. We don't use
smoke anymore.

36
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,435
No, no, no.

37
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,070
No, no.
"Red Rocket" was smoke.

38
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,905
That was whoosh. This is
different. This is wheesh.

39
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,273
This is liquid
nitrogen, new formula,

40
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,574
and it's safe
until it explodes.

41
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,376
Nitrogen? Are you kidding me?
Yes.

42
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,678
This is a chemical. This
can't be good for my body.

43
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,080
Oh, baby,
you look fabulous.

44
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,548
Yeah, man. You really
do look fabulous.

45
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,949
Let's move on to scene 87.
Sorry, boss.

46
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,351
Let's get
the green screen lit.

47
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,418
Let's get Colton
in his new wardrobe.

48
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,853
87? Hold on.
Wait a minute.

49
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,121
Wait a minute.
Darren, I'm not doing 87.

50
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,389
I'm wrapped.
I can't do this.

51
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,457
We have to do scene 87.
I need you

52
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,458
in the scene
with the bugs.

53
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,959
What bugs? I hate bugs.

54
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,427
I can't do a bug movie.
I'm not doing...

55
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,929
It's so funny
that you say that,

56
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,631
because you're in a
bug movie right now.

57
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,865
That's what's happening.
I'm in a bug movie?

58
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,901
When did this
become a bug movie?

59
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,636
It became a bug movie when the writer
put his fingers on the keyboard.

60
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,104
Excuse me. I hope she's
a good friend of yours,

61
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,238
because you
just got her fired.

62
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,373
Hit that
with something heavy.

63
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,807
If I see that
near your face,

64
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,309
your face is in
the unemployment office.

65
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,877
What page is there
a bug movie?

66
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,279
What page?
Did you read the script?

67
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,547
Yeah, I looked it over.

68
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,081
What do you mean
you looked it over?

69
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,384
Did you put it on a coffee table
and look at it,

70
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,786
or did you read it?
I read most of it, Darren.

71
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,588
Come on. We're done here.
We're not done.

72
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,056
We're not done.
Oh, really?

73
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,991
Look, we're into
four hours of overtime,

74
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,395
and you promised me I could take
my kid to see his favorite team.

75
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,498
You promised me that you would
be a team player on this shoot,

76
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,267
that I wouldn't have to put up
with your crap this time.

77
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,136
I've been here for 16
hours choking on smoke.

78
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,805
How much more of a
team player do you want?

79
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,507
Don't walk out that door.
Really?

80
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,908
You're making a mistake.
Really?

81
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:30,909
Thank you, Amber.

82
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,177
Oh, come on. Get bent.

83
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,645
Don't walk out that door,
Colton.

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,247
Okay, you did.
Now don't walk to your car.

85
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,082
Really? Okay, it's
over for you if you do.

86
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,650
Over? Come on.
Yeah.

87
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,319
We know each other
10 years. We're buddies.

88
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,020
10 years is nothing
in this business.

89
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,689
I'm done with you.
Oh, come on.

90
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,591
Look, Darren, you know
the only reason

91
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,092
the producers
put me in this

92
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,094
is to put my face
on the video box.

93
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,930
On a video box? Did you just
time-travel here from the nineties?

94
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,599
This is your problem.

95
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,634
You live in a world of car
phones and fax machines.

96
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,768
You're living in the past.

97
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,103
"Red Rocket"
was 20 years ago.

98
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,138
"Clown Cops"
was 25 years ago.

99
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,008
You have to realize I only put you
in this move as a favor to Arni.

100
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,943
I'm making a movie about
giant cockroaches, okay?

101
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,279
It sells itself. It doesn't
need this, not anymore.

102
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,314
Look, you don't have to say
that. That's not really nice.

103
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,549
We're friends. Come on.

104
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,883
Not anymore.
I'm done with you.

105
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,218
Come on, Darren.

106
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,220
I'm gonna see you
tomorrow morning.

107
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,522
Not unless I'm down at the
unemployment office, you won't.

108
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,690
Okay, bye, Colton.

109
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,660
Meg, get Arni
on the phone.

110
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,237
A recent swarm of earthquakes

111
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,740
has been rocking
Southern California.

112
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,808
Dr. Deckert Serbi is here
to talk about what is happening.

113
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,245
Thank you for spending some time
with us today, Doctor.

114
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,246
This is Colton.

115
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,714
You walked off the set?

116
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,182
Are you kidding me
right now?

117
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,684
Are you kidding me,
Arni?

118
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,219
It's a freaking
cockroach movie.

119
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,087
He didn't read the script.

120
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,490
It's what's
being offered.

121
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,026
It's $10.000
for one day's work,

122
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,028
and I had to beg
to get it for you!

123
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,497
Well, you know what? They
can keep the money, okay?

124
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,999
You know, I'm looking for something
with integrity and respect.

125
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,201
Do you know that word,
Arni? "Respect."

126
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,270
You know, I'm better
than this crap.

127
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,271
No, you're not.

128
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,507
I promised them...

129
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,610
No, I swore to them
you would be a mensch!

130
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,945
Nobody is more menschy
than me. You know that.

131
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,748
Look, I just
bailed you out of jail.

132
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,585
You were five seconds away from
orange is the new ass in town.

133
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,755
They kept me four hours
after my day, okay?

134
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,856
I don't care!

135
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,525
You owe me money, Colt!

136
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,428
Just turn your car around,
please, and go to work!

137
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,563
Arni, I got another call.

138
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,798
No more bug movies.

139
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,566
Don't you hang up on me!

140
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,201
Don't! Don't!

141
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,136
Mother... Maggie!

142
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,738
Hi, honey.

143
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,573
Where the hell
are you?

144
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,975
It's nice to hear
your voice, too, sweetheart.

145
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,378
The game starts
in 20 minutes.

146
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,913
Did you forget?

147
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,382
No. Honey,
this is Los Angeles.

148
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,783
Nobody gets to a game
before the fourth inning.

149
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,618
You know that.

150
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,287
Whatever.
I'm out of here.

151
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,256
Uh, he's on...
he's on his way, sweetheart.

152
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,926
I've heard it before.

153
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,561
Wyatt.

154
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,898
Great. He just walked
out of the house.

155
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,734
What's with that kid?

156
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,135
He doesn't listen
anymore.

157
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,270
Tell him the freeway's
a parking lot.

158
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,573
I'm gonna get there
as soon as I can.

159
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,008
You know what?
You tell him.

160
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,344
Colton West is
in the news again.

161
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,679
Why are you
on TV?

162
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,181
According to
law enforcement sources,

163
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,685
nineties movie star and
action hero Colton West

164
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,020
was booked last night
in Santa Monica

165
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,090
on charges of aggravated assault
and resisting arrest.

166
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,594
I guess that's one way to get
yourself back in the public eye.

167
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,429
What kind of trouble
are you in now?

168
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,698
I don't know, honey.
I really don't know.

169
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,533
You know what?
I don't care.

170
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,801
Goodbye, Colton.

171
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,804
Whoa.
Did you feel that?

172
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,205
Whoa!

173
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,107
We're having an earthquake.

174
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,942
Yeah, honey,
are you okay?

175
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,811
Olivia, are you okay?

176
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,018
Whoa!
You see that?!

177
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,531
Everybody
take cover!

178
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,232
Aah!

179
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,541
Come on.

180
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,376
Come on. Come on.

181
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,197
Come on, answer.

182
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,532
Answer.

183
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,936
Reports are pouring in
of an unprecedented

184
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,239
geological event
occurring in Los Angeles.

185
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,940
How 'bout biological?

186
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,209
How 'bout volcanic,
you moron?

187
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,612
This is
a freaking apocalypse!

188
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,086
In a follow-up story,
the Malibu bar fight

189
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,289
involving nineties movie star
and action hero, Colton West,

190
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,559
who was made famous
by his role as the Red Rocket

191
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,162
and made famous the expression,
"Nice" anything.

192
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,098
Nice nose.

193
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,099
Nice tattoo. Yah!

194
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,437
Nice tentacle.

195
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,805
Eyewitnesses are now
coming forward

196
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,108
to say that Colton West
was in fact

197
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,676
trying to be a peacemaker.

198
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,945
If that in fact is the case,

199
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,080
then this reporter
has one thing to say.

200
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,782
Nice job.

201
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,752
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

202
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,520
The earthquakes
that have been shaking

203
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,522
the L.A. basin
the last few minutes

204
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,025
are in fact tied
to a volcanic eruption

205
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,162
in the Santa Monica Mountains
near the Sepulveda Pass.

206
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,597
Now, this would be

207
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:29,167
an unprecedented volcanic event
that... Okay.

208
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,548
Why is there
still no Internet?

209
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,784
Damn it!

210
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,719
You get Colton
on the phone yet?

211
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,554
No. It keeps going
to voice mail.

212
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,723
You guys
have to see this.

213
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,326
One of my friends
just sent this to me.

214
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,732
Yeah, that's great.

215
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,634
My kid has
that app, too.

216
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,835
Take a video
of anything,

217
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,303
you can nuke it,
alien invade it,

218
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,072
smash it with a meteor. What?

219
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,707
He's already killed the
neighbor's cat 30 times.

220
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,308
Oh, my God!

221
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,710
That was a big one,
you guys.

222
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,044
I think
we should go home.

223
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,045
I think
you're right.

224
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,814
That's a first.

225
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,315
Now!

226
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,584
Okay.

227
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,386
Son of a...

228
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,262
Spiders.
Did the spiders come?

229
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,831
Have you seen
the spiders?

230
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,232
Why didn't you tell me
about the bar fight?

231
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,001
The bar... bar fight
was nothing!

232
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,035
Nothing?
What...

233
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,436
It's all over the news.

234
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,904
"Colton West
is in trouble again."

235
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,239
Did Arni bail you out?

236
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,574
None of that matters.
Nothing matters.

237
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,709
What matters
is you're okay.

238
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,378
Thank God, honey,
you're okay.

239
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,279
You're not gonna believe
what I saw.

240
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,281
You're not gonna believe
what's going on on the freeway.

241
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,282
Where's Wyatt?

242
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,717
He left, remember?

243
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,052
When did he do that?

244
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,387
Of course you
don't remember. He...

245
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,122
You forgot to pick
him up for his game,

246
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,757
so he just walked
out of the house.

247
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,225
Honey, have you seen
the news?

248
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,227
Yes! You had a bar fight.

249
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,763
Call Wyatt,
and get him back here.

250
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,198
I have been
calling Wyatt,

251
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,634
but of course
he's not picking up.

252
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,573
You know what? I'm just gonna
go teach my kickboxing class.

253
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,042
You're not
teaching anything.

254
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,276
You're not going anywhere.

255
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,577
Honey, it's not safe
out there.

256
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,745
I don't want you
going anywhere.

257
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,313
Stop it.
You're scaring me.

258
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,082
All right, I'm sorry!
What do you want from me?

259
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,151
I want you to talk to me
like a normal human being.

260
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,252
Okay. Okay. Sweetheart,

261
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,920
did you feel
the earthquake?

262
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:29,988
Yes.

263
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,989
Good! Good!

264
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,157
I felt the earthquake.

265
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,625
It was an earthquake.
Right.

266
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,260
The fifth one this year.

267
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,295
It's not like it's
the end of the world.

268
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,230
Yes, it is, believe me.
The Santa Monica Mountains

269
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,599
erupted like a volcano.
I was on the freeway,

270
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,069
and I saw spiders
the size of men

271
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,571
raining on hoods and spitting
fire out of their mouths.

272
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,806
Fire out of their mouths.

273
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,607
Have you
been drinking again?

274
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,242
No.
You know what?

275
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,777
That's it. I'm
calling Dr. Hertzberg.

276
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,179
Honey, wait.
No, no, no. Stop it.

277
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,647
In the car now.
Honey, stop it.

278
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,749
I am not on anything.
I am completely sober.

279
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,250
I need you
to listen to me.

280
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,518
Sweetheart,
listen to me.

281
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,587
I love you, okay?
I need you to pack

282
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,655
everything that's
important to us.

283
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,090
I want you to take the dog,

284
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,458
I want you take
your jewelry,

285
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,326
and I want you
to pack everything up,

286
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,995
and you have to listen to me,
and we have to leave here.

287
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,367
Colton,
we don't have a dog.

288
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,038
Colton! Colton!

289
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,875
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.
What is that for?

290
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,678
I'm going to get Wyatt.
Honey, did you call him or not?

291
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,013
Okay, okay. I was standing
here, talking to you.

292
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,849
He said he was
going to Travis'.

293
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,218
Oh, damn. Then he's probably
downtown riding bikes.

294
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,986
Look, just stay
in the house.

295
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,355
If he comes back, you
keep him here. You got it?

296
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,057
Circuits are busy.

297
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,492
Well, just keep trying.

298
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,994
And tell everybody
to stay off the freeway.

299
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,321
All right, get this.
Get this.

300
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,356
Here he goes.
Here he goes.

301
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,994
Whoo!

302
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,263
Ah, wicked, man!

303
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,665
Hey, dawg. I didn't
know you were coming.

304
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,200
Glad you could
make it out.

305
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,434
Hey, Jordan.
Sick move, man.

306
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,769
Thanks.
Yeah.

307
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,337
Should have been here
five minutes ago.

308
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,939
Yeah. You should've seen.
My girl was sick.

309
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,440
So are you
riding with us today?

310
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,242
Yeah, for sure, if it's
cool with you guys.

311
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,710
Of course.
Hell, yeah.

312
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,212
Oh, right on. Let's go.

313
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,949
Don't even think
about it.

314
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,351
I've been trying forever
to get her out here.

315
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,352
What did I do?

316
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,054
Gave her a flirty smile.

317
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,356
I did?
Yeah.

318
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,758
Oh, okay. Well, um,
Eli's the one

319
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,126
riding with her
right now,

320
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,427
so you might wanna
go jump in on that.

321
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,930
Dude, I don't care
about Eli.

322
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,298
Don't mess this up
for me, man.

323
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,767
Dude, relax.
It's... It's good.

324
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,535
Come on. Let's just...
Come on. Let's ride.

325
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,703
Whoa!

326
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,205
Dude.

327
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,239
What just happened?

328
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,910
Whoa, did you guys
see that?

329
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,481
That was big.

330
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,750
Yeah. Let's check it out.

331
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,289
Are you coming?

332
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,158
What? Um...

333
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,327
yeah. Yeah.

334
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,667
Hey, it's Wyatt.
I'm not here right now.

335
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,336
Leave a message.
Damn it.

336
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,176
Damn. Oh. What the...

337
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,449
What the...

338
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,063
Are you kidding me?

339
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,572
My God!

340
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,057
Hello.

341
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,725
Hey, Doris.
It's Olivia.

342
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,061
You're checking up
on me, aren't you?

343
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,462
I'm fine, darling.

344
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,464
40 years here,
and I swear

345
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,900
I'll never get used
to these earthquakes.

346
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,302
I know, right?

347
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,003
Hey, listen, is your power
out over there?

348
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,338
Yeah,
couple minutes ago.

349
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,006
Must be
the whole neighborhood.

350
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,007
You need candles?

351
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,075
No, no, no, I'm good.

352
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,576
You okay?
I don't know.

353
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,578
Colton was just here,
and he was ranting

354
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,215
about some kind of a disaster, and
it actually shook me up a little.

355
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,550
Earthquakes, fires,

356
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,252
rolling blackouts,
mudslides,

357
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,920
the Governator.
We're Californians.

358
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,255
We've been
through worse.

359
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,690
Yeah, I guess.

360
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,891
Is he still home?

361
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,026
No, no. He went
to go get Wyatt.

362
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,895
They're gonna be back
in little bit.

363
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,031
What now?

364
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,233
Olivia, can you
hold on a second?

365
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,202
Coco's barking. I need
to see what's going on.

366
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,236
Yeah, sure.

367
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,610
Coco.

368
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,848
Coco!

369
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,783
Where are you?

370
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,300
Coco, where are you?

371
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,502
Where have you gone?

372
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,910
Why...

373
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,588
Doris?

374
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,789
Doris!

375
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,261
Whoa.

376
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,896
Hold on.
Whoa, look at that.

377
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,197
Wow.
Whoa, guys.

378
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,966
Hold up. Hold up.
Hold up.

379
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,468
Oh, man.

380
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,776
Who you think
happened here?

381
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,611
The ground just started
breaking up.

382
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,312
Looks like
a bomb hit.

383
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,748
What?

384
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,390
Hold up.
You smell that?

385
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,958
That smells
like gas.

386
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,927
Guys, let's get
out of here.

387
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,662
Yeah, I'm with Wyatt.
Come on.

388
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,868
Go! Go!

389
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,606
Wyatt! Wyatt!

390
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,775
Jordan, hold on!

391
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,412
Come on! Come on!

392
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,281
Something bit me.
Can you ride?

393
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,649
Go!

394
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,184
Go! Go!

395
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,285
Go! Go! Go!

396
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,853
Come on.

397
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,631
Yo!

398
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,033
Yo, stop!

399
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,802
Yo! Yo! Yo!

400
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:25,937
Stop!

401
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,271
Stop! Stop! Stop!

402
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,673
Please stop!

403
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,222
What the heck
is that guy doing there?

404
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,523
Hey!
Oh, my God.

405
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,824
Hey! Hey, hey!

406
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,825
Everyone...
Hey, stop!

407
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,393
Stop! Hey!

408
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,697
It's the Red Rocket
himself, Colton West!

409
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,998
Hey!

410
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,000
Look, look, no time
for a tour, okay?

411
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,702
Did you not see
the volcano?

412
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,370
There's a catastrophe
going on.

413
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,205
No, no, it's just a
little earthquake, Colton.

414
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,907
No. No. It's not
a little earthquake, man.

415
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,542
You guys
are in a lot of trouble.

416
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,144
You gotta get out of here.

417
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,912
You gotta get these people
to a safe place.

418
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,913
Look, what's your name?

419
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:09,914
Joe.
Joe?

420
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,215
Okay, Joe. Joe, I need...

421
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,384
Joe, I need
your focus on me, okay?

422
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,319
Joe, I need to get
downtown to get my son.

423
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,354
Can you help me?

424
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,588
But just first,
just get

425
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,157
a quick little selfie.
Do you mind?

426
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,424
No, Joe, we don't
have time for pictures.

427
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,826
My wife would
just love this.

428
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,494
Joe, just please...
just take me downtown.

429
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,163
No, wait! Right.
No, no. No, better!

430
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,364
You and the bus.

431
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,698
It would be,
like, awesome PR,

432
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,167
just right there
in front of the bus.

433
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,902
Great, Joe.

434
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,103
Joe, a shot right here,
right?

435
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,538
Oh, you look nice.

436
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,173
Need to move back
a little bit, Joe.

437
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,407
Okay, okay, okay.
Move back a little bit, Joe.

438
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,675
Okay, just keep moving back.
Okay.

439
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,076
Yeah, keep moving back.
I got it.

440
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,545
Yeah, yeah.
It's called a wide shot.

441
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,746
A wide shot?
Wide shot, Joe.

442
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,414
Yeah, yeah. Movie talk, Joe.
Okay.

443
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,116
Movie talk. You're gonna
be making a movie with me.

444
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,350
I'm making a movie
with Colton West.

445
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,552
And then
you know what, Joe?

446
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,886
Another movie talk
is camera left.

447
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,121
That way. Exactly, Joe.

448
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,289
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, so...

449
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,423
Yeah. Turn that way,
and look...

450
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,758
Turn?
towards the trees, Joe.

451
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,892
Aim the camera that way?
That's it.

452
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,394
Okay.
Aim toward... You know,

453
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,929
I'm gonna say, "Action",
Joe, like a movie.

454
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,130
We're making
a great movie, Joe.

455
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,398
Okay.
This is just so awesome.

456
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,766
I mean, I'm such
a big fan of...

457
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,568
And don't move
until I say, "Action."

458
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,702
The second one
not so much,

459
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,703
but the first one was...

460
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,038
Action!
Hey!

461
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,072
Hey!

462
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,707
My bus! Ahh!

463
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,610
Colton West took my bus!

464
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,583
Thank you very much.

465
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,252
I apologize for taking
control of your bus,

466
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,754
but as you may
or may not know,

467
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,923
there was an earthquake
today in Los Angeles

468
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,492
that was caused by some
sort of volcanic activity

469
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,161
in the Santa Monica
Mountains.

470
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:34,098
Lava spiders erupted from
these mountains, spiders,

471
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,133
spiders as big as men,

472
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,637
and they rained down
on all of Los Angeles.

473
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,138
Colton,<i> banzai!</i>

474
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,177
Thanks, kid.

475
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,845
<i>Banzai</i> to you, too.

476
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,522
This way!

477
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,159
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

478
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,200
Follow me. Come on.

479
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,234
Go! Go!

480
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,471
Hurry up! Come on!

481
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,507
Eli!

482
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,509
I'm coming! I'm com...
Eli!

483
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,613
Eli, no!

484
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,181
Eli!

485
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,182
Eli, no!

486
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,984
Wyatt, let's go!

487
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,490
Aah! Aah!

488
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,524
What?!
What the hell!

489
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,893
Travis!
Travis, here!

490
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,161
Come here.
Come here.

491
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,666
Let me...

492
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,535
Jordan! Jordan!

493
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,536
Dude, don't leave me.

494
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,637
I'm right here!

495
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,205
Don't touch it.

496
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,875
Just get me
out of here, okay?

497
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,478
Did you see what
those things did to Eli?

498
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,080
What the hell
are those things?

499
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,682
I don't know, man.

500
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,317
It bit me.

501
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,318
It bit you?

502
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,419
What bit you?

503
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,854
I said I don't know, man!

504
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,390
Okay, listen.
Just stay here for a second.

505
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,492
Okay. You watch her.
Hey, can you do that?

506
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,760
Okay, I'm gonna get
the first-aid kit.

507
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,429
Okay.

508
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,466
I'm burnt so bad.

509
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,606
Doris, are you in there?

510
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,041
It's Olivia.

511
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,477
Doris, are...

512
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,250
What the...

513
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,608
Oh, my God. What...

514
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,611
Wyatt.

515
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,920
Oh, man, the Red Rocket
is driving my tour bus.

516
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,155
Somebody pinch me!

517
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,923
Thanks a lot, kid.
I appreciate it.

518
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,726
Uh, listen, I know that you
hear this all the time,

519
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,595
but I am your biggest fan.
Yeah.

520
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,596
Hi. I'm Chris.

521
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,597
Chris.
Yeah.

522
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:20,965
Not a good time to talk.

523
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,566
No, no, I know.
With the earthquakes

524
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,001
and everything
and the spiders.

525
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,103
There are spiders, buddy.
No, no, no, I know.

526
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,272
Big as your freaking body.
Big as my body.

527
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,242
The thing is, is that I've
watched all your movies.

528
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,577
I know all your lines.
Nice tattoo. Yah!

529
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,514
Look, Chris, this is not a
good time to discuss film.

530
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,015
Sure.
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

531
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,650
But seriously,
am I on, like,

532
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,352
a hidden-camera show
or something?

533
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,121
'Cause I could have swore
I saw a camera right there.

534
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,456
Yeah. Yeah. There's
cameras everywhere. Look...

535
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,490
I knew it.

536
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,925
you want to be
a good boy,

537
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,194
tell everybody
to sit down and hold on.

538
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:53,664
All right, I need everybody
to hold on and sit down.

539
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,199
Colton West,
action hero!

540
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,271
Yeah. See,
the problem is that,

541
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,474
like, 90% of these people
don't speak any English.

542
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,546
Uh, we got a problem
up ahead.

543
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,750
I hate spiders.

544
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,053
Aah! Aah!

545
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,688
What the hell is that?

546
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:27,998
Oh, homina.

547
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,068
Chris!
What?

548
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,303
Switching.

549
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,305
Really?

550
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,073
No fare, no ride.

551
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,411
Gun! Awesome!

552
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,445
Top!

553
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,184
Ah, there's one on top now.

554
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,519
You gotta do something.

555
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,620
I am doing something.

556
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,191
Do that thing like you did
in that movie.

557
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,260
Chris, you know the difference
between real life and movies?

558
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,261
No!
Darn.

559
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,063
Well, what did I do?

560
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,865
I don't know. You, like,
pulled the emergency brake,

561
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:01,866
and it did
something cool.

562
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,701
Oh, yeah.

563
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,302
Whoo!

564
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,784
Colton West, I love you!

565
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,620
Ah ha.
I love you, too.

566
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,054
Me, too.

567
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,089
Calm down, Chris.
Okay.

568
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,695
I'm not
getting anything.

569
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,731
How the hell are
we supposed to know

570
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,900
what's going on outside if we
don't have any cell service?

571
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,434
Where did you
find that?

572
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,203
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

573
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,704
You have to trust me, okay?

574
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:41,972
We need to treat this.

575
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,278
I know. I know.
I know. I know.

576
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,748
You know, when I was a little kid,
I used to come here all the time.

577
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,586
They would film
a ton n n of movies here,

578
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,490
and when my dad was shooting,
he would bring me on set.

579
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,961
All right, This is really
gonna hurt, all right?

580
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,530
Ohh! Oh, you think?

581
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,234
What the heck
are those things?

582
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,902
Ah, they look
like spiders.

583
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,671
Spiders aren't
that big.

584
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,607
Spiders don't spray
hot lava.

585
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,008
Spiders...
I don't know, man. I don't know.

586
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,176
It looked like
some kind of spider, though.

587
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,245
Oh, it burns so bad.

588
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,582
We gotta get some help.

589
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,016
Maybe if we go up higher,

590
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,818
we'd get some cell service,
something.

591
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,720
Sure as hell ain't
going back outside.

592
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:32,923
Okay.

593
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,291
You guys smell that?

594
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,363
They're trying
to get in.

595
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,868
They're trying to get
in! Let's get out of here!

596
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,003
Okay. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

597
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,004
Come on. Can you walk?

598
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,373
Do I have a choice?
No.

599
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,842
Come on.

600
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:52,876
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

601
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,119
Come on. Come on.

602
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,355
Crap.

603
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:09,159
As we continue
to bring you coverage

604
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,494
of the L.A. eruptions,

605
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,896
new details are emerging
by the minute.

606
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,665
We've got exclusive footage

607
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,701
of the damage from this
amazing volcanic activity.

608
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,370
Now, the entire area
around the 405

609
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,873
is closed from the 110
to the I-5

610
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,043
while rescue crews scramble
to evacuate survivors

611
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,511
and put out fires

612
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,813
that are spreading
across the Sepulveda basin.

613
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:34,318
Now, this one can be filed
under only in Hollyweird.

614
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:39,056
We have unconfirmed reports
of a new breed of arachnids

615
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,494
like these from the Hollywood
blockbuster "Spiders 3D"

616
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,063
that have supposedly
been attacking Angelenos.

617
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,331
That's right.

618
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,433
Large, seemingly
prehistoric spiders

619
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,735
have been emerging
from the chaos,

620
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,237
and for more of this,

621
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:56,240
we're gonna go to Sue Schnell
and her crew,

622
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,742
who finally have been moved
to a safer location.

623
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,177
Sue, what can you tell us?

624
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,412
That's right, Dan.

625
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,713
As you can see behind me here,

626
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,281
the National Guard
has been called in

627
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,517
to work
with local law enforcement

628
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:10,020
to establish a safe perimeter
around the disaster zone.

629
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,089
Although I haven't seen
anything myself,

630
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,191
social media is all over this,

631
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,193
with reports of giant
fire-breathing spiders

632
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,429
that have only added
to the mayhem

633
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,630
that has gripped the region.

634
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,231
Excuse me?

635
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,870
In other news, related or not,

636
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,140
Colton West has apparently
hijacked a tour bus.

637
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,942
Folks, we'll be back
in just a minute.

638
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,945
What?

639
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:35,979
Ohh.

640
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,088
Okay. Okay.

641
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,190
Okay.

642
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,505
Let's do this.

643
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,134
What are you waiting for?

644
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:44,047
You messed
with the wrong house.

645
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,287
I wanna get
a picture with the spider.

646
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,025
Uh, Mr. West,
what do you think

647
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,860
is in the blood
of these things?

648
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,762
I don't want
to study 'em, Chris.

649
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,364
I just want
to kill 'em.

650
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,065
Yeah. Well,
whatever it is,

651
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,734
it's eating
through the bus.

652
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,103
What do you think happens
when it hits gas?

653
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,806
Hang on, everybody.
Hang on!

654
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,744
Everybody off!
Go!

655
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,612
Everybody off!
Go! Go! Go!

656
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,880
Everybody
off now!

657
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,315
Go! Go! Go!

658
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,750
Go! Go! Go!

659
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,351
I'm last.
Go! Go! Go!

660
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,321
Go! Go! Go! Go!

661
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,656
Get off!
Let's go!

662
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,257
Come on!

663
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,100
Oh, my God!

664
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,070
Everybody's off
that bus, aren't they?

665
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,138
Yeah.

666
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,140
Clear the area!

667
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,508
You saved us.

668
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,977
No.
You're the man!

669
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,312
I didn't save anybody.

670
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,980
Yeah.

671
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,983
We still got act two
and act three to go.

672
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,818
Movie talk.

673
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,819
Yeah.

674
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,920
Yeah.

675
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,323
Movie talk.

676
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,693
But now for many Angelenos

677
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,329
who are used to the shaking
and the fires,

678
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,097
it's as if nothing
is happening,

679
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,465
and for that story,

680
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,267
we have Ed Mendez
on Hollywood Boulevard.

681
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,869
Ed, what can you tell us?

682
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,637
Thanks, Dan. And it is true

683
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,106
that business and
leisure go on as usual,

684
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,708
and most people
either haven't heard

685
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,476
about these disasters
across town,

686
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,278
or they simply
don't believe it,

687
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,113
but that is quickly changing.

688
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,783
Now, we are just blocks away
from where a tour bus exploded,

689
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,785
rocking Hollywood Boulevard,

690
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,822
shattering windows,
and setting off car alarms.

691
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,057
There is so much smoke
in the area.

692
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:37,060
This is as close as we can
possibly get to the scene,

693
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,862
but I can tell you this much.

694
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,631
Some of the passengers
were terrified,

695
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,866
and they're claiming
that creatures

696
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,336
they believe are spiders
attacked their bus,

697
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,840
a literal avalanche
of lava-breathing spiders,

698
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,508
lavalantulas.

699
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,211
Were there any casualties
in this explosion?

700
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,147
No. Apparently Colton West,

701
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:01,051
who we're hearing hijacked that
very bus just moments earlier,

702
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,721
was able to get everybody
to safety before it blew.

703
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,056
Thank you, Ed.

704
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,424
Okay. We're gonna
bring you more

705
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,859
from the Santa Monica
Mountains,

706
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,093
where the fire crews

707
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,762
are struggling
to contain the chaos.

708
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,031
Come on. Come on.

709
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,066
Okay, okay.
Okay, I need a break.

710
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,168
I need a break.
All right, all right.

711
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,237
Grab that. Grab that.
Come on. Sit down.

712
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,272
Okay.

713
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,776
Ah, jeez.
Still no signal.

714
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,611
Wonder if the cell
towers are all out?

715
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,046
The roof is gonna be our only
chance to get out of here.

716
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,547
But If all
the cell towers are out,

717
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,049
how are we gonna
get in touch with anyone?

718
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,517
I gotta flag down a
helicopter or something.

719
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,519
I don't even know.

720
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,220
Hey, Wyatt,
come here for a second.

721
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,622
What?

722
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:42,559
Dude, I think
I should stay here with her

723
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,895
while you go call for help.

724
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,463
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, that's good.

725
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,564
Cool. All right.

726
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,099
All right.
Good luck, man.

727
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,300
Come here. Come here.

728
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,635
Easy.

729
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,071
Travis, are you
trying to hit on her?

730
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,873
Dude, you did the whole
bandage hero thing back there.

731
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,141
Gotta get
my game in sometime.

732
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,210
Travis. Travis,
she's injured.

733
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,080
There are fire-breathing
spiders chasing us right now.

734
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,248
What is wrong with you?
Come on, man.

735
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,917
It's my only angle, okay?

736
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,251
It's your only angle?

737
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,487
You gotta
be kidding me.

738
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,325
Mm-hmm. Yep.
Okay, we gotta go.

739
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,027
Come on. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

740
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,002
This is a mandatory evac,
boys.

741
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,937
No one is to be left
behind. you understand?

742
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,406
If you see any of those
spiders, you don't even hesitate.

743
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,274
You shoot to kill.
Got it.

744
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,243
Rico, Lance, I want you to take
the north side of the street.

745
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,511
Hernandez, I want you
to come with me.

746
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,946
All right, let's go.

747
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,215
All right, let's go.
Move it. Move it.

748
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,197
What took you
so long?

749
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,999
We gotta get you
out of here.

750
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,000
We're evacuating
the whole neighborhood.

751
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,336
Lead the way.

752
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,306
The scale
of casualties is terrifying...

753
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,282
Any luck?

754
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,617
No. You got a phone?

755
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,118
No.

756
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,186
What's his name?

757
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,554
Wyatt.

758
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,322
Like Wyatt Earp?

759
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,791
Yeah, like Wyatt Earp.

760
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,292
So what's next?

761
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,660
Next?

762
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,063
Next is you go home.
No.

763
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,065
You go to Kansas
or Louisiana

764
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,966
or Wyoming,
and you get safe.

765
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,068
That's what next.

766
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,869
Des Moines. Yeah.
Des Moines.

767
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,237
Argh, maties.

768
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,573
Who wants their photo
with Pirate Jack?

769
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:37,808
Argh!

770
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,409
Colton West?

771
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,844
Yeah.

772
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,179
It's me,
Dave Alexander.

773
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,847
I did stunts
on "Swamp Justice"...

774
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,082
Dave!
like, 20 years ago.

775
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,249
Dave Alexander,
yeah.

776
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,417
Yeah. Yeah.
You look great.

777
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,585
Thanks.
I... I lost an arm

778
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,187
on the set
a couple years ago.

779
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,822
Stunt went bad.

780
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,390
Sorry to hear about it.
You got pigeonholed, huh?

781
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,425
Yeah. Not a lot of work
for a one-armed stunt guy.

782
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,428
Look, Dave, we got
a problem here!

783
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,696
I know.
I saw your bus.

784
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,398
Phew!
No, we...

785
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,933
Look, I got this.
Pirate Jack.

786
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,235
Dave.
Dave, sorry.

787
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,703
This city is
in great danger, okay?

788
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,572
The earthquakes
are unleashing giant spiders

789
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,373
that are attacking
the city.

790
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,110
You don't know
about this?

791
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,678
Oh, the helicopters
and the smoke and all?

792
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,546
I just figured it was
another fire in the hills.

793
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,049
No. There's a volcano in the
hills the size of Vesuvius.

794
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,517
So this spider thing's
for real?

795
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,285
Yes.
Look, Pirate Jack,

796
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,387
we just need to get
downtown to his son.

797
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,189
You got a car,
a truck, anything?

798
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,724
Yeah, I can give you a lift.
Great.

799
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,226
Let's go get a beer.
It's been too long.

800
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,427
We don't have time.

801
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,529
Dave, please,
take me downtown.

802
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,097
All right, Colt. Jeez.

803
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,567
It's happening again.

804
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,569
These earthquakes are
getting on my nerves.

805
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,104
You find somewhere safe.

806
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,572
We gotta warn people.

807
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,307
What about the ride?

808
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,809
Get off the street!
Go!

809
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,644
Everybody, get off
the street! Take cover!

810
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:48,745
Everybody,
get off the street!

811
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,113
Get off the street!

812
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,149
Look, make sure
everybody finds cover

813
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,817
and everybody gets safe.
You got me?

814
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,285
Yeah.
Okay.

815
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,486
So, I'm... I'm,
like, your costar.

816
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,754
Yeah,
You're my costar.

817
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:58,755
Yeah.
Right, right.

818
00:35:58,789 --> 00:35:59,890
Just meet me
back here.

819
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:00,891
Don't lose me!

820
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,092
Okay. Okay.

821
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,326
Get the hell
out of here!

822
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,061
Dan, I have to tell you,

823
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,763
there is a growing feeling...
This is an emergency!

824
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,465
that these reports
of spiders

825
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,567
are actually
part of publicity stunt

826
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,236
for an upcoming
Hollywood blockbuster.

827
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,272
Oh, God.

828
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,673
Oh, my God.

829
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,034
Run!

830
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,102
Everybody get off
the streets!

831
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,804
Girls, get off the streets!
There are giant spiders!

832
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,806
Everybody, get off the
street! Get off the street!

833
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,441
Hey...
Hey. Hey!

834
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,809
Colton West! Nice shotgun.
Yeah!

835
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,945
I know you.
I know you from...

836
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,213
Look, you gotta
get off the streets.

837
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,014
There's giant spiders
everywhere.

838
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,717
I'd love to help you, but I
got shark problems right now.

839
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,495
Yeah! Yeah.

840
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:47,931
You're welcome, kid.

841
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:48,965
Yeah!

842
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,840
Die! Die! Die!

843
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,479
Gotta get outta here.

844
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,913
Yeah.
This way!

845
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:10,353
Get in!

846
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,189
Jack.

847
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,795
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

848
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,105
Keep moving, people.

849
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,675
On the truck.
On the truck.

850
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,276
Go ahead, too.

851
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,944
All the way to the front.
All the way to the front.

852
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,582
Let's go.
Come on.

853
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,117
Get everybody in.

854
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,422
Take your time. Let's go.

855
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,923
Where are we going?

856
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,591
We're going
out of the city.

857
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,293
How bad is this?

858
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,462
It's bad. The city's
completely unstable.

859
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,831
Los Angeles is under
a military evac.

860
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,534
No, no, no. Wait. Wait. I... I can't
just leave. My family is still out there.

861
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,469
All right. You don't
have a choice, all right?

862
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,671
This is martial law.
Excuse me?

863
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,106
Listen,
I'm sorry, ma'am.

864
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,474
This is completely
unprecedented.

865
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,809
We weren't prepared
for this.

866
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,810
I'm not leaving
without my family.

867
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,211
I need to find them.

868
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,280
We'll find your family,
I promise you,

869
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,514
if they're still alive.

870
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,788
Move it up, sir!

871
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,990
Move it out! Let's go!

872
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,867
Hey, what happened
to your parrot?

873
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,336
How could you possibly care
about something like that now?

874
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,138
Giant spiders
are trying to kill us.

875
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,040
I didn't think you guys
were serious about these.

876
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,308
Well, of course
we're serious.

877
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,710
Oh, they took out
the Blue Oyster.

878
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:41,978
I love that place.

879
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,847
Jack, just get us
downtown.

880
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,749
How is this even possible?
How is this happening?

881
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,417
Well, you know,
just last week,

882
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,186
they found a new species
of wasp in the Chinese jungle,

883
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,255
eight-inch wingspan,
four-inch stinger.

884
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,890
Well, these things are a
lot bigger than eight inches!

885
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,259
I'm just saying.
New species, my ass.

886
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,429
This is that Japanese radiation
leak making its way over.

887
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,064
Guys, let's stop
discussing biology!

888
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,767
Get me downtown
so I can get my son!

889
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,338
Come on.

890
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:11,541
We gotta go faster.
Come on.

891
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,877
I can't. I can't
go any further.

892
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,078
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I need to sit down.

893
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,246
Okay. Whoa.
Sit down.

894
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,380
It hurts so bad.

895
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,948
What, is it too tight?
Uh-huh.

896
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,683
Okay. Let me see.
Let me see.

897
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,485
Okay, come on.

898
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,590
Oh, God. Ohh!
Oh, my God.

899
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,225
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Hey, shut up.

900
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,293
Shut up. It's fine.
It's not that bad.

901
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,628
Are you freaking
kidding me?

902
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,929
She's too young
to die, bro.

903
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,697
Shut up.
Calm down. Calm down.

904
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,033
We can't panic
right now, okay? Calm down.

905
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,569
You can't freak out
on me right now, okay?

906
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,570
Come on.

907
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,771
I gotta get to the roof.

908
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:42,806
Man,
you can't leave us.

909
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,040
Just stay
with her, man.

910
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,608
We gotta try.

911
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,645
Whoa!
Come on! We gotta go!

912
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,046
Back! Back! Back!
Come on.

913
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,047
Come on!

914
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,383
Go!

915
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,618
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

916
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,825
What the hell is that?

917
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,427
What the hell?!
Lava! Lava!

918
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,606
Why are we stopping?

919
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,274
Something's wrong.

920
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,383
This is gonna get bad
really, really fast.

921
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,919
Let's get out of here.

922
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,588
We're not going anywhere.

923
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,523
Ah, man,
these were brand-new.

924
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,526
Uh, fellas, look!

925
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,795
That's not good.

926
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,129
Holy...
Oh, that's bad.

927
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,464
I had a feeling
this was gonna happen.

928
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,599
Oh, hey, Colton,
any ideas?

929
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,867
What do we do?
What do we do?

930
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,869
Man, I hate being right.

931
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,204
Get in the museum!
Why the museum?

932
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,707
Because that's the only
building without spiders on it!

933
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,676
Not yet, but they look
pretty determined.

934
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,780
Barricade the doors!

935
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,550
Close them up!
Close them up!

936
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,218
Come on!
Throw everything you can!

937
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,625
Come on! Hurry up!

938
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,193
Anything!
Just grab anything!

939
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,227
Jam it up.

940
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,296
I got one more.

941
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,265
I got one more.

942
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,235
You feel safe?

943
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,236
Not even
a little bit.

944
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,371
No.
You got a plan?

945
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,372
Uh, run.

946
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,406
Run! Run!
Run!

947
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,480
Gotta get
out of here.

948
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,315
We're not getting out of
here. There's spiders outside.

949
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,550
We gotta find
somewhere to hide.

950
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,084
There's nowhere to hide.

951
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,021
When those things want
to find you, they will.

952
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,088
Who are you?

953
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,391
I am Dr. Erik
Von Struebel.

954
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,725
I work here
in the museum.

955
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,027
What are you
still doing here?

956
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,663
I'm a scientist.
For good or bad,

957
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,499
these are the kind of
moments that we live for.

958
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,667
Well, you're not gonna
live for much longer

959
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,101
if you stick around
here, Doc.

960
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,538
Yes. I am acutely aware
of that possibility,

961
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,206
but I'm not done.

962
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,408
Done?

963
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,442
Done with what?

964
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:08,785
The heat grid is like
an interconnected network,

965
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,453
lava tubes probably,

966
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,523
with the temperature
increasing exponentially.

967
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,725
So why didn't anybody say
anything about this before?

968
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,027
We didn't see it coming.

969
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,229
It happened too quickly.

970
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,965
I mean, we're talking
five days ago,

971
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,467
and it's like,
"Oh, that's odd."

972
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:28,805
Then under a week later,
the hills are active volcanoes.

973
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,541
What should have taken
over a million years

974
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,143
almost happened
overnight.

975
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,612
So if this is correct,

976
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,313
this explains
why these things

977
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,748
are exploding
all over the city.

978
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,751
This city
is a ticking time bomb.

979
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,153
Wait. What does this have to do
with spiders attacking the city?

980
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,123
Actually, everything.

981
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:52,128
When I compared the pattern
of the lava tube network,

982
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:56,566
it had a very close structure
to that of an insect colony.

983
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,234
So wait. They had
something in common?

984
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,570
They're exactly
the same.

985
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,973
The volcanoes
and the spiders are one.

986
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,810
The Mayans
had a term for it,

987
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,179
lavalantula.

988
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,649
And right here...

989
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,419
this would be
the queen's chamber.

990
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:21,658
If you kill the Mamalantula,
you kill them all.

991
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,461
Whoa.

992
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,265
We better go check
on that front door.

993
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,333
What are you doing?

994
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,268
Science class
is over, Doc.

995
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:35,938
I'm gonna go get my kid,
and when we're done,

996
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,675
you and I, Jack, we're
gonna have that beer.

997
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:39,709
You're buying.

998
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,147
Oh, that is so badass.

999
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,016
Wait. No, no, no.

1000
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,318
I... I meant you're badass,
not I'm badass.

1001
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,887
Guys?

1002
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:51,921
Colt?

1003
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,464
Come in, Evac 670.
What's your 20?

1004
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:02,732
This is Evac 670.

1005
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,734
We are westbound
on Forest Lawn.

1006
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,736
670, turn around
immediately.

1007
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,205
The Forest Lawn area is
highly unstable right now.

1008
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,707
Do you have
an alternate route?

1009
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,408
Negative, just get
off that road.

1010
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,044
What's happening?

1011
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,213
Want you to stay here.

1012
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,248
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You
can't just leave us here.

1013
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:20,683
All right.
I want you to get down,

1014
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,219
and I want you
to stay down.

1015
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,154
This should keep you safe.
- On your six!

1016
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,056
I'm not good at staying down.

1017
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,992
If you want to live, you get
that ass under that fire blanket.

1018
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,995
Really need to curse.

1019
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,098
Get down!

1020
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,836
This place is like
a freaking maze.

1021
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,237
I think there's
a stairwell right there.

1022
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:44,040
Oh, you think?

1023
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,954
These things
don't give up.

1024
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,456
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Keep your voice down.

1025
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,724
Come on. Come on.

1026
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,138
Okay, come on.
Come on.

1027
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,806
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

1028
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,241
God.

1029
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,042
I think it's gone.

1030
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,746
Run! Go! Go!

1031
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,414
You got her?

1032
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,849
You got her?
Come on! Here it comes!

1033
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,253
What the hell
are you doing?

1034
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,254
I got this!

1035
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,795
I got it!

1036
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,266
How'd you know
that was gonna work?

1037
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,300
I didn't!

1038
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,173
Go!

1039
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,611
There's too many
of them, man!

1040
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,147
We gotta get these
civilians out of here.

1041
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,682
They breathe fire, man.

1042
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:00,716
Yeah,
I can see that.

1043
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,822
Now they're
closing in.

1044
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,957
We are not going
down like this.

1045
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,258
Do you have a shot?
Yeah.

1046
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,828
Run!

1047
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,833
We gotta move now, man.

1048
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,000
Yeah, and do what?

1049
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,635
We gonna head back
to the city?

1050
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,037
Well, we can't go
this way, man.

1051
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:22,205
Yeah, but we need
reinforcements.

1052
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,540
Man, we are
the reinforcements!

1053
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,216
Clever girl.

1054
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,425
Oh, no.

1055
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,146
Oh! Eww, eww, eww.

1056
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,449
Oh, my God.

1057
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,455
Key.

1058
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,224
Oh.

1059
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,461
Evac 670,
can you read me?

1060
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,896
Hello?

1061
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,398
Did you copy
the last transmission?

1062
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,300
Get off Forest Lawn.

1063
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,601
All your men are gone.

1064
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,703
Everyone is dead.
Do you hear me?

1065
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,305
Who is this?

1066
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,373
My name is Olivia West.

1067
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,809
I'm the sole survivor.
Well, please be advised

1068
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,878
to get out of
Los Angeles immediately.

1069
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:10,212
Yeah. Well, thanks
for the great advice,

1070
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,380
but I can't
really do that.

1071
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:12,982
My family is
still here in L.A.

1072
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:15,651
Repeat. Los Angeles is
highly unstable right now.

1073
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,887
Why don't you give me
some good information,

1074
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,488
like where's
the fricking key?

1075
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,957
There is no key, ma'am.

1076
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,492
Flip two switches marked
"battery" and "run."

1077
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:27,129
You're advised to get
out as soon as possible.

1078
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:28,698
Not without my family.

1079
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,742
Come on.

1080
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:40,743
You still with us?

1081
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:41,844
How you doing?

1082
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:43,012
How you doing, Jordan?
Jordan!

1083
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,146
Jordan!

1084
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,248
Jordan!

1085
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:47,416
Jordan.
Whoa, whoa.

1086
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:48,451
She's freaking out, man.

1087
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,353
Jordan, come on.
Come on.

1088
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:51,821
Jordan, look at me.
Look at me.

1089
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,089
Water, water.
Get some water.

1090
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,523
From where?
I don't know, man.

1091
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:56,525
Jordan, look at me.
No, come on.

1092
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,127
Jordan! Jordan!

1093
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,329
Jordan! Jordan!
Come on.

1094
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:01,964
Stay with us.
Come on.

1095
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,201
Jordan.

1096
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:06,202
What the...

1097
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,903
Is she dead?

1098
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,639
I don't know.

1099
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,550
Jordan! Jordan!

1100
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,387
Ho. Dude.

1101
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,758
Jordan.

1102
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,497
What's happening?!
No! No!

1103
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,664
What's happening?!
Oh, my God!

1104
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,733
Make it stop!

1105
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:38,901
Oh, my God!

1106
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,870
What the...

1107
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,671
No! No!

1108
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:45,408
Get 'em off me, man!

1109
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,475
No! Ahh!

1110
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,213
No! No! Ahh!

1111
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,522
Come on. Come on.

1112
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,395
Right.

1113
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,438
Where are you?

1114
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,544
My phone.

1115
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,379
My phone's working.

1116
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,014
It's from Wyatt.

1117
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,549
Heh.

1118
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,683
He's trapped.

1119
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,852
He's at Hanson Studios.

1120
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:31,754
It's at Seventh and Olympic.
We gotta get there.

1121
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,322
Hey, guys.

1122
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,727
That is
a very large arachnid.

1123
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,338
The freaking kraken.

1124
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,074
And it's coming
this way.

1125
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,075
Get back!

1126
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,276
Lavalantula!

1127
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,452
Ah, no!

1128
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:05,087
Ah! Ah, look!
Oh!

1129
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,155
They're in here!

1130
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:07,656
They're all in here!

1131
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,626
Ah! Oh, no!

1132
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,294
Let's go this way.

1133
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:17,700
Oh, no!

1134
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,137
C-Come on.

1135
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,005
Yes.

1136
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,340
Too many of 'em!

1137
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:25,474
We gotta get
out of here!

1138
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,314
Jack, watch it!

1139
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:33,349
Watch out!

1140
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:35,184
Watch out! No!

1141
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,187
Jack!

1142
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:43,993
Want some of this?

1143
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,028
You got this.
Come on!

1144
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,514
Let's get
out of here.

1145
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,449
Get out of here!

1146
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,618
Though that door.

1147
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:28,170
Could there be a prehistoric
link to these spiders?

1148
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,972
That's what's trending
on social media

1149
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,440
after scientific reports

1150
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,943
date these arachnids
back to the Jurassic era.

1151
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,178
Meanwhile, mid-Wilshire
is the latest hot spot,

1152
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,846
where the famed
La Brea Tar Pits

1153
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,683
have been decimated
by dozens of lavalantulas.

1154
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,352
And at the center of it all,
action hero Colton West.

1155
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,187
Colton?
Eyewitnesses say he saved

1156
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,489
dozens of people
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1157
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,293
Doc, you okay?

1158
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,494
You okay?
You hurt?

1159
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:53,662
What?
Are you hurt?

1160
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:54,897
Are you
bleeding anywhere?

1161
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,131
I can't hear you!

1162
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,333
I think I lost my hearing.

1163
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,334
No, you didn't.
Huh?

1164
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,369
It's a helicopter!

1165
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,674
Looks like
you're wrapped, kid.

1166
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,676
You're going
back to Des Moines.

1167
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,044
You're not coming with us?

1168
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,512
No. I gotta find my kid.

1169
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,047
I hope you find him.
Yeah.

1170
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,983
I better, or my wife
will kill me.

1171
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,351
You saved my life.

1172
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:18,420
No. No, no.
We saved each other.

1173
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,059
Kid.
Huh?

1174
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,060
You can let go.
No, no, no.

1175
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,061
Let go of me.

1176
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,563
No. No, no, no.

1177
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,764
Okay.
Okay.

1178
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:29,865
Go.
Sorry.

1179
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,000
Movie talk.
Movie talk.

1180
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,835
Movie talk.

1181
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,737
You're crazy for staying.

1182
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,405
Yeah, of course
I'm crazy. I'm an actor.

1183
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,840
Good point.

1184
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,276
I printed out a thermal map
of Los Angeles.

1185
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,544
The orange bits
are the lava tubes.

1186
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,513
Stay away from them
if you can.

1187
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:45,514
Thanks, Doc.

1188
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,582
Be safe.

1189
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,050
Be safe.

1190
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,266
Okay. Okay.

1191
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,104
Come on. Come on. Okay.

1192
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:17,813
Okay. Okay.

1193
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,150
You want some of this?

1194
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:23,752
Yeah, come on! Come on!

1195
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,721
It's Christmas.
I got something for you,

1196
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,223
a little present
for you. Come on, guys.

1197
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,591
Come on.

1198
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:31,126
Colton!

1199
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,161
Get in!

1200
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,329
Ah, honey.

1201
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,933
Come on.
Drive straight.

1202
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,134
Drive straight.

1203
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:43,605
Okay.

1204
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,645
Ahh!

1205
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,484
What were you doing
at the Tar Pits?

1206
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,186
Trying to find our son.

1207
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,687
I got stuck.

1208
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,189
Stuck?

1209
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,957
Who gets stuck
at the Tar Pits?

1210
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,459
I mean, Wilshire
Boulevard, really?

1211
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:04,927
Everyone knows you
take Olympic downtown.

1212
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,695
Thanks, honey.

1213
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,297
You okay?

1214
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,032
Yeah. I'm okay,

1215
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:12,501
'cause I'm seeing you.

1216
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,169
How'd you find me?

1217
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,772
After 15 years of
putting out your fires,

1218
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,374
I'm gonna just
follow the smoke.

1219
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,542
Really?
No.

1220
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,111
You're all over
the news.

1221
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:25,013
Ah. So I got
a text from Wyatt.

1222
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,215
He's okay.
You did?

1223
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,483
Yeah.

1224
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,485
He's at Hanson Street
Studios.

1225
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,553
Hanson Street.
Yeah.

1226
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,055
Pretty ironic, huh?
Yeah.

1227
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,356
That's where
we first met.

1228
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,458
Heh.

1229
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:37,893
You remember?

1230
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,963
Oh, honey, yeah,
of course I remember.

1231
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,197
Really?
Yes.

1232
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,300
That's so romantic.

1233
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,136
I love you, honey.

1234
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,071
I love you, too.

1235
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,206
Let's get downtown.
We'll get Wyatt,

1236
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,575
get the hell out
of this city before it goes.

1237
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:56,812
Mayday! Mayday!

1238
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,181
This is Evac 670,
Colton West.

1239
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,517
We need help.
This is an emergency.

1240
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,218
Mayday! Mayday!
Please come in.

1241
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,221
Listen. Listen. They're
saying something.

1242
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,056
The authorities are overwhelmed

1243
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,058
trying to battle these spiders
and evacuate citizens.

1244
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,494
We keep getting new reports
of lavalantulas

1245
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,897
erupting from beneath
the ground, spewing fire,

1246
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,733
and wreaking havoc
all over the Los Angeles basin.

1247
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,768
Nowhere seems to be safe.

1248
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,370
Evacuation efforts
have been halted,

1249
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,839
and everyone is advised
to stay in place...

1250
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:24,907
I've heard enough.

1251
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,060
Come on.

1252
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:50,299
Here... Here I come, son!

1253
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,436
Stay away from my kid!

1254
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,806
Olivia! Get down, honey!

1255
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:59,274
Mom! Dad!

1256
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,542
Wyatt, get down!

1257
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,411
Get down!
Wyatt! Get down!

1258
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:04,179
Get down!

1259
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:06,982
Oh, my God.

1260
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,684
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

1261
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:10,986
Honey. Honey.

1262
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,321
Dad!
Ho ho. My boy.

1263
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:13,455
Mom!

1264
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,624
Oh, thank God.

1265
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,896
Why do you have
a military truck?

1266
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,464
You know your mom.

1267
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,799
She likes
everything big.

1268
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:24,933
Yes, I do.

1269
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,835
You okay?
Are you all right?

1270
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,470
Did you check yourself?
Are you bleeding anywhere?

1271
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,471
No, I'm good.
I'm good.

1272
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,772
What about
the others?

1273
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:31,773
Are they okay?

1274
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,275
They didn't make it.

1275
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,343
What?

1276
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:37,479
I know. I know.

1277
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,848
How on Earth
did you stay alive?

1278
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,752
This.

1279
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,521
It's 'cause I sprayed them
with this, and they hate it.

1280
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:46,522
Just a fire
extinguisher?

1281
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,257
No, honey. This is...

1282
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,791
compressed nitrogen.

1283
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,426
Y-You have more of these?

1284
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:52,661
That's the last one.

1285
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,464
Nitrogen.

1286
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,532
What?

1287
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:57,533
There's shops around here.

1288
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,301
Shop?
You want to shop?

1289
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,470
No, honey, this nitrogen,

1290
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:05,207
this is what almost killed me
this morning on the set.

1291
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,808
This is
gonna keep us alive.

1292
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,977
We gotta get out of
here. We really gotta go.

1293
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,513
Yeah, and even if we do, these
spiders aren't just gonna let us leave.

1294
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,883
Dad, we're gonna
have to fight.

1295
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,854
And that's what
we're gonna do, son.

1296
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,595
Come on!

1297
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,670
Ladies and Gentlemen,

1298
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:37,673
just moments ago, the President
of the United States

1299
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:40,776
declared the L.A. basin
a disaster zone.

1300
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:44,179
I can tell you the situation
has gone from bad to worse.

1301
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:47,783
The Santa Monica Mountains
continue to destabilize.

1302
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,885
We're showing you
live footage from Malibu,

1303
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,720
where the latest eruption
has occurred.

1304
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,890
Several freeways
have been severely damaged,

1305
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,560
leading authorities to advise
everyone to stay in place.

1306
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:02,531
This map shows the damage
spread across the L.A. basin,

1307
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,766
but in the midst
of all this chaos,

1308
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,568
there are selfless acts
of heroism

1309
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,570
as reported
by our own Lisa Miller.

1310
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,639
Uh, yeah. I just wanna say

1311
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,108
that I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for Colton West.

1312
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,810
He's a real-life
action hero.

1313
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,578
Well, I'm sure
he had some help.

1314
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,380
Did you know he
used to be an actor?

1315
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,048
Colton West,
he save my life.

1316
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,750
You super action.

1317
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,251
Well, there you have it.

1318
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,153
In the stranger
than fiction category,

1319
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,155
and in the midst of
the biggest catastrophe

1320
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,824
this city
has ever seen,

1321
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:31,126
a motion-picture
action hero

1322
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,596
might very well be a
real, live action hero.

1323
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,597
Back to you.

1324
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,598
Thank you, Lisa.

1325
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,666
Has he lost his mind?

1326
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:40,602
Who the hell's
calling here?

1327
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,271
If it's a spider,
don't answer it.

1328
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,440
Who is it?

1329
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,609
It's Colton West.

1330
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,810
What?
What?!

1331
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,981
Wyatt, Olivia, get
in here. Come in here.

1332
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:55,917
Oh, Colton.
Colton West, man,

1333
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,086
you are all
over the news.

1334
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,155
Teddy, what are you
still doing here?

1335
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:02,524
We left the set
same time you did.

1336
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:03,959
Then all hell
broke loose.

1337
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,594
Freeways
are shut down,

1338
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,462
and those spiders are
killing anything that moves.

1339
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,965
I know. There's no getting
in and out of L.A. now.

1340
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,867
Well, our boys over
at the studio wings

1341
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:14,036
said that they have
some helicopters.

1342
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,637
They were supposed
to be on their way,

1343
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,439
but they didn't show up,

1344
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,708
and we haven't been able
to get ahold of them since.

1345
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:21,610
Bigger question is,
what are you doing here?

1346
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:24,112
I got a plan.
Heh heh.

1347
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,615
You've always got
a plan, Colton West.

1348
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,550
Is this the original
Red Rocket?

1349
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:29,985
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

1350
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,387
NASA made
that suit.

1351
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:37,125
Ah, the days of the
big budgets. Mm, mm, mm.

1352
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,662
Son, this suit, this helmet,
it paid for our house,

1353
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,031
paid for the clothes
you're wearing, your education.

1354
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:47,135
Paid for everything.

1355
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,970
So why do you
still keep 'em?

1356
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:52,140
Well... Because I'm
a sucker for nostalgia.

1357
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,175
Yeah.

1358
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,377
How you doing,
young man?

1359
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:57,879
I always thought one day
we'd make a sequel.

1360
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:00,816
Well, if things ever get
normal, maybe he'll fly again.

1361
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,517
I wish we could all
fly away from here.

1362
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,721
We're gonna make a break
for it, Colt. You with us?

1363
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,089
No. You're not
going out there.

1364
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,690
I wouldn't count
on the military.

1365
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,425
They're sending in
a ground evac,

1366
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,327
but who knows when
that's gonna happen?

1367
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,929
So we're all
just sitting ducks?

1368
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,398
No, Ted,
I'm not a sitting duck,

1369
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:18,433
and neither are you.
We're not giving up.

1370
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:21,503
I love your attitude,
baby, but the fact is...

1371
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,238
Marty, I've been
in this town for 30 years.

1372
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,407
It has not killed me.
It's not gonna kill me now.

1373
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:28,577
Now, Wyatt said
this kept him alive.

1374
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:31,346
Nitrogen. You used it on
the set today, weren't you?

1375
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,015
You used this on them?

1376
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,717
Yeah.
It worked?

1377
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,052
Son of a gun.

1378
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,453
Do you have
any more?

1379
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,789
How much
are we talking?

1380
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,457
And what do you have
in mind, Colt?

1381
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,327
I need a map of downtown.

1382
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,599
All right.
This is their nest.

1383
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,100
This is how
they get around.

1384
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,202
This is where
they come out.

1385
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,138
It's all over L.A.

1386
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:59,107
Right here,
this large chamber,

1387
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:02,277
that's where
the queen is.

1388
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,580
Okay.

1389
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,649
If this map is accurate...
and it is...

1390
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,217
that's no more than
just a few blocks away.

1391
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,452
That's right.

1392
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,921
Those canisters
of liquid nitrogen,

1393
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:17,759
we need to wrap bombs
around them. Can you do that?

1394
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,462
I still have a few dozen
sticks of C-4 around.

1395
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,430
I don't see that
as a problem.

1396
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,967
And we could detonate
them by remote.

1397
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,569
Can you do that?

1398
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,638
Not a problem.

1399
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,573
If we make enough
of these canisters

1400
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:35,310
and drop them down
in the open craters,

1401
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,312
then we can
detonate them,

1402
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:41,483
and we can smoke this
queen right out of the nest.

1403
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,018
Can you do that?

1404
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:45,353
Not a problem.
Not a problem.

1405
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,356
I... I don't know much
about this sort of thing,

1406
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,125
but this queen,

1407
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,127
she's gonna be a lot bigger
than the others, right?

1408
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,795
Yeah,
she's gonna be huge.

1409
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,964
And really pissed.

1410
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,200
So, what,
we kill the queen?

1411
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,168
Where does that
even get us?

1412
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,870
Oh, no, no.
What... What he's saying,

1413
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:03,538
it's... it's
a hive mentality.

1414
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,974
You see, um,
if you kill the queen,

1415
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,709
you kill them all.

1416
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:09,878
It's... It's like
on the Insect Channel.

1417
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,313
That's right.

1418
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,282
I hate bugs.

1419
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,551
Let's kill the bitch.

1420
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,798
Ladies and gentlemen,

1421
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,400
tonight I call upon you,

1422
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:35,170
the good people
of the motion picture industry.

1423
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,573
It is you who works tirelessly

1424
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:42,978
12, 14, 16 hours a day...

1425
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:46,514
giving pints and pints of
your blood for our great nation.

1426
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:50,185
Yes, some might say
it's just entertainment,

1427
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,920
but we know better.

1428
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,855
Our movies are where
the hopes and dreams

1429
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,191
of this great nation are born.

1430
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,594
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm chagrined to say

1431
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,097
that tonight might be
our last production,

1432
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,599
but I beseech you,
please think another way.

1433
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,736
Tonight is our opening night.

1434
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,338
Tonight is the night
that we save our city,

1435
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:13,742
our homes, our families,

1436
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,044
that we believe in a tomorrow,

1437
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,613
a tomorrow where the Lakers
have another threepeat.

1438
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:19,881
What about
the Clippers?

1439
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,683
Clippers, too.

1440
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:26,254
A tomorrow where the Kings
sip again from the Stanley Cup.

1441
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,856
What about
the Ducks?

1442
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,624
The Ducks, too.

1443
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,026
And a tomorrow
where the Dodgers,

1444
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:34,930
only the Dodgers,
win the World Series.

1445
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,932
Ladies and gentlemen,

1446
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:40,402
tonight I ask you
to unify as a city,

1447
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,737
above the line, below the line.

1448
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,073
Tonight we draw the line.

1449
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,541
This is your city.

1450
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:47,575
This is my city.

1451
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,110
I was born in this city.

1452
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,813
I'm gonna die in this city,
but not tonight!

1453
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:54,316
Viva Los Angelenos!

1454
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,119
Viva Los Angelenos!

1455
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,389
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, baby!

1456
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,491
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about, man!

1457
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,495
Whoo! Whoo!

1458
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,200
Al i run it off.
Okay.

1459
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:13,435
All right.
I got this.

1460
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,970
Colt. Colt.
Yeah, Marty.

1461
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:16,171
Yeah.
Listen.

1462
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:17,539
I've been thinking
about this.

1463
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,174
Mm-hmm. Yeah?
The queen.

1464
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,443
You've gotta get
really close to take her out,

1465
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:24,112
and bullets
aren't gonna do it.

1466
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,714
You need an explosion,

1467
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,882
and you know what happens
if she explodes?

1468
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,818
It's a death wish
for anyone nearby.

1469
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:31,786
Okay. So let's
use a remote.

1470
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,855
It's moving,
and it's very hot.

1471
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,490
Who's gonna
slap it on, anyway?

1472
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,058
And besides, remember,
this is C-4.

1473
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,994
That stuff's
gonna go off by itself,

1474
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:40,862
like it or not.
So how long?

1475
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:44,399
10, 20 seconds tops.

1476
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:46,201
Look, man, that was
a really good speech,

1477
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,670
but, um... oh, oh,
okay, great speech,

1478
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,039
but we're gonna need
more than speeches.

1479
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:54,175
Just make sure
those bombs go off.

1480
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,177
Oh, we will.

1481
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:04,586
You both just stay here,
and you'll be safe, okay?

1482
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,688
Okay.
And, Wyatt,

1483
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,656
I'm counting
on you, okay?

1484
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,325
Okay.
You be a good boy.

1485
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,326
I will.

1486
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,061
You watch your mother.

1487
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:14,562
All right.

1488
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,531
Promise me
you'll come back.

1489
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:17,866
I promise.

1490
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,502
Okay.

1491
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,804
Don't worry.

1492
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,842
And how 'bout you?

1493
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,078
You want to go to a Dodger
game when I come back?

1494
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,346
Yeah.

1495
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,048
Hate to interrupt
a family moment,

1496
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:34,949
but it's go time.

1497
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,918
Okay.
Okay.

1498
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:37,952
All right.

1499
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:41,756
I love you.

1500
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,726
It's gonna be okay.

1501
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,274
This is alpha. We are
nearing the first drop.

1502
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,048
The first bomb is away.

1503
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,722
Roger that.
This is Bravo team.

1504
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,458
We're nearing
the second crater.

1505
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,800
Two is away.
Repeat, two is away.

1506
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,435
We'll show them,
stupid spider,

1507
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,971
good kung fu
fighting technique.

1508
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,607
It is eerily quiet
on the streets of Los Angeles

1509
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,243
as the greater
metro area smolders

1510
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,645
under the crippling
volcanic eruptions

1511
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,014
and the onslaught
of lavalantulas

1512
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:42,016
that have been thrust up
from their nest,

1513
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,952
decimating everything
in their path.

1514
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,121
Now the residents
that were evacuated earlier

1515
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,456
are long gone,
hopefully to safety.

1516
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:52,427
Those who remain are
hunkered down under martial law.

1517
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,596
Let me tell you,
even though this small area

1518
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,197
might seem safe for now,

1519
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:59,467
no one inside the city
and the ring of fire are safe.

1520
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:02,137
Rescue efforts are
still being hindered,

1521
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:03,872
so all of these brave residents,

1522
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:06,975
all they can do is
sit and wait and pray.

1523
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,980
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

1524
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,659
Hey, man, I'm gonna
need some backup.

1525
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,528
There's lots
of spiders here.

1526
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,963
Don't worry, Teddy.
Cavalry's on its way.

1527
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,807
All right, now.

1528
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,509
I'm here. Come on!

1529
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:43,745
Come on! Come on!

1530
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:46,881
I got something
for you and your mama!

1531
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,684
Take that! Come on!

1532
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:55,557
Ah! Ah!

1533
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:58,826
I need some help here.

1534
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,929
I need some help!

1535
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,564
Full power.

1536
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,070
Oh.

1537
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:10,305
Oh.

1538
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:13,908
Hoo.

1539
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,047
Move it! Move it!
Oh, guys...

1540
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,749
Come on,
come on, come on!

1541
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:22,784
Teddy.
Come on!

1542
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:25,987
Come on.

1543
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,657
Come on,
you suckers.

1544
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,628
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1545
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,072
What?
They're gone.

1546
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:45,940
Well, it worked,
didn't it?

1547
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,575
Yeah.

1548
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,277
Okay.
What's the plan, Colt?

1549
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:50,878
Uh, you know
how we always say

1550
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,248
that making a film
is like war?

1551
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:54,949
Yeah.
Yeah.

1552
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,585
Well, let's hope that this war
is like making a film.

1553
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,920
What does that mean?

1554
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:00,054
Means I need you
to plant those bombs.

1555
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,556
Okay, but what
does that mean?

1556
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,157
Means I need you
to plant those bombs.

1557
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,293
Where are you going? What
are you doing? Colton!

1558
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:08,496
Colt! Come back here, Colt.44!
Come back here!

1559
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:11,099
Uh, your attention please.
Colton has gone rogue.

1560
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:13,801
Everybody keep going.
The plan remains the same.

1561
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:15,937
Repeat, it remains
the same, all right? Out.

1562
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:17,505
What is he doing?

1563
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:19,841
He's just being your
father. I don't...

1564
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:22,610
Keep moving, laddies.
We've got to win this one.

1565
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,345
Freedom!

1566
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:20,935
Damn it!

1567
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:47,028
Marty. Marty.
Come in, Marty.

1568
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:48,830
There you are, man.

1569
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,232
Hey, where are you?
Exactly where are you?

1570
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:54,268
You'll know in a little bit.

1571
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:55,536
What's our status?

1572
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,238
You got
those bombs planted?

1573
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:58,272
Red 3 standing by.

1574
01:12:58,307 --> 01:12:59,841
Red 2 standing by.

1575
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,409
Red 5 standing by.

1576
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,077
R2, shut up.
I'm busy, man.

1577
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,512
Standing by, man.
Great.

1578
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,447
I'm counting on you,
Marty.

1579
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,916
I'm counting on you.

1580
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,385
We gonna be
all right, Colt.

1581
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:12,286
You just make sure
you don't get dead.

1582
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,704
Colt, I really hope
you're there,

1583
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,806
'cause if you've got a plan,
now's the time.

1584
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,708
Yeah, I got a plan.

1585
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:34,809
It's go time.

1586
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,078
Go time?
Go where time?

1587
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,479
What... Where are you?

1588
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:41,115
I found a little party
I want to drop in on.

1589
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,761
Make some music, Teddy.

1590
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:57,565
On my mark,
3, 2, 1.

1591
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,033
We're rolling.

1592
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:14,982
Oh.

1593
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:18,586
One didn't go off.

1594
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,787
Push it again.

1595
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:20,788
I'm pushing it.

1596
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:23,624
Oh, my gosh.

1597
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:26,694
Oh, my...

1598
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:29,530
Load up.
Load up.

1599
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:32,700
Yah!
- What the...

1600
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:33,801
Yah!

1601
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,369
Incoming!

1602
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,472
Incoming!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

1603
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:38,606
Go!
Take 'em out!

1604
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:42,009
Over there.
Tighten the flank!

1605
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,945
Tighten the flank!
Don't let 'em through!

1606
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,480
Hold 'em!

1607
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:46,848
Back up. Back up!
Hold the line.

1608
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,617
Come on.
Hold the line!

1609
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,486
Watch your flank!
Watch your flank, guys!

1610
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,387
Tighten it up!
Tighten it up!

1611
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:55,256
That's it! Spray 'em!

1612
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:06,467
Ah...

1613
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:09,370
What we gonna do?
How am I gonna spray that, man?

1614
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:10,638
She's bigger than
the damn buildings.

1615
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,773
Mama's home.

1616
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:19,847
If anybody's got a Plan B,
uh, how 'bout now?

1617
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,689
She's not just bad.
She's big.

1618
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:29,924
Really big.

1619
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,496
C-4 now.

1620
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,032
Oh, you're kidding me.
What?

1621
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,600
Where the hell is it?

1622
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:42,069
I know where it is.

1623
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,048
All right, Colt.

1624
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,449
Action.

1625
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:57,018
Unbelievable.

1626
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,353
Let's hope this works.

1627
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:03,257
Whoa!

1628
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:07,194
Go! Go!
Let's go!

1629
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,030
Go! Go!
Get out of here!

1630
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,498
Run! Run!
Everybody, run!

1631
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,105
No. No, no, no!
No, no, no!

1632
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,874
Whoa! Ow!

1633
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,475
Ow! Ow!

1634
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:26,414
Steady. Come on, steady.

1635
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:27,648
Whoa. Ow! Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1636
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,684
Ow!

1637
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:36,657
Oh ho. Okay.

1638
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,928
Ooh.

1639
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,129
Aah! Whoo!

1640
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:43,598
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
That's hot!

1641
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:44,699
Ow!

1642
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:48,936
Hi, baby.

1643
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:59,213
Nice mouth.

1644
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,760
And in breaking news,

1645
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,762
while airlifts
are finally under way,

1646
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:18,366
evacuating the rest
of the civilians from the area,

1647
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,802
one man and his ragtag team of...
and you're hearing this right...

1648
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:25,106
film crew actually
devised a successful plan

1649
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,108
to take down
the queen lavalantula

1650
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:29,143
and send the rest
of these creatures back down

1651
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:32,647
to their fiery home thousands
of feet below the city.

1652
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:35,116
That hero is none other
than Colton West,

1653
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,352
who, against all odds,
risked life and limb

1654
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,488
to save this still great city.

1655
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:42,823
And all that this reporter
can say,

1656
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:46,460
in the now infamous words
of Colton West, is nice job.

1657
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:59,740
Oh, hey, buddy.
Come on. Come on.

1658
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:00,741
Over here.

1659
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:02,043
Hey, come on. Oh.

1660
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:03,678
Come on.
Come on. We got you.

1661
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:05,046
Oh, thank you.
We got you.

1662
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,213
Ho ho ho. Step up.

1663
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,149
You all right?
Yeah.

1664
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:10,317
You still... Oh, yeah.
Aw, man. Ow!

1665
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,519
Nice suit.
Yeah.

1666
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:13,421
I'm really glad
you kept it.

1667
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,256
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

1668
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,159
Dad!

1669
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,494
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1670
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,996
I'm fine, my son.

1671
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,831
Dad, I was watching
the news the whole time,

1672
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:25,366
It was so cool!
My good boy.

1673
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,434
Oh, he's a good boy.

1674
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:28,335
You are crazy.
Oh, yeah.

1675
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,037
You know that?
Oh, yeah.

1676
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:31,605
Honey, I really hurt.
I think I broke...

1677
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,340
Come on. Come on.
I think I broke my face.

1678
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,675
Get him out of here.

1679
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,277
Oh, I think... I gotta
go to the hospital.

1680
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:37,378
But, Dad...
Yeah?

1681
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:38,612
Dad, you did it.
Yeah. Yeah.

1682
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:39,747
The West family did it.

1683
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:40,848
Yeah, we did it.
We all did.

1684
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,416
I think I did
a lot of it,

1685
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:43,918
but I think
we did it together.

1686
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:46,787
I smell a sequel
coming on.

1687
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:49,090
"Red Rocket 2"?

1688
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,424
"Attack
of the Lavalantulas."

1689
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:51,425
Ah.

1690
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,426
Everybody gets a suit.

1691
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:53,594
I want a suit.

1692
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,362
Well, you could
put me in mine.

1693
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:56,597
Ooh, I like that.

1694
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:57,932
Oh, yeah, baby.

1695
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:00,301
Yeah. Aw, yeah.

1696
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:02,636
Aw, yeah, baby.

1697
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:04,438
♪ Red Rocket
in the house, yo ♪

1698
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,707
We thinking about all kinds
of Red Rocket products.

1699
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,942
Yeah.
Red Rocket tacos.

1700
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,777
Red Rocket lipstick.

1701
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:11,078
Red Rocket lipstick.

1702
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,713
Red Rocket burritos,
Red-ritos.

1703
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,381
Red Rocket shoes.
Ha ha ha ha.

1704
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,649
Red Rocket rockets.

1705
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:17,651
Red Rocket rockets.
Y-Yeah.

1706
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:21,455
...against the Mamalantula
and lavalantulas

1707
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:24,925
have brought an end to
a chaotic and terrifying day.

1708
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,660
But many wonder aloud

1709
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,730
if this is the last
we've seen of the lavalantulas.
