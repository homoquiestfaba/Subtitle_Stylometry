[alarm and beeping continue]

6
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,125
[nurse] Can I get some help in here?

00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,333
[voice over PA] <i>Code Blue, section 12.</i>

[nurse] I need some help, please!

10
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,083
[nurse 2] What's going on?

11
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:21,208
[nurse] Came in, he was seizing,
then he started coding.

12
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,166
- [nurse 2] I'll get the bag.
- [nurse 3] What's going on, Charlie?

13
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,500
[Charlie] I came in, he was seizing,
he went into V-tach, and then he coded.

14
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,791
- Let's swap compressions.
- [Charlie] Okay.

15
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,166
[nurse 3] In three, two, one…

[doctor] Okay, what's going on in here?

19
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,458
[Charlie] I heard the alarm from the hall.
I came in and saw he was seizing,

20
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,500
silenced the vent,
noticed he was in V-tach,

21
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,750
and then he went asystolic.

22
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,625
- [nurse 2] Compressions.
- [nurse 3] Watch out.

23

No epi yet.
He's about a minute into compressions.

00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,791
Okay. Let's get the epi started, please,

25
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,708
and let's pause in a minute
for a pulse check.

26
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,666

70
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,541
[doctor] He's had enough.

71
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,291
Mark the time of death.

72
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,666
And let's call his wife.

[patient] Oh.

82
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,375
- How long have you two been married?
- Three years.

83
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,666
Wow. Couple o' newlyweds.

85
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,208
You know, baby, I love you so much.

00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,291
All right. I have got it.

Can we get her some water, please?

90
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,250
Sorry, she can't have any until tomorrow.
She still might choke.

91
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,583
But here.

92
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,458
This is gonna make her feel better.

93
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,291
- I have to go, but I'll be back.
- No. No, you can't go.

94
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,333
[man] You know the rules.
I'm not allowed to stay.

95
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,291
Hey, Sam, this chair reclines.

96
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,541
You want a blanket and pillow?

97
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,125
[Sam] Yeah. Thanks. Yeah.

98
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,833
Okay. I won't tell if you don't.

99
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,750
- I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

100
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,333
You've pushed a liter.
I don't understand why his pressure's low.

101
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,041
They don't know, but they want
another set of labs at midnight.

102
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, what about Holly?

103
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,375
Holly is stable,
but they still need to get...

104
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,416
Amy.

105
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,250
I'd like to have a word with you
about 310.

106
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,666
Jeez.

107
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,125
You let a relative sleep over?

108
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,041
An old man, yeah.
He was exhausted, and it was 1:00 a.m.

109
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,125
We don't have the staff
to run a hotel for relatives.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,708
Management has got me
rationing coffee filters.

111
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,166
Every penny is like a freaking prisoner.

112
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,500
I had to beg Linda Garran for extra staff.

113
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,000
Right.

114
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,750
But I got nights some help, okay?

115
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,375
A new guy, tons of experience,
great recommendations.

116
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,375
- Oh.
- [phone rings]

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,916
Great.

00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,833
Hey, Holly, it's Amy.

122
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,583
All right,
I'm just gonna turn you a little bit.

123
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,458
Just put this arm down.

124
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,916
Hey, I ran into your sister
when I started my shift.

125
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,000
She's so nice. Did you guys
have a good time together?

126
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,250
I can't believe she's got twins.

127
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,333
I don't know how…

128
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,375
She does that.

129
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,708
Okay.

130
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,208
One, two, three. [strains]

131
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,375
[whispers] Okay, one…

132
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,541
[groans]

133
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,750
[sighs]

134
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,333
Ah…

135
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,750
[breathes shakily]

136
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,666

[radio turns off]

142
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,541
How was the fried chicken?
Did you do the paper bag shake?

143
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,625
Yeah, I did the whole thing.
Whatever Julia Child said, I did.

144
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,625
[both laugh]

145
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,083
- [Amy] Amazing.
- Um…

146
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,916
Uh, I think… you still owe me
for last Friday.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,750
But… But it can wait, really.

148
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,333
Oh no! I'm sorry.

149
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,375
[woman] No, really, it's okay.

150
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,875
I'm such an idiot.

151
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,333
- Okay, 20, 40…
- Listen, you really don't have to do this.

152
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,958
- I don't need it all.
- Six, seven… No, no, no. Eight, nine…

153
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,625
Come on. Here, take it.
There's 50. Sorry about that.

154
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,666
- Thank you. I'm sorry too.
- It's yours.

155
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,000
[girl 1] Come on, Mr. Teddy.
We're going to school!

156
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,625
I think we talked about Mr. Teddy
not going to school before.

157
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,875
- [girl 2] Thanks, Mom.
- Come here, Mr. Bag.

158
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,958
[girl 2] I'm ready.

159
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,833
- Bye.
- [Amy] Have the best day.

160
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,083
- [girl 1] Bye!
- [Amy] Love you!

161
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,125
- You need some milk, by the way.
- Okay. I'll get it.

162
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,041
- See you later.
- Thanks.

[door closes]

164
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,791
[woman] Off to class, girls.

165
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,375
[machine beeps steadily]

166
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,166
Hmm.

167
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,541
[doctor] So it's not the news
we were hoping for.

168
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,583
Hmm.

169
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,875
How bad we talkin'?

170
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,333
If you continue like this,

171
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,791
you're looking at a serious
coronary incident within months,

172
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,041
which could be fatal.

173
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,333
At the last appointment,
you said that there were options.

174
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,916
I know, but that was
before we got these results.

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,083
This is now about
keeping your heart going long enough.

176
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:43,916
For what?

177
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,375
To get you on the transplant list.

178
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,291
And you'll have to stop working,
take medical leave.

179
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,583
I can't. I need health insurance,

180
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,125
and I don't get paid leave
until I've been there a year.

181
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,458
[sighs]

182
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,791
You have kids, right?

183
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,791
Mm-hmm.

184
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, you're at high risk for a stroke.

185
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,083
You should make them aware
of the symptoms.

186
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:19,333
The early warning signs of an episode
are breathlessness, pressure in the chest,

187
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,625
feeling weak or faint.

188
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,833
You need to tell them in case
something should happen at home. Okay?

189
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,208
- Hi. Loughren.
- [receptionist] Mm-hmm.

190
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,541
I'm checking out.

191
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,375
[receptionist] Sure.

192
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,041
- So I see you're not covered?
- Nope.

193
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:42,083
[receptionist] With the test
and consultation, it'll be $980.

194
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,208
Um…

195
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,625
Can I split it in two?

196
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,625
Sure thing.

197
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,416
[rain patters]

198
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,083
[woman over speaker]
<i>Maria, can you turn me up? Watch TV.</i>

199
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,291
<i>…vitamin D. Thank you.</i>

200
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:38,791
[machines beeping, whirring]

201
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,250
- Hey.
- Oh.

202
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,583
- You the new guy?
- Ah, yeah, Charlie.

203
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,916
Hi, Charlie. Amy.

204
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,458
- Oh, hey, Amy.
- Nice to meet you.

205
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,791
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

206
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,208
- Did anyone give you the tour yet?
- Uh, no, not yet.

207
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,458
- I got my patients, but, um…
- Okay, come on, let me show you around.

208
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,333
The computer's free for all.

209
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,333
There's a code to access the bathroom,
very importantly,

210
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,125
the highly original code 4321.

211
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,416
Uncrackable.

212
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,791
Ha!

213
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,250
Uh, you ever work with PYXIS?

214
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,958
Yeah, but I think
we had the '97 model. The, um…

215
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,875
Huh, okay, come on. Let me show you.

216
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,833
Put in your nurse ID.

217
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,500
And then your code.

218
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,125
You put in what you need.

219
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,083
And the amount.

220
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:42,958
[whirring]

221
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,833
Take it out. One, two, three, four, five.
Close the drawer.

222
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,166
- Got it?
- Yeah.

223
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,708
Uh, they said you had a lot of experience.
Where'd you work at before?

224
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,541
I've been all over, really.

225
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,458
- Florians, Vance, Shawlands, St. Aloysius.
- Shawlands.

226
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,416
A girl I trained with works at Shawlands.

227
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,375
- Oh, yeah?
- Lori.

228
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,500
- Lucas?
- Yes.

229
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,583
Yeah, we worked together a lot.
She's great. She's an amazing nurse.

230
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,541
I haven't talked to her forever.

231
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,916
[chuckles] Do they still
call her "Pocket Rocket"?

232
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,750
No. Oh my God. That's hilarious.

233
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,625
I should… I'll call her up
and ask her about that.

234
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,958
Oh God. Please don't.
Don't tell her I told you that. [chuckles]

235
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,375
Who'd they give you tonight?

236
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,500
Uh… Who did they give me?

237
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:30,416
I have 311, uh, Stevens. 310, Martinez.

238
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,875
Do you know their first names? You guys,
you don't put 'em on the doors here.

239
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,000
You're like me.
First names are always better.

240
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,500
- Ana. Let's start with her.
- Ana.

241
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,875
She presented to the ED
with an adverse reaction to amoxicillin.

242
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,958
Kicker is the prescription
was her husband's,

243
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,125
so insurance is gonna try
to screw them over

244
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,375
if we give 'em a chance.

245
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,875
- So how's the skin?
- Sloughing off at this point.

246
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,416
And what, so clears only?

247
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,166
Yeah. First sip tonight.
Come on. I'll introduce you.

248
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,541
Water later.

249
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,333
Well, hey there, lovebirds.

250
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,458
[chuckles]

251
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,416
- Look what I brought.
- Hey.

252
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,583
Here you go.

253
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,000
[weakly] Mm!

254
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,958
Is that the best thing
you have ever tasted?

255
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,333
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm?

256
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,791
- [Amy] There you go.
- [chokes]

257
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,541
[Amy] You know what?
Let's start slow, all right?

258
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,125
- I wanna introduce you to Charlie.
- Hey.

259
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:23,875
He's gonna be your nurse this evening,
but, you know, I'm around if you need me.

260
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay?

261
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,541
- So…
- How you doing, Sam? Good?

262
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,666
You let me know when you've had enough.

263
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,625
[Ana] Mm.

264
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,458
- Okay, is it burning? It burns? Okay.
- I'll check in in a bit.

265
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,583
Well, let's take a pause, okay?

266
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:43,416
So, um… tell me, I heard
you had a rough couple of days. Yeah?

267
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,375
Well, you guys just push on the button
if you need anything.

268
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:50,291
Anytime, I'm here.
I'm your Amy for tonight.

269
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,000
[both chuckle]

270
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,666
[machines beeping, whirring]

271
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,541
- [knocks twice]
- Hey.

272
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,458
Hey.

273
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,958
Uh, so mine are all settled,

274
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,916
so I was just gonna go to the cafeteria,
grab some food.

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
- You want something?
- Sorry. Cafeteria closes at 11:00.

276
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,416
- I should've told you that.
- Oh shit. No problem. I'm not that hungry.

277
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,250
- Sorry.
- No. I'll hit up the vending machines.

278
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,541
- Hey, you know what? You like eggs?
- Uh…

279
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:21,500
I have a large questionable… [chuckles]
…egg salad that I'd prefer to share.

280
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,875
- You know, safety in numbers.
- I'm fine, thank you.

281
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,333
No, no. I'll bring it to the desk
when I'm finished with Holly here.

282
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,791
- You sure?
- Yeah.

283
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,083
'Kay, thanks.

284
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,958
I like the croutons.

285
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,208
- Mm, you mean the soggy crackers?
- That's what they are?

286
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,958
That's the real delicacy of the salad.

287
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,583
Yeah. My eldest daughter made it.

288
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,041
She comes from a long line of women
who can't cook.

289
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,583
What, so your husband cooks?

290
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,541
No, it's just me and my girls.

291
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,500
Oh. I have two girls.

292
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,041
Uh… Four and seven.

293
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,000
Mine are five and nine.

294
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,541
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:05,208
I don't live with mine anymore though.
Their mom moved, like, six hours away, so…

296
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,708
That's kinda why I'm here.

297
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,541
- Well, I think this is great.
- [chuckles]

298
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,083
- Okay.
- [alert beeping]

299
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,041
- Oh, he's...
- 307.

300
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:21,541
Yep. Steven. I have about
one minute before he pees.

301
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,750
I got it.

302
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,916
You sure? Thanks.

303
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,875
Hey, Steven. I'm Charlie.
I'm afraid Amy's busy right now, so…

304
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,333
Can I help? A little problem?

305
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,416
[patient chats indistinctly]

306
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,208
[girl] Yes, you can!

307
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,000
- Look.
- [woman] So what? You don't even like her.

308
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,250
- [girl] I do! She's my friend, Jackie!
- [Jackie] Nobody's gonna notice that.

309
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,833
[girl] Everybody's gonna notice!

310
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,875
[Jackie] No, they're not. Come on. Really.

311
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,708
[girl] Yes, they are! I don't know
why I have to keep using these.

312
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,625
[Amy] Hey.

313
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,791
It's such crap!

314
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,375
- Stop it! What's going on here?
- You ruined my shoes!

315
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,958
I did not! I tried to help you.

316
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,166
- Would you mind sitting with Maya?
- No, you obviously didn't, Jackie!

317
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,583
- She's in the...
- That's okay.

318
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,166
Why the hell
are you yelling at Jackie?

319
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,125
- She glued the bottom back on.
- It's not a big deal, Alex.

320
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,041
- I can scrape it off.
- You told her to.

321
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,791
Look, it comes right off.

322
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,291
- But it's on both shoes.
- See? I can take it off.

323
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,833
- I'll just...
- No, you can't.

324
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,916
Calm down. It's not the end of the world.

325
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No.

326
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,000
- Wait. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen. I know.
- Stop...

327
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,375
I'm trying, okay? I know you don't have
as much as your friends, but I'm try...

328
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,041
I don't get anything!

329
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,083
- I don't even get to have you.
- I'm sorr…

330
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,250
[door slams]

331
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,375
Oh fuck.

332
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,833
[exhales]

333

[troubling music playing]

337
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,625

[gags]

344
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,000
[Charlie] Amy?

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,916
What's going on? You okay?

346
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,458
[softly] I'm fine.

347
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,208
Okay, well, I'll just sit here
until you feel better, okay?

348
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,125
Now breathe with me.

349
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,875

350
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,583

[both inhale and exhale deeply]

352
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,291
Keep breathing.

353
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,125
[Amy's voice shakes]

354
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,916
[Charlie] It's okay.

355
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,541
[shakily] Cardiomyopathy.

356
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,375
Blood blisters on… on my heart.

357
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,333
Okay. So why are you working?

358
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,958
I don't have health insurance.

359
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:30,791
What about here?

360
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,625
- Did you speak to a cardiologist?
- No, please.

361
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,708
Okay.

362
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,250
Don't tell them.

363
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,041
- I'll get fired.
- Okay.

364
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,875
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

365
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,666
- Okay.
- Yeah.

366
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,791
How much longer do you need to work here
before you get your insurance?

367
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,083
Four months.

368
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,916
Okay.

369
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,708
I can help you.

370
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,166
Come on.

371
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,666
[chuckles]

372
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,083
You can do four months.

373
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,166
[wheezes, laughs]

374
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,625
You're gonna be okay.

375
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,125
Yeah?

376
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,416
- Are you cold?
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,000
Here.

378
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,083

[car door handle clicking]

381
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,458
- Something's wrong with the door.
- Oh, it's this.

382
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,291
Ah. [chuckles] Thanks.

383
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,583
- It's gonna be a long night.
- Speaking of energy, how was the park?

384
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,458
- She canceled.
- No!

385
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,458
- Yeah. Moved it to next week.
- Oh, that's hard.

386
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,458
Called just as I was
about to pick up the girls.

387
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:34,500
Yeah.

388
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,583
Kind of expected it, to be honest.

389
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,000
Uh, one sec.

390
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,166
Hey, what's up? Where's Sonya?

391
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,500
What have we got?

392
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:45,500
She had a family thing,
so I said I'd do her handover.

393
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,416
- Uh, 310…
- Yeah.

394
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,458
…expired right at shift change.

395
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,375
- Ana?
- [Viv] Yes. Mrs. Martinez.

396
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,583
Don't ask. I don't know what happened.

397
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,291
The husband was called. He's on his way.

398
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,791
309, he went sideways at around noon…

399
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,958
Ana died.

400
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,708
[Viv] Should be up around eight.
Respiratory came up. They tubed him…

401
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:15,833
- [rain pattering]
- [plastic crinkling]

402
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,250
[Amy] How could they just leave her
like this?

403
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,625
My mom died in a hospital
when I was a kid.

404
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,750
When I got there to see her, it was…

405
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,791
Well, first of all, they lost the body.

406
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,708
- No.
- Yeah. Insane. Just for a couple of hours.

407
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,208
But, you know, and then
when they did find her, it was this.

408
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:42,375
She was, like, you know,
half uncovered, naked… Total mess.

409
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:47,083
For the longest time, that was the memory.
That was how I thought of her.

410
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,416
Oh, Charlie.

411
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,583
So, for me, this is the important part.

412
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,708
Yeah.

413
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:56,541
Find some dignity.

414
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,125
[knocking on door]

415
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,250
Mr. Martinez is out there.

416
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,416
He would really like
to speak with you, Amy.

417
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,250
Go.

418
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,916
- You good?
- Yeah, I got this.

419
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,958
[somber music playing]

420
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,666
[no audible dialogue]22

[liquid drips]

422
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,916
[man 1] All right,
so give me the story again.

423
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,250
[man 2] All right, let me see.
Suspicious death of Mrs. Martinez, Ana.

424
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:03,083
Presented to the emergency room
with adverse reaction to amoxicillin.

425
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,833
All right, so?
Reacts to some antibiotic. What else?

426
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,500
They're not sure.

427
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,625
- They don't know what killed her?
- No.

428
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,041
[radio chatter]

429
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,375
How old was she?

430
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,708
Seventy-seven.

431
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,125
Seventy-seven.

432
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,250
So why are we here?

433
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,375
[car door slams]

434
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,458

[woman 1] <i>The conference room's</i>
<i>right this way.</i>

436
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,916
[woman 2] Detectives,
Braun, Baldwin, welcome.

437
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,833
I'm Linda Garran, risk manager.

438
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,708
This is Duncan Beattie, attorney.

439
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:39,750
Our board.

440
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:43,500
You two might know Malcolm Burrel
from the City Council.

441
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:46,833
I am a huge supporter of the local force
and the district attorney.

442
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,125
Ah, well, nice to meet you all.

443
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,125
Okay, well, we don't know much.

444
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,125
Just that there's been a death.

445
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,541
An unexplainable incident
in which the patient expired.

446
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,708
Okay. Unexplainable how?

447
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,041
Well, it's the opinion
of the medical experts

448
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:09,083
that this was an unusual
adverse reaction to medications.

449
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:13,750
But we found absolutely nothing
to suggest this was intentional.

450
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:14,708
Then why call us?

451
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,666
We didn't think this was a police matter,

452
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,666
but the Department of Health dictates
when we should reach out,

453
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,916
and here we are.

454
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,375
What are the medications?

455
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:26,708
Um… Well, all are listed.

456
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:27,750
[Baldwin] Thanks.

457
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,416
[sighs]

458
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
It's quite a complicated document.

459
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,708
I'll take my chances.

460
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,250
Well, if you… if you turn
to the third page,

461
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:46,375
you can see the window in which
patient I had abnormal laboratory results

462
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,958
and life-threatening symptoms.

463
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,250
Where's Mrs. Martinez's body?

464
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,208
Uh, released to the family.

465
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,125
They put a lawsuit together?

466
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:58,208
We don't believe that the family are aware

467
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:01,958
of the unusual circumstances
around patient 1's expiration.

468
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,375
Isn't that something
you should've disclosed to them?

469
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:10,041
It was an evolving situation.

470
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,000
Park field rightly sought legal counsel

471
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,083
to make sure
everything was done correctly.

472
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:17,333
Okay, but Mrs. Martinez's body is where?
How do we get it?

473
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:20,750
It's our understanding
the family have cremated her.

474
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,166
When did she die?

475
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,875
Seven weeks ago.

476
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,208
We were conducting
an internal investigation.

477
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,875
Hence the lag.

478
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:42,041
Okay.

479
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:46,750
Well, of course we'll need to interview
all the staff that works in the ICU.

480
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,375
Make way, make way.
I am an important person of the town.

481
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:55,500
In fact, I am <i>the</i> most important person
of the town,

482
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:59,833
if not the most important person
west of the Pecos.

483
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,333
[Charlie and Maya] "Wherever that is!"

484
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,666
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

485
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,958
"So, what do you do?"

486
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,833
"Do"? I don't do anything. I'm the mayor.

487
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:09,958
Okay. [chuckles]

488
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,166
"Well, you have to do something now."

489
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,041
"This may be just a one-horse town
without the horse,

490
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,125
but it's been invaded by aliens."

491
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:20,333
I'll have to look it up
in my book of <i>How to be Mayor.</i>

492
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,500
One. You get to wear a fancy chain.

493
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:27,666
Two. You get driven around in a big car
by your very own chauffeur.

494
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,750
Three…

495
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,250
[chomps]

496
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,875
Om nom!

497
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,291
You eat. It's…

498
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,125
"Three. You eat and drink for fr..."
[grunts]

499
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:48,000
- I'm never gonna get this part!
- Don't get frustrated, honey.

500
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,916
Are you kidding? This is great, Alex.

501
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,041
No, and the teacher said that I should
wear a suit and have a mustache.

502
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:58,458
Dress like a man because I'm the mayor.
He said a girl mayor would be weird.

503
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:00,291
Women can be mayors.

504
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,458
I told him that, but...

505
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:05,333
It's a play about an alien invasion,
and the female mayor's the weird part?

506
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,166
- Screw that guy.
- [chuckles]

507
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,750
- [Jackie] I'm here!
- [Amy] Hey!

508
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,250
- [Maya] Jackie!
- No! You can't go yet.

509
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,458
- Oh, sorry, kiddo.
- [Jackie] Come on, sweetheart.

510
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,916
- Come here.
- [Jackie] Guess what I brought you.

511
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,541
Okay, take my hands.

512
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,250
Repeat after me.

513
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,875
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

514
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:26,791
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

515
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:28,875
I am the <i>mayor</i> of Humdrum Falls.

516
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,458
I am the <i>mayor</i> of Humdrum Falls.

517
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:33,375
- I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.
- I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

518
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,291
[both]
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

519
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,291
[Charlie] You got this.

520
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:38,583
[Braun] Cream and two sugars.

521
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,833
They send over
that internal investigation yet?

522
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:47,375
Oh, not yet. They say they need more time
to compile all the relevant files.

523
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,375
Seven weeks wasn't enough of a head start?

524
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,583
You'd think.

525
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,833
You want me to

526
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,541
go through the staff?

527
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,666
Already did.

528
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,500
One of the nurses
had a criminal trespass charge

529
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,166
over in Pennsylvania.

530
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:04,958
Oh yeah? A nurse?

531
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,208
Yeah, a male nurse.
Charles Cullen. C-U-L-L-E-N.

532
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,291
Huh. When?

533
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,458
Uh, eight years ago.

534
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:14,250
- What district was it in Pennsylvania?
- Palmer.

535
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,458
- [dial tone drones]
- [buttons clack]

536
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:18,708
[line dials]

537
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,416
<i>- Palmer Police Department.</i>
- Hello, ma'am.

538
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,083
I'm Detective Braun with Homicide
in the Prosecutor's Office in New Jersey.

539
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,916
I need some background
on a guy you picked up there in '95.

540
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,291
Could you pull the case jacket for me?

541
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:32,291
<i>- Do you have a name for me?</i>
- It's Charles Cullen.

542
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,875
<i>- Oh, there's a Post-it note on the file.</i>
- There's a Post-it note on the file.

543
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,500
She's not sure if it's supposed to
be there. Can you spell that?

544
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,958
<i>It says "digoxin."</i>

545
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,083
Digoxin? What is that?
A medicine or something?

546
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:45,166
- [indistinct response]
- [chuckles]

547
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,583
Uh, you got anything else on him?

548
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,083
<i>Picked up for trespassing and…</i>

549
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:53,916
Okay. Picked up for trespassing
and harassment in '95.

550
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,875
Says he slashed a coworker's tires
after they broke up.

551
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,583
<i>The charges were dropped.</i>

552
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:00,291
- What's that?
<i>- Yep, all charges.</i>

553
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,625
Charges were dropped?

554
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,583
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Oh.

555
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,125
Okay, thanks so much.

556
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,458
<i>- Yep.</i>
- Bye-bye.

557
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,958
Something's not right.

558
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,625
Park field waited almost two months
to report it.

559
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,708
Internal investigation
you don't wanna share.

560
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:19,875
Expensive lawyers.

561
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Okay.

562
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Well…

563
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:30,041
What possible reason could they have
for covering up a death?

564
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,541
Right? What are the motives?

565
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,541
It's a business. There's never
a better motivation than money

566
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,083
when it comes to that shit, right?

567
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:44,833
- [mic feeds back]
- [clears throat]

568
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:48,000
Hello? You can keep eating.

569
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,458
We won't take up too much of your time.

570
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:54,916
We just wanna make you aware
of an event the hospital is looking into.

571
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,458
We wanted to assure you all
that the board and I

572
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:00,750
are dealing with the incident
and everything connected to it.

573
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:03,291
But we thought it best
to bring you all together,

574
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:07,500
make everyone universally aware
that the police are also involved.

575
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,083
- And that...
- What is this about?

576
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,458
Uh, there's been an issue
with a patient's death in the ICU.

577
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:18,208
Was the death suspicious?
I mean, if the police are investigating…

578
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:22,000
I wanna be clear. <i>We</i> are investigating
with the assistance of the local police.

579
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,208
- Do you know which patient?
- No.

580
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,708
[Garran] But due to the fact
that outside investigation is involved,

581
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:30,208
uh, Mr. Beattie, our attorney, is here,

582
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,833
and he would like
to say something as well.

583
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Thanks.

584
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,583
Yes, uh, I just wanna say

585
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,250
that I'll be discussing
with each of you individually,

586
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:44,250
but as a blanket statement to all,

587
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,250
I just wanna say that in times like this,

588
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:51,250
patient confidentiality
has to be an absolute priority.

589
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:55,583
Your individual contracts
are very precise when it comes to this.

590
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,416
Anyone speaking to the police

591
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,166
without a representative
of the hospital present

592
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,000
would be in breach of their contract.

593
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:03,708
[crowd murmurs]

594
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:12,833
[clears throat] So at the end of the day,
Mr. Beattie and I are here for you.

595
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:15,125
Uh, we wanna be present
for any interviews,

596
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,208
because we have
your best interests at heart.

597
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:20,708
You have full access,
but she's gotta be in the room.

598
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,708
No. Absolutely not. She can't be in there.

599
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,208
That lady's the risk manager.
It's her job to be in there.

600
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,458
Who's gonna talk
if their boss is in the interview?

601
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:32,958
We don't even know what happened.
We don't even have a body.

602
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:36,625
The only condition that they asked for
is that she be in the room

603
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:39,000
and that you don't talk specific
about medications.

604
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:42,833
I understand them asking for it,
but why did you give it to them?

605
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:45,166
You're supposed to be the prosecutor.

606
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,166
As far as I can see,

607
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,916
they're cooperating fully
with your investigation.

608
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,875
This is all we have. Is this cooperation?

609
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,583
[prosecutor] They told me about that.

610
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:58,375
They're getting the documents together.
It's done. They're sending it first thing.

611
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:00,833
[Baldwin] Let me ask.

612
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:04,541
Why would Park field
conduct an internal investigation,

613
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,333
a seven-week internal investigation,

614
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:10,125
then call us in
and put her in the room if it was nothing?

615
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,458
Due diligence.

616
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,875
I'm shutting it down. She's in the room.

617
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,583
Done.

618
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,291
[sighs]

619
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:28,500
[door opens]

620
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,208
Hi, Amy.

621
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,583
Hi. [clears throat]

622
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,416
Nurse Loughren.

623
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,166
- This is Officer Braun, Baldwin.
- How you doin'?

624
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,083
- What is this about?
- [Garran] Just some informal questions.

625
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,541
The officers are speaking
to a number of staff in the ICU.

626
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:46,625
[Amy] Okay.

627
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,416
Do you remember Ana Martinez?

628
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah, Ana was my patient.

629
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:03,291
Do you recall anything odd
about what happened to her?

630
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,583
Odd?

631
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,166
[Braun] Well, she died.

632
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:11,041
Yeah, and it was very sad. It was sudden.

633
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,708
Sudden?

634
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,875
Well, patients die in the ICU, but…

635
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,625
We didn't expect it.

636
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:18,666
[knocking on door]

637
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,833
[door opens]

638
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:22,916
I don't mean to interrupt.
Can I see you for a minute?

639
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,541
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

640
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:31,625
This better be important.
I wanted no interruptions.

641
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,625
You see any deviations there?

642
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,666
Mm-mm.

643
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,375
Wait, yeah. Her glucose.

644
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:55,625
It's, uh…

645
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,500
Yeah, the blood sugars, it's wrong.

646
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,291
Uh, there's no C-peps.

647
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,083
- That's weird.
- What does that mean?

648
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:08,875
Uh, it means that the insulin
in her system wasn't made in her body.

649
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:10,500
Someone gave it to her.

650
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,791
So you can tell from that
that she was given insulin?

651
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:17,208
Well, it's not on the list,
and, you know, she's, uh… not diabetic,

652
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:20,166
so the insulin would've been
a double medication error,

653
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,041
which is really rare, so…

654
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,083
A double medication error? It's rare?

655
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,333
Yeah.

656
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,708
- Would that have killed her?
- Sure.

657
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:32,833
[footsteps approach]

658
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:34,916
[Garran] Sorry.

659
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,291
- [door closes]
- [Garran] Where were we?

660
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,583
Uh, let's see. Oh.

661
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:43,666
Can you tell us anything
about your coworkers?

662
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,833
You don't mind if she answers a question
about a colleague, do you, Ms. Garran?

663
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:48,500
- Of course not.
- [Braun] Good

664
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:51,000
[Baldwin] We understand
that you work with a Charlie Cullen.

665
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,708
- [Amy] Yeah.
- Could he be involved in this?

666
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,250
I think you're jumping
to conclusions there, Officer.

667
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,958
Charlie wasn't there.

668
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:02,208
I mean, Ana died on the day shift.
Charlie and I both work nights.

669
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:06,541
We have no reasons to suspect
it was anything other than an accident.

670
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,791
Thank you, Amy.

671
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:10,833
I know Charlie really well.

672
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:14,458
We work every shift together,
and he's a very good nurse.

673
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,375
He wouldn't have made a mistake like that.

674
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,500
Thank you, Amy.

675
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:25,916
- So where's that internal investigation?
- We're still reviewing everything.

676
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,625
Well, we don't need you to review it.
We'll just take it as it is.

677
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:33,750
I'll instruct the team
to send you the boxes tomorrow.

678
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:38,625
But I hope you can deduce
that, um… it's been a tough seven weeks.

679
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,750
Eight.

680
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,291
It's been eight weeks.

681
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:45,250
- [frantic beeping]
- [doctor 1] Jack Ivins. July 19, '88.

682
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:49,500
Recovering from gallbladder surgery
on Thursday. There was no complications.

683
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:51,750
[woman] Line in.

684
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:55,416
[doctor 2] Gonna need you to get ready
to do another shock, 150 joules.

685
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,208
- Everybody clear.
- [doctor 3] Clear.

686
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:00,250
[doctor 2] Deliver the shock. Shock.

687
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,958
Resume compressions.

688
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,666
[doctor 4] One and two and three and four
and five and six…

689
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:09,000
- [doctor 2] Compressions.
- Nine, ten, 11, 12, 13…

690
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:11,166
[doctor 2] Hold compressions.
Let's check for a rhythm.

691
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,416
- [doctor 3] I got nothing.
- [doctor 2] Persistent V-fib.

692
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,583
Resume compressions.

693
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:19,000
Let's get one milligram
of epinephrine IV started.

694
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,166
[doctor 3] Six, seven, eight, nine, ten…

695
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,500
[doctor 2] Let's get prepared
to give it another shock, 200 joules.

696
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,375
[doctor 1] Epi ready. In line.

697
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,875
[doctor 2] Continue your breathing.

698
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,083
- [doctor 3] Twenty.
- [doctor 1] Keep your compressions.

699
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,083
[doctor 3] Talk to me.

700
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,833
- [doctor 2] Is that epi ready?
- [Amy groans]

701
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:37,625
Swap in, five, four, three, two…

702
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:40,125
- [gasping for breath]
- [doctor 3] You're all clear.

703
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,166
- Oxygen's clear.
- [defibrillation thumps]

704
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,125
[doctor 1] I'm moving in.
Low pulse, low pulse.

705
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:48,000
- Shit, no pressure, still.
- [continuous beep droning]

706
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,875
[doctor 2] Four and five and six and seven

707
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:54,125
and eight and nine, ten,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

708
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:55,458
Shit.

709
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,666
Twenty-five. Now! Now!

710
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,750
[Amy gasps breathlessly]

711
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,750
[doctor 2, muffled] Let's go!

712
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,541
- [high-pitched ringing]
- [Amy breathes shakily]

713
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,333
[droning music playing]

714
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:35,583
[drawer closes]

715
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:37,291
[water runs]

716
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,375
Take these.

717
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:55,000
[exhales]

718
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,916
[music fades]

719
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,291
[softly] You'll get fired.

720
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,791
So there's a fault in the PYXIS.

721
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:21,375
So if you cancel a request late enough,
it opens anyway.

722
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,875
That's stealing meds, Charlie.

723
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:30,041
Amy, stop. Now, please don't worry.
I'm gonna help you get through this.

724
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:40,916
[pensive music playing]

725
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,541
[keys tapping]

726
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,625
[woman] Okay, thank you.

727
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:50,583
Hey, what did he say?

728
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:03,833
[Charlie] I think he's right.
I think you probably do need to tell Alex,

729
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,625
just in case something happens
and I'm not there.

730
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:12,166
They don't have anyone but me.
I can't leave them.

731
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,208
No, you're not leaving them, Amy.

732
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,333
That's not happening.
It's… What is it? Two months?

733
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:18,958
Okay, so I'm gonna help you do this.

734
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:22,250
Get your surgery, be with your girls.
That's what's happening.

735
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:26,458
Okay?

736
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,750
But I think you should tell Alex.

737
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,416
[plane whirring overhead]

738
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:04,791
[Amy] I know it sounds scary,
but… it really isn't.

739
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:08,166
[Charlie] Everybody's hearts
have these ventricles.

740
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,791
- They're just these spaces.
- Yeah.

741
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:12,666
They're two little spaces
like balloons that fill with blood.

742
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,166
- They move the blood around the body.
- Mm-hmm.

743
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:20,250
And um… mine, they just, you know,

744
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:27,208
they're too big,
and they just got a little thin.

745
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,333
But I am gonna be okay.
I've got medication.

746
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:38,750
I have doctors taking care of me,
and I'm gonna feel normal soon.

747
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:42,666
But your mom's gonna need our help, Alex.

748
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:48,500
If she were to fall
or, um, you know, start speaking funny,

749
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:51,958
or you struggle to wake her or something,

750
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:54,000
then you just…
you put Maya in front of the TV,

751
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:56,041
you call 911, and then you call me.

752
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,708
Yeah, but that's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen.

753
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:00,958
[exhales]

754
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,208
[softly] Everything's gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be okay.

755
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:10,833
Can I just go watch some TV?

756
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,208
Okay.

757
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,833
But I'll be here if you wanna…

758
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,083
[Braun] <i>Charles Cullen with a C.</i>

759
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:29,375
C-U-L-L-E-N.

[man 1] <i>Sure. Give me a second</i>
<i>while I pull up his records.</i>

761
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:34,500
Great, thanks.

00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:36,583
[easy-listening hold music playing]

[man 1] <i>Okay, I just need</i>
<i>to check something with my boss.</i>

764
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:53,125
Okay. Sure.

[man 2] <i>Hello?</i>

768
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,125
Hello. Detective Braun here.
Uh, who am I talking to?

769
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:15,041
<i>Mark Rossi.
Attorney for St. Aloysius Hospital Group.</i>

770
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:19,125
Mr. Rossi, hi.
I'm hoping you can help me out.

771
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:22,291
I'm looking for some information
on one of your former employees

772
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:24,250
from back in '96, Charles Cullen.

773
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,916
<i>Our employee data
is treated with strict confidentiality.</i>

774
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:32,541
I'm just looking to confirm his dates
of employment, not much more than that.

775
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,041
<i>We'd be happy to release
any relevant information</i>

776
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,125
<i>as soon as we see your subpoena.</i>

777
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,416
Okay, yep, thank you so much.

778
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,416
<i>Thank you.</i>

779
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,750
This is a fucking joke.

780
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:45,208
Whenever they hear his name,
no one wants to say anything.

781
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,541
Detective Baldwin?

782
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,250
- Yeah.
- It's from Park field Memorial Hospital.

783
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,958
[Baldwin] It's the internal investigation.

784
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:55,375
- Just need you to sign here.
- All right.

785
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:59,416
- Need a hand with the boxes?
- No, it's just this.

786
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:04,375
[delivery man] Have a great day.

787
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:08,833
[ominous music playing]

788
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,541
- Ms. Garran.
- Detective Baldwin.

789
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:25,166
Oh, thank you for seeing me.

790
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,083
Anything to help wrap this up.

791
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,333
So, I just have a couple of questions.

792
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,916
The "Pixie" report.
You have all the drug withdrawals...

793
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,333
Uh, PYXIS.

794
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,708
That's right.

795
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:42,833
Uh, so you've got all
of the, um, drug withdrawals

796
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:44,166
for all of the nurses on this?

797
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,416
That's correct.

798
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,166
Well, I was hoping
I could get the full report,

799
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,333
because this one only has a short window
around Ana's expiration.

800
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:55,458
I'm told it only stores the information
for four weeks.

801
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:59,416
Well, you must have gotten a copy
during the internal investigation, right?

802
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,375
I don't believe we did, no.

803
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:05,166
I mean, I can check, but, uh…
everything we had was sent to you.

804
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,541
You see, this is page nine,

805
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:12,166
so pages one to eight
gotta be around here somewhere.

806
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,333
Hmm.

807
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,333
- Uh, I'll be sure to look into it.
- [clicks pen]

808
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,041
Nurse Garran, it's looking a lot like
you're withholding some evidence here.

809
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,375
- I'm not sure I follow...
- Six pages. Where's the rest of it?

810
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:31,333
I'm sorry. I… I have another meeting,
and I can't shift it...

811
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:33,083
Oh, I'm not done.

812
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:35,166
I'm gonna reschedule with your office.

813
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,833
Sit down.

814
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,541
- Excuse me...
- Sit the fuck down!

815
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:54,833
[ominous music playing]

816
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:01,166
You know exactly what you're doing.

817
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:06,083

819
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,666
- [Amy] Hey, guys.
- [woman] Hey.

820
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:25,375
Um, I know you're not supposed
to have babies in here,

821
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:28,458
but I really didn't have
anyone else who could take her.

822
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,125
- It's okay.
- [man] Thank you.

823
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:35,166
- [Amy] What's her name?
- Vanessa.

824
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,833
Messy Nessie.

825
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:39,375
- Messy Nessie?
- [woman] Uh-huh.

826
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:43,000
Well, I have two girls, so I hear that.

827
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,166
- Mm.
- [Amy] How old is she?

828
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,166
Six months.

829
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,166
Oh. She sleeping through the night yet?

830
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,083
- [laughs] No!
- [Amy] She must be teething.

831
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,708
- [woman] Oh, yeah.
- [Amy] Uh-huh.

832
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:54,125
[all chuckle]

833
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,625
- [woman groans]
- [knocks on door]

834
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:59,041
Nurse Loughren? It's not urgent.
There's a Code Purple in 300.

835
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,708
[chuckles] Oh, okay.

836
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,375
What's a Code Purple?

837
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,833
It means pizza's arrived.
Do you want a slice?

838
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:08,916
Oh.

839
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,458
Well, I can't say no to pizza.

840
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,708
You can't.

841
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:15,375
Unfortunately, though,
you're gonna have to say no to pizza.

842
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:16,458
Okay.

843
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:20,916
But you are healing nicely,
and will be holding Vanessa in no time.

844
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:24,916
She told me to go fuck myself
15 times on the phone.

845
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,166
Oh my God.

846
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,333
That's not nice.

847
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:30,750
I haven't even told you the best part.

848
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:33,916
So now, to try and stop me
from seeing the girls,

849
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,250
she has made up a story
about me being mean to her dog.

850
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:42,958
I'm not kidding.
It gets better and better.

851
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,666
Honestly, the whole thing
would be hilarious if it wasn't true.

852
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,333
I'm sorry.

853
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:50,958
[Charlie] No. Are you kidding?
It's my own fault.

854
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:52,666
I picked a crazy.

855
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,375
[both chuckle]

856
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:59,000
[TV character 1] <i>Oh, you know,</i>
<i>it works for me.</i>

857
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:01,375
<i>I mean, it's not, like… quickly.</i>

858
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,500
- [character 2] <i>Right.</i>
- [character 1] <i>What did you say?</i>

859
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,125
[character 2] <i>Nothing. Nothing, bro.</i>

860
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,916
- [character 1] <i>You said a… word.</i>
- [character 2] <i>I didn't.</i>

861
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,291
[Amy sighs]

862
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:10,916
[Jackie] Two minutes, girls.

863
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,416
Okay. Do you wanna get
your backpack and coat?

864
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,458
- You want a ponytail for school?
- [Alex] Sure.

865
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,500
Beautiful hair.

866
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,375
I wish we could stay home.

867
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:32,958
I wish that too.

868
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,583
- Wanna get your jacket?
- Yeah.

869
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:49,875
- Love you.
- Love you.

870
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:52,958
[TV continues indistinctly]

871
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:59,083
[Braun] What else is in that?
Anything new?

872
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,125
Um…

873
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:04,333
Yeah, there was a list
of all the medications

874
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,458
that were in Ana Martinez's system.

875
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,500
- Insulin?
- Yeah, and another one.

876
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,041
Get this. Digoxin.

877
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,416
- Digoxin?
- [door opens]

878
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,375
[man] Baldwin!

879
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,875
- Are you serious?
- Shit.

880
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:20,958
Screaming at her.

881
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:23,750
Malcolm Burrel from City Council
just called.

882
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:27,041
Danny will be happy
to apologize to Mrs. Garran.

883
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:31,000
Well, too late. You've both been banned
from the hospital property.

884
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,500
What?

885
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,333
Can't ban us from the scene of a crime
that we're investigating.

886
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:37,083
- [man] What crime?
- [Baldwin] Homicide.

887
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,791
What do you have to back this up?

888
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:41,875
The files and an interview with a nurse

889
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,375
who was certain
that the victim was given insulin.

890
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,333
Victim, what victim?

891
00:52:45,416 --> 00:52:46,666
Ana Martinez.

892
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,625
You have no body.

893
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:52,625
No body, no autopsy.
You know how this works.

894
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:54,291
[sighs]

895
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:00,916
[door slams]

896
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:04,416
Banned from the fuckin' hospital?

897
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:09,958
[machines beeping]

898
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:14,333
[Amy] Hey, Kelly.
Tom called to check on you.

899
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,958
I cannot get over
how cute that little Vanessa is.

900
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:22,083
Who's Vanessa?

901
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,916
Kelly, do you know
where you are right now?

902
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,583
I need you to answer me, hon.

903
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,333
I'm at the hospital.

904
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,500
Which hospital?

905
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,208
Uh…

906
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:47,791
All right.

907
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:49,583
Squeeze my hands.

908
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:52,583
Come on. Squeeze my hands.

909
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,250
A little light.

910
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,083
Has Tom come by?

911
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,875
He called to check on you.

912
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,583
- Hey, Tom, it's Amy from the hospital.
<i>- Hi, Amy. What's going on?</i>

913
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:21,708
I really think that you should come in.
There's been a change overnight.

914
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:28,791
I think you should come in
sooner rather than later.

915
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:30,666
Okay, see you soon.

916
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:33,250
I checked in with Beth.
She's still sleeping.

917
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:36,333
- Jack's been pushing on his call button...
- Oh my God.

918
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:37,833
What?

919
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,666
There's insulin in her system.

920
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,708

- No!
- [Vanessa groans]

931
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,208
[Amy] Mm-hmm. Yeah.

932
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:25,958
[Tom] Oh God!

933
00:56:28,166 --> 00:56:30,000
Oh my God!

00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:43,291

Shit.

937
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:24,958
Hello. Sorry to bother you like this.

938
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,083
Yeah, no.

939
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,125
We need your help, Amy.

940
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:33,458
Look, I'm sorry, guys. I… Really,
I don't know what happened to her.

941
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:35,125
To who?

942
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:38,125
Kelly Anderson. I… I mean…

943
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,708
Who's Kelly Anderson?

944
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,083
[Baldwin] Is there another victim?

945
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:46,500
Another double-medication error?

946
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:51,041
Was Cullen with Kelly Anderson?

947
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:53,166
This has nothing to do with Charlie.

948
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,208
- How well do you know him?
- Really well.

949
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:56,250
[Baldwin] Do you?

950
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,750
He's been at nine hospitals.

951
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,833
And none of 'em will talk to us.

952
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:04,166
What do you mean? I'm…

953
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:10,791
No. If something had happened,
he wouldn't have been able to get a job.

954
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:13,666
- The hospital would have done something.
- You'd think so.

955
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,750
Yeah.

956
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,958
They're stonewalling us.

957
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:21,750
You have to help us.

00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,666
[door creaks]

959
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,958
Mom, are you coming?

960
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:31,583
Hey, honey. Yeah, I'll be in in a second.
Just wait inside, okay?

961
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:32,791
Okay.

962
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,291
[softly] Guys, I can't talk right now.
My kid's here. Like…

963
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:42,458
Okay. Here's my card.

964
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:46,375
Give me a call.
Maybe he's not who you think.

965
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:50,458
Have a nice day.

966
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:51,625

00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,458
[Amy] Hey.

971
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:21,583
- Do you need anything?
- Mm-mm.

972
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:23,125
- No?
- I'm fine.

973
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:26,250
Okay. You let me know if you feel tired.

974
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:27,875
I'm not. I will. I feel good.

975
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:29,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

976
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,125
- Okay.
- Mm.

- [Amy] I know. You look so good.

985
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,708
- Really?
- Yes! You look great.

- [server] Hi there! You ready to order?

988
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,958
- Oh, I'll have a cheese omelet.
- Okay.

989
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,625
- And what pairs best with that?
- Chardonnay.

990
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:43,166
Oh. A large cold glass of dry chardonnay.

991
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,375
- Okay.
- I'll have the same.

992
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:45,791
- Thanks.
- Coming right up.

993
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,083
When was the last time
we were in this dive?

994
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:50,833
A long time ago. Like, at least a decade.

995
01:00:50,916 --> 01:00:52,583
- What?
- Twelve years?

996
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,625
- Ugh, Jesus.
- [Amy chuckles]

997
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:56,625
- I'm getting old.
- [server] Here we go.

998
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:57,791
Thank you.

999
01:00:58,333 --> 01:00:59,375
How's Paul?

1000
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:01,541
Uh, we split up.

1001
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,791
- Oh shit.
- I mean, it's not a big deal.

1002
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:08,250
It was a long time ago,
and we share custody of the dogs.

1003
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:10,500
[Lori chuckles]

1004
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:14,375
We worked hard to come to that agreement.
I'm so glad that you called.

1005
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:17,083
Mm! Me too. [chuckles]

1006
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:19,375
Just, you know, I wanted to…
I wanted to ask you…

1007
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,708
It's… It's a little weird.

1008
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,875
I love weird.

1009
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:27,250
But, um… do you remember working
with someone named Charlie Cullen?

1010
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,625
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1011
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:34,041
Why?

1012
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:36,666
Well, I'm working with him
right now at Park field.

1013
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:41,666
There was a rumor about him.

1014
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,083
That he was responsible for a death.

1015
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,666
That he OD'd someone.

1016
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:51,416
Oh.

1017
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,208
Uh, with what?

1018
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:56,666
They found insulin
in the dead guy's saline bag.

1019
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,500
They found it in a few.

1020
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:01,000
Pinpricks in the ones in the store.

1021
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:04,250
Somebody had dosed them
before they went out.

1022
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,916
Why did they think it was Charlie?

1023
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,000
They didn't.

1024
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:15,375
But we used to get codes every night.
Sometimes two or three.

1025
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:16,958
And then after he left,

1026
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:20,833
we got, like, only one a month.

1027
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,333
[ominous music playing]

1028
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:30,541
You get a lot of codes?

1029
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,958
[running footsteps echoing]

1030
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,833
[ominous music building]

1031
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:56,791
[gasps]

1032
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,375
[footsteps recede]

1033
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,750
[panting]

1034
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,166
Okay.

1035
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:39,500
Oh God.

1036
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:03,750
[woman] Oh!

1037
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:22,041
[music fades]

1038
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,125
[machine beeping]

1039
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,833
[exhales]

1040
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,708
[groans softly]

1041
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,250
Hmm.

1042
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:09,291
[Charlie] Hey.

1043
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:12,083
[foreboding music playing]

1044
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:13,583
Easy, easy.

1045
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:16,500
You're okay. You're okay. It's okay.

1046
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,541
- Amy, it's okay.
- [beeping speeds up]

1047
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:23,708
You're in the ED. You're doing great.

1048
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:29,333
I checked on the girls.
Jackie's with them.

1049
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:32,291
I can go get 'em, bring 'em here.

1050
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:34,250
- [shudders] No.
- No? Okay.

1051
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,333
[machine beeping rapidly]

1052
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:42,916
You want some water?

1053
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:53,583
No?

1054
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:02,208
Don't you ever scare me
like that again please.

1055
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,166
- [wheezily] I wanna leave.
- [Charlie] I know, I know.

1056
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:06,625
I get it.

1057
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:08,875
We're not gonna let them find out.

1058
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:12,333
Where… Where's the nurse?

1059
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:15,458
Uh, don't worry.
Your last pressure looked pretty good.

1060
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:18,208
Your heart rate's been below 80
for the last hour.

1061
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:22,791
I saw the labs, and your troponin's high,
but it's trending down.

1062
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,625
So you're good. You're okay.

1063
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,791
You're lucky. Could've been a lot worse.

1064
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:32,250
- I wanna go home.
- I know.

1065
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:34,708
- Okay.
- [woman] Hey. Saw her heart rate blip up.

1066
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:36,375
- You awake?
- [Charlie] Yeah...

1067
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:38,166
Bring me a discharge form.

1068
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,791
Hey. I don't think that's a good idea.
She should stay overnight.

1069
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,916
- Yeah, we got this.
- I wanna leave AMA.

1070
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,083
- You sure?
- [beeping rapidly]

1071
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,875
I'll drive her home.
Make sure she's looked after. Thank you.

1072
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,125
- [long beep droning]
- [Charlie] We're good. Thank you.

1073
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:50,916
Hey.

1074
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,125
[beeping stops]

1075
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,208
- [Amy groans]
- Please, stop.

1076
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:57,750
[sniffs] Okay.

1077
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,291
Give me your arm.

1078
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,375
So you sure you don't want me to come in?

1079
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:25,541
I'm happy to sleep on the couch. I can…

1080
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:33,208
- I can take the girls to school.
- I don't wanna scare them.

1081
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:37,916
Nothing's gonna happen.
I just… I just need to sleep.

1082
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:40,291
- [parking brake clicks]
- You're right.

1083
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:43,541
- Thanks, Charlie.
- Yeah.

1084
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:45,333
[door handle rattles]

1085
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:48,458
But if you need anything…

1086
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I'll call you.

1087
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,041
Yeah?

1088
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,166
It's a month, Amy.

1089
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,041
We got this.

1090
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:11,416
You're freezing. Go.

1091
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:13,500
[Charlie strains]

1092
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:19,916
Call me.

1093
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:24,416
[eerie music playing]

1094
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,750
It has to be a secret.

1095
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:37,916
[inhales shakily]

1096
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:40,708
[exhales]

1097
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:43,791
[softly] Oh God.

1098
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,500
No one can know.

1099
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,333
I'll get fired.

1100
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,666
Understood.

1101
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:56,166
He does it in the storage room…

1102
01:08:57,958 --> 01:08:59,458
Before it even goes out.

1103
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,208
He injects the insulin into the bags,

1104
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:05,541
and because it enters
the bloodstream slowly,

1105
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:08,833
it could take hours
or even, you know, a day to kill someone.

1106
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,458
[exhales]

1107
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:14,750
So he's killing 'em
without ever touching 'em.

1108
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:18,291
Could he put something other than insulin
inside those bags?

1109
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:22,500
Yeah, any clear liquid
wouldn't be detected.

1110
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,458
Is digoxin a clear liquid?

1111
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:27,750
Yeah.

1112
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,250
[Braun] Could it kill someone?

1113
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,416
Okay, and the nurse you met with,
you think she'll talk to us?

1114
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,541
No.

1115
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,875
No, she'll lose her job.

1116
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:51,000
[Baldwin] Do you mind taking a look
at what we got here from Park field?

1117
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,666
Where's the rest of it?

1118
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:55,833
That's it. That's all we have.
That's all they gave us.

1119
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,666
The PYXIS report's just two pages.

1120
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:01,583
They said it only keeps the file
for four weeks.

1121
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:03,083
No, it's a computer.

1122
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,833
It keeps the information
for as long as it was installed. It's…

1123
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:20,375
I'll pull Charlie's PYXIS report
from the machine in my ward,

1124
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:24,250
and we'll use that to prove
that he withdrew insulin

1125
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,291
and digoxin when Ana died.

1126
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:30,000
Yeah, see, the problem is
that Ana Martinez was cremated,

1127
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:32,041
so we don't have an autopsy.

1128
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:35,416
What we need is an actual body.

1129
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,500
[ominous music playing]

1130
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:35,708
[air hissing]

1131
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:43,750
[machine buzzing]

1132
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:50,041
[machine beeping, whirring]

1133
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:06,166
[machine beeping more rapidly]

1134
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:33,625
[printer buzzing]

1135
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:47,458
[beeping]

1136
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:50,916
[Baldwin] As you know, we got permission
from Kelly Anderson's husband

1137
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,958
to dig up her body for examination.

1138
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:56,083
From the autopsy, we know
that a combination of insulin and digoxin

1139
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,958
were in Kelly's system
and led to her death

1140
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,541
in the early hours of the 15th.

1141
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:03,250
[Amy] Right,
and then on the 14th at 20:47,

1142
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:08,000
you see that Charlie took out
insulin and digoxin from the PYXIS.

1143
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:14,041
And if you see Kelly's report,

1144
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:17,208
her blood sugar just drops at 21:56,

1145
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,916
so that is the insulin taking effect.

1146
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:22,791
And there's slow arrhythmia at 22:15,

1147
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,000
and that's digoxin.

1148
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:29,458
So he was holding two murder weapons.
3:57 is the time of death.

1149
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:30,708
Everything's there.

1150
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:32,208
Wait a second. Hold on.

1151
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:37,041
With this PYXIS, it says cancellations,
not withdrawals.

1152
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:39,000
Well, it's a fault in the system.

1153
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:42,041
So when you cancel at the last minute,
the drawer opens,

1154
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:44,166
but it reports it as a cancellation.

1155
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,666
And Cullen knows about that?

1156
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:47,291
Yeah, and I saw him do it.

1157
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:50,583
Insulin, digoxin.
There's hundreds of orders here.

1158
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:55,166
Okay, but not according to this.
This makes it look like he never got 'em.

1159
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,166
But he did.

1160
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:59,666
Did you actually see him do this?

1161
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,291
[Baldwin groans]

1162
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:10,333
Guys, this is the smoking gun right here.

1163
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:12,791
Yeah, but this isn't.

1164
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:16,125
It's just cancellations.
There's nothing nefarious.

1165
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,208
There's no proof of guilt. There's...

1166
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:21,291
Okay, he's been doing this
since he started at Park field, so look.

1167
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:24,625
Look at all
of these repeated cancellations, right?

1168
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:28,125
Look. They're not followed up
with a correct order.

1169
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:31,875
He's had repeated orders
of vec and digoxin.

1170
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:35,333
I mean, it's really...
It just screams wrong. It's…

1171
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:39,083
Maybe. Maybe Park field
just didn't understand.

1172
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:42,625
Come on, guys.
Linda Garran used to be a nurse.

1173
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:44,958
She understood.

1174
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,791
Oh yeah, she knows,
and she's not doing anything.

1175
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:55,000
[door opens]

1176
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,625
[phones ringing in distance]

1177
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:01,083
[door closes]

1178
01:16:01,166 --> 01:16:03,750
[Garran] Nurse Cullen, thank you
for coming in on your day off.

1179
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:05,750
Hi, you can call me Charlie.

1180
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,250
[ominous music playing]

1181
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:16,083
Uh… We've come across something troubling.

1182
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
What hospital were you employed at
before you took the position here?

1183
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:25,750
St. Elizabeth's.

1184
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:29,166
And what were your dates
of employment there?

1185
01:16:29,791 --> 01:16:30,750
Uh…

1186
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:34,625
I'm not sure.
Is there an issue from St. Elizabeth's?

1187
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:39,416
'Cause I was targeted by some coworkers.
I don't know. Maybe they're at it again.

1188
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,833
What we're concerned with are the dates
you listed on your application.

1189
01:16:42,916 --> 01:16:44,791
Do you remember what they were?

1190
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,916
Um…

1191
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,583
June '01 to August '03, maybe.

1192
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:56,416
- Yes, that's what you wrote.
- Right.

1193
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,750
Those dates are incorrect, Mr. Cullen.

1194
01:16:58,833 --> 01:16:59,791
Oh.

1195
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:02,833
St. Elizabeth's confirmed with us
that you were employed from May,

1196
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:06,916
so these discrepancies
on your application form

1197
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,500
leave us with no option but to let you go

1198
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:11,875
with immediate effect.

1199
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:17,666
Wait, so you're firing me for writing
the wrong dates on my application?

1200
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:23,875
It… It is in the contract.

1201
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:35,958
Well, I believe I need to sign something.

1202
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:10,666
[Charlie sniffs]

1203
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:13,833
Is that all?

1204
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:15,750
That's all.

1205
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,333
Thank you, Mr. Cullen.

1206
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:28,041
[door opens]

1207
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:31,125
[door closes]

1208
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,250
[sighs]

1209
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,666
[door opens]

1210
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:56,833
[door closes]

1211
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:07,416
I just got news from Park field.
They've dealt with the Cullen issue.

1212
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,875
- What does that mean?
- He's been fired.

1213
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:13,583
- What?
- So they're just gonna let him go?

1214
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,750
Well, what did they say?

1215
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:19,708
That they fired him because they found
some discrepancy in his paperwork.

1216
01:19:20,916 --> 01:19:23,916
Well, what was his state of mind?
Was he stable?

1217
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,791
Wait, you don't think that this could
make him more dangerous, do you?

1218
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:31,375
At least he can't be
anywhere near patients.

1219
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,250
He can't hurt anyone.

1220
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:37,625
He's been at nine hospitals. Nine.

1221
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,458
What don't you understand?

1222
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:42,250
They all say the same thing.
They cover up their own liabilities.

1223
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:44,541
It happens again and again and again.

1224
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,750
He's gonna get a new job
at another hospital,

1225
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,291
and it's all gonna continue.

1226
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:51,208
You allowed this.

1227
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:54,000
[scoffs]

1228
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,166
Don't look at me.

1229
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:57,708
You did.

1230
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:04,000
[kids chat indistinctly]

1231
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:07,625
- Jackie, I'm back.
- [Alex] Maya.

1232
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:11,500
- [Maya] Oh my God!
- [Alex] Maya! Can you just say your line?

1233
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:12,666
Hey, girls.

1234
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,083
[Maya] I forgot it.

1235
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:18,500
Wow.

1236
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:20,083
[kids continue chatting]

1237
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,125
What?

1238
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:37,291
[Maya] Don't you have the script?

1239
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,541
- [Alex] I don't have the script.
- Oh my God.

1240
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:43,458
[Maya] Okay, I lost it.

1241
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:46,250
[Alex] Maya, you've done this
so many times!

1242
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:49,125
Okay, Alex, be nice to your sister.

1243
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:51,125
[Alex] Maya's speaking
over Charlie's part again.

1244
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,250
What are you doing here?

1245
01:20:56,291 --> 01:20:57,291
Rehearsing.

1246
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:00,250
Where's Jackie?

1247
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:03,791
I told her she could go home.
It was just gonna be us tonight.

1248
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:05,125
[Maya] We cooked!

1249
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:07,125
- We did.
- [Alex] Charlie cooked.

1250
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:08,875
- I helped.
- [Alex] No, you didn't.

1251
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,291
- [Maya] Yes, I did!
- No, you didn't.

1252
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:13,666
- Yes, I did!
- Alex, we all cooked.

1253
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,208
Why are you being weird, Mom?

1254
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:17,875
I'm not. [chuckles]

1255
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,458
- We're making something special.
- It's his mom's recipe.

1256
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:23,791
- Come.
- Yummy!

1257
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:27,458
Sit, relax.
Enjoy the "Mayor of Humdrum Falls."

1258
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:29,541
Should we get your mom
to play Mop Hopsley?

1259
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:30,541
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1260
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:31,833
Alex…

1261
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:35,083
Maya, please come here.

1262
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:40,333
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm asking you to. Come here.

1263
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,125
I don't want to.

1264
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,458
Hey, go to your mom.

1265
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:44,416
Get over here.

1266
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:47,375
Get over here right now!

1267
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:49,625
But why? I'm having fun.

1268
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:55,041
Go to your room. Go.

1269
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:57,458
[Maya] Why is she so angry?

1270
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,583
[Alex] I don't know.

1271
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:00,875
[door opens]

1272
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:03,791
[door closes]

1273
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,333
So I'm guessing you heard.

1274
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:10,583
Yeah.

1275
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:15,583
She say why?

1276
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:18,250
Mm-mm.

1277
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:26,958
They fired me because I wrote the wrong
dates on my application form apparently.

1278
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,250
Oh.

1279
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,625
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1280
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:37,875
[Charlie] It's been a wacko day.

1281
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,875
[laughs]

1282
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:44,541
It's been a wacko couple of months.
Actually it's… Ugh.

1283
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:49,041
You know, I wasn't even meant
to be working here.

1284
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:52,666
I took this job
because I wanted to be close to my kids.

1285
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:57,166
Then when I get here,
she won't even let me see them,

1286
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:01,958
and then she starts making up this
insane stuff about poisoning the dog,

1287
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:03,791
and then this, you know…

1288
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:14,916
I think the universe hates me, Amy.

1289
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:17,333
- Really.
- Charlie...

1290
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:20,458
- At this point.
- You know that's not true.

1291
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,416
I'm really sorry this happened to you.

1292
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:30,333
No, please. I'm sorry, 'cause I know
you've still got three more weeks,

1293
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:32,208
and I'm not gonna be there to help.

1294
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:33,958
But I can… I can help here.

1295
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:36,750
I can, like, look after them,
I can make sure you eat.

1296
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,083
Anything you need.

1297
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,625
Really. Anything.

1298
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,458
[sighs] That's all right.

1299
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:54,125
[sighs] Did I tell you
Alex blew up the other day?

1300
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:55,541
- No.
- Yeah.

1301
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:57,208
She just lost it.

1302
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,916
She was crying and screaming,
and, like… [exhales]

1303
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,541
She's really struggling.

1304
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:05,458
I'm working so much, so…

1305
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:08,958
I'm so sorry.
I mean, you know, it's a lot, you know?

1306
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:13,625
But what I think would be
really helpful to me is, um…

1307
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:17,000
If I could spend some time alone
with them, you know?

1308
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,583
Just me and the girls.

1309
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:25,833
And I feel really bad saying this to you,

1310
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:31,375
because I know that this has been
a day from hell for you.

1311
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:35,208
I mean, Charlie, honestly,
you've had the year from hell. [chuckles]

1312
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:36,166
No.

1313
01:24:36,958 --> 01:24:38,291
And, um…

1314
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:42,916
God, I wish I could be there for you.

1315
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,250
- I just feel like shit. I'm so sorry.
- No.

1316
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,791
Amy, stop. I get it. Please.

1317
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:53,625
It's… It's your kids. They need this.

1318
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,083
Yeah.

1319
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:00,333
And you're a good mom.

1320
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,916
- [chuckles weakly]
- No, look at me.

1321
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:07,750
You're a good mom.

1322
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:14,583
Mm.

1323
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:16,416
[chuckles, sniffs]

1324
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,875
- Okay.
- I'm glad I can help.

1325
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:21,416
[both chuckle]

1326
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:27,833
Promise me you'll eat.

1327
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,125
- It smells good.
- [chuckles]

1328
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:33,291
It's my mom's recipe, you know.

1329
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:35,916
- Okay.
- You know what?

1330
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,291
Just, actually, just, like, sitting here,
talking to you,

1331
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:40,875
being with you…

1332
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:44,875
It made me realize
everything's gonna be okay.

1333
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:46,041
I've got you.

1334
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:50,041
I got Maya and Alex. I got my girls.

1335
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:53,250
It's a job. I can get a job.

1336
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:56,416
You can.

1337
01:26:03,541 --> 01:26:04,541
[sniffs]

1338
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,166
Yeah.

1339
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:14,666
[chuckles]

1340
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,791
Night.

[distorted greeting]

1352
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:29,791
Charlie? Hey.

1353
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,416
[Charlie] <i>Oh, hey.</i>

1354
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,375
- I was, um...
<i>- You okay?</i>

1355
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:35,250
Yes! I…

1356
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,416
[sighs] You know, I wanna apologize

01:38:03,875 --> 01:38:07,291
My name is Detective Sergeant Tim Braun.
With me is Detective Dan Baldwin.

1531
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:09,958
Today is Saturday, December 13, 2003.

1532
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:13,666
The time is approximately 8:14 p.m.

1533
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:16,958
We're in the Major Crimes interview room
with Mr. Charles Cullen.

1534
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:19,958
Mr. Cullen, for the record,
could you please state your full name?

1535
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:22,416
Uh, Charles Cullen.

1536
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:24,791
[Braun] Could you spell that, please?

1537
01:38:24,875 --> 01:38:27,958
Uh, C-H-A-R-L-E-S

1538
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:29,833
C-U-L-L-E-N.

1539
01:38:29,916 --> 01:38:31,750
Is it okay if we call you Charlie, then?

1540
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:33,416
Yeah.

1541
01:38:34,458 --> 01:38:35,541
Okay.

1542

[sighs]

1543
01:38:44,916 --> 01:38:46,250
Okay, Charlie.

1544
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:52,541
Is there anything
you wanna tell us, Charlie?

1545
01:38:54,166 --> 01:38:55,708
Um…

1546
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:02,333
I mean, uh… I don't think so, no.

1547
01:39:03,125 --> 01:39:07,333
How many IV bags have you polluted
at Park field Memorial Hospital?

1548
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:16,916
We know you killed Kelly Anderson.

1549
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:20,750
We know you killed Ana Martinez.
We know there's others.

1550
01:39:22,708 --> 01:39:25,125
We just wanna talk about it
with you, Charlie.

1551
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,041
I can't. I'm not meant
to talk about patients

1552
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:30,833
without the hospital lawyers.

1553
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:33,541
You don't work there anymore.
You can say whatever you want.

1554
01:39:33,625 --> 01:39:35,416
[Braun] You're free to talk here.

1555
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:37,916
I can't, so…

1556
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:40,791
Why'd you kill 'em?

1557
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:46,041
Was it just women, Charlie?

1558
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:49,916
They remind you of your ex-wife maybe?

1559
01:39:50,416 --> 01:39:52,416
You know, that I could understand.

1560
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:56,250
Or your mother?

1561
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:05,375
I can't.

1562
01:40:06,458 --> 01:40:07,583
I can't.

1563
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,833
You know, the… the saline-bag stuff,

1564
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:17,000
that was… was pretty smart.

1565
01:40:17,791 --> 01:40:19,791
[Braun] That was very smart, Charlie.

1566
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:24,208
You know, I never seen anything like that.

1567
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:26,458
How'd you come up with that?

1568
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:27,625
[Charlie sniffles]

1569
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:34,708
[Baldwin] How many have you killed,
Charlie?

1570
01:40:36,625 --> 01:40:38,458
Ten, 11?

1571
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:46,000
Hey, Charlie, stick with me here, okay?

1572
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:50,208
Come on back, Charlie.

1573
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:53,166
Just gotta have this conversation, okay?
I know you can do it.

1574
01:40:56,208 --> 01:40:57,666
I can't…

1575
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:00,000
Charlie, can you look at me, please?

1576
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:02,291
Mm… I can't.

1577
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:03,833
- [Braun] Come on, Charlie.
- I can't.

1578
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:07,291
[Braun] You can. You gotta do this.
I know you can.

1579
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:10,875

I can't. I can't.

1582
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:18,333
I can't. I can't.

1583
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:19,416
- Charlie.

1584
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,250
- Charlie.
- I can't.

1585

- Charlie, you can.

1586

I can't, I can't, I can't.

1587

[Charlie breathes deeply]

1590
01:41:47,041 --> 01:41:47,958
All right.

1591
01:41:49,291 --> 01:41:51,666
[Baldwin] We've seen your Cerner,
we've seen your PYXIS,

1592
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:53,791
we've seen your orders,
we've seen the cancellations.

1593
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:55,041
We know all about it.

1594
01:41:55,541 --> 01:41:58,458
We know how you poisoned the bags
in the storeroom,

1595
01:41:58,541 --> 01:42:00,041
had the other nurses hang 'em up.

1596
01:42:02,791 --> 01:42:05,458
You know what?
I don't think you picked Kelly, did you?

1597
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:08,500
Did you?

1598
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:10,916
[Braun] You know
what I've been wondering?

1599
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,458
Now, I got no judgment. Charlie. Listen.

1600
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:14,875
- I can't.
- Hey.

1601

What happened?

1623

We're not gonna get it.

1624
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,791
He's not gonna break.
He's not gonna confess.

1626

Remember, you can't touch him.

Look, you're freezing. Here.

There was a… a man at my last hospital,

1699
01:52:54,416 --> 01:52:56,875
uh, he had a German name. I can't…

01:53:02,291 --> 01:53:03,291
Why?

1701
01:53:14,791 --> 01:53:16,291
They didn't stop me.

1702
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:12,208
[buzzer]

1703
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:15,625
[door opens]

1704
01:54:20,666 --> 01:54:22,000
[door closes]

1705
01:54:42,416 --> 01:54:44,416
[distant chatter echoing]

1706
01:54:57,666 --> 01:54:59,666
[water dripping]

1707
01:55:10,166 --> 01:55:11,750
[dog barking in distance]

1708
01:55:25,583 --> 01:55:26,666
[Amy] Mm.

1709
01:55:30,708 --> 01:55:31,833
Mm.

1710
01:55:35,666 --> 01:55:38,375
[whispers] We have to get up.
It's a school day.

1711
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:42,875
Not today.

1712
01:55:45,041 --> 01:55:46,750
Today we stay in bed.

1713
01:55:52,541 --> 01:55:56,625
[gentle music playing]
