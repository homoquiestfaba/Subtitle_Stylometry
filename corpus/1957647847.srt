Huh.

903
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:12,836
Jen comes home early
from the bar one night.

904
00:49:12,936 --> 00:49:15,473
Army's in the hot tub with two redheads.

905
00:49:15,572 --> 00:49:16,873
A mother-daughter deal.

906
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:19,210
Found 'em at Walgreens
in the sunscreen aisle.

907
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,011
Oh, that makes sense.

908
00:49:21,112 --> 00:49:23,314
About a week later,
Jen gets the cable bill.

909
00:49:23,414 --> 00:49:24,881
Super expensive.

910
00:49:24,981 --> 00:49:27,984
Apparently Army ordered
like 10 porn movies.

911
00:49:28,085 --> 00:49:31,556
"Ginger Snatch," "Nobody
Does It Redder," "Red Boss."

912
00:49:31,655 --> 00:49:33,056
But Jen's not a redhead.

913
00:49:33,157 --> 00:49:36,427
Actually, she is. She went
blonde after they split.

914
00:49:36,527 --> 00:49:38,028
- Really?
- Yup.

915
00:49:38,129 --> 00:49:40,997
Then Jen moved out a few days later,

916
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:44,601
and Army's never been the same since.

917
00:49:48,372 --> 00:49:50,575
[Gabe] Smoking will
let me prove to shorten

918
00:49:50,674 --> 00:49:53,610
the days in which you exist, Michael.

919
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,279
I know.

920
00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:56,880
I wish I never existed.

921
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,684
[Gabe] Nonsense. You are a young man.

922
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:04,589
You have a long and
fruitful life ahead of you.

923
00:50:04,688 --> 00:50:08,259
It doesn't matter. I'm gonna be alone.

924
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:10,194
Rich proposed to Jen.

925
00:50:11,061 --> 00:50:12,463
She said yes.

926
00:50:12,563 --> 00:50:14,764
She actually accepted.

927
00:50:14,865 --> 00:50:16,666
[Gabe] Apparently you don't know Jen

928
00:50:16,766 --> 00:50:19,102
as well as you think you do.

929
00:50:19,203 --> 00:50:20,971
Yeah, I guess not.

930
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:24,509
It doesn't matter anyway, though.

931
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:25,976
It's done.

932
00:50:26,076 --> 00:50:27,043
She's gone.

933
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:29,447
I'm fucked.

934
00:50:29,547 --> 00:50:31,282
[Gabe] Sometimes all a woman wants

935
00:50:31,382 --> 00:50:33,551
is to see you fight for her.

936
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:35,051
It gives her confidence that you want

937
00:50:35,153 --> 00:50:38,489
the relationship as much as she does.

938
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:41,325
Yeah, I guess that makes sense, huh?

939
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:43,660
[Gabe] Where's the
boy that left home alone

940
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,332
at 14 years of age to
pursue his hockey career?

941
00:50:48,432 --> 00:50:49,666
Right here.

942
00:50:49,766 --> 00:50:51,801
[Gabe] And where's the
young man everyone's said

943
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:56,274
was too small and too
slow to be successful?

944
00:50:56,374 --> 00:50:57,508
Right here.

945
00:50:57,608 --> 00:51:00,578
[Gabe] And where's the man
who worked his derriere off

946
00:51:00,677 --> 00:51:03,713
in order to prove everyone wrong?

947
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:05,116
Right here.

948
00:51:05,216 --> 00:51:06,683
[Gabe] Then go in there, Michael,

949
00:51:06,783 --> 00:51:08,486
and fight for what you want.

950
00:51:08,586 --> 00:51:11,021
You are your only obstacle.

951
00:51:11,122 --> 00:51:11,855
You're right.

952
00:51:11,955 --> 00:51:14,325
[Gabe] Ha-ha! Excelsior!

[patrons chattering]

954
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:25,369
Get you another water?

955
00:51:25,469 --> 00:51:26,703
No thanks.

956
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:33,377
Can I ask what you're doing
in a bar in your condition?

957
00:51:33,477 --> 00:51:35,446
Um, I'm running away.

958
00:51:36,913 --> 00:51:38,516
Running away?

959
00:51:38,616 --> 00:51:40,351
With my boyfriend.

960
00:51:41,552 --> 00:51:42,819
Why?

961
00:51:42,919 --> 00:51:45,423
My parents, they hate him.

962
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:51,728
Well, I would, too.

963
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:54,198
Can I ask how old you are?

964
00:51:54,298 --> 00:51:55,399
Um, I'm 16.

965
00:51:56,334 --> 00:51:58,502
16? You're just a kid.

966
00:51:58,603 --> 00:52:01,105
Now you sound just like my parents.

967
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,240
I'm sorry.

968
00:52:02,872 --> 00:52:05,509
Well, how old's your boyfriend?

969
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:08,212
Let me guess. He's 17.

970
00:52:08,312 --> 00:52:09,813
He's, he's 22.

971
00:52:10,581 --> 00:52:11,482
22?

972
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:14,818
Man.

973
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:16,019
Well, what does he do?

974
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,123
He works construction. Part-time.

975
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:21,992
Listen, it's none of my business,

976
00:52:22,092 --> 00:52:25,329
but you should really think
twice before running away

977
00:52:25,429 --> 00:52:30,301
with a 22-year-old part-time
construction worker.

978
00:52:30,401 --> 00:52:32,102
I mean, I was 22 once,

979
00:52:32,203 --> 00:52:35,071
and I know I wasn't
ready for a wife and kid.

980
00:52:35,172 --> 00:52:36,072
Shit.

981
00:52:36,773 --> 00:52:38,542
I'm still not ready.

982
00:52:41,178 --> 00:52:42,846
Well, where is he, anyway?

983
00:52:42,946 --> 00:52:45,716
I mean, you've been sitting
here for like two hours.

984
00:52:45,815 --> 00:52:48,519
He isn't answering his phone.

985
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:55,859
Look, I'll get you some
more water. You hungry?

986
00:52:55,959 --> 00:52:58,329
Maybe some crackers.

987
00:52:58,429 --> 00:52:59,896
All right.

988
00:52:59,996 --> 00:53:02,500
But think about what I said.

989
00:53:08,406 --> 00:53:10,675
So I met this blonde.

[laid-back hip-hop music]

991
00:53:13,611 --> 00:53:15,446
Her name was Bambi or

992
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:19,015
Bunny or something.

993
00:53:20,251 --> 00:53:22,886
She worked at a strip club.

994
00:53:24,854 --> 00:53:26,290
She was so hot.

995
00:53:27,191 --> 00:53:29,327
I paid for a lap dance.

996
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:35,199
Two songs in and I got my
hands where they don't belong.

997
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:38,034
Well, one thing leads to another,

998
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:42,573
and we're both drunk, so
we head back to her place.

999
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:47,844
She pounces on me as
soon as we get inside.

1000
00:53:48,612 --> 00:53:53,150
So we're making out and
our clothes hit the floor.

1001
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:58,088
We're butt-ass naked,
and she's grinding on me.

1002
00:53:58,922 --> 00:54:01,359
I think she was a squirter.

1003
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,228
I don't remember.

1004
00:54:05,028 --> 00:54:09,633
You know what I'm talking
about, right? [laughs]

1005
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:10,634
Anyway.

1006

I got whiskey dick,

1007

1012

I told you I'm on it.

gonna blow a gasket. Later.

come up with a good plan.
