1
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,400
<i>Just tell them that.</i>

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,760
<i>Tell them my reasons.</i>

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,480
<i>Tell them why.</i>

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,840
<i>End of tape four...</i>

5
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,960
<i>February 22, 1974.</i>

6
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,760
<i>Testing.</i>

7
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,600
<i>One, two, three.</i>

8
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,760
Mr. Maestro, Leonard Bernstein,
tape number one.

9
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,960
Mr. Bernstein...

10
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,520
I have the utmost respect for you.

11
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,920
Your music...

12
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,840
is both pure and honest.

13
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,560
And that is why I have chosen you...

14
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,680
to present the truth about me to the world.

15
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,320
My name is Sam Bicke.

16
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,280
And I consider myself a grain of sand.

17
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,960
On this beach called America...

18
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,480
there are 211 million grains of sand...

19
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,160
three billion on the beach we call Earth.

20
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,880
If I am lucky...

21
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,880
the action that I am about to take...

22
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,920
will show the powerful...

23
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,120
that even...

24
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,120
the least grain of sand...

25
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,440
has in him...

26
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,520
the power to destroy them.

27
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,520
These come in brown?

28
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
We do have that in a brown.
And a harvest gold. And an avocado.

29
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,280
Give me three of the brown and an avocado.

30
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,800
Are you interested in that chair?

31
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,640
This is a Naugahyde,
very good for avoiding stains.

32
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,760
I look like that big a slob?

33
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,000
I can't sit on this plastic stuff.
I get sweaty and stick to it.

34
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,920
This doesn't come in leather, huh?

35
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,160
Not this chair...

36
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,880
- Jack Jones.
- Bill Wilson.

37
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,880
Bill, what our new associate's trying
to explain, I think is...

38
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,480
that this is leather
with a Naugahyde coating.

39
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,520
Coating?

40
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,320
Exactly. Comfort of leather.
Just a little easier to clean.

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,960
No extra cost. How does it feel?

42
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,000
It is comfy.

43
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,440
- You know what you look like sitting there?
- What?

44
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,320
You look like the boss. Are you the boss?

45
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,680
I got my own place.

46
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
What did I tell you?
Did you write the gentleman up, Sam?

47
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,120
No, he didn't...

48
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,720
Write the gentleman up.

49
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Can we deliver this for you Monday,
or is Tuesday better?

50
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
Tuesday's probably better.

51
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,240
<i>Mr. Bernstein, sir...</i>

52
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,600
<i>there are times that I have felt alone
on this planet.</i>

53
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,720
<i>And that's how they want us, isn't it?</i>

54
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,760
<i>Alone. Divided. Weak.</i>

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,120
- To our new closer.
- Hear, hear.

56
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,520
You smell something? I do.

57
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,320
I smell success. And you've got the odor.

58
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,920
All right, Sam.

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,840
Why do I say that to you, Sam?

60
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,240
Well, I certainly am trying.

61
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,320
Got nothing to do with trying. It's believing.

62
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,400
When you believe in what you're selling,
you succeed.

63
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,520
Because then you're not selling.
You see what I'm saying?

64
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,880
You're talking from somewhere here.
You've got to believe.

65
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,880
It's a gift. I've got it.
Marty's got it. You may have it.

66
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,840
I can believe in anything.
Isn't that right, Marty?

67
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
It's true.

68
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,040
You want to know who
the greatest salesman in the world is?

69
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
That man, right there.

70
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,800
He sold the whole country,
200 million people...

71
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,480
on himself. Twice.

72
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,200
And what was Nixon's sales pitch in '68?

73
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,040
In '68, it was...

74
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,480
He said he would end the war.

75
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,720
He would get us out of Vietnam.
And what did he do?

76
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,080
He sent another 100,000 troops...

77
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
and then he bombed
the living shit out of them.

78
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,840
That's what he did.
Now, what did Nixon run on last year?

79
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,800
Ending the war in Vietnam. And he won.
By a landslide.

80
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,640
That is a salesman. He made a promise.
He didn't deliver.

81
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,160
And then he sold us
on the same exact promise.

82
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,080
All over again. That's believing in yourself.

83
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,160
These are for you. Read them.

84
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
These, you listen to.

85
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,480
While you're driving. While you're shaving.

86
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,400
While you're taking a shit in the morning.

87
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,040
You gotta believe, Sam.

88
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,160
This book right here will really teach you
to believe in yourself.

89
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,440
This book right here
will really teach you techniques.

90
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,760
These will make you a salesman.

91
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,440
I guarantee it.

92
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,440
<i>The salesman who believes
is the salesman who receives.</i>

93
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,040
<i>Remember, power is a state of mind.</i>

94
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,160
<i>You have as much as you think you have.</i>

95
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,280
<i>If you don't think you have any, you don't.</i>

96
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,920
<i>Talk about yourself as you see yourself.</i>

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,840
<i>And someday that will be yourself.</i>

98
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,640
<i>The salesman must see himself as a winner.</i>

99
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,160
<i>The salesman who believes
is the salesman who receives.</i>

100
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,880
- For crying out loud.
- Hi, Mel.

101
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,080
Did you see your brother?

102
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,240
- No.
- He just walked out, just now.

103
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,800
So, how's it going? What're you up to?

104
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,160
I just came by to give this.
This is what I owe him...

105
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,920
and if you could just get that to him for me,
I'd appreciate it.

106
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,480
Come on, Sam.
Julius felt bad how things turned out.

107
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,960
Why don't you stick around
till he gets back?

108
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
He didn't go home?

109
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,640
No. He just ran out to the bank.
He'll be right back. Sit down.

110
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,320
- I really got to go.
- Sit down.

111
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,080
I can't sit down, Mel,
but it's very good to see you.

112
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't be a stranger.

113
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,520
Look at you, man.

114
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,800
Look at that.

115
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,080
"Sam Bicke, Salesman." Damn.

116
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,720
You can keep that.
They made a thousand of them.

117
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,680
- A thousand?
- One thousand.

118
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,840
Man, they got big plans for you.
You look good, Sam.

119
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,240
I feel good. I believe.

120
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,960
Amen, brother. You've got to believe.

121
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,720
Sam Bicke, salesman.

122
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,200
I was just thinking
that I would go see Marie.

123
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,240
That I would surprise her because
I have a little extra for her this month.

124
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,800
All right, then.

125
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,200
You don't think it's a good idea.

126
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,960
You've got to know what's right, Sam.

127
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,760
Nobody thinks
that Sam Bicke is going to make it.

128
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
I didn't say that.

129
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,400
Hi, there.

130
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,560
How are my princesses?

131
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
- I got an A in Social Studies.
- You did?

132
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,920
That's great.

133
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,720
Go wash up, you two.

134
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,880
- Hi.
- Hey.

135
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,080
Looks good.

136
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,080
You can keep that.
They made a thousand of them.

137
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
- Thanks.
- It's good to see you.

138
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,360
You know you're supposed to call first.

139
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,840
I know.

140
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
What's this?

141
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,640
I'm on a roll.

142
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,160
That's great. Maybe I can get the roof fixed.

143
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,240
It's done. Paid for. Do it.

144
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,160
- Job's working out?
- Yeah.

145
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,920
Marie...

146
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,320
I really think that
this is gonna change things for us.

147
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,240
Sam, job sounds good.

148
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,280
I've got dinner on the stove.

149
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,240
Thanks.

150
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,640
I just wanted to have a little talk.

151
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,920
- Mommy, Julie's standing on the chair.
- Julie, come on, down.

152
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,720
I gotta get inside.

153
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,280
I'm sorry. Just call first. All right?

154
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,000
- When?
- I don't know. Try Sunday.

155
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,040
- After 10:00, though, all right?
- Okay.

156
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I'll call you Sunday after 10:00.

157
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,120
You look good.

158
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,800
Back to work.

159
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,600
Mommy.

160
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,680
Julie, come on.
Ellen, go get your brother, please.

161
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,320
You look nice, Marie.

162
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,800
Hey, Tuffer.

163
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,160
Hey, boy.

164
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,520
<i>Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
was 16,500,000 shares.</i>

165
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,840
<i>What happened, Mr. Bernstein,
to the land of plenty?</i>

166
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,120
<i>When there's plenty for the few,
and nothing for the plenty?</i>

167
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,440
<i>Is that the American dream?</i>

168
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,520
<i>Now remember,
the customer's weapon is money.</i>

169
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,840
<i>That's what he'll want to talk about.
Your weapon is quality.</i>

170
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,200
<i>That's what you'll insist on talking about.
Don't get caught in the price game.</i>

171
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,160
<i>You tell him how great it is.</i>

172
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,800
How much?

173
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,040
<i>This is a very high quality desk.
This one is 38 inches.</i>

174
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,880
How much is it?

175
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
<i>This is $529.</i>

176
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,520
I really believe in this desk.
I want to show you something. This is...

177
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,200
It's all right. I know pretty much
what to look for in a desk.

178
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,160
Sam, I'm gonna be buying a lot of stuff...

179
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,520
and I'm just wondering,
what's your best price?

180
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,680
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- All right.

181
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,080
Give it your best shot.

182
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,600
I'll do that.

183
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,960
Okey-dokey.

184
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,880
<i>What I can do is I can give you
10% off that desk, which is $476.</i>

185
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,200
Jesus! Sam, that's it?
That's your best price?

186
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,960
It's our selection of the month.

187
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,640
Excuse me. Can I see you
in my office for a minute please, Sam?

188
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,800
Yes, I'll be right...

189
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,160
I'll be right with you.

190
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,920
What are you doing?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

191
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,280
<i>Offering 10%?
Are you trying to give this stuff away?</i>

192
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,920
- You said...
- It's already been marked down.

193
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,520
For Christ's sake, that's less than we paid
for the damn thing.

194
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,160
You know I think
there's been a misunderstanding...

195
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm not interested in what you think.

196
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,440
I'm interested
in what you're gonna do about it.

197
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
I guess I could tell him...

198
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,240
You can't tell him shit.
You've made the offer.

199
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,040
That's it. Go out and hope he doesn't take it.

200
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,480
All right, Mr. Jones.

201
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,360
Sir, can I show you
some of our other very nice...

202
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,960
All right, then. Yes.

203
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,160
You looked like
you're gonna shit your pants.

204
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,040
You're on the board.

205
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,560
- You see him write that check?
- He did it to me, we do it to you.

206
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,400
Fifty-fifty all right with you?

207
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,400
- Sure.
- Good job, Sam.

208
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,360
It's not lying. It's business.

209
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,280
But it's not right.
I should have said something on the spot.

210
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,120
No, you shouldn't have.

211
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,720
What are you saying,
that I should swallow something like that?

212
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,920
It makes me sad that you would
accept something, of all people.

213
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,760
Sam, I'm just saying it's not that big a deal.

214
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,560
It is a big deal.
Bonny, if we're going to be partners...

215
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,000
we have to get this kind of thing straight.

216
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,800
Sam, I get it. Okay? I've been there.

217
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,840
But this guy's your boss.

218
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,520
If he wants to be an asshole,
you might just have to let him do.

219
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,840
- But, Bonny...
- There's no "but," Sam.

220
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,080
- What about my rights?
- You've got a right to be mad, sure.

221
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,120
Exactly. That's what I'm saying, partner.
That's all I'm saying.

222
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,280
Sam, it's a job.

223
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,080
This is what I mean.
A man doesn't give up his rights at a job.

224
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,280
A man doesn't give up his rights anywhere.
You of all people should know that.

225
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,560
What should I know? 'Cause I'm black,
I should mouth off to my boss?

226
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,520
All this rights shit. Rights this, rights that.

227
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
Rights, my ass. It's a job.

228
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,640
You got a right to pay your bills,
pay for your kids.

229
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,120
I'm just saying you can't keep quitting jobs.

230
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,200
We all gotta work somehow.

231
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,400
Come on. You're a salesman, right?

232
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Like you do.

233
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,800
<i>Explain this to me, Mr. Bernstein.</i>

234
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,640
<i>All I want
is a little piece of the American Dream.</i>

235
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,040
<i>Like my father and his father.</i>

236
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,880
<i>Is that too much to expect?</i>

237
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,560
Hey, Tuffer. Hey, boy.

238
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,720
You miss me, don't you?

239
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,840
Of course you miss me.

240
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,200
<i>This is a good country, Maestro.
Filled with good people.</i>

241
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,480
<i>But what good is good...</i>

242
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,160
<i>in times like these?</i>

243
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
I've been trying to call.

244
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,160
Double Scotch, Scotch and soda,
double bourbon.

245
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,360
It's not a good time, Sam.

246
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,160
Oh, no. I know. I just came to say hi.

247
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,080
- You want to see a menu?
- Yes, please.

248
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,560
- Here you go. I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

249
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,280
<i>... great change, at the same time.</i>

250
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,240
<i>One change is defense spending
is on the way down now.</i>

251
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,000
<i>For the first time in 20 years,
the Federal government is spending more...</i>

252
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,640
That's too much salt.

253
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,760
I know. Sorry.

254
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,160
How is it?

255
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,120
It is good. Remember Sam Jr.
Used to call these "mashapotos"?

256
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
That's right. Is everything okay at work?

257
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,440
Top of the charts. Top of the sales board.

258
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,200
I'm doing very well.

259
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,360
That's great.

260
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,320
Maybe I'll be driving a Cadillac soon.

261
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,080
He was a friend of yours?

262
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,200
Who?

263
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,120
The one with the Cadillac.
I drove by last night.

264
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,000
- Jesus, are you spying on me?
- No.

265
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,160
What you doing
lurking around the house for?

266
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
I wasn't lurking, Marie. I just...

267
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,760
You told me to call.
I called and nobody answered, so...

268
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,120
I said, try me, okay?

269
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,320
You know what?
I don't want to talk about this.

270
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
I respect that.

271
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,760
I just want you to know
I'm not seeing anyone.

272
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,200
Okay, that's your business.

273
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,240
It's important to me that you know that.

274
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,840
Fine. Now I know.

275
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,720
Table four wants their check.

276
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,760
I'm sorry. Okay? I didn't mean...

277
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,120
Can I call you later?

278
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,520
Look, if I get off at a decent hour,
I'll call you.

279
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,160
- All right?
- All right.

280
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,360
<i>Mr. Bernstein, sir, there are people
who sit and wait their lives away...</i>

281
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,720
<i>on the promise of a dream
that will not come.</i>

282
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,320
<i>They are the sheep.</i>

283
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,800
<i>We have a great deal to be thankful for
as Americans tonight.</i>

284
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,760
<i>You've chosen El Dorado,
with front wheel drive. It's our most...</i>

285
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,760
<i>But there are also
many more like us, Maestro...</i>

286
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,040
<i>- who will not be pushed around.
- The time has come when the masses...</i>

287
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,600
<i>... have been pushed to the wall.</i>

288
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,080
<i>When they cannot any longer
address their grievances through the legal...</i>

289
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,880
<i>political machinery of this country.</i>

290
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,560
<i>We're not the decision-makers,
the masses are.</i>

291
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,760
<i>If they think it's time to overthrow
the system, there's nothing you...</i>

292
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,560
or anyone else can do.

293
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,200
Hi. I'm Sam Bicke.

294
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,400
Harold.

295
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,840
- How are you?
- Yeah.

296
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,880
Are you with the police?

297
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm not police. I'm Sam Bicke.

298
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,240
Yeah, I got that. What can I do for you?

299
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,000
As a matter of fact...

300
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,680
I've seen you on television.
I mean, the Panthers on television...

301
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,920
and I'm in complete agreement
with your stand.

302
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,280
Except that I'm white.

303
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,920
We've all got to be born something.

304
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,320
Do you know what that means?

305
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,000
It means you're not getting
to your whole audience.

306
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,160
I mean, I'm white, but I'm in the same boat.

307
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,400
You own the boat.

308
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,960
No, I don't own the boat.
I'm not the man in the Cadillac.

309
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,480
That's not me.

310
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,240
May I?

311
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,760
- Harold.
- Yes.

312
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,280
I feel like I can talk to you.
I sort of knew it would be like that.

313
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,080
I know what it's like to not be respected,
and be lied to...

314
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,680
and be treated like a great, big nothing.

315
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,800
And I want to do something.

316
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,800
You want to do something?

317
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,560
Like the Black Panthers,
I want to do something...

318
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,800
The system is not right.

319
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,600
I have to go,
but I want to throw an idea at you.

320
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,480
Zebras.

321
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,640
Zebras?

322
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,880
See, they're black and they're white.

323
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,280
The Black Panthers become the Zebras...

324
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
and membership will double.

325
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,560
I don't want you to answer me right now.
Just think about it.

326
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,480
<i>This is $107.</i>

327
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,280
I wanted to feel
like I was starting to do something.

328
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,760
Sam.
It's a great start.

329
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,520
Take a look.

330
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,840
- You see what I see?
- What's that?

331
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,600
You're familiar with Carnegie, right?

332
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,240
I gave it to you.

333
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,920
<i>Dale Carnegie.
How to Win Friends and Influence People.</i>

334
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,720
Oh, yes. I know the book.

335
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,760
No, you don't.

336
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,680
You've seen the book.

337
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,360
Maybe browsed through it.
But you don't know the book.

338
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,120
If you knew the book,
you'd know what I mean when I say...

339
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,360
"Always give a dog a good name."

340
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,680
Always give a dog a name.

341
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,240
A good name. Damn it.
You've really got to listen better.

342
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,600
You're right. I'm sorry.

343
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,480
It's a Carnegie technique
for dealing with people.

344
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,440
When somebody's performance isn't good,
you don't criticize them.

345
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,520
You don't say, "Your work's shit."
Right? Instead you say:

346
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,280
"Your work used to be great,
now it's not so great."

347
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,720
And then you ask them a question like:

348
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,080
"Everything okay at home?"

349
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,160
Are you asking me?

350
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,280
I'm teaching you.
You just learned a management technique.

351
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,200
Don't mind me teaching you, do you?

352
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,040
Sir.
- Good. Just one more little thing.

353
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,200
But, Marie, he wants me to cut it.

354
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,080
It's a job, Sam. Shave it off.
You'll forget you ever had a mustache.

355
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,920
I won't forget. I'll never forget.
Marie, don't you remember?

356
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,520
Remember what?

357
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,600
Daddy, do you like my picture?

358
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,920
Yes, honey, it's very nice.

359
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,520
I grew it for you.

360
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,160
Sam, please.

361
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,200
Mom!

362
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,160
You've got to see these people,
they just lie to make money.

363
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
And then, I'm the sleazy one
of these so-called businessmen.

364
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
God damn it.

365
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,480
I mean they don't have any right...

366
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,040
to say half of the things that they say to us.

367
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,840
I mean, look at the way
they make you dress.

368
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,880
I dress like this so I can support my family.

369
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,480
Can't you see what they're doing to us?

370
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,840
You're going to lose this job, aren't you?

371
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,200
What? I'm not going to lose my job.

372
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Just tell me now,
because I can do it on my own.

373
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,560
I'm doing great.

374
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm so tired of this.

375
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,040
I don't want you
stopping by like this anymore.

376
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,440
I really mean it.

377
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,480
I think it looks good.

378
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,680
And it makes me look
a little older and trustworthy.

379
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,320
You would trust me.

380
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,480
That's not really the point, though.
What I'm saying is...

381
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,640
I'm surprised you would say that, Bonny.
I really am.

382
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,160
Because I would think
that you would have more feeling.

383
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,640
Joey, let's get some of these dishes cleared
and get you to bed.

384
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,000
No. You sit.

385
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,280
Joey.

386
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,360
Yes, ma'am.

387
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,160
That's a good kid. That's a real good kid.

388
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,720
His mother taught him well.

389
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,160
I bet she did.

390
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,080
No offense, but I wouldn't be surprised...

391
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,040
if his father had a little something
to do with that.

392
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,160
He probably got something from me.

393
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,840
What do you think?
If your father went away...

394
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,000
would that make you sad?

395
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,520
He's not gonna go away.

396
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,520
Of course he's not. If he did?

397
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,120
If your mommy wanted him to go.

398
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,640
She wouldn't say that.

399
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,560
Why don't you just leave those there.

400
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,240
It's past your bedtime.
Give your father a kiss.

401
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, baby.

402
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,440
Things will work out, Sam. You'll see.

403
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,280
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, baby.

404
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,400
Say good night to your Uncle Sam.

405
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,520
Good night, Uncle Sam.

406
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,440
Good night, son.

407
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,400
I know it was important to you, Sam.
I want to thank you for the sacrifice.

408
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,560
I think it was a good decision.
Now you can smile.

409
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,240
You look like a family man instead of
some schmuck with a pussy on his face.

410
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,240
- Marty?
- Yes.

411
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,000
Get up to the spic's place
and get me an egg salad...

412
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,240
and whatever else you want.

413
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,640
<i>Is independence too much to ask,
Mr. Bernstein?</i>

414
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,000
<i>I mean, you're your own boss, right?</i>

415
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,360
<i>You don't have any idea what it's like
to work for somebody else...</i>

416
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,360
<i>like some kind of a slave.</i>

417
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,920
<i>But I'm telling you,
slavery never really ended in this country.</i>

418
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,640
<i>They just gave it another name. Employee.</i>

419
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,120
<i>Remember power is a state of mind.</i>

420
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,320
<i>You have as much as you think you have.</i>

421
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,200
<i>If you don't think you have any, you don't.</i>

422
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,720
<i>Talk about yourself as you see yourself...</i>

423
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,000
<i>and someday that will be yourself.</i>

424
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,040
<i>The salesman must see himself as a winner.</i>

425
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,000
<i>Say it along with me.</i>

426
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm not sure I understand this business
about the school bus.

427
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,400
That's just it. The bus is the business.

428
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,960
It's a movable store.

429
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
- A movable tire store?
- Exactly.

430
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,680
You see, we take out all of the seats,
just gut the whole bus...

431
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,400
and put the tires. Fill it up with the tires.

432
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,200
Then you bring the tires to the customer,
at his convenience.

433
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,400
You're a delivery service.

434
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,520
That's just the beginning of it,
because I would bring the tire...

435
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,440
and change it, I'll put the tire
on your car while you're mowing the lawn.

436
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,120
Or anything else that that you want to do.

437
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,840
And we'd paint the bus a bright red
because that would give the company...

438
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,000
its own individual identity
and make it memorable. A sort of trademark.

439
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,080
And you have the bus already?

440
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,760
My friend, my partner, Bonny,
has the bus and he has the tools.

441
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,000
And I bring the management experience.

442
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,720
And that you have as well?

443
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,600
That I do, sir. Yes, I do.

444
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,800
It says here you're currently employed
as an office furniture salesman?

445
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,720
That's correct. But I'm ready to move on.

446
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,560
And prior to office sales,
you were a tire salesman with your father?

447
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,800
Julius Bicke, that's my brother.

448
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,920
Brother. Okay,
and why did you leave his employment?

449
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,760
He expected me to lie.

450
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,720
I don't believe that someone
should have to lie to make a living.

451
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
All right.

452
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,720
Over and over he would tell me...

453
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,800
<i>that 15% is rock bottom.</i>

454
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,520
Sell below that, we lose money. That's a lie.

455
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,000
<i>In the retail tire business,
the markup is always at least 30%.</i>

456
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,920
<i>So, 30 is rock bottom.</i>

457
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,280
What one should tell the customer...
Let me show you.

458
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,400
Good morning, Mr. Ford.

459
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,400
I think I understand, Mr. Bicke...

460
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,320
Let me just show you.

461
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,000
Good morning. Sam Bicke.
You're here to buy tires.

462
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,880
Yes.

463
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,400
Let's get down to brass tacks.
This is the deal.

464
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,960
<i>The markup on all of my tires is 30%.</i>

465
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,920
I will show you the company invoice
to prove that to you.

466
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,200
I'll do that for you, Mr. Ford.
I'll make you my best offer.

467
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,120
I'll split the difference with you.
I'll take half the markup as my profit...

468
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,880
and you'll take half the markup
as your savings.

469
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,440
Even Steven. Fair deal.

470
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,760
What do you think?

471
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,000
What do I think? Or...

472
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,200
Yes. No, I'm back to normal now.

473
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,960
<i>- It's 15%.
- Exactly.</i>

474
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,080
But it's the same thing,
what your brother offered.

475
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,400
No. My brother...

476
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,440
<i>will go to 15%,
but he wants you to hold at list.</i>

477
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,840
<i>5% if you have to...</i>

478
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,680
<i>10% if you're gonna lose the customer
out the door.</i>

479
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,400
<i>But the salesman who offers 15%,
he's a failure.</i>

480
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,920
He's a man who doesn't know
how to hold his ground.

481
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,800
And who do you think,
at the end of the month...

482
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,880
gets the promotion, gets the bonus?

483
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,360
The one with the biggest profit margin?

484
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,760
The biggest liar.

485
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,720
I'm sorry.

486
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,000
I just want you to know that I would run
an honest business.

487
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,840
That I would not ask my salesmen to lie...

488
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,560
or make them feel like a failure...

489
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,280
or some kind of a piece of garbage.

490
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,960
Well, that's...

491
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,720
I admire that.

492
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,920
- Your idea?
- Yes, sir.

493
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,640
Well, that's it.

494
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,920
That's it?

495
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,840
Mr. Ford, I want to thank you, sir,
because this loan isn't just for me.

496
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,160
I think it can change
the way we think about American business.

497
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,120
Mr. Bicke, I'm really very sorry.

498
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,880
That's it for now. I have to send
your application on to Washington...

499
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,360
and they will review it.
And it's a whole process.

500
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,360
Of course.

501
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,400
Mr. Ford at the SBA...

502
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,920
Bonny, I gotta tell you,
he was very impressed.

503
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,080
Did you tell him the bus don't run?

504
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,520
I didn't.

505
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,840
Did you tell him your partner was black?

506
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,840
I did, yes. I checked the "Negro" box.

507
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,240
That was stupid, Sam. This isn't working.

508
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,040
No, Bonny.

509
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,800
The government is looking
for black businessmen.

510
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,480
I've been here 16 years,
and they haven't found me yet.

511
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,040
Ellen, sit next to Julie. Sam. Come on, son.

512
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,760
Ellen, can you just sit. That's great, Julie.

513
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,840
Ellen, sit next to your sister.
Come on, Sam Jr.

514
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,120
Ellen, honey, sit next to Julie.

515
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,720
Come on, you guys. Dinner's ready.

516
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,800
Daddy's taking a picture.

517
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
That's all right, honey, I got it.

518
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,400
- See you next Sunday, Sam.
- Yeah, I'll see you next Sunday.

519
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,600
Tuffer! No.

520
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,200
<i>$125 is your total. I let the tax slide.</i>

521
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Thank you.

522
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,200
You remind me of my ex-wife.

523
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,240
She's got the dimples, also,
when she smiles. They're nice.

524
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,720
Compliments and a good deal.
I should shop here more often.

525
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,760
You should, miss, or is it missus?

526
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,520
Miss.

527
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,320
- Is this the current phone?
- Yes.

528
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,360
Would you like me to deliver it?

529
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,480
No. That's all right.
I'll have someone from the office stop by.

530
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,480
It wouldn't be a problem.

531
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,960
I'll be just fine.

532
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,080
You already are.

533
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,120
I don't want you to deliver it.
I'll have it picked up.

534
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,320
I didn't mean me, personally.
We have people who deliver.

535
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,440
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

536
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,640
I love my wife very much.

537
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,640
We are all married men. Family men.

538
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,960
Yeah.

539
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Because...

540
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,320
what's odd about your aborted flirtation
with that woman today...

541
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,760
according to Marty's recollection,
correct me if I'm wrong...

542
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,120
is that you referred to her dimples...

543
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,520
as being like those of your ex-wife's.

544
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,400
- I don't think I did that.
- He sure did.

545
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,440
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

546
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,680
As I told you when I took you on...

547
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,400
I only hire married men.

548
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,120
A single salesman is distracted.

549
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,280
A divorced salesman fails at selling,
the same as marriage.

550
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,040
It's all right for a guy to...

551
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,800
lie to some broad
about not being married when he is.

552
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,280
That's fine. That's to be expected.

553
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,160
But you wouldn't expect that guy
to lie to his boss, would you?

554
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,280
I guess I did try to pick up on that woman.

555
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,600
I didn't want you to think
that I was being dishonest to my wife.

556
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,800
You did try to pick her up then?

557
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,840
Yes.

558
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,320
My son was correct
in his estimation of your character?

559
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,640
Yes.

560
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,360
And if I were to ask
you and your wife to join...

561
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,760
me and Marty and our wives for dinner
in, say, a week or two...

562
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,240
that would be okay with you?

563
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,560
Yes, I think that...

564
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,320
she'd like that very much.

565
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,120
<i>When I was little I was taught
not to be rude, Mr. Bernstein, but...</i>

566
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,680
<i>what am I supposed to do
about the people who won't respect me?</i>

567
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,080
What I wanted to do is just check
on the status of my application.

568
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,200
Sorry, Mr. Bicke.

569
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,960
Mr. Ford should have told you,
but processing takes eight to ten weeks.

570
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,320
No, he did not tell me that.

571
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,280
Perhaps you could check back,
say, September 1.

572
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,200
- September?
- Yes.

573
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,120
I do understand your position.

574
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,840
I'm sure that you deal
with a lot of incompetence.

575
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,000
But I am a businessman...

576
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,240
and a businessman can't wait.

577
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,440
If you gonna have a future,
you gotta make it.

578
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,360
So I would really appreciate it
if I could see Mr. Ford.

579
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,880
What was your first name?

580
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,280
Samuel J.

581
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,240
I will talk to Mr. Ford...

582
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,560
and if he has time for a meeting,
we'll call you next week.

583
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,960
Since I'm here, maybe I could just see him...

584
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,760
If he has time,
we'll call you next week. Deal?

585
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,720
Deal.

586
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,000
Least you could do is discourage him.

587
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,240
Double bourbon and a vodka martini up.

588
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,920
It would help if you wore your wedding ring.

589
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,360
For God's sake, Sam, aren't we done yet?

590
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,720
Would you consider going to the dinner?
You could drive your own car.

591
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm not gonna put on some charade.
If you're their top salesman...

592
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,040
what do they care
if you're married, divorced, or queer?

593
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,600
Sir, you should be ashamed of yourself.
That woman is my wife.

594
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,600
They make her wear that.

595
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,120
Sam.

596
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,360
Really, it's all right.
I'll just wait here. I'm fine here.

597
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,000
Mr. Bicke, please...

598
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,120
He'll understand. He'll leave at some point
and he'll be going to his car.

599
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,040
He'll leave at some point,
I'll walk him down. That's all the time...

600
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,360
- Mr. Bicke.
- Mr. Ford.

601
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,320
It's good to see you, sir.

602
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,560
Why don't we step outside
and get a cup of coffee? How's that?

603
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,400
Coffee. In the cafeteria.

604
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,120
Actually, there's a machine in the lobby.

605
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,600
The lobby's fine.

606
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,520
Have a seat.

607
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,240
Now, how exactly can I help you, Mr. Bicke?

608
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,040
Yes, well, sir...

609
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:00,120
Funnily enough, my situation is
that I really...

610
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,320
It's very urgent that I get this thing rolling,
if you know what I mean.

611
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,840
No, I don't.

612
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,480
The bus thing. The tire thing.

613
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,680
Yes, I remember your application
and I sent it along.

614
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,960
Now there's really nothing more I can do.

615
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,960
You can't tell me anything else?

616
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,400
No, I can't.

617
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,560
I told you in our meeting,
and I believe you were told again...

618
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,400
that the process will take eight to ten weeks.
You'll be notified by mail.

619
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,200
You can't expedite that?

620
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,000
It will take eight to ten weeks
and you'll be notified by mail.

621
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,800
Now, I have to get back.

622
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,680
Is there some way
that this could be speeded up?

623
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,400
Is there some way that could happen?

624
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,120
No, there isn't. And if you come back again,
I will have to add that to your file.

625
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,680
Impatience is not a virtue, Mr. Bicke.

626
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,720
Okay. Good luck.

627
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,720
In the mail then?

628
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,600
Yes.

629
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,120
<i>A nation, like a person, has to have
a certain inner drive in order to succeed.</i>

630
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,400
<i>In economic affairs that inner drive
is called a competitive spirit.</i>

631
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,120
<i>Whether this nation stays number one
in the world's economy...</i>

632
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,240
<i>... over 40 rounds from the hotel's rooftop.
The sniper, former Navy seaman...</i>

633
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,440
<i>Mark Jimmy Essex,
had testified in his court- martial...</i>

634
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,600
<i>For his part,
Allende vowed he would not give in.</i>

635
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,280
<i>He would not, he said, "Betray
the working classes." In the end he found...</i>

636
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,080
<i>Who are these men, Maestro...</i>

637
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,360
<i>who keep us waiting at their feet?</i>

638
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,280
<i>The meek shall not inherit the earth.</i>

639
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,960
<i>The earth belongs to the bullies
who do not care how they get to the top...</i>

640
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,040
<i>as long as they arrive.</i>

641
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,120
<i>I am an honest man, and if that
is to be my undoing, then so be it.</i>

642
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,280
<i>But I will not go quietly.</i>

643
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,800
You've just got to have
a little more patience.

644
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,720
It's all about money.

645
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,840
It ain't all about money.

646
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,440
Now what?

647
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,600
- You got a problem?
- Yeah, I got a problem.

648
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,960
I paid you to fix the leak.

649
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,800
- You've still got one?
- I've got half-a-fucking-dozen of them.

650
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,640
What kind of rip-off joint
you running here, anyhow?

651
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,080
- You sound like you're having a bad day.
- I'm having a bad day with this fucking car.

652
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,480
- You have a nice day, now.
- Yeah.

653
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,040
What is the matter with you?
This thing is loaded.

654
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,600
Nobody should talk to another person
like that.

655
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,800
So you start swinging
this fucking thing around?

656
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,880
- You out of your mind?
- He didn't respect you.

657
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,480
So what? You think I'm losing sleep
over that bullshit?

658
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,760
But how can you take that racist crap?

659
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,880
Just because I didn't cuss his ass out
doesn't mean I took shit off of him.

660
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,200
All I took off of him
was the money that he owed me.

661
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,280
And I sure as shit ain't some Uncle Tom,
if that's what you're trying to say.

662
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,680
Are we clear on that?

663
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,480
Yes, we're clear.

664
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,800
Jesus Christ!

665
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:47,400
I didn't mean you were a Tom.
I didn't mean that.

666
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,360
I'm so sorry, Bonny.

667
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,760
Are we still friends?

668
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,720
Yeah, we're friends.

669
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,240
<i>Last night near the site of that massacre,
some 200 Indians...</i>

670
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,720
<i>took control of two buildings
on the Pine Ridge Sioux reservation.</i>

671
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,040
<i>The Indians attacked at midnight...</i>

672
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,000
<i>fully aware of the clich
that Indians don't fight at night.</i>

673
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,640
<i>We have bet our lives
that we can make change...</i>

674
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,800
<i>for the American Indian,
whether we live or die.</i>

675
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,200
<i>And I'm prepared to die.
I would rather die than submit to slavery.</i>

676
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,520
<i>... Internal Security Division
of the Justice Department of the FBI...</i>

677
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,840
And I apologize, Ma.

678
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,920
She's your daughter, but she's my wife
and you have to tell me where Marie is.

679
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,160
Okay. Mrs. Anderson, where is Marie?

680
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,640
Then I'll just have to keep calling.

681
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,480
<i>9082. Thank you.</i>

682
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,960
Marie Bicke, please.

683
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,280
Yes, I know exactly what time it is.

684
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,280
<i>It's 3:27 in the morning
and I demand to speak to my wife.</i>

685
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,880
That's right, this is Sam Bicke,
and who is this?

686
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,360
Who is this, sir?

687
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,400
Marie?

688
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,800
Wait. No, you hold on.

689
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,640
Marie, I got a divorce decree today...

690
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,920
and we're supposed to be separated,
we're supposed to be working on this.

691
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,280
It's only been one year.

692
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,560
It certainly has not been two years.

693
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,080
No, it has not been almost two!

694
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,680
I have a life. Why would you say that, Marie?

695
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,880
When you're... Marie?

696
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,680
God damn it!

697
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,440
<i>I could stand here before this audience,
and make all kinds of excuses...</i>

698
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,120
I appreciate all the time you've taken.

699
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,720
I have spent a lot of time, but it's okay
because I know you're gonna be happy.

700
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,960
I need to measure the space.

701
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:52,160
So we can deliver it this afternoon,
or is Saturday better?

702
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,960
As I said before,
I have to still measure the space.

703
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,960
I'll have the boys come over.
They can measure the space.

704
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,080
You're not gonna
let me down, are you, Stan?

705
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,400
This doesn't have to be done today
because we'll be here in the morning.

706
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,560
Turn that down.

707
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,040
God damn it!

708
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,920
What did you just do?
You out of your fucking mind?

709
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,720
Actually, I have some bad news
because I'm not going to...

710
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,960
This is my last day.

711
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,280
- What?
- Actually...

712
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,480
I'm not going to be able
to finish today because...

713
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,280
I have a very important letter
that's coming in.

714
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,160
I'm starting my own business...

715
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,640
and I have an enormous amount of plans
that I have to make.

716
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,960
Have your desk cleared in 10 minutes.

717
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,080
All right.

718
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,520
<i>... 'cause people have got to know
whether or not their president is a crook.</i>

719
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,000
<i>Well, I'm not a crook.
I've earned everything I've got.</i>

720
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,960
<i>I sold all my stocks for $300,000.
It's all I owned.</i>

721
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,120
<i>I sold my apartment in New York...</i>

722
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,920
It's about money, Dick.

723
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,240
<i>... and the testimony you gave us last week...</i>

724
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,960
<i>was that you had dispersed some $69,000...</i>

725
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,040
<i>in what you might call a sabotage program.</i>

726
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,880
<i>And that you also perjured yourself
at the trial...</i>

727
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,760
<i>at Mr. Magruder's request.</i>

728
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,720
<i>Would you explain to the committee
how you dispersed the $69,000?</i>

729
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,080
<i>I don't think that was gone into
with much detail.</i>

730
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,400
Roger Zeffler, please.
Sam Bicke, Bicke Tires.

731
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,400
<i>Speaking to Haldeman and Ehrlichman
I said "The boil had to be pricked."</i>

732
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,760
No.

733
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,680
<i>... prick the boil and take the heat.</i>

734
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,360
You're the prick.

735
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,880
Hello, Roger. No, I wasn't saying that.
This is Sam Bicke.

736
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,880
Yes, that's right, Julius' brother.

737
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,240
As a matter of fact,
I'm back with Julius now.

738
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,320
I'm handling shipping and receiving
for him. I have a purchase order that...

739
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,480
<i>we sent in a couple of days ago.
It's number 3765.</i>

740
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,800
Well, it is a lot of tires.
We're opening an outlet in the Hill district.

741
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,960
Black people have to have tires, too, Roger.

742
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,280
Yes, that's the correct address. If you could
just drop-ship those, that would be fine.

743
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,520
Monday's fine.

744
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,120
<i>The operation they're talking about
is the burglary of the Watergate.</i>

745
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,160
<i>That's correct, sir.</i>

746
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,720
<i>Mr. Magruder, just one very brief question.</i>

747
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,800
<i>Did John Dean prepare you
for your grand jury?</i>

748
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,360
<i>... by making their lives better at home,
for themselves and their children.</i>

749
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,000
<i>That key is in your hands.
Every action I have taken tonight...</i>

750
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,640
<i>is designed to help us
snap out of this self-doubt...</i>

751
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,720
<i>this self-disparagement
that saps our energy.</i>

752
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,160
<i>She declared
it was all part of the national plan...</i>

753
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,600
<i>to bring an end to the Black Panther party.</i>

754
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,360
Darn it.

755
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,400
<i>I want the American people...</i>

756
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,400
<i>I want you to know
beyond the shadow of a doubt...</i>

757
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,560
<i>that during my term as president...</i>

758
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,200
<i>justice will be pursued fairly, fully...</i>

759
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,960
<i>Please let them know, Maestro...</i>

760
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,440
<i>let them know I was nervous...</i>

761
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,880
<i>that unlike the powerful,
I was not so arrogant...</i>

762
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,560
<i>as to be sure that my actions
were righteous.</i>

763
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,080
<i>Certainty is the disease of kings, Maestro.</i>

764
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:29,200
<i>And Sam Bicke was many things,
but not a king.</i>

765
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,560
<i>He just wanted to make a change.
To stop the lies.</i>

766
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,000
<i>And he aimed high.</i>

767
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,280
Hello, Samuel.

768
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,840
The landlord was kind enough
to allow me in.

769
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,080
He stopped by. I see you received his note.

770
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,880
Julius.

771
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,600
We have some things to discuss,
don't you think?

772
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:18,960
To discuss?

773
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,840
- Good seeing you, of course.
- Cut the crap. Sit down.

774
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,760
You're a very strange man, Samuel.

775
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:46,320
I've always known this.
I've always tried to help.

776
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,920
So why would you steal from me,
your brother?

777
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,040
- I didn't steal...
- You did.

778
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,240
I had to bail your friend, Bonny,
out of jail this evening.

779
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,480
Bonny?

780
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,840
For receiving stolen goods. My goods.

781
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,000
Did you think Roger Zeffler wouldn't
become suspicious of your friend?

782
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:19,320
<i>That somehow this delivery was kosher?
That 550 tires belonged to that address?</i>

783
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,440
Roger Zeffler is a racist.

784
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:32,400
Perhaps that's so. Shame on Roger Zeffler.
But you are a crook.

785
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,640
So, you tell me, Sam.
Which shame is greater?

786
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,400
- I am not...
- Look at me.

787
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,680
This is your brother.

788
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,920
Do I deserve this now, for you to lie to me?

789
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,480
Julius, please.

790
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,360
No. No "please, Julius". No!

791
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,120
I have been to the police.

792
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,560
Begging forgiveness for a mistake
that was not a mistake.

793
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,200
Because I took responsibility, Samuel.

794
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,880
So that no one would go to jail.

795
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,160
So that this man, Bonny, your friend,
would not go to jail.

796
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,680
And my family caused this.

797
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,280
So you must tell me, Sam, please...

798
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,280
which is the greater shame?

799
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,840
I'm sorry, Julius.

800
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,760
What is your name?

801
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,200
I had an idea.

802
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,600
For a tire business. Like you.

803
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:18,360
I wanted to get a head start until
my loan came in, and my loan was denied.

804
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,120
Because they're racists. Nixon.

805
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:27,000
All of them. Like Zeffler.

806
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,920
I didn't get the money
because my partner is black.

807
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,160
I was gonna pay you back.
I'm just trying to keep my family together.

808
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,520
And the little guy just can't do it anymore.

809
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,840
Because there's a cancer in the system.

810
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:55,400
The whole system has a cancer,
and I'm being punished because I resist.

811
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,760
But somebody has to resist.

812
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,800
You're my brother.

813
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,200
As of this moment, Samuel...

814
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,880
I wash my hands of you. No more.
That's it. Nothing.

815
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,280
And if you steal from me again,
brother or no brother...

816
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,000
I will send you to jail.

817
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,400
<i>You can pick
the only luxury convertible made in America.</i>

818
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,320
<i>But no matter which of nine Cadillac models
you are to select...</i>

819
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,960
<i>they're all part of the Cadillac tradition.</i>

820
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,840
<i>Tonight, February 17.</i>

821
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,840
<i>Good evening. Secret Service officials
are still puzzling over...</i>

822
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,240
<i>the landing of an Army helicopter
early today...</i>

823
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,800
<i>on the south lawn of the White House.</i>

824
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,560
<i>It all started
shortly after midnight last night...</i>

825
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,000
<i>when Army Private First Class,
Robert Preston...</i>

826
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,920
<i>stole an unarmed helicopter...</i>

827
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,720
<i>from Fort Mead, Maryland.</i>

828
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,840
<i>The joy-riding pilot was identified
as 20-year-old PFC Robert Preston...</i>

829
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,440
<i>an Army helicopter mechanic...</i>

830
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,640
<i>who was reportedly unhappy
over flunking out of flight school.</i>

831
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,640
<i>He was charged with unlawful entry
into the White House grounds.</i>

832
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,760
<i>I sincerely believe that if his attitude
was to crash into the White House...</i>

833
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,440
<i>he could have accomplished it
without any problem.</i>

834
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,560
<i>Do you think his attitude
was to crash into the White House?</i>

835
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,200
<i>I do. I really do.</i>

836
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,080
<i>It wasn't like a light bulb really.</i>

837
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,760
<i>It was more like an old candle...</i>

838
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,080
<i>just a plain, simple idea.</i>

839
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,280
<i>But in that moment, Mr. Bernstein, I knew...</i>

840
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,440
<i>the die was cast.</i>

841
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,760
Mr. Bernstein...

842
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,760
I have the utmost respect for you.

843
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,960
<i>Your music...</i>

844
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,760
<i>is both pure and honest.</i>

845
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,520
<i>And that is why I have chosen you...</i>

846
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,960
<i>to present the truth about me to the world.</i>

847
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,040
<i>$120, 40, 60, 80, 200.</i>

848
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,080
<i>One, two, three, four and 33 cents.</i>

849
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,480
There you are, Mr. Bicke. All cashed out.

850
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,720
I'm sorry.

851
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,440
<i>It's a shame innocent lives
are going to have to be lost, Maestro.</i>

852
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,920
<i>And I will do my best
to prevent as many deaths...</i>

853
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,720
<i>as I possibly can. But that won't be easy.</i>

854
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,760
<i>If history teaches us anything...</i>

855
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,440
<i>it's that you have got to get
the seat of government.</i>

856
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,840
<i>The whole goddamned chair,
you just kick it out.</i>

857
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,560
<i>Let the system dangle till it doesn't breathe.</i>

858
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:38,200
<i>If you destroy the seat of government,
then you've made a change.</i>

859
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,000
<i>A real change.</i>

860
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,440
<i>And I am going to do it.</i>

861
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:13,520
No, this is... I'm sure it's just...

862
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,240
I have an injury.

863
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,160
It's okay. Thank you.

864
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,640
Good morning, gentlemen.
My name is Sam Bicke.

865
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,080
If you do what I say, no one will be hurt.

866
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:45,280
I want you to fly this plane,
and I want you to fly it low.

867
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,080
I want you to fly it very low.

868
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,280
I have to take control here.

869
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,160
<i>It's a shame
there aren't more people like Bonny.</i>

870
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,000
<i>What a beautiful man.</i>

871
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:51,360
<i>I hope that he will forgive me
for stealing his gun.</i>

872
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,320
They let you in looking like that?

873
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,200
I wanted to talk to you.

874
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,640
I'm sorry things didn't work out.
No hard feelings.

875
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,640
I wanted to thank you for teaching me...

876
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,080
that to be a salesman...

877
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,840
you don't have to be a good man.

878
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,400
You got a fever, Bicke?

879
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,720
You're sweating like a pig.

880
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,240
Here, wipe your forehead, for Christ's sake.

881
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,400
I'm trying to eat a meal.

882
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,840
You all right, son?

883
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,240
You love me. Don't you, boy?

884
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,400
Because I would never leave you.

885
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,080
Come on.

886
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,560
Good boy.

887
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,200
Sir? Excuse me.

888
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,520
You left your case.

889
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,680
<i>TWA skycap with wheelchair,
please come to TWA ticket counter.</i>

890
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,240
<i>I have received reports
from various parts of the country...</i>

891
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,400
<i>of many instances of sharp increases
in the price of gasoline.</i>

892
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,360
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
to begin boarding Flight 523 to Atlanta.</i>

893
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,680
<i>In accordance with our security measures,
we do ask you to begin to form a line.</i>

894
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,680
<i>Please have your tickets and
any carryon baggage with you at this time.</i>

895
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:03,880
<i>This is the general boarding call
for Flight 523 to Atlanta.</i>

896
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,080
Nobody move. I'll kill you.

897
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,400
I've got a bomb, I'll kill you.

898
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,920
You, come here. Close that door. Close it.

899
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,040
Sir, please just calm down.

900
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,720
- What?
- Just calm down.

901
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,240
We're gonna take care of anything you need.

902
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,440
No!

903
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,600
Write down that my name is Sam Bicke.

904
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:58,920
If you don't move, then no one will get hurt.

905
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,880
If you don't move, then no one will get hurt.

906
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,000
You understand?
I want you to fly this plane.

907
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,840
I want you to fly it low.
I want you to fly it very low.

908
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:14,200
I hear you, Sam.
I just need to call the tower. Okay?

909
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,480
I'm gonna call the tower.

910
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,480
I'm gonna reach over here
and get my headset.

911
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,320
I'll put it on and then call the tower...

912
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:24,200
because I need them to come
and take the tugs out in front of the wheels.

913
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,480
You have to help him to fly the plane. Okay?

914
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:13,720
She's gonna help you fly the plane.
You have to move him.

915
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,400
Sam, I can fly the plane myself.
Just let her go.

916
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,320
Please let me go.

917
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,640
I don't want to die.

918
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,000
<i>Look at me, Maestro. Am I smiling?</i>

919
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:02,560
<i>Tell them why I did this, Maestro.
History needs to be clear on this.</i>

920
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,720
<i>They can rebuild the White House,
but they will never...</i>

921
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,280
<i>forget me.</i>

922
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,640
<i>Not ever.</i>

923
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,000
<i>I was here, Maestro.</i>

924
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,120
<i>I did this.</i>

925
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:25,520
<i>And a man is only remembered for his work.</i>

926
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,960
<i>Just tell them that.</i>

927
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,280
<i>The first hijack attempt
in the United States in more than a year...</i>

928
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,600
<i>was made today in Baltimore. It failed.</i>

929
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:46,400
<i>There had not been another hijacking
attempt in this country until today.</i>

930
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,160
<i>And it happened at the same Baltimore
airport, but with far worse consequences.</i>

931
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,200
<i>Forty-four-year-old Samuel Bicke
walked to the departure gate...</i>

932
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:57,880
<i>carrying a harmless-looking attach case
which contained gasoline and a detonator.</i>

933
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:02,000
<i>He was running and acting
like he was crazy. Out of his mind.</i>

934
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:06,040
<i>Bicke ran through the boarding bridge
yelling for passengers to get out of his way.</i>

935
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,280
<i>A policeman ran after him, but by that time...</i>

936
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:11,400
<i>Bicke was inside and had forced
the stewardesses to close the door.</i>

937
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,560
<i>The policeman
fired through the door's window...</i>

938
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,640
<i>and killed the would-be hijacker.</i>

939
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,360
<i>His motive may never be known, but
authorities say that there's no question...</i>

940
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,880
<i>the hijacker intended to destroy himself
and everyone else aboard Delta Flight 523.</i>
