1
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,177
Hey, little Lady.

2
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,653
Hell's coming for breakfast.

3
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,789
Hey, little lady.

4
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,530
Hell's coming for breakfast.

5
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:49,677
Hey, little lady,
hell is coming for breakfast.

6
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,832
Hey, little lady.

7
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,435
Hell is coming for breakfast.

8
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,415
Hey, little lady.

9
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,351
Hell is coming for breakfast.
I got it.

10
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,458
You've been saying that
for the last forever, Joe.

11
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,695
Am I supposed
to pretend I can't hear?

12
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,396
It's Clint.

13
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,866
I'm sleeping.

14
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:56,309
So, is it the actual location
that's coming for breakfast

15
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,713
or is hell actually
coming for breakfast?

16
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:02,182
Like, is it like,
"Get ready, little lady,

17
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,284
Friars Club
is coming for breakfast."

18
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,186
Or is it,
"Hey, little lady,

19
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,288
Walmart is coming
for breakfast,

20
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,958
because I need to know how
many places to set."

21
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,492
You think you're funny,
don't you?

22
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:16,296
- What is that?
- Oh, you mean this?

23
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:19,100
Well, who's coming
for breakfast?

24
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,802
Satan? Hitler?

25
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,302
You love it.

26
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,938
No, please go back

27
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,272
to the bathroom,
shave it off.

28
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,741
Not shaving it off.
It's authentic.

29
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,010
- It's my hunting look.
- Oh.

30
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,511
Yeah.

31
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,117
- Hey, baby.
- Hmm?

32
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:39,419
Authentic is how you walked
into this town.

33
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,723
It looks good on me.

34
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,592
It does look good.

35
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,128
- That's right.
- It does.

36
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,863
Now, hold on, hold on,
hold on.

37
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:51,933
-Oh, wow.
-Hold on, hold on.

38
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,639
Honey, why don't you
hop back into bed?

39
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,809
Come on.
I'll do this authentic guy.

40
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,912
Come on. Come on.
I mean it.

41
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,115
Honey, come on, don't be--

42
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:08,649
Making fun of me. It's fine.

43
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,017
I mean so...

44
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,730
All right,
let's have it.

45
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,368
-This is irresponsible.
-You said that last night.

46
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:34,374
That's just stupid,
what you're doing.

47
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,944
-You said that too.
-Well, you're being an asshole.

48
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,914
Tess, why are you blowing
this out of proportion?

49
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,683
Tons of guys around here
hunt for their livelihood.

50
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,452
Your dad does it,
Doug does it.

51
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,488
Uh, you're not
from here, Joe.

52
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,193
You sell insurance for a living
and you're really good at it.

53
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,328
Okay, well,
I live here now, so what?

54
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,534
And you're understanding of
here thus far is that mustache?

55
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:08,910
You haven't hunted
enough with Doug

56
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,443
to go out on your own.

57
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:12,379
I keep telling you I have
a funny feeling about this

58
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,081
and you just
keep ignoring that.

59
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,691
That was mean.

60
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,360
Yeah, it was.

61
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,497
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:39,140
We moved out here to provide
our boys with a safe,

63
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,109
familiar place to grow up
and not to become some...

64
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,313
end of the world
Fox News people.

65
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,380
That's not
what's happening.

66
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,150
It's not
what's happening, Tess.

67
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,284
You have nothing to prove.

68
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,752
I love you...

69
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,021
without the mustache.

70
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:57,892
But there are
a couple of girls

71
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,694
I can whore you out to
if you want it.

72
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,129
If things get worse,

73
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,099
we need to know
how to do this stuff.

74
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,635
Not that argument
again.

75
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,103
No, why can't--
why can't I say that?

76
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,205
-Why can't I say that?
-Because--

77
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,874
Because I heard it
my whole life.

78
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:14,976
Okay?

79
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,778
I grew up with these
mountains and my--

80
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,114
my dad prepping
for the end of days.

81
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,183
-That's why I left.
-This is stupid.

82
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:24,252
-I can't win this argument.
-Oh, you can't? You know why?

83
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:25,686
Because
it's not about providing,

84
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,021
it's about your ego,
it's about you wanting to

85
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,623
go out with the boys
hunting.

86
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,159
So what? So what?

87
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,527
There's nothing
wrong with that

88
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,029
except for experience
you don't have.

89
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,865
-That's why I'm going out.
-With someone else, Joe.

90
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,301
That's how you learn.
You don't learn alone.

91
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,904
No, you learn by going
out there and doing it.

92
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:44,538
Right, you just go sit
in the deer stand,

93
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,240
you wait for a deer,
and you shoot it.

94
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,575
Twelve-year-old boys do it.

95
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,409
Why can't I go
out there and try it?

96
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,816
We agreed that we would
learn together as a family.

97
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,352
We would grow
a garden in the spring

98
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,721
and can in the winter.

99
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,858
Go with Doug next week.
That is all I'm asking.

100
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,159
It's not much.

101
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:09,462
I packed lunch
for the entire day.

102
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:14,535
And I'm going to go out there
and I'm gonna stay all day.

103
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,436
And I will not be home
until tonight.

104
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,438
Okay.
And if you kill something,

105
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,341
you know
how to disembowel it, right?

106
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,177
Babe, I can't-- I can't.
I'm not doing this.

107
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,416
-I love you.
-I love you.

108
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,384
You better say
goodbye to the boys.

109
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,853
No doubt they heard us.

110
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,498
Love you, buddy.

111
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,402
Hey, little lady,
hell's for breakfast.

112
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,373
You like that?

113
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,075
Mm-hmm.
Will you say it for me?

114
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,911
That's why I'm coming in.

115
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:59,714
To tell you I love you
and I'll see you tonight.

116
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,550
Okay.

117
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,485
You and Mom fighting?

118
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:07,188
No, not at all.

119
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,991
You're doing
that whisper thing again.

120
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,662
Well,

121
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:17,565
sometimes when Mom

122
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:20,634
and Dads need to have
a conversation,

123
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,004
it's better that
it happens in whispers.

124
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,809
-You like it?
-Mm-hm.

125
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,179
It looks funny.

126
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,150
I love you.

127
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,987
- I'll see you tonight.
- Me too.

128
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,829
Hey.

129
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,034
Last offer.

130
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,303
Don't do this.

131
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,141
Don't do that. Don't.

132
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,445
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

133
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,414
What are you doing?

134
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:08,249
Okay, then.
Have fun out there.

135
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:10,251
You know
what I'll be doing.

136
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:20,127
What's wrong with you, Joe?

137
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:24,231
Get a gun, go out,
kill a deer just to go...

138
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,376
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

139
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:44,945
Hey.

140
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:48,182
Can I borrow your--
your rifle?

141
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,351
You ain't get one yet?

142
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,522
Tess, she, uh--

143
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:54,989
she doesn't want to get
one right now.

144
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:58,092
It-- it doesn't matter.
Can I just borrow yours?

145
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,073
Ah.

146
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,447
- Do you need ammo?
- No, I bought some.

147
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:23,618
-Tess let you get ammo?
-She doesn't know I bought it.

148
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,119
- Mmm.
- Sorry, sorry.

149
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,989
- Got your tags?
- Got them in the bag.

150
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,091
- You double check 'em?
- Yes, Mom.

151
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,393
I ain't your mom.

152
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,161
All right, I know.

153
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,197
Won't be a problem
on the property.

154
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:37,798
No one can be on it.

155
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,867
But if an officer asks
for your tags on the way back

156
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,203
and you don't have them,
that's trouble.

157
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:43,837
I got it. Got it.

158
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,540
You remember
how to get to the property?

159
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,408
- I believe so.
- What else?

160
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,311
I-- I can't think
of anything else.

161
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,082
If you just wait
'til next week, I can go.

162
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,285
Thank you. But I've got
two conferences next week.

163
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,788
-Plus, Tess--
-No, I ain't in your marriage.

164
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,923
Unless you into
some freaky stuff.

165
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,926
Keep it to yourself, then.

166
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:09,029
Look,
keys are in the car

167
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,131
if you need to borrow it
for any reason, have at it.

168
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:14,001
I ain't driving
that jerk mobile.

169
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:15,670
That's nice.

170
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,942
- Thanks again.
- Mm-hm.

171
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,579
Hey, I'll be sure to bring
that ten point by here

172
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,146
so you can get
that photo op.

173
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,082
Godspeed.

174
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,363
That's your music, right?

175
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,798
You know,
you've got neighbors.

176
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,772
All right, mustache.
Have fun.

177
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:10,599
Strike one.

178
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,668
One and one is the count.

179
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,372
Joseph Chambers steps
to the mound.

180
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:23,177
Bottom of the ninth.
Two outs.

181
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:27,414
1991 World Series.

182
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,986
Strike two.

183
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:50,639
Too high. Too high.

184
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:56,143
Ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:58,879
Can Joe do it tonight?

186
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:01,448
And he may.

187
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:05,386
Minnesota.
The talk of the sports world.

188
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:14,695
Outside.

189
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:35,716
Strike three!

190
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,718
Joseph Chambers has won

191
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:40,589
the 1991 World Series.

192
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:43,390
The Minnesota Twins
are victorious.

193
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:47,662
Joseph Chambers is an MVP.

194
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:49,863
He has just beaten
,

195
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:51,600
ladies and gentlemen.

196
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,768
There was never,
ever any doubt.

197
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:58,739
We knew
he could pull it off.

198
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:01,842
And tonight...

199
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:05,614
We have sat here
and witnessed history.

200
00:30:10,244 --> 00:30:12,146
<i>♪ I'm the moustache man ♪</i>

201
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:14,448

208
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,496
No, no, no.

209
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:10,158
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

210
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:12,459
Oh, no, please no.

211
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:17,665
Oh, please just wake up.

212
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:28,509
Oh, please tell me
this isn't happening.

213
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:35,883
Oh, oh, oh.

214
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:49,429
I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

215
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:53,100
Oh, please, God.

216
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:56,369
Please, please, please,
please, please, oh, please.

217
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:58,105
Please, I'm so sorry.

218
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:59,527
Stupid fucking vest.

219
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,728
He's trespassing.

220
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:24,398
And I'm just standing
my ground, right?

221
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:26,535
I'm supposed to be
on this property.

222
00:44:26,635 --> 00:44:28,102
He's not supposed to be
on this property.

223
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:32,740
So...

224
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:34,842
I did a good thing.

225
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:37,044
Maybe some little kid
had been on here, right?

226
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:38,547
What if this guy
was dangerous?

227
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,714
They should thank me
for getting his ass

228
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:42,584
off of this property
because he was trespassing.

229
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:45,419
He could be a convict,
he could be dangerous.

230
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,488
He's breaking the law,

231
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:48,856
and no, it's not my job

232
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:50,758
to enforce the law
by any means.

233
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,226
I'm not saying that.

234
00:44:52,326 --> 00:44:54,094
What I am saying, though,
is that he is the danger.

235
00:44:54,195 --> 00:44:56,730
And I will just have to
stand my ground.

236
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:03,070
All right.
Exactly what I'm doing.

237
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:08,042
Make this go away.

238
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:29,730
It was an accident.

239
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:32,433
Of course it's an accident,
you idiot.

240
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:34,703
You didn't do this
on purpose.

241
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:39,139
Come on, Joe.
These things happen, okay?

242
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:42,309
He was on private property.

243
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,112
Private land means
trespassing,

244
00:45:45,212 --> 00:45:47,348
and trespassing means
stand your ground.

245
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,753
You're doing
what's right, okay?

246
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:54,121
You did
the right thing, Joe.

247
00:45:56,123 --> 00:45:58,993
Okay, okay.

248
00:45:59,994 --> 00:46:02,564
Okay, it's the right thing.

249
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:07,301
You gotta dig a hole.
You gotta put him in it.

250
00:46:08,802 --> 00:46:09,837
Dig a hole.

251
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:12,873
And you gotta put him in it,
do you hear me, Joe?

252
00:46:13,508 --> 00:46:14,808
Go and dig a hole.

253
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:17,845
You put him in it.
You gonna dig a hole.

254
00:46:23,884 --> 00:46:25,152
I'm so sorry.

255
00:46:48,342 --> 00:46:51,546
Go and dig a hole.
You put him in it.

256
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,049
Dig a hole.
You gotta put him in it.

257
00:46:55,617 --> 00:46:57,051
Go dig a hole.

258
00:46:58,653 --> 00:47:01,188
Dig a hole
and put him in it.

259
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:03,591
Dig a hole
and put him in it.

260
00:47:03,692 --> 00:47:06,060
Dig a hole,
put him in it.

261
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,630
Dig a hole,
put him in it.

262
00:47:09,063 --> 00:47:10,831
Dig a hole,
put him in it.

263
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:12,600
Dig a hole.

264
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:15,135
Dig a hole.

265
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:26,847
Dig a hole
and put him in it.

266
00:47:26,947 --> 00:47:30,017
Dig a hole,
put him in it.

267
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:34,888
Just dig a hole
and put him in it.

268
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:31,912
No, no, wait.

269
00:48:32,346 --> 00:48:34,448
Wait. Wait, please.
Please don't run away.

270
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:36,116
- Help.
- Please don't run away.

271
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:38,218
- Help! Someone!
- Hey! Sir! Sir.

272
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:39,888
No. No, no.
Please wait. Come back.

273
00:48:39,987 --> 00:48:41,188
- Somebody help.
- No, no.

274
00:48:41,288 --> 00:48:42,857
I'm not gonna hurt you,
I promise.

275
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,057
- Help! Help!
- No, no, Wait. Wait.

276
00:48:44,158 --> 00:48:45,627
- Hold on.

277
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:47,127
- Please stop running!
- Somebody! Help!

278
00:48:47,227 --> 00:48:49,396
No, no, no.
Please stop running.

279
00:48:49,496 --> 00:48:52,065
- Sir, hold on. Hold on.
- Help! Help!

280
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,668
No, no, no,
please, please, please.

281
00:48:53,768 --> 00:48:55,169
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Help!

282
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,571
No, no,
I'm not gonna hurt you, please.

283
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:58,506
- Help!
- Hey! Hey!

284
00:48:58,606 --> 00:48:59,973
Stop, please, please!

285
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:04,679
No! No, no, ow!

286
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:08,449
Please stop!

287
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,218
Please stop, please stop.
Stop it, please.

288
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:13,020
I wanna help you, okay? Ow!

289
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,790
Please! Let me talk.

290
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,826
No, no. Ow!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

291
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:19,661
No! Hold on.
Just let me explain. Ow!

292
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,663
Stop and let me explain.

293
00:49:21,763 --> 00:49:23,665
Ah! No! Stop it!

294
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:25,867
God, please. Please stop!

295
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,401
- Help!
- Please stop!

296
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:29,403
- Listen. Listen. Listen.
- Help! Help!

297
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:32,105
- Help! Help!
- I'm not gonna hurt you!

298
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:33,340
I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

299
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,776
I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

300
00:49:34,876 --> 00:49:36,009
I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

301
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:37,444
I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

302
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:40,147
- Please. Please. Please.
- Help!

303
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:43,083

Please stop. Please stop.
Please, please, please.

306
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,459
Okay. Okay. Okay.

307
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,874
Help, please, someone.

308
00:50:05,974 --> 00:50:08,075
Help me.

309
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:13,748
Somebody!

310
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,050
Help.

311
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:36,905
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

312
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:38,740
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

313
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,141
No, I'm not gonna--
Hold on. Let me help you.

314
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:42,409
I'm just gonna
help you sit up.

315
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,846
Okay? Come on.

316
00:50:44,946 --> 00:50:46,146
Come on. I'm sorry.

317
00:50:46,246 --> 00:50:49,182
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

318
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:53,387
I'm sorry. Stop.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

319
00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:55,557
Okay?
I'm just trying to help.

320
00:50:55,657 --> 00:50:57,124
You shot me.

321
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:01,061
You're on private property.

322
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,096
You were trespassing.

323
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:09,369
Private property...

324
00:51:39,968 --> 00:51:41,234
How old are you?

325
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:50,845
Do you live out here?

326
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,518
I was trying to.

327
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:07,194
Are you out here alone?

328
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:12,132
What the fuck?

329
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:14,535
What the fuck
were you thinking?

330
00:52:15,502 --> 00:52:17,772
Firing off
in the woods like that.

331
00:52:19,707 --> 00:52:20,808
I was chasing a deer.

332
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:23,443
I didn't mean
to shoot you.

333
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:28,616
It's my buddy's property.

334
00:52:30,384 --> 00:52:31,886
He lets me
come out here and hunt.

335
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:33,788
I was following this deer.

336
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:37,424
Trying to learn
how to be self-reliant

337
00:52:37,525 --> 00:52:39,159
in case things get worse,
you know?

338
00:52:48,903 --> 00:52:50,538
Ah, you're an idiot.

339
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:56,911
You don't belong out here.

340
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:05,153
Your type will be
the first to go

341
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:06,621
when it goes down.

342
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:13,260
I'm trying, okay?

343
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,962
That's why
I was trying to kill a deer,

344
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:16,396
so I could clean it.

345
00:53:16,496 --> 00:53:18,800
And I could keep it
in my freezer,

346
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,400
and I can feed my family.

347
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:22,937
So, I'm trying.

348
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:28,943
What kind of working freezer
are you gonna put it in

349
00:53:29,043 --> 00:53:30,343
when there's no power?

350
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:35,482
What?

351
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:41,689
Does your freezer
magically work in your fantasy?

352
00:53:47,695 --> 00:53:48,763
I guess so.

353
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:54,434
Small animals...

354
00:53:57,939 --> 00:53:59,306
how you survive.

355
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,848
And wheat.

356
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:15,388
Edible plants...

357
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:18,559
You just waste resources
with deer.

358
00:54:28,169 --> 00:54:29,436
I didn't know that.

359
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:32,874
My buddy, Doug,
has been teaching me how--

360
00:54:38,146 --> 00:54:39,680
Come on.
We got to do something.

361
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:41,516
- No. Don't.
- Yeah, let me just--

362
00:54:41,616 --> 00:54:42,950
-let's just try, let's just--
-Don't.

363
00:54:43,918 --> 00:54:45,720
Don't--

364
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,188
don't try.

365
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:49,157
I'm at least gonna try
to stop the bleeding.

366
00:54:49,257 --> 00:54:51,391
You're a fucking idiot.

367
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,761
No, stop. Don't touch me.

368
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:56,396
Don't come--
don't touch me.

369
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:59,534
Stop!
Goddammit, stop it!

370
00:54:59,634 --> 00:55:02,703
Just let me help.
Here. Here. Here.

371
00:55:02,804 --> 00:55:04,337
It's not gonna make any--

372
00:55:04,437 --> 00:55:05,540
Stop.
I'll just put this back here.

373
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,175
Don't-- don't try-- Stop.

374
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:08,776
Stop it.

375
00:55:08,876 --> 00:55:10,477
Just lean up. Lean up.

376
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:12,079
Oh, God!

377
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:14,882
Goddammit, stop.

378
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:20,054
- I'm so sorry.
- Stop saying that.

379
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:21,421
I'm so sorry.

380
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:23,858
God damn you're pathetic...

381
00:55:52,253 --> 00:55:53,453
I need to get you
to the hospital.

382
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:55,089
No, you don't.

383
00:55:55,189 --> 00:55:56,356
Look,
I was only digging the hole

384
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:58,059
'cause I thought
you was dead, okay?

385
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,894
Now that-- if I'd known that
you were alive, I would've--

386
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:02,663
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

387
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:09,136
I can't just
leave you out here.

388
00:56:09,237 --> 00:56:11,005
We got to try to get you down
to the truck, come on.

389
00:56:11,105 --> 00:56:13,274
-Man, come on, just--
-If you keep touching me

390
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:16,777
I'm gonna kill you.

391
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:22,550
I'm so sorry.

392
00:56:24,352 --> 00:56:25,920
Stop saying that.

393
00:56:26,419 --> 00:56:28,022
Stop saying that.

394
00:56:31,424 --> 00:56:33,794
God, it's pathetic.

395
00:56:34,562 --> 00:56:36,030
You're not gonna
fix anything.

396
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:17,939
How long
you been living out here?

397
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:23,711
Doesn't matter.

398
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:27,648
Seems like you've been
out here for a long time.

399
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:29,917
Is there somebody
I can call for you?

400
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:12,760
Yeah.

401
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:19,200
You pick out them fancy
catalogue clothes yourself?

402
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:21,836
Or your mommy do it for you?

403
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:27,942
Oh, God.

404
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:32,079
Oh, the irony.

405
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:37,785
Killed by a phony.

406
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:46,594
Yup.

407
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:49,697
I'm a big phony.

408
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:52,066
But I'm at least trying.

409
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,902
That was the whole
point of this.

410
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:07,214
Oh, God.

411
00:59:21,896 --> 00:59:24,665
I can't just sit here
while you're dying,

412
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:26,167
so no,
we need to do something.

413
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:27,868
Just shut up.

414
01:00:04,138 --> 01:00:06,273
My wife didn't want me
to come out here today.

415
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:13,047
She tried everything
to keep me to stay at home.

416
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:15,249
I'm just saying,
it seems like

417
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:17,017
the whole world
is falling apart and it's--

418
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:41,675
There is no...

419
01:00:44,278 --> 01:00:45,946
...point to surviving.

420
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:49,950
Just to survive.

421
01:00:55,156 --> 01:00:56,390
There's no point.

422
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:23,217
Well...

423
01:01:29,524 --> 01:01:30,925
the whole point
of this was...

424
01:01:31,725 --> 01:01:33,160
so I could take care of
my family.

425
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:38,633
If things got really bad,
I don't--

426
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:41,769
I don't know how to do anything
but sell insurance.

427
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:45,439
I just want to--

428
01:01:47,474 --> 01:01:49,977
I just want to be able
to take care of them, you know?

429
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,252
I'm so sorry.
I did not mean--

430
01:02:44,465 --> 01:02:45,766
I'm so sorry.

431
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:48,269
I'm so sorry.

432
01:02:53,508 --> 01:02:55,109
Okay.

433
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,411
Okay.

434
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:26,514
Joe. Joe.

435
01:12:29,817 --> 01:12:31,118
Hey, sexy.

436
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:47,768
Hey, sweetheart.

437
01:12:49,704 --> 01:12:51,239
Is this your new hunting look,

438
01:12:51,339 --> 01:12:52,673
or you're just trying
to make me regret

439
01:12:52,773 --> 01:12:55,475
being so mean to you
this morning?

440
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:04,151
I, uh, fell in the river
and decided to strip down

441
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:05,786
and ride home with the heat on.

442
01:13:07,288 --> 01:13:09,891
I'm sorry,
I'll take you any way I can.

443
01:13:13,594 --> 01:13:15,129
Did you see anything?

444
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,397
No.

445
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,502
-Did you have fun, at least?
-Yeah. It was okay.

446
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:26,173
Hey, what's wrong?

447
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:30,077
Nothing.

448
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:34,548
Just tired and sore
from walking around all day.

449
01:13:35,316 --> 01:13:36,817
Yeah, that can happen.

450
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,725
<i>Oh, God.</i>

451
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:20,493
<i>The irony...</i>

452
01:14:26,033 --> 01:14:27,435
<i>Killed by a phony...</i>

453
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:31,672
Does Doug know you're
keeping the truck overnight?

454
01:14:33,174 --> 01:14:34,775
No, he, uh...

455
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,445
I figured I'd come home,
eat dinner,

456
01:14:37,545 --> 01:14:38,946
maybe drop it by later.

457
01:14:39,046 --> 01:14:40,848
Just didn't want
to show up in my underwear.

458
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:43,918
-Never live that down.
-That's true.

459
01:14:47,288 --> 01:14:48,488
-Watch out.
-Sorry.

460
01:14:57,331 --> 01:14:59,266
<i>Hey, sexy.</i>

461
01:15:01,902 --> 01:15:03,070
Hey...

462
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:06,507
You okay?

463
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:08,943
Sure. I'm fine.

464
01:15:09,443 --> 01:15:10,978
Just need some food in me.

465
01:15:13,114 --> 01:15:15,282
Thank you, Father,
thank you, Father,

466
01:15:15,383 --> 01:15:16,817
for this wonderful food.

467
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:18,652
Thank you, Father, for Dad
being able to go hunting

468
01:15:18,753 --> 01:15:20,721
and come back safely,

469
01:15:20,821 --> 01:15:22,556
in Jesus' name, amen.

470
01:15:23,224 --> 01:15:24,625
-Amen.
-Amen.

471
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:31,198
Well, we didn't get a deer,

472
01:15:31,298 --> 01:15:35,636
but we did get Daddy's
favorite meat as back up.

473
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,338
Ribs.

474
01:15:38,305 --> 01:15:41,475
I was actually,
talking to Frank about venison,

475
01:15:41,575 --> 01:15:42,810
about the different ways

476
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,545
you can cut it
and cook it,

477
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:47,548
and he said that if
you happen to catch a deer,

478
01:15:47,648 --> 01:15:49,750
you should have him
do it this time...

479
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,696
<i>No, help me!</i>

480
01:16:02,797 --> 01:16:04,565
<i>Please!</i>

481
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:12,073
<i>Joe.</i>

482
01:17:57,478 --> 01:18:00,080
Okay, okay, okay.

483
01:24:28,636 --> 01:24:30,772
He says,
"Pat, well, that's exactly

484
01:24:30,872 --> 01:24:32,306
what I said, and Pat--"

485
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:34,909
He just kind of
walks up and says,

486
01:24:35,009 --> 01:24:39,413
"No, ma'am,
you said armadillo."

487
01:24:43,818 --> 01:24:45,352
Hey, Joey.

488
01:24:49,857 --> 01:24:52,259
Joe? Hey, are you all right?

489
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:56,731
Hey, Bonnie, I'm gonna have to
call you back.

490
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:06,708
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

491
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:12,212
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

492
01:25:13,246 --> 01:25:14,582
Can you talk to me?

493
01:25:18,086 --> 01:25:20,320
Joe, I'm just gonna have
a quick look at you.

494
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:29,496
I'm gonna grab you a blanket.

495
01:25:30,163 --> 01:25:31,899
Just wait-- wait right here.

496
01:25:54,088 --> 01:25:55,690
Tessie and the kids?

497
01:25:58,425 --> 01:26:01,461
Joe. Are they hurt?

498
01:26:03,631 --> 01:26:06,166
Okay, all right,
look, I'm just gonna

499
01:26:06,266 --> 01:26:08,268
put this blanket on,
I'll get you--

500
01:26:08,936 --> 01:26:10,605
get youreal-- what?

501
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,812
Okay, all right,
you stay right here.

502
01:26:18,412 --> 01:26:19,781
I'll be right back.

503
01:26:45,773 --> 01:26:46,841
Oh!

504
01:26:48,142 --> 01:26:49,409
Dammit.

505
01:26:58,853 --> 01:27:03,290
We have a situation,
1089, white pickup truck

506
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:05,392
at the police station
parked right in front.

507
01:27:05,492 --> 01:27:06,828
You can't miss it.

508
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:10,798
I'm going to need
one of you to come back here.

509
01:27:14,168 --> 01:27:15,402
All right, do me a favor,

510
01:27:15,502 --> 01:27:17,304
set up a perimeter
when you arrive

511
01:27:17,404 --> 01:27:19,907
I'll be inside
questioning the suspect.

512
01:27:23,443 --> 01:27:24,444
God damn it.

513
01:27:39,392 --> 01:27:41,229
I have to cuff you, Joe.

514
01:27:43,965 --> 01:27:46,567
Just 'till we figure out
what's going on, all right?

515
01:27:48,903 --> 01:27:50,437
All right,
we're gonna go in the back,

516
01:27:50,538 --> 01:27:51,973
and have a little chat.

517
01:27:54,509 --> 01:27:56,711
Just step against the wall
to the right.

518
01:28:07,655 --> 01:28:09,791
All right we're gonna go
right to the right here.

519
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:17,497
All right, I'm gonna
have you sit...

520
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:21,368
Just sit right here.

521
01:28:26,406 --> 01:28:28,576
Oh, the motion sensors
are on the fritz.

522
01:28:28,676 --> 01:28:32,379
So, I'm gonna wave my arm
around like a jackass.

523
01:28:40,353 --> 01:28:41,656
All right, Joe...

524
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,392
do you think
you can tell me what happened?

525
01:28:59,406 --> 01:29:01,809
Joe, there's a body
in the back of Doug's truck.

526
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:10,718
Joe.

527
01:29:12,687 --> 01:29:16,489
Can you-- can you tell me
how it got there?

528
01:29:35,076 --> 01:29:39,379
Listen Joe,
I am here for you, all right?

529
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:42,283
But you have to tell me
what happened.

530
01:30:02,536 --> 01:30:03,871
Come on, Joe.

531
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:12,013
I just want to see Tess.

532
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,749
yeah.

533
01:30:15,683 --> 01:30:17,551
We can work that out.

534
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:19,787
Say it.

535
01:30:20,588 --> 01:30:22,890
- I just want to see the boys.
- Okay.

536
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:25,293
I can help you.

537
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:29,597
But you-- you still have to
tell me what's going on.

538
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,902
I need you to tell me
what happened.

539
01:30:39,472 --> 01:30:42,677
Take your time,
there's no rush.

540
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:46,446
There's no rush, Joe.

541
01:30:47,381 --> 01:30:48,649
There's no rush, huh?

542
01:30:48,749 --> 01:30:52,219
I am here,
so whenever you're ready...
