2
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:48,174
He's almost done.
You're doing just fine.

3
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,594
Thanks, it's not so bad.

4
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:56,265
Well, one last push.

5
00:02:57,016 --> 00:03:00,561
-You're ready?
- I think so, Dr. Guy.

6
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,191
All right.

7
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:06,525
Doctor?

8
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:08,694
Yes, Patty?

9
00:03:09,654 --> 00:03:11,322
I think there's a little more

10
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,661
Where?

11
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:24,377
Well, I guess there was.

12
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:26,587
That should be it.

13
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,714
- Thank you so much, Dr. Guy.

14
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:31,425
-I feel like a whole new person.
-It was my pleasure.

15
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,885
I insist.

16
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:16,971
What happened?

17
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:18,973
Nothing.

18
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,225
You sure you don't
want to talk about it?

19
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:24,353
Guy's just being really
difficult this morning.

20
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:26,522
Probably nervous today.

21
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:29,775
-Why?
- The patent examiners are coming.

22
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,445
No, they're not coming today.

23
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:34,822
-He didn't tell you?
-Hello?

24
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,992
I believe it's my
turn to be seen now.

25
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:41,871
-Sir?
-You just called my name.

26
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:44,874
Sherman, Eugene Sherman.

27
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,084
No Sir, go sit down.

28
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:53,799
Well, don't call my name
if you're not ready.

29
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:59,638
-He's been doing that all day.
-What's going on?

30
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:01,557
The patent examiners
are coming back.

31
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:04,643
-No.
-Why is that a problem?

32
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:09,398
Because last time
didn't go so well.

33
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:12,568
If they are coming, I'm done here.

34
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:15,362
Well, they're definitely coming soon.

35
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:17,448
What happened last time?

36
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,119
This happened.

37
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:26,248
This machine is dangerous.

38
00:05:26,582 --> 00:05:29,877
-He says it's ready now.
-He said that before.

39
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:33,589
Okay, let's just get
my last day over with.

40
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:36,300
-Yes Ma'am.
-Thank you.

41
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,722
Now seeing Carol?

42
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:45,059
Are you sure you don't
want to see Mr. Sherman?

43
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,311
I thought I heard another name.

44
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:49,188
Maybe there's a mix up.

45
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:52,775
-I'm Carol.
-Miss Carol, please follow me.

46
00:05:58,614 --> 00:06:00,366
Please have a seat, Sir.

47
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:02,535
Won't take long.

48
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:07,039
How are you doing?

49
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:10,251
I'm doing okay,
thank you very much.

50
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:13,754
Weather's a bit cold,
but can't complain.

51
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:15,587
Thanks for coming in today.

52
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:17,091
We'll get you fixed right up.

53
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,760
-Thanks so much.
-You're welcome.

54
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:27,101
-After you.
-<i>Thanks.</i>

55
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:30,062
Please have a seat.

56
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:35,442
I'll need to do a routine
checkup before we get started.

57
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:36,902
Okay.

58
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:39,446
Tammie said you've got
a small spot on your neck.

59
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:41,657
Yes Ma'am, I do.

60
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,165
Let's have a look at it.

61
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,591
I think my boyfriend might
have left me because of that.

62
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:01,552
Oh no.
Then this boy wasn't worth it.

63
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:03,762
You're beautiful inside and out.

64
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,811
-It's a sebaceous cyst.
-Oh no.

65
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:13,898
No no, it's non-cancerous,
so you'll be just fine.

66
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,442
And Dr. Guy's a specialist for this,

67
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,776
so you're in good hands.

68
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:20,029
like

69
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:23,365
Let me brief him quickly
and I'll be right back.

70
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:25,200
Sounds just fine.

71
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:26,911
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

72
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:49,892
Laser creates a clean
incision on the area.

73
00:07:50,184 --> 00:07:52,227
I've tested it on
numerous test subjects.

74
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:56,273
-Like rats?
- No, human tissue, son.

75
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,192
Right, of course.

76
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,861
You think you might
do it for me today?

77
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:03,405
I mean, yeah sure.

78
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:05,282
I might even hire you full time.

79
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,491
Oh gosh,
that would be great.

80
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:09,787
I could really use the
extra money right now.

81
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:12,414
Let's just don't talk about that yet.

82
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:14,959
You can't put
a price tag on experience.

83
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:20,214
We need to talk.

84
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:23,384
-Okay.
-Alone.

85
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:26,011
Preston,
could you give us a minute?

86
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:27,346
Yeah, sure.

87
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,522
How could you?

88
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:39,108
-What?
-You know.

89
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:41,610
Okay, relax Patty.
It's gonna work this time.

90
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,864
I told you if you ever use
this machine again, I quit.

91
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,493
Well, if you feel that way,
we'll do fine without you.

92
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:52,121
The intern's working out just fine.

93
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:54,081
I mean it.

94
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:57,584
Look, I am sure someone else
will come along and want to take you.

95
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:00,295
Just remember to file that paperwork.

96
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:02,131
You're gonna need it.

97
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,178
I can't believe you.

98
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:11,974
Well, you might want to start.

99
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:15,519
See in our next patient, Patty.

100
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,359
This is a good one.

101
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:24,528
Nice and juicy.

102
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:26,572
Could you feel that?

103
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:28,115
Barely.

104
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:31,201
I think Patricia said
it was a bodacious cyst.

105
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:34,538
Is that true? I just want to
make sure it isn't cancerous.

106
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:37,166
Sebaceous cyst.

107
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,877
I'm sorry she told
you the wrong name.

108
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:41,626
Look, it's nothing to worry about.

109
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:43,714
We'll get this out
sooner than later, okay?

110
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:45,257
Okay.

111
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:48,886
Did she tell you
today is her last day?

112
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,763
Oh, no she didn't.

113
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:53,015
I'm really sorry to hear that.

114
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:55,350
We are, too.

115
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,603
<i>We are, too.</i>

116
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:03,275
Can you feel that?

117
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:05,277
How was that?

118
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:07,905
-Not to bad.
- Well...

119
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:10,532
Carol, on a scale of one to 10,

120
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:12,451
how would you rate it for pain?

121
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:14,328
Probably a four.

122
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:16,288
Four?

123
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:22,419
I'm afraid that's high for
this type of procedure.

124
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:25,253
I'm afraid it's gonna
get a lot more painful.

125
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:26,673
<i>If that's the way it feels now.</i>

126
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,966
It is.

127
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:33,138
Carol, I would like to
offer you an exclusive,

128
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:36,141
that I do for certain patients...

129
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,102
with this type of pain tolerance.

130
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:39,812
Okay.

131
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,398
I've invented a machine
that virtually performs

132
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:47,528
this operation pain-free
and it removes a cyst,

133
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:50,572
just like... that.

134
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,869
I call it "The Get Gone".

135
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,001
Thank you so very much, Dr. Guy,

136
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:04,878
but I really think I'm good.

137
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,588
Well I insist that
you think about this,

138
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:08,757
because it's much healthier for you.

139
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:11,552
And if you're worried
about a little scarring,

140
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:13,345
<i>I've got a little
special cream for that.</i>

141
00:11:13,512 --> 00:11:16,429
Oh, I... yeah,
I appreciate the offer.

142
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:17,973
We'll even offer it half price.

143
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:21,143
-Thank you, that's very generous.
-I'll slice the cheese even more.

144
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:22,435
This is starting
to feel uncomfortable.

145
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:24,940
-Well, what if...
-She said no.

146
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:29,528
Okay.

147
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:32,322
Let's just do it
the old fashioned way,

148
00:11:33,323 --> 00:11:35,492
the more expensive way,

149
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,164
the less efficient way,
the less practical way,

150
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,751
and the much more painful way.

151
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:48,463
Now...

152
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:51,091
let's get started.

153
00:11:58,307 --> 00:11:59,349
Well, how was that?

154
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:02,060
I think you just caught
me by surprise a little bit.

155
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:04,188
-Well, you want to use the "Get Gone"?
-Oh, no!

156
00:12:15,824 --> 00:12:19,077
Wow, there's a little bit
more in there than I thought.

157
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:24,249
Okay, go get Clarence
to clean this mess up.

158
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,585
Thank you very much, Patty.

159
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:31,798
Hey Carol, today's Patty's last day.

160
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:35,219
-Can you believe that?
-Yeah, you already told me.

161
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:39,264
Clarence.

162
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:41,683
Sorry, guys, this dang bucket.

163
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,686
For the love of God,
can't you see I'm operating?

164
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:46,355
Every time this dang guy.

165
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,235
Patty, we are all excited now,
because Peter is our new intern.

166
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:54,321
Preston.

167
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:55,864
He's gonna take Patty's place.

168
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:58,990
We are so excited, because he's
gonna pop some life into this area.

169
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:01,620
-Aren't ya, boy?
-Yeah, sure.

170
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:04,206
Patty, let's let Preston
do the stitches today.

171
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:06,041
I know it's his first time,

172
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,041
but you're okay with
that, aren't you, Carol?

173
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,127
Um, I...

174
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:11,002
Well, you wouldn't
have to use stitches,

175
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:12,839
if you used "The Get Gone".

176
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:14,633
But, but...

177
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:54,589
Oh, I like that one too.

178
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:57,884
Patty, the patent examiners are
supposed to be here any minute

179
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,468
and Carol was supposed
to be our test subject,

180
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,803
but that didn't happen.

181
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:04,016
-So I was wanting to know,
if you guys would... -No!

182
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:05,434
No what?

183
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:08,645
-If you think I'm letting...
-I figured you'd back out.

184
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:10,937
-Good thing we got trusty Peyton.
-Preston!

185
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,482
-Preston.
-Well, what about you, boy?

186
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:14,359
You got anything against
saving people's lives.

187
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:16,778
I mean, I don't, I don't.

188
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:18,655
-I don't...
-You can do it.

189
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:20,365
I don't, I don't.

190
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:22,451
You can do it.

191
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:27,164
- I won't let you down, Doctor.
-That's what I like to hear.

192
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,875
Patty, go out and welcome
our guests to the front.

193
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,877
Let's find us a growth.

194
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,519
You're okay?

195
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:53,440
Well, it looks like
today's my last clay here.

196
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:56,109
At least one of us is
getting out of here alive.

197
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:58,445
I've got a bad feeling about this.

198
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,280
<i>What are you saying?</i>

199
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:04,326
-He's different.
-Like losing his mind?

200
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:07,788
He lost that a long time ago.

201
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:10,248
True.

202
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:18,799
Me?

203
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:21,426
-<i>No.</i>
-<i>Dang.</i>

204
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:46,201
That looks a little small.

205
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:48,370
I thought it was acne.

206
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:52,582
Do you have any other spots,
that don't know about?

207
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,418
None that I'm aware of.

208
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:56,128
<i>Ok.</i>

209
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:02,717
I'm gonna put some
treatment on this,

210
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:07,264
to make absolutely sure
we get the full potential

211
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:09,182
of "The Get Gone".

212
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:10,725
What do you mean?

213
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:13,562
I'm gonna grow this,
so that it gets bigger.

214
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:18,024
Small price to pay to get
you down the history books.

215
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:23,613
I just want to keep my job, Sir.

216
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,615
Well, keep it up.

217
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:28,535
You might not have to
worry about working again.

218
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,621
Heck, you might even get
paid if you're lucky.

219
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:34,458
Ow!

220
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:44,551
I don't think that you would listen.

221
00:16:44,718 --> 00:16:46,678
Well, this whole thing is wrong.

222
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:49,181
You are wrong.

223
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:53,560
Oh, hello Patricia.

224
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:56,771
It is so nice to see you again.

225
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:59,357
Della,... AI.

226
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,818
Thanks for coming in today.

227
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,568
Bill.

228
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,447
Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Patricia.

229
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:07,532
Oh, it's just Miss.

230
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:09,743
Pleasure to meet you, too.

231
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,914
Let's just get this thing
started and over with.

232
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:17,459
-Shall we?
-Me?

233
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:20,754
Right this way.

234
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:25,509
So what is different
about his machine this time?

235
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:28,220
He's making changes all the time.

236
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:29,721
Does it work?

237
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:32,599
-Last time it was a disaster.
-I'm sure he's made improvements.

238
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:35,602
Well, I hope so because
this is his last chance.

239
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:38,146
Patricia, can you explain the device?

240
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:42,901
The machine is supposed to make skin
removal operations <i>less</i> painful,

241
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:44,903
more efficient, and affordable.

242
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:49,155
Well, that could, that's it, that could
cut down the use of metal tools

243
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:51,201
and certain infections.
I mean it would dramatically...

244
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:54,371
raise the health code scores up...
for all general practices.

245
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:56,498
That's the idea.

246
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:04,464
Oh my gosh.

247
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:07,259
It is so good to see you again.

248
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:09,344
Thank you all so much coming.

249
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:11,302
-Guy.
-It means the world to me,

250
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:13,139
from the bottom of my heart.

251
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:16,184
But I do have
some terrible news today.

252
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:19,145
It's Patty's last day.

253
00:18:20,397 --> 00:18:22,774
My condolences to Patricia,

254
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:24,818
but we need
to get this thing moving,

255
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:27,070
because we need to get out of here.

256
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:31,030
-I thought we had all morning.
-No no, we talked about this.

257
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:32,701
-We did.
-More than twice.

258
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:34,869
One hour and we are out.

259
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:36,955
-Out the door.
- I was just gonna say.

260
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:39,416
This
all like last

261
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:43,003
-Not like last time.
-The clock starts...

262
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:46,298
now.

263
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:47,841
Okay.

264
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,011
Well this new version of "The Get Gone"

265
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:55,890
works so well, that our
trusty intern here, Presto,

266
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:59,436
has volunteered
to be our patient today.

267
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:03,106
He'll be explaining...
the machine.

268
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,400
-Presto?
-Yeah, ah...

269
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:08,445
-Presto, just read it.
- Yes, this...

270
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,950
This

271
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,453
an interstellar processor,

272
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,913
a warp combabulator.

273
00:19:19,164 --> 00:19:21,249
-A warp what?
-Combabulator.

274
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,544
And a thermite compactor.

275
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:28,965
You wanna follow
along a little bit more'?

276
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:33,178
<i>Just read this,
it's great information.</i>

277
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:44,105
This

278
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:47,317
-<i>Yes.</i>
-<i>This...</i>

279
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:49,361
I'm gonna do it again.
This...

280
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:51,905
This new unit features a patented.

281
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:54,366
That's not patented yet.

282
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,494
Look, this is "The Get Gone",

283
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:02,248
patented vulcanized, hypervacuum.

284
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:03,750
Not patented.

285
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,544
That sucks the infected
area down the glide tube

286
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:08,838
into the patented antinuclear sack.

287
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:10,674
-It's not patented.
-It's not patented.

288
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:13,551
Pending. Look,
I got to work on this machine.

289
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,304
Patty, just read this.

290
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:37,951
Why get upset,
when you can got "Get Gone".

291
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:43,248
When you got a cyst as
big as a fist, "Get Gone".

292
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:47,711
When you got a growth
you've grown to loathe, "Get Gone".

293
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:50,672
That was amazing.
Thank you so much, Patty.

294
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,842
-She really wanted to do it.
-No I didn't.

295
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:56,886
This is the area,
we'll be working on today.

296
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:59,639
That thing's a lot
smaller than last time.

297
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:01,266
Much smaller.

298
00:21:01,474 --> 00:21:03,935
I'm not getting a patent on a cyst.

299
00:21:04,227 --> 00:21:06,771
We just want to see it
work on something larger.

300
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:09,399
I mean, you can remove
that with tweezers.

301
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,609
<i>This isn't life threatening.</i>

302
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:13,194
Okay, let's talk about the machine.

303
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:15,613
Let's talk about the damn machine!

304
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:28,168
Doctor, you might want
to give it a second before.

305
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:33,548
-What's happening?
-I must've held the buttons too long.

306
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:37,427
No, your machine
went kaputz on its own.

307
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:39,721
It's a failure again, Doc.

308
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:42,223
Listen, we're out of here.
I don't have time for this.

309
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,852
And I don't want to get any more
your sob story letters, we're done.

310
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:48,062
The power converter
needs a nuclear fuse

311
00:21:48,313 --> 00:21:51,107
and we still have 45 minutes.

312
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:54,736
-We are outta here.
-Look, you're wasting time now.

313
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,446
We really need to go.

314
00:21:56,613 --> 00:22:00,033
I pay my damn taxes and
I'm gonna get my 45 minutes.

315
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:02,660
Patty, take them
next door to the diner.

316
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:07,624
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

317
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:14,464
Sorry about that.

318
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:18,885
Well, I'm not gonna
say "no" to a free lunch.

319
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:41,950
<i>I remember this place from last time.</i>

320
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,327
Guess this trip
won't be a total bust.

321
00:22:45,203 --> 00:22:46,621
The sausage is great.

322
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,581
Biscuits and gravy,
that's what I'm doing.

323
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,291
I wonder, if they have grits.

324
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,752
-Gross.
-What, I've never tried grits before.

325
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,420
Consider yourself lucky.

326
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:56,923
I'll have grits with you, Bill.

327
00:22:57,382 --> 00:22:58,883
Of course, you do.

328
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:16,276
-What can I get for you guys?
-We're sort of in a rush.

329
00:23:16,484 --> 00:23:18,695
We need one order
of B and G's, fruit,

330
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:20,945
two orders of grits, sausage,

331
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:22,907
and two eggs sunny side
up and four coffees.

332
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,493
-Thank you.
-Wow.

333
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:27,579
Aren't you special?

334
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,211
Sorry that Dr. Guy's being
a little bit cranky today,

335
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:37,171
but I think he's just nervous.

336
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:40,091
-It's your last day, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

337
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:42,343
Bet you're happy.

338
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:45,221
So what are you gonna do now?

339
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:47,807
I might start selling
my own jewelry.

340
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:49,142
You make jewelry?

341
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,352
I'd love to see
something you've designed.

342
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:54,981
Dr. Guy's wearing a copper
bracelet around his wrist.

343
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:56,941
I made it for him.

344
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,235
I'll check it out.

345
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,615
So, you're getting
out of the health field.

346
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:06,200
Well, I might go back someday.

347
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:09,078
Sometimes a change of
scenery does wonders.

348
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:11,372
I think that's really smart.

349
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:13,833
Thank you, Bill.

350
00:24:28,222 --> 00:24:32,560
So, Patricia, is there
anything you want to tell us

351
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:33,937
before we go back over?

352
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:38,399
I mean, Guy's been throwing himself
into this machine for years.

353
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:40,483
And frankly I've never
seen a need for it.

354
00:24:40,485 --> 00:24:42,153
Never seen a need for it,

355
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,280
especially after what
happened to you the last time.

356
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,574
Yeah, how's your arm?

357
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:49,535
Couldn't be better, thanks.

358
00:24:49,786 --> 00:24:51,079
Wait, what happened?

359
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:54,457
-Well, if you don't mind me asking.
-Maybe we shouldn't bring it up.

360
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,542
No, it's fine, really.

361
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:59,045
Last time Dr. Guy got a
little bit too excited

362
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:01,923
during the test and he
turned the power up too high.

363
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:04,634
Luckily, the machine turned
off after a few moments.

364
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:08,137
Did that laser incision
leave any scarring?

365
00:25:09,472 --> 00:25:11,516
No, not at all.

366
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,184
Oh, did I tell you the
Dr. Guy began working

367
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:18,022
on an ointment, that will
rejuvenate damaged cells?

368
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:20,650
Rejuvenate damage cells?

369
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:23,319
We're gonna get a chance
to see that today?

370
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:25,947
No, that's definitely not ready yet.

371
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,085
<i>They wanted it bigger.</i>

372
00:25:39,293 --> 00:25:41,004
<i>They wanted it bigger!</i>

373
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:43,631
<i>Dr. Guy?</i>

374
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:46,884
<i>What are you doing?</i>

375
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:50,304
I'm getting my damn patent.

376
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,897
That was delicious.

377
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:02,817
Shall we?

378
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:05,069
We don't have much time left.

379
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:06,863
Oh, don't worry about the check.

380
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,490
-It's on Dr. Guy.
-Are you sure?

381
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:10,950
Thank you.

382
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:15,955
You know Patricia, since
this is your last day and all,

383
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:18,041
I think it's safe for me to say,
that I think...

384
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,960
I always thought Dr. Guy
was a little crazy.

385
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:24,172
I mean, what kind of guy obsesses
over a machine like that?

386
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,714
I know, I mean we see a
lot of machines in our line,

387
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:27,882
don't we, Della?

388
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:30,553
We see a lot of machines,
mostly food related,

389
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,639
-I'll tell you what, this thing is...
-Bizarre.

390
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:36,392
-Bizarre, never seen anything like it.
-Weirdest thing I've ever seen.

391
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,102
-Well, you know what they say,

392
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:39,852
it takes a crazy person to...

393
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:43,024
-Change the world.
-Who the hell says that?

394
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,459
Well, I've been here for an eternity.

395
00:27:01,626 --> 00:27:03,211
Your appointment is at two o'clock.

396
00:27:03,377 --> 00:27:04,545
It's 12:20.

397
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:06,631
That's not even early,
that's just dumb.

398
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:08,841
I need this thing off me now,

399
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:12,345
or else I'm gonna
walk out of here now.

400
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,181
Thank goodness! Ready?

401
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:16,849
-No.

402
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:19,894
- No!

403
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,061
Preston?

404
00:28:05,773 --> 00:28:07,358
Are you okay?

405
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:10,778
Is something wrong?

406
00:28:12,363 --> 00:28:14,740
That's who I feel.
Now where's my lunch?

407
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:17,326
What?

408
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:20,371
My stomach's so dang empty.

409
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:23,332
Where is it?

410
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:26,752
-I didn't know...
-Get on with it, what?

411
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:29,003
I didn't know you wanted
me to bring your lunch.

412
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:30,673
-Didn't know?
-No.

413
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:33,885
You didn't know, did you?

414
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,847
You didn't know.

415
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:39,724
Well, don't worry.

416
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,727
I'm just fine.

417
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:44,854
Last day.

418
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:46,814
Gonna miss you so much.

419
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:51,152
Well, well, well.

420
00:28:52,153 --> 00:28:54,780
I hope you all had a nice lunch,
'cause you know what?

421
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:57,241
I didn't get one.

422
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:01,704
But today is the day,
'cause you're gonna come here

423
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:04,290
and see what you've
all been waiting for.

424
00:29:04,665 --> 00:29:06,542
Patty?

425
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:10,171
Please show our
guests to their seats.

426
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:12,632
Patty, get to it.

427
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:15,509
Guy, you got five minutes
and we are out of here.

428
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:17,345
Out the door.

429
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:20,806
Well, great!

430
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:24,060
Great!

431
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:27,605
Are you okay with that?
Five minutes?

432
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:34,028
Is it big enough... now?

433
00:29:40,368 --> 00:29:41,786
What is it?

434
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:52,255
What is it?

435
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:56,050
- Patty?
-Uh, huh?

436
00:29:57,843 --> 00:29:59,178
Do the blessing.

437
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:01,889
Do the blessing, Patty.

438
00:30:02,181 --> 00:30:03,140
Okay.

439
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:08,145
Do the blessing.
Do the song blessing quickly!

440
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:15,486
(Patricia humming)
-Quiet, quiet.

441
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:29,709
Stop it!

442
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:16,464
As you can see,...
the laser is working.

443
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:19,550
Pugsley, how does it feel?

444
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:21,802
It hurts.

445
00:31:22,636 --> 00:31:26,766
Great!
I'm going to turn it up to three.

446
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:38,152
You have one minute left, Guy.

447
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:53,084
Turn it off!

448
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,337
-<i>Turn that thing off!</i>
-Doctor!

449
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:12,520
It's stuck to the center.
Turn it off!

450
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:18,150
No!

451
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,908
Do something, do something!

452
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:45,177
Oh my God!

453
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:49,432
Time's up, Guy.
We're out of here!

454
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,309
This time I'm shutting
you down for good.

455
00:33:45,988 --> 00:33:47,490
What have you done?

456
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:49,992
You know, it wasn't ready.

457
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:59,627
I'm getting that patent.

458
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:24,902
What the?

459
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:11,699
That's it, I'm outta here.

460
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:13,409
Adios.

461
00:35:26,714 --> 00:35:27,881
Ew!

462
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:40,185
It's gone.
It's gone!

463
00:35:47,526 --> 00:35:49,820
Is this on the doors too?

464
00:35:52,906 --> 00:35:55,284
-Just hold on, Patty.
-But why?

465
00:35:57,536 --> 00:36:01,707
Just I did a little lockdown
procedure, that's all.

466
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:05,127
-With a way out?
-Just relax, Patty.

467
00:36:07,129 --> 00:36:09,298
When the clock hits five, I'm out.

468
00:36:09,923 --> 00:36:11,592
Hey!

469
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:13,594
Hey, hey I need some help here.

470
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:15,512
Please can you help me?

471
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,807
Come and give me some help.
Look, it's not doing anything.

472
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:21,143
It's just like sitting there.

473
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,896
This is a doctor's office, right?

474
00:36:24,063 --> 00:36:26,398
Because it's your specialty, right?

475
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:29,109
Come on, help me!

476
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:31,612
Come on, help, I'll do anything!

477
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:32,946
Your patent!

478
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:35,491
-The patent?
-Yes, I'll give you your patent.

479
00:36:35,658 --> 00:36:37,451
-Patent?
-Help me.

480
00:36:38,035 --> 00:36:40,120
Help me.
You gotta help me!

481
00:36:40,287 --> 00:36:41,789
Come on!

482
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:47,878
-Clarence, where did you get that?
-I'm sorry.

483
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:49,713
Thought I was gonna be ready.

484
00:36:50,422 --> 00:36:51,924
All the doors and
windows locked down?

485
00:36:52,132 --> 00:36:54,385
- Looks like it.
-We are not breaking through that metal.

486
00:36:54,635 --> 00:36:56,470
It is made for nuclear fallout shelter.

487
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,681
-He didn't build an exit?
-I don't know.

488
00:36:59,098 --> 00:37:01,475
-You're kiddin' me?
-What about the monster lady?

489
00:37:01,642 --> 00:37:03,435
-You want me to shoot her?
-No!

490
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:05,312
We just need to
get that cyst off her.

491
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:07,564
It's just a cyst.
I think... I hope.

492
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,443
Let's go!

493
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:26,083
Put that down.

494
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,625
-I need y'all's help. -Trust him?
-I'm not going in there, you can.

495
00:38:10,627 --> 00:38:12,129
Come on.
You're good.

496
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:13,839
- We have to save him.
- No, I ain't going.

497
00:38:14,006 --> 00:38:15,507
Okay, I'm going in.

498
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:18,218
-I need your help.
-I'm not, I'm not go.

499
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:20,387
We going in here?

500
00:38:20,804 --> 00:38:22,306
Come on!

501
00:38:31,398 --> 00:38:32,608
Oh!

502
00:38:33,442 --> 00:38:36,445
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...

503
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:39,448
"The Get Gone" is ready.

504
00:38:39,698 --> 00:38:42,117
-It's the only way.
- <i>Anything...</i>

505
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:44,912
anything, I'll give you your patent.

506
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,333
Please, just get
that thing off of me.

507
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,253
-Can't we just cut it off?
-Oh God, that is so stupid.

508
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,297
Where'd you come up with that idea?

509
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:59,468
That's why I'm the doctor
and you're the receptionist.

510
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:05,390
Really, you want to laser it off?

511
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:07,226
Exactly.

512
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:09,645
No, please.
Please God, don't do that.

513
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:11,688
Please, no.

514
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,403
Am I dead?

515
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:20,739
Clarence, that's not going to...

516
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:27,579
Is it dead?

517
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:32,543
Are you gonna clean that up?

518
00:39:34,586 --> 00:39:35,712
We're screwed.

519
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:39,299
Yeah, she hadn't even
given us a patent yet.

520
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:41,677
Let's get that thing off.

521
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,556
Just be careful this time.

522
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:52,938
Vacuum off, laser on.

523
00:39:53,146 --> 00:39:55,023
Let's blast this thing.

524
00:40:18,797 --> 00:40:20,299
Oh, thank God.

525
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,594
It worked.

526
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:25,804
It worked!

527
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:28,015
Oh, thank God.

528
00:40:32,603 --> 00:40:34,438
<i>It worked.</i>

529
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:36,106
It worked.

530
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:38,106
Oh Dr. Guy, as soon
as I get out of here,

531
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:40,402
I am gonna sign
that patent paperwork.

532
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:41,945
You mean it?

533
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:43,906
As I live and breathe.

534
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:56,877
It worked!

535
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:00,672
Shut your stupid mouth.

536
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:02,714
People are dead right now.

537
00:41:02,716 --> 00:41:05,135
This is no time to
think about your patent.

538
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:08,055
Just tryin' to be positive.

539
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:09,848
I think we made it angry.

540
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:12,601
We need to trap it and
come up with a plan.

541
00:41:19,232 --> 00:41:21,276
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

542
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:24,196
-You get her?
-Yeah, locked her in the closet.

543
00:41:25,364 --> 00:41:26,490
Good work, Clarence.

544
00:41:26,657 --> 00:41:29,368
Not sure I should have
put her in there, but it's all right.

545
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,912
It's all right.

546
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:35,624
-Is there a problem?
-No, no, no problem.

547
00:41:35,874 --> 00:41:37,459
Let's just get out of here.

548
00:41:39,002 --> 00:41:40,545
Is there an exit?

549
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:45,217
-<i>Not exactly.</i>
-<i>What does that mean?</i>

550
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:47,052
It means no!

551
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:50,428
You got any dynamite
or anything else in here

552
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,432
that we don't know about,
that might actually help.

553
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:55,185
The laser might be
able to melt the door.

554
00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:57,062
It's not big enough.

555
00:41:59,606 --> 00:42:01,191
Couldn't we amplify it?

556
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:12,828
<i>What the hell?</i>

557
00:42:15,497 --> 00:42:17,374
What the hell?

558
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:20,043
What is this noise?

559
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:47,779
I have a confession.

560
00:42:49,948 --> 00:42:51,867
I may have been stashing

561
00:42:52,075 --> 00:42:56,788
some sharp metallic
utensils in that closet.

562
00:42:57,372 --> 00:42:58,540
Stashing?

563
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,002
Amassing might be a better word.

564
00:43:02,294 --> 00:43:04,838
That's why I've been having
to buy scalpels every week.

565
00:43:05,464 --> 00:43:06,755
Yeah, I'm a sculptor.

566
00:43:06,757 --> 00:43:09,301
You know how
expensive metal supplies are.

567
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:10,927
You're fired.

568
00:43:12,471 --> 00:43:15,432
If Patricia was leaving,
I was gonna quit anyways.

569
00:43:22,272 --> 00:43:23,899
<i>Oh, no!</i>

570
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:21,039
Hey!

571
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:25,168
-Where's Clarence?
- Probably just sculpting.

572
00:44:33,385 --> 00:44:34,427
No!

573
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:43,728
What's happening?

574
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:47,149
I don't know!

575
00:44:47,315 --> 00:44:50,152
Y'all just calm down.
It'll be fine.

576
00:45:02,038 --> 00:45:03,623
I think it's gone.

577
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:06,960
You sure?

578
00:45:23,727 --> 00:45:26,146
-Someone's out there.
-Who?

579
00:45:27,022 --> 00:45:28,648
Darkness.

580
00:45:29,566 --> 00:45:31,735
-Bill?
-Patricia?

581
00:45:31,943 --> 00:45:34,070
Patricia, is that you?

582
00:45:35,322 --> 00:45:38,450
-What are you doing?
-You're not going out there.

583
00:45:38,617 --> 00:45:39,993
I can't see.

584
00:45:40,285 --> 00:45:43,413
Let me go, I'm not
going to let him die.

585
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,165
He's already dead.

586
00:45:45,332 --> 00:45:47,667
It's a cyst monster
acting like Bill.

587
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,669
Bill!?

588
00:45:51,922 --> 00:45:53,340
Bill!

589
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:57,260
Okay, fine!

590
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:27,040
You're the worst doctor ever!

591
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,044
You're the worst nurse ever!

592
00:46:32,796 --> 00:46:35,090
This is the worst job,
I ever had.

593
00:46:39,594 --> 00:46:42,013
Well good luck getting
a referral from me.

594
00:46:57,904 --> 00:47:00,115
You're not leavin' me!

595
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:06,204
Ooh!

596
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,169
-I love you!
-I hate you!

597
00:47:15,338 --> 00:47:16,798
Damn!

598
00:47:26,516 --> 00:47:27,851
<i>Patricia?</i>

599
00:47:28,018 --> 00:47:29,394
Patricia, are you in there?

600
00:47:29,644 --> 00:47:31,313
Hell, I'll do it.

601
00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:32,981
I'm coming to get you.

602
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:01,843
If y'all wouldn't have been fighting,
we probably could have saved him.

603
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:05,138
-It's her fault.
-What are gonna do now?

604
00:48:05,805 --> 00:48:07,432
We're gonna kill that thing.

605
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,185
If we stay in this room any longer,
y'all are gonna kill each other.

606
00:48:10,352 --> 00:48:11,770
Probably.

607
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:13,229
How about we go up front,

608
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:15,273
get as far away from
that thing as possible?

609
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,442
I already told her I love her,
I'm not going out there.

610
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:19,233
-Stop it!
-Just shut up,

611
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:21,279
I'm tired of hearing your mouth.

612
00:48:22,906 --> 00:48:25,700
You're sure, there's no way
to reverse the lockdown?

613
00:48:26,701 --> 00:48:29,704
-Only in case of emergencies.
- What?

614
00:48:30,288 --> 00:48:32,415
Fine, there's a breaker in
the base with a reversal switch,

615
00:48:32,582 --> 00:48:34,457
but I'm not going down there.
The doors don't work.

616
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:35,919
I don't know,
what else is down there.

617
00:48:36,127 --> 00:48:37,210
Oh, wait.

618
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:40,590
So if I pull that switch,
we can get out of here'?

619
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,718
Of course.
I'm not an idiot.

620
00:48:45,762 --> 00:48:47,847
All right.
I'll go down.

621
00:48:48,014 --> 00:48:49,974
And after I hit that
switch, I'll come back up.

622
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:53,353
So please, Tammie, find a way
to distract the cyst for our exit.

623
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,356
-Got it.
-Patty, if you need my help.

624
00:49:54,956 --> 00:49:56,583
Oh my God.

625
00:51:56,369 --> 00:51:58,037
Oh God!

626
00:54:00,576 --> 00:54:02,245
You should go check on her.

627
00:54:02,704 --> 00:54:06,874
-She'll be fine.
-If you really love her, you should go.

628
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,878
I only said that to win the fight.

629
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:14,465
Look, you can't lie to me.

630
00:54:14,632 --> 00:54:16,092
I know what's going on.

631
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:19,262
You're mad at her for leaving,
and this is just payback.

632
00:54:19,512 --> 00:54:21,723
That's preposterous.

633
00:54:41,451 --> 00:54:43,035
Tammie?

634
00:54:54,046 --> 00:54:55,840
Go away!

635
00:54:56,215 --> 00:54:58,634
-You got a plan?
-Not yet.

636
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:04,849
You're hurt, aren't you?

637
00:55:08,102 --> 00:55:10,938
Maybe it just
wants to be wanted...

638
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:14,150
or loved.

639
00:55:14,317 --> 00:55:15,526
What?

640
00:55:17,695 --> 00:55:19,197
Come here, cyst.

641
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,034
I know how you feel.

642
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:25,495
All those days you
just want some loving

643
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:27,538
and no one wants you clinging on.

644
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:29,540
I'm clinging too

645
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:32,460
It just means we care a
little bit more than others.

646
00:55:32,752 --> 00:55:34,837
Tammie, you know,
that's a bad idea.

647
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:37,256
No, Tammie.
No!

648
00:55:37,507 --> 00:55:40,510
It's okay,
he's not gonna hurt me.

649
00:55:40,968 --> 00:55:42,887
I can see it in his eye.

650
00:55:59,737 --> 00:56:01,489
You're not,
what they think you are.

651
00:56:01,697 --> 00:56:03,282
Tammie.

652
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:05,535
Come here, baby.

653
00:56:13,709 --> 00:56:16,504
See? It's working.

654
00:56:17,797 --> 00:56:19,757
A little closer.

655
00:56:26,472 --> 00:56:28,391
Tammie, no!

656
00:56:29,225 --> 00:56:31,769
No!

657
00:56:35,606 --> 00:56:37,692
No, fuckin' no!

658
00:56:48,035 --> 00:56:49,410
-Let me go!
-No!

659
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:51,038
Let me go!

660
00:57:03,342 --> 00:57:04,635
Come!

661
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:12,310
"The Get Gone" is ready.
Let's use it.

662
00:57:12,518 --> 00:57:14,854
But we have to find
a way to amplify the laser

663
00:57:15,021 --> 00:57:16,314
and destroy the cyst.

664
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,608
Well, all the tools are inside it.

665
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,820
-What about your examiner?
-It's over there in the cabinet.

666
00:57:25,615 --> 00:57:28,034
When the laser hits it,
it will magnify the beam.

667
00:57:28,284 --> 00:57:31,621
-That can work.
- Yes, it must work.

668
00:57:43,215 --> 00:57:46,218
-Patty?
-Yes?

669
00:57:47,053 --> 00:57:49,138
Have you always hated me?

670
00:57:49,805 --> 00:57:53,851
No, it just took me so long
to find out who you really are.

671
00:58:03,444 --> 00:58:05,780
<i>It's coming!</i>

672
00:58:07,156 --> 00:58:08,991
One of us will have
to be in here with it.

673
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:11,160
We can work this out.

674
00:58:11,494 --> 00:58:12,912
I'm sure we can.

675
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:22,713
Open the door!

676
00:58:23,631 --> 00:58:26,384
Open the door, it's stuck!

677
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:38,562
Last day.

678
00:58:39,021 --> 00:58:41,399
I'll miss you so much.

679
00:58:43,776 --> 00:58:46,737
No! No, please!

680
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:54,245
Looks like you're gonna be
out of here by five after all.

681
01:00:25,002 --> 01:00:26,879
Oh, no!

682
01:01:58,095 --> 01:01:59,054
Ah!

683
01:02:20,367 --> 01:02:21,869
Give that back!

684
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:24,038
I insist!

685
01:03:00,783 --> 01:03:02,117
Get gone!

686
01:08:42,673 --> 01:08:45,110
