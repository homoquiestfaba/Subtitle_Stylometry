1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,992
...the fans at Ebbets Field, by jumping all
over their cross-town rivals, the Yankees...

2
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:21,128
...and their 1 7-game winner,
""Bullet"" Bob Hurley...

3
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:25,072
...for eight runs, to gain their first victory
in the Subway Series.

4
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,643
The Dodgers were led by Roy Campanella...

5
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:31,147
...who cranked three hits
and drove in three runs.

6
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,747
It"s a fIuke. Got to be a fIuke.
Them bums are geriatrics.

7
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:40,651
Robinson"s the youngest,
and he"s going on 65!

8
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,182
Huh, BiIIy?

9
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:47,157
...Dodgers" manager Walt Alston
refused to panic...

10
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,859
...starting Johnny Podres...

11
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,730
They better start Whitey tonight.

12
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:53,463
Yeah.

13
00:00:53,536 --> 00:00:56,061
...the young lefty
cruised through nine easy innings...

14
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,802
Yeah, Johnny Podres.
'"Johnny-come-IateIy'" more Iike.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,778
Bread rises faster than his fastbaII.

16
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:04,671
Happy birthday, Johnny!

17
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:11,976
l"m Mike Wallace with a sensational
discovery for better baking and frying.

18
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:13,420
lt"s Golden Fluffo....

19
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:16,651
StiII, you have to give him some credit,
this Podres kid.

20
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:19,354
It couIdn"t have been too easy for him,
right?

21
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,596
What with the pressure and aII....

22
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,330
You Iook Iike a miIIion.

23
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,704
There. Take a Iook.

24
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,016
Now Iisten. It takes peopIe
a wee bit Ionger to warm up to you.

25
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:48,079
Just be patient. Patient and persistent.

26
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:52,751
You"re gonna be great.

27
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:05,700
And those cases, they"re heavy.

28
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:09,267
HeII, a Iot of the guys
are carrying two cases with them.

29
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:13,014
I admire your determination, but....

30
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:14,910
And the waIking....

31
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:18,652
You understand what I"m getting at?

32
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,521
I just don"t see any way this can work.

33
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,851
I"m sorry.

34
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,354
Thanks for coming in.

35
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,785
AII the October statements.

36
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,584
Mr. Hernandez.

37
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:03,426
Give me your worst route.

38
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:08,526
Give me the area nobody wants.

39
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,132
What have you got to Iose?

40
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,672
If I can seII it, you"re a hero.

41
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,072
Mr. Porter, Iet"s be honest.
This is a physicaIIy demanding job...

42
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,642
...and you"re crippIed. And I don"t see how--

43
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:26,187
What?

44
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,175
Praise the Lord.

45
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:02,424
Nervous?

46
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:03,883
Yeah.

47
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,859
Nuts, I was gonna make you a Iunch.

48
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,726
No!

49
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:12,963
Good for me.

50
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:15,095
I guess I"m a IittIe nervous, too.

51
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:16,569
I guess you are.

52
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:19,875
What are you waiting for?
Them to come to the car?

53
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:21,035
Go seII some soap.

54
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,808
-Meet you here at 5:00?
-AII right.

55
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:12,220
"Morning.

56
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,926
May I be candid with you?

57
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:19,234
The greatest vaIue in our cataIogue...

58
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:22,294
...is the doubIe-strength vaniIIa extract.

59
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,600
It comes in the four-ounce, six-ounce....

60
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:26,972
That"s right!

61
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:30,312
I toId you I"d caII the cops.

62
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,114
My God! Look what they"re doing. Larry!

63
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:35,241
We got a caII....

64
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:36,808
Officer, I"ve done the research.

65
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:39,081
It"s hanging over our property,
and the Iaw says--

66
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:40,850
Do you see my feet? That"s pine tar.

67
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,790
I"ve got white carpeting.
Now I"ve got a sticky green path...

68
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,157
...from the front door to--

69
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:47,696
Look where your front door is,
Iook where the tree is.

70
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,391
-Look what they"ve done!
-CaIm down.

71
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,025
What kind of peopIe wouId do this?
They"ve butchered it!

72
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,159
WiII you stop?

73
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:03,374
I have tried gasoIine and turpentine,
and it smeIIs Iike a garage.

74
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,999
Good morning.

75
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:32,868
My name is BiII Porter...

76
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:37,203
...and I wouId Iike to take a moment
of your time to teII you...

77
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,217
...about some of the many
fine Watkins products avaiIabIe.

78
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:48,220
Of course, they aII come
with a 100 percent money back guarantee.

79
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,120
I don"t think so.

80
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:54,354
Who is it?

81
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,191
Some charity guy.

82
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,549
I mean it, you got to get ready to go, now.

83
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:16,414
Don"t Iet the dog out.

84
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,819
My name is BiII Porter and I was--

85
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:22,414
Peanut, wouId you shut the heII up?
Get back. Sit!

86
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,625
Sheri, wiII you get your damn dog?
I swear to God. What?

87
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:29,328
My name is BiII Porter...

88
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:33,601
...and I was wondering
if I couId take a moment of your time...

89
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,567
...to show you some
of the many fine Watkins products--

90
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,006
Joey, I toId you to put your pants on.

91
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,346
I once had a fish named Joey.

92
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,048
Grab him, wouId you?

93
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,480
Sheri, your damn dog got out. Damn it!

94
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:54,518
I"m in the bathroom!

95
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:57,320
Peanut! Come here. Peanut!

96
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:01,096
May I be candid with you?

97
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:05,331
The greatest vaIue in our cataIogue...

98
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:08,862
...is the doubIe-strength vaniIIa extract.

99
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:13,302
It comes in the four, eight,
and 12-ounce sizes.

100
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,810
ObviousIy, the 12-ounce is the best vaIue.

101
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:22,077
Look, I reaIIy don"t need anything...

102
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,681
...but I respect what you"re doing so much.

103
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,285
I"d Iike to heIp you.

104
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,225
PIease, take it.

105
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:39,961
I don"t need charity.

106
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,905
But you need spot remover.
Look at your couch, it"s appaIIing.

107
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,443
No soIicitors, sir.

108
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,646
I"m from the Watkins Company.

109
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:26,909
What? No soIicitors, sir.

110
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:27,979
What?

111
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,181
What?

112
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,018
I"m from the Watkins Company.

113
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:35,580
No. RuIes, sir!

114
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:44,893
What do you want?

115
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:48,393
I don"t know, I"m tired of egg saIad.

116
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:54,105
Here, Iet me get that for you.

117
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:55,840
Thanks.

118
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:07,086
May I be candid with you?

119
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,382
Yes.

120
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,255
No. Candid. May I be candid?

121
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,425
AbsoIuteIy.

122
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,592
In my experience, the greatest vaIue...

123
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,530
...in our cataIogue
is the tripIe-action Iaundry detergent.

124
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:29,010
And at $#.95 a box...

125
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:32,580
...you can see what a great saving that is.

126
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,317
How many may I put you down for?

127
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:39,011
Two.

128
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:41,745
ReaIIy?

129
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,949
And a Iarge bIeach.

130
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,347
May I ask you to fiII in the order for me?

131
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:10,210
Of course.

132
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,078
WouId you Iike a drink?

133
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:14,580
Thank you.

134
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,763
I"m sorry, I put a IittIe vodka in there.
Is it too much for you?

135
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,406
I probabIy shouIdn"t.

136
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:37,205
I waIk Iike a drunken saiIor as it is.

137
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,719
I wouIdn"t feeI good about myseIf...

138
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,288
...if I didn"t teII you about
our fabric softener.

139
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,038
I must have waIked 10 miIes today.

140
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:15,047
Now, BiIIy, don"t push yourseIf so hard.

141
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:17,142
You must be patient. You can"t expect--

142
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:18,277
I made a saIe.

143
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,055
You did?

144
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:21,282
Yeah!

145
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,087
AImost $50.

146
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:29,521
See, you can do anything.

147
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:30,860
I can do this.

148
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,230
I know you can.

149
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:36,299
I made $4.25 today...

150
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:39,398
...and I"m gonna bIow every penny of it.

151
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:42,877
I"m taking you out on the town.

152
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:53,877
...I took a sip, it was vodka.

153
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,784
What did you do?

154
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,622
What couId I do? I swaIIowed it!

155
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:09,430
BiIIy, this is for you.

156
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,636
It being your first day.

157
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,082
Dad"s watch.

158
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,354
'"Dad"s watch.'"

159
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:34,152
Quit it.

160
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:38,289
They gave it to him in the Grand BaIIroom,
the Drake HoteI.

161
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,300
He doesn"t care. He"s a retard.

162
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:41,629
How do you know?

163
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:45,196
I bought a dress for $2#.
Your father nearIy had a heart attack.

164
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:48,837
Chicago was aII Iit up.

165
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:50,607
Excuse me.

166
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:52,647
CouId I borrow your ketchup, pIease?

167
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:53,841
Yeah, sure.

168
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:59,648
I"m so sorry.
I must be a retard or something.

169
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:05,319
-I toId you not to caII him a retard.
-What are you Iaughing at?

170
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,953
And the WorId"s Fair.
Peterson had a dispIay there.

171
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:12,091
Your dad was top saIesman
three years running.

172
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,569
He was an amazing saIesman.

173
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,959
Amazing.

174
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:18,570
He couId seII you the ring
off your own finger.

175
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:23,806
And what a handsome man.

176
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,840
What a time we had.

177
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,809
He was a very handsome man.

178
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:34,852
And you Iook just Iike him.

179
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:46,934
My point in telling you this long story
is that if anyone should ever call you...

180
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:49,937
...and say, ""ls Peter Rabbit there?""
don"t hang up, it"s me.

181
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,402
So l"ve had many ups and downs
in show business.

182
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,034
What are you watching?

183
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:59,410
I don"t know, but he"s funny. Who is that?

184
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,777
It"s Jack Paar.

185
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,915
He Iooks different.
It must be his hair or something.

186
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,977
Where are my gIasses?

187
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:11,117
I"m going to bed. I"m a working man now.

188
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,066
Excuse me, working man,
pick up that gIass.

189
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:20,828
I Iet the servants go earIy tonight.

190
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,814
I can see the tremendous effort
you"re putting into this.

191
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:40,918
I know it can"t be easy,
but you"re not even cIose....

192
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,385
It"s onIy been four days.

193
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:47,293
I understand, but the average....
You"re gonna have to hit at Ieast--

194
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,923
I"m buiIding. It takes time.

195
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,296
I know that, but--

196
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,830
Just give me to the end of the month.

197
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,672
We had a compIaint.

198
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:04,508
From a woman on Chestnut Street.
She said you scared her IittIe boy.

199
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,742
You can see my probIem.

200
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:16,553
Hi! My name is LyIe!

201
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,453
You can caII me LyIe or GIyIe or Mr. PyIe.

202
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:25,358
But, whatever you do, don"t smiIe.

203
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,465
You better not smiIe.

204
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:28,764
Who is it, Joey?

205
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,201
Mr. PyIe.

206
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,571
Who?

207
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:33,736
Mr. PyIe.

208
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:43,308
What the heII. Come on in.

209
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:47,615
This is reaIIy a IoveIy home.

210
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,637
Mom?

211
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:26,619
Mother?

212
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,693
Wanna go to a few more houses?

213
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:34,759
Let"s go. What are you gonna say?

214
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:38,471
Oh, I can teII, Iook at that hat.

215
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,741
Mrs. Warren, have you seen my mother?

216
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:44,402
No. Not today.

217
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:54,819
No, she is missing. You don"t understand.

218
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,755
I don"t know. I was at work.

219
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:01,823
At work!

220
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:09,898
How Iong do we have to wait
before we can fiIe the--

221
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:13,263
HoId on.

222
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,449
Thank you very much. I"m fine.

223
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,784
I"II waIk you, ma"am.

224
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,256
No, it"s aII right.
You don"t have to see me in.

225
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:35,120
They said you were on Washington Street.

226
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,392
What were you doing over there?

227
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:41,299
Just some shopping. I wanted some shoes.
Did you eat?

228
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,403
There aren"t any shoe stores
on Washington Street.

229
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,935
I got turned around, and it got dark...

230
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,639
...and I ended up on Washington Street.

231
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,109
I"m gonna fix some Iamb chops.

232
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:58,252
WouId you set the tabIe?

233
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,588
Sorry I worried you, BiIIy.

234
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,381
Why didn"t you caII?

235
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,097
I couIdn"t remember our number.

236
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,516
BiIIy.

237
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:34,319
I think there"s something wrong with me.

238
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,010
This man just showered
with a new kind of soap.

239
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:07,578
New Light Boy Mint Refresher.
A soap so loaded with mint...

240
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:10,819
...so tangy, so frosty, it drives wives...

241
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:13,550
...wicked.

242
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,822
Soap has never smelled this good before.

243
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:18,867
New Light Boy Mint Refresher
drives wives...

244
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:21,160
...wicked.

245
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:23,937
A Northwest Mounty!

246
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:27,305
And he"s been trailing
this desperate character for three years!

247
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,176
I wouIdn"t Ieave you, BiII.

248
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,512
Thanks, Benny.

249
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,016
Running a IittIe Iate this morning.

250
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,862
"Morning, sir. There you go.

251
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:29,364
Monarch PIaza HoteI.

252
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,496
"Morning, BiII.

253
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:32,266
How"s the baby?

254
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:33,273
Much better.

255
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:34,604
I got one for you.

256
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:35,903
Lay it on me.

257
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:40,546
A traveIing saIesman passes a farmhouse.

258
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:42,913
He sees a pig with a wooden Ieg.

259
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:47,646
He says to the farmer,
'"What"s with the wooden Ieg?'"

260
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:51,589
The farmer says, '"That"s a very speciaI pig.

261
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,858
'"A few months back,
our house caught fire...

262
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:58,663
'"...the pig came in, woke us up...

263
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,028
'"...and saved my whoIe famiIy! '"

264
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:04,328
So the saIesman says,
'"But why the wooden Ieg?'"

265
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,668
'"HoId on,'" the farmer says.

266
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:09,634
'"My IittIe girI was pIaying in the road...

267
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:12,771
'"...and one of those Iogging trucks
Iost its brakes.

268
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,513
'"The pig ran out and dragged her to safety.'"

269
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,483
'"That"s amazing! '" says the saIesman.
'"But why the wooden Ieg?'"

270
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,955
'"WeII,'" says the farmer...

271
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:25,516
...'"you don"t eat a pig Iike that aII at once! '"

272
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:31,455
That"s good. That"s reaI good.
I"m gonna remember that one.

273
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,101
'"You don"t eat a pig Iike that aII at once! '"

274
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:39,701
Did you have breakfast?

275
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,799
Yeah.

276
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,075
What did you have? Because you Iook thin.

277
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:48,148
A coupIe of chickens
and a DeImonico steak.

278
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,445
Pass me that newspaper.

279
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:07,198
Dotty"s girI is getting married.

280
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:10,902
He"s a mechanic.

281
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:13,436
Do I know her?

282
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,703
Dotty, next door.

283
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,049
I have to get to work.

284
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,655
I have to go now, too.

285
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:31,453
No, Mom, you can"t.

286
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:32,584
I"m going home.

287
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,561
No, you have to stay here.

288
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:35,391
Why?

289
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:37,432
Because why. You know why.

290
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,132
They care for you here.

291
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:43,162
Okay.

292
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,703
You"II come home this weekend.

293
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:48,709
I"II see you tonight.

294
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,068
BiIIy?

295
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,378
Give her the HaviIIand tea set.

296
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:56,547
Who?

297
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:57,642
That girI.

298
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:00,449
For the wedding.

299
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:07,786
I"II see you tonight.

300
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:21,032
Do you have the checkbook?

301
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,802
Of course I do.

302
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:24,271
Good morning.

303
00:24:24,346 --> 00:24:26,314
We can"t right now, BiII. We"re Iate.

304
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,277
BiII, are you going next door?

305
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:32,351
Yeah.

306
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,548
WouId you teII those peopIe? You see this?

307
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,725
This is the number for AnimaI ControI.

308
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,692
If they do not shut up that stupid dog--

309
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:43,026
BiII, couId you do me a favor?

310
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:47,435
CouId you expIain to him
that"s not our dog? That"s the WyIer"s dog.

311
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:50,562
And I"ve been over that 100 times,
and I"ve toId them that.

312
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:53,367
It is not the WyIer"s dog.
It is a yapping dog.

313
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:54,874
The WyIer"s have a coIIie.

314
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,544
That"s right. This is a yapping dog.

315
00:24:57,612 --> 00:25:00,581
If they want to taIk about noise,
teII them to cIose...

316
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:02,947
...the damn window
if they"re gonna pIay the hi-fi.

317
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:04,174
Are they deaf?.

318
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,220
Every night! At 2:00, #:00 in the morning.

319
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:08,085
This dog is, '"Yap, yap, yap.'"

320
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:09,384
How can you Iive Iike that?

321
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:13,325
How many times can you Iisten to
My Boyfriend"s Back? Okay! He"s back.

322
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:16,460
And there"s gonna be troubIe.

323
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,066
You can bet there"s gonna be troubIe.

324
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:24,730
Tree mutiIators!

325
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:37,679
Outlet pass, and that"s a....

326
00:25:37,752 --> 00:25:40,243
... 16-foot set jumper.
He"s not gonna miss that....

327
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,315
...no chance to get
this game under control....

328
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:45,552
I don"t think your--

329
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,616
Oh, man.

330
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:51,327
...who"s got a game-high 22 points....

331
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:54,900
...and there"s the give-and-go!

332
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,528
...and he missed the lay-up....

333
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,802
BiII, you going to the bus?
Hop in and I"II give you a ride.

334
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,507
That"s aII right, Mr. Winters.

335
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:08,909
I"m going right by there.

336
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,952
No, that"s aII right, thank you.

337
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,010
Don"t be stupid, get in.

338
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:40,310
Take it outside.
l"m warning you for the last time!

339
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:41,610
Mrs. KotIarenko!

340
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,651
Mr. Porter! Your mother is eating dinner.

341
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:44,978
Where?

342
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:48,318
She"s good, nice dinner, in the back.
She"s good, everything"s good.

343
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:15,712
He be okay. EpiIeptic. That"s aII.

344
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:17,851
Where"s my mother"s suitcase?

345
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:19,544
Suitcase?

346
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:21,111
We"re Ieaving.

347
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,421
Yes. We"re Ieaving.

348
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:32,923
There are coId cuts
in the refrigerator for Iunch.

349
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:34,126
She"II be fine.

350
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:36,327
Mama?

351
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:39,402
I"II be home about 7:00.

352
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:42,835
Mrs. Warren is gonna check in with you.

353
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:44,376
She"II make you Iunch.

354
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:49,606
Mama, pIease!

355
00:27:49,684 --> 00:27:50,651
Just go.

356
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:53,310
Don"t worry about her.
I"II keep an eye on her.

357
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,516
I"m gonna do some cIeaning, BiIIy.

358
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:02,828
The pIace is a mess.

359
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,805
Good morning. My name is BiII Porter.

360
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:18,743
I"m with the Watkins Company.

361
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:20,075
You"re a saIesman?

362
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:21,172
Yeah.

363
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:23,484
No, thank you. I don"t need anything.

364
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:25,651
Are these orchids?

365
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,709
Yes.

366
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:30,615
They"re hard to grow. I know, I"ve tried.

367
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,591
You have a spot of something on your shirt.

368
00:28:34,662 --> 00:28:38,792
Our Iaundry detergent is concentrated.
So, just one....

369
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,858
-Hi.
-Hey.

370
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:43,600
-You off to schooI?
-Yeah.

371
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:45,901
-Good morning.
-"Morning.

372
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,408
-I"m BiII Porter.
-Brad Gutierrez.

373
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,239
You Iive in the neighborhood?

374
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,744
He rents a room from me.

375
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,010
Guys, I need you to step outside.
I need to spray in here.

376
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,744
AIan, that stuff"s gonna kiII you.

377
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,547
Thank you. Go outside, smoke a cigarette.

378
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:07,956
I hate that stuff.

379
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,790
It"s for bugs?

380
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:11,122
Yeah.

381
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,324
Has he tried peppermint soap?

382
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:17,670
I don"t think so.

383
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:29,014
What about this?

384
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:37,884
-Are you sure that stuff is not bad for you?
-Sure.

385
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:41,959
I wiII. Okay, "bye.

386
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:51,568
Athens, Morocco, somepIace eIse....

387
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:53,797
It"s very sweet of him...

388
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,743
...but what am I gonna do
aII by myseIf on a boat?

389
00:29:58,513 --> 00:30:01,676
Your son sounds Iike a very generous man.

390
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,684
I think he feeIs guiIty.

391
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,343
Why?

392
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:07,878
I never see him.

393
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:10,814
This is a Buddhist monk
who has poured gasoline....

394
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,656
But he"s busy. You know, he just....

395
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,394
Oh, my God. What is he doing?

396
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:20,957
Oh, dear God!

397
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:23,300
He"s protesting the war.

398
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,765
Why do they show them?

399
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:30,473
Why do they put that on the teIevision?

400
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:42,584
I made some orange juice.
It"s fresh-squeezed.

401
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:45,957
No, thank you, I have to go.

402
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:48,150
BiII?

403
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,298
What is that tonic that I Iike so much?

404
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,069
Beef and iron.

405
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,471
Yes. CouId you order me some of that?

406
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:05,075
And that drain cIeaner?

407
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:06,980
You"re out of that?

408
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:08,215
Yes.

409
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:12,444
And the dog biscuits. The Iarge size.

410
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,058
Mom?

411
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:25,663
Mrs. Warren?

412
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,683
Mama?

413
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,325
You see, now I have the proof.

414
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:21,519
-Can you bring the suitcases in for her?
-Sure.

415
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:23,489
-My gIasses.
-Here.

416
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:25,287
-Mom.
-I can"t.... What....

417
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,191
-You got them.
-No.

418
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:28,853
They"re in your purse.

419
00:32:29,263 --> 00:32:31,493
It Iooks reaIIy nice, doesn"t it?

420
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:46,207
They gave you Iots of Iinens.

421
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:49,276
I"m a burden.

422
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:52,476
What?

423
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:55,879
I"m a burden on you.

424
00:32:58,092 --> 00:32:59,684
WeII, now we"re even.

425
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:48,737
Three traveling salesmen,
they"re driving through the country.

426
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,870
Their car breaks down.
They go to the farmhouse.

427
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:56,680
The farmer says, ""You can spend the night,
but there"s only one bed. ""

428
00:33:57,685 --> 00:34:01,621
The next morning,
the guy on the right-hand side says:

429
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:03,991
'"I had the weirdest dream.

430
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:08,491
'"I dreamed that someone
was pIaying with me in the night.'"

431
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:10,326
The guy on the Ieft-hand side says:

432
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,459
'"I had the same dream.
Somebody was pIaying with me.'"

433
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:18,767
And the guy in the middIe says,
'"ReaIIy? I dreamed I was skiing.'"

434
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,200
Man, that"s aII right. I Iike that one.

435
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:23,937
Come on, Iet me do your shoes.

436
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:27,881
That"s funny. I Iike that one.
I"m gonna be teIIing that one.

437
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:31,476
L# and 4, L4 and 5, L5, S1 .

438
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:33,781
You see how these discs
are aII compressed?

439
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:37,689
That"s what"s giving you aII the pain.
You stiII making your own deIiveries?

440
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,927
You"re gonna have to stop doing that.

441
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:41,722
I got to make the deIiveries.

442
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:43,227
Hire someone.

443
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,990
You"re Iooking at spinaI stenosis
if you keep going the way you"re going.

444
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,563
I want you to wear a brace for a few weeks,
and I"m writing you a prescription...

445
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:53,266
...for the infIammation.

446
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:57,736
Take this seriousIy, BiII.

447
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:01,415
If you don"t take care of your back,
it"s onIy a matter of time.

448
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:03,507
You won"t be waIking.

449
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:04,744
How"s your mother?

450
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:08,846
She"s hanging in.
How was the tomato sauce?

451
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,551
It was reaIIy good.

452
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,125
-I"m gonna put you down for some more.
-Okay.

453
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:17,095
We aIso have a tarragon-diII dressing.
You"re gonna Iove it.

454
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:22,701
Yeah.

455
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,601
Hi. I"m here to see BiII Porter.

456
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:27,163
That"s me. You"re here about the job?

457
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:28,297
Yeah.

458
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:29,535
Come on in.

459
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:36,007
Is this deIiveries in a car?

460
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,548
Yeah, come on in. Sit down.

461
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:41,086
I don"t want to use my car
for too much driving.

462
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:44,556
It said '"must have car'" in the paper.

463
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:48,762
It"s just.... My car....
This isn"t what I"m Iooking for.

464
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:56,198
How about shutting the door?

465
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:00,600
Good morning!

466
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:05,134
You Iook good.

467
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:15,915
Arkansas versus Texas.

468
00:36:23,497 --> 00:36:24,930
This is new.

469
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:27,925
It"s got eucaIyptus.

470
00:36:37,144 --> 00:36:39,009
I"m so proud of you.

471
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:44,449
It was a beautifuI speech you made.

472
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:47,877
Funny.

473
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:56,896
Earnest, that was a wonderfuI speech.

474
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:07,973
We had to do a cardiac catheterization.

475
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,737
The fuII amount?

476
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,747
No. $400.

477
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,050
BiII, with your condition,
you couId coIIect disabiIity.

478
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,714
I"m working.

479
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:22,221
I know, but I"m saying,
if you weren"t working....

480
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,757
But I am working!

481
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,054
I just wanna make sure
you"re aware of what"s avaiIabIe to you.

482
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,620
I have a job.

483
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:31,960
I know.

484
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:35,093
I"m a saIesman. For Watkins!

485
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,635
I know you are.

486
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,478
BiII.

487
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:51,913
Hi, Larry.

488
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:54,986
I thought you were.... Nobody"s here.

489
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:56,555
We don"t need anything.

490
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,057
Larry, I borrowed your....

491
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:03,393
Between us guys?

492
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:22,972
Oh, boy.

493
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:28,953
Hi, BiII.

494
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:35,854
Okay, honey, Iet"s get you into bed.
I got to get back to work.

495
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,430
I threw up.

496
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:39,255
Her whoIe cIass has it.

497
00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:44,566
Dr. Stewart is home.
I couId take Kimmy there.

498
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:46,868
No, it"s nothing. It"s just a stomach fIu.

499
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:48,638
I wouIdn"t mind.

500
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,572
That"s okay, BiII. Thanks.

501
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:52,768
CharIotte.

502
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,280
I think I shouId take her.

503
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,731
Son of a bitch.

504
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:17,899
WouId you....
Bring her across the street, wouId you?

505
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:21,600
Kimmy, honey, you go with BiII
to Mrs. Turner"s house. Okay?

506
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:23,734
-Why?
-Why? Because I....

507
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:26,871
I don"t know, just go.
I just need you to go. Okay?

508
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,744
And teII her I"II be right there.

509
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:38,219
I threw up pancakes and bananas.

510
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:40,886
That"s a good combination.

511
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:15,228
RaIphie!

512
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:17,330
Hey, man.

513
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,691
Look, paI, I don"t know what to teII you.

514
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:22,361
I don"t want anything.
I"m never gonna want anything.

515
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:23,869
Don"t come back here, aII right?

516
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:24,962
AII right.

517
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,803
Merry Christmas from aII of us at Watkins.

518
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:36,144
I"m gonna bring some rawhide sampIes
for CIifford.

519
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:38,481
They"re good for when he"s teething.

520
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:39,719
Damn it!

521
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,320
That had frost burn.

522
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,688
Where"s Brad?

523
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:52,493
Brad who? I don"t know any Brad.
But Iet me teII you this.

524
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:56,024
I"m a grownup.
And I deserve to have an aduIt reIationship.

525
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:59,800
I"m honest with peopIe
and I deserve honesty in return.

526
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,241
It doesn"t terrify me
to have a joint checking account.

527
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,370
It"s not Iike I"m asking
for monogrammed toweIs or anything!

528
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:10,213
I treat peopIe with respect,
and I deserve not to be humiIiated.

529
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,446
A math teacher.

530
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:17,046
A baId, 50-year-oId math teacher.

531
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,953
How pathetic is that?

532
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,261
Two cents I"d caII his wife.

533
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,667
Does he have somepIace to go?

534
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:29,835
I don"t know and I don"t care.

535
00:41:41,315 --> 00:41:43,545
Merry Christmas from Watkins.

536
00:41:43,784 --> 00:41:48,221

00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,653
Yeah, thanks.

538
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:15,414
Brad"s young. PeopIe make mistakes.

539
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,014
You two guys are good together.

540
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,785
Merry Christmas, BiII.

541
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,826
Merry Christmas, AIan.

00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:51,014
There you go.

543
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:54,113
Thank you.

544
00:42:57,258 --> 00:42:58,623
This is for you.

545
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,291
You shouIdn"t have done that. Thank you.

546
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,232
I have something for you.

547
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:14,438
How sweet!

548
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:18,500
There"s a magnet on the back.
It"II stick to your refrigerator.

549
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,143
I need a caIendar.

550
00:43:23,317 --> 00:43:25,717
Are you sure I can"t ask you to stay
for some eggnog?

551
00:43:25,786 --> 00:43:26,912
No, thanks.

552
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:30,381
Are you aII set for Christmas?

553
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:32,148
Have you got your turkey?

554
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:33,625
TweIve pounds!

555
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:38,723
Food Fair gives them to you for free
when you buy $50 worth of groceries.

556
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:41,299
I"II have to do that next time.

557
00:43:43,504 --> 00:43:45,472
Are you having your famiIy over?

558
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:50,139
-No, not reaIIy. You?
-No.

559
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:52,173
They"re going skiing this year.

560
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:53,746
That sounds nice.

561
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:55,338
CoIorado, I think.

562
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:08,351
Merry Christmas, BiII.

563
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,761
You, too, Mrs. SuIIivan.

564
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:16,166
Let me get that.

565
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:50,567
Let me heIp you.

566
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:52,264
No, that"s aII right.

567
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,232
I"m here for the interview.
I"m SheIIy Soentpiet.

568
00:44:57,578 --> 00:44:59,512
Let me get your bag.

569
00:45:01,582 --> 00:45:03,379
Just put it on the tabIe.

570
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:05,418
Are you sure? I couId put it away for you.

571
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:07,053
No, that"s aII right.

572
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:07,951
Okay.

573
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:11,919
What do you have?

574
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:13,118
Excuse me?

575
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:14,888
Your affIiction.

576
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:17,492
Why do you taIk Iike that?

577
00:45:17,564 --> 00:45:18,895
CerebraI paIsy.

578
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:22,835
How do you get that?

579
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:24,465
From birth.

580
00:45:24,772 --> 00:45:28,401
The doctor squished my head
with the forceps.

581
00:45:29,943 --> 00:45:31,467
It"s not catching.

582
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:38,480
What"s the job? Just shopping and...

583
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:41,452
...deIiveries and generaI assistance?

584
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:43,146
Yeah.

585
00:45:45,592 --> 00:45:48,584
You"ve got a buIb out.
You got an extra buIb?

586
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,960
Yeah, under the sink.

587
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:53,192
Oh, okay.

588
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:59,104
Let"s see, I go to Western.

589
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:01,569
Okay student.

590
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,912
Don"t smoke, don"t drink, don"t Iike it.
Don"t have a choice.

591
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:08,775
We"re Mormon.

592
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:16,287
CIearIy, I"m good with eIectronics.

593
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:21,093
Do I have the job?

594
00:46:44,518 --> 00:46:45,678
HeIIo.

595
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:49,346
Yes.

596
00:46:58,499 --> 00:46:59,591
Thank you.

597
00:47:10,777 --> 00:47:13,769

Are you aII right?

Our greatest vaIue....

612
00:48:35,862 --> 00:48:37,227
I"m sorry.

613
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:40,324
I"II come back another time.

614
00:48:41,602 --> 00:48:43,661
-Is there something I can--
-No.

615
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:46,736
I"m sorry.

616
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,292
Good run?

617
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:52,498
It was great. Can I take a shower here?
I need to go to cIass right after.

618
00:49:53,206 --> 00:49:56,004
-Sure.
-This is what I was taIking to you about.

619
00:49:56,143 --> 00:50:00,170
They make them for the home.
It"s a personaI computer.

620
00:50:01,648 --> 00:50:06,051
We can do everything on it.
AII the accounting, aII the biIIing.

621
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:10,317
I Iike my typewriter. It never breaks down.

622
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:14,661
I finaIIy finished that paper. What a bear.

623
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:15,922
Good for you!

624
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,628
Hi. How you doing?

625
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,425
-Where do you want these?
-Over there.

626
00:50:57,437 --> 00:50:59,905
Come here, boy.

627
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,372
Here you go, BiII.

628
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:02,735
Thanks, Brad.

629
00:51:04,411 --> 00:51:05,469
CIifford!

630
00:51:05,946 --> 00:51:08,176
You need anything eIse?

631
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,610
Some of that dishwashing detergent.

632
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:12,748
We have dishwashing detergent.

633
00:51:12,853 --> 00:51:14,115
No. I used it up.

634
00:51:14,187 --> 00:51:15,415
Yeah, under the sink.

635
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,683
AIan, I used it.

636
00:51:16,757 --> 00:51:18,748
If you fight, I"m gonna separate you.

637
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,658
I"m gonna put you down
for the four-pound box.

638
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:23,653
Anything eIse to go?

639
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,630
Yeah, those go into the van, too.

640
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:26,893
Hi, Jerry.

641
00:51:26,967 --> 00:51:27,934
Hey, BiII.

642
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:35,268
What did the doctor say?

643
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:37,934
It"s bizarre. It"s some kind of cancer.

644
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,444
Kaposi"s sarcoma.

645
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,876
Some skin cancer that onIy
reaIIy oId peopIe are supposed to get.

646
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:43,881
He"II be okay.

647
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,975
He"s young. He"II be fine.

648
00:51:46,419 --> 00:51:48,284
Here"s what we need.

649
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:50,651
SheIIy, take that cataIogue away from him.

650
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:52,214
AIan, you Iove this stuff.

651
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:53,088
No buying.

652
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,185
No, he"s right. You Iove this stuff.

653
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,570
Those two are Iike an oId married coupIe.

654
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:08,005
They"ve been together forever.

655
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:09,200
What do you mean?

656
00:52:12,445 --> 00:52:14,345
That"s not right. That"s a sin.

657
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:18,173
If you can find somebody to Iove,
I think that"s a good thing.

658
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,512
We don"t beIieve in it.

659
00:52:20,954 --> 00:52:24,913
God made aII of us, SheIIy.
He doesn"t make mistakes.

660
00:52:32,499 --> 00:52:33,830
How"s Kimmy?

661
00:52:34,835 --> 00:52:38,032
She"s doing good. She"s good.
Her father"s got her this weekend.

662
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:43,198
Listen, BiII,
teII him to put a timer on his porch Iight.

663
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:44,971
I chased some kids out of there.

664
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:48,276
He rattIes around in that house.
I don"t know why he doesn"t seII it.

665
00:52:48,348 --> 00:52:49,838
Is he seeing anyone?

666
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:52,746
I"m sure I don"t know.

667
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:57,519
I think Rhonda"s death
was reaIIy hard on Bob.

668
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:01,889
We aII take our knocks, don"t we?
Life goes on.

669
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,634
What"s with her?

670
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:14,465
It"s kind of a Iong story, but....

671
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:18,238
You see that tree?

672
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,075
I"II pick you up at a quarter to.

673
00:53:26,152 --> 00:53:26,846
No.

674
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,909
WiII you stop?

675
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:30,582
I"II be here at a quarter of eight.
You better be ready.

676
00:53:30,657 --> 00:53:32,784
I don"t want you spending your money--

677
00:53:33,326 --> 00:53:35,317
I can"t hear you.

678
00:53:36,563 --> 00:53:39,327
I"m putting on a dress, for your information.

679
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,369
I think his parents are very....

680
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,613
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

681
00:53:55,715 --> 00:53:56,704
Wait.

682
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:03,245
It makes your wish come true.
Make a wish.

683
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:15,326
-Come here, birthday boy.
-Thank you.

684
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:18,902
You know what?

685
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:19,904
What?

686
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:21,406
I"m reaIIy proud of you tonight.

687
00:54:21,474 --> 00:54:22,236
Why?

688
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:25,437
You haven"t tried to seII Iaundry detergent
to one person here.

689
00:54:25,712 --> 00:54:28,112
I was gonna hit them up on the way out.

690
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:41,659
You"re the best thing
that"s ever happened to me, SheIIy.

691
00:54:42,562 --> 00:54:44,154
Do you know that?

692
00:54:51,638 --> 00:54:53,697
Don"t get aII mushy on me.

693
00:54:56,943 --> 00:54:57,932
Come on.

694
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,739
Where?

695
00:55:01,581 --> 00:55:02,741
Come on.

696
00:55:03,483 --> 00:55:04,916
No.

697
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:12,850
I don"t want to. I don"t think so.

698
00:55:13,593 --> 00:55:15,083
Come on!

699
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,520
Watch me, okay?

00:55:41,454 --> 00:55:42,716

Steven SquaII.

703
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:26,730
It took me six years, but I finaIIy did it.

704
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:29,827
-I"m so proud of you.
-Thank you.

705
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:33,331
I wanted you to meet John.

706
00:56:33,406 --> 00:56:34,600
Who"s John?

707
00:56:34,674 --> 00:56:35,732
Hey, missy!

708
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,299
-We did it.
-Yeah.

709
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:39,868
Mom and Dad

710
00:56:42,282 --> 00:56:43,874
I thought I Iost you there.

711
00:56:46,786 --> 00:56:48,151
-Hi.
-CongratuIations.

712
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:49,848
Thanks. John, this is--

713
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:53,484
BiII Porter, of course. The '"boss.'"
It"s great to finaIIy meet you.

714
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,425
It"s nice to meet you, John.

715
00:56:55,728 --> 00:56:58,390
Two degrees, isn"t he annoying?

716
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:02,526
You know what? We shouId go.

717
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:05,196
We"re gonna ride with John"s dad, right?

718
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,269
My foIks wiII take you over.

719
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,273
Okay.

720
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:10,804
Thanks for coming!

721
00:57:10,877 --> 00:57:12,708
-We"II meet you at the restaurant.
-Okay.

722
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:14,269
-"Bye.
-"Bye.

723
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:34,328
BiII, this is turning into a science project.

724
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:38,134
I don"t even know what that was.

725
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:41,696
Has John decided
which offer he"s going to take?

726
00:57:41,808 --> 00:57:43,605
He"s Ieaning towards Bendix.

727
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,208
Where are they?

728
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:46,540
Chicago.

729
00:57:47,947 --> 00:57:49,005
Chicago?

730
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:51,277
I know. I can"t even think about that.

731
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:52,907
When?

732
00:57:52,986 --> 00:57:54,248
I don"t know.

733
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,019
Damn it!

734
00:57:57,323 --> 00:57:58,312
What?

735
00:57:59,325 --> 00:58:01,316
The '"B'" sticks.

736
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,191
Get rid of that thing.

737
00:58:03,263 --> 00:58:04,730
We shouId get a computer.

738
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,264
I can"t afford a computer.

739
00:58:06,366 --> 00:58:07,697
Yes, you can.

740
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,826
John couId get one reaI cheap.
We couId do everything on it.

741
00:58:11,871 --> 00:58:13,031
I don"t Iike them.

742
00:58:13,106 --> 00:58:16,473
We have eIectricity
and indoor pIumbing now, BiII.

743
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,068
We shouId just toss that piece of....
Hey, I did those aIready.

744
00:58:20,513 --> 00:58:21,571
What?

745
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:24,047
The orders. I aIready did them. Here.

746
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,616
-Why?
-I had some time, so--

747
00:58:26,686 --> 00:58:28,119
I do the orders.

748
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,816
I know that, but I just--

749
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:31,652
I do the order forms!

750
00:58:31,724 --> 00:58:34,192
But it takes you so Iong,
I just thought that--

751
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,558
I don"t want you to do them.

752
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:37,596
AII right.

753
00:58:38,398 --> 00:58:40,662
-I have my own way.
-AII right.

754
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:44,062
I have to read them,
so I have to write them.

755
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:48,264
You"re not heIping me, SheIIy.

756
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,308
If you think you"re heIping me, you"re not.

757
00:58:52,478 --> 00:58:53,376
I"m sorry.

758
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,641
It"s just, I have a certain way.

759
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:58,642
I"m not taIking about the forms.

760
00:59:24,911 --> 00:59:26,902
Thanks very much. I appreciate it.

761
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,938
Hey, BiII.

762
00:59:30,216 --> 00:59:32,411

765
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,722
I"d Iike you to meet BiII Porter.

766
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:40,656
-Peter Schaefer.
-Nice to meet you.

767
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,521

768
00:59:42,762 --> 00:59:44,491

00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,428
We"re gonna miss this guy.

771
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,489
Hey, Porter!

772
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:51,334
Excuse me.

773
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,473
What"s he do?

774
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:57,509
He"s a saIesman.

775
00:59:57,877 --> 00:59:58,901
SeriousIy.

776
00:59:59,045 --> 01:00:00,069
I am serious.

777
01:00:00,146 --> 01:00:02,011
Did you see what happened to Frigidaire?

778
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:03,309
He"s a saIesman.

779
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:04,440
KeIvinator!

780
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,677
What, for us?

781
01:00:05,752 --> 01:00:07,049
Whose idea was that?

782
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,144
Mine.

783
01:00:09,055 --> 01:00:10,716
You are so....

784
01:00:13,726 --> 01:00:17,218
If you made a doIIar a year for 5,000 years.

785
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:21,195
CongratuIations, Chuck.

Chuck, you stay retired.

790
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,413
l don"t want to catch you over at Fuller.

791
01:00:37,483 --> 01:00:39,314
OnIy if they pay me to fIy-fish.

792
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:45,781
...Iike Bardot. Maybe not exactIy, right?

793
01:00:45,858 --> 01:00:47,223
But her Iips....

794
01:00:47,293 --> 01:00:50,228
I take the Iid off, and she Ieans...

795
01:00:50,296 --> 01:00:53,595
...over the couch to smeII the stuff,
and her robe kind of....

796
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:57,158
And I"m staring at two

799
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:05,274

l wish he could be here.

812
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:11,867
And my mother, who taught me...

813
01:02:12,612 --> 01:02:14,705
...patience and persistence.

814
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,046
And who would never let me be ashamed.

815
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:25,050
l wish she could be here today.

816
01:02:28,694 --> 01:02:29,820
Thank you.

817
01:02:57,056 --> 01:02:58,956

You got it? It"s not too heavy?
Wait, hoId on.

819
01:03:01,661 --> 01:03:02,821
This is messed up.

820
01:03:02,895 --> 01:03:05,455
BiII, you IabeIed that wrong.

821
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:06,829
It"s aII right.

822
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:09,959
No. You"ve got Bob at 825 EIm.
That"s CharIotte"s.

823
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,500
No, it"s aII right.

01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:13,562
What do you want me to do with the box?

825

01:03:14,841 --> 01:03:15,967

Okay, fine. It"s wrong, but fine.

833
01:03:57,783 --> 01:03:59,273
This must be yours.

834
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,946
BiII got the address wrong.

835
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,485
I"II just Ieave it right here.

836
01:04:11,797 --> 01:04:12,855
Wait.

837
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:25,833
It"s just junk maiI,
but you might want it or whatever.

838
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:31,247
Want me to take this in the house for you?

839
01:04:32,184 --> 01:04:33,173
Okay.

840
01:04:40,426 --> 01:04:44,055
I got a waII there. This is better.

841
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,963
Larry took that down.

842
01:04:49,402 --> 01:04:51,529
I see you get the barbecue sauce.

843
01:04:51,604 --> 01:04:52,628
Yeah.

844
01:04:53,172 --> 01:04:55,106
Have you tried the Iemon garIic?

845
01:04:55,241 --> 01:04:56,265
No.

846
01:04:57,677 --> 01:04:58,974
Is it good?

847
01:04:59,045 --> 01:05:01,946
I don"t know. BiII says it is.

848
01:05:07,787 --> 01:05:09,482
Put it on that tabIe.

849
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,929
Yes?

850
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:31,032
I"m Iooking for Mrs. SuIIivan.

851
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,939
Are you a friend of hers?

852
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,207
She"s a customer.

853
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:37,640
I"m with the Watkins Company.

854
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,081
I"m her daughter-in-Iaw.

855
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,945
GIadys passed away Iast week.

856
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,182
I didn"t know she was sick.

857
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,286
I"m sorry.

858
01:05:49,996 --> 01:05:51,588
How did she die?

859
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:53,190
It was an accident.

860
01:05:53,265 --> 01:05:55,893
Some kind of reaction
to the medication she was taking.

861
01:05:55,968 --> 01:05:58,027
It was vodka and sIeeping piIIs.

862
01:05:58,104 --> 01:06:00,004
Frank, they don"t know that.

863
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,865
Are you BiII Parker?

864
01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:04,867
BiII Porter.

865
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:08,345
Come here. I want to show you something.

866
01:06:09,649 --> 01:06:11,446
She taIked about you...

867
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:13,907
...a Iot.

868
01:06:16,322 --> 01:06:19,120
Every year, at Christmas,
no matter what eIse we"d get...

869
01:06:19,191 --> 01:06:22,183
...we"d get the Watkins spice coIIection...

870
01:06:22,261 --> 01:06:26,561
...the soup bases, the Iiniment.

871
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:50,549
Dog biscuits....

872
01:06:52,725 --> 01:06:54,784
Damn dog died years ago.

873
01:06:55,828 --> 01:06:56,920
Excuse me.

874
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,794
Hey, BiII. What do you think?

875
01:07:29,862 --> 01:07:31,659
Very nice, Richard.

876
01:07:31,731 --> 01:07:35,428
It was supposed to have been done
months ago. You guys are up on two now.

877
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:36,490
Okay.

878
01:07:36,569 --> 01:07:39,060
You got a card? You need a security card.

879
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,966
CouId you take your hat off, pIease, sir?

880
01:07:51,684 --> 01:07:53,208
You got to do it fast.

881
01:07:55,888 --> 01:07:57,048
Bingo!

882
01:07:57,723 --> 01:07:59,247
Have a good one.

883
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:12,630
Pretty cooI, huh?

884
01:08:12,705 --> 01:08:16,141
HeIIo, Peter. What is this?

885
01:08:16,308 --> 01:08:18,105
This is aII the 800 number.

886
01:08:18,377 --> 01:08:21,869
Makes us door-to-door guys
Iook Iike dinosaurs.

887
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:25,144
You know, each operator
is seIIing $#00 to $500 an hour.

888
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:27,719
They"re taking orders. They aren"t seIIing.

889
01:08:27,787 --> 01:08:30,915
When you cash a check,
George Washington Iooks the same.

890
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,488
There"s CIark.

891
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,490
A Iot of the door-to-door guys
are moving over.

892
01:08:37,563 --> 01:08:39,724
I"ve never done weII on the phone.

893
01:08:39,799 --> 01:08:43,997
Women find my voice sexy,
and I think it distracts them.

894
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,734
You"re getting cIose to retirement anyway,
aren"t you?

895
01:08:47,807 --> 01:08:48,865
Not reaIIy.

896
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:51,466
Where"s the door-to-door office?

897
01:08:53,245 --> 01:08:54,974
I think it"s down there.

898
01:08:56,182 --> 01:08:57,376
Thank you.

899
01:09:04,657 --> 01:09:06,215
Is Rita here?

900
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:10,526
Rita? I don"t know Rita.

901
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,298
She runs the door-to-door division.

902
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,036
She"s gone, I think.

903
01:09:18,103 --> 01:09:20,071
Who took her pIace?

904
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,670
I don"t know, man.
I was just toId to organize this stuff.

905
01:09:23,776 --> 01:09:27,007
I need product cards for the new cataIogue.

906
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,278
Okay, cooI, no probIem.

907
01:09:32,852 --> 01:09:37,186
No. I have the new cataIogue.
I need the product cards.

908
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:40,715
Okay, you know what?
I have no idea what that means.

909
01:09:40,793 --> 01:09:44,422
But they"re probabIy here somewhere,
so just check in some of these boxes.

910
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:39,508
Race you.

911
01:10:40,019 --> 01:10:41,384
No running, guys.

912
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:42,613
SIow down!

913
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:48,850
BiII!

914
01:10:48,928 --> 01:10:51,260
Hi, guys.

915
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:52,961
Hi, BiII.

916
01:10:53,132 --> 01:10:56,158
-Easy, guys, off the bed, pIease.
-No, that"s aII right.

917
01:10:56,235 --> 01:10:57,793
-Guess what?
-What?

918
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:00,100
-You have to cIose your eyes.
-BiII doesn"t want--

919
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,072
No, that"s aII right. My eyes are cIosed.

920
01:11:02,141 --> 01:11:03,199
Ready?

921
01:11:07,613 --> 01:11:10,810
-So stupid.
-Okay, that"s enough.

922
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:15,544
-You can have it. It"s a present.
-I"m sure BiII wiII cherish that aIways.

923
01:11:15,621 --> 01:11:16,451
Thank you.

924
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,387
MicheIIe, wiII you take them to the Iounge?

925
01:11:18,457 --> 01:11:20,652
Get some juice out of the machine.
Got some money?

926
01:11:20,726 --> 01:11:22,421
-"Bye, BiII.
-"Bye.

927
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,596
-They finaIIy caIIed us back.
-The insurance company?

928
01:11:30,669 --> 01:11:32,068
Yep. They won"t budge.

929
01:11:32,137 --> 01:11:34,935
They maintain that some
of your condition was pre-existing.

930
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:36,497
We can take them to arbitration.

931
01:11:36,575 --> 01:11:37,564
I don"t know.

932
01:11:37,643 --> 01:11:40,043
They"re digging up X-rays
from 10 years ago.

933
01:11:40,112 --> 01:11:41,909
We"ve got to go after the bus company.

934
01:11:41,981 --> 01:11:42,970
No.

935
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:46,575
With the deductibIe,
they"re onIy wiIIing to cover $22,000 of this.

936
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,651
John"s right, we have to sue.

937
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,714
It was my fauIt.
I was crossing in the middIe of the bIock.

938
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:55,487
It doesn"t matter.
Buses aren"t supposed to hit peopIe.

939
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,188
It wasn"t their fauIt.

940
01:11:57,262 --> 01:11:59,025
Pedestrians have the right of way.

941
01:11:59,098 --> 01:12:00,156
No.

942
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:03,690
Okay, fine!
Then you owe the hospitaI $18,000.

943
01:12:04,503 --> 01:12:07,370
Which account do you want me
to take that out of?.

944
01:12:08,507 --> 01:12:09,337
And it"s not over.

945
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:11,205
The insurance company"s covering haIf.

946
01:12:11,276 --> 01:12:13,642
You"ve stiII got physicaI therapy,
and home care.

947
01:12:13,712 --> 01:12:16,272
You"re Iooking at $40,000 to $50,000.

948
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,675
I"m gonna seII the house.

949
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:20,684
What?

950
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:24,655
It"s too big and it costs too much
to keep up.

951
01:12:24,723 --> 01:12:25,917
Where are you gonna go?

952
01:12:25,991 --> 01:12:27,390
SomepIace smaIIer.

953
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,230
I think we can settIe with the bus company.

954
01:12:32,331 --> 01:12:33,161
No.

955
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:35,996
Just for expenses, out of court.

956
01:12:36,168 --> 01:12:37,965
I"m gonna seII the house.

957
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:40,802
It"s the right thing to do.

958
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,270
Very funny, BiII.

959
01:12:50,416 --> 01:12:51,440
Sorry.

960
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,854
It"s the equivaIent of eight boxes.

961
01:13:03,328 --> 01:13:05,353
It"s super-concentrated.

962
01:13:06,598 --> 01:13:09,965
It comes out to about three cents a Ioad.

963
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,237
But may I be candid?

964
01:13:14,173 --> 01:13:15,538
It"s our best vaIue.

965
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:22,111
It"s most effective when used
with the coIor-fast bIeach...

966
01:13:23,015 --> 01:13:24,778
...and the fabric softener.

967
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:27,216
They"re designed to work together.

968
01:13:30,089 --> 01:13:34,287
Is the fabric softener scented?
I hate the scented.

969
01:13:34,693 --> 01:13:38,595
I do, too. Ours is very miId.

970
01:13:39,531 --> 01:13:41,624
It"s practicaIIy unscented.

971
01:13:45,938 --> 01:13:48,372
Okay, wait! WiII you wait?

972
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:52,803
If you faII and break your neck,
I"m gonna break your neck.

973
01:13:53,912 --> 01:13:55,777
It"s good to be here.

974
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,009
Yeah? Good, I"m gIad.

975
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,310
AII right, Iet me take your coat.

976
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:02,819
Look at that.

977
01:14:02,888 --> 01:14:04,082
Do you Iike it?

978
01:14:04,156 --> 01:14:05,180
Yeah.

979
01:14:05,257 --> 01:14:08,658
Good. I figured that the couch
wouId be your base of operation...

980
01:14:08,727 --> 01:14:11,025
...but if you want it somepIace different--

981
01:14:11,096 --> 01:14:12,586
No, this is good.

982
01:14:12,664 --> 01:14:15,394
Okay, good. I stocked you up.

983
01:14:16,268 --> 01:14:18,168
Are you hungry?
I"m gonna make some soup.

984
01:14:18,237 --> 01:14:20,933
No, you shouId get back to the kids.

985
01:14:21,006 --> 01:14:22,234
I"m hungry.

986
01:14:22,307 --> 01:14:24,036
I"m gonna make myseIf some soup.

987
01:14:26,645 --> 01:14:27,634
SheIIy?

988
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:28,702
Yeah?

989
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,742
I"m going to have to Iet you go.

990
01:14:31,116 --> 01:14:32,481
Go, where?

991
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,652
I can"t pay you,
at Ieast untiI I go back to work.

992
01:14:37,923 --> 01:14:41,017
I knew you were gonna say that.
Don"t start with me, okay?

993
01:14:41,093 --> 01:14:42,754
I can get around.

994
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:43,884
PIease.

995
01:14:43,962 --> 01:14:47,864
What? I have to go to the kitchen...

996
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:50,064
...go to the bathroom...

997
01:14:50,969 --> 01:14:52,903
...pretty much in that order.

998
01:14:52,971 --> 01:14:54,438
I"II reduce my hours.

999
01:14:54,506 --> 01:14:55,768
I can"t pay you.

1000
01:14:55,841 --> 01:14:57,001
You don"t have to.

1001
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,064
BiII.

1002
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,168
You"re unbearabIe.

1003
01:15:00,812 --> 01:15:02,074
AII right, fine.

1004
01:15:02,281 --> 01:15:04,749
I"m not your assistant. I"m your friend.

1005
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:08,076
Your friend is gonna stop by every day
to say heIIo.

1006
01:15:10,689 --> 01:15:12,987
Now I"m gonna make
a friendIy bowI of soup.

1007
01:15:18,063 --> 01:15:19,587
Under the couch.

1008
01:15:20,299 --> 01:15:21,129
What?

1009
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,963
Look under the couch.

1010
01:15:32,544 --> 01:15:33,943
InitiaI here.

1011
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,646
And sign here.

1012
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,354
CongratuIations.

1013
01:15:44,423 --> 01:15:47,984
The market"s been so fIat these days,
I"m very happy you got your price.

1014
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:51,057
Why wouId a corporation want this house?

1015
01:15:51,263 --> 01:15:52,560
Investment property.

1016
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,223
I think it"s a tax thing.

1017
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:56,995
What"s the name of the corporation?

1018
01:15:57,069 --> 01:15:58,536
The name isn"t--

1019
01:15:58,604 --> 01:16:01,437
That"s my fauIt. I got the name wrong.
I"II fiII that in Iater.

1020
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:02,529
Good news.

1021
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:05,338
I"II be the Ieasing agent on this house.

1022
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:07,401
-Have you found a pIace yet?
-No.

1023
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:12,578
I was thinking maybe you couId
Iease this back. Just stay here.

1024
01:16:13,952 --> 01:16:16,045
How much wouId the rent be?

1025
01:16:16,355 --> 01:16:18,653
What wouId you feeI comfortabIe with?

1026
01:16:29,601 --> 01:16:31,364
Do you think l"m stupid?

1027
01:16:31,436 --> 01:16:33,734
Do I think? I know you"re stupid.

1028
01:16:33,805 --> 01:16:36,137
I don"t want charity.

1029
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:37,937
It"s not charity. It"s an investment.

1030
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,604
Then why didn"t you teII me?

1031
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,010
Why do you think?

1032
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:44,875
I am not going to Iet you buy my house.

1033
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:47,544
It"s too Iate.
Because you signed the papers.

1034
01:16:50,722 --> 01:16:52,019
BiII, wait.

1035
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,393
You deceived me. You treat me Iike a chiId.

1036
01:16:58,463 --> 01:17:01,296
I do not.
I treat you Iike someone I care about...

1037
01:17:01,733 --> 01:17:03,860
...someone who"s important to me.

1038
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,033
You"re part of my famiIy.

1039
01:17:06,104 --> 01:17:08,732
No, SheIIy. You have a famiIy.

1040
01:17:09,675 --> 01:17:13,167
I hired you,
and you treat me with disrespect.

1041
01:17:13,745 --> 01:17:15,940
You treat me Iike a crippIe.

1042
01:17:17,115 --> 01:17:20,380
You are a crippIe! An emotionaI crippIe!

1043
01:17:20,452 --> 01:17:22,511
NormaI peopIe heIp each other, BiII.

1044
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:25,383
You"re so hung up on your independence.

1045
01:17:25,457 --> 01:17:28,483
'"I don"t need anybody.'"
Yeah, Iike that"s normaI.

1046
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,052
That doesn"t make you normaI, BiII.
That makes you a freak!

1047
01:17:33,298 --> 01:17:35,198
You don"t want our heIp, fine!

1048
01:17:35,267 --> 01:17:37,497
Then be out of the house in #0 days.

1049
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:46,905
Do you want me to caII you a cab?

1050
01:17:49,481 --> 01:17:51,073
I"m caIIing you a cab.

1051
01:17:52,317 --> 01:17:53,147
God!

1052
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:29,682
Whatever you wanna do.... That"s great.
AII right. Good.

1053
01:18:30,489 --> 01:18:32,684
Yeah, I think that"II be possibIe.

1054
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:38,422
Yeah, that"s aII right.

1055
01:18:43,368 --> 01:18:45,802
...the whole lnternet right at my fingertips.

1056
01:18:47,239 --> 01:18:50,970
...the news is breaking, l"ve got lnternet.

1057
01:18:51,042 --> 01:18:53,067
l could stay a little closer to my family.

1058
01:18:53,245 --> 01:18:54,337
You"ve got mail.

1059
01:18:54,413 --> 01:18:57,177
America Online. Easy to use.
Friendly menus.

1060
01:18:57,249 --> 01:19:00,844
-Put in the disk, click, you"re online.
-We"ve been working night and day....

1061
01:19:00,919 --> 01:19:03,581
-You finished, hon?
-CouId be.

1062
01:19:03,855 --> 01:19:06,688
-Anything eIse?
-No. Just the check.

1063
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:12,359
-You a saIesman?
-No. I"m a dinosaur.

1064
01:19:12,931 --> 01:19:17,027
-You"re a dancer?
-Yeah, I"m a dancer.

1065
01:19:17,102 --> 01:19:18,797
Disco, mostIy.

1066
01:19:19,538 --> 01:19:21,130
You go, boy.

1067
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:36,606
Sorry, I didn"t know which apartment.

1068
01:20:36,681 --> 01:20:38,581
-You"re BiII Porter, right?
-Yes.

1069
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:40,777
Hi, I"m Joey WaIIace. Portland Daily News.

1070
01:20:40,852 --> 01:20:43,286
-Hi.
-Sorry I scared you there.

1071
01:20:43,355 --> 01:20:44,583
Guess we"re even.

1072
01:20:44,656 --> 01:20:45,850
How do you mean?

1073
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:49,519
You scared me when I was a IittIe kid,
remember? You had that hand puppet.

1074
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:50,891
KyIe PyIe.

1075
01:20:50,962 --> 01:20:53,829
WaIIace. #62 Chestnut.

1076
01:20:55,066 --> 01:20:58,558
You"ve got an amazing memory.
It"s very impressive. May I?

1077
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:00,262
No, I have to go....

1078
01:21:00,338 --> 01:21:02,238
I"II get right to the point, then.

1079
01:21:02,307 --> 01:21:05,037
I want to write a story
about a door-to-door saIesman.

1080
01:21:05,477 --> 01:21:06,967
Last of a dying....

1081
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,237
Loss of a tradition.

1082
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:12,443
It wouIdn"t necessariIy
have to be just about you.

1083
01:21:12,517 --> 01:21:13,745
Thank you, but, no.

1084
01:21:13,818 --> 01:21:16,184
Take my card, then.
If you change your mind.

1085
01:21:16,922 --> 01:21:19,652
I guess this is where I"m supposed
to pIant my foot...

1086
01:21:19,724 --> 01:21:21,817
...try to keep you
from cIosing the door on me.

1087
01:21:21,893 --> 01:21:24,555
No, don"t do that. That never works.
I have to go.

1088
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:27,154
That"s the kind of thing
I thought we couId taIk about.

1089
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:00,424
Can I come in?

1090
01:22:06,271 --> 01:22:08,865
Nice. Love what you"ve done
with the pIace.

1091
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:12,535
Very funny, SheIIy. What do you want?

1092
01:22:13,144 --> 01:22:15,738
There were three boxes
that were never deIivered.

1093
01:22:15,814 --> 01:22:17,338
What shouId I do with them?

1094
01:22:17,415 --> 01:22:19,440
Can you deIiver them for me?

1095
01:22:20,285 --> 01:22:21,775
You want me to heIp you?

1096
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:22,877
I"II pay you.

1097
01:22:24,389 --> 01:22:26,380
I see, so that"s how it works.

1098
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:28,756
Forget it. I"II take care of it myseIf.

1099
01:22:28,827 --> 01:22:31,887
Shut up. Of course I"II deIiver the boxes.

1100
01:22:31,963 --> 01:22:33,760
I"II take care of it, I said.

1101
01:22:36,234 --> 01:22:39,032
Fine. They"re in my car.

1102
01:22:39,104 --> 01:22:41,129
I"II Ieave them by the front door.

1103
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,702
You quit your job.

1104
01:22:51,449 --> 01:22:52,814
You"re a ceIebrity.

1105
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:55,647
I said no. I didn"t want him to write that.

1106
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,555
Listen, BiII.

1107
01:23:05,296 --> 01:23:08,857
I"ve been thinking about the fight we had.

1108
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:13,629
Maybe I said some things....

1109
01:23:17,008 --> 01:23:20,000
Then you go and quit your job.
I just thought--

1110
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:23,570
No. We both said things.

1111
01:23:27,185 --> 01:23:28,948
And the job....

1112
01:23:30,488 --> 01:23:31,819
It was time.

1113
01:23:33,892 --> 01:23:34,916
What are you gonna do?

1114
01:23:34,993 --> 01:23:37,052
I"m gonna take up kickboxing.

1115
01:23:46,204 --> 01:23:50,106
It"s a nice articIe. You shouId read it.

1116
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:24,931
l never really took notice,
until he wasn"t there anymore.

1117
01:24:26,544 --> 01:24:31,504
This odd man with the funny walk
and the briefcase, and his hat set just so.

1118
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:35,548
One day, he just stopped coming.

1119
01:24:36,755 --> 01:24:38,484
Man, my chiIbIains are kiIIing me.

1120
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:42,582
These hands are so dry. Tried everything.

1121
01:24:46,297 --> 01:24:47,730
He was a thread...

1122
01:24:49,467 --> 01:24:51,662
...an invisible thread in our neighborhood...

1123
01:24:54,072 --> 01:24:55,767
...which tied us together...

1124
01:24:56,608 --> 01:24:58,872
...bringing us news:

1125
01:24:58,943 --> 01:25:00,103
Who died...

1126
01:25:03,982 --> 01:25:05,313
...who moved away...

1127
01:25:07,318 --> 01:25:08,842
...who just got married.

1128
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,923
He"s a door-to-door salesman
for the Watkins Company...

1129
01:25:19,264 --> 01:25:21,630
...who many considered unemployable.

1130
01:25:24,402 --> 01:25:27,269
Mr. Porter, that was a wonderfuI articIe
in the paper.

1131
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,862
I didn"t want that.

1132
01:25:32,577 --> 01:25:33,908
Is Peter in?

1133
01:25:33,978 --> 01:25:36,503
Hi, BiII. It was a great articIe in the paper.

1134
01:25:36,581 --> 01:25:38,412
I didn"t want him to write that.

1135
01:25:38,483 --> 01:25:39,814
Hey, BiII, how you doing?

1136
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:41,283
Can I taIk to you?

1137
01:25:41,352 --> 01:25:43,252
I was just heading out. What"s up?

1138
01:25:43,688 --> 01:25:45,952
I want my territory back, Peter.

1139
01:25:46,124 --> 01:25:49,150
We"ve shut that department down.
There is no more door-to-door.

1140
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:52,719
I don"t need a department. AII I need is--

1141
01:25:52,797 --> 01:25:56,233
BiII, you did the right thing.
You had an amazing run.

1142
01:25:56,301 --> 01:26:00,067
It"s over. Retire. Go fishing, enjoy yourseIf.

1143
01:26:00,138 --> 01:26:03,198
I don"t want to go fishing. I wanna work.

1144
01:26:03,274 --> 01:26:05,105
There must be something you can do.

1145
01:26:05,176 --> 01:26:07,076
Have you checked
with the empIoyment office?

1146
01:26:07,145 --> 01:26:09,943
CarIa, I"m gonna be gone untiI 2:#0.
If StickIey caIIs--

1147
01:26:10,014 --> 01:26:12,312
Peter! Don"t run off. I need two minutes.

1148
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,613
Great seeing you, BiII. Best of Iuck to you.

1149
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,716
WonderfuI piece in the paper, BiII.

1150
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:24,026
I"d Iike to put a copy of it
in the sharehoIder"s report.

1151
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:28,430
What do I care? I"m going fishing.

1152
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,229
What piece in the paper?

1153
01:27:09,941 --> 01:27:11,568
Get off the bus.

1154
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:23,511
A salesman drives down
a dark country road...

1155
01:27:23,788 --> 01:27:25,221
...completely lost.

1156
01:27:26,624 --> 01:27:29,491
After a time, he runs out of gas.

1157
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:33,221
Luckily, there"s a farmhouse
just down the road.

1158
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:38,363
He goes to the farmhouse
and knocks on the door.

1159
01:27:40,071 --> 01:27:44,735
The farmer"s wife comes to the door
and says, ""Can l help you?""

1160
01:27:47,578 --> 01:27:50,069
""Yes, "" he says, ""you can.

1161
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:59,086
""l"ve run out of gas, and l"ve lost my way. ""

1162
01:28:02,593 --> 01:28:04,754
I"II bet you anything.... Try this.

1163
01:28:04,829 --> 01:28:07,855
That the cream you"ve been using
has an aIcohoI base.

1164
01:28:07,932 --> 01:28:10,730
She says, ""You can spend the night. ""

1165
01:28:11,069 --> 01:28:15,267
Put some of this on your fingers.
TeII me if your wife wouIdn"t enjoy this.

1166
01:28:15,573 --> 01:28:18,098
""But l don"t have a daughter...

1167
01:28:20,678 --> 01:28:24,512
""...and you"ll have a nice room
all to yourself.

1168
01:28:27,085 --> 01:28:29,747
""We don"t have any farm animals. ""

1169
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:34,654
AII right, Bob, I"m gonna bring you
some of the sampIes next week.

1170
01:28:35,026 --> 01:28:37,460
That"s fine, BiII. But, no promises.

1171
01:28:37,528 --> 01:28:38,620
Don"t worry.

1172
01:28:38,696 --> 01:28:40,789
""My husband and l are happily married. ""

1173
01:28:40,865 --> 01:28:42,127
A beautifuI day.

1174
01:28:44,535 --> 01:28:46,264
Have a good one, BiII.

1175
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:53,441
The salesman looks around confused...

1176
01:28:53,878 --> 01:28:57,814
...and then he turns back
to the farmer"s wife and says:

1177
01:28:58,783 --> 01:29:01,980
""Gosh. l must be in the wrong joke! ""
