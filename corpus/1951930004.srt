1
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,801
Who the hell's Roderick Blank?

2
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,840
[Narrating]
That would be me.

3
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,479
You ever see a guy
walking down the street

4
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:38,720
looking so happy and content
you wanna find the nearest brick

5
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,280
and turn his face
into hamburger meat?

6
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,880
I'm sorry. That April morning,
I was that guy.

7
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:45,120
I couldn't help it.

8
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:47,040
I had what I thought
at the time to be it all:

9
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,241
excellent job,
excellent soon-to-be wife,

10
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,881
excellent life.

11
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:53,121
If only I hadn't let Trixie
open that last e-mail.

12
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,602
What would you say if I broke out
into song right now?

13
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:58,561
You know how this good mood thing
of yours is killing me, Rod.

14
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:01,441
And yet... you persist.

15
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:03,361
[laughs]
Stop.

16
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:06,362
Stop! Or we're never gonna
get through these e-mails.

17
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:09,681
- [beep]
- Oh. Here's a beauty from Lester.

18
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:12,961
"'Re: Bachelor Party Stripper Crisis."

19
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,122
Have I told you how grateful I am
that I'm a lesbian?

20
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:16,962
Delete! Delete!
My God.

21
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:19,681
Men like Lester are the reason
Death Nell was invented.

22
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:22,560
[Narrating]
I was a man above temptation.

23
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:24,922
Other woman had lost all appeal.

24
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:27,203
One in particular.

25
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,281
They called her Death Nell,

26
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:31,723
even though, technically,
she hadn't killed anyone.

27
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:33,801
Different hairstyles,
different outfits,

28
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:36,162
different spray-painted messages.

29
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,002
- [rasping]
- [puncturing]

30
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:42,403
The same comatose result.

31
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:43,602
[thud]

32
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,843
It was all we could
talk about that spring.

33
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:48,482
Five dates leading
to subversive seduction

34
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,362
and ending in endless slumber.

35
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:52,722
She was the worst thing
to happen to men,

36
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:54,203
and the best thing
to happen to media

37
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:56,763
in quite some time.

38
00:03:56,842 --> 00:03:59,042
Needless to say, I had
picked the perfect moment

39
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:00,842
to be getting out of the game.

40
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:04,643
For every guy or gal,
there comes a time

41
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:07,282
when you say, it’s time.

42
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:11,963
Meet Fiona Wormwood,
my wife-to-be.

43
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,123
Stop staring, perv.

44
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:17,283
[Roderick narrating]
It's funny, looking back.

45
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:19,203
She was not the sweetest girl in the world.

46
00:04:19,283 --> 00:04:20,603
Just, I-- I like-- okay.

47
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:22,083
But when it comes to
the person you're spending

48
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:24,962
the rest of your life with,
you want a bit of a sting.

49
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:26,404
There.

50
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,764
Your married friends
call you up for a barbecue.

51
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,043
-They tell you...
- It's time.

52
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:34,564
Your parents tell you...

53
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:36,883
- Son, it's time.
- [wheezing]

54
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:39,964
The whole damn universe tells you.

55
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:45,843
Don't make me the villain.

56
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:46,923
I told your sister

57
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,964
exactly how many pounds
she had to drop

58
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,443
to fit into that bridesmaid's dress.

59
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:55,164
Enough.
Let's talk about orchids. Orchids.

60
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,643
[Roderick narrating]
Yep. It was time.

61
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:58,605
[Trixie] Okay, if you can
tear yourself back to work...

62
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:00,484
Thank you.
I've downloaded the Big Mac.

63
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:03,364
I mean The Matador!
I don't know.

64
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:05,324
It looks like two all-beef patties,
special sauce,

65
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,164
lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions
on a sesame seed bun to me.

66
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:09,124
Boss.

67
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:11,044
Hey, that's very special sauce--

68
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,364
[Narrating]
As for the "excellent job" part of my life,

69
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:15,845
I like to tell reporters,

70
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:17,404
"It's always been
my dream to work

71
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,004
in a fast-food restaurant."

72
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,325
[chuckles]
I was being cute.

73
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:22,765
Our place was different.
You know...classy.

74
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:24,245
The plan was simple.

75
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,245
Swallow up the food names,
sleek the uniforms,

76
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,564
Starbuck the decor.

77
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,565
[chuckles]
Welcome to Swallows.

78
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,045
One Swallow Cornucopia to go!

79
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,565
Have a startling and unique day.

80
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:36,005
You, too.

81
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,805
Please, Trixie, tell me that was
the last goddamn e-mail.

82
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:40,646
- No, there's one more.
- [beep]

83
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:42,045
- Hold on.
- [computer chirping]

84
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:43,525
Doesn't say who it's from.

85
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:44,965
- [clicking mouse]
- [beep]

86
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,086
I don't know.

87
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:48,245
I'm getting, like, a virus vibe here.

88
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:50,486
Okay! It's your life.

89
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:54,326
Oh, that's weird.

90
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:57,607
It's a list of names.

91
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:59,045
Must be more wedding bullshit.

92
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,965
Well, they're all women's names.

93
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:03,806
Number one-- does the name
Patricia Francini ring a bell?

94
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,286
Patricia Francini?

95
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,166
Whoa, I haven't heard that name in...

96
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:10,166
Patty and I were co-captains
of my high school debate team,

97
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:11,727
her main claim
to fame being that,

98
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,446
in classic backseat drive-in fashion,

99
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:15,366
she took my virginity.

100
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:17,966
Clan of the Cave Bear
was the movie.

101
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:19,326
Drive-in's now a Staples.

102
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:20,846
What did you say this list was?

103
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,526
I didn't, unless Allison Bradbury

104
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:24,966
is the second girl
you ever had sex with.

105
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,927
- Whoa.
- No way.

106
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:29,766
Are you saying this is a list of
everyone you ever had sex with?

107
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,447
- Who's number three?
- [laughing]

108
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:32,687
Well, that would be Debbie Roberts.

109
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,886
No, wait. She was four.

110
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,807
Who was the spooky
drunk girl at the 4-H fair?

111
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:41,407
I had to drive her home,
'cause her brother was, uh--

112
00:06:41,487 --> 00:06:43,728
Daisy Milos Ross?

113
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:45,126
- Yes! Crazy Daisy!
- [typing]

114
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,887
Milos-- what? Ross?

115
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:48,847
Who sent this?

116
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:49,927
Is this some...

117
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:50,886
pre-bachelor party trick,

118
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,048
of all the girls I've loved before?

119
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:56,086
But who would know
about Daisy Milos Ross?

120
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,488
Damn, Roderick, this is
an insane amount of pussy.

121
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,049
Well, thanks.

122
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,407
I don't know if I'd
call 29 women insane.

123
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:04,888
I guess some guys might be impressed
by the big two-nine,

124
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:07,288
but I racked up most of those numbers
as an undergrad.

125
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:08,968
Uh, Sparky?

126
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:12,048
There's more than 29 wild oats
on this list, a lot more.

127
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:15,568
Trix. T. Now, it's not like
I'm one of those silly guys

128
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:16,928
that keeps track
of how many, uh--

129
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,047
[laughs]
All right. Fine.

130
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:19,687
Every guy is one
of those silly guys--

131
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:21,927
Stop! The ever-delightful
Fiona Wormwood,

132
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,569
soon to be Fiona Blank,
is indeed numero 29.

133
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:26,888
But, dude, the list keeps going.

134
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,287
Closing out at...

135
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:30,288
a hundred and one.

136
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:32,048
That's impossible.

137
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:33,848
Wait. April Fool's Day today, isn't it?

138
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,169
That was yesterday.
Today's the second.

139
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:37,687
Hmm...

140
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:38,888
One of the guys.

141
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:40,808
Zack, Chico, Lester--
no, Lester.

142
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:41,889
Especially Lester.

143
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,408
What better way to mess with me

144
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:44,688
than by sending me the names of

145
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,609
all the women I've had sex with?

146
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:49,248
Teasing me
with an obviously made-up roster.

147
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:51,369
72 more tantalizing
female names to, uh--

148
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:53,369
Symbolize all the fine trim you'll be sacrificing

149
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:54,329
once you get married.

150
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,889
Exactly. Yes.

151
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:56,849
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

152
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,409
Mm-hmm.

153
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,049
You sure you don't have
a Carlotta Valdes shacked up somewhere?

154
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:03,168
I mean, according to the list,
she's next up.

155
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,530
- [clicking mouse]
- Carlotta Valdes.

156
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:10,169
Followed by Cynthia Rose.

157
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:11,409
Followed by--

158
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,448
Well, whoever did this
sure put in the hours.

159
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:14,448
Print it.

160
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,329
[speaking Japanese]

161
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,210
Sayonara!

162
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,208
- [door closes]
- [drops objects]

163
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,090
[Narrating]
So, now you know.

164
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,649
The last goddamn e-mail.

165
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:25,450
The list.

166
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:28,730
Every woman I ever,
followed by every woman I--

167
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,490
[Trixie on phone]
You're not still staring at that list.

168
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,770
- [beep]
- No comment.

169
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:35,650
Oh, did I remember to warn you

170
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,850
that you're gonna be kidnapped
from work for your bachelor party?

171
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:38,810
[door opens]

172
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,650
[screaming, whooping]

173
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,210
Whoa!

174
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,371
Hey, Roderick.
How are you doing?

175
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,930
[men chattering]

176
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,850
- Ready to party, Rod?
- Oh, no, no.

177
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,011
No one said anything about
this going down at my house.

178
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:54,970
- Lester.
- What?

179
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,290
This is my house.

180
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,930
Fiona gave us permission.

181
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,450
Oh, you're insane.
[chuckling]

182
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,611
- Interesting e-mail today.
- Mmm!

183
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,330
Worry not.
I found a new stripper.

184
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:05,530
Oh, no. Not the stripper crisis.

185
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,531
The, uh, kooky one. The list.

186
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,251
- What list?
- The list of--

187
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:11,531
- What are you talking about?
- [doorbell]

188
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,011
- Names.
- Well, our fair lady's here, gentlemen!

189
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,372
Turn that up!

190
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,051
Rule six.

191
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,691
No ham radio operating.

192
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,610
- Get it? Breasts?
- [Men] Aww...

193
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,691
No ham radio operating.

194
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,130
Rule seven.
No checking the oil.

195
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:28,012
- [Man] Checking the oil?
- Get it?

196
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:29,291
Vagina!

197
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:31,091
No checking the oil.

198
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:34,931
- And I loved the touch of adding to the list
- Rule eight...

199
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,691
the names of women
I've yet to have sex with.

200
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:39,171
- No cotton candy.
- What do you mean, man? What list?

201
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:40,372
Oh. Yeah. "What list?"

202
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:42,812
Hey! You two jokers
in the back!

203
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:44,452
Show Precious some respect!

204
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:45,611
This is a bachelor party.

205
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:47,251
It ain't fun and games.

206
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:49,451
Who wants to play
musical lap dances?

207
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:51,371
- [men hoot]
- ** [rock]

208
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:54,333
[man snoring]

209
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,212
[rowdy yelling]

210
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,372
- [music stops]
- Aw! Too bad!

211
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:16,813
- [smooch]
- [men chatter]

212
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:17,773
Goodbye!

213
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:20,253
** [rock]

214
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:26,413
[vomiting]

215
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:32,653
Mm. You call this decadence?

216
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:34,572
Bro, it was you!

217
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:36,492
If only women knew.
The bachelor party.

218
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:38,573
The best commercial for marriage.

219
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,213
Cream for your coffee?

220
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:44,253
Mm! Uh, no thanks. Carbs.

221
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:48,973
You laughing at the old coot?

222
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,854
Yeah, I'm sorry. I am.

223
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:51,853
Hey, what about you?

224
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,493
You're walking around
your own party, here,

225
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:55,693
obsessing about
your former conquests.

226
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,093
Well, it's actually
a little more complicated.

227
00:10:57,174 --> 00:10:58,214
I was fine until this morning.

228
00:10:58,293 --> 00:10:59,853
I got this crazy list of women--

229
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:02,133
No! No! No!
I don't wanna see it.

230
00:11:02,214 --> 00:11:03,533
You don't wanna see it.

231
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:05,693
Hell, you probably sent it
to yourself when you were drunk.

232
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:08,095
If you're looking for a way out...

233
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:10,093
Rod, you'll find it.

234
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:12,014
No, it-- it's nothing like that.

235
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:13,374
Stop looking.

236
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:14,855
Hang in here for another hour.

237
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:16,334
Get married next week.
Have a kid.

238
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:18,734
Reinvent the tater tot! Make a lot
of money! Have another kid.

239
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:21,134
- Say, "Thanks, Zack."
- Okay. Thanks, Zack.

240
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,935
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe you're right.

241
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:25,494
Yo! Groom.

242
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:27,373
- Grand finale.
- [men whooping]

243
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,935
Don't worry.
Lester's paid for it.

244
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:30,894
[loud yammering]

245
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:32,054
Yikes.

246
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:34,494
How's that for
ham radio, buddy?

247
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:36,214
- [drunken laughter]
- Yeah!

248
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:38,535
- [Precious giggling] Oh, yeah! Yeah!
- [door knobs jostling]

249
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,616
- [Rod moans]
- [Precious] Give it to me, big boy!

250
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:41,935
[Roderick]
Oh, that's the way you like it?

251
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,374
Oh, yeah! Harder!

252
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,574
[giggling]
This is my oldest. He's four.

253
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:48,815
- Fuck me!
- This is your oldest?

254
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:50,215
Wow. He's a good-looking kid.

255
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:51,534
He's gonna break a lot of hearts.

256
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:53,735
- Yes! Yes!
- [giggles]

257
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:56,175
- Yes!
- Goddammit! Harder!

258
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,935
So are you planning on
having kids with your wife?

259
00:11:58,015 --> 00:11:58,975
Well, definitely. Yeah.

260
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:01,175
But you know, right now, we can't even
agree on what kind of dog to--

261
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:02,856
Whoa! Precious,
I told you I don't want

262
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:04,216
- to cross the line of--
- [unzips]

263
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:05,776
- Whoa!
- [opens condom packet]

264
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:07,175
- Oh, gosh.
- [both laugh]

265
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:08,696
I'm so sorry.

266
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:10,455
I honestly thought
you were kidding about

267
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:12,336
all that "men can be feminists, too" stuff.

268
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,255
Can you blame me for the confusion?

269
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,417
Well, just because I'm giving you

270
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:17,935
a standing ovation, my darling,

271
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:20,256
doesn't mean that we
have to, you know-- I--

272
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:22,217
- I think we better--
- Got it.

273
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:24,015
That's what I'm talking about.
Doin' it--

274
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,697
Hey, I don't want you to take
any of this personally.

275
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:27,976
I just-- you know.

276
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:30,736
Goddamn, what kind
of condom is this?

277
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:31,937
Your fiancée is lucky.

278
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:33,576
She's got one of the good ones.

279
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:35,376
I wish I was more into
successful white dudes,

280
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:36,576
but, um--
[giggles]

281
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,456
two broke Latin husbands, and--

282
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:39,816
Jesus, stop me.
[laughs]

283
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:42,337
Anyway, man, gracias.
Seriously.

284
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,696
Gracias?

285
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:46,697
Um, Precious, your real name

286
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:49,416
wouldn't happen to be Carlotta...

287
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:52,297
- [squish]
- [gasps] Valdes?

288
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:53,497
How did y--

289
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:55,296
Who told you that?

290
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:58,337
Um, I think your bodyguard
might have mentioned it.

291
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:01,456
Like that asshole
knows my real name.

292
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:04,736
So, you staying back there, or...

293
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:07,457
[softly]
Why is it so quiet in there?

294
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:11,138
- [Roderick narrating] Carlotta Valdes.
- [chair squeaking]

295
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:12,737
Number 30.

296
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:15,856
This was more than
a bachelor party trick,

297
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:18,457
more than a loyalty test.

298
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:20,257
This was sex.

299
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:22,258
And I had a print-out.

300
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:26,217
I was in the throes of
a sacrilegious epiphany,

301
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:28,737
in possession of
a magical document

302
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:31,578
that promised
an embarrassment of bitches.

303
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,337
And yet, did it
void my earlier,

304
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:35,897
rather impassioned soliloquy
about how it's time?

305
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:37,938
To settle down?
To marry Fiona?

306
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,377
Right then, I nobly revowed

307
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,098
my eternal resistance
to other women.

308
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:44,098
Remember how freaked out you were
when you first noticed

309
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:46,738
the centerfold was
younger than you?

310
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:49,457
Ah, yes, the...

311
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:52,098
central trauma of
every American male.

312
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:54,979
Look at this baby.

313
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:57,137
- And I mean baby.
- [sirens]

314
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:01,499
Born in 1984. 1984.

315
00:14:01,578 --> 00:14:03,858
My life was, like, done by '84.

316
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:07,178
- What are her turn-ons?
- Mmm....

317
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:09,939
Pudding, air hockey,
and pudding.

318
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:12,898
[sputters]
Bimbo said "pudding" twice.

319
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:15,139
[snickers]

320
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,580
I do like air hockey.

321
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:19,219
"Cynthia Rose is
looking for a man

322
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:23,059
who's confident, successful,
with a nice set of abs."

323
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,459
Well, zero out of three ain't bad.

324
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:27,499
What did you say her name was?

325
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:29,059
[turning pages]

326
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,859
Cynthia Rose.

327
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,019
Nice.

328
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,419
Oh...
[chuckles]

329
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:38,659
Thank you.

330
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:41,299
Dude, you're not
gonna buy the issue?

331
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,260
[footsteps]

332
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,580
You look like a Carl.
Can I call you Carl?

333
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,259
You talking to me?

334
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:55,699
You ever fantasize
about escaping, Carl?

335
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,540
Escaping this land,

336
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,020
this magical land
of the newsstand,

337
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,980
where all the girls
are right about

338
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:06,340
to pull off their panties,
but they never quite do.

339
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:10,100
Must be kind of frustrating.

340
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,020
Look, if you don't like
the merchandise, babe,

341
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:13,261
pssht!

342
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,621
Found this on
your dashboard.

343
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:20,820
It's a unique color.

344
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,061
Kinda like the one
the Parkside Peeper wears.

345
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,941
Wait. Uh...

346
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,781
[sighs heavily]
Look, I have a disease.

347
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,220
- Okay?
- Okay.

348
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,180
And you could say that
I, too, am a victim,

349
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:33,861
- because--
- Hey! No. Carl.

350
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,740
Don't get me wrong.

351
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:37,062
I think it's kinda hot.

352
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:40,900
I mean, how would I know
you were watching

353
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,902
if I wasn't watching you?

354
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:47,541
Wha-- You've been
peeping on me peeping?

355
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:49,342
Mm-hmm.

356
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:51,540
Oh. That is hot.

357
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:53,301
Wait, I c--

358
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:54,462
I can't tell if you're playing

359
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:57,062
some feminazi mindfuck game on me

360
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:59,822
or if you're really trying to seduce me.

361
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:04,902
Well, Carl, why don't we go back
to my hotel and find out?

362
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:08,742
Pussy is da' bomb. No?

363
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:12,101
This is a joke, right?

364
00:16:13,702 --> 00:16:16,542
Ten seconds on
the shot clock, Kobe.

365
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:21,142
- Come on! I--
- [chuckles]

366
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:23,422
- This stuff only happens in the movies--
- Five--

367
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:26,103
I'm the only one
working this shift, I--

368
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,621
Get out of here.

369
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,782
Are you gay?

370
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:32,862
Are you impotent?

371
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,223
Or are you just chicken?

372
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:50,743
Honey?

373
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:51,863
Sweetie, look.

374
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:53,783
Your tuxedo.

375
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:01,663
- Rod?
- [Rod narrating] Perhaps it wasn't

376
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:03,783
time after all.

377
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:06,064
Don't worry, I didn't cancel
the wedding or anything.

378
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:07,704
I'm not an asshole.

379
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:10,624
I needed to figure things out.

380
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:12,864
Of course, I didn't
bring up number 31,

381
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:15,104
Cynthia "Miss April" Rose.

382
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:17,783
I stuck to the basics.

383
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:20,663
"It's not you, it's me."

384
00:17:20,743 --> 00:17:22,704
"I don't want to get married
just to get married."

385
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:26,024
I think I even threw in
a "things have been crazy at work."

386
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:29,143
Fiona took it well... too well.

387
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:33,705
I think my sweetie has
a little case of cold feet.

388
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:35,064
You're nervous.

389
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:36,464
I'd be scared if you weren't.

390
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:37,824
It's more than that, Fi.

391
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:41,784
I said, I think my sweetie
has a little case of cold feet.

392
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:42,944
You're nervous.

393
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:44,424
I'd be scared if you weren't.

394
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:45,624
I'm being honest.

395
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:46,984
We're getting married
in 11 days, Roderick.

396
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:49,465
We are past the point of honesty.

397
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:51,383
We have a goddamn church booked.

398
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:53,864
Deposits...

399
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,184
orchids.

400
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:56,464
And you drop this
on me right now

401
00:17:56,545 --> 00:17:58,065
before I'm about
to get on a plane

402
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,745
to go away with the girls
to a spa for the weekend,

403
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:02,545
you goddamn son of a--

404
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:05,905
Orchids...

405
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,665
[crying]

406
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:11,625
[Narrating]
It was one thing to upheave my own life,

407
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:13,666
but to break the heart of another

408
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:15,824
was too much for me.

409
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:19,025
I told Fiona what
she needed to hear

410
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:22,264
and provided
the requisite snuggles.

411
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:24,305
That's when I saw it.

412
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:27,865
No, not that.

413
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:29,466
This.

414
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:31,666
Pardon my fucking French,

415
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:34,065
but we're talking about
a fucking centerfold here.

416
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,705
Fucking a fucking
centerfold, if you will.

417
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,825
And believe me, I will.

418
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:42,865
Last fling like this, I'll never have to look
at another woman again, right?

419
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:44,066
Right?

420
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:59,387
Back of the line, bro.

421
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:04,066
[chattering]

422
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:06,347
[Man]
Okay, gentlemen, don't rush.

423
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:08,266
[bell jingles]

424
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:11,707
Get out of the way,
will you?

425
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,707
- Don't push! Get out of my way!
- Come on, man!

426
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,427
[men chattering]

427
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:19,466
[Man]
Hey, stay in line, please.

428
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:20,747
[Man #2]
I know how to play air hockey!

429
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,147
[Man]
You each get a chance.

430
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,826
[chattering]

431
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:25,066
[whistles]

432
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:27,187
[camera beeps]

433
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:37,947
Fiona.

434
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,187
Hey, Fi...

435
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:42,588
you're probably
already on the plane.

436
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:45,627
I just wanted to apologize
again for this morning.

437
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:48,108
I don't know what's
going through my head.

438
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,627
- I just--
- Is that your car?

439
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,908
[imitating static]

440
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:52,988
Bad connection. Yeah.

441
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:56,627
The geeks are revolting.
Like, literally.

442
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,069
My name's Cynthia Rose.

443
00:19:58,148 --> 00:19:59,827
- You can call me Cyn.
- Okay.

444
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,987
- [bells jingle]
- [starts engine]

445
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:03,588
[tires screeching]

446
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:04,908
The guy was so serious.

447
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:06,468
"You must be
so proud of those."

448
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:08,468
I was like,
"Dude, they're my breasts,

449
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:09,668
they're not my S.A.T. scores."

450
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:12,148
So, I thought if I flashed him
he'd shut up,

451
00:20:12,228 --> 00:20:14,429
but who knew the whole store
would flip out?

452
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:15,628
I'm sorry, I forgot.

453
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,548
How long did you say
you've been living on this planet?

454
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:19,828
[laughs]

455
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:21,428
[Narrating]
Coffee became cocktails,

456
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:25,070
cocktails became dinner,
and dinner became...

457
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:27,629
You guessed it.

458
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:29,989
Air hockey.

459
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:32,268
Darn it!

460
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:33,509
I thought your centerfold

461
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:35,149
said air hockey was your game.

462
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:37,709
Are you always this
suave and arrogant?

463
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:40,989
Well, it's only two
of my many adjectives.

464
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:42,509
I can't believe
I'm talking like this.

465
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,909
I'm getting married
in less than two weeks.

466
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:48,989
My fiancée is doing this
bachelorette spa thing this weekend--

467
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:49,949
Wait a minute,
you're getting married?

468
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:51,030
Yep.

469
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:52,829
Well, why didn't you say so?

470
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:55,670
That changes everything!

471
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,989
How would you like
to do me a favor?

472
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,069
A favor?
What kind of fav--

473
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,149
Don't worry.
It'll end in sex.

474
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,269
[Trixie]
Yes, number 31, Cynthia Rose.

475
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,550
You know this is the most
maniacal shit ever, right?

476
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:11,749
Trix, I'm sure there's some
logical explanation for all this.

477
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,710
I'm not going to
wait around for it.

478
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,951
- [snaps]
- Keys?

479
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,950
[Roderick narrating]
Cynthia Rose wanted to bring

480
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,431
a presentable man
home to Daddy.

481
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,830
The favor would last
another 24 hours.

482
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,190
Meeting another father
under the guise of boyfriend

483
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:29,590
felt more like cheating
than the cheating.

484
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,790
But as paper beats rock,
desire beats guilt.

485
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,711
Desire beats everything.

486
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,271
[Cynthia]
I just said that I like baking,

487
00:21:37,351 --> 00:21:39,870
and the next day, the centerfold
family came up with this concept.

488
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,791
It was like
a built-in kitchen set

489
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:42,751
with this apron that--

490
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:44,670
Don't abuse the word "family.”

491
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:45,991
You know as well as I do,

492
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,351
they're just making you
an accomplice

493
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,950
in your own exploitation.

494
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,431
Well, that's better than
not being an accomplice

495
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:52,351
in my own exploitation.

496
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:55,191
You asked me what makes a man,
Roderick, and I'm going to tell you.

497
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:58,271
[Roderick narrating]
Actually, I hadn't asked.

498
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:00,791
But there was no stopping Victor Rose III.

499
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:03,432
Yes, her father
was the Victor Rose,

500
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:05,790
entrepreneur extraordinaire.

501
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:06,751
Getting to have sex tonight

502
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:08,111
was going to be more complicated

503
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:09,230
than I could ever imagine.

504
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:11,031
My parents believed in tradition,

505
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:13,911
honor, dignity, faith, and free trade,

506
00:22:13,992 --> 00:22:17,152
and separate bedrooms for couples
that are not married.

507
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:21,392
A toast to the fiery Rose family.

508
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,071
- [woman groaning]
- May you--

509
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:24,870
Sorry, Roderick.

510
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,791
Every family has
a sick grandmother,

511
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:28,592
and Granny C just happens to be

512
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:30,471
really old and really scary.

513
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:32,672
Stop! Mother deserves
some respect,

514
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,152
not to be treated like a leper.

515
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:37,272
Despite her grotesque skin disease.

516
00:22:37,351 --> 00:22:39,913
[high-pitched moaning]

517
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:43,073
Dessert, Roderick?

518
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:44,192
[knocking]

519
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:45,152
[Roderick]
Are you decent?

520
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:47,153
[Cynthia]
Absolutely!

521
00:22:50,073 --> 00:22:51,713
[mimicking Victor]
Dessert, Roderick?

522
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:53,273
[snickers]

523
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:56,111
Oh. Uh...

524
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:57,833
You asked if I was decent.
You didn't ask if--

525
00:22:57,912 --> 00:23:01,191
Yes, my roommate in college
always used to do that gag.

526
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:02,432
It plays better with you.

527
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:03,392
Lots.

528
00:23:03,472 --> 00:23:06,033
Believe it or not,
you did pretty good tonight.

529
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:07,272
Great.

530
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:08,993
That old bear down the hall

531
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:11,153
is going to be simply crushed
when we break up.

532
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:13,273
You know, your father
seems pretty serious

533
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:15,633
about the separate bedroom edict.

534
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:18,993
The greater the danger,
the greater the thrill.

535
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:21,073
That's what I say.

536
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:22,793
Give me five minutes.

537
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:25,233
I'm two doors down to the left.

538
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,793
Some guys have this annoying habit
of stopping to ask me

539
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,274
if they're boinking me too hard.

540
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,873
Don't ask and don't stop.

541
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,913
Foreplay's for losers.

542
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:38,632
Hmm.

543
00:23:38,714 --> 00:23:40,674
Better make that three minutes.

544
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,274
Yeah.

545
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,474
- [puts on condom]
- [sighs]

546
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:21,154
- [moaning softly]
- [woman moaning softly]

547
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:23,515
[both moaning louder]

548
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,035
Oh...yes.

549
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:29,875
[Victor]
What's going on in there?

550
00:24:41,675 --> 00:24:43,795
Ooh, who died?

551
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:46,514
It's all right, Roderick.

552
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:49,036
Mother prayed for
this day many times.

553
00:24:49,116 --> 00:24:51,515
She's at peace now.

554
00:24:51,595 --> 00:24:53,796
She can keep my son company.

555
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:55,875
Say hello to Vic, Jr., Mommy!

556
00:24:55,956 --> 00:25:00,395
Cyn. Sir, I'm so sorry.

557
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:02,516
- You must really--
- Yeah, whatever.

558
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:04,756
She was ancient
and my brother was a jerk.

559
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,675
What was with you last night?

560
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:07,835
Why didn't you come?

561
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,155
Come?

562
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:10,516
With your father
barging in like that,

563
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:11,796
didn't really leave a lot of time

564
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,836
for either one of us
to hit the jackpot.

565
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,556
You know, as they say,

566
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:16,716
if at first you don't succeed,

567
00:25:16,796 --> 00:25:18,756
try, try again.

568
00:25:18,837 --> 00:25:19,636
What are you talking about?

569
00:25:19,716 --> 00:25:20,956
Why didn't you come to my room?

570
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:22,116
I didn't see you at all.

571
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:23,397
I guess it was
pretty dark, but--

572
00:25:23,476 --> 00:25:24,717
Mother had the strangest,

573
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:26,676
sweetest, little smile on her face.

574
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:28,676
I'm convinced that her last moments

575
00:25:28,756 --> 00:25:31,357
on this mortal coil
were ones of pleasure.

576
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:34,116
When you said
two doors to the left,

577
00:25:34,197 --> 00:25:35,957
did you mean
your left or my left?

578
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:37,556
What are you talking--

579
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:40,517
I don't know, I guess
it was my left. Why?

580
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:46,558
Granny C happens to be
really old and...

581
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:49,597
C. as in Cynthia,
as in Cynthia Rose,

582
00:25:49,677 --> 00:25:51,397
as in number 31 on your list,

583
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:54,317
as in there's more than one, dipshit!

584
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:56,397
You fucked my mother!

585
00:25:56,477 --> 00:26:00,398
[screaming]

586
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,398
- [slams door]
- [screaming continues]

587
00:26:08,238 --> 00:26:11,118
[screaming, crying]

588
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:14,918
And if you were to put
your hand on the bun...

589
00:26:14,997 --> 00:26:16,558
[screaming]

590
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:19,198
[Narrating]
I raced home to tell Fiona everything.

591
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,518
Okay, not everything.

592
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:21,837
Not anything.

593
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:23,398
What woman, a week
before her wedding,

594
00:26:23,477 --> 00:26:25,558
wants to hear about
some crazy list of women?

595
00:26:25,638 --> 00:26:27,638
Not to mention, I mean
really not to mention,

596
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:28,997
her future husband's involvement

597
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:31,038
with an 88-year-oId Ieper.

598
00:26:31,118 --> 00:26:33,638
I was sure Fiona would
take me into her arms.

599
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,678
- Honey, I'm home!
- Instead, she just took.

600
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:38,638
I never liked this couch.

601
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:40,318
Fi?

602
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,279
Fiona, what have you done?

603
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,159
- Why are you--
- You're getting off easy and you know it.

604
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,679
I don't understand.
I adore you.

605
00:26:55,758 --> 00:26:57,238
I want to make you my wife.

606
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:01,399
It's like you've got
this lost, far-away look,

607
00:27:01,478 --> 00:27:03,599
like you're thinking about
the hundreds of other women

608
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,479
you plan to sleep with
before you die.

609
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,239
Hundreds?

610
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,440
70 at most.

611
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,680
Keep going.

612
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,840
You're the guy
who notices haircuts.

613
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,718
- You never forget Valentine's Day.
- No.

614
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,360
You always have the right,
supportive thing to say,

615
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,679
even if you don't mean it.

616
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,360
You're not some evil,
sexist jerk, Rod.

617
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,120
So who are you?

618
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,880
I am someone that will
love and support you--

619
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,439
Oh.

620
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,999
It's not an oral exam.

621
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:42,320
I'm going to get up
off this couch now.

622
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,520
I'm going to walk to the door.

623
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,279
[sighs]

624
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:50,760
Do I want you to stop me?

625
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,719
Yes.

626
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:59,480
Just as my hand is on the knob,

627
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,119
I want you to tackle me

628
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:06,681
and hold me and tell me
that you can never let me go,

629
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:08,880
while tears stream
down both our faces.

630
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:12,841
But you better mean it, Rod.

631
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,960
Because right now,

632
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,201
you're just one
of the bigger mistakes

633
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,120
I've ever made.

634
00:28:20,121 --> 00:28:22,602
But if you convince me to stay,

635
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:28,361
and you can't back it up
with every inch of your soul,

636
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,641
then you will be a true villain.

637
00:28:41,282 --> 00:28:42,922
- Good call, buddy!
- Ah!

638
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:44,361
You made the right
decision, Mr. Blank,

639
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:46,161
but it's not like
you had much of a choice.

640
00:28:46,242 --> 00:28:47,642
Whoo!

641
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,522
[snorts]

642
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:52,922
Okay, what's happening?

643
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:56,882
Where am I?

644
00:28:56,962 --> 00:28:58,642
Who are you people?

645
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:00,041
Hello, Mr. Blank.

646
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:02,563
I'm Alpha, he's Beta,

647
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:04,203
and that's Fred.

648
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:07,042
[Beta]
We're here to tell you everything, Mr. Blank.

649
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:08,243
This isn't a dream,

650
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:10,522
and it isn't a dream
within a dream, either.

651
00:29:10,602 --> 00:29:12,041
You're not going
to wake up at the end,

652
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:14,802
and I'm your gardener
and these are your pool boys.

653
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:16,883
This is about the list, isn't it?

654
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,163
[scoffs]
Of course it's about the list!

655
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:20,962
You must be freaking out.

656
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:23,282
Seriously, what number
are you at right now--

657
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:24,644
Down, Fred.

658
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:29,323
Mr. Blank...

659
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:30,962
some people you don't know

660
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:32,083
found some things you don't know

661
00:29:32,163 --> 00:29:34,243
in a place you don't know.

662
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:37,482
And these things have been
very useful in making a new thing.

663
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:39,523
One that apparently
knows everything.

664
00:29:40,484 --> 00:29:41,923
A thing that knows everything,

665
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:47,083
like a computer, a supercomputer.

666
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:50,603
I prefer the word "machine."

667
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:53,523
Now, this machine will take
a few lifetimes to figure out,

668
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:56,164
and I wouldn't go as far
as to call it an oracle,

669
00:29:56,244 --> 00:29:59,604
but it is...oraclesque.

670
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:03,083
Last week, it sent out
about 2,900 e-mails,

671
00:30:03,164 --> 00:30:05,205
answers to questions nobody asked--

672
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:08,524
not us, not the e-mail recipients.

673
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:12,004
Almost everyone received nothing more
than an individual date--

674
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:15,885
day, month, year.

675
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:17,883
You're very lucky you didn't
get that one, Mr. Blank.

676
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:20,764
It was the day
of the recipient's death.

677
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:23,124
But then there's you.

678
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,764
Yes, a few of the e-mails

679
00:30:25,845 --> 00:30:27,884
drew an unnatural
attention to themselves.

680
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:32,085
Well, yeah, but yours
is the best, far and away.

681
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,685
A list of everyone you're
going to have sex with?

682
00:30:35,764 --> 00:30:38,324
Oh man, this other poor dick
got the same list.

683
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:39,525
One name!

684
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,765
The wife that he lost
his virginity to.

685
00:30:42,844 --> 00:30:43,724
What a sap!

686
00:30:43,804 --> 00:30:44,804
- Fred--
- I mean, can you imagine?

687
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,684
[Beta]
Fred!

688
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:51,085
Mr. Blank, I think you know
where I'm going with this.

689
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:54,685
If people were to find out
about the machine,

690
00:30:54,764 --> 00:30:56,684
it would cause panic
and confusion and--

691
00:30:56,766 --> 00:30:58,325
You're threatening me?

692
00:30:58,406 --> 00:31:02,606
Not to be a smart-ass.

693
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:06,285
If your little oracle is for real,

694
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,046
then I can't die
before bedding down

695
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:10,245
the last lady on the list.

696
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:13,806
Grand to finally
meet you, Mr. Blank.

697
00:31:13,886 --> 00:31:15,766
The door is at
the end of the hall.

698
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:18,286
Yeah, and if you
have any questions,

699
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:20,405
drop in any time, bro.

700
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:24,126
Can't believe
I believe all this.

701
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:26,686
But you do,
and we appreciate it.

702
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:29,687
You've been guaranteed
a robust sex life, Mr. Blank.

703
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,446
That should be enough for you.

704
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:32,886
Lose the list.

705
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:35,726
Burn it, bury it,
whatever you need to do.

706
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:37,406
If you let the list in your life,

707
00:31:37,486 --> 00:31:41,207
it will infect
every fiber of your being.

708
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:43,766
Bye-bye.

00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:55,167

[bike bell rings]

711
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:01,847
I like him.

712
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:03,927
He seems sensible.

713
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,246
Hey, hey, uh, almighty, all-knowing guys?

714
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:12,006
You just confirmed the validity
of a list of 101 sure things.

715
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:16,607
Okay? So, a list like that,
doesn't get burned or buried.

716
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:18,007
It gets used.

717
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:22,406
And I mean, it gets, like,
crazy-montage-sequence used.

718
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:25,008
"French-New Wave,
learning Gymkata,

I can't believe they could afford
that song" montage.

720
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:29,568
[laughing]
It's gonna be fucking nuts!

721
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:30,848
He's just--

722
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:36,008
He's going to fuck a lot.

723
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:46,248

00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:04,288
* I'm surrounded softly *

726
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:06,688
* By the beat *

727
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:10,008
* Still dumbfounded *

728
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:15,768
* By the intolerable heat *

729
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:19,688
* You came close to me *

730
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:22,489
* And you danced *

731
00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:27,250
* It came close to *

732
00:33:27,329 --> 00:33:31,809
* Being my last *

733
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:34,369

* Before I regret it *

735
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,209
I'm saving that seat
for a friend.

736
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:42,209
What's your name?

737
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:45,049
Kathleen, Mr. Manners.

738
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:47,449
- That's a shame.
- What did you say?

739
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,850
Oh, I said, it's a nice name.

740
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:51,409
Roderick Blank.

741
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,770
Ooh, first and last names,
how formal.

742
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,969
- Well...
- Ah.

743
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:00,091
Here's my standing up friend
and colleague Greta Sampsa.

744
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,970
This is the guy who took your seat.

745
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,050
Greta Sampsa, now that's
a fantastic name.

746
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,129
What would you like?

747
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,210
A slow, nasty fuck
on the coffee table.

748
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,091
Would you like that
with Bacardi or Myer's?

749
00:34:10,171 --> 00:34:12,529
Bacardi.

750
00:34:12,611 --> 00:34:13,650
[laughs]

751
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:15,371
Did you know I was
talking about a drink?

752
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,370
Maybe, maybe not.

00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,971
* I'll take what's mine before I... *

00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,812
This your only piece of ID?

You swear you're
not named after

756
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,491
anyone else in your family?

757
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,451
Listen, you're cute and I'm drunk,

758
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:32,290
and my plane is grounded
until tomorrow,

759
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,450

[Narrating] I'd say that
I was mature and content.

783
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:45,812
But if you have to say
that stuff out loud,

784
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,572
it can't possibly be true.

785
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:49,932
I thought I was above
all the hot chicks,

786
00:35:50,013 --> 00:35:52,494
high-five,
beer-commercial bullshit.

787
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:54,852
I was above nothing.

00:35:57,014 --> 00:35:58,654
The list was life.

Wait a second,
how did you know my name?

792
00:36:06,974 --> 00:36:09,694
Swallows is the case study
in my business class.

793
00:36:09,774 --> 00:36:11,452
I thought I'd get some first-hand experience

794
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:13,013
and make a little money
at the same time.

795
00:36:13,094 --> 00:36:13,973
Very little money.

796
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:16,734
That's fascinating...

00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,934
Yeah, yeah!

the honey mustard sauce

804
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:31,053
really brings out the flavor.

[Roderick narrating]
April to August,

812
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:52,054
I went from number 29
to number 62.

813
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:54,335
Maybe I was moving too fast.

814
00:36:54,415 --> 00:36:56,575
But then, I guess
I was supposed to.

815
00:36:56,655 --> 00:37:00,254
I crossed out the names,
but remembered the faces.

816
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:03,414
Their stare, my stare.

817
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:06,135
We think if we exchange
the meaningful stare,

818
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:08,214
the meaning will kick in later.

819
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:09,935
But does it?

820
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:12,095
One or both of you
try to say something like,

821
00:37:12,176 --> 00:37:13,735
"It's just sex."

822
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,775

Stop having hot sex.

00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,174
Get your ass up to the house
for a barbeque.

834
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:35,056
It is my boy Max's birthday.

835
00:37:35,135 --> 00:37:37,256

When my wedding was canceled,

838
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:51,056
there had been a chill
among the married folk.

839
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,257
You'd have thought
I'd left them at the altar.

But now they kind of
like having me around.

841

The ladies' man.

00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:07,696
Lizzie is an amazing
woman, Zack.

843
00:38:07,777 --> 00:38:09,975
I mean, what she's done with that clinic.
[whistles]

844
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:11,256
The way she's raised
your two kids.

845
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:13,216
Yeah, yeah, my wife's
a goddamn saint.

846
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:15,016
Now, this stewardess,
did she say,

847
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:18,296
"Come on my ass"
or "Come in my ass?"

848
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:20,216
Oh, Roderick's definition
of having children

849
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:22,136
is a little different than ours.

850
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,816
Why raise them
when you can pork them?

851
00:38:23,898 --> 00:38:25,017
Ooh!

852
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:26,736
Lizzie, how many times
do I have to tell you?

853
00:38:26,817 --> 00:38:28,296
I didn't know
she was your niece.

854
00:38:28,378 --> 00:38:32,258
Besides, she's 19-- and a half.

855
00:38:32,337 --> 00:38:34,818
And I found her to be
very mature for her age.

[women grousing]

857
00:38:35,937 --> 00:38:37,537

Husbands, wives,

kids, families.

860
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:45,737
It was not just a world
I was supposed to want,

861
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:48,178
it was a world
I genuinely wanted.

862
00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:49,778
What's life without experiencing

863
00:38:49,857 --> 00:38:51,777
the wonder of a child?

864
00:38:53,057 --> 00:38:55,859
- [Boy] I named my hamster Dog.
- Oh.

865
00:38:55,938 --> 00:38:59,338
And when I get a dog, I'm going
to name him after you.

866
00:38:59,418 --> 00:39:02,817
- [chuckles]
- Mr. Butt.

867
00:39:08,257 --> 00:39:09,898
You about ready?

00:39:11,698 --> 00:39:13,898
- Yeah.

869
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:17,858
You know,
maybe they're right.

870
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,778
I should lower the old periscope
for a while,

871
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,219
hold out for someone special.

872
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:22,337
Special?

873
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:24,499
If the subject is
cooking or crab grass,

874
00:39:24,578 --> 00:39:26,178
then you can listen
to married people.

875
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:27,538
Come on.

876
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:29,579
You're hitting baskets
from everywhere on the court.

877
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,739
This is no time
to go back to the bench.

878
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:33,418
Hey. I'm Bob.

879
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,059
- Rod, is it?
- Yeah.

880
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,138
My apologies, I just--
I couldn't help overhearing

881
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:40,419
your good fortune with
the female of the species.

882
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:41,819
I'm hoping it'll rub off.

883
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:43,579
And why is that, kind sir?

884
00:39:43,658 --> 00:39:45,780
Oh, funny story.

885
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:47,620
One morning
about five months ago,

886
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,099
I came to work, and right there
on my computer screen,

887
00:39:50,178 --> 00:39:52,259
a day, a month and a year.

888
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:54,779
A date. Today's date.

889
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,219
I'm utterly convinced
that it's a sign.

890
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,620
The night that
I'm to meet my soul mate.

891
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,220
- [sotto voce] You had to ask him.
- I've gone as far

892
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,580
as to procure lodgings
down the street

893
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:04,459
at the Hotel Taboo.

894
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:07,100
Kind of spicy.

895
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,539
Wait.

896
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,500
You received an unexplained date
as an e-mail?

897
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,620
Yeah.

898
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,259
Your next drink's on me.

899
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,740
Oh, how very kind of you.

900
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:26,900
** [woman vocalizing]

901
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,980
** [rock]

902
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,300
Oh...

903
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,541
I'd like to be the meat
in that fairy sandwich.

904
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:51,100
So out of your league
in so many ways.

905
00:40:53,421 --> 00:40:56,661
* I need two girls *

906
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,621
* If I can't have you *

907
00:40:58,701 --> 00:41:00,541
- Holy lesbo.
- [laughing]

908
00:41:00,621 --> 00:41:02,381
Is that Bambi and Thumper?

909
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,941
* I need two girls *

910
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:06,100
* If I can't have you *

911
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,100
All right, Trix, they're all yours.

912
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:09,061
I'm out.

913
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:10,621
- [Trixie laughs]
- Where's he--

914
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,181
What league are we
talking about here?

915
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,861
You don't know Bambi Kidd
and Thumper Wint?

916
00:41:14,941 --> 00:41:16,661
The Euro-Prague rock superstar

917
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,541
and the British astronaut?

918
00:41:18,622 --> 00:41:20,621
Rod! The Blog!

919
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:22,101
The reality show.

920
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:24,742
The daily streaming video.

921
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:27,502
They are the Beyond-Ultimate
Lesbian Power Couple.

922
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:29,142
They go from town to town,

923
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:31,742
mm, raising awareness
on important issues

924
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,581
by empowering young women...

925
00:41:33,662 --> 00:41:35,342
and then seducing them.

926
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:36,983
I'm hoping for an autograph.

927
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:40,902
Or a three-way.

928
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:42,861
Oh, back off,
they're looking over here.

929
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:46,902
[Roderick narrating] My friends,
it's not about buying them flowers.

930
00:41:46,983 --> 00:41:50,222
It's not about pretending
to ignore them.

931
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:53,462
It's all about just knowing.

932
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:56,702
I know, easy for me to say.

933
00:41:57,823 --> 00:42:00,742
Bambi and Thumper, was it?

934
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:05,422
Bambi and Thumper.

935
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:08,662
W-Why are they staring at you?

936
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:09,903
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

937
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:11,862
Don't tell me one of them
is on that fucking list.

938
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:16,422
- That list of fucking--
- No, one of them is not on the list.

939
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:25,623
[Narrating]
But you see, even before the list,

940
00:42:25,702 --> 00:42:27,983
I always knew just knowing

941
00:42:28,064 --> 00:42:31,623
beats any gift, tactic,
or opening line,

942
00:42:31,704 --> 00:42:33,744
no matter what
the sexual orientation.

943
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:37,184
* If I can't have you *

944
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,383
* One that I can love *

945
00:42:40,463 --> 00:42:42,264
* To have and to hold *

946
00:42:42,344 --> 00:42:43,264
* One for at the club *

947
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:46,063
Wish me luck.

948
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:49,184
I may be coming in late tomorrow.

949
00:42:49,264 --> 00:42:50,223
Rod?

950
00:42:57,983 --> 00:43:00,264
Hey, Rod! Hey!

951
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,424
Hey, I found her!

952
00:43:02,504 --> 00:43:03,704
She's the one!

953
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:05,703
Can you-- What a night!

954
00:43:08,104 --> 00:43:10,385
[sighs]
What a night, indeed.

955
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:13,704
Hey, have you thought any more
about my offer, my love?

956
00:43:13,785 --> 00:43:15,864
I mean, yours are nice,
don't get me wrong.

957
00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:17,584
Really, really nice,

958
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:19,985
but is there really
such a thing as too big?

959
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:23,905
- Let's just enjoy this moment.
- All right.

960
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:26,026
Just, you know, with my position
at the company,

961
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:28,505
I get a 40% discount on
whatever kind of implant you want.

962
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:29,465
- [spraying]
- Hey, Bob.

963
00:43:29,545 --> 00:43:31,984
Seriously, enjoy the moment.

964
00:43:32,065 --> 00:43:33,825
Okay. You win.

965
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:35,545
- [laughs, sighs]
- [spraying continues]

966
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:39,065
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

967
00:43:39,145 --> 00:43:42,945
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

968
00:43:43,025 --> 00:43:46,826
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

969
00:43:46,905 --> 00:43:50,546
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

970
00:43:51,745 --> 00:43:52,625
Drink?

971
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:56,505
Don't mind if I do.

972
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:03,025
Is the gentleman surprised
that he's here?

973
00:44:03,105 --> 00:44:04,265
No, the gentleman is not.

974
00:44:04,345 --> 00:44:06,627
Oh! Did you hear that,
Miss Kidd?

975
00:44:06,706 --> 00:44:08,505
He's very cocky.

976
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:11,346
Accent on the cock, Miss Wint.

977
00:44:11,426 --> 00:44:12,546
[chuckles]

978
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:16,466
Boy, my assistant
is gonna kill me--

979
00:44:16,546 --> 00:44:19,266
That is so sweet.
He is trying to talk to us.

980
00:44:19,346 --> 00:44:23,706
Man-guy, just sign the confidentiality
agreement on the table.

981
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,666
Now.

982
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,547
The kind sir does understand

983
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:30,147
a vegan doesn't tell her friends

984
00:44:30,226 --> 00:44:33,067
that she just wolfed down
a greasy cheeseburger.

985
00:44:33,147 --> 00:44:35,586
[swing squeaks]

986
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:38,746
Yes, the kind sir
understands... kind of.

987
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:41,346
Bottoms up.

988
00:45:26,627 --> 00:45:28,428
- [woman screams]
- [thud]

989
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:30,069
[laughs]
Whoa!

990
00:45:30,149 --> 00:45:33,269
Looks like everyone's having
a good time tonight, huh?

991
00:45:33,348 --> 00:45:34,788
So what do you say
about round two?

992
00:45:34,868 --> 00:45:36,188
I may need a little
in about 30 minutes.

993
00:45:36,268 --> 00:45:38,188
And I'd like you to meet
my family, if that's okay.

994
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,069
I was thinking, I'm from, uh--

995
00:45:42,548 --> 00:45:44,389
Oh, my God!
Is that paint?

996
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:45,949
- Does that come off?
- [chuckling]

997
00:45:46,029 --> 00:45:47,108
Wh-- why would you do that?

998
00:45:47,188 --> 00:45:48,588
I put this room
on my credit card.

999
00:45:48,668 --> 00:45:50,628
What are you trying to do,
imitate that disturbed woman

1000
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:51,868
who's going around...

1001
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:54,468
Oh, dear.

1002
00:45:56,108 --> 00:45:58,069
What can I say, Bob?

1003
00:45:58,148 --> 00:46:01,149
Some dreams are
too true to be good.

1004
00:46:01,229 --> 00:46:03,909
Well, I must say,
you're being a real cun--

1005
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:05,789
uh-- I didn't say it--

1006
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:08,148
cunning woman, you are.

1007
00:46:08,229 --> 00:46:10,389
That's what I was--
I was g-- help?

1008
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,389
[Bambi, in next room]
Ow! I was faking it!

1009
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:14,189
Don't tell me you
were faking it, Miss Kidd.

1010
00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:16,510
I know when you're faking it,
and you did that thing with your toes!

1011
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:19,709
- No...
- Bambi, Thumper, please, don't fight.

1012
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,390
You said you wouldn't
get jealous, Miss Wint!

1013
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:23,148
[yelping, grunting]

1014
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,989
Okay. Maybe fight
a little more.

1015
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:27,949
This is not about sex!
This is about intimacy!

1016
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,110
Real intimacy!

1017
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:30,310
That's it.
Turn the cameras off.

1018
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:31,910
Keep the camera rolling!

1019
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,749
- Cameras? Rolling?
- [thud]

1020
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:36,549
Oh, no, no. No, this is crazy.
You can't film this!

1021
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,429
Well, you did know the confidentiality
agreement's really a release form.

1022
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:40,630
Haven't you seen our show?

1023
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,709
Don't you change
the subject, Star Whore.

1024
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:44,949
[Thumper laughing]

1025
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,070
- [glass shatters]
- [squealing, struggling]

1026
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,270
Help me, somebody!
It's her! She's here!

1027
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,951
I think they're kind of having

1028
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,349
some problems of
their own there, Bob.

1029
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:56,630
Please! Just tell me
what you want from me!

1030
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,431
Why don't you sleep on it, Bob?

1031
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,390
Take forever, if you have to.

1032
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:02,470
Don't. Please. Please.

1033
00:47:02,551 --> 00:47:04,031
Please wait. Just wait. Wait.

1034
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:05,270
I-- This is not fair.

1035
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:07,111
It's not like I hit you,
or roofied you,

1036
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,470
or openly exploited you in--

1037
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,751
Oh, this is the breast
implant thing? Okay.

1038
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:13,030
Look, I'm just
the company accountant.

1039
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:15,471
I keep the books! Please!

1040
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:18,311
All I need to know is, why?
I deserve a good reason--

1041
00:47:18,391 --> 00:47:20,231
Why do men always
get to have reasons?

1042
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:23,471
Did you think women get to have
reasons when they get attacked?

1043
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:25,510
I want everyone on red alert here.

1044
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:28,671
Although you do bring up
a legitimate point.

1045
00:47:28,751 --> 00:47:30,591
I mean, you're not
Master Bitchslap

1046
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:32,751
or the Parkside Peeper.

1047
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:35,152
Or even that captain
of the lacrosse team, who--

1048
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:36,351
Whoap!

1049
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:37,952
[thud]

1050
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,111
Bob?

1051
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:42,391
Oh...Bob.

1052
00:47:44,272 --> 00:47:47,231
- [car drives by]
- Aw, pilgrim.

1053
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:50,792
Guess it was just your time.

1054
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:53,992
- [Bambi and Thumper struggling, yelping]
- [objects breaking]

1055
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,072
[groans]

1056
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:57,871
[screaming, shattering]

1057
00:47:57,952 --> 00:47:59,992
Oh, yeah...

1058
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:01,671
What a night.

1059
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:03,231
- [whimper]
- [sighs]

1060
00:48:11,632 --> 00:48:13,671
What time do you have to
be down at the new location?

1061
00:48:13,753 --> 00:48:15,712
Trixie?

1062
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:17,632
Hey, I'm sorry about last night.

1063
00:48:17,712 --> 00:48:18,912
If it makes you feel any better,

1064
00:48:18,992 --> 00:48:21,434
it was the most
traumatic night of my--

1065
00:48:21,513 --> 00:48:23,192
Okay, well, it wasn't all bad, but...

1066
00:48:23,272 --> 00:48:25,793
I'm sorry. It's always been a fantasy
to be with two women at once.

1067
00:48:25,872 --> 00:48:29,352
You know, lesbians,
rock stars, astronauts.

1068
00:48:29,432 --> 00:48:30,513
Okay, maybe not astronauts.

1069
00:48:30,593 --> 00:48:33,073
But you know, sexy female
space travelers.

1070
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:34,792
You're giving the finger
to the intercom box, aren't you?

1071
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:37,073
- [screaming, struggling]
- [Roderick] I know. I know.

1072
00:48:37,153 --> 00:48:38,593
I lied about 'em
being on the list.

1073
00:48:38,673 --> 00:48:40,754
The list. Damn it!

1074
00:48:41,033 --> 00:48:42,713
Don't get me wrong,
a piece of paper that tells me

1075
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,073
whether or not
I'm gonna get lucky,

1076
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:46,033
you're not gonna say
anything bad about, but...

1077
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:48,352
it's-- it's like...

1078
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:50,114
watching a tape
of a football game,

1079
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,033
and you know your team wins.

1080
00:48:51,113 --> 00:48:52,593
It's not unenjoyable,

1081
00:48:52,674 --> 00:48:54,873
but can it really compare
to watching the game live,

1082
00:48:54,953 --> 00:48:56,433
and they're going for it
on the fourth down?

1083
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:58,314
- And you don't know if--
- Sports metaphors...

1084
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,794
aren't my thing.

1085
00:48:59,873 --> 00:49:01,593
But it sounds like you're going for

1086
00:49:01,673 --> 00:49:02,674
"The thrill of the pursuit

1087
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:04,473
is more exciting than the conquest."

1088
00:49:04,553 --> 00:49:05,433
I can't help it!

1089
00:49:05,513 --> 00:49:06,554
I mean, I see the name,

1090
00:49:06,634 --> 00:49:08,393
I want to find her and meet her,

1091
00:49:08,475 --> 00:49:11,074
so I can cross her out,
and I can get to the next name.

1092
00:49:11,874 --> 00:49:13,593
I'm not in control
of my own destiny.

1093
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:14,953
That may be true.

1094
00:49:15,034 --> 00:49:16,793
But you're not
supposed to know that!

1095
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:20,234
You're meddling with
the primal forces of nature.

1096
00:49:20,313 --> 00:49:23,715
I mean, my God.
Am I on the list, too?

1097
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,513
- [laughing]
- I mean--

1098
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:31,994
Ah. Whew.

1099
00:49:32,075 --> 00:49:33,275
[chuckling]

1100
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:35,235
You got scared
there a little, didn't you?

1101
00:49:35,314 --> 00:49:37,354
- Oh, you were more scared.
- Yes.

1102
00:49:38,115 --> 00:49:39,835
Trixie?

1103
00:49:39,914 --> 00:49:41,554
What if I were meant
to be with these women,

1104
00:49:41,635 --> 00:49:42,874
no matter what?

1105
00:49:42,955 --> 00:49:45,314
What if you were meant
to bury the list,

1106
00:49:45,394 --> 00:49:47,435
and calm the heck down?

1107
00:49:47,515 --> 00:49:48,875
You know...

1108
00:49:48,954 --> 00:49:52,515
if we bury the list, guess what?

1109
00:49:52,595 --> 00:49:55,315
You were meant to bury the list.

1110
00:49:55,396 --> 00:49:56,634
Live your life.

1111
00:49:56,714 --> 00:49:59,835
Whatever happens, happens.

1112
00:50:00,995 --> 00:50:02,075
[grunting]

1113
00:50:02,154 --> 00:50:04,195
You know, it's a sheet
of paper, not a body.

1114
00:50:05,796 --> 00:50:07,395
- Sheet of paper, not a body!
- [groans]

1115
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:10,956
Yeah. It's time.

1116
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:14,516
- Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Breathe.

1117
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:15,636
Breathe, Roderick!

1118
00:50:15,715 --> 00:50:18,275
Yeah! Breathe!

1119
00:50:18,356 --> 00:50:20,396
Yes, I have deleted
all remnants of the list

1120
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,956
on my hard drive.

1121
00:50:22,035 --> 00:50:24,596
But remember, oh weak one, we are
putting a tulip to mark this spot.

1122
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:26,756
If you wuss out, we will dig it up.

1123
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:28,315
- Wait. One more name?
- Oh, Rod!

1124
00:50:28,396 --> 00:50:29,996
- Please?
- [snorts]

1125
00:50:31,116 --> 00:50:32,995
Couple of letters
I'm gonna give ya.

1126
00:50:33,955 --> 00:50:34,836
Dr. Mir--

1127
00:50:36,196 --> 00:50:37,915
Please, one more letter.

1128
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:40,076
What's that gonna make?
One letter-- no!

1129
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:44,036
Don't grab it!

1130
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:45,036
Mir-- Mir--

1131
00:50:45,117 --> 00:50:46,117
- One more letter!
- That's it!

1132
00:50:46,196 --> 00:50:47,876
We're ready!

1133
00:50:47,955 --> 00:50:50,076
[struggling, whooping]

1134
00:50:50,156 --> 00:50:52,076
I'm starting to take
a liking to Trixie.

1135
00:50:52,157 --> 00:50:53,716
I think she's
a very good influence.

1136
00:50:53,797 --> 00:50:55,476
It's not gonna happen, Beta.

1137
00:50:55,557 --> 00:50:58,196
You can't bury
something that precious.

1138
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:03,196
[sighs] Death Nell took
her tenth victim last night.

1139
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:04,477
- Hm?
- That double-digit rule.

1140
00:51:04,556 --> 00:51:06,997
When a serial killer
hits ten, we get called.

1141
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:09,157
We-- Like we don't have
enough on our plate?

1142
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:10,797
I thought she only did comas!

1143
00:51:10,877 --> 00:51:12,558
Not last night.

1144
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:13,837
But on the side of the bright,

1145
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:15,916
home base says the machine
has taken an interest.

1146
00:51:15,997 --> 00:51:18,597
No way he's really doing it!

1147
00:51:18,677 --> 00:51:20,436
-Ready?
- Quick. Before I change my mind.

1148
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:23,518
Way to go, Roderick.

1149
00:51:23,597 --> 00:51:25,236
Way to go.
[chuckles]

1150
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,077
[Zack]
Rod, you're missing this.

1151
00:51:30,157 --> 00:51:31,437
They crossed into our territory.

1152
00:51:31,518 --> 00:51:32,838
We could lose this.

1153
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:35,078
I know. Isn't it exciting?

1154
00:51:35,157 --> 00:51:36,998
[Zack]
If we blow it again in their red zone,

1155
00:51:37,078 --> 00:51:38,638
it's gonna leave a bad
taste in my mouth.

1156
00:51:38,718 --> 00:51:39,878
That's what your boyfriend
said last night.

1157
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:42,518
- Hey...
- Lester, what are you feeding your turtle?

1158
00:51:42,598 --> 00:51:44,717
Ugh. Anything that
will make him sick.

1159
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:46,237
I'm sorry, Skippy.

1160
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:48,558
But Daddy's gotta see
that veterinarian.

1161
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,158
What?
This is nothing!

1162
00:51:50,238 --> 00:51:51,958
I saw this freak in a parking lot

1163
00:51:52,037 --> 00:51:54,038
try to shove a bottle opener
in a Great Dane's ass,

1164
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:55,238
just to get an
emergency appointment.

1165
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:57,038
Are you talking about
the vet over on Vera Donna?

1166
00:51:57,158 --> 00:51:59,319
- Oh...
- Lizzie threatened to put Mr. Whiskers to sleep

1167
00:51:59,398 --> 00:52:00,598
if I went near that place again.

1168
00:52:00,678 --> 00:52:02,799
- She is so pretty.
- Mmm.

1169
00:52:02,878 --> 00:52:04,318
But not in like a, "I'm a model,

1170
00:52:04,399 --> 00:52:05,557
don't fucking look at me" way.

1171
00:52:05,638 --> 00:52:08,399
- And she's just so smart and funny.
- Yes.

1172
00:52:08,478 --> 00:52:10,558
And you know what I love about her?
My favorite thing.

1173
00:52:10,637 --> 00:52:11,839
- The way she cracks her neck.
- Mmm-mm-mm.

1174
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:14,359
- What about that silver anklet of hers?
- Ohh...

1175
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:16,078
You know, if you can't
make it to the clinic,

1176
00:52:16,158 --> 00:52:17,438
you should try the gym
on Wednesday,

1177
00:52:17,518 --> 00:52:19,159
or Trader Joe's on Thursday.

1178
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:20,760
- Well, I do like Trader Joe's.
- Yeah.

1179
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:22,158
It's all on the
Dr. Miranda Storm website.

1180
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,439
Yeah, it's a website.
I've been there.

1181
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:26,599
It's put together by one of these
real stalker geek types.

1182
00:52:26,678 --> 00:52:28,798
Oh, thank God
you're not one of those.

1183
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,760
Ladies, we've got
a football game going on here.

1184
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,719
Enough talking about
the X chromosome.

1185
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:35,799
Especially the almighty
Dr. Miranda--

1186
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:39,280
Dr. Mir--

1187
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:43,199
Is he smirking?

1188
00:52:43,278 --> 00:52:44,238
You're smirking.
Why is Rod smirking?

1189
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,720
[Roderick]
Interception!

1190
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:47,079
- [crowd roars]
- You see it?

1191
00:52:47,158 --> 00:52:48,600
[all yelling at once]

1192
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:49,999
I told you!
I told you!

1193
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,399
Yes! Oh, yes!

1194
00:52:52,479 --> 00:52:53,839
[laughing]

1195
00:52:53,919 --> 00:52:55,799
[sighing]

1196
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,520
Phew. Perfecto.

1197
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,039
I can still make Miranda's
4:20 Starbucks appearance.

1198
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,120
She orders a...

1199
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,599
[in unison]
Macchiato with extra foam.

1200
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,760
I could use some caffeine myself.
I'll come with.

1201
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:07,201
No, you're not getting anywhere
near her, Midas Dick.

1202
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,399
Fine. I'll go to Deitrich's, then.

1203
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,560
I got work to do, anyway.

1204
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:10,840
Please, Rod.

1205
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,681
Just this one time,
don't seduce this--

1206
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,000
- [squish]
- [all yelling]

1207
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,920
- Oh, diarrhea! Yes!
- [laughing]

1208
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,840
[cracking]

1209
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,721
[clears throat]

1210
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:57,520
You always carry
a bottle opener?

1211
00:53:57,521 --> 00:54:00,841
This little guy?
He's been through a lot.

1212
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,641
I quit my job today because
of this bottle opener.

1213
00:54:03,722 --> 00:54:06,442
Not-so-great day.
Long story.

1214
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:07,761
[sets down opener]

1215
00:54:09,482 --> 00:54:10,962
Why were you staring at me?

1216
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:13,242
Oh, don't worry, Doc.
I'm not one of your stalkers.

1217
00:54:13,322 --> 00:54:16,442
If I were, I'd be at Starbucks
about now, wouldn't I?

1218
00:54:16,522 --> 00:54:18,842
You've seen the website.

1219
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,362
No. I've--
I've heard about it.

1220
00:54:20,441 --> 00:54:21,801
I've heard about you.

1221
00:54:21,882 --> 00:54:24,522
Really. Well, you missed out.

1222
00:54:24,603 --> 00:54:25,921
It's quite good.

1223
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:29,403
It's got great graphics,
challenging quizzes.

1224
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:33,243
It's obviously caused me
to rearrange my rituals.

1225
00:54:33,322 --> 00:54:35,962
[deep breath]

1226
00:54:37,001 --> 00:54:38,802
You're not gonna use
your spoon, are you?

1227
00:54:39,882 --> 00:54:40,963
[mouths word]

1228
00:54:54,163 --> 00:54:54,241
[chuckles]

1229
00:54:54,242 --> 00:54:56,404
Okay. The bottle opener,
I'm gonna let slide.

1230
00:54:56,483 --> 00:54:59,163
But the spoon?
Start talking.

1231
00:54:59,243 --> 00:55:01,323
A place like this,
it gives you a knife,

1232
00:55:01,403 --> 00:55:03,643
a fork, a spoon,
wrapped in a napkin.

1233
00:55:03,722 --> 00:55:05,204
Now the knife,
the fork, the napkin,

1234
00:55:05,283 --> 00:55:06,643
they all get used.

1235
00:55:06,723 --> 00:55:09,284
Most cafe items,
they don't call for a spoon.

1236
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:11,884
But that little guy, he gets thrown
in the washing machine,

1237
00:55:11,963 --> 00:55:14,603
over and over,
time and time again.

1238
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:16,603
Without a sense of worth.

1239
00:55:17,842 --> 00:55:19,483
Not only compassionate
to furry creatures,

1240
00:55:19,564 --> 00:55:21,204
but inanimate objects as well.

1241
00:55:21,283 --> 00:55:24,683
There's gonna be some fun
in the chat room tonight.

1242
00:55:25,963 --> 00:55:28,203
You're doing it again.

1243
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:32,684
That funny, charming
staring thing.

1244
00:55:35,204 --> 00:55:36,483
It's not unpleasant.

1245
00:55:36,564 --> 00:55:38,084
[chuckles]

1246
00:55:38,163 --> 00:55:42,124
But you should know that I...recently got out

1247
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,284
of a very bad relationship, so I'm--

1248
00:55:44,364 --> 00:55:47,965
Yeah, I just got out of
a lot of bad relationships.

1249
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:49,564
I promise I won't
fall in love with you

1250
00:55:49,644 --> 00:55:52,284
as long as you promise you won't
fall in love with me.

1251
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:56,844
Oh, I promise.

1252
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:05,005
Favorite Vonnegut.
One, two, three.

1253
00:56:05,084 --> 00:56:06,365
[Both]
Cat's Cradle.

1254
00:56:06,444 --> 00:56:08,645
Favorite Dylan.
One, two, three.

1255
00:56:08,724 --> 00:56:10,845
[Both]
Nashville Skyline.

1256
00:56:12,645 --> 00:56:15,805
Funniest movie ever made.
One, two, three.

1257
00:56:15,884 --> 00:56:17,365
- Some Like It Hot.
- Caddyshack.

1258
00:56:17,445 --> 00:56:18,645
Oh. Guys in dresses.

1259
00:56:18,725 --> 00:56:21,125
That's really reinventing
the wheel there, Roderick.

1260
00:56:21,204 --> 00:56:23,005
A woman who likes
Caddyshack.

1261
00:56:23,086 --> 00:56:24,165
[Miranda]
Who wouldn't like Caddyshack?

1262
00:56:24,245 --> 00:56:26,125
[Roderick]
Favorite porno? One, two, three.

1263
00:56:26,204 --> 00:56:27,846
[laughing]

1264
00:56:28,005 --> 00:56:30,045
[Roderick narrating]
All those tingling thrill-of-the-pursuit

1265
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,605
feelings came flooding back.

1266
00:56:31,685 --> 00:56:33,925
So then came wish three.

1267
00:56:34,006 --> 00:56:35,685
I said I wanted
a pumpkin as a head.

1268
00:56:35,765 --> 00:56:37,846
[laughing]

1269
00:56:37,925 --> 00:56:40,087
Sure, I had the whole
"Dr. Mir" thing,

1270
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,846
from my peek at the list, to clue me
into where Miranda and I were heading.

1271
00:56:42,925 --> 00:56:45,166
But this would be
more than a romance.

1272
00:56:45,246 --> 00:56:48,085
More than a mere
checking-off of a name.

1273
00:56:49,045 --> 00:56:51,086
This would be love.

1274
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:52,846
Why rush the sex?

1275
00:56:52,925 --> 00:56:54,927
- Okay.
- All day, people wheel

1276
00:56:55,006 --> 00:56:56,686
and take back
the carts in the front.

1277
00:56:56,765 --> 00:56:58,447
And this poor bastard
in the middle

1278
00:56:58,566 --> 00:57:00,606
- probably hasn't been pushed in months.
- Tragic.

1279
00:57:00,687 --> 00:57:02,205
It's tr-- you know what?
It is. Help.

1280
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,526
You know, you say you've been looking
for an idea for a children's book.

1281
00:57:04,607 --> 00:57:06,566
How about all these
inanimate objects of yours?

1282
00:57:06,646 --> 00:57:09,206
The spoon that never gets used.

1283
00:57:09,286 --> 00:57:12,086
The missing sock that
reunites with his twin.

1284
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:15,166
The multi-CD player that
tragically gets turned off

1285
00:57:15,247 --> 00:57:17,206
seconds before proudly finishing

1286
00:57:17,286 --> 00:57:19,286
a five-disc shuffle.

1287
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:21,566
[chuckles]

1288
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:22,926
That's so it.

1289
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:24,407
Yes, it is.

1290
00:57:25,607 --> 00:57:26,567
Roderick...

1291
00:57:28,927 --> 00:57:31,247
I've been looking
for you all my life.

1292
00:57:38,286 --> 00:57:39,887
You're the best!

1293
00:57:39,966 --> 00:57:42,568
Come on. Get out.

1294
00:57:42,728 --> 00:57:45,567
[Roderick narrating]
Okay. The cheek thing had thrown me a bit.

1295
00:57:45,647 --> 00:57:47,729
But there's nothing
like a warm kiss

1296
00:57:47,808 --> 00:57:49,727
coming after a delicious
home-cooked meal.

1297
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:51,887
Compliments to the chef.

1298
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:55,847
- Hmm.
- [laughing]

1299
00:57:55,928 --> 00:57:58,566
- Yup. I was back in the kitchen.
- Yeah?

1300
00:57:58,647 --> 00:58:01,288
And the chef thinks
you're pretty great, too.

1301
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:05,008
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just-- just not--

1302
00:58:05,087 --> 00:58:06,687
- No, no, no, no. It's okay.
- I'm just feeling--

1303
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:07,848
Just relax. It's okay--

1304
00:58:07,928 --> 00:58:10,168
- No, Roderick.
- It's all right.

1305
00:58:10,247 --> 00:58:12,689
[sighs]

1306
00:58:12,768 --> 00:58:14,608
I adore you.

1307
00:58:14,687 --> 00:58:16,648
I do.

1308
00:58:16,728 --> 00:58:18,369
I'm just...

1309
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:19,728
screwed up about sex.

1310
00:58:19,808 --> 00:58:20,968
Ah, it's okay--

1311
00:58:21,048 --> 00:58:23,048
I mean, you're handsome.

1312
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:24,808
Devilishly so,
if you must know.

1313
00:58:24,888 --> 00:58:25,849
[both laughing]

1314
00:58:25,928 --> 00:58:30,208
It's just... you so remind me

1315
00:58:30,288 --> 00:58:31,889
of the guy my mom went out with,

1316
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:33,609
after the divorce, Rockin' Randy.

1317
00:58:33,688 --> 00:58:34,609
He ran the surf shop.

1318
00:58:34,688 --> 00:58:38,368
And he was a cross
between you and Bam-Bam

1319
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:40,488
from The Flintstones.

1320
00:58:40,568 --> 00:58:41,928
Listen, okay, look.

1321
00:58:42,009 --> 00:58:43,849
I'm not saying nothing's
ever gonna happen between us.

1322
00:58:43,929 --> 00:58:45,768
I'm not saying that. I'm just--

1323
00:58:47,849 --> 00:58:49,609
I'm just saying
if it's gonna happen...

1324
00:58:50,968 --> 00:58:52,170
it's just gonna happen.

1325
00:58:52,249 --> 00:58:54,129
- [whispers] Yeah.
- Right?

1326
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:55,528
Yeah.

1327
00:58:55,609 --> 00:58:57,009
Really, why worry about it?

1328
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:00,410
You're the best.

1329
00:59:01,689 --> 00:59:03,209
I'm gonna clean up.

1330
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,809
You can pick out another DVD.

1331
00:59:06,888 --> 00:59:08,290
Something funny.
[smooch]

1332
00:59:13,369 --> 00:59:16,929
[wind blowing]

1333
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,290
[Narrating]
I guess you could say

1334
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:20,930
that's when the madness set in.

1335
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:22,890
Thanks.

1336
00:59:22,969 --> 00:59:25,651
So Miranda and I went to
the Fellini retrospective yesterday.

1337
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:28,490
Oh, she said the coolest thing.

1338
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,971
- If Marcelo were alive--
- Have you fucked her yet?

1339
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,530
What is with that question?

1340
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,170
Have you fucked her yet?

1341
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,489
Have you fucked her yet?

1342
00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:39,530
Son...

1343
00:59:39,611 --> 00:59:40,851
have you fucked her yet?

1344
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,010
[Man]
Yo, Rod, have you fucked her--

1345
00:59:42,092 --> 00:59:43,250
- [beeps]
- [Man #2] Hey, have you--

1346
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:48,169
[answering machine
messages repeating]

1347
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:51,491
Let me tell you something.

1348
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:54,730
Miranda and I are building
a bond of trust and respect.

1349
00:59:54,811 --> 00:59:57,210
Excuse me for still believing
that love is something

1350
00:59:57,291 --> 01:00:00,331
more than a sloppy
fusion of genitalia.

1351
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,571
Miranda, we need
to discuss something.

1352
01:00:02,651 --> 01:00:05,450
- I--
- Oh, shit.

1353
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:07,371
- Shit, shit, shit.
- You okay?

1354
01:00:07,451 --> 01:00:08,971
Hide me.
No, just hide me.

1355
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:10,011
Sure.

1356
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,812
There's
a Frida Kahlo-looking dude.

1357
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:13,771
No, no, right--

1358
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:14,931
Oh, no, I got it.

1359
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:18,730
I met him at this Halloween
Poe poetry reading thing.

1360
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:20,371
I can't believe
I slept with him.

1361
01:00:20,452 --> 01:00:21,412
I was wasted.

1362
01:00:21,491 --> 01:00:23,611
Halloween, two weeks
ago Halloween?

1363
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:25,851
[Miranda] I told you,
I'm totally screwed up about sex.

1364
01:00:25,932 --> 01:00:28,292
Screwed up about sex?
Screwed up about sex?

1365
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:29,931
It's more like you're screwing.

1366
01:00:30,011 --> 01:00:31,372
That's funny.

1367
01:00:31,452 --> 01:00:32,692
Come on, let's go
somewhere else.

1368
01:00:34,171 --> 01:00:35,331
Bam-Bam.

1369
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:41,492
[Narrating]
Back in the day,

1370
01:00:41,572 --> 01:00:44,972
if a woman didn't have
sex with you it was okay,

1371
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:48,772
because it wasn't like she was having sex
with anyone else.

1372
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:51,291
Where is that whore-bitch
Jane Austen when you need her?

1373
01:00:51,372 --> 01:00:54,093
I chose to remember
the good times.

1374
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:55,292
The way Miranda
made you feel

1375
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:57,893
like you were the only
one in the world.

1376
01:00:57,972 --> 01:01:00,492
That time she read
my slaughterhouse reform bill.

1377
01:01:00,571 --> 01:01:03,693
[neck cracks]

1378
01:01:03,772 --> 01:01:06,892
It's wonderful, just wonderful.

1379
01:01:08,813 --> 01:01:11,132
[Roderick narrating] But then there was
that next day at lunch.

1380
01:01:11,212 --> 01:01:12,412
How was that salad for you?

1381
01:01:12,492 --> 01:01:13,373
Oh...

1382
01:01:13,452 --> 01:01:16,052
[neck cracks]

1383
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:18,813
Wonderful, just wonderful.

1384
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:29,013
And in conclusion, yeah,
go ahead, crucify me,

1385
01:01:29,093 --> 01:01:30,814
but I refuse to live in a society

1386
01:01:30,893 --> 01:01:33,453
that has reduced the world
to the question,

1387
01:01:33,534 --> 01:01:34,974
"Have you fucked her yet?"

1388
01:01:35,053 --> 01:01:37,372
[Both]
That would be a no.

1389
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:40,253
I don't even think
he's seen her naked.

1390
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:42,573
[all laughing]

1391
01:01:42,654 --> 01:01:44,254
[belches]

1392
01:01:46,973 --> 01:01:48,814
- Oh...
- [neck cracks]

1393
01:01:48,893 --> 01:01:52,133
Wonderful, just wonderful.

1394
01:01:52,214 --> 01:01:53,334
What the fuck?

1395
01:01:57,293 --> 01:02:01,494
I'm not saying nothing's
ever gonna happen between us.

1396
01:02:13,174 --> 01:02:14,734
Doctor...

1397
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,455
Mir-- hah!

1398
01:02:16,535 --> 01:02:17,973
That's what I'm talking about.

1399
01:02:18,054 --> 01:02:20,735
Yes, Dr. Mirabella Stone!

1400
01:02:20,814 --> 01:02:24,093
No! No!

1401
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:28,295
No!

1402
01:02:33,974 --> 01:02:35,975
[buzzer]

1403
01:02:36,055 --> 01:02:37,254
Don't mock me.

1404
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,735
Miranda told me
she was coming out

1405
01:02:38,814 --> 01:02:39,935
of a bad relationship.

1406
01:02:40,014 --> 01:02:42,775
And no one has ever had sex
coming out of a bad relationship.

1407
01:02:42,856 --> 01:02:45,535
Oh, we're moving way too fast,

1408
01:02:45,614 --> 01:02:48,415
I'm not feeling well.

1409
01:02:48,495 --> 01:02:49,935
If someone wants
to have sex with you,

1410
01:02:50,015 --> 01:02:51,455
they'll have sex with you.

1411
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:53,216
The rest is just dinner theater.

1412
01:02:53,295 --> 01:02:56,335
So that's it. The machine.

1413
01:02:56,416 --> 01:02:58,656
Oh, no, the machine is much--

1414
01:02:58,736 --> 01:03:01,656
Sure. The wall has a connection.

1415
01:03:01,735 --> 01:03:03,375
Thing's going to be
the death of me.

1416
01:03:03,456 --> 01:03:06,495
Oh, come on, cheer up,
droopy drawers.

1417
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,216
I mean, look on the side
of the bright.

1418
01:03:08,296 --> 01:03:11,896
Even if you went down
to a tropical island, all right?

1419
01:03:11,975 --> 01:03:14,696
The remaining 34 chicks
on this list

1420
01:03:14,777 --> 01:03:17,215
would be renting jet skis
to zoom down there

1421
01:03:17,296 --> 01:03:19,617
and party with you
whether you liked it or not.

1422
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:21,975
I don't like it.
I don't want other women.

1423
01:03:22,056 --> 01:03:23,136
I want Miranda!

1424
01:03:24,336 --> 01:03:25,696
I've been a good
sport with this thing.

1425
01:03:25,776 --> 01:03:27,136
There was a little weirdness
at the beginning,

1426
01:03:27,215 --> 01:03:29,136
but I went with the flow.

1427
01:03:29,217 --> 01:03:31,336
I sabotaged a wedding,
I lost deposits,

1428
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:32,816
I toyed with a lot
of people's feelings,

1429
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:36,456
including my own,
but I didn't care.

1430
01:03:36,535 --> 01:03:38,377
I care now.

1431
01:03:38,456 --> 01:03:40,817
I have found someone
that touches me

1432
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:42,176
down to my marrow.

1433
01:03:42,256 --> 01:03:44,817
And if you think that
some contraption is gonna--

1434
01:03:44,896 --> 01:03:45,897
You know, you know--

1435
01:03:45,977 --> 01:03:48,137
sometimes love is stronger than--

1436
01:03:48,217 --> 01:03:49,498
No, it's not!

1437
01:03:58,897 --> 01:04:01,017
I was so proud of you when you...

1438
01:04:01,098 --> 01:04:02,856
were burying the list in the backyard.

1439
01:04:02,937 --> 01:04:06,298
Horoscopes, psychics,
Tarot cards,

1440
01:04:06,378 --> 01:04:09,416
coming attractions that
give away the whole movie.

1441
01:04:09,498 --> 01:04:12,457
Why must you people
know everything?

1442
01:04:12,537 --> 01:04:14,097
That's a good point, Alpha, sir.

1443
01:04:14,177 --> 01:04:16,098
Remember when you said
the machine was a mystery?

1444
01:04:16,177 --> 01:04:18,578
That could mean that there's
some kind of kink or flaw,

1445
01:04:18,657 --> 01:04:19,657
something that
we don't know about--

1446
01:04:19,737 --> 01:04:21,458
Stop thinking about
the machine, Mr. Blank.

1447
01:04:21,538 --> 01:04:22,658
It's progress.

1448
01:04:22,737 --> 01:04:25,338
There's nothing
you can do about it.

1449
01:04:25,418 --> 01:04:28,578
Science and technology
don't care whether we live or die.

1450
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:30,017
- [high-pitched tone]
- [beep]

1451
01:04:30,098 --> 01:04:31,458
Excuse me.

1452
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:36,858
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1453
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:39,138
The solution's been right
in front of us the whole time!

1454
01:04:39,218 --> 01:04:40,578
What, what is it?

1455
01:04:40,658 --> 01:04:41,538
Blow jobs.

1456
01:04:41,618 --> 01:04:43,658
Blow jobs!
Oh, man, what a loophole.

1457
01:04:43,738 --> 01:04:46,378
All right, sex is work.

1458
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:48,378
Is she having a good time?
Am I meeting her needs?

1459
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:50,017
You got to think
about her feelings,

1460
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,859
but with a blow job,
you just lie back,

1461
01:04:52,939 --> 01:04:54,537
every now and then touch
the back of her head

1462
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:55,938
if you think she's getting tentative.

1463
01:04:56,019 --> 01:04:58,698
I mean, seriously, if someone
gives me an intercourse buffet,

1464
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,779
or just a blow job on a stick,

1465
01:05:00,858 --> 01:05:02,340
I'll take blow job
on a stick, dude.

1466
01:05:02,419 --> 01:05:04,817
No, you people--
you people are sick.

1467
01:05:04,899 --> 01:05:07,018
I've given my heart to Miranda.

1468
01:05:07,098 --> 01:05:08,459
I want to cradle her
in my arms,

1469
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:10,258
I want to make the kind of love
where you feel

1470
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,779
as though you're one
living, breathing...

1471
01:05:12,859 --> 01:05:14,140
You really think
she might go down on me?

1472
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:18,819
Death Nell has just put to sleep

1473
01:05:18,899 --> 01:05:21,099
an entire fraternity in Fresno.

1474
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:22,139
Eight members.

1475
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:23,779
Death Nell?

1476
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,379
What do you guys do
for a living again?

1477
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:26,699
It's the double-digit rule.

1478
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:29,099
When a serial killer hits ten victims,
we get called.

1479
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:31,660
No, I'm still getting details.

1480
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:33,419
Apparently...

1481
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,779
Well, apparently it was
the same frat house

1482
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:37,780
that was acquitted last year

1483
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,620
for manufacturing
the date rape drug.

1484
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,580
[all hooting]

1485
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:53,300
[Alpha]
D.N. put her own drug in the keg.

1486
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:56,979
Is that amusing to you, Roderick?

1487
01:05:57,061 --> 01:05:58,661
No, I'm just checking
my messages.

1488
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,260
The almighty machine's rep's
about to take another hit.

1489
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,700
[beeps]

1490
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,861
[Miranda] They love the concepts,
they love the drawings,

1491
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,659
they-- they're going
to publish the book!

1492
01:06:07,741 --> 01:06:10,902
Rod, I owe you so, so, much!

1493
01:06:10,981 --> 01:06:12,821
There's no way
we are not celebrating tonight.

1494
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,621
Okay? So I'm going
to be at your place,

1495
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,461
8:00 sharp, ready for action.

1496
01:06:18,421 --> 01:06:19,900
I so love you.

1497
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:24,501
You're a very lucky man to have
found such a soulmate, Mr. Blank,

1498
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:25,661
but unfortunately--

1499
01:06:25,741 --> 01:06:27,380
It's in her voice!

1500
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:29,061
You don't even need
the bizarro list.

1501
01:06:29,141 --> 01:06:30,981
She doesn't think of you in--

1502
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:33,020
[sighs]
Roderick...

1503
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:36,822
I'm certain that some
very interesting things

1504
01:06:36,901 --> 01:06:39,021
will occur this evening.

1505
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:41,461
Your penis going into her vagina
will not be one them.

1506
01:06:41,542 --> 01:06:43,381
[chuckles]

1507
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,981
But have a lovely evening.

1508
01:06:47,262 --> 01:06:48,781
Gentlemen, I'd love
to stay and chat,

1509
01:06:48,861 --> 01:06:52,101
but I got a date with a lady.

1510
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:04,981
I don't think he's even seen her naked.

1511
01:07:06,582 --> 01:07:07,982
[knocking at door]

1512
01:07:12,423 --> 01:07:13,383
Hey!

1513
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:14,542
Author!

1514
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:15,902
Author!

1515
01:07:15,982 --> 01:07:17,822
Thank you.
J.K. Rowling, eat shit.

1516
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:21,263
I'm so sorry I'm late,
it's just--

1517
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:22,823
It's been crazy.

1518
01:07:22,903 --> 01:07:24,462
But I told everyone that
we'd meet them at the bar.

1519
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:26,102
- It's my treat, for once.
- Everyone?

1520
01:07:26,182 --> 01:07:27,703
I thought tonight
was between you and--

1521
01:07:27,782 --> 01:07:29,662
I made pesto.

1522
01:07:31,823 --> 01:07:33,303
You did.

1523
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,063
That's so sweet,
but Rod, we gotta go out.

1524
01:07:36,142 --> 01:07:37,742
We're celebrating!

1525
01:07:37,823 --> 01:07:39,583
My brother and the two Jessicas,
they're already there,

1526
01:07:39,663 --> 01:07:41,103
but you know what,
it's no big deal.

1527
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,823
- Hey, hey, just relax.
- Listen, if you-- what?

1528
01:07:42,903 --> 01:07:44,263
Let's just hang for a bit,

1529
01:07:44,343 --> 01:07:46,983
you know, a little pre-party.

1530
01:07:47,062 --> 01:07:50,423
Dude, I thought
we were past this.

1531
01:07:52,503 --> 01:07:53,663
No?

1532
01:07:57,063 --> 01:07:59,583
Miranda, I know you once said
you weren't attracted to me,

1533
01:07:59,664 --> 01:08:02,063
but that was before
we went on the camping trip.

1534
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:05,024
That was before I loaded
the graphics program into your laptop.

1535
01:08:05,104 --> 01:08:07,783
- Before--
- Why is it that men think that women--

1536
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:13,304
women are like these giant
thermometers at those telethons,

1537
01:08:13,384 --> 01:08:14,984
where every time you do
something nice for them,

1538
01:08:15,064 --> 01:08:17,383
they get a little redder,
and a little redder,

1539
01:08:17,463 --> 01:08:19,063
and a little redder,
and a little redder,

1540
01:08:19,145 --> 01:08:20,785
and when you hit the top,
we have to fuck you?

1541
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:22,503
That is not funny!

1542
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:23,823
Shit!

1543
01:08:23,904 --> 01:08:24,824
Okay, I'm sorry.

1544
01:08:24,905 --> 01:08:26,904
All right, just slip on down here,

1545
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:28,744
just do a little clean-up.

1546
01:08:32,424 --> 01:08:35,225
Hey, what are the five
scariest words a woman can say?

1547
01:08:35,305 --> 01:08:37,584
- I wanna be--
- Just friends.

1548
01:08:43,104 --> 01:08:46,985
You know, it's like
some bad stand-up routine.

1549
01:08:47,065 --> 01:08:50,145
Just? Just.

1550
01:08:50,225 --> 01:08:52,903
Do you know how
important it was for me

1551
01:08:52,985 --> 01:08:54,824
to make one real friend
in this city?

1552
01:08:57,984 --> 01:09:00,505
I would die for you.

1553
01:09:00,584 --> 01:09:03,305
Who do you think
I'm dedicating my book to?

1554
01:09:03,385 --> 01:09:05,226
My insane parents?

1555
01:09:06,665 --> 01:09:11,786
"To Roderick Blank, my friend."

1556
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:14,585
[sighs]

1557
01:09:18,745 --> 01:09:20,905
Nice celebration.

1558
01:09:24,385 --> 01:09:25,745
- [gasps]
- [crashing]

1559
01:09:25,825 --> 01:09:27,066
[crunch]

1560
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:34,865
Oh, Miranda.

1561
01:09:35,065 --> 01:09:36,586
Man, that is one tough break.

1562
01:09:36,665 --> 01:09:38,626
Girlfriend finds out her little book's

1563
01:09:38,706 --> 01:09:41,026
getting published and then...

1564
01:09:41,106 --> 01:09:42,066
It's terrible.

1565
01:09:44,706 --> 01:09:47,506
Not my girlfriend.

1566
01:09:48,746 --> 01:09:50,386
For what it's worth, from our end,

1567
01:09:50,466 --> 01:09:52,426
we're satisfied the death
was just an accident.

1568
01:09:52,506 --> 01:09:54,066
[whispers]
Just--

1569
01:09:54,147 --> 01:09:55,065
Excuse me, officer,

1570
01:09:55,147 --> 01:09:57,667
I wanted to give
Mr. Blank the opportunity

1571
01:09:57,747 --> 01:10:00,505
- to say goodbye to his girlfriend.
- Not my--

1572
01:10:00,587 --> 01:10:01,947
Can I be alone with her?

1573
01:10:06,906 --> 01:10:09,067
Miranda.

1574
01:10:09,146 --> 01:10:11,547
Oh, precious Miranda.

1575
01:10:13,788 --> 01:10:16,306
You know, I never wanted this.

1576
01:10:16,387 --> 01:10:19,347
I-I only wanted--

1577
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:21,347
They said that we could never,

1578
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,268
never ever be together.

1579
01:10:25,507 --> 01:10:27,667
But hey,

1580
01:10:27,747 --> 01:10:29,747
we're gonna have the last laugh,

1581
01:10:29,827 --> 01:10:31,106
are we not, my love?

1582
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:44,947
[Narrating]
Okay, now that I think about it,

1583
01:10:45,028 --> 01:10:46,988
maybe this is where
the madness set in.

1584
01:10:47,067 --> 01:10:49,908
Yes, I know,
my beacon of light.

1585
01:10:49,988 --> 01:10:53,148
This is sad,
this is desperate,

1586
01:10:53,228 --> 01:10:55,749
this is disgusting,

1587
01:10:55,828 --> 01:10:58,548
but aren't all revolutions?

1588
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:02,149
We have to stand up to the list.

1589
01:11:02,228 --> 01:11:04,987
Stand up to the machine.

1590
01:11:05,069 --> 01:11:08,108
Stand up to fate.

1591
01:11:08,187 --> 01:11:10,269
Stand up, soldier.

1592
01:11:10,348 --> 01:11:12,189
Oh, come on, stand up.

1593
01:11:52,189 --> 01:11:55,270
Oh, let it out, Mr. Blank.

1594
01:11:55,349 --> 01:11:57,669
It's okay. Let it out.

1595
01:11:59,029 --> 01:12:01,790
You poor, sweet man.

1596
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:05,789
You poor, sweet, handsome man.

1597
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:18,310
Oh, shh...

1598
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:20,549
It's okay.

1599
01:12:38,831 --> 01:12:40,352
[Narrating]
Sorry.

1600
01:12:40,431 --> 01:12:43,671
Believe me, I'd hoped it was
a dream sequence, too.

1601
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:46,190
If it makes you feel any better,

1602
01:12:46,271 --> 01:12:49,432
my tale has a satisfying ending.

1603
01:12:49,511 --> 01:12:51,830
But this isn't it.

1604
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:54,471
It's only number 67.

1605
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:47,553
[Crowd]
Six, five, four,

1606
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:52,472
three, two, one,
Happy New Year!

1607
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:54,712
[champagne cork popping]

1608
01:14:02,032 --> 01:14:03,833
Nobody has said
"Happy New Year" to you.

1609
01:14:03,914 --> 01:14:05,793
Thank you. Roderick Blank.

1610
01:14:05,872 --> 01:14:07,754
Ester Fenchel.

1611
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,472
But your friends call you Terry.

1612
01:14:09,553 --> 01:14:11,352
[laughs]
No, but that's strange

1613
01:14:11,433 --> 01:14:14,633
because that's
my husband's name, Terry.

1614
01:14:14,712 --> 01:14:16,153
Nice tie.

1615
01:14:16,233 --> 01:14:19,114
- [champagne cork popping]
- [cheering]

1616
01:14:20,753 --> 01:14:22,913
Just leave the bottle.

1617
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:27,153
Gentlemen, I give you the Matador.

1618
01:14:30,033 --> 01:14:32,154
Oh! No!
Not the prototype!

1619
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:34,634
[Narrating]
Eating and starving,

1620
01:14:34,714 --> 01:14:36,993
and eating and starving.

1621
01:14:37,074 --> 01:14:39,914
I was told to take some time off,

1622
01:14:39,995 --> 01:14:42,475
to get away from it all for a while.

1623
01:14:42,554 --> 01:14:45,075
But there was no escape.

1624
01:14:45,154 --> 01:14:47,153
I had noticed a lot
of French, German,

1625
01:14:47,234 --> 01:14:48,954
and Italian names on the list,

1626
01:14:49,034 --> 01:14:51,234
so I dutifully booked
passage to Europe.

1627
01:14:51,314 --> 01:14:53,474
Hearing of all
the magnifique women,

1628
01:14:53,554 --> 01:14:54,834
my friends concluded
that I had had

1629
01:14:54,914 --> 01:14:58,154
the greatest vacation
of all time.

1630
01:14:58,235 --> 01:14:59,875
I'm glad they enjoyed it.

1631
01:15:17,314 --> 01:15:18,675
[clears throat]

1632
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:21,315
Good evening.

1633
01:15:21,395 --> 01:15:24,676
You have to fuck me,
so come over and fuck me.

1634
01:15:24,755 --> 01:15:27,074
No dinner.
Do you have a pen?

1635
01:15:27,154 --> 01:15:28,355
Let me give you directions.

1636
01:15:28,434 --> 01:15:29,635
[Woman]
Ew!

1637
01:15:31,195 --> 01:15:32,314
[beeps]

1638
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,155
[phone twittering]

1639
01:15:36,276 --> 01:15:37,236
Hello.

1640
01:15:37,316 --> 01:15:40,715
Oh, star 69.
Yes, it was a crank.

1641
01:15:40,796 --> 01:15:42,755
I'm sorry.

1642
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:44,475
Your mother picked up?
Fainted?

1643
01:15:44,555 --> 01:15:46,756
-Yes.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1644
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:48,556
[laughing]

1645
01:15:48,635 --> 01:15:50,235
Why are you laughing?

1646
01:15:50,315 --> 01:15:52,596
[Narrating]
In my own feeble way,

1647
01:15:52,677 --> 01:15:54,476
I had tried to defy the list.

1648
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:55,596
But once again,

1649
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,556
the list knew what it was doing,

1650
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,555
what I was doing.

1651
01:15:59,636 --> 01:16:00,916
But guess what.

1652
01:16:00,996 --> 01:16:02,076
I was about to meet a woman

1653
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:05,356
that was the answer
to all my problems.

1654
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,837
- Hope?
- Amber Anne.

1655
01:16:07,917 --> 01:16:09,396
Roderick?

1656
01:16:13,517 --> 01:16:17,357
I've been trying for years
to get a rise out of my mother.

1657
01:16:17,436 --> 01:16:19,837
You did it in five seconds.

1658
01:16:21,316 --> 01:16:23,077
Name your poison.

1659
01:16:23,156 --> 01:16:24,637
[Narrating]
Hope Hartlight was the author

1660
01:16:24,716 --> 01:16:26,716
of a best-selling self-help book.

1661
01:16:26,796 --> 01:16:29,837
I found her to be
warm, compassionate,

1662
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:31,477
and a little old.

1663
01:16:31,556 --> 01:16:33,757
So I wasn't attracted
to Hope Hartlight.

1664
01:16:33,837 --> 01:16:36,237
It's not like I was going to get out
of having sex with her.

1665
01:16:36,316 --> 01:16:39,357
So, to her surprise,
I asked her out again,

1666
01:16:39,438 --> 01:16:41,917
figuring we'd eventually
accidentally end up having sex,

1667
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:44,317
and I could move on.

1668
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:47,317
But a funny thing happened.

1669
01:16:47,397 --> 01:16:49,158
Hope listened.

1670
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:51,477
Hope guided.

1671
01:16:51,556 --> 01:16:54,918
Hope was literature
after ten months of pop-up books,

1672
01:16:54,997 --> 01:16:57,197
chess after ten months
of checkers.

1673
01:16:57,278 --> 01:16:59,237
You're a chapter 17.

1674
01:16:59,318 --> 01:17:00,797
May she spring eternal--

1675
01:17:00,876 --> 01:17:03,397
As for my friends,
what do you think?

1676
01:17:03,477 --> 01:17:05,358
Hope was an Earth-mother goddess,

1677
01:17:05,437 --> 01:17:07,518
put down here to save
the sinner's soul.

1678
01:17:07,597 --> 01:17:09,917
If you let her go,
I'll bring her back.

1679
01:17:09,999 --> 01:17:11,997
You know, you strike me
as the kind of guy

1680
01:17:12,078 --> 01:17:14,037
who would make fun
of a one-month

1681
01:17:14,118 --> 01:17:16,277
anniversary celebration.

1682
01:17:16,357 --> 01:17:18,798
You've changed me.

1683
01:17:18,878 --> 01:17:20,478
You've healed me.

1684
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,637
That's a really
beautiful thing to say.

1685
01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:29,359
Thank you.

1686
01:17:29,438 --> 01:17:31,717
You know, I've got
that book signing

1687
01:17:31,798 --> 01:17:33,797
next week in Vermont.

1688
01:17:33,879 --> 01:17:36,239
I'm thinking maybe
you should come with me.

1689
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,518
They've got a terrific
bed and breakfast up there.

1690
01:17:38,598 --> 01:17:39,519
Oh, my God.

1691
01:17:39,599 --> 01:17:40,919
We could just sleep late,

1692
01:17:40,999 --> 01:17:43,718
on the day I don't
have to work, of course.

1693
01:17:43,799 --> 01:17:45,919
But you could just
hang out all day.

1694
01:17:45,998 --> 01:17:47,798
You can walk around naked
in the backyard.

1695
01:17:47,878 --> 01:17:49,759
There's nobody there,
it's off-season.

1696
01:17:51,478 --> 01:17:52,879
[Narrating]
Hope Hartlight didn't really vanish

1697
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:55,160
into thin air like that.

1698
01:17:55,239 --> 01:17:56,639
It took a couple of weeks.

1699
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,278
How could being the answer
to all my problems

1700
01:17:58,359 --> 01:17:59,599
not be enough?

1701
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,679
If a friend of mine had
been going out with Hope,

1702
01:18:01,759 --> 01:18:03,319
I'd be so proud of him.

1703
01:18:03,398 --> 01:18:04,799
Guess that's the problem.

1704
01:18:04,879 --> 01:18:06,800
I'd be proud,
but I wouldn’t be jealous.

1705
01:18:06,879 --> 01:18:08,639
And a man would rather have
another man's jealousy

1706
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,600
than another man's respect.

1707
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:13,919
Man, hate to say
that one out loud.

1708
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:17,040
Okay.

1709
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:19,560
So, maybe Hope wasn't
the hottest piece of pie

1710
01:18:19,639 --> 01:18:20,999
you've ever been with,

1711
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,240
but Roderick,
I was so proud of you.

1712
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,400
Us married guys are taking a lot
of heat over this one, big guy.

1713
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,559
It seems that you broke some

1714
01:18:27,641 --> 01:18:30,000
"messing with the feelings
of a woman over 35" covenant.

1715
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:33,039
I thought we agreed we weren't
going to do an intervention.

1716
01:18:33,121 --> 01:18:35,600
No, we agreed we wouldn't use
the word "intervention."

1717
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,921
- Of course it's an intervention.
- Okay.

1718
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,479
Poor Rod, still under the illusion

1719
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,960
that out there walking around

1720
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,121
is the perfect girl, just for him.

1721
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:45,400
[Announcer]
News break! This just in.

1722
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,160
The woman known to
the world as Death Nell

1723
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,160
has apparently left
her driver's license

1724
01:18:49,241 --> 01:18:51,280
at the site of her latest attack.

1725
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,360
It is the break in the case

1726
01:18:52,441 --> 01:18:55,440
investigators have been hoping
and praying for all year.

1727
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,400
And now, Channel Nine gives you
an exclusive first look

1728
01:18:58,481 --> 01:19:01,040
at this dramatic license.

1729
01:19:01,121 --> 01:19:02,320
If you're just joining us,

1730
01:19:02,401 --> 01:19:04,441
Death Nell seduced and sedated

1731
01:19:04,521 --> 01:19:07,361
misogynist shock jock D.J. Harry Hunt

1732
01:19:07,441 --> 01:19:08,601
during a commercial break

1733
01:19:08,681 --> 01:19:09,961
on his morning drive-time program.

1734
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:12,280
I appreciate everyone's
concern here.

1735
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:14,801
I, um...

1736
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:15,761
Hello?

1737
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,241
Hey, Trixie, turn that up.

1738
01:19:17,321 --> 01:19:20,122
Did they really catch
that satanic succubus?

1739
01:19:20,201 --> 01:19:23,321
No, and the word's
"freedom fighter."

1740
01:19:23,401 --> 01:19:25,642
- Can we go in closer on that license--
- Let me guess.

1741
01:19:25,722 --> 01:19:27,961
I'm gonna bet that
her real name is not Death Nell!

1742
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:30,681
This is some intervention.

1743
01:19:30,762 --> 01:19:32,362
Gillian De Raisx.

1744
01:19:32,441 --> 01:19:35,923
That name again, folks,
Gillian De Raisx.

1745
01:19:36,002 --> 01:19:39,162
Death Nell is Gillian De Raisx.

1746
01:19:39,242 --> 01:19:42,802
[Narrating]
Gillian De Raisx. The X is silent.

1747
01:19:42,881 --> 01:19:44,761
It was a name that sounded familiar.

1748
01:19:44,842 --> 01:19:47,762
And when a name sounded
familiar, it usually meant...

1749
01:19:50,122 --> 01:19:53,682
Okay, this wasn't happening.

1750
01:19:53,762 --> 01:19:55,362
I know what you're thinking.

1751
01:19:55,443 --> 01:19:57,921
Surely I would have memorized
the last name on the list.

1752
01:19:58,002 --> 01:20:01,242
Not to put too fine
a point on it, but why?

1753
01:20:01,322 --> 01:20:03,722
No one wants to think about
the last name on the list,

1754
01:20:03,802 --> 01:20:06,923
because the last name
on the list means...

1755
01:20:08,443 --> 01:20:10,363
What did you say to him?
Where's he going?

1756
01:20:20,602 --> 01:20:22,963
[laughing]

1757
01:20:23,042 --> 01:20:23,963
Fred!

1758
01:20:24,043 --> 01:20:25,802
Oh, man, it's kind of funny.

1759
01:20:25,884 --> 01:20:27,924
It's not like she's the next one.

1760
01:20:28,003 --> 01:20:29,283
She may not be the next one,

1761
01:20:29,363 --> 01:20:30,562
but she sure as hell is the last one.

1762
01:20:30,643 --> 01:20:32,924
Hey, there's got to be
another woman on the planet

1763
01:20:33,004 --> 01:20:34,682
whose name is Gillian De aisx.

1764
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:36,723
With her last name
spelled with a silent X?

1765
01:20:36,804 --> 01:20:38,444
- I don't think so.
- Calm down.

1766
01:20:38,522 --> 01:20:42,604
Gillian de Raisx may not be
the Gillian de Raisx.

1767
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:44,963
As you can see,
the machine is closing in

1768
01:20:45,043 --> 01:20:46,844
on the one known as Death Nell.

1769
01:20:46,923 --> 01:20:48,764
The timelines have been
just a little off, but--

1770
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:49,803
Oh, great.

1771
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:57,644
More coordinates.

1772
01:20:57,724 --> 01:21:00,323
At this rate, I'd say
a couple of weeks from now

1773
01:21:00,404 --> 01:21:02,244
by the end of March,
the Oracle will tell us

1774
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:03,483
where Gillian de Raisx is staying

1775
01:21:03,565 --> 01:21:05,323
at the precise moment
she's staying there.

1776
01:21:05,403 --> 01:21:07,845
Now, I'm assuming,
Mr. Blank,

1777
01:21:07,924 --> 01:21:09,764
that you can hold off from
having sex with how many?

1778
01:21:09,843 --> 01:21:10,964
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

1779
01:21:11,044 --> 01:21:13,044
Twenty different women
in the next two weeks.

1780
01:21:13,124 --> 01:21:15,604
Hey, I've had sex with three women
in my entire life--

1781
01:21:15,683 --> 01:21:17,845
none if you don't count paying for it.

1782
01:21:17,924 --> 01:21:19,325
I could live off 20 women.

1783
01:21:19,404 --> 01:21:21,884
Now, we can tell you
not to have sex,

1784
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:24,725
but you have to go beyond that now.

1785
01:21:24,805 --> 01:21:28,525
You have to take your mind
to a whole other realm.

1786
01:21:28,604 --> 01:21:30,523
Read a book you've
always wanted to read.

1787
01:21:30,605 --> 01:21:32,645
I find model airplanes
can be an exacting

1788
01:21:32,724 --> 01:21:33,845
but ultimately rewarding--

1789
01:21:33,924 --> 01:21:34,925
Model airplanes are great,

1790
01:21:35,005 --> 01:21:36,284
but I got to go back
to the blow jobs.

1791
01:21:36,365 --> 01:21:39,085
Fred. Not constructive.

1792
01:21:39,165 --> 01:21:41,084
How do you feel about biking?

1793
01:21:41,164 --> 01:21:42,525
[chuckle]

1794
01:21:42,605 --> 01:21:44,645
I can't believe these are
the kind of conversations

1795
01:21:44,725 --> 01:21:46,765
I've become a part of.

1796
01:21:46,844 --> 01:21:48,165
He's still in torment.
Give him one.

1797
01:21:48,245 --> 01:21:49,445
One what?

1798
01:21:49,525 --> 01:21:51,245
Ah, yes, yes.

1799
01:21:51,325 --> 01:21:53,725
Our aforementioned Oracle,

1800
01:21:53,805 --> 01:21:57,565
while rather erratic
in capturing criminals,

1801
01:21:57,645 --> 01:22:00,046
has come up with the answers

1802
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:03,205
to some of our culture's
most significant mysteries.

1803
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:05,366
And I think we can
give you one of them.

1804
01:22:05,446 --> 01:22:07,005
Any of the biggies?

1805
01:22:07,086 --> 01:22:10,445
Okay, uh, who killed
Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman?

1806
01:22:10,527 --> 01:22:11,926
- You're kidding.
- Yeah, I'm kidding.

1807
01:22:12,005 --> 01:22:13,085
Let me see.
Let me see.

1808
01:22:13,165 --> 01:22:14,925
How about who really shot JFK?

1809
01:22:15,005 --> 01:22:15,846
Oh, pick another one.

1810
01:22:16,566 --> 01:22:17,646
It takes, like, 20 minutes to print out.

1811
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:18,686
Okay, life on other planets.

1812
01:22:18,765 --> 01:22:20,046
How many planets
in the universe have--

1813
01:22:20,126 --> 01:22:22,287
- [Alpha] Eleven.
- Eleven? That's it?

1814
01:22:22,365 --> 01:22:24,326
That's it. How many
more do you want?

1815
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:26,206
Wait a sec.
Does God exist?

1816
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:27,966
Cut it out. You only get one.

1817
01:22:28,046 --> 01:22:30,086
Please.
You guys are mean.

1818
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:32,086
You don't want to be in L.A.
on July 4th weekend.

1819
01:22:32,167 --> 01:22:34,766
Beta, enough.
[claps hands]

1820
01:22:39,806 --> 01:22:42,447
There are 20 human shields
between you and Miss de Raisx.

1821
01:22:42,527 --> 01:22:44,526
Be conservative.

1822
01:22:44,606 --> 01:22:48,167
Don't use up any of them
until we catch the villainess.

1823
01:22:49,887 --> 01:22:51,006
And remember...

1824
01:22:52,807 --> 01:22:55,087
a new realm of existence.

1825
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:57,647
A new realm of existence.

1826
01:22:57,727 --> 01:23:00,687
No sex...

1827
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:01,847
no death.

1828
01:23:02,807 --> 01:23:04,446
Good luck.

going on back here.

01:26:49,733 --> 01:26:51,013
I'm not going to rape you.

1910
01:26:51,094 --> 01:26:52,893
- You know that.
- Just leave me alone.

1911
01:26:52,972 --> 01:26:55,013
Get up, you big baby.

1912
01:26:55,934 --> 01:26:57,653
Got one word for you:
Qantas.

1913
01:26:57,732 --> 01:26:59,214
You are going to Australia.

1914
01:26:59,293 --> 01:27:01,613
Your flight leaves in the morning,
so start packing.

1915
01:27:01,694 --> 01:27:03,932
You don't get it. I can't escape.

1916
01:27:04,014 --> 01:27:06,533
She'll rent a jet ski,
and she'll track me down.

1917
01:27:06,614 --> 01:27:08,173
I was on the Net all night.

1918
01:27:08,253 --> 01:27:09,653
I found another Gillian de Raisx.

1919
01:27:09,733 --> 01:27:11,494
Oh, yeah, that spells
her last name with a--

1920
01:27:11,573 --> 01:27:13,253
Yes, with a silent X.

1921
01:27:14,294 --> 01:27:16,974
She's a marine biologist
based outside of Sydney.

1922
01:27:20,854 --> 01:27:21,894
Oh, this picture.

1923
01:27:21,974 --> 01:27:23,694
Which one's the walrus?

1924
01:27:24,773 --> 01:27:26,014
She's big-boned

1925
01:27:26,094 --> 01:27:28,255
with a healthy appetite
for life, asshole.

1926
01:27:28,414 --> 01:27:30,294
What is-- What is that
on her face?

1927
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:31,493
It's a rash

1928
01:27:31,494 --> 01:27:33,934
from her exploration
of the Barrier Reef.

1929
01:27:34,014 --> 01:27:35,614
- Ooh.
- Oh, God!

1930
01:27:35,694 --> 01:27:37,254
Roderick,

1931
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,614
you'd rather die than have sex

1932
01:27:38,695 --> 01:27:41,695
with an overweight woman
with a slight skin condition?

1933
01:27:41,774 --> 01:27:43,055
But it's--

1934
01:27:43,134 --> 01:27:44,374
it's not that slight.

1935
01:27:44,454 --> 01:27:47,654
Trixie, I'm sure she's a great--

1936
01:27:47,734 --> 01:27:49,574
I got you some books
to read on the plane.

1937
01:27:49,654 --> 01:27:52,375
I have underlined some
very good conversation starters.

1938
01:27:52,454 --> 01:27:54,255
So help me, if you
do not go Down Under

1939
01:27:54,336 --> 01:27:55,614
and seduce this Sheila--

1940
01:27:55,694 --> 01:27:57,895
Well, I do like dolphins.

1941
01:27:57,975 --> 01:27:59,215
Trixie.

1942
01:28:01,215 --> 01:28:03,455
No matter what happens,

1943
01:28:03,535 --> 01:28:04,896
thank you for being there.

1944
01:28:04,974 --> 01:28:06,574
You're a true pal.

1945
01:28:08,855 --> 01:28:10,854
It's good to be a lesbian, isn't it?

1946
01:28:10,935 --> 01:28:12,976
Send me a postcard, jerk.

1947
01:28:14,576 --> 01:28:16,175
With a koala on it.

01:28:56,935 --> 01:28:58,976

1959
01:29:00,417 --> 01:29:02,096

1960

[beep]

1961
01:29:04,656 --> 01:29:06,016
Please don't pork me.

1962
01:29:06,097 --> 01:29:08,896
[Fred, laughing]
Hey, if you insist, hot rod.

1963
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:12,696
Listen, the Almighty Oracle
has come through.

1964
01:29:12,776 --> 01:29:14,577
We have confirmation

1965
01:29:14,656 --> 01:29:16,977
that Death Nell
is going to be down here

1966
01:29:17,058 --> 01:29:18,856
at the Mayfair Hotel.

1967
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,096
[sigh]

1968
01:29:20,177 --> 01:29:21,176
I've entered her room.

1969
01:29:21,257 --> 01:29:23,376
Mr. A's not here
at this precise moment,

1970
01:29:23,457 --> 01:29:25,377
but her things
most certainly are.

1971
01:29:25,457 --> 01:29:28,097
Friends, I've got chills.

1972
01:29:29,337 --> 01:29:31,617
Fred, Beta, you guys--

1973
01:29:31,697 --> 01:29:33,457
Wait. It's April Fool's Day,
isn't it?

1974
01:29:33,537 --> 01:29:34,577
[Alpha]
It's 10 after midnight,

1975
01:29:34,657 --> 01:29:37,018
- officially April 2.
- Ha.

1976
01:29:37,097 --> 01:29:38,338
Yes, Roderick.

1977
01:29:38,417 --> 01:29:40,457
We have quite
a welcoming party

1978
01:29:40,537 --> 01:29:41,897
planned for the nasty minx.

1979
01:29:41,978 --> 01:29:43,458
Oh.

1980
01:29:43,538 --> 01:29:46,617
Oh, this is--
this is amazing.

1981
01:29:46,698 --> 01:29:50,338
You don't know
what it's been like.

1982
01:29:50,417 --> 01:29:52,658
And I have found the loophole

1983
01:29:52,737 --> 01:29:53,818
of all loopholes.

1984
01:29:53,898 --> 01:29:55,138
It's not blow jobs,

1985
01:29:55,217 --> 01:29:56,538
and it's not hand jobs.

1986
01:29:56,617 --> 01:29:57,898
It's exes.

1987
01:29:57,978 --> 01:30:00,697
It's ex,
as in ex-girlfriends, all right?

1988
01:30:00,778 --> 01:30:02,097
I want-- just-- listen.

1989
01:30:02,179 --> 01:30:03,939
Check the names on the list.

1990
01:30:04,018 --> 01:30:05,897
Do any names appear twice?

1991
01:30:05,979 --> 01:30:07,818
Any doubles? All right, no.

1992
01:30:07,898 --> 01:30:09,618
- Then don't tell me...
- [crash]

1993
01:30:09,698 --> 01:30:12,099
that you've never hooked up
with some ex-girlfriend

1994
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:14,739
for a little, uh, you know,
"remember when" sex.

1995
01:30:14,818 --> 01:30:17,339
No, you're right.
I had sex with Laura Baxter

1996
01:30:17,418 --> 01:30:19,419
every time I came
home for Christmas.

1997
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:20,938
And she's only listed once.

1998
01:30:21,018 --> 01:30:22,779
And whenever I travel
through St. Louis,

1999
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:24,819
I always stop in on Diana Scott.

2000
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:27,178
We're going to get you
some reelection sex, all right?

2001
01:30:27,259 --> 01:30:29,619
I'm talking about
Grover Cleveland poontang.

2002
01:30:29,699 --> 01:30:31,818
Go back to Hope, number 80.

2003
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:33,819
What you had was real.
She'll take you back.

2004
01:30:33,899 --> 01:30:35,658
Yes. There's Hope.

2005
01:30:35,739 --> 01:30:38,019
I've had so many wonderful,
fascinating women in my life.

2006
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,020
I've never really been
worthy of any of them.

2007
01:30:40,099 --> 01:30:41,939
Uhh! Don't listen to Beta.

2008
01:30:42,018 --> 01:30:43,219
Do not listen to him.

2009
01:30:43,299 --> 01:30:45,380
He hates boners
and fun, all right?

2010
01:30:45,459 --> 01:30:48,419
What you have to do is you got
to find that school bus,

2011
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,899
and you got to hook up
with those little Bible brats

2012
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:53,020
numbers 81 through 99,

2013
01:30:53,099 --> 01:30:55,941
and maybe give 84 a pass
with the back zits.

2014
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,860
- And you just get-- get--
- Sir?

2015
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:02,179
Yes. It's right there.

2016
01:31:02,259 --> 01:31:05,419
Get one of them to change
her name to Gillian de Raisx.

2017
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,581
And you perfect--

2018
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:08,220
[Alpha]
Stop it.

2019
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:11,939
[sighs] The theories
on the table are adorable.

2020
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:13,900
But Roderick, be cool.

2021
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,980
Gillian will be
at the hotel any minute,

2022
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:17,700
and our organization--

2023
01:31:17,779 --> 01:31:21,340
well, we don't believe
in trials and arrests.

2024
01:31:21,421 --> 01:31:22,820
So I want you
to hang tight,

2025
01:31:22,899 --> 01:31:24,660
and do not, I repeat,

2026
01:31:24,741 --> 01:31:26,980
do not leave your house.

2027
01:31:27,061 --> 01:31:28,300
Okay.

2028
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:29,420
Call you when she's dead.

2029
01:31:29,501 --> 01:31:31,740
All right. I'll be here.

2030
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:33,500
Thank you. Good-bye.

2031
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:34,941
[beep]

2032
01:31:35,021 --> 01:31:36,341
Ohh...
[sighs]

2033
01:31:43,941 --> 01:31:45,740
[sighs]

2034
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:51,142
[Narrating] Did you really think
I was gonna get off easy?

2035
01:32:51,222 --> 01:32:53,743
Did you want me to?

2036
01:32:53,823 --> 01:32:55,783
I know I promised you
a satisfying ending,

2037
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:57,062
but there will be
no triumphant return

2038
01:32:57,143 --> 01:32:59,703
to Fiona, Hope,
or anybody else.

2039
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:02,223
There will be no chasing a cab,

2040
01:33:02,302 --> 01:33:03,583
no stopping a wedding,

2041
01:33:03,662 --> 01:33:07,423
no tearful reconciliations
on a train platform,

2042
01:33:07,502 --> 01:33:11,543
and no morning flights
to Australia.

2043
01:33:11,622 --> 01:33:15,544
To escape the sins of
my April 2nd to April 2nd saga

2044
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:18,823
would feel so, so wrong.

2045
01:33:18,903 --> 01:33:20,423
Yes, my true destiny

2046
01:33:20,503 --> 01:33:23,583
was staying in a hotel downtown.

2047
01:33:23,663 --> 01:33:27,344
I was going out with
a lady called Death.

2048
01:33:27,423 --> 01:33:29,703
No God or Machine
could help me now.

2049
01:33:31,504 --> 01:33:33,224
And that felt so,

2050
01:33:33,303 --> 01:33:34,424
so right.

2051
01:33:41,064 --> 01:33:45,264
You live by the sword,
you die by the sword.

2052
01:33:45,343 --> 01:33:48,143
One sexual position left.

2053
01:33:48,223 --> 01:33:50,064
Call it the karma sutra.

2054
01:33:52,344 --> 01:33:54,144
The end is coming.

2055
01:33:54,224 --> 01:33:56,544
And coming is the end.

2056
01:33:56,704 --> 01:33:58,344
We've checked all
the sectors, Fred.

2057
01:33:58,424 --> 01:33:59,424
Okay, you know what?

2058
01:33:59,503 --> 01:34:02,185
My name is not Fred.
It's Commander Delta.

2059
01:34:02,265 --> 01:34:04,263
- It-- just go. In.
- Move.

2060
01:34:09,784 --> 01:34:10,825
Excuse me.

2061
01:34:10,905 --> 01:34:12,945
Miss Death? Nell?

2062
01:34:13,024 --> 01:34:15,345
Or do you prefer Gillian?

2063
01:34:15,425 --> 01:34:17,105
I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

2064
01:34:17,184 --> 01:34:19,505
[women laughing]

2065
01:34:19,585 --> 01:34:21,664
Death Nell's alive
and inside us.

2066
01:34:21,744 --> 01:34:22,905
[mocking laughter]

2067
01:34:22,985 --> 01:34:24,385
Look at him!
He's so scared!

2068
01:34:24,464 --> 01:34:27,345
Aww!
[hooting, mocking]

2069
01:34:30,025 --> 01:34:32,785
Oh, where you going?
Come back, ladies' man!

2070
01:34:32,865 --> 01:34:35,745
[hooting, mocking]

2071
01:34:43,305 --> 01:34:45,626
[panting]

2072
01:34:45,705 --> 01:34:47,185
Whew...

2073
01:34:47,266 --> 01:34:50,344
[Gillian] Well, you caused
quite a commotion out there.

2074
01:34:50,426 --> 01:34:52,545
Is there something
you wanted to tell me?

2075
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:54,585
Tell you? No. I, uh--

2076
01:34:58,186 --> 01:34:59,227
Oh.

2077
01:35:00,426 --> 01:35:01,665
Hi.

2078
01:35:03,307 --> 01:35:04,426
Agents.

2079
01:35:04,506 --> 01:35:07,706
There's agents staked out
at your hotel.

2080
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:10,187
In your room.

2081
01:35:10,266 --> 01:35:11,386
Thanks.

2082
01:35:13,586 --> 01:35:15,147
You know I'm not innocent, right?

2083
01:35:15,227 --> 01:35:16,866
Yeah.

2084
01:35:20,226 --> 01:35:22,466
Can I-- Can I join...

2085
01:35:37,066 --> 01:35:38,187
[menus slam]

2086
01:35:44,067 --> 01:35:45,147
Wow.

2087
01:35:46,147 --> 01:35:48,427
This, uh, place is amazing.

2088
01:35:48,507 --> 01:35:49,708
You know, I'm kind of
in the business.

2089
01:35:49,787 --> 01:35:51,547
I've never heard of it.

2090
01:35:51,628 --> 01:35:54,147
Yeah, I just discovered it
the other night.

2091
01:35:54,228 --> 01:35:57,109
There are not a lot of places
in this town that stay open late.

2092
01:35:57,188 --> 01:35:59,148
Yeah.

2093
01:35:59,227 --> 01:36:01,587
- Do-- You know, I--
- I-- Well--

2094
01:36:01,668 --> 01:36:02,667
[clears throat]
Sorry.

2095
01:36:02,746 --> 01:36:04,987
- You go.
- No, you go.

2096
01:36:05,068 --> 01:36:08,827
You know, this is--
this is strange for me.

2097
01:36:08,908 --> 01:36:10,708
I've never had
a volunteer before.

2098
01:36:11,988 --> 01:36:13,908
Some guys will do
anything to get laid.

2099
01:36:13,987 --> 01:36:15,907
[laughing]

2100
01:36:17,948 --> 01:36:19,108
Uh-oh.

2101
01:36:26,468 --> 01:36:27,749
This has a...

2102
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:29,907
a grape aftertaste.

2103
01:36:30,949 --> 01:36:32,788
And you do realize that

2104
01:36:32,869 --> 01:36:35,789
I can't guarantee when or--

2105
01:36:35,868 --> 01:36:38,548
or even if you'll wake up.

2106
01:36:38,629 --> 01:36:40,949
Yeah. No, I understand.

2107
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:42,029
[silverware clatters]

2108
01:36:46,308 --> 01:36:48,149
[sighs]

2109
01:36:48,229 --> 01:36:49,309
You mind if I ask you--

2110
01:36:49,388 --> 01:36:51,028
you tell me
if this is too personal,

2111
01:36:51,109 --> 01:36:55,429
but, uh...
how did you get here?

2112
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:58,630
You know, in the larger sense?

2113
01:36:58,709 --> 01:37:00,228
It's not like I'm gonna
be telling anyone

2114
01:37:00,309 --> 01:37:02,389
for an indefinitely
long period of time.

2115
01:37:02,469 --> 01:37:04,349
[chuckles]

2116
01:37:06,149 --> 01:37:07,389
I don't know.

2117
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:09,429
I don't--

2118
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:11,429
I'm not gonna talk
about my childhood.

2119
01:37:11,509 --> 01:37:14,550
You know?
'Cause that's not what--

2120
01:37:14,629 --> 01:37:17,990
My childhood wasn't any better
or worse than anyone else--

2121
01:37:18,069 --> 01:37:20,390
Oh, well, okay.
It was a little worse.

2122
01:37:20,469 --> 01:37:22,869
But, uh-- but I escaped.

2123
01:37:24,389 --> 01:37:27,389
That's where I studied
poetry and chemistry.

2124
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:30,231
Obviously better
at the latter than the former.

2125
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:31,550
No, I wouldn't say that.

2126
01:37:31,629 --> 01:37:33,190
I really enjoy your writing.

2127
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:35,870
[stammers softly]

2128
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:41,429
You're right,
these spices do look amazing.

2129
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:43,550
I mean, I've only read the stuff
that gets printed in the paper,

2130
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:44,870
after each incident.

2131
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:48,150
But what was it you spray-painted
after Number Seven?

2132
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:50,110
"My ecstasy, your annihilation."

2133
01:37:50,191 --> 01:37:53,950
[Both]
"Our mess, nothing left to transgress."

2134
01:37:54,031 --> 01:37:55,871
- That's good.
- [sighs]

2135
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:58,790
But where was I?
Oh! Yes, of course.

2136
01:37:58,871 --> 01:38:04,071
Before I could graduate,
I was swept off my feet.

2137
01:38:04,150 --> 01:38:06,311
My husband was this, uh--

2138
01:38:06,391 --> 01:38:07,951
[deep breath]

2139
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:09,991
everything a girl's
supposed to want, right?

2140
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:13,111
You know. I was his--
his princess.

2141
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:16,592
He was my Prince Charming.

2142
01:38:17,551 --> 01:38:19,551
Can I try some of your kale?

2143
01:38:19,631 --> 01:38:23,431
- Trade you for that cherry tomato.
- All right.

2144
01:38:30,191 --> 01:38:33,271
You don't have to go on
if you don't want to.

2145
01:38:33,351 --> 01:38:34,911
No...

2146
01:38:34,991 --> 01:38:38,951
It actually feels good
to say the bad out loud.

2147
01:38:40,592 --> 01:38:44,432
But when I said
I was his princess,

2148
01:38:44,511 --> 01:38:46,952
I wasn't being metaphorical.

2149
01:38:48,312 --> 01:38:49,271
[Death Nell]
Every week,

2150
01:38:49,351 --> 01:38:51,991
a new princess costume
and a new wig.

2151
01:38:52,072 --> 01:38:53,392
"This way, I won't cheat,"

2152
01:38:53,473 --> 01:38:55,871
was the charming way he put it.

2153
01:38:55,953 --> 01:38:58,553
At first, it was...fun?

2154
01:38:58,632 --> 01:39:00,631
But then it wasn't.

2155
01:39:00,713 --> 01:39:02,152
It got rough, and I--

2156
01:39:02,232 --> 01:39:05,072
[police sirens]

2157
01:39:08,592 --> 01:39:09,912
[sirens retreat]

2158
01:39:16,392 --> 01:39:17,953
Did he hit you?

2159
01:39:18,033 --> 01:39:19,673
Aw...

2160
01:39:19,753 --> 01:39:22,833
You know, I've put
over 20 men into a coma.

2161
01:39:22,912 --> 01:39:25,792
When you're handing out
that kind of punishment--

2162
01:39:25,872 --> 01:39:27,833
[clears throat]
The short answer is yes.

2163
01:39:27,912 --> 01:39:29,873
Yeah, he hit me.

2164
01:39:29,953 --> 01:39:31,713
And pretty much
every other verb

2165
01:39:31,793 --> 01:39:33,552
you could come up with.

2166
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,433
But nothing above the neck.

2167
01:39:35,513 --> 01:39:37,474
The Princess and the Pirate.

2168
01:39:37,553 --> 01:39:39,633
The Princess and the Viking.

2169
01:39:39,713 --> 01:39:42,994
The Princess and
the Mongol Warlord.

2170
01:39:43,073 --> 01:39:44,473
Occasionally, he'd mix it up

2171
01:39:44,554 --> 01:39:47,033
and we'd do
The Sound of Music,

2172
01:39:47,113 --> 01:39:49,913
as if the Nazis won.

2173
01:39:49,993 --> 01:39:51,433
You know,
it couldn't be a crime.

2174
01:39:51,512 --> 01:39:52,793
He was my husband.

2175
01:39:52,872 --> 01:39:56,353
I did not complain.
I did not ask questions.

2176
01:39:56,433 --> 01:39:59,233
Although, why anyone
would want to treat

2177
01:39:59,314 --> 01:40:01,355
Julie Andrews
as a human ashtray...

2178
01:40:01,433 --> 01:40:04,433
As far as questions go,
that's a pretty good one.

2179
01:40:04,515 --> 01:40:05,754
[laughs]

2180
01:40:05,834 --> 01:40:07,833
It did improve my poetry, though.

2181
01:40:07,914 --> 01:40:10,554
It gave me a lot of good
material to work with.

2182
01:40:10,635 --> 01:40:12,914
God, you're a good listener, man.

2183
01:40:12,994 --> 01:40:14,794
You really are.

2184
01:40:15,754 --> 01:40:17,194
Oh, God-- oh.

2185
01:40:17,274 --> 01:40:19,954
Then came Valentine's Day.

2186
01:40:20,034 --> 01:40:23,154
Oh, that was on a good one.

2187
01:40:23,234 --> 01:40:26,515
My hopeless situation,
my inability to change.

2188
01:40:26,595 --> 01:40:29,995
But all in iambic
pentameter, of course.

2189
01:40:32,674 --> 01:40:35,435
- And then...
- [groans]

2190
01:40:35,714 --> 01:40:37,716
F--

2191
01:40:40,915 --> 01:40:42,755
[thud, clatter, crack]

2192
01:40:52,075 --> 01:40:52,955
[thud]

2193
01:40:53,035 --> 01:40:55,075
I should have
been happy, right?

2194
01:40:55,155 --> 01:40:58,276
They tried everything.
They couldn't wake me up.

2195
01:40:58,356 --> 01:41:00,556
They thought
I was in a coma.

2196
01:41:00,635 --> 01:41:02,596
And that's when
I had the vision.

2197
01:41:02,676 --> 01:41:05,556
[birds chirping]

2198
01:41:31,755 --> 01:41:34,397
I had become my own
Prince Charming.

2199
01:41:34,477 --> 01:41:37,637
But there was much work
to be done in my kingdom.

2200
01:41:37,716 --> 01:41:39,677
Battles to be fought,

2201
01:41:39,756 --> 01:41:41,916
wars to be won.

2202
01:41:44,037 --> 01:41:46,996
You can pretty much
connect the dots from there.

2203
01:41:47,077 --> 01:41:50,237
Costumes, chemistry, poetry,

2204
01:41:50,317 --> 01:41:52,676
mutually degrading sexuality,

2205
01:41:52,757 --> 01:41:55,318
comas, "men suck."

2206
01:41:55,397 --> 01:41:57,836
I don't know how much longer
I can keep running around like this.

2207
01:41:57,917 --> 01:41:59,237
It's not like I can't afford it.

2208
01:41:59,317 --> 01:42:02,117
I mean, my husband
was Victor Rose IV.

2209
01:42:02,197 --> 01:42:04,237
Victor R-- wow.

2210
01:42:04,317 --> 01:42:05,478
Small world.

2211
01:42:05,557 --> 01:42:07,917
I kind of had a one-night stand
with his grandma.

2212
01:42:07,997 --> 01:42:09,838
Granny C?

2213
01:42:09,917 --> 01:42:11,877
My story's not
as compelling as yours,

2214
01:42:11,956 --> 01:42:13,477
but, uh, exactly a year ago,

2215
01:42:13,557 --> 01:42:15,998
I received a list of everyone
I'd ever had sex with

2216
01:42:16,077 --> 01:42:17,836
and ever would have sex with.

2217
01:42:17,917 --> 01:42:20,597
[stuttering]
I find that very compelling.

2218
01:42:20,678 --> 01:42:23,398
I-- I think we should
order dessert.

2219
01:42:23,477 --> 01:42:25,837
Raspberry tart?
Two forks?

2220
01:42:27,197 --> 01:42:29,598
You think I'm lying?

2221
01:42:29,677 --> 01:42:30,998
- You think I'm insane.
- No!

2222
01:42:31,078 --> 01:42:32,718
No. I--

2223
01:42:32,797 --> 01:42:34,877
And believe me,
I am an expert on both.

2224
01:42:35,758 --> 01:42:39,518
But Bambi and Thumper.
Seriously.

2225
01:42:39,598 --> 01:42:41,559
The Beyond-Ultimate
Lesbian Power Couple.

2226
01:42:41,638 --> 01:42:43,878
- [laughing]
- Yes. What a night.

2227
01:42:45,758 --> 01:42:48,398
Ohhh, fuck.

2228
01:42:49,798 --> 01:42:51,159
[whispers]
Fuck.

2229
01:42:55,038 --> 01:42:56,759
You know, uh--

2230
01:42:56,839 --> 01:42:58,558
I'd like to think that I--

2231
01:42:58,638 --> 01:43:00,318
I put something
interesting out there

2232
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:02,119
into the atmosphere.

2233
01:43:02,199 --> 01:43:04,197
You know?

2234
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:06,678
Just the whole idea of a...

2235
01:43:06,759 --> 01:43:10,079
a woman being able
to put a man down like a dog

2236
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:11,878
for being bad, or...

2237
01:43:13,678 --> 01:43:16,599
for no reason at all.

2238
01:43:16,678 --> 01:43:18,279
[whispers]
I mean, well...

2239
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:20,159
well, women have
had to deal with

2240
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:24,039
the anytime, anywhere
dark impulses of men

2241
01:43:24,118 --> 01:43:25,519
forever, so...

2242
01:43:25,599 --> 01:43:28,320
God, I thought...

2243
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:29,559
it was time to make the men

2244
01:43:29,638 --> 01:43:32,479
shake in their boots
for a while, you know?

2245
01:43:32,559 --> 01:43:35,359
I guess...

2246
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:38,239
that's how I--
I rationalized it.

2247
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,559
I-- I am gone--

2248
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:42,799
No, that's okay.

2249
01:43:42,879 --> 01:43:44,480
We're all gone.
You know, it's--

2250
01:43:45,479 --> 01:43:49,280
So many games, names.

2251
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,640
Who did you love?

2252
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,320
And who did you really love?

2253
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,639
Did you break their heart?

2254
01:43:55,719 --> 01:43:58,560
Or did they break yours? Or--

2255
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:02,000
You know there's some
real bliss in there somewhere.

2256
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:04,960
And all you're left with is...

2257
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,040
[sighs heavily]

2258
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,801
exhaustion.

2259
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:13,680
I always liked that word.

2260
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:20,200
Oh, and "depleted,"

2261
01:44:20,282 --> 01:44:23,961
"dissipated," and "spent."

2262
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:26,201
Those are good ones.

2263
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:29,401
But "exhaustion..."

2264
01:44:29,481 --> 01:44:31,321
sounds like what it is.

2265
01:44:33,481 --> 01:44:35,802
And what better cure than sleep?

2266
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,921
Lots of sleep.

2267
01:44:40,322 --> 01:44:41,800
[paper tears]

2268
01:44:41,881 --> 01:44:43,400
I'll get this.

2269
01:44:43,482 --> 01:44:45,321
I insist.

2270
01:44:47,121 --> 01:44:48,840
Roderick.

2271
01:44:54,401 --> 01:44:55,402
Do you mind?

2272
01:44:57,002 --> 01:44:58,441
What, do you want me
to take two,

2273
01:44:58,521 --> 01:45:00,361
in case the first one
doesn't do the trick?

2274
01:45:00,442 --> 01:45:01,402
No!

2275
01:45:02,402 --> 01:45:04,162
[whispering stutter]

2276
01:45:04,241 --> 01:45:07,522
I was just thinking,
since we're together...

2277
01:45:09,402 --> 01:45:12,523
while I'm putting one
in your mouth, you could...

2278
01:45:12,602 --> 01:45:14,241
put one...

2279
01:45:16,082 --> 01:45:17,963
Oh.

2280
01:45:18,043 --> 01:45:20,643
You--
You sure about this?

2281
01:45:20,722 --> 01:45:21,803
Yeah.

2282
01:45:21,883 --> 01:45:22,843
You know, I'm not gonna lie.

2283
01:45:22,923 --> 01:45:24,641
I'm a little flattered.

2284
01:45:26,922 --> 01:45:29,402
You should be.
[laughs]

2285
01:45:30,562 --> 01:45:31,522
Go back to my room?

2286
01:45:32,523 --> 01:45:33,562
Oh, no, no, no.

2287
01:45:33,642 --> 01:45:35,443
Not that room.

2288
01:45:36,403 --> 01:45:37,882
A different room.

2289
01:45:41,483 --> 01:45:42,883
Yeah.

2290
01:45:52,444 --> 01:45:53,883
[bells jingle]

2291
01:46:20,883 --> 01:46:23,764
[birds chirping]

2292
01:46:26,324 --> 01:46:27,323
[Roderick narrating]
So that's it.

2293
01:46:27,404 --> 01:46:29,604
The end of my story.

2294
01:46:29,684 --> 01:46:32,563
Well, one of my stories.

2295
01:46:32,644 --> 01:46:33,524
Mommy! Daddy!

2296
01:46:33,604 --> 01:46:36,163
I found a totato for the picnic!

2297
01:46:36,244 --> 01:46:38,484
- A totato!
- Totat-- [chuckles]

2298
01:46:38,564 --> 01:46:41,404
Boy, you really are
the farmer in the family.

2299
01:46:41,484 --> 01:46:43,485
- That's--
- Let's see that.

2300
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,765
I think I know what
we're having for the picnic!

2301
01:46:45,844 --> 01:46:47,364
- Make some totato soup!
- [laughing]

2302
01:46:47,444 --> 01:46:49,524
Buddy, what do you think?
That sound good?

2303
01:46:49,604 --> 01:46:52,004
[Roderick narrating]
The story of how I settled down,

2304
01:46:52,084 --> 01:46:53,204
how I met my wife.

2305
01:46:53,285 --> 01:46:55,844
[chuckles, murmurs]

2306
01:46:55,925 --> 01:46:57,404
Of how I learned that sometimes,

2307
01:46:57,484 --> 01:47:00,725
what seem to be answers
are really questions in disguise.

2308
01:47:02,004 --> 01:47:03,485
The Machine's list
taught me the who,

2309
01:47:03,564 --> 01:47:06,206
the what, the where,
and the when

2310
01:47:06,285 --> 01:47:08,805
is never as important as the why.

2311
01:47:08,884 --> 01:47:11,365
And the why's not all
that important, either.

2312
01:47:11,446 --> 01:47:16,005
* I want to unmake every bed *

2313
01:47:16,085 --> 01:47:20,325
* That I laid down on *

2314
01:47:20,405 --> 01:47:25,405
* Give back everything I've won *

2315
01:47:27,965 --> 01:47:30,285
* Good days *

2316
01:47:30,366 --> 01:47:32,326
* There'll be *

2317
01:47:32,406 --> 01:47:35,286
* Bad days *

2318
01:47:36,565 --> 01:47:41,166
* I want to unread every book *

2319
01:47:41,245 --> 01:47:45,046
* That my eyes laid on *

2320
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,246
[Roderick narrating]
If it really is all a game,

2321
01:47:47,326 --> 01:47:48,886
sometimes the best
thing you can do

2322
01:47:48,965 --> 01:47:50,766
is press the reset button.

2323
01:47:51,886 --> 01:47:56,447
* I want to unsing every song *

2324
01:47:56,526 --> 01:48:00,845
* Unwrite every line *

2325
01:48:00,927 --> 01:48:04,006
[Roderick narrating]
For the first time in my life, I am.

2326
01:48:04,087 --> 01:48:06,006
I dare not add an adjective--

2327
01:48:06,086 --> 01:48:09,367
mature, content, happy.

2328
01:48:09,446 --> 01:48:11,846
"I am" is good enough for now.

2329
01:48:13,007 --> 01:48:15,806
Life is a lot like death.

2330
01:48:15,887 --> 01:48:19,487
It happens to everyone,
whether they like it or not.

2331
01:48:19,567 --> 01:48:21,367
The meaning of it all?

2332
01:48:21,446 --> 01:48:23,367
Honestly?

2333
01:48:23,447 --> 01:48:24,768
Who gives a fuck?

2334
01:48:44,528 --> 01:48:49,088
* I want to unsew every seam *

2335
01:48:49,167 --> 01:48:53,328
* Unwind every clock *

2336
01:48:53,407 --> 01:48:58,447
* Unbreathe every
breath I've made *

2337
01:49:02,087 --> 01:49:06,408
* I want to unset every sun *

2338
01:49:06,488 --> 01:49:11,009
* That my eyes fell on *

2339
01:49:11,088 --> 01:49:16,129
* Till I give back all I've won *

2340
01:49:19,808 --> 01:49:21,929
* Good days *

2341
01:49:22,009 --> 01:49:23,848
* There'll be *

2342
01:49:23,928 --> 01:49:26,649
* Bad days *

2343
01:49:28,609 --> 01:49:30,649
* Good days *

2344
01:49:30,728 --> 01:49:32,727
* There'll be *

2345
01:49:32,809 --> 01:49:35,569
* Bad days *

2346
01:49:37,289 --> 01:49:39,409
* Good days *

2347
01:49:39,488 --> 01:49:41,529
* There'll be *

2348
01:49:41,609 --> 01:49:44,089
* Bad days *

2349
01:49:46,049 --> 01:49:48,249
* Good days *

2350
01:49:48,329 --> 01:49:50,530
* There'll be *

2351
01:49:50,609 --> 01:49:53,409
* Bad days *
