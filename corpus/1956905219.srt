00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:54,506
Oh, Sarah, you know...

337
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:57,275
Fuckin' Sarah.
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah! All right.

338
00:17:57,307 --> 00:18:00,244
You know, what, uh...
Hey, fuck you, you fucking asshole.

339
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,413
You know what? You can't hang with
me anyways, you little party pussy.

340
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:03,681
You know, spatch.
Get out of my place.

341
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:05,182
Yeah, I'll spatch,

342
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:08,119
you fucking pathetic,
crusty fuck.

343
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,889
Yeah, you can't even hang out
in my lair you piece of shit.

344
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,524
[sniffs]

345
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:16,127
[Sarah]
Hey, babe.

346
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,696
Maybe we can
stop by the hardware store

347
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,364
and get some lights
for the gazebo.

348
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:22,666
Yeah, that'd be...
Yeah, that'd be... Mm... great.

349
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,903
Did you have
a talk with Randy today?

350
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:27,438
I... yeah. Yeah, we... more...

351
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:29,374
Yeah, more or less
we had the talk.

352
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:31,842
It got...
It was serious and he's...

353
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,546
So he's now... He's dedicated
to finding a new place.

354
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:36,748
- Blake.
- Was that...? Yeah.

355
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,550
- Are you okay?
- I'm good, yeah.

356
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,353
Yeah, I'm ju...
Yeah, I'm, like tired.

357
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:43,721
I'm kinda tired from, like...
I didn't sleep that great.

358
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,824
- You're high.
- [chuckles]

359
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,759
- No, I'm not.
- You're, hon...

360
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:50,228
You're totally high.

361
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,463
- You... He was smoking...
- Mm-hmm.

362
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:53,932
And I may have breathed some in.

363
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:55,432
- Just stop talking.
- Okay.

364
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:56,600
Whoa, but I do think
you should know,

365
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:57,935
there was a cloud. Like a...

366
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,471
Look, Blake, I ask you
to go out there

367
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:01,205
and do one thing,
just get rid of the guy,

368
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,473
and instead
you get baked with him?

369
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:04,875
No, I didn't. I...
I was like...

370
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,278
We were unwinding.

371
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:10,481
I was just unwinding.
Like, I'm... I've been stressed.

372
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:15,620
Oh. Oh, you've...
you've been stressed. Mm-hmm.

373
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:17,521
You know, you know,
I've been stressed, too.

374
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:20,926
You know, teaching 48
2nd graders a day isn't easy.

375
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,728
Yeah, no, I know.

376
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,430
Do you really?
Because while you go off

377
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:27,199
to your skateboarding job
every day

378
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:29,634
and talk about things
that nobody over 30 cares about,

379
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,802
I'm dealing with angry parents
and trying to figure out

380
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:34,405
how to pay for school supplies
with zero budget.

381
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,242
And then I get to come home
and deal with this shit.

382
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,945
I have students who are
way more mature than you are.

383
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,779
I feel like
that's kind of unfair.

384
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,450
I mean, I haven't, like,
smoked anything in, like, a long time.

385
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:51,856
She got you, man.
She's right.

386
00:19:57,595 --> 00:20:00,765
What's happening, sweetpea?

387
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:02,500
[exhales]

388
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:05,002
I think Blake's on drugs...
again.

389
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:08,807
Good. Then maybe the two of you
should take a little break.

390
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,777
Or a long break,
or a permanent break.

391
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,579
Dad, you're not helping.

392
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:18,383
I need some Dad advice.

393
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:22,221
I love him. But...

394
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:25,723
I don't... I don't know
what to do, I...

395
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,692
Sweetheart...

396
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:31,996
If you are certain
that you love this boy,

397
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:33,964
then just make sure
that you have

398
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:37,568
the unwavering devotion
and dedication

399
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:40,739
that your mother and I share.

400
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,412
Got it. I... I gotta...
I gotta go work this out.

401
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:50,447
Uh... you wanna use
my hotel room?

402
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,884
- What?
- I keep a hotel room.

403
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,486
For the last few months,
I've had a room in town.

404
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,521
You're welcome to it.
Okay, no.

405
00:20:57,555 --> 00:21:00,792
- No, that's... Yeah. I...
- No problem.

406
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:03,461
- Have you heard from Kip?
- Mm... no.

407
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:05,496
[rock music playing]

408
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:26,884
Fire in the fucking hole!
[yelling] Oh, shit!

409
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:34,859
[groaning]
Dude...

410
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,363
I am not stoked
to admit this, dude,

411
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:40,565
but we should
tone it down on the turbo.

412
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:42,567
Uh, do you need, like,
medical attention or anything?

413
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,901
- You good?
- Come on, dude.

414
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:45,470
- Yeah, sorry.
- Just...

415
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:47,038
- Come with me. Let's talk.
- Yeah, sorry.

416
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,772
We just released
that promotional video

417
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:51,343
for the skatewear line,
and it's trending.

418
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,711
We got a shout out
on <i>Kimmel</i> last night.

419
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:54,578
All of our social media
is kinda blowin' up.

420
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:57,548
Plus, that kid's mom,
she's not pressing charges anymore.

421
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,117
- [exclaims] Nice!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

422
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,985
And now you're exactly
seven weeks out

423
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:02,854
from being able to skateboard
on public property.

424
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:07,759
Yeah... Hey, dude. You know I've
enjoyed this time

425
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,660
to be intimate
with my people, right?

426
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:12,596
Oh, and everyone here loves having
you around, Mr. Kapinsky, they...

427
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,367
Blakey-Blake!
I have one rule.

428
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,502
You know this,
I'm not mister,

429
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:19,403
- I'm damn well not sir.
- Right.

430
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:21,372
- Who am I?
- You're Shredd.

431
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:22,807
Yeah. And why?

432
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:25,609
- Uh...
- Thirty-six skin grafts!

433
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:31,048
Zero real teeth and more fuckin
metal than you can shake a dick at.

434
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:32,984
- Right.
- Right. And what's all that from?

435
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:34,451
Shredding it so fuckin' hard.

436
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:36,487
- That's right, man.
- [chuckles]

437
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,888
Fucking shredding!

438
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:39,824
- I'll take...
- [Shredd yells]

439
00:22:39,856 --> 00:22:42,626
- [yells] Fuck!
- Oh, Jesus.

440
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:52,403
- Oh, yeah.
- Why do I have to always hit a fucking stud?

441
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:55,105
'Cause you are
fuckin' Shredd, sir!

442
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:56,640
- That's why.
- That's right, man.

443
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:58,942
- Fuckin' epic!
- Oh, my God. [groans]

444
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:01,012
Let's see
some skating around here!

445
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:03,515
- [rock music playing]
- [yelps]

446
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,816
Yo!

447
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:07,918
All right. All right.

448
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:12,791
[Sarah]
<i>Isn't the architecture great?</i>

449
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,859
I mean, I can see myself
getting married in this house.

450
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:17,929
Sar-bear, I love you,
so I'm gonna tell you this

451
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,830
as delicately as possible.

452
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:22,634
You could do so much better.

453
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,967
- I love Blake.
- [sighs]

454
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,437
He's amazing.
I mean, he's everything...

455
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,473
Listen, whatever you decide,
know that I'll always have your back.

456
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:31,875
I just... I always envisioned
your life differently, you know?

457
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,479
Like, more like mine,
where I have this job

458
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:36,614
where I don't do a lot of work,
but I make a lot of money?

459
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:38,048
I know.

460
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:42,987
- And I know he's the one.
- You know?

461
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:44,888
You know.
Just like in college

462
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:48,226
when you knew
that you didn't like girls.

463
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,894
- Seriously, don't even right now.
- [laughing]

464
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:54,799
If Blake heard you, he would never
stop hounding me for a three-some.

465
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:58,503
Shit really? You know,
I'm totally down for that.

466
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:01,506
[Randy chittering]

467
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:02,973
[laughing]

468
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:04,843
Whoa... [laughs]

469
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:08,113
Oh, sh...

470
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:16,086
Hey, Skippy.
What's up, boy? [smooches]

471
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:21,226
Meow. Me... Jesus!

472
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,628
That's not a...
fucking cat. Blake!

473
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:26,998
What the fuck?
Blake, there's a...

474
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,033
There's a goddamn
muskrat on your porch!

475
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,536
Help, Blake!

476
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:35,773
[people chattering]

477
00:24:35,806 --> 00:24:37,542
Looks like someone's
off the market.

478
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:39,009
I mean, you're not married yet.

479
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,211
- Right?
- Yeah. No.

480
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:43,580
So, what do you say
we have one last office fling.

481
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:45,216
Holy shit.
[chuckles]

482
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:48,786
Uh, I don't... I don't think
that we can do that.

483
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:51,955
- Yeah? Come on.
- Know if I should.

484
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,758
- What happened to fun Blake?
- No, he's right here.

485
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,527
I'm still super fun,
I just, you know,

486
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,794
I'm serious with Sarah,
and, you know...

487
00:24:57,827 --> 00:24:59,763
- You wanna shred me?
- I shouldn't.

488
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,533
You know...
Hey, hey, hey.

489
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,034
- Let's just pause this, take a...
- [Shredd] Blakey-Blake!

490
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:06,570
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing?

491
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:07,939
I'm not... It's not
what it looks like.

492
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:10,040
- I... I know.
- Come on.

493
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:12,243
You're unbuckled,
your fly's down.

494
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:14,012
Look, I don't know
how she got fly down.

495
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,247
That was all that happened,
it was a misunderstanding.

496
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,617
Bro-man, dude.
You have a woman now.

497
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,622
You got me
really worried about you.

498
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:25,990
- I appreciate...
- I don't like it.

499
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:27,259
Got it.

500
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,528
Sorry.
