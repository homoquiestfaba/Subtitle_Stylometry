00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,180
- [Narrator] Although fictionalized,

00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,463
the following dramatization
is inspired by actual events.

00:00:19,742 --> 00:00:22,612

00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:38,258
(baby crying)

9
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:04,857
- [Neighbor] Let's go.

10
00:01:06,865 --> 00:01:09,113
(car horn peeps)

11
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:10,873
- Pick it at 8:00 AM.

12
00:01:10,873 --> 00:01:12,390
And I'm gonna give you...

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,770
Hey man...!

14
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,180
Hey, that's just my kid.

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,970
She don't know nothing.

16
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,803
Hey...

17
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:20,716
Hey, come back.

18
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:21,549
Oh, man!

19
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:22,780
Come on, don't do thi...

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,503
Don't do this to me.

21
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:30,958
What am I gonna do now?

22
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:35,958
What am I gonna do now?

23
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:37,877
Look at you.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,590
Don't you run away from me.

25
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,170
You know what you've done.

26
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,640
Get back here, girl.

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,940
You're always ruining things.

28
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,773
- Ray, please.

29
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,700
Ray, please, don't.

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,733
Stop this hitting!

31
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,566
- Get off of me.

32
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:51,191
You want some of this, huh?

33
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:52,092
- [Mary] Don't!

34
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:53,044
- Don't give me force.

35
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:54,118
You got to face.

36
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:55,560
Is this what you want?

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,550
Hey, girl.

38
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,635
Hey, you know I'm not done with you yet.

39
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:00,134
Where the hell are you going?

40
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:01,173
- Ray, please don't.

41
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:02,006
You're going to kill her.

42
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:03,544
Don't you go.
- Please don't.

43
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:04,443
- [Ray] Mary.

44
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:05,919
- [Mary] Oh no, Ray, please!

45
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:09,419
(Ray and Mary chattering)

46
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:14,009
- [Ray] You know I'm right.

47
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,130
- [Mary] Ray, please, don't do this.

48
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,300
Please don't do this, Ray.

49
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,199
(Mary screams)

50
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,166
(Ray yells)

51
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,525
- Come on, get back in here.

52
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,740
Come on.

53
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,240
Come on, I said get back here.

54
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,553
Oh my God!

55
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:28,419
- Did you see that?

56
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,911
- Yeah!

57
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:31,204
(dog barks)

58
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:32,966
- [Bystanders] Call an ambulance!

59
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:33,842
Is she okay?

60
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:35,498
I don't know.

61
00:02:35,498 --> 00:02:36,455
Call an ambulance.

62
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,083
Is that a kid, what happened?

63
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,158
I don't know.

64
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,491
(bystanders chattering)

65
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:47,480

(ambulance radio chatters)

67
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:55,177
(hospital staff chatters)

68
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:57,385
- [Nurse] You're gonna be
all right, don't worry.

69
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,218
- Miss!

70
00:02:58,218 --> 00:03:00,350
- [Nurse] You'll be all right, just relax.

71
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,612
- [Doctor] Check the
vitals, get her cleaned up.

72
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:02,445
I'm heading down to OR.

73
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:04,062
I'll be back in about five minutes.

74
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:05,009
- [Nurse] Fine.

75
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:07,781
(ambulance radio chatters)

76
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,364
We're almost there.

77
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,450
- [Operator] To Pathology.

78
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,850
Dr. Pullen to Pathology.

79
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,839
(hospital staff chatters)

80
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,672
- Hi.

81
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,950
You're awake, that's good.

82
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,420
I'm Ned Burkett, County Social Services.

83
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,253
How you doin'?

84
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,993
Don't be afraid.

85
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,048
I'm one of the good guys.

86
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:33,715
(tray clatters)

87
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:38,693
(tray clatters)

88
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,393
Can you hear me?

89
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:46,923
No, I don't think you can.

90
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,890
(office staff chatters)

91
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,602
(phone rings)

92
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:03,367
- I have 48 open files,
two hearings this week,

93
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:04,960
and I'm finishing up the grant.

94
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,080
I'll get it to you tomorrow.

95
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,820
- Are we up to speed on the hotline?

96
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,040
- Almost, but I'm having
trouble with Friday.

97
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,600
- We'll staff the hotline first
and then finish the grant.

98
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,433
We have time.

99
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,320
- Sorry, I'm late.

100
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,180
- You had all those in your desk at home?

101
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,093
- My refrigerator.

102
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,320
- They think you're kidding.

103
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,490
Status report.

104
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,990
- I have 56 open files.

105
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,260
I have three hearings this week.

106
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,700
Oh, and I have three families
that need clothes and housing,

107
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,480
so if anybody has any
leads, please let me know.

108
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,330
And my carburetor is acting up again.

109
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,530
- And you're way behind in your paperwork.

110
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,900
- I can either service my clients,

111
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,850
or spend all my time writing reports.

112
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,200
- Now, there's a compromise
in there somewhere.

113
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,380
- Pam, a deaf woman at the
hospital needs your help.

114
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,213
- Okay.

115
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,618
- [Barbara] Now, listen, I'm
gonna need those reports.

116
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:51,701
- [Operator] Dr. Pullen to radiology.

117
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:52,534
- Ned!

118
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:54,590
Hi.
- Hi, Pam.

119
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,900
- What are you doing here?

120
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,016
- Waiting for you.

121
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:57,849
- You're the one who called?

122
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,440
I thought you gave all this up.

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,610
- I tried but teaching wasn't for me.

124
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,570
I missed the trenches.

125
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,290
- [Pam] Well, I'm glad
you're back, we need you.

126
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,123
- Thanks.

127
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:06,510
Ah, Laura Keyes.

128
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,650
20, deaf, possibly mute.

129
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,110
She was brought in last
night by ambulance,

130
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,322
unconscious, no identification.

131
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:13,340
I'd probably still be trying to ID her,

132
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,080
if her father hadn't come
in and demanded a release.

133
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,120
- How badly is she beat?

134
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,100
- Pretty bad.

135
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,690
I didn't want to release
her until I investigated,

136
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,970
and I'm glad I didn't.

137
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,030
Especially after her father,

138
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,230
I'm pretty sure he's the one who did it.

139
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,820
Now, here's the twist.

140
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,653
According to neighbors,

141
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:27,420
she was never let outside the apartment.

142
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,253
- What do you mean never let out?

143
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:30,760
- They kept her locked up,
even when they went out.

144
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,420
He told one neighbor
that she was retarded.

145
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,350
The only thing that was good for

146
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,070
was keeping the place clean.

147
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,410
- How did she end up here?

148
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,630
- She jumped out of a
window to get away from him,

149
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,090
down two stories.

150
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,700
She's lucky she's only bruised.

151
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,910
People next door said the
beatings were a regular thing.

152
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,580
- And they never called the police?

153
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,910
- They thought since she
never screamed for help

154
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,743
that she was all right.

155
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:48,740
- Well, maybe she couldn't scream.

156
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,210
Did they ever think of that?

157
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,320
- Here she is.

158
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,107
Uh, talk to her then.

159
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:54,791
Make a call, will you?

160
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,966
- Thanks.

161
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:57,292
- Bye, Laura.

162
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:59,720
- [Operator] Dr. Roddall, please dial 884.

163
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,370
- Hi.

164
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,053
My name is Pam Willis.

165
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,410
I'm from the Commission
for Battered Women.

166
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,743
I'm here to help you.

167
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:14,935
Who did this to you?

168
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:18,435
(hospital staff chatters)

169
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:21,333
(Pam sighs)

170
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,000
If at first you don't succeed...

171
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,623
Who hurt you?

172
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,900
Do you understand?

173
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,170
You're illiterate.

174
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
- Late last night.

175
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,758
- [Rita] Oh, yes, she's here.

176
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:51,608
- It's okay.

177
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:52,672
It's okay.

178
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:53,947
It's okay.

179
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,188
- Please take a seat.

180
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:56,557
I'll have the doctor
talk to you as soon as-

181
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:58,890
- Just tell me where she is.

182
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,310
- That's the man who hurt you?

183
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,143
Father?

184
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,290
It's okay.

185
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,373
I'm going to talk to him.

186
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,012
He will go away.

187
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:11,845
Stay here.

188
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:17,140
- I, I don't care what you say.

189
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,310
She's my daughter and I want her now.

190
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,584
- Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Keyes-

191
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:22,870
- Mr. Keyes?

192
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,230
I'm Pam Willis.

193
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,660
If you want information
about your daughter,

194
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,640
you're gonna have to talk to me.

195
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,350
She's my client.

196
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,183
- [Ray] Client?

197
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:30,530
What are you talking about?

198
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,500
- Your daughter has been badly beaten.

199
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,630
I'm here to make sure that
she receives adequate care,

200
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,423
and to help her take steps
so it won't happen again.

201
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:39,840
- I don't have to talk to you.

202
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,673
She's mine.

203
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:42,330
- She's not yours, Mr. Keyes.

204
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,400
She's of legal age,

205
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,037
and she told me she
doesn't want to see you.

206
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:46,760
- You're a liar.

207
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,050
She didn't tell you anything.

208
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,330
She can't talk.

209
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,803
- I understood her perfectly.

210
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,850
- She's here and I'm gonna find her.

211
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,070
- If you don't leave immediately,

212
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,400
I will call security
and have you arrested.

213
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,710
- This is none of your business?

214
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,840
- You assaulted her,
that made it my business.

215
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,080
- She's a lying whore.

216
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,890
If you think she's black
and blue now, you just wait.

217
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,560
- This case is under investigation.

218
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,290
If you persist in trying to see my client

219
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,490
without her consent, you'll
find yourself in jail.

220
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,633
Do you understand?

221
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,160
(Pam sighs)

222
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,141
- A real charmer?

223
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:21,610
- Yeah.

224
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,600
Is her room ready?

225
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,520
- If it isn't, I'll get it ready myself.

226
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,353
- Thanks, Rita.

227
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:28,463
(sighs) I'll try later.

228
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:31,110
(phone rings)

229
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,620
- How's it going?

230
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,060
- [Pam] Don't ask.

231
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,700
- Purview had two beds an hour ago.

232
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,070
- They don't take deaf clients,

233
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,520
and the few that do are full.

234
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,980
How long have we been doing this?

235
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,040
- More years than I care to remember.

236
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,850
- Why does it seem to be
getting worse instead of better?

237
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,980
- Well, we're making a difference.

238
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,600
I mean, last year alone,
we did a 4% increase-

239
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,610
- Barbara, you're getting
to be as bad as my ex

240
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,050
with those damn baseball statistics.

241
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,700
- I'm sorry, it's pure reflex.

242
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,800
Before I hit people up for a donation,

243
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,530
I give them the stats.

244
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,952
- Don't talk to me, I
don't have any money.

245
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:05,220
- I know.

246
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,513
I sign your checks.

247
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:12,304
(woman announces over intercom)

248
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:13,295
(elevator bell dings)

249
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:15,404
(people chatter)

250
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:16,237
- Hi.

251
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:17,470
- I didn't expect to see you today.

252
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,303
- The hospital called me.

253
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:19,950
The father showed up and
tried to drag her out.

254
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,910
Luckily, the security guy stopped him.

255
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,860
- Is she okay?

256
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,610
- She's scared, but she's okay.

257
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,620
Listen, I'm arranging
for a restraining order.

258
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,784
As soon as you think she's
ready, we'll file charges.

259
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:30,250
- That could be a while.

260
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,123
She's illiterate.

261
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,893
- She doesn't sign?

262
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:34,760
- She doesn't even know what signing is,

263
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,820
or words, the alphabet.

264
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,020
That animal kept her locked up

265
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,720
and didn't teach her anything.

266
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,750
- He said she's retarded.

267
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,970
- I don't think so.

268
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,850
I want to get her tested,
but I have to figure out

269
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,890
how to pay for it first.

270
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,513
- Here.

271
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:49,210
I want you to call this number.

272
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,610
Ask for Frank.

273
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,460
Tell him I referred you.

274
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,010
Set up whatever tests you need.

275
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,950
I'll find some account to bury it in.

276
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,690
- I was right.

277
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,120
- About what?

278
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
- We did need you back.

279
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,059
Thanks.

280
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,478
(door latch clicks)

281
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,645
(forlorn piano music)

282
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,263
I heard about your father.

283
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,373
I'm sorry.

284
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,453
Okay.

285
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,953
Round one.

286
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,870
(gentle music)

287
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,733
I'm Pam.

288
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,213
You're Laura.

289
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:38,045
I knew you were going
to look at me like that.

290
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:38,878
Okay.

291
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:44,914
A.

292
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,234
A.

293
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,016
Apple.

294
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:55,009
Apple.

295
00:10:57,793 --> 00:10:59,876
This is going swimmingly.

296
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:02,928
B.

297
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:05,186
B.

298
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:10,681
Bird.

299
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:14,760
Bird.

300
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,305
B.

301
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:25,724
Very good.

302
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:27,821
A.

303
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,683
Perfect.

304
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,860
You really don't have a clue, do you?

305
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:38,618
- [Rita] Pam.

306
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,880
Hi, Rita.
- Hi.

307
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,450
What time are you gonna be ready tomorrow?

308
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,283
- Ready for what?

309
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:44,950
- To take her home.

310
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,550
- That's impossible, I haven't
found a shelter for her yet.

311
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,400
- I'm sorry.

312
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,090
The doctor said she's ready,
and we'll need the bed.

313
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,922
I need you here by 10.

314
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:53,755
- 10.

315
00:11:55,988 --> 00:11:56,821
No problem.

316
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:59,680
(phone rings)

317
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,170
Hi, this is Pam Willis.

318
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,530
I can't take your call right now,

319
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,656
but please leave a message after the tone.

320
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:05,820
Thanks.

321
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,653
(phone beeps)

322
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,360
- [Lisa] Hi, this is Lisa
from West Side Shelter.

323
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,100
I'm returning your call.

324
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,283
- Hello, hang on.

325
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,353
Hi.

326
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:15,320
Thanks for calling me back.

327
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,570
- No problem.

328
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,240
Look, I'm really sorry
but we can't take her.

329
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,710
- But you have space!

330
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,560
- But we're not equipped
to handle people like her.

331
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,260
- She's deaf, not a homicidal maniac.

332
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,470
- That's our policy, I'm sorry.

333
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,330
- I have had it.

334
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,580
If you don't take her,
I'm calling the county.

335
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,060
I won't win, but you'll be drowning

336
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,140
in paperwork for a month.

337
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,440
- Let me think about it.

338
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,280
- You do that.

339
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:40,979
(Muttso whimpers)

340
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:42,779
Muttso, what do you want for dinner?

341
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:45,260
Mustard?

342
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,093
Rice?

343
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:47,846
(Muttso whimpers)

344
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:49,546
Ah, right, we had that last night.

345
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,250
Okay.

346
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,513
Peanut butter and jelly.

347
00:12:57,654 --> 00:12:59,297
(Pam sighs)

348
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:00,493
And crackers.

349
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:05,592
(Muttso barks)

350
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:07,731
Here you go.

351
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,274
(van whooshes by)

352
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:12,313
(children chattering)

353
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:15,063
(doubtful music)

354
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,737
- Change your mind.

355
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:44,913
- This is your room.

356
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,093
You stay here.

357
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:52,170
I'll be back

358
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,013
tomorrow.

359
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,703
I wasn't going to hit you.

360
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,203
I was going to touch your hair.

361
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,993
You have pretty hair.

362
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:15,883
I'll see you

363
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,565
tomorrow.

364
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,400
She can stay 30 days, right?

365
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,490
Look, I'm sorry I threatened
you, but I was out of options.

366
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,323
- Forget it.

367
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:30,260
I've been up against the wall myself,

368
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,910
but I'm serious about the terms.

369
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,020
Everyone's got to pull their
own weight around here.

370
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,890
That means you're gonna have
to be here part of every day

371
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,620
to make sure Laura understands
what's expected of her,

372
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,310
and to make sure she does it.

373
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,180
- I'll be here.

374
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,013
Thank you.

375
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,669
(forlorn music)

376
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:00,806
You can't catch me!
- That's mine!

377
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:02,049
(kids yelling)

378
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:06,382
(radio plays music in the distance)

379
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:18,797
(car horn blasts)

380
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,900
- I'm Pam Willis, I'm
here for Laura's clothes.

381
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,610
- I know who you are.

382
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,920
Why don't you just send
her home where she belongs?

383
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,230
- It's her choice, she
doesn't want to come.

384
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,693
I think you know why.

385
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,983
- Wait here.

386
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,543
- Wait.

387
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:53,810
Was Laura born deaf?

388
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,500
- No, she got an infection
when she was six.

389
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,150
- But she doesn't sign, or read.

390
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,780
- Ray wanted her home.

391
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,930
I did the best I could.

392
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,510
- So, she never went to school?

393
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,750
- She's stupid.

394
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,140
That's why he loses his temper.

395
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,390
He doesn't want to beat her.

396
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,980
- She is not stupid,

397
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,933
and there is no excuse for what he did.

398
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:25,960
(people chattering)

399
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,370
- Why do we have to wait a week?

400
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,800
- Because your husband's lawyer asked

401
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,854
for more time to prepare.

402
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:32,187
(Amy sighs)

403
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:36,840
(phone rings)

404
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,880
- He's gonna come after me.

405
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,400
I know it.

406
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,310
- Is there somewhere you can
go where he won't find you

407
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,520
just until the hearing?

408
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,600
- I've got three kids.

409
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,830
They have school.

410
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,960
- We have a restraining order,

411
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,390
but if you think he's gonna try something,

412
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,890
you have to go somewhere safe.

413
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,470
(phone rings)

414
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,900
- I'm tired of hiding,

415
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,210
that's no way to live.

416
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,453
- Neither is having 911 on speed dial.

417
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,120
I know I can get you into a shelter.

418
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,670
All you have to do is
collect the kids and show up.

419
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,120
- Thanks, Pam, but we're all right.

420
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,400
- If there is any trouble,
or you change your mind,

421
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,233
you call me.

422
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,310
- Hey, we're running long in there,

423
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,640
and I've got a meeting at 2:00.

424
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,810
How's your afternoon look?

425
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,050
- I have got to go help with Laura.

426
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,100
I was supposed to be there this morning.

427
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,300
- You can't go there every day.

428
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,133
- I have no choice.

429
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:21,530
There's no one else to help.

430
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:24,374
(gentle music)

431
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:25,909
- [Child] Hold on, hold on!

432
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:27,492
Hi.
- How you doing?

433
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,588
- I brought you something.

434
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,483
Your clothes.

435
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,393
What's wrong?

436
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,041
(Pam gasps)

437
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:55,652
(uneasy music)

438
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,630
- You work too hard.

439
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,463
- You're right.

440
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,880
I'm taking a week off.

441
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,870
- Ooh, as long as you're
dreaming, take two.

442
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,703
You're short.

443
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,160
What's this?

444
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,060
- Laura's test scores.

445
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,760
She's very bright,

446
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,860
but she has the conceptual
level of a five-year-old

447
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,200
and the emotional skills
of a child of eight.

448
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,070
These levels will increase
with education and attention,

449
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,343
but it makes it almost
impossible to place her,

450
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:31,430
because she requires constant supervision.

451
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,263
- This is tough.

452
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:34,380
I mean, it's almost outside our domain.

453
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,213
- [Amy] Pam!

454
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,230
- She's not just a battering case.

455
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,233
Some other agency should be involved.

456
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,596
- Amy.

457
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:44,964
Amy!

458
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:45,797
Amy!

459
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:47,794
Amy!

460
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,549
(tense music)

461
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:50,449
(gun bangs)

462
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:53,588
(Amy screams)

463
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:54,421
- Get on the ground, buddy!

464
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:55,803
- Someone call an ambulance!

465
00:18:57,273 --> 00:18:58,106
- [Cop 1] I got him!

466
00:18:58,106 --> 00:18:59,500
- [Cop 2] Call for backup!

467
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,660
- [Cop 1] Right.

468
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,600
- Uh, look, I don't think
we should wait any longer.

469
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,965
Let's get this meeting started.

470
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,660
(somber music)

471
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,830
- She just got out of surgery.

472
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,417
She's going to make it.

473
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,250
- Great.

474
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,543
Listen.

475
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,410
I don't want anyone in this room

476
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,200
to think what happened
was somehow our fault.

477
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,540
- I should have made
her go to that shelter.

478
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,940
- Pam, she was shot in a public building.

479
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,700
It didn't matter where she was staying.

480
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,975
Are we all clear on that?

481
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:26,930
(phone rings)

482
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,860
All right, let's get on with the meeting.

483
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,000
Paula, you were talking

484
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,840
about some volunteers
you have for the hotline.

485
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,777
- L.

486
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:35,726
(child chatters)

487
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:36,559
Good.

488
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,480
(bird shrills)

489
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,532
Leaf.

490
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:43,199
(birds twitter)

491
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,989
Good.

492
00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:47,062
(car alarm blares)

493
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,562
(Pam screams)

494
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:54,044
(dogs bark)

495
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,803
My ears are bad.

496
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,813
Loud sounds hurt.

497
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,053
I'll explain it to you someday.

498
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,763
Thanks a lot.

499
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,333
- Bad day?

500
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,470
- I can't find a place for Laura,

501
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,590
and I have to pick her up in an hour.

502
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,680
- What are you gonna do?

503
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,570
- I don't have a choice,
I'm gonna take her home.

504
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,403
- Is her father still there?

505
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:20,840
- I'm not taking her to her house,

506
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,290
I'm taking her to mine.

507
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,123
- No way.

508
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,730
- What other options do I have?

509
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,400
I mean, tell me an agency that can help.

510
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,810
Functionally, she's a child,

511
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,940
but she's not a minor so CPS is out.

512
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,840
She's deaf, but she's
illiterate so no DSS program.

513
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,090
She's not an abused spouse.

514
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,270
She's not an abused minor-

515
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,240
- Pam, I get it, but she's a client.

516
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,760
You can't get personally involved.

517
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,140
It's inappropriate, there are boundaries.

518
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,910
- Well, maybe I should just
save us all the trouble,

519
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,170
and take her back to her father
and let him finish the job.

520
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,730
- Taking her home is crossing the line.

521
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,803
I won't allow it.

522
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,590
- Well, if you have to fire me, fire me,

523
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,648
but I am not letting her
slip through the cracks.

524
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:59,981
(office staff chatters)

525
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,963
You'll come to Pam's house.

526
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,100
You

527
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,933
come

528
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,160
to Pam's house.

529
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,893
To Pam's house.

530
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,240
You're okay.

531
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,510
Don't worry.

532
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,343
You're okay.

533
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:30,035
(doubtful music)

534
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:36,277
(residents chatter)

535
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,960
Stay here.

536
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,070
I'm gonna go in there, and
then I'm gonna come back.

537
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,903
Stay here.

538
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:53,374
(labored music)

539
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:18,896
(active music)

540
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,808
It's okay, you're okay.

541
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:24,808
You're okay.

542
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:27,034
Pam.

543
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:29,102
House.

544
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:31,913
Pam's house, yes!

545
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:35,256
We're going to Pam's house.

546
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:39,064
Book.

547
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:39,897
Book.

548
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:46,624
Light.

549
00:22:49,794 --> 00:22:51,330
Door.

550
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,163
Door.

551
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:56,399
Window.

552
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:01,832
Chair.

553
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:02,665
Chair.

554
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,330
Table.

555
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,146
- What is she trying to say?

556
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:10,229
- Everything!

557
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:15,827
(birds warbling)

558
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:19,774
(child chatters in the distance)

559
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:24,064
(dog barks in the distance)

560
00:23:24,064 --> 00:23:26,731
(Ralph squawks)

561
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,690
(Laura gasps)

562
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,960
Yes, bird.

563
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,283
Aren't you the smart one?

564
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:36,712
Come on, Ralph, come on.

565
00:23:36,712 --> 00:23:38,040
That's a good bird.

566
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,740
Oh, yes.

567
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,748
There you go.

568
00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:43,248
(Laura gasps)

569
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,125
Ralph.

570
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,723
Right, bird.

571
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,605
One concept at a time, Willis.

572
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:57,247
I don't think Ralph will mind.

573
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,096
- No more food.

574
00:23:59,096 --> 00:23:59,953
- Isn't that full?

575
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:00,786
You know that one, right?

576
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:02,240
- You're full.

577
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,510
- My father always says I'm full

578
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,520
and it's coming out my ears. (laughs)

579
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,720
- If you rub your tummy,

580
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:09,177
that means that you're hungry.

581
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:12,101
Most of you probably close
your hands to tell people...

582
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:14,934
(car engine hums)

583
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:18,601
(birds chirping)

584
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,085
- What are you doing?

585
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:25,040
No, no, no, no.

586
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,099
You do not have to clean my house.

587
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,599
(bell chimes)

588
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,060
You read.

589
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,700
Learn.

590
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,263
Pam cleans.

591
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,469
Later, right.

592
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:48,013
Knock yourself out, kid.

593
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,503
My family.

594
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,583
Far away.

595
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:15,011
(soft piano music)

596
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,463
My daughter.

597
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,843
Her name?

598
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:27,803
Sarah.

599
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,593
She's, um...

600
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,000
I have to go to work.

601
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,403
You stay here and watch the tape.

602
00:25:58,834 --> 00:25:59,667
Okay?

603
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:04,760
What am I talking about?

604
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,210
I can't leave you here alone.

605
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,768
(Pam sighs)

606
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,625
(phone rings)

607
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,351
(office staff chatters)

608
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:14,443
(phone rings)

609
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:17,598
(car horn peeps)

610
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:19,000
- [Paula] Hey Pam.

611
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,089
- Hi.

612
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:20,922
Thanks.

613
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,700
This is Laura.

614
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,803
This is Paula.

615
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,240
Um, is Barbara here?

616
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,063
- Oh, there she is now.

617
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,387
- Morning.

618
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:37,637
- Good morning.

619
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,290
- I couldn't leave her
alone, not on the first day.

620
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,923
This is Laura.

621
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,173
Laura, this is Barbara.

622
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,253
She's a fast learner.

623
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,843
- I'm going to be monitoring
this situation very closely.

624
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,623
- She's happy to see you.

625
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,395
(phone rings)

626
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:13,503
- [Receptionist] Social services.

627
00:27:13,503 --> 00:27:15,911
(people chatter)

628
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:16,744
- Barbara.

629
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,823
Consider a bribe?

630
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,820
I admit I bend the rules.

631
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,560
- There's the understatement of the year.

632
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,210
- But that doesn't mean I
don't respect them, or you.

633
00:27:33,856 --> 00:27:36,320
(Barbara sighs)

634
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,370
- Just find her a place and
I'll look the other way.

635
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,878
But just this once.

636
00:27:40,878 --> 00:27:43,378
(phone rings)

637
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,360
(shoppers chattering)

638
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,610
- Your hair looks pretty.

639
00:27:56,322 --> 00:27:58,905
(upbeat music)

640
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:04,913
What do you think?

641
00:28:07,257 --> 00:28:08,331
Laura can't think.

642
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:10,748
(Pam laughs)

643
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:17,753
Oh, that's nice and expensive.

644
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,875
We go upstairs.

645
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,443
Okay, here we are.

646
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:30,276
We go up.

647
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,557
It's okay.

648
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:37,390
It's okay.

649
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,373
Sorry.

650
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:41,120
Watch her, watch her.

651
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,953
Watch her.

652
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:52,159
(Laura gasps)

653
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:57,973
(shoppers chattering)

654
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,893
You like this?

655
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,693
No, no, no.

656
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:14,660
No, no.

657
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,470
You take this to Pam's house...

658
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:20,570
Or not.

659
00:29:24,171 --> 00:29:25,254
Works for me.

660
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:31,975
One more.

661
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,609
(doubtful music)

662
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:44,776
(shoppers chattering)

663
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:24,379
(alarm blares)
- Stop!

664
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:25,738
- [Announcer] Please go
to the nearest register,

665
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:28,329
and have a salesperson remove
the anti-shoplifting tags

666
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:29,680
from your items.

667
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,786
The system has been activated...

668
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:31,619
- Hey!

669
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:32,452
Officer!

670
00:30:33,673 --> 00:30:34,506
Wait!

671
00:30:34,506 --> 00:30:35,703
Sir!

672
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:36,536
- Stop!

673
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,224
Miss!

674
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:40,413
I have to take the merchandise.

675
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:41,838
- Sir!

676
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:42,671
No, wait!

677
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:43,550
Wait, please!

678
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,400
Excuse me.

679
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,932
- Hold up!

680
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:47,843
That's her.

681
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:49,760
That's good, go for it!

682
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,140
- Please, let go of her!

683
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,218
She doesn't understand.

684
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,051
She's deaf.

685
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:55,346
(Laura screams)

686
00:30:55,346 --> 00:30:56,911
- No, she's shoplifting these clothes.

687
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:57,744
- No, please, look!

688
00:30:57,744 --> 00:30:59,200
She's not a shoplifter.

689
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,600
She thought I was gone, so
she came out to find me.

690
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,433
She's my client.

691
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,090
Look, we're going right back in the store

692
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,905
and pay for everything.

693
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:10,058
(calm music)

694
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:13,141
(bystanders chatter)

695
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:23,074
(car engine roars in the distance)

696
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:31,669
(vase crashes)

697
00:31:42,411 --> 00:31:44,802
(dog barks in the distance)

698
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,719
(birds twittering)

699
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:02,419
(doubtful music)

700
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:20,682
Hitting is bad.

701
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:28,286
It's all right.

702
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:29,191
It's all right.

703
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:30,441
It's all right.

704
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:33,056
It's okay.

705
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:35,343
It's all right.

706
00:32:41,124 --> 00:32:44,457
(candle holder crashes)

707
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,602
It's all right.

708
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,435
It's okay.

709
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,875
It's all right.

710
00:32:57,129 --> 00:32:59,712
(gentle music)

711
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,937
(Laura sobs)

712
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,938
- [Employee] Pick up.

713
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:15,475
- Thanks a lot.

714
00:33:15,475 --> 00:33:16,308
Thank you.

715
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:17,665
Have a good day.

716
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:20,415
(people chatter)

717
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,530
I might have a lead in a place for Laura.

718
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,660
They're expecting your call.

719
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,981
Keep your fingers crossed.

720
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:29,900
- (chuckles) It's more than you can do.

721
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,733
What happened?

722
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,370
- I caught a football wrong.

723
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,570
My oldest kid's got a rifle arm.

724
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,420
- How's it going?

725
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,690
- My hats off to Julie.

726
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,560
I never realized how much she did.

727
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,490
Even the amount of dirty dishes
they generate is staggering.

728
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,980
- What's it been, two years?

729
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,813
- Yeah.

730
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,783
It still feels like it happened yesterday.

731
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,600
How long was it before you were able

732
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,920
to function again after Sarah?

733
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,130
- Long time.

734
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,590
And I still have moments,
especially when I hear

735
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,680
about some drug dealer
getting early parole,

736
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,753
then I become temporarily deranged.

737
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,260
How are the boys doing?

738
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,686
- I think all right.

739
00:34:07,686 --> 00:34:09,150
At least they had time to prepare.

740
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,640
If there's anything merciful about cancer,

741
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,163
it does give you that.

742
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:14,913
(doubtful music)

743
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,000
Are you all right?

744
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,833
- Yeah.

745
00:34:20,273 --> 00:34:21,870
I think the hardest part for me

746
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,107
is not being someone's mom.

747
00:34:24,107 --> 00:34:25,170
You know?

748
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,620
When I'm out and I hear
some kid yell, "Hey mom!"

749
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:31,900
I know it's not for me.

750
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,350
I miss buying her clothes and

751
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,627
fighting over what time
she needs to come home.

752
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:45,511
On the other hand, it's much less laundry.

753
00:34:49,144 --> 00:34:50,285
(birds chirping)

754
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:52,220
(Muttso growls softly)

755
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,763
You know school?

756
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,603
Good.

757
00:34:56,603 --> 00:34:58,553
Laura's going to school.

758
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,617
(Ralph squawks)

759
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,840
Yes.

760
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,510
Laura goes to school and lives there.

761
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,950
The people at this
school are deaf like you.

762
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:21,483
It's good for Laura to
be with deaf people.

763
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,430
Laura goes to school.

764
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,513
Laura has to learn.

765
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,240
No.

766
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,623
School, that's it.

767
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,473
You come here weekends.

768
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,520
If you're trying to make me
feel like Attila the Hun,

769
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,215
you're doing a hell of a job.

770
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:54,024
(door slams shut)

771
00:35:54,024 --> 00:35:56,357
(Pam sighs)

772
00:35:57,861 --> 00:36:00,444
(bell tolling)

773
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,560
- Time for class.

774
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,933
Today is Tuesday.

775
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,210
Pam comes here

776
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,703
Friday.

777
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:38,157
Go to class.

778
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,400
- There's a dog show on Saturday.

779
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,269
All breeds.

780
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,670
(Muttso whimpers)

781
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,503
Yeah, you're right.

782
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:48,600
They are kind of stuck up.

783
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,377
Hey, we didn't finish the paper.

784
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,127
(cars whoosh by)

785
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,923
- What time is it?

786
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,703
Time.

787
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:08,980
Good.

788
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,950
Good.

789
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,103
What day is today?

790
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,983
What day is today?

791
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,053
What day is today?

792
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,270
Very good.

793
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,103
Very good.

794
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,543
What day is tomorrow?

795
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:32,883
What day is tomorrow?

796
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,023
Good.

797
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,488
Very good.

798
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:43,022
(car horn blasts)

799
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:45,522
(phone rings)

800
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,143
- Hello?

801
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:49,020
Pam Willis.

802
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,450
- Pam.

803
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,710
It's Amy.

804
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,480
- Amy, I've been trying to reach you.

805
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,380
How are you?

806
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,910
- Oh, I'm tired.

807
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,340
We just moved.

808
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,040
That's why I called to
give you the new number.

809
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,170
It's 555...

810
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,961
- Um, okay.

811
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:05,680
- [Amy] 0100.

812
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,500
- And what's the address?

813
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,749
- Oh, um, it's 1201 Chelsea, same zip.

814
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:13,170
- (sighs) I heard that Joe is out on bail.

815
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,760
He hasn't tried to contact you?

816
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,593
- No.

817
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,430
- Oh, just be careful.

818
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,540
Do you need anything?

819
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,760
- No, no.

820
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,593
We're fine.

821
00:38:20,593 --> 00:38:21,860
- Well, if you change your mind,

822
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,720
or if you need help, give me a call.

823
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,750
- I will.

824
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,620
- [Pam] Okay.

825
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,480
- Thanks.

826
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,313
- Bye-bye.

827
00:38:33,387 --> 00:38:37,470
(car horn honks in the distance)

828
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,613
- Hey!

829
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:46,620
(train whistle blasts)

830
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,840
- If you have something to
discuss, call for an appointment.

831
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,860
- I want my daughter.

832
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,060
- Why?

833
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,660
So, you can stand by and
watch your husband use her

834
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,770
for a punching bag.

835
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,660
- She told the police
things that aren't true.

836
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,493
- Please.

837
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,310
- Just who the hell do you think you are,

838
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,820
getting her to file charges against me?

839
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,010
- You assaulted her.

840
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,450
- I was keeping her in line.

841
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,640
- You kept her locked up
like an animal for 14 years,

842
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,520
and you beat her.

843
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,400
- You weren't there.

844
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,599
You don't know what I had to put with.

845
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,510
- I have seen your kind a thousand times.

846
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,820
You are pathetic.

847
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,333
- I want those charges dropped!

848
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,317
- You come near me again,

849
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:24,353
and I'll file charges against you myself!

850
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:37,282
(Pam sighs)

851
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:39,777
- We're not going to try the case.

852
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:40,660
- What are you talking about?

853
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,650
You saw the pictures, the hospital report.

854
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,280
- We don't anticipate a
good outcome to a trial.

855
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,520
- But you have irrefutable evidence!

856
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,570
- Well, we know he beat her,

857
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,780
even he doesn't deny that,

858
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,930
but he's going to say he was
only trying to protect her,

859
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,280
and things got out of hand.

860
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,113
- Give me a break.

861
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:55,590
Protect her from what?

862
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,360
- He says she would sneak
out of the house at night,

863
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,050
and she was doing drugs.

864
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,140
- She never once set foot
outside that apartment.

865
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,330
We have neighbors who
will testify to that.

866
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,480
- And what kind of protection is that,

867
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,690
beating her half to death?

868
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,288
- You're not telling me
anything I don't agree with.

869
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:11,588
- Well, then try the case.

870
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,633
- I'll be blunt.

871
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,334
The problem is is her.

872
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:19,363
She's not going to be
effective on the stand.

873
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,020
- I'll interpret for her.

874
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,050
- She's not literate in
sign, and this pantomime

875
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,730
that you two use isn't exactly scientific.

876
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,420
They'll argue that it's your
interpretation of the case.

877
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,250
- It's the best we can do.

878
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,220
She needs the court's protection.

879
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,770
He's violent, and she doesn't
have anyone to take her part.

880
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,890
He has kept her as an illiterate slave

881
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,330
away from anyone who could help her,

882
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,840
and now you're going to
reward him and punish her

883
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,090
because you don't expect a good outcome?

884
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,550
- Is he guilty?

885
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,650
Yes.

886
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,010
Should he be punished?

887
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:49,843
Yes.

888
00:40:49,843 --> 00:40:52,460
If he's found guilty, will he serve time?

889
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,343
Probably not.

890
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,270
I'm sorry.

891
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,103
- You should be.

892
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:06,150
Don't tell me you're on her side.

893
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,490
- Wait a minute, we're on the same team,

894
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,590
but I'm entitled to my own opinion.

895
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,470
- You think she's right?

896
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,350
- I'm not saying that.

897
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,997
Well, she has tried a few
more cases then we have.

898
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:13,530
But that doesn't matter, all I care about

899
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,363
is Laura's welfare.

900
00:41:14,363 --> 00:41:15,620
- Well, what do you
think I'm fighting for?

901
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,800
Chopped liver?

902
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,270
It's important that this
battery go on record.

903
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,580
His fear of another arrest
will protect her a lot more

904
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,430
than hiding her away for
the rest of her life.

905
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,070
- I agree, so as soon as
she's able to sign enough,

906
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,903
let's bring her back.

907
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:27,100
- Well, that could take a long time.

908
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,743
- So, it takes a long time, so what?

909
00:41:28,743 --> 00:41:31,690
- (sighs) It really aggravates
me when you're so reasonable.

910
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,500
- That's why make an effective team.

911
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,150
You're passion and my temperance.

912
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,350
I'm running late.

913
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,903
I'll check in with you next week.

914
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:43,477
(Ned chuckles)

915
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:46,196
(people chatter)

916
00:41:46,196 --> 00:41:49,180
(Pam sighs)

917
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,513
- We will go to court later,

918
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,423
not now.

919
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,610
Laura goes to school first.

920
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,463
Learns to sign so everyone can understand.

921
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,623
Let's go home and enjoy the weekend.

922
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:16,562
(dreary music)

923
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,133
What's making you sad?

924
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,300
No, Laura is smart.

925
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,393
She learns very fast.

926
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:33,243
(Ralph squawks)

927
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,460
Hearing and speaking
do not make you smart.

928
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,703
Wanting to learn makes you smart.

929
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:48,433
Pam has a dream for Laura

930
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:52,570
to go to school, study hard,

931
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,363
get a good job, her own house, car.

932
00:43:00,212 --> 00:43:02,962
Yes, Laura drives a car, her car.

933
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,754
Yes, that would make me very happy.

934
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,928
(bird twitters)

935
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,593
(lively music)

936
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:30,541
Whoo!

937
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,252
Move.

938
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:54,152
That's it.

939
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:58,181
Yeah!

940
00:43:58,181 --> 00:43:59,014
Whoo!

941
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:00,761
All right.

942
00:44:04,345 --> 00:44:06,928
(gentle music)

943
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:25,030
Yes, I miss her.

944
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:29,483
Sarah, don't worry.

945
00:44:30,497 --> 00:44:31,843
Laura's here now.

946
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,997
Laura take care of Pam.

947
00:44:38,516 --> 00:44:39,849
That's so sweet.

948
00:44:44,276 --> 00:44:47,155
(fire alarm blares)

949
00:44:47,155 --> 00:44:49,133
(Pam gasps)

950
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:51,466
(Pam yells)

951
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:57,815
Turn it off! (screams)

952
00:44:58,522 --> 00:44:59,446
My ears!

953
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,515
My ears!

954
00:45:00,515 --> 00:45:01,515
Turn it off!

955
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,531
(Pam groans)

956
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:09,031
(Pam yelling)

957
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:20,710
This is Pam Willis at 2311 Shady Avenue.

958
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,240
I share my home with a deaf woman.

959
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,520
So if you hear this recording,
there is an emergency.

960
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,290
Please come immediately.

961
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,680
This is Pam Willis...

962
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,238
- [Nurse] Right, well, there's
nobody in the lab right now.

963
00:45:33,238 --> 00:45:36,029
(woman announces over intercom)

964
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:38,532
(people chattering)

965
00:45:38,532 --> 00:45:42,270
(elevator bell dings)

966
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,920
- Excuse me, are you Davidson?

967
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,470
- Yes.

968
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,112
- Your mother's gonna be just fine.

969
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:50,529
(ambulance siren blares)

970
00:45:54,223 --> 00:45:57,390
(elevator bell dings)

971
00:46:00,702 --> 00:46:01,950
- Um...

972
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:02,783
Pam

973
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,953
will be all right.

974
00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:20,199
(door handle clicks)

975
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:23,366
(elevator bell dings)

976
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:26,552
- I'm okay.

977
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,363
Let's go.

978
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:31,800
- Hmm?

979
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,466
Oh.

980
00:46:33,466 --> 00:46:34,299
Hey.

981
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,634
I got a feeling you look better than me.

982
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:40,051
(Pam laughs)

983
00:46:41,152 --> 00:46:43,380
(crickets chirrup)

984
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,363
How's the pain?

985
00:46:46,385 --> 00:46:48,210
- Well, I don't feel quite so much

986
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,100
like throwing myself in front of a bus.

987
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,100
- I don't know where to put that

988
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,210
on a scale from 1 to 10,

989
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,910
but it sounds like an improvement.

990
00:46:57,669 --> 00:46:58,502
- Thank you.

991
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,203
Where's Laura?

992
00:47:00,203 --> 00:47:01,420
- Cleaning the kitchen.

993
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,550
- I don't want her doing that.

994
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,010
- She wants to.

995
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:05,130
Let her.

996
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,743
She needs to let off some steam.

997
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,670
She handled herself pretty well.

998
00:47:11,682 --> 00:47:14,130
- She is smart, huh?

999
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,230
- Get some sleep.

1000
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,670
I'll call you tomorrow?

1001
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,503
- Ring softly.

1002
00:47:27,584 --> 00:47:29,194
(dog barks in the distance)

1003
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:31,944
(birds warbling)

1004
00:47:42,303 --> 00:47:45,092
Why are you sleeping here?

1005
00:47:45,092 --> 00:47:46,175
What's wrong?

1006
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,743
You didn't hurt me.

1007
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,660
You did everything right.

1008
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,023
My ears are bad.

1009
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:08,180
(soft piano music)

1010
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,063
I was deaf like you for two years.

1011
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,723
Yes, deaf.

1012
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,713
I was married to a man who beat me.

1013
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,293
Once he beat me so badly,

1014
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,733
I became deaf.

1015
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,517
Many years ago.

1016
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:40,013
I had an operation.

1017
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,437
Um...

1018
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:44,360
A doctor...

1019
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:47,629
Uh...

1020
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,540
Fixed my ears,

1021
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,670
but I still have problems

1022
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,053
with loud noises.

1023
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,270
I did nothing to make him beat me,

1024
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,953
just like you did nothing to
make your father beat you.

1025
00:49:17,623 --> 00:49:20,150
It doesn't matter what you did,

1026
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,943
he should not hit you.

1027
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,640
I thought it was my fault

1028
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,763
that he would get so angry, but it wasn't.

1029
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,203
And it wasn't your fault either.

1030
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,810
No, Laura is not bad.

1031
00:49:49,937 --> 00:49:51,595
(cars whoosh by)

1032
00:49:51,595 --> 00:49:52,428
- Hello.

1033
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,410
As principal of the school

1034
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,300
I never dreamed I'd have
to put money in a budget

1035
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,770
for a choir for an all deaf class.

1036
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:03,000
The next you know

1037
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,750
they're gonna want their own band.

1038
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,483
(crowd laughs)

1039
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:10,430
Here we have Sister Ann and our angels

1040
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,007
singing from their hearts.

1041
00:50:16,895 --> 00:50:19,478

(crowd applauds)

1051
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:15,060
- I'll meet you here
tomorrow, nine o'clock.

1052
00:51:16,361 --> 00:51:17,611
You're welcome.

1053
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:21,300
- Just 'cause you won't look at me,

1054
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,687
doesn't mean I'm not here.

1055
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:25,150
You couldn't make those
charges stick, could you?

1056
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,210
Guess there was no one
to tell what happened.

1057
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,100
- There is someone to tell what happened,

1058
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,894
and as soon as she can, she will.

1059
00:51:31,894 --> 00:51:33,470
- You never give up, do you?

1060
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,573
- No, I don't.

1061
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,180
- Well, you're gonna lose this one.

1062
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,300
When she finds out there's
no place else to go,

1063
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,617
she'll be back.

1064
00:51:41,617 --> 00:51:44,034
(bell tolls)

1065
00:52:02,296 --> 00:52:04,796
(phone rings)

1066
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:08,683
- Ms. Willis.

1067
00:52:08,683 --> 00:52:09,880
- Sister Ann.

1068
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,220
I was on my way to see you.

1069
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,500
I can't believe the progress
you're making with Laura.

1070
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,103
She's learning so quickly.

1071
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,850
- I'm afraid I have some bad news.

1072
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,051
The school is closing.

1073
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:21,884
- What?

1074
00:52:21,884 --> 00:52:23,220
- Diocese funds were cut,

1075
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,810
and they had to make
adjustments accordingly.

1076
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,570
We were just informed this morning.

1077
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,240
I've been trying to
find Laura a placement,

1078
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,180
but it's gonna be difficult.

1079
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,440
- When does this happen?

1080
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,890
- The end of the month.

1081
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,810
We're asking all of the
students who board here

1082
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:37,160
convert to day status
by the end of the week.

1083
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,640
- She can't stay here?

1084
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,330
- Not after Saturday, no.

1085
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,660
She's welcome to continue
class for a month.

1086
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,470
- But it's a two-hour commute.

1087
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,170
There's no way I can bring
her here every morning.

1088
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,590
- I wish there was an alternative, Pam.

1089
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,423
I'm sorry.

1090
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,520
- Okay.

1091
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,662
The Langston School, right.

1092
00:52:55,662 --> 00:52:56,495
I'll give it a try.

1093
00:52:56,495 --> 00:52:57,469
Thank you very much.

1094
00:52:57,469 --> 00:52:58,835
(phone rings)

1095
00:52:58,835 --> 00:52:59,960
Oh, thank you.

1096
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,590
(office staff chatters)

1097
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:03,310
- Textbook catalog.

1098
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,430
Some county bureaucrat jerks me around,

1099
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:08,003
I tell him off, and I head
down here for chocolate.

1100
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,253
How's Laura doing?

1101
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,713
- Fine.

1102
00:53:12,713 --> 00:53:13,546
She's, uh...

1103
00:53:13,546 --> 00:53:15,624
You know, she's got basics down now.

1104
00:53:15,624 --> 00:53:17,300
She just needs to learn how to spell

1105
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,050
like any other seven-year-old.

1106
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,700
- Man, I hope they teach
her to spell better than me.

1107
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:23,763
That school was a godsend,

1108
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:25,513
what would we have done without it?

1109
00:53:26,986 --> 00:53:28,236
- I don't know.

1110
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:29,973
- Well...

1111
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,703
Back to the mines.

1112
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:37,497
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1113
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:39,000
The school closes tomorrow.

1114
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,120
I still haven't found her a place.

1115
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,230
I'm not gonna send her back to Ray.

1116
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,340
- Lunch is on me.

1117
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,173
- Oh, thank you.

1118
00:53:44,173 --> 00:53:45,010
- You're welcome.

1119
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,080
Worst comes to worst, we'll
put her on assistance.

1120
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,960
- Oh great, then she can
move to a welfare hotel.

1121
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,440
Maybe the junkies and hookers
will get her some work.

1122
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,410
- Well, give me an alternative.

1123
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:55,290
The shelters are either
full or they won't take her.

1124
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,840
- She's not going to one of those hotels,

1125
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,390
that's not gonna happen to her.

1126
00:53:59,665 --> 00:54:00,498
- You know, maybe you should think

1127
00:54:00,498 --> 00:54:02,900
about letting another
advocate take over the case.

1128
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,460
Ned!
- For your sake.

1129
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,073
- Well, none of them can sign.

1130
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,880
Look, I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

1131
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,090
I can't eat when I'm angry.

1132
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,040
- All right, truce.

1133
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:13,481
We'll figure something out.

1134
00:54:13,481 --> 00:54:16,231
(people chatter)

1135
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:21,530
- [Pam] I thought you
broke your right finger.

1136
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,539
- This is new, basketball.

1137
00:54:23,539 --> 00:54:26,960
- (gasps) I didn't know
raising boys was so dangerous.

1138
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,560
- I'm surprised I can even walk.

1139
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,680
You know, you should come by
and play with us sometime.

1140
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,833
We're at Sinclair Park
every Saturday morning.

1141
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,973
- That's when I catch up on my paperwork.

1142
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:43,303
- You can't spend your
whole life working, Pam.

1143
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,550
- My life is my work.

1144
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,050
My clients don't have a lot of options,

1145
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:49,500
and that means I don't either.

1146
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,150
- You aren't one of your clients,

1147
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,030
but maybe you should be.

1148
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:56,010
At least you get more of
your attention that way.

1149
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,130
- I appreciate your
interest, Ned, but I'm fine.

1150
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,080
It's not as grim as it sounds.

1151
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,190
- Just admit, you should start taking care

1152
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:02,340
of yourself more often.

1153
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,010
Promise me you'll think about it.

1154
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,350
- I promise.

1155
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:09,000
- Good.

1156
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,613
- You can be very exasperating.

1157
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:13,313
- Look who's calling the kettle?

1158
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:19,741
(birds chirping)

1159
00:55:26,048 --> 00:55:26,881
- Hi.

1160
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:28,020
- Hi.

1161
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,900
- I'm sorry I didn't call,
but I was coming this way,

1162
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,460
and I thought I'd dropped this off.

1163
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,880
I've had it on my desk for a month.

1164
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,370
It's a house warming present.

1165
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,203
- Oh, I love it.

1166
00:55:36,203 --> 00:55:37,036
Thank you.

1167
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:40,730
I'm, I'm sorry I haven't
checked in in a while.

1168
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:41,948
We've just been so busy.

1169
00:55:41,948 --> 00:55:43,350
- You don't have to check in.

1170
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,437
I'm glad things are going well for you.

1171
00:55:49,656 --> 00:55:52,239
(uneasy music)

1172
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:54,792
- You coming back in?

1173
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:56,625
- I'll be right there.

1174
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:04,500
- Oh, Amy.

1175
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,007
It's just gonna happen again,

1176
00:56:07,007 --> 00:56:08,803
and this time he might kill you!

1177
00:56:09,956 --> 00:56:10,956
- I'm sorry.

1178
00:56:19,937 --> 00:56:23,173
(cars whoosh by)

1179
00:56:23,173 --> 00:56:26,006
(car horn blasts)

1180
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,890
- I'm sorry you're not happy,

1181
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,203
but we have no choice.

1182
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,783
Your friends will come
and visit you, I promise.

1183
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,930
That's enough!

1184
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,183
We have to leave!

1185
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,380
You know, I could be at home
taking a bath, or reading,

1186
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,510
or lying on a beach somewhere
drinking something pink.

1187
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,790
But, no, I have to give
up any pretense of a life

1188
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:16,660
to take care of people
who don't have a clue.

1189
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,640
I'm sorry you have to leave your friends,

1190
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,620
but you have to learn about priorities,

1191
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,838
like having a roof over your head.

1192
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:25,154
And Amy, well, you'll be glad
to know she's alive and well.

1193
00:57:25,154 --> 00:57:27,654
(tense music)

1194
00:57:28,804 --> 00:57:32,756
I might as well just throw
my life down a rafter.

1195
00:57:32,756 --> 00:57:36,064
(Pam chatters quietly)

1196
00:57:36,064 --> 00:57:36,922
What are you doing?

1197
00:57:36,922 --> 00:57:39,412
(brakes screech)

1198
00:57:39,412 --> 00:57:40,245
Wait!

1199
00:57:51,975 --> 00:57:52,808
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1200
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,613
Not Laura's house, Pam's house.

1201
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:02,872
Not Laura's house, Pam's house.

1202
00:58:02,872 --> 00:58:04,766
Pam's house.

1203
00:58:04,766 --> 00:58:07,877
No, no, you're never
going back there again.

1204
00:58:07,877 --> 00:58:08,916
Never.

1205
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:10,408
Never.

1206
00:58:10,408 --> 00:58:11,383
Never.

1207
00:58:11,383 --> 00:58:13,800
(soft music)

1208
00:58:14,894 --> 00:58:15,727
Okay.

1209
00:58:22,756 --> 00:58:26,089
(office staff chatters)

1210
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:28,920
- Barbara?

1211
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,753
- Hey.

1212
00:58:29,753 --> 00:58:30,860
On the facilities list,

1213
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,010
you forgot the Catholic Mission Home.

1214
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,510
- No, I didn't.

1215
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,340
- It's not here.

1216
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,700
- Well, that's, that's
because it's closed.

1217
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,480
- It's open, Pam has a client there.

1218
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,860
- Had...

1219
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,043
It closed a month ago.

1220
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:47,620
- You sure?

1221
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,453
- Yeah.

1222
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,023
- Thanks.

1223
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,843
(washing machine hums)

1224
00:58:59,843 --> 00:59:02,343
(door knocks)

1225
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,580
(door knocks)

1226
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,093
- Barbara?

1227
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:12,926
- Laura's here.

1228
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:16,375
- Yes.

1229
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:18,390
- She's been here all month.

1230
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,223
- Yes, but I-

1231
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:20,370
- No buts.

1232
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:21,900
You lied to me.

1233
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,070
- I didn't have any choice.

1234
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:25,320
- I don't know how to
make this any more clear.

1235
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,250
You are required by law to act

1236
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,920
in the best interest of your client,

1237
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,140
and bringing her home
isn't in it by a long shot.

1238
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:32,973
- What do you want me to do?

1239
00:59:32,973 --> 00:59:35,430
- Keeping her here is not an option.

1240
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:36,440
- What do you want me to do?

1241
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,123
- If I could hand you a list of options-

1242
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:39,307
- What do you want me to!

1243
00:59:39,307 --> 00:59:41,650
- I want you to do your job!

1244
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,180
Don't you think it kills everyone

1245
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,580
to have to send somebody back
to the hell they came from?

1246
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,550
- I don't know what happened to you.

1247
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,280
When we started, we were
gonna save the world

1248
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,630
if it killed us, and now
here we are 15 years later,

1249
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,550
and you're ordering me to
just throw someone away?

1250
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,750
Is that what authority
does, makes you callous?

1251
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,650
- Are you through?

1252
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:03,163
- I didn't mean that, but
I, I have to keep her safe.

1253
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:08,090
- Aren't you mistaking
her for someone else?

1254
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,053
Look.

1255
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,710
You got a week.

1256
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:17,673
If she's not out of this
house, you're fired.

1257
01:00:24,456 --> 01:00:26,789
(Pam sighs)

1258
01:00:28,221 --> 01:00:31,221
(people chattering)

1259
01:00:33,511 --> 01:00:34,644
- [Ned] Pam.

1260
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:35,686
- Ned, hi.

1261
01:00:35,686 --> 01:00:37,818
- Hi, I got Laura into the
Pearson Learning Center.

1262
01:00:37,818 --> 01:00:39,610
- I thought that was for people
with physical disabilities.

1263
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,810
- Well, it is primarily.

1264
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:42,280
They do have some
hearing-impaired residents,

1265
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,002
and the best part is she'll
be in school every day.

1266
01:00:44,002 --> 01:00:45,283
- You're amazing!

1267
01:00:45,283 --> 01:00:46,180
I can't thank you enough.

1268
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,570
- You can try.

1269
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:48,980
- I got to go.

1270
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,951
You're a lifesaver.

1271
01:00:49,951 --> 01:00:50,784
I'll call you later.

1272
01:00:50,784 --> 01:00:53,284
(alarm beeps)

1273
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:58,562
- All right, heads up now.

1274
01:00:58,562 --> 01:01:00,385
There you go.

1275
01:01:00,385 --> 01:01:02,454
(man laughs)

1276
01:01:02,454 --> 01:01:03,370
- [Players] Are you kidding me?

1277
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,473
That's got to be a traveling violation.

1278
01:01:04,473 --> 01:01:05,635
Way to go, John.

1279
01:01:05,635 --> 01:01:07,235
Over here, come on, pass it!

1280
01:01:07,235 --> 01:01:08,164
Pass it!

1281
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,018
(players yell)

1282
01:01:10,018 --> 01:01:10,893
Over here!

1283
01:01:10,893 --> 01:01:12,112
Pass it to me, I got it!

1284
01:01:12,112 --> 01:01:13,647
(players groan)

1285
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:16,647
(radio plays music)

1286
01:01:17,938 --> 01:01:20,998
(residents chatter)

1287
01:01:20,998 --> 01:01:23,790
(whistle shrills)

1288
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:26,240
- Hi, I'm Pam Willis.

1289
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,690
- John Sanchez.

1290
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:28,640
This must be Laura.

1291
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:34,170
- She's not too thrilled about being here.

1292
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:35,380
- She's gonna love it.

1293
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,120
If you want to just step back here,

1294
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,070
I'll get the forms for you to fill out.

1295
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,210
If you could just fill this out,

1296
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:42,344
we'll get the ball rolling.

1297
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:43,600
- Thanks.

1298
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,302
- Have a seat here, please.

1299
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:46,712
Here's a pen.

1300
01:01:46,712 --> 01:01:48,350
- Thank you.

1301
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,440
- Luckily, we had a space.

1302
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,643
First one in two years.

1303
01:01:52,643 --> 01:01:53,930
- [Pam] Really?

1304
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:55,520
- I'm sure it's gonna work out.

1305
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,830
But like I told you, the residents here

1306
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:58,470
are pretty much on their own.

1307
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:01,020
- Well, she's smart and
she's come a long way

1308
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,720
in a very short time.

1309
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,750
She does need some supervision,

1310
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,060
so maybe your staff could keep an eye out?

1311
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,384
- We'll do the best we can.

1312
01:02:08,384 --> 01:02:09,384
- Thank you.

1313
01:02:11,058 --> 01:02:13,808
(birds warbling)

1314
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:15,683
See you Friday.

1315
01:02:24,605 --> 01:02:27,272
(forlorn music)

1316
01:02:38,894 --> 01:02:41,560
- Come on.

1317
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,393
Toss it.

1318
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:45,474
Come on.

1319
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:48,057
(gentle music)

1320
01:02:53,151 --> 01:02:53,984
Come on.

1321
01:03:03,557 --> 01:03:04,390
- Time.

1322
01:03:09,643 --> 01:03:10,677
Hi.

1323
01:03:10,677 --> 01:03:11,510
You play?

1324
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,327
You play?

1325
01:03:14,327 --> 01:03:15,160
Come on.

1326
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,660
I need one more player.

1327
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,610
They're killing me.

1328
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:20,623
Please.

1329
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:26,613
I'm Doug.

1330
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:30,460
Laura.

1331
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:31,710
Hey, guys, hey!

1332
01:03:32,659 --> 01:03:33,884
This is Laura.

1333
01:03:33,884 --> 01:03:35,382
She's on my team.

1334
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:36,215
- Laura.

1335
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:37,917
Hi, Laura.

1336
01:03:39,161 --> 01:03:40,676
I'm Mike.

1337
01:03:40,676 --> 01:03:41,509
Mike.

1338
01:03:47,704 --> 01:03:49,328
- [Players] Okay, we're up.

1339
01:03:49,328 --> 01:03:50,326
Set five.

1340
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,159
All right.

1341
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,173
All right.

1342
01:03:54,173 --> 01:03:55,006
Oh!

1343
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:57,052
- Good.

1344
01:03:58,854 --> 01:04:00,104
- Give me five!

1345
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:04,736
- Okay, all in favor of a comedy club?

1346
01:04:04,736 --> 01:04:06,700
(phone rings)

1347
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,780
All in favor of a picnic?

1348
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,180
- [Employees] Sounds good, picnic.

1349
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,290
- Picnic it is.

1350
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,233
I guess that's it.

1351
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,930
- Hey, Pam, how does
Laura like the new school?

1352
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:18,460
- I don't know, I haven't
been to see her yet.

1353
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,860
- [Paula] Well, tell her I said hi, okay?

1354
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,052
- I will.

1355
01:04:21,052 --> 01:04:22,519
(phone rings)

1356
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:25,372
(people chatter)

1357
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:26,555
(radio plays music)

1358
01:04:26,555 --> 01:04:29,555
(residents chatter)

1359
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,663
- Can you use your voice?

1360
01:04:39,323 --> 01:04:41,233
Can you say Laura?

1361
01:04:45,496 --> 01:04:47,079
Feel the vibration.

1362
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:50,370
That's my voice.

1363
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:51,203
Try yours.

1364
01:04:52,729 --> 01:04:54,743
Are you afraid you'll sound weird?

1365
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,767
I became deaf when I was 15.

1366
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:03,030
So, I know what my voice sounds like.

1367
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,063
I like to talk, even
though I can't hear it.

1368
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:10,663
I'm afraid if I don't,

1369
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,963
someday I won't be able to.

1370
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:16,973
- Hey.

1371
01:05:16,973 --> 01:05:17,890
Hi.

1372
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:18,980
- You remember Mike?

1373
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,707
He came to visit last week.

1374
01:05:20,707 --> 01:05:21,540
What's up?

1375
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:22,373
- Hi.

1376
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,960
Listen, my plans canceled tonight,

1377
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,040
so I thought maybe you
guys might want to go out,

1378
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,651
play some pool?

1379
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:30,651
- Want to play pool?

1380
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,593
- [Mike] What's she saying?

1381
01:05:32,593 --> 01:05:33,950
- She doesn't know what pool is.

1382
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,313
- Tell her we'll show her.

1383
01:05:38,248 --> 01:05:39,159
It's fun.

1384
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:40,510
It's fun.

1385
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,690
- We'll show you.

1386
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:42,523
It's fun.

1387
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:46,070
She can't, she has homework.

1388
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:47,830
- When, when can she make it?

1389
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:48,663
When?

1390
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:51,973
- Tomorrow.

1391
01:05:51,973 --> 01:05:53,430
- Great.

1392
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,580
Tomorrow we'll play pool.

1393
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:56,470
Tomorrow.

1394
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,320
I'll see you tomorrow.

1395
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,153
Okay?

1396
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,183
- We'll go tomorrow.

1397
01:06:05,196 --> 01:06:07,946
(Laura chuckles)

1398
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,637
(soft piano music)

1399
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:18,190
(Muttso whimpers)

1400
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,790
- Hello, Muttso the Magnificent.

1401
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:22,353
How are you?

1402
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,436
(Muttso whimpers)

1403
01:06:24,436 --> 01:06:25,936
What's the matter?

1404
01:06:26,907 --> 01:06:28,574
Cat got your tongue?

1405
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:33,643
(Pam sighs)

1406
01:06:38,435 --> 01:06:41,685
(soft music continues)

1407
01:06:52,144 --> 01:06:52,977
- Laura.

1408
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:58,573
Laura.

1409
01:07:12,633 --> 01:07:14,913
(stereo plays country music)

1410
01:07:14,913 --> 01:07:17,663
(car horn peeps)

1411
01:07:19,099 --> 01:07:21,599
(Laura claps)

1412
01:07:23,722 --> 01:07:26,899
- If I worked at a pool hall,

1413
01:07:26,899 --> 01:07:29,008
I'd run the table too.

1414
01:07:29,008 --> 01:07:30,656
- Fine.

1415
01:07:30,656 --> 01:07:31,489
- Come on.

1416
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:33,409
Come on.

1417
01:07:33,409 --> 01:07:36,492
(clients chattering)

1418
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:45,897
I'll show you.

1419
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:55,171
(Laura gasps)

1420
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,004
Great.

1421
01:07:56,004 --> 01:07:56,837
Try again.

1422
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,919
(dog barks)

1423
01:08:02,919 --> 01:08:06,427
(children chatter)

1424
01:08:06,427 --> 01:08:09,760
(TV playing rock music)

1425
01:08:13,648 --> 01:08:17,231
- Oh, weekend to the
teenager, my favorite.

1426
01:08:25,805 --> 01:08:29,388
(radio playing rock music)

1427
01:08:42,227 --> 01:08:43,810
What are you doing?

1428
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:49,720
You left the TV on and
dishes all over the place.

1429
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,783
Are you waiting for me to clean it up?

1430
01:08:54,941 --> 01:08:55,940
When?

1431
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:58,103
You're supposed to be doing homework.

1432
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:03,980
If you have time for playing with makeup,

1433
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:06,440
my makeup, by the way,

1434
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,793
you have time for chores.

1435
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:11,060
I wa...

1436
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,743
I want you to go in there
and clean up your mess!

1437
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,940
You better straighten up.

1438
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:21,190
I didn't like this behavior in Sarah,

1439
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,817
and I don't like it in you!

1440
01:09:26,933 --> 01:09:28,554
(Pam sighs)

1441
01:09:28,554 --> 01:09:30,807
(dog barks)

1442
01:09:30,807 --> 01:09:35,057
(children yelling in the distance)

1443
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,177
What am I doing?

1444
01:09:50,328 --> 01:09:53,580
(Ralph squawks)

1445
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:54,693
Dinner's ready.

1446
01:09:56,327 --> 01:09:58,744
(soft music)

1447
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:05,400
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings,

1448
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,993
but I have to work and so do you.

1449
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:12,843
You have to work very hard to catch up.

1450
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,462
(Ralph squawks)

1451
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:27,924
Yes, you have to catch up
to all people your age,

1452
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,273
hearing and deaf.

1453
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,100
Well, I'm sick of working
all the time, too,

1454
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,410
but that's what people do.

1455
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:44,880
They work and they study.

1456
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,583
And if they're lucky,

1457
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:49,790
they have people they love to go home to.

1458
01:10:51,194 --> 01:10:53,571
(portentous music)

1459
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:54,404
Ralph!

1460
01:10:56,322 --> 01:10:57,322
Here, Ralph!

1461
01:10:58,847 --> 01:11:00,431
Come, Ralph!

1462
01:11:00,431 --> 01:11:01,987
Here, Ralph!

1463
01:11:01,987 --> 01:11:03,392
(Ralph squawks)

1464
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:04,225
Ralphie!

1465
01:11:11,276 --> 01:11:12,288
(Ralph swishes)

1466
01:11:12,288 --> 01:11:13,897
(Ralph squawks)

1467
01:11:13,897 --> 01:11:16,647
(birds warbling)

1468
01:11:23,923 --> 01:11:26,756
(van engine hums)

1469
01:11:27,673 --> 01:11:30,673
(people chattering)

1470
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,923
I'm sorry about the weekend,

1471
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:41,693
and I'm sorry about the bird.

1472
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:45,273
We'll get a new bird.

1473
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:51,533
I know you love that bird.

1474
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:55,833
I know you're not Sarah!

1475
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:01,130
Fine, you don't want me
to come back, I won't!

1476
01:12:04,942 --> 01:12:07,692
(doubtful music)

1477
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:13,664
(keyboard clicks)

1478
01:12:15,843 --> 01:12:17,176
- May I come in?

1479
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,153
- You're the boss.

1480
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,810
- [Barbara] How's the stash?

1481
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:25,124
- Help yourself.

1482
01:12:25,124 --> 01:12:28,457
(office staff chatters)

1483
01:12:30,097 --> 01:12:31,940
(phone rings)

1484
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:33,053
- Look, Pam.

1485
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,433
I didn't want to see
either of you get hurt.

1486
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,920
There's going to come a time

1487
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,490
when you're not gonna be
able to help her anymore.

1488
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:44,680
And no matter how close you are,

1489
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,253
someday she's gonna leave.

1490
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,483
You've had enough loss in your life.

1491
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,003
I miss you.

1492
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:00,690
- I have a lot of work to do here.

1493
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,333
- Cool.

1494
01:13:08,547 --> 01:13:10,046
(dog barks)

1495
01:13:10,046 --> 01:13:12,796
(people chatter)

1496
01:13:13,661 --> 01:13:16,527
(bell tolls)

1497
01:13:16,527 --> 01:13:17,610
- Good catch.

1498
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:20,350
Gee, hope you're hungry.

1499
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,091
- I could be starving and not
make a dent in that table.

1500
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:26,720
- Oh, my boys will help
out in that department.

1501
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:27,820
Is Laura here?

1502
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,227
- No.

1503
01:13:29,227 --> 01:13:30,140
- Is she all right?

1504
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:30,973
- She's fine.

1505
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,150
She's doing well in her classes.

1506
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,200
She seems to like it.

1507
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:35,563
- But...

1508
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,200
- She's angry at me.

1509
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,130
- Well, now, that's good.

1510
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:42,760
She's breaking away from mom.

1511
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,293
I'm going through that times three.

1512
01:13:44,293 --> 01:13:46,170
- [Kathy] Ned, Ned!

1513
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:48,250
- I think somebody is trying
to get your attention.

1514
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,933
Come on!
- I'll be right there.

1515
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,260
The game is gonna start soon.

1516
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:54,203
I'm center field.

1517
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:58,523
Her name's Kathy.

1518
01:14:00,462 --> 01:14:03,246
- I didn't know you were seeing anyone.

1519
01:14:03,246 --> 01:14:04,579
- Just happened.

1520
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,673
I wasn't looking for it.

1521
01:14:06,673 --> 01:14:08,963
I didn't think I was ready.

1522
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,753
It feels right.

1523
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:17,030
I hope you find someone, too, Pam.

1524
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,190
- Well, give me the name of the store,

1525
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,607
I'll pick someone up on the way home.

1526
01:14:20,607 --> 01:14:23,190
(Ned chuckles)

1527
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:26,200
- You always make me laugh.

1528
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,170
Hey, you want to play?

1529
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:33,003
- No, no.

1530
01:14:33,003 --> 01:14:35,767
I'll come by later and watch.

1531
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:39,157
- Well, don't watch too long, okay?

1532
01:14:42,796 --> 01:14:45,546
(doubtful music)

1533
01:14:46,603 --> 01:14:49,053

(residents chatter)

1538
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,070
- Hi.

1539
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:25,100
Where is, um...

1540
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:27,330
Doug?

1541
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:28,540
Doug, where?

1542
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,180
Where is Doug?

1543
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,083
Doug, where?

1544
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,320
Study, studying.

1545
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,950
Studying.

1546
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:40,850
(Mike laughs)

1547
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:41,710
Um...

1548
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:46,290
You, me, play pool.

1549
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:48,239
You wanna play pool, hmm?

1550
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,389
You and me, I'll drive.

1551
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,823
Great, come on.

Oh, you want to go home?

Listen, I'm gonna take you home, okay?

1573
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,704

01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,833

It's okay.

It's okay.

1578
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:05,183
Stop it.

(Laura squeals)

1580
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,880
Stop it, okay?

1581
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,066
Just give me a kiss.

Bitch!

(phone rings)

1587
01:18:41,201 --> 01:18:42,034
- Hello?

1588
01:18:42,034 --> 01:18:43,350
- [John] Is this Pam?

1589
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:44,600
- Yes.

1590
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,600
- This is John Sanchez at Pearson.

1591
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,190
Is Laura with you?

1592
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:49,810
- No.

1593
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:50,653
Isn't she there?

1594
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:54,000
- We did a bed check, she's missing.

1595
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,050
- I'll be right over.

1596
01:18:58,631 --> 01:19:01,464
(van engine hums)

1597
01:19:02,415 --> 01:19:05,425
(crickets chirrup)

1598
01:19:05,425 --> 01:19:06,343
- When was the last
time you talked to her?

1599
01:19:06,343 --> 01:19:08,300
- I can't handle any I
told you so's right now.

1600
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,190
- That's not what I meant.

1601
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:11,530
I just wonder whether her
father might've found her.

1602
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:12,480
- I don't think so.

1603
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:15,403
She's angry at me.

1604
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,100
Maybe I pushed too hard,

1605
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,990
maybe we got too close.

1606
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:21,260
I just wanted to make it-

1607
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,590
Don't blame yourself.
- Why not?

1608
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:23,630
You knew this would happen.

1609
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:24,740
I screwed up.

1610
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,250
- You broke every rule in the book,

1611
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,310
and you're a royal pain in the ass,

1612
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:30,020
but you're the only one who cared enough

1613
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,978
to make sure she got a chance.

1614
01:19:31,978 --> 01:19:33,470
(Pam sighs)

1615
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:34,303
- John?

1616
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,213
John?

1617
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,460
Is she back?

1618
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:39,860
- No.

1619
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:40,713
- What did the police say?

1620
01:19:40,713 --> 01:19:42,860
- They said call back
in a couple of hours,

1621
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,027
if she's still not back.

1622
01:19:44,027 --> 01:19:45,830
Great.
- You have no idea

1623
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:46,692
where she went?

1624
01:19:46,692 --> 01:19:47,630
- No.

1625
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:48,720
- What about her clothes?

1626
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,290
- They're still in her room.

1627
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:52,320
I have two staff people looking,

1628
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,570
that's all I had to send.

1629
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,580
We're handling it, Doug.

1630
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,790
- I saw her earlier today.

1631
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:00,623
- When?

1632
01:20:00,623 --> 01:20:02,260
- Around dinnertime.

1633
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:04,130
She and Mike were heading to his car.

1634
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:04,963
- Who's Mike?

1635
01:20:04,963 --> 01:20:06,710
- Just a guy.

1636
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:07,960
He hangs out here sometimes.

1637
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,590
- Laura knows him?

1638
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:10,870
- A little.

1639
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:12,540
He took us to play pool.

1640
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:13,540
It's where he works.

1641
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,573
- Would he hurt her?

1642
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:20,503
- I don't know.

1643
01:20:20,503 --> 01:20:21,853
I don't know him that well.

1644
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:23,543
I should've stopped them.

1645
01:20:23,543 --> 01:20:24,720
- Do you know where he lives?

1646
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,270
Where is this pool hall?

1647
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:28,670
- Fantasia Pool Hall, a
few blocks down Central.

1648
01:20:29,859 --> 01:20:31,901
(suspenseful music)

1649
01:20:31,901 --> 01:20:34,818
(crickets chirrup)

1650
01:20:38,874 --> 01:20:41,457
(door rattles)

1651
01:20:43,384 --> 01:20:44,879
- We're closed.

1652
01:20:44,879 --> 01:20:46,750
- We're from Pearson Learning Center.

1653
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,140
One of the residents is missing.

1654
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:49,940
- I'm sorry, whoever you're
looking for isn't here.

1655
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:52,343
- I need the address of someone
who works for you: Mike.

1656
01:20:52,343 --> 01:20:54,010
- What do you want him for?

1657
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:55,980
- He was with Laura today,

1658
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,480
that's the girl who's missing.

1659
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:01,653
- Mike.

1660
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,870
- [Pam] Where's Laura?

1661
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:05,108
- Uh, Laura who?

1662
01:21:05,108 --> 01:21:06,824
- You came to see her today.

1663
01:21:06,824 --> 01:21:08,207
I don't know what you're talk-
- Listen!

1664
01:21:08,207 --> 01:21:10,714
(bottle crashes)

1665
01:21:10,714 --> 01:21:11,547
Oh my God!

1666
01:21:11,547 --> 01:21:12,380
If you hurt her...

1667
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:14,937
- I, I already said I never even saw her.

1668
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:17,100
- You wanna play like that,
I'm gonna call the cops.

1669
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,933
Where is your phone?

1670
01:21:17,933 --> 01:21:18,892
- W-Wait!

1671
01:21:18,892 --> 01:21:21,123
- If you know anything,
you better tell us now.

1672
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:23,023
- Where is she?

1673
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:25,730
- I didn't hurt her.

1674
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,780
I didn't hurt her.
- Where is she!

1675
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:29,700
- She's in the park!

1676
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:30,533
- What park?

1677
01:21:30,533 --> 01:21:31,366
- Creston.

1678
01:21:32,351 --> 01:21:33,923
- Come on, Pam.

1679
01:21:33,923 --> 01:21:35,039
Pam.

1680
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:35,872
Pam.

1681
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:47,227
- [Barbara] Okay, there.

1682
01:21:47,227 --> 01:21:48,233
There, there.

1683
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:50,662
Turn here.

1684
01:21:50,662 --> 01:21:53,495
(van engine hums)

1685
01:21:59,822 --> 01:22:00,905
Look at that.

1686
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:05,530
- [Pam] I'm gonna stop,
maybe they've seen her.

1687
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:06,380
- [Barbara] Okay.

1688
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:10,214
Hey.

1689
01:22:10,214 --> 01:22:12,205
Pam, that's her.

1690
01:22:12,205 --> 01:22:13,320
That's her!

1691
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,433
- Oh, God!

1692
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:18,739
What happened, what happened?

1693
01:22:18,739 --> 01:22:19,987
What are you doing to her?

1694
01:22:19,987 --> 01:22:21,019
No, I know her!

1695
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:22,037
I know her!

1696
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:22,995
I know her, I'm Pam.

1697
01:22:22,995 --> 01:22:25,035
I'm Pam, I know her.

1698
01:22:25,035 --> 01:22:26,265
What happened?

1699
01:22:26,265 --> 01:22:27,721
- She got kind of roughed up.

1700
01:22:27,721 --> 01:22:29,134
She's all right.

1701
01:22:29,134 --> 01:22:30,162
- [Biker] She's okay.

1702
01:22:30,162 --> 01:22:30,995
She's okay.

1703
01:22:30,995 --> 01:22:32,245
- Are you okay?

1704
01:22:34,103 --> 01:22:35,377
I was so scared.

1705
01:22:35,377 --> 01:22:37,794
(soft music)

1706
01:22:44,769 --> 01:22:45,602
Okay.

1707
01:22:47,216 --> 01:22:48,400
Come on.

1708
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,380
Thank you so much.

1709
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,623
- [Biker] Yeah, sure, lady.

1710
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:52,663
- Thanks, guys.

1711
01:22:52,663 --> 01:22:54,019
- [Biker] Forget it.

1712
01:22:54,019 --> 01:22:55,632
- You okay?

1713
01:22:55,632 --> 01:22:57,032
I was so worried.

1714
01:22:57,032 --> 01:22:59,782
(frogs croaking)

1715
01:23:14,846 --> 01:23:17,763
(crickets chirrup)

1716
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,800
(dog barks in the distance)

1717
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,133
- I was worried.

1718
01:23:36,207 --> 01:23:37,624
I care about you.

1719
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,763
- No, I'm sorry.

1720
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,333
I had my dream for you,

1721
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,507
and I never stopped to ask about yours.

1722
01:24:17,507 --> 01:24:19,924
(soft music)

1723
01:24:25,938 --> 01:24:28,605
Of course, you can have a dream,

1724
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:32,033
and it doesn't have to
be the same as mine.

1725
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,720
It can be whatever you want.

1726
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:42,703
College?

1727
01:24:45,509 --> 01:24:46,342
A job.

1728
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:55,847
Making your own life is a good dream.

1729
01:25:01,607 --> 01:25:02,440
My dream?

1730
01:25:04,335 --> 01:25:06,668
(Pam sighs)

1731
01:25:08,093 --> 01:25:10,343
I have to think about that.

1732
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,416
(people chattering)

1733
01:25:25,896 --> 01:25:30,360
- [Clerk] I think it
should be at 8:30 tomorrow.

1734
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,933
- Don't be afraid.

1735
01:25:31,933 --> 01:25:33,483
Just tell the truth.

1736
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:50,227
(elevator bell dings)

1737
01:25:52,209 --> 01:25:56,805
(woman announces over intercom)

1738
01:25:56,805 --> 01:25:58,205
Should we go in?

1739
01:25:58,205 --> 01:26:00,788
(gentle music)

1740
01:26:03,094 --> 01:26:04,511
- Thank you, Pam.

1741
01:26:08,816 --> 01:26:11,316
- You've been keeping secrets.

1742
01:26:29,374 --> 01:26:30,707
I love you, too.

1743
01:26:38,384 --> 01:26:41,134
(resolute music)

1744
01:27:28,053 --> 01:27:30,553
(synth trill)
