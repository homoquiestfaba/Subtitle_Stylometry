1
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,758
- Gingerbread loaf for Hazel!
- Oh. Yeah. Hi. Sorry.

2
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,241
Yeah, that's me. Oh. Thank you.

3
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:10,379
Have you had this loaf before?
It is so good.

4
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:13,689
- I don't do carbs.
- Oh, okay.

5
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:15,793
These days Mark Clemmons
is known in kitchens

6
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:19,172
across America
as the Cookie King of Chicago.

7
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:20,965
I have a very big announcement.

8
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:23,206
- You do? Oh, tell us.
- I do.

9
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,103
As you know, every December

10
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:27,482
Chicago holds
the Christmas Bakeoff.

11
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,066
I have the pleasure of being
the judge

12
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:32,206
for this year's theme,
a gingerbread showdown.

13
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,068
I love it!

14
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:36,448
We are gonna have
edible works of art

15
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:38,448
that require originality

16
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:40,758
and an architectural precision.

17
00:01:40,862 --> 00:01:44,793
I'm really happy to announce
that Clemmons Cookware

18
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,068
will be donating the prize
money to this year's winner,

19
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:50,517
a $100,000!

20
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,379
Hundred-thousand dollars?

21
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:54,241
I'm-I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

22
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,931
But that's, like,
an insane amount of money

23
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,310
for a baking competition, right?

24
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:00,689
Oh, I don't work for the money.

25
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:03,448
I work
because I make people smile.

26
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, oh.

27
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,172
Yeah. Okay.

28
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:11,655
- Are you nervous?
- I mean, a little.

29
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:14,000
It is my last day
as a consultant.

30
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:16,517
Starting next week,
hopefully your first day

31
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,896
as a brand-new
full-time architect.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,206
Oh, I hope so.

33
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,758
Huh, I bet you're the smartest,

34
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:24,000
hardest-working consultant
they have there.

35
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:27,103
There's no way they're giving
that job to that ding-dong.

36
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:29,137
Well, he's not a ding-dong, dad.

37
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:32,172
He went to Harvard, which he has
told me numerous times.

38
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:35,965
Don't get too wrapped
up in your fancy new job.

39
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,103
I still expect you back home
for Christmas.

40
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:40,172
Don't worry. I'll be there.

41
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:41,896
All right, I better head on in.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,448
- I don't wanna be late.
- Love you, kid.

43
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,689
Love you, too, dad. I got this.

44
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,103
Sorry.

45
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,551
The main thing I'm worried about
is the clear story over here.

46
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:05,769
I suppose the arched ceiling
will need to be reinforced

47
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:08,620
by columns
to support the skylight.

48
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:11,620
What if we used
steel T-shaped columns

49
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,758
instead of reinforced concrete?

50
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:15,344
That would make it cheaper,
and plus,

51
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:18,862
it'll fit the design aesthetic
they're looking for.

52
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,724
You had me at cheaper.

53
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,137
Um...

54
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:28,251
We have enough time to change
the model before tomorrow?

55
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,344
Yeah, sure, it'll only take a
few hours with the 3-D printer.

56
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:32,827
Great.

57
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:34,896
Benjy-Boy, can you handle that?

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,413
Only if we can hit Annie's after
for Margarita Mondays.

59
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,206
- I'm taking a client.
- Good. All right, everyone.

60
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,734
That gives us two weeks to wrap
up everything before Christmas

61
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:45,034
and family time.
Let's hop to it.

62
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,620
Nice input today, Hazel.

63
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:57,758
- As always.
- Thank you, sir.

64
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,034
Actually, about that, I don't
mind changing the design myself.

65
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:02,931
I know Ben has been
super swamped lately,

66
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,793
and I secretly kind of love
using that 3-D printer.

67
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:08,689
- Hazel...
- And I can stay late again.

68
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:11,000
Just to make sure
everything is perfect.

69
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:13,103
I appreciate you
burning the midnight oil.

70
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:14,976
Believe me, your hard work
hasn't gone unnoticed,

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,689
but before you pull
another all-nighter

72
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:19,689
and sleep under your desk
again...

73
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,586
You scared the cleaning team,
by the way.

74
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:23,413
They're usually not so thorough.

75
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:25,586
You should know
I'm giving the job to Ben.

76
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,379
I'm sorry. If we could
hire you both, we would.

77
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:32,379
We just think that
Ben's a better fit for the team.

78
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,689
He plays well with others.

79
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:38,827
And you are a fantastic
architect.

80
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:41,000
And when you undoubtedly
get hired by another firm,

81
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:43,896
they're gonna be lucky
to have you.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,517
I'll, uh...

83
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,689
I'll, uh, leave you to it.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,827
It is so good to see you, Nina.

85
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,310
Oh, you, too, honey.

86
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:34,000
You know, when I said
I needed something sweet,

87
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:35,665
I figured we could just
pick something up.

88
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,310
I didn't mean for you
to bake for me.

89
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:38,907
Yeah, I got the impression
from your text

90
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:41,413
this called
for something homemade.

91
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,413
Yeah, you're not wrong.

92
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,655
- Everything okay?
- Oh, not really.

93
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:49,206
I got some pretty bad news
at work today.

94
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,275
I didn't get the job.

95
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,068
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I know
how much you wanted that.

96
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:56,137
- Yeah.
- What happened?

97
00:05:56,241 --> 00:06:00,034
Apparently, not being named
Benjy-Boy happened.

98
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:02,793
Well, thank heavens for that.

99
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,655
Fortunately,
I brought the big guns.

100
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:08,344
We got some double-fudge
brownie cupcakes

101
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,655
with some toasted
marshmallow frosting

102
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:12,724
and red and silver sprinkles.

103
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:13,965
Ah.

104
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,655
So this is a new recipe.

105
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:19,931
Add the salt.

106
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:23,103
Now...

107
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:25,931
be honest.

108
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,689
- Always.
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:30,068
Well, it looks amazing.

110
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,862
Mm...

111
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:39,103
Oh, my gosh, Nina,
this is incredible.

112
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:41,275
I wanna include them
in my next cookbook.

113
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:45,068
- Mm-hmm.
- And speaking of which...

114
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,241
Hot off the presses.

115
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:50,241
Oh, uh, wow!

116
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,103
"For the sake of the bake."
I love it.

117
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:56,137
I think you might wanna see
the dedication inside.

118
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,448
My mom would have loved this.

119
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:12,689
I hope so. You know, she was
the best baker I ever met.

120
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:15,448
I can't believe
it's been two years.

121
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:20,896
Hey. When are you going
back home for Christmas?

122
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:26,275
I mean, now I don't know.

123
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,379
Okay, you know I take my role as
your godmother seriously, right?

124
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,206
I know.

125
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,862
Why not take an extended break
back home?

126
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:38,551
Yeah, I mean, I suppose I could
go help my dad with the bakery

127
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:40,655
during the Christmas rush.

128
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:45,137
What?

129
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:49,413
Nothing. Yeah, I'm sure
your dad would love that.

130
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:51,965
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

131
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:54,275
I haven't been back since...

132
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,965
Hey, I'll be there
visiting Shelby.

133
00:07:58,068 --> 00:07:59,896
Mm.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,068
Oh, okay, I'm sorry,
is that name

135
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:03,517
still banned from being spoken?

136
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,900
Ah, yes, and I will let you know

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,068
when that embargo has lifted.

138
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:09,034
Okay.

147
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:43,965
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to surprise you.

148
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:47,148
I-I wasn't expecting you
for a week-and-a-half.

149
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,092
Yeah, I just thought I'd come
a little bit early.

150
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:50,896
They must love you at work.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,793
Oh, recently hired,
and already got vacation days.

152
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:57,310
Oh. No, honey.

153
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,620
You didn't get it?

154
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:04,310
Oh. Well, come in.
Don't just stand there.

155
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:07,206
And... Oh.

156
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,620
We'll, uh,
we'll talk all about it.

157
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:19,344
You okay?

158
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:24,862
Yeah, yeah. It's just, um...
It's been a while.

159
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:28,137
I know. Take your time.

160
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:30,482
I'll make some coffee.

161
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:35,103
- What is all that?
- Huh?

162
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:36,344
Oh, just some bookkeeping

163
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:38,448
I'm doing for the bakery.

164
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:40,000
And going through receipts.

165
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,379
One thing I learned is I took

166
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:42,793
one too many pedicures
this year.

167
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:44,416
Well, in fairness,
I've seen your feet.

168
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,206
I'd consider that
money well spent.

169
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,793
Yeah.

170
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:50,586
So how is everything doing, dad,
with the bakery?

171
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:54,689
Oh, you know, not the same
without your mother.

172
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,482
But doing fine.

173
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:05,862
- Dark roast okay?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

174
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:08,344
Ah, let's chat,
I have a few choice words

175
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:10,965
I'd like to say
about Bloom City Design.

176
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,275
Actually, dad,
could we take a raincheck?

177
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,241
Being home
is just a little overwhelming.

178
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:18,965
Oh.

179
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:21,413
I-I mean, uh, yeah. Sure.

180
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:24,379
Maybe I could borrow the car,
just drive around town a little.

181
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,931
- Is that okay?
- Well, of course, Hazelnut. Uh.

182
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,482
- The starter is still finicky.
- Okay.

183
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,862
And the passenger window
is still sticky.

184
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,862
Okay. Anything else?

185
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:36,379
Crack up the tunes, 'cause
the stereo is still awesome!

186
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:39,862
Okay. Thanks, dad.
I'll be back by dinner, okay?

Planning on paying

Oh. I'm sorry. Yeah,
I totally can. I'm just, I...

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,034
Are you
the Oak Park scone thief?

200
00:12:06,137 --> 00:12:08,517
Yeah. Uh, police have a warrant
out for my arrest.

201
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,103
All right, FBI's most wanted,
I saw it

202
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:11,827
on Date Nightlast night.

203
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,137
Thought you'd be taller.

204
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:18,482
I'm Hazel, of Hazelnut Bakery.
I'm Ted's daughter.

205
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:21,413
Oh. Sorry.

206
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:25,344
Uh, I'm James, the new baker.

207
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:27,551
- You're a baker?
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:30,586
I didn't realize that was
such a dangerous line of work.

209
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:36,907
Did you enjoy that scone
you stole?

210
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:39,551
Mm, didn't steal it,
and if I'm being honest,

211
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,295
your presentation
could use a little work.

212
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,344
- Wow. Notes already. Okay.
- Hey.

213
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:45,724
I just call it like I see it.

214
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:48,344
But, yes,
that was a very delicious scone.

215
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,517
Oh.

216
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,896
Why is it so slow right now?

217
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,689
It's never this empty
around Christmas.

218
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,562
Might have something to do
with the new bakery

219
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,137
they opened up
across the street.

220
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,103
You saw the line, right?

221
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,896
That line is for another bakery?

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,172
- Yup. Butter Up Bakes.
- Butter Up Bakes?

223
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,379
Yeah. Oh. Excuse me,
I've got something in the oven.

224
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:09,758
Oh, sorry. W... Uh, where did
you say that you baked before?

225
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:11,251
Oh, I didn't.
This is my first baking job.

226
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:12,517
Your-your dad hired me on as a

227
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,900
contractor
to do the renovations.

228
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,551
Renovations? What renovations?

229
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:17,137
He didn't tell you? Oh!

230
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:19,000
No, he most certainly did not!

231
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,724
What is going on here?

232
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:27,344
Perfection,
that's what's going on.

233
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:28,769
You should've heard
when they were doing renos

234
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:29,793
over at Butter Up Bakes.

235
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:33,551
Every day banging those...

236
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:37,206
- It was hell.
- Okay, this is a disaster.

237
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,724
That's why I'm fixing it,
I mean, your dad had me in

238
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:41,803
to fix one of the shelves,
it turns out they were all

239
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,655
about to collapse,
and the pantry was busted.

240
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,241
The stove needed new burner.

241
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:48,586
So two months later, here I am,
baking as well.

242
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:51,448
I had no idea
things were this serious.

243
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:54,310
Everything is in disrepair,
there's no foot traffic,

244
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,344
thanks to the new bakery
across the street.

245
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:58,620
We're behind on...

246
00:13:58,724 --> 00:14:00,310
Hey, I'm-I'm part
of the solution.

247
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:01,965
Or I'm trying to be.

248
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:03,896
No, o-of-of course, I'm sorry.

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,241
It's just, this is bad.
This is really, really bad.

250
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:11,586
It's already hard enough
just being back here.

251
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:16,931
I've heard a lot about your mom.

252
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:19,517
Sounded like
she was an incredible woman.

253
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:23,379
She really was.

254
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:26,758
Now everything she's built
is just falling apart.

255
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,206
- Hi.
- Hey.

256
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,965
Hope you don't mind steaks
for dinner.

257
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:40,482
No. Wow, big guy's grilling.

258
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:42,172
I didn't even know
you could do that.

259
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:44,172
Ah, I just wanna expand
my repertoire

260
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:46,241
from bacon and eggs.
How was town?

261
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,793
Oh, uh, actually,
I went by the bakery.

262
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:53,655
- Oh?
- Also, I found this.

263
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,793
Uh-oh.

264
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,896
Dad, why didn't you tell me
things were this bad?

265
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,931
The last thing
your mother would want

266
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,862
is for you to put your dreams
on hold and shoulder this.

267
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:08,655
Plus, you had a new job
and everything.

268
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,655
I thought I could fix it.

269
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:36,034
I mean, look,
of the three cakes today,

270
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:39,965
for me, visually,
the cleanest cake was Joshua's.

271
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,103
Judges, this is it.

272
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,689
Bakers, you did not

273
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:46,275
make it easy for the judges.

274
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,827
But in the end, only one baker

275
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:51,620
can win $50,000

276
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:54,413
and the title
of Holiday Baking Champion.

277
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:57,620
And that baker is...

278
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:04,068
Jennifer! Congratulations!

279
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:08,137
You are
the Holiday Baking Champion!

280
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,206
I'm the Holiday Baking Champion!

281
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:19,034
- Dad!
- Steaks are a little over-done.

282
00:16:19,137 --> 00:16:20,655
But with some steak sauce...

283
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:23,241
I think I know
how to save the bakery.

284
00:16:23,344 --> 00:16:25,034
Uh, don't you wanna eat first?

285
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:27,620
Yes, yes, I'm starving.
I'll tell you my idea.

286
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,724
Are you guys serious, Ted?

287
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,275
Dead serious.

288
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:38,068
Hazel and I don't exactly
know each other.

289
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,758
And is either of us qualified

290
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:41,379
to enter a national contest
like that?

291
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,034
- Mm...
- I mean...

292
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:44,379
I told you this was a bad idea.

293
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:46,482
- I can do this alone, dad.
- Now hang on.

294
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:48,689
We all know how good
James' baking is.

295
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:51,827
- I had one scone.
- You said it was delicious.

296
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,724
And that scone
was just the beginning.

297
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh. Well, at least he's humble.

298
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:59,103
Aren't these contests
super competitive?

299
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:01,448
- Would we even get in?
- Um, excuse me.

300
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:04,137
My mother was a legend
at the Christmas Bakeoff.

301
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,068
She won four times.

302
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:08,517
As soon as they hear
her daughter wants to enter,

303
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,517
they'll eat it up.

304
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,310
At least she's humble.

305
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,379
It's a $100,000, James.

306
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:17,137
Half of that will
save this bakery and your job.

307
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:21,413
The other half could be
a down payment on a house.

308
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:24,413
Okay, hold on a second, before
you go getting too excited,

309
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:28,275
Julia Child, I'm the one
who needs convincing here.

310
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:29,793
Meaning?

311
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,000
An audition.

312
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,413
Okay.

313
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:41,206
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Wha...

314
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,724
- Oh.
- Okay.

315
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:54,413
All right, what we have here
is a lemon-basil shortbread

316
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:56,275
with a raspberry royal icing.

317
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:58,931
- Interesting.
- Questionable.

318
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:01,793
I mean, especially 'cause
it's a Christmas cookie.

319
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:03,793
Well, I think they look great,
James.

320
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:08,103
- Thank you, Ted.
- Okay. Well, moment of truth.

321
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,137
Oh, wow. They're...

322
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,379
- Wow, it's amazing!
- Oh, great.

323
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:21,838
Full disclosure,
I make these a lot.

324
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,102
They're my daughter's favorite.

325
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:25,551
Oh, you have a daughter?

326
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:26,896
I sure do. Claire.

327
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,206
- She's incredible.
- Mm.

328
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,931
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
you passed with flying colors.

329
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:34,034
- Mm.
- What do you think?

330
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,206
Mm...

331
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,931
James, welcome to the team.

332
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:42,827
Oh. I'm...

333
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,413
I don't know.

334
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,448
I had to go through
this whole song and dance

335
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:49,724
to prove myself to you?

336
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:52,655
I mean, what are
you bringing to the table?

337
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,344
Why should I do this with you?

338
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:56,527
You know, maybe I should just
join the competition alone.

339
00:19:56,551 --> 00:19:59,275
Wow. I didn't know
you were such an opportunist.

340
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:01,379
- Hazel has a lot to offer.
- Thank you.

341
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:04,620
Oh. Like?
Well, I mean, you don't bake.

342
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:07,103
You work an office job.

343
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,137
- An office job as an architect.
- So?

344
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:15,413
She has a vision of how this
gingerbread house should be.

345
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:17,206
- Right?
- Oh.

346
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,344
Y-you have a vision?

347
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:22,724
Well, not... not yet.

348
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:24,379
But, would you... Hold on.

349
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:27,965
I know how I want it
to make me feel.

350
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:32,000
Buildings aren't just
glass and cement to me.

351
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:34,482
They're art and craftsmanship.

352
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:37,862
A good design
takes a, a basic human need

353
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:39,724
and turns it into a symbol

354
00:20:39,827 --> 00:20:43,172
of passion and ingenuity.

355
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:46,034
And I know that might seem silly
to think about these things

356
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:47,862
with respect
to a gingerbread house,

357
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:52,137
but if I could just capture
even a fraction of that

358
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:54,551
in an edible version,

359
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,758
then I feel like we would've
achieved something.

360
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,655
Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

361
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:17,172
All right, you guys sure you
don't need an extra hand here?

362
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:20,413
I think we'll manage. You have
more important things to do.

363
00:21:20,517 --> 00:21:23,206
- James, give me a ride home?
- You bet, Teddy-bear.

364
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,310
Okay. Um, I'm gonna come up
with some designs tonight.

365
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:27,793
Sounds good.

366
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:31,379
I'm gonna fix
that mis-matched tile

367
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:33,217
as soon as I'm done
with the rest of the renos.

368
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:36,517
Oh, that's okay. I like it.

369
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,620
See ya.

370
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:41,862
♪ This Christmas

371
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:49,034
Nina?

372
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,172
- Okay.
- At dinner.

373
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,206
I'm gonna hold you to that.

374
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:03,172
Nina...

375
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,103
What are you doing here?

376
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:08,724
I'm about to buy a rhubarb tart.

377
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:12,206
- Okay.
- Oh, wait.

378
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:30,655
All right.

379
00:22:30,758 --> 00:22:34,655
- This place is Shelby's?
- Uh... Mm...

380
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:38,965
W-why didn't you tell me that
your niece owns this bakery?

381
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:42,448
Now, I wanted to tell you, but
your father swore me to secrecy.

382
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:44,379
Yeah, he thought
you might worry.

383
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:47,068
And besides, you girls haven't
really talked since high school,

384
00:22:47,172 --> 00:22:49,655
and I-I didn't wanna
stick my nose

385
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:52,034
into something
that wasn't my business.

386
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,931
- Wow.
- Hazel?

387
00:22:59,551 --> 00:23:01,896
Hey, Shelby.

388
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,137
Uh, it's been a while.
Visiting for Christmas?

389
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:08,931
Yeah, yeah. I, um, I didn't
realize you still lived here.

390
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:12,172
Just moved back. Actually, um,
I was in Chicago for a bit.

391
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:14,758
Had a little bakery out there,
but rent was no joke.

392
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:16,620
So after we got married,

393
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:19,896
Rebecca and I decided
to try out here.

394
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,793
- Oh.
- Uh, Rebecca, this is Hazel.

395
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:26,931
Oh. Hi,
it's so nice to meet you.

396
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,137
Yeah, it's-it's great
to meet you.

397
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:34,379
I imagine
this must be a surprise,

398
00:23:34,482 --> 00:23:37,827
considering all the boyfriends
I burned through in high school.

399
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:41,275
Well, one in particular
comes to mind.

400
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:45,241
Yeah, you know,
I've, I've processed that.

401
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:47,586
Well, that's-that's great.

402
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:51,275
I'm just trying to process where
all my mom's customers went.

403
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:52,758
I didn't choose this spot

404
00:23:52,862 --> 00:23:54,793
to put the hurt
on your mom's bakery, Hazel.

405
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:56,896
You know
I always loved that place.

406
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,896
It's a funny way of showing it.

407
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,551
Don't blame me if the bakery
is struggling. Okay?

408
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:04,448
Your presentation needs work,
try switching things up

409
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:06,034
with some new recipes
once in a while.

410
00:24:06,137 --> 00:24:09,034
Wow, Shelby knows everything

411
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,448
there is to know
about everything, huh?

412
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,413
I see not much has changed
since high school.

413
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:30,862
That was dramatic.
Everything okay over there?

414
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:33,137
I mean, y-yeah, fine.

415
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:36,724
I'm just having a really hard
time deciding on a design.

416
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:38,206
Oh. Hm.

417
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,793
Also, I, um, I stopped by
Butter Up Bakes

418
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:46,068
after I left this afternoon.

419
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:47,931
Met the new owner.

420
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:53,517
This calls
for your mother's secret weapon

421
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,793
whenever you were upset,
a good-old banana split.

422
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:05,551
You, um, you're upset I didn't
tell you it's Shelby's place.

423
00:25:05,655 --> 00:25:07,862
You didn't just not tell me.

424
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,758
You told Nina
not to say anything.

425
00:25:10,862 --> 00:25:13,827
I mean, dad, between this
and-and me finding out

426
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,182
about the bakery not doing well,

427
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:17,413
it feels like
you're keeping secrets.

428
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,241
And we don't do that
in this family.

429
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:22,827
Given your history with Shelby,
I thought it was for the best.

430
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,103
- Chocolate sauce?
- I deserve to know these things.

431
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:26,551
They affect me, too.

432
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:29,103
And-and, yes, be generous.

433
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:31,482
I'm sorry
I didn't have a better excuse

434
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:33,827
than I was trying
to protect you,

435
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:35,965
but it's the best I've got.

436
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,379
- Whipped cream?
- Obviously.

437
00:25:39,896 --> 00:25:41,448
We've had a rough
couple of years.

438
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:44,965
I didn't want to dump
anything else on you.

439
00:25:47,344 --> 00:25:50,689
If you're still mad, I'm happy
to eat this on my own.

440
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:53,931
Oh, don't be ridiculous, dad.
I'm not that mad.

441
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:58,896
Your job is to find the
cheesiest Christmas movie on TV.

442
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,482
You got it.

443
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:27,344
- Good morning.
- Come right on in.

444
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:28,793
- Hi.
- Hi.

445
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:31,172
Hazel, this is my daughter,
Claire.

446
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:34,379
Nice to meet you. Hey,
thanks for helping your dad out.

447
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:36,137
- He pays me in cookies.
- Oh.

448
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:38,482
A shrewd businesswoman.
I like it.

449
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,103
- She's cute.
- Yeah, she sure is.

450
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:45,631
Hope you don't mind her
hanging around here.

451
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:47,482
My mom wasn't able
to babysit this morning.

452
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:49,310
Oh, are you kidding? No problem.

453
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:51,275
I pretty much grew up
in this place.

454
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:52,562
Yeah, comes with the territory

455
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:55,034
of being a single dad.
Watch out.

456
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:57,620
Her mom lives in the city,
but we split custody.

457
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:59,758
Luckily, we're still
good friends.

458
00:26:59,862 --> 00:27:01,482
Mm.

459
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:06,241
Well, hey, listen, so I, um,
I did some initial designs.

460
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:08,931
They're still pretty rough,
but I thought I could show you,

461
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:10,965
and maybe
that might spark some ideas.

462
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:12,344
Okay.

463
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,517
Okay, so, um, this first one's

464
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,103
kind of this funky little house
and it has a river.

465
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:20,413
And I was thinking the river
could be made of frosting?

466
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:21,758
Mm-hmm.

467
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:25,862
Okay, well,
this next one is a castle

468
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:28,068
and, um,
it's got a moat around it,

469
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:29,482
which I thought was pretty cool.

470
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:30,793
Great.

471
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:34,034
- You're not even looking.
- I'm sorry.

472
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:37,482
I don't know if you realize, but
the bakery is open right now.

473
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:40,724
Um, a bakery
I'm actually running.

474
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:47,413
Whoa! Oh! That is the best
Danish I've ever had in my life.

475
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,379
Okay, let me get this straight,
so you have time to enjoy

476
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:55,068
your Danishes
and not look at my designs?

477
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:57,034
Look, if we're gonna
be teammates,

478
00:27:57,137 --> 00:27:58,689
we're gonna have to communicate.

479
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,872
You can't just show up here
unannounced and expect me

480
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,241
to give you my undivided
attention. I'm busy.

481
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:04,655
Oh, yeah.

482
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:07,724
- Let's see.
- Okay.

483
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:10,827
- So, um, yeah, it's...
- Wow.

484
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:14,241
That's amazing, actually.
L-let me see the first one.

485
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:17,310
So...

486
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:20,689
Obviously, you're an artist.
I could never do this.

487
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:24,034
Thanks. I can do better.

488
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,724
And, listen, I'm sorry,
you're right.

489
00:28:27,827 --> 00:28:29,620
I-I shouldn't have
just shown up here

490
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:31,827
without checking with you first.

491
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,275
Apology accepted.

492
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,551
Okay. Oh. Hey.

493
00:28:37,655 --> 00:28:40,172
Uh, before you go, they're doing
a little meet-and-greet thing

I know you have Claire and all...

In, as in, yeah, I'm in.
We're teammates. Let's do it.

Oh, okay.

Hey, is he always like this?

- Pretty much.
- Huh.

00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:05,206
- How's that cookie?
- It's good.

502
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,758

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,379
That only means
the competition this year

517
00:30:08,482 --> 00:30:10,758
is gonna be that much steeper.

518
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:14,000
Now, you'll be judged
in four categories.

519
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,103
Overall appearance, creativity,

520
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:19,379
difficulty, craftsmanship.

521
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,551
- So don't hold back!
- No...

522
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:24,931
Now, I know everybody has
a lot of hard work ahead of 'em,

523
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:27,344
so let's have some fun.
Enjoy yourselves, guys.

524
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,827
Whoo!

525
00:30:38,068 --> 00:30:39,517
All right,
where should we start?

526
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,379
Should we do some recon
or sow the seeds of sabotage?

527
00:30:42,482 --> 00:30:45,344
That's not a bad idea,
uh, the recon part.

528
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:47,551
- Sabotage is a terrible idea.
- Come on.

529
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:48,862
- Mark.
- Hi.

530
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:51,137
Oh, great.

531
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:52,379
What?

532
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:54,793
Do you see the woman in red
over there?

533
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,482
- Yeah.
- That's Shelby.

534
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:58,724
She and the woman next to her,
Rebecca,

535
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:01,068
own the bakery
across the street.

536
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:04,586
Well, well, well.
Maybe some sabotage is in order.

537
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:06,655
Can you please stop saying
sabotage?

538
00:31:06,758 --> 00:31:09,068
- I can try.
- I believe you know my aunt.

539
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:12,310
- Nina Marsden?
- Yes, of course!

540
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:15,206
I've had the pleasure of baking
beside her a few times.

541
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,000
I'll tell you what, if that kind
of talent runs in the family,

542
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:20,034
I can't wait to see
the gingerbread house

543
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:21,344
you come up with.

544
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:23,310
- Um, thank you.
- Good luck.

545
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:26,793
Ah, ah, ah...

546
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:29,586
Shelby also happens to be
my former best friend

547
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:32,241
from high school,
so that's a fun little twist.

548
00:31:32,344 --> 00:31:35,172
- Former?
- It's complicated.

549
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:41,034
Alan and Doug Jameson.
Oh, probably already knew that.

550
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:43,103
Oh, uh, I didn't know that.

551
00:31:43,206 --> 00:31:45,551
- Did you know that?
- I'm not f-familiar.

552
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,586
Well, anyway, nice to meet you.

553
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:51,172
It will be nice when you're
applauding our $100,000 win.

554
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:55,793
Are you related to Judy Stanley?

555
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:57,689
Yeah, yeah. I'm her daughter.

556
00:31:57,793 --> 00:32:00,137
I thought so.
You look just like her.

557
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:02,448
Your mom was an amazing baker.

558
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:04,591
She was so nice to me
when I was first starting out.

559
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,068
I'm really glad to hear that.

560
00:32:06,172 --> 00:32:08,379
Thank you for telling me.
It means a lot.

561
00:32:10,068 --> 00:32:11,793
Yeah, you should. Yeah.

562
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:16,310
- What...
- I-I don't know...

563
00:32:17,689 --> 00:32:19,551
They were certainly
an interesting pair.

564
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:21,275
- Uh-huh.
- Right.

565
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:23,275
- I'm Yasmin.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

566
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:25,482
I'm Hazel,
and this is my partner, James.

567
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:27,724
You two make
a very lovely couple.

568
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:29,758
- Oh! No, no, no, no.
- No! Not, not, uh...

569
00:32:29,862 --> 00:32:31,827
She meant baking partner,
for the competition.

570
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:34,620
- Not, uh...
- Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

571
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:36,068
I didn't mean to assume.

572
00:32:36,172 --> 00:32:38,137
My family just moved here
from Iran,

573
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:41,000
and things still get lost
in translation.

574
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:43,344
Oh, no, no, honest mistake.

575
00:32:43,448 --> 00:32:45,586
Um, so how are you finding
Chicago so far?

576
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:48,689
- Um, very cold.
- Yeah.

577
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:51,034
But, uh,
it's been really wonderful.

578
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:53,241
We don't celebrate Christmas,
but the lights

579
00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:55,103
and the decorations
are so beautiful.

580
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,551
Yeah. Do you have
any design ideas yet?

581
00:32:58,655 --> 00:33:01,172
There's a beautiful mosque
where we grew up

582
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:02,482
that is very dear to us.

583
00:33:02,586 --> 00:33:03,758
Oh, that's a lovely idea.

584
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:06,724
A gingerbread mosque?
I love that.

585
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:08,413
I can't imagine choosing
something else.

586
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:12,344
It's a place of joy
and community and faith.

587
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,586
From what I understand, that's
what Christmas is all about.

588
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:18,275
Um, how about you two?

589
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,000
- Oh, uh, well...
- Well...

590
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:22,482
We are still working on that.

591
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,413
Just pick a place
close to your heart,

592
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:26,310
and you can't go wrong.

593
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:27,931
Good luck.

594
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:30,517
She was sweet.

595
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:36,724
What are you cooking up
in there?

596
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:39,310
I was just thinking about
what Yasmin said.

597
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:41,310
I think I have an idea
for our design.

598
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:42,596
Do you wanna come check it out?

599
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,655
And leave me hangry here?

600
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:47,413
I mean, sure, we could stay
for the free appetizers,

601
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:50,310
or we could go get a jump
on the competition.

602
00:33:51,724 --> 00:33:53,551
- Okay, yeah.
- Yes.

603
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:00,551
So what do you think?

604
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:02,758
You wanna make City Hall?

605
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:05,793
Well, sure,
to you it's just City Hall,

606
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:08,310
but to me
it's someplace special.

607
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,482
My mom used to bring me here
when I was growing up.

608
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:13,965
It was designed
by Eleanor Jenkins in 1897,

609
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:17,000
one of the first
recognized female architects.

610
00:34:17,103 --> 00:34:19,448
And just look
at that clock tower.

611
00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:25,068
This building is the reason
why I wanted to be an architect.

612
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:29,068
So?

613
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:32,655
Well, a good design
takes a basic human need

614
00:34:32,758 --> 00:34:36,068
and turns it into a symbol
of passion and ingenuity.

615
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:40,655
I think it's perfect.

616
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:09,827
Well, I still need
to find a 3-D printer.

617
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:12,724
You know, I spent all morning
calling architecture firms

618
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:14,896
around Chicago,
I could not find one taker.

619
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,827
You know,
there's a small operation

620
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:18,896
in Oak Park you could try.

621
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,965
I think it's called
Lightbox M-Moder-Moderno.

622
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:25,172
- Lightbox Moderno.
- Okay. Thanks. I'll try 'em.

623
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:30,689
Did you, um, use
the ground cloves?

624
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:32,953
I thought we were supposed to be
working on our recipe.

625
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,793
Oh, and I have some designs
I wanna show you.

626
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:38,068
Look, I-I don't know how much
I can work on the competition

627
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:39,793
while also manning this bakery

628
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:43,379
and taking care of Claire
on my own.

629
00:35:43,482 --> 00:35:46,137
I totally respect that.

630
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:49,448
And I've actually been
thinking about this.

631
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:52,896
We have a little over a week
to go and so much to accomplish.

632
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,482
I-I'm sorry to say, but I think

633
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,482
we should close the bakery
for now.

634
00:35:57,586 --> 00:35:59,000
You wanna close the bakery now?

635
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:00,827
Dad, look around.

636
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:03,344
All of our foot traffic
is going to Shelby's bakery.

637
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:06,655
It's costing us more to make
things that nobody's buying.

638
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:10,241
Look, I know it doesn't feel
great to close the store,

639
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:12,655
especially at Christmas.

640
00:36:12,758 --> 00:36:15,068
But this is Hail Mary time,
okay?

641
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:18,551
One week of meager sales
is not gonna save the bakery.

642
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:20,758
But if by closing it
buys us time

643
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:23,724
to focus on something that can,

644
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:25,586
then I think we should.

645
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:29,896
Hazelnut Bakery closed
for the holidays.

646
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:37,448
As much as it pains me
to say it, you might as well.

647
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:41,103
I think you're right.

648
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:47,931
It'll be okay, dad. You'll see.

649
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:49,448
I hope you're right.

650
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:52,931
It was an interesting call
to receive.

651
00:36:53,034 --> 00:36:55,620
I've never heard
of anybody 3-D printing

652
00:36:55,724 --> 00:36:57,689
a model of a gingerbread house.

653
00:36:57,793 --> 00:37:01,862
Yeah, yeah. What can I say?
It's a life-goal met.

654
00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:03,931
No, it's a, it's actually
for a competition.

655
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:05,551
Oh. Mm.

656
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:08,275
Hey, these offices
are pretty great.

657
00:37:08,379 --> 00:37:09,448
Thank you.

658
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:10,831
How long have you guys
been here?

659
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,620
Actually, we just
got up and running,

660
00:37:12,724 --> 00:37:15,793
and, you know, we're still
pretty small, but hopefully,

661
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:18,448
my ambition
will soon outgrow the space.

662
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:20,896
- I'm sure it will.
- Oh, thanks.

663
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,655
Uh, printer's
right through there.

664
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:24,793
- Right.
- Just out of curiosity...

665
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:27,413
Could I check out
what you're making?

666
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:30,241
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, wow.

667
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:31,586
- City Hall.
- Yeah.

668
00:37:31,689 --> 00:37:34,862
- I love this building. Huh.
- Me, too.

669
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:37,310
- Hm.
- Designed by Eleanor Jenkins...

670
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:39,655
In 1897.

671
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,793
So I guess if I ever get
a call from a client

672
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:45,113
that's looking to build a house
in the woods made of candy,

673
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,389
you know, to capture children,
I'm gonna know who to call.

674
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:49,310
It's like fatten 'em up
and eat 'em, right?

675
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:52,448
- Whatever the client wants. Oh.
- Exactly.

676
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:54,286
Yeah, I'm sorry, that got weird.
I'll-I'll-I'll...

677
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,103
I'll go do my work now. Thank
you so much for the 3-D printer.

678
00:37:58,206 --> 00:37:59,379
Mm, mm.

679
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,448
Hey.

680
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,517
Oh, wow! Is that the, uh...

681
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:25,724
Well, that's amazing.

682
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:28,379
Huh. I'm impressed.

683
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:32,241
You're late.

684
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,079
Yeah, I was, I just
dropped off Claire at the pool

685
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,976
and ended up shooting some hoops
with some friends

686
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,310
and lost track of time.

687
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:39,862
You're late
because you were shooting hoops?

688
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:42,068
And lost track of time.

689
00:38:43,206 --> 00:38:45,172
Is that an apology?

690
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:48,103
I... Yes.

691
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:52,068
Where are you going?

692
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:54,206
Field trip. You coming?

693
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,310
Yeah, I guess so.

694
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:02,275
This kitchen is so cozy.

695
00:39:02,379 --> 00:39:04,620
Yeah, make yourself at home.

696
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:12,172
Chocolate syrup? No.

697
00:39:12,275 --> 00:39:14,827
No, that's gotta be wrong.
That would make the dough wet.

698
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:16,655
Well, not according to my mom.

699
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:19,448
Look, she says
don't add more than half a cup.

700
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:22,413
Who does this woman think
she is?

701
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:26,862
Okay, well, on that note,
field trip over.

702
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,896
We just got here.

703
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,275
Can't we have a cup of tea
or something?

704
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:32,689
Absolutely not. Come on.

705
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:34,793
Whoa, who made you boss?

706
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:36,275
Ah, you did, after you chose to

707
00:39:36,379 --> 00:39:37,899
shoot some three-pointers
this morning.

708
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:40,758
Oh, I-I didn't shoot
any three-pointers this morning.

709
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:43,310
Yeah, I did shoot
some hook shots, though.

710
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:45,172
Well, a hook shot.

711
00:39:45,275 --> 00:39:47,310
All right, take it easy,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

712
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:49,137
- Let's go.
- I wish.

713
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:51,896
We're gonna try my mom's recipe.

714
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:11,965
♪ Ah

715
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:18,137
- Should I turn it off?
- Yeah.

716
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:19,665
- Are you ready for this?
- Go for it.

717
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:20,965
Okay.

718
00:40:23,103 --> 00:40:24,655
This is eating chocolate.

719
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,275
A little bit of that cream.

720
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:34,586
Wonderful. Not bad.

721
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,137
It sticks together.

722
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:45,103
Yeah, but is it edible?
That's the question.

723
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:48,655
- Moment of truth.
- Here goes nothing.

724
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:54,724
- Mm. Wow. That's really good.
- Mm-hm-hm..

725
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,182
Yeah, your mom's recipe
was spot-on.

726
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,344
- Mm-hmm.
- Glad I thought of using it.

727
00:41:04,137 --> 00:41:06,724
Hey, what do you say we go grab
a hot-chocolate,

728
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:09,034
do some people-watching?

729
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:11,586
Yeah, that sounds really nice.

730
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:12,724
Great.

731
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:16,044
- Why are you staring at me?
- I'm not staring at you.

732
00:41:16,068 --> 00:41:19,379
I'm just eating my gingerbread
looking in your direction.

733
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:20,896
That's staring.

734
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:31,724
Oak Park is so beautiful
at Christmas.

735
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:33,310
What's it like being back?

736
00:41:33,413 --> 00:41:35,758
- It-it's nice.
- Mm.

737
00:41:35,862 --> 00:41:38,344
- And hard.
- Okay.

738
00:41:38,448 --> 00:41:41,103
The things I love the most
all remind me of my mom.

739
00:41:41,206 --> 00:41:44,551
- Mm.
- Sorry, sorry to be a downer.

740
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:46,815
No, not at all. You-you wear
your heart on your sleeve.

741
00:41:46,896 --> 00:41:49,379
- I really like it.
- Oh.

742
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:52,793
And how about you?

743
00:41:52,896 --> 00:41:55,344
Is Christmas hard without her?

744
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:56,793
It's a little strange.

745
00:41:56,896 --> 00:42:00,620
But I'm very grateful to be
spending it with Claire.

746
00:42:00,724 --> 00:42:02,034
Mm.

747
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:06,034
How long were you two together?

748
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:09,344
Or we could talk about
something else, like, um...

749
00:42:09,448 --> 00:42:11,689
What do you think the Bears'
post-season chances are?

750
00:42:11,793 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh, I-I only follow cricket.

751
00:42:15,103 --> 00:42:17,344
Yeah, really got into it
with your dad.

752
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:19,344
Oh. Um, I had no idea.

753
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:21,862
- D-do you understand the game?
- No, not a thing.

754
00:42:21,965 --> 00:42:23,413
I pretend really well.

755
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:26,596
You know, we got together
right after college.

756
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,655
We were still figuring out
who we were.

757
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:32,172
And she's a great woman,
but somewhere along the way

758
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:34,827
we just grew apart.

759
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:37,586
Mm, well, she probably
couldn't handle the fact

760
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,034
that you're a better baker.

761
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:43,275
Yeah. That was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

762
00:42:43,379 --> 00:42:45,862
No, we broke up
a couple of years ago.

763
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:48,965
I know two years
sounds like a long time...

764
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:50,931
No, it really doesn't.

765
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:53,344
But for whatever reason,
I haven't really wanted

766
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:57,655
to put myself
back out there yet.

767
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:06,655
♪ Joy to the world

768
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:10,965

- Good!

773
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:31,620
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

774
00:43:36,206 --> 00:43:38,896
- It's so cool!
- Isn't it?

775
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,172
Okay, architecture 101.

776
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:44,241
This first part of the wall
is called our cornerstone.

777
00:43:44,344 --> 00:43:46,310
And that sits on the foundation,
which helps

778
00:43:46,413 --> 00:43:48,655
evenly distribute the weight.

779
00:43:48,758 --> 00:43:50,379
Mm. How long do we have
to do this for?

780
00:43:50,482 --> 00:43:53,344
Um, only until tomorrow.

781
00:43:53,448 --> 00:43:57,344
I'm kidding, we just need to get
these guys to stick together,

782
00:43:57,448 --> 00:43:59,517
so they can stand up straight.

783
00:44:02,344 --> 00:44:04,206
My dad said
this was your mom's bakery?

784
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,137
Yup, she opened it
a few years after I was born.

785
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:10,413
- And named it after me.
- My mom lives in the city.

786
00:44:10,517 --> 00:44:12,424
Yeah, but you still see her
a lot, though, right?

787
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:14,586
Yeah, I split my time
between the two.

788
00:44:14,689 --> 00:44:16,068
I love Chicago time with my mom.

789
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:18,310
And then I come back
to Oak Park to chill.

790
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:21,000
Sounds like a pretty good setup.

791
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:24,517
I have a great mom and dad, even
if they're not together still.

792
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,206
I feel lucky.

793
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:30,068
Okay, that should do it.

794
00:44:30,172 --> 00:44:32,000
I think we can let go.

795
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,586
That went well.

796
00:44:37,034 --> 00:44:38,389
I just don't understand
what happened.

797
00:44:38,413 --> 00:44:40,827
I think, I think the sides
aren't straight,

798
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:43,206
so the edges aren't lining up.
I don't know.

799
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,310
Here, let me show you
how a real baker does it.

800
00:44:45,413 --> 00:44:48,103
- Follow me in the kitchen.
- This will be interesting.

801
00:44:48,206 --> 00:44:50,655
Watch and learn, ladies.
Watch and learn.

802
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:54,103
Ah.

803
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,793
- Yeah, that didn't work.
- No, it didn't.

804
00:45:05,896 --> 00:45:10,103
All right, I've gotta go to
the store, grab some cardamom.

805
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:11,793
We could go
to the Christmas market.

806
00:45:11,896 --> 00:45:13,793
Yeah, they sell
all kinds of stuff.

807
00:45:13,896 --> 00:45:16,000
No, um, I mean, if you want to.

808
00:45:16,103 --> 00:45:17,896
- In. Right, dad?
- Ah.

809
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,793
I've actually got a bunch
of things that I have to...

810
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:24,517
In. In.

811
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,965
- I'm out of here.
- Mm, all right.

812
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:32,724
Well, there she goes.

813
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:34,448
This orange roll is amazing.

814
00:45:34,551 --> 00:45:36,586
Oh, my gosh, it's so good.

815
00:45:36,689 --> 00:45:39,344
Mm, and this bourbon glaze
could give our windows

816
00:45:39,448 --> 00:45:40,448
a really nice sheen.

817
00:45:40,482 --> 00:45:42,896
- Mm, I'm into it.
- Okay.

818
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,793
- Speaking of windows...
- Mm-hmm?

819
00:45:44,896 --> 00:45:48,413
I did notice that a few of 'em
at the bakery need repair.

820
00:45:48,517 --> 00:45:51,310
Could you fix those with
your handy-dandy miter saw?

821
00:45:51,413 --> 00:45:54,620
Okay, look, you'd be surprised
how much a well-wielded

822
00:45:54,724 --> 00:45:56,620
miter saw can actually fix.

823
00:45:56,724 --> 00:45:58,275
I'm the problem
in that scenario.

824
00:45:58,379 --> 00:46:01,862
By the way, what's with that
mismatched tile at the bakery?

825
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:04,068
Oh, it's a long story,

826
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:07,068
but my mom did always say
that it reminded her

827
00:46:07,172 --> 00:46:10,379
that what's different about us
is also what makes us special.

828
00:46:10,482 --> 00:46:13,206
- Hm. That's nice.
- It's nice.

829
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,448
Oh! Hey, Yasmin!

830
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:17,137
Ah. Hazel! James!

831
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,793
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

832
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:20,517
Hey, how's the mosque
coming along?

833
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,896
Mostly good,
but with a few setbacks.

834
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,734
The qubba's trickier to build
than I thought.

835
00:46:24,758 --> 00:46:26,038
If it makes you feel any better,

836
00:46:26,103 --> 00:46:27,862
we have had a few setbacks
of our own.

837
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:29,000
- Yeah.
- Good.

838
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:30,551
I don't want to suffer alone.

839
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,241
Daddy, well, see this!

840
00:46:32,344 --> 00:46:33,734
I feel like
Claire is about to guilt me

841
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:35,182
into buying her something, I'll
be right

842
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:37,551
back. Let me go see
what trouble I'm in.

843
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:41,896
- He's cute.
- Oh, no, uh, no.

844
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,206
This is strictly professional.

845
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,103
Yeah, I don't think
he's really interested

846
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:48,275
in seeing anyone right now,
anyway.

847
00:46:48,379 --> 00:46:52,000
I-I mean, we aren't interested.
Yeah.

848
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:54,275
Plus, we live
in different cities.

849
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,482
Which is a moot point,
because there's absolutely

850
00:46:56,586 --> 00:46:59,517
nothing going on between us.

851
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,793
All I said was that he was cute.

852
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,172
Yeah.

853
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,896
Hey, I'll text you.

854
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,631
Rebecca, I'm at the cutest park
right now.

855
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:47,310
They have absolutely everything.
You would love it.

856
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:51,620
Ah, let me call you back.

857
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,586
Hazel.

858
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:01,137
Shelby.

859
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:04,000
I saw you at the MacKinley Hotel
the other night.

860
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:05,413
You didn't say hi.

861
00:48:05,517 --> 00:48:07,517
Oh, uh, yeah, that's 'cause
you were too busy

862
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,551
schmoozing with Mark Clemmons.

863
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:13,068
You really know how to just get
right in there, don't ya?

864
00:48:13,172 --> 00:48:15,379
I can't apologize
for what I did in high school

865
00:48:15,482 --> 00:48:17,896
for the rest of my life, Hazel.
You have to get over it.

866
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,517
Well, maybe
if you had apologized

867
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,620
for real for once, I would.

868
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:24,517
I have to get back to
the bakery and help out Rebecca.

869
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,931
- Right, the bakery.
- Excuse me.

870
00:48:28,034 --> 00:48:31,275
- Good luck in the competition.
- Thanks. You, too.

871
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,620
Hey, um...

872
00:48:35,655 --> 00:48:37,344
That looks good.

873
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:39,517
Thanks. I'm gettin' there.

874
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:41,517
How you doing?

875
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,551
Fine, I guess.

876
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:47,551
Just ran into Shelby
at the market.

877
00:48:47,655 --> 00:48:51,206
What's with you two? Seems like
she gets under your skin.

878
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,655
It's just stupid drama
from high school

879
00:48:53,758 --> 00:48:55,310
that we never worked through.

880
00:48:55,413 --> 00:48:57,344
Mm. You wanna talk about it?

881
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,620
Uh, yeah, okay, um...

882
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:05,517
Well, we were best friends
growing up.

883
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,241
The best of friends.

884
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,793
And then we sort of
fell into different cliques

885
00:49:09,896 --> 00:49:12,379
when we got into high school.

886
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,896
And then at prom,
she, um, stole my date.

887
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,379
- Brian Walker. Yeah.
- No way.

888
00:49:18,482 --> 00:49:21,758
The boy I'd been in love with
since fifth grade.

889
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:24,413
- Sounds dreamy.
- Oh, he was.

890
00:49:24,517 --> 00:49:27,068
- So dreamy.
- That's rough.

891
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,872
You never forget the day
that your best friend

892
00:49:28,896 --> 00:49:30,068
stabs you in the back.

893
00:49:30,172 --> 00:49:31,655
I bet. Well...

894
00:49:31,758 --> 00:49:34,198
I have something that might make
you feel a little bit better.

895
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:37,482
Absolutely destroying Shelby
in the competition?

896
00:49:37,586 --> 00:49:39,448
Yes. Also, come here.

897
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:41,068
Okay.

898
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:47,137
Ta-da! Now there's
two mismatched tiles.

899
00:49:47,241 --> 00:49:50,586
One from your mom
and one for you.

900
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:55,862
Wow.

901
00:49:56,931 --> 00:49:59,172
It's really special.

902
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:01,862
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

903
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:05,793
Now, shall we get
to that gingerbread?

904
00:50:05,896 --> 00:50:07,068
Let's.

905
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:14,655
Here, look, it's perfect.

906
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:17,379
Yeah. Better, better.

907
00:50:18,827 --> 00:50:22,379
- Mm, looks good.
- Yeah, it's the bottom edge.

908
00:50:22,482 --> 00:50:24,082
Yeah, bottom edge,
so let's mark it here.

909
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:30,103
Oh, wow.

910
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:34,517
- There you go.
- Beautiful.

911
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:06,034
Oh, wow. Oh, thank you.

912
00:51:13,758 --> 00:51:16,862
- Hold on, what's the joke?
- Don't worry about it.

913
00:51:24,137 --> 00:51:25,620
Oh, yes.

914
00:51:27,655 --> 00:51:29,000
Great.

915
00:51:42,275 --> 00:51:43,275
♪ Hey

916
00:51:43,379 --> 00:51:44,655
Gorgeous.

917
00:51:48,655 --> 00:51:50,758
- Easy.
- Yup.

918
00:51:50,862 --> 00:51:52,310
I got it.

919
00:51:56,758 --> 00:51:59,137
Yes! Look at that!

920
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:05,137
We did it. It looks amazing.

921
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:07,482
Yeah, and thanks to
James, not only is it sturdy...

922
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,793
- It tastes delicious.
- Do we get to eat it afterwards?

923
00:52:09,896 --> 00:52:11,689
- Mm-hmm.
- Listen, seriously, Hazel.

924
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:14,010
I've baked a few things in my
life, nothing compares to this.

925
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:15,896
- This is you.
- Oh, come on, I mean...

926
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,960
Without your help,
it wouldn't taste half as good.

927
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,586
It is your architectural skill
that brought this to life.

928
00:52:20,689 --> 00:52:22,379
- There's no question.
- Well, thank you.

929
00:52:22,482 --> 00:52:23,872
But I couldn't have done it
without you.

930
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:26,206
I'm only happy
when you're in the room.

931
00:52:31,379 --> 00:52:33,172
Hey, what do you guys think
about maybe doing

932
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,413
a little more work
on the clock tower?

933
00:52:35,517 --> 00:52:38,620
I'd really love it if the hands
of the clock move somehow.

934
00:52:38,724 --> 00:52:40,344
- That'd be so cool!
- I think so, too.

935
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,034
- And probably impossible.
- Oh, come on.

936
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:46,517
I wouldn't touch it.
It's perfect.

937
00:52:47,827 --> 00:52:49,103
Hazel...

938
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,482
Okay, fine,
we'll leave it alone.

939
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:56,458
How about we get
some hot chocolate to celebrate?

940
00:52:56,482 --> 00:52:59,344
- Yeah!
- That's a great idea.

941
00:53:07,724 --> 00:53:09,448
Your mother would be so proud.

942
00:53:09,551 --> 00:53:13,517
Well, she was proud anyway,
but seeing you bake like that...

943
00:53:15,517 --> 00:53:17,724
We can't lose this place, dad.

944
00:53:56,724 --> 00:54:00,413
- Hello?
- Hazel, it's Daryl Baxter.

945
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:03,000
Oh, uh, hi, sir, I-I'm sorry,

946
00:54:03,103 --> 00:54:06,275
you just caught me off-guard
there for a second.

947
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:08,179
I'll bet you're wondering
why I'm calling you,

948
00:54:08,206 --> 00:54:11,310
and, uh, so close to Christmas,
no less.

949
00:54:11,413 --> 00:54:13,862
Uh, yeah,
I'd be lying if I said no.

950
00:54:13,965 --> 00:54:15,862
Well, let me cut to the chase.

951
00:54:15,965 --> 00:54:19,137
I wanna be this kind of dude
who owns up to his mistakes.

952
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:22,620
And, uh, well, I made a big one.

953
00:54:22,724 --> 00:54:26,241
I had two consultants to choose
from, and I chose wrong.

954
00:54:26,344 --> 00:54:27,551
- You did?
- Ah.

955
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:30,517
Ben-uh-jamin
didn't quite work out.

956
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,286
Dropped the ball
with one of our biggest clients

957
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,000
and cost us the account.

958
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:36,206
Needless to say,
his position has opened up.

959
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:39,000
How would you like to start as
a full-time architect at Bloom

960
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,862
in the new year?

961
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,172
Did I lose you?

962
00:54:46,275 --> 00:54:48,206
Uh, n-n-no. So-sorry, I'm here.

963
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:52,172
I... You want me
to work at Bloom?

964
00:54:52,275 --> 00:54:53,965
Yuppers.

965
00:54:54,068 --> 00:54:57,344
Wow. I...
I don't really know what to say.

966
00:54:57,448 --> 00:55:00,172
It's always been my dream
to work there.

967
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:02,379
So is that a yupper?

968
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:05,655
Um, I am, of course, overjoyed
at the offer.

969
00:55:05,758 --> 00:55:08,517
It's just, it's just a lot
to take in right now.

970
00:55:10,344 --> 00:55:11,896
I can appreciate that.

971
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,724
Um, probably not the call
you were expecting.

972
00:55:17,137 --> 00:55:19,655
Do you wanna sleep on it?

973
00:55:19,758 --> 00:55:22,379
I thought I didn't work well
with others.

974
00:55:22,482 --> 00:55:23,793
Did I say that?

975
00:55:23,896 --> 00:55:25,172
You did.

976
00:55:25,275 --> 00:55:28,206
Yeah. Hazel, you're who we want.

977
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,862
But we need to fill
this position,

978
00:55:29,965 --> 00:55:31,827
so we can't hang around forever.

979
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:34,034
I understand,
and I promise to let you know

980
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:35,517
in a couple of days.

981
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:39,206
I just have something back home
that I need to finish.

982
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,068
Make sure I leave things
in good hands.

983
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:43,931
All right. All right, I guess.

984
00:55:44,034 --> 00:55:46,724
Um, give me a call
when you've decided.

985
00:55:46,827 --> 00:55:49,206
And, um, look forward
to hearing from you.

986
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,724
I will. A-and thank you, sir.

987
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,103
Hi.

988
00:56:14,931 --> 00:56:17,517
I thought we agreed
you were gonna leave it.

989
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:21,068
Um, yeah, uh, there's been
a slight change of plans.

990
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:24,275
I spent all day trying to figure
out how to make the clock move.

991
00:56:24,379 --> 00:56:26,724
Now, I know we can't make it
actually function,

992
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:31,000
but if I could just get
the hands to spin, that's...

993
00:56:31,103 --> 00:56:33,655
Hey, did-did something happen
since I last saw you?

994
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:36,482
- Y-y-you seem a little...
- Stressed?

995
00:56:36,586 --> 00:56:39,000
Uh, yeah, I was gonna say manic.

996
00:56:39,103 --> 00:56:41,482
Huh.

997
00:56:41,586 --> 00:56:45,241
Okay, look, I have a life
to get back to in New York.

998
00:56:45,344 --> 00:56:48,172
The job of my dreams
is waiting for me.

999
00:56:48,275 --> 00:56:52,482
And I can't go anywhere until
I am sure the bakery is safe.

1000
00:56:52,586 --> 00:56:56,655
My mother's legacy is at stake
here. Do you understand that?

1001
00:56:56,758 --> 00:56:57,758
- Yeah.
- Great.

1002
00:56:57,862 --> 00:57:00,862
But, um, we're also a team,

1003
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:03,379
and that means

1004
00:57:03,482 --> 00:57:06,034
communicating things
to each other.

1005
00:57:06,137 --> 00:57:09,103
Hey, at the end of the day,
if it doesn't work out,

1006
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:11,379
it's just a contest.

1007
00:57:11,482 --> 00:57:14,586
- "It's just a contest?"
- Mm-hmm.

1008
00:57:16,034 --> 00:57:18,379
Well, clearly,
this is far more important to me

1009
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:20,827
than it is to you, and I really
wish I had known that...

1010
00:57:20,931 --> 00:57:22,793
- Hazel!
- No, just...

1011
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:29,793
No, no, no, no, no.

1012
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:31,379
Oh...

1013
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:34,896
- Oh, my God.
- Um, we'll fix it.

1014
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,931
What do you mean fix it?
It's ruined!

1015
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:40,793
It took us a week to build this,
and-and now the contest

1016
00:57:40,896 --> 00:57:42,724
is tomorrow, there is no fix it!

1017
00:57:42,827 --> 00:57:45,206
- Just let me help you...
- No, you wanna help?

1018
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:46,896
Just leave.

1019
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,034
- What?
- Please, just-just go.

1020
00:57:59,034 --> 00:58:00,206
Oh...

1021
00:58:00,931 --> 00:58:02,103
No...

1022
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:10,551
Mind if I come in?

1023
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:12,862
Enter at your own risk.

1024
00:58:17,655 --> 00:58:21,034
James filled me in.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

1025
00:58:21,137 --> 00:58:22,551
Yeah, me too.

1026
00:58:22,655 --> 00:58:25,413
Now because of me,

1027
00:58:25,517 --> 00:58:27,172
the bakery is gonna close.

1028
00:58:27,275 --> 00:58:30,034
Don't you think that
for one second.

1029
00:58:30,137 --> 00:58:32,689
It's my fault
the bakery's on its last legs.

1030
00:58:32,793 --> 00:58:34,273
I'm the one
who let it start slipping.

1031
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,034
I'm the one
who didn't ask for help.

1032
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,137
Hey, dad, come on.

1033
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:40,965
- You were grieving.
- Well...

1034
00:58:41,068 --> 00:58:44,034
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1035
00:58:44,137 --> 00:58:47,379
And at least you were here,
doing your best. Where was I?

1036
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:52,241
I was across the country, just
letting you carry all of this?

1037
00:58:52,344 --> 00:58:54,068
But you're here now.

1038
00:58:55,655 --> 00:58:56,724
Right.

1039
00:58:57,689 --> 00:59:00,103
It's just a store.

1040
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:02,275
We'll always have our memories.

1041
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,137
Do you remember when, um,

1042
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:08,862
you and mom
would dance to Motown

1043
00:59:08,965 --> 00:59:11,137
after you closed up the shop?

1044
00:59:11,241 --> 00:59:13,355
Yeah, you-you guys thought
I was sleeping in the back,

1045
00:59:13,379 --> 00:59:15,655
but I would, uh,
I would watch you.

1046
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,344
- You did?
- Yeah.

1047
00:59:19,586 --> 00:59:21,137
Well...

1048
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:23,379
I'm just scared that

1049
00:59:23,482 --> 00:59:26,137
if we lose the bakery,

1050
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:29,172
that last little piece of mom
I have still standing

1051
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:31,206
is just gonna disappear.

1052
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:35,379
Hazel, don't you worry
about your mom disappearing.

1053
00:59:35,482 --> 00:59:38,655
She's gonna be with us
for the rest of our lives,

1054
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:41,103
bakery or not, hm.

1055
00:59:42,172 --> 00:59:43,172
Yeah.

1056
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:45,379
Oh.

1057
00:59:47,724 --> 00:59:50,310
- I love you, dad.
- I love you, too.

1058
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,862
And you didn't even get a photo
of your City Hall?

1059
00:59:56,965 --> 00:59:59,137
Uh, no.

1060
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:03,275
You always take a photo
when you make something pretty.

1061
01:00:03,379 --> 01:00:06,241
Hey. Come on.

1062
01:00:08,862 --> 01:00:10,758
As your mom would always say,

1063
01:00:10,862 --> 01:00:12,448
"There's no problem too big

1064
01:00:12,551 --> 01:00:13,831
that can't be solved with cake."

1065
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:15,965
Mm.

1066
01:00:16,068 --> 01:00:19,172
This is so delicious.
Is this a new recipe?

1067
01:00:23,137 --> 01:00:24,586
She made this?

1068
01:00:24,689 --> 01:00:27,034
If by she you mean Shelby,
then, yes.

1069
01:00:27,137 --> 01:00:30,241
I cannot believe that you
tricked me into eating something

1070
01:00:30,344 --> 01:00:32,517
from Hazelnut's
biggest competitor!

1071
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,424
Look, if you girls can't eat
each other's baking,

1072
01:00:34,448 --> 01:00:36,000
then I feel sorry
for the both of you.

1073
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:38,241
Hey, fair.

1074
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:40,724
So, uh, you sure
there's nothing to be done

1075
01:00:40,827 --> 01:00:43,275
about that clock tower
inside there?

1076
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,310
- It's in pieces.
- Mm.

1077
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:48,689
And I'd have to do it by myself.

1078
01:00:48,793 --> 01:00:50,000
James, uh...

1079
01:00:50,103 --> 01:00:52,241
Well, let's just say
we're not exactly

1080
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:54,482
on speaking terms right now.

1081
01:00:54,586 --> 01:00:58,586
You know,
if you really did need help,

1082
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:01,344
we both know someone
who's available.

1083
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,620
I don't understand
what this has to do with me.

1084
01:01:13,724 --> 01:01:15,931
Don't look at me,
this was your aunt's idea.

1085
01:01:16,034 --> 01:01:18,034
Okay, listen, I figured,
since you and Rebecca

1086
01:01:18,137 --> 01:01:20,620
had already finished,
that maybe you could

1087
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:23,310
help Hazel salvage hers.

1088
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,758
Why would I help her?

1089
01:01:24,862 --> 01:01:26,862
My biggest competition dropping
out only helps us.

1090
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:29,000
All right,
competition is a good thing.

1091
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:30,827
It keeps you on your toes.

1092
01:01:30,931 --> 01:01:34,137
Besides, Oak Park is big enough
for two bakeries.

1093
01:01:34,241 --> 01:01:37,206
Nina, I know your heart
is in the right place,

1094
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:39,310
but clearly,
this is not the answer.

1095
01:01:39,413 --> 01:01:41,838
Well, sure it is, if you just
stop being a couple of pinheads.

1096
01:01:41,862 --> 01:01:44,655
- Oh, I'm not being...
- Okay, come on, you girls.

1097
01:01:44,758 --> 01:01:47,206
Come on. You were best friends.

1098
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:50,793
And that is a luxury
because, as we all know,

1099
01:01:50,896 --> 01:01:53,448
my best friend
is no longer with us.

1100
01:01:55,172 --> 01:01:58,103
If that's not good enough
a reason, then how about this?

1101
01:01:58,206 --> 01:02:00,551
I helped you and Rebecca
open up that bakery

1102
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:03,517
and I didn't ask for a dime
in return.

1103
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,931
So guess what?

1104
01:02:05,034 --> 01:02:08,862
Now I have a cost,
and this is my fee.

1105
01:02:13,241 --> 01:02:16,000
Fine, but I'm doing it for you.

1106
01:02:16,103 --> 01:02:18,793
- Not her.
- Mm-hmm, okay.

1107
01:02:18,896 --> 01:02:20,103
Now, the contest is tomorrow,

1108
01:02:20,206 --> 01:02:23,172
so you girls have
all night to work.

1109
01:02:23,931 --> 01:02:25,758
Hazel...

1110
01:02:25,862 --> 01:02:29,379
You have never been a quitter,
so don't start now.

1111
01:02:34,344 --> 01:02:37,206
The sooner we start,
the sooner this can be over.

1112
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:38,482
Let's go.

1113
01:02:42,724 --> 01:02:44,517
This is the recipe you're using?

1114
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,448
Yeah, yeah, my partner...

1115
01:02:46,551 --> 01:02:49,344
Well, my ex-partner, James,
came up with it.

1116
01:02:49,448 --> 01:02:52,379
It's a variation
of my mom's recipe.

1117
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:55,862
- James knows what he's doing.
- Yeah. Yeah, he does.

1118
01:02:57,896 --> 01:03:01,862
So are you gonna
start helping, or...

1119
01:03:01,965 --> 01:03:03,206
Yeah.

1120
01:03:13,034 --> 01:03:15,310
You know,
despite what you may think,

1121
01:03:15,413 --> 01:03:17,413
I have no desire
to see this bakery closed.

1122
01:03:17,517 --> 01:03:19,862
- Mm.
- I'm serious.

1123
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:22,206
T-this place is an institution.

1124
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,379
I used to love hanging out here
with your mom.

1125
01:03:24,482 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah, those are some
of my favorite memories, too.

1126
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:30,896
Hey, hey, careful.

1127
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:41,206
Look, we might as well at least
try to talk about what happened.

1128
01:03:43,034 --> 01:03:45,655
So, where do we start?

1129
01:03:49,689 --> 01:03:52,655
I just don't understand why.

1130
01:03:52,758 --> 01:03:54,448
We used to be best friends,
and then...

1131
01:03:54,551 --> 01:03:56,034
It wasn't malicious, Hazel.

1132
01:03:56,137 --> 01:03:59,551
We just started hanging out
with different people.

1133
01:03:59,655 --> 01:04:02,068
You had your own friend group
that I wasn't a part of.

1134
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,517
Yeah, they used to be
your friend group.

1135
01:04:05,896 --> 01:04:09,034
People change.
It was high school.

1136
01:04:10,103 --> 01:04:12,379
Yeah, fine.

1137
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:15,724
But it's like I didn't even
exist to you anymore.

1138
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,482
I had my own secret
about who I was,

1139
01:04:25,586 --> 01:04:28,275
and hanging
with the popular kids

1140
01:04:28,379 --> 01:04:31,137
seemed like the best way
to hide it.

1141
01:04:31,241 --> 01:04:34,379
Okay, fair enough.
But what about prom?

1142
01:04:34,482 --> 01:04:36,758
I mean, you stole my date.

1143
01:04:38,517 --> 01:04:40,586
Here's what happened. Okay.

1144
01:04:40,689 --> 01:04:43,068
So I'm at prom, and Brian Walker

1145
01:04:43,172 --> 01:04:46,068
asked me to dance with him.

1146
01:04:46,172 --> 01:04:48,344
- He's the hottest guy at school.
- Oh, I remember.

1147
01:04:48,448 --> 01:04:51,931
- Yeah. The beaver swoop. Yeah.
- The beaver swoop.

1148
01:04:55,137 --> 01:04:58,758
Um, so everyone's looking at me,

1149
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:03,379
and it felt weird if I said no

1150
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:06,448
because I wanted everyone
to think I was straight.

1151
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:13,206
Honestly, I had eyes
for Kim Wescott the whole night.

1152
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,827
She was killing it
in that strapless dress.

1153
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:19,517
Oh, she was, wasn't she?
Man, that collar bone, right?

1154
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:20,931
Right.

1155
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,586
Brian Walker really
didn't have much going for him

1156
01:05:24,689 --> 01:05:27,310
aside from those
dreamy good looks, did he?

1157
01:05:27,413 --> 01:05:30,793
Well, he did ditch the coolest
girl in school on prom night.

1158
01:05:30,896 --> 01:05:34,137
So, yeah.
I'd have to agree with you.

1159
01:05:35,482 --> 01:05:38,655
But it wasn't right for
me to dance with him.

1160
01:05:38,758 --> 01:05:40,448
And I'm sorry.

1161
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,517
- Well, look at that.
- Hm?

1162
01:05:51,482 --> 01:05:55,000
Do you remember how Mr. Scarderi
would freak out

1163
01:05:55,103 --> 01:05:56,793
over our overdue library books?

1164
01:05:56,896 --> 01:05:58,965
Yes, and then after
he cooled down, he'd be like...

1165
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:03,034
"Hey, girls, you reading
anything stimulating?"

1166
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:11,172
Oh...

1167
01:06:12,931 --> 01:06:15,689
We shouldn't have waited
this long to talk.

1168
01:06:15,793 --> 01:06:19,068
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

1169
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:21,689
I forgot how fun it was
just hanging out.

1170
01:06:21,793 --> 01:06:22,862
Mm.

1171
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:29,379
I really am sorry, though,

1172
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:31,586
about everything.

1173
01:06:31,689 --> 01:06:34,413
I should've called you
after your mom passed.

1174
01:06:34,517 --> 01:06:36,793
I wanted to,
but it had been so long.

1175
01:06:36,896 --> 01:06:40,034
And-and I know
that's not an excuse.

1176
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,655
I-I can't make that up to you.

1177
01:06:44,655 --> 01:06:46,206
You're here now.

1178
01:06:52,517 --> 01:06:55,379
You know, I have to say,
under the circumstances...

1179
01:06:56,275 --> 01:06:57,448
it came out okay.

1180
01:06:57,551 --> 01:06:59,000
Yeah, I just

1181
01:06:59,103 --> 01:07:02,758
wish we had more time.
We could've really crushed it.

1182
01:07:02,862 --> 01:07:05,758
- We did the best we could.
- Yeah.

1183
01:07:05,862 --> 01:07:09,000
I might add
some more Christmas decorations.

1184
01:07:21,758 --> 01:07:23,448
- Just these.
- Pick one.

1185
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:26,793
Hey, it's
James. Please leave a message.

1186
01:07:26,896 --> 01:07:30,241
Hi. Hi, James,
it's, uh, it's me.

1187
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:32,862
Um...

1188
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:37,344
I just wanted to say
I'm, I'm really sorry.

1189
01:07:37,448 --> 01:07:40,965
I'd really love to see you
at the competition today.

1190
01:07:41,068 --> 01:07:42,896
You're not gonna believe
what happened,

1191
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,310
and I am dying to show you.

1192
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,413
Also, I just really wanna talk.

1193
01:07:50,758 --> 01:07:54,689
Anyway, um, I hope

I put myself out there, um...

1282
01:12:54,931 --> 01:12:57,379
- And that was scary for me.
- I know.

1283
01:12:57,482 --> 01:13:00,827
But I-I realize that I actually

1284

who may not be aware,

Hazel's mom, Judy, was a legend
here at Christmas Bakeoff.

Now, before I announce

1312
01:15:53,862 --> 01:15:56,620
would anyone like to say
anything about their experience?

1313
01:16:01,931 --> 01:16:04,206
Um, I'd like to say something.

1314
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,827
Wonderful!

1315
01:16:06,931 --> 01:16:07,965
Oh.

1316
01:16:10,448 --> 01:16:12,517
Um, hi, everyone.

1317
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:14,241
I'm, I'm Hazel.

1318
01:16:15,586 --> 01:16:20,241
This piece is a tribute
to my mom, Judy Stanley.

1319
01:16:20,344 --> 01:16:23,137
She was an incredible baker

1320
01:16:23,241 --> 01:16:25,689
and a wonderful mom.

1321
01:16:25,793 --> 01:16:27,275
And she taught me that

1322
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:30,758
with the right combination
of ingredients,

1323
01:16:30,862 --> 01:16:33,758
you can create anything.

1324
01:16:33,862 --> 01:16:38,172
But somewhere along the way,
I forgot that,

1325
01:16:38,275 --> 01:16:41,586
and I thought
I could do everything on my own.

1326
01:16:42,793 --> 01:16:45,724
And in the process,
I made people feel

1327
01:16:45,827 --> 01:16:48,793
like they were less special
to me than they really are.

1328
01:16:50,137 --> 01:16:51,689
And, um...

1329
01:16:52,724 --> 01:16:54,827
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

1330
01:16:59,689 --> 01:17:01,413
Thank you.

1331
01:17:12,103 --> 01:17:15,344

to send you back home with.

1337
01:18:05,413 --> 01:18:07,448
I'm not going back to New York.

1338
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:11,862
What do, what do you mean?
What about your dream job?

1339
01:18:11,965 --> 01:18:15,103
I think I can realize
my dream here.

1340
01:18:15,206 --> 01:18:17,344
This is where I wanna be.

1341
01:18:17,448 --> 01:18:19,310
And I'm not trying to put
any pressure on you

1342
01:18:19,413 --> 01:18:20,724
or be presumptuous.

1343
01:18:20,827 --> 01:18:24,620
I know
I have some things to work on.

1344
01:18:24,724 --> 01:18:26,827
And you have Claire
and the bakery,

1345
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:28,551
and you probably need time...

1346
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:40,068
I don't need time.

1347
01:18:48,137 --> 01:18:50,448
I'm gonna go see Claire.

1348
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:58,137
- I just..
- Gosh, ladies, it's incredible!

1349
01:18:58,241 --> 01:19:00,931
- Do you like it? Thank you.
- Wow.

1350
01:19:01,034 --> 01:19:03,482
You all should be really proud.
That was not easy.

1351
01:19:03,586 --> 01:19:05,827
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1352
01:19:05,931 --> 01:19:08,000
You know, Shelby,
I was talking to your Aunt Nina,

1353
01:19:08,103 --> 01:19:09,724
and she was telling me
about your store.

1354
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:12,517
And yours, too, Hazel.

1355
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,931
So Yasmin's gonna be on my show
in a few days,

1356
01:19:15,034 --> 01:19:18,103
and I feel like
you guys should join her.

1357
01:19:18,206 --> 01:19:19,793
You know, two rival bakeries

1358
01:19:19,896 --> 01:19:22,413
across the street
from each other.

1359
01:19:22,517 --> 01:19:25,137
One's doing
traditional confections,

1360
01:19:25,241 --> 01:19:27,758
the other one's kind of
baking with the trends.

1361
01:19:27,862 --> 01:19:29,689
I feel like
it's a pretty cool story.

01:19:29,793 --> 01:19:32,689
I'd... We'd be open to that.

1363
01:19:32,793 --> 01:19:35,344
You know what? Me, too.

1364
01:19:35,448 --> 01:19:37,527
Awesome. Well, listen, I'll have
my people reach out.

1365
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:39,655
But seriously,
amazing job today.

1366
01:19:39,758 --> 01:19:42,034
- Thank you so much. Thanks.
- Congratulations.

1367
01:19:44,241 --> 01:19:47,586
I guess the rivalry is back on.

1368
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:49,241
- Bring it.
- Mm.

Hey, guys.
Tough break on the contest.

1372
01:20:06,103 --> 01:20:08,068
I know you poured your heart
into it.

1373
01:20:08,172 --> 01:20:09,275
- It's okay.
- You know...

1374
01:20:09,379 --> 01:20:11,482
I have a proposition for you.

1375
01:20:11,586 --> 01:20:13,758
Nina, I appreciate it,

1376
01:20:13,862 --> 01:20:15,931
but I am not taking your money.

1377
01:20:16,034 --> 01:20:18,103
Listen, I was talking
with my publisher today

1378
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:20,862
and I mentioned this idea
for a new cookbook,

1379
01:20:20,965 --> 01:20:22,965
featuring the recipes
from a star baker

1380
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:25,724
by the name of Judy Stanley.

1381
01:20:25,827 --> 01:20:29,344
Now, I figured, maybe her
daughter and her baking partner

1382
01:20:29,448 --> 01:20:31,379
could write it together,
seeing how

1383
01:20:31,482 --> 01:20:34,758
they're semifinalists
in a national competition.

1384
01:20:34,862 --> 01:20:37,689
- Mm, wow, uh...
- Oh! That's not it.

1385
01:20:37,793 --> 01:20:40,206
I also negotiated
a really nice advance.

1386
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:44,068
- What? Okay.
- If you're interested.

1387
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,448
I just figured it could help
the bakery stay afloat

1388
01:20:46,551 --> 01:20:48,965
until the new customers
start comin' in,

1389
01:20:49,068 --> 01:20:51,103
which I suspect
will be very soon.

1390
01:20:51,206 --> 01:20:53,620
Nina. Nina, Nina, Nina.

1391
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:54,896
Wow.

1392
01:20:56,206 --> 01:20:58,586
So, what do you say?

1393
01:21:02,931 --> 01:21:05,310
I say you have yourself a deal.

1394
01:21:05,413 --> 01:21:08,241
Ah. That's what I like to hear.

1395
01:21:13,275 --> 01:21:17,862
Architects don't usually
turn down companies like Bloom.

1396
01:21:17,965 --> 01:21:22,172
Why did you turn them down,
if you don't mind me asking?

1397
01:21:22,275 --> 01:21:25,551
- They can't give me what I want.
- Which is?

1398
01:21:27,103 --> 01:21:31,379
To be here with the people
who are important to me.

1399
01:21:31,482 --> 01:21:33,965
And besides, they already
made it very clear before

1400
01:21:34,068 --> 01:21:36,310
that I am not the right fit.

1401
01:21:36,413 --> 01:21:37,862
And you know what?
They're right.

1402
01:21:37,965 --> 01:21:42,931
I belong at an innovative
woman-led company.

1403
01:21:43,034 --> 01:21:47,275
You know, I wouldn't be able
to match what Bloom's offering.

1404
01:21:47,379 --> 01:21:48,758
That's okay.

1405
01:21:50,241 --> 01:21:53,620
All right. Welcome aboard.
