1
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,984
What the hell were you thinking,
taking her that way?

2
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,755
Annie wanted
What's this "Annie wanted"?

3
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,524
Annie can't talk or think.
She can! lf you looked, you'd know.

4
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,361
Please! She's all right.
Can't you just stop it?

5
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,025
What? You know she's all right?
What if the damn dog was rabid?

6
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,693
It wasn't. Mrs. Stanton told me.
And you believe her? Just like that?

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,567
That woman's an idiot! A careless
idiot. Anyone can say anything, Sissy.

8
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,866
Maybe someday you'll learn that.

9
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,930
I saw the dog tag.
Why do you treat me like a fool?

10
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,134
Stop it, can't you? Both of you.
She'll hear. Do you wanna upset her?

11
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,905
Come on, honey. Give me a break.
You might as well....

12
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:50,916
Come on, guys!

13
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,047
Wait up!

14
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,387
I figured you could use something
stronger. I know I could.

15
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,483
Down the hatch, come on.

16
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,497
It's quick, isn't it? What they do.
And it doesn't hurt them?

17
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,696
It's quick, it doesn't hurt.
They just go to sleep.

18
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,036
Come on, drink your drink.

19
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:46,101
You and I know Buddy never bit anybody
before in his life. It was her.

20
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,773
He sensed something in her.

21
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:53,785
Annie, please open the door.

22
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:59,824
Annie, open this door now!

23
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,519
Drink, you'll feel better.

24
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,622
There's something wrong with her.
I don't just mean that she's autistic.

25
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,896
Please open the door!

26
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,906
Turn the music down!
Somebody'll call the damn cops!

27
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,946
There's something about her
that's wrong.

28
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,508
And Buddy sensed it.

29
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,444
Dogs know. Oh, you bet.

30
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,490
Did you hear that?

31
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,152
Music. Someone has it
really cranked out there.

32
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,028
What the hell ?
It's an earthquake!

33
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,861
It's not coming from the ground.

34
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,730
Come on! Run! Run!

35
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,633
Come on! Come on!

36
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:49,641
Please open the door!
Now, Annie!

37
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,673
Come on, hurry! Hurry!

38
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,143
What's happening?
I don't know!

39
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:58,149
Annie, let us in! Annie!

40
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,283
Annie, please, open the door!

41
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,292
IKill it, Sissy!
Just what the hell are you doing?

42
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,319
What the hell ?

43
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:16,334
Sister, look at this.

44
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,595
Sister, I got baby.

45
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,038
Yes, I know.

46
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:27,045
Annie...

47
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,640
...what have you done?

48
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,174
That concludes this year's course in
the psychology of the unseen world.

49
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,747
I'd like to leave you
with three thoughts if I may.

50
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,484
First, the investigation of psychic
phenomena is an honorable pursuit...

51
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,719
...in spite of
its tattered reputation.

52
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:45,730
The second is that reality
is not always quantifiable.

53
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,731
Our inability to count, weigh, sort
or photograph some things...

54
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,605
...does not mean
those things are nonexistent.

55
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,577
Third and most important...

56
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:04,582
...next week's exam will not
be graded on the curve.

57
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,442
Seriously, I thank you all
for your attention...

58
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,457
...and to remind you of what
someone famous once said:

59
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,918
"The truth is out there."
Enjoy your summer.

60
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,932
Professor Reardon, a question, please.

61
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:34,145
Question.

62
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,643
Your question?

63
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,550
Rumor says you're investigating
Rose Red, the Rimbauer mansion...

64
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,383
...a psychic field trip.
Is that true?

65
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,286
You are...?
IKevin Bollinger, class of '03.

66
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,417
I don't recognize you. Is it
because the group is large...

67
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,755
...or is this your first visit
to our happy family?

68
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:53,765
I'm a reporter for our newspaper.
Oh, my sympathies, Mr. Bollinger.

69
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:04,809
Is it true and if so, do you plan
on using departmental funds...

70
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:11,950
...or college general funds
to finance your latest spook hunt?

71
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:17,689
As any regular attendee
of these classes will tell you...

72
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,518
...l am extremely interested in
Rose Red. Talk about it all the time.

73
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,822
Have a picture of it on my office
wall. And one of Ellen Rimbauer.

74
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,955
But as Professor Miller can tell you,
I've filed no request for funds...

75
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,058
...to underwrite
what you term a "spook hunt."

76
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,466
If you feel like asking him
to confirm that, he's up there.

77
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,061
A question, Mr. Bollinger.
Did Professor Miller suggest...

78
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,266
...you stop by my class for your
question instead of my office...

79
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,744
...like a normal reporter?

80
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,177
Never mind. Let's consider
the issue closed, shall we?

81
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,114
You never answered my question
Thank you.

82
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,378
Exam next Tuesday at 2:00.
I'll see you then.

83
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:51,389
If I embarrassed you,
Professor Reardon, I am sorry.

84
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:56,728
Don't believe it, Mr. Bollinger.

85
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:04,102
Carl Miller wound you up. It was
his intention that I be embarrassed.

86
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,707
I am not.

87
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:34,961
Even if you're not using college funds
for your expedition...

88
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:39,869
...won't you be using expensive
psychology department equipment?

89
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,840
Haven't you entered into an agreement
with Steven Rimbauer ?

90
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:47,845
Good afternoon, Mr. Bollinger.

91
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,109
Hi, Professor Reardon.
Hello.

92
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,118
Joyce, we have to discuss this.
I think not.

93
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:59,123
You'll have to discuss it
sooner or later.

94
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:04,495
The department's patience with your
shenanigans has grown quite short.

95
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,325
"Spooks. Somebody call...."

96
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,732
Professor? Can we discuss ?

97
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:10,860
My office hours are clearly posted.
Can't you read?

98
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,666
Sorry.

99
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,900
Oh, wait. Miss Spruce, isn't it?
Cathy Spruce, that's right.

100
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,239
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bite.
Office hours are at 2. Try me then?

101
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,801
Yes, Miss Reardon.

102
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,576
Out.

103
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,140
Out.

104
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:31,155
Far out.

105
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:42,166
Waterman residence.
Mr. Waterman. Joyce Reardon.

106
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,027
Oh, hello, Miss Reardon.
I've been meaning to call, but

107
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,661
Joyce, please.
I've been busy.

108
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:50,675
I'm finalizing my list of participants
for my Rose Red field trip.

109
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,702
I'd like you in.
Have you thought about it?

110
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,713
Rose Red is a dangerous place
for psyclnic experiments.

111
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,406
Joyce. As I'm sure you must be aware.

112
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,246
With all due respect,
Rose Red is a dead cell.

113
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,810
I'm sure it is.
If you're not psychic.

114
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,550
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'll let you go...

115
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,890
...and move on to
the next name on my list.

116
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,259
I doubt there are many.
Not post cognates of my caliber.

117
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,858
You might be surprised.
Good afternoon.

118
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,631
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I didn't say no, did l?

119
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:22,367
Didn't you?
No. But 5000 is a trifle low.

120
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:27,378
If you offered a bit more,
say 7500, for instance?

121
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,549
Mr. Waterman
Emery, please.

122
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,094
5000 is my first,
last and only offer.

123
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,460
And a generous one since there've been
no phenomena in Rose Red for years.

124
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,158
Since they stopped the tours
and took away the fresh meat.

125
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,327
Forgive me,
but I find that ridiculous.

126
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,599
The funding for this is
coming out of my pocket.

127
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:57,836
And 5000 is all I can afford. So,
what do you say, Emery? ln or out?

128
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,969
I'm in. But if you want a videotaped
debriefing afterward, I get extra.

129
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,639
Fine. Memorial Day weekend.
Mark your calendar.

130
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:07,652
You send me a check, Joyce,
and I will. Good day.

131
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:37,740
Putz.

132
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,015
Poisoned?

133
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,921
Guess not.

134
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:50,928
Emery.

135
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,925
Emery.

136
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,400
Hey, whoever you are...

137
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,165
...save the warnings for someone
who's not broke. Okay?

138
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,639
Emery! Emery!

139
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,144
Emery!

140
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,909
Here you are. There's some
more bags out in the car.

141
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:14,180
They're going out of business at
Griffin's. Everything's 25% off.

142
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,118
That's too much cream. You'll get fat.

143
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:21,125
"Er."
Beg your pardon?

144
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,143
Fatter. I'm already fat.

145
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,743
Cream clogs up your arteries.
A little's okay, but that's too much.

146
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,085
Get my things out of the car.
I made a killing.

147
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,022
I was doing the bills just now.
What about the bills?

148
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:04,529
They're past due.
The credit cards

149
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,824
I'm very careful with the credit
cards. I'm a very wise shopper.

150
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:10,835
I'll get your stuff.

151
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,295
Isn't this the best bear? I'll put
him on my bed with Hester and Fester.

152
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,841
What rhymes with Hester and Fester?
Pester.

153
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:21,846
The woman who wants to investigate
Rose Red called again.

154
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,873
See? Something always turns up.
God provides.

155
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,613
Rose Red is dangerous.
Take precautions and you'll be fine.

156
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,781
Were you able to get her up to 75?

157
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:36,487
No, she's financing the expedition.
So she told you and you believed her.

158
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:41,499
Wanna call her back? I've the number.
No. A deal's a deal.

159
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,733
One sensible thing your father said.

160
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,970
Did you tell her it'd be extra
for interviews? EIKGs?

161
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:57,982
Yes.
And no x rays. They give you cancer.

162
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,514
Run and get my bags.
Then you can have your pie.

163
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,148
Office hours are over.
Come back tomorrow! I said office

164
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:05,952
Extra credit, Miss Reardon?
I'll do anything.

165
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,962
Look great in a French maid's outfit.

166
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,230
Come in, you idiot. Close the door.
All right.

167
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:23,002
Teach, you are looking good today.

168
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:28,012
How are you doing?
I won't lie. It's been a tough day.

169
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,455
But I have a very important call
to make, so....

170
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:43,461
This is the Wheaton girl?
The one you want?

171
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,374
Her sister. If you keep quiet, you can
stay. If not, then go. Get out now.

172
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,110
That's tough talk considering
it's my homestead you wanna explore.

173
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,209
But I'll be good, I swear.
I won't do that. Sorry.

174
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:12,223
Hello? Miss Reardon?
Yes. How are you?

175
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,688
I'm fine, but it's hard to keep
people away from the phone here.

176
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,159
I'm on my break. Let's make it fast.
I could call you later.

177
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,458
No, I don't think so. I still live
at home to be near Annie...

178
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,467
...and my father knows who you are
and what you want. He doesn't approve.

179
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,504
Are you saying Annie won't take part?

180
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,472
I'm saying that
if I bring Annie to Rose Red...

181
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,508
...chances are that
I could never go home again.

182
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,736
That's fine, but Annie shouldn't go
witlnout someone who understands her.

183
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,801
And your parents don't.

184
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:38,816
My mother is scared to death of her.

185
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,484
And my father....
Well, I think my father hates her.

186
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:48,083
What can I do?

187
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,994
There's a schooljust outside
of Tacona for people lilke Annie.

188
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,497
No, there is no one like Annie,
I don't think, but....

189
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:58,002
It's a place for autistic teenagers.
A good place.

190
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,096
I might as well cut to the chase.
5000 isn't gonna be enough.

191
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,903
For 10, I could make it happen.
10,000? Done.

192
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:08,913
I'll bring the check to you myself
this afternoon. Where do you work?

193
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,779
No, you need to slow down.
I just need to think about this.

194
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,382
My tine is slnort, Miss Wheaton.

195
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:25,396
Please, call me Sister.
Everyone does.

196
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:32,703
Mr. Rimbauer has agreed to open Rose
Red over the Memorial Day weekend.

197
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:37,741
I need to know
if I can count on Annie.

198
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,423
I'm having an orientation
Monday niglnt...

199
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,191
...for the participants here
at the university.

200
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,233
It would be great
if Annie could join us.

201
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,292
If Annie goes to Rose Red, I go too.

202
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,305
That's fine, of course. When can
I lknow, Miss Wheaton? Sister?

203
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,036
I might be able to scrape up
as much as $ 1 2,000...

204
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,372
...if you can make a solid commitment
to the expedition right now.

205
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,207
I can't do that.
Goodbye, Miss Reardon.

206
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,974
When will I hear from you?
I'll be in touch.

207
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,479
Wait, tlne orientation Monday night?
I don't know.

208
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,711
I don't think so.

209
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,914
$ 10,000? $ 1 2,000? I'm thinking
I sold the old family homestead cheap.

210
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:34,925
You didn't sell it, you're renting it.
For a single weekend.

211
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,517
I've gotta have Annie Wheaton.
Why?

212
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:41,532
I've got a good group but they're
candles. Annie is a searchlight.

213
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:42,149
If anyone can wake up Rose Red,
it's her.

214
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:46,095
Waking up Rose Red is not a good idea.

215
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:50,828
I want Annie. I want Annie Wheaton.

216
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,665
Hello, dear.
Hey, Mom. Hi, Dad.

217
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:56,230
Long day? You look tired.
I'll microwave you a TV dinner.

218
00:22:56,308 --> 00:23:01,245
No, it's okay. I had something
to eat at the restaurant.

219
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,310
Is Annie okay?

220
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,081
Annie's fine.
Wearing out her ears again.

221
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,587
And ours. If not "A Summer Place,"
then "Pennsylvania 6 9000."

222
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,816
Same two over and over,
all afternoon.

223
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,520
Guess she just likes it.
I know. I just can't figure out why.

224
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,063
Thank God for small favors.

225
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,759
Annie. Annie. Come lnome.

226
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,061
We're waiting, Annie. We're waiting.

227
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,695
Please cone hone, Annie.
We're waiting.

228
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,366
Despite what some people may think,
psychic powers...

229
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,342
...telepathy, telekinesis,
precognition, all the rest...

230
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:37,348
...have no moral gradient.
They are neither good nor bad.

231
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:43,253
Houses are different.

232
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,453
Shirley Jackson was right.
Some houses are born bad.

233
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,354
Houses like this one.

234
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,655
Houses like Rose Red.

235
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,285
I knew it was big,
but that's enormous!

236
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,125
Well, fortunately for us,
an enormous dead cell.

237
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:55,598
There've been no overt manifestations
in Rose Red since 1 995 or so.

238
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,931
Some houses have their own inner life
which may or may not be conscious.

239
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,368
If there was once consciousness in
Rose Red, it manifested itself early.

240
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:04,375
Seattle 100 years ago was a different
world. More so than we can imagine.

241
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,719
Survival was an actual issue,
not a TV show.

242
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,587
Fortunes were made
by bandits in tall lnats.

243
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,788
You could get out of tlne way
or you could get run down.

244
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:28,731
In tlne year 1906,
you were on your own.

245
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,737
Rose Red was built
by Joln P. Rimbauer...

246
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,778
...on Spring Street in Seattle...

247
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:44,043
...as a wedding present to his wife.

248
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:48,176
He was founder of Omicron Oil Company,
until 1 950, the biggest in America.

249
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,983
1 950 was the year
Ellen Rimbauer disappeared.

250
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:55,493
The trouble with Rose Red started
even before there was a house.

251
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,497
Construction crews worlked
24 lnours, 7 days a week.

252
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,964
But that wasn't the problem.

253
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:05,867
Even before tlnere was a lnouse tlnere...

254
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:09,236
... that ground seened
to make people mad.

255
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:13,107
I mean, literally nad.

256
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:18,115
He made no effort to get away.

257
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,587
Just dropped his gun
and went to a Seattle saloon.

258
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,323
This is wlnere the police found him.

259
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,363
The teamster's name was Harry Corbin.

260
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,454
He claimed he remembered nothing
from breakfast...

261
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,760
...till he woke up in jail
with a knot behind his ear.

262
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,461
The judge and jury didn't believe him.
He got 25 years.

263
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:42,473
I think Harry Corbin may have been
Rose Red's first victim.

264
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,536
First male victim.

265
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,204
There's a difference between the way
Rose Red treats the ladies and men.

266
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:54,218
What do you mean exactly?
ln time, Nick. All in good time.

267
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,813
John Rimbauer and Ellen Gilchrist
were married on November 1 2, 1 907.

268
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,825
He was 40, she was 20.

269
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,259
By the day they wed, Rose Red had been
under construction for a year...

270
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,821
...and already tlnere lnad been tlnree
deaths, as well as the first foreman.

271
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,060
Take it up!

272
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,070
One nan was decapitated
by a sheet of falling glass.

273
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,936
One fell from a scaffold
and broke his neck. The third...

274
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:19,408
...choked to deatln
on a piece of apple.

275
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:23,607
This is the way Rose Red looked
when it was completed in 1 909.

276
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:27,516
In case your memory needs refreshing,
this is the way it looks today.

277
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:32,046
It's as if it metastasized.

278
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,988
It has how many rooms?
I don't think anyone knows.

279
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,894
You can count 74 on Monday, come
back Friday and come up with 87 or 97.

280
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,898
That's impossible.
That's Rose Red, sweetheart.

281
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,424
How many people have disappeared?
There must be an accurate account.

282
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,494
Twenty three since
the First World War.

283
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,266
I find that impossible to believe.

284
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:53,277
Of course you do. Anyone would.
But it's true.

285
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,345
Five men and 18 women.

286
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,351
Rose Red has always been
particularly fond of the ladies.

287
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:04,547
We are speaking of a house
which is dormant.

288
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,649
It better be because $5000
isn't enough if it isn't.

289
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,559
When was the last disappearance?
1972, 30 years ago.

290
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,065
There've been no observable
phenomena since

291
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,659
Who was it, the last one?
We've got a lot of ground to cover

292
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:22,469
A woman on the Historical Society's
annual tour. She was with the group.

293
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,477
It wasn't until the tour was over tlnat
tlney realized she wasn't witln then.

294
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:33,483
What's that?

295
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:39,222
They didn't find lner
but tlney did find lner purse.

296
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:45,362
Finished?
Yeah.

297
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:50,730
Thank you.
The lady's name was Liza Albert.

298
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,962
Since then the house has been closed.

299
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,732
With no psychic energy to feed on,
it's fallen into a sleep.

300
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,365
Then a coma. And now....
It's a dead cell.

301
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,932
Exactly.
I wouldn't bet on that if I were you.

302
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,945
It wasn't finished by the time they
married, but they were in no hurry.

303
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,106
They passed the time with
a leisurely honeymoon for a year.

304
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,515
They circled the globe on liners
like this one. The Ocean Star.

305
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,281
John Rimbauer's favorite part
of the grand tour was Africa.

306
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,880
Ellen didn't enjoy it quite as much.
In fact, she nearly died.

307
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:17,894
Was it malaria?
Probably not.

308
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,259
In her diary she called it
"an unmentionable disease...

309
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:21,923
...carried by men
and suffered by women."

310
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,194
Doesn't exactly look prostrate
with worry, does he?

311
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,394
Ellen recovered, and when they
took up residence in Rose Red...

312
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:29,031
...she was pregnant.

313
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,768
January 1909, that would have been.
John thought the house was finished.

314
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,072
The Rimbauers! They're here!

315
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,669
How beautiful you are, Rose Red.

316
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,874
Wlnat lne didn't know is that
tlne house would never be done.

317
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,941
Not in his lifetime, not in hers.

318
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,816
What makes Rose Red one of the world's
most fascinating psychic artifacts...

319
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,855
...is that the house continued to grow
until its death in 1 995 or '96.

320
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,151
Until 1 950, changes were made
according to the will of Ellen.

321
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,419
And her will, ladies and gentlemen,
was iron.

322
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,188
After 1 950....

323
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,354
After 1 950, Rose Red grew on its own.

324
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,330
In tlne fall of 1909,
Ellen Rimbauer gave birth to a son.

325
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,163
Grampy.
Your grandfather, really?

326
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,031
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

327
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,163
In her diary she wrote, "I have called
him Adam, for he is the first."

328
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,366
Sukeena, wlno cane fron Africa,
saw her through tlne difficult labor.

329
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,432
Ellen never refers
to Sulkeena as lner servant.

330
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,501
First, slne calls lner "my friend. "
And later, "my sister. "

331
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,069
Wlnen slne gave birth to a dauglnter
witln a withered arn...

332
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:14,084
...slne blaned lner siclkness
and Joln's sexual appetites.

333
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,744
Although she wrote,
"In my mind, they are one."

334
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,414
To which she added, "Damn all men."

335
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,356
Their dauglnter was born
in April of 191 1.

336
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,017
And April was wlnat they called her.

337
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:28,031
After her dauglnter's birth,
Ellen becane convinced...

338
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,567
... that her fever, which recurred
periodically, would kill her young.

339
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,467
That nade her easy gane
for Madane Stravinski.

340
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,472
If you have anything to say to us...

341
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,132
...you may use my body to speak.

342
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,800
Give us a sign.

343
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,344
Show us a sign.

344
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:44,848
Not even Sukeena could convince her
tlnat slne was a fraud.

345
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,374
Beloved spirits, we invite you
to commune with us.

346
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,388
Show us a sign.

347
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:56,393
Fraud or not, Madane Stravinski...

348
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:06,436
...lknown to police in San Francisco
and Los Angeles as Cora Frye...

349
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,910
...changed Ellen Rinbauer's life
one night in August of 1914.

350
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,311
Sukeena!

351
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,373
You must build.

352
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,543
What did she tell her?

353
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,280
She said she wouldn't die
until the house was finished.

354
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,787
And Madame S. told her it isn't
finished until you say it's finished.

355
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,323
Until you say.

356
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,585
Ellen took it seriously.
Probably she was right to.

357
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,388
She never had another attack
of her African fever.

358
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,928
Probably psychosomatic.
Probably PMS, right, Em?

359
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,727
I wouldn't be surprised.

360
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,597
A new wing started going up
the next week.

361
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,296
What did her husband say?

362
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,861
She gave him a son in 1909, a daughter
in 1 91 1 . The son was fine and well.

363
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,034
It was the son John Rimbauer cared
about. Ellen could do as she liked.

364
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,202
Would you agree?
Yes. Besides...

365
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,304
...lne had affairs of his own
to tend to.

366
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,110
Ellen made additions to the house
until her disappearance in 1 950.

367
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,346
Over 40 years
of well financed eccentricity.

368
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,014
She hired contractors and architects
to build unconventional stuff.

369
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,025
Such as?

370
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:04,084
The so called Tower Folly was
conpleted in 1921.

371
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,686
Joln Rimbauerjumped
fron it two years later.

372
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,025
Was it suicide? Or did he run into
something he couldn't deal with?

373
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,191
The certificate said,
"accidental death."

374
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,202
The gossip said suicide or ghosts.

375
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,431
In any case, during its active years,
and they were very active...

376
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,303
...women in Rose Red tended
to turn up missing.

377
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,775
And men tended to turn up dead.

378
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:23,177
The bad days are over.
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

379
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,614
Are you sure?
Positive.

380
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:29,175
Then what exactly do you want
from us, Miss Reardon?

381
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:34,391
That'll make things less difficult.
This can be a difficult field.

382
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,917
People don't understand our goals
or refuse to credit our findings.

383
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,158
Some people are actively cruel.

384
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:45,168
And....

385
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,594
Research goals?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

386
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,140
My research goals specify
measurable, psychic phenomena.

387
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,143
Hard data. Telemetry readouts and
anomalous energy levels, primarily.

388
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,544
I want readouts that even the most
stupid, sarcastic, obtuse member...

389
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,946
...of this scientific department
will have to accept.

390
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,383
If I get a little crazy on the subject
sometimes, please forgive me.

391
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:04,250
I've put in a lot of long days.

392
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,883
If Rose Red is a dead cell, how much
proof can you expect to find?

393
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,359
If you apply electricity
to the leg of a dead frog...

394
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,226
...the muscles contract
hours after it has died.

395
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,026
You people are my psychic
equivalent of electricity.

396
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:19,035
My goal is modest. A single twitch.

397
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,628
One single twitch.

398
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,504
If I get it, my reputation will be
secure for the rest of my life.

399
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,907
More importantly, we can help
legitimize a branch of psychology...

400
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:31,915
...which has been treated
poorly for too long.

401
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:38,321
Why are you here, Mr. Rimbauer?
What are your special talents?

402
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,787
Protecting family interests.
I promised the professor one shot...

403
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:48,798
...then the developers await.
Tech Star condos.

404
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:54,371
You're tearing it down?
It's part of history.

405
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,442
History don't pay rent and I'm broke.
Hardly a noble motive.

406
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,445
Are we the team? The whole team?

407
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:06,415
She hopes not.
Beg pardon?

408
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:11,421
I was hoping for one more
but that's starting to look iffy.

409
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:16,493
If I have to make do with you five,
then I'll count myself lucky.

410
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:48,948
I'll see you this Friday at 2 p.m.

411
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,326
I'm sure it'll be
a Memorial Day to remember.

412
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,228
Now if you could all
please come and join me.

413
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:58,132
I'd like to close with a circle.

414
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,066
This went out with high button shoes.
Anything you'd like to focus on?

415
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:03,904
Goodwill, good thoughts, each other.
That's lovely.

416
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,409
Say cheese.

417
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,968
Vic? Are you okay?
Fine.

418
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,537
I'm just gonna go make some room.

419
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,412
He looks gray about the gills.

420
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,609
No, no, no. Well, maybe
half a glass but no more.

421
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:18,621
Just a minute, please.

422
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,893
The Huslkies were surprised
by tlne blitz.

423
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:02,899
The linebacker drops into the
flanlk, tlnen rushes the quarterbaclk.

424
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,397
Nobody on the left side
sees lnin coming.

425
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:12,432
Hello. I'd like to speak
with Rachel, please.

426
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,447
Who's this?
May I spealk with Raclnel?

427
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:24,583
Is it the crazy lady from the college?
How you doing, crazy lady?

428
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,556
Is that for me?

429
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:32,562
My business is with
your older dauglnter

430
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,207
No, see, you got it wrong.
You have no business here.

431
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,343
Not with Sissy, not with Annie,
not with any of us.

432
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,080
Don't ever call here again, got it?

433
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,214
Daddy, that was my call.

434
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,690
That was just some crazy lady.
No, you've no right

435
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,660
Yeah, I do. While you
live and eat here, I do.

436
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,357
Stop it, both of you.

437
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:11,265
I know what the crazy lady wants.

438
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,862
I know you talked to her
behind my back.

439
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,533
Let me tell you this. Annie's not
going anywhere near Rose Red.

440
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,237
Mama?
She doesn't say. I say.

441
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:25,476
Mama, won't you help me once?
Just this once, won't you speak up?

442
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,314
I've told you, I won't take sides
between you and your father.

443
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:32,117
Mama, what about Annie's side?
The Gatt School

444
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,820
What planet are you on?
The Gatt School with $5000?

445
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,055
Professor Reardon has promised 1 2!

446
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:44,067
I knew she was crazy, now you?
20 grand's what it would take. A year.

447
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,463
Rose Red is famous. If something
happens, it'll be worth a fortune.

448
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,597
Oh, yeah, sure. I can just
see her on Geraldo.

449
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,505
"I'm Annie Wheaton. I'll tell
folks about a haunted house."

450
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,669
Stop it! Don't mock her.
I'm saving her.

451
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,302
From crazy lady one and
crazy lady two. Now that is it.

452
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,279
This case is closed. I don't
wanna hear anymore about it.

453
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,816
Stop it, Annie! Stop it!

454
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,613
Make her stop!

455
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,483
What do you think, Dad?

456
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,988
What do you think Annie wants?

457
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:06,682
Stop it, Annie!

458
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,152
George!

459
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,626
Make her stop!
For God's sake, George!

460
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,219
Please, make her stop!

461
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,820
We thought you were lost.
No. Just misplaced.

462
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,763
May I propose a toast?
Sure.

463
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,425
To Rose Red.

464
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,299
Rose Red.

465
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,963
Joyce, she's looking,
still hoping for one more.

466
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,169
Six. Six is the number.

467
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,643
A girl, a teenager.

468
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:32,649
And I think our dear professor
will be in luck.

469
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,245
Is that something you see?

470
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:41,121
What's your special trick, Pam?

471
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,489
I'm what psychic journals
call a touch know.

472
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,755
It doesn't always work but sometimes
when I handle things...

473
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,593
...l see stuff or get feelings.

474
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,599
Of course, a lot of times
there's nothing.

475
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:54,604
What about you, Vic?

476
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,562
Two people, mid 20s.

477
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,606
She's in a blue dress.
He's in jeans.

478
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:33,872
He's blond, over golded.

479
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,607
He's got a case of Roman hands
and Russian fingers.

480
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:41,083
What in the world are you talking ?

481
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,676
Let's go outside. You wanna?

482
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:47,690
Sure.
All right.

483
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:56,059
Tres chic, n'est ce pas?
You're precognitive!

484
00:38:56,133 --> 00:39:01,070
I can tell a hawk from a handsaw
when the wind's in the northwest.

485
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,734
What about you, Cathy?
I'm an automatic writer.

486
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,744
A Ouija board.
Yes, but I don't like Ouija boards.

487
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,712
The channel's too wide and sometimes
what comes through is unpleasant.

488
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,682
This is better. Sometimes
it's precog, sometimes it's astral.

489
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,151
Mostly it's just people to people.

490
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,380
Someone concentrate hard. You, Pam.

491
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,754
Oh, okay, let's see.

492
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:25,762
I guess it's not working.

493
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:35,132
Steve?

494
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:40,143
What about you, St ? Nick.

495
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:51,421
He calls her Dee.
Now why does he do that, I wonder?

496
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:52,081
Nick?

497
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,752
I do a little of this,
a little of that.

498
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,418
Sometimes I get lucky
and things turn out okay.

499
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,392
What about our new friend, Emery?
What about him?

500
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,326
Your friend, not mine.

501
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,988
Yeah, I think Emery is chiefly
post cognitive. He sees the past.

502
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,692
Not the most comfortable of talents.

503
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,667
Here's to good thoughts, goodwill.

504
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:16,502
Good thoughts, goodwill.

505
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:21,511
Who are you?

506
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,658
Why are you here?
Where are you from?

507
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,788
When are you from?

508
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:41,729
Is it Rose Red?

509
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,289
Read my lips.

510
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:48,304
Save the warnings for someone
who's not broke. Okay?

511
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,315
I remember that day.

512
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,046
She was happy, wasn't she?

513
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,984
We all were.
Oh, man, would you look at this?

514
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:04,816
Guess those were the days, huh?
lgnorance is bliss.

515
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,357
Daddy, what Annie is,
isn't anyone's fault.

516
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,118
Not hers, not mine, not yours.

517
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:13,129
I know. But you're too busy thinking
about what you want for her...

518
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,471
...to think about what she can do.

519
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,708
Remember when
the Stantons' dog bit her?

520
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,683
How the stones came down?
Or what she did to those pipes?

521
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,846
After tonight, how can you have
any doubts about what she wants?

522
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:42,859
Sweetheart, taking Annie into
a genuinely haunted house?

523
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,557
That's like using a lighter
to see how full your gas tank is.

524
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,657
It's a chance. That's what you don't
get. A chance for her to get out

525
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,531
And for you to get out from under.

526
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,731
I just want what's best for Annie.

527
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,831
I know, Sissy,
but you don't know what that is.

528
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:02,845
Believe me.

529
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,990
Come, Annie. Cone.

530
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:20,860
Shame you can't do the same
with the other 40,000 or so.

531
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:25,868
People read it today and line
litter boxes with it tomorrow.

532
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:53,763
They'll remember.

533
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,825
Some will take it out next time
the university bond issue comes up.

534
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:02,838
A photo like this could put a hundred
worthwhile programs to beggary.

535
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,488
But what do you care?

536
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:33,502
Do you have a point?
Get to it. I have a lot to do.

537
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:43,112
Crystals to polish? Ouijas to wax?

538
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:48,918
You put Bollinger up to this,
didn't you?

539
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,773
You told him where to go
and when to point his camera.

540
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,777
Your paranoia's showing.

541
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,017
That's a nasty little cut.

542
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:25,752
Listen, I'm afraid I have a bit
of bad news for you, old girl.

543
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:30,760
I am not old, not yet anyway.

544
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,028
And I am certainly not your girl.
What are you talking about?

545
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,091
Executive committee's been
in session regarding tenure.

546
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,568
What? Why? No one's up for tenure.
The only thing they could

547
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:45,370
You really are a bastard.

548
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:50,379
They voted five to two to revoke
your tenure. We tried to contact you.

549
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:04,592
You'll find a message.
I thought the spirits would tell you.

550
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:05,719
The general consensus is,
it's time to stop the silliness.

551
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,161
I'll fight you every step of the way.
Of course, and you'll lose.

552
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:12,168
Your days of haunting the Wimser
Psychology Department...

553
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,210
...aren't over, but numbered.

554
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,875
When I come back with proof, you
The rallying cry of crackpots...

555
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,611
...and deluded religionists since
the Stone Age: "The proof's out there."

556
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:06,622
This is sad. You were respected
in the field of child psychology...

557
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:15,431
...but then you got bitten
by the virus!

558
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,473
It's a legitimate field
of psychological

559
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,806
It's crap, sleaze, a spit
in the eye of rational thought.

560
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,675
Rose Red will be your last
goose chase as a faculty member.

561
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,577
You're an idiot and you're blind.

562
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:32,808
What if you found proof?

563
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,976
Photographs, audio recordings
of clanking chains, telemetry.

564
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:39,386
What good would it do? Have you
even considered such thoughts?

565
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,947
I feel remarkably well today, Carl,
in spite of all your crap.

566
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,720
And this, this is
the world we live in...

567
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:46,888
...and experience with our senses.
Skin, smooth and rational.

568
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,262
Where every cause has an effect and
can be predicted with data at hand.

569
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,630
There's a world under that world.

570
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,100
Blood, under the skin. Rationalistic
asses like you don't see it.

571
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,729
It's liquid instead of solid.
Hot instead of just warm.

572
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:59,742
It is a world full of mystery.

573
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,205
You don't like it, do you? No.

574
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,545
Don't give me your bull
about bond issues.

575
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,586
You're afraid of
what's under the skin.

576
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:10,278
But I'm not. Do you hear me, Carl?
I'm not.

577
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:15,291
If you've given me something
That's what it comes down to.

578
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,921
You're afraid to catch something.
Get out.

579
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:24,934
Go to the infirmary
and get an AIDS test.

580
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:42,818
When the semester's over,
you're done.

581
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,181
You're finished teaching.
You're crazy! You're insane!

582
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,048
Good day, old boy.

583
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:21,056
What are you looking at?!
Look at it somewhere else!

584
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:30,299
We did it, didn't we?
We really nailed her.

585
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:07,887
What's on your face?

586
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,892
Never mind. Never mind.

587
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,897
We have a lot to talk about,
young man.

588
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:23,262
The story's not over?

589
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:28,277
It's just beginning.
It's just beginning.

590
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:35,851
From the Department of Questions
Better Not Answered:

591
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:39,820
If a tree falls in the forest and
no one hears it, does it make noise?

592
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:44,827
Who cuts the barber's hair?

593
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:02,374
Who leaves money under
the tooth fairy's pillow?

594
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,640
How come no one realizes Clark IKent...

595
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:08,741
...is just Superman wearing glasses?

596
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:12,584
If I didn't own Rose Red,
would I be in bed with you right now?

597
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:17,593
Hello.

598
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:22,729
How was your day, dear?
Give it back.

599
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:26,132
How was your day? Or should I just
roll over and make myself small?

600
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:31,140
They revoked my tenure. Carl Miller
dropped by to give me the news.

601
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,405
Wait, can they do that?
Maybe, probably.

602
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,277
Bollinger made us look like the Stupid
family, with me as head Stupid.

603
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,873
Wanna turn off your light?

604
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:45,888
Well, you know, you're pretty
damn calm about it.

605
00:53:55,799 --> 00:54:00,736
I heard from Sister.
She accepted the 1 2,000 I offered.

606
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:07,476
When I come back from
Rose Red with hard data...

607
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:12,207
...there'll be four dozen
schools willing to hire me.

608
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:17,219
First, I'll write a book.
It's gonna sell 80 gazillion copies.

609
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:22,288
You once said that
the only certainty...

610
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:27,296
...with the paranormal
is nothing's certain.

611
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:40,536
What if nothing happens
after three days?

612
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,547
But it will.
Annie Wheaton is my guarantee.

613
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,019
She's, oh....

614
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:55,023
Let's just say she's one of a kind.

615
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,233
Rose Red isn't a true dead cell.
Annie will wake it up.

616
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,278
If you let it stand for six
months, the possibilities

617
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:20,282
No. No. It's coming down in July
and I can't wait.

618
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:42,271
I cannot wait.

619
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,400
How can you hate it so much?

620
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,341
It eats my relatives!
Sorry.

621
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:52,006
Did you miss that in your research?

622
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:55,449
It's just that it means a lot to me.

623
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,248
Yeah, too much, maybe.

624
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:02,155
You're gonna need some downtime when
this is over. Some serious R and R.

625
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:05,717
You have the cell phone.
Right here.

626
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:10,061
And you got plenty of film.
Of course I have plenty of film.

627
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:15,070
I don't know if this is a good idea.

628
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:21,603
Don't tell me you're afraid.

629
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:26,615
No, of course I'm not afraid.
It's just big.

630
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:33,922
What if I get lost?

631
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:39,522
You're about to step out in
the real world for a couple of weeks.

632
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:42,360
That's where you'll get lost.

633
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:47,369
Nail this story, you can
write your own ticket.

634
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:54,035
I thought that's what you wanted.

635
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:57,409
Why don't you come with me?

636
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,109
I do have a few things to do like
run my department, oversee finals.

637
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,119
Call when you get pictures
and I or my wife will come.

638
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:07,281
She can't stand Reardon either.

639
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:10,918
If they catch me, they'll tear
me apart. You know that.

640
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:15,931
There's no reason why they should
if you're reasonably careful.

641
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:24,706
I guess.

642
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:28,909
Don't forget this.

643
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:33,108
Try and get a good picture
of them being psychic.

644
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,550
Professor, I don't think
Stiff upper.

645
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:40,521
Professor Miller.

646
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:44,048
You're a step away from stardom,
dear boy! Just get the pictures!

647
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,755
Solarium, kitchen, tool shed...

648
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:51,767
...back door, front door.

649
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:02,711
Oh, I thought this house was empty.

650
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:05,577
You would be Mr. Bollinger,
I believe. The reporter.

651
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,481
I'm Bollinger, but how did you know?

652
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:11,384
Come in, sir. You're expected.

653
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:13,684
Ma'am? Where are you?

654
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:18,693
This way, sir.

655
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:51,493
Hello?

656
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,857
Hello?

657
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:02,735
Ma'am, I seem to have lost you.

658
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:07,742
Ma'am?

659
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:14,716
Is anybody here?

660
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,892
Ma'am?

661
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,658
Screw this.

662
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:33,668
Very funny,
but I wanna leave, all right?

663
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:37,102
Let me out!

664
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:41,132
I could use a little help in here!
I'm in the greenhouse!

665
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:46,147
Let me out!

666
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:51,753
Let me out of here! Let me out!

667
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:59,594
I'm out of here. Come on.

668
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:08,133
Get a grip, Bollinger.

669
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:13,141
Hello? Wlno is this?

670
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:33,328
Bollinger? Bollinger, is tlnat you?

671
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:40,535
Hello?

672
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:46,508
They'll be here. Come on.

673
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:07,429
Wait! Don't make me chase you, Emmy.

674
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,672
Mom, I'm okay.
Oh, yes, you're always okay.

675
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:21,506
Listen to me. If there's
anything you can't handle...

676
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:25,343
...anything beyond telesmic
manifestations, call and I'll get you.

677
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,849
I will. I have to go.
Call anyway so I know you're fine.

678
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:30,283
I will. I always do. They're waiting.
Well, let them wait!

679
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,787
They won't do much without you.
Now turn around.

680
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:37,792
Mom
Turn around!

681
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,355
And stay away from that blond girl.
She looks like a tramp.

682
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:45,424
Now give Mommy a kiss.

683
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,197
Oh, you're all over lipstick.
Fix yourself.

684
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:53,208
I see new frontiers...

685
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:56,672
...in abnormal psychology
before us. How exciting.

686
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,646
Especially if you move your bowels!

687
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,309
The day before camp must have
been busy at the Watermans'.

688
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:06,321
Shut up.

689
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,248
Off to the house
on Haunted Hill, I see?

690
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,557
And with about $ 100,000 worth
of department equipment, I'd guess.

691
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:18,566
I've got all the proper paperwork
signed in all the proper places.

692
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,436
Signed by Rogers.

693
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:31,446
When I was on vacation,
he acted for me. Clever of you.

694
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:36,675
Do you have a point?
I'm being pleasant.

695
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:41,690
If you'll excuse us, we're in a hurry.
Yes, of course.

696
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:06,247
Places to go. Ghosts to bust.
Isn't that right, Mr. Rimbauer?

697
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:15,287
More or less.

698
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:20,295
Yes. Well, do try and keep
the equipment in one piece.

699
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:33,908
Good luck.

700
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:43,418
"The Spirits have done it all
in one night."

701
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:44,745
Scrooge says it
when he wakes up changed.

702
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:49,758
That's what Miller made me think of.
Scrooge on Christmas.

703
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:58,566
I don't trust him.

704
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:12,714
Hello, are you the group?

705
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:22,557
The Rose Red group?
Yes. I'm Pam Asbury.

706
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:35,470
This is Cathy IKramer.
Hi.

707
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:44,145
Victor IKandinsky.
Vic. Just Vic.

708
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:49,851
Nick Hardaway.

709
01:04:56,292 --> 01:05:01,229
And Emery Waterman.

710
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:15,977
And you must be....

711
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:26,421
Oh, I'm Sissy Wheaton.
And this is Annie.

712
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:36,865
I was sure we were gonna miss you.
Traffic was horrible.

713
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:42,337
We're glad you didn't.
Sister, or do you prefer Rachel?

714
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:47,265
Oh, either is fine.

715
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:51,973
Oh, stop it, Annie. Just quit it.

716
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:56,985
Good God, she's retarded.

717
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:02,891
If you keep your evaluation
of Miss Wheaton to yourself...

718
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,788
...we won't ask questions...

719
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:10,161
...about your relationship with
your mother. Chin, chin.

720
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:15,169
Folks, I think we're ready.

721
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,393
You've reaclned Carl Miller.

722
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:42,522
Please leave a nessage
after the tone.

723
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:47,535
Bollinger, I told you
to keep the phone with you.

724
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:53,374
All right, tlney've left tlne canpus.

725
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,706
They'll be there in 40 minutes
so be ready.

726
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:57,439
And call me back.

727
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,380
There she is.

728
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:04,886
It seems to be looking at us.

729
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,444
It is, Cathy. It is.

730
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:10,083
Steve.

731
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:13,219
Mommy? Where are you?

732
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:16,458
Mommy? I'm scared.

733
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:19,194
Where are you, Mommy?

734
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,168
Steve.

735
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:24,673
Steve, you okay?

736
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:29,234
Yeah, sure. Fine.

737
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,211
You wanna know a secret?

738
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,217
I've never done anything like this
before and I'm scared to death.

739
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:42,621
Be not afraid. Only believe.

740
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:47,628
We're lucky. The electronic
stuff was delivered earlier.

741
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,534
What are these?
House plans, probably as useful...

742
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:57,197
...as a 14th century map of Africa.
And here, a coil of rope.

743
01:07:57,273 --> 01:08:01,073
How you doing, sweetie?
You okay?

744
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,611
Mommy, I'n scared.

745
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:06,170
Come, Stevie.

746
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,341
What is it? What can you hear?

747
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,884
Steve?
It knows we're here.

748
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:12,045
It wants us here.

749
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:15,989
God help us, it wants us here.

750
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:17,047
Come in.

751
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:21,358
Houses are alive.

752
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:26,367
This is sonething we know.

753
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,882
News from our nerve endings.

754
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,114
If we're quiet...

755
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:48,053
...if we listen...

756
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,788
... we can lnear lnouses breathe.

757
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,922
Sonetines in tlne depth of niglnt,
we hear tlnem groan.

758
01:08:55,998 --> 01:09:00,935
It's as if they're lnaving bad dreams.

759
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,666
A good house cradles and conforts.

760
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,470
A bad one fills us with
instinctive unease.

761
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,774
Bad lnouses hate our warmth,
our lnumanness.

762
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:14,942
That blind hate of our lnumanity
is wlnat we mean by the word "Inaunted. "

763
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:17,076
Steve? Are you all right?

764
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,313
Yeah.

765
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:23,324
It stopped.

766
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:37,939
I heard it too. But it stopped.

767
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:44,345
What did you hear?

768
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:50,852
There were words. It wasn't clear.
Did any of you....

769
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,394
I might have heard something.
It may have been my imagination.

770
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:04,398
What was it?
I don't know. I'm not psychic.

771
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,491
You tested me yourself,
so there's no real

772
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:11,506
What? What are you looking at?

773
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:19,514
Nothing.

774
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:46,797
Pam.

775
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:50,902
Can you come here?

776
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:54,143
Well, we might as well get started.

777
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,116
Will you ?

778
01:10:56,185 --> 01:11:01,122
All right.

779
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,028
Emers, old boy, give us a hand.
It seems to be the butler's day off.

780
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:11,726
Don't call me that.
Come on.

781
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,292
For $5000 you can carry
a couple boxes.

782
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:17,931
I am not being paid for my services
as a porter.

783
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,407
Pam, you all right?

784
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:23,502
Hey, I thought this house was enpty.

785
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:28,516
You would be Mr. Bollinger, I believe.
The reporter.

786
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:29,476
I'm Bollinger, but how did you lknow?

787
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,143
Come in, sir. You were expected.

788
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,451
This way.

789
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:38,220
Come in, sir. You were expected.

790
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:43,231
This way.

791
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:54,568
How old were you when you got
lost in there? Eight? Nine?

792
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,941
What?
The room with colored light.

793
01:11:57,012 --> 01:12:01,949
The smell of sawdust.

794
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:18,966
What happened? What did you see?

795
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,397
What? What frightened you?

796
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:28,705
I don't know what
you're talking about.

797
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:33,714
You know, don't you?

798
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:37,718
But you're not saying.

799
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:42,314
What is it?

800
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:46,088
It's cold. Cold metal, that's all.
No, but you spoke.

801
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:50,188
There was something there,
but it's gone.

802
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:54,759
I didn't like the way it felt.

803
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:59,774
The caretaker left it after he
let in the equipment guys.

804
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,202
He'll miss it.
Not after summer.

805
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:08,215
In September there won't be
a gate to open.

806
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:25,566
There's a flashlight for everyone.
IKeep it on you at all times.

807
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:30,805
The power's usually fine.

808
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:35,507
If it goes out, I don't suppose
the fuse box does much good?

809
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:40,514
Nope, neither does calling
Puget Sound Energy.

810
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:48,122
And your equipment?
lf the power goes, it uses batteries.

811
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:53,286
We better get started.

812
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:56,593
Where's Annie?

813
01:13:56,665 --> 01:14:01,602
She's wonderful.

814
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:08,309
Friday afternoon, 3:1 7 p.m.

815
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:14,382
We've experienced our first paranormal
phenomenon: a phantom draft.

816
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:25,659
I insist that you don't go
exploring on your own.

817
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:52,345
The geography can seem unstable.

818
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,888
Let's double up on sleeping
arrangements. I'll share with Cathy.

819
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:57,119
The three of us could go in.

820
01:14:57,192 --> 01:15:00,958
I'll sleep with Emery.
We'll raid the fridge.

821
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,091
No, the bedrooms are safe.
Just don't wander off.

822
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:07,192
I think you'll find this interesting.
Wow.

823
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:09,294
You could make Thanksgiving dinner
for a hundred people here.

824
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:12,807
Maybe after the place was fumigated.
You're such a charmer.

825
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:16,504
Was I talking to you?

826
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:18,944
Ellen Rimbauer called this
the Health Room.

827
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:19,946
We call it a solarium.

828
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,846
A railroad executive, George Meader,
drinking buddy...

829
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:26,854
...of John Rimbauer, died in here
just after the end of WWl.

830
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:30,656
According to a doctor,
he was stung by a bee.

831
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:35,663
He died of an extrene
allergic reaction.

832
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,991
As I told you, in Rose Red's heyday,
men didn't fair well here.

833
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:40,534
That's not very reassuring.

834
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,298
Nothing to worry about. Just use
the buddy system in the house.

835
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,498
Now
Whoa.

836
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:48,669
What?

837
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:51,235
What's this?

838
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:54,282
The caretaker leave that too?
Doubt it.

839
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,283
Well, then who?
Press redial and see who answers.

840
01:15:56,351 --> 01:16:01,288
You've reaclned Professor Miller
of the Psychology departnent.

841
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,183
I'm unable to answer the phone. Leave
a nessage. But renember Slnalkespeare:

842
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:07,092
Who is it?
Brevity is the soul of wit.

843
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:10,222
This is Joyce Reardon's friend,
Steven Rimbauer.

844
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:13,962
We found your property in Rose Red.

845
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,596
I'm sure you didn't drop it, since
we just saw you. But I know who did.

846
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,799
The guy who wrote the story.
Trespassing isn't serious.

847
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:22,037
Abetting a trespasser is less serious,
but your dignity will take a hit.

848
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:26,376
Guess who will be on next week's
newspaper cover?

849
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:31,385
You have a nice day.
Bravo, Steve, bravo.

850
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:33,347
You can't be certain that's his phone.
Of course it is.

851
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,390
I bet one of the numbers in memory
is that son of a bitch Bollinger.

852
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:40,394
If the reporter had the phone,
where is he?

853
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:49,064
Maybe the house ate him.
Isn't that what it's supposed to do?

854
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:50,229
Something that he doesn't believe in
frightened him, and he ran off.

855
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:52,933
Perhaps he's still in the house.
Then we'll find him.

856
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:56,341
Come on, folks
You sure we shouldn't notify somebody?

857
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:58,879
Why should we? lf he's here,
he's trespassing, like Steve said.

858
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:05,452
If we call the cops, we'll
have half a dozen police...

859
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:10,156
...roiling up the atmosphere,
and he'll win!

860
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:15,060
That pig Miller will win,
and I can't have it.

861
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,564
Okay? I just won't. I can't.

862
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,932
It's okay. He doesn't get to win.

863
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:25,940
And if we find Bollinger,
we spank him and send him on his way.

864
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:36,908
Sounds good to me.
Yeah, me too.

865
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:40,477
On with the show?

866
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:45,492
On with the show.

867
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:52,967
It's a pity no one kept up
those vines.

868
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:55,593
There hasn't been a groundskeeper
since Omicron Oil fell off the board.

869
01:17:55,671 --> 01:18:00,108
We're in the kitchen because...

870
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:04,669
...Joyce wants to tell you
about my great aunt April.

871
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:09,683
Go on.
Are you sure?

872
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:14,919
Sure. That's what we're here for.
Besides, it was before my time.

873
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,515
April was 6 when she disappeared. Her
brother Adam was in boarding school.

874
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:22,529
Boarding school at 8?
It was Rimbauer's idea.

875
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,399
Ellen ranted and raved. But John
put his foot down and kept it down.

876
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:30,302
He didn't trust Rose Red even then.
This was the last place...

877
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:33,739
...April was ever seen.

878
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:38,746
Sukeena stepped into the pantry
over there...

879
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,013
...for what she swore was no more than
30 seconds. When she came out....

880
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,485
April?

881
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:23,923
April, honey, where are you?

882
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:26,620
April?

883
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:27,662
Fifty men searched the house
and grounds. They found nothing.

884
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:32,666
Not so much as a lock of hair
or a thread from her dress.

885
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:42,742
Great Grandfather, convinced of
Sukeena's guilt, took her downtown.

886
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:47,748
Ellen objected in tlne strongest terms,
but Joln declined to listen.

887
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:56,256
She's innocent!
Ellen, stop it!

888
01:19:56,324 --> 01:20:00,818
Please, John! Sukeena!

889
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:05,833
She was taken to a room and questioned
for 50 hours. No sleep, no food...

890
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:10,971
...no bathroom breaks, no mercy.

891
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:21,173
I don't know.

892
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:24,548
She was gone.

893
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:29,556
I don't know.

894
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:35,925
She convinced them she didn't know
about April's disappearance, but...

895
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:39,057
...it cost her three teeth,
a broken nose and a broken wrist.

896
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:43,195
Eventually, Ellen's maid was allowed
to return home again.

897
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:48,208
I mean, the only home she had left.

898
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,574
When do we go upstairs? I hear
that's where the weird stuff is.

899
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,944
No time like the present.

900
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:58,952
Come on, everybody.

901
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:05,490
I didn't notice that one before.

902
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:10,497
Neither did l.

903
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:15,769
Could you try to remember who's
running this expedition?

904
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:23,777
Sure.
Thanks.

905
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:32,586
Come here, please.

906
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:41,829
Tie your rope to that pole.
It'll help us find our way back.

907
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:43,858
Couldn't we just go and get the plans?

908
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:48,631
The plans don't always mean a lot.
It's a safety measure.

909
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:53,640
So follow me, and prepare
to be amazed.

910
01:21:57,078 --> 01:22:02,015
Ellen called this the
Perspective Hallway.

911
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,423
Her first major addition.
And no architect designed it.

912
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:18,625
She made it up herself?
Way to go, Ellen.

913
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,602
But she didn't.

914
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:27,608
Then who?

915
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:33,547
Sukeena.

916
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:40,178
Her maid?
Her companion.

917
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:45,192
It's so wild, like something
in a fun house.

918
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:57,604
Oh, it's making my stomach turn.

919
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:04,077
I guess they're pieces
built in perspective.

920
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:12,686
Camouflaging the doors
was Great Gram's idea.

921
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:18,122
She didn't want them to spoil
the illusion.

922
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:20,354
Bollinger! Hey, Bollinger,
are you in there?

923
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:25,365
Whoa!

924
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,766
Annie, no!

925
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:34,400
No!

926
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:39,413
You be quiet!

927
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:45,650
You wanted this place to wake up.
I'd say you've been successful.

928
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:49,679
Does she ever get assertive, or does
she always waffle like that?

929
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:54,695
She doesn't talk much, but
what she says, she means.

930
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:04,999
I'll say.
In the mid 60s...

931
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:09,635
...a team of scientists spent
some time investigating Rose Red...

932
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:14,648
...and heard the house scream.

933
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:28,261
They recorded them, although
they don't sound impressive.

934
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,797
And what did they conclude?
That it was underground water.

935
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:32,696
Perhaps amplified by the water pipes
under this part of Seattle.

936
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:37,704
Underground water?

937
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,965
People facing these phenomena
tend to protect their belief systems.

938
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:44,978
This hallway was the last place
Ellen Rimbauer was ever seen.

939
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,778
They moved in on January 1 5th, 1909.

940
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:54,447
Each January 1 5th, Ellen wore the same
dress she wore when they arrived.

941
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:59,459
Ellen threw a party every January 1 5th
and everybody showed up.

942
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:07,431
Politicians, hoodlums,
sports players, stars.

943
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,697
When the actress disappeared,
the parties stopped.

944
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:13,571
Finish telling us about
old Mrs. Rimbauer.

945
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:16,303
She disappeared on January 1 5th, 1950.
She was 70.

946
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:19,005
A maid wished her good evening...

947
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:24,017
...and slne swept by as if
she didn't even lnear.

948
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,388
And that was the last
anyone ever saw of her.

949
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,890
Come on, lots more to see.

950
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,654
This is the gymnasium.

951
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:36,993
The exercise equipment is out of date.

952
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:41,434
This room demands a particular
form of exercise.

953
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:42,197
What ? How ?
It's the mirror library.

954
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:46,604
It's not in the plans.
I remember seeing it as a boy.

955
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:51,611
They're not in the plans?
How can it not be in the plans?

956
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:58,852
Here's a camera.

957
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:01,887
Not good. Not good at all.
"The property of IKevin Bollinger."

958
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:06,484
Mr. Bollinger, are you here?
What's wrong?

959
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:09,359
I said this might happen.
Just use your flashlights.

960
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:13,457
We should go back downstairs.
Nonsense.

961
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:18,061
Oh, my ! Look.

962
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:21,700
Steve, roll tape, roll tape!

963
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:26,713
Annie.

964
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:29,181
Annie, no.

965
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:34,187
Annie, don't touch it.

966
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:50,195
Annie, no!

967
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:53,263
Annie, come lnome.

968
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:55,400
Come with ne.

969
01:26:55,476 --> 01:27:00,413
Stop her! Somebody's got to stop her!

970
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:06,417
Are you okay?

971
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:11,424
How did you know to do that?
I don't know, I just did it.

972
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:47,726
Take it, I don't want it.
Here, give it to me.

973
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:52,732
Try and get some good
pictures of them being psychic.

974
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:59,233
What's that supposed to mean?

975
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:04,244
It's someone talking to Bollinger.

976
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:07,638
I bet I know who.
Is he alive? Can you tell?

977
01:28:07,715 --> 01:28:10,343
He was when he dropped this camera,
I don't know.

978
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:15,355
We ought to get out of here.

979
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:20,090
Okay, folks, let's head back
downstairs. Break time.

980
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:25,098
Thank God.

981
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:35,942
Wait.

982
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:42,044
It's not the same.

983
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:46,280
The hallway.
No, nonsense.

984
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:48,015
He's right. We're not going
the way we came.

985
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,421
What in heaven's name is that?
What's going on?

986
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:53,790
The building started again.
You wanted to wake the place up.

987
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:56,022
Now you got what you wanted.

988
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:58,327
Who's building, and what?
I don't know.

989
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:02,893
You're lying.

990
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,995
No, I'm not lying.

991
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:08,167
Is it too hard to remember?
Or too frightening to remember?

992
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:10,540
It's gone. It stopped.

993
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:15,548
I suggest we go downstairs
before it starts again.

994
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:20,886
Annie, I need your help.

995
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:24,049
Now put your hand here,
and push from here.

996
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:26,787
Annie, what are you doing?

997
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:28,954
Nick.
Not now, Joyce.

998
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:33,967
Annie!

999
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:42,466
That wasn't funny.

1000
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:45,307
Okay, I know another way down.
There might be something worth seeing.

1001
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,779
Are you sure you know the way?
Yes.

1002
01:29:46,848 --> 01:29:48,475
Oh, my God.

1003
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:52,076
"Oh, my God" is right.
More camouflaged doors, Stevie?

1004
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:54,144
Gram wasn't above using a trick twice.
This was a joke...

1005
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:59,159
...on her husband's business life.
Did he get it?

1006
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,523
I doubt it. I don't even
really get it.

1007
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:07,364
Here's the door right here.

1008
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,767
Just press right there.

1009
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:13,136
This house has everything but chow.

1010
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:15,334
Joyce, it's this way.

1011
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,344
Oh, of course, I knew that.

1012
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:22,349
Better, Emery?

1013
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:30,384
Than nothing, I guess.
Too much mayo in the crabmeat.

1014
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:35,395
What do you want?

1015
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:06,587
Bare breasted nymphs offering
delicacies from a silver platter?

1016
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:11,598
Stop it. Stop harassing me.

1017
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:57,511
Ever learn the difference
between joking and harassing?

1018
01:31:57,578 --> 01:32:00,206
I learned plenty in high school,
from guys like him, and you.

1019
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:03,717
Come on, give it a rest.

1020
01:32:03,784 --> 01:32:06,344
Emery, I may have something better
for you in a while.

1021
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:08,217
Tell us about the actress, Joyce.
I'm a sucker for celebrities.

1022
01:32:08,289 --> 01:32:10,382
Well, that's her, on Ellen's
wall of fame.

1023
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:13,791
Deanna Petrie...

1024
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:14,953
...was a fairly big star in the '40s.

1025
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:17,088
Musical conedies nostly.

1026
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:19,064
Slne could dance...

1027
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:22,193
...sing a little...

1028
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:23,601
...and slne was sexy as hell.

1029
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:27,573
She was one of Ellen's favorite guests
at her January 1 5th parties.

1030
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:32,579
In 1 946 she showed up in what Hedda
Hopper called "The Cocktail Dress."

1031
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:55,335
She was wearing it when
she disappeared.

1032
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:58,868
She spent the night here,
in the billiard room...

1033
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,875
...wowing guests with her many...

1034
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:06,880
...talents.

1035
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:49,122
She left behind a single earring.

1036
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:54,127
A maid found it, but there was
no girl to go with it.

1037
01:33:54,662 --> 01:33:59,599
Deanna's disappearance made
Rose Red's reputation.

1038
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:07,368
And now, Annie, if you've
finished eating...

1039
01:34:07,441 --> 01:34:12,378
...l have something to show you.

1040
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:34,698
It's nice.

1041
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:36,737
You'll like it. I promise.

1042
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:41,741
It's okay.

1043
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:46,846
Go up, Annie. Go up and see
what you find.

1044
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:26,879
It's not dangerous is it?
No, not a bit. Go on, Annie.

1045
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:38,458
You okay, son?

1046
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:45,531
Yeah. Sure, I'm fine.

1047
01:37:39,787 --> 01:37:42,153
Annie?

1048
01:37:42,756 --> 01:37:45,782
What in the world is it?

1049
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:50,797
Whatever it is, she likes it.

1050
01:38:04,278 --> 01:38:08,009
Cathy, you were right. Revelation 1 2.

1051
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:10,414
Oh, yeah.

1052
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:15,421
No corporal presence in six centuries.

1053
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:26,825
No psychic pulse.

1054
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:30,928
Emery, are you thinking of
dressing for dinner?

1055
01:38:31,005 --> 01:38:35,942
You tell me. Read my mind.

1056
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:42,075
Annie, Glenn Miller.

1057
01:38:42,149 --> 01:38:47,086
That doesn't work. I tried it
while I was setting up.

1058
01:38:48,889 --> 01:38:53,349
Sorry, Annie.

1059
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:58,364
Joyce?
It's all right.

1060
01:39:12,513 --> 01:39:15,641
Got three loaded for Reardon.
Large, with two six packs of soda.

1061
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:17,445
Thank you. I told you there'd be
something you'd like better.

1062
01:39:17,518 --> 01:39:20,544
Loaded. Excellent.

1063
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,418
Miss Asbury?

1064
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:25,253
May l?

1065
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:27,157
Okay.

1066
01:39:27,227 --> 01:39:32,164
Do this often?
Every chance we get. How much?

1067
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:36,765
This is some place. Is it haunted?
Yeah...

1068
01:39:36,837 --> 01:39:40,432
...by ghosts of delivery men who asked
stupid questions and never escaped.

1069
01:39:40,507 --> 01:39:43,271
This is unbelievable.
What are you doing to me?

1070
01:39:43,344 --> 01:39:45,869
She's terrific.

1071
01:39:45,946 --> 01:39:48,312
I wouldn't think you'd need a
telemetry readout to count heads.

1072
01:39:48,382 --> 01:39:51,510
Not human ones, certainly.

1073
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:54,110
I'm real worried about Mr. Bollinger.
Don't bother, he'll show up.

1074
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:57,624
I wish I was as sure of that as
you are. Where's Vic?

1075
01:39:57,691 --> 01:39:59,488
Right here. Anyone care to dance?

1076
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:01,687
Well, not me, I'm pooped.

1077
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:02,854
Where have you been?

1078
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:07,867
I lost my book.

1079
01:40:08,869 --> 01:40:13,465
It's story time. We've heard the one
about the actress...

1080
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:18,477
...tell us about Rimbauer's
partner, Mr. Posey.

1081
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:24,046
Remember that sance I spoke about?
Starring the gypsy psychic Cora Frye?

1082
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:28,578
Yes. That was 1 914...

1083
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:32,921
...and the war was heating up
the economy.

1084
01:40:32,993 --> 01:40:34,893
Omicron Oil was in clover.
Money was rolling in...

1085
01:40:34,962 --> 01:40:36,520
...and John Rimbauer was
tired of sharing.

1086
01:40:36,597 --> 01:40:40,294
In October of that year, he gave
Douglas Posey the bum's rush.

1087
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:42,267
According to family legend,
Uncle Posey had a taste for cowboys.

1088
01:40:42,336 --> 01:40:47,273
He liked chaps in chaps?

1089
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:49,468
Was he into roping or branding?
Probably a little bit of both.

1090
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:52,103
Rimbauer bought him out at
distressed sale prices.

1091
01:40:52,179 --> 01:40:56,445
He was told never to come back,
but he did, once.

1092
01:40:56,517 --> 01:41:01,454
That was in 1 91 5. John was in Europe,
and Adam and April were home with Mom.

1093
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:04,953
Granddad never forgot Posey
tossing him that Tom Mix hat of his.

1094
01:41:05,025 --> 01:41:09,962
He wanted it and threw a tantrum
when his mother tried to take it.

1095
01:41:15,836 --> 01:41:17,667
And he never forgot April
catching the rose.

1096
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:22,675
Why did Posey wait a year to do it?
And why here? Any ideas?

1097
01:41:24,044 --> 01:41:28,981
I don't have any answers.

1098
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:33,648
After the suicide, John and Ellen kept
Adam away as much as possible.

1099
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:38,657
He was at boarding school
when his sister disappeared.

1100
01:41:38,859 --> 01:41:43,796
He knew that something was
wrong here, even then.

1101
01:41:44,364 --> 01:41:48,596
The male descendants have
mostly stayed away.

1102
01:41:48,669 --> 01:41:53,606
I was here only a few times.
I got off on my own once. I was 8.

1103
01:41:55,008 --> 01:41:58,205
Your father

1104
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:00,246
He hated this place. He was afraid.
My mother brought me.

1105
01:42:00,314 --> 01:42:02,373
I forgot till today.
I blocked it out, I guess.

1106
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:05,111
Nick reminded ne. She probably
couldn't find a babysitter.

1107
01:42:05,185 --> 01:42:10,122
What was she loolking for?
Loot. I tlninlk slne was drunlk.

1108
01:42:10,924 --> 01:42:15,020
That's my nemory of it, but slne so
often was in tlnose days.

1109
01:42:15,095 --> 01:42:17,325
I lknow slne and Dad were brolke.

1110
01:42:17,397 --> 01:42:21,857
After we lost the oil company,
it's been a fanily disease.

1111
01:42:21,935 --> 01:42:22,993
Brolke itis.

1112
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:28,007
And while your mother
was treasure hunting, you got lost.

1113
01:42:28,408 --> 01:42:31,002
Yeah. It was no big deal, but

1114
01:42:31,078 --> 01:42:34,946
You were upstairs before you
realized how lost you were.

1115
01:42:35,015 --> 01:42:39,748
One floor above the mirror library.
Or was it three floors, or 10?

1116
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,414
When this place gets going
and feels lively...

1117
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:47,426
...when it has energy to use...

1118
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:54,900
...it can make itself
as big as it wants.

1119
01:42:55,502 --> 01:43:00,439
But you got to the top...

1120
01:43:03,143 --> 01:43:08,080
...and that's where....

1121
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:14,653
Oh, my God!

1122
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:21,686
What is it? Do you know?

1123
01:43:21,762 --> 01:43:26,461
It's a cluster manifestation
with elements like an earthquake.

1124
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:29,502
It's the house! It's coming alive!

1125
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:32,368
How many are there? Can you tell?

1126
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:37,376
Damn this thing!

1127
01:43:42,115 --> 01:43:47,052
I'm not so sure that there is
anyone here!

1128
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:52,558
I know that sounds crazy, but !

1129
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:10,131
Be gone!

1130
01:45:10,203 --> 01:45:12,000
Oh, Annie, don't touch it.

1131
01:45:12,072 --> 01:45:16,202
Go.
Annie.

1132
01:45:16,276 --> 01:45:18,301
Go ahead.

1133
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:21,313
Go.

1134
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:24,839
Annie, come.
