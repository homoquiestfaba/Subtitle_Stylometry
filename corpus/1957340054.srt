♪ I'll see you in my dreams ♪

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,542
How are you feeling now?

3
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:14,877
The same.

4
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:18,792
And the feelings of anxiety?

5
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:20,626
Dread?

6
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:23,919
The same.

7
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:27,919
All right. We'll give it a moment.

8
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:33,003
You said you could give me
something to help me relax.

9
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:34,419
I already have.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,377
You have?

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:43,087
Sometimes the medication affects
the perception of time.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,460
Things can become fluid.

13
00:00:49,753 --> 00:00:52,171
I understand you lost your wife recently.

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,960
Vehicular misadventure.

15
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:57,086
Is that what triggered your attempt?

16
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:07,212
She was the pin holding
everything in place.

17
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:12,545
When she left, it all
just started to unravel.

18
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:15,253
How so?

19
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:18,962
It just revealed what was already there.

20
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,380
What had been there for a long time.

21
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:25,963
What had always been there.

22
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,213
It was too much. I had to get away.

23
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:31,672
From what?

24
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:33,463
I don't know.

25
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:35,504
A feeling.

26
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:36,588
A feeling of what?

27
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:38,713
I don't know. I don't remember.

28
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,631
Oh god.

29
00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:44,924
You haven't been sleeping
since you came here.

30
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:47,633
I can't.

31
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:51,091
I'm afraid of where my
mind goes when I sleep.

32
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:52,632
A dream?

33
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:53,882
No.

34
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,175
It feels like a memory, but...

35
00:01:57,424 --> 00:01:58,508
Where does it take you?

36
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:00,925
Where are we going?

37
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:04,341
There's a town.

38
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,840
A town?

39
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:07,964
Tell me.

40
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:10,257
No.

41
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,008
The medication will help.

42
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:13,590
Let it relax you.

43
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,424
Surrender to it.

44
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,049
No. I don't want to.

45
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:18,341
Yes...

46
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,174
Remembering will set you free.

47
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:21,215
No, I don't...

48
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:23,218
We'll go there together.

49
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:27,259
Follow the sound of my voice.

50
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:31,510
Follow the sound of my voice.

51
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:32,801
Do we have to leave now?

52
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:35,926
Follow the sound of my voice.

53
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:39,926
Now...

54
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:43,469
Tell me the dream.

55
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:46,469
Tell me the first thing you remember.

56
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:47,926
My father...

57
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:49,551
Waking me up.

58
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,635
It's time to go.

59
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:53,386
Where are we going?

60
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:55,552
We're going to the carnival.

61
00:02:56,887 --> 00:02:58,428
It's so early.

62
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,803
Do we have to leave now?

63
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:02,720
Yes.

64
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:05,136
It's time.

65
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:09,177
Mother is still asleep.

66
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:11,221
She doesn't go with us.

67
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:17,055
And then we're on a train.

68
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,596
We're on a train for a long time.

69
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:28,013
Why is it so far?

70
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:31,430
The carnival is in another town.

71
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:34,304
We have to cross the border to get there.

72
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:37,970
What are we going to do at the carnival?

73
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,056
You'll see.

74
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:45,263
It's time...

75
00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:47,223
Tell me about the town.

76
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:48,806
No. I don't want to go.

77
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:50,555
You're already on the train.

78
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,765
You have no choice.

79
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:55,847
Tell me about the town.

80
00:03:57,097 --> 00:03:58,098
It's time.

81
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,264
Something about it feels familiar.

82
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,265
Like I've been here before.

83
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:08,889
Where's the carnival?

84
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,599
You'll see.

85
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:12,597
It revealed what was there...

86
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:14,139
What had always been there.

87
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,765
I see him everywhere.

88
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:20,264
It looks like there had
been some kind of carnival

89
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:22,308
or a street fair here at one time, but...

90
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:24,516
It's all falling apart...

91
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,010
and all the people are gone.

92
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,434
You'll see...

93
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:34,642
♪ I'll see you in my dreams ♪

94
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:40,517

95
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:44,394
Father's in a hurry for
us to get somewhere.

96
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:46,267
Where is he taking you?

97
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:48,767
There's a sideshow.

98
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,061
It's time...

99
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:10,977

♪ I'll see you in my dreams ♪

101
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,397
You're late.

102
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:53,939
The boy slowed me down. Always lingering.

103
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,178
That's to be expected. You
should have prepared better.

104
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:59,239
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:00,997
Well it doesn't really matter what I think.

106
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,772
They, on the other hand...

107
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,482
They were...

108
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:10,022
...grumbling.

109
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:11,605
So...

110
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:12,856
You ready?

111
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,648
What's going to happen to him?

112
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,524
It's a little late for that, isn't it?

113
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:19,829
What are you worried about? Look at him.

114
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,648
He's got the show.

115
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:26,482
The show will keep him occupied
for the rest of his life.

116
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,233
We better not keep them waiting any longer.

117
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:33,941
All right.

118
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:43,816
Dad!

119
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:14,234
Dad!

120
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:27,986
What happened next?

121
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:32,694
I don't remember.

122
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:38,378
- How did you get back home?
- I don't know.

123
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:39,612
And your father?

124
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:41,611
I never saw him again.

125
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:43,446
Your mother...

126
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,111
How did she react?

127
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:47,154
It was never spoken of.

128
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,153
And then...

129
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,028
There was a mental illness.

130
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:54,380
They took her to live at the hospital.

131
00:07:55,237 --> 00:07:59,238
And it's this memory
that's been haunting you?

132
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:01,987
No.

133
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:05,655
Not the memory.

134
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,155
I've been seeing him.

135
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:09,863
Who have you been seeing?

136
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:11,863
The showman.

137
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:15,323
At first he was just a glimmer
in the corner of my eye.

138
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:16,738
But now...

139
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,655
Now he's right there.

140
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:19,780
Everywhere.

141
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:25,198
I see him everywhere.

142
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:28,323
Would you like another sedative?

143
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:29,614
No.

144
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:31,155
It won't matter.

145
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:33,030
He won't go away.

146
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:35,490
You can't numb him away.

147
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,448
I'll just wake up and
he'll still be there...

148
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:39,781
And one day...

149
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:41,572
He's going to turn around

150
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:43,531
and I'm going to see his face.

151
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:44,531
Mr. Hatcher-

152
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,616
You're all going to see his face.

153
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,824
You're all going to see everything.

154
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:56,617
Mr. Hatcher...
