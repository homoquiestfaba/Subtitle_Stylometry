1
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:16,529
Justin, please come in.

2
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,950
Welcome. Wow,

3
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,953
you're more beautiful than your picture.

4
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:28,082
Oh, thanks for the wine.

5
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,881
It's a beautiful house.

6
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,177
Far as heck, but it's wonderful.

7
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,886
Well, sometimes a man

8
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,266
needs to get away to enjoy a little privacy.

9
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,352
Excuse my accent.

10
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,063
English is not my first language.

11
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,076
I just picked up bits from people from all walks of life.

12
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,580
But I understand it
better than I speak. It

13
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:34,565
I've been here for quite some time.

14
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,900
What a wonderful table.

15
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,488
What a wonderful guest.

16
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:48,661
So this is your catch

17
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,416
You show the sunset to everyone you bring here.

18
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,423
No one's made it this far into the house.

19
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,799
Should I be scared?

20
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,220
Or is that a compliment?

21
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,430
You tell me.

22
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,529
I thought you were bluffing
about a painting thing.

23
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,865
Well,

24
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,037
You are going to have to wait and see, when I'm finished,

25
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,040
won't you?

26
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,418
You can put your drink down.

27
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,761
Oh, could you stand up for me?

28
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,748
All right. You could sit

29
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,232
Staring,

30
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,819
being stared at...

31
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,164
anything is possible.

32
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,155
Do you mind?

33
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,124
You'll forgive an old man.

34
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,367
Did you paint this?

35
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,494
Don’t move.

36
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,853
Excuse me for a minute.

37
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,247
You picked the wrong night to come visit.

38
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,581
Oh, pest control.

39
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,920
I hate to hear them suffer.

40
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,259
Come on, dinner's ready.

41
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,970
Did I mention that I'm vegan?

42
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,055
like, 100 times?

43
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,852
You know how difficult it is
to make a vegan lasagna.

44
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,979
So you went to college?

45
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,645
Yes.

46
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,274
What for?

47
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,691
Data Analisis.

48
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,153
Wow, sounds fancy

49
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,922
Then you can read human behavior
and know I'm telling the truth.

50
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:14,799
Wow,

51
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,802
What a diligent little vegan you are.

52
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,681
You lied to me.

53
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,309
You told me you work advising
companies,

54
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,104
Consulting.

55
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,563
Same thing.

56
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,855
And that's what I do.

57
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,318
I work analyzing personal data to sell it

58
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:37,447
to private companies
so they can better direct their marketing.

59
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,366
a new twist to an old trick.

60
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,870
So tell me more.

61
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,418
Oh, oh

62
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,340
you did your homework and stalked me.

63
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,632
I get it.

64
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,137
A young, vulnerable boy
like you and go off 200 miles

65
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,889
without doing a little research.

66
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,351
Right?

67
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,019
You're right.

68
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,604
I don't like social media.

69
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,772
I'm not interested.

70
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:15,026
I'm interested in real people. So

71
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,196
tell me more about you.

72
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,532
Looks like I'm not the only stalker here.

73
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,826
Hey, speak for yourself.

74
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:28,206
I'm not the one who works
selling other people's personal data

75
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,465
<i>David,</i>

76
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,135
I have to go.

77
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,391
I just got a message from a friend

78
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,979
asking me to take his dog

79
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:00,822
Yeah.

80
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,574
All right.

81
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,578
You should go help your friend

82
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,630
I hope you invite me again.

83
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,758
I hope you can come back again soon

84
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,388
Don’t you want to wait for your ride here?

85
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,435
There are some restless raccoons out there.

86
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,188
I’ll wait for the ride outside.

87
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,066
All right.

88
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,408
Can I have a hug?

89
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,911
Of course.

90
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,548
What a gorgeous boy you are.

91
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,635
So sweet.

92
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,807
What a beautiful face.

93
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,394
Thanks for dinner.

94
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,147
I'll see you soon.

95
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,525
No, no, no.

96
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,443
Hey, hey, hey.

97
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,864
Just stay for a little while longer.

98
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,700
Just a little while.

99
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,743
David, I have to go now.

100
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,828
Just a little while.

101
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,457
I have money if you want.

102
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,378
Model's get paid.

103
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,632
Help!

104
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,467
No one can hear you.

105
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,430
Is that what you learned in grad school?

106
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,433
What do you want from me?

107
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,607
You promised something too

108
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,988
Come on.

109
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,117
You want it

110
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,384
I'm sorry.

111
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,638
I just want to get to know you better.

112
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,727
There's

113
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,690
something in your eyes I.

114
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,195
I really like you.

115
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,072
Don't fuck it up.

116
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,533
And if you go,

117
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,037
how do I know if I'll ever see you again?

118
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,706
I guess you want to have to trust me.

119
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,207
Trust you,

120
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,625
jeez!

121
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,004
I hope your friend's dog is all right.

122
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,134
You going to have to earn that trust.

123
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,805
Look,

124
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,141
let's finish the painting,

125
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,935
and I promise we'll figure this out.

126
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,314
Please.

127
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,286
Everything all right in there?

128
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,542
Can you give me an estimate?

129
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,878
Not long.

130
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,047
As long as

131
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,634
as long as you

132
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:16,554
stop talking and hold your fucking pose.

133
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,858
This isn't working.

134
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,987
I think you should spend the night
and we can finish this tomorrow.

135
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,490
We just talked about this.

136
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,538
Justin, I need you to spend the night,
and we could finish this tomorrow.

137
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,997
David! No more promises.

138
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:45,834
Let me go now.

139
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,585
I'm just letting you go in the middle
of the night with a stranger to Miami.

140
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,089
It's not safe.

141
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,505
I hope you have a wonderful night.

142
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,468
Thanks for a lovely date.

143
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,344
It's almond milk.

144
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,810
I could show you the carton, but

145
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,701
Can I use the restroom.

146
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,869
Sure.

147
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:30,707
I'm sorry.

148
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,124
I have to.

149
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,481
Oh, I'll wait outside.

150
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,201
Wait for me here.

151
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,472
Let's go to work. I

152
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,943
I hate it when people bite their nails

153
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,911
so unattractive.

154
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,546
I used to tell my son, Don't bite
your nails.

155
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,174
It's a sign of weakness.

156
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,849
You also kept him locked up?

157
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,604
Only to protect him from himself.

158
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:59,456
I’m going to put some honey in your team, is that okay?

159
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,171
It’s organic.

160
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:29,988
I've seen hunger strikes before.

161
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:35,618
They're usually for bigger causes.

162
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,875
They almost never work.

163
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:14,008
No respectable woman would dance it.

164
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:45,934
May I see your hands?

165
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,991
People can't handle freedom,

166
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,577
sometimes

167
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,581
you have to learn the hard way.

168
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,013
We're out of organic honey.

169
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,102
I don't put anything in my tea.

170
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:02,969
Where are they?

171
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,311
How long have you been a vegan?

172
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,648
Almost three years.

173
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,319
Let me ask you a personal question.

174
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,197
Please tell me the truth.

175
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,200
What do you really like to eat

176
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,160
when no one's watching?

177
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,959
There's that smile.

178
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,504
How old is your son?

179
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,718
Probably around your age.

180
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,970
That's so cliche.

181
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:48,471
No.

182
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:49,599
No.

183
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,145
Besides,

184
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:59,859
don't pretend that's not what turned you on
when you saw my picture on the app.

185
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,785
What's wrong with your dad?
Did he leave you or something?

186
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,578
What about my dad?

187
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,789
No, nothing.

188
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,001
Anyway,

189
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,087
my dad's an asshole.

190
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:22,965
He was a diplomat.

191
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,885
Allways too busy to pay attention to me.

192
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,013
That proves my point, Jay.

193
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:43,319
Go get me the fertilizer from the shelf around the corner, please.

194
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,715
Where did you find this?

195
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,430
Where does that sexy accent come from?

196
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,935
From somewhere between Patagonia and Río Bravo.

197
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,771
I think you're exaggerating.

198
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,817
What about Brazil?

199
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,527
You speak Portuguese?

200
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:29,490
You are so full of yourself,

201
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,502
What did you say?

202
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,131
I understood something
about the Carnival.

203
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:59,937
<i>Vickie. Ahhh, Vickie. </i>

204
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,317
Meet the only woman in my life.

205
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:11,531
Well,
she's been in captivity for... Pretty Bird.

206
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:12,659
Pretty Bird.

207
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,536
What? You are a pretty bird.

208
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:20,250
She's been in captivity 30 years,
but she's only been with me for 15.

209
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,003
This old man
I used to know died and left her to me.

210
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,129
Ahh...

211
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,133
How old is she?

212
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,009
Older than you.

213
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,556
Oh. Huh. Okay, Vicky.

214
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:37,183
Vicky, let's not make a little pick of
ourselves.

215
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:37,892
<i>No...</i>

216
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:39,102
<i>Ssshhh</i>

217
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:44,190
Hey, our guest is going to think
we're a bunch of

218
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:40,955
Hand me the the bottle opener in the left drawer.

219
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:57,555
Did you find it?

220
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:20,870
more salad?

221
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,331
No, no, I'm fine.

222
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,256
What?

223
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,686
are your parents divorced?

224
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,564
No, why?

225
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:49,899
I don’t know.

226
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:54,153
You seemed like the only child of divorced parents

227
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:59,367
Are you trying to profile me again?

228
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,665
<i>B</i>ut yes,<i> </i>

229
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,751
I'm an only child.

230
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:11,379
You see...

231
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:29,480
My problem wasn’t that my parents had a bad relationship
with each other.

232
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:33,442
They just lived in a completely
different world than I did.

233
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,696
Or maybe you lived in
a different world from them.

234
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,032
Maybe.

235
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:43,202
But I was the one being a teenager.

236
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,957
Was it really that hard?

237
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,002
It was for me.

238
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:59,009
When I was 12,

239
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,264
we moved to a consulate in Buenos Aires.

240
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:06,142
I met the son of one of the diplomats.

241
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,601
<i>Oh, oh.</i>

242
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:12,064
Every afternoon we would get out

243
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:14,859
and wander around the consulate’s garden.

244
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,697
Since it was winter.

245
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:21,699
There was no one else outside.

246
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:23,159
<i>Umm...</i>

247
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:46,640
I was almost naked

248
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,143
But didn't feel cold.

249
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:55,524
What did your mother do?

250
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,667
That night

251
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:18,380
She came into my room to have a talk.

252
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:22,384
She said that she understood

253
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,180
I could feel attracted to people
from the same sex as me,

254
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:28,140
and that was Ok.

255
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:31,810
She said

256
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:35,523
that my dad would understand too.

257
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:57,586
You have no idea how releaved I was.

258
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:09,640
I know.

259
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,815
People search for that
feeling their whole lives.

260
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:21,193
I'll let you know when I find it.

261
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,369
But too good to be true,

262
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:04,862
Well,

263
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:10,200
At least you didn’t have one of those dads

264
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:15,497
that kicks you out of the house to throw you in the military.

265
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:23,255
Where you're one of those dads?

266
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:38,312
What does your tattoo mean?

267
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:41,607
I was wondering when you'd ask me
about that.

268
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:43,858
It's a big secret.

269
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,488
Some Arab boy in Afghanistan
talked me into getting one.

270
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:50,658
And I thought, what do I want on my back
for the rest my life?

271
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:53,786
I thought of a Hemingway quote that says

272
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,579
Every story

273
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:59,750
if played long enough,

274
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,378
always ends in death,

275
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,601
How much older?

276
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:20,062
Trouble.

277
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:23,565
I'm all ears.

278
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:04,774
Jesus Christ.

279
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,662
Well, what happened?

280
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,752
He looked at his dick

281
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:27,297
then he looked at me and he said

282
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:29,591
You wanna to help me out?

283
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:32,385
And I did.

284
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,805
He didn't force you?

285
00:42:36,556 --> 00:42:37,849
No.

286
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:40,268
And why did you do it?

287
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:43,938
Because I want it.

288
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,903
You were too young
to know what you wanted.

289
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:53,573
I was young, not stupid.

290
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,460
Still, he should have known better.

291
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,631
You're right.

292
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:16,554
Then what happened?

293
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:24,479
My friend's mom came
home and we had dinner.

294
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:30,276
It didn't bother you
being around him after that?

295
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:32,487
No, not at all.

296
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:34,989
Honey.

297
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,993
The guy was a fucking pedophile

298
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:41,246
maybe

299
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:06,437
Fancy, huh?

300
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:17,615
You like to play the old man on the sea?

301
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:23,288
<i>D</i>on’t tell me

302
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:26,875
this offends your vegan sensibilities.

303
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,300
Well...

304
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,804
Who they couldn't survive

305
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:42,891
was Mikey.

306
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:46,227
He wasn't the best caretaker.

307
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:01,326
<i>Ahh...</i>

308
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:03,369
Did they all commit suicide?

309
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:08,541
I'm just saying.

310
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:17,050
Now you tell me.

311
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,179
Why doesn't a sexy, young

312
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:24,973
Okay, a little cocky guy like you

313
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:28,353
not have a boyfriend or girlfriend

314
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:32,440
or whatever the fuck you kids
call yourselves these days.

315
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:44,410
Well, he doesn't seem
to be very worried about you.

316
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:48,790
Give me my phone.

317
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,210
Let me check for myself.

318
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,046
<i>No. </i>

319
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:57,173
Trust me,

320
00:45:57,924 --> 00:45:59,801
he doesn't care.

321
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:31,995
Can I borrow another shirt?

322
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:33,412
Sure.

323
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:46,300
How do I look?

324
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,640
Like an eighties movie

325
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:55,977
Come here.

326
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:58,604
Let's find something better
for you.

327
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:19,041
Talent runs in the family.

328
00:50:30,905 --> 00:50:35,993
Sorry. I don't know how to make pancakes
without eggs and real milk.

329
00:50:38,037 --> 00:50:39,205
I won't eat.

330
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:41,123
You don't have to eat it.

331
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,793
But I can help you

332
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:46,252
Put some sirup on it.

333
00:50:46,254 --> 00:50:47,213
No, I’m good.

334
00:50:47,213 --> 00:50:48,756
You’ll like it.

335
00:51:00,977 --> 00:51:01,853
No, no, no.

336
00:51:01,853 --> 00:51:03,896
Keep your shirt on.

337
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:50,151
I wanted a dog.

338
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:52,945
But my parents would only let me have fish.

339
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:03,539
Well, I understand them perfectly.

340
00:52:12,131 --> 00:52:13,758
They're just borrowed.

341
00:52:16,302 --> 00:52:18,638
Everything is borrowed, don’t you think?

342
00:52:18,638 --> 00:52:20,890
I mean, our bodies,

343
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:25,144
we use them until they fall apart.

344
00:52:25,144 --> 00:52:29,357
Or some asshole hunter comes along
and shoots you in your prime,

345
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:32,526
stuffs you and hangs you on his wall.

346
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:34,528
Right, Bambi?

347
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:08,396
He was about seven,

348
00:53:08,396 --> 00:53:11,190
and he started having anxiety attacks.

349
00:53:12,775 --> 00:53:15,861
We took him to this really expensive
psychiatrist

350
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:19,448
who said, Buy him a fucking fish tank.

351
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:21,242
He'll come down.

352
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:27,623
He spent hours just

353
00:53:27,665 --> 00:53:29,542
watching the fish.

354
00:53:38,217 --> 00:53:41,011
Did you order the goldfish?

355
00:53:46,017 --> 00:53:47,726
You like it?

356
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:51,564
Wanna try it?

357
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:54,275
Come on, put your hand on there.

358
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:56,235
Yeah. C’mon.

359
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:08,164
You're doing so well.

360
00:54:08,164 --> 00:54:10,499
You've been on a boat before.

361
00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:21,927
Nothing gives you a greater sense of freedom
than the ocean.

362
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:24,430
Freedom is just a concept.

363
00:54:24,847 --> 00:54:26,557
Philosopher.

364
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:30,603
It's nice to see people
sometimes, isn't it?

365
00:54:30,603 --> 00:54:31,145
Just like that.

366
00:54:31,145 --> 00:54:34,482
You say hello and you don't think
you're the only one left

367
00:54:37,902 --> 00:54:39,778
People suck.

368
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:44,325
You know that, right? Huh?

369
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,743
Fish on.

370
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:02,843
You have a good dinner tonight.

371
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:08,516
I don't know.

372
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:11,310
You know what I learned in Afghanistan?

373
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:15,147
When you have a life in your hands
and you can just easily snuff it out...

374
00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:22,488
saving a life feels just as good

375
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,739
that sometimes

376
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:26,825
the choice.

377
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:42,091
<i>Go.</i>

378
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:52,810
You see,

379
00:55:53,895 --> 00:55:56,228
she knows freedom could kill her,

380
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,148
pretty bird.

381
00:56:00,193 --> 00:56:02,653
Animals, unlike people

382
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:04,863
know when they have it good.

383
00:56:09,243 --> 00:56:11,245
I heard that excuse before.

384
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,958
Really? Well, enlighten me, please.

385
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:31,473
Thank you for putting me in
that selected group of personalities.

386
00:56:48,282 --> 00:56:50,409
Couldn't have hid it my whole life.

387
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,038
What did he say.

388
00:57:01,295 --> 00:57:05,466
When his mother and I first separated.

389
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:10,679
I tried to be the best dad I could be.

390
00:57:20,064 --> 00:57:21,148
So

391
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:24,485
I feel bad

392
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:25,862
for ruining his childhood.

393
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:28,072
So I just

394
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,910
never said no to him.

395
00:57:34,412 --> 00:57:37,039
One day his mother called me hysterical,

396
00:57:37,623 --> 00:57:41,293
said that he'd been sneaking
out of the house at night and that

397
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:44,005
she thought he was using drugs.

398
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:46,507
And I told her she was

399
00:57:47,258 --> 00:57:49,551
being paranoid.

400
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,889
She locked him in his room,
She locked the doors and the windows and

401
00:57:55,683 --> 00:57:57,685
it didn’t work.

402
00:57:59,937 --> 00:58:01,647
He got out.

403
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:09,571
You have to give people a reason to stay.

404
00:58:11,407 --> 00:58:13,283
Where is he then?

405
00:58:34,932 --> 00:58:36,349
<i>Maroon</i>

406
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:36,975
<i>Coffe</i>

407
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:38,435
<i>Castaño</i>

408
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,730
<i>Chocolate</i>

409
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:45,525
Brown.

410
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,424
One of my favorite moments

411
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,219
was standing behind a window.

412
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:16,514
and watching the rain fell

413
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:12,922
It was nice to feel noticed,

414
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:17,260
I guess, even though

415
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:21,556
there was something wrong about it.

416
01:01:24,393 --> 01:01:25,894
Fuck.

417
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:27,812
Help!

418
01:01:36,947 --> 01:01:38,156
Be quiet!

419
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:39,406
Shut up!

420
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:40,700
Shut up!

421
01:01:44,162 --> 01:01:46,081
I said leave her by the front door.

422
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:47,999
Well, I don't have time right now.

423
01:01:47,999 --> 01:01:49,876
Come on. This fish are going to die.

424
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:51,836
Fish are in fucking water

425
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,977
Crocks will have a nice dinner tonight.

426
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,483
We can fix this.

427
01:02:54,483 --> 01:02:55,650
Can we?

428
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:58,027
You and I know,

429
01:02:58,653 --> 01:03:02,240
You and I know there's going to be consequences.

430
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,493
You can't keep me here forever.

431
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:06,201
Yeah, I fucking can.

432
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:09,831
What do you think this is
some kind of fucking little game, huh?

433
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:10,832
You're right.

434
01:03:10,832 --> 01:03:11,458
This is not a game.

435
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:12,250
This is a kidnaping.

436
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,835
I’m not fucking kidnaping you!

437
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:15,251
Yes you are!

438
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:18,923
You want to believe that I am enjoying your company.

439
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:27,140
You are such a fucking little liar.

440
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:31,436
You are a sad man.

441
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:34,397
-Who is using me to solve his shitty trauma,
-Shut up!

442
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:36,858
-with his fucking junkie son.
-Shut up!

443
01:03:39,945 --> 01:03:41,613
¡No, no!

444
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:43,072
¿No?

445
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:03,760
You're a fucking dick.

446
01:04:04,427 --> 01:04:06,471
An you are fucking Loco!

447
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:58,022
Good China is for guests.

448
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,616
You're right.

449
01:05:09,826 --> 01:05:11,577
I've been lying to you.

450
01:05:16,499 --> 01:05:19,252
My father was never against me being gay.

451
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:21,379
Shut the fuck up.

452
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:31,556
You carry on your own problems.

453
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,476
I don't have an explanation for

454
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:36,727
why I'm attracted to older men

455
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:41,274
or why I did the things I did.

456
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:55,538
This is not the best version of me, but

457
01:06:04,422 --> 01:06:06,424
Is that the story today?

458
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,804
You know what I think?

459
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:14,849
I think you need a better education.

460
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:16,934
So

461
01:06:18,186 --> 01:06:19,979
read a fucking book.

462
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:27,278
¡David!

463
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:30,823
Open the fucking door!

464
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,491
¡David!

465
01:06:39,749 --> 01:06:42,627
Help! Help!

466
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:15,988
David! I’m still here!

467
01:12:59,837 --> 01:13:04,466
You know why you would never be able
to finish painting that portrait?

468
01:13:11,432 --> 01:13:13,851
Because you're looking for something

469
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:15,728
that you will not find.

470
01:13:16,521 --> 01:13:21,108
If you want to continue psychoanalyzing me,
I can leave you alone for a little while longer.

471
01:13:52,265 --> 01:13:54,141
Is he dead?

472
01:13:58,729 --> 01:14:00,064
David,

473
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,276
Is he dead?

474
01:14:23,254 --> 01:14:26,173
After four years of living with me,

475
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,051
Mike ran away.

476
01:14:37,518 --> 01:14:41,520
One day he showed up on my doorstep

477
01:14:41,522 --> 01:14:43,607
with nothing but the shirt on his back.

478
01:14:54,285 --> 01:14:56,036
When I opened the door,

479
01:14:57,705 --> 01:14:59,874
It was the ghost

480
01:14:59,874 --> 01:15:01,584
of Mike

481
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,336
standing there,

482
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:10,677
More horrible than anything I ever saw in the war.

483
01:15:15,515 --> 01:15:17,308
Couldn't believe it was him.

484
01:15:23,523 --> 01:15:25,024
We just stood there

485
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:30,447
staring at each other,

486
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,870
He’s been living on the streets
in San Francisco.

487
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:40,039
And this friend of his, he was

488
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:49,758
His friend died next to him of an overdose
so he decided to come home.

489
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:58,308
He asked me if he could stay with me
for a little while,

490
01:15:59,643 --> 01:16:01,394
and I said, Of course, Mikey

491
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:04,981
This is your home.

492
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:13,323
He said that

493
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,122
that he thought that

494
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:21,998
I would take him in.

495
01:16:25,168 --> 01:16:26,211
<i>Fuck!</i>

496
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:33,510
He thought so little of me,

497
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,303
He thought I would

498
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:39,808
turn away my dying son.

499
01:16:53,572 --> 01:16:55,323
Those few days I,

500
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:02,205
I read him books,

501
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,043
told him stories

502
01:17:07,502 --> 01:17:09,587
about him as a kid.

503
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,632
I told him about

504
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:16,302
how his mother and I first met

505
01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:18,972
and I told him

506
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:24,978
how proud I was

507
01:17:26,938 --> 01:17:28,982
to have him as a son.

508
01:17:42,662 --> 01:17:44,414
And I told him how much

509
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,167
I loved him.

510
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,590
I didn't even know

511
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:56,467
I didn't even know how much

512
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:00,472
until that time together.

513
01:18:00,472 --> 01:18:02,724
And I just

514
01:18:06,978 --> 01:18:09,981
I was just trying to catch up for lost
time,

515
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:12,108
you know,

516
01:18:12,484 --> 01:18:13,943
And I

517
01:18:17,864 --> 01:18:20,617
we even fixed this fucking fish tank

518
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,453
and filled it with fish.

519
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:28,791
But he was

520
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,294
he was so skinny.

521
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:38,426
So I, I cooked for him and I...

522
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:41,471
I fed him and I

523
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:46,726
I made him pancakes like when he was a little boy,

524
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:01,783
But he was lying to me.

525
01:19:07,747 --> 01:19:11,960
One night I found him alone on the floor.

526
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:15,213
He...

527
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:19,592
He was shaking and

528
01:19:22,345 --> 01:19:25,265
he could barely control
the trembling in his hands

529
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:28,226
and was leaning up against the wall

530
01:19:30,604 --> 01:19:32,230
Hugging his knees,

531
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:35,316
like he used to when he was a baby.

532
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:42,740
He’s been fucking using.

533
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:49,454
It didn't matter what I did,
I couldn't control him.

534
01:19:49,456 --> 01:19:50,456
And so

535
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:55,586
He...

536
01:19:57,005 --> 01:19:59,632
he begged me to give him some dope

537
01:20:01,259 --> 01:20:03,011
and so I,

538
01:20:08,975 --> 01:20:10,893
I knew he was really sick.

539
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,730
I knew

540
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:18,109
I had to get him help, but

541
01:20:18,443 --> 01:20:20,486
I couldn't.

542
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:26,284
I couldn't bring myself to take him, you know.

543
01:20:26,284 --> 01:20:29,496
I didn't have a heart for it,
so I just gave him some sleeping pills.

544
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:33,208
And then I just sat on the floor with him
singing a Tango,

545
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:36,711
one my father used to sing to me.

546
01:20:37,837 --> 01:20:39,255
and then

547
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:43,634
we both fell asleep on the floor,

548
01:20:45,178 --> 01:20:47,472
his little head on my shoulder.

549
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:52,602
And I knew in the morning
I had to take him to the clinic.

550
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:00,860
When he woke up,

551
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:06,240
he was gone.

552
01:21:13,707 --> 01:21:15,458
I so I don't know.

553
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:18,044
I don't know

554
01:21:21,339 --> 01:21:23,341
I don't know if he is dead.

555
01:21:23,341 --> 01:21:26,594
But whatever he fucking is is my fault.

556
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,876
It wasn't your fault.

557
01:22:00,503 --> 01:22:04,090
You did what you thought was the right thing to do.

558
01:22:23,902 --> 01:22:27,321
I’m not here because my father
gave me a bad education.

559
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:34,036
If something happened to me,
