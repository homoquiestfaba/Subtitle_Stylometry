1
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,900
Bring in the prisoner.

2
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,300
Creegan must die.

3
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,980
Creegan must die.

4
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,660
Creegan must die.
Creegan must die.

5
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,340
Creegan must die.

6
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,220
In uniting the underlords and
reestablishing law and order,

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,940
I vowed that all remnants
of the lawlessness

8
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,740
that preceded would
be utterly wiped out.

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,860
Its memory alone would be
enough of a reminder

10
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,220
and a deterrent.

11
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,620
So after reviewing
the charges before me,

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,180
charges of crimes
against humanity and mutantity

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,860
for blatant complicity
with the Bailies,

14
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,500
I have no choice
but to condemn the defendant

15
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,340
to death.

16
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,980
That's right.

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,300
Bring it on.

18
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,380
May your evil die
with you as well.

19
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,940
I'm glad to see Marla
stand true to her word.

20
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,420
A little law and order
might be...

21
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,900
just what
we need down here.

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,380
Cleo, cheer up.
This is a good thing.

23
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,500
Since when is an execution
a good thing?

24
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,860
Don't waste your compassion
on Creegan, Cleo.

25
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,900
Believe me, he wouldn't
return the sentiment.

26
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,460
See, back in my time, when
people didn't believe in things...

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,700
they went out with signs
and protested them.

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,420
Now you just blast 'em.

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,780
Listen, despite the dozens of people
that wanted to, nobody blasted Creegan.

30
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,700
That's right.
He was tried and found guilty.

31
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,980
So, what, you didn't believe in
punishing criminals in your day?

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,420
No, I don't believe
in capital punishment,

33
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,020
executing criminals.

34
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,700
So, if a criminal is found
guilty as charged...

35
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,700
Right. Exactly.

36
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,140
If they get the right criminal
and not some innocent guy...

37
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,980
which has been known
to happen, you know.

38
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,500
And that's not even talking
about the barbaric side

39
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,380
of strapping somebody
to an electric chair

40
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,580
and then frying them.

41
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,660
It's gross.

42
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,340
Sarge, there's a situation in
the maximum detention block.

43
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,060
Voice, do you think maybe
you can give me a signal

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,860
when you're gonna
shout in my ear?

45
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,980
Get used to it.

46
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,820
No, I don't wanna
get used to it.

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,940
Voice, when are you and Hel
gonna kiss and make up

48
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,020
so you can get back in
her head where you belong?

49
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,540
When I feel Hel is ready.

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,900
In the meantime, Sarge,
you're acting team leader

51
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,020
and there is a situation
in the detention block.

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,340
It's Creegan.

53
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,580
Creegan?

54
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,980
Creegan?

55
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,620
Come on, this way.
Surround the perimeter.

56
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,260
Come on, move it.

57
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,060
We put him back
in his cell.

58
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,420
He said
he wasn't feeling well.

59
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,180
The oldest trick
in the book.

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,500
We had to drop the force
field to run a bio-scan.

61
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,780
He got a hold
of the med tech

62
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,060
before we could throw
a force field at him.

63
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,460
Creegan insisted
on talking to Hel.

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,260
Voice says Creegan's
only gonna talk to you, Hel.

65
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,580
Hello, Hel.

66
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,460
Okay, Creegan.
Let's get this over with.

67
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,700
You have an appointment
to keep.

68
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,580
Oh, yes, my execution.

69
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,540
I must admit, I thought
the sentence a little extreme.

70
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,260
Can you imagine me dead?

71
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,020
Yes, many times.

72
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,980
What do you want?

73
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,660
It's what you want, Helen.

74
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,340
Would you really have me
let loose of this mortal coil

75
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,060
without me revealing
all my secrets?

76
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,740
Don't listen to him, Hel.

77
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
It's just another one
of his sick mind screws.

78
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,900
That's right, Helen.
It's just a mind game.

79
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,100
What can I
possibly know about Voice?

80
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,860
Nothing.
I don't wanna play anymore.

81
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,820
I'm tired
of the way you weave

82
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,780
your sick little lies
with bits of truth.

83
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm not interested.

84
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,220
Take what you know
to the grave.

85
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,380
As you wish.

86
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,780
Personally, I'd want to know
why Voice has chosen me,

87
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,180
to fight her private
little war with the Bailies.

88
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,900
Let him go first.

89
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,300
Thanks for playing.

90
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,260
Wait.

91
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,260
Hel.

92
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,740
I'm listening.

93
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,940
From the day you woke up
with that Voice in your head,

94
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,460
you've wondered
haven't you, Helen?

95
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,940
Who is she, really?

96
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,380
And why does she show such
a particular interest in you?

97
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,020
Sarge, stop this now.

98
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,620
Hel, get back.

99
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,700
What do you know?

100
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,980
Everything.

101
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,460
Oh!

102
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,980
That's my body.

103
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,860
You're a dead man,
Creegan.

104
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
No! Wait.

105
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,260
Sarge.

106
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,100
Hel, are you okay?

107
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,420
I'm fine, Cleopatra.
No harm done.

108
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,500
What did he say to you?

109
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,460
I'm not who you think I am.

110
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,820
Forget it.

111
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,300
He's mad.

112
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,300
Five hundred years
into the future,

113
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,620
she will enter a world
where machines rule the Earth.

114
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,820
Mankind has been driven
underground.

115
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,380
And Cleopatra
is about to discover

116
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,060
there's no place like home.

117
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,980
"In the year 2525"

118
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,700

00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,780

126
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,100
Oh, yeah.

127
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,740
Oh, I need a drink.

128
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,980
Hey, cup of mash.

129
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,820
Cup of mash.

130
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,940
A glass of 103-Level mash
to settle my nerves.

131
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,980
I think I'd need something
to settle my stomach

132
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,580
if Creegan kissed me
like that.

133
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,340
It'd almost be worth a shot
of the hard stuff

134
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,420
just to wash the taste
out of your mouth.

135
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,940
You're
uncharacteristically quiet

136
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,460
on the subject, Voice.

137
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,540
How do you feel
about your old friend Creegan

138
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,940
taking his
last foul breath? Hmm?

139
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,700
You hear the question, Voice?

140
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,260
Tell Hel I'm pleased justice
is being served.

141
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,660
Voice says justice
is served, the usual.

142
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,260
You know,
that must be tough,

143
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,660
having had the Voice
in your head for so long

144
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,740
and then all of a sudden
she's gone.

145
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,860
Gone?

146
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,940
Oh, yes, it is.

147
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,380
You don't understand.

148
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,820
Creegan has escaped
in my body.

149
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,020
I mean, Hel's body.

150
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,260
I need to talk to my team.

151
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,740
I wouldn't believe me, either.

152
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,820
Nice ploy, Creegan.

153
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,740
The old "body switch. "
I've got to try that one.

154
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,660
Hey, hey,

155
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,900
somebody stole my body!

156
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,940
You've got the wrong guy.
I swear!

157
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,540
It's me, Creegan, Tox.

158
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
Tox?

159
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,020
We go way back.

160
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,340
The B-factories,
the tunnel wars,

161
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,100
the first-ever
multilevel peace talks.

162
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,860
The ones that
crashed and burned.

163
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,900
You were behind
that blood bath?

164
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,140
You and Creegan? You and me?

165
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,900
Those were the days.

166
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,340
It's gonna be hard
to imagine the underground

167
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,060
after they
demolecularize your ass.

168
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,220
Thanks.

169
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,260
Yeah.

170
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,140
Without you around
to shake things up,

171
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,700
Hel and her like are gonna
have the run of the place.

172
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,780
Tox, I'm getting out.

173
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,380
Do you understand,

174
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,380
you sorry excuse
for a human life form?

175
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,660
And you're gonna help me.

176
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,420
You really going down there
to protest

177
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,620
Creegan's execution?

178
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,780
Yup.

179
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,900
I'm sorry, Hel. I know that
Creegan killed your dad,

180
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,060
but I have to stand
by my convictions.

181
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,980
Knock yourself out,
Cleopatra.

182
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,940
Cleo, wait up.

183
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,740
Are you going to help me
with the protest?

184
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,260
I can make up
another sign in a jiff.

185
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,220
Nope, I just wanna
get a good seat

186
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,500
for when they scatter
that sick bastard's molecules.

187
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,340
That's great.
That's the spirit, yeah.

188
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,540
Hey, Hel? You comin'?

189
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,020
No.

190
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,180
No, uh, in a weird way,

191
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,540
Creegan's been such
a big part of my life,

192
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,300
I don't think I could stand
to see him vaporized.

193
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,820
You two have fun.

194
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,180
Okay.
Okay.

195
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,460
Guards! You gotta stop him.

196
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,500
Creegan's gonna off himself!

197
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,100
What's going on
here?

198
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,540
Keep it down,
you losers.

199
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,340
Step away from
the force field.

200
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,060
I said, step back.

201
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,460
He's gonna do it, man.

202
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,580
Wow.

203
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,340
He's gonna kill himself.

204
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,620
That's the plan, baby.

205
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,660
Not on my watch.
Shut down the force field.

206
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,100
Fry, Creegan, fry.

207
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,220
Do it now!

208
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,780
Get up, Creegan.

209
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,460
I said, get up!

210
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,460
Yeah, mate!

211
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,460
Freeze, Creegan.

212
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,540
Sorry.

213
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,860
Nice, Creegan.

214
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,780
I think I pulled something.

215
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,500
The, uh, deactivator
is on his belt there

216
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,340
for my door.

217
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,420
Sure. Right, I'll stay here.

218
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,020
Creegan, Creegan...

219
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,060
Creegan, yeah!

220
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,260
Go, Creegan.

221
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,340
Shut up!

222
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,820
Hold your fire.

223
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,580
Get him! This way, come on!

224
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,780
I knew you
wouldn't leave me, buddy.

225
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,140
Come on, now. Do it.

226
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,980
Encrypted, encrypted,
encrypted.

227
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,500
Is there anything
in this blasted lab

228
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,660
that I can use?

229
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,900
Hel, is there a problem?

230
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,940
I don't know, Mauser.

231
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,820
I seem to be having trouble

232
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,660
with the command
override system.

233
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,100
Everything seems to be
functioning properly.

234
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,380
What systems were you
trying to override?

235
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,540
You'll do for starters.

236
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,140
Ooh.

237
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,780
Clemency for Creegan.

238
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,780
Okay, so he's evil, you know,
but he's still human.

239
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,700
Clemency for Creegan.

240
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,260
You can't demolecularize
your conscience.

241
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,100
Clemency for Creegan.

242
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,380
What is this? Texas?

243
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,860
Cleo, it's me, Hel.

244
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,860
Hmm?

245
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,580
You have to
listen to me.

246
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,780
Creegan pulled
some kind of switch

247
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,700
when I was in his cell.
He's me now.

248
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,340
I know it sounds crazy.

249
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,580
You have to help me
to get to Marla's chambers.

250
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,980
I have to convince her
to delay the execution.

251
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,260
Mmm.

252
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,820
Now, I'm going to
take my hand away.

253
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,860
Just take it easy.

254
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,580
Help!

255
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,140
It's Creegan. He's escaped.

256
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,820
Somebody just shoot him!

257
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,060
Creegan?

258
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,540
So much for not believing
in capital punishment.

259
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,140
Anybody-

260
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,020
Cleo, you have to help me.

261
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,540
Security breach.

262
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,820
Get away from me, you freak.

263
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,980
Security breach.

264
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,300
They're coming
for you, Creegan.

265
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,900
Lockdown sequence activated.

266
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,580
Don't call me Creegan.

267
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,020
Freeze, Creegan.

268
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,180
Hold it.

269
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,220
You've got
nowhere to run.

270
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,180
No.

271
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,260
Let Cleo go.

272
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,460
Sarge!

273
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,420
Sarge, listen to me.

274
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,220
Nothing you could say
interests me.

275
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,180
Sarge, do you have
a clear shot?

276
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,980
Cleo is not clear, Voice.

277
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,420
Sarge,
do what you have to do.

278
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,340
Sarge.

279
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,820
Let Cleo go,
or I will kill you.

280
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,140
Get them!

281
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,020
Cleo!

282
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,860
Damn it.

283
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,340
I believe there is
a piece of equipment

284
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,860
in this lab
to lead me to Voice.

285
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,220
That would be you, Mauser.

286
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,100
Where did we put that
Voice beacon of yours? Hmm?

287
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,620
Ah, yes,

288
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,580
behind your left ear.

289
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,660
Hel, are you in the lab?

290
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,860
Voice,
it's been a long time.

291
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,740
Hel, the lab sensors are offline
and I can't contact Mauser.

292
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,140
Technical glitch, Voice.

293
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,460
In fact, I'm performing
a diagnostic on him now.

294
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,220
I feared the worst.

295
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,420
Hel, Creegan has escaped
from his cell.

296
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,140
I won't make a very
good hostage you know.

297
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,500
We all have orders
to die rather than negotiate

298
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,020
with creeps like you.

299
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,740
Hel and Sarge won't hesitate
to sacrifice my life...

300
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,460
to take you down, mister.

301
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,060
Sarge hesitated back there.

302
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,260
I would have, too.

303
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,540
Cleo, what I told you before
was true.

304
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,980
You're Hel.

305
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,540
Yes.

306
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,940
Are you trying
to establish some kind

307
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,020
of insanity defense
or something?

308
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,540
Hel, Creegan's escaped.

309
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,180
He's taken Cleo hostage.

310
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,740
I heard.

311
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,900
We must recapture Creegan

312
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,860
before he does
any more damage.

313
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,780
Sarge, is everything
all right there?

314
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
I still can't
contact Mauser.

315
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,380
Hel, where's Mauser?

316
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,020
We were having some problems
with our lab systems.

317
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,140
So, uh,
Mauser's all over it.

318
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,420
Sarge, I registered
a massive power overload

319
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,980
in Mauser's systems
before I lost contact,

320
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,940
as if he'd been
badly damaged.

321
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,340
Voice is worried.

322
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,100
She got some weird
power readings off-

323
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,660
I told you, Mauser's fine.

324
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,700
Are you going to waste time
interrogating me

325
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,460
or are we going
to find Creegan?

326
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,060
I'm sorry, Sarge.

327
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,020
It's just that the thought
of what that fiend

328
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,700
might be doing to Cleopatra,
just drives me crazy.

329
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,940
Yeah. Me, too.

330
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,060
But, we still may be able to track
her down through her gauntlets.

331
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,540
If she's
still wearing them.

332
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,300
Get your hands
off of me.

333
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,580
Give me
those gauntlets.

334
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,700
I can prove to Sarge and Voice
that I'm the real Hel.

335
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,820
Hands off my gauntlets.

336
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,300
Damn it, Cleo, let go!

337
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,220
I win.

338
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,900
You just keep
your distance, freak,

339
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,540
or I'll zap that clown makeup
right off of your face.

340
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,740
Fine.

341
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,980
Fine, we'll just wait here.

342
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,700
Huh?

343
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,500
You know,
I bet Sarge and Voice

344
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,780
have already activated
that tracer in your gauntlet.

345
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,540
I just hope Sarge gets here
before Marla's guards do.

346
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,380
Why do you want
Sarge so bad, huh, Creegan?

347
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,660
I'm not Creegan.

348
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,340
Right.

349
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,420
I don't know what game
you're playing at

350
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,820
but I'm not
buying into it.

351
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,180
What are you doing?

352
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,140
I'm not letting you
lure my friends into a trap.

353
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,740
No, no!

354
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,740
You are so lucky
I'm not the real Creegan.

355
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,060
Got her. Cleo's in Shaft 87,
Level 209.

356
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,300
Wait a minute.

357
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,140
212, 216, 220.

358
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,140
She's not stopping.

359
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,140
You don't think
Creegan whacked her

360
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,740
and threw her
down the shaft, do you?

361
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,020
No, no,
I really don't think he did.

362
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,460
Our motion sensors
indicate activity this way.

363
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,900
Look alive.
Yes, sir.

364
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,260
I wish Sarge could
see how difficult

365
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,700
you're making things for me,
she'd be really impressed.

366
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,620
Creegan.

367
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,220
You're a great man.

368
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,340
Why don't I leave
you two alone? Ha, ha.

369
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,660
I want some distance between
myself and Marla's goons,

370
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,780
so if you don't mind.

371
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,020
No problem, boss man.
We'll hide you.

372
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,020
I think it would be better
if we, uh, split up.

373
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,740
Remember the old hidey-hole
from the Tunnel Gang days?

374
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Sure.

375
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,900
It's still there.

376
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,380
Marla will never find us.
Come on.

377
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,260
Bring your friend.

378
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,140
Creegan.

379
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,700
All right. Let's go.

380
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,500
Sarge, Marla's people
have recaptured 11 prisoners.

381
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,540
Let me guess, none of them
are Creegan or Cleo?

382
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,780
I'm afraid not.

383
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,740
Still no sign.

384
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,860
Run the surveillance hologram
of the escape again.

385
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,580
I knew Creegan was
obsessed with you, Hel,

386
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,540
but now he's trying
to copy your moves.

387
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,660
He is not flexible.

388
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,180
He's got no ass.

389
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,700
Jump forward.

390
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,180
Freeze it.

391
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,740
See somethin'?

392
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,500
Are your
gauntlets charged?

393
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,460
Always.

394
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,940
Follow me.

395
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,500
It's just Tox.

396
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,900
Hey, Creegan.

397
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,420
Oh! There's a new smell.

398
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,900
You should feel
right at home.

399
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,380
This is a great day!

400
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,100
Marla and her kind have tried

401
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,860
to impose their law
on the underground, on us!

402
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,700
Who does
she think she is?

403
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,900
Yeah!

404
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,180
We make our own
laws down here.

405
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,340
Yeah.

406
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,620
We answer to ourselves!

407
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,900
Yeah!

408
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,260
And to Creegan!

409
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,580
Yeah, Creegan.

410
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,900
Nice going.

411
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,380
You tell them, Creegan.

412
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,100
You're the man.

413
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,340
Thanks.

414
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,540
Yeah, thanks a lot, um,

415
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,780
well, it's so nice to see
some old-old familiar faces,

416
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,260
uh, once again.

417
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,620
Drek,

418
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,140
Scuzz.

419
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,180
I didn't think I'd ever be
this close to any of you,

420
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,740
uh, ever, and I mean that.

421
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,660
I really appreciate you
inviting me down here

422
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,580
to this wonderful hideout.

423
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,620
So, thanks.

424
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,140
So what are you all
staring at,

425
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,100
you bunch of
brain-dead shaft oozes?

426
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,220
I just escaped
from Marla's cell!

427
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,060
Let's do some crimes!

428
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,100
Yeah, whoo.

430
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,860
Good to see you again,
Creegan.

431
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,300
Yeah, welcome back.

432
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,100
Leaving so soon?

433
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,300
I was just going
to the powder room.

434
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,020
Grabbing a hostage
was a smart move, Creegan,

435
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,140
Yeah.

436
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,500
but we're in the clear now
and she's just a liability.

437
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,220
I want some of that.

438
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,300
Back off, Tox.

439
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
I grabbed this one.
She belongs to me.

440
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,860
Sorry, Creegan.

441
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,140
You're right.

442
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,540
You kill her.

443
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,340
Kill her.

444
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,660
Come on.

445
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,700
Well, go on then.

446
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,500
Kill her.

447
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,980
Kill her.

448
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,180
Are you
giving me orders?

449
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,540
No.

450
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,180
You listen to me,
you pus-ridden,

451
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,540
crusty-faced, sewer leech,

452
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,300
I make the rules.

453
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,220
Next time you tell me
what to do,

454
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,060
I'll be wearing
your skin as a suit.

455
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,460
You got that?

456
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,740
Oh.

457
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,620
This little cupcake
is mine.

458
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,780
Oh, I'll kill her
in my own good time.

459
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,340
In the meantime,
we're going to have some fun.

460
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,220
Yeah.

461
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,140
I'd rather you just kill me.

462
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,140
Creegan.

463
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,900
Go, Creegan!

464
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,140
You're the man.

465
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,140
Whatever you're going to do,
just get it over with.

466
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,260
But no kissing.

467
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,180
Don't worry, Cleo.
You're not my type.

468
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,740
What?

469
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,820
I told you, I'm not...
Ah, forget it.

470
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,660
Let's get out of here.

471
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,900
Sarge.

472
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,340
Why can't you just
die with dignity?

473
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,660
Hel! No!

474
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,020
We let the law
deal with him.

475
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,940
Of course.

476
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,900
Sarge! Hel isn't Hel!

477
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,300
Watch her-

478
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,460
Come on, scumbag.

479
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,500
Let's go.

480
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,500
You don't have
to watch this, Hel.

481
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,340
Creegan is the most fiendishly
brilliant mind alive.

482
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,260
I won't rest until I can
see him dead with my own eyes.

483
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,940
That's far enough.

484
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,500
Just look at him.

485
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,900
Sarge,
something's hinky here.

486
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,700
Yeah, you don't like
executions, I get it.

487
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,100
No, Hel's been acting weird

488
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,060
ever since she went
into Creegan's cell.

489
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,900
Defending him.
Talking up his genius.

490
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,140
She just called him
"fiendishly brilliant. "

491
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,780
What, did she buy a word-of-the-day
calendar or something?

492
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,460
What, Hel uses a few big words
and all of a sudden she's-

493
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,660
What about at the bar?

494
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,980
She forgets that you have
the Voice in your head

495
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,180
instead of hers?

496
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,060
And why is she being all
formal, calling you "Cleopatra,"

497
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,580
when Creegan just
called you "Cleo"?

498
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,420
Yeah,
you see what I'm sayin'?

499
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,860
Just remember what I said.

500
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,300
If you're going to do this,

501
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,180
make sure you
got the right guy.

502
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,660
Final words, Creegan?

503
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,540
"Spend some time
in slave chains,

504
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,900
see the world
through new eyes. "

505
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,180
What?

506
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,700
That's what you told me
when I saved you

507
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,860
from the slavers
that double-crossed you.

508
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,300
You said there was more
to life down here

509
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,660
than squeezing
profits from misery.

510
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,780
What kind
of a trick is this?

511
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,420
I- I don't think
it's a trick.

512
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,860
Cleopatra, that's enough.

513
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,380
Creegan has been found guilty.

514
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,700
Carry out his sentence.

515
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,780
Yeah! Do it, now!

516
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,580
I think we need
to reopen this case.

517
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,620
I order you to be silent.

518
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,620
Sarge! Trust your instincts.

519
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,780
Does that sound
like the Hel you know?

520
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,380
He told me to keep my eye
on you, Hel, and I have.

521
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,500
Quite frankly, I don't think
you've been yourself today.

522
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,940
This is absurd.
Carry out his execution! Now!

523
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,220
Yeah.
That's enough!

524
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,340
What?

525
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,540
By my authority as magistrate,
I order a 24-hour stay.

526
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,980
Return the prisoner
to his chambers.

527
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,220
Kill the clown.

528
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,620
No!

529
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,740
Demolecularization initiated.

530
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,980
Evacuate chambers immediately.

531
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,260
No!

532
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,660
Hel!

533
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,260
In the end, I'm glad
it turned out this way.

534
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,460
I much prefer
a firing squad

535
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,100
to that humane contraption
they had you in.

536
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,660
Cleo, get back!

537
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,740
It's no use, Sarge.

538
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,820
The escape countermeasures
have been activated.

539
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,380
Then override them!

540
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,980
Do it!

541
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,020
Hel!

542
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,460
Hel, can you hear me?

543
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,540
Hel, talk to us!

544
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,060
It's not workin'!

545
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,620
Come on!

546
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,220
Nice moves, Helen.

547
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,540
You work that body in ways
I never thought I could.

548
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,460
Must be the female touch.

549
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,380
Maybe,
I still know my weaknesses

550
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,540
which are now your weaknesses.

551
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,820
It's over,
Creegan, they know.

552
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,780
Knowledge isn't everything.

553
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,780
Got it. Let's go.

554
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,660
Don't move.

555
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,620
No, no, hey, get Creegan!
Creegan!

556
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,580
Oh, I mean, Hel,
or whoever that was.

557
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,500
Uh.

558
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,820
Hel?

559
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,380
Yeah, it's me.

560
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,020
How did he do it?

561
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,460
Creegan smuggled this
into his cell

562
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,860
inside a hollow tooth.

563
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,900
Pretty ingenious.

564
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,340
Hel, you were trying
to tell me, and...

565
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,500
I'm sorry I was so slow
on the uptake.

566
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,980
Forget it.

567
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,740
I wouldn't believe anything that
came out of his mouth, either.

568
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,500
So this little doohickey
can change you back?

569
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,860
I hope so.

570
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,900
I really don't want to spend
every day looking at that face.

571
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,580
Hey, It's no picnic being
on this side, either.

572
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,660
I'm sure it's not.

573
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,740
Don't worry.
We'll bring Creegan in.

574
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,980
Hey, just tell your men
to go easy

575
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,260
with those
shock batons, huh?

576
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,180
They really sting.

577
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,980
Come on, let's move.

578
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,660
Sarge?

579
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,700
Yeah, Voice.

580
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,340
Sarge,
I still haven't been able

581
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,420
to establish communication
with Mauser.

582
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,900
And someone has
just re-encrypted

583
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,700
the lab's defensive system.

584
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,980
He's in the lab.

585
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,860
Okay, Sarge, you go right.

586
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,660
Cleo, stay low, go left.

587
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,460
Remember,
that's my body in there,

588
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,100
so low-power weapons only.

589
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,660
Once you pin him down,
I'll move in

590
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,060
and make the swap.

591
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,820
Let's go, team.

592
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,180
What?

593
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,380
Nothing.

594
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,300
Hel!

595
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,380
I wanted to keep this party
a little more intimate.

596
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,420
So I reprogrammed the door
to only admit you.

597
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,260
You're just
dragging this out, Creegan.

598
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,980
Marla and her men
will be here any minute.

599
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,540
If I were you,
I'd do everything in my power

600
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,140
to keep that from happening.

601
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,260
Anyone else comes
dragging through that door,

602
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,100
and I trigger the lab
self-destruct systems.

603
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,140
The blast would surely kill

604
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,180
all your little friends
outside that door

605
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,780
and there will be plenty left
for Marla and her boys.

606
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,060
But the most
delicious death of all

607
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,740
will be yours, Helen.

608
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,060
The last thing you'll see
is your body

609
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,860
being blown into
a million pieces.

610
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,500
Voice, can you
override lab door security?

611
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,860
I'm trying every
access code, Sarge.

612
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,660
But it'll take some time.

613
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,380
Sarge, do you read me?

614
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,740
Creegan, I mean, Hel.

615
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,700
What's going on in there?

616
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,940
Creegan's armed
the lab auto-destruct.

617
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,340
Tell Marla and her men
to keep some distance.

618
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,060
You'd better back off, too.

619
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,780
I'm not going
to abandon you, Hel.

620
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,940
Just do it, Sarge!

621
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,980
What's this gonna
get you, huh?

622
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,860
You blow up the lab
and you'll die, too.

623
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,700
What have I got to lose?
Hmm?

624
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,700
You and Marla
were only too happy

625
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,860
to make my death
a public spectacle.

626
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,300
No regret, no remorse.

627
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,380
Is that justice, Helen?

628
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,180
Or your own lust
for vengeance?

629
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,020
You were going
to do the same to me.

630
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,380
My point exactly.

631
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,820
You've crossed the line.

632
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,900
We're just the same now,

633
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,420
you and I.

634
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,900
That's right, Marla.

635
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,980
I want you and your men
at least 20 levels back

636
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,460
till you hear from me.

637
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,340
Or until you hear
a really loud noise.

638
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,180
We're not leaving?

639
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,820
What do you think?

640
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,020
Voice,
any luck with that door?

641
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,540
Only 300 quadrillion possible
key combinations to go.

642
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,940
Great.

643
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,500
Cleo, stay here.

644
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,340
Where are you going?

645
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,060
A shielded access vent
runs into the lab

646
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,300
from the next level up.

647
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,180
There's an auxiliary
control station inside.

648
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,300
And if I get to it

649
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,700
I should be able to shut down
the auto-destruct.

650
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,940
Sarge, you know

651
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,140
that vent is protected
by a security force field.

652
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,540
I know about
the security, Voice.

653
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,060
So I'm gonna need you
to help me get through it.

654
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,300
Sarge, be careful.

655
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,580
We could make a deal.

656
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,220
You want your body back.
I want mine.

657
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,020
You make the switch and I'll
tell Marla that you cooperated

658
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,700
and I'll personally see to it,

659
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,620
that you have your
death sentence commuted.

660
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,380
I thought you wanted
to see me fry, Helen?

661
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,900
Come on, now.
Don't wimp out on me.

662
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,500
Stick to your convictions!

663
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,980
Whatever happens, you're not
walking out of here.

664
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,580
Maybe not,
but in the meantime,

665
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,020
Mr. Mauser and I
have some unfinished business.

666
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,380
Oh, I hope I don't make
a mess out of his brain

667
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,380
looking for this Voice beacon.

668
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,460
Oh, well.

669
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,620
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

670
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,460
One more step
and we go out together.

671
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,340
Oh.

672
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,940
What happened
to the good old days

673
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,900
when we could just leave
a key under the mat?

674
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,580
I can see the force field,
Voice.

675
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,740
Can you shut it down?

676
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,820
Yes, but I can only leave
the field down

677
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,940
for a few seconds

678
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,620
without setting off
the lab alarms.

679
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,020
Is that enough time?

680
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,340
It'll have to be.

681
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,060
Force field deactivation
in three, two, one.

682
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,300
There's that Voice beacon.

683
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,140
Sarge, take the next right
to the control panel.

684
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,540
Come to Daddy.

685
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,460
Laboratory
auto-destruct activated.

686
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,260
Now you've done it.

687
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,020
Detonation in one minute,
25 seconds.

688
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,540
1:25, 1:24.

689
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,540
Damn it!

690
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,940
1:13, 1:12, 1:11, 1:10

691
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,220
1:09.

692
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,300
Cleo, get out of there.
I'm not gonna make it!

693
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,300
I'm not leaving you guys.

694
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,860
31, 30, 29

695
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,980
25, 24

696
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,500
21, 20.

697
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,860
Cleo, get out of there,
the lab's going to blow!

698
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,140
19, 18.

699
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,340
Not exactly the execution
you had in mind, huh, Helen?

700
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,700
13, 12, 11, 10

701
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,980
9, 8, 7...

702
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,620
Goodbye, Helen.

703
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,340
6, 5, 4

704
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,220
3, 2, 1.

705
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,300
No.

706
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,940
Auto-destruct
sequence aborted.

707
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,740
Goodbye.

708
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,060
Creegan.

709
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,220
No.

710
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,420
Command:
override lab security door.

711
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,020
Don't move, Creegan,
or I'll zap you.

712
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,580
Cleo, I'm Hel!

713
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,580
I'm not falling
for your mind games again.

714
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,380
Cleo, no!

715
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,780
You, okay?

716
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,540
Thanks, Cleopatra.

717
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,060
Don't worry, I got him.

718
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,260
You are still Creegan, right?

719
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,220
All systems check out.

720
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,780
Thank you, Hel.

721
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,340
It feels good
to be back on-line.

722
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,820
Oh, me, too.

723
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,220
Although,
I do have to say

724
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,340
that I'm a little
disappointed in you guys.

725
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,780
Excuse me?

726
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,780
Mmm-hmm.

727
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,260
We just saved you
from being fried.

728
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,220
Well, yes, eventually.

729
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,980
But I can't believe you
couldn't tell the difference

730
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,540
between myself
and a megalomaniacal killer.

731
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,780
Now that hurt.

732
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,380
Well, Creegan put on
a pretty good show.

733
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,100
And you have to admit,

734
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,020
there is a bit of a tyrant
in both of you.

735
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,260
Well, don't get me wrong,
I love that about you.

736
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,300
Cleo, how are you doing?

737
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,580
Feeling any better?

738
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,340
No.

739
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,020
Oh, come on, Cleo.

740
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,780
At least you stayed true
to your beliefs.

741
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,420
No one got executed.

742
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,780
Yeah, but I don't back
the catch-and-release program.

743
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,900
I just let the baddest guy
down here walk.

744
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,460
See you. Bye-bye.

745
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,620
Be good now, okay?

746
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,020
Cleo, your gut feeling
saved Hel's life.

747
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,380
Yes, and it's true

748
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,100
you did manage
to let Creegan

749
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,780
slip through
your fingers today.

750
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,300
But, thanks to you,
I get to see tomorrow.

751
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,780
Yeah.

752
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,620
Yeah.

753
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,300
Yeah.

754
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,740
Yeah.

755
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,180
Okay.
