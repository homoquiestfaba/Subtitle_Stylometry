1
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:19,446
<i>In October of 1979,</i>

2
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,182
<i>a death row inmate</i>
<i>named Jack Harding</i>

3
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,751
<i>escaped police custody</i>

4
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:26,320
<i>and proceeded to go</i>
<i>on a killing spree</i>

5
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:30,123
<i>in the sleepy farming community</i>
<i>of Hackleburg, Alabama.</i>

6
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,603
You're saying that you think
he's still alive, don't you?

7
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:43,303
I know he is.

8
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:46,106
<i>He would seemingly appear</i>
<i>from thin air,</i>

9
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:50,444
<i>a force of nature empowered</i>
<i>by the onset of autumn.</i>

10
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,849
You and this town is linin' up

11
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:57,885
for a third Saturday in October
slaughterhouse!

12
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,320
Stop, please! Stop!

13
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:04,659
Stop! Stop!

14
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,563
<i>He would return</i>
<i>to haunt Hackleburg</i>

15
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,532
<i>three more times</i>
<i>throughout the 1980s,</i>

16
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:15,536
<i>continuously defying death</i>
<i>as he left a trail of carnage</i>

17
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,771
<i>in his wake.</i>

18
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,506
Are you even in there?

19
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,545
<i>His victims</i>
<i>would be young and old</i>

20
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,515
<i>with no regard for the</i>
<i>innocence of human life.</i>

21
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,552
This game
is fucking impossible.

22
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:32,553
Baby.

23
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,456
Is this really what you
wanna be doing right now?

24
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,458
Stop,
you're gonna get me killed.

25
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,927
You don't wanna see my tits?

26
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:41,495
Not right now.

27
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,330
Baby, come on.

28
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,833
He's usually
all over the place.

29
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:48,636
More like all over me.

30
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,246
<i>After an attack in 1987,</i>

31
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,448
<i>Harding vanished</i>
<i>without a trace.</i>

32
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,250
<i>And for the past six years,</i>

33
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,586
<i>the residents of Hackleburg</i>
<i>have made it through</i>

34
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,856
<i>the third Saturday in October</i>
<i>without incident.</i>

35
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,559
<i>This year however,</i>
<i>they are about to see</i>

36
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,895
<i>some real crazy shit.</i>

37
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,312
<i>...107.7</i>

38
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,716
<i>Alabama sports radio...</i>

39
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:36,383
<i>Reports out of Mobile tell us</i>

40
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,687
<i>that receivers and backup</i>
<i>quarterback Tex Coorley</i>

41
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:41,756
<i>were out on the practice</i>
<i>field this evenin'.</i>

42
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:45,392
<i>Now, all I can make of this is</i>
<i>that Coach Redd just found out</i>

43
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,028
<i>Nate Barker</i>
<i>can't play tomorrow.</i>

44
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,129
<i>Oh, that's ridiculous.</i>

45
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,330
<i>Coach Redd wouldn't</i>
<i>advertise it to the world</i>

46
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,432
<i>if his starting quarterback</i>
<i>couldn't play.</i>

47
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,636
<i>This is the old ball coach</i>
<i>tryin' to mess with A&M</i>

48
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,437
<i>and head coach Manny Parish.</i>

49
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,873
<i>Nothin' more, nothin' less.</i>

50
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,360
<i>You disrespected me!</i>
<i>That was inappropriate dancin'!</i>

51
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,427
<i>There ain't no ifs,</i>
<i>ands or buts about it.</i>

52
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,363
<i>Ugh, I swear, Ronnie,</i>
<i>if you don't shut up,</i>

53
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,765
<i>I'm gonna stay</i>
<i>at my mama's house tonight.</i>

54
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,499
I know where
you wanna sleep tonight

55
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:00,635
<i>and it sure as hell</i>
<i>ain't your mama's house.</i>

56
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,670
<i>Listen to yourself.</i>
<i>You're drunk, drunk, drunk!</i>

57
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,404
Hold on now,
I ain't done talkin' to you.

58
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,642
Oh! Ugh, how dare you?

59
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,377
Why'd you hit me
with that damn door?

60
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,479
Oh, I wish you walked
square into that sucker.

61
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,115
I wish it knocked you clean out!

62
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,817
Oh, I bet.

63
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,485
That way you'd have
all the free time in the world

64
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,353
to run around
with old Johnny Stevens.

65
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,491
You know what?

66
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,694
I don't have to
listen to you anymore.

67
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,030
- I swear I've had it.
- Oh, yeah?

68
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,732
Well, we know
who you do listen to, don't we?

69
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:34,001
Old Johnny Stevens.

70
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:35,903
I saw y'all a dancin'.

71
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:38,005
His hands all over my woman.

72
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,109
A married woman dancin'
with a school vice principal.

73
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:43,878
- That's ridiculous!
- Shut up, Ronnie!

74
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:53,120
I bet Johnny Stevens
don't cut his own damn firewood,

75
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:54,689
I tell you that.

76
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,760
Son of a bitch
tryin' to dance with my woman.

77
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,997
I should've clocked his ass
across the dance floor.

78
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,604
Bum-ass can't keep
a job no way.

79
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,404
Ain't fit for nothing.

80
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,613
<i>Look-it, baby,</i>
<i>I'm sorry about earlier.</i>

81
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,548
I know I got you all riled up.

82
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,051
I just saw Johnny Stevens
and you dancin' like that,

83
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:27,788
and well,
considering I'd been drinkin',

84
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:30,958
and you know how I get when I
get the hard stuff in me, honey.

85
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:33,594
Well, you know better
than to drink it.

86
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,930
Oh, I begged you
not to get like this tonight,

87
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,633
- and look what happened.
- I know, I know.

88
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,702
Thing about it is, baby...

89
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,005
I can't help it.

90
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,974
When I got a woman
as beautiful as you,

91
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:48,142
I see Johnny Stevens

92
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,878
with his meat hooks
all over you,

93
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:53,648
well, it's just
natural response for me

94
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,683
to get a little bit teed off.

95
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:59,186
You know I'm sorry. I really am.

96
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:01,923
Aw, hon.

97
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,559
That still ain't no excuse
for yellin' at me like you did.

98
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:08,461
I know it, I know it.
And I tell you what?

99
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:11,565
When we go to church on Sunday,
that's the first thing

100
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,100
I'mma pray about.

101
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,603
You'll go to church with me?

102
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,705
Well, of course,
it's been too long.

103
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,540
I owe Jesus a visit.

104
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,181
- I love you, Ronnie.
- Oh, I love you too, baby.

105
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,985
Good Lord.

106
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,854
Phew!
These must be new, huh?

107
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,157
Yeah, K-Mart special.

108
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:39,527
So, you tellin' me
I got K-Mart to blame

109
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,596

bouncin' around in my head?

I tell you what? Let's do--

191

00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,916
Well...

340
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:52,352
you got some big balls on you.

341
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:57,290
Well, I got some big uns, too,

342
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:01,662
and that's why they call me
Big Willie Nathan.

343
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,266
Now, I'm goin' up here
to do my chore.

344
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:10,671
Little kitty cats
ain't gonna feed their selves.

345
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,378
Now, when I turn back around,

346
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,048
I best see your ass
headin' down that road.

347
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,519
You and the hearse
you rode in on.

348
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:42,670
If you're lookin' to get
your brain scrambled here today,

349
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,539
boy, you are in luck.

350
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:48,543
Cause the skillet's on the stove
and the grease is already hot.

351
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:50,945
Okay, buddy boy,

352
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:54,048
you about to go
from the fryin' pan to the fire.

353
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,823
What in tarnation?

354
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,826
Look here, son,
I tried to warn you.

355
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:05,860
Now, what you should have done

356
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:08,029
was acted like a gravy train
on biscuit wheels

357
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:09,931
and rolled your ass
on out of here!

358
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:28,616
Oh. Whoa, whoa, look.

359
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:29,750
Whoa, now! Whoa!

360
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,717
Alright, PJ,
let's go to the video store.

361
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,851
Get it!

362
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,621

Yeah, yeah, dude,

00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,132
I can fuckin' hear you.
You're bein' loud enough.

399
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,001
George, I can do this.

400
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:10,004
- Ow!
- Oh, what?

401
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:11,772

00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:16,177
- George, just--
- Fuckin' serious?

403
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,912
Damn, you fucking crippled?

404
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:21,649
Watch the door!

405
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:23,184
Man, what gives, you fuckwads?

406
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:25,719
The game doesn't start
for like 30 minutes.

407
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:26,720
Now, Peter,

408
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:29,090
is that any way
to talk to your friends?

409
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,792
Cussin' us out
for bein' 30 minutes early?

410
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:33,694
Fuck you, retard!

411
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:34,662
Why don't you
get up out of that chair

412
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:36,330
and fight me
if you don't fuckin' like it?

413
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:38,866
Jesus Christ, P-- Peter.

414
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:42,770
I just thought we'd d--
drop in a little early is all.

415
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:44,105
Calm down.

416
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:46,841
O-- okay. I'm-- I'm calm.

417
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:48,342
I'm calm.

418
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:50,311
Hey, man, you know I was
just messin' with you, right?

419
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,246
Come on, now. Huh? Come on.

420
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,348
Yeah, we're cool.

421
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:55,983
C'mon man, let's go get high.

422
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:57,318
Yeah, alright.

423
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:03,991
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
What about me?

424
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:08,095
Lester, what about you, huh?

425
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:10,197
What, you expect us
to carry your fat ass

426
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:12,833
up and down these steps
all goddamn day and night?

427
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:15,870
Think I'm gonna pull
a hernia over you, little guy?

428
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,404
Would you lighten up on him?

429
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:19,273
Dude, I'm--
I'm tryin' to toughen him up.

430
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:20,374
He's a little bitch.

431
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:24,044
Say, Peter,
why you got a hearse out

432
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:25,813
at the end of your driveway?

433
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,783
<i>Say, Lester,</i>
<i>there's not a fuckin' hearse</i>

434
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:31,719
at the end of the driveway.

435
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,420
Peter, I know
what a hearse looks like.

436
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:34,855
It's as plain as day,

437
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:37,158
out there
at the end of your driveway!

438
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:39,260
<i>Yeah, well, I know</i>
<i>what a jackass looks like.</i>

439
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:41,862
<i>Sittin' in a wheelchair,</i>
<i>yellin' at me from downstairs.</i>

440
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:43,197

00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:11,125
- Hey, Holcomb.
- Hi, PJ.

449
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:13,060
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

450
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:16,130
You guys, um,
havin' a big movie marathon?

451
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,499
Yes, and PJ gets to rent
whatever she wants.

452
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:19,833
Really?

453
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,735
Yes, as long as
when you're watchin' it,

454
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,871
I can go next door
and watch the game.

455
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:25,372
Whatever.

456
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:28,409
Okay, but are you sure
you wanna do that?

457
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,111
I mean George
and Sharon are back together.

458
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:33,147
Don't you wanna avoid
that love triangle drama?

459
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,415
They're not
getting back together.

460
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:36,050
If you say so.

461
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,219
Just don't be surprised
if Sharon tries to punch you out

462
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:39,853
the next time she sees you.

463
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,789
What? So, my friends
are having a party next door

464
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:44,391
and I can't go just cause
George has a crush on me?

465
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,260
You like him, too.

466
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:49,029
No, I don't. George, really?

467
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:50,798
<i>Yeah, George really.</i>

468
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,334
<i>Those eyebrows?</i> [chuckling]

469
00:28:53,434 --> 00:28:55,803
- <i>Are you kidding me?</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

470
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:57,606
I just don't wanna see you

471
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:00,107
in another
messed up relationship.

472
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,309
I appreciate you're tryin'
to look out for me right now,

473
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:04,345
but this is different.

474
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,347
George is different.

475
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:09,350
- Are these okay?
- Mm-hm.

476
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:13,787
Hoosiers? Really?

477
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:16,156
I like basketball.

478
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,057
So when are you clockin' out?

479
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:19,093
As soon as Cody's
slow ass gets here.

480
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:20,394
He's already 15 minutes late.

481
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:21,795
Okay, we'll be outside.

482
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:29,470
Can we please go
to Catfish Cabin?

483
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:31,438
No, they're only open
for dinner.

484
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:39,380
Why do I get the feeling
you're lying to me?

485
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:43,784
PJ, I would never lie to you.

486
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,919
I'm the one person in your life
that you could always count on

487
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,955
to be real with you,
no matter what.

488
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:48,856
Okay?

489
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:52,893
Whoo...

490
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:01,135
<i>Man, I'm gonna</i>
<i>bag Holcomb tonight.</i>

491
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:04,204
I thought you
were all over Angela.

492
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:06,040
Well, I'mma bag her, too!

493
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:08,108
See, Holcomb's
spendin' the night with Maggie,

494
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:10,311
so I'mma have to
get that in before halftime.

495
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:11,879
Then I'll have
the rest of the night

496
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:12,747
with Angela.

497
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:14,448
Man, I get playin'
the field and all,

498
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,985
but that's some really
questionable decision-making.

499
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,588
What?
Are you fucking kidding me?

500
00:30:20,622 --> 00:30:23,157
I'm being judged by the guy
who's tryin' to bag Maggie

501
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,359
and Sharon at the same time.

502
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:28,962
That is highly inaccurate,
my f-- friend.

503
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,598
I am a single man.

504
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:34,335
Yeah. Yeah, you're s--single,

505
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:36,270
cause your dick
is ready to wander.

506
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:38,640
Man, if Maggie wasn't

- Uh, no, get away!

673
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:00,848
Where's your
fuckin' knife now.

674
00:38:00,882 --> 00:38:01,949
Peter, you asshole.

675
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:04,986
Get off me. Oh!

676
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:07,555
What? He tried to pull
a fuckin' knife on me.

677
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:10,457
He's lucky
I didn't mess him up royally.

678
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:11,959
You know what?

679
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:14,929
You'll get this back
with good behavior, you asshat.

680
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,631
You guys, dammit.

681
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:21,068
Why can't you-- j-- just--
just try and have a good time?

682
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:22,703
We are havin' a good time.

683
00:38:26,774 --> 00:38:29,777
That's right.
You can walk on clouds.

684
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:32,412
- Yeah.
- Nice, soft, fluffy clouds.

685
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:33,313
Okay.

686
00:38:34,682 --> 00:38:39,452
Yeah. Alright.
You're alright. Good.

687
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:48,796
Hey.

688
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:50,463
Yeah.

689
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:55,937
Peter thinks he can get you
and Holcomb tonight.

690
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,506
The b-- both of y'all.

691
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:00,875
What the fuck?

692
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,611
Who does he think we are?

693
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:09,382
Hey there, little lady.
Where'd you come from?

694
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,752
Well,
sometimes I'm over there,

695
00:39:11,786 --> 00:39:13,754
sometimes I'm over here,

696
00:39:13,788 --> 00:39:16,023
and sometimes I'm up there.

697
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,993
Alright, then,
usually I'm just right here

698
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,127
in this here chair.

699
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:21,295
Well, you look lonely.

700
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:24,464
I can teach you how to dance
and you can dance with me.

701
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:27,034
Yeah, okay.

702
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:56,864
Hey.

703
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:59,033
- You got room for one more?
- Sure do.

704
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:03,604
Hey, what's the ETA
on that pizza?

705
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:04,572
Hey, Sharon,
here's a radical thought.

706
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:06,473
If you want a pizza,
just order it yourself.

707
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,227
<i>Village Pizza.</i>
<i>How can I help you?</i>

708
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,596
Hi, I'd like to place
an order for delivery.

709
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,765
<i>Can you tell me the address?</i>

710
00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:33,134
Um, yeah, hold on.

711
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:41,943
450, Red Bank Road.

712
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:43,945
<i>We don't deliver</i>
<i>outside the city limits.</i>

713
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:46,714
Oh, I understand.
I can come pick it up.

714
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:48,783
<i>Okay. What do you want?</i>

715
00:40:48,816 --> 00:40:50,518
Um, I would just like
a pepperoni pizza

716
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:51,719
and some bread sticks.

717
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,087
<i>Uh, we're out of pepperoni</i>

718
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,589
<i>due to the statewide</i>
<i>pepperoni shortage.</i>

719
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,626
Um, cheese is fine.

720
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:01,696
<i>Name for the order?</i>

721
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:03,164
Sharon.

722
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:05,498
<i>Can you spell it?</i>

723
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:08,035
S-H-A-R-O-N.

724
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:10,938
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>give us 10 to 45 minutes.</i>

725
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,506
Okay, great, thanks.

726
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:15,042
For nothing.

727
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:23,017
No.

728
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:25,619
Okay, so check this out.

729
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,922
- You are not
gonna believe this.
- What?

730
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:31,792
George told me that Peter
is gonna try to hook up

731
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:33,728
with both of us tonight.

732
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:36,496
Are you kidding me? Ugh!

733
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:37,932
Uh, I literally
made out with him.

734
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:39,967
- No.
- Whatever.

735
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,770
I've got a plan.

736
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:45,740
Well, in that case,

Uh, we were actually
hoping that you should

746
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:16,237
show us
some dance moves... upstairs.

747
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:19,607
Yes, absolutely. Let's go.

748
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:25,780
Meow.

749
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:28,182
Meow.

750
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:30,017
Hey, Maggie?

751
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:34,688
Hey, kiddo.
Grown-up party got too boring?

752
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:37,792
Actually,
I'm looking for Glamourpuss.

753
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:39,160
Right, I'm sure. Okay.

754
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:41,796
Well, uh, be safe
and uh, be clean.

755
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:45,966
- Bye, Maggie.
- Okay, have fun with the dust.

756
00:42:48,302 --> 00:42:49,737
What is she doing back there?

757
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,939
Well, just playin' in dirt.
I don't know.

758
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:53,007
Kids.

759
00:42:55,743 --> 00:42:57,211
We're so glad
you're into this, Peter.

760
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,379
Oh, yes.

761
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,247
Yeah, we're so lucky.

762
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:01,782
Yeah, you really are.

763
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,752
I mean we've been
thinking about it forever.

764
00:43:04,785 --> 00:43:06,053
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

765
00:43:06,087 --> 00:43:09,223
About... each other...

766
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:11,792
and you.

767
00:43:11,826 --> 00:43:13,094
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

768
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:19,366
But you have to let us
have our way with you.

769
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,769
Oh, that's not a problem.
Go for it, okay.

770
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:26,874
What are y'all doing?

771
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:32,046
Um...

772
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:42,423
Okay. Um...

773
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:45,326
Uh-- uh, yeah,
alright, just put--

774
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,727
Put that right up there.

775
00:43:48,229 --> 00:43:50,064
God, you are like makin'
all of my fantasies

776
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:51,832
come true right now.

777
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:53,067
And you have no idea.

778
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,171
Shouldn't I be tyin' y'all up,
instead of you tyin' me up,

779
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:58,706
cause, I just-- Oh.

780
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:00,274
No, we wanna do it this way.

781
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:02,076
Oh, okay.

782
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:04,245
We wanna show you our titties.

783
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:06,313
- Alright, well...
- Hmm.

784
00:44:06,347 --> 00:44:08,382
Whose do you wanna see first?

785
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:10,918
Um, doesn't
really matter to me.

786
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:12,820
How about both
at the same time?

787
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,355
Hmm.

788
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:18,959
What if we get
someone else to join in?

789
00:44:18,993 --> 00:44:21,729
Would you want Maggie
or Sharon?

790
00:44:21,762 --> 00:44:22,763
If you asked me 10 times,

791
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:24,431
I would say Maggie's name
every fuckin' time.

792
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:25,933
Like do you really think
I wanna see Sharon's titties?

793
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:27,468
Come on. Maggie.

794
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:30,371
- We'll be right back.
- Okay. Um...

795
00:44:36,043 --> 00:44:37,745
Alright, I'll just wait here.

796
00:44:41,882 --> 00:44:44,451
Yes.

797
00:44:46,187 --> 00:44:48,789
Oh, my God, I'm about to
fuck three of the most

798
00:44:48,822 --> 00:44:51,892
bodacious bitches
in Hackleburg history.

799
00:44:54,328 --> 00:44:55,863
I deserve this.

800
00:44:57,831 --> 00:45:00,801
And you certainly deserve this.
Yeah.

801
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:08,943
Oh, welcome back.

802
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:10,945
- They're on their way.
- Okay.

803
00:45:11,646 --> 00:45:13,881
Holcomb's trying
to talk Maggie into it.

804
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:14,815
Okay.

805
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,884
Until then...

806
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:22,389
Ooh, we should take it all off.

807
00:45:22,557 --> 00:45:24,225
I like the sound of that.
That's fine with me.

808
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:27,027
Mm-hm.

809
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:29,997
It'll be better
if nobody can hear you scream.

810
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:36,170
Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater.

811
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:40,040
A little birdie told me
you wanted to see some titties.

812
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:42,843
We brought you
the biggest ones in Alabama.

813
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,448
Take it in. Take it in.

814
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:50,184
Isn't this what you wanted, huh?

815
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:53,087
Isn't this what you wanted?

816
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,189
- Oh, look at that.
- Fuck you, man!

817
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:56,090
One of these days,

818
00:45:56,123 --> 00:45:58,025
whenever I get up
out of this chair,

819
00:45:58,058 --> 00:46:00,995
I'mma plop 'em right on top
of that red head of yours.

820
00:46:01,028 --> 00:46:02,830
What?
They're bigger than mine.

821
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:05,199
Fuck you, Peter.

822
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,134
Enjoy your alone time.

823
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:09,870
Bye.

824
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,573
Fuck you, man!

825
00:46:11,606 --> 00:46:13,508
Fucking piece of shit.

826
00:46:51,546 --> 00:46:53,581
What the fuck are you doing,
man?

827
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:43,230
War, damn, Seahawk!

828
00:47:43,263 --> 00:47:45,032
How did they
leave him wide open?

829
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:47,434
Must be painful
being an A&M fan.

830
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:49,504
Uh, you tell her, Neil.

831
00:47:49,738 --> 00:47:51,905
Oh, man, hell of
a series by Barker there.

832
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:54,041
Pouncin' on 'em
like kittens on a string.

833
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:56,310
Yeah, yeah.

834
00:47:56,778 --> 00:47:59,012
I don't know who would
want to be a Commonwealth fan.

835
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:00,247
Wanna go upstairs?

836
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:02,584
Yeah. Okay.

837
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:04,151
- Okay?
- Yeah.

838
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:14,495
Who's that?

839
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,498
- What do you mean who's that?
- Why is there an old man here?

840
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:20,134
Oh, man, what a game!

841
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:22,436
Why is he
dressed like a referee?

842
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:23,937
I don't know.

843
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:27,408
Okay, I'm going to the bathroom.

844
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:42,289
Hey, where you going?

845
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,324
To pick up my pizza.

846
00:48:44,692 --> 00:48:47,194
God, it's just pizza.

847
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,397
Hey, you're getting breadsticks?

848
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:03,678
Stop it. No.

849
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:06,581
Alright, well...

850
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:09,383
let's just t--talk.

851
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:12,319
- Just talk.
- Mm-hm.

852
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:14,955
- Alright, just talk.
- Yeah.

853
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:18,693
Sharon and I are done.

854
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:22,229
You know, we should
say anything to her or...

855
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:27,401
I mean, she knows
that we're-- we're over.

856
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:31,639
Maybe I should.
I've known her my whole life.

857
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:32,707
Yeah.

858
00:49:32,907 --> 00:49:34,975
Never not told her anything.

859
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,580
Fair, yeah.
So, you wanna...

860
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:42,182
t-- t--
take our time with it?

861
00:49:43,383 --> 00:49:45,753
- If that's okay.
- Yeah.

862
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:47,221
Okay.

863
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:50,290
I r-- I really like you.

864
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:52,760
I like you, too.

865
00:49:53,628 --> 00:49:56,430
- Thank you for understanding.
- Of course.

883
00:52:01,956 --> 00:52:04,358
Hey, you were in the bathroom
for a really long time.

884
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:06,360
Are you okay?

885
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:08,428
Yeah, gross. Be a lady.

886
00:52:09,262 --> 00:52:10,430
Well, it's halftime,

887
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,867
so can we please go
to Catfish Cabin?

888
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:15,870
Oh, wow,
let me think about that.

889
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:18,806
- Please.
- Mm, mm, yes.

890
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,340
Really?

891
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:21,408
- Yes. I said yes.
- Do you wanna come?

892
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:23,343
- I'm game.
- Yeah!

893
00:52:23,377 --> 00:52:25,580
Okay. Ooh-wooh, Catfish Cabin!

894
00:52:25,613 --> 00:52:27,414
- Catfish Cabin.
- Wooh!

895
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:31,619
Hey, ladies,
y'all be safe, okay?

896
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:33,855
And be sure to hurry back
for the third quarter.

897
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:36,423
That's when the game
gets real fun.

898
00:52:51,973 --> 00:52:53,440

899

What for?

I'm sure he's already got
George up there untyin' him.

964
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:02,563
Hmm.

965
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,422
Peter, it's Angela.

966
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,162
Come on,
I'm gonna try to apologize.

967
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:42,703
God, you're such a dick.
Okay, fine! Fine!

00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:48,743
Angela?

970
00:56:49,744 --> 00:56:50,978
Angela!

971
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,850
- What? Oh, my God.
- Angela, right behind you!

972
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:07,561
That's a 15-yard penalty
on Angela

973
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:10,731
for stayin' in
an abusive relationship.

974
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:14,669
You know, we're lucky.

975
00:57:15,236 --> 00:57:18,806
It's the seventh year in a row
since the last murder spree.

976
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:21,075
I wouldn't call us lucky.

977
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:24,145
It had nothin' to do with us.
We were like 15 the last time.

978
00:57:24,378 --> 00:57:26,113
The last time what?

979
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:28,916
The last time Jack Harding
went on a murder spree.

980
00:57:29,717 --> 00:57:30,885
It's true.

981
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:32,520
He's the boogeyman
of Hackleburg.

982
00:57:33,054 --> 00:57:35,022
He's killed at least 50 people.

983
00:57:35,056 --> 00:57:37,224
And he only comes out
on the third Saturday

984
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:38,458
in October.

985
00:57:38,893 --> 00:57:40,594
You know, that's today, right?

986
00:57:40,695 --> 00:57:42,697
What does he do
the rest of the time?

987
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,099
<i>Alright,</i>
<i>here's Fanning under center.</i>

988
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:46,901
<i>Takes a snap and drops back.</i>

989

- <i>He's looking to go deep.</i>

990
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,103
- Oh, no!
- <i>He has a man open.</i>

991
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:51,105
- No! No, no, no, no!
- <i>He's got 'em!</i>

992
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:54,709
- <i>What a catch!</i>
- Son-of-a-bitch!

993
00:57:56,844 --> 00:57:58,546
<i>We need to see</i>
<i>the replay for this one.</i>

994
00:57:59,246 --> 00:58:02,216
No, thank you,
I do not want to see the replay.

995
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:03,851
We're good.

996
00:58:05,953 --> 00:58:06,887
Hey, guys.

997
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:08,723
Oh hey, Sharon.

998
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,759
<i>Look at this</i>
<i>nice tight spiral.</i>

999
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:14,095
<i>Fanning takes the snap</i>
<i>and he fumbles it!</i>

1000
00:58:14,128 --> 00:58:15,796
This pizza's ice cold.

1001
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:17,098
It was cold
by the time I picked it up,

1002
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:19,033
and now it might
as well be frozen.

1003
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,670
Well hell,
just go heat it up in the oven.

1004
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,538
I'm sure Peter won't mind.

1005
00:58:24,572 --> 00:58:26,774
And if he does, he can suck it.

1006
00:58:28,009 --> 00:58:30,277
Good idea, Lester.
You think of everything.

1007
00:59:04,812 --> 00:59:06,747
<i>And it's so good</i>
<i>to see John Rider</i>

1008
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:07,815

1009

1011
00:59:12,353 --> 00:59:13,854

1012
00:59:14,155 --> 00:59:15,856
Uh, Let's see.

1013
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,826
George vanished upstairs
a long time ago.

1014
00:59:20,628 --> 00:59:22,897
Angela went to
hook up with Peter.

1015
00:59:24,265 --> 00:59:26,867
And Holcomb and Maggie
went to Catfish Cabin

1016
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:27,902
with the kid.

1017
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:31,305
What a night. I'm starving.

1018
00:59:32,006 --> 00:59:34,875
What,
you don't like cold pizza?

1019
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:38,312
There's literally
nothing worse than cold pizza.

1020
00:59:48,422 --> 00:59:49,323
I'm gonna heat it up

1021
00:59:49,356 --> 00:59:51,125
so the cheese
is meltin' off each slice.

1022
00:59:51,158 --> 00:59:52,827
It's gonna be so good.

1023
00:59:53,494 --> 00:59:56,897
Heck, don't get it too hot.
You'll burn it.

1024
00:59:57,331 --> 00:59:59,366
I won't burn it.
I love it hot.

1025
01:00:00,701 --> 01:00:02,736
Say, I'd love a slice.

1026
01:00:02,903 --> 01:00:05,039
Sure. You guys can have some.

1027
01:00:05,072 --> 01:00:06,373
None for me.

1028
01:00:07,408 --> 01:00:09,076
I don't eat pizza.

1029
01:00:09,844 --> 01:00:12,246
Got it. More for me.

1030
01:00:12,947 --> 01:00:13,848
Hey!

1031
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:16,217
Sounds like
a rainstorms are comin' in.

1032
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:20,888
Hope not. I hate rain.

1033
01:00:20,988 --> 01:00:22,323
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1034
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:40,374
Fuck.
I can't do anything right.

1035
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:50,751
Dang,
I guess she done burned herself

1036
01:00:50,784 --> 01:00:51,986
with that pizza.

1037
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:54,054
I told her
she was gonna get it too hot.

1038
01:00:54,623 --> 01:00:57,358
That's definitely why
I don't eat pizza.

1039
01:01:22,183 --> 01:01:24,885
- Oh, man. Shit.
- Oh, horseshit!

1040
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:27,054
<i>What an incredible play</i>
<i>by the Commonwealth!</i>

1041
01:01:27,087 --> 01:01:28,322
Damn it.

1042
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,124
I think these refs
are bein' paid.

1043
01:01:30,157 --> 01:01:32,893
I don't know. Maybe.

1044
01:01:53,914 --> 01:01:55,015
Oh, God!

1045
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:57,318
- Well, hell.
- We oughtta help her.

1046
01:01:58,018 --> 01:02:00,254
That sounds like
a job for you, Neil.

1047
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:01,488
I'm on it.

1048
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:07,861
Hey, bring me a slice
if there's any left.

1049
01:02:25,446 --> 01:02:27,314
Hello, Sharon!

1050
01:02:30,351 --> 01:02:32,086
Earth to Sharon.

1051
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:34,054
Come in, Sharon.

1052
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:48,168
That's 15-yard penalty on Sharon
for burning the pizza.

1053
01:02:55,109 --> 01:02:57,311
Seriously, where are you?

1054
01:03:02,016 --> 01:03:05,352
She burnt the pizza to a crisp,
but I can't find her.

1055
01:03:06,153 --> 01:03:09,356
Heck, she must be so embarrassed
that she's hidin' away.

1056
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,592
<i>I'm attorney Alex Shunnarah.</i>

1058
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:15,029
- Hey, Neil.
- Yeah, buddy.

1059
01:03:15,062 --> 01:03:17,865
I hate to bother you,
but I gotta go pee.

1060
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:20,000
Yeah, no problem, my friend.

1061
01:03:20,034 --> 01:03:22,136
I'll just wheel you
over to the bathroom.

1062
01:03:22,169 --> 01:03:26,206
Neil, Neil, buddy,
the bathroom, it's upstairs.

1063
01:03:29,176 --> 01:03:30,344

1064
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:31,945
<i>Took everyone in this room</i>

<i>I can't do this myself!</i>

1066
01:03:34,048 --> 01:03:36,183
Now is not the time
for semantics, Neil!

1067
01:03:36,216 --> 01:03:37,951
Maybe we should
go untie Peter.

1068
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:39,453
- Where's George?
- No!

1069
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,388
We can do this!

1070
01:03:41,523 --> 01:03:43,924
We? What do you have,
a rat in your pocket?

1071
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:45,459
Maybe I do, Neil!

1072
01:03:47,595 --> 01:03:49,096
We need help!

1073

1090

1091
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:42,249

No, I'm just goin' next door

1205
01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:21,369
I'll be right back.

1206
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:23,070
Well, I'm gonna
get a little scared

1207
01:13:23,104 --> 01:13:24,805
being here by myself.

1208
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:26,574
You have nothin'
to be scared of.

1209
01:13:26,607 --> 01:13:29,010
- It's okay.
- What about Jack Harding?

1210
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,045
Holcomb was
just messing with you.

1211
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:33,514
Jack Harding died
a long time ago.

1212
01:13:33,614 --> 01:13:36,017
Mm, let's say hypothetically,

1213
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:39,053
if he actually came,
what should I do?

1214
01:13:39,353 --> 01:13:41,555
If Jack Harding
actually came here,

1215
01:13:42,623 --> 01:13:44,058
take these two fingers,

1216
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:46,093
you jab 'em
right into his eyeballs

1217
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:47,929
stab really far back,

1218
01:13:47,962 --> 01:13:50,131
and then you're gonna
karate-chop him in his throat

1219
01:13:50,164 --> 01:13:51,999
like that,
so he can't breathe,

1220
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:53,601
and then you
kick him in the balls,

1221
01:13:53,634 --> 01:13:54,902
and then you take
the sharpest thing

1222
01:13:54,936 --> 01:13:58,072
you could find, and stab him.

1223
01:13:58,105 --> 01:13:59,840
- Okay?
- Okay.

1224
01:13:59,941 --> 01:14:01,709
Or you probably
don't have to do that,

1225
01:14:01,742 --> 01:14:03,945
cause I would never let
anything happen to you, okay?

1226
01:14:03,978 --> 01:14:06,180
Just leave it all to me.
I got you.

1227
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:08,616
- Same.
- Okay.

1228
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:12,820
Be back in a jiff.

1229
01:14:14,956 --> 01:14:16,157
- Hey, Maggs.
- Mm-hm?

1230
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:18,192
Thanks for the catfish.

1231
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:19,961
You got it.

1232
01:14:19,994 --> 01:14:22,029
Plenty more
catfish dinners to come.

1233

Jack Kevorkian to you?

1318

where's this damn elevator?

1320
01:23:28,776 --> 01:23:30,745
Oh, yo, come on, doc, man,
this man is done.

1321
01:23:30,778 --> 01:23:32,747

Come on!

1324
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:38,753

You go take the stairs.

1325
01:23:43,223 --> 01:23:45,392

1326
01:23:45,425 --> 01:23:47,494

1327

Come on, come on!

1328
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:52,366
Alright, let's go.

1329
01:23:58,138 --> 01:23:59,741
Just get in here, come on!

1330
01:24:01,475 --> 01:24:04,546
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is my defining moment.

1331
01:24:11,184 --> 01:24:12,754
What's up
with this damn elevator?

1332
01:24:54,261 --> 01:24:57,464
You know, you're handling this
really well for a little girl.

1333
01:24:58,131 --> 01:25:00,568
Yeah,
I can deal with conflict.

1334
01:25:00,602 --> 01:25:02,904
Well, don't worry.

1335
01:25:02,937 --> 01:25:05,707
That bad man's
not gonna hurt anybody else.

1336
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:06,874
He's as good as dead.

1337
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:10,578
Yeah, right.
He'll never be dead.
