1
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:15,710
Our solar system was formed over

2
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:17,076
4.6 billion years ago

3
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:20,077
in a galaxy called the milky way.

4
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:22,643
There are nine planets total

5
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:24,580
some experts would
argue eight

6
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:26,921
not counting Pluto,
a dwarf planet.

7
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:27,866
But I say nine

8
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:30,334
Mars is my favorite.

9
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:40,467
Ladies and gentlemen

10
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:42,669
I'd like you to meet
my good friend

11
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,270
former astronaut
Commander Perry Scott.

12
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:47,056
He led two Shuttle missions

13
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:49,509
and is now in charge
of rocket production

14
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,785
at Cape Canaveral.

15
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,745
Every planet is different,

16
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:55,006
I want to visit them all,

17
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,892
sail around the solar system.

18
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:58,003
Like Magellan

19
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:00,399
who circumnavigated
the globe.

20
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,060
When I grow up

21
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:05,242
I, Bradley Maguire

22
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:07,835
will circumnavigate
the solar system

23
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:09,981
and this model
will be my guide.

24
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:11,989
I want you
to see some others.

25
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,265
There's some great
ones back here.

26
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,442
Is anyone listening to me?

27
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:22,343
Hello?

28
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:44,829
It looks so,

29
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,091
real.

30
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:47,891
Stop!

31
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,699
Gee thanks!
A chocolate crater on Mars.

32
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:56,455
Unbelievable.

33
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:03,942
Hey what do you
think of my exhibit,

34
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,373
is it worth your vote?

35
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,285
It looks cool

36
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:10,748
but it doesn't do anything.

37
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:13,935
I want more chocolate.

38
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:17,832
Very precise rendition.

39
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:21,280
Enjoy your chocolate.

40
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:43,394
Bradley Maguire?

41
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:51,360
Aborting the mission, right?

42
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:54,990
Nobody cares.

43
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,161
Son,

44
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,295
with the exception of that

45
00:04:58,296 --> 00:04:59,336
chocolate crater

46
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,894
this is one of the most detailed

47
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,599
accurate models of Mars
I've ever seen.

48
00:05:06,152 --> 00:05:07,517
The Valles Marineris.

49
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:09,646
Impressive.

50
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,174
So you realize
what a waste of time it was.

51
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:13,102
What about that

52
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:16,028
one vote I saw you dump out?
What about him?

53
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:17,701
Some schmuck.

54
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,020
When I was a kid,

55
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,426
all I wanted was
to be an astronaut.

56
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:27,717
At that time sending
a man into space was

57
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:29,327
unthinkable.

58
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:33,216
But do you know
what my dad said to me?

59
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:34,874
the universe

60
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,537
is your playground.

61
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:41,972
Keep your chin up.

62
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:58,763
Up in the sky, look!
- It's a bird.

63
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:00,649
It's a plane. It's Superman.

64
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,990
We're here at the top of the hour

65
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:05,549
at Kennedy Space Center
with this breaking news.

66
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,323
We now join Katy Collins
broadcasting

67
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:08,873
live from Rocket Garden.

68
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:11,149
Last night at 8:51 pm

69
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,009
NASA lost communication

70
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,590
with the Horizon 1

71
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,858
the first manned spacecraft
en route to Mars.

72
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,305
The craft is scheduled to arrive
on the red planet in 2 weeks.

73
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:24,868
NASA experts are working
to reestablish communication

74
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:26,808
with the astronauts on board.

75
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:29,214
but so far
their efforts have proven

76
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:30,704
unsuccessful.

77
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:34,378
NASA made their first public
statement early this morning

78
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,289
around 6:00 am

79
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:37,530
acknowledging that the
crew members families

80
00:07:37,531 --> 00:07:39,627
had been notified
late last night.

81
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:43,202
NASA did not go into great detail
as to what exactly happened.

82
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:45,608
But we have with us
Dr. Carl Spence,

83
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,703
NASA's emergency strategist
on the line inside NASA headquarters.

84
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:52,889
Dr. Spence when did you
last hear from the crew?

85
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,795
We lost communication
last night at precisely 8:51 pm.

86
00:07:57,915 --> 00:08:00,399
Dr. Spence
what is the state of the crew?

87
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,389
The ship is currently
what we call transit float.

88
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,885
Whoa!

89
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:05,791
In other words.

90
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:09,497
Look what you have done.
I am so telling on you.

91
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:11,653
I, I didn't mean to.

92
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,695
We assume
the astronauts are continuing

93
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:33,361
on their plotted trajectory.

94
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:36,699
Which is exactly what the ship's
computers are programmed to do.

95
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,985
We have no reason to believe
the astronauts have deviated off course.

96
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,431
As such we will continue
to monitor their trajectory

97
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:46,369
and hope to reestablish
communication soon.

98
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:47,497
At this point,

99
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,622
all we can do, is wait.

100
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:19,268
The ship was burned to pieces.

101
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:40,118
Stop it!

102
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:41,595
Stop it!

103
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,385
You don't care!

104
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:45,008
What?

105
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,382
They're dead!

106
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:48,607
We're not dead!

107
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:49,444
We're out

108
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:51,188
that's how the game works.

109
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:52,424
Dodgeball!

110
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,157
Yeah that's it.
- Dodgeball!

111
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:56,824
I'm trying to tell you something.
- Whoa!

112
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:58,125
Stop it!

113
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,407
Yes. - Yeah.
- Stop it!

114
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:03,458
Oops!

115
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:04,755
Are you okay?

116
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:08,575
I think you killed him.
- Is he dead?

117
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:09,904
I should have dodged.

118
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:11,500
It's dodgeball.

119
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:13,851
If you don't move
there are consequences.

120
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,544
Dodged. Dodged.

121
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:27,658
Dodged.

122
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,589
Dodged. That's it!
Dodged!

123
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:33,032
Did we scramble his brain?

124
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,568
We better go see if he's okay.

125
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:54,233
He's lost it.

126
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:56,434
Yes! Yes!

127
00:10:57,194 --> 00:10:58,094
Yes!

128
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,282
Hey can you guys help me?

129
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:02,226
You figured that out yourself?

130
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:03,156
Yes.

131
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:05,172
Well. - Wouldn't their
eggs destroy the spaceship?

132
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,141
I mean if they were
the size of school buses.

133
00:11:07,142 --> 00:11:08,683
I was almost hit
by a school bus once.

134
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:09,341
Shut up!

135
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:10,871
That's what I thought,

136
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:11,912
but take a look.

137
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:15,115
At first I thought the ship
must have exploded, but

138
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:16,689
you see how
it's more like a streak

139
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,195
then just a round explosion.

140
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:19,686
Wouldn't NASA know about this?

141
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:21,639
They're like the smartest
people in the world.

142
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,958
How could they miss it?

143
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,426
Well NASA thinks
the astronauts are still on course.

144
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:27,668
Which is what the ship's computers
are programmed to do.

145
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:29,431
At least that is what NASA says.

146
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,057
But I think they dodged.

147
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,095
They knew they had
to get out there fast

148
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:34,808
to avoid the meteors
headed their way.

149
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:35,709
Blast off!

150
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:38,604
The rocks must have damaged
the spacecraft's antenna.

151
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:41,088
Which is why we can't
communicate with them.

152
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,808
NASA probably lost contact
with them before they dodged.

153
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:46,859
And I think they're looking
in the wrong place.

154
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,355
But they're out there.

155
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,865
We just need to find them.

156
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:11,650
Wait a second,
something is not right.

157
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,341
Neptune, Jupiter, switch.

158
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:26,704
Perfect!

159
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:29,654
Now that the planets
are in place, wind strength.

160
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:32,954
Hey, could you turn Mars slowly?
I need to make some estimates.

161
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:34,320
Mars is approximately

162
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:37,036
2,940,000 kilometers from earth.

163
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,798
They were only two weeks away.

164
00:12:40,908 --> 00:12:43,533
And so from out of nowhere,
came the meteors.

165
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:46,004
They dodged,
sending them off course.

166
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:49,301
Traveling so fast
they'd be...keep turning.

167
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:52,808
Keep turning, keep turning.

168
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,871
Keep turning, keep turning.

169
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:56,654
There!

170
00:12:57,926 --> 00:12:58,826
They'd be,

171
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:00,842
landing on Mars?

172
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,527
Just in the wrong place.

173
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:11,150
I've got an idea.

174
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:25,452
I know, I know.
- This is important!

175
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:27,374
I need to see
Commander Perry Scott!

176
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,481
I don't think you kids
are authorized to be here.

177
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:32,887
And besides,
where are your parents?

178
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:34,648
We came here on our bikes.

179
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:35,689
Alone. And you?

180
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:39,664
Please let us in.
Lives are at stake!

181
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:40,770
Security!

182
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:41,904
Security!

183
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:43,362
Security!

184
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:44,882
NASA's failed
attempts to locate and

185
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:47,217
reestablish communication
with the astronauts... .

186
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:48,802
Ah, over here, Security!

187
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:50,208
Spirits across the country are low.

188
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,670
Psst! Come on guys.

189
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:53,816
Kids!
- Come on!

190
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:55,907
Commander,

191
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:57,988
you should take a look at this.

192
00:13:58,562 --> 00:13:59,868
I need to get through
to mission control.

193
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:00,670
Listen, kid.

194
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:02,416
No, you listen to me!

195
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:04,048
I need everybody
to listen to me!

196
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,284
Lives are at stake!

197
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:06,970
There are a bunch
of astronauts up there,

198
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,668
and I think they're in trouble.

199
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:10,226
I think I know how to find them.

200
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:12,133
Commander, I hope
you're out there.

201
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,399
I need you to get down here,

202
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,429
I have something to show you.

203
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:36,689
Congratulations, Bradley!

204
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,007
You did it.

205
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,031
Congratulations, to all of you.

206
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:46,151
I have something to show you.

207
00:14:46,357 --> 00:14:47,257
Follow me.

208
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,546
Cool.
- Awesome. - Wow.

209
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:57,847
I can't believe it.
- Amazing.

210
00:14:57,937 --> 00:15:00,202
I want to be
an astronaut some day.

211
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:03,648
Yeah Bradley,
can we go to space with you?

212
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:05,087
Of course.

213
00:15:05,844 --> 00:15:06,744
The universe,

214
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:08,310
is your playground.

215
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:13,447
The End

216
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:13,997
