1
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:27,860
Coming soon
from Love Shack International!

2
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,870
Oh.

3
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,120
You might want to slow down
a little bit there, soldier.

4
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,953
Oh.

5
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,458
I haven't had anything to
drink in quite a while, so

6
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,107
I better indulge myself just a little bit.

7
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:43,340
And I'm kind of sick of
corn liquor, you know,

8
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,240
because, you know, well,

9
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,506
you see what's around us.
- Corn, yeah.

10
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:47,339
Yeah.

11
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:48,172
I get that.

12
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:49,005
Well I'm just glad

13
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:51,570
that you came back with me after Cornfest.

14
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,329
I feel privileged.

15
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:56,329
You're the winner of
the corn eating contest.

16
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,680
- Well, you know,

17
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,062
I have an affinity for corn, and,

18
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:06,045
Mmmm, and, you know

19
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,290
I figured that I'm the king of this area

20
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,130
and I figured I could
eat my weight in corn.

21
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,100
And by god, I'm gonna do so.

22
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,970
- Sounds like it.

23
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,680
But I tell you what, the corn around here,

24
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,660
I hear they use growth hormones,

25
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,130
and all kinds of weird stuff.

26
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,110
Like I even heard people
have seen lights around here,

27
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,900
and some people are even saying

28
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,000
there are some alien growth
hormone rays or something?

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,260
- Alien growth what?

30
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,093
Alien growth hormone?

31
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:37,961
- I read it in your brother's newspaper.

32
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:39,160
- Oh.

33
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,570
I guess.

34
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,403
Yeah I guess he don't get,

35
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:43,440
he'll do anything to get news these days.

36
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,460
- No, I mean he's got,

37
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,960
have you seen his YouTube channel?

38
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,773
He's got video of Bigfoot.

39
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:52,561
- It's probably his wife,
you know, dressed up

40
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:53,420
in some kind of
- No, I heard.

41
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,700
- For the movies.
- I heard Dilbert

42
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,963
came out here, and nobody's seen him.

43
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,490
- And she doesn't shave her legs,

44
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,586
it could have just been her

45
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:02,320
and they could have been doing something,

46
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,802
God knows what, I mean.

47
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:06,434
Whatever, you've
had too much to drink.

48
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:07,909
Oh, I'm just getting started.

49
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:12,228
- No, I think we need to get
up and get some exercise.

50
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:13,062
- Oh.

51
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:15,257
- What do you say if we play

52
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:18,279
a little hide and seek out here,

53
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,529
see if there is a monster out there

54
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,184
and maybe you might find
me in my birthday suit?

55
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:25,793
Well, I tell you what.

56
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,644
I'll give you a 10 swig head start.

57
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,820
- 10 swigs and I don't think

58
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,370
you're gonna make it off this blanket.

59
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,023
But, let's see.

60
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,943
- Ooh.

61
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,663
- Come on!

62
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,303
Get your drunk ass up, buddy!

63
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:54,228
- All right, baby, ready or not,

64
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,228
here I come!

65
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:57,640
- Hey!

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,403
Come on, Corn King!

67
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,043
I got something you're gonna want.

68
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,943
- Actually, ooh!

69
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,463
Oh, my goodness, what do we got here?

70
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,663
Oooh, baby!

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,110
- Did you find that?

72
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,563
I got something else for you too.

73
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,013
Drunk ass motherfucker, find that.

74
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:35,770
- Oh!

75
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,130
Oh yeah baby,

76
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,457
I think there's a monster in here now.

77
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,153
Just wait till I get my pants down.

78
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,023
Ooh.

79
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,440
- Hello, Mr. Drunky.

80
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,361
Got another thing for ya!

81
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:55,861
What in the hell?!

82
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,920
Is that a corn cob?

83
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,440
Or are you just happy to see me?

84
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,883
Weird ass scarecrow.

85
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:08,347
Well here you go.

86
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:12,340
'Cause my man's probably
drunk somewhere passed out.

87
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,173
You're not.

88
00:06:15,564 --> 00:06:16,620
All right, come get me,

89
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,410
you got competition, boy!

90
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,792
- Oh, god.

91
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:24,687
Who the?

92
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:26,660
Who the hell is that?

93
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,883
Hey babe, what kind of
kinky shit are you into?

94
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:37,363
I'm just gonna sit and relax
for a minute.

95
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:45,558
- Where the hell are you?

96
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,263
Oh my god.

97
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:55,082
I'm gonna leave you one
more thing down here.

98
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,393
Best be finding it for me.

99
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:11,623
Oh my god.

100
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:14,470
I think I'm gonna go take my chances

101
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,423
with the corn stalk dude back there.

102
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:20,253
At least the shark had a hard-on.

103
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,913
All right.

104
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,007
You got one more chance.

105
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:31,448
Come and get 'em!

106
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:48,942
Where the hell is he?

107
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:53,870
Shark!

108
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,760
- Time to kill.

109
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:26,070
- Yeah, I'm fine.

110
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,060
I just don't want you
to worry about me, okay?

111
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,110
And don't send anybody
here to check on me.

112
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,240
I hate when it's totally dark.

113
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,723
Hey, sis, I've gotta go, okay?

114
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,220
Okay, yeah, I'll talk
to you in a little bit.

115
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,120
Okay, bye.

116
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,793
Wow, look at you.

117
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,760
You're all dressed up an incognito.

118
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,460
I thought the coronavirus is over by now.

119
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,103
Or so I thought anyway.

120
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,623
Are you looking to party by chance?

121
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,653
Do you have a room here?

122
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,123
Okay, here's the deal.

123
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,730
It's 60 up front and 60 when we're done.

124
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,563
Is that okay?

125
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,223
Now aren't you the true gentleman?

126
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:34,923
With all those teeth.

127
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:39,470
With all those sharp teeth,

128
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,573
I bet you love to bite,
don't you?

129
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,410
Oh, wow!

130
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,053
Oh my god, look at all of this cool stuff!

131
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,513
Dude, you must really be
into sharks or something.

132
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,400
You know, you can bite me

133
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,613
at no extra charge.

134
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:12,571
Oh my god!

135
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,463
Like what is all of this stuff?

136
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:34,830
- The Great White.

137
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,173
It's the greatest
creature that ever lived.

138
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:39,560
- Hmm.

139
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,723
- They are goddesses.

140
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,910
Sharks are older than trees,
you know, and dinosaurs.

141
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,343
450 million years old.

142
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,803
They don't age, they don't get cancer.

143
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,053
Strong, fearless.

144
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,583
Merciless.

145
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,540
The only species to have survived

146
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,273
four out of the five extinctions.

147
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,623
Nobody knows the power of the Great White.

148
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,543
But they're about to find out.

149
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,323
We are one with them.

150
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:29,780
- Okay, so what are you like,

151
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,650
a Marine Biologist or something?

152
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:36,650
Like George Costanza?

153
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,277
- Yeah it's something like that.

154
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,363
- Oh, okay.

155
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,593
- He's an inspiration.

156
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:48,066
Hmm.

157
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,935
Ooh, what do you have here?

158
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,061
That's a nice big set
of teeth you have there.

159
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:00,437
- Mhmm.

160
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:01,753
Do you like those?
- Are you gonna

161
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:03,861
bite me with this or something?

162
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:06,944
- Oh, you are so good at what you do.

163
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,168
Try this on.

164
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:16,053
- I'm gonna wear this like a crown?

165
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:54,984
- All hail Carcharodon carcharias!

166
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,880
The true goddesses of this world!

167
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,470
This is your bidding, Chichimatul.

168
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,598
This is my offering.

169
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:11,598
All true believers will persevere

170
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,083
in the war that is about to conclude!

171
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,910
My work is near complete.

172
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,240
- So tell me again what happened here.

173
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,140
- The last thing I remember

174
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,950
is that we came back from the festival,

175
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,040
and that we decided to
have some alone time,

176
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,864
and I kinda want to spend a little,

177
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:20,329
you know, a little time
with Susan, you know?

178
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,550
Anyway, we decided to have a few drinks,

179
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,400
and things got a little heated

180
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,780
and we decided to play a
little strip and go seek.

181
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,623
And she took off.

182
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,540
- So in other words,
you made a pass at her,

183
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,360
she didn't like it, she got pissed off,

184
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,870
you got too aggressive,

185
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,810
and then she bought off?

186
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,490
- Wait, no, Constable.

187
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,110
It was absolutely nothing like that.

188
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,090
I mean, I had a few drinks and we were

189
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,090
running through here,

190
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,830
I was picking up her
clothes as we went along,

191
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,030
and things were getting exciting.

192
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,215
And I just must have had too much to drink

193
00:17:58,215 --> 00:18:00,000
and I passed out.

194
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,327
- And you didn't see
anything or hear anything?

195
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:06,250
- I mean, no I didn't, honest to God.

196
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,090
You gotta believe me, I didn't.

197
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,563
- Well, what do you make
of that mauling she got?

198
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,860
- From the looks of things, it looks,

199
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,210
I mean it could have been a wild animal.

200
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,060
I mean, it could have been a Bigfoot.

201
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,150
- Bigfoot, aliens?

202
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,693
You and your brother Jonathan
would like that wouldn't you?

203
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:23,810
It'd be great press and
publicity for his newspaper

204
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,200
and real estate ventures.

205
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,230
Get people to come out here

206
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,400
and buy some of these farms,
look for old Sasquatch.

207
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,403
By the way, your brother, where is he?

208
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:35,400
- I don't know, it's not
like I keep up with him.

209
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,900
- Don't get smart with me, Gary.

210
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,600
We got ourselves a murder
investigation here.

211
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,150
Susan Blake was a beautiful,

212
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,900
well loved woman in these parts.

213
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,170
Church goer.

214
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,830
She was a librarian for God's sakes!

215
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,610
I'm inclined to believe
that you and your brother

216
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,500
had something to do with
this for your own reasons.

217
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,639
That's what I'm talking about, bubba.

218
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:54,540
- Seriously?

219
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,840
I mean, have you seen
the bites and scratches?

220
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,003
- I've seen them.

221
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:00,390
You guys could have made anything up

222
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,350
to make that happen.

223
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,710
And it got all creature features

224
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,120
with some device or something like that.

225
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,770
Where'd you say your brother was?

226
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,600
- As far as I know, he was in Lexington

227
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,193
doing a real estate videoing
and showing some houses.

228
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,170
Doing his damn job.

229
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,350
- Well, I wanna talk with him.

230
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,000
In the meantime, I'm
gonna take your fat ass

231
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,250
down to the station,

232
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,650
I'm gonna process you

233
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,950
and then we're gonna
investigate this further.

234
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,857
- Whatever, flathead.

235
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,080
- Officer Rosenberg, anything
from our field team out there?

236
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,787
- Just a scarecrow with a shark head,

237
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:43,763
and Susan's tracks,

238
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,403
and lots and lots of condoms.

239
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,820
Should we close the cornfield?

240
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,830
- No, no, I don't think we
should be closing the cornfields.

241
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,080
We got everything we need right here.

242
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,630
Besides, it's harvest season.

243
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,183
People gotta pay their bills.

244
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,050
- Right.

245
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,535
- Shark scarecrow?

246
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:06,368
Huh!

247
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:01,004
- Any problems?

248
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:04,760
- Not like we haven't faced
third world shitholes before.

249
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,327
- All right.

250
00:24:06,327 --> 00:24:08,270
Let me get your money.

251
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,330
Half now, half after I sell the item

252
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,820
like we agreed.

253
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,417
- Sounds like a deal to
me, let's make it happen.

254
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:41,447
Fucker!

255
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,880
- Sorry to be a Danny Downer, guys,

256
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,397
but this is just too important.

257
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,323
Life, it's rougher than a cob, ain't it?

258
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,560
Get a good nap in while
I finish this work.

259
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,433
- Where are you?

260
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,253
I know I saw you in here.

261
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,983
Come to mama.

262
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,583
My, my, my!

263
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,053
What big feet you have.

264
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,523
I guess I'll just have to
follow your footprints.

265
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,743
Wait, Sasquatch!

266
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,672
Come back!

267
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:29,923
Come back!

268
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:36,648
Come back!

269
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,650
- Hi, I'm Jonathan Gottlieb,

270
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,300
and I'm here to offer you a little slice

271
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,560
of Kentucky Magic right
here at Druid Hills.

272
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,090
You can be a monster hunter!

273
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,150
You can look around for all the creatures

274
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,340
the locals say they see.

275
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,210
And if you're interested,

276
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,220
I'm ready to sell you a property today!

277
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,896
1-800-BIGFEET!

278
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:06,727
That's right 1-800-BIGFEET
for John Gottlieb, that's me.

279
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:09,240
We're Druid Hills Realty all the way!

280
00:27:34,557 --> 00:27:36,790
- Gottlieb, I swear.

281
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,850
You make sure you stay in Druid Hills

282
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,843
with that baloney sandwich stuff.

283
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,420
We got enough problems in this world

284
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,080
without adding Bigfoot
to the mix.

285
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,390
Scheider to Grossman, do you copy?

286
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,900
Copy, Chief, go ahead.

287
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,030
- You got anything going on out there?

288
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,240
No ma'am, hot day.

289
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,343
Candice saw bandits.

290
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,560
Hey, I had Gardner drive by Lorna's place.

291
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,803
Still no sign of her.

292
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,353
- Okay, over and out.

293
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,960
Out, babe.

294
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,940
- I don't think that's protocol, sir.

295
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,690
We wouldn't want another
visit to the HR now, would we?

296
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,327
Oh, ah,
sorry about that, Chief.

297
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,700
- Over and out.

298
00:29:09,636 --> 00:29:11,053
That looks weird.

299
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,533
Hey, Mr. Shark.

300
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:03,454
Got your license and registration on you?

301
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:25,555
Get out of the car!

302
00:30:25,555 --> 00:30:28,263
Get out of the car now!

303
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:35,220
Put your hands up where I can see 'em.

304
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,650
Put your hands up!

305
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:41,641
Put your fucking hands up!

306
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:42,540
What is this crap?!

307
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,700
- Where's your dildo, cop?

308
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,980
- Get up against the car.

309
00:30:54,274 --> 00:30:56,201
I've got you now, you stupid fucking-

310
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:59,670
- You don't know what
the fuck you're doing!

311
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,203
- I know what I'm doing!

312
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,678
Get down on the fucking ground!

313
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,623
- What are you, some fucking monkey, huh?

314
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:10,271
That's excessive force, pig!

315
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:12,250
It's gonna
get even more excessive,

316
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,083
you piece of shit!

317
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,697
- I'm gonna bite you in half.

318
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:22,147
- You're not gonna bite shit!

319
00:31:23,445 --> 00:31:24,451
Roll over.

320
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:35,440
- This is great.

321
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,690
It's all for Chichimatul.

322
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:42,404
- You have the

323
00:31:42,404 --> 00:31:43,470
right to remain-

324
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,206
- Why don't you sit on my
face, you fucking pig?!

325
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,208
- Anything you say or do

326
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,778
can be used against you

327
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:51,132
in a court of law.

328
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:53,200
Court of law?

329
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,203
You're not gonna make
it to the court of law.

330
00:31:55,203 --> 00:31:57,440
Neither are you, you shark boy,

331
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,493
if you keep this fucking shit up!

332
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,751
- Well, well.

333
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:05,496
Don't you look familiar.

334
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,347
- Grossman, I need you to
send some backup right now.

335
00:32:15,514 --> 00:32:17,014
10-4.

336
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:20,715
- Hurry.

337
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,970
- Yes, Gary, how many
times are you gonna call?

338
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,326
This is like the 500th.

339
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,410
I'm really busy right...

340
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,440
Jail?

341
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,790
What are you talking about?

342
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:05,191
What do you mean murder?

343
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:06,790
Okay, okay, just calm down.

344
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,780
Look, I'll be there as fast as I can.

345
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,143
Just hang tight, brother.

346
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,710
- Benchley, I see you made it.

347
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,540
I wish I could say I'm glad to see you.

348
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,990
- Always a pleasure, Jeffrey.

349
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:06,613
I see you have your goon squad with you.

350
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:11,580
- You know you can't be too careful

351
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,545
when you're chasing diamonds in the sky.

352
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,095
- You can never be too careful.

353
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,610
- Certainly.

354
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,233
- So, do you have the item?

355
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,430
- Of course I do.

356
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,963
Not exactly with me, but it's close by.

357
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,993
- So there's a trust issue?

358
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,323
- Sounds like there's a trust issue.

359
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,423
- Let's just say I want
to get the money first.

360
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,430
And then I'll give you the map

361
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,370
that tells you where the item is.

362
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,323
- So where is it?

363
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,243
- Close by.

364
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,340
Do you have the money?

365
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,043
Nice.

366
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,163
All you guys have such
great personalities.

367
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,710
Each one unique and different too.

368
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,560
- Oh, it's so nice of you to notice.

369
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,263
So there is a trust issue.

370
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,830
- I'm not quite sure if
you all are the good guys.

371
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,580
- Murray, Murray, Murray.

372
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,413
Where have you been?

373
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:34,653
We're two decades into
the 21st century, man.

374
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,203
There are no good guys
anymore, just greycoats.

375
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,026
Blending of the dark and the light.

376
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:47,693
Little bit of this and
a little bit of that.

377
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:50,430
- Little bit of this,

378
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,680
and a little bit of that.

379
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,546
- Will you just shut up?

380
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,213
Sorry boss.

381
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,303
- And by the way,

382
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,830
you'll notice, Murray,

383
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:06,110
you don't see any of us
wearing any shark tooth

384
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,460
necklaces or bracelets.

385
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,453
- Gray suits with white bellies.

386
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,593
Just like sharks.

387
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,180
Ready to maul the world.

388
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,770
- Well, well, Murray it really depends

389
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,020
on things like agenda and perspective

390
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,740
if you know what I mean.

391
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,810
- I don't like this guy.

392
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,290
I don't trust him.

393
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,053
- So, do you want the money now or not?

394
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,873
- I guess I do.

395
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,960
And to get as far away
from here as possible.

396
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,650
- Well, you can try.

397
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,900
And the money'll surely
give you that option.

398
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,407
Watch my back.

399
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,603
- Go get that Chichimatul pup.

400
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:15,582
- We're on this shit.

401
00:38:15,802 --> 00:38:17,135
- They're on it.

402
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,233
- They're on it.

403
00:38:32,273 --> 00:38:34,180
- I'm not saying I don't trust you.

404
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,607
I just don't trust you.

405
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,720
- It ain't light, you can trust me.

406
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,723
- You can trust him.

407
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:49,328
- So it says that it's in
one of these, so let's look.

408
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:52,044
- Yeah, it's gotta be
right over here somewhere.

409
00:38:52,044 --> 00:38:54,242
I think it might be,

410
00:38:54,242 --> 00:38:55,909
did we pass the row?

411
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,363
Wait, what's that?

412
00:38:58,363 --> 00:39:00,064
- Wait, hold on, hold this.

413
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:00,897
I'll look.

414
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:05,928
I think I found it!

415
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:17,219
- Oh yes!

416
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:18,052
We got it.

417
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:27,692
Shark!

418
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:37,798
Come on!

419
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:39,049
Come on!

420
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:52,449
- Go, kill it, what are you doing!?

421
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,950
- Double cross!

422
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,860
- Double cross!

423
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,293
- You and your partners!

424
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,103
- Impossible, I silenced them all!

425
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:56,200
- Angelo.

426
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,638
Go get the Chichimatul pup.

427
00:40:58,638 --> 00:40:59,950
Go get the pup!

428
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,895
- Go get the pup!

429
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:01,728
- Get the pup!

430
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:02,561
- I'm sorry, boss!

431
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,220
- Benchley!

432
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,927
Get back here, you scoundrel!

433
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,070
- Benchley's got the,

434
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,560
he's got the shark pup,

435
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,260
he's got the money, he's got both!

436
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,194
- Benchley!

437
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:04,130
Benchley, you're finished!

438
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,350
- You're finished!

439
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,348
I'm so tired.

440
00:43:06,348 --> 00:43:07,498
I don't even wanna eat!

441
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,787
The shark's got Joey and Zoey.

442
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:14,237
You and me go after Benchley.

443
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:17,410
- No, that won't be necessary.

444
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,260
I planned ahead, I planted
a GPS tracking device

445
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,750
in that money bag.

446
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,733
We're gonna be on them like wrath.

447
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,468
- Then off to the eggbeater!

448
00:43:27,468 --> 00:43:28,385
- Let's go.

449
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,320
- Now Teddy, we're gonna
start at the beginning again.

450
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,890
Is that okay?

451
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:45,723
- Yeah.

452
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,127
Sure, you got another milkshake on you?

453
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,933
- When we begin.

454
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,030
This time I'm gonna record you.

455
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,330
Just so you know.

456
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,320
- Yeah, that's fine.

457
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,580
The end is almost upon us anyway, sweety.

458
00:44:05,813 --> 00:44:09,900
Kind of a outdated recorder
machine you got there, huh?

459
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,483
- It's mine from home, if you must know.

460
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,070
And defunding, and the budget cuts

461
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,610
from our police departments,

462
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,140
it's happening everywhere, you know?

463
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,270
- I believe it.

464
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,303
Great White Lives Matter, you know.

465
00:44:24,879 --> 00:44:27,243
- Okay Teddy, that was funny.

466
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,543
Right.

467
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,103
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

468
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,553
Okay, so.

469
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,200
Okay, I'm with Teddy Bo Lucas

470
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,010
in interrogation room
B in Chance Kentucky.

471
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,810
The date is September 13th.

472
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:54,313
And he's speaking to me
of his own free will,

473
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,980
waiving the right to a
lawyer, right, Teddy?

474
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,323
- Correcto mundo.

475
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:02,940
Another milkshake please?

476
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,223
Maybe some fries?

477
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,077
- Well, you're in luck.

478
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:16,433
- All right, all right.

479
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:19,320
- As I was saying,

480
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,894
Teddy also has the right to remain silent.

481
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,460
Anything he says or does

482
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,843
can be used against him in a court of law.

483
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,730
He has waived his right to an attorney

484
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,060
and has been told that one
would be provided for him

485
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,020
if he so desires.

486
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,853
Right, Teddy?

487
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,960
- Surely, yes ma'am.

488
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,273
- All right, Teddy, let's get into things.

489
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,170
So I pulled you over
for a traffic infraction

490
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:56,170
and I found dismembered
body parts in your vehicle.

491
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,120
Are you denying that?

492
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,690
- No denial.

493
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,183
It's just my work.

494
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:04,960
I've been on the road for years

495
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,033
all over the Midwest States.

496
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,280
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,

497
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,900
Ohio, here in Kentucky,

498
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,210
just killing folks.

499
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,260
Killed so many I barely
remember their faces.

500
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,590
- So are you trying to tell me that

501
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,899
you're a mass murderer?

502
00:46:24,899 --> 00:46:28,650
- Well, if that's what
you wanna call it, yes.

503
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,153
This is my calling in life.

504
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,790
- Do you think that
you're the infamous killer

505
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:40,860
that the media has dubbed
"The Great White Ripper"?

506
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,460
Is that what you're telling me?

507
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,640
I mean the one whose favorite way

508
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,160
is to use shark teeth to rip
people's faces off and stuff?

509
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,710
Is that what you're telling me?

510
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,163
- These fries are rubbery.

511
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,093
They are too cold and chewy for my taste.

512
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:01,770
But yes, that's exactly
how I kill someone.

513
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:04,910
I am the shark, the predator.

514
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:07,663
I am one with the Great
White Goddess Chichimatul.

515
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:10,803
- I see.

516
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,240
So how long have you been out there

517
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,710
killing innocent people, Teddy?

518
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:20,109
- Oh, not innocents, no one is innocent.

519
00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:25,109
For they all fall short of
reaching their true potential.

520
00:47:26,132 --> 00:47:29,740
They're not evolved in
any way, shape or form.

521
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,860
The new Chichimatul order is coming.

522
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,020
I kill for sacrifices.

523
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,410
They are martyrs.

524
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:41,410
Their blood will initiate a
new establishment of society.

525
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,307
- And so this Chichimatul, as you call it,

526
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,333
is this your god?

527
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,740
- Goddess.

528
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,230
Great white shark goddess.

529
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,760
There is no higher aspiration
than to be one with her.

530
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,950
To usher in her bidding of a new species

531
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,673
of shark humanoids.

532
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,550
A loftier, perfect new race

533
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:11,943
that will rule the world.

534
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,820
Great Whites are focused,
higher end predators.

535
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,000
They never lose.

536
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,830
A 25 foot torpedo shooting
through the sea like bullets!

537
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,070
Afraid of nothing, propelling themselves

538
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,190
completely out of the
water when necessary.

539
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:31,813
Air demons, no bounds, no mercy.

540
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,553
And their mouths are lined with up to 300

541
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:41,150
serrated, triangular teeth.

542
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,390
And they have an
exceptional sense of smell

543
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,280
to detect prey.

544
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,280
As we will become
sharkanoids from the deep.

545
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,250
They even have organs to sense the tiny

546
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:59,180
electromagnetic fields generated by prey,

547
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,800
and the higher alien
calling of transformation

548
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,083
pulsating from Stonehenge.

549
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,933
Everything is falling
into place as we speak.

550
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,563
We give the world nightmares as it sleeps.

551
00:49:17,802 --> 00:49:21,100
Teddy, you're really starting

552
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,150
to give me a headache
with all this gibberish

553
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,343
that you're just spewing out here.

554
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:29,870
How many people have you
killed out there on the road?

555
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,670
- Oh, I have no clue.

556
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,870
Endless, hundreds, it's simply part

557
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,270
of my process, these sacrifices.

558
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:39,190
The Stonehenge signals tell me what to do,

559
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:42,490
which is why I allowed
myself to be caught.

560
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,673
Things are wrapping up.

561
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,468
- Stonehenge signals?

562
00:49:47,468 --> 00:49:50,963
Like voices
in your head, maybe?

563
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,330
- Pulsing sensations
that mystically guide me.

564
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,710
And I'm not the only one, you know.

565
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,780
There are hundreds more
like me out on the road.

566
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,630
All members of the shark cult
on their way to becoming.

567
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,170
We're not even afraid of the devil, ma'am.

568
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,443
He fears us.

569
00:50:11,479 --> 00:50:13,423
For we have teeth and we bite.

570
00:50:17,354 --> 00:50:21,229
So do you happen
to believe in Bigfoot too?

571
00:50:21,229 --> 00:50:22,530
- Huh?

572
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:23,363
- Never mind.

573
00:50:24,449 --> 00:50:27,366
Nothing.

574
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,263
Teddy, when we first met,

575
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,983
you said I looked familiar.

576
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,763
Do you know this girl?

577
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,510
She's missing.

578
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:46,623
And we found some of her
blood in the motel room.

579
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:52,517
- My, my, she looks a lot like you.

580
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,490
I couldn't be sure, but yeah,

581
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,693
I probably offed her.

582
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:03,663
So many, it's all just a blur of gray.

583
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,863
Like a dead end job, you know?

584
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,573
My reward is in the becoming.

585
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,980
All right, Teddy.

586
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,520
Where are all the bodies buried

587
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,843
of those that you killed?

588
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,400
- I'm not sure.

589
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,151
It's not like there's
an address or anything.

590
00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:26,543
For me, it's just this one cornfield.

591
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,853
I could take you there though, show you.

592
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,610
Once I feel the winding roads,

593
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,780
I know how to get there.

594
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,330
I could ride there blindfolded.

595
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,560
- All right.

596
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,930
Well how about you and
me take a little ride

597
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,233
and you take me there?

598
00:52:04,881 --> 00:52:05,714
- Come on.

599
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:12,527
Ugh!

600
00:52:16,964 --> 00:52:21,164
No!

601
00:52:23,355 --> 00:52:25,390
Piece of shit hole.

602
00:52:27,676 --> 00:52:28,509
Fuck you.

603
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:31,800
Nature walk.

604
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,216
- See if it's here.

605
00:52:38,216 --> 00:52:40,130
Maybe it's over there.

606
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,620
- Come on, I came as soon as I found out.

607
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,600
- I bet you did.

608
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,433
I bet you were the one phone call

609
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:46,000
of your brother Gary.

610
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,060
- I can't believe you're
still holding him.

611
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,410
- Who else am I gonna hold?

612
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,140
He's suspect number one,
and then there's you.

613
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,047
- Me?

614
00:52:53,047 --> 00:52:54,260
Are you out of your mind?

615
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,560
I was in Lexington.

616
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,480
You can check.

617
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,970
And besides, you know Gary
couldn't do anything like that.

618
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,420
It's crazy!

619
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,950
- Well let's see here, what we got here,

620
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,810
Mr. Bob Woodward himself,

621
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:07,260
prize winning editor,
Pulitzer prize Corn Magazine.

622
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,430
But I digress.

623
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,260
Not exactly Rolling Stone.

624
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,400
We got one dead luke blood
local holly here, Susan Blake.

625
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,390
And we got your brother
Gary running around

626
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,600
in the corn fields.

627
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,040
Lots of boozing going on and schmoozing.

628
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,873
Let me ask you a question,

629
00:53:20,873 --> 00:53:22,760
who do you think did it, freaking Bigfoot?

630
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,360
Maybe it was the Bigfoot
in your TV commercial,

631
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,020
the one where brother
Gary is running around

632
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,070
playing the Sasquatch.

633
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,420
- Come on man, quit drinking the Kool Aid.

634
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,760
That doesn't make any sense.

635
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,550
It's bad PR.

636
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:37,040
- Bad PR, good PR,
Bigfoot, you don't care.

637
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,500
Gossip, anything is good

638
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,910
for your own real estate
ventures and publicity.

639
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,310
Well, you know what Gottlieb,

640
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:43,740
nobody likes you in this town

641
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,350
let alone Mayor Zanuck or me.

642
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,220
We don't like the fact that
you came from money, right,

643
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,090
and we had to bust our asses

644
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,470
and make a living
through farming and corn.

645
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,540
You run around with your newspaper,

646
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,510
all your real estate
listings and run this town

647
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,914
airing everybody's dirty laundry

648
00:53:58,914 --> 00:54:01,140
and publicizing it in your newspaper.

649
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,420
Hell, you put the stuff in there

650
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,650
about me and my mistress.

651
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,225
I didn't appreciate that.

652
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:06,300
That caused me a lot of pain.

653
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,520
I almost lost this job.

654
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,363
So don't expect any sympathy
from me, Mr. Money Bags.

655
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:13,840
- Look.

656
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,063
I have something that you need to see.

657
00:54:22,566 --> 00:54:24,730
I was videoing some
properties with my drone

658
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,450
for my real estate videos.

659
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:29,200
And I recorded this.

660
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,300
For the second time.

661
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,450
First time I thought I was,

662
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:35,520
I don't know, hallucinating
or seeing things, but this.

663
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,290
- You expect me to believe there's sharks

664
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:39,780
in the cornfields?

665
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,450
- You can see it with your own eyes!

666
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,550
Kramer, we have got to tell Mayor Zanuck

667
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:47,180
to close down all the corn
fields in Druid Hills!

668
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,200
And then we gotta try and
figure out what's going on.

669
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,220
I've done a little research

670
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,450
and turns out there's a shark cult that,

671
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:53,940
- I had enough of this malarkey.

672
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,120
I want you out of this office right now!

673
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,850
That looks like there's some
clouds in the sky going by

674
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:01,310
or some crazy false computer imagery.

675
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:05,380
You'd do anything to get
publicity for your newspaper.

676
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,930
- Listen to yourself,
Kramer, it makes no sense.

677
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,380
I came as soon as my brother called

678
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,400
I wouldn't have time to
do anything like that.

679
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,000
- Well, furthermore, this
is the best corn harvest

680
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,530
we've had in years.

681
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,040
Weather's been perfect,

682
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,590
everything's been going well.

683
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,900
And if you expect to
come out with one peep

684
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,180
about something as stupid as farmers

685
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,500
and the cornfields, and sharks out there,

686
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,100
I'm gonna have you out of here

687
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,700
for fake news propaganda.

688
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,770
Why don't you put
something in your newspaper

689
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,580
about you and your brother Gary

690
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,370
being indicted for murder?

691
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,060
- Fine, just fine.

692
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,800
Kramer, as ludicrous as it sounds,

693
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,960
those are sharks.

694
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,710
And I know what a shark looks like

695
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:44,860
'cause I keep seeing
them in the cornfields!

696
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,260
Now I've researched what I think this is,

697
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,570
and I'm pretty good at my job.

698
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,690
So you had better do something about this

699
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,610
or you won't have to
worry about getting sued

700
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,530
or being ruined

701
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,400
if this turns out to
be what I think it is,

702
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,633
because there won't be anybody left!

703
00:55:57,633 --> 00:55:58,870
- I don't see anything in there.

704
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:00,453
I think he's crazy.

705
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,463
- So Chief, you about ready?

706
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,213
- I guess as ready as I'll ever be.

707
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,550
- Well, I could go with you.

708
00:57:07,615 --> 00:57:09,437
You know, I'm not opposed to that.

709
00:57:09,437 --> 00:57:11,170
- Oh, I appreciate that, Sam.

710
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,780
But I really need somebody here

711
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,260
with a good head on their shoulders

712
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,550
to keep a watch out on the office

713
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:19,270
and make sure everything runs smoothly.

714
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,193
And in case I don't make it back.

715
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:23,920
- Thanks, but don't talk like that.

716
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,873
You're gonna be fine.

717
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:27,360
- This is not really on the up and up.

718
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,490
I mean I really should have given

719
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,650
all the information that I have

720
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,643
to the State Police, the FBI.

721
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:38,060
But also, on a good note,

722
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,570
this may put me on a map

723
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,240
for bigger and better things.

724
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,253
And most importantly,

725
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,080
to find out if Teddy killed Lorna.

726
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,865
- Oh I know, it's personal.

727
00:57:49,865 --> 00:57:51,253
And since you're gonna do it this way,

728
00:57:51,253 --> 00:57:52,626
I brought you this.

729
00:57:52,626 --> 00:57:54,380
- What's this?

730
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:58,340
- This is something we got
from a peaceful protest

731
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,280
a couple of weeks ago.

732
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,490
I think there's plenty of weapons in there

733
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,170
that you might find useful.

734
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,040
If you do have to use it

735
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,547
I know you'll put each thing to good use.

736
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:24,066
You'll feel much safer with that.

737
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:24,899
Cest la vie.

738
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,060
- Thank you, Sam.

739
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,083
I appreciate that.

740
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:35,514
- Yippee.

741
00:58:35,514 --> 00:58:36,622
Gonna beat it.

742
00:58:36,622 --> 00:58:39,184
Your prisoner's ready, Chief.

743
00:58:39,184 --> 00:58:40,517
Get on in there!

744
00:58:41,762 --> 00:58:44,563
- All right, he's all yours.

745
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:45,435
- All right.

746
00:58:45,435 --> 00:58:46,557
- All right, Chief,
I'll be on the dispatch

747
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:48,303
for the next 44 hours, so.

748
00:58:49,501 --> 00:58:50,501
- All right.

749
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:10,937
- Are you wired into the GPS
that Benchley's carrying?

750
00:59:10,937 --> 00:59:12,520
- Yes I am.

751
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,817
Got the little varmint.

752
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:14,880
- Got the varmint!

753
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,730
- Let's go.

754
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:16,563
- Let's go!

755
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,202
- To the helicopter.

756
00:59:36,202 --> 00:59:37,869
- To the helicopter.

757
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,993
- Good throw, you're learning.

758
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,250
- Ray Aubergash, you're
gonna get Billy sunburned

759
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,452
if you keep him out here much longer!

760
01:00:31,452 --> 01:00:32,285
- Oh no!

761
01:00:36,624 --> 01:00:39,085
- Oh, that was a good one.

762
01:00:39,085 --> 01:00:40,870
Lighten up, Barbara.

763
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:43,239
Trying to have a little
father son time here.

764
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,630
It's not like we can do this every day.

765
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:46,990
- I know, I know.

766
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:48,300
You just have to watch it.

767
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,140
I mean, there's no ozone left,

768
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,020
all the ultraviolet rays.

769
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,480
You have to watch it when they're young,

770
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,810
you know that already, okay?

771
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:57,203
- What is wrong with her?

772
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,135
- Did you put sunscreen on him?

773
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:01,323
- Oh, mom.

774
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:04,490
- All right, you got 10 more minutes

775
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:05,370
and then we gotta go

776
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,960
'cause Grandma's making
cowboy cornbread casserole.

777
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,450
- Not that garbage disposal junk again!

778
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,260
Last time we threw it
straight in the garbage,

779
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,043
what'd you think we're gonna
do with it this time, eat it?

780
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,341
Oh, I'm kind of scared

781
01:01:25,341 --> 01:01:26,767
of all the snakes back there.

782
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:29,263
- Oh, ain't no snakes in the corn.

783
01:01:29,263 --> 01:01:30,613
Here you go.

784
01:01:30,613 --> 01:01:31,446
Ah!

785
01:01:33,453 --> 01:01:34,670
Gosh.

786
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:35,503
That's it.

787
01:01:35,503 --> 01:01:36,352
Well, you'll be all right.

788
01:01:36,352 --> 01:01:38,546
You go and get it.

789
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:02,952
Sorry.

790
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:05,952
Sorry I threw it back in there so...

791
01:02:07,388 --> 01:02:12,388
Shark!

792
01:02:12,403 --> 01:02:13,236
- No!

793
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:39,820
- You better hope you're being
straight with me, Teddy bear.

794
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,360
'Cause if you're not,

795
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,770
you and me are gonna have some problems.

796
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,563
- Straight as a roundabout, ma'am.

797
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,050
- Now what does that mean?

798
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:54,050
- It means everything is
about to come full circle.

799
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:57,780
The fullest blood moon prophecy will rise

800
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,363
on the appropriate night.

801
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:02,170
Maybe this one.

802
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:03,770
And the cosmic revelations

803
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,170
and forces of Stonehenge

804
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:07,970
will be fully empowered.

805
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:10,603
That's why I had to
keep my shark tooth on.

806
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:14,170
I don't wanna miss being transformed.

807
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:16,810
- So wait, you're saying Stonehenge

808
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,890
gives off some sort of signal

809
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:21,973
to your shark goddess Chichimatul?

810
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:28,060
A real Great White Shark
you and your cult worship?

811
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,060
- Yes.

812
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,590
The signal will be received

813
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:33,310
by her electromagnetic sensitivity.

814
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,350
Not only used for prey

815
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:38,200
but for intuitive commands like this,

816
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,690
when the becoming is to begin.

817
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:43,710
We have members that have
been keeping track of her,

818
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:47,023
following her in the
Atlantic for decades now.

819
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,900
All for the becoming.

820
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,130
That's an
incredible belief, Teddy bear.

821
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,223
I mean, it is a little farfetched though.

822
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:59,460
- Mock it if you will, cop.

823
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,863
I already have electroreception.

824
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:08,170
I can smell your fear, like sweat

825
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:12,118
and,

826
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:15,868
something else.

827
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:01,850
- Won't be long now, boss.

828
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,400
We'll be coming up on him fast.

829
01:06:05,466 --> 01:06:08,414
- Technology makes me hard.

830
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:09,696
- Hard.

831
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,580
- Geez, not much left
of old Billy in there

832
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,803
but lots of blood on the corn stalks.

833
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,500
- Jesus Christ, what in
the name of Randy Travis

834
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,970
is going on around here, Kramer?

835
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:38,027
- Well, Mr. Mayor, they say-

836
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,530
- They, they,

837
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,930
spit it out already!

838
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,500
- They said it was a shark attack.

839
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,630
They said that Billy went
in to get his frisbee

840
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:47,043
and shoom, shark ate him right up.

841
01:06:48,273 --> 01:06:49,290
- A shark attack?

842
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:51,210
Who said that, some damn crackhead?

843
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:53,070
Somebody snorting airplane glue?

844
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:54,450
Mushroom eaters?

845
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:55,710
Shit!

846
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,400
- I've known the Aubergashes for years.

847
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,970
They're straight and narrow, churchgoers,

848
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:01,230
white bread eaters.

849
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:03,560
Honey the extra fiber with every meal.

850
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,330
We had a similar incident, Mr. Mayor,

851
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,720
about a week or so ago

852
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,110
in those yonder fields maybe a mile away.

853
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:10,940
Gary Gottlieb and Susan Blake,

854
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,900
same kind of thing happened to them.

855
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,170
- Which means Gary should
be freed, gentlemen.

856
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:16,750
You had him locked up when this happened.

857
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:17,990
So can we spring my brother now?

858
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,730
- Oh Jesus, I need this

859
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:22,460
like a damn Billy Goat pecker
going on top of my head.

860
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,150
What the hell are you
doing here, Gottlieb?

861
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,727
- Well Mr. Mayor, I'm the
news, the people around here,

862
01:07:26,727 --> 01:07:28,367
and so I'm here in my official capacity

863
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:29,230
with the Corn Gazette.

864
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,310
As well as having a personal
stake in this matter!

865
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:34,200
- So Mr. News Man, what's
your big take on all this?

866
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,600
Who's behind these gruesome murders?

867
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,777
Bigfoot, Loch Ness monster, the boogeyman?

868
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,544
- Well, all right,
generally the Bigfoot thing

869
01:07:41,544 --> 01:07:43,220
is just more of an advertising conjecture

870
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:45,140
to help me sell farms, you know.

871
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,370
- As in one big fat country fib.

872
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:49,004
- So in fancy schmancy talk,

873
01:07:49,004 --> 01:07:50,560
it's just a bunch of bulldog gravy

874
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,863
with no damn bacon on it.

875
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:55,460
- Well, look, did I say I saw Bigfoot, no.

876
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,560
But people around here
say they saw Bigfoot.

877
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,910
Are they making it up, I don't know.

878
01:07:58,910 --> 01:07:59,847
But I didn't make that up.

879
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:02,500
You know, I always worry I
would run into Bigfoot out here

880
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,440
and then I'd have a lot
of explaining to do.

881
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,030
Now, I've been looking into it

882
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:08,240
since I started seeing
sharks in the cornfield

883
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,403
with my drones I film my
real estate videos with.

884
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,890
Take a look at this, Mr. Mayor.

885
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,920
- I don't believe this shit.

886
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,569
- As you can see, there are
sharks in the cornfields.

887
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:25,380
Now, I've done some deep
dive research on this.

888
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,580
And these fields, all these fields

889
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,830
are on an ancient burial ground.

890
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:31,790
And there's this shark cult

891
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:35,000
that worships a humanoid shark goddess.

892
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,840
And they believe she's about to return.

893
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:40,200
And when she does, they'll
be transformed into hybrids,

894
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,360
changed into shark people.

895
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,880
- I feel like you'd have to
go with Bigfoot, Gottlieb!

896
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,710
This shit's ridiculous!

897
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,330
All I see is a bunch of clouds,

898
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:49,740
weird figures up in the clouds.

899
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,559
Hell, people see weird stuff
like that in the clouds

900
01:08:51,559 --> 01:08:52,540
all the time!

901
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:54,280
My grandma saw the devil jumping rope

902
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,430
one time in the clouds!

903
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,030
- You all have your heads in the clouds!

904
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:06,990
Even with the video evidence
right in front of you

905
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:08,690
you won't believe.

906
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:10,290
Listen.

907
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:13,493
I know it sounds completely insane.

908
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,080
But lives have been lost,

909
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,200
including a little boy's,
directly in front of you.

910
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,729
Now this situation is only
going to get worse and worse

911
01:09:22,729 --> 01:09:24,660
as the energy source in that cornfield

912
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,183
gets stronger and stronger.

913
01:09:27,389 --> 01:09:31,210
Soon, those corn sharks will
be able to get out of the field

914
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,780
and there's no telling
what they'll be able to do

915
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,000
when they get loose.

916
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,620
Now I think that there are
fields all over the place.

917
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,870
Maybe all over the world.

918
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:41,450
- Jonathan, why don't you
go back to your office

919
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:43,710
with that corn cob pipe,
put some hash in it

920
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:45,630
and toke on a little bit harder?

921
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:47,330
- Something crazy is going on here

922
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:48,670
and you better do something about it

923
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:49,760
before it swims up

924
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,479
and bites you in the cornhole!

925
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:54,309
Now can we please close
down these corn fields

926
01:09:54,309 --> 01:09:55,920
and try and get a handle on this?!

927
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,110
- Can't you see, you idiot?

928
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,420
It's harvest season, and a damn good one!

929
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,070
People out here, that's
how they make a living,

930
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,090
it's off selling the corn!

931
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,440
I'm not going to shut the cornfield down,

932
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,280
that's just ludicrous!

933
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,540
Now, if you think there's
some kind of Bigfoot

934
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:11,150
or monster out here injuring people,

935
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:12,147
like they did to those poor people,

936
01:10:12,147 --> 01:10:14,770
the little redneck boy,
and all these farmers,

937
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:16,230
you and your boys should go catch them,

938
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,570
take them down, get them outta here.

939
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:19,700
Jeez!

940
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:23,000
- Look, this is way bigger
than any of us can fathom,

941
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,833
do you hear?

942
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:25,293
Base to Rosenberg.

943
01:10:27,639 --> 01:10:28,643
- Go with base.

944
01:10:31,153 --> 01:10:33,120
Just
got a report from Eleanor

945
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,639
at the Williams farm.

946
01:10:34,639 --> 01:10:36,580
She said that the boys and some friends

947
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,877
that have stumbled into the cornfield

948
01:10:37,877 --> 01:10:39,940
and there were some tracks or something.

949
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:43,230
They're all shook up and
they ain't making much sense.

950
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:45,580
They say there's a lot
of blood and body parts

951
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:49,050
and well, they're afraid to
go into the field, because-

952
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,073
- Because why?

953
01:10:51,923 --> 01:10:52,857
Well this sounds crazy,

954
01:10:52,857 --> 01:10:56,230
but because of sharks in the cornfield.

955
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:58,020
They say they can see the fins

956
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,112
and they appear to be about
eight to 10 foot Great Whites.

957
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:05,110
- Never go swimming with bowlegged women.

958
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:06,780
You boys and girls get
your asses over there

959
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,237
and see what the hell's going on.

960
01:11:08,237 --> 01:11:10,070
And if it's what they say it is,

961
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,573
you nail them damn fish!

962
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:15,362
Or...

963
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:19,376
We close the damn corn fields.

964
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:20,627
- But Mr. Mayor!

965
01:11:20,627 --> 01:11:22,070
- You listen to me, you dumb dick,

966
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,730
for the first time in your life!

967
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:24,780
This is election year.

968
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,357
We got to at least make some
kind of a half ass effort

969
01:11:26,357 --> 01:11:28,070
to act like we care.

970
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:28,903
You got me?

971
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,362
Now, you go do what you need to do

972
01:11:32,362 --> 01:11:34,170
and get the hell outta here.

973
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:38,889
No, no, no, where you think
you're going, Lois Lane?

974
01:11:38,889 --> 01:11:42,012
Ace reporter, we're gonna
have a chat, you and I.

975
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:44,188
- It's not like going down to the pond

976
01:11:44,188 --> 01:11:46,540
chasing bass and crappies,
is it, Mr. Mayor.

977
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:47,820
- Well, that's why me and you,

978
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,630
we're gonna walk the perimeter.

979
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:51,410
I wanna ring the damn dinner bell myself,

980
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,050
see if anything popped
up to get a little snack.

981
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,490
- I think I have some things in my car

982
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,710
that might help us.

983
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:58,110
- Well, let's go do it, man.

984
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:15,920
- Hey.

985
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,853
You need a ride?

986
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:20,684
- No, no thanks.

987
01:12:20,684 --> 01:12:21,517
I'm good.

988
01:12:21,517 --> 01:12:22,350
- Are you sure?

989
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,150
I mean, it's starting to rain outside.

990
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:25,639
You look a little bit frazzled.

991
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:27,690
We're gonna head up to Druid Hills.

992
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:28,920
I don't mind giving you a ride,

993
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,460
or do you want me to call
somebody for you or something?

994
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,342
- All right.

995
01:12:32,342 --> 01:12:33,561
You talked me into it.

996
01:12:33,561 --> 01:12:34,511
I'll go up to your.

997
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:48,670
I know you're a cop and all

998
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:51,483
but didn't your mom teach
you not to pick up strangers?

999
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,070
- You know, to be a good cop,

1000
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:56,070
you've gotta have good instincts, right?

1001
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,510
- All right.
- Yeah.

1002
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,800
Yeah, no worries.

1003
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,030
This back here, in the back seat,

1004
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:11,850
this is Teddy Bo Lucas.

1005
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,880
Self-proclaimed serial
killer or something.

1006
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,540
So he says he's gonna
take me up to Druid Hills.

1007
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,360
There is supposedly a burial mound

1008
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,840
where he's killed all these people.

1009
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,673
- Really?

1010
01:13:22,673 --> 01:13:23,505
- Yeah.

1011
01:13:23,505 --> 01:13:24,650
- I'm intrigued.

1012
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,573
- You should be.

1013
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,477
So what's your name?

1014
01:13:28,477 --> 01:13:29,660
- Murray.

1015
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,050
Murray Benchley.

1016
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,780
- Well nice to meet you, Murray.

1017
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:34,559
I'm Chief Scheider.

1018
01:13:34,559 --> 01:13:37,123
Vera, from Chance, Kentucky.

1019
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,200
So where are you headed?

1020
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,950
Coincidentally, Druid Hills.

1021
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,870
- All roads lead to Druid Hills, people.

1022
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:49,380
- Hah, well that worked out
good for you, didn't it?

1023
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,903
Yes, yes it did.

1024
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,423
- What you got in that briefcase?

1025
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,223
- Paperwork, blueprints.

1026
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,587
- Uh huh.

1027
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,763
Mr. Benchley.

1028
01:14:19,559 --> 01:14:22,053
I can feel what you have in there.

1029
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,763
You believe in predestination?

1030
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,362
- Not really.

1031
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:41,093
- You should, my friend, you should.

1032
01:14:42,022 --> 01:14:44,700
Everything is falling into place.

1033
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,173
Everything.

1034
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,032
- You two know each other?

1035
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:53,543
- No.

1036
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:56,673
No.

1037
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:02,573
- We're closing in on Benchley.

1038
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,853
He's moving fast now.

1039
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:09,223
It's almost like he's in a car.

1040
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,850
- No worries.

1041
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:15,800
We're gonna sneak up on
him kinda unexpectedly

1042
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:18,883
and then we're gonna
bite him in the balls.

1043
01:15:18,883 --> 01:15:23,683
Balls!

1044
01:15:29,946 --> 01:15:31,990
- All right, Angelo won't be long now,

1045
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:34,440
you got your gun locked and loaded?

1046
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:42,282
- Sir, I left my piece back at base.

1047
01:15:46,139 --> 01:15:47,883
- What do I pay you for?

1048
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:50,120
Have a handicap, they say,

1049
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,943
he'll be fun to watch.

1050
01:15:52,809 --> 01:15:55,693
Oh man, do I gotta do everything myself?

1051
01:15:56,897 --> 01:15:59,246
You know, you can pick
some of that toe cheese out

1052
01:15:59,246 --> 01:16:02,620
and we have some nasty ammunition

1053
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:04,610
to throw at the bad guys.

1054
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:05,623
- Bad guys.

1055
01:16:11,362 --> 01:16:12,559
- Yeah there he is.

1056
01:16:12,559 --> 01:16:16,402
We're gonna nail that guy
and destroy that shark pup.

1057
01:16:16,402 --> 01:16:17,985
- Destroy that pup!

1058
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,860
I see somebody in there

1059
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:29,123
but I don't think they're coming.

1060
01:16:29,123 --> 01:16:31,563
- Yeah, they're moving around there.

1061
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:33,900
I think they're terrified.

1062
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,300
See, they just ran into the other room.

1063
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:38,790
Aw hell,
we're on our own, I guess.

1064
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:40,910
- Yeah, anyway let's go
check out that cornfield.

1065
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:41,743
- All right.

1066
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:53,150
- Looks harmless, why
don't you go in there

1067
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,550
and take a look around?

1068
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:56,200
- Ha, no sir, not without you.

1069
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,100
- Get on in there and let's see

1070
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,450
if we could find those bodies.

1071
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:59,437
The mayor wants to know about this

1072
01:16:59,437 --> 01:17:01,880
and we gotta get back to him right away.

1073
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,860
Yeah, we're gonna go in
there and take a look around.

1074
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:07,350
If we see anything, we'll
just shoot 'em with our gun.

1075
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:08,780
- I don't think that's gonna work.

1076
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:09,900
- Get in there a little bit closer.

1077
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,106
Go on, come on now, come on.

1078
01:17:11,106 --> 01:17:12,690
- You go.
- Come on, come on.

1079
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:13,523
Ladies first.
- No way.

1080
01:17:13,523 --> 01:17:15,650
- Get on in there deep, Rosenberg,

1081
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:16,820
let's take a look around.

1082
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,380
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

1083
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,130
- Well, if there's bodies in there,

1084
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:21,030
we gotta find them.

1085
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:22,430
We gotta clean this place up

1086
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:23,722
and see what's going on here.

1087
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:24,803
- Man, what the hell is the rush, man?

1088
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:27,940
- Well, you did this all in training.

1089
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,820
We took that course for 12 hours,

1090
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:31,468
I taught you all this stuff,
you should know better.

1091
01:17:31,468 --> 01:17:32,300
- Shh!

1092
01:17:34,035 --> 01:17:37,080
I thought I heard something.

1093
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:41,813
Oh shit, I thought I saw...

1094
01:17:41,813 --> 01:17:44,240
A fin, or a reflection or something!

1095
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,590
- Saw what?

1096
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:48,173
- Oh, shit, I don't think
we're in here alone.

1097
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:50,653
- Come on, now.

1098
01:17:58,594 --> 01:18:00,289
- Oh, my shit!

1099
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:01,121
Oh, shit!

1100
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:12,330
- Everything is coming
together exactly as planned.

1101
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:15,093
I can feel it in my bones.

1102
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:18,050
What about you, Chief?

1103
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:22,123
You feeling that
excitement buzz?

1104
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:29,653
Teddy, this
is just all so weird!

1105
01:18:32,072 --> 01:18:34,322
Base to Chief.

1106
01:18:35,356 --> 01:18:37,550
- Go ahead, Grossman.

1107
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:39,751
How are
you making out, Chief?

1108
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,100
- We're doing okay, we're almost there.

1109
01:18:45,415 --> 01:18:47,830
You be
careful out there, Chief.

1110
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:50,660
We're getting some odd
and disturbing reports

1111
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,843
from Druid Hills.

1112
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:57,593
- Wait, what kind of reports?

1113
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,900
- Well to be quite honest,

1114
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:05,452
we're getting some
attack reports on people.

1115
01:19:06,614 --> 01:19:08,797
People are being attacked in Druid Hills,

1116
01:19:08,797 --> 01:19:13,050
in cornfields, by sharks.

1117
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,513
Shark attacks?

1118
01:19:18,832 --> 01:19:19,793
Okay.

1119
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,914
Thanks for the heads up.

1120
01:19:22,914 --> 01:19:24,014
- Over and out, Chief.

1121
01:19:44,549 --> 01:19:46,914
Sharks in the popcorn!

1122
01:19:46,914 --> 01:19:47,831
Doggone it!

1123
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:52,633
Sharks everywhere.

1124
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,513
Wow.

1125
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:06,243
Chief?

1126
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:13,125
Ah, more coffee.

1127
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:26,730
- So what do you think?

1128
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,973
You still going to head
to Druid Hills with me?

1129
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,593
- Well, Chief, I got a confession.

1130
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:36,443
Actually,

1131
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:40,800
I'm with the CIA.

1132
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,330
I'm an agent.

1133
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:45,523
Been investigating this shark
cult for many months now.

1134
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:49,660
Initially it was just
investigative and speculative

1135
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:52,452
but now with Teddy and all these murders,

1136
01:20:54,407 --> 01:20:56,620
we're taking it more serious.

1137
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,910
First we thought the mafia was involved

1138
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:00,690
but it turns out that

1139
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:03,680
we think they just knew
something really bad was comin'.

1140
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:07,930
So as of now I'm not sure
what the hell is going on.

1141
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:11,710
But it's officially been upgraded from

1142
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,889
some crackpot niche group

1143
01:21:13,889 --> 01:21:16,170
to an actual terrorism threat

1144
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,780
against the United States.

1145
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,680
- You got that right, sucker.

1146
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,090
It's going down right now.

1147
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,487
You're going down too.

1148
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,993
- I knew there was something about you.

1149
01:21:27,993 --> 01:21:29,823
Just an intuition.

1150
01:21:31,681 --> 01:21:32,610
- Good call.

1151
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:33,443
Smart cookie.

1152
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,239
- So what do you think?

1153
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:39,043
Do you want to go in to
the eye of the storm?

1154
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:42,383
Fuckin' A.

1155
01:21:42,383 --> 01:21:43,216
- Well let's go.

1156
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,610
- Jesus Christ, Captain Quint,

1157
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:05,389
where the hell did you get that thing?

1158
01:22:05,389 --> 01:22:06,223
- Local pawn shop.

1159
01:22:06,223 --> 01:22:08,150
Just got lucky, I guess.

1160
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:08,983
You never know what you'll run into

1161
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:10,440
at the old hawk shops.

1162
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,500
- You better watch them pawn shops, boy.

1163
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,910
I know somebody who bought a
pair of panties there one time,

1164
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:17,386
ended up with gonorrhea
and the damn herpes.

1165
01:22:17,386 --> 01:22:18,389
- What?

1166
01:22:18,389 --> 01:22:19,386
- Yeah.

1167
01:22:19,386 --> 01:22:20,930
Don't know about them
rubbers there either.

1168
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:23,160
I just read about the Chinese.

1169
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,710
They're taking used rubbers,

1170
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:26,559
cleaning them out and reselling them.

1171
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,450
- Damn, that's some nasty shit.

1172
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:30,397
- Yeah.

1173
01:22:30,397 --> 01:22:33,050
- I was hoping my order
would get here anytime

1174
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:34,867
before we actually went into these stalks.

1175
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:36,230
- Order, what the hell
are you talking about?

1176
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:37,782
What'd you order, a pizza?

1177
01:22:37,782 --> 01:22:38,616
- Well.

1178
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,670
Hey Jonathan.

1179
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:46,503
- Hey.
- Here's that package

1180
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:47,581
that you ordered and

1181
01:22:47,581 --> 01:22:49,650
you're a little bit out
on the farm than usual.

1182
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:51,870
- Ah yeah, out fishing actually.

1183
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,377
Thank you, you guys rule.

1184
01:22:53,377 --> 01:22:55,112
Well,
glad to be of service.

1185
01:22:59,544 --> 01:23:00,707
- What the hell was that?

1186
01:23:00,707 --> 01:23:02,900
- Ah, that's Amazing.com.

1187
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,160
They deliver, I belong
to the Pronto program

1188
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,300
so I get packages in four hours,

1189
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,650
and free streaming
movies right to my phone.

1190
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:11,404
- What are you, the damn
spokesperson for them or something?

1191
01:23:15,058 --> 01:23:15,891
What the hell?

1192
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:17,913
That old boy must have
hemorrhoids or something.

1193
01:23:18,873 --> 01:23:20,807
- This guy has his last delivery today.

1194
01:23:20,807 --> 01:23:23,170
And what is
all these, flea collars?

1195
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,460
- They're shark-repellant bracelets,

1196
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:25,860
like Off, but for sharks.

1197
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:27,340
They're designed to work underwater

1198
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:29,139
where the sound travels
faster and further,

1199
01:23:29,139 --> 01:23:31,770
but they should have some nominal effect

1200
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:33,210
in the open air.

1201
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:35,362
In close proximity at least, I hope.

1202
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,110
- I'll be dipped in shit.

1203
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:39,980
You can get anything from Amazing.com.

1204
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:42,809
Still, I ain't gonna wear one
of those things, you putz.

1205
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:44,360
It don't matter, there
ain't no sharks out here.

1206
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:47,270
Probably a wildcat, maybe a bear.

1207
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:48,960
Hell, maybe your old friend Bigfoot

1208
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,090
really is the one out here doing all this.

1209
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:52,880
- Well, this might repel
those predators too,

1210
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:53,713
I don't know.

1211
01:23:53,713 --> 01:23:56,723
- Well as long as you keep me
safe, Mr. Shark Hunter Boy.

1212
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:01,050
- Ah, you know, if you come here

1213
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:03,590
it's gonna be at your own risk.

1214
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:04,920
- You sure you don't want some flippers

1215
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,469
and a snorkel too, you dumbass?

1216
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:09,340
- Well, at least you
won't need a bigger mouth

1217
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,889
if you start screaming in there.

1218
01:24:10,889 --> 01:24:12,309
You got that much going for ya.

1219
01:24:12,309 --> 01:24:13,143
- Let's go.

1220
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:35,875
- Is he comin'?

1221
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:39,897
- Yeah.

1222
01:24:39,897 --> 01:24:40,900
Come on, Ted.

1223
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,032
- Come on now.

1224
01:24:42,032 --> 01:24:43,532
You fucking freak.

1225
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:47,170
So is this where you buried my sister?

1226
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:49,469
This is the burial mound
you're talking about?

1227
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:54,610
- Yes, ma'am, I believe it is.

1228
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:56,423
It's all coming back now.

1229
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,340
All the victims' blood will align

1230
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:02,920
with the power of Stonehenge

1231
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,040
and the crimson moon!

1232
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,012
Chichimatul will become one

1233
01:25:08,012 --> 01:25:09,723
with the shark goddess.

1234
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:12,630
All those martyrs in the field

1235
01:25:14,059 --> 01:25:17,280
will be reborn in the great becoming,

1236
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,793
in her honor!

1237
01:25:20,389 --> 01:25:23,963
- So this is where everything
lines up with Stonehenge?

1238
01:25:25,139 --> 01:25:27,050
All right, we need to go in

1239
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:30,153
and destroy the sharks and the source.

1240
01:25:31,637 --> 01:25:33,193
Do you have any more weapons?

1241
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:35,963
- Actually, I do.

1242
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:38,719
I've got a backpack back here

1243
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,570
that Grossman gave me.

1244
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:41,782
Hold on to this

1245
01:25:41,782 --> 01:25:43,219
fucking freak.
- Got him.

1246
01:25:43,219 --> 01:25:45,420
- And I think it has a
bunch of weapons in it.

1247
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:46,423
Even a grenade.

1248
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:51,260
- A grenade?

1249
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:54,530
Ah probably from some peaceful protesters.

1250
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:57,100
Okay, I'm gonna need to borrow your phone.

1251
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,920
Time to call in the big guns.

1252
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,039
Things are about to get real.

1253
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:11,260
- Now, now, Chief.

1254
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:15,450
Knocking out a CIA
agent, a fellow comrade?

1255
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:19,943
I think you just overstepped
your jurisdiction.

1256
01:26:36,262 --> 01:26:37,179
- You know?

1257
01:26:38,342 --> 01:26:42,540
All my life, I've been nothing to anybody.

1258
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:46,793
I've always been nothing
but a fucking failure!

1259
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,190
I've never been good for anybody.

1260
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:54,123
I've always been spit on
by family and friends.

1261
01:26:55,795 --> 01:26:57,883
And I'm sick and tired of it.

1262
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:03,940
I'm so tired of just doing
things for everybody else

1263
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:06,193
and nobody giving a fuck about me!

1264
01:27:10,423 --> 01:27:12,505
So no, I'm gonna do this,

1265
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,733
and I'm gonna do this for Lorna.

1266
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:18,740
She needs to be reborn

1267
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,003
and I'm not a failure anymore.

1268
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:25,490
So I wanna make sure that I merge

1269
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,293
with the Great White Shark Cult.

1270
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,040
I now know

1271
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,103
that wrong is right.

1272
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:38,202
And I wanna be with the
becoming of Chichimatul.

1273
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:42,647
I didn't believe you at first, Teddy.

1274
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,833
I really was on the fence about it.

1275
01:27:48,023 --> 01:27:49,263
But now I know.

1276
01:27:51,362 --> 01:27:53,462
You were telling the truth the whole time.

1277
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:56,850
And I'll do anything possible to make sure

1278
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:59,112
that Lorna is reborn again.

1279
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:05,809
- I knew it.

1280
01:28:05,809 --> 01:28:07,540
This is perfect!

1281
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:11,653
You were the one all along, Chief.

1282
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,910
I am honored and humbled.

1283
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:16,323
As it has been written.

1284
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:19,875
- Let me get you out of these.

1285
01:28:23,752 --> 01:28:27,170
- We need my shark jaws and
what's in Benchley's briefcase

1286
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,719
to complete the perfect circle.

1287
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:41,231
This is the 13th pup.

1288
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:44,853
The 13th pup from Chichimatul!

1289
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:48,123
- You mean the Great White Shark's babies?

1290
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:50,993
- Exactly.

1291
01:28:52,469 --> 01:28:54,770
The people watching over
her had been collecting

1292
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:56,763
her stillborns for decades.

1293
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:01,210
I buried them here in the field

1294
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:03,170
with the other martyrs.

1295
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:04,263
Like your sister.

1296
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:09,770
This is the last one
we need to lay to rest

1297
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:10,713
for the becoming.

1298
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,983
It's finally time!

1299
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:18,237
- Well let's do this, my friend.

1300
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:23,760
- So far so good.

1301
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,150
You doing okay, Mr. Mayor?

1302
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:27,553
- Oh, I'm just sitting in
butter back here myself.

1303
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,413
Hey wait, do you hear that?

1304
01:29:31,413 --> 01:29:32,246
I thought I heard a car.

1305
01:29:32,246 --> 01:29:34,559
You think it may be Rosenberg and Kramer?

1306
01:29:34,559 --> 01:29:37,688
- Maybe, but, they haven't
contacted us yet though.

1307
01:29:37,688 --> 01:29:40,432
I don't know.

1308
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,850
- Damn, what, what?

1309
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:47,293
You hear something, see something?

1310
01:29:47,293 --> 01:29:49,769
- If I saw something, it was gray,

1311
01:29:49,769 --> 01:29:52,309
something gray, it was like a flash.

1312
01:29:52,309 --> 01:29:53,790
- Well maybe your old buddy Bigfoot,

1313
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,690
he's wearing a gray sports jacket.

1314
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:58,708
He's going to the Daytime
Emmy Awards or something.

1315
01:29:58,708 --> 01:30:00,547
- At least they haven't attacked us yet.

1316
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:56,693
- Lorna?

1317
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:01,023
- I'm sorry.

1318
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:03,969
But you are blessed.

1319
01:31:03,969 --> 01:31:06,183
She's a martyr for Chichimatul now.

1320
01:31:07,068 --> 01:31:10,623
- So she'll live again when
I become the shark goddess?

1321
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:13,969
- Yes.

1322
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:17,389
But like you said, you have
to want to do it for you.

1323
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:18,307
- Oh, I do.

1324
01:31:19,148 --> 01:31:21,620
I just want her to have a chance

1325
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,813
to come back in the most purest of forms.

1326
01:31:25,637 --> 01:31:30,087
Yes.

1327
01:31:45,973 --> 01:31:50,255
Yes.

1328
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:56,603
Feel the power.

1329
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,600
Feel the power of the blood
sacrifices I've made for you

1330
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,743
with those shark jaws.

1331
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:07,771
Begin you calling.

1332
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:12,183
It's almost time.

1333
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:15,490
Dress as the shark scarecrow,

1334
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:17,880
and when the blood moon rises tonight,

1335
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,830
the Stonehenge energy will
give us the cosmic revelations

1336
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:21,707
we yearn for.

1337
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,710
The becoming will begin.

1338
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:45,411
- Benchley is right there!

1339
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:48,077
Somewhere down in the cornfield!

1340
01:34:19,969 --> 01:34:21,219
Shark!

1341
01:34:31,558 --> 01:34:32,391
- Shark?

1342
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:51,993
- Did you see that?

1343
01:34:51,993 --> 01:34:53,360
That helicopter!

1344
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,918
The shark kicked it right out of the sky!

1345
01:34:55,918 --> 01:34:57,583
Gave me a chance to get out of there.

1346
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,300
- Who are you?

1347
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:03,040
- Oh, I'm one of the good guys, I think.

1348
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,309
Jonathan Gottlieb.

1349
01:35:04,309 --> 01:35:07,190
I'm publisher of the
Druid Hills Corn Gazette.

1350
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:08,070
Me and Mayor Zanuck,

1351
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:10,469
we went in there to investigate
the corn sharks and,

1352
01:35:10,469 --> 01:35:11,303
they got him.

1353
01:35:11,303 --> 01:35:12,960
- Corn sharks?

1354
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,750
Okay look, I'm Murray Benchley,

1355
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:16,743
I'm with the CIA.

1356
01:35:17,598 --> 01:35:21,639
I was investigating this
with Chief Vera Scheider,

1357
01:35:21,639 --> 01:35:23,630
but she hit me on the back of the head

1358
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:25,320
and ran in there with one
of the cult murderers.

1359
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,153
- Traitor!

1360
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:29,420
Well she's part of the problem now.

1361
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:31,110
- So you're up to speed on everything?

1362
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:32,550
- Yes sir, I think so.

1363
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:35,160
If these lunatic shark
cultists have their way

1364
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,490
it'll be the end of the
world as we know it.

1365
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:38,780
- No doubt.

1366
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:40,833
- So what do we do now?

1367
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,980
- All right, look.

1368
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:45,889
It's gonna be dark soon.

1369
01:35:45,889 --> 01:35:47,543
So I say we wait until cover of darkness.

1370
01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:50,057
Then go in when they least expect it

1371
01:35:50,057 --> 01:35:51,500
and take 'em out.

1372
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,660
- All right, I'm with you.

1373
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:55,830
I've got shark repellant
bracelets from Amazing.com,

1374
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:57,873
harpoon gun from the pawnshop.

1375
01:35:57,873 --> 01:36:00,110
- Well I got a bag full of girly toys

1376
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:03,026
that should make a lot of noise.

1377
01:36:03,026 --> 01:36:03,904
- All right.

1378
01:36:03,904 --> 01:36:05,731
Well let's not let this pie go stale.

1379
01:36:05,731 --> 01:36:06,648
- No doubt.

1380
01:37:21,951 --> 01:37:25,889
♪ Show me the way to go home ♪

1381
01:37:25,889 --> 01:37:26,723
Ahh.

1382
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:30,809
Yeah we probably should see

1383
01:37:30,809 --> 01:37:32,452
what is going on here.

1384
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,570
- Tonight we come full circle.

1385
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:41,469
Everything is aligned for
Chichimatul and the becoming.

1386
01:37:41,469 --> 01:37:45,090
The 666 martyrs have been served

1387
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:47,263
and lie in this cornfield!

1388
01:37:57,136 --> 01:38:01,580
The blood of the shark
teeth has been ingested!

1389
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:04,980
And we now live in the
prophetic revelations

1390
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:06,973
as the blood moon rises.

1391
01:38:09,639 --> 01:38:10,883
As it is written,

1392
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,790
we have a mortal volunteer

1393
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:17,193
to become one with Chichimatul.

1394
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:21,900
By the power of Stonehenge!

1395
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:24,710
I pro offer, the final pup

1396
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:28,000
and Vera Scheider's willing soul,

1397
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,263
in your honor and glory,
almighty Chichimatul!

1398
01:38:38,165 --> 01:38:39,830
- Hmm.

1399
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:41,600
Sure is getting crowded in here.

1400
01:38:43,146 --> 01:38:44,591
- Yeah.

1401
01:38:44,591 --> 01:38:47,537
What happened to the Conan
virus and social distancing?

1402
01:38:47,537 --> 01:38:49,983
I'm gonna tell Governor
Andy about this one.

1403
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:55,090
- Do we need a reason?

1404
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:58,350
Just look around at the state of humanity!

1405
01:38:58,350 --> 01:39:03,350
Inferior, weak, sickly, frail,

1406
01:39:03,790 --> 01:39:07,043
divided, hateful, afraid!

1407
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:11,550
Truly the monsters, the
viruses of this age.

1408
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:14,160
Becoming one with Chichimatul

1409
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:16,840
will absolve us of these shortcomings.

1410
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:21,202
We will all be part of the
same mindset in the becoming.

1411
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:25,770
Rulers of this planet,

1412
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:29,490
and eventually the universe.

1413
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:31,563
I pro offer the 13th pup!

1414
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:58,660
The barriers are now unbound!

1415
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:02,452
What was once impossible is now possible!

1416
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:06,980
The festival of the Sanguinary is upon us!

1417
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:10,059
The last serious attempt
having taken place

1418
01:40:10,059 --> 01:40:12,610
1300 years ago,

1419
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:15,210
when the earth ran red

1420
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:20,040
with blood sacrifices, famine, and war!

1421
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,053
All hail to our craft!

1422
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:25,223
- Witchcraft!

1423
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,250
Stonehenge and the moon

1424
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,930
are in alignment.

1425
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:34,093
It is time to change the
world with the becoming.

1426
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:00,690
All hail Chihimatul.

1427
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:02,920
We are one with her now

1428
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:04,973
and I am her protector!

1429
01:41:05,969 --> 01:41:08,782
I call upon the ancient powers of Strigoy.

1430
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,900
- So this is what happens?

1431
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:53,500
- Okay, I guess we better do something

1432
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,550
besides watch this like it's a bad movie.

1433
01:42:22,322 --> 01:42:24,013
Smile, you son of a bitch.

1434
01:42:37,362 --> 01:42:39,362
- Have a grenade, bitch.

1435
01:43:21,505 --> 01:43:23,963
I guess we did it.

1436
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:30,820
Now this is a story for your paper.

1437
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:31,963
- Yeah, but.

1438
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:35,639
That was really Bigfoot.

1439
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:36,680
- Yeah.

1440
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,384
With a big fucking rock.

1441
01:43:38,384 --> 01:43:41,293
I was afraid
he would be real, but,

1442
01:43:42,230 --> 01:43:43,163
- No doubt now.

1443
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:45,920
Let's get out of here so
you can write that up.

1444
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,120
You got it.

1445
01:44:12,139 --> 01:44:12,973
You ready?

1446
01:44:12,973 --> 01:44:15,150
Let's do it, brother.
