1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,771
My young friends, you're among the best

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:06,939
and brightest in the land,

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,209
but are you willing to obey and go?

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,346
Are you willing to head the call?

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,581
It matters not the field of service.

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,483
What matters is your willingness to obey

7
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,852
the Lord's command as found in Isaiah

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,161
chapter six.

9
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,290
Are you willing to take your talents and

10
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,526
place them on the alter and say,

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:30,339
"Here am I, Lord. Send me."

12
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,833
It was a terribly painful moment,

13
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,403
more painful than I care to remember.

14
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,105
I felt I had nothing to offer God but

15
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,807
a string of failures.

16
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,381
What could He possibly want from me?

17
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,713
The answer to that question will probably

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,550
surprise you because there's a strength

19
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,718
that can come from weakness.

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,955
There's a strength that lies hidden in failure.

21
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:59,563
You might not think so, but there is.

22
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,364
I'm living proof.

23
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,085
Uh, where's ma?

24
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,087
She's up at the hill with your dad.

25
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,123
They're about ready to move the house.

26
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,524
They are?

27
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,359
Don't go gettin' any fancy ideas.

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,894
Your mom said you need to stay here

29
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:42,995
and do your chores.

30
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,872
Chores is done!

31
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,141
Josh, come back here!

32
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,200
I had known for a while

33
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,902
they were going to move the house

34
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,271
but I didn't know exactly when,

35
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,473
and I was so excited.

36
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,641
How were they going to do it?

37
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,777
I was just a kid, what did I know?

38
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,278
Was a helicopter going to come

39
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,147
down from the sky, or airplanes

40
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,815
fly over to lift the house up

41
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:03,716
and take it away?

42
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,217
This house belongs to me

43
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,619
and it's stayin' here!

44
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,922
Now I want you boys off'a my property!

45
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,833
Keep working.

46
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,292
Ain't you gonna do something?!

47
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,494
I want these men off'a my property!

48
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,629
- I'm sorry, Wllmot.

49
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,097
According to this court order

50
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,665
that house now belongs to Junior

51
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,233
and he can move it if he has a mind to.

52
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,735
I built that house!

53
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,170
- And promised it to your son.

54
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,638
The hell I did!

55
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,574
- You were too drunk to remember!

56
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,042
I have witnesses.

57
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,977
Come on, we're taking those bushes.

58
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,046
You ain't taking no bushes, Junior!

59
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,617
Get! Get on out of here!

60
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,921
I had no idea of the conflict

61
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,856
unfolding that morning.

62
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,324
I just figured the crowd I saw

63
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,592
at the top of the hill meant we were

64
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,834
going to have some kind of celebration.

65
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,097
But instead of a party,

66
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,898
I came face-to-face with the misery

67
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,900
and dysfunction of my family

68
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,836
played out in front of all of our neighbors

69
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,004
and so-called friends.

70
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,372
They had turned out to support

71
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,683
my brother, Junior, against our parents.

72
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,877
It was completely shameful

73
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,979
and embarrassing and something

74
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,018
inside me just broke me that day.

75
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,785
I blanked out at that moment.

76
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,121
My mind went numb.

77
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,323
I think emotionally I snapped

78
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,558
because I can't remember what happened

79
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,794
over the next several minutes

80
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,797
But my last conscious thought...

81
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,166
I remember running down the hill

82
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,567
in front of everyone

83
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,048
just crying and screaming.

84
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,178
They're all lies!

85
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,753
If you cared, you wouldn't do this to me!

86
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:14,780
Have you ever felt abandoned?

87
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,650
I hate you, God! I hate you!

88
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,118
Have you ever felt nobody cares

89
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,156
whether you live or die?

90
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,296
And I hate you dad!

91
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,393
That's how I felt at eleven years old

92
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,462
when I was hiding in the silo.

93
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,465
I felt I had no one to turn to.

94
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,036
I hate you! I hate you!

95
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,405
And I became angry.

96
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,908
I became angry at God if God even existed.

97
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,677
And I damned him.

98
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,988
I called him every name in the book.

99
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,684
And I cursed and damned my father, too,

100
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,223
because I felt that he had abandoned me.

101
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,232
My father was an alcoholic.

102
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,134
He was the town drunk.

103
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,803
My mother was so overweight

104
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:15,040
she was practically an invalid.

105
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,251
One of my sisters committed suicide.

106
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,980
My other sister joined the Army

107
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,087
just to get away from home.

108
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,819
My oldest brother, Wilmot,

109
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,824
He actually sued my parents

110
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,801
in a court of law.

111
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,668
It wasn't a very happy home,

112
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,363
and I can remember so often just

113
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,465
feeling alone.

114
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,969
Like I was just completely alone.

115
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,709


116
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,778
I was in that cell for about 3 hours,

117
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,313
maybe more.

118
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,116
And no one even came to look for me.

119
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,252
Finally, I was just so hungry and thirsty,

120
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,427
I climbed out and went home.

121
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,065
I slammed the door shut on God that day.

122
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,631
In fact, probably one of the greatest hurts

123
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,900
was - is that I never ever wanted to go

124
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,769
to a friend's house again.

125
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,871
I felt such shame.

126
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,607
I think I just gave up on the notion that

127
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,878
love is patient, or kind, or even

128
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,414
rejoices in the truth.

129
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,549
And to be honest with you,

130
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,251
I never thought that door would ever

131
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,289
open again.

132
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,910
Josh, what are you doing out here?

133
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,346
You need to start your chores, boy.

134
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,156
Hurry up, now.

135
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,869
All right cows, let's go!

136
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,875
Come on, go! Come on, come on!

137
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,659
Oh, what, what is that man doing

138
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,427
with them cows now?

139
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,170
It's worse than dealing with a small child.

140
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,767
Him and his liquor!

141
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,495
What the hell?

142
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,531
I got chores of my own!

143
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,766
I've got to come out and do

144
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,610
your chores, too, I can see!

145
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,646
What is going on here?

146
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,739
Oh, Lord not again.

147
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,341
Wilmot McDowell!

148
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,542
Are you milking these cows

149
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,978
or just trying to kill them?

150
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,946
I got my own chores to do!

151
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,188
Do I have to do everything around here?

152
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,655
All you do around here is

153
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,586
getting fatter by the day.

154
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,855
- Useless old drunk!

155
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,391
This cow's milked out right here, this one!

156
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,926
You can't even take care of a cow

157
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:01,905
for heaven's sake!

158
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:08,863
(Edith screaming)

159
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,656
Got your chores done, Edith? Huh?!

160
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,292
I'll kill you!

161
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,593
- No, Josh!
I'll kill you!

162
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:38,630
Do you hear, me?!

163
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,611
I swear you'll pay!

164
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,848
You'll see!

165
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,307
Josh!

166
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,309
Oh, Josh.

167
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,009
Mom.

168
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,456
You can't do it. You can't do it.

169
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,782
Just go get Wayne.

170
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:57,659
Mom.

171
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,356
Mom.

172
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,520
He's, he's gonna change, son.

173
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,755
I know he's gonna change.

174
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,260
Just, just go get Wayne. Just get him.

175
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,343
Crying's not going to do anyone any good,

176
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,482
Josh.

177
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,546
Wayne Bailey was used to my dad hurting

178
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,423
my mom.

179
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,358
It's your mother again, ain't it?

180
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,421
He was used to me asking for his help.

181
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,258
He worked in the house because

182
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,159
mom was just too slow and too heavy

183
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,436
for most of the household chores.

184
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,839
I suppose he handled that side

185
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,285
of things well enough.

186
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,056
It was the other things that he did.

187
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,619
As far as handling my dad was concerned,

188
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,754
I didn't need help from Wayne

189
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,291
or anyone else.

190
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,195
When you grow up on a farm,

191
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,431
You learn to do a lot of things as a kid.

192
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,537
You also get pretty strong.

193
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:56,935
If I knew friends were planning to come

194
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,870
by the house, I took matters

195
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,439
into my own hands.

196
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,240
Partly to avoid embarrassment

197
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,409
from my dad, who was always drunk,

198
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,877
and partly to pay him back

199
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,721
for what he did to my mom.

200
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:10,449
Josh, what are you doing?

201
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,588
- Just stay there!
Josh, what are you doing?

202
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,534
What are you doing -Ahhh!

203
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,365
Josh I didn't mean to.

204
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,704
<i>Josh...</i>

205
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,939
Josh, I'm your father, Josh.

206
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,112
Jo.

207
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,654
Some father you are.

208
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,748
Now, don't you make a sound.

209
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,025
You hear me?!

210
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:50,457


211
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,400
Hello Mr. O'Brien. Hello Mrs. O'Brien.

212
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,102
Howdy, Josh. Where's your dad?

213
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,405
He, uh, he had to go into town,

214
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,807
but my mom's inside. She's expecting you.

215
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,509
Thank you, Josh.

216
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,477
Come on in, folks!

217
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,178
Come on in.

218
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,679
Just in here taking the chicken out

219
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,127
of the oven. Have a seat over there.

220
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,820
I would leave my dad in the barn all night.

221
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,623
I don't know how many times I would do that.

222
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,957
But I would do just about anything

223
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,093
to humiliate him.

224
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,629
I can remember watching him go out

225
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,864
to hide his wine bottles and then

226
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,733
I'd go out and urinate in them.

227
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:38,270
One time the police pulled me off my dad

228
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,571
when I was trying to choke him underneath

229
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,572
the water in the bathtub.

230
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,109
I hated him so much.

231
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,042
I used to go to the bathroom and then

232
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,784
stick his head in the t-

233
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,653
...stick his head in the toilet and flush it.

234
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,621
And as a kid, all I ever wanted

235
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,125
was to stop my dad from hurting my mother,

236
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,003
and I couldn't do it.

237
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,312
He never retaliated directly.

238
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,516
He could have. I mean I was still a kid.

239
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,084
I think when he sobered up,

240
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,620
even thought he didn't stay sober long,

241
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,288
he must have realized what he was doing

242
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,090
to my mom and the family.

243
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,426
I think he was ashamed.

244
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:39,399
I don't know for sure, but life went on.

245
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,786
You got them rolls in there?

246
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,247
Ah, here we go.

247
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,883
All right, fellas, we got some nice hot rolls

248
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:08,653
for you. Here we go.

249
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:09,955
And if you want to start that butter

250
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,663
down this side.

251
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,359
And Josh, your father and I have to talk

252
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,704
to you after supper.

253
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,321
How are you, my darlings?

254
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,823
Yes?

255
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,725
Yes? Oh my.

256
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:51,698
Yes. Beautiful. I have something for you.

257
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:58,205
I want you to obey Wayne. No excuses.

258
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,905
How long will you be gone?

259
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,042
Well, I don't know, a week maybe.

260
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,750
Ten days at the most.

261
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,380
That's a long time.

262
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,748
What ails you, son?

263
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:10,982
Your dad and I have made trips

264
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,550
like this before.

265
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,286
Wayne knows how to take good care of you.

266
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,096
You just do what he says.

267
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,989
Why don't I come with you?

268
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,224
I came with you once before.

269
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,625
- Joslin David McDowell,
I came with you once before.

270
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,693
You cannot go with us.

271
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,262
You're starting school next week!

272
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,799
And I want you to listen to me.

273
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,234
When I get home, I am going to ask Wayne

274
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,403
how you behaved and if I hear you didn't

275
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,505
listen to him, I'm going to give you

276
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,307
a good thrashing. Do you understand me?

277
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,480
- Yes, ma'am.
a good thrashing. Do you understand me?

278
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,716
Oh, all right. Well,

279
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,458
now you go onto bed.

280
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,291
I need to see if Wayne washed those dishes.

281
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,669
How long will you be gone?

282
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,738
A week maybe,

283
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,640
ten days at the most.

284
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,678
That's a long time.

285
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,191
(Radio) Presenting Superman!

286
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,587
Up in the sky! Look!

287
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,221
It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!

288
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,489
It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!
Josh.

289
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,662
It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!

290
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:34,199
Relax. Relax, Josh.

291
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,237
Just relax.

292
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,405
It's all right.

293
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,930
Josh. Stay with me.

294
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,978
Yeah, it's all right.

295
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,037
You know how you like this.

296
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:46,004
Twice I tried to tell my mother,

297
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,643
but she wouldn't believe me.

298
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,874
You know, back then people didn't

299
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,242
talk about these things, or

300
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,979
at least they weren't supposed to exist.

301
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,248
But Wayne Bailey severely abused me

302
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:01,857
sexually from about 6 to 13 years of age.

303
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,526
If you ever touch me again, I'll kill you,

304
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,473
you understand me?!

305
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,838
He must have stayed another

306
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,252
two or three years. Then he left.

307
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,543
He knew I had a temper,

308
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,148
and I would've killed him.

309
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,452
As I grew older, sports became

310
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,421
a vital outlet for me,

311
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:37,822
especially football

312
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,166
and basketball.

313
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,427
Every once in a while, my

314
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,696
mother came to one of my games,

315
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,332
but she never saw me play.

316
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,101
All she ever did was sit in the car and cry

317
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,669
because she was too heavy to sit

318
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,172
in the bleachers.

319
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:16,035
(Edith crying)

320
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,531
Where is he? Where is he?!

321
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,132
No, Josh, don't, don't.

322
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,545
Just - just let it go.

323
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,274
There's only one thing I want before I die.

324
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,476
Die? What are you talking about, mom?

325
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,277
I just -

326
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,745
I just want to see you graduate

327
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,380
from high school.

328
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,447
Mom, I'll be out in two months.

329
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,348
You know that.

330
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,794
Well I, I know son.

331
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:46,364
Jo- Josh, you have to promise me three things.

332
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,695
You got to promise me that you will never

333
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,937
ever be an alcoholic,

334
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,310
and you won't swear.

335
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,572
You promise me that you'll be

336
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:03,611
the kind of son that I can be proud of.

337
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:04,676
Sure, mom.

338
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,384
No promise me, promise me.

339
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,181
I promise.

340
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,715


341
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,423
Just rest now, okay?

342
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,698
When I graduated from high school,

343
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,166
I joined the Air National Guard

344
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,001
with some of my friends.

345
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:33,304
That was the summer of 1957.

346
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,306
And then, because I couldn't get into basic

347
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,042
training at the same time as my buddies,

348
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,178
I joined the regular Air Force.

349
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,813
That allowed me to be with my friends

350
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,449
for two weeks of active duty training

351
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,624
at Lackland Air Force Base.

352
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,388
When two weeks were over, my friends

353
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:53,191
went back to Michigan, but Airman Josh

354
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:56,494
McDowell still had 10 more weeks of basic

355
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,297
training and three years and nine months

356
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:03,067
of regular duty; and all that just to be

357
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,912
with my friends 2 more weeks.

358
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,219
After basic training,

359
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,388
I was assigned to Dover Air Force Base

360
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,889
in Delaware.

361
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,425
Now, on paper I was a mechanic working on

362
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:30,795
C-124 aircraft, the big cargo planes,

363
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,530
but it seemed like my real job was to play

364
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,264
but it seemed like my real job was to play

365
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,133
starting guard for the base basketball team.

366
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:36,167
- So yesterday, remember in practice,
starting guard for the base basketball team.

367
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,202
We put that play in. That one play

368
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,138
is going to get Josh open for that shot

369
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,040
when we need that shot.

370
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,441
That's what we're going to run right now.

371
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:44,676
We're going to run this pick so that

372
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:45,309
Josh can get open.

373
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,211
- My first Seargent was really proud of me
Josh can get open.

374
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,080
For being a starter on the team.

375
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,648
All right, and you guys popping it out.

376
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:55,620
Make it pop hard. Get there, open quick...

377
00:25:55,621 --> 00:26:00,593
in a lot of ways. But I still had to work.

378
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:07,109
Sometimes things just happen.

379
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,951
Paging Dr. Stateman, Dr. Stateman, please.

380
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,381
Thank you.

381
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,417
You're welcome.

382
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,586
Michael Crawford, 3-4-0, Michael Crawford,

383
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,498
please call 3-4-0.

384
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,030
Airman McDowell?

385
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,305
Yes, sir.

386
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,481
I'm Chaplin Gardiner.

387
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:50,942
Yes, sir? W- what is it?

388
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,043
It's about your mother.

389
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,478
My mother?

390
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,015
What about my mother?

391
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,997
Your mother's dead, son.

392
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,024
I just want to see you graduate

393
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,698
from high school...

394
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:52,244
and then, I want to die.

395
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,142


396
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,413
I can't go on, son.

397
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,254
Your father's broken my heart.

398
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,270
Where you going?

399
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:21,599
Union City.

400
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,374
Come on, get it in.

401
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,018
They say you can't die of a broken heart,

402
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,599
My father's abuse broke my mother's heart,

403
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,733
and she lost the will to live.

404
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,768
I, on the other hand, well,

405
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,999
my heart turned hard

406
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,106
and I decided to take everything I could get.

407
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,471
I recieved a medical discharge

408
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,140
from the Airforce and began making plans

409
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,677
for another life.

410
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,092
I mapped out the next 30 years of my life

411
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,893
and went to Kellogg Community College,

412
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,162
determined to become Governor of Michigan

413
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,836
or maybe even U.S. Senator.

414
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,667
It was all about me and who I could use

415
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,869
to climb to the top.

416
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,638
I had become a hardened young man,

417
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,606
cynical about life.

418
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,009
I found Christians, in particular,

419
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,843
worthy of utter disdain.

420
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,511
- Grabs the nightstand and throws
worthy of utter disdain.

421
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,280
It out the window too!

422
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,651
Now, the girl's pretty perplexed,

423
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:50,021
you know, but being a pro, she figures

424
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:52,089
he's got some sort of fetish or something

425
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,993
like that, so she continues to disrobe.

426
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,928
I think we should change the subject.

427
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:58,669
Why?

428
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,965
Those students over there are Christians

429
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,533
and so is the professor.

430
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,535
SQ?

431
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,303
They might be offended.

432
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,572
Well, why would they be offended?

433
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:10,374
They probably won't even get the joke.

434
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,643
I mean Christians have two brains, don't they?

435
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,879
One's lost and the other's out looking for it.

436
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,681
So, you want me to finish the joke?

437
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,549
I got a better one for you.

438
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,351
A man is stumbling through the woods,

439
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,887
totally drunk, when he comes across a

440
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:26,023
preacher who's baptizing people in the river.

441
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,892
He walks up to the preacher who smells

442
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,294
the alcohol on his breath and says,

443
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,063
"Are you ready to find Jesus?"

444
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:35,299
To which the drunk replies, "Sure thing."

445
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,268
So the preacher grabs him by the neck,

446
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,869
dunks him in the river, pulls him up

447
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,806
and says, "Have you found Jesus?"

448
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,774
The drunk spits out some water and says,

449
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,810
"Nope, nope.'"

450
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,745
So, the preacher is a little shocked.

451
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,046
So he grabs the man by the neck,

452
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,615
dunks him in the water again

453
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,316
and holds him under a little longer,

454
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,385
pulls him up and says,

455
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:55,653
"For the love of God, my brother,

456
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,989
have you found Jesus now?"

457
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,725
The drunk wipes his eyes, catches his breath

458
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:04,962
and says, "No sir, I can't find him anywhere.

459
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,410
Are you sure this is where he fell in?"

460
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,170
Like my joke?

461
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,707
Perhaps you have a better one.

462
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:18,409
Or maybe a really good story like, uh,

463
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,477
Jonah and the whale?

464
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,412
Now there's a Whopper.

465
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,482
Or what about Noah and his oceanliner?

466
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,151
Welcome to our table, Mister...

467
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,919
McDowell, I believe it is.

468
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,922
That's right, good to be here.

469
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,759
You know, what is it about you Christians?

470
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,830
What do you mean?

471
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:37,995
Well, I mean everyone knows who you are

472
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,798
and there's only about a half dozen of you,

473
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,901
and uh, plus you and another professor.

474
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,803
And I've been watching you.

475
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,304
Is that so?

476
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,775
Yeah. One thing I can't figure out.

477
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,209
What makes you think you're so different

478
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,644
from the rest of us?

479
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,945
Different?

480
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,114
Yeah, well some of you are good looking,

481
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,287
I'll admit it.

482
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,818
Very good looking.

483
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,319
And, uh,

484
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,855
you seem to be happy most of the time.

485
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,490
Maybe you're brainwashed, I don't know,

486
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,858
probably are.

487
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,427
We have new lives.

488
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,061
New lives, what, like you're

489
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,496
reincarnated or something?

490
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:12,730
How do you get a new life?

491
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:13,998
- Through Jesus Christ.
How do you get a new life?

492
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,067
Come on, don't give me that garbage!

493
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,101
Garbage?

494
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,803
Yeah, the Bible and church,

495
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,037
that's just religion.

496
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,605
And if there's one thing I can't stand,

497
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,173
it's religion.

498
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,074
Well, I didn't say religion, mister.

499
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,042
I said Jesus Christ.

500
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,711
Jesus Christ, how lame is that?

501
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,580
We have new lives through Jesus Christ.

502
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,148
Jesus Christ, what?

503
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,283
Even if he did exist,

504
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,285
how could a man who lived 2,000 years ago

505
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,988
possibly influence someone's life today?

506
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,022
Well, I guess that's what you'll need

507
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:38,722
to find out.

508
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,357
What's there to find out?

509
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,559
Read the Bible and put your faith

510
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,027
in fairy tales?

511
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,763
Come on, Dolly, you can do better than that.

512
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,798
Actually, if you were to disprove

513
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,133
the resurrection,

514
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,668
You would fully prove your point.

515
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:51,469
What?

516
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,870
The resurrection.

517
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:54,472
That Jesus Christ physically rose

518
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,106
from the grave.

519
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,575
If you were to prove that never happened,

520
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,844
you would debunk Christianity.

521
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:01,579
Prove it to be what you claim it to be,

522
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,184
myths and fables.

523
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,883
Now, there's an idea.

524
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,785
I'm quite serious about it, actually.

525
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:10,087
Yeah? Well, so am I.

526
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,295
See where your investigation leads.

527
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,631
Yeah, well nice talking with you.

528
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,463
We look forward to seeing again,

529
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,931
Mr. McDowell.

530
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,399
The name's Josh.

531
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,234
Josh.

532
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,669
And next time, be more prepared.

533
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,439
Prepared? You gotta' be kidding me.

534
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,241
I couldn't be more serious.

535
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,077
Yeah, well let's see what I come up with.

536
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:34,412
And don't get mad at me when I make

537
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,017
all of you look foolish.

538
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,318
Not at all.

539
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,052
Well, have a nice day.

540
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,286
You know, I'd ask you to vote for me

541
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,522
in the student elections, but, uh,

542
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,223
there are so few of you I guess it wouldn't

543
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,261
make much of a difference.

544
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:08,979
I was really determined to prove

545
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,648
those students and professors wrong

546
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,026
about Christianity.

547
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,685
I kind of wanted to rub it in their faces,

548
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,654
if you know what I mean.

549
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,589
The problem for me was I couldn't find

550
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,559
enough material at Kellogg College Library

551
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,369
to prove my main points.

552
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,863
And funny how these things happen...

553
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,899
I began to get the idea of going to Europe

554
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,068
to study original manuscripts that I knew

555
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,570
were housed in some of the libraries

556
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,345
over there.

557
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:37,116
It was early summer 1958.

558
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,479
I had my own money, that wasn't a problem,

559
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,514
so I flew to England and just began to read

560
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,816
everything I could get my hands on.

561
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,627
I read the works of many well-known skeptics.

562
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,589
I also examined the writings of a smaller

563
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,158
group of individuals, all of them proficient

564
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,627
in their areas of expertise,

565
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,262
who started out as unbelievers

566
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,564
and later became Christians.

567
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,999
This intrigued me,

568
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,834
and I wanted to find out why.

569
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,473
What led them to change?

570
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:07,972
There was Lord Lyttleton, who

571
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,808
later became Chancellor of the Exchequer,

572
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:14,578
Gilbert West, Sir William Ramsey,

573
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,715
Frank Morison, <i>C.S.</i> Lewis...

574
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,551
all of them educated successful men

575
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,852
- and skeptics -

576
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,621
who became believers after carefully

577
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,226
studying the evidence.

578
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,194
On the same trip, I went to Germany,

579
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,903
France and Switzerland.

580
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,333
I'd go into various museums and libraries

581
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,402
and look into the glass display cases

582
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:41,038
holding rare books and manuscripts.

583
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,706
I couldn't read Greek or Hebrew,

584
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,677
but I knew those manuscripts were real.

585
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,988
And significance of each one.

586
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:52,817
I made my way back to England,

587
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,019
and just a day or two before my return

588
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,588
trip to the States, I went to a library

589
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,535
on the northeastern edge of London.

590
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,492
It was a small library

591
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,860
someone had told me about,

592
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,695
and it had several books and manuscripts

593
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:06,198
I wanted to study.

594
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:10,605
By this time, I was tired, really tired.

595
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,171
I remember it was about 6:30 in the evening,

596
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,673
and I leaned back in my chair,

597
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,508
put my hands behind my head

598
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,209
and said out loud,

599
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,087
- It's true.
"It's true"

600
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,954
I said it again

601
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,362
It's true.

602
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:28,986
...And again.

603
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:29,829
- It's true!
...and again.

604
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,100
Shhhh...

605
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,529
I had started my journey as an obnoxious,

606
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,698
agnositic university student

607
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,233
who thought Christians were airheads.

608
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,768
I had set out to refute their beliefs

609
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,715
and disprove the resurrection.

610
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,672
But after all my research,

611
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,374
in spite of my prejudice,

612
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,344
I realized I didn't have a valid defense.

613
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,179
The historical evidence all pointed

614
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,281
the other way, and I realized

615
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,350
my rejection of the Bible and Christianity

616
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:03,060
was based more on emotion than intellect.

617
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:06,857
I wasn't ready to become a Christian,

618
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:07,958
but I had to admit there was

619
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,996
compelling evidence to consider,

620
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,235
evidence that demanded a verdict.

621
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,273
There came one running,

622
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,942
and kneeled to him, and asked...

623
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:25,843
- Back in Michigan,
and kneeled to him, and asked...

624
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,445
I continued my college studies

625
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,614
and began attending a small church called

626
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,616
Factoryville Bible Church.

627
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,185
The Pastor's name was Fay Logan.

628
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,987
He knew what I'd been going through, and

629
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,356
one day he prepared a special sermon

630
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,158
Just for me.

631
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,860
But let's be clear,

632
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:47,861
God's salvation is not an intellectual exercise.

633
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:52,703
We are saved by faith and trust in Christ.

634
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:55,272
So, let me ask you,

635
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,141
are you ready to recieve the gift

636
00:37:57,142 --> 00:38:00,711
of eternal life that Jesus is offering you

637
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:05,482
right now? Do you believe?

638
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,318
Are you ready to commit?

639
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,920
Let's review what that commitment

640
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:11,689
will involve.

641
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,724
I acknowledge I am a sinner

642
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,692
in need of salvation.

643
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,129
Secondly, I believe in my heart

644
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,733
that God did raise Jesus from the dead.

645
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:26,236
Thirdly, I confess Jesus as my Lord

646
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,238
and my God.

647
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,075
I knew I needed to respond, but I couldn't.

648
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:34,078
I was afraid.

649
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,647
By receiving Christ as Savior and Lord,

650
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,383
I'd be committing intellectual suicide.

651
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:42,052
I was also afraid of what my friends would say.

652
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,788
I was afraid of what they'd think.

653
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,691
The Holy Spirit welcomes you to come

654
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,494
and trust Jesus as your personal

655
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,062
Lord and Savior.

656
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,230
Who will come?

657
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,766
And then, thank God, one of those friends

658
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,235
leaned over and asked me a question.

659
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,443
Do you want me to go with you?

660
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,354
People think I became a Christian through

661
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,097
the intellectual route. That's not true.

662
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,993
All the study, all the research,

663
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:25,763
that was God's way of getting my attention

664
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:28,665
and I don't downplay it because without it

665
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,967
I would never have considered

666
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,175
the Bible's message.

667
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:42,479
Josh, this Bible is for you.

668
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,414
The door I had closed on God as an

669
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,017
eleven-year-old, cracked open again

670
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,186
and I began to learn that God is love,

671
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,854
and he loves me.

672
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,089
That he's passionate about having

673
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,957
a relationship with me.

674
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,559
And from that day forward

675
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,094
with Pastor Logan's help

676
00:39:57,095 --> 00:40:00,702
I began to learn about the Christian life.

677
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,211
But it wasn't the evidence that brought

678
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,613
me to God.

679
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,787
It was his love.

680
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,257
"I have loved you with an everlasting love;

681
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,034
with tender kindness I have drawn you."

682
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:36,376
That's what God in his mercy did for me.

683
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:45,843
There he is now.

684
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,802
Josh, this is my girlfriend, Gail.

685
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,077
Nice to meet you.

686
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,672
I did not want to love my father

687
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,241
or forgive him.

688
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:19,776
I wanted to continue to hate him.

689
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,445
I believed he had killed my mother

690
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,614
and destroyed our family.

691
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,382
For years, I'd gone to bed at night

692
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:26,683
dreaming up ways to kill him

693
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,052
without being caught by the police,

694
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,421
and here I was, a new Christian,

695
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,333
still determined to hate him.

696
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:37,961
<i>So...</i>

697
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,875
- Dad, I have something to say to you.

698
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:49,744
Dad, I love you.

699
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,111
I don't I know who was more in shock,

700
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,946
him hearing what I said,

701
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,015
or me saying the words.

702
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,417
That's when I knew it was true.

703
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:03,220
I was used to loving those I loved,

704
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,888
but I never had the capacity to love

705
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,957
someone I hated.

706
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,792
I hated my father, and now

707
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,461
I was overcome by love for him.

708
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,829
Christianity was real.

709
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,400
- Josh, how is college?
Christianity was real.

710
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,000
Knowing it was true, however,

711
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,235
even knowing that God

712
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:20,170
loved me unconditionally

713
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,939
didn't make some things any easier

714
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,044
to deal with.

715
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:28,979
I can't, Pastor. I just can't.

716
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,847
It goes too deep.

717
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,115
Josh.

718
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,686
If this is Christianity,

719
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,220
maybe I should hang it up.

720
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,564
I can't.

721
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,625
I'm sorry, Pastor.

722
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,867
This is just too much to ask.

723
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,504
I'm not asking you, Josh.

724
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,647
No one understands.

725
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:08,785
"And when they were come to the place

726
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,988
which is called Calvary,

727
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,858
there they crucified him and the malefactors,

728
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:16,093
one on the right hand

729
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,961
and the other on the left.

730
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:22,132
Then said Jesus, 'Father, forgive them

731
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:25,080
for they know not what they do."'

732
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,579
Altogether, it was a process

733
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,218
of about six months.

734
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,717
And without Pastor Logan's patience

735
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,460
and wisdom, I'd never had done it.

736
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:48,525
Even when I did, I had no emotion about it.

737
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:52,028
I did it by faith, out of obedience,

738
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,441
knowing it was the right thing to do.

739
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,236
I remember hoping I wouldn't be able

740
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:01,581
to find out where he lived.

741
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,276
But I did find out,

742
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,811
and I called him up and I told him

743
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,814
I was coming to see him.

744
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,664
<i>Josh...</i>

745
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,897
Wayne.

746
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:01,433
Wayne, what you did to me was evil.

747
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,874
And you know it was evil.

748
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:08,780
But I've-

749
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:14,244
I've come to know Christ as my Savior,

750
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,413
my Lord.

751
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:18,792
And I've come here to tell you...

752
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,552
I've come here to tell you that

753
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,432
Christ died as much for you as he did for me.

754
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:28,602
I forgive you, Wayne.

755
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:44,009
One more thing, Wayne.

756
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:47,911
Don't let me ever hear of you

757
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,858
touching a young man again.

758
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,189
You'll regret it.

759
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,123
In Hebrews, Jesus is accepted...

760
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,060
Well, the bridge, Josh, I think is love.

761
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:11,494
It's not a line in the sand.

762
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:15,298
It's a relationship - a personal relationship.

763
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,279
I like what Martin Luther said,

764
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,736
"God writes the gospel not in the bible alone

765
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:23,073
but also on the trees and the flowers;

766
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:25,384
on the clouds and the stars."

767
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:28,056
I've been thinking, Josh.

768
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,387
Uh-oh.

769
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,381
I think you need to transfer

770
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:32,849
to Wheaten College.

771
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,551
Wheaten College, where's that?

772
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:35,685
Outside Chicago.

773
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:35,785
- Yeah?
Outside Chicago.

774
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,721
- Oh yeah?
It's where Billy Graham went to school.

775
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:38,288
<i>Hmm...</i>

776
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:40,323
It'll demand a lot out of you academically,

777
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:42,592
but I think you're up to the challenge.

778
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:43,126
You know, Pastor,

779
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:44,694
I've been thinking of studying law?

780
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,262
Really?

781
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:45,862
Yeah.

782
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,297
Well, whatever you decide to do,

783
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:50,370
Wheaten can help you excel. I, <i>uh...</i>

784
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,954
At Wheaten, I had time for two things:

785
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:12,789
Study and work.

786
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,724
I had a part-time job in the afternoons

787
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,393
delivering administrative records

788
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,237
for local high schools.

789
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:16,186
As a result of the accident,

790
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:18,021
the ligaments in my neck were torn loose

791
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:20,468
and my lower back severly injured.

792
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,132
After four days in Intensive Care,

793
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,867
I spent another week and a half

794
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,040
in the hospital.

795
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:53,323
The doctors realized my recovery would be

796
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,091
gradual, and they decided

797
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,833
I should go home to mend.

798
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:04,300
Ironically, the man who hit me

799
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,406
was a drunk driver.

800
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:48,711
The plan was for me to stay at home

801
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,953
where I'd be looked after by a nurse,

802
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:55,058
but the nurse was late the day of my arrival.

803
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,597
My father met the ambulance, instead.

804
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,484
Bring him in here, fellas.

805
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,361
We've got, uh, the furniture out.

806
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,331
Thank you.

807
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,219
About five minutes had passed

808
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,321
when my dad entered the room.

809
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,456
He didn't actually walk into the room,

810
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,125
He stood in the doorway.

811
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:44,093
I couldn't move my head,

812
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:45,462
but I could just make him out

813
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:47,568
through the corner of one eye.

814
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,603
There were two things I noticed right away.

815
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,436
One, he was sober,

816
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:55,739
and the other, he was crying.

817
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,940
I couldn't move any part of my body

818
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,609
except my eyes.

819
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,778
He just pace back and forth,

820
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:04,013
no dialogue, nothing.

821
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,154
I just followed him as best I could.

822
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:17,538
<i>Josh...</i>

823
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,536
HOW.

824
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:26,971
How could you ever love a father like me?

825
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,590
<i>Dad...</i>

826
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:54,038
I've learned one thing.

827
00:53:55,332 --> 00:54:00,543
God became man, and his name is Jesus.

828
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,608
Jesus is passionate to have a relationship

829
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,885
with you.

830
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:20,627
He left the room and was gone.

831
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,525
I don't know, maybe

832
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:24,369
forty-five minutes passed.

833
00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:28,542
Then, he came back into the room.

834
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:39,814
Josh,

835
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,881
If Jesus can do in my life

836
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:48,084
what I've seen him do in yours,

837
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:50,258
then I want to know him.

838
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,797
You need to ask him into your life, dad.

839
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:02,173
Open your hear to him and pray.

840
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,076
God,

841
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:10,373
if you are God,

842
00:55:10,374 --> 00:55:12,475
My dad just prayed a simple prayer,

843
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,810
a farmer's prayer I call it,

844
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,313
very down to earth.

845
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,180
All I could do was cry.

846
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:19,682
Then, please,

847
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,321
come in.

848
00:55:50,214 --> 00:55:52,415
When I came to Christ, my life changed over

849
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:55,151
about a period of a year; year and a half.

850
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:57,654
But when my father made that decision,

851
00:55:57,655 --> 00:55:59,355
the change was immediate.

852
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,325
I saw him change right before my eyes.

853
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:04,160
It was like somebody reached down and

854
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:06,396
turned on a lightbulb in his life.

855
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:08,197
And you know, only once after that

856
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:13,198
did he ever touch alcohol, and he got it

857
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,838
All of you remember the way I used to be,

858
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,340
I was the town drunk.

859
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,876
I was an embarrassment to my family.

860
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,078
Tom, you were there on the hill that day

861
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,046
when Junior was moving the house;

862
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,584
stumbling, falling down drunk.

863
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:28,451
I was an embarrassment.

864
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:30,153
And you know my wife is gone now,

865
00:56:30,154 --> 00:56:31,788
I can't make it up to her, but I can tell you

866
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:33,289
one thing, and it happened right

867
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,893
here in this diner, was when my son, Josh,

868
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:40,863
said to me, "Dad, I love you."

869
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:42,265
And those were his exact words,

870
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:44,967
"Dad, I love you." And that's...

871
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,536
As a result of my dad's decision

872
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:49,238
to trust Christ, scores of people in our town

873
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,274
and the surrounding area came to know

874
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:53,543
Jesus Christ as savior and Lord.

875
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:55,278
All because of the changed life

876
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:57,747
of the town drunk.

877
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:00,991
I just wish my mother could have seen it.

878
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:06,155
Fourteen months later, my father died.

879
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,690
Three-fourths of his stomach had to be

880
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:11,160
cut out, his entire liver was destroyed

881
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,763
through thirty-some years of drinking.

882
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,398
I was at Wheaten College when I got

883
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:18,668
the news - which brings me back

884
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:20,808
to where our story began.

885
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:26,709
I had run out of Edman Chapel that evening.

886
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,878
"Who will go?" the chapel speaker had said,

887
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:31,180
quoting the prophet Isaiah.

888
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:33,049
"Who will make their abilities available

889
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,953
to God?" It sure wasn't going to be me,

890
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:40,265
even if I was a student at Wheaten College.

891
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,628
I still had feelings of inferiority,

892
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,064
I still carried the scars of abuse

893
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:51,300
and violence and family brokenness.

894
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,836
Yeah, sure, I might succeed in hiding these

895
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:56,205
things from others, but how could I

896
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:58,207
hide them from myself?

897
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,275
I remember thinking,

898
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:01,511
"Well, maybe I should jusk walk away.

899
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:03,512
Maybe I should leave the faith."

900
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:08,513
All I'd ever heard as a Christian was that

901
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,887
for his glory.

902
00:58:10,888 --> 00:58:13,456
That created a huge problem for me.

903
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:15,925
I felt I had nothing to offer God

904
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:18,532
but weakness and failure.

905
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,699
My life story didn't have a fairy tale ending.

906
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,167
And then I did something I thought

907
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:29,005
I'd never do. I stopped and said,

908
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,954
God, all I have are failures

909
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:36,345
But if you can take my weaknesses

910
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,587
and glorify yourself through them,

911
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:43,358
I'll serve you with every breath I breathe.

912
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,923
And that's the story, my friend.

913
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:49,325
That's the story of how God saved me

914
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:51,094
from destruction.

915
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:53,362
How he chose the foolish and simple things

916
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,310
to confound the strong and wise.

917
00:58:57,501 --> 00:59:00,948
The rest, I guess you'd say, is history.

918
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:31,905
Maybe you can identify with pan of my story.

919
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:35,200
Alcoholic or drug addicted parents,

920
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:36,970
abuse,

921
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:40,236
or that sense of loneliness where

922
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:43,072
you feel like it wouldn't matter to anyone

923
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:44,746
if you lived or died.

924
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:47,716
Or that hopelessness

925
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:50,579
that comes from that feeling that

926
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,615
God just can't forgive me

927
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:54,383
or it's too late.

928
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,352
I want you to understand something,

929
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:58,026
it is never too late.

930
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:00,222
One of the barriers that I had

931
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,724
in ever coming to God

932
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,693
might be your problem, too.

933
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:06,504
It was the image of my earthly father.

934
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:08,831
You see, people would tell me that

935
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,433
your heavenly father loves you,

936
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,935
and that didn't bring joy into my life.

937
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:14,236
That brought pain.

938
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,443
You say, "Why?"

939
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:21,006
Because I was not emotionally able to discern

940
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,614
and an earthly father.

941
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:28,961
Growing up to me - fathers hurt.

942
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,700
One thing I had to realize, though,

943
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:35,925
is that Christianity is not a religion,

944
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:37,860
It's a relationship.

945
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,862
You say, "what's the difference?"

946
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,797
You see, a religion is men and women

947
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,833
trying to work their way to God

948
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:46,669
through good works and religious ritual.

949
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,971
Christianity is God coming to us

950
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:50,873
through his Son Jesus Christ

951
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,411
offering us a relationship.

952
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,412
Most people think that I came to Christ

953
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:57,980
because of all the evidence

954
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:01,016
that I've documented in my books.

955
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:02,451
But none of that brought me to Christ,

956
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:05,121
it only showed me that it was true.

957
01:02:05,122 --> 01:02:06,555
What really brought me to Christ

958
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,058
was God's love.

959
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:10,459
God loved me so much

960
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,596
that if I were the only person alive,

961
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:15,564
Christ would still die for me,

962
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,666
and the same is true of you.

963
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,634
You might be saying,

964
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:22,471
"Josh, I want to know Christ personally.

965
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:24,940
I want to know that I'm forgiven.

966
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:27,176
I want to know that if I were to die today

967
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:28,944
where I'd spend eternity."

968
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,288
And you can.

969
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:34,383
We come to Christ by faith

970
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:36,152
through prayer, expressing that desire

971
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:37,686
of our heart.

972
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,488
And maybe the prayer that I prayed

973
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:40,990
would help you

974
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:43,793
to express that desire to God right now,

975
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:45,796
to invite Christ into your life.

976
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,832
I don't ask you to bow your heads.

977
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,301
I don't even ask you to close your eyes.

978
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:55,237
Because years ago, I learned the key to prayer

979
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,640
is not in the position of the body,

980
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:59,908
but in the attitude of the heart.

981
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:02,111
This is a prayer that I prayed:

982
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:05,881
"Lord Jesus, I need you.

983
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,918
Thank you for dying on the cross for me.

984
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:11,787
Forgive me and cleanse me.

985
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,957
Right now, I trust you as Savior and Lord.

986
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,126
Come into my life.

987
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,995
Thank you that I can trust you.

988
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:23,034
In Christ's Name. Amen."

989
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:26,535
If you just prayed that prayer with me,

990
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,311
and you were sincere,

991
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,573
I want you in the next few days

992
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:33,442
to find a follower of Jesus

993
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:35,044
and share with him or her

994
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:37,580
the decision you just made.

995
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:39,848
And then do something that I did.

996
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,217
Find a Bible,

997
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:43,419
turn to the third Chapter of John,

998
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,753
it's in the New Testament,

999
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:47,857
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John

1000
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:51,567
and read John 3, three times.

1001
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:54,497
And then I want to help you grow.

1002
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:55,965
I want to help you see Christ

1003
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:59,034
truly change your life from the inside out.

1004
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,669
Go to my website,

1005
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,606
it's josh.org/undaunted.

1006
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:08,411
Josh.org/undaunted

1007
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:09,979
And I will be able to share with you

1008
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,847
many things through my site

1009
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,182
that can help you to see

1010
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:16,218
God change your life forever.

1011
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:19,421
Thank you so much for letting me be a part

1012
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:24,422
of your life.
