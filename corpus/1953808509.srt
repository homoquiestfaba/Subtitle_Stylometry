00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,484
<i>At</i> first, <i>I</i> didn't believe it either.

3
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,179
<i>But the gods of Olympus are real.</i>

4
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:18,690
<i>And sometimes,
these gods have children with humans...</i>

5
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,690
<i>called half-bloods.</i>

6
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,260
<i>I'm one of them.</i>

7
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:26,492
<i>I'm Percy Jackson.
Son of Poseidon, god of the sea.</i>

8
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:40,315
Seven <i>years ago, four of these children</i>
were <i>headed to Camp Half-Blood...</i>

9
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,043
<i>the only place on Earth
that is safe for our kind.</i>

10
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:46,817
<i>Only three of them made it.</i>

11
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,685
We're almost at camp!

12
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:00,961
Look out!

13
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,066
Grover! Luke, help him!

14
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,330
Grover, are you okay?

15
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:08,501
My leg. it's stuck.

16
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:14,447
Come on. I got you.

17
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:16,107
Keep going. I'll hold them off.

18
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:19,313
No, Thalia. They'll kill you.

19
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,324
Go, Luke. I'll be right behind you.

20
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:31,324
Over here!

21
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,900
Annabeth, come on!

22
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,595
Stay back.

23
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:47,877
Thalia, come on!

24
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:53,920
No! Thalia!

25
00:02:58,146 --> 00:03:03,328
<i>He! name was Thalia,
and she gave her life to save three.</i>

26
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:11,664
<i>And so, as Thalia lay dying...</i>

27
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,108
<i>her father Zeus found
another way for her to live.</i>

28
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:31,521
<i>A way for all half-bloods to live.</i>

29
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:37,568
<i>A gift to ensure no one in Camp Half-Blood
would die the same way.</i>

30
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:44,401
<i>The barrier, to protect them from those
who lived for their death.</i>

31
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:47,541
Let's go!

32
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:55,616
<i>Every day,
the story of Thalia's bravery inspires me.</i>

33
00:03:57,473 --> 00:04:01,118
<i>And her tree protects my home.</i>

34
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:05,793
<i>But not always my head.</i>

35
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:17,366
How nice of you to show up
just to watch me win.

36
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,339
Everything they say about you
is wrong, Clarisse.

37
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,808
You actually do have a sense of humor.

38
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:34,085
- There goes another one.
- Go, Percy!

39
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:38,055
Come on, Percy!
I got 50 drachma on you!

40
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:40,427
You bet on this?

41
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:42,256
What, is that wrong?

42
00:04:47,524 --> 00:04:50,268
'97 Xinomavro. Would you like a taste?

43
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,036
Why do you torture yourself, Dionysus?

44
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:58,914
It was one transgression, one.

45
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:01,585
And with a naiad,
for the sake of Olympus.

46
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:03,775
How was I to know that
Zeus had a thing for her?

47
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:07,188
Or that he could
hold a grudge for so long?

48
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,125
I think the fact
that Zeus is immortal...

49
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:17,361
means there's no limit
to how long he can hold a grudge.

50
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:20,470
The Christians have a guy
who can do this trick in reverse.

51
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:22,197
Now, that's a god.

52
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:27,677
Aren't you tired of getting beat,
Jackson?

53
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:47,260
Clarissa!

54
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:53,667
Help! Help me!

55
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,014
Tereus, grab my hand!

56
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:13,655
Good luck with that.

57
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:16,217
'90! you.

58
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:25,027
Thank you!

59
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:27,370
Percy!

60
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:41,015
Clarissa! Clarissa! Clarissa!

61
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:51,356
So, what I'm wondering is, Percy...

62
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:55,501
that first quest you went on,
beginner's luck, wasn't it?

63
00:06:56,254 --> 00:07:00,206
Clarisse, he saved Olympus.
That's more than you've ever done.

64
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,431
Whatever.

65
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,804
Even for the daughter of the god of war,
that girl's a mythic bi--

66
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:07,104
Don't listen to her, Percy.

67
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:08,907
You know, it's too late.

68
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,275
Besides, she has a point.

69
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,041
Dude, what are you talking about?

70
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:15,211
You're more than a one-quest wonder.

71
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:17,380
You recovered Ares' stolen chariot.

72
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:19,754
No, actually, that was Clarissa.

73
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:23,225
Okay, what about the Fall Tournament?
You owned that sucker.

74
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:24,384
Clarissa?

75
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:28,433
Okay, the Solstice Games?
The Bronze Dragon's Quest?

76
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,373
Thank you for trying to cheer me up.

77
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:37,307
I would lick a pair of cloven hooves...

78
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:39,344
before I let you listen to Clarisse
instead of us.

79
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:40,433
No offense, Grover.

80
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:42,343
None taken. Is that an offer?

81
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:44,746
Listen, it doesn't matter
what Clarissa has done.

82
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:47,217
To Chiron and Mr. D,
you're still the rock star.

83
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:49,049
Perry Johnson!

84
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:51,615
Actually, it's Percy Jackson, sir.

85
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,789
Whatever.

86
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,621
I have a very important task
to entrust you with.

87
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:56,750
You do?

88
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:59,833
Yes, it's a critical assignment.
And it's very taxing.

89
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,160
Can I trust you?

90
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:02,255
Of course.

91
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:04,393
Good. You'll need this.

92
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:10,907
Sometimes these events
get a little messy.

93
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,447
<i>Maybe Clarissa was right.</i>

94
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:26,322
Maybe I only stopped
Luke from destroying Olympus...

95
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:29,454
because I had Annabeth and Grover
helping me, right?

96
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:33,563
Dad?

97
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,497
Poseidon?

98
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:48,915
Have you ever felt like everything
you've ever done...

99
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:51,083
maybe you didn't really do it?

100
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,380
It was all just luck or something?

101
00:08:57,177 --> 00:08:59,181
No, of course not.

102
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,882
You're a god.

103
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:07,162
Speaking as someone who's not,
it sucks.

104
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:13,401
It makes you question whether
you were all that good to begin with.

105
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:22,574
Okay. Good not talking to you.

106
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:24,239
Again.

107
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:36,895
So, he just walked right in?

108
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:38,897
He just walked straight into camp?

109
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:40,968
It seems he lumbered, actually.

110
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:43,136
I don't care if he sashayed!

111
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:46,865
What's the point of having this mystical
protective barrier if any thing can just--

112
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,773
Could you not touch that, please?
That's a very precious Grenache.

113
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:50,865
I think the point is...

114
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:54,073
since he did pass right through
the barrier from Thalia's tree...

115
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:57,709
- Don't say it.
-...It means he's most likely a god-spawn.

116
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:02,486
Yeah, but the spawn of which god?

117
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:04,385
I know.

118
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,953
Poseidon.

119
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,341
So, why did Mr. D summon you?
It's not good to get summoned.

120
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:26,504
I'm sure it's fine.

121
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,636
I'm sure you don't get summoned

122
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:29,614
to the Big House
without a major-league screw-up.

123
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:30,877
I didn't screw up.

124
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:33,386
I cleaned the entire coliseum.
And vacuumed.

125
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:35,456
Don't let him get into your head, okay?

126
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:38,425
We have a dead camper walking.
Dead camper walking, here.

127
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,323
Thanks. This is friendship.

128
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,359
I'm just playing,
just trying to have a little fun.

129
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,692
It's all right.

130
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:45,924
So, it's okay if I get your cabin
when you get kicked out?

131
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,400
Seriously, don't worry. it's just Mr. D.

132
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:51,667
I mean, if Chiron had summoned you,
then...

133
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,476
You are so massively screwed.

134
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:03,218
Whatever it is you think I did,
I didn't do it.

135
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:04,908
You've done nothing, Percy.

136
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:06,179
Exactly.

137
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,794
As you know, you are believed
to be Poseidon's only heir.

138
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,687
Yeah, so?

139
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,992
So, it would seem that belief
has been held in error.

140
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:19,256
Hold on.
You're saying Percy has a brother?

141
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:20,857
Or a sister.

142
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:26,667
Holy Styx. Another Poseidon half-blood.

143
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,475
Not exactly.

144
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:33,171
Technically, Tyson is not a half-blood.

145
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:35,611
Half-bloods are half-human,
hence the name.

146
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:36,911
I don't get it.

147
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:40,320
If this new kid is not half-human,
then what other half is he?

148
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,584
Nymph. Sea nymph.

149
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:44,953
And when you cross a deity with a nymph,
you get...

150
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:47,655
Don't touch. it's a Gewurztraminer.

151
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,091
Hi.

152
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:52,189
Hi, Brother.

153
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,855
So, you're the big shot here, right?
You saved the world and stuff.

154
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:19,053
Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:23,058
Hey. they put peppers in yours.

156
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:25,192
Are you gonna eat that?

157
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:27,601
Go ahead.

158
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:33,338
Is he messing with me?

159
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:34,804
I think he's hungry.

160
00:12:34,897 --> 00:12:36,936
No, not him. I meant Poseidon.

161
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,011
Is this supposed to be
some kind of joke?

162
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:42,382
A half-brother? A Cyclops? Come on.

163
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:47,520
I think the politically correct term
is "ocularly impaired."

164
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,191
And a half-brother
is better than nothing.

165
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,691
I like having a brother.

166
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,386
Dad was cool to bring me here.

167
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:54,191
Dad? Dad brought you here?

168
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:56,861
I was upstate, in the woods.

169
00:12:56,953 --> 00:13:01,133
One day, this trident shows up over
my head, and then it started moving south.

170
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:04,765
And you followed it.
You followed it here.

171
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,740
It glowed.

172
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,971
Well, somebody has got a new brother.

173
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,379
And I can see he's got his daddy's eyes.

174
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:14,548
Well...

175
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:16,250
"Eye."

176
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:20,182
You should really get him
some sprayable mist.

177
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:23,988
Anyway, it is kind of interesting timing,
don't you think?

178
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,100
Maybe Poseidon decided he needed
another son to, you know...

179
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,390
represent.

180
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:31,931
Bull.

181
00:13:32,322 --> 00:13:33,564
Excuse me?

182
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:35,101
Smells like bull.

183
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:47,274
We got barrier action.

184
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:50,611
Hey, Chris, you coming?

185
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:52,982
No, I'm good.

186
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,460
That is so awesome.

187
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,203
It's chill. The barrier is holding.

188
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:20,375
A Colchis bull.

189
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:21,678
Run!

190
00:14:34,752 --> 00:14:35,731
Percy!

191
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:37,890
Come on!

192
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:07,596
- We have to find its weak spot.
- Does it have one?

193
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:09,689
Percy, distract it for me.

194
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:52,902
I got this.

195
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:37,211
Bad bull.

196
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:40,489
Hey, rust bucket!

197
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,798
Damn it, Jackson.

198
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:08,809
Do you have any idea
how hard Colchis bulls are to come by?

199
00:18:09,937 --> 00:18:12,442
Maybe next time
you try to drown someone...

200
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:18,425
you'll first make sure he's not
a demigod who can swim.

201
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:24,855
Luke?

202
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:28,459
Turns out, you're not the only
half-blood who's hard to kill.

203
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:33,231
You know, prophecy.

204
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:37,505
What prophecy?
What are you talking about?

205
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:39,178
You don't know?

206
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:40,969
Huh.

207
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:46,020
Add that to the long list of things
your buddy Chiron hasn't shared with you.

208
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:50,150
Chiron, Mr. D, all the rest...

209
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:53,287
they don't care about us.

210
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:56,593
To them, we're just kids.

211
00:18:56,784 --> 00:19:00,064
A bunch of pawns meant to be
pushed around, told what to do.

212
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:02,903
I'm not the only half-blood
who thinks so.

213
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,102
Think about it.

214
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:21,883
What did I miss?

215
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:23,184
Where's Percy?

216
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:26,387
Last time I saw him,
he was getting dragged by a Colchis bull.

217
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:28,360
Hey, you.

218
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:30,128
How come you aren't barbecued?

219
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:31,790
Cyclopes are fireproof.

220
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:34,335
How did the bull get through the barrier?

221
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:37,635
Oh, my gods.

222
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:01,791
Poisoned.

223
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,896
Is she... ls the tree dead?

224
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:05,657
No, but dying.

225
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,066
A condition we're about to become
all too familiar with.

226
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:16,569
Everybody, we're going to need
a guard detail to patrol the perimeter.

227
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:19,647
It feels like she's dying all over again.

228
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:22,808
Who would do this?

229
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,548
Luke poisoned the tree.

230
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:27,649
Percy!

231
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,786
Yay, you're alive.

232
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,721
Yeah, I'm not the only one.

233
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:34,829
Luke let the bull in.

234
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:36,429
Without the tree's barrier...

235
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,329
he probably figures there's enough

236
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,095
demi-Titans out there
to get him what he wants.

237
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:42,398
And that would be what, exactly?

238
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,803
Our annihilation, Ms. La Rue.

239
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:48,436
Our annihilation.

240
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,051
How's the antidote coming?

241
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,415
Slowly.

242
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:03,259
I know this probably isn't the best time...

243
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:07,061
but there's something I have to ask you.

244
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,494
What is it?

245
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:13,095
It was something Luke said
about a prophecy...

246
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:15,271
how I'm mentioned in it.

247
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:18,131
Do you know anything about this?

248
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:22,673
Knowledge isn't always power, Percy.

249
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:25,470
Sometimes, it's a burden.

250
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:27,673
I know that.

251
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:31,307
But like you said,
I've been pretty unexceptional lately.

252
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:31,718
But like you said,
I've been pretty unexceptional lately.

253
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:35,919
It's got me wondering
if I'm prophecy-worthy.

254
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:38,425
They say that when the gods
wish to torture us...

255
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,292
they answer our prayers.

256
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:44,094
Necklace of Harmonia, Hercules' bow,
Golden Apple of Discord.

257
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,093
Three millennia of gods and demigods...

258
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:49,264
you'd think that someone would have
come up with a cure for Thalia's tree.

259
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,038
Persephone did come up with Miracle-Gro.
Maybe we can try that.

260
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,505
That's it.

261
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,042
Right here.

262
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:01,580
That is not gonna cure Thalia's tree
so much as get us all killed.

263
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:02,879
Me, in particular.

264
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:05,820
It's perfect. it's exactly what we need.

265
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,791
I'm taking this to Mr. D.

266
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:09,950
No.

267
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:19,600
I was hoping to spare you this onus
a little while longer, but go inside.

268
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,170
Upstairs, to the attic.

269
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,764
And when you come back down,
we'll talk some more.

270
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:26,572
Assuming you're still sane, that is.

271
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:02,012
I am the spirit of Delphi...

272
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,047
speaker of the prophecies
of Phoebus Apollo...

273
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:07,514
slayer of the mighty Python.

274
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:11,350
Approach, seeker, and ask.

275
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:16,159
I heard there was a prophecy about me.

276
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:17,726
Aye.

277
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:22,700
But before you learn the future,
know first the past.

278
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:28,039
<i>Long ago, before our time...</i>

279
00:23:28,226 --> 00:23:30,265
<i>before Olympus and the gods...</i>

280
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:33,742
<i>Titans ruled the world.</i>

281
00:23:34,298 --> 00:23:36,007
<i>Led by Kronos...</i>

282
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,620
<i>a force so evil,
he devoured his own children.</i>

283
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:43,287
<i>But three of his sons escaped.</i>

284
00:23:43,475 --> 00:23:46,755
<i>Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.</i>

285
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,356
<i>They destroyed Kronos...</i>

286
00:23:53,452 --> 00:23:58,030
<i>and banished his remains
to the depths of Tartarus.</i>

287
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,936
<i>But Kronos is fated to rise again...</i>

288
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:07,842
<i>to exact his vengeance on Olympus,
and the world.</i>

289
00:24:09,668 --> 00:24:14,952
<i>Only one half-blood child of the
three eldest gods can defeat him.</i>

290
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,352
<i>This child shall be our salvation...</i>

291
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:21,686
<i>or the cause of our destruction.</i>

292
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:28,925
<i>It all begins when two cousins
grapple for a fleece...</i>

293
00:24:29,354 --> 00:24:32,338
<i>the son of the sea
and the lightning thief.</i>

294
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:34,263
Luke.

295
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,965
And that half-blood
of the eldest gods...

296
00:24:37,162 --> 00:24:40,112
shall reach 20 against all odds.

297
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:43,545
"And see the world in endless sleep...

298
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:47,516
"the evil soul,
cursed blade shall reap.

299
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:49,552
"A single choice shall end his days...

300
00:24:49,642 --> 00:24:53,024
"Olympus to preserve or raze."

301
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:56,663
And that is "raze" with a
as in "destroy."

302
00:24:57,182 --> 00:24:58,663
l asked.

303
00:25:01,153 --> 00:25:05,037
Is there any chance,
any chance at all...

304
00:25:05,224 --> 00:25:08,471
that I might not be the guy
in the prophecy?

305
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:11,508
The Oracle references
a half-blood of the eldest gods.

306
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:16,711
You are the only living half-blood heir
of Zeus, Hades or Poseidon.

307
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:19,215
The prophecy could refer only to you.

308
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:22,981
What if I destroy Olympus...

309
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:26,319
by not being good enough to save it?

310
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:29,861
That seems to be the question,
doesn't it?

311
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:32,592
It's absolutely out of the question.

312
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:34,667
If you could just listen to me
for one moment--

313
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:36,702
lam listening.
You want to go on a quest.

314
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:38,099
It must be Thursday.

315
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:41,334
I'm serious. I'm absolutely
sure that this is gonna work.

316
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:45,104
It was such a good year.

317
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:47,907
The Golden Fleece
can heal any living person or thing...

318
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:50,313
including Thalia's tree.

319
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:53,646
We heal the tree,
we restore the barrier around camp.

320
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:57,022
I'm surprised you want to go along
with her on this, Mr. Undershirt.

321
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,089
Underwood.

322
00:25:58,178 --> 00:25:59,317
Whatever.

323
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:03,162
Every satyr who has ever
gone after the Fleece has died.

324
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:05,832
Right? I mentioned that to her.

325
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:10,469
But it's a risk I'm willing to take
for the good of the camp.

326
00:26:11,157 --> 00:26:13,470
Look, the last I heard...

327
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,336
the Golden Fleece
was in the Sea of Monsters...

328
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,503
what the humans call
the Bermuda Triangle.

329
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,013
A place not only a satyr
should be afraid of.

330
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:24,848
So, the answer is no. No.
I'm sorry, Annabelle.

331
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:25,950
Annabeth.

332
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,114
Whatever. it's a terrible idea.

333
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,758
I've had a grand idea.

334
00:26:33,614 --> 00:26:36,028
Unless Thalia's tree can be cured...

335
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:40,363
and the protective barrier
around our camp restored...

336
00:26:40,554 --> 00:26:44,199
then every demigod, centaur,
satyr and nymph...

337
00:26:44,725 --> 00:26:47,106
will be killed within days,
if not sooner.

338
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:48,869
Hey, you okay?

339
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,013
Don't worry, camp will be okay.

340
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:54,478
You have to have faith, right?

341
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:57,177
But fortunately,
I have considered the matter.

342
00:26:57,972 --> 00:26:58,951
And after great study...

343
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,388
I have determined that the only thing
that has the power to save Thalia's tree...

344
00:27:02,476 --> 00:27:04,185
and therefore our home...

345
00:27:04,311 --> 00:27:06,315
is the Golden Fleece of myth...

346
00:27:08,716 --> 00:27:09,855
What?

347
00:27:10,551 --> 00:27:11,827
...whose touch...

348
00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:17,873
...can heal every person
and every thing.

349
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:23,469
So, a quest, a mission of mercy,
if you will...

350
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:26,079
into uncharted and deadly waters...

351
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:29,509
with nothing less at stake
than our own survival.

352
00:27:30,138 --> 00:27:35,787
Now, a satyr is naturally drawn,
as you know, to the power of the Fleece.

353
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:40,054
And therefore, it must be a satyr
who will guide a half-blood on this quest.

354
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:41,895
Thanks a lot.

355
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,621
Ichneutae!

356
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:46,223
Will you guide the champion?

357
00:27:46,421 --> 00:27:48,095
Oh, yeah.

358
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,102
Good. Great! That's great!

359
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,473
Yeah!

360
00:27:56,464 --> 00:28:01,475
As to who that champion might be,
our plight calls for only our finest hero.

361
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:06,385
The best of us,
the strongest and the bravest.

362
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:10,048
The scion of the god of war...

363
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:11,247
Clarissa!

364
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:12,860
Yes!

365
00:28:16,618 --> 00:28:17,689
Thank you.

366
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:20,996
Her name, he gets right.

367
00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:27,735
Hey, Clarissa. Clarissa!

368
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,909
What?

369
00:28:29,732 --> 00:28:32,146
Don't worry about always
coming in second, Jackson.

370
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:33,806
You do get used to it.

371
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:35,906
I think, right?
Obviously, I wouldn't know.

372
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,212
Listen, Luke is still out there.

373
00:28:37,305 --> 00:28:39,686
He's involved with the Fleece somehow...

374
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:42,548
and I've got a feeling
that he's not done yet.

375
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:43,624
Really?

376
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:46,490
Because I've got a feeling
that I don't really care.

377
00:28:46,582 --> 00:28:48,393
Gosh, don't look so wounded.

378
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:51,896
Listen, there are generals,
and there are foot soldiers.

379
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:55,164
And you should feel lucky that you even
made it into the army at all.

380
00:28:55,257 --> 00:28:58,799
Just try not to screw up anything
too badly while I'm gone. Okay?

381
00:28:59,995 --> 00:29:00,895
Let's go.

382
00:29:00,896 --> 00:29:00,998
Let's go.

383
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:13,483
"Cursed blade shall reap."

384
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:17,184
"Cursed blade shall reap."

385
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:22,295
What good is a prophecy
if you can't even understand it?

386
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:28,468
I guess you don't have
any answers either, Dad.

387
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,598
This was your sword.

388
00:29:43,973 --> 00:29:44,952
This is a bad idea.

389
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,316
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

390
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,915
You were going to say that you're
going after the Fleece to save the camp.

391
00:29:49,012 --> 00:29:51,494
Actually, he was gonna say "we" were.

392
00:29:52,683 --> 00:29:54,858
Look, I get what you're doing here.

393
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:56,589
You're worried about
the one-quest wonder thing...

394
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:58,394
and you want to make your bones.

395
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:00,629
But lchneutae and Clarisse
are already going after the Fleece...

396
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:03,104
and it's not cool to bogart
on someone else's quest.

397
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:04,969
I think this is my quest, too.

398
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:06,838
The Oracle says
he wrestles Luke for the Fleece.

399
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,210
"Grapples." But she also said...

400
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,377
that I'm destined to destroy Olympus,
or save it.

401
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:19,852
Saving is better, obviously.

402
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:21,456
Yeah.

403
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:25,829
Let me pack a bag and make sure
my health insurance is paid up.

404
00:30:41,598 --> 00:30:43,580
How are we gonna get past them?

405
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,680
I think they're looking
for threats trying to come in...

406
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:48,150
not people trying to sneak out...

407
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:51,049
so, I think we're cool
as long as we stay quiet.

408
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:54,356
Sorry!

409
00:30:58,716 --> 00:30:59,855
We're...

410
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:02,724
We're guarding, too.

411
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:05,192
You left without me.

412
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:08,034
Tyson, where we're going,
it's very dangerous.

413
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:09,604
I know. I'm not stupid.

414
00:31:09,694 --> 00:31:11,003
No,just dumb.

415
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:12,605
I want to help.

416
00:31:14,098 --> 00:31:15,545
You'd do it for me.

417
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:17,236
I appreciate that...

418
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:21,284
but I don't think you understand
exactly how dangerous this is going to be.

419
00:31:21,372 --> 00:31:22,511
I do.

420
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:24,882
The Fleece is guarded by Polyphemus.

421
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,154
Who?

422
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:27,383
Polyphemus.

423
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:30,221
Closest thing Cyclopes
have got to someone famous.

424
00:31:30,315 --> 00:31:33,595
Captured Odysseus. Lives in Circeland.

425
00:31:33,785 --> 00:31:35,266
Wait, Circeland?

426
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:36,865
Built on his island.

427
00:31:36,954 --> 00:31:38,367
Long story.

428
00:31:38,556 --> 00:31:40,731
Point is, maybe I can talk to him.

429
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:42,907
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.

430
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:45,975
No, you can't,
because I'm not going with a Cyclops.

431
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:50,641
Then we got a problem,
because I'm not going without one.

432
00:31:50,968 --> 00:31:55,183
This Polyphemus is probably what killed
every satyr that's gone near the Fleece.

433
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:57,221
You want me to lead you to a Cyclops?
Fine.

434
00:31:57,308 --> 00:32:00,588
But I'm bringing along one of my own,
for protection.

435
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,486
No way.

436
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:04,160
No.

437
00:32:11,923 --> 00:32:13,871
What do you think's
gonna attract more attention...

438
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,496
all the noise or the one eye?

439
00:32:15,593 --> 00:32:17,575
Just give the guy a break, okay?

440
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:20,268
Okay, fine.

441
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:21,367
Keep it down.

442
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:23,676
This is crazy hard to come by...

443
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:25,851
and I only brought it along
in case of an emergency...

444
00:32:25,937 --> 00:32:30,185
which I guess this is an emergency,
so... here.

445
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:33,814
Mist?

446
00:32:34,012 --> 00:32:36,051
It makes the mystical look normal.

447
00:32:36,148 --> 00:32:37,788
"Side effects may include handsomeness,

448
00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:40,263
headache, self-esteem
and low self-esteem."

449
00:32:40,352 --> 00:32:42,264
And just know
that if the camp wasn't in danger...

450
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:43,699
I wouldn't be wasting this on you.

451
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:45,167
Wasting what?

452
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:50,641
It's not gonna last forever.
You're gonna have to reapply it.

453
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:01,077
Extreme makeover alert.

454
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,919
How do I look?

455
00:33:07,113 --> 00:33:09,652
A bit like Dad, actually.

456
00:33:09,848 --> 00:33:11,830
He's still a Cyclops.

457
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:16,725
Grover, where are we going?
What does your nose say?

458
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:20,334
Somewhere off the coast of Florida.
South.

459
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:23,567
Over here.

460
00:33:23,763 --> 00:33:25,209
Annie! Hey!

461
00:33:39,178 --> 00:33:41,251
It's the Chariot of Damnation.

462
00:33:41,447 --> 00:33:43,555
Looks like a New York City cab.

463
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,094
Same difference.

464
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:50,101
No dollars, no credit cards.
Drachmas only.

465
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:52,066
Exact... Change... Please.

466
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:53,898
Chop, chop! Get in the cab.

467
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:56,875
We just had this cab sanitized
for your protection.

468
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:58,373
It wasn't this year, though.

469
00:33:58,465 --> 00:34:00,913
Excuse me,
we're trying to get to Florida.

470
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:03,716
Our kind of fare. Pricey.

471
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:11,387
<i>Hey, there.
This is Ganymede, cupbearer to Zeus.</i>

472
00:34:11,578 --> 00:34:13,924
<i>And when I'm out buying wine
for the lord of the skies...</i>

473
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:15,892
<i>I always remember to buckle up.</i>

474
00:34:15,982 --> 00:34:18,261
Maybe we should have flown commercial.

475
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:21,758
Look out!

476
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:27,034
Calm down.
If we didn't know what we were doing...

477
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:28,766
We wouldn't be licensed.

478
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:33,202
They don't have eyes.

479
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:35,442
Yeah.

480
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,143
- I know, awful picture.
- Bad hair day.

481
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,583
We do so have an eye.

482
00:34:40,673 --> 00:34:42,348
It's around here somewhere.

483
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:45,085
The last time I saw it, you put it
in the glove compartment, Anger.

484
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:46,624
Don't use that tone with my name.

485
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:48,490
It's not there this time.

486
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:53,197
Wasp always puts it with the keys.

487
00:34:53,854 --> 00:34:56,565
- And it's 20,120.
-So is mine!

488
00:34:56,757 --> 00:34:58,830
Shouldn't the driver get the eye?

489
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:01,570
She'll be fine.

490
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,211
Tempest, split!

491
00:35:13,173 --> 00:35:14,152
Percy!

492
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:18,957
We paid extra for that option.

493
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:26,160
The kid is right.
The driver should have the eyeball.

494
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:27,461
He's a freaking genius!

495
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:29,001
You're the one that put it in the visor.

496
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:32,631
While it's on the table,
I haven't had a turn in quite some time.

497
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:35,504
Oh, no, you didn't!

498
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:36,835
Yes, I did.

499
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:41,505
Hands on the wheel at least, okay?

500
00:35:45,573 --> 00:35:47,020
- We're all gonna die!
- Pipe down.

501
00:35:47,108 --> 00:35:50,456
Didn't that prophecy say
you're gonna make it till at least 20?

502
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:51,616
You know about the prophecy?

503
00:35:51,712 --> 00:35:53,455
- Sure.
- The Oracle is a friend.

504
00:35:53,548 --> 00:35:55,393
- We're besties.
- B-F-F!

505
00:35:57,018 --> 00:35:58,225
EVE! Eye! Eye!

506
00:35:58,419 --> 00:36:00,298
Gross! Get it off me!

507
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,466
What do you know about the prophecy?

508
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:08,441
No!

509
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:12,872
Okay, okay.

510
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:19,921
30. 31, 75,12.

511
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:21,087
What?

512
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:23,915
Percy, you got your answer!

513
00:36:24,012 --> 00:36:25,584
All I got were numbers.

514
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:27,127
- Yes.
- You'll know...

515
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:28,955
When it matters.

516
00:36:32,153 --> 00:36:33,964
I think we're a little short on drachmas.

517
00:36:34,055 --> 00:36:35,034
What?

518
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:48,981
What do you... think we're...
running here?

519
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:49,981
A charity?

520
00:36:50,072 --> 00:36:51,706
- Get your cheap butts...
- Out!

521
00:36:51,707 --> 00:36:51,946
- Get your cheap butts...
- Out!

522
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:03,155
That was...

523
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:04,559
I know.

524
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:08,033
Awesome! Can we go again?

525
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,331
We're definitely not in Florida.

526
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:13,866
I think we're in Olympus.

527
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:17,810
Hail to you, great Zeus!
Forgive our trespass on Olympus.

528
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,642
We're seeking transport to Florida.

529
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:22,416
Zeus?

530
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,051
Zeus?

531
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:25,586
Zeus?

532
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:28,782
Whoa, stop it, stop it, stop it!
This isn't Olympus, okay?

533
00:37:28,878 --> 00:37:30,518
This is the Capitol building.

534
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:33,425
We're in Washington, D.C. Okay?

535
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:36,824
It looks like Olympus.

536
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:39,835
Right down to the dudes with power
who only care about themselves.

537
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:41,801
We need to find a bus station.

538
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:43,895
First we need to get some money.

539
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:51,546
<i>Hey, there,
valued half-blood account holder!</i>

540
00:37:51,634 --> 00:37:54,641
<i>Sign up for our new Aphrodite Express
credit card, and you can--</i>

541
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:58,780
Can I get four
venti half-caf no-whip lattes?

542
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:01,720
And an extra shot of nectar.

543
00:38:08,017 --> 00:38:08,996
Nectar?

544
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:11,898
If you haven't had,
then you haven't lived, buddy.

545
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,935
Hecatonshire.

546
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,109
Hey.

547
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:24,373
I see you got your hands full.

548
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,445
Room for cream?

549
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:31,646
Nectar. Double shot.

550
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,756
I've lived.

551
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:45,033
This might be the most fun
I've ever had.

552
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:46,361
Ever.

553
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:50,098
Yeah, anything's gotta be better
than living in the woods, right?

554
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,776
Living in the woods would have been fine
if you were there.

555
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,004
Everything's better with a brother.

556
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,610
You know, technically,
we don't have the same mom.

557
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:02,278
So we're still brothers!
I know! How cool is that?

558
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,851
Arctic.

559
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:06,953
It's too sweet, don't you think?

560
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,357
No, nectar's never too sweet.

561
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,432
Get off me!

562
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,697
- Get off me!
- Grover!

563
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:29,968
Percy!

564
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,011
- Damn!
- Was that Chris Rodriguez?

565
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,949
How did they do that?

566
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:42,021
Back at camp, Luke said that
there were other half-bloods who turned.

567
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,890
What do you mean, "turned"?

568
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,088
To his side.

569
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,295
Luke has Grover.

570
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,196
The Oracle was right.

571
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,671
Luke is going after the Fleece.
That's why he needs a satyr.

572
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,800
But what does Luke want
with the Fleece anyway?

573
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:58,966
I don't know.

574
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,238
But if we're gonna get Grover back,
we need to find Luke.

575
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,245
But we don't know where he is.

576
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,349
I know someone who does. Come on.

577
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:20,789
What, are we shipping ourselves
overnight express to the Sea of Monsters?

578
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,028
You want to find Luke?
His dad will know where he is.

579
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,705
Olympic Parcel Service. Come on.

580
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,243
Like it? He'll love it.

581
00:40:35,334 --> 00:40:39,012
Yes, Hephaestus does do quality work.
Everyone else these days, hacks.

582
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,812
Excuse me, we're looking for Hermes.

583
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,855
I'm sorry to be the god of obviousness,
but I'm with a customer.

584
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,587
You want an overnight shipment to Hades,
that will be 250 drachmas.

585
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:50,252
Perfect. Thank you, sweetness.

586
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:53,797
I will take care of that for you,
and I'll see you next week.

587
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:55,895
Now, you.

588
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:57,659
You are here about Hermes?

589
00:40:57,756 --> 00:40:59,635
His son, actually.
It's kind of important.

590
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,537
Yeah, I could tell the way you
burst in here, all rude-like.

591
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,701
His son's name is Luke Castellan.

592
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:11,274
What has that wayward boy of mine
gotten himself into now?

593
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:13,615
Wait, you're...

594
00:41:13,706 --> 00:41:14,708
Hermes.

595
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:17,116
Little insulted
you didn't recognize me.

596
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:20,524
My feelings might have even been hurt if I
wasn't such a self-confident individual.

597
00:41:20,613 --> 00:41:22,652
I don't know if you noticed,
but I'm killing these shorts.

598
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:23,819
Sir, we're looking for Luke...

599
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:26,057
because he attacked Camp Half-Blood
and kidnapped our friend.

600
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,896
And we really need your help,
and we don't have a lot of time.

601
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:32,200
That's really cute,
how you finish each other's sentences.

602
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:34,530
Follow.

603
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:39,439
You like this tie? I just bought it.
Hermés, of course.

604
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,036
Check it out.

605
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:43,707
State-of-the-art sorting,
processing and packaging facility.

606
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:46,548
If you can box it, we can ship it
at the speed of...

607
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,211
Well, me.

608
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:51,482
We have plans to expand next year.
We're finding we have some space issues.

609
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:53,354
So picture this, only bigger.

610
00:41:53,446 --> 00:41:54,551
Don't touch that.

611
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,720
We're the fastest-growing
Olympian industry.

612
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:59,425
It took a while to get up and running,
but Rome wasn't built in a day.

613
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:00,827
Trust me, I was there.

614
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,233
Excuse me, sir,
we're in a bit of a hurry.

615
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:05,066
Relax, my friend. Take it slow.

616
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:07,436
Come on! Give me a break!

617
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:10,303
Easy for you to say, Your Eminence.

618
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:14,346
Actually, Martha, it's not easy for him.
He's the god of freaking speed.

619
00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:19,013
Except he's not the one whose butt
is stuck to a big silver stick forever!

620
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:21,688
Hey, guys, what did <i>I</i> say?

621
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:25,052
When we meet new people,
protract your S's. it's more dramatic.

622
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:26,590
Makes an impression.

623
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:29,787
I'm personally insulted.
Snakes don't talk like that.

624
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,161
It is a stereotype and it's offensive.

625
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:34,598
Bad enough some of our relatives
are hanging out with Medusa...

626
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:35,861
turning people to stone.

627
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:36,935
All right.

628
00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:39,232
I love your hair.
I wish my hair would do that.

629
00:42:39,325 --> 00:42:40,533
Yeah, that will happen.

630
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:43,041
Why don't you guys
make yourselves useful?

631
00:42:43,129 --> 00:42:45,408
Demi-Google Luke for me.
These kids are looking for him.

632
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:47,241
- Why?
- Do they have a death wish?

633
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,042
It doesn't matter. Just...

634
00:42:49,168 --> 00:42:50,273
Didn't even say "please."

635
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:52,683
Told you! We should have taken
that job with Hercules.

636
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:54,516
They're an acquired taste.

637
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:56,918
Luke. I don't know what to do about him.

638
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:00,119
I've tried reaching out, but 
the kid's angry. He's resentful.

639
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:01,922
And he holds a grudge
like nobody's business.

640
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,519
Just like his mother,
come to think of it.

641
00:43:03,617 --> 00:43:05,462
Yeah, he's not my biggest fan either.

642
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:09,436
If you're gonna cross paths or,
Zeus forbid, swords with him...

643
00:43:09,623 --> 00:43:13,541
it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world
to have a thing or two to help you out.

644
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:15,631
Collector's item, mint condition.

645
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:18,212
<i>From Hercules Busts Heads, Season One.</i>

646
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,879
<i>Hercules Busts Heads?</i>

647
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:21,445
Best TV show ever.

648
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:24,518
So, of course, cancelled.

649
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:27,018
Got this off Deity-Bay.

650
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:30,283
You twist the cap off this, you release the
winds from the four corners of the Earth.

651
00:43:30,377 --> 00:43:32,518
Now, you tell me that isn't cool.

652
00:43:32,713 --> 00:43:34,285
Whoa! No, not in here!

653
00:43:34,982 --> 00:43:36,018
Not in here.

654
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:39,499
By the gods, George was right.
You do have a death wish.

655
00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:41,801
Now, you're also...

656
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:45,432
You're also gonna want one of these.

657
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:52,575
Thanks.

658
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:54,680
Mythical box sealer?

659
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:57,580
You wound me. Truly, I am wounded.

660
00:43:57,772 --> 00:44:01,018
I hold in my hands a Matter Eliminator.
Trademark pending.

661
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,848
Anything you outline with this...

662
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,082
Not in here.

663
00:44:04,545 --> 00:44:05,889
...will disappear.

664
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:07,959
Gone. Instant hole.

665
00:44:08,049 --> 00:44:09,325
"Demi-Google Luke," he said.

666
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:11,490
Except, how am I supposed to
type without fingers?

667
00:44:11,586 --> 00:44:13,123
You were supposed to use the mouse!

668
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,633
I'm a snake. I eat mice.

669
00:44:14,722 --> 00:44:16,533
All right, thank you.
Have you found Luke?

670
00:44:16,624 --> 00:44:17,831
Did he just say "thank you"?

671
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:19,497
I'm sure it was just a lapse.

672
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,200
Luke's on a yacht called the Andromeda.

673
00:44:21,296 --> 00:44:23,710
It's passing by Chesapeake Beach
as we speak.

674
00:44:23,798 --> 00:44:24,800
Thank you.

675
00:44:24,899 --> 00:44:26,642
You're so welcome.

676
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:28,079
There, you happy?

677
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:29,715
Hush.

678
00:44:30,905 --> 00:44:32,318
Thank you very much.

679
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:33,887
Hey, listen...

680
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:38,283
If you see Luke...

681
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,726
please explain to him for me...

682
00:44:42,784 --> 00:44:46,065
that parents,
we make mistakes sometimes.

683
00:44:46,454 --> 00:44:49,301
He has every right to be angry at me.

684
00:44:49,491 --> 00:44:51,974
Just, please tell him
not to be angry with the world.

685
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:56,103
I'm not sure if there's anything
that I can say that will change him.

686
00:44:56,298 --> 00:44:57,539
Tl"!-

687
00:44:58,166 --> 00:45:00,148
If it's one thing I've learned
in 3000 years...

688
00:45:00,235 --> 00:45:02,582
it's you can't give up on family.

689
00:45:09,845 --> 00:45:11,382
Thanks again.

690
00:45:13,248 --> 00:45:14,786
He'll never make it.

691
00:45:15,684 --> 00:45:16,789
That's lunch!

692
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:28,170
That's it. That's Luke's yacht.

693
00:45:28,364 --> 00:45:29,935
What do we do? Swim?

694
00:45:30,132 --> 00:45:31,613
But it's water.

695
00:45:32,801 --> 00:45:34,282
Dad will help.

696
00:45:38,307 --> 00:45:39,286
Hey, Dad.

697
00:45:39,475 --> 00:45:42,618
We're trying to save Camp Half-Blood
and rescue a satyr named Grover.

698
00:45:42,711 --> 00:45:46,253
And we could really use your help
getting to that ship out there.

699
00:45:47,783 --> 00:45:48,991
Poseidon?

700
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:50,664
Dad?

701
00:45:50,987 --> 00:45:52,365
It was a nice try, big guy...

702
00:45:52,455 --> 00:45:55,268
but don't be upset when he doesn't...

703
00:46:01,865 --> 00:46:03,368
...answer.

704
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:11,918
It's a hippocampus.

705
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,427
Hi, girl.

706
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,530
Boy-

707
00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:33,070
Come here.

708
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:40,109
Sometimes, you just gotta ask.

709
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,218
All I've been doing is asking.

710
00:46:58,755 --> 00:47:00,031
Are you coming?

711
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:01,969
Yeah.

712
00:47:05,662 --> 00:47:06,937
Are you ready?

713
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,269
Yeah.

714
00:47:08,465 --> 00:47:09,706
Giddy up!

715
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:17,506
Back up!

716
00:48:18,136 --> 00:48:19,275
Back up.

717
00:48:29,747 --> 00:48:31,194
Thank you, friend.

718
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:32,757
Tyson.

719
00:48:33,184 --> 00:48:34,995
Come on, buddy. We gotta go.

720
00:48:39,725 --> 00:48:41,171
You want some sugar?

721
00:48:51,202 --> 00:48:52,649
- Have you seen it?
- No, man.

722
00:48:52,738 --> 00:48:53,717
Did he show it to you?

723
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,012
Wait until you see it.

724
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:57,247
It took him long enough to find it.

725
00:48:59,745 --> 00:49:02,661
<i>That's Chris Rodriguez, Ethan Nakamura,
and Shana Beauregard.</i>

726
00:49:02,748 --> 00:49:04,353
Luke's been recruiting.

727
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:09,130
This is a nice boat.

728
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,199
How are we gonna find Grover?

729
00:49:11,957 --> 00:49:15,134
Luke is probably keeping him
below deck somewhere.

730
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,671
Like, in a brig.

731
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:19,141
I don't think yachts have brigs, Percy.

732
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,078
Follow me.

733
00:49:26,772 --> 00:49:29,654
Be careful, you guys.
He said keep your distance.

734
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,818
How much longer are we gonna
be on this boat, anyway?

735
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:34,824
Doesn't matter, just watch it.

736
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:47,495
It's so time to go.

737
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,967
Hey. Percy. Percy!

738
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,242
Tyson, do you have to
make so much noise?

739
00:49:56,335 --> 00:49:57,644
Sorry!

740
00:50:14,253 --> 00:50:15,232
Chris?

741
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:16,461
Hey.

742
00:50:16,823 --> 00:50:18,771
What have you done with Grover?

743
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,701
Grover?

744
00:50:21,193 --> 00:50:23,334
Grover's the least of your worries.

745
00:50:25,131 --> 00:50:26,476
<i>Guess who's here.</i>

746
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:39,118
What a surprise.
If it isn't my two favorite cousins.

747
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:40,485
Three.

748
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,457
I'm a son of Poseidon, too.

749
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:46,930
That's funny, because Poseidon
doesn't have any other half-blood sons.

750
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:48,795
I'm a Cyclops.

751
00:50:51,391 --> 00:50:52,462
Mist.

752
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,299
You don't say.

753
00:50:58,231 --> 00:51:00,008
It's been a long time.

754
00:51:01,668 --> 00:51:03,547
You look good.

755
00:51:05,072 --> 00:51:06,416
Where's Grover?

756
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:08,383
Grover, Grover.

757
00:51:08,575 --> 00:51:10,819
Grover, yes.
Right, the satyr.

758
00:51:11,011 --> 00:51:13,516
He should be in the Sea of Monsters
right about now.

759
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:17,190
I sent him on ahead with some friends.
We're kind of on the clock.

760
00:51:17,851 --> 00:51:19,263
Wait, you're not...

761
00:51:19,753 --> 00:51:22,635
You're not just trying to stop us
from getting the Fleece.

762
00:51:22,723 --> 00:51:24,169
I need it, too.

763
00:51:25,726 --> 00:51:28,539
I got something
only the Fleece can revive.

764
00:51:28,729 --> 00:51:30,608
And it's not a tree.

765
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:34,042
Wanna see it?

766
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:40,684
It wasn't easy to find.

767
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:44,184
I had to crawl through
the depths of Tartarus itself.

768
00:51:45,078 --> 00:51:47,117
And then Cleveland.

769
00:51:47,948 --> 00:51:50,227
The remains of Kronos.

770
00:51:50,418 --> 00:51:53,425
The original Titan,
father to the Olympians.

771
00:51:53,621 --> 00:51:57,198
And with the Fleece's help,
destroyer of Olympus.

772
00:51:57,391 --> 00:51:58,871
And the world.

773
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:03,206
You'd destroy the whole world
just to get back at your dad?

774
00:52:03,697 --> 00:52:06,237
The Olympians overthrew their parents.

775
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:08,373
It's just our turn.

776
00:52:08,702 --> 00:52:10,149
We met your father.

777
00:52:10,504 --> 00:52:13,420
He said that he knows
that he made mistakes.

778
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:16,250
He told us to tell you
to not be so angry.

779
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:17,623
Really?

780
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,824
And he couldn't even tell me himself.

781
00:52:22,483 --> 00:52:24,192
Does that sound familiar?

782
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:27,358
Take them to the brig.

783
00:52:27,455 --> 00:52:28,765
Let's go. Come on.

784
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:32,000
Thalia was your friend!
She sacrificed herself for you.

785
00:52:32,794 --> 00:52:37,110
You're gonna lecture me about Thalia
when you're hanging around with him?

786
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:40,979
You disappoint me the most.

787
00:53:15,703 --> 00:53:18,846
I told you he had a brig.

788
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:25,757
How can you trust him?

789
00:53:25,847 --> 00:53:27,487
He was probably making all that noise
on purpose.

790
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:29,359
He wanted Luke to catch us.

791
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:31,829
What do you have against Tyson anyway?

792
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,525
He's a Cyclops.

793
00:53:33,722 --> 00:53:36,604
I think the politically correct term
is "ocularly impaired."

794
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:39,470
Who cares?
They're vicious and they're dangerous.

795
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:47,681
Yeah, vicious.

796
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,672
We have to get out of here.

797
00:54:09,859 --> 00:54:11,271
How?

798
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,282
Just hang on to something.

799
00:54:50,299 --> 00:54:52,076
All right, here we go.

800
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:57,747
Come on, come on, come on!

801
00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:09,128
What's going on?

802
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,369
Percy's trying to kill us.

803
00:55:18,562 --> 00:55:20,065
I think it's working.

804
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:33,246
You got it?

805
00:55:33,443 --> 00:55:35,447
Piece of cake.

806
00:55:35,646 --> 00:55:37,650
I think I'm gonna vomit.

807
00:55:38,282 --> 00:55:39,261
Yep.

808
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:42,899
So, how does this work?

809
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:46,731
I don't know.
It's my first mythical tape gun.

810
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,983
Just like Hermes said...

811
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:10,055
"instant hole."

812
00:56:40,111 --> 00:56:41,615
Go to the lifeboat.

813
00:56:51,856 --> 00:56:53,565
Kill the engines.

814
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:01,078
That was for Grover.

815
00:57:11,642 --> 00:57:13,123
Grab him!

816
00:57:36,802 --> 00:57:38,146
We got him!

817
00:57:46,712 --> 00:57:48,158
What are you doing?

818
00:57:48,747 --> 00:57:50,318
Don't walk on my roof.

819
00:57:56,154 --> 00:57:57,794
Join me, Percy.

820
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:01,668
It's what you were meant to do.
You can't escape that prophecy.

821
00:58:02,595 --> 00:58:04,577
Let's show both of our fathers.

822
00:58:05,163 --> 00:58:06,576
It's tempting.

823
00:58:11,103 --> 00:58:13,552
That's genius. Really.

824
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:15,844
But I think I'll pass.

825
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:34,197
Not this again.

826
00:58:36,662 --> 00:58:37,641
Go!

827
00:58:37,729 --> 00:58:40,235
- Are you staying?
- I'll be right behind you.

828
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,780
May as well.

829
00:59:20,507 --> 00:59:21,919
Jackson, enough.

830
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:28,722
You're on the losing side.

831
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:31,124
Not from where I stand.

832
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,672
Smart.

833
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,615
Goddess of wisdom's daughter, remember?

834
00:59:54,474 --> 00:59:56,080
I remember.

835
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:08,202
Our allies and the satyr still have
a head start on the Fleece.

836
01:00:09,824 --> 01:00:12,204
We will resurrect you, Lord Kronos.

837
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,999
You will know vengeance.

838
01:00:16,296 --> 01:00:19,770
And the Olympians who scorned us
will know death.

839
01:00:38,919 --> 01:00:41,334
Maybe you should reapply.

840
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,033
It wore off?

841
01:00:46,594 --> 01:00:47,573
Yeah.

842
01:01:00,841 --> 01:01:02,049
Come on.

843
01:01:03,878 --> 01:01:05,154
Oh, no.

844
01:01:10,886 --> 01:01:11,888
Hey.

845
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:14,827
Do you want to steer for a while?

846
01:01:17,058 --> 01:01:18,367
Thank you.

847
01:01:19,828 --> 01:01:22,333
Nobody's ever trusted me
with anything before.

848
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:25,414
Is that because of
your lack of depth perception?

849
01:01:26,802 --> 01:01:28,977
Is it because they're scared of you?

850
01:01:32,974 --> 01:01:35,081
I was in the mountains one day...

851
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:40,821
and some campers,
Boy Scouts, showed up.

852
01:01:43,585 --> 01:01:47,229
And when they saw me, they screamed.

853
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,270
They ran.

854
01:01:51,993 --> 01:01:54,306
And I'm pretty sure I smiled.

855
01:01:57,098 --> 01:01:59,980
People look at me,
and they see a monster.

856
01:02:00,702 --> 01:02:03,048
Sometimes, I think maybe they're right.

857
01:02:05,674 --> 01:02:09,319
You're not a monster.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

858
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:13,261
Easy for you to say.

859
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:14,758
What do you mean?

860
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:18,199
You never doubt yourself
or think you're less than you are.

861
01:02:22,191 --> 01:02:24,298
Thank you, brother.

862
01:02:24,826 --> 01:02:27,537
Come here. Open it slowly.

863
01:02:27,729 --> 01:02:28,937
Slowly.

864
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,775
Hey, just take it slow. Slow, okay?

865
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,892
I wouldn't have trusted him
with a normal thermos.

866
01:02:44,346 --> 01:02:46,294
He seems okay.

867
01:02:46,481 --> 01:02:49,260
I really don't get
what your problem with him is.

868
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:54,630
Because you don't know
what I know about them.

869
01:02:55,191 --> 01:02:56,296
Thalia!

870
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,178
A Cyclops killed her.

871
01:03:07,504 --> 01:03:09,816
His kind killed Thalia.

872
01:03:11,341 --> 01:03:12,821
I'm sorry.

873
01:03:14,244 --> 01:03:15,724
I never knew.

874
01:03:15,912 --> 01:03:18,486
Well, it's not something
I like talking about.

875
01:03:19,616 --> 01:03:22,225
And anyway, it was a long time ago.

876
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:33,406
What is that?

877
01:03:34,597 --> 01:03:36,340
It's the Sea of Monsters.

878
01:03:42,772 --> 01:03:44,344
Why are we stopping?

879
01:03:47,978 --> 01:03:49,857
I should have used two hands.

880
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:51,291
You think?

881
01:03:52,315 --> 01:03:53,624
Are you mad at me?

882
01:03:53,717 --> 01:03:55,629
No, not at you.

883
01:04:12,836 --> 01:04:14,647
Tell me those aren't sharks.

884
01:04:17,808 --> 01:04:19,483
Those aren't sharks.

885
01:04:20,411 --> 01:04:22,552
Paddle! Paddle!

886
01:04:27,651 --> 01:04:29,530
Yeah, sharks would be better.

887
01:04:44,102 --> 01:04:45,912
It's Charybdis.

888
01:04:46,104 --> 01:04:47,379
Charyb-... What?

889
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:49,453
She guards the Sea of Monsters.

890
01:04:55,346 --> 01:04:56,485
Percy!

891
01:05:03,955 --> 01:05:05,492
It's not working!

892
01:05:06,457 --> 01:05:09,464
The Sea of Monsters
might not be in Poseidon's domain.

893
01:05:13,031 --> 01:05:14,010
Hold on!

894
01:05:53,272 --> 01:05:54,809
Where are we?

895
01:05:57,109 --> 01:05:58,783
Smells like the stomach.

896
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:11,100
Watch your step.

897
01:06:17,262 --> 01:06:18,902
What is this stuff?

898
01:06:19,698 --> 01:06:21,680
I don't think you want to know.

899
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,083
This has to be the worst way to die, ever.

900
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:29,017
Yeah, everything that disappears
in the Bermuda Triangle...

901
01:06:29,207 --> 01:06:31,280
this is where they end up.

902
01:06:32,144 --> 01:06:33,625
Come on!

903
01:06:34,614 --> 01:06:36,060
That sounded like Clarissa.

904
01:06:36,148 --> 01:06:37,925
No, it couldn't be her.

905
01:06:38,117 --> 01:06:40,896
You ridiculously stupid morons.

906
01:06:41,086 --> 01:06:42,965
- No, it's her.
-It's her.

907
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,539
You idiot!

908
01:06:48,628 --> 01:06:51,908
Better keep my electric grid up and
running, or I'll plug your head into it!

909
01:06:51,997 --> 01:06:53,910
Clarissa! Hey!

910
01:06:56,736 --> 01:06:59,777
Jackson? What are you doing here?

911
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:02,079
We got swallowed up, just like you.

912
01:07:02,275 --> 01:07:03,346
Nice ship.

913
01:07:03,443 --> 01:07:06,552
My dad's got tons of this stuff
left over from wars throughout history.

914
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:11,122
It was either this or a Huey from Vietnam.
I figured a boat would be more practical.

915
01:07:13,686 --> 01:07:14,995
What's going on?

916
01:07:15,088 --> 01:07:18,538
Pretty much exactly what you think
goes on inside of a stomach.

917
01:07:31,771 --> 01:07:33,116
You're right.

918
01:07:33,306 --> 01:07:35,219
That really is the worst way to die.

919
01:07:35,308 --> 01:07:36,310
Reardon!

920
01:07:36,409 --> 01:07:38,892
What in Hades is going on with my engine?
Is it ready yet?

921
01:07:38,979 --> 01:07:41,861
Almost, ma'am. They're working on it.

922
01:07:42,048 --> 01:07:44,656
Wait, your crew is zombies?

923
01:07:47,187 --> 01:07:48,896
They prefer "dead Confederate sailors

924
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:50,937
whose lives have been given
in tribute to Ares."

925
01:07:51,024 --> 01:07:53,472
But "zombies" is fine.

926
01:08:08,307 --> 01:08:10,847
Reardon! Gun! Faster! Now!

927
01:08:11,044 --> 01:08:12,992
Gun is hot, Cap'n. Locked and loaded.

928
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:15,061
Aim it at that meat grinder.

929
01:08:15,248 --> 01:08:17,492
Wait, wait.
You want to shoot that thing with this?

930
01:08:17,584 --> 01:08:20,727
Do you have a better idea?
Because now would be the time.

931
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,500
Hey, Clarissa.

932
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,296
What?

933
01:08:27,494 --> 01:08:28,735
Can you steer the ship?

934
01:08:28,829 --> 01:08:31,642
No. I just finished driver's ed.
Yes, of course, I can steer a ship.

935
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,145
Well...

936
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,104
why don't we give her a stomach ache?

937
01:08:35,202 --> 01:08:37,081
We'll escape through the gut.

938
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:39,619
It just might work
if it doesn't kill us first.

939
01:08:39,706 --> 01:08:42,019
You steer, I'll shoot.

940
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,749
All hands below deck!

941
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:48,890
Good luck, Percy.

942
01:08:53,788 --> 01:08:56,236
All hands below deck.
This is not a drill!

943
01:08:56,356 --> 01:08:58,338
Come on, boys. Get in there.

944
01:09:02,629 --> 01:09:04,235
This is still my quest.

945
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,675
Do not screw this up for me, Jackson.

946
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,233
You should watch what you eat.

947
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:45,218
Go!

948
01:09:45,407 --> 01:09:46,978
No kidding, genius.

949
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:00,965
I hope this works.

950
01:10:03,191 --> 01:10:05,571
- Just don't forget.
- Forget what?

951
01:10:08,097 --> 01:10:10,101
This is all your idea.

952
01:10:25,113 --> 01:10:26,491
Come on, come on.

953
01:10:39,294 --> 01:10:41,470
- We did it!
- I did it!

954
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:45,172
Listen up. Full power to the screws.

955
01:10:45,368 --> 01:10:46,712
Hey. are you guys all right?

956
01:10:46,802 --> 01:10:48,146
That was amazing.

957
01:10:52,242 --> 01:10:53,813
You have to have faith, right?

958
01:10:53,909 --> 01:10:56,392
And a cannon. We'll find Grover.

959
01:10:58,314 --> 01:10:59,726
Where is lchneutae?

960
01:10:59,815 --> 01:11:01,387
Now you miss lchneutae?

961
01:11:01,484 --> 01:11:04,525
We ran into Scylla,
that multi-headed Hydra thing.

962
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,326
He said, "I got this."

963
01:11:06,522 --> 01:11:07,968
Famous last words.

964
01:11:08,157 --> 01:11:10,196
We've restored full power, Cap'n.

965
01:11:10,593 --> 01:11:12,302
- Heading?
- Northwest.

966
01:11:20,169 --> 01:11:21,808
Are you sure about that?

967
01:11:21,905 --> 01:11:25,219
Yes, I'm sure about that.
Why, do you have a problem?

968
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:27,083
Yeah, you got a problem?

969
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:34,195
I think your Confederate warship
is heading to West Palm Beach, Florida.

970
01:11:35,451 --> 01:11:36,430
What is it?

971
01:11:36,519 --> 01:11:40,027
I know this sounds insane,
but it's kind of like my dyslexia.

972
01:11:40,223 --> 01:11:44,403
But instead of being able to read Greek,
I can see map lines.

973
01:11:44,761 --> 01:11:47,677
30. 31, 75,12.

974
01:11:49,099 --> 01:11:51,411
Wait, that's the numbers from the--

975
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:55,245
From the crazy, eyeless taxi drivers.

976
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:56,919
They're coordinates.

977
01:11:57,374 --> 01:11:58,820
Waterboy figured it out.

978
01:11:58,909 --> 01:12:00,048
And he called you crazy.

979
01:12:00,143 --> 01:12:01,317
Actually, he called you crazy.

980
01:12:01,411 --> 01:12:03,221
Hey, eye on the road.

981
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,853
30, 31 degrees north...

982
01:12:06,416 --> 01:12:08,523
75,12 degrees west.

983
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,167
That's where
Polyphemus and the Fleece are.

984
01:12:11,255 --> 01:12:13,601
Change course. Southwest.

985
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:15,135
AVE. aye.

986
01:12:15,492 --> 01:12:16,733
Sorry.

987
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,064
Land ho!

988
01:12:44,822 --> 01:12:47,464
Polyphemus lives in an amusement park?

989
01:12:47,657 --> 01:12:49,434
No, he lives on an island.

990
01:12:49,626 --> 01:12:51,107
But the goddess Circe thought building

991
01:12:51,195 --> 01:12:53,701
an amusement park on top of it
was a good idea.

992
01:12:53,798 --> 01:12:55,039
It really wasn't.

993
01:12:55,132 --> 01:12:56,373
What happened?

994
01:12:56,968 --> 01:12:58,209
Opening day...

995
01:12:58,302 --> 01:13:02,482
long lines of savory half-bloods
and one hungry Cyclops.

996
01:13:03,307 --> 01:13:04,686
Bad for business.

997
01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:07,253
I'll just turn us right around then.

998
01:13:07,344 --> 01:13:09,257
Find us a place to dock.

999
01:13:10,515 --> 01:13:12,690
I was afraid she was gonna say that.

1000
01:13:31,469 --> 01:13:34,453
I guess the Cyclops
was bad for business.

1001
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:35,846
Who knew?

1002
01:13:37,975 --> 01:13:40,857
We don't have time
to search this whole place.

1003
01:13:43,214 --> 01:13:44,888
I don't think we have to.

1004
01:13:47,318 --> 01:13:49,527
"Plummet of Death"?

1005
01:13:50,321 --> 01:13:51,801
That's subtle.

1006
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:55,597
It looks like something
really big went through there.

1007
01:13:56,828 --> 01:13:59,869
I don't know.
It doesn't really scream "Cyclops" to me.

1008
01:14:04,102 --> 01:14:05,947
At least there's no line.

1009
01:14:11,843 --> 01:14:13,414
Sweet ride.

1010
01:14:16,514 --> 01:14:17,893
Might need a push.

1011
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:26,293
Here we go.

1012
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:30,534
Tyson? Let go of my hand.

1013
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:31,868
Sorry.

1014
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:38,079
<i>It's a small world after all</i>

1015
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:41,720
<i>It's a small world after all</i>

1016
01:14:41,907 --> 01:14:44,254
Could you two just shut up?

1017
01:14:48,347 --> 01:14:49,326
Hold on!

1018
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,195
Is everybody okay?

1019
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:55,358
I thought that would be more fun.

1020
01:15:00,926 --> 01:15:03,637
I think I get what Grover
was so worried about.

1021
01:15:05,298 --> 01:15:07,610
This must be the boulder
Polyphemus used to trap Odysseus...

1022
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:10,240
when he was returning
from the Trojan War.

1023
01:15:10,837 --> 01:15:13,012
Yeah, that's right. I know stuff.

1024
01:15:28,988 --> 01:15:30,195
Grover!

1025
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:33,996
Enough!

1026
01:15:35,695 --> 01:15:37,802
I can't take this anymore.

1027
01:15:46,139 --> 01:15:47,552
It's been two days!

1028
01:15:47,641 --> 01:15:49,987
Calm your temper!
Calm your temper!

1029
01:15:50,843 --> 01:15:54,454
I haven't had a decent meal
since those half-bloods you brought!

1030
01:15:54,648 --> 01:15:57,393
And this stupid fleece
is supposed to lure satyrs!

1031
01:15:57,484 --> 01:15:59,591
Do you see any satyrs around here?

1032
01:16:00,987 --> 01:16:03,937
This hunger is making my eyesight worse.

1033
01:16:04,124 --> 01:16:05,832
I could just eat you.

1034
01:16:08,195 --> 01:16:10,939
If you weren't a Cyclops.

1035
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:14,145
Grover!

1036
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:16,447
Grover!

1037
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,041
- Hey!
- Come here!

1038
01:16:18,138 --> 01:16:19,117
Percy?

1039
01:16:21,674 --> 01:16:22,653
Hey!

1040
01:16:24,544 --> 01:16:26,287
Why are you wearing a dress?

1041
01:16:26,379 --> 01:16:28,657
I'm having a really bad day!

1042
01:16:28,849 --> 01:16:31,195
Hey, hey, hey!
Do not let that go viral!

1043
01:16:31,385 --> 01:16:33,800
Sorry, there's no way the other kids
would believe me otherwise.

1044
01:16:33,887 --> 01:16:35,299
This is a disguise.

1045
01:16:35,388 --> 01:16:37,962
The guy's half-blind.
He thinks I'm a Cyclops chambermaid.

1046
01:16:38,058 --> 01:16:39,595
I'm showing mad survival skills, here.

1047
01:16:39,694 --> 01:16:41,106
And not a small amount of leg.

1048
01:16:41,195 --> 01:16:42,174
Funny.

1049
01:16:42,262 --> 01:16:45,736
I was trying to stay uneaten long enough to
figure out how to get the Fleece off of him.

1050
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,211
So, did you?

1051
01:16:47,935 --> 01:16:50,315
Do you think I'd still be
dressed like this if I did?

1052
01:16:50,404 --> 01:16:52,044
It's a good look.

1053
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:53,241
Thanks, Tyson.

1054
01:16:55,109 --> 01:17:00,463
Clopsies, how about I cook you
something to drink...

1055
01:17:00,648 --> 01:17:02,527
to calm your nerves?

1056
01:17:04,585 --> 01:17:06,658
I don't know what to do anymore.

1057
01:17:07,488 --> 01:17:08,797
Go! Go!

1058
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:11,734
This fleece used to lure satyrs
every day.

1059
01:17:14,595 --> 01:17:18,342
Now things are so bad,
I even had to eat my own sheep.

1060
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:20,546
The whole flock!

1061
01:17:21,735 --> 01:17:23,444
They were tender, though.

1062
01:17:24,938 --> 01:17:27,979
Drop me, and I promise
you'll never hear the end of it.

1063
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:32,650
Do you smell something?

1064
01:17:33,014 --> 01:17:35,257
Smells like half-bloods!

1065
01:17:40,454 --> 01:17:41,456
Half-bloods!

1066
01:17:41,555 --> 01:17:43,332
- Get up, quick!
- I was right!

1067
01:17:43,424 --> 01:17:44,928
You stay right there!

1068
01:17:45,026 --> 01:17:46,700
Woman, get a fire going!

1069
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:48,170
That's not good!

1070
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:49,709
On second thought...

1071
01:17:50,431 --> 01:17:52,379
I'll just eat you raw!

1072
01:17:52,566 --> 01:17:53,545
Hey!

1073
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,251
Hiya!

1074
01:17:57,438 --> 01:17:59,317
My name's Tyson. How are you?

1075
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,518
These guys are my friends...

1076
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,655
so I was hoping, maybe, we could talk.

1077
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:06,125
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.

1078
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,227
You pissant with one eye!

1079
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:09,920
Hey! Not nice!

1080
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,895
You're no Cyclops!

1081
01:18:12,086 --> 01:18:14,398
You're a traitor to your kind!

1082
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:15,864
To be honest...

1083
01:18:17,058 --> 01:18:18,197
Huh? What?

1084
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,335
He's my kind.

1085
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:22,377
You disgust me.

1086
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,147
Going somewhere?

1087
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:36,285
I think you've got something of mine.

1088
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:38,452
Annabeth!

1089
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:45,060
Clarissa!

1090
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:58,642
Get back here, you punk!

1091
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,246
Yo, Clopsies!

1092
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:04,013
'Quit!

1093
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:07,182
Wait, you're a dude?

1094
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:09,085
Well, that explains a lot.

1095
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,927
-say goodbye.
.Okay. Goodbye!

1096
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:15,326
You deceitful little brats!
I'll tear off your flesh!

1097
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:17,925
Come on! Go, go!

1098
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:20,124
Give me that fleece!

1099
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:30,771
You're dead!

1100
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,609
I'm gonna kill all of you!

1101
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:34,813
Do you hear me?

1102
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,880
Get back here!

1103
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:47,595
We rocked that quest.

1104
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:49,323
Yeah, we totally did.

1105
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:51,762
I didn't know you guys had it in you!

1106
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:53,160
Yes.

1107
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:54,865
Well done.

1108
01:19:58,694 --> 01:20:01,041
It's nice work. I really appreciate it.

1109
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:04,075
I'll take that.

1110
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:09,249
I don't think so.

1111
01:20:10,941 --> 01:20:12,182
Suit yourself.

1112
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,034
You'd do it for me.

1113
01:20:32,596 --> 01:20:33,803
No!

1114
01:20:57,954 --> 01:20:59,936
Just remember...

1115
01:21:00,123 --> 01:21:02,127
it didn't have to end this way.

1116
01:21:03,494 --> 01:21:05,339
This one's on you.

1117
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:13,079
Down, boy!

1118
01:21:20,511 --> 01:21:22,754
You should consider yourselves lucky.

1119
01:21:23,347 --> 01:21:25,659
This has been millennia in the making.

1120
01:21:26,484 --> 01:21:28,261
And you all get to see it.

1121
01:21:28,887 --> 01:21:30,869
You used to be one of us!

1122
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:34,330
And then I woke up.

1123
01:21:38,996 --> 01:21:42,675
Percy, if Kronos comes back, that's it.
Game over.

1124
01:21:44,836 --> 01:21:46,111
Percy.

1125
01:21:47,672 --> 01:21:49,550
I never called him "brother."

1126
01:21:51,576 --> 01:21:53,990
All he ever wanted was a brother...

1127
01:21:55,313 --> 01:21:57,887
but I was too wrapped up in myself.

1128
01:21:59,818 --> 01:22:02,461
And now Luke has the Fleece...

1129
01:22:02,654 --> 01:22:04,795
because I gave it to him.

1130
01:22:06,491 --> 01:22:10,705
I destroy Olympus,
just like the Oracle said.

1131
01:22:12,730 --> 01:22:14,108
Forget the Oracle.

1132
01:22:15,767 --> 01:22:18,876
You're worried about your destiny?
Then write a new one.

1133
01:22:19,937 --> 01:22:23,946
You're angry at Poseidon for ignoring you?
Then show him why he shouldn't.

1134
01:22:24,476 --> 01:22:26,458
You're upset about Tyson?

1135
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,062
Then make sure
he didn't die for nothing.

1136
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:31,857
She's right.

1137
01:22:34,386 --> 01:22:35,525
What?

1138
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,431
There's no way
you're getting me to repeat that.

1139
01:22:39,959 --> 01:22:41,998
What Annabeth is saying, Perce...

1140
01:22:42,094 --> 01:22:44,372
is that we're with you.

1141
01:22:44,562 --> 01:22:46,271
Just give the word.

1142
01:22:46,664 --> 01:22:48,077
Why me?

1143
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:50,477
I mean, who voted me leader?

1144
01:23:04,249 --> 01:23:08,167
Lord Kronos,
he who was betrayed by his sons...

1145
01:23:08,353 --> 01:23:11,269
hear now the words
of one betrayed by his father.

1146
01:23:11,456 --> 01:23:14,065
I bid you... rise.

1147
01:23:52,798 --> 01:23:53,777
Grover!

1148
01:23:55,568 --> 01:23:56,547
Hands.

1149
01:23:57,037 --> 01:24:00,283
Try not to cut them off.
I'm pretty attached to them.

1150
01:24:19,693 --> 01:24:21,606
I have to get to the Fleece.

1151
01:24:21,795 --> 01:24:23,777
So, what are we supposed to do?

1152
01:24:25,732 --> 01:24:27,110
Right.

1153
01:24:55,695 --> 01:24:58,201
I know you can breathe under water,
Jackson.

1154
01:24:58,332 --> 01:25:00,245
But can you breathe like this?

1155
01:25:10,744 --> 01:25:11,883
Hi, Brother!

1156
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:26,495
What the--?

1157
01:25:26,593 --> 01:25:27,767
The water.

1158
01:25:29,296 --> 01:25:30,743
It healed me.

1159
01:25:32,867 --> 01:25:34,712
Son of Poseidon.

1160
01:25:39,607 --> 01:25:40,882
Thank you...

1161
01:25:42,577 --> 01:25:43,955
Brother.

1162
01:26:07,969 --> 01:26:09,279
He rises.

1163
01:26:26,621 --> 01:26:27,896
Master!

1164
01:26:28,089 --> 01:26:29,694
I brought you back!

1165
01:26:38,834 --> 01:26:40,610
My Lord!

1166
01:26:40,802 --> 01:26:41,873
It's Luke!

1167
01:26:42,437 --> 01:26:43,941
Luke Castellan!

1168
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:46,780
Your great-grandson!

1169
01:26:48,009 --> 01:26:49,614
My favorite.

1170
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:37,631
Grover!

1171
01:28:13,062 --> 01:28:14,941
It's the cursed blade!

1172
01:28:16,633 --> 01:28:18,512
"...cursed blade shall reap."

1173
01:28:45,728 --> 01:28:48,177
You want to know
who gave me this sword?

1174
01:28:49,266 --> 01:28:52,273
The god that killed you with it
in the first place!

1175
01:28:55,572 --> 01:28:56,916
My father.

1176
01:28:58,075 --> 01:28:59,612
Percy Jackson...

1177
01:28:59,809 --> 01:29:02,418
your destiny was written long ago.

1178
01:29:04,781 --> 01:29:05,853
No!

1179
01:29:09,086 --> 01:29:11,227
I make my own destiny.

1180
01:29:47,825 --> 01:29:48,998
Half-blood!

1181
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,341
Just in time for dinner.

1182
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:18,328
Thanks, Dad.

1183
01:30:20,959 --> 01:30:22,268
Percy.

1184
01:30:30,034 --> 01:30:31,378
Annabeth!

1185
01:30:34,906 --> 01:30:35,885
Grover!

1186
01:30:59,264 --> 01:31:00,404
Annabeth!

1187
01:31:03,234 --> 01:31:04,476
No, no!

1188
01:31:04,836 --> 01:31:07,479
At least I'll be with Thalia in Elysium.

1189
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:09,852
Come here. Give me the Fleece!

1190
01:31:10,108 --> 01:31:11,453
Come on! Come on.

1191
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:12,589
Come on.

1192
01:31:14,779 --> 01:31:18,697
We make our own destinies, right?
So show me.

1193
01:31:18,884 --> 01:31:20,365
I have faith in you.

1194
01:31:23,922 --> 01:31:26,769
No, no. Come on, show me.

1195
01:31:27,692 --> 01:31:28,933
Show me.

1196
01:31:30,596 --> 01:31:31,905
Come on.

1197
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,636
Annie.

1198
01:32:14,173 --> 01:32:15,483
What happened?

1199
01:32:16,275 --> 01:32:17,381
Don't worry about it.

1200
01:32:17,477 --> 01:32:19,891
If anyone else wants to die tonight...

1201
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:22,118
at least we have this.

1202
01:32:23,749 --> 01:32:26,129
Hey. You're alive.

1203
01:32:26,986 --> 01:32:28,399
Yeah.

1204
01:32:29,155 --> 01:32:31,468
What you did for Percy...

1205
01:32:33,025 --> 01:32:35,304
that was not so vicious and dangerous.

1206
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:39,111
Thanks.

1207
01:32:39,866 --> 01:32:40,845
No.

1208
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:42,776
Thank you.

1209
01:32:54,014 --> 01:32:54,993
You know what, Tyson?

1210
01:32:55,081 --> 01:32:57,757
I know a lot of campers with two eyes
who couldn't do what you did.

1211
01:32:57,851 --> 01:32:59,890
- Hey, Clarissa.
- What?

1212
01:33:00,087 --> 01:33:02,501
Come on, big guy.
We get back to camp, the nectar's on me.

1213
01:33:02,588 --> 01:33:04,263
Have you met the nymphs?

1214
01:33:04,992 --> 01:33:06,472
This was your quest.

1215
01:33:07,527 --> 01:33:11,138
I couldn't have done it without you.

1216
01:33:11,331 --> 01:33:13,540
I think you should
be the one who gets to...

1217
01:33:13,634 --> 01:33:15,308
...do the honors.

1218
01:33:31,652 --> 01:33:33,759
Here you go, Thalia.

1219
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:50,237
Clarissa! Clarissa! Clarissa!

1220
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:57,145
Nectar?

1221
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:00,176
If you haven't had...

1222
01:35:00,275 --> 01:35:01,778
...you haven't lived.

1223
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:08,223
You know what?

1224
01:35:09,617 --> 01:35:11,656
You don't need these anymore.

1225
01:35:13,288 --> 01:35:14,791
There, that's better.

1226
01:35:29,338 --> 01:35:30,613
<i>You seem happy.</i>

1227
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:34,852
I'm just relieved to have that whole
prophecy thing off my shoulders.

1228
01:35:35,043 --> 01:35:37,651
I'm not altogether sure it is, Percy.

1229
01:35:37,846 --> 01:35:41,923
You've done wonderfully, but you are
still the only living human child...

1230
01:35:42,117 --> 01:35:44,395
of Poseidon, Hades, or Zeus.

1231
01:35:44,586 --> 01:35:45,999
Besides...

1232
01:35:46,188 --> 01:35:48,466
it's quite possible
the Oracle wasn't referring

1233
01:35:48,558 --> 01:35:51,234
to what would unfold
on Polyphemus' island.

1234
01:35:51,426 --> 01:35:54,342
I'm just saying, a lot can happen
between now and your 20th birthday.

1235
01:35:54,429 --> 01:35:56,411
That's not really what I meant.

1236
01:35:56,532 --> 01:36:00,176
What I meant was
finding out you have a destiny...

1237
01:36:00,369 --> 01:36:03,946
is a lot like finding out you have
a half-brother who's a Cyclops.

1238
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,583
It might not be as bad as you think.

1239
01:36:19,522 --> 01:36:22,131
Percy! Percy!

1240
01:36:23,259 --> 01:36:24,568
Percy!

1241
01:36:24,927 --> 01:36:27,706
Annabeth was guarding the tree
last night...

1242
01:36:27,897 --> 01:36:29,503
and something happened.

1243
01:36:31,667 --> 01:36:32,738
Percy.

1244
01:36:33,369 --> 01:36:35,009
- The Fleece!
- What happened?

1245
01:36:35,105 --> 01:36:37,678
It was even more powerful
than we thought.

1246
01:36:57,393 --> 01:36:58,772
Come on, help her.

1247
01:37:00,596 --> 01:37:01,770
Who are you?

1248
01:37:02,766 --> 01:37:05,112
Percy.
Everything's all right, it's okay.

1249
01:37:05,534 --> 01:37:06,981
I had the strangest dream.

1250
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:08,049
Yeah?

1251
01:37:08,137 --> 01:37:10,016
Like I was dying.

1252
01:37:10,406 --> 01:37:11,751
What's your name?

1253
01:37:12,876 --> 01:37:16,019
I'm Thalia, daughter of Zeus.

1254
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:21,733
<i>Another living child of the eldest gods.</i>

1255
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:26,797
<i>Maybe it wasn't me.</i>

1256
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:29,803
<i>Maybe the Oracle meant Thalia all along.</i>

1257
01:37:31,261 --> 01:37:33,607
<i>Could she be our salvation?</i>

1258
01:37:33,997 --> 01:37:36,412
<i>Or the cause of our destruction?</i>

1259
01:37:37,997 --> 01:37:45,412
