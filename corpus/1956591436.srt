We're going home.

Hi.

00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:23,114
How's, uh... Sorry.

41
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:27,653
- How was school today?
- Mm.

42
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,858
Wanna get some ice cream?

43
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,962
No.

44
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:37,729
Thanks.

45
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,267
All right.

DREW: <i>Well, I watered them
every day.</i>

49
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:05,123
Or I would have,
if I didn't forget.

50
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,659
Those are new.
I put 'em in yesterday.

51
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,828
- (chuckles)
- LUCY: I missed you.

52
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:10,930
Yeah?

53
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,666
Babe, you went to space.

54
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,970
(SIGHS) I am so proud of you.

55
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:22,340
It was...

56
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,610
I don't know.

57
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:27,647
- It's hard to put into words.
- I bet.

58
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:29,849
To be up there...

59
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,695
(Drew snoring)

60
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,671
DREW: Hey, sleepyhead.

61
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:53,673
How's rocket lag?

62
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,442
What time is it?

63
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,912
Where's... where's Iris?

64
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:04,082
DREW: 8:30. I already put her
on the bus.

65
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,718
Hey, can you...

66
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:07,752
(Lucy sighs)

67
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,094
- I missed you.
- (Lucy chuckles)

68
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,831
- (Drew chuckles)
- LUCY: What?

69
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,706
Mission accomplished.

70
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,017
WILL: <i>And you're settling
back in?</i>

71
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:44,223
LUCY: <i>Never settle.
My nana taught me that.</i>

72
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:47,492
WILL:
How are you feeling physically?

73
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:49,328
LUCY: I'm in top shape, sir.

74
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:52,930
WILL: After just a few days
in micro-gravity

75
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:56,167
your bone and muscle mass
begins to shrink dramatically.

76
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,737
You were up ten days.

77
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:01,673
I've seen men
carried off the shuttle,

78
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:03,241
too weak to stand.

79
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,010
LUCY: Well...

80
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:11,950
All right.

81
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,653
Top of your class,
naval academy.

82
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:17,757
Valedictorian,
high school and college.

83
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,592
Can you stop?

84
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:22,127
Stop what?

85
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:24,963
- WILL: Working.
- I'm taking a few days.

86
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:27,867
My niece is staying with us.
Blue Iris.

87
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,468
WILL: Blue Iris?

88
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,336
It was his second choice,
actually. My brother.

89
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:35,740
His wife talked him out
of Sanctuary Rose.

90
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,910
Annabelle,
she was the practical one.

91
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,113
Change a light bulb.
Remember to eat.

92
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:43,549
She's dead now.

93
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,484
Anyway...

94
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,753
Iris is staying with us,

95
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,689
and we've been doing
girl things.

96
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:53,424
WILL: Didn't I see you here
on the track yesterday,

97
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:54,894
and in the gym this morning?

98
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,063
LUCY: Bone density.
Muscle mass.

99
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,097
WILL: Throw a Frisbee.
Fly a kite.

100
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:03,199
- (Lucy laughs)
- WILL: What?

101
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:06,037
Nana says
Frisbees are for dogs.

102
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,041
WILL: Tell me about her.

103
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:14,713
Three guys chased my dad home
from school one day

104
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,781
with axe handles

105
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:18,349
and she put the first
warning shot in the dirt.

106
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,886
- The first?
- Lucy: Well, in San Angelo

107
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,322
a leg shot's considered
a warning.

108
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,927
Why'd they chase him?

109
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:30,562
Your dad.

110
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,464
LUCY: He pissed
in their gas tank.

111
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:39,938
You know Michael Collins?

112
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:42,974
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
Apollo 11.

113
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,176
He flew the command module
for Neil and Buzz.

114
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,411
WILL: Yeah.

115
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:48,846
So you know that
after he dropped them...

116
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,483
he circled the moon for hours.

117
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,889
It's farther from Earth
than any man has ever been.

118
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:02,094
<i>No light, no radio.</i>

119
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:08,298
And he wept,
consumed by darkness

120
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:11,136
and then,
when he saw the sun again...

121
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,105
he wept some more.

122
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:18,010
Inside the module he wrote...

123
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,213
"I am now truly alone...

124
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:26,552
and absolutely alone
from any known life.

125
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,053
I am it."

126
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,468
I'm fine.

127
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:53,978

133
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,139
(door opens)

134

(door closes)

135
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:35,453
LUCY: There are better ways
to kill yourself

136
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,390
than smoking
with your oxygen machine.

137
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,093
How's that, fucker?

138
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,796
I'm back.

139
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:48,367
- Ooh. Did you go somewhere?
- Well, up, then down.

140
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,301
(chuckles)

141
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:53,338
You show those
Ivy League assholes

142
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,275
- how it's done?
- Damn straight.

143
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,982
(sighs) Your father
used to play golf.

144
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:06,218
Said it was good for business.

145
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,353
He was unemployed.

146
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,122
He was an idiot.

147
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:21,566
You here to make sure
I'm still breathing?

148
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,469
Drew said your disposal's out.

149
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:26,104
Oh.

150
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,505
That it is.

151
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:31,709
LUCY: <i>I'm supposed to be
on vacation.</i>

152
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,079
I've already color coded
three rooms in my house

153
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,015
and signed up
for neighborhood watch.

154
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,851
NANA: You should get a hobby,
like me.

155
00:13:40,218 --> 00:13:42,654
- (pouring liquid)
- LUCY: Drinking's not a hobby.

156
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:45,123
(chuckles) Well,
the government says

157
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,792
I'm too old
to do it professionally.

158
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:50,762
LUCY: Fixed.

159
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:55,334
NANA: They givin' you a medal?

160
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,803
NASA? For what?

161
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,804
All I did was my job.

162
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:03,708
Good girl.
No special treatment.

163
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,382
Sebastian dropped Iris on us
again while I was in space.

164
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:13,384
Can you believe that?

165
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:16,454
Did you leave her in the car?

166
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:18,188
She's in school.

167
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:22,260
He called me from the road,
your brother.

168
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:26,665
Something about
power tool races

169
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,533
in San Francisco.

170
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:31,668
You know what I told him?
"Get a job."

171
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,405
LUCY: Oh, he has a job.

172
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:35,406
He writes poetry.

173
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:40,179
When's your next mission?

174
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,248
Polaris goes in a few weeks.

175
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,849
Orion is in 13 months.
That's my shot.

176
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,554
NANA: Well, you're not getting
any younger.

177
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:53,659
So, you're just gonna
have to work harder.

178
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,838

181
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:26,257
Flush PKG, screen
and honeycomb. Check.

182

183
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:39,671
ERIN: Watch it.

184
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,882
Relax. You'll run faster.

185
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,584
Loose, you know?

186
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:55,921
No hurry. Just let it go.

187
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,458
Keep up the good work!

188
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,427

189
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,235
(indistinct chatter)

190
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,748
- JIM: Good morning.
- ALL: Good morning.

191
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,584
JIM: Mm. I said good morning.

192
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:28,353
- ALL: Good morning.
- JIM: There you go.

193
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,556
If you are in this room
and you are wearing blue

194
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:35,826
you are a candidate
for the next Orion mission.

195
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:40,431
Mission parameters are fluid...

196
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,767
but for now...

197
00:16:43,434 --> 00:16:45,671
let's plan on a two-week run.

198
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:49,440
We'll be installing
a starboard truss system

199
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:52,945
- and a solar array pair.
- I saw you on the track today.

200
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:55,946
ERIN: Mm-hmm.

201
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:57,815
LUCY: You need to keep
your head up.

202
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:02,921
JIM: Some of you
have taken this ride before.

203
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,890
Congratulations.

204
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:09,693
Now, the bad news.

205
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:11,496
If you wanna go again...

206
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:13,797
Thanks for the tip.

207
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,601
...you're gonna have to earn it.

208
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,237
And that's no joke.

209
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,472
Dismissed.

210
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:24,976
ERIN: You were
on the Destiny mission, right?

211
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:29,247
- I was. Tell me your name again?
- I'm Erin Eccles.

212
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:31,482
- I just came over from the SAIL.
- Wow.

213
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,853
So, do you have any pointers?
Other than keep my chin up.

214
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,388
Oh, that depends.
Are you a pilot?

215
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:38,555
I'm in robotics.

216
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,524
Well, scratch two seats
right there.

217
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:44,061
So, you want that seat
on Orion? You take it.

218
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:47,298
Just make sure to leave
one for me. All right?

219
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:48,899
Copy that.

220
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:53,971
(alarm blaring)

221
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:55,606
Still a lot of Christmas
up here.

222
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,809
- JIM OVER RADIO: <i>Copy, Orion.</i>
- O-two level's solid.

223
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:00,111
DFS restart indicated, Houston?

224
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,615
<i>Orion,</i> we confirm.
Hard restart.

225
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,650
O-two dropping. Venting fast.

226
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,051
- MARK: Eccles?
- Give me a second.

227
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:09,053
LUCY: We don't have
a second, rookie.

228
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,459

00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:24,702

DREW: Y'all done burning down
the subdivision?

236
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,113
We're almost eating here.

237
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:42,713
IRIS: More?

238
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:46,685
Whoo!

239
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,196
- You know, I was thinking.
- One more mission.

240
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,632
- What? I didn't say anything.
- One more mission.

241
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,632
Then we should have a baby.

242
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,170
That's what
you were gonna say, right?

243
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:15,046

No.

LUCY:
Mission accomplished, sir.

That's not what I asked.

266
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,154
Best two weeks of my life.

267
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:34,191
Boat ran like a clock.
Systems held up.

268
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,127
Crew were top-class.

269
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:39,631
So, you liked it?

I was just giving my ladies
a little tour here.

276
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,985
Chelsea, Emily,
this is Daddy's friend, Lucy.

277
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:03,520
Lucy was just in space
last week.

278
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:05,222
Maybe y'all have some questions
for her?

279
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:06,457
Um...

280
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:08,759
Where'd you get that brownie?

281
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:10,294
(Lucy chuckles)

282
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:13,031
Over there.
And they're very good.

283
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,004
Yeah, okay. Here. Go.

284
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:21,805
Don't tell your mother
I gave you that.

285
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:25,943
Separated. It's a lot of work.

286
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,912
Well, they seem like great kids.

287
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,046
They are.

288
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,381
Hey, you bowl?

289
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:32,315
- What?
- Bowling.

290
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:35,420
Indigenous cultural praxis
of the North Americas.

291
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:38,222

292

alcohol abuse,

295
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:47,198
No. The club.
You're a member now.

00:22:47,363 --> 00:22:49,133

- MARK: Hey.

297
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,168
Are y'all gonna roll tonight?

298
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:53,103
- Yeah.
- Uh, no.

299
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,337
- Yeah.
- For sure not.

300
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:55,439
- You're going.
- Won't be there.

301
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:57,007
We're going. She's going.

302
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:58,776
What club?

303
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:02,613
The most elite group
of people ever formed

304
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,681
in the history of mankind.
A secret society

305

has seen the face of God.

309
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,501
I'm not really a joiner.

It depends. You got any idea

It gets weird.

Yeah. Help us. Can you?

- KATE: No one knows.

372

They think the brain adjusts

It'll be gone in about a week.

No, not off. It's more...

And everything here looks...

386
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:17,535
so small.

387
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:20,470
We're so small.

388
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,943
And then you splashdown.
What? You go to Applebee's?

389
00:27:26,075 --> 00:27:29,613
You got Monday Night Football?
Clip your toenails?

390
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:33,550
And all you can think
about is...

391
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:36,186

00:27:45,729 --> 00:27:47,131
How could that possibly
have happened?

396

You laugh at his old jokes.

- DREW: Oh, hi.

527
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:06,910
This fucker says
I can't smoke in the house.

528
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,078
DREW: That's me.

529
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:10,781
Apparently, you invited
your grandmother to dinner.

530
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:14,151
Oh, shit. Yes, I did.

531
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:16,219

533
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:21,123
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

534
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,261
I'm going outside to smoke,
like a hobo.

535
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:27,964
Oh. Be a doll, will you?

536
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:30,033
I left 'em in my purse
in the hall.

545
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:21,584
So, what's the scoop?

546
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:24,554
No scoop.
Just school in the summer.

547
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:27,323
- Summer school.
- Hey, how was work today?

548
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,058

- NANA: Where's your dad?

549
00:40:30,192 --> 00:40:33,029
- IRIS: Who knows?
- NANA: I wish I could tell ya

550
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:34,497
that when he was a baby

551
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:37,267
I dropped him
on his head a lot, but...

552
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:41,238
fact is, some people
are just born lazy.

553
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:46,175
You keep your eye on this one.
She'll show you how it's done.

554
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:48,746
- You hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.

555
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,216

and, Lord, as we share it,

562
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,669
we ask that you stay with us
and be our guest of honor.

563

- Don't fall.
- LUCY: Oh, come on.

586
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,265
I've been up

- LUCY: I don't know.

589
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:37,547
Maybe.

590
00:43:39,582 --> 00:43:40,984
We forget...

591
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:42,986
this happens.

592
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,292
Every day, twice a day.

593
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:53,229
The planet, our planet,
goes around the Sun.

594
00:43:54,263 --> 00:43:55,464
Can you feel it?

595
00:43:56,265 --> 00:43:57,401
We're moving.

596
00:43:58,368 --> 00:43:59,502
It's all moving.

597
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:04,241
Giant objects in space,
millions of miles apart.

598
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,210
And we forget.

599
00:44:08,109 --> 00:44:10,012
I mean, how is that possible?

600
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:13,283
We get busy.

601
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,053
We forget to look up.

602
00:44:17,286 --> 00:44:19,455
When you're up there
on the station...

603
00:44:20,122 --> 00:44:22,524
the sun rises every 90 minutes.

604
00:44:23,225 --> 00:44:28,064
- This happens once an hour.
- (chuckles) God.

605
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,034
LUCY: Is that what it is?

606
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:33,537
I don't know.

607
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,212
You know why I pray?

608
00:44:46,281 --> 00:44:49,318
See, my wife straps herself
to a giant bomb...

609
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:51,353
so she can leave the planet

610
00:44:51,419 --> 00:44:53,122
and go to a place with no air
or water.

611
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:55,024
And I want her to come home.

612
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,328
- So, I pray.
- I'm home.

613
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:05,569
No, I don't think you are.

614
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:24,721
- Hi.
- Eight and a half minutes.

615
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,256
It's a new record.

616

(indistinct chattering)

617
00:45:46,975 --> 00:45:48,178
If they're west...

618
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,212
Cola, suit up.

619
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,692

JIM: Okay, people.
You know the drill.

623
00:47:03,352 --> 00:47:05,788
Safety first,
then fun, then learning.

698
00:53:02,044 --> 00:53:03,812
Some people are sleepers.

699
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:06,549
All they do is dream.

700
00:53:08,183 --> 00:53:10,285
He was always like this,
your dad.

701
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:13,122
Gettin' lost, forgetting things.

702
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:14,991
Me.

703
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:19,260
Nana would be at work,
and he'd be in charge...

704
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:21,864
but I'd be the one putting out
the toaster fire

705
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:24,634
and making sure that
he was brushin' his teeth.

706
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,504
I was nine. He was 15.

707
00:53:29,504 --> 00:53:31,773
They can do that, boys.

708
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,143
They make the mess.
We're the ones who clean it up.

709
00:53:35,243 --> 00:53:36,745
It's not fair.

710
00:53:37,879 --> 00:53:39,582
Oh, no. It's not.

711
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:42,651
But we can do...

712
00:53:43,986 --> 00:53:45,654
something they can't.

713
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:47,991
What?

714
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,427

Check out this footage.

717
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:43,879
She held her breath upside down
for over two minutes.

718
00:54:45,614 --> 00:54:47,417
Heart rate never went above
a 100.

719
00:54:47,616 --> 00:54:48,950
The whole time.

720
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:53,256
In fact, the longer it went,
the calmer she got.

721
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,626
And she finished the job.

722

724
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,808

729
00:56:33,388 --> 00:56:34,789
No. She's...

730
00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:37,225

I work for NASA PR.

00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:51,873

738
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:57,412
ERIN: I am actually
meeting someone.

739
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,348
Well, just until they get here.

740
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,284
Just a drink, come on.
We're family.

741
00:57:01,716 --> 00:57:04,753
- Okay. Okay.
- Great.

742
00:57:08,489 --> 00:57:10,459

745
00:57:14,863 --> 00:57:17,098
DREW: <i>Well, your personnel file

746
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:20,102

- Well, that's my job.

747
00:57:20,234 --> 00:57:21,870
If I don't know you,
I can't promote you.

748
00:57:21,937 --> 00:57:25,107
(chuckles) Um. Well, yeah.
My mom, she was a diplomat.

749
00:57:25,174 --> 00:57:27,343
And so we lived in New Delhi
for a few years.

750
00:57:27,776 --> 00:57:29,511
And then we lived in London.

751
00:57:29,578 --> 00:57:31,381
Then we moved to Germany
for high school.

752
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,784
(speaks German)

753
00:57:35,317 --> 00:57:36,852

DREW: Mm.

757
00:57:45,227 --> 00:57:47,195
And you went to MIT.

758
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:50,198
ERIN: Yeah. I...

759
00:57:50,832 --> 00:57:53,502
- Is this a job interview?
- (Drew chuckles)

760
00:57:54,268 --> 00:57:58,274
Um. Why don't you guys tell me
something about you?

761
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,908
How long have you been married?

762
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:03,379
Well, it'll be six years
next month.

763
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:05,980
I was in the navy.
I got recruited by NASA.

764
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,350
And then we met
in the cafeteria.

765
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:09,785
ERIN: Romantic.

766
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:11,486
Yeah. She helped me open
a bottle of ketchup.

767
00:58:11,752 --> 00:58:14,355
- I have weak hands.
- (Eric chuckles)

768
00:58:14,723 --> 00:58:16,257
ERIN: I had a boyfriend
in Boston,

769
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:19,127
but he was competitive. And...

770
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,163
I don't lose, so...

771
00:58:22,598 --> 00:58:24,400

for dinner and we saw Erin

777
00:58:37,546 --> 00:58:40,549
- and she's waiting for somebody.
- Yeah. Me, actually.

778
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,852
I figured I'd take the kid out,
give her some pointers.

779
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:45,921
Don't fly into the sun,

01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,245
Well, I'd love
to make it up to you.

863
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,014
Hey. Not here.

864
01:02:33,614 --> 01:02:35,017
We have been slippin'.

865
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:37,118
We need to be more careful.

866
01:02:37,886 --> 01:02:39,088
Okay.

867
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:41,390
Sorry.

868
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:44,694
(engine starts)

869
01:02:45,727 --> 01:02:47,395
It's fine. It's fine.

870
01:02:49,997 --> 01:02:51,566
We can go to my place.

871
01:03:10,618 --> 01:03:11,720
(Mark grunts)

872
01:03:13,087 --> 01:03:14,723
So, you're a mentor now.

873
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:17,159
- With Erin.
- Well, yeah. You know me.

874
01:03:17,225 --> 01:03:19,461
I like to give the kids
a head start.

875
01:03:20,995 --> 01:03:22,698
Oh, is that what we're doing?

876
01:03:28,002 --> 01:03:29,403
Well, I don't know.
I wouldn't exactly

877
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:30,673
call you a kid.

878
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:39,748
I got a little jealous.
Seeing you and her.

879
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:42,051
Did you now?

880
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:44,687
Well, how do you think I feel?

881
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:47,288
Watchin' you and...

882
01:03:49,024 --> 01:03:50,493
Mr. Perma-smile.

883
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,562
- Drew Cola, public relations.
- Don't do that.

884
01:03:53,661 --> 01:03:54,897
- All right. Okay.
- Don't.

885
01:03:55,497 --> 01:03:58,232
- Okay. Of course not.
- He's a better person...

886
01:03:58,632 --> 01:04:00,770
- MARK: What? Than me?
- Than both of us.

887
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,808
I'll drink to that.

888
01:04:10,879 --> 01:04:14,450
(thunder rumbling)

889
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:33,835
Well, today's the day.

890
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:36,238
No more booze
until after the mission.

891
01:04:37,071 --> 01:04:38,774
You wanna say goodbye together?

892
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:42,445
You fucking her?

893
01:04:47,482 --> 01:04:49,085
You gonna leave your husband?

894
01:04:55,756 --> 01:04:57,292
Do you want me to?

895
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:01,663
- Don't.
- What?

896
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:05,366
Don't trust it.

897
01:05:07,468 --> 01:05:09,871
That feeling. It's not real.

898
01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:12,842
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Sure.

899
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:17,411
But can you tell me one thing
that is different

900
01:05:17,678 --> 01:05:20,715
about the world because you
and I have a feeling?

901
01:05:22,116 --> 01:05:23,852
- Everything's different.
- Well, yeah.

902
01:05:24,051 --> 01:05:25,720
To you. In your head.

903
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:30,292
Sunrise at a different time?
Weather patterns shifted?

904
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:36,464
It's cortisol, oxytocin,
dopamine. It's a trick.

905
01:05:37,165 --> 01:05:39,268
It's like believing in God.

906
01:05:40,368 --> 01:05:42,270
What's happening right now?

907
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:46,408
You went to space...

908
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,110
and you saw the vast...

909
01:05:49,843 --> 01:05:54,916
celestial everything
and it blew your fucking mind.

910
01:05:56,951 --> 01:05:58,853
So now nothing
makes sense anymore.

911
01:06:01,022 --> 01:06:03,791
But good old brain...

912
01:06:04,225 --> 01:06:06,227
Well, brain doesn't know

913
01:06:06,326 --> 01:06:07,595
that you're having
an existential crisis.

914
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:09,832
Brain just knows
that when we fuck...

915
01:06:10,598 --> 01:06:11,901
it feels good.

916
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:14,569
So, you focus on that.

917
01:06:15,236 --> 01:06:16,538
That feeling.

918
01:06:18,172 --> 01:06:20,542
Because it seems real.

919
01:06:23,277 --> 01:06:24,846
Well, that's cold.

920
01:06:31,285 --> 01:06:33,555
All right, old boy.
I'll see you on the other side.

921
01:06:41,094 --> 01:06:43,631
Hey. Need me to drive you home?

922
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,602
No.

923
01:06:47,535 --> 01:06:49,571
I wanna feel the feeling.

924
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:11,727
(indistinct chatter)

925
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,576
(phone ringing)

926
01:07:38,053 --> 01:07:39,288
Lucy?

927
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:49,465
Hey.

928
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:51,400
Sorry.

929
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,368
DREW: I've been trying you
for hours.

930
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:56,739
I had a late night
putting in training modules.

931
01:07:58,239 --> 01:07:59,575
I'm home.

932
01:08:01,009 --> 01:08:02,177
Is Iris up?

933
01:08:02,743 --> 01:08:04,546
DREW: What time
do you think it is?

934
01:08:04,879 --> 01:08:06,113
She's fast asleep.

935
01:08:06,314 --> 01:08:07,382
- Listen.
- What?

936
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:09,951
Listen, work got a little harder
than I thought, and...

937
01:08:10,551 --> 01:08:12,754
it's been a rough
couple of weeks, you know.

938
01:08:12,921 --> 01:08:14,290
When I called the Center...

939
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:17,593
they said you left early.

940
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:24,499
Nana's in the hospital.

941
01:08:24,965 --> 01:08:26,334
What?

942
01:08:26,867 --> 01:08:27,801
What? How?

943
01:08:28,103 --> 01:08:29,971
She had a stroke. I've been
trying to call you for hours.

944
01:08:30,037 --> 01:08:32,906
- Wait... Can I see her?
- I'll take you in the morning.

945
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,542
- Is she okay?
- Visiting hours from ten.

946
01:08:35,609 --> 01:08:38,779
- I can take you over there.
- Just tell me she's okay.

947
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:40,382
Well, she hasn't woken up.

948
01:08:41,683 --> 01:08:43,752

You're not done here.

965
01:11:02,256 --> 01:11:04,125
There's still work to do.

966

Don't you quit on me.

967
01:11:09,663 --> 01:11:12,099

You don't have to say that.
You don't have to...

I'm not fine.
I'm not fine at all. There.

975
01:12:13,428 --> 01:12:15,697
That work for you?
That make it all better?

976
01:12:16,197 --> 01:12:17,900

- What?

977
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,002
What?

978
01:12:25,206 --> 01:12:26,908
The glove compartment
in your car was locked.

979
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:29,877
I didn't know why, so I got
the key and I unlocked it.

01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,446
How? Wait.

981
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:33,381
- You got the key?
- That's not the point. The point is

982
01:12:33,447 --> 01:12:35,517
you're driving around with a
loaded gun in your car, Lucy.

983
01:12:35,582 --> 01:12:36,917
So I need to know why?

984
01:12:37,218 --> 01:12:38,019
You're acting so strange.

What time you're coming home.

986
01:12:40,188 --> 01:12:42,156
- And now with your Nana in the hospital...
- You got the key

987
01:12:42,223 --> 01:12:43,925
- off my key ring?
- A gun in your car, Lucy.

988
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:45,827
- Why would you do that?
- For fuck's sake, Lucy!

989
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,529
Why is there a fucking gun
in your car?

990
01:12:47,595 --> 01:12:49,630
I had to put it someplace safe.

991
01:12:50,063 --> 01:12:50,897
It's Nana's.

992
01:12:51,064 --> 01:12:53,201
I found it in her purse
when she came to dinner.

993
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,636
And I didn't want her
walking around with it.

994
01:12:56,638 --> 01:13:00,007

- Why didn't you ask?

What'd you think I was doing?

01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,177
Just need a minute.

1035
01:15:51,545 --> 01:15:52,679
I know. It's all right.

1036
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,982
I loved her, too.
But she's in a better place.

1037
01:15:55,149 --> 01:15:57,417
- (Lucy breathes heavily)
- (Drew sighs)

1038
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:58,819
Why would God make something

1039
01:15:58,885 --> 01:16:01,956
that has to destroy itself
in order to fly?

1040
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:04,893
What?

1041
01:16:08,729 --> 01:16:10,065
I'm leaving.

1042
01:16:12,599 --> 01:16:15,136
I don't know when I'll be back.

1043
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:19,241
Or if I'll be back. Uh...

1044
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:22,377
I don't know anything anymore.

1045
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:32,420
(Drew breathes shakily)

1046
01:16:38,492 --> 01:16:39,560
What's up?

1047
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,031
I don't know.

1048
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:47,502
I don't know.

1049
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,710
Babe? You're upset.
It's been a big month.

1050
01:16:57,111 --> 01:16:59,080
- Now, why don't you come inside?
- Don't you get it?

1051
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:03,018
There's someone else.
I'm someone else.

1052
01:17:04,684 --> 01:17:07,022
- You coming?
- DREW: But...

1053
01:17:08,188 --> 01:17:09,923
LUCY: Liftoff in ten...
(sniffles)

1054
01:17:10,157 --> 01:17:15,529

six, five...

1055

1056
01:17:21,368 --> 01:17:24,238

1057
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:30,478
(rain pattering)

1058
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:05,679
(Lucy sighs)

1059
01:18:06,413 --> 01:18:09,416
You can take the bedroom.
I'll just...

1060
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:11,486
I can sleep out here...

1061
01:18:12,819 --> 01:18:15,223
or stay awake out here,
or whatever.

1062
01:18:19,626 --> 01:18:21,161
Are you getting divorced?

1063
01:18:21,962 --> 01:18:23,898
To create a reliable
probability matrix

1064
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:26,734
for the future requires
number of variables

1065
01:18:26,834 --> 01:18:28,736
that just aren't very clear
right now.

1066
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:32,439
- What?
- (sighs) I said I need a drink.

1067
01:18:33,007 --> 01:18:34,475
You go to bed.

1068
01:18:40,447 --> 01:18:41,982
So, is this what I get?

1069
01:18:43,617 --> 01:18:45,018
A dead mom. A shitty dad.

1070
01:18:45,553 --> 01:18:47,921
Look, I had a drunk mom
and a deadbeat dad.

1071
01:18:48,022 --> 01:18:49,524
And look where I ended up.

1072
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,163
I meant space.

1073
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:57,431
Just go to bed.

1074
01:19:11,412 --> 01:19:13,949

FRANK: Yeah. Have a seat.

1132
01:22:54,367 --> 01:22:57,237
I've been reviewing
the mission specs for Orion.

1133
01:22:59,306 --> 01:23:01,209
I'm so sorry
about your grandmother.

1134
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:05,346
It's not an issue, sir.
I won't miss any training.

1135
01:23:06,613 --> 01:23:09,517
Dr. Plimpton says you skipped
your last three sessions.

LUCY: That's, uh... (chuckles)
I'm fine, really. I just...

1137
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:15,456
I thought my time would be
better spent, you know...

1138
01:23:15,555 --> 01:23:18,024
Lucy. You had a helmet breach.

1139
01:23:18,425 --> 01:23:20,561
Your hat filled with water,
and you were without oxygen

1140
01:23:20,627 --> 01:23:21,662
for two minutes.

1141
01:23:22,196 --> 01:23:23,764
But I finished the job.

1142
01:23:24,264 --> 01:23:25,800
FRANK: That's not the...

1143
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:29,904
If that happened up there,
you'd be dead.

1144
01:23:30,037 --> 01:23:31,037
Do you understand?

1145
01:23:31,438 --> 01:23:33,107
And maybe we lose another
astronaut trying to save you.

1146
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:37,377
That's... Um... Sir. (inhales)

1147
01:23:38,946 --> 01:23:42,082
I'm giving everything
to this program, to the mission.

1148
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,885
Believe me. You can't just...

1149
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:48,756
I need to get back up there.
I mean, I want to go back.

1150
01:23:48,922 --> 01:23:52,426
To serve you. NASA. My country.

1151
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:57,732
I'm pulling you out
of the running for Orion.

1152
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:01,903
- No.
- Excuse me?

1153
01:24:05,538 --> 01:24:06,608
(scoffs)

1154
01:24:10,044 --> 01:24:11,412
Sir, please.

1155
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:14,248
I was born to do this.

1156
01:24:15,882 --> 01:24:17,417
It's all I have.

1157
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:27,961
FRANK: I'll make sure you're in the
running for Polaris three years out.

1158
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:30,297
But for now, I want you
to take a little time.

1159
01:24:30,497 --> 01:24:31,931
Find some distance.

1160
01:24:32,265 --> 01:24:33,567
Focus on training
the new recruits.

1161
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,871
Work with engineers
on system upgrades.

1162
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:42,277
Hey.
You're a real astronaut, Lucy.

1163
01:24:42,809 --> 01:24:43,977
A heavyweight.

1164
01:24:44,611 --> 01:24:47,948
You just let yourself get
too emotional.

1165
01:25:01,228 --> 01:25:05,700

1166

1169

<i>I can't come to the phone...</i>

1175
01:25:36,596 --> 01:25:39,334
Can I at least get some money
for the vending machine?

1176
01:25:41,135 --> 01:25:43,338
(breathes heavily)

1177
01:25:44,071 --> 01:25:45,439
(sighs)

1178
01:25:46,806 --> 01:25:49,644
This is not a drill, cadet.
Grab your stuff.

1179
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:06,360
- What are we doing?
- Training exercise.

1180
01:26:06,593 --> 01:26:09,063
I'm the team leader.
You're the mission specialist.

1181
01:26:09,462 --> 01:26:10,997
What does that mean?

1182
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:18,139
- LUCY: In or out?
- Is this legal?

1183
01:26:18,505 --> 01:26:19,906
Get the door.

1184
01:26:22,009 --> 01:26:23,478
(door closes)

1185
01:26:24,511 --> 01:26:27,114
Let me give you a heads-up,
all right?

1186
01:26:29,416 --> 01:26:31,651
One day, you're gonna be
working your hardest...

1187
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:34,388
going toe-to-toe, contender.

1188
01:26:34,587 --> 01:26:36,823
Some man is gonna tell you
you're too emotional.

1189
01:26:36,957 --> 01:26:38,859
You're gonna think,
"What does that even mean?

1190
01:26:38,925 --> 01:26:39,892
I have feelings, sure.

1191
01:26:40,059 --> 01:26:42,929
I know, maybe I'm sad
or pissed, but I'm not that,

1192
01:26:43,029 --> 01:26:44,197
I'm not too emotional.

1193
01:26:44,363 --> 01:26:46,399
I'm, you know,
regular emotional."

1194
01:26:46,465 --> 01:26:49,135
And you know what
he's really saying is,

1195
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,171
you are a...

1196
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:56,611
(keyboard clacking)

1197
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:58,479
All right.

1198
01:27:09,656 --> 01:27:10,991

Oh. There you go. Fuel up.
I'll be back.

1215

Is Mark here?

1216
01:28:38,979 --> 01:28:41,348
Oh, I mean, I hope so.
It's his party, right?

1217
01:28:41,814 --> 01:28:43,783
Hey, listen. Are you okay?
I heard about Paxton.

Oh, I'm fine. I'm good.
All systems go.

Oh, you don't know?

1222
01:28:54,995 --> 01:28:57,163
They picked the Orion crew.
I'm going.

1223
01:28:59,132 --> 01:29:03,069
Um... listen, you know, I just...
I really thank you for...

1224
01:29:03,703 --> 01:29:05,773
when you walked out
on me that day. Because,

1225
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,475
I don't know, you telling me
that I need to do it on my own...

1226
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:09,977
I have to find Mark.

1227
01:29:12,446 --> 01:29:13,848
There he is.

1228
01:29:14,314 --> 01:29:15,849
Hey. Hey!

1229
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:18,352
- Whoa! Hi.
- Glad to be back?

1230
01:29:18,518 --> 01:29:20,354
- Yeah. I sure am.
- Hey.

1231
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:23,690
Um. We should get you
a drink, huh?

1232
01:29:23,989 --> 01:29:26,326
Hey, Kate, watch the thing.
Make sure nothing burns here

1233
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,930
for me, okay? Hey.

1234
01:29:30,263 --> 01:29:32,500
- Is, uh, Drew here?
- Who?

1235
01:29:32,832 --> 01:29:35,868
- Your husband?
- Oh, I left him. Hi!

1236
01:29:36,435 --> 01:29:39,940
What? Hey, come on.
Are you... What?

1237
01:29:41,575 --> 01:29:43,010
Hey, Lucy.

1238
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:44,779
I know about Erin.

1239
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,746
I read your e-mails
when you were in space.

1240
01:29:46,813 --> 01:29:48,683
I broke into your office.

1241
01:29:51,617 --> 01:29:54,287
- You broke into my office?
- He grounded me.

1242
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:56,122
- Yes. I know he did.
- Paxton.

1243
01:29:56,223 --> 01:29:58,591
I heard about it right before
I went up. I'm sorry.

1244
01:29:58,759 --> 01:30:02,363
What am I gonna do? Orion.
You have to talk to him.

1245
01:30:02,862 --> 01:30:05,065
Lucy, I need you to listen
to me, okay?

1246
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,334
Take a deep breath.

1247
01:30:07,867 --> 01:30:09,169
You're having a panic attack.

1248
01:30:09,336 --> 01:30:11,905
It's not that big a deal, okay?
I... I get them all the time.

1249
01:30:12,005 --> 01:30:15,242
No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1250
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:17,878
He just... he grounded me
for no fucking reason.

1251
01:30:17,944 --> 01:30:19,846
- And you gotta talk to him.
- I will. All right, Lucy.

1252
01:30:19,913 --> 01:30:23,817
But for right now, I want you
to get some rest, okay?

1253
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:27,488
You are spiraling.
You need to shut your brain off.

1254
01:30:28,054 --> 01:30:30,623
God. Go for a run or something.

1255
01:30:30,757 --> 01:30:33,361
A run? A run?

1256
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:34,661
Lucy.

1257
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:38,632
Is there anybody that you
can talk to? A doctor, maybe?

1258
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,970
It's too bad we never got
that weekend away.

1259
01:30:43,069 --> 01:30:44,404
Just you and me.

1260
01:30:44,837 --> 01:30:46,873
Where'd you wanna go again?

1261
01:30:47,573 --> 01:30:49,076
San Diego?

1262
01:30:49,408 --> 01:30:51,679
- Lucy.
- Listen.

1263
01:30:58,251 --> 01:31:01,154
I know what you're doing.
You and her.

1264
01:31:02,389 --> 01:31:04,158
But you're gonna lose.

1265
01:31:04,657 --> 01:31:08,728
You're gonna lose,
because I'm a winner.

All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mrs. Know-it-all.

1365
01:38:04,277 --> 01:38:07,781
Well, I know things.
I know things.

1366
01:38:09,916 --> 01:38:10,917
He's gonna see reason.

1367
01:38:11,317 --> 01:38:14,488
He's a reasonable person.
Paxton. He's gonna see reason.

1368
01:38:16,422 --> 01:38:21,493
I think all this astronaut dick
has made you soft.

1369
01:38:21,894 --> 01:38:23,495
- Oh, I'm soft?
- Mm-hmm.

1370
01:38:23,662 --> 01:38:24,864
I'm soft?

1371
01:38:25,498 --> 01:38:28,234
I took eight G's
and didn't even blink.

1372
01:38:28,801 --> 01:38:30,603
How many G's can you take?

1373
01:38:31,437 --> 01:38:34,575
Oh, that's right, none.
Because you're fucking dead.

1374
01:38:37,243 --> 01:38:39,278
What are you doing?

1375
01:38:40,279 --> 01:38:43,049
I'm on a rescue mission.
Low Earth orbit.

1376
01:38:43,215 --> 01:38:45,718
Somebody got left behind
up there.

1377
01:38:46,787 --> 01:38:47,788
Who?

1378
01:38:48,354 --> 01:38:49,522
Me!

1379
01:39:04,203 --> 01:39:05,205
LUCY OVER PHONE: <i>Sir.</i>

1380
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:09,242
<i>I won't lie. Being up there,
the experience...</i>

1381
01:39:10,042 --> 01:39:11,076
<i>I wasn't ready.</i>

1382
01:39:11,411 --> 01:39:14,381
<i>I mean, I... I was ready
for the job. I did the job.</i>

1383
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:16,248
<i>But the experience...</i>

1384
01:39:16,715 --> 01:39:17,783
<i>But I get it now.</i>

1385
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:22,188
<i>It's not just a job, sir.
I, uh... I thought it was.</i>

1386
01:39:22,255 --> 01:39:24,658
<i>But then I went, and now I know.</i>

1387
01:39:26,292 --> 01:39:27,693
It's a purpose.

1388
01:39:28,961 --> 01:39:30,464
It's my purpose.

1389
01:39:31,898 --> 01:39:34,034
<i>You know sometimes
on the old Apollo missions...</i>

1390
01:39:34,434 --> 01:39:38,171
<i>the bird would just, you know,
get off course. Just a little.</i>

1391
01:39:38,304 --> 01:39:40,139
And you'd need to bring
thrusters online

1392
01:39:40,206 --> 01:39:42,075
just to get her back on track.

1393
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:43,710
You know,
give her a little push.

1394
01:39:43,977 --> 01:39:46,379
That's all I needed, a nudge.

1395
01:39:46,446 --> 01:39:48,281
You know,
just course correction.

1396
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:49,983
And you wouldn't do that for me.

1397
01:39:50,049 --> 01:39:51,919
And now I have
to do it for myself.

1398
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:56,790
(line disconnects)

1399
01:40:01,961 --> 01:40:02,962

All right. You stay here.
Keep the car running.

1410
01:41:58,411 --> 01:42:00,846

- "We"?

1411

1412
01:42:05,952 --> 01:42:07,487
You okay?

1413
01:42:11,157 --> 01:42:12,492
What are you looking for?

1414
01:42:13,225 --> 01:42:14,795
Shit.

1415
01:42:16,261 --> 01:42:18,665
Shit, shit, shit.

1416
01:42:21,701 --> 01:42:23,069
Shit.

1417

Yeah.

Jesus. You scared

01:46:35,854 --> 01:46:37,256
You cannot be here.

1446
01:46:37,657 --> 01:46:41,194
You said it was a club.
That I was in the club.

1447

1449
01:46:46,232 --> 01:46:50,269
Lucy, you are a grown woman.
With a husband, I might add.

1450
01:46:50,403 --> 01:46:53,072
- So this... this... Don't do this.
- Nothing matters.

1451
01:46:53,139 --> 01:46:54,940
Nothing matters.
That's what you said.

01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:56,407
That's what you said.

1453
01:46:56,809 --> 01:46:59,445
You said that. We're just atoms.

And now I'm left with what?

1455

- Nothing.

1456

1457
01:47:06,986 --> 01:47:08,087
Why don't I... All right, look.

1458
01:47:08,153 --> 01:47:09,821
Why don't I call you

Now it's a complete shit show.

You're Einstein.

They don't.

Mark!

1474

1475
01:47:47,026 --> 01:47:49,362
Listen. We don't have much time.

1476
01:47:50,261 --> 01:47:51,397
All right. Listen.

1477
01:47:51,797 --> 01:47:53,832
Sometimes there's wasps. Okay?

1478
01:47:53,933 --> 01:47:55,434
- Okay.
- You think it's a butterfly...

1479
01:47:55,768 --> 01:47:56,969
but then it's wasps.

1480
01:47:57,236 --> 01:47:59,205
And I know he told you
that you're part of club...

1481
01:47:59,272 --> 01:48:00,906
- that you're in the club now.
- Lucy, calm down.

1482
01:48:00,973 --> 01:48:03,809
But what did he make you give?
Your body. Right?

1483
01:48:03,975 --> 01:48:06,845
And then, you make a mistake,
not even a mistake.

1484
01:48:06,912 --> 01:48:08,680
You just take a risk
that they don't like.

1485
01:48:08,848 --> 01:48:10,716
- ERIN: Yeah.
- And suddenly, it's what club?

1486
01:48:10,916 --> 01:48:12,718
And you have nothing.

1487
01:48:12,917 --> 01:48:15,720
All right, it's a trap.
It's a trap.

1488
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:17,990
So, I came here to warn you.

1489
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:21,426

1490
01:48:21,961 --> 01:48:24,196
