00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,786
<i>[car engine starts]</i>

2
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,989
<i>[car engine running]</i>

3
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,921
<i>[running continues]</i>

4
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,990
Margaret.

5
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,743
Margaret.

6
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,244
Margaret.

7
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,125
Yes?

8
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,172
You should get some sleep.

9
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,486
[Sidgwick] Dr. Matheson!

10
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,190
Thanks for coming.

11
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,152
You can't imagine how
pleased I am to see you.

12
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,282
This is Dr. Matheson, actually.

13
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,863
Oh, I'm sorry.

14
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,698
Please, forgive me.

15
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,829
These last few days have
been a bit difficult.

16
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,127
Don't worry, I should have worn a lab coat.
That's Dr. Buckley.

17
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,078
Nice to meet you.

18
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,920
The pleasure's
all mine, really.

19
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:12,053
You can't begin to imagine what's
been going on here, really.

20
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,011
We haven't slept
a wink in weeks...

21
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,141
isn't that right, Sarah?

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,972
<i>She hasn't been coping very well.
None of us have.</i>

23
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,150
Did I mention we haven't
slept a wink in days?

24
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,316
[loud crash]

25
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,523
That's it.

26
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,075
Did you hear?

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,197
It's starting.

28
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,155
[soft thudding]

29
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,081
[Traci] Did you hear him?

30
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,206
[odd intonation]
He is a bit angry today.

31
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,964
[Tom] Who's angry?

32
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,883
Traci's been
a real help, you know?

33
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,426
She's, uh... she's
been such a help.

34
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,879
[Margaret] I bet.

35
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,679
Can we see the rest
of the house?

36
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,553
Sure. This way, please.

37
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,226
It's an old house,
but the price was great.

38
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,976
We only moved in a while ago.
We're still settling in.

39
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,774
Hi, I'm Tom.
Uh, I'm a physicist.

40
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,602
- If you want to keep doing...
- I'm a physicist, too.

41
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,439
What did you think I was?
A housewife?

42
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,775
- A hairdresser?
- No, I...

43
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,201
- Oh, I... I didn't mean...
- Forget it.

44
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,198
Actually, I am a hairdresser.

45
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,449
Oh.

46
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,657
Traci. Traci Northrop.

47
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,118
[Margaret] Tom, enough mingling.
We're going upstairs.

48
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,924
I know, she's been a real help.

49
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,299
Since when?

50
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,926
I don't know, a few days.

51
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,803
Three or four, isn't
that right, Sarah?

52
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,305
You took so long. We
didn't know where to turn.

53
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,137
We're not a public
service, Mr. Sidgwick.

54
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,938
We do what we can.

55
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,311
Sure. Uh, excuse me a moment.

56
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,608
The girls' room.

57
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,573
[Sarah] Susan.

58
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,491
How many times have
I told you not to play

59
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,661
on the floor till
the heating gets fixed.

60
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,830
We're still settling
in, you know?

61
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,329
We, uh... still have some
stuff to sort out.

62
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,001
But the price was great.

63
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,579
Stand up, sweetheart,
and say hello.

64
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,005
Say hi.

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,081
[Susan] Hi.

66
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,257
- Hi.
- Hi.

67
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,675
You said "the girls."

68
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,048
Julia is at her grandparents'.

69
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,424
She wasn't feeling so great,

70
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,096
so we thought we just as soon

71
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,015
send her back to Vermont
for a few days.

72
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,966
A few days.

73
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,392
[soft sigh]

74
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,266
She's much better now.

75
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,563
[Traci] Everything's ready.

76
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,982
Sorry. I didn't
mean to butt in.

77
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,982
Whenever you want.

78
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,732
Too much light.

79
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,520
[Traci sighs deeply]

80
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,983
When I begin the session,
no matter what happens,

81
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,235
please don't break the circle.

82
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,943
It can be dangerous.

83
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,402
[Click]

84
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,362
[softly] January twenty-second.

85
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,447
Eleven fifteen.

86
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,535
Session participants are, from
the north side: Mr. Sidgwick

87
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,210
and his wife,

88
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:32,086
Dr. Margaret Matheson
and Traci Northrop.

89
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,009
The session is recorded
by Dr. Thomas Buckley.

90
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,302
[Traci moans]

91
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,437
Temperature is dropping
slowly, one degree...

92
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,565
Correction, two degrees.

93
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:57,445
Spring scale pressure
remains constant.

94
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,403
[Traci]
I... I can hardly hear you.

95
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,283
Speak up, please.

96
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,745
[moaning]

97
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,832
I can hardly hear you.

98
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,431
I know.

99
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,602
I know, but you
have to speak louder.

100
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,770
[loud claps]

101
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,893
[Mr. Sidgwick]

102
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:35,821
[table knocking]

103
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,239
Gently.

104
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,657
Please, we've come to help you.

105
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,654
[loud clap]

106
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,155
[all shout]

107
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:47,332
[Traci breathing heavily]

108
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:55,407
[table knocking]

109
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,001
[knocking stops]

110
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,259
[Traci breathes rapidly]

111
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,180
It really hurts!

112
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,681
[Sidgwick] Stop it.
Tell it to stop!

113
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,887
[Sarah] Michael, don't break it.

114
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,187
It hurts. I can't...

115
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,856
I demand that you stop!

116
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,559
I'm telling you, I
demand that you stop!

117
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,734
Michael, don't
break the circle.

118
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,561
It hurts! I can't!

119
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,693
- Don't break the circle!
- I demand that you stop!

120
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,525
[screaming]

121
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,905
[loud thud]

122
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,363
[Traci breathes rapidly]

123
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,538
[door opens]

124
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,536
[Sidgwicks shout]

125
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,662
Mommy! Mommy!

126
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,459
I'm scared, Mommy!

127
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,457
Let's get out of here.
Let's go away from here.

128
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,288
Okay, darling.

129
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,919
Okay.

130
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,594
So do you miss Vermont?

131
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,724
- Where do you live?
- In Bakersfield.

132
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,892
Nice?

133
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,977
Uh-huh.

134
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,646
Your sister like it too?

135
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,642
Who had the idea
about the closet?

136
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,353
Was that you, or your sister?

137
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,279
Julia.

138
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,529
She show you how to bang it
against the wall like that?

139
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,576
It really scares my dad.

140
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,450
What about your mom?

141
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,372
Mom wants to leave, too.

142
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,083
Let's make a deal,
just between you and me.

143
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,710
Do we have to shake hands?

144
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:23,171
No, we don't have
to shake hands.

145
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,675
Here's the deal.

146
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,427
If you promise not
to do it again

147
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,386
I won't say
anything to your dad.

148
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,186
That's it.

149
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,357
I... I didn't do that
thing with the table.

150
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,903
No, I know that, Susan. I
didn't ask you about a table.

151
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,276
My sister's gonna be real sad.

152
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,572
Yeah.

153
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,696
She's gonna be real sad.

154
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,374
My car, you drive. That's fair.

155
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,122
- Why is that fair?
- It is.

156
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,623
[Sidgwick] Where are you going?

157
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,546
You still didn't get
to the bottom of this!

158
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,589
Don't worry about it,
Mr. Sidgwick.

159
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,760
If the banging starts
again, just call us.

160
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,587
And get rid of the hairdresser!

161
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:17,637
[indistinct voices
over airplane radio]

162
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,598
It's been an honor to fly
you here, Mr. Silver.

163
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,307
I hope you had
a pleasant flight.

164
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,017
Please, allow me to help you...

165
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,570
[Silver] Would you
mind letting go of me?

166
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,737
Thank you.

167
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,342
[Margaret] If you press down
hard on the top of the table

168
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,143
and draw your hands
toward your body,

169
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,846
the outer two table lengths

170
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,479
are going to go up like
a schoolgirl's dress.

171
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,185
You can even stick
the edge of your shoe

172
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,895
under one of the table legs

173
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,322
and, by pressing down
firmly with your hands

174
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,240
and lifting your foot
at the same time,

175
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,990
you can make the whole
table come off the ground.

176
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,242
It just takes
a little bit of muscle

177
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,039
and a whole lot of practice.

178
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,116
So, with the right
partner in crime,

179
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,669
you can put on quite a show.

180
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,372
The setting is important.
Keep it dark,

181
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,878
always, under
any pretext whatsoever.

182
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,679
The spirits demand it,
you need to concentrate...

183
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,223
I know what you are thinking.
It's not scientific.

184
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:42,225
But you need darkness to develop
a photograph, don't you?

185
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,055
Miss Owen?

186
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,936
So are you saying that
all paranormal phenomena

187
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,109
are frauds
without any exception?

188
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,857
Actually, no, I'm not.

189
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,655
The majority simply have
a natural explanation

190
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,779
or are the result
of subjective interpretation.

191
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,737
[male student] But how do you
establish proper controls?

192
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,788
It's not difficult.

193
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,491
In a case like this one, without
any special preparation,

194
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,668
we would sit the medium
against the wall

195
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,996
and place two cards
behind his elbows.

196
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,502
Then if he moves his
arms to shift the table,

197
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,424
the cards will fall.

198
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,173
If the cards remain in place,

199
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,721
only the spirit
of a very friendly stagehand

200
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,548
is going to be
moving that table.

201
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,053
That's the principle.

202
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,555
Or if you prefer,
you can mark out

203
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,103
a security perimeter
for the hands

204
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,055
to ensure that
no pressure is applied

205
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,233
outside the center of gravity.

206
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,731
For instance,
for the round table,

207
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,532
it will only move if pressure
is exerted here... or here.

208
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,200
[male student 2] Have you ever
come across a single case

209
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,949
that couldn't be explained?

210
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,201
Like the existence of
an anomalous ability?

211
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,203
An anomalous ability?

212
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,125
Like what?

213
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,545
Like running a hundred
meters in under ten seconds?

214
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,841
Like composing a masterpiece
when you're stone deaf?

215
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,045
Your brain may be
the exception, Ben,

216
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,051
but most brains carry out

217
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,350
a dazzling array of complex
mental processes every second.

218
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:06,896
100,000 million neurons in
constant synaptic communication

219
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,942
geared to generating and regulating
our sensations and perceptions.

220
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,940
How we reason, how we think,

221
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,942
our emotions,
our mental images,

222
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,695
our attention span,
learning, memory.

223
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,244
Are these not merits enough
for the brain

224
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,788
without it having
"special powers" as well?

225
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,616
[female student] So you're
saying the existence of any kind

226
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,623
of paranormal power
is impossible?

227
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,750
What I'm saying, Miss Owen,

228
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,584
is that after 30 years of
investigating all kinds of phenomena

229
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,294
with the right
controls in place,

230
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,632
I have yet to witness
a single miracle.

231
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,433
- Excellent table lifting.
- Thank you.

232
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,887
[Shackleton] I... I just
sat in on your class.

233
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,346
Dr. Shackleton.

234
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,431
Inspirational. Congratulations.

235
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,485
You know, I admire
your skepticism, Margaret,

236
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,813
but you can't deny reality just
because you can't explain it.

237
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,944
That's not exactly true.

238
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,151
I can't explain why your
department gets double our budget,

239
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,077
but I don't deny it's the case.

240
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,621
So let's talk, join forces.

241
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,825
We're making huge strides
forward in the SPRC.

242
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,832
A discerning vision like
yours could really help.

243
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,130
I don't do hocus
pocus, Shackleton.

244
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,673
I suggest you don't either.

245
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:20,424
[audience laughs and claps]

246
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,594
You didn't even touch that.

247
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,679
How do you do that?

248
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,355
Isn't that incredible?

249
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,058
Well, it doesn't
always work, Mike.

250
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,438
I got lucky today,

251
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,860
that's all.

252
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,063
The fact is, we can all do it.

253
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,365
Well, frankly, I knew
that, uh, blind people

254
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,363
had a more developed
sense of smell,

255
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,365
but after what we've
seen here tonight...

256
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,369
[laughs]

257
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,917
You're right. You're right.

258
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,292
<i>[commentator] Simon Silver became
popular at the end of the Sixties</i>

259
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,045
<i>and his fame continued
to grow over the next decade.</i>

260
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,003
<i>In 1975, he suddenly
announced his retirement,</i>

261
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,837
<i>stunning his legion of fans.</i>

262
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,922
<i>Many linked his exit
from the limelight</i>

263
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,680
<i>with the death of a veteran
journalist, Martin Weiner,</i>

264
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,601
<i>a skeptical reporter</i>

265
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,350
<i>who suffered a heart attack</i>

266
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,272
<i>while attending
one of Silver's shows.</i>

267
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,349
<i>The post-mortem concluded
the heart attack was</i>

268
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,527
<i>the result of natural causes,</i>

269
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,900
<i>but Silver was never able
to shake off the suspicion</i>

270
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,198
<i>surrounding Weiner's death.</i>

271
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,573
<i>He disappeared just as suddenly
as he had become a star,</i>

272
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,653
<i>which is why his
come-back announcement</i>

273
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,741
<i>more than 30 years after

274
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,917
Margaret, I was watching that.

275
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,994
[Sally] Sorry, I, uh...

276
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,877
I thought maybe you wouldn't
hear me, 'cause you... didn't.

277
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,880
[CHUCKLE]

278
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,132
Is Dr. Matheson around?

279
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,464
Uh...

280
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,672
[chuckles]

281
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,507
[Tom] No, she's not.

282
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,058
Mm.

283
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,976
Can I leave the
assignment with you?

284
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,106
Yeah.

285
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,566
Just watch the coin, okay?

286
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,455
- Where'd it go?
- Lift your glass, please.

287
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,626
Where did you learn to do that?

288
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,677
You can't always
trust your eyes.

289
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,098
You did most of the magic
by looking in the wrong place.

290
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,846
Oh, now you're really
taking the fun out of it.

291
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,553
The simpler, the better.
That's the principle.

292
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,934
The only way to pull a
rabbit out of a hat

293
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,983
is by putting it there
in the first place.

294
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,435
Open it.

295
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,988
It's in your left hand.

296
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,815
Did you... Did you see that?

297
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,992
No, I got lucky.

298
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,865
The class is really
great, you know?

299
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,946
It makes you think.

300
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,497
So, right, um...

301
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,166
you been working
for Matheson long?

302
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,788
Or are you a psychologist too?

303
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,959
Or a magician?

304
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,287
Wha...? [CHUCKLE]

305
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,917
Uh, no, I'm not a magician.

306
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,499
Um, actually, I'm a physicist.

307
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,960
- So why do you do this?
- Do what?

308
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,261
Investigate fake
paranormal stuff.

309
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,634
Don't you think
it's a bit weird?

310
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,308
- I just try to help Margaret...
- I mean, what for?

311
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,182
If someone claims to have
powers and actually don't,

312
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,979
who cares? Why bother?

313
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,351
Why bother?

314
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,027
If your mom was one
of those people

315
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,855
who went to see a psychic

316
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,363
because, um... her stomach
was bothering her

317
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,787
and the psychic

318
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,866
told her that it was nothing,
that it was just a...

319
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,953
a touch of gastritis.

320
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,709
But then later on...

321
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,166
you find out
it was stomach cancer

322
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,592
and it's too late to treat.

323
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,007
Do you think then you'd
say "Why bother?"

324
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,227
Did... did that happen to you?

325
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,348
Okay, watch this.

326
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,531

00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,547
how did you do that?
Doesn't that hurt?

333
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,465
No.

334
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,338
Well, a litt... a little.

You want your music, Stevie?

me there, please.

Okay.

The reason people
believe in ghosts is

00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,445

reason they believe

00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,444
in haunted houses
or tunnels of light.

399
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:05,699
Because it would mean that there
was something... after death.

400
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,914
I only wish there were.

401
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,496

to let my... beliefs

desires or my... needs.

know who the man was

that there was something else,

409
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,727
I would shut off all this crap

410
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,359

Come on, Margaret,
give us a break.

You know, nothing to write
home about, I know,

but in the last couple of
weeks we scored 3.4, 4, 4.6...

And the chances the difference are down
to coincidence is <i>2</i> in 100, Margaret.

00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,888
I won't be long.

710
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,387
So what is it this time?
Psychic photography?

711
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,889
- Retrocognition, remote vision?
- Telepathy.

712
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,846
- Drawings, sealed envelopes, cards?
- Zener cards.

713
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,272
Double blind, triple
blind, simple blind?

714
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,190
Simple blind. I did it myself.

715
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,234
I take it from your enthusiasm
you just did a test.

716
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,652
That's right.

717
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:10,695
Were you facing your subject?

718
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,522
Sure.

719
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,573
What about them?

720
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,276
Uh, they were in the control
booth, monitoring the subject.

721
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,077
Who was monitoring you?

722
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,576
Me? Why would anyone want
to be monitoring me?

723
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,407
It's a joke.

724
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,834
So were you at the same
eye level as the subject?

725
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,252
Approximately, yes.

726
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,374
- Under a light, I guess.
- Yes.

727
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,456
The way we are now?

728
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,507
More or less, I guess.

729
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,927
- You have the cards with you?
- No, I-I don't have them here.

730
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,380
[MAN, INDISTINCT]

731
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,966
- Oh. Yeah, here.
- Okay.

732
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,351
Okay.

733
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,932
Shoot.

734
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,188
What do you mean, "shoot"?

735
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,269
Go ahead. Shoot.

736
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,195
- T-To you?
- Sure.

737
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,318
[scoffs]

738
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,491
- Here?
- Why not?

739
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,113
[inhales] Okay.

740
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,286
Square.

741
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,914
<i>Cross.</i>

742
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:07,869
Square.

743
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,044
Square.

744
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,500
Star.

745
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,006
- Wave.
- How are you doing that?

746
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,133
- Methodological defects...
- No, w... w... they're not transparent, we make sure...

747
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:22,013
improper controls, the inadvertent
inclusion of relevant data

748
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,059
or, in this case,

749
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,682
all three at the same time.

750
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,309
Congratulations.

751
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,732
Next time, try taking
them off first.

752
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,693
So why'd you hold the
card up to the light?

753
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,322
So you wouldn't think
about your glasses.

754
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,996
[Tom] So, these images were
made during the Cold War...

755
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:53,211
under conditions controlled
by the Soviet authorities,

756
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,792
so there was no
independent investigations.

757
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,101
Leningrad, 1970.

758
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,609
Here Katia Novikova carries out

759
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,441
one of her more
controversial experiments.

760
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,322
As you can see,

761
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,371
she concentrates intensely
on the heart of the frog,

762
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,289
at the beginning
making it beat faster,

763
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,413
then slower,

764
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:34,293
and then, stopping
it beating altogether.

765
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:38,798
Katia asserted that she had, she had
inherited her powers from her mother...

766
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,721
and that during her childhood,
she would see objects...

767
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,477
[Cohen] Only God is right
all the time, Dr. Matheson.

768
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,435
And yes, there are sensitives
who are impostors,

769
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,360
just like there are skeptics.

770
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,438
Uh, you know, even scientists
are wrong every day.

771
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,114
But you, the
professional skeptics,

772
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,736
you also seem to be
experts in rhetoric.

773
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,159
Don't... don't bite off
my finger, doctor.

774
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,077
Look where I'm pointing.

775
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,827
Scientists' mistakes are
usually random, Mr. Cohen.

776
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,829
Pseudo-scientists' mistakes
tend to be directional.

777
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,535
Dr. Matheson seems
to forget that she

778
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,541
set up her stall
on this over 30 years ago.

779
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,339
Most professionals are fully
aware of the dangers of fraud

780
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,009
and design their experiments with
every imaginable precaution.

781
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,178
We're believers, doctor,
not simply credulous.

782
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,176
Very smart people are
often the most credulous

783
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,349
and are taken in by all
kinds of phenomena.

784
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,098
They're easy victims of fraud
because they think logically,

785
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,475
and professional magicians
count on that.

786
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,307
Like your client, for instance.
He's certainly one of them.

787
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,108
You should've told me
she would be here.

788
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,731
Oh, you said you wouldn't
speak to my client.

789
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,938
Are you scared of me too?
[chuckles]

790
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,365
The question is why does every
parapsychological phenomenon vanish

791
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,738
when there's a qualified
skeptic in the room?

792
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,411
Three to four Americans say they've had
some kind of metaphysic experience

793
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,285
and an even
higher percentage say...

794
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,241
He's gotta be in on it.
He's in on it.

795
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,292
Doctor, this is a question for you.
Don't you think...?

796
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,372
Margaret, just
get out of there.

797
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,831
[Margaret]
And even my colleagues,

798
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,837
the experimental psychologists“.

799
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,634
They're just gonna box her in.
They're just boxing her in.

800
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,507
...about their approach
to strange occurrences.

801
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,803
This is just what I'm
saying, it's just rhetoric.

802
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,677
It's just pure rhetoric,

803
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,009
it's just talking the talk,
but to refute the role

804
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,639
that all crows are black you need
just one single white one. Actually...

805
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,810
I've never seen a
white crow, have you?

806
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,809
Look a bit harder.

807
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,014
Miss Hansen, I believe that
you're Simon Silver's agent,

808
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,066
are you not?

809
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,438
I guess that means you've
gotten to know him pretty well

810
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,566
over the years, is that true?

811
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,522
I'm privileged.
He's a constant inspiration.

812
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,699
Silver's comeback has turned
into an event.

813
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,903
His recent sell-out performances
in both Atlanta and Dallas

814
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,910
can only be described
as an unbelievable success.

815
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,617
Today he will be
performing in our city,

816
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,079
at the Columbus Theater, less than
500 yards away from this studio.

817
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,415
Now, Miss Hansen, is "perform"...?
That's a funny word.

818
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,717
Do you think that's the right word
to describe what's going on here?

819
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,011
I would say "share."

820
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,838
Simon has never been ashamed of
sharing his extraordinary abilities.

821
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,923
I think that "perform"
is exactly the right word.

822
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,350
I beg to disagree.

823
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,098
Why allow for a rigorous study

824
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,099
when the mass spectacle
is there to be embraced

825
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,555
and there's money to be made?

826
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,106
A lot of money,
I would imagine.

827
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,024
The word "choice."

828
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,148
- Excuse me, Simon Silver.
- Taking advantage of people.

829
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,820
Was subjected to rigorous studies
by at least two different...

830
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,397
Oh, come on!

831
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,902
Universities of
unquestionable renown.

832
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,609
But I guess
you know this, doctor,

833
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,490
since you were on one
of those committees.

834
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,866
<i>I never signed off
on the findings however.</i>

835
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,868
- Are you okay?
- Sh... sh... sh.

836
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,574
<i>[Margaret] The
experiments weren't done</i>

837
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,159
<i>under proper
controlled conditions</i>

838
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,119
[Cohen] Yeah,
controlled conditions.

839
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,749
Those of us born different
feel real safe.

840
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,672
Complete inspection
of all body orifices,

841
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,716
Faraday cages where we are
locked away like animals,

842
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,634
And... and you're
surprised that Silver

843
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,007
refused to subject
himself to that.

844
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,713
No, I'm not at all surprised

845
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,764
that he refused to
follow the one protocol

846
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,468
that would effectively eliminate
any possibility of fraud.

847
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,600
All this sounds very convincing,
doctor, but in actual fact,

848
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,397
telepathic experiments...

849
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,601
No, no, no, no, do not
go on the defensive.

850
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,560
Margaret, do not go
on the defensive!

851
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,190
She's going on the defensive.

852
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,238
Can you see this?
This is what she does.

853
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,531
She goes on the defensive and
then the whole thing just...

854
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,530
[Margaret]... in light of

855
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,906
my considerable experience
investigating these phenomena,

856
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,363
Aw, don't give 'em an edge.

857
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,198
<i>Of the existence
of paranormal powers...</i>

858
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,909
She's gonna mention the bone.

859
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,665
Just wait, she's gonna
mention the bone.

860
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,917
Do not mention the bone.

861
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,374
I've spoken to some
of those supposed victims

862
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,255
whose eyes you
claim to have opened,

863
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,836
and, believe me, they don't
have very nice things

864
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,921
to say about you.

865
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,722
Telling people they've been
victimized by these crazy ideas

866
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,516
and then trying to get
the ideas away from them

867
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,218
it's like trying to take
a bone away from a dog.

868
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,553
[MANY GROANS]

869
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,354
They don't want to let go.

870
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,931
<i>[man] Maybe I don't
know my place but...</i>

871
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,391
How did you know that?

872
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,691
Because I'm psychic.

873
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,565
[Cohen] Yes, she did,

874
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,567
that's exactly what we are to you.
We were animals.

875
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:27,989
What I'm saying is give me
proof that a photon of light

876
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,782
can pass through a human body

877
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,359
and I will start to
believe in invisibility.

878
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,365
Until that happens,

879
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,617
all we're talking about here
is simple subjective beliefs.

880
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,119
[Hansen] What do you
believe in, Dr. Matheson?

881
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,123
Do you have a transcendent
view of life?

882
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,499
[Margaret] A what?

883
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,956
Well, you talk about beliefs.

884
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,041
What do you believe in?

885
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,923
Well, I don't really see what
that has to do with anything.

886
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,719
Well, it's a very
simple question

887
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,547
that maybe you can answer.

888
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,598
I'm just asking you,
do you believe or don't you?

889
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,848
[Margaret] Well, I try to
understand, not believe.

890
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,726
So you accept that it's possible
there's something out there?

891
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,103
No, I didn't say that.

892
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,981
You're <i>a</i> religious person?

893
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,566
No. You know, once, long
ago, I suppose I was.

894
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,446
Long ago?

895
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:16,871
And you lost your faith.
What... what happened, what...

896
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:20,667
What happened to
turn you into this...

897
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:24,496
lost, lonely woman?

898
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,581
- It's just a simple question.
- We're done.

899
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,132
<i>[Cohen] Oh, so just
get up and walk away?</i>

900
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,131
<i>I didn't mean anything by it.</i>

901
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,962
<i>Sometimes things get
said, Dr. Matheson,</i>

902
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,888
<i>and it's not always
pure hyperbole...</i>

903
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,716
<i>It's always
the same with girls.</i>

904
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,018
<i>[host] I'm terribly
sorry about this.</i>

905
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,016
<i>We expected her to
follow through...</i>

906
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,189
<i>[Cohen] Animals!</i>

907
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,016
<i>[host] ...and I hope
she'll come back.</i>

908
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,772
<i>Meantime, thank
you to the panelists.</i>

909
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,528
[Tom] This is one
of the kinder ones.

910
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,535
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Tom.

911
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,708
Do you have any idea the
advantage he has over us now?

912
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,784
In one minute we've
gone back decades!

913
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,962
We gotta investigate Silver!
We gotta do it now!

914
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,789
Tom, I can see you're angry...

915
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,624
You've been keeping me
away from him for weeks.

916
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,300
I'm not stupid, Margaret,
so stop pretending I am.

917
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,298
I know you're not.
He is not worth your...

918
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,629
Enough!

919
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,259
We gotta investigate him,

920
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,966
and if you won't,
I'll do it on my own.

921
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,801
Look, I know they did
a job on you, okay?

922
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,682
I know it wasn't fair and
that stooge of Silver's

923
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,354
played dirty. But she did it.

924
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,181
They took you by
surprise, I understand.

925
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,937
I don't know what I would
have done in your place

926
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,235
but here's where we are:
We look like idiots.

927
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,857
It's been over two years

928
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,735
since we received
a lousy private dollar

929
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,781
and the department funding
is so ridiculously low,

930
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,076
the only way they can make it
clearer they want rid of us

931
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,744
is with a marching band.

932
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,741
It has nothing to do
with the university,

933
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,163
it's Silver.

934
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,491
But Silver wasn't even there!

935
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,450
Silver is always there.

936
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,910
Don't you get it?

937
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,210
No, we gotta
investigate Silver!

938
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,333
And we gotta do it now!

939
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,211
Tom, sit down.

940
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,837
Just sit down.

941
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:53,884
[deep sigh]

942
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,212
Please?

943
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,513
<i>[sighs]</i>

944
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,344
This is how he does it.

945
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,225
He did it to me, and now
he's doing it to you.

946
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,477
- What does that even mean?
- It's not the first time.

947
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,433
He knows what he's doing.

948
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:13,192
We're weak, Tom. We want to
be strong but we're not.

949
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,773
You're not angry with me.

950
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:22,201
Every time I close my eyes,
I see my son that day.

951
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,204
I see David playing
over there on the floor.

952
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:30,130
He was so small. He was sturdy.

953
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,127
And then he fell.

954
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,425
He just fell over.

955
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,377
I thought he was
playing, but he wasn't.

956
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,007
He was four years old.

957
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,340
- Margaret, I'm really...
- Shh.

958
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,050
Everything's all right.

959
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,510
I write to him, you know?

960
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,811
Because I know
he can't hear me.

961
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,433
"Dear David..."

962
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,111
Silver and I

963
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,565
were on a television show just
like the one yesterday...

964
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,241
and he was shouting.

965
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,990
I was shouting.

966
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,867
We were young.

967
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,324
And then he started staring.

968
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,000
Not at me.

969
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,874
He was staring at
something beside me,

970
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,001
as if he could see
someone beside me,

971
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,627
you know, the
way the mediums do

972
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,426
when they say they
can see an angel or...

973
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,254
or a dead relative next to you.

974
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,308
No. I wasn't surprised.

975
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,430
I was expecting theatrics,

976
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,932
so I was prepared.

977
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:31,266
"I see a boy by your side.

978
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,101
"I see a blond boy.

979
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,528
"Do you know who that
might be, Margaret?"

980
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,526
"Has a boy close to you died?"

981
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,490
I didn't answer.

982
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,537
I couldn't speak.

983
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,082
I was so frightened.

984
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,285
And he kept going.

985
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:55,841
"This boy is asking
you to let him go.

986
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:59,920
"He says you
have to let him go."

987
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:04,553
"It's his time and you
won't let him go."

988
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,476
Now, did I denounce him

989
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,804
<i>as</i> an unscrupulous fraud?

990
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:13,812
Did I tell him that my
son was still alive?

991
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,987
Did I say anything in front
of those millions of people

992
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,736
who were waiting for my answer?

993
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:24,035
No. I didn't say a thing.

994
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,865
And you know the one
thing I can't forgive?

995
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,291
And I hate myself
for feeling this.

996
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,915
I hate myself from the moment
I wake up in the morning

997
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,166
to when I close
my eyes at night.

998
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:39,501
What I can't forgive is not
that he dared to use my son,

999
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,927
my sleeping, sick son.

1000
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,302
What I can't forgive
is that for one second,

1001
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,681
and it only lasted a second,

1002
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,763
I thought it might be true.

1003
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:56,602
He made me doubt!

1004
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,106
And everyone could see it.

1005
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,489
He's dangerous, Tom.

1006
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,037
Stay away from him.

you really know?

1120

00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,310

Sometimes you get
a spicy hamburger.

They think we're all Mexicans.

1159
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,715
At five, you get
the same thing again.

And that's it
until the next day.

didn't you?

1167
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:45,601
You told him how
we shut you down.

1168
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,187
Did the blind guy
spook us then, Buckley?

to the wrong place.

to know, get it?

for over a year!

nobody tell you that?

I just had to cry and shut
up whenever he told me.

1363
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,935
[Silver] It's a matter
of absolute priority

1364
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,268
that science begins to learn
all it can about these forces.

1365

the necessary conditions

1368

of other forms of energy.

1370
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:27,616
These forces can't
be ignored any longer.

1371
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:30,494

once and for all. Thank you.

canceled some of your shows?

[Hansen] Nothing's been canceled.
We're just re-scheduling.

We're trying to guarantee control conditions.
We're scientists,

1384
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,653
and for the first time we could
just obtain conclusive results

1385
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:03,356
about the reality
of extrasensory perception,

1386
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,862
the power of the
mind over matter.

1387
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:10,038
Our priority has to be to ensure
the veracity of those results.

Today's a great day,
ladies and gentlemen.

1389

1391
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,919

1396
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:33,562

you don't form

You're just an observer.

1400

You'll make no contribution
to the design of the tests

1401
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:50,403

1402
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,456
You can look, you can listen and
you can shut your goddamn mouth.

1403
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,704
Don't think I'm scared of you.

1404
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,753
If I'm putting up with you, it's
out of respect for Margaret.

1405
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,501
You try to honor her
in the same way.

1406
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,626
[door opens]

1407
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:04,710
[light applause]

1408
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,760
Mr. Silver!

1409
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,759
Mr. Silver, allow me to say

1410
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,511
thank you for
agreeing to do this.

1411
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:12,341
And let me apologize in advance

1412
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:15,019
for any inconvenience
we might cause.

1413
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:17,017
Science will be
very grateful to you.

1414
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:18,643
Well, that is
my sole objective.

1415
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:21,067
It's me who should
be grateful to you.

1416
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,816
Oh, you already
know Dr. Haynes.

1417
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,397
Doctor.

1418
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,777
Dr. Campbell.

1419
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,825
- Doctor.
- Hello, sir.

1420
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,278
Dr. Conrad Jennings, professor
of Biomedical Engineering,

1421
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,034
University of Leeds,

1422
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:36,662
- has been kind enough to join us.
- Doctor.

1423
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:38,960
And Professor Franklin,
Professor of Physics,

1424
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,378
Case Western University
of Ohio.

1425
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:41,670
Doctor.

1426
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,419
Now, if you don't mind...

1427
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:48,503
There's another guest
here, isn't that right?

1428
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,588
Yes, that... that is right.

1429
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,298
Excuse me, I... I didn't
introduce you formally.

1430
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,724
Have you met before?

1431
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,722
[Tom] I don't know. Have we?

1432
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,428
Dr. Buckley, of the University's
Psychology Department.

1433
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,479
He worked very
closely with Doctor...

1434
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,650
I have a great interest in the
figure of Doctor Buckley.

1435
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:08,027
I follow his
progress very closely.

1436
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,199
It's been a difficult
time for all of us, Tom.

1437
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,901
How are you getting along?

1438
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:15,534
I was so sorry to hear
about Dr. Matheson.

1439
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,615
Of course, uh...

1440
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:22,329
we can begin whenever
you feel ready.

1441
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,038
If you'd like to come this way.

1442
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,635
We know this isn't
an exact science.

1443
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,799
[Shackleton] Take your
time, whatever you need.

1444
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,805
We'll start with something
straightforward,

1445
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,682
you know, like an icebreaker.

1446
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,514
[Silver] Oh, oh, sure.
Psy... Psychic photography?

1447
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,224
Thoughtography.
How... How did you know?

1448
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,150
Oh, it's been a long
time since I did this,

1449
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,819
a very long time indeed.

1450
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:48,396
Digital, isn't it?

1451
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,573
Yeah, it is.
Exactly. Do you need...?

1452
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,275
I just need <i>a</i> simple
piece of cardboard.

1453
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:53,985
I don't want my fingers
smudging the lens.

1454
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:56,662
We opted to prepare
a plastic cylinder.

1455
01:16:56,737 --> 01:17:01,413
I hope you don't mind. It's
a half inch in diameter.

1456
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:03,039
Is it okay, will it do?

1457
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,042
One never knows,
Dr. Shackleton.

1458
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:09,046
As you just said yourself,
this isn't an exact science.

1459
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,628
Do you mind?

1460
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:13,132
Go ahead.

1461
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,192
Please, be careful
with my watch.

1462
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,320
The <i>glass</i> top flips up.

1463
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,697
I don't want the hands
moved by mistake.

1464
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,133
From now on you'll
not be allowed

1465
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,059
to withdraw your hands
from the table,

1466
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:03,763
unless it is for the purpose
of another inspection.

1467
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:04,768
You understand that, don't you?

1468
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:05,769
Yes.

1469
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,270
If you do so,

1470
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,022
the test will
be declared invalid.

1471
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,819
Okay, thank you.

1472
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,381
Ready when you are.

1473

<i>For the following experiment,</i>

1482
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,420
<i>Silver received three different
models of still camera:</i>

1483
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,168
<i>A middle range digital camera</i>

1484
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,840
<i>with a fixed /ens
focused on infinity,</i>

1485
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:15,043
<i>a conventional
analogical camera</i>

1486
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,344
<i>with a 50 mm /ens
focused on infinity</i>

1487
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:21,094
<i>and an instant Polaroid camera,
also focused on infinity.</i>

1488
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,971
<i>Silver's attempts
with the digital camera</i>

1489
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,178
<i>did not produce
any positive result.</i>

1490
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,980
<i>The second camera registered
only partial results,</i>

1491
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:30,353
<i>insufficient for
a positive evaluation.</i>

1492
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,686

1494
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:38,984
<i>There is no scientific
explanation for these results.</i>

1495
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:42,286
<i>The cylinder or gizmo which
Silver was provided with</i>

1496
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:44,784
<i>in order to concentrate
the flow of his thoughts</i>

1497
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:48,163
<i>was carefully checked before

1498
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:51,416
<i>in order to rule out
any possible manipulation.</i>

1499
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:58,424
<i>Silver claims to be capable of
bending metal at a distance</i>

1500
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,379
<i>without needing to touch it.</i>

1501
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,260
<i>However, during the
course of these tests,</i>

1502
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,808
<i>this could not be
experimentally confirmed.</i>

1503
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,227
<i>Following a more
re/axed protocol,</i>

1504
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,271
<i>Silver was allowed
to touch the metal</i>

1505
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:11,519
<i>which, as can be seen
in the film, was indeed bent.</i>

1506
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:14,727
<i>Visual analysis of the film
is insufficient to determine</i>

1507
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,404
<i>whether Silver possesses
extremely strong fingers</i>

1508
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,403
<i>and great control of
micro-manipulation movements</i>

1509
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,031
<i>or whether the distortion
is in fact caused</i>

1510
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,579
<i>by a paranormal ability,
as he claims.</i>

1511
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,032
<i>Later, Simon Silver
held his hand out</i>

1512
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,493
<i>in the continuous flow
of a running tap.</i>

1513
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:33,876
<i>As the images show, the flow
of water was notably deviated</i>

1514
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:37,709

[Ben] I think I've
got it, Doctor.

1521
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,067
I was trying with
the second adapter

1522
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:00,022
but if I could just join...

1524
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,904
Concentrate, Ben.

1525
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:04,735
I appreciate your help.
No more mistakes, okay?

1526
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,536
I'm sorry, Doctor, I promise...

1527
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:09,365
Don't promise anything.
Just plug it in. Good.

1528
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,041
[Ben] What, black and white?

1529
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,118
[Tom] It's fine. It doesn't matter.
Okay.

1530
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,749
Keep going, keep going, keep going...

1531
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:16,830
Stop! Stop there.

1532
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:20,293
[Tom] Okay, this was the last test.
Telepathy booths.

1533
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,094
During the whole two weeks,

1534
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:23,921
I wasn't able to get
within six feet of Silver,

1535
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,098
but you and I both know
the whole thing is a farce.

1536
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,892
- Actually, Dr. Buckley, I...
- A total fucking farce. Okay, rewind.

1537
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,685
Keep going, keep going.

1538
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:32,434
Okay, go over to the
other side of the gym.

1539
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,390
Stop, Ben! Stop there! Stop!

1540
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,942
You know, right now, Shackleton
is analyzing the data,

1541
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,486
getting ready to publish
his positive findings tonight,

1542
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,360
which just happens to coincide
with Silver's last show,

1543
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,066
which by some
strange coincidence,

1544
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,321
just happens to be taking place

1545
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,028
in this very city.

1546
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:48,738
It's the finale he's
been after all along.

1547
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,289
Well, why all this pressure?

1548
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:51,832
If we find out
something afterwards,

1549
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,625
they'll have to change
the findings.

1550
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,122
Ben, nothing that happens
afterwards will matter.

1551
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,330
Listen to me.
You are the only guy

1552
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:00,132
separating the world from stupidity
at this point in time. Okay?

1553
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:03,302
Okay? Now, you see this button?

1554
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:07,974
I've spent two days loading all
the images from all the cameras

1555
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:09,516
then synching them
frame by frame,

1556
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,059
with all the
angles in here, okay?

1557

01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,855
[Tom] Okay? Okay, Ben?

1560
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,525
This is the reception booth.
Silver is the receiver.

1561
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,820
That's the instrument panel.
It's got ten luminous buttons.

1562
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,272
Normally they put
a playing card in each one,

1563
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,028
but given that Silver is blind

1564
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:26,484
they've just numbered
them one through ten.

1565
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:27,819
Okay, and what's
supposed to...?

1566
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:28,948
Quiet. Now, second booth.

1567
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,620
[smash]

1568
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,198
It doesn't matter.
It's just a dead bird.

1569
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,033
[Tom] This is the
transmission booth.

1570
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,709
Now, you see the monitor?
It's a closed circuit.

1571
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,377
[Ben] Is he seeing
his own panel?

1572
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,955
No. No, no, no.
He's seeing Silver's panel.

1573
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,710
It's supposed
to help him concentrate.

1574
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,008
So the computer randomly
turns on alight.

1575
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,551
Then the guy concentrates

1576
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,094
on the number he's
been given. Okay?

1577
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,422
When he thinks
he knows the number,

1578
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,097
he presses the red button,

1579
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,221
which sets off a signal
in Silver's booth.

1580
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,223
When Silver hears the signal,

1581
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:55,054
he clears his mind, he
concentrates, whatever the fuck,

1582
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:56,605
when he thinks
he knows the answer,

1583
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,932
he presses
the corresponding number

1584
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,517
he think the guy has sent.

1585
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,022
Is that clear?

1586
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,694
Okay. The experiment lasted

1587
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,817
a total of seven
hours, including breaks.

1588
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:08,151
It was repeated a total of
nine times, in blocks of ten.

1589
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,986
The results were spectacular,
with a deviation rate

1590
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,868
eight times higher than
can be explained by chance.

1591
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:15,073
Now, what does this mean?

1592
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:16,909
That Silver's powers...?

1593
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,415
No! It means that Silver
is pulling a fast one!

1594
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:22,499
Do you know how I know this?
Because telepathy does not exist!

1595
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,879
Because nobody
has special powers!

1596
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,256
No. The protocol,
in theory, is sound.

1597
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,930
It's just that Silver has
found a way of breaching it.

1598
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,099
Okay, don't look
for radio transmitters,

1599
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,847
because the booths work as Faraday chambers.
I've checked them.

1600
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:35,394
They're isolated.

1601
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:36,971
What if he's not
pulling a fast one?

1602
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:38,522
Ben, you've got 41/2 hours

1603
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:40,691
of footage there
from seven cameras.

1604
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,393
- That's 30 hours.
- What am I looking for?

1605
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:43,944
An explanation, Ben,
just an explanation.

1606
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,862
Try to make it rational.

1607
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:05,633
[thunder]

1608
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:08,085
[man] Hey.

1609
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,670
Is everything okay, sweetie?

1610
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:35,363

[Silver] Sit down, please.

1620
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,435
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

1621
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:54,024
I'm not a very
accessible person.

1622
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:56,360
I suppose you've
realized that by now.

1623
01:25:56,443 --> 01:26:02,951
Only somebody who really wants
to get to me can do so.

1624
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:05,912
I won't talk to
anybody else today.

1625
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:11,342
Maybe I'll do so tomorrow,
in some other city.

1626
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,918
Maybe I won't ever again.

1627
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:22,102
As for me, I live each day
as if it were my last.

1628
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,600
And I'm starting to feel tired.

1629
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,432
Very tired indeed.

1630
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:40,284
I don't always demand payment for
my services, did you know that?

1631
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:45,289
At least, not in money. There's
other ways of paying for things.

1632
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,495
But you know that already.

1633
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,134
You do know that, don't you?

1634
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:01,304
To be or to appear to be,

1635
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:05,889
that is the question.
It always is.

1636
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:08,474
We all try to be
something we're not.

1637
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:22,409
[distant thunder]

1638
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,913
We dream 27 times a night.

1639
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:34,625
An intricate neurological
protection mechanism

1640
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:37,177
which makes us forget.

1641
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:40,131
What protects you?

1642
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:45,185
Aline of salt?

1643
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,184
From the time of ancient
Greece to the present day,

1644
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,686
philosophers and scholars
have argued

1645
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,313
man is essentially rational.

1646
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:54,486
I don't happen to agree.

1647
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,859
If one observes and
studies another person

1648
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:59,157
without having first
studied oneself,

1649
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,282
how do we know whether our
instruments are appropriately set?

1650
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:06,114
How do we know we are reliable?
We have no proof.

1651
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,747
There's only one way

1652
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:11,374
of gaining access to the truth,

1653
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,046
and that's not
to expect anything.

1654
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,419
[distant thunder]

1655
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:17,126
If our intentions aren't pure,

1656
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:19,462
we might end up
creating monsters.

1657
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:22,423
[distant thunder]

1658
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:33,267
Hm. Please excuse me.
It's getting late.

1659
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:36,194
For you too.

1660
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:40,615
Don't worry, we'll see
each other again.

1661
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:44,240
Oh, yes. We'll see
each other again.

1662
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,492
<i>[Tom sighs]</i>

1663
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:49,324
<i>[Reporter] Silver is in the
final stages of his countdown,</i>

1664
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:52,911
<i>only 12 hours after the announcement
of his most recent retirement.</i>

1665
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,918
This unexpected news
has caused commotion...

1666
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,375
...all kinds of
contradictory reactions.

1667
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:01,257
Those that predicted that
Silver had come back to stay

1668
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,555
have had no option
but to accept...

1669
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,303
[thunder crashes]

1670
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,555
...estimate that Silver
may well have pocketed

1671
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:09,682
more than four million dollars
in less than a month,

1672
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,559
a figure that would confirm...

1673
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,436
most immediate consequences,

1674
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:16,109
with prices of up
to 2,000 dollars

1675
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,562
being asked by
scalpers for seats,

1676
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:20,739
a more than dubious record
being held today...

1677
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:22,487
...packed out an hour and
a half before the start

1678
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:24,785
of what will be
his last appearance.

1679
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,363
It is impossible to predict
an outcome for this...

1680
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,447
...and it's with
great expectation

1681
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:33,331
the verdict from the Scientific
Paranormal Research Center,

1682
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,253
to be announced
officially tonight.

1683
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:37,251
If the leaks get out...

1684
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,298
...maybe thereby silencing
more than one skeptical voice,

1685
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:40,671
and transcending
once and for all

1686
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,377
the area of mystification

1687
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,337
and the study
of frontier sciences.

1688
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:46,799
Science has rarely had the
chance to study at close hand

1689
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:48,555
such controversial
manifestations

1690
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,977
as those which have made
Simon Silver famous.

1691
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,646
<i>We really have to wonder if the
spectators presently witnessing</i>

1692
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:56,316
<i>the final chance to see Simon

01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:23,294
Why have you come here tonight?

01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,426
What are you hoping to see?

1696
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:31,135
Do you think I
should surprise you?

1697
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:35,313
Do you think I
should entertain you?

1698
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:40,315
What are you
looking at so closely?

1699
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,395
What do you know about me?
How much do you believe?

1700
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:44,857
How much do
you want to believe?

1701
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:48,444
I can feel your longings,
your desires...

1702
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:51,370
I can feel your demands.

1703
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:54,541
It is a deep, painful
urgency of the animal

1704
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:56,539
forced to live in darkness

1705
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:59,963

and voraciously demands light

1706
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:03,212
with a howl of rage!

01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,464
What is it you've come to see?

1708
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:07,090
This?

1709
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,976
Have you come to see this?

1710
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:17,389
[audience gasps]

1711
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,816
I feel my veins burning

1712
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:24,442
with the fire
of a new understanding!

[Silver]
We called Ptolemy insane,

1717
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:37,830
we spat in the face of Galileo,

1718
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:40,913
we burned Giordano Bruno...

1719
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,964
What did we need?

1720
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:47,260
What do we need
in order to learn?

1721
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,590
[audience clapping]

1722
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:54,051
What makes us be what we are?

1723
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:58,640
What finally makes
us come to accept?

1724
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:01,145
What makes us believe?

1725
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:07,903
The question is:
Why did you come here...

1726
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:09,733
today?

1727
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:12,410
Are you crazy? I shouldn't
even be talking to you.

1728
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:13,987
Wait, wait, Ben,
I'm not against you.

1729
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,492
I... I just need to
know what you've got.

1730
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:17,074
You're my student
too, remember?

1731
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:18,579
Dr. Shackleton,
you know I can't talk.

1732
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:20,706
Listen, Ben,
I've always respected.

1733
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,537
Dr. Buckley's work,
and Dr. Matheson's.

1734
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,167
I'm not the enemy.

1735
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:26,090
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I'm going to hang up.

1736
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,884
Ben, I've got the results
of nine days of experiments

1737
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:29,131
sitting right
here in front of me.

1738
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,757
Definitive results.

1739
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:33,090
The only thing missing
is my signature.

1740
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:36,393
I'm talking about the scientific
verification of extrasensory perception

1741
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:39,563
and forces which until today have
only been seen as para-science...

1742
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,639
I can imagine.

1743
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:43,396
Do you have any idea what the
publication of these results

1744
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:44,977
will mean to Dr. Buckley
and his department?

1745
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,653
Yeah, I... I guess.

1746
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,071
Ben, if we've got
anything wrong, anything,

1747
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:50,615
I need to know.

1748
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,613
What have you got?

1749
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:53,488
Nothing.

1750
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:56,868
What?

1751
01:32:56,946 --> 01:33:01,452
- What do you mean?
- We got...

1752
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:02,581
nothing.

1753
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:07,587

01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:13,046
[Man 1] Final call,
we'd better get going.

1756
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,302
[Man 2] I hope the second half
is better than the first.

1757
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:17,850
I didn't spend 300
bucks to see Hamlet.

[thunder]

1765
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:20,247
- Sally!
- Ben? What are you doing here?

1766
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,574
[Ben] Shit, Sally, you don't know
how pleased I am to see you.

1767
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:24,034
Tom told me you'd be here.

1768
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:25,915
You should be
doing this, not me.

1769
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:28,122
What are you doing here?
Where is Tom? He's not home

1770
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:30,673
and he's not answering his phone.
Did something happen to him?

1771
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:32,671
Is that SPCR?

1772
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:34,718
Telepathy booths. I've been
watching the same images.

1773
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:36,842
- If you want my opinion...
- Ben, I don't. Where is Tom?

1774
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,639
With Silver, I think.

1775
01:34:38,715 --> 01:34:40,592
- What do you mean with Silver?
- At the theater.

1776
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:42,427
It's nothing out
of the ordinary.

1777
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,682
He wants you to wait for him
here, so take a seat.

1778
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:46,105
He's perfectly all right.

1779
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:48,400

What's that?

01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,909
- What's what?
- That. There.

1791
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:45,535
[Ben] His watch?

1792
01:35:45,615 --> 01:35:47,083
[Sally] Why would
Silver wear a watch?

1793
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:48,751
Blind people wear watches too.

1794
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:50,123
They tell the time
by touching the hands.

1795
01:35:50,203 --> 01:35:51,546
They checked it. It's clean.

1796
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:52,463
Can you split the image in two?

1797
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:59,261

[Coughs]

01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:11,835
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know yet.

1805
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:15,129
Put the sender on the left
and Silver on the right.

1806
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:16,581
[Ben] That's it.

1807
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,587
[Sally] Move in on the watches.

1808
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:20,384
- Can you do that?
- On the watches? Sure. Give me a sec.

1809
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:23,554
[Ben] I can't get an angle.

1810
01:37:23,629 --> 01:37:28,055
Let me try with another camera.

1811
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:29,761
[Sally] Can you
improve the quality?

1812
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:31,596
Mm-hm. Sure. I can
amplify a single pixel,

1813
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,056
click it up with my magic

1814
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:34,561
and make it so bright and shiny

1815
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,857
you need sunglasses
to look at it.

1816
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:37,435
This ain't a movie.

1817
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:38,940
We're in
the psychology department.

1818
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,943
All right.
Go to the other camera.

1819
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:43,696
I'd like to know
what the hell is...

1820
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,402
There! Stop!

1821
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:47,203
Shit, Sally. It's a
recording, you know?

1822
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:48,575
We can go back and forth
as much as we want.

1823
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:50,577
We can chill out.

1824
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:52,408
- Are you sure they're synchronized?
- Yes.

1825
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:54,415
- Completely?
- Completely.

1826
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:56,713
What are you looking for? They
don't have the same time.

1827
01:37:56,788 --> 01:37:58,711
What are the chances
that Silver and the sender

1828
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,542
are both wearing
analogical watches

1829
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,844
and that both are
synchronized second by second

1830
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,717
in millimetric precision?

1831
01:38:04,796 --> 01:38:06,594
Synchronized? Didn't you
hear what I just said?

1832
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:08,265
The watches don't tell
the same time.

1833
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:11,436
Second by second.

1834
01:38:13,429 --> 01:38:16,399
[BEN] Shit. It's a code.

1835
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,779
[thunder]

1836
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:40,457
They divide.

1837
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,837
They just have to divide the dial
of the watch into ten sections,

1838
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,793
one for each number.

1839
01:38:43,876 --> 01:38:45,844
When the second hand reaches
the corresponding section...

1840
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,763
...the sender presses
the button.

1841
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:49,512
Silver just has to know
where the second hand is

1842
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,308
when he hears the signal

1843
01:38:51,384 --> 01:38:52,681
and translate it
to the position.

1844
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,228
[Ben] They're in it together.

1845
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:56,647
Dr. Buckley was right.
It's a fraud.

1846
01:38:56,722 --> 01:38:57,939
Silver never touched the hands.

1847
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:59,483
The simpler, the better.

1848
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:00,981
Okay, it's right here
in front of us.

1849
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,028
What was it Matheson
used to say?

1850
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:05,698
Results appear when there
is defective methodology,

1851
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,446
important data is
inadvertently included...

1852
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:10,324
...or improper controls
are in place.

1853
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:14,283
They've taken
something for granted.

1854
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:15,958
Oh, Shit.

1855
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:17,125
Silver can see.

1856
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:18,498
[Reporters shouting]

1857
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:33,351
[Tom] Simon Silver!

1858

[thunder rumbles]

1860
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:41,567
Simon Silver.

1861
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:43,519
Did you really
need to go this far?

1862
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:45,105
[Silver] You will
know the truth,

1863
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:47,065
but the truth will
make you furious.

1864
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:49,116
Ladies and gentlemen, and
I don't think I'm wrong

1865
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:50,785
when I say

1866
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,737
we have a distinguished
guest amongst us.

1867
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:53,696
[applause]

1868
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:55,326
It's okay.

1869
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:57,784
The young and persistent
Thomas Buckley,

1870
01:39:57,867 --> 01:39:59,585
<i>as</i> many of you may know,

1871
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:02,379
decided some time ago
to devote part of his life

1872
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:05,834
to making mine
as difficult as possible.

1873
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:08,386
Am I going too far

1874
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:10,930
if I say he seems
somewhat out of sorts?

1875
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:13,303
[Tom] I wasn't able.

1876
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:17,808
In the end I just wasn't able.

1877
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,764
But you know that, don't you?

1878
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:25,027
You can't deny yourself.

1879
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:29,983
You can't live
in denial forever!

1880
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:32,444
I tried with all my strength.

1881
01:40:35,196 --> 01:40:37,540
[thunder]

1882
01:40:37,615 --> 01:40:41,665
Today it will be over.

1883
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,872
For you and for me.

1884
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:46,925
- I just hope we're both ready.
- You're a fool, Buckley.

1885
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:48,967
Are you threatening me
in front of everyone?

1886
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:51,796
I'm not like you. You can't hurt me.
I am the life force!

1887
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:54,974
I come with the wind
and I go with the wind.

1888
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,972
Do you want me to hurt you?

1889
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:58,803
Get out of here
now while you can.

1890
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:00,684
[man] I don't want to
interrupt anything

1891
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,936
but I'd really
like to sit down.

1892
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:05,643
My arm is hurting.

1893
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:09,071
Then put it down. There's
nothing stopping you.

1894
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:12,320
I just... just I...
I simply can't.

1895
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:21,660
Don't believe everything
they tell you.

1896
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,961
[Tom] You'd be better
off sitting down.

1897
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:32,136
[Silver] Buckley, how dare you?

1898
01:41:32,211 --> 01:41:35,055
Are you challenging me? Are
you questioning my power?

1899
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:37,054
[Tom] We fill our
heads with noise.

1900
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:39,682
Stay where you are. Do
you want me to hurt you?

1901
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:44,891
We renounce ever
knowing ourselves.

1902
01:41:44,974 --> 01:41:48,274
But you can't deny
yourself forever.

1903
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:49,194
Isn't that right?

1904
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:51,068
Buckley!

1905
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:53,696
Don't you dare ignore me!

1906
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:56,653
Time goes on.

1907
01:41:56,736 --> 01:41:59,615
And you think you have
all the time in the world,

1908
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:01,040
that nothing is final...

1909
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:02,788
But time goes on.

1910
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:04,494
Stay where you are.
Don't take another step.

1911
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:05,874
You're playing with fire,
I'm telling you.

1912
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:07,580
You're playing with fire!

1913
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:10,257
But in the end, so much
time has gone by...

1914
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:12,802
And you know you should
have done something,

1915
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,720
and then you wake up.

1916
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:17,093
Don't you know the kind of
force you're up against?

1917
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:18,766
It's already over.

1918
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:20,764
- Stay where you are!
- Margaret never knew.

1919
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:22,220
I don't think you don't know
what you're up against.

1920
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:24,146
I never told her.
She never knew.

1921
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:25,518
Don't come any closer.

1922
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:27,145
And now everything is a lie!

1923
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:29,352
Don't come any closer!
I'm warning you!

1924
01:42:29,435 --> 01:42:32,814
Did you know all along, Simon Silver?
Did you know?

1925
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:34,649
[SCREAMS] Buckley! Buckley!

1926
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:37,531
That's all I want to know.
Did you know all along?

1927
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:39,032
Buckley!

1928

[thunder]

1929
01:42:40,196 --> 01:42:40,822

[animal-like growl]

1937
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:07,366
How did you do that?

1938
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:11,041
[scoffs]

1939
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,313
Phoney.

1940
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:35,736
How did you do that?

1941
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:40,528
Simon, come with me.

1942
01:44:40,608 --> 01:44:42,656
How did you do that?

1943
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:49,542
How did you do that?

1944
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,768
<i>[Tom] Dear Margaret,</i>

1945
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:23,326
<i>Even today I'm not exactly
sure when everything ended.</i>

1946
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:29,203
<i>I wanted to cry,
to feel anger, grief}</i>

1947
01:45:29,281 --> 01:45:32,535
<i>to feel,</i>

1948
01:45:32,618 --> 01:45:34,712
<i>just like I used to.</i>

1949
01:45:38,207 --> 01:45:42,383
<i>A whole life denying myself I</i>

1950
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:45,590
<i>searching in silence
for someone like me.</i>

1951
01:45:48,634 --> 01:45:52,104
<i>A whole life
looking for an answer,</i>

1952
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:56,900
<i>without finding it.</i>

1953
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,989
<i>I /earned so many things
from you.</i>

1954
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:13,410
<i>But I forgot
the most essential thing.</i>

1955
01:46:13,492 --> 01:46:15,995
How did you know that?

1956
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:18,297
Because I'm psychic.

1957
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:19,373
Silver?

1958
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:20,708
[smash]

1959
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:23,089
It was me all along,

1960
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:28,056
wasn't it, Margaret?

1961
01:46:28,132 --> 01:46:30,476
[Margaret] Where did
you spring from?

1962
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:32,349
Why are you with me?

1963
01:46:32,428 --> 01:46:34,271
[Tom] It was me...

1964
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:39,351
all along.

1965
01:46:43,814 --> 01:46:46,488
You can't deny
yourself forever.

1966
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:50,663
You did most of the magic
by looking in the wrong place.

1967
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:54,792
I did what you'd have wanted.

1968
01:46:54,867 --> 01:47:02,867
But I'll never forgive myself
for not revealing myself,

1969
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:08,551
for not at least giving
you the consolation

1970
01:47:08,631 --> 01:47:10,258
of knowing...

1971
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:16,601
there is something else.

1972

[flat beep]

1973
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:24,981
But you deserve more.

1974
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:34,116
Today you deserve everything.

1975
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:48,178
You can't deny yourself.

1976
01:47:55,094 --> 01:47:57,688
You can't deny
yourself forever.
