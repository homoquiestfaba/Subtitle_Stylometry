00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,116
DAMN, FROGGY.

2
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,084
YOU FUCKING
RETARDED OR WHAT?

3
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,387
HE GRABBED IT.
- "HE GRABBED IT."

4
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:24,023
- YOU SHOT HIM IN THE FUCKING FACE.
- SO?

5
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,758
LOOK AT
HIS HAND.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,093
YEAH, YOU SHOT
HIS HAND TOO.

7
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,294
GRABBED IT
THOUGH.

8
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,598
THIS IS GONNA MAKE WAVES
FOR US, FROGGY.

9
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,534
YOU KNOW
WHO HE WORKS FOR?

10
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,241
ALWAYS ON EVERYBODY ELSE.

11
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,479
ALL RIGHT.
WE GOTTA BOUNCE.

12
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,518
JEEZ, IT'S ALL BLOODY.

13

OH. HEY. I WANT YOU TO
STASH THAT SHIT, GO HOME.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,402
DON'T TALK TO ANYONE ELSE.
OKAY, FROGGY?

15
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,545
YOU JUST GONNA
LEAVE HIM HERE?

16
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,616
UNLESS YOU HAVE A MAGIC BAG
TO STUFF HIM IN, YEAH.

17
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,152
IT'S JUST ANOTHER
DEAD HUSTLER, HOMEY.

18
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,255
AND WHAT ABOUT WHITEY?

19
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,302
WHEN IT COMES
TO HER BUSINESS,

20
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,572
MY MAMA DON'T LIKE
NO PUBLICITY.

21
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,543
AND WHAT YOU DID
WAS A BIG NO-NO, <i>ESE.</i>

22
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,482
WHO HAS HER MONEY, <i>PUTO?</i>

23
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,091
IS IT LOYALTY?

24
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,061
<i>QUE</i> CUTE.

25
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,496
BROTHERHOOD
AND ALL THAT.

26
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,096
THAT LOYALTY'S A BITCH.

27
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,839
TELL ME WHO
YOUR SIDEKICK IS

28
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,807
AND NO MORE PAIN,
<i>CARNALITO.</i>

29

33
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,540
DONATO.

34
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,410

OKAY, SHH.

37
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,127
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITH YOU, MR. FROGGY?

38
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,564
YOU CAN'T KEEP A SECRET.

39
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,569
AND MAMA DON'T LIKE
NO <i>RATAS.</i>

40
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,994

00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,630
THEY MULTIPLY.

42
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,899
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

43
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,138
NO!

44
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,029

00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,967
YOU GOTTA RELAX THOUGH,

47
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,969
RELAXING AIN'T GONNA
GET THIS PLACE PAID.

48
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,541
HAVE SOME FUN
FOR YOURSELF, LUPE.

49
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,843
I SWEAR, YOU WORK

50
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,811
CHILL.

51
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,784

52
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,324
WELL, I'M DOING JUST FINE.

53

JUST DON'T GET
YOUR FINE ASS

54
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,861
KNOCKED UP BY YOUR
ASPIRING HUSTLER.

55
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,730
WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?

56
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,599
WHY YOU GOTTA BE

00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,003

58
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,709
I JUST WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.

59
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,780

I'LL HURT YOU BACK.

68
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,889
I'M NOT GONNA HURT

70
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:30,095
I'M JUST SAYING.
YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

- BABE.

76
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,825
<i>HEY.</i>

DON'T WORRY
ABOUT HER, OKAY?

78
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,796
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO BE MY MOM.

79
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,401
ISAIAH.

80
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,703
I'M RIGHT HERE, BABY.

81
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,674
I JUST CAN'T
SHAKE IT, BABE.

82
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,410
YOU CAN'T SHAKE WHAT?

83
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,879
ISAIAH,

84
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,447
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

85
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,721
WITH THE RIGHT
AMOUNT OF MONEY,

86
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,190
WE CAN DO ANYTHING.

87
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,767
THAT'S MONEY.

I ALWAYS SEE YOU TWO.

118
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,965
SEEN YOU WALKING HAND IN HAND
DOWN BY THE OLD BRIDGE.

119
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:40,038
AND I OFTEN WONDER WHAT
THAT WOULD BE LIKE, <i>ESE.</i>

120
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,045
TO HAVE ME A <i>FIRME</i><i>

JUST LIKE THAT.

122
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,125
YOU BEEN DANCING WITH THE
DEVIL AGAIN, HAVEN'T YOU?

123
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,596
RENDER UNTO <i>DONA</i><i>
<i>THAT WHICH BELONGS TO DONA</i>

124
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,566
AND UNTO GOD
THAT WHICH BELONGS TO GOD.

125
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,738
- WHITEY, NOT HERE.
- DO NOT CALL ME THAT.

126
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,309
ONLY <i>MI PLEBE</i> CALL ME THAT.

- SHH SHH SHH.

131
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,354
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS LOCKED UP,

132
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,723
MY <i>JEFITA,</i>

133
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:35,059
SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO
TOOK THE TIME TO COME AND VISIT.

134
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:38,730
SHE HAD MY BACK WHEN
NO ONE ELSE GAVE A RAT'S ASS.

135
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:42,367
AND THESE LITTLE THINGS,
THEY'RE TATTOOED ON <i>MI CORAZON.</i>

136
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,270
THAT'S WHY I TAKE IT
VERY PERSONAL

137
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,073
WHEN A LITTLE <i>PUNETA</i><i>
<i>SUCH AS YOURSELF</i>

138
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,342
DECIDES TO BURN <i>MI JEFITA.</i>

00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,645
<i>NOW YOU GOTTA DEAL</i>
<i>WITH THE FUCKING DEVIL.</i>

YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES IN LIFE...

141
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,492
WE SEE THINGS AND WE-

142
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,461
WE WONDER,

143
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,131
"AM I REALLY SEEING
WHAT I'M SEEING?

144
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,768
IS IT AN ILLUSION?

145
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,803
A VISION?

146
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:22,740
OR AM I JUST MAKING IT UP
IN MY MIND?"

147
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,276
LOOK AT ME WHEN
I'M TALKING TO YOU, <i>CHAVALO.</i>

148
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,314
IT'S TIME.

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,828
THIS IS WHAT
I WANNA SEE.

150
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,097
<i>IS THIS HOW IT IS?</i>

151
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,068
YOU WANNA GET <i>LOCO?</i>

152
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,070
WELL, LET'S ALL GET <i>LOCO.</i>

153
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,771
<i>TOMA.</i>

154
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,208
YOU FIRST.

155
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,556
OOPS.

00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,229
<i>ITOMALO!</i>

157
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,834
ELECTRIFIED, TERRIFIED,

00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:01,739
- <i>MORTIFIED CRIES</i>
<i>SATURATE THE NIGHT SKY.</i><i>

159
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:05,176
SHRIEK AFTER SHRIEK
SYMBOLIZE MY DEMISE.

160
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:08,212
TRUDGING THE STREETS,
MY FACE A DISGUISE.

161
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,848
<i>UNDER THE BRIDGE</i>
<i>IS WHERE I RESIDE,</i>

162
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,718
<i>SHOOTING THE FIX</i>
<i>JUST TO SURVIVE.</i>

163
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,220
<i>AWAITING TO EXIT</i>
<i>THIS WORLD I DESPISE.</i>

164
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,623
SEARCHING FOR TRUTH

00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,392
BENEATH THE SURFACE LIES.

166
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,294
HELLACIOUS FIXATIONS.

167
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,297
DARKNESS, DAMNATION.
IN LIFE I DESCEND

168
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,467
AND IN DEATH I ARISE!

169
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,635
MY MIND HAS BEEN RUNNING

170
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,371

171
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:49,507
BUT I AM BLESSED.

172
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,043
THE BOND BETWEEN
LIFELONG FRIENDS

173
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:55,079
IS NOTHING
LESS THAN BEAUTIFUL.

174
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,048
- <i>RESPETO.</i><i>

00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,829
YOU SENT HIM?

178
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,564
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

179
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,467
I LOVED HIM.

180
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,036
OKAY?
I LOVED HIM

181
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,439
- AND YOU TOOK HIM FROM ME!

182
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:24,041
FUCKING BITCH!
DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME!

183
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:27,445
YOU TOOK HIM FROM ME,
YOU SICK WICKED BITCH!

184
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,113
YOU DARE...

185
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:32,049
YOU TOOK THE ONLY PERSON
THAT EVER CARED ABOUT ME.

186
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,985
- GET HER OUT OF MY SIGHT.
- <i>FUCKING MURDERER!</i>

187
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,621
YOU BETTER FUCKING KEEP
YOUR DOG ON A LEASH,

188
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:40,458
- YOU FUCKING-

189
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,094
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
<i>MIJITA,</i> HUH?

I REMEMBER YOU!

191
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,533
DO WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO, BITCH!

192
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,403
DO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.
I'M RIGHT FUCKING HERE, <i>CABRONA!</i>

<i>DO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO! I'M</i>
RIGHT FUCKING HERE,  <i>CABRONA.</i>

195
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,485
ALICIA.

196
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,723
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STAYING
AT ISAIAH'S TONIGHT.

197
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,196
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

198
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,536
HEY, YOU WANNA
TALK TO ME?

199
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,571
NO, I'M GOOD.

200
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,608
- WHAT HAPPENED?

201
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,213
NOTHING.

202
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:19,650
OKAY? I'M ALL RIGHT. I GOT IT.

203
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,820
IT'S HIM, ISN'T IT?

204
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,125
THIS IS BULLSHIT, ALICIA.

205
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,928
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GET YOUR
SITUATION UNDER CONTROL?

206
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,031
DON'T DO THAT.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

207
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:38,102
I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO YOU
'CAUSE ALL YOU DO IS JUDGE!

208
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:40,070
YOU SAY, "TALK TO ME"?

209
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,740
YOU DON'T EVEN
FUCKING LISTEN.

210
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:46,677
ALL YOU GIVE A FUCK ABOUT
IS YOU, THAT'S IT.

211
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,746
WHO'S ALWAYS BEEN HERE
FOR YOU?

212
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:52,550
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SHIT
ALONE FOR FIVE FUCKING YEARS!

213
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:56,153
AND ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU TO GET
YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS AND SNAP.

214
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,664
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

215
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,900
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW ME.

216
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,137
AND YOU PROBABLY
NEVER WILL.

217
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,576
DON'T FUCKING WALK AWAY FROM
ME. I'M TALKING TO YOU HERE.

218
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,743
DON'T TOUCH ME.

219
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,848
- LEAVE ME ALONE.
- ALICIA!

220
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,593
MOVE, LUPE!

221
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,233
RIGHT, IF YOU LEAVE NOW...

222
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,038
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT COMING BACK.

223
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,042
<i>¿OISTE?</i>

224
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,929
HOW'S THE FOOD?

225
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,299
- REALLY GOOD, <i>MAMA.</i><i>

226
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,368
GRACIAS

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,370
ANYTHING FOR YOU,
MIJITO.

228
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,017
HOW DID
EVERYTHING GO?

229
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,686
<i>MUY SUAVE.</i>

230
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,324
¿DE VERAS? MUY SUAVE.

ANYTHING YOU, UM,
WANNA TELL ME?

232
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,702
NO.

233
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,837
<i>EVERYTHING</i>
<i>WENT SMOOTH.</i>

234
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,847
ARE YOU LYING TO ME?

235
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,450
- NO, <i>MAMA.</i><i>
- <i>- MM.</i>

236
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,892
DID YOU PICK UP MY MONEY?

237
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,807
THINGS DIDN'T
GO SO SMOOTH, DID THEY?

238
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,177
WHAT DID YOU DO?

239
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,981
<i>¿HIJO?</i>

240
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,484
<i>EL TERMINO.</i>

IDESGRACIADO!

242
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,459
YOU LEFT ME WITH A
FUCKING MESS TO DEAL WITH.

243
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:53,130
HUH?
UNA HEDIONDA, JODIDA, FEA...

244
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:56,967
SHE CAME IN HERE AND SHE
ALMOST CRACKED MY HEAD OPEN, UH?

245
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:59,103
NOW SHE'S A WITNESS!

246
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,807
YOU'D BETTER

00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,076
PICK UP YOUR <i>MARRANADAS.</i>

248
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,945
<i>BEFORE I DO.</i>

249
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,247
YOU BETTER FIND HER.

250
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:15,486
SOMEBODY HAS TO CARE FOR THAT
FUCKING LITTLE <i>PUTA.</i>

251
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:14,938

HEY, DO WHAT
YOU GOTTA DO.

255
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,949
I DON'T WANNA GO.

256
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,586
I COULD GO WITH YOU.

257
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,055
OH, BULLSHIT, ALICIA.
I AM GOING WITH YOU.

258
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,924

00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,630
JUST DON'T TELL
MY SISTER, OKAY?

261
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,665
SHE DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

262
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,901
PROMISE ME, DRE.

263
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,536

<i>¿TU SABES?</i>

271
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,328

00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,170
<i>WHO IS IT?</i>

273
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,176

WHERE'S MY BROTHER?

277
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,662
WELL, LOOK WHAT

00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:43,907
ONLY IF IT BURNS.

284
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,709
<i>ESPERATE.</i>

285
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,910

00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,248
<i>IT WAS LIKE SHE WAS BURIED</i>
<i>IN THAT TREE FOR YEARS.</i>

298
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,615
SHE'S BEEN DODGING.

299
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:01,518
LUPE, I'M NOT GETTING
IN THAT MIX.

300
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,486
HER BUSINESS
IS HER BUSINESS.

301
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,422
ALICIA'S MY BUSINESS.

302
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,958

<i>OH MY GOD.</i><i>

THEY'D JUST WRECK IT.

339
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,424
THEY'D CHARGE ADMISSION
AND SELL T-SHIRTS.

352
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:56,553
MAN. THIS WORLD
IS SO DIFFERENT.

353
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:59,055
DO YOU THINK YOUR SISTER
WILL BE ALL RIGHT?

354
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,459
YEAH.

355
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,614
WHAT DO YOU THINK, LUPE?

356
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,488
THEY SAY THERE'S
A <i>REMEDIO</i> FOR EVERYTHING,

357
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,256
EXCEPT FOR DEATH.

358
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,260
ALL RIGHT, HEADS UP.
HOT STUFF COMING THROUGH.

359
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:38,962
ALL RIGHT.
<i>SIENTENSE.</i>

360
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,267
<i>WHEW.</i>

361
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,008
YOU WANT TO SAY
THE PRAYER?

362
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,011
NO, I'M GOOD.

363
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,614
<i>ANDALE.</i>  <i>I'M</i>
HUNGRIER <i>THAN A HOSTAGE.</i>

364
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,683
GO AHEAD.

365
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,526
OH, DIVINE CREATOR,

366
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:13,596
LET US GIVE THANKS
FOR THIS FANTASTIC FEAST.

367
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:16,633
LET THE FRUIT OF YOUR EARTH
NOURISH THE WEAK,

368
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:18,902
Y POR FAVOR...

369
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:22,939
AYUDA A ADAN Y SU GRUMPO.

370
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:26,643
EN EL NOMBRE DEL PADRE,
EL HIJO Y EL ESPIRITU SANTO,

371
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:28,311
AMEN.

372
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:29,779
<i>AMEN.</i>

373
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,961
ALICIA?

374
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,638
ALICIA?

375
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:26,229
HMM. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE YOUR SISTER.

376
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,299
- WHO LET YOU IN?
- THE DOOR WAS OPEN.

377
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,370
<i>IS SHE HERE?</i>

378
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:36,339
I CAME
TO BLAZE HER OUT.

379
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,178
GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

380
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:46,816
THAT IS NO WAY TO TREAT
YOUR COMPANY, YOUNG LADY.

381
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,701
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

382
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,890
YOU GONNA BLAZE IT UP?

383
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,727
THATTAGIRL.

384
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,967
I WANT TO HELP.

385
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,468
I REALLY DO.

386
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,505
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

387
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:17,406
I MADE MY SHARE.

388
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:20,276
NOW I'M NOT ONE
TO HOLD A GRUDGE,

389
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,211
SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT.

390
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,522
YOU TELL ME WHERE I
CAN FIND YOUR SISTER...

391
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,159
AND I PROMISE
THIS WILL BE

392
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:38,528
- <i>THE LAST TIME</i>
<i>WE EVER SHARE COMPANY.</i><i>

393
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,064
SHE'S GONE.

394
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,979
NO TIME FOR GAMES, BABY.

395
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:04,020
I FUCKING HATE THAT.

396
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,290
THE THING ABOUT
THE <i>PINIS,</i>

397
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:09,892
- IT KIND OF KILLS
YOUR TASTE FOR GAMES.

398
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:13,596
I MEAN, WHAT CAN COMPARE WITH
CHEATING DEATH ON THE DAILY?

399
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,066
IT'S ADRENALINE
OVERLOAD SHIT.

400
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:21,404
IF YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE WITH A KNIFE
AT YOUR THROAT DAY IN, DAY OUT...

401
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:25,875
YOU GET USED TO IT.

402
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,980
MAYBE EVEN GROW
FOND OF IT.

403
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:36,853
LIKE A BEAUTY MARK.

404
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,423
WHERE IS SHE?

405
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:42,959
WE GOT INTO A FIGHT.

406
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:46,295
SHE LEFT. DON'T YOU
FUCKING DARE HURT HER.

407
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:39,348
- SPARKITY SPARK IT.

408
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,119
COOL DUDE- ISAIAH.

409
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:46,088
JUST TRIED TO STEP UP TOO
FAST IN THE GAME, YOU KNOW?

410
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:52,662
<i>MIRA.</i>  FILLED WITH ALL THE NAMES
OF THE KIDS WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH?

411
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:55,031
THIS FUCKER'S
GETTING THICK, MAN.

412
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,968
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT FOOL PASSED, <i>ESE.</i>

413
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,003
THAT <i>VATO</i> WAS CRAZY, MAN.

414
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:03,105
- <i>CRAZY, YOU KNOW?</i><i>
<i>- HE WAS COOL THOUGH.</i>

415
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,408
<i>YEAH WELL...</i><i>
<i>- YOU KNOW, OLD SCHOOL G.I.</i>

416
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,977
- <i>JUST HOPE</i>
<i>THE ANGELS GUIDE HIM.</i><i>

417
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:09,278
LUPE.

418
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:13,316
- LATERS, BABE.
- LATERS.

419
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,728
LUPE.
<i>¿QUE ESTA PASANDO?</i>

420
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,530
IS DRE HERE?

421
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:29,565
DON'T I GET A HUG
OR WHAT?

422
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,104
- IS SHE HERE?
- HUH-UH.

423
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,507
SHE AIN'T
AT THE TAT SHOP.

424
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,178
WELL, SHE WENT WITH
HER GRANDMA TO SALTA.

425
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,380
WHAT'S UP?
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

426
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,651
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

427
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,721
<i>LUPE!</i>

428
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,392
TALK TO ME.
I'M RIGHT FUCKING HERE.

429
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,097
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

430
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:06,535
WHAT, YOU CAN'T SAY WHAT YOU'VE
GOTTA SAY IN FRONT OF JESSE BONEZ?

431
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:09,171
FUCK THAT PUSSY.
THIS IS MY FUCKING SHOP.

432
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,773
WE KICK BACK.

433
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,746
WE SMOKE CHRON.
WE DO WHAT WE GOTTA DO.

434
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,086
NO, I'M GOOD.

435
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:28,290
<i>FUCK. HOLD ON.</i>

436
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,027

00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:33,062
LUPE. HEY.

438
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,232
ARE YOU GONNA FUCKING
HELP ME OR NOT?

439
00:50:36,234 --> 00:50:37,733
WHAT'S UP?

440
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:42,538
- WHAT?
- YOU ALWAYS SAID, "COME TO ME," IF I EVER NEEDED ANYTHING,

441
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,107
ANYTHING AT ALL.
WELL, I'M COMING TO YOU.

442
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,410

- WHAT DO YOU NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR?

443
00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:49,412
FUCKING TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

444
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:52,782
I'VE NEVER PUT YOU ON A SPOT
LIKE THIS BEFORE, NEVER BEFORE.

445
00:50:52,784 --> 00:50:55,084
YOU COME OVER HERE
TO MY SHOP,

446
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:58,354
YOU ASK ME FOR A FUCKING <i>CUETE</i>  <i>AND YOU</i>
CAN'T EVEN TELL ME <i>WHAT THE FUCK IT'S FOR?</i>

447
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:00,356
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE IT THEN, RIGHT?

448
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:05,461
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP ME,

449
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:10,066
- I SEE HOW IT IS. - YOU
GONNA TELL ME- HEY, LUPE.

450
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,535
- WHAT?
- DON'T FUCKING BE LIKE THAT.

451
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:22,244
SEE THAT? THAT'S ONE IN THE CHAMBER.

452
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,214
IT MEANS
YOU GOT FIRE, <i>CHICA.</i>

453

REMEMBER YOU CAN'T
UN-RING A BELL.

454
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:30,386
I JUST NEED IT
JUST FOR IN CASE.

455
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:33,622
ARE YOU SURE?

456
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,826
YEAH.

<i>CUIDADO.</i>

458

459
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:59,381
YOU KNOW HIM.

460
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:01,650
HE'S GONNA WORK
HIMSELF TO DEATH.

461
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,185
MM.

462
00:52:03,187 --> 00:52:04,854
<i>MAS ATRAS.</i>

463
00:52:04,856 --> 00:52:07,189

<i>MERO LEON DEL TRABAJO.</i>

465
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:12,294
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN
THEY USED TO CALL HIM THAT.

466
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,231
OH, WE'RE ALL LINKED HERE,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

467
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:16,899
EITHER BY BLOOD

468
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:20,236
OR BY... SUFFERING.

469
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,206
TIMES ARE
DIFFERENT NOW.

470
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:28,144
PEOPLE TODAY, THEY JUST
DON'T HAVE ANY RESPECT.

471
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:32,148
HERE, THEY LEARN HOW
TO KEEP SECRETS.

472
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:42,291
TELL ME ABOUT GUADALUPE.

473
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,595
OH, COME ON.

474
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:49,331
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU
COULD KEEP THAT ONE FROM ME,

475
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,500
DID YOU,
ADANCITO?

476
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,204
WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW?

477
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,507
I JUST WANNA
SPEAK TO HER.

478
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,879
AW, WE'RE JUST GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

479
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:05,848

500
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:30,559
DON'T WORRY.
I SENT HER AWAY.

501
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,002
YOU NEED TO EAT.

I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU.

698
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:54,188
WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO SLEEP, BABY BRO?

699
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,426
GO TO SLEEP, BABY BRO.

700
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:01,929
GO TO SLEEP.
AND NO FUCKING TAPPING OUT.

701
01:20:10,006 --> 01:20:11,505
YOU FUCKING BITCH!

702
01:20:11,507 --> 01:20:13,207
YOU FUCKER!

703
01:20:13,209 --> 01:20:15,042
I'M GONNA FUCKING
KILL YOU!

704
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,379
I'M GONNA FUCK YOU UP!

705
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:20,247
FUCKING BITCH.

706
01:20:24,587 --> 01:20:26,220
LUPE!

707
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:41,168
NOTHING LASTS FOREVER, BABY.

708
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:44,104
YOU REMIND ME OF MY MAMA-

709
01:20:44,106 --> 01:20:46,307
- BATSHIT CRAZY.

710
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:48,609
OH, BUT YOU GOT A FIRE.

711
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:50,044
I LIKE THAT.

712
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:55,549
WHAT MAMA DON'T KNOW
WON'T HURT HER.

713
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:03,958
<i>... GIVE A FUCK ABOUT IS YOU!</i>

714
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,860
<i>- I'M HER MOTHER.</i>
<i>- I'M ALL SHE'S FUCKING GOT!</i>

715
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:43,223
CARE FOR A <i>FRAJO?</i>

716
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:59,139
MY FATHER BELIEVED
IN KARMA.

717
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:02,142
YOU BELIEVE
IN KARMA?

718
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:07,014
WELL, HE DIDN'T
EXACTLY CALL IT KARMA.

719
01:23:07,016 --> 01:23:09,049
HE CALLED IT
SOMETHING ELSE.

720
01:23:09,051 --> 01:23:12,119
MORE OR LESS
THE SAME THING.

721
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,123
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW.

722
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:18,192
WHAT GOES AROUND,

723
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:20,094
COMES AROUND.

724
01:23:20,096 --> 01:23:21,762
YOU UNDERSTAND?

725
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:25,766
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN KARMA, PER SE.

726
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:30,004
BUT I DO BELIEVE
IN JUSTICE.

727
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:33,107
MORE OR LESS THE SAME THING,
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

728
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:35,709
IT'S JUST THAT ONE

729
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:38,245
IS LEVIED BY GOD,

730
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:40,147
THE UNIVERSE,

731
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:41,749
WHAT-NOT,

732
01:23:41,751 --> 01:23:44,084
IN GOD'S TIMING.

733
01:23:44,086 --> 01:23:46,020
AND THE OTHER

734
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:48,322
IS DELIVERED BY MAN.

735
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:50,758
OR IN THIS CASE

736
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,060
A WOMAN

737
01:23:53,062 --> 01:23:55,329
AND A SNAKE.

738
01:23:55,331 --> 01:23:57,798
POSITIVELY MYTHICAL.

739
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,209
<i>SUENOS DULCES, FANTASMA.</i>

740
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,746
SWEET DREAMS.

741
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,085
<i>OYE...</i>

742
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:20,154
YOUR MAMA WILL
COME HERE SOON

743
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:21,789
TO TUCK YOU IN.

744
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:01,355
<i>A VOLAR, BRUJO.</i>

745
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,307
<i>IBRUJO!</i>

746
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:57,311
<i>I COME TO MAKE</i>
<i>MY PEACE.</i>

747
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,281
WHERE'S <i>MI HIJO?</i>

748
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,389
<i>IBRUJO!</i>

749
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:13,660
- ANSWER ME!

750
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:20,234
<i>SERIO.</i>

751
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:59,366
THERE'S A <i>REMEDIO</i><i>
<i>FOR EVERYTHING,</i>

752
01:29:00,468 --> 01:29:02,102
EXCEPT FOR DEATH.

753
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,518
YOU!

754
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:22,489
<i>IPUTA!</i>

755
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:26,746
THE SCENT
NEVER LEAVES YOU.

756
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:34,554
I CAN STILL
SMELL MOM SOMETIMES-

757
01:31:34,556 --> 01:31:36,990
HER CINNAMON GUM

758
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,758
AND HER PERFUME.

759
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:45,532
YEAH.

760
01:31:45,534 --> 01:31:47,267
SOMETHING ABOUT
THE SMELL THAT JUST

761
01:31:47,269 --> 01:31:50,270
DIGS ITSELF DEEP.

762
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:58,979
<i>AMO</i> LIKE FUCK,
MY BABY SISTER.

763
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,768
LET'S GO.

764
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:23,303
IT'S TIME.
