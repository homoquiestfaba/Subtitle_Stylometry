$20 ain't going to make it this time, man.

57
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:28,186
This is big, and I'm taking a real big risk.

58
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,680
How much you want, Louie?

59
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:36,874

It's the kind of deal that gives cops like you a hard on.

65
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:50,222
Well, I'll give you $50.

66
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,681
Listen to me, you son of a bitch,

67
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,280
you're not going anywhere.

68
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:54,984
You dragged me out of my house on my night off.

69
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:56,270
You better have a story for me.

00:06:58,702 --> 00:07:00,752
$200 pays for two weeks my life.

73
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:04,680
You wouldn't risk your life for $200 for the room and board.

74
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:05,932
I do it all the time.

75

I'm a cop, remember.

76
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:08,540
Yeah, well, you've got a job.

00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:10,277
I'm half blind. I'm crippled.

78

Don't mention it.

The warehouse, be there at 2,300 hours.

89
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:52,228
Do you think it's wise to be driving this van around?

90
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,001
Don't ever question me, Whitney.

91

Easy, baby, I was just kidding.

101
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:30,635
It was a joke, OK?

00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,476
I'll get my own beer .

Hey, dinner smells great.

110
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:57,085
I'm starving.

111
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:58,197
When do we eat?

112
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:00,942
It's almost ready, and don't you

113
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:03,306
go stuffing yourself either, because I don't want

114

You remember when he told us his definition of a friend?

179

00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,251
no questions asked.

185
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:08,039
So what's your definition of a wife?

186
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,472
Somebody who will put up with this BS?

187
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:14,295
Somebody who will go along without complaining?

188
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,883
Bill, don't you see?

189
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,830
Sometimes I have to come first.

190
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:25,313
Diane.

191
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:26,287

193
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:38,035
I don't see much going on here, partner.

194
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,668
Are you sure this is for real?

195
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:41,023
We're early.

196
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,812
I told you the deal goes down at 11:00.

197
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:48,392
I can't believe you gave Lanky Louie $200.

198
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:50,512
We need to get inside here.

199
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:53,501
How do you want to do this?

200
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,551
Through the use of high technology.

201
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:57,117
[breaking glass]

202
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:01,912
What?

203
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:03,165
I don't believe you did that.

204
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:05,736
It's just a little broken glass.

205
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,412
Which the city is going to have to pay for.

206
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:09,767
Hey, forget the city.

207
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,950
You pay for it.

208
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:12,513
You gave Lanky Louie $200.

209
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:15,433
You shouldn't mind shelling out for a pane of glass.

00:13:29,718 --> 00:13:32,186
You put the ring in a safe place I hope.

What?

213
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,357
I said, you put the ring in a safe place, right?

214
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:37,990
I don't know what you're taking about.

215
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,081
I said, you put the ring in a safe place, right?

216
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:47,618
Yes, I put the ring in a safe place.

217
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:51,511
And yes, I rented my tux, and yes, I paid for the wedding.

219
00:13:54,848 --> 00:13:56,306
I just don't want anything to go wrong.

That's all.

221
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,860
I mean, this wedding means so much to Diane and to me.

222
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:02,911
It's one of those things you only do one time in your life.

223
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:07,082
So it might as well be right, right?

224
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:09,445
Hey, man, are you getting any of this?

225
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,418
Yeah.

226
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:14,311
Yeah, I hear you.

227
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:18,969
Listen, Bill, I know I really screwed stuff up for you

228
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,880
and Diane tonight.

229
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,270
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:27,971
She'll get over it, I hope.

231
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:32,523
This is going to make you a big hero.

232
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:33,497
She'll be proud of you.

Ammo clips, fully loaded.

236
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:13,920
Neil, what have we stumbled onto here?

237
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:17,291
Another ad scam.

238
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:18,298
I don't know.

239
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:26,083
There's enough firepower here to destroy half the city.

240
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:29,072
I think we better call for backup.

Get to it.

244
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:00,772
Yes, um, I--

245
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,837
well, everything looks secure.

246
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:08,488
I suppose I'll start with the inventory.

247
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,538

The driver's getting nervous.

250
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:50,717
He wants to know how much longer.

You tell that chickenshit if you don't stop asking

254
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:04,690
After I finished with him, he won't be able to walk.

255
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:05,698
Got that?

256
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:07,679

I want this stuff loaded and rolling in 10 minutes.

261
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:17,680
Maybe this is some of the Libyan terrorists we've

262
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:19,834
been hearing so much about.

263
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:23,588
They're not speaking with an accent.

264
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:27,967
Maybe the Libyans are recruiting local talent.

265
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:28,904
Maybe.

266
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,472
You're holding up my men, Bill.

Yes, sir, I realize that, but there seems to be a problem.

00:18:56,954 --> 00:18:59,561
In addition to the missing hand grenades, one of the crates

269
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,855
has been tampered with.

270
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,409
Two of the rifles are missing.

Because I wouldn't want to miss that.

I guess it's a little too late to call for a backup.

00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:27,136
Bill!

370
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,777
WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Telephone, please, Dr. Davis.

371
00:25:29,882 --> 00:25:30,959
Telephone, please.

372
00:25:41,768 --> 00:25:42,638
Diane.

373
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:55,845
Hi, Diane.

374
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,992
I called the house earlier.

375
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,322
Did you get my message?

376
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:00,295
Yes.

377
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:07,732
I just wanted to let you know that I'm sorry.

378
00:26:07,836 --> 00:26:09,817
God, I feel responsible.

379
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:11,348
You should.

380
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:14,510
It's because of you that he's in there.

381
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,464
I know.

382
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:20,626
I talked to one of the doctors earlier.

383
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:21,774
They said that there was a chance

384
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:23,790
that he could pull through.

385
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:26,363
Diane, he's not dead yet.

386
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:30,047
It will be easy if he was dead.

387
00:26:30,151 --> 00:26:32,722
At least that way, I would know what to do.

388
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:34,704
I could-- I could get on with my life--

389
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:36,719
Why don't you just leave, man?

390
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:39,778
Can't you see she doesn't want to talk to you?

391
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:42,177
Diane, I promise you I'm going to get those guys that

392
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,331
did this to him.

393
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,834
You are the guy who did this.

394
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,467
[crying]

395
00:26:54,585 --> 00:26:57,157
WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair, Dr.

396
00:26:57,261 --> 00:26:59,833
Jay Hamilton, Dr. Jay Hamilton.

397
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:04,419
Hmm.

398
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:06,367
You all right?

399
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:08,418
Yeah, I'm fine.

400
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:10,156
That's not what I hear.

401
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:14,500
What I hear is that you're going to try to go after Bill's--

402
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:15,473
Bill's assailant.

403
00:27:15,577 --> 00:27:18,532
Well, you heard right.

404
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:22,354
Well, I'm telling you this, mister, as of right now,

405
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:26,039
you are on two weeks leave of absence, two weeks.

406
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,994
I want you to use his time constructively.

407
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,316
I want you to get this unfortunate

408
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,643
incident off your mind.

409
00:27:32,747 --> 00:27:36,536
We all know that you and Bill were very close.

410
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,413
We are close.

411
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:39,978
Everyone around here seems to forget

412
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:41,749
that Bill is not dead yet.

413
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:43,626
All right, sorry.

414
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,482
Look, Bill knew the risk when he took this job.

415
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,046
We all do.

416
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,470
Things like this happen.

417
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:57,808
It happened to Bill, OK?

418
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:00,241
I'm going to get the guy that did this to him.

419
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,325
If that was me laying there in that bed,

420
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:04,133
Bill would do the exact same thing.

421
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:10,633
You're taking this thing too personally.

422
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:12,440
I am going to get the guy that did this

423
00:28:12,544 --> 00:28:15,290
with or without your help, sir.

424
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,341
This guy was a thief, a gun runner,

425
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,573
and now he's an attempted cop killer.

426
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:22,310
He shot my best friend in cold blood.

427
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:27,316
So you do whatever you got to do.

428
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,244
You can take my gun, you take my badge, do it all.

429
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:33,885
I am going to get this guy.

430
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:35,309
Got it?

431
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,361
That's revenge.

432
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,542
What good is it going to do?

433
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:47,614
Why don't you ask her that question?

434
00:28:47,718 --> 00:28:49,248
Diane is pregnant.

435
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:58,248
Do you have any leads?

436
00:28:58,352 --> 00:28:59,396
I've got one.

437
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:10,414
Whatever you want, you've got.

438
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:12,465
[music playing]

439
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:21,363
Hog Farm.

440
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:32,069
No, Hog, H-O-G. Right, like an adult pig, jeez.

441
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:34,606
Judy, you're so quick.

442
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,551
Say, could you, uh, check that out.

443
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:38,847
Yeah it's Hog Farm sausage.

444
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,548
Yeah, check it out, and give me a call.

445
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:41,522
Thank you.

446
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:42,461
Bye.

447
00:29:47,396 --> 00:29:49,550
I, uh, I have something I think

448
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:52,192
should be of special interest to you.

449
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,548
NEIL: What's that?

450
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:58,518
Surveillance tape, Senator Bagley's murder.

451
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:00,395
You've got to be kidding me.

452
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,542
Have a look.

453
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:02,481
Let's do it.

454
00:30:09,814 --> 00:30:10,683
All right.

455
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,801
Show you what you've got here.

456
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:21,562
SENATOR (ON TV): What is it that you want?

457
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:23,543
That your man?

458
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:24,760
Yeah.

459
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:28,062
SENATOR (ON TV): Money, plenty of money.

460
00:30:28,165 --> 00:30:29,765
TERRORIST (ON TV): This is not about money.

461
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,205
The infamous Hand of God we've been hearing so much about.

462
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,299
SENATOR (ON TV): I don't have any here in the office.

463
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:37,725
These guys aren't Libyans.

464
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:40,749
SENATOR (ON TV): I can get you plenty of money .

465
00:30:40,853 --> 00:30:44,641
That's what everyone says who's seen this tape,

466
00:30:44,745 --> 00:30:48,603
must be recruiting our own thugs off the street,

467
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:52,286
using our criminals against us.

468
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,956
You think it's possible the Libyans don't

469
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,050
have anything to do with this?

470
00:30:57,153 --> 00:31:00,281
I think it's very possible.

471
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:02,854
You mind if I hang onto this tape?

472
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:06,816
No, it's fine.

473
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:11,369
You, uh, you just stay in touch, all right?

474
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:20,266
[music playing]

475
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:23,394
TERRORIST (ON TV): This is strictly political.

476
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,212
[static]

477
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:50,783
Neil, open your eyes.

478
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:58,499
Open your eyes.

479
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:01,662
Hi, Bill.

480
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:03,469
Open your eyes.

481
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:08,753
Your brother gets shot, and he's trying to tell you something.

482
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:09,761
He's not your brother?

483
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:16,955
You're right.

484
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:17,964
He's no brother.

485
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:48,619
I think this is everything you requested.

486
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:49,940
Sign the bottom line, please.

487
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:59,046
Give me a holler when you're finished.

488
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,958
Is it all right if I smoke in here?

489
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,209
Sure.

490
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,704
Just don't get caught.

491
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:04,677
NEIL: Got you.

492
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,821
[music playing]

493
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,661
Yeah, you bet, Howard.

494
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,642
I owe you a big one.

495
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:42,735
All righty, bye, bye.

496
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:46,350
Neil, your friend Judy has delivered.

497
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:48,122
They found your pig farm.

498
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,590
NEIL: Great.

499
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,780
Cedar Hills.

500
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:53,823
That sounds familiar.

501
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:54,935
Uh-huh.

502
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,403
It's a couple miles drive south of here.

503
00:33:57,507 --> 00:33:59,906
It's Morgan County.

504
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,547
What do you think it would take to get local cooperation?

505
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:04,144
BURTON: I'm way ahead of you.

506
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:08,142
There's a sheriff down there by the name of Howard Bigelow.

507
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,646
He's, uh, he's going to be waiting for you.

508
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,121
You know, I don't care what they say, you're all right.

509
00:34:14,225 --> 00:34:16,274
Well, maybe you should care.

510
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,909
It's all true.

511
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:22,010
Get the hell out of here.

512
00:34:22,114 --> 00:34:24,061
[music playing]

513
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:40,502
Detective Farrow?

514
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:42,030
Yes.

515
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:43,560
Hi, I'm Detective Webber.

516
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,193
Welcome to Morgan County.

517
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:47,348
Come on, I'll escort you down to the Sheriff's office.

518
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,434
OK, thanks.

519
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:50,721
I'm really looking forward to working

520
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:52,179
with you, Detective Farrow.

521
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:54,231
Please, call me Neil.

522
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:56,038
I've been assigned to help you out

523
00:34:56,142 --> 00:34:57,948
at least during the Morgan County

524
00:34:58,052 --> 00:34:59,965
part of your investigation.

525
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:01,182
Detective Webber, do you mind if I

526
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:03,197
ask you a personal question?

527
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:04,831
Please, call me Jenny.

528
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,083
Jenny.

529
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,021
How old are you?

530
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:11,122
24.

531
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:12,756
24.

532
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,320
Look, Detective Farrow--

533
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:16,161
Neil.

534
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:20,507
Look, Neil, since we're going to be working together,

535
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:22,731
I want to dispel any misgivings you might

536
00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:27,145
have about my age or my sex.

537
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:29,405
I've spent the last six years at Harvard

538
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:31,769
pursuing a master's in criminal law, most

539
00:35:31,872 --> 00:35:34,095
of this year at the Texas Police Academy

540
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:39,276
where I graduated fifth in a class of 267 candidates.

541
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,213
Mhm.

542
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:53,526
Sheriff, this is Detective Farrow from Dallas.

543
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,550
Yes, welcome to Morgan County, Detective.

544
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,147
Nice to meet you, sir.

545
00:35:58,253 --> 00:35:59,921
I just want you to know that Detective Webber and her car

546
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,493
are at your disposal 24 hours a day.

547
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:04,125
Well, I appreciate that.

548
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:07,116
I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I did bring my own car,

549
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,514
and I would prefer to work alone.

550
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:12,260
Hmm, that's out of the question, Detective.

551
00:36:12,364 --> 00:36:15,214
See, we live in a pretty close knit community here,

552
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:16,778
and that's something I'm afraid you

553
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:19,559
wouldn't be familiar with, being from the big city of Dallas

554
00:36:19,663 --> 00:36:20,428
and all.

555
00:36:20,532 --> 00:36:21,851
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

556
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:23,868
SHERIFF: See, I am responsible for your safety

557
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:25,953
while you are down here in Morgan County.

558
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,943
If anything should happen to you, I'd never forgive myself.

559
00:36:29,047 --> 00:36:31,133
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I--

560
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:34,991
Oh, it's more than a concern, Detective, it's an order.

561
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:37,319
Now, this is my jurisdiction.

562
00:36:37,424 --> 00:36:39,753
You understand? - Yes, sir.

563
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:41,352
SHERIFF: Good.

564
00:36:41,456 --> 00:36:43,750
Now, I think you'll find that my niece, Detective Webber,

565
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:48,164
is a very capable law enforcement officer.

566
00:36:48,268 --> 00:36:50,562
You're going to find she is going to be a lot of help

567
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,675
to you.

568
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:56,540
Why don't you two run on now and see what you can come up with?

569
00:37:02,032 --> 00:37:04,326
DETECTIVE WEBBER: Uncle Howard can be a little

570
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,890
difficult to get through to.

571
00:37:05,994 --> 00:37:07,488
NEIL: Uncle Howard?

572
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:09,505
DETECTIVE WEBBER: The Sheriff is my uncle.

573
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:12,355
That doesn't make me any less qualified

574
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:15,135
to help you investigate--

575
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,178
[pig sounds]

576
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:39,013
How could I help you folks?

577
00:37:39,117 --> 00:37:42,767
Yes, Detective Farrow, Dallas Police Department.

578
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:45,548
Detective Webber, Morgan County.

579
00:37:45,652 --> 00:37:46,591
Dallas?

580
00:37:46,695 --> 00:37:48,398
What can I do for you?

581
00:37:48,502 --> 00:37:50,170
We have reason to believe that one of your vans

582
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:52,985
was used in the commission of a felony.

583
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,323
One of our vans?

584
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:57,678
I don't believe I got your name.

585
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,528
I'm Clint, Clint Hardin, foreman here.

586
00:38:00,632 --> 00:38:01,952
Who is it we need to speak with?

587
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:04,142
Milo Truscott.

588
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:06,019
Mr. Truscott is not here.

589
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:07,756
He and an assistant took a horseback ride.

590
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:09,564
I don't know when they'll be back.

591
00:38:09,669 --> 00:38:11,163
Anything I can do?

592
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:12,380
The description of the truck that

593
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:14,327
was used in the crime scene in Dallas

594
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:16,063
matches the one I see over there.

595
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,594
Do you mind if I have a closer look?

596
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:18,532
Sure, come on.

597
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:29,202
What is it you think our truck was used for anyway?

598
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,365
Smuggling stolen weapons from Dallas.

599
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,893
Whoa.

600
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:35,563
How many trucks like this one does the Hog Farm have?

601
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:36,710
We've got two.

602
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,169
The other one is making deliveries

603
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,732
up in the hill country.

604
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:41,749
There's some pretty special ingredients in our sausage.

605
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:45,294
We're real particular about who sells it.

606
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:47,450
Oh, here's Mr. Truscott now.

607
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:49,118
[horse whinny]

608
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:54,088
What's up, Clint?

609
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:59,858
Detective Farrow, Dallas Police, and, uh--

610
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,464
Detective Webber, Morgan County.

611
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:03,749
Detective?

612
00:39:03,853 --> 00:39:05,420
What's all this about?

613
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:07,851
NEIL: Mr. Truscott, I believe that this truck was used

614
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:10,737
to smuggle stolen weapons from a warehouse in Dallas

615
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:13,135
three nights ago.

616
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:16,159
Well, now I've heard everything.

617
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,730
Is this a joke?

618
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:21,303
This is no joke, Mr. Truscott.

619
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:24,014
Can you tell me where the van was three nights ago?

620
00:39:24,118 --> 00:39:27,455
Three nights ago, Monday.

621
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:29,541
Clint, help me out.

622
00:39:29,644 --> 00:39:33,225
Who was using the truck on Monday night?

623
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,753
Milo.

624
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:36,804
Have you been smuggling guns in that sausage of yours?

625
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:41,948
Baby sister Sandra.

626
00:39:42,053 --> 00:39:43,999
You'll have to excuse her sense of humor,

627
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:47,092
but you've got to understand this all seems

628
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:50,325
a little far fetched to us.

629
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,653
David Speer.

630
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,149
Speer had the truck that night.

631
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:58,110
He was supposed be making deliveries over in Tyler.

632
00:39:58,215 --> 00:40:00,405
David Speer?

633
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:03,670
S-P-E-E-R?

634
00:40:03,774 --> 00:40:05,582
Could we speak to Mr. Speer?

635
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:07,322
Sure, if you can find him.

636
00:40:07,426 --> 00:40:09,892
I fired him yesterday for drinking on the job.

637
00:40:09,997 --> 00:40:12,083
Can you tell us his last known address,

638
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:13,960
telephone number, social security

639
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:15,835
number, things of that nature?

640
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,192
Sure.

641
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:18,686
Clint can get you all of that stuff.

642
00:40:26,263 --> 00:40:31,477
You know Detective Farrow and Detective Webber--

643
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:33,458
Webber?

644
00:40:33,562 --> 00:40:36,308
You must be Sheriff Bigelow's niece.

645
00:40:36,412 --> 00:40:38,289
Yes, that's correct.

646
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,132
I believe we met at a fundraiser

647
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:41,175
a couple of years back.

648
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:43,711
Good to see you again.

649
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,388
Thanks.

650
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:48,786
Mr. Truscott, can you think of any reason

651
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:52,957
why David Speer would use your truck to commit a felony?

652
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:56,815
No, in fact, I was about to get to that.

653
00:40:56,919 --> 00:41:00,638
You see, it's no secret that I'm a very political man.

654
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:06,374
I use my money and influence to lobby for causes I believe in.

655
00:41:06,478 --> 00:41:08,945
It's also no secret that I have enemies.

656
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,413
Now, I'm a lot more inclined to believe that someone

657
00:41:11,517 --> 00:41:14,610
deliberately tried to implicate me by dummying up a truck

658
00:41:14,715 --> 00:41:16,070
to look like one of mine.

659
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:17,356
It could be.

660
00:41:17,461 --> 00:41:18,920
This whole thing is strictly political.

661
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:21,873
TERRORIST (VOICEOVER): This is strictly political.

662
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,550
This is strictly political.

663
00:41:24,654 --> 00:41:26,011
This is strictly political.

664
00:41:26,115 --> 00:41:27,054
This is strictly political.

665
00:41:27,158 --> 00:41:28,721
This is strictly political.

666
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:30,286
This is strictly political.

667
00:41:30,391 --> 00:41:31,433
This is strictly political. This is strictly political.

668
00:41:31,537 --> 00:41:32,442
This is strictly political.

669
00:41:32,545 --> 00:41:34,005
This is strictly political.

670
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:35,013
This is strictly political. This is strictly political.

671
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,680
Detective Farrow?

672
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,801
Detective Farrow, are you all right?

673
00:41:38,906 --> 00:41:39,565
Yeah.

674
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:42,798
Yeah, I was just thinking.

675
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:45,717
This David Speer, is he a black man?

676
00:41:45,821 --> 00:41:47,282
No, he's white.

677
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:50,514
Most my employees are black, but old David's a white boy.

678
00:41:50,618 --> 00:41:53,086
Well, the reason I ask that question is because the men who

679
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:58,127
were using the truck were all wearing masks, all but one,

680
00:41:58,231 --> 00:42:00,455
a black man.

681
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,610
Is there a possibility that any of your other men

682
00:42:02,714 --> 00:42:04,974
may have used the truck that night?

683
00:42:05,078 --> 00:42:07,406
Possible, but not likely.

684
00:42:07,511 --> 00:42:10,187
Is there any reason to believe that any of your black workers

685
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:14,774
might have ties with the Libyan group, The Hand of God?

686
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:15,921
[laugh]

687
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:19,120
For crying out loud, Detective, is that what you think?

688
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:25,932
All the black men that work for me are like old Randy

689
00:42:26,036 --> 00:42:27,529
over there.

690
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:30,103
It's a constant tool just to get them to show up for work.

691
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:32,362
They don't have the kind of ambition or energy

692
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,386
it takes to be a terrorist.

693
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,201
Randy, Randy?

694
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,356
Am I telling this detective the God's truth

695
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:42,579
when I say you local niggers are just too

696
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,222
damn lazy for terrorist work?

697
00:42:45,326 --> 00:42:47,064
Yes, sir, Mr. Truscott.

698
00:42:47,169 --> 00:42:48,419
I'm afraid so.

699
00:42:48,523 --> 00:42:50,088
Ain't no since of lying about it.

700
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:52,451
It's got some truth.

701
00:42:52,555 --> 00:42:53,598
Thank you, Randy.

702
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,421
[music playing]

703
00:42:57,524 --> 00:42:58,395
See what I mean?

704
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,589
There you go.

705
00:43:05,693 --> 00:43:07,466
Thank you.

706
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,733
Well, I hope you catch up with that rascal, Speer.

707
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,071
But I think you're going to find that the truck used in Dallas

708
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,816
is not one of mine.

709
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,535
Oh, it was your truck all right.

710
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,586
How can you be sure?

711
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,976
Do you have a license plate number?

712
00:43:26,826 --> 00:43:29,294
No.

713
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:31,101
Well, then.

714
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:32,248
You know what that is?

715
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,399
That's a bullet hole.

716
00:43:38,503 --> 00:43:39,511
I put it there myself.

717
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:44,725
Bravo, Detective.

718
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,124
You have quite a flair.

719
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:48,132
[horse whinny]

720
00:43:51,052 --> 00:43:52,685
We'll be leaving now.

721
00:43:52,789 --> 00:43:54,040
I'm sure we'll talk again.

722
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:55,223
Call any time.

723
00:43:55,327 --> 00:43:57,793
You're always welcome.

724
00:43:57,899 --> 00:43:59,081
Bye now.

725
00:43:59,185 --> 00:44:03,008
I hope to see you again real soon.

726
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:04,432
Bye.

727
00:44:04,537 --> 00:44:06,657
[music playing]

728
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:17,640
Is everybody in this town a bigot?

729
00:44:17,744 --> 00:44:21,427
No, well, I don't know.

730
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:23,654
Look, I don't like it any more than you do.

731
00:44:27,129 --> 00:44:31,334
I don't mind telling you this, it pisses me off.

732
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:33,038
Really?

733
00:44:33,143 --> 00:44:33,977
Really.

734
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,289
You better learn to exercise a little decorum, young lady.

735
00:44:47,392 --> 00:44:49,339
You are a Truscott.

736
00:44:49,443 --> 00:44:50,833
What's wrong, Milo?

737
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,961
Did those detectives make you nervous?

738
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,575
Do not embarrass me in front of strangers, Sandra.

739
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,688
Or what?

740
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:06,787
I want you to keep tabs on Mr. Farrow.

741
00:45:06,891 --> 00:45:08,350
How about Speer?

742
00:45:08,454 --> 00:45:14,781
I want a word with Mr. Speer before he talks to Farrow.

743
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:16,379
[phone ringing]

744
00:45:21,037 --> 00:45:22,046
Farrow speaking.

745
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,470
Yes, Neil.

746
00:45:23,574 --> 00:45:26,633
Yes, this is Burton here.

747
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,892
What did you find out about the pig farm?

748
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:31,222
The truck is there.

749
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:34,592
Some local big shot named Milo Truscott owns the place.

750
00:45:34,696 --> 00:45:37,582
I think he's involved in some local politics or something.

751
00:45:37,686 --> 00:45:40,674
He's involved in all kinds of politics.

752
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,143
The man has big friends in the State Department

753
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:45,574
end in Washington, DC.

754
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:47,313
Well, I'm impressed.

755
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:48,982
He's just a big grinning good old boy,

756
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:51,448
and he's got a big attitude towards blacks.

757
00:45:51,553 --> 00:45:54,161
So what about the truck?

758
00:45:54,265 --> 00:46:00,070
Uh, well, supposedly a guy by the name of David Speer

759
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,085
was driving the truck, and I haven't

760
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,997
been able to locate him yet.

761
00:46:04,101 --> 00:46:05,665
I guess I'll stay here till I do.

762
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:10,079
All right, OK, what about this Truscott character?

763
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,276
You think he has anything to do with the weapons?

764
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,084
I don't know.

765
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,247
I do know one thing, I don't like the son of a bitch.

766
00:46:18,351 --> 00:46:21,443
Listen, the Feds had called in some sort

767
00:46:21,547 --> 00:46:27,110
of Middle Eastern weapons terrorist expert of some such.

768
00:46:27,214 --> 00:46:33,435
His name is Fred Hackerman, Heckerman.

769
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:36,564
Anyway, the guy is in town for a couple of days.

770
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,754
I've schedule a meeting here, a private meeting,

771
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:41,325
at my office 3 o'clock tomorrow.

772
00:46:41,429 --> 00:46:42,716
I want you to be here.

773
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:45,914
Yeah, no sweat.

774
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:48,173
How about Lanky Louie?

775
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:49,807
Has anybody been able to locate him yet?

776
00:46:49,911 --> 00:46:51,128
Yeah.

777
00:46:51,231 --> 00:46:55,090
Old Lanky Louie is hiding out someplace.

778
00:46:55,193 --> 00:46:57,871
And I can't say as I blame him.

779
00:46:57,975 --> 00:46:59,921
[music playing]

780
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:40,900
[door knock]

781
00:47:41,004 --> 00:47:42,359
Who is it?

782
00:47:42,463 --> 00:47:43,540
MAID: Maid, sir.

783
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:50,805
Oh, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,

784
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,438
but we're checking all the rooms on the floor

785
00:47:52,542 --> 00:47:53,863
so you could have fresh towels.

786
00:47:53,968 --> 00:47:56,540
The day maid quit this morning, but I

787
00:47:56,644 --> 00:47:58,834
see we're already too late.

788
00:47:58,938 --> 00:48:00,051
Yeah.

789
00:48:00,154 --> 00:48:01,336
I'll just put these in the bathroom

790
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,213
so you have fresh towels in the morning.

791
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:22,434
Have a pleasant stay, mister--

792
00:48:22,538 --> 00:48:25,909
Farrow, Neil Farrow.

793
00:48:26,015 --> 00:48:26,848
You are?

794
00:48:26,952 --> 00:48:28,551
I'm Caroline.

795
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:32,722
Just holler if you need fresh towels, or anything.

796
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,973
Uh, Caroline?

797
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,580
Yes, sir.

798
00:48:36,684 --> 00:48:38,213
I'm obviously from out of town.

799
00:48:38,317 --> 00:48:42,941
I, um, where would a guy go if he wanted a drink around here?

800
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,233
Well, my favorite spot is Tom Dooley's just

801
00:48:45,337 --> 00:48:47,250
a few blocks down the street.

802
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:49,997
We usually go there after every shift.

803
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,385
It's a nice place.

804
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:53,958
I'll have to check it out.

805
00:48:54,062 --> 00:48:55,070
Maybe I'll see you there.

806
00:48:55,174 --> 00:48:56,009
Maybe.

807
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,701
[music playing]

808
00:49:20,652 --> 00:49:23,085
One more.

809
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:25,622
You got stood up, huh?

810
00:49:25,726 --> 00:49:27,811
Looks that way.

811
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:31,948
Women, can't live with them, and you

812
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:35,666
can't live without them.

813
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:36,675
How true.

814
00:49:48,144 --> 00:49:50,195
That's for you.

815
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:51,132
Thanks.

816
00:49:58,884 --> 00:49:59,823
Hi.

817
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:02,325
Well, hello.

818
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,001
Would you like something to drink?

819
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:07,087
I'll have a Perrier.

820
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:08,234
Coming right up.

821
00:50:12,717 --> 00:50:15,462
You a heavy drinker?

822
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:19,843
Well, Mr. Farrow, what brings you to town?

823
00:50:19,947 --> 00:50:22,414
NEIL: I work for the Dallas Police Department.

824
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,222
And we're on a case.

825
00:50:24,326 --> 00:50:25,786
Oh, really?

826
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:29,470
Some kind of drug deal or something?

827
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:31,556
Or something.

828
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,015
[music playing]

829
00:50:34,788 --> 00:50:37,012
What the hell?

830
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,314
TERRORIST: Good morning, Congressman and Mrs. Seagram.

831
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:41,357
What do you want?

832
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:43,268
You, Congressman, we want you.

833
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,945
For crimes against your race and nation,

834
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:48,447
we hereby sentence you to death.

835
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:49,420
You?

836
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:50,359
Yes, it's me.

837
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:52,618
You should've kept your promise.

838
00:50:52,723 --> 00:50:54,704
You must be insane.

839
00:50:54,808 --> 00:50:55,817
I don't like that word.

840
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:56,859
[gunshot]

841
00:50:56,963 --> 00:50:57,902
[scream]

842
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:11,977
[thunder]

843
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,379
[thunder]

844
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:34,292
Well, looks like we're going to get wet.

845
00:51:34,396 --> 00:51:37,837
I already am.

846
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:40,096
[soft, romantic music]

847
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:13,175
[thunder]

848
00:53:25,758 --> 00:53:26,697
[thunder]

849
00:53:45,534 --> 00:53:47,341
Bill?

850
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:51,164
What are you doing here?

851
00:53:51,268 --> 00:53:53,771
I'm sending you some help, tomorrow.

852
00:53:56,622 --> 00:53:59,889
I don't understand.

853
00:53:59,993 --> 00:54:01,418
Watch your back, man.

854
00:54:01,523 --> 00:54:04,617
You're in deeper than you think.

855
00:54:04,721 --> 00:54:06,250
But Bill--

856
00:54:06,354 --> 00:54:07,222
Shhh.

857
00:54:09,864 --> 00:54:10,699
Tomorrow.

858
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:29,468
So what do you got on Speer?

859
00:54:29,572 --> 00:54:31,795
Nothing yet.

860
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:33,673
How about Truscott?

861
00:54:33,776 --> 00:54:35,271
Yeah, here it is.

862
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:49,070
What is this?

863
00:54:49,175 --> 00:54:50,945
What?

864
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:53,136
New Day Survival Camp?

865
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:55,257
Truscott owns a survival camp?

866
00:54:55,361 --> 00:54:57,167
Yeah.

867
00:54:57,273 --> 00:55:00,122
You knew about this?

868
00:55:00,227 --> 00:55:02,452
Sure, it's common knowledge.

869
00:55:02,556 --> 00:55:04,953
Why didn't you tell me about this?

870
00:55:05,058 --> 00:55:05,892
I don't know.

871
00:55:05,996 --> 00:55:07,977
It never came up.

872
00:55:08,082 --> 00:55:10,272
I'm investigating a guy who may be dealing

873
00:55:10,376 --> 00:55:11,731
in stolen military weapons?

874
00:55:11,836 --> 00:55:13,087
And you don't think it's worth mentioning

875
00:55:13,191 --> 00:55:14,824
that he owns a survival camp?

876
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:17,049
I didn't say it wasn't worth mentioning.

877
00:55:17,154 --> 00:55:19,274
I said it hadn't come up yet.

878
00:55:19,378 --> 00:55:21,706
Just when the hell was it going to come up?

879
00:55:21,811 --> 00:55:23,826
The man owns a survival camp.

880
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:26,364
You obviously have a very media affected concept

881
00:55:26,469 --> 00:55:28,520
of what a survival camp is.

882
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:30,605
So Milo Truscott owns one.

883
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:34,568
That doesn't make him a kook or a terrorist.

884
00:55:34,671 --> 00:55:37,868
It's no secret he's an NRA supporter.

885
00:55:37,972 --> 00:55:39,885
At this point, I'd say it's just as

886
00:55:39,989 --> 00:55:42,596
likely he was set up as it is he had anything to do

887
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:44,611
with your terrorists in Dallas.

888
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,759
Excuse me?

889
00:55:45,863 --> 00:55:46,801
Just whose side are you on?

890
00:55:49,755 --> 00:55:51,564
The law's.

891
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:54,518
And when you can prove that Milo Truscott has broken a law,

892
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:57,018
I'll be right there to help you put the cuffs on him.

893
00:55:57,122 --> 00:56:01,156
Until then, he's innocent until proven guilty.

894
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,241
And this investigation will be conducted

895
00:56:03,346 --> 00:56:05,778
in an impartial and objective manner,

896
00:56:05,883 --> 00:56:08,072
and you will not bully me or insinuate I

897
00:56:08,177 --> 00:56:09,568
am not taking my job seriously.

898
00:56:09,671 --> 00:56:10,506
You got that?

899
00:56:14,155 --> 00:56:15,719
Was it something I said?

900
00:56:20,481 --> 00:56:21,315
Good.

901
00:56:24,374 --> 00:56:27,605
Now would you like to go visit the New Day Survival Camp?

902
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,908
Yes, I would like that very much.

903
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,992
Let's go.

904
00:56:33,096 --> 00:56:35,982
Do you ever think that maybe you're just a little

905
00:56:36,087 --> 00:56:39,597
too objective for a cop?

906
00:56:39,701 --> 00:56:44,219
Don't you think it's about time we had a few cops like me?

907
00:56:44,324 --> 00:56:46,305
[gunshots]

908
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:07,993
OK, folks, not too bad, folks.

909
00:57:08,098 --> 00:57:09,523
Not too bad at all.

910
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:11,886
I actually see some improvement.

911
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,276
But Annie, darling, you simply mustn't

912
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,709
be afraid of your weapon.

913
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:31,351
Well, I'm not exactly afraid of it.

914
00:57:31,455 --> 00:57:35,069
It's just so big.

915
00:57:35,174 --> 00:57:38,441
Would it be all right if I used a smaller bore?

916
00:57:38,544 --> 00:57:43,098
Oh, Annie, you want the largest weapon you can handle,

917
00:57:43,203 --> 00:57:45,288
the one with the most stopping power.

918
00:57:48,728 --> 00:57:51,371
In a combat situation, your adversary

919
00:57:51,475 --> 00:57:56,062
may be so pumped with adrenaline that a small-bore weapon just

920
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:59,120
won't bring him down.

921
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:03,013
You want a big bullet, because a big bullet makes

922
00:58:03,118 --> 00:58:06,941
big holes in bones and organs.

923
00:58:07,045 --> 00:58:11,216
Remember, on the day of reckoning

924
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,928
when all hell is breaking loose, your weapon

925
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,264
will become your best friend.

926
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,210
Read it as such.

927
00:58:19,315 --> 00:58:23,590
OK, now, yes, may I help you?

928
00:58:23,694 --> 00:58:25,744
Detective Farrow, Dallas Police Department.

929
00:58:25,848 --> 00:58:28,178
Jennie Webber, Morgan County.

930
00:58:28,282 --> 00:58:31,410
I understand that Milo Truscott owns this place.

931
00:58:31,514 --> 00:58:34,190
I'd like to speak to him.

932
00:58:34,296 --> 00:58:36,553
Just a moment, please.

933
00:58:36,658 --> 00:58:38,916
All right, everyone, we're all finished with target practice

934
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,274
today.

935
00:58:40,378 --> 00:58:41,489
If you'll move on down to the obstacle course,

936
00:58:41,594 --> 00:58:42,601
I'll be with you directly.

937
00:58:50,456 --> 00:58:51,603
Now, what is it you want?

938
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:53,619
We'd like to speak to Milo Truscott.

939
00:58:53,724 --> 00:58:58,138
Milo Truscott, yes, well, uh, he's not around at the moment.

940
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,015
Perhaps I can help.

941
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,344
I knew it, Milo. I knew it.

942
00:59:02,448 --> 00:59:06,514
He's tracked us down.

943
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:10,546
I told you it was a mistake to use that van.

944
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,693
He knows what I look like.

945
00:59:17,671 --> 00:59:19,375
He's got to go, Milo.

946
00:59:19,478 --> 00:59:22,086
Damn it, I told you we shouldn't use that van.

947
00:59:25,665 --> 00:59:27,786
Listen to me.

948
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,072
He's seen me.

949
00:59:29,177 --> 00:59:31,434
He knows what I look like.

950
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:32,617
He can identify me.

951
00:59:39,846 --> 00:59:42,036
Maybe I should have Clint change your looks for you.

952
00:59:44,955 --> 00:59:48,466
Even your own mother wouldn't recognize you.

953
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:50,829
Well, uh, we'd like to take a look around your operation

954
00:59:50,933 --> 00:59:53,298
if you don't mind.

955
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:55,349
Yes, well, I'm sorry, sir you'll have to give

956
00:59:55,452 --> 00:59:58,268
Mr. Truscott's OK on that.

957
00:59:58,373 --> 01:00:01,883
Well, you'll tell him we stopped by.

958
01:00:01,987 --> 01:00:02,819
Yeah.

959
01:00:08,348 --> 01:00:10,294
Oh, and by the way, that was a hell of a speech

960
01:00:10,397 --> 01:00:13,491
you gave to Annie while ago about the day of reckoning

961
01:00:13,595 --> 01:00:14,464
and all that.

962
01:00:14,568 --> 01:00:16,029
It was great.

963
01:00:16,133 --> 01:00:17,732
Just one thing, how do you keep a straight face

964
01:00:17,836 --> 01:00:20,546
when you're doing it?

965
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,570
I'm afraid I don't get your meaning.

966
01:00:23,674 --> 01:00:25,725
I mean, you know, with the wall down,

967
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,019
it must be pretty hard to keep membership up.

968
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,591
It sounds like to me doomsday is cancelled.

969
01:00:30,696 --> 01:00:32,850
Don't you what's the news, mister?

970
01:00:32,954 --> 01:00:34,972
Why, we've got Libyan terrorists killing innocent people

971
01:00:35,076 --> 01:00:36,779
right here in our own backyard.

972
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,828
And what do you think is going to happen when Gaddafi

973
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:41,505
gets his hands on the button?

974
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:42,340
He will.

975
01:00:42,443 --> 01:00:44,771
Make no mistake about that.

976
01:00:44,876 --> 01:00:47,622
The United States has no shortage of enemies.

977
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,778
I don't need to tell anybody anything.

978
01:00:49,882 --> 01:00:51,585
Why, these folks want to be ready when the time

979
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,426
comes on the day of reckoning.

980
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:56,658
They'll will be delivering a powerful blow for the Lord.

981
01:00:56,763 --> 01:00:58,362
Well, amen, brother, praise God.

982
01:00:58,466 --> 01:00:59,614
Keep up the good work.

983
01:00:59,718 --> 01:01:02,255
I bet sometimes you must feel like the hand of God.

984
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:07,086
I think you better get your liberal ass right on off

985
01:01:07,192 --> 01:01:08,025
of this property.

986
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,022
Liberal ass.

987
01:01:16,262 --> 01:01:17,548
I have a liberal ass.

988
01:01:17,653 --> 01:01:19,390
Let's go, detective.

989
01:01:19,494 --> 01:01:21,511
I get that, the ass.

990
01:01:21,615 --> 01:01:22,553
Well, that settles it.

991
01:01:22,658 --> 01:01:23,631
I'm going on a diet tomorrow.

992
01:01:23,735 --> 01:01:26,203
No more jelly donuts for me.

993
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:27,802
I'm going to start exercising, start

994
01:01:27,906 --> 01:01:29,679
doing those butt crunches.

995
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:31,660
Let's go, Detective.

996
01:01:31,764 --> 01:01:33,745
Thank you for setting me straight, sir.

997
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:34,927
It was great.

998
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:35,865
Toodaloo.

999
01:01:43,686 --> 01:01:45,632
Love you.

1000
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:49,386
God, you look cute in those GI Janes.

1001
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:50,359
Bye!

1002
01:01:54,286 --> 01:01:55,538
DETECTIVE WEBBER: I swear that man wanted

1003
01:01:55,642 --> 01:01:57,762
to shoot you on the spot.

1004
01:01:57,866 --> 01:02:00,126
You were right though, no kooks in there.

1005
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:03,810
Just some good level-headed citizens with M-16s.

1006
01:02:03,914 --> 01:02:06,138
OK, OK.

1007
01:02:06,243 --> 01:02:09,162
Now, what's next?

1008
01:02:09,266 --> 01:02:12,048
See if you can locate David Speer.

1009
01:02:12,152 --> 01:02:13,646
I've got to run back to Dallas and have

1010
01:02:13,751 --> 01:02:16,045
a meeting with the terrorists expert they're bringing in.

1011
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,234
You want me to come along?

1012
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:20,735
No, you better stick around here.

1013
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:23,170
See if you can locate David. - OK.

1014
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:24,698
And I'll talk to you when I get back.

1015
01:02:24,803 --> 01:02:25,671
All right?

1016
01:02:25,777 --> 01:02:26,924
Yeah.

1017
01:02:27,028 --> 01:02:27,862
Later.

1018
01:02:30,608 --> 01:02:35,161
You are aware of the tension this is creating in our office.

1019
01:02:35,265 --> 01:02:36,516
Uh, here he is.

1020
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:40,339
Uh, gentlemen, I'd like to introduce Detective Farrow.

1021
01:02:40,443 --> 01:02:43,433
Uh, Neil this is Fred Harkington,

1022
01:02:43,537 --> 01:02:46,944
our terrorist expert.

1023
01:02:47,048 --> 01:02:48,125
Harkonnen.

1024
01:02:48,228 --> 01:02:49,271
Fred Harkonnen.

1025
01:02:49,376 --> 01:02:50,349
- Harkonnen. - Nice to meet you.

1026
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:51,670
FRED: My pleasure.

1027
01:02:51,775 --> 01:02:54,276
BURTON: And this is Rex Martin, an assistant

1028
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,327
from the DA's office.

1029
01:02:56,432 --> 01:02:58,691
Perhaps you two have met before.

1030
01:02:58,795 --> 01:03:02,305
I don't think so, How you doing?

1031
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,912
I've been bitter, frankly.

1032
01:03:05,018 --> 01:03:07,241
It seems I have everyone from the White House

1033
01:03:07,345 --> 01:03:10,647
on down to the mayor's office breathing down my neck.

1034
01:03:10,752 --> 01:03:12,767
They want to know why it's suddenly open season

1035
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,888
on politicians here in Dallas.

1036
01:03:14,993 --> 01:03:17,251
Well, now, you know that these attacks have

1037
01:03:17,355 --> 01:03:19,545
not just taken place in Dallas.

1038
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:23,716
There have been a string of attacks all across the country.

1039
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:26,149
Senator Bagley and Congressman Seagram

1040
01:03:26,253 --> 01:03:30,529
were boldly assassinated in the space of one week.

1041
01:03:30,633 --> 01:03:33,830
Now, I want to know what you've come up with,

1042
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:37,758
and I'm sure the FBI would be interested too.

1043
01:03:37,862 --> 01:03:42,659
Gentlemen, we've got to move on this thing and fast.

1044
01:03:42,763 --> 01:03:44,743
Well, I'll be filing a report later on this afternoon

1045
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:46,273
with Captain Burton.

1046
01:03:46,377 --> 01:03:47,803
Not good enough.

1047
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,097
Until this situation is under control,

1048
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,572
you will report directly to the district attorney's office,

1049
01:03:53,677 --> 01:03:56,178
specifically, to me.

1050
01:03:56,283 --> 01:03:58,786
Like hell he will.

1051
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:02,782
Who in the hell do you think you're talking to?

1052
01:04:02,887 --> 01:04:06,153
Look, let me tell you something, Mark.

1053
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,978
I want you to go back there and tell your boss that I don't

1054
01:04:10,082 --> 01:04:13,975
like him sending his little flunkie down here to put

1055
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,060
pressure on my department.

1056
01:04:16,164 --> 01:04:19,015
I'll send my report up when I'm good and ready.

1057
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,030
And if your boss doesn't like that,

1058
01:04:21,134 --> 01:04:24,090
you tell him to come down here in person and tell me about it.

1059
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,514
You understand?

1060
01:04:25,618 --> 01:04:27,668
And until then, you get the hell out of my office,

1061
01:04:27,774 --> 01:04:30,032
and I don't want to see you back here.

1062
01:04:30,136 --> 01:04:31,248
Now, get the hell out.

1063
01:04:31,352 --> 01:04:32,221
Move!

1064
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:38,966
Who the hell do you think you are?

1065
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:41,780
Things can get a little tense these days.

1066
01:04:41,884 --> 01:04:44,213
Yeah.

1067
01:04:44,317 --> 01:04:47,932
Oh, mind if I smoke?

1068
01:04:48,036 --> 01:04:48,941
Go ahead.

1069
01:04:49,045 --> 01:04:49,913
Oh, thanks.

1070
01:04:53,841 --> 01:04:55,753
So what can you tell me about The Hand of God?

1071
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,209
Oh, my apologies, fellows.

1072
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:06,666
I'm sorry for the unprofessional outburst.

1073
01:05:06,771 --> 01:05:10,419
No apology necessary.

1074
01:05:10,524 --> 01:05:15,424
The parasite wouldn't come down here in an election year.

1075
01:05:15,529 --> 01:05:17,301
Fred, why don't you go on and explain

1076
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:21,821
to the detective what you were telling me about these attacks.

1077
01:05:21,925 --> 01:05:26,720
All right, first of all, these terrorists, at least

1078
01:05:26,826 --> 01:05:29,016
the ones in the surveillance tape of Bagley's

1079
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,420
murder, not Libyans.

1080
01:05:32,525 --> 01:05:35,967
So the Libyans are recruiting Americans

1081
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:39,164
to do their dirty work?

1082
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,388
I don't think so.

1083
01:05:41,492 --> 01:05:47,053
In fact, I think the entire Libyan aspect of this scenario

1084
01:05:47,157 --> 01:05:50,008
is wrong.

1085
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:53,310
What makes you think that?

1086
01:05:53,414 --> 01:05:55,778
All right.

1087
01:05:55,882 --> 01:05:56,891
What does this look like to you?

1088
01:06:00,365 --> 01:06:05,997
A stick figure with a hand, the hand of God.

1089
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,994
As you know, Libya's a Muslim nation.

1090
01:06:10,097 --> 01:06:12,321
And no Muslim group would ever use

1091
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:16,249
this particular icon for its trademark

1092
01:06:16,354 --> 01:06:19,099
This is much more than a crude hand.

1093
01:06:19,203 --> 01:06:20,662
This is a cross.

1094
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:23,096
The cross is a Christian symbol, and for that very reason,

1095
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,947
no Muslim group would ever touch it.

1096
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,163
Take a look.

1097
01:06:27,267 --> 01:06:28,658
This is a quarter circle right here,

1098
01:06:28,762 --> 01:06:32,968
you see, with the rays or fingers radiating from it.

1099
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:36,965
So it's actually a rising sun, the sign of the Son of God,

1100
01:06:37,069 --> 01:06:41,030
Christ, or new day.

1101
01:06:41,135 --> 01:06:43,847
I don't know, dawn of a new age.

1102
01:06:43,951 --> 01:06:45,654
New day.

1103
01:06:45,758 --> 01:06:49,304
Now, see, in my opinion, these acts of terrorism

1104
01:06:49,408 --> 01:06:52,640
are being performed by a militant Christian group.

1105
01:06:52,745 --> 01:06:55,976
And since blacks are traditionally not associated

1106
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:00,426
with these groups, I'm guessing that the black man video

1107
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:03,936
was a white man in disguise.

1108
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,091
He's no brother.

1109
01:07:06,195 --> 01:07:08,454
See, this whole operation smacks the kind

1110
01:07:08,558 --> 01:07:11,896
of white supremacist extreme Christian mentality

1111
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,320
you find in groups like the KKK.

1112
01:07:19,298 --> 01:07:27,849
As for why these men have targeted Bagley and Seagram,

1113
01:07:27,952 --> 01:07:29,517
I have no idea.

1114
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,696
This is strictly political.

1115
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:35,808
He's no brother.

1116
01:07:35,913 --> 01:07:38,137
It's strictly political.

1117
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,195
I can't believe this.

1118
01:07:41,299 --> 01:07:42,795
What? What?

1119
01:07:42,899 --> 01:07:44,219
What the hell are you talking about?

1120
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:45,158
Follow me.

1121
01:07:58,888 --> 01:08:02,049
Recognize anyone?

1122
01:08:02,153 --> 01:08:06,186
Yeah, that's, uh, Senator Bagley.

1123
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:09,974
If I'm not mistaken, that's your Congressman Seagram.

1124
01:08:10,078 --> 01:08:10,913
Anyone else?

1125
01:08:14,213 --> 01:08:15,466
Look real close.

1126
01:08:19,706 --> 01:08:23,738
My god, that's Truscott.

1127
01:08:23,843 --> 01:08:28,291
These are really terrorists.

1128
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:31,802
How can you be sure?

1129
01:08:31,905 --> 01:08:32,741
Bill told me.

1130
01:08:36,181 --> 01:08:37,606
Bill Marshall?

1131
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:38,926
Farrow, you have a call coming in.

1132
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:40,213
It sounds important.

1133
01:08:40,317 --> 01:08:41,186
This phone?

1134
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:43,620
Yes, line 2.

1135
01:08:43,724 --> 01:08:45,287
Farrow here.

1136
01:08:45,391 --> 01:08:46,886
You the one that was at the Hog

1137
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:49,598
Farm with the Sheriff's niece?

1138
01:08:49,702 --> 01:08:50,987
Yeah, that was me.

1139
01:08:51,091 --> 01:08:53,003
Well, I was out there too.

1140
01:08:53,108 --> 01:08:54,325
You remember me?

1141
01:08:54,429 --> 01:08:55,402
Randy Hamilton?

1142
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,730
Yeah, I remember you.

1143
01:08:57,835 --> 01:09:01,624
I need to talk to, just you, and forget the Sheriff's niece,

1144
01:09:01,728 --> 01:09:03,744
just you.

1145
01:09:03,847 --> 01:09:05,795
You have some information regarding the truck?

1146
01:09:05,898 --> 01:09:08,852
I know a shit load about a lot of things,

1147
01:09:08,956 --> 01:09:11,807
enough to get me killed, all right?

1148
01:09:11,911 --> 01:09:13,789
Well, can we talk?

1149
01:09:13,892 --> 01:09:17,507
I can be back there in 2 and 1/2 hours.

1150
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,001
You just tell me where.

1151
01:09:19,106 --> 01:09:20,983
Just wait for me at the motel.

1152
01:09:21,087 --> 01:09:23,937
I'll get in touch with you, and you listen up,

1153
01:09:24,041 --> 01:09:27,968
Sheriff Bigelow and Milo Truscott is real good buddies,

1154
01:09:28,073 --> 01:09:32,035
you know, if you mention this to anybody in the Morgan County

1155
01:09:32,138 --> 01:09:34,156
Sheriff's Department, all you are going to have is

1156
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,241
one dead Negro on your hands.

1157
01:09:36,345 --> 01:09:37,840
You understand me?

1158
01:09:37,944 --> 01:09:38,813
I got you.

1159
01:09:38,917 --> 01:09:40,968
I'll be there alone.

1160
01:09:41,072 --> 01:09:41,905
Good.

1161
01:09:50,943 --> 01:09:53,063
I'm sending you help tomorrow.

1162
01:09:55,913 --> 01:09:59,145
Yeah, what the hell is going on here?

1163
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:02,100
I'm beginning to worry about you a little bit.

1164
01:10:02,204 --> 01:10:04,499
This is going to sound ridiculous.

1165
01:10:04,603 --> 01:10:06,306
Do you believe in ESP?

1166
01:10:09,504 --> 01:10:11,207
No, of course not.

1167
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:12,180
How about you?

1168
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:15,794
I think it's possible.

1169
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,791
Yeah.

1170
01:10:19,895 --> 01:10:20,903
I think so too.

1171
01:10:28,237 --> 01:10:30,358
[music playing]

1172
01:10:58,129 --> 01:10:59,066
[phone ringing]

1173
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:03,237
Hello, Detective Farrow here.

1174
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:07,860
Well, hello, Detective, this is Caroline.

1175
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:09,981
NEIL (ON PHONE): Hi.

1176
01:11:10,085 --> 01:11:13,178
I have the night off.

1177
01:11:13,282 --> 01:11:16,237
I thought maybe we could get together again.

1178
01:11:16,341 --> 01:11:19,017
Yeah, I'd like that.

1179
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:19,956
I can't tonight.

1180
01:11:22,701 --> 01:11:25,099
How about tomorrow?

1181
01:11:25,204 --> 01:11:26,107
Yeah.

1182
01:11:26,211 --> 01:11:28,506
Sure.

1183
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,000
No, really, I'd like to.

1184
01:11:30,105 --> 01:11:33,303
It's just-- I've got some work I got to do tonight.

1185
01:11:33,407 --> 01:11:34,276
You understand?

1186
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,083
I understand.

1187
01:11:36,187 --> 01:11:37,647
It's just that--

1188
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:39,489
NEIL (ON PHONE): What?

1189
01:11:39,594 --> 01:11:44,495
Well, last night, last night was really special for me.

1190
01:11:44,599 --> 01:11:48,143
I just hope it was special for you too.

1191
01:11:48,248 --> 01:11:49,395
Special for me?

1192
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,176
it was real special.

1193
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,025
Well, then you'll change your mind.

1194
01:11:59,092 --> 01:12:00,274
I wish I could.

1195
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:04,653
Some other time then.

1196
01:12:07,608 --> 01:12:08,441
Great.

1197
01:12:19,806 --> 01:12:20,885
[phone ringing]

1198
01:12:22,935 --> 01:12:24,951
Hello.

1199
01:12:25,056 --> 01:12:27,280
Where have you been?

1200
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:28,601
Yeah, I'll be out there.

1201
01:12:28,704 --> 01:12:31,034
He said he was busy.

1202
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,771
He has work to do.

1203
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,376
Maybe you're losing your touch, Alexandra.

1204
01:12:43,337 --> 01:12:46,257
If I know Mr. Farrow, there's only one thing

1205
01:12:46,361 --> 01:12:48,517
that will give him more satisfaction than spending

1206
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:54,356
the night with me is finding the man who shot his partner

1207
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:57,970
and putting a bullet right between your eyes.

1208
01:12:58,075 --> 01:12:59,152
- Milo, don't. - Oh, come on.

1209
01:12:59,256 --> 01:13:00,090
Be a man.

1210
01:13:06,764 --> 01:13:07,771
Later.

1211
01:13:13,229 --> 01:13:15,210
What's wrong, big brother?

1212
01:13:15,314 --> 01:13:19,311
Little Alex let you down?

1213
01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:20,283
TRUSCOTT: You shut up.

1214
01:13:20,388 --> 01:13:22,265
Maybe she isn't his type.

1215
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:25,289
Maybe you should have sent me.

1216
01:13:25,394 --> 01:13:26,888
Whitney, fix me a drink.

1217
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:33,457
I don't know why you just didn't let

1218
01:13:33,561 --> 01:13:35,612
me kill him in the first place.

1219
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:38,253
It would have been so easy.

1220
01:13:38,358 --> 01:13:39,957
Why?

1221
01:13:40,061 --> 01:13:45,345
And miss out on all the fun of killing another cop myself?

1222
01:13:45,449 --> 01:13:49,237
I thought she said killing him was a bad idea.

1223
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:50,489
I did say that.

1224
01:13:53,686 --> 01:13:54,728
What are you going to do?

1225
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:58,239
You'll see.

1226
01:14:04,322 --> 01:14:06,685
You better not forget who you belong to, baby.

1227
01:14:36,437 --> 01:14:38,034
You Hamilton?

1228
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:39,009
Just get in.

1229
01:14:42,276 --> 01:14:46,620
Understand, Truscott owns this county.

1230
01:14:46,724 --> 01:14:48,254
He can do whatever he wants.

1231
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:53,294
And whatever he's involved in, I guarantee you Sheriff Bigelow

1232
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:57,292
is ass deep into it too.

1233
01:14:57,396 --> 01:14:58,924
What made you decide to come forward now?

1234
01:15:03,234 --> 01:15:08,725
Tuesday morning when I found these in the sausage meat.

1235
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:12,479
Now, Milo had two boys working for him,

1236
01:15:12,584 --> 01:15:15,190
Tracy Goodwin and Luke.

1237
01:15:15,296 --> 01:15:16,546
Tuesday, they was gone.

1238
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:19,779
And don't nobody seem to know where they went.

1239
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,767
And I think they went on down to Dallas and got killed.

1240
01:15:27,842 --> 01:15:30,518
I think somebody is going to be eating what's left of them

1241
01:15:30,622 --> 01:15:32,986
in the breakfast sausage.

1242
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:36,150
See, Milo is a crazy son of a bitch.

1243
01:15:36,254 --> 01:15:38,374
Now, I've done lived here all my life.

1244
01:15:38,477 --> 01:15:42,961
As long as I can remember, Truscott ran Morgan County.

1245
01:15:43,066 --> 01:15:45,811
Milo's daddy, he wasn't no saint,

1246
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,071
but he wasn't crazy neither.

1247
01:15:48,175 --> 01:15:54,709
Now, a while back, Milo's uncle turned up dead.

1248
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:56,447
And nobody really give a damn.

1249
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:57,907
They didn't even go after the killer,

1250
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:00,409
because he was an embarrassment to the family.

1251
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,946
He was a homosexual.

1252
01:16:03,051 --> 01:16:08,542
Now, rumor was that him and Milo had a thing going.

1253
01:16:08,646 --> 01:16:11,879
Milo got mad at him one night, killed him,

1254
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,409
and his dad had covered it up.

1255
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:18,171
Take a look at that picture?

1256
01:16:18,275 --> 01:16:20,011
You seen it before?

1257
01:16:20,115 --> 01:16:25,851
Yeah, Milo had one of these over the top of his fireplace.

1258
01:16:25,955 --> 01:16:28,041
You recognize any of the men?

1259
01:16:28,146 --> 01:16:31,586
That's the congressman.

1260
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:32,942
That's Mr. Bagley.

1261
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:37,078
He used to come out to the house a lot a long time ago.

1262
01:16:37,182 --> 01:16:41,562
And I seen this man before, but I

1263
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:46,844
don't recollect his name right now and Milo,

1264
01:16:46,949 --> 01:16:49,174
And that's Norman Pritchard.

1265
01:16:49,278 --> 01:16:53,414
Everybody know he run the Klan hereby.

1266
01:16:53,518 --> 01:16:54,908
KKK?

1267
01:16:55,013 --> 01:16:57,897
Whatever they call themselves these days.

1268
01:16:58,002 --> 01:17:02,554
Same old dumb shit, kill all the niggers, kill all the Jews.

1269
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:04,154
Dumb motherfucker.

1270
01:17:04,258 --> 01:17:05,092
Yeah.

1271
01:17:08,602 --> 01:17:11,557
What about David Speer?

1272
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:16,180
Everybody but you know he hang down around Norma's.

1273
01:17:16,284 --> 01:17:17,327
Norma's?

1274
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:23,826
A trucker joint outside of town, Highway 61.

1275
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:27,094
If you go down there messing with them boys, you be careful.

1276
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:31,090
They'll cut your balls off just as soon as look at you.

1277
01:17:31,195 --> 01:17:33,142
[music playing]

1278
01:17:48,156 --> 01:17:49,025
So how you guys doing?

1279
01:17:57,401 --> 01:17:58,409
I was looking for David Speer.

1280
01:17:58,513 --> 01:18:00,947
Have you seen him?

1281
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:04,422
Yeah, just going around the corner of the building there.

1282
01:18:04,526 --> 01:18:09,010
You'll find him out back on the porch sleeping it off.

1283
01:18:09,114 --> 01:18:10,193
Thanks.

1284
01:18:10,296 --> 01:18:11,166
Oh, don't mention it.

1285
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,278
No problem.

1286
01:18:52,248 --> 01:18:55,202
Mr. Speer. Mr. Speer, wake up.

1287
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:20,993
TRUSCOTT: That old boy put a nice goose egg on your noggin,

1288
01:19:21,097 --> 01:19:22,590
didn't he?

1289
01:19:22,694 --> 01:19:25,198
I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to wake up.

1290
01:19:28,048 --> 01:19:32,600
You've been out cold for almost 24 hours.

1291
01:19:32,705 --> 01:19:34,233
I thought maybe you'd gone into a coma

1292
01:19:34,338 --> 01:19:38,648
like that nigger buddy of yours, the one I

1293
01:19:38,753 --> 01:19:42,401
took down in the warehouse.

1294
01:19:42,506 --> 01:19:44,452
Son of a bitch.

1295
01:19:44,557 --> 01:19:46,504
I've been called worse.

1296
01:19:46,608 --> 01:19:49,388
Oh, I bet you have.

1297
01:19:49,492 --> 01:19:52,760
What is it with you, Truscott?

1298
01:19:52,864 --> 01:19:55,783
I've been trying to figure you out.

1299
01:19:55,887 --> 01:19:57,208
I mean, you're a powerful man.

1300
01:19:57,313 --> 01:20:01,796
What the hell have you got to gain from all this?

1301
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:05,863
If you knew me better, Detective Farrow,

1302
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:10,764
you'd know I'd never do anything without a reason.

1303
01:20:10,868 --> 01:20:13,752
What reason?

1304
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:16,498
I know you're a bigot.

1305
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:20,948
But why kill Senatory Bagley and Congressman Seagram?

1306
01:20:21,052 --> 01:20:22,929
Why are you blaming this on the Libyans?

1307
01:20:26,092 --> 01:20:29,254
Seagram's and Bagley were traitors.

1308
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:31,964
They were once members of our organization.

1309
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:34,468
I got them elected.

1310
01:20:34,572 --> 01:20:36,727
Once they were in office, they forgot

1311
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,786
the promises they'd made.

1312
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:44,617
I gave them every opportunity to make good.

1313
01:20:44,722 --> 01:20:49,864
Finally, I had to force the issue.

1314
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:53,862
Yeah, I saw your little group portrait from Bagley's office.

1315
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:56,399
Yeah, that pissed me off.

1316
01:20:56,504 --> 01:20:58,450
Here he's ignored all of his duties,

1317
01:20:58,555 --> 01:21:00,258
and still he's got the group picture

1318
01:21:00,362 --> 01:21:03,524
proudly displayed on his desk.

1319
01:21:03,629 --> 01:21:08,668
What exactly were Bagley and Seagram supposed to do for you?

1320
01:21:08,774 --> 01:21:10,545
Oh, lots of little things.

1321
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:15,585
It would have been easier with her help,

1322
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:17,914
but plan B is coming along just fine.

1323
01:21:21,424 --> 01:21:24,553
I suppose you heard about the Israeli ambassador stopping

1324
01:21:24,657 --> 01:21:26,951
over in Dallas on his way to the big conference

1325
01:21:27,055 --> 01:21:30,114
with the president.

1326
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:33,729
I imagine he's trying to gain support for his country

1327
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:38,768
since they're about that far from declaring war in Libya,

1328
01:21:38,873 --> 01:21:40,541
thanks to me and my associates.

1329
01:21:45,789 --> 01:21:46,624
Bravo.

1330
01:21:50,203 --> 01:21:52,950
Thank you.

1331
01:21:53,054 --> 01:21:59,379
Anyhow, not being one to ever leave anything to chance,

1332
01:21:59,484 --> 01:22:06,018
I've decided to squash that little Israeli cockroach.

1333
01:22:06,122 --> 01:22:10,536
Then his people have no choice but to go to war,

1334
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:15,541
and of course, the Americans will jump right in.

1335
01:22:15,645 --> 01:22:17,940
And then what?

1336
01:22:18,044 --> 01:22:19,781
Well, that completes phase 1.

1337
01:22:22,736 --> 01:22:26,106
The entire operation is kind of long and involved,

1338
01:22:26,211 --> 01:22:30,347
but basically, we'll start an all-out campaign

1339
01:22:30,452 --> 01:22:32,955
to get the white folks in this country

1340
01:22:33,058 --> 01:22:36,638
to see the so-called minorities in the proper light.

1341
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:38,341
Look at the LA riots.

1342
01:22:38,446 --> 01:22:42,373
Already people are starting to see things our way.

1343
01:22:42,478 --> 01:22:45,954
A few more properly staged events of that caliber

1344
01:22:46,057 --> 01:22:50,020
in the taxpaying, God-fearing backbone of this nation,

1345
01:22:50,124 --> 01:22:54,748
folks like you and me son, who've been paying the bills,

1346
01:22:54,852 --> 01:22:59,300
will wake up and realize it's time to ship

1347
01:22:59,405 --> 01:23:00,552
the niggers back to Africa.

1348
01:23:03,053 --> 01:23:06,043
Let them take the place of all the damn Libyans the Israelis

1349
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,364
are going to exterminate.

1350
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:18,590
Oh, by the way, my boy Clint has been using your vehicle.

1351
01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:20,328
I hope you don't mind.

1352
01:23:26,724 --> 01:23:29,643
BURTON: Don't you think I know that the Israeli ambassador

1353
01:23:29,748 --> 01:23:30,616
is going to be here?

1354
01:23:33,292 --> 01:23:37,462
Of course I stepped up security at the convention center.

1355
01:23:37,566 --> 01:23:40,104
Will you get off my case?

1356
01:23:40,209 --> 01:23:41,043
Goodbye!

1357
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:49,697
Where the hell are you, Neil?

1358
01:23:49,801 --> 01:23:51,331
Where the hell are you?

1359
01:24:05,095 --> 01:24:05,929
So?

1360
01:24:10,969 --> 01:24:11,976
So what?

1361
01:24:15,627 --> 01:24:16,495
Who's better?

1362
01:24:20,249 --> 01:24:22,404
Milo, give it a rest, please.

1363
01:24:25,671 --> 01:24:27,131
I want to hear it.

1364
01:24:27,235 --> 01:24:28,103
Who's the best?

1365
01:24:31,509 --> 01:24:32,379
You are.

1366
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:41,312
I don't think I like your tone, missy.

1367
01:24:46,804 --> 01:24:50,348
Maybe you're starting to forget who you are

1368
01:24:50,453 --> 01:24:52,643
and where you came from.

1369
01:24:55,631 --> 01:24:57,613
I remember, Milo, please.

1370
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:01,713
Who found you?

1371
01:25:05,919 --> 01:25:08,457
You did.

1372
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:09,744
Where?

1373
01:25:09,848 --> 01:25:12,558
In the gutter with all the other street trash.

1374
01:25:15,582 --> 01:25:17,111
Who brought you salvation?

1375
01:25:23,367 --> 01:25:24,237
You did.

1376
01:25:27,643 --> 01:25:30,354
And who's going to make you the queen of the South

1377
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,918
before it's all said and done?

1378
01:25:39,808 --> 01:25:40,920
I asked you a question.

1379
01:25:44,326 --> 01:25:51,938
Dammit, Alex, it's a damn cop, isn't it?

1380
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:53,606
How ridiculous.

1381
01:26:15,468 --> 01:26:16,267
Sheriff.

1382
01:26:16,373 --> 01:26:17,206
Milo, how are you?

1383
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:19,013
Good to see you again.

1384
01:26:19,118 --> 01:26:20,021
Who do you know, Clint?

1385
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:21,134
How you doing, [inaudible]?

1386
01:26:21,238 --> 01:26:22,072
Come on in here.

1387
01:26:31,179 --> 01:26:33,124
Milo, I've got to hand it to you.

1388
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:36,357
Everything has gone just like you said it would.

1389
01:26:36,461 --> 01:26:38,060
I commend you.

1390
01:26:38,164 --> 01:26:39,381
Thank you, Sheriff.

1391
01:26:39,485 --> 01:26:42,718
Clint, Whitney, I envy you two boys.

1392
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:45,707
Wish I was going with you.

1393
01:26:45,811 --> 01:26:49,564
Whitney volunteered to carry the bomb.

1394
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:51,581
I'm real proud of him.

1395
01:26:57,211 --> 01:26:59,401
Is that Dallas detective behaving himself.

1396
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:03,050
TRUSCOTT: He's been the perfect guest.

1397
01:27:03,155 --> 01:27:04,406
SHERIFF: Where's that pretty little Alex?

1398
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:08,090
She ought to be here celebrating with us.

1399
01:27:08,194 --> 01:27:11,636
Alex is a little under the weather.

1400
01:27:11,741 --> 01:27:14,659
SHERIFF: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1401
01:27:14,764 --> 01:27:17,405
You remember to give her my regards.

1402
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:19,039
[music playing]

1403
01:27:40,136 --> 01:27:41,074
[phone ring]

1404
01:27:43,194 --> 01:27:44,029
Yes?

1405
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:45,767
This is Burton.

1406
01:27:45,871 --> 01:27:48,755
Yeah, uh, this is Randy Hamilton.

1407
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,599
BURTON: Who?

1408
01:27:50,703 --> 01:27:53,205
Randy Hamilton, Morgan County.

1409
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:58,036
I'm calling about that detective that you sent down here.

1410
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,470
Neil Farrow?

1411
01:28:00,574 --> 01:28:01,754
Yeah, what about him?

1412
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:03,215
RANDY (ON PHONE): I think the boy done

1413
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:05,683
got himself into some mighty deep shit down here.

1414
01:28:11,487 --> 01:28:13,746
Good luck.

1415
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:19,030
Milo, Milo, please, don't make me do this.

1416
01:28:19,134 --> 01:28:22,018
Clint, keep an eye on Whitney so he

1417
01:28:22,122 --> 01:28:24,556
doesn't embarrass himself.

1418
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:25,806
Yes, sir.

1419
01:28:25,911 --> 01:28:29,457
And Whitney, you be real gentle with that bomb,

1420
01:28:29,561 --> 01:28:30,846
you hear?

1421
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:32,967
We wouldn't want it to go off prematurely.

1422
01:28:42,838 --> 01:28:44,784
[music playing]

1423
01:28:55,732 --> 01:28:57,227
Hang in there buddy.

1424
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:58,861
I'm watching over you.

1425
01:29:02,232 --> 01:29:05,882
How am I supposed to get out of this?

1426
01:29:05,986 --> 01:29:07,932
Keep your eyes open.

1427
01:29:08,037 --> 01:29:09,393
I'm watching your back.

1428
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,431
WHITNEY: God, this place is crawling with security.

1429
01:29:27,535 --> 01:29:28,751
We have to abort.

1430
01:29:28,856 --> 01:29:30,490
Shut up, you chicken shit.

1431
01:29:30,594 --> 01:29:32,262
You do anything to jeopardize this mission

1432
01:29:32,366 --> 01:29:33,271
I'll fucking kill you.

1433
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:36,815
Do you understand me?

1434
01:29:36,919 --> 01:29:38,276
Gentlemen, this is a restricted area.

1435
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:39,561
You need to back out.

1436
01:29:39,665 --> 01:29:41,473
Dallas PD, special passport.

1437
01:29:41,577 --> 01:29:43,524
We're going to help protect the ambassador.

1438
01:29:43,627 --> 01:29:44,532
Can I see your ID?

1439
01:29:44,636 --> 01:29:45,678
Sure thing.

1440
01:29:52,838 --> 01:29:53,706
Hi there.

1441
01:30:07,748 --> 01:30:08,896
Comfortable?

1442
01:30:09,001 --> 01:30:09,661
Great.

1443
01:30:09,765 --> 01:30:10,842
I just love being tied up.

1444
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,176
Maybe I could make you a little more comfortable.

1445
01:30:28,116 --> 01:30:33,191
I told them they should have sent me instead of Alex.

1446
01:30:33,296 --> 01:30:35,311
Alex?

1447
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:37,710
Oh, that's right.

1448
01:30:37,814 --> 01:30:41,255
You know her as Caroline.

1449
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:45,148
You didn't realize she was my mother's mistress, did you?

1450
01:30:49,248 --> 01:30:51,056
That's all right.

1451
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:56,582
You won't even remember Alex when I get through with you.

1452
01:31:07,497 --> 01:31:10,798
We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring

1453
01:31:10,903 --> 01:31:12,710
you this late news bulletin.

1454
01:31:12,814 --> 01:31:15,282
An attempt to breach the security surrounding

1455
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:18,341
the visiting Israeli ambassador, Daniel Stromberg,

1456
01:31:18,445 --> 01:31:22,685
has resulted in an exchange of gunfire less than an hour ago.

1457
01:31:22,789 --> 01:31:25,117
At least one federal officer is dead and police

1458
01:31:25,222 --> 01:31:27,968
are currently pursuing the fleeing suspects.

1459
01:31:28,073 --> 01:31:30,332
We'll keep you appraised of this story as it develops.

1460
01:31:30,436 --> 01:31:33,182
Meanwhile, back to our regularly-scheduled program.

Just pull over!

1467
01:32:06,895 --> 01:32:08,252
They know it's us.

1468
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:09,399
Just stop the car!

1469
01:32:09,502 --> 01:32:10,337
[gunshot]

1470
01:32:13,221 --> 01:32:14,056
Shit.

[gunfire]

1472
01:32:21,251 --> 01:32:23,406
Stop the truck and let me out.

1473
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,517
You want out?

1474
01:32:24,621 --> 01:32:25,734
Yes!

1475
01:32:25,838 --> 01:32:27,819
Fine with me.

1476
01:32:27,923 --> 01:32:28,862
[scream]

1477
01:32:59,552 --> 01:33:01,081
Don't shoot!

1478
01:33:01,185 --> 01:33:02,125
[gunshot]

1479
01:33:02,229 --> 01:33:04,210
I surrender!

[music playing]

1482
01:33:15,575 --> 01:33:17,695
All right, that's enough of this bullshit.

1483
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:34,761
[explosion]

1484
01:33:48,768 --> 01:33:50,159
REPORTER (ON TV): With the wind from the south

1485
01:33:50,263 --> 01:33:53,982
at 17 miles per hour, it's currently 47 degrees.

1486
01:33:54,086 --> 01:33:56,902
This is a channel 6 news flash.

1487
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:59,196
Police have apprehended the man accused

1488
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,150
of killing one federal agent and injuring others

1489
01:34:02,254 --> 01:34:04,167
in an apparent attempt to assassinate

1490
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:07,084
the Israeli ambassador, Daniel Stromberg.

1491
01:34:07,188 --> 01:34:09,692
The suspects motive for the attempted assassination

1492
01:34:09,796 --> 01:34:12,368
is still unknown, and a police spokesperson

1493
01:34:12,472 --> 01:34:15,289
declined to speculate as to whether the individual was

1494
01:34:15,392 --> 01:34:20,362
working for the Libyan terrorist group known as The Hand of God.

[breaking glass]

1498
01:34:48,966 --> 01:34:50,289
What's wrong, my love?

1499
01:34:50,392 --> 01:34:52,166
Did your little soldiers fuck up?

1500
01:34:57,205 --> 01:35:01,375
Does this mean I don't get to be queen of the South after all?

1501
01:35:01,479 --> 01:35:02,348
Shut up!

1502
01:35:05,442 --> 01:35:09,404
The king has spoken.

1503
01:35:09,509 --> 01:35:10,830
Shut up.

1504
01:35:10,934 --> 01:35:12,428
Shut up.

1505
01:35:12,533 --> 01:35:13,680
Shut up.

1506
01:35:13,784 --> 01:35:14,687
Shut up.

1507
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:15,695
Shut up!

1508
01:35:21,673 --> 01:35:28,034
Your highness, I've got to say, he was better in bed.

[scream]

1510
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:59,107
Where is he?

01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:02,269
NEIL: Truscott, where are you going?

1512
01:36:06,754 --> 01:36:09,951
Over here!

[gunshot]

1514
01:36:11,306 --> 01:36:15,060
Come on, you can do better than that.

1515
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:22,290
BILL (VOICEOVER): Hang in there, buddy, I'm watching your back.

1516
01:36:28,268 --> 01:36:30,839
I'm going to make sausage out of you.

1517
01:36:30,944 --> 01:36:31,917
You hear me, Farrow?

1518
01:36:35,741 --> 01:36:37,409
What's wrong, Truscott?

1519
01:36:37,513 --> 01:36:38,938
You having a bad day?

1520
01:36:41,788 --> 01:36:44,882
Better yet, I'm going to shoot you in the guts

1521
01:36:44,986 --> 01:36:46,169
and throw you in a pen.

1522
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:56,040
Did you know more people are eaten by pigs than by sharks?

1523
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:58,471
It's a fact.

1524
01:36:58,575 --> 01:37:01,113
Pigs will eat anything.

1525
01:37:01,217 --> 01:37:05,353
Once they smell that blood, there's no stopping them.

1526
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:12,548
[pig sounds]

1527
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,903
Ironic, don't you think?

1528
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:29,266
Pigs like you ending up as pig food.

1530
01:37:39,902 --> 01:37:41,258
NEIL: Truscott, over here!

1531
01:38:46,635 --> 01:38:47,818
Hi, can I help you?

1532
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,416
Sheriff Howard Bigelow?

1533
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,355
BIGELOW: Yes, I am.

1534
01:38:50,459 --> 01:38:51,919
Fred Stark, FBI.

1535
01:38:52,023 --> 01:38:54,386
You're under arrest.

1536
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:57,654
WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Please, Dr. Davis, telephone, please.

1537
01:39:07,211 --> 01:39:13,190
Bill, wherever you are, we got them.

1538
01:39:13,294 --> 01:39:16,701
We got them.

[music playing]

1540
01:39:47,286 --> 01:39:49,858
Bill, I just can't do it anymore.

1541
01:39:52,395 --> 01:39:53,264
It's just not worth it.

1542
01:40:01,884 --> 01:40:03,204
I used to believe in this badge.

1543
01:40:06,194 --> 01:40:07,724
Well, I still do.

1544
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:14,675
It's just that too many good men have paid the price.

1545
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:22,704
There's too much blood on it, and I

1546
01:40:22,808 --> 01:40:24,371
can't pay that price anymore.

1547
01:40:35,877 --> 01:40:36,815

What the hell?

01:40:46,095 --> 01:40:48,666
(WHISPERING) I remember.

1551
01:40:48,771 --> 01:40:49,780
You're alive, man.

1552
01:40:49,884 --> 01:40:51,413
You're talking.

1553
01:40:51,517 --> 01:40:53,950
You're alive.

1554
01:40:54,054 --> 01:40:57,217
Neil, did you get those guys?

1555
01:40:57,321 --> 01:40:59,824
We got them, buddy.

1556
01:40:59,928 --> 01:41:00,831
We got them.

1557
01:41:06,705 --> 01:41:10,911
Hey, man, is this is your badge.

1558
01:41:11,016 --> 01:41:12,787
Yeah.

1559
01:41:12,892 --> 01:41:15,882
I must have dropped it.

1560
01:41:15,986 --> 01:41:17,550

I know that times are tough.

1564
01:41:35,345 --> 01:41:46,537
But giving up isn't the answer when sometimes love is enough.

1565
01:41:46,641 --> 01:41:51,751
I know it seems no one understands.

1566
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:56,513
No one knows what you're going through,

1567
01:41:56,618 --> 01:42:02,177
but who has been sitting right by your side?

1568
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:07,983
And who has been here listening to you.

1569
01:42:08,087 --> 01:42:13,196
MAN (SINGING): So why don't you take my hand.

1570
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:18,375
We will see where this road leads.

1571
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:24,457
I want you to know this love I feel,

1572
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:30,018
because you're the only one that might heart needs.

1573
01:42:33,425 --> 01:42:38,708
WOMAN (SINGING): While the hands of time keep moving.

1574
01:42:38,813 --> 01:42:42,774
MAN (SINGING): And the pages keep on turning.

1575
01:42:42,878 --> 01:42:45,798
WOMAN (SINGING): I will still be there for you.

1576
01:42:49,552 --> 01:42:54,313
While the days are going fast now.

1577
01:42:54,417 --> 01:42:59,353
MAN (SINGING): With the hopes to get through somehow.

1578
01:42:59,458 --> 01:43:02,412
WOMAN (SINGING): And now you're not alone.

1579
01:43:05,018 --> 01:43:07,452
MAN (SINGING): Because I will still be there for you.
