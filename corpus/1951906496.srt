1
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:32,402
There are no American
combat forces in Laos.

2
00:01:55,487 --> 00:02:00,277
We are concerned by the
North Vietnamese move into Laos.

3
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:20,445
50000 North Vietnamese
are there at the present time.

4
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:30,399
American participation in Laos is at

5
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:33,435
the request
of the neutralist government

6
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:38,797
which was set up in accordance
with the 1962 accords, agreed to

7
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:41,558
by Hanoi, Peking, and the USSR.

8
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:45,563
We have been providing
logistical support

9
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:51,599
and some training
to avoid Laos falling

10
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,727
under Communist domination.

11
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:57,676
No American manpower in Laos

12
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:01,523
is there on a combat basis.

13
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:19,597
Come on!

14
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,206
Gene, no!

15
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:55,797
No chance.

16
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,846
Get back! Stay back!

17
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:02,956
Son of a bitch.

18
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:05,363
Gene...

19
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:08,646
To hell with the cargo!
Is he dead?

20
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:13,597
Well, Rob, if he's not
he's very, very calm.

21
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,199
Jesus, I'm sorry.

22
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:17,882
Hey, Gene

23
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:22,797
We're not here right now.

24
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,444
I saw Nixon on TV.

25
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:30,636
So we're not actually here

26
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,640
and this didn't happen.

27
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,404
Maybe not for you
and not for Nixon

28
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:41,722
but it happened for Doug.
We sure go through pilots.

29
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:45,040
Gene! Remember!

30
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:47,002
Shhh!

31
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:52,516
Since we're not here, I don't remember
what the fuck you didn't say.

32
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:56,523
These pilots are head cases!
Yeah.

33
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:59,999
And the worst part is
we need more of 'em.

34
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:47,639
Now to our "eye in the sky"
pilot Billy Covington.

35
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,560
How ya doing up there?

36
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:53,244
I think the music speaks for me:

37
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:55,684
"All I want is to be 'a free

38
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:59,284
live my life the way I want 'a be."

39
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:01,644
How's the traffic, Billy?

40
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:04,801
Traffic's kinda depressing. Sad.

41
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,961
Real congested.
Kinda bumsy looking

42
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:11,963
to tell you.
We've heard there's

43
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:14,119
a whale of a jam on the 103.

44
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,963
Yeah. You know why?
That's why we

45
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,360
go to you, Bill.
I'll tell you.

46
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:25,203
'Cause most drivers turn into
pagan rubbernecks, hoping

47
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:28,406
to see a fatality. Makes a
gawker's block

48
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:31,322
for a coupla miles back.

49
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:33,400
Not unlike this moron

50
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:38,119
in the brown 18 wheeler from
Rubio moving and hauling.

51
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:40,844
'Scuse me a sec, Stevie.

52
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:44,042
Move your truck!
An ambulance is coming!

53
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:46,802
Fuck you, "eye in the sky!"

54
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,039
Fuck me?
Yeah! Fuck you!

55
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:51,882
What'd you say?
I said fuck you!

56
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,438
You want a convertible?
Get down here

57
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,567
fucking punk. I'll kick your ass!

58
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,196
You airborne piece of shit!

59
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:05,558
This is Rock 1080, where else can you
get such in depth traffic reporting?

60
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:08,766
You should be arrested!
This is very dangerous!

61
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:16,203
I'll bust that whirlybird
to hell and back!

License SUSPEN DED

63
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:55,722
Hey, Billy.

64
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,085
Who are you?
Heard about your fall from grace.

65
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,480
An adventurer without an adventure.
Wrong.

66
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:05,515
Nothing lower than a grounded pilot.
Who are you?

67
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,404
I want to ask you why you flew
so low over that accident?

68
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,958
The ambulance couldn't get through.

69
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:19,036
I want to be down in the action.
Thought so.

70
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:24,317
The thing that got you fired here
can get you hired in Laos.

71
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:25,797
There's a war there!

72
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,325
In Vietnam, not Laos.
You saw the President on TV?

73
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:32,162
Heckle and Jeckle talk on TV
doesn't mean

74
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:35,525
I believe birds can really talk.
Point taken.

75
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:37,884
But there's no war in Laos.

76
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:41,564
You can take that to the bank.
Who'll be signing my checks?

77
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:45,679
Our outfit's called Air America.
Strictly civilian.

78
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:48,317
American Pilots. Men like you.

79
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:54,200
Wild men flying cargo and
refugees in the wild East.

80
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:56,726
FAA took my ticket, man.

81
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,478
Get you a new one in Taiwan.
No sweat.

82
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,406
Who are you?

83
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:05,723
Your biggest fan.

84
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:05,602
What's it supposed to be?
Sound of the torment of war.

85
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,965
When the enemy hears this
coming from your planes

86
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:12,325
they'll flip. The North Vietnamese

87
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:17,483
are pouring into Laos heading to
Saigon along the Ho Chi Minh trail

88
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:20,083
hooking up with their Commie buddies.

89
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:24,481
We blast 'em with this stuff
they panic, they scatter. I admit

90
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:28,437
it's a dangerous mission.
Worse than dangerous.

91
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:31,475
This is embarrassing, man!

92
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,958
They'll point and laugh!

93
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,119
This tape

94
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:40,123
was made by experts for maximum
psychological effect.

95
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:43,042
You've got no idea
who you're fighting here.

96
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:46,679
You know more about it
than American Intelligence.

97
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:53,083
Don't use the word "intelligence"
to describe your job.

98
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:57,799
Rob Diehl? Hi.

99
00:11:58,367 --> 00:11:59,720
I'm Billy Covington.

100
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,755
Welcome.
Thanks.

101
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:06,996
You have some paperwork?
Nice bat.

102
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,398
Billy is one of you guys.

103
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:13,164
Thanks. So talk to 'em.

104
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:17,440
Hi, guys.
What brings you here, Covington?

105
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,758
I hear there's some good flying.

106
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:22,203
Good flying?

107
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:24,123
Yeah?

108
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:26,484
Depends where you're coming from.

109
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,003
Where are you coming from?

110
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:34,083
From L.A. The west coast of the US.
Where are you coming from?

111
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:36,797
From the dark side of the moon.

112
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:40,720
And I'm going back there soon.

113
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,003
The golden BB is coming.
My bat.

114
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,285
Nomenclature: BB, gold.

115
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:49,803
Ordinance: Personnel, Neely.

116
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,485
And the four rounds you can't...

117
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:56,642
Pilot hi jinks.
It's their way of coping.

118
00:12:57,207 --> 00:13:00,199
Pilot hi jinks?
This is psychotic behavior.

119
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:05,158
Psychotic behavior is company policy
at Air America. I'm Gene Ryack.

120
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:10,518
Take Billy on his orientation flight.
OK with me. Is it OK with you?

121
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:14,278
Let's get in the wind.
Give him the bat.

122
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:18,159
This is Long Tieng, right?
Right.

123
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:22,003
There's nothing here on the map.

124
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:26,276
Well I guess it's like Rob says.
We're not here.

125
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,157
Which means you're not seeing
the second biggest city in Laos

126
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,400
built from scratch
by the U. S. Government.

127
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:37,642
And we really don't run 400 flights
or ship 100 tons of cargo

128
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:41,358
medicine, weapons
or local troops, like those.

129
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:45,806
"Anywhere, anything, any time."
That's our motto.

130
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,645
We fly C 123, Helio Couriers
fairly normal machines.

131
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:54,005
But the real fun is playing
with these freaky planes.

132
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,242
These aren't legal in the US.
This ain't the States.

133
00:13:58,807 --> 00:13:59,796
Damn right.

134
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:05,364
Watcha got today?
Peanutbutter and mayo. What you got?

135
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:07,883
Flight schedule.
About time

136
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,198
You seem to be doing OK.

137
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:36,724
I do all right in the air
I tend to fuck up on the ground.

138
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:40,404
Mind if I look in your logbook?

139
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:44,683
14 months of bush flying in Canada.

140
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,602
Bush flying?
Yeah, bush flying.

141
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,042
2 months crop dusting
outside of Fresno.

142
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,677
Fresno. Your a real fucking hero.

143
00:14:56,967 --> 00:15:01,119
You flew "eye in the sky"?
Ex cuse me, is that an Uzi?

144
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,996
That'd make a great ad:

145
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:06,763
"Ex cuse me, is that an Uzi?"
"Why yes

146
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:11,798
self defense is no joke.
That's why I pack an Uzi.

147
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,516
Accept no substitutes."

148
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,679
Show him your amulet, Gene!

149
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:18,243
What's in there?

150
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:22,641
The ashes of my big toe. Shot off
through the floor of the cockpit.

151
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:24,276
Not far from here.

152
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:27,361
You get shot here?
It was ugly.

153
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,758
He had it cremated.

154
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:32,318
Always has it with him.
Wait a sec.

155
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:36,846
No one told me about losing toes.
He never mentioned toe loss.

156
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:39,165
Who
The recruiter.

157
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,475
Why didn't you get it
sewn back on?

158
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:46,602
When a piece of me gets shot off
I don't want it back.

159
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:48,919
It's still with us in spirit.

160
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:50,602
You understand?

161
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,681
In spirit, toe ism.

162
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:12,595
Royal Asian Airlines Flight No. 744.
Arriving at gate 12.

163
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,918
Glad you could make it, sir.

164
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:24,957
A US senator? In my back yard?
On a fact finding mission?

165
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,839
He's not gonna find any facts.
I promise.

166
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:33,764
Certainly not about our little deal.
Besides, he's a dimwit.

167
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:37,440
He had a tractor dealership
before he got elected.

168
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:43,802
Harry Truman sold cheap suits
he wound up dropping an atomic bomb.

169
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,639
Welcome to Vientiane, sir.
Thank you, Ambassador Marloff.

170
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:09,961
Senator, this is major Lemond.
I'm sure you've heard of him.

171
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:14,122
Of course. Where's the uniform, Major?
Too hot for all those ribbons?

172
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:18,760
You going civvie on us?
I'm a civilian now.

173
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:21,363
With the Air Force at heart.

174
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:27,244
Thank you. Put bag in big car.
Senator...

175
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,796
I know.

176
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,835
Sorry
have no local dinero.

177
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:34,125
Give tip later OK?
Senator!

178
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,566
This is General Lu Soong
Supreme Commander of the Allies.

179
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:43,635
Hello?

180
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:45,236
Anybody home?

181
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:48,044
Get a load of Senator Tact here.

182
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:52,361
When you go to France, you have
General DeGaulle carry luggage?

183
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:54,196
Rob, the bag.

184
00:17:56,087 --> 00:18:00,000
I'll take that, sir. Your jacket?
Thank you.

185
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,320
Lighten up on the stick.
We're gonna land.

186
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:12,361
Land? Where?

187
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:15,805
I'll show you.
Oh, come on.

188
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:21,078
That's not a strip, it's a mountain.
Full flap, 3 cranks.

189
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:30,676
Please don't do this.

190
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:43,797
That was great. How was it for you?

191
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:09,403
There're people in the jungle!

192
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:11,960
Don't, I know them.

193
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,516
Who are they?

194
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:17,397
Friends of my wife.
Little one's my brother in law

195
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,435
with a business proposition.
Don't do that.

196
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:45,161
Six crates of weapons.
I'll make you a good offer.

197
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,600
The Russians air dropped them
for the Pathet Lao.

198
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,164
We stole 'em. Brand new.

199
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,564
I'll give you 400 kips.

200
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:06,720
400? You want a slingshot?
800 kips!

201
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:12,998
600, and it's a deal.

202
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,237
Brother in laws are the same all over.

203
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:22,206
He's ripping me off...

204
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:23,722
Deal!

205
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:43,600
You use my orientation flight
for some private scam?

206
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,806
Welcome to the orient.

207
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,044
This is my retirement plan!

208
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:54,795
I've been flying fifteen years and
want my chunk of the American dream.

209
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:57,801
Running guns?

210
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,724
OK, this is the hard part.

211
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,483
I noticed, no radar.

212
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,800
Right, just dead reckoning.

213
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:16,405
I can handle it.

214
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,197
Good.

215
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:32,955
Gene, sit down. Check this out!

216
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:36,996
Pretty good, huh?

217
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:04,043
OK, we almost hit that at 3700
feet. Any higher peaks than that?

218
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:09,165
At 3700 feet! Any higher
peaks around here?

219
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:10,637
Yeah.

220
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,243
I need green.
Don't use mine.

221
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:16,526
We gotta get on a new
safety height, OK?

222
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:20,045
Hey, I was going for that one!
You did that on purpose.

223
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:24,486
Last time you colored the sky pink.
Are we south or east of

224
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:26,162
the Atlantic here?

225
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,160
South or east?

226
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:33,716
South or east?
East! Don't bother me!

227
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,198
Stay on your side!
It's my coloring book.

228
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:39,998
If you want to color
you have to be nice to me.

229
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:59,404
Hey, Senator
let us show you the real Laos!

230
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:03,719
Sir, he's getting out.

231
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:05,800
Senator, wait!

232
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:10,126
Those pilots are drunk.
Not just drunk

233
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:13,201
they're drunk Americans.
Hey, fellas!

234
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:16,797
Pitchin' a little woo, are ya?

235
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:22,482
Don't be embarrassed.
I may look like an old fart

236
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:26,801
but before I found the lord, I partook
of wine, women, and song, too.

237
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:34,796
But seriously, even though you won't
get any medals, or be in history books

238
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:37,638
some of us in Washington know exactly

239
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:40,004
what you're doing for the war effort.

240
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,162
Could you explain it to us?

241
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:05,362
It's just as heavy as Vietnam.
No!

242
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:08,282
Never compare the two.

243
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,556
Vietnam is for niggers and no necks.

244
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:15,243
Sorry
it's the Mai Tai talking.

245
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:20,961
This is a gentleman's war
a thinking man's war.

246
00:24:21,647 --> 00:24:22,602
Hello.

247
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:26,921
Corinne Landreaux
this is Billy Covington.

248
00:24:27,487 --> 00:24:30,877
She helps our Asian brothers
in the hills. Thanks.

249
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:33,278
Hey, I kid, because I care.

250
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,765
You know what the whole problem
with the Vietnam war is?

251
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:44,121
It's too public.
A secret war is the way to go.

252
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:47,997
No reporters, no TV
You blackout the war

253
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:52,196
like a football game.
And y'know what?

254
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:56,046
We can't lose.

255
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,199
Can I ask you one thing?

256
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:04,081
Is it a kinky turn on for you
to bring her to a whorehouse with you?

257
00:25:05,527 --> 00:25:10,601
This is not just a whorehouse.
Men talk business here.

258
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:13,362
I was just getting used to
this being a war.

259
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,516
Who told you
they were two different things?

260
00:25:18,087 --> 00:25:19,725
Rob, I need you outside.

261
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,278
And clear headed!

262
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:36,242
Worried, Rob?

263
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:41,119
I wonder what the Pepsi people
would think if they knew.

264
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,881
Don't you ever wonder?
No.

265
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:48,598
I wonder how many pilots
already know about his place.

266
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:57,481
Heroin good, very good.
You want to try?

267
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:01,763
With all due respect
I'm not here for a taste test.

268
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,763
I'm here to ask you again

269
00:26:06,327 --> 00:26:09,478
to shut this lab down
just while the Senator is here.

270
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:15,075
Why you not tell baggage man
Senator to go home? Kick out!

271
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:18,315
I wish it were that simple.

272
00:26:18,847 --> 00:26:22,556
In a civlized country like yours
it would be.

273
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:28,247
But in this case, it's easier
to shut down this lab.

274
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:31,082
Then you and me be poor
and cannot pay for war.

275
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:35,117
If we don't sell heroin
no money to feed my soldiers.

276
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:38,804
No, Major.
Better we stay good friends.

277
00:26:40,127 --> 00:26:43,358
You take care of silly
suitcase man OK?

278
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,125
Of course, General.

279
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:51,726
As always, you are right.

280
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:12,124
Something wrong?

281
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:17,444
I was always the weirdest guy in the
room. Here I'm not in the running.

282
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:20,521
You can be as weird as anyone here.

283
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:23,396
It just takes a little time.

284
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:26,956
I feel like I'm on
a roller coaster of bar girls

285
00:27:27,527 --> 00:27:30,121
strange squiggly signs
weird vehicles and

286
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:32,120
more bar girls, and Mai Tais and

287
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:36,999
what am I doing here?
I ask myself that all the time.

288
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:41,281
Why am I here?
Why am I here?

289
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:45,604
A taste of the States, feel better?

290
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:49,160
Yeah, everything's back to normal now.
Good.

291
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:05,401
Nice silencer.

292
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,481
I am a very considerate person.

293
00:28:09,207 --> 00:28:13,405
If I want to shoot lizards at night
on my miniature golf course

294
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:16,880
no reason to keep the neighbors awake.

295
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:20,803
You follow me?
Yeah, at a distance.

296
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:28,086
You're all right... fuckin' punk.

297
00:28:28,647 --> 00:28:33,437
Jack's the only man you ever met
with his own miniature golf course.

298
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:38,285
Why don't you open this place up
and charge admission?

299
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,644
You guys can do that when I'm gone.

300
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:43,715
You guys get it in my will.
Oh, shit. Please!

301
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:46,643
Jack's got a point:

302
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:49,084
The old timers don't get a pension.

303
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:52,798
Each pilot has to work out
his own retirement scam.

304
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:57,876
Gino, how's your guns and ammo shop?
Building up invertory?

305
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:02,679
You ever gonna sell?
Never make a move too soon.

306
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:06,557
I got a foolproof plan.
I'll take my money...

307
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:09,846
...and fly a Coppertone banner
over Coney Island

308
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:14,286
and tell war stories in bars.

309
00:29:19,247 --> 00:29:24,002
"The golden BB's coming up
to Neely now..."

310
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,046
Why you do that?

311
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:35,361
Why the fuck?

312
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:46,317
Hey, professionalism.

313
00:29:47,847 --> 00:29:49,963
How often do you guys
go on a bender like this?

314
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,677
Bender?
This is just nighttime.

315
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:21,922
O.V.!

316
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,445
Wake Billy!
I gotta bring him to work.

317
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:33,247
Wake up, junior! Wake up!

318
00:30:46,127 --> 00:30:49,324
It's OK. He likes to fly.

319
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:40,802
Good morning!

320
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,203
Crazy Americans!

321
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:02,799
Gene.
Morning, Rob. Morning.

322
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:07,246
Pick up Senator Davenport
at the Vientiane airport

323
00:33:07,807 --> 00:33:09,798
and take him up to the
refugee camp at Bien Luc.

324
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,165
Lips zipped about this airbase.

325
00:33:13,727 --> 00:33:17,561
If he's dying for local action
just dazzle him with bullshit.

326
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:21,403
We got nothing else
to dazzle him with.

327
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,286
See ya!

328
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:28,721
Gene!
Don't fuck around with the Senator.

329
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:32,359
What do you mean?
He's on a need to know basis.

330
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,806
The mushroom treatment: Keep him
in the dark and feed him on shit.

331
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:46,243
What's he doing to your plane?

332
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:49,116
He's purifying it.
It's a Buddhist ritual.

333
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:12,085
Gene, is there
a secret air base around here?

334
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:14,524
Which air base, sir?

335
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,637
I feel I'm being
kept out of the loop.

336
00:34:20,207 --> 00:34:23,517
What do I know.
I'm just a luggage boy.

337
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:27,159
General, stop pouting.
I apologized.

338
00:34:27,727 --> 00:34:29,797
I should be carrying your luggage.

339
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:33,404
That's how much the US government
values your support.

340
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:39,596
I hear that the USA finish war
and leave Southeast Asia.

341
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:43,125
Without suitcase.
General

342
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:47,797
if things get too hairy for us
politically, we have to bug out

343
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:49,561
and bring you with us.

344
00:34:50,127 --> 00:34:52,925
We take care of our buddies.
You take care of shit!

345
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:57,605
We've made general Ky in Vietnam
a very generous offer.

346
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:01,477
I know Marshal Ky.
He's small time.

347
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:04,766
After war he want to be in America
liquor store owner.

348
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:09,002
I not going from being warlord
to liquor store owner!

349
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:15,840
Tell the Senator
what you really want, General.

350
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,398
Come on, don't be shy.

351
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:22,321
Holiday Inn. Southern California.

352
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,559
Owner and operator.

353
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:29,082
That could be difficult.

354
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:31,800
You find all this funny?

355
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:35,006
Very. But, hell, Senator

356
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:38,559
If you can't laugh at war
what's the use of fighting?

357
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:44,036
You've got a good point!

358
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:14,366
What's that tin horn general
doing in my camp?

359
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:18,636
Corinne, this is Senator Davenport.
Welcome, Senator.

360
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:24,080
Corinne Landreaux from US Aid.
May I show you around?

361
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:29,157
Your boss picked a hell of a place
in the heart of opium country.

362
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:32,639
My first choice was Kansas
but nothing was free.

363
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:35,675
There's only
mountains and poppies here.

364
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:40,803
You stay two, three weeks here?
At best, then we leave.

365
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:43,996
This is noble work you do.

366
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:48,879
Thank you, Senator.
I'll see you at the plane. Bye.

367
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,725
Look at him operate!

368
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,639
He's shanghaiing men and boys
for his private army.

369
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:02,324
That's an ugly word.
What would you call it?

370
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,606
I'd say he's showing charisma.
Charisma?

371
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:09,921
These people have
different values than we do.

372
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:14,116
But the nice part is we're all
pulling together for the same cause.

373
00:37:14,687 --> 00:37:16,200
The same cause?

374
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,327
Soong's only cause is General Soong.
Don't you get it?

375
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:24,438
The CIA flies drugs for him
so he loans us his troops.

376
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:27,805
You know what?
You've been working your butt off

377
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:32,406
under the hot sun
and God bless you for it.

378
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,283
But you're starting to rave.

379
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:37,958
I think you need a vacation.

380
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:43,002
Have a nice day.

381
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,319
Thanks for coming.

382
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:49,846
You do me great honor
for come to Nino's, Ex cellency.

383
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:52,238
Thank you, Nino.

384
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,683
I'm concerned, gentlemen.

385
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:01,477
We're not children in Congress.
General Song...

386
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:06,484
Soong.
Is up to something with opium.

387
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:09,880
Now, nobody's perfect
not even our allies.

388
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:16,995
But seriously, when we hear rumors
of Americans taking drug money

389
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:21,845
it endangers the entire war.
Now I want to know the truth.

390
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:26,121
I'm afraid
we've been keeping the truth from you.

391
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:31,158
We suspect that our planes
are being used to fly Opium

392
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,365
from the highlands
to Vientiane

393
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:35,997
where it is processed into heroin.
Dear God.

394
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,642
Why wasn't I told before?

395
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:43,596
We've made a grave mistake.

396
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,801
We were trying to protect
the good name of our pilots, sir.

397
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:50,319
You mean our pilots...

398
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:54,044
...are smuggling narcotics?

399
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:58,725
Not all of 'em, sir.
Just a few bad apples.

400
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,642
They know we can't
inspect every piece of cargo.

401
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,118
So they take advantage of our trust.

402
00:39:05,247 --> 00:39:07,715
Do you know who they are?
We'll find out.

403
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:12,758
I pledge to you
we'll find those rotten apples.

404
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:03,802
Hey, General.
What's the cargo?

405
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:06,198
None of your business.

406
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:09,806
Your cargo's loaded.

407
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:13,797
Here's your co pilot.

408
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:17,198
Enjoy the animals, fellas.

409
00:40:20,447 --> 00:40:21,277
What?

410
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:24,243
I got a bad feeling this morning.

411
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:27,919
Don't worry, we won't run into
any golden BB'S, OK?

412
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:31,479
I'll be your good luck charm.
No bullets.

413
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:51,040
Rice drop's first
then the 3 little pigs.

414
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:53,757
There's no sign on the last one.

415
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,795
General Soong
supervised the loading.

416
00:40:58,047 --> 00:40:59,275
So, what would that be?

417
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,006
Come up to a 12 o'clock.

418
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:10,158
First drop zone coming up!

419
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:13,842
Stand by!

420
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:17,082
Coming up on it.

421
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:20,962
Looking good.

422
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,642
Air speed's good.

423
00:41:24,727 --> 00:41:26,001
Altitude's good.

424
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:33,238
Three.

425
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:35,037
Two.

426
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:36,796
One.

427
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:38,318
Now!

428
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:48,479
Kwan went out the back!
What?

429
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:51,003
Has she got a chute?

430
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:53,762
No.
What? We gotta go back!

431
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:57,160
No. You never go back.
What do you mean?

432
00:41:57,727 --> 00:42:02,278
You just lost your kicker!
You never go back.

433
00:42:07,407 --> 00:42:09,204
Jesus Christ
you meet someone and they die.

434
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:14,762
They should always wear chutes.

435
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:22,716
Hey, come on!

436
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:26,526
That's not funny! OK?

437
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:28,919
That's not funny!

438
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:38,444
Billy, how's it going?

439
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,239
Great.

440
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:47,083
Listen.
Nino's got lobster tonight

441
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:50,878
but you gotta order in advance.
You up for some of that?

442
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:54,439
Lobster again?
If I'm still alive I'd like some.

443
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,043
Good, I'll radio in

444
00:42:57,607 --> 00:43:02,123
a reservation.
9 o'clock OK for you guys?

445
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:05,247
Great
Rodger that.

446
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:08,400
Hell of a war, man.

447
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:12,961
340. 12 o'clock coming up.

448
00:43:13,527 --> 00:43:14,801
Stand by.

449
00:43:22,607 --> 00:43:23,642
Comin' up on it.

450
00:43:24,207 --> 00:43:25,196
Three. Two.

451
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:27,357
One.

452
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:28,797
Now!

453
00:43:50,247 --> 00:43:51,646
Shit!

454
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:54,038
Quit it!

455
00:43:58,247 --> 00:43:59,202
Oh man.

456
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:02,676
Who's shooting at us?
Here? Everybody.

457
00:44:07,087 --> 00:44:10,557
I'm not gonna die
dropping pigs from the sky.

458
00:44:11,687 --> 00:44:15,566
The golden BB.
I knew it.

459
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:19,204
Just a question of when.
I knew you were coming.

460
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:21,803
I saw it in the mirror this morning

461
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:25,962
when I cut myself shaving.
I saw it, bright as the sun.

462
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:34,476
Jack, we're hit in number 2!
Extinguisher!

463
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,163
There goes an engine. Of course.

464
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:43,606
Hey! Wake up, man!

465
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:46,158
Check the oil pressure.

466
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:50,197
Check the oil pressure!
Dropping.

467
00:44:50,767 --> 00:44:52,439
Check number 1!

468
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:53,723
Number 1 OK.

469
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:57,526
Is 9:30 okay? Nino says
he can't get us a table earlier.

470
00:44:58,087 --> 00:45:00,681
Gene, we're hit, throwing fuel!
We're going down!

471
00:45:01,247 --> 00:45:03,715
You still in gun range?
Yes.

472
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:08,156
Change altitude and heading
every few seconds. Gimme a location.

473
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:13,406
Jack! Got a minute? Location!
Stop snoozing!

474
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:17,879
2 miles south of Tango 7.

475
00:45:19,127 --> 00:45:23,245
There's a strip just the other
side of Tango 7. Can you make it?

476
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:24,876
Doubt it!

477
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:27,085
Come on, man. You can make it.

478
00:45:27,807 --> 00:45:31,243
Jeez, I'll make it.
10 degrees right.

479
00:45:31,807 --> 00:45:33,399
Welcome back!

480
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:35,757
Did I leave?

481
00:45:40,847 --> 00:45:44,362
Wild Dog to base.
Pilots in jeopardy near Tango 7.

482
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:46,838
Am heading over there.

483
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:50,126
Maintain course, Wild Dog.
We'll send a recon plane.

484
00:45:50,687 --> 00:45:52,962
Wild Dog, you copy?

485
00:45:53,527 --> 00:45:55,085
Wild Dog to base. Fuck off.

486
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,520
Where we at?

487
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:03,640
You see it?
No.

488
00:46:04,207 --> 00:46:05,435
1 o'clock.

489
00:46:06,727 --> 00:46:08,638
I got it.
Landing gear down!

490
00:46:09,207 --> 00:46:10,037
Coming down.

491
00:46:15,847 --> 00:46:19,078
It's not going down!
Don't worry. Go to manual.

492
00:46:24,807 --> 00:46:27,605
What have we got?
Nothing so far.

493
00:46:28,447 --> 00:46:31,325
We're gonna jump. Kwanh!
Put your 'chute on!

494
00:46:36,647 --> 00:46:39,241
You too, Neely.
Put your 'chute on, man!

495
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:43,800
I'm riding it in with you.
No! I want you off!

496
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:50,922
When I level out, jump! OK?
I'm taking it in with you! No!

497
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:54,363
The only thing God
drops from the sky is bird shit!

498
00:46:54,927 --> 00:46:56,326
Bird shit and you!

499
00:46:56,887 --> 00:47:00,197
That's new.
Birdshit and catatonic pilots.

500
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:01,882
Jump!

501
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:11,606
OK, you're next!

502
00:47:12,807 --> 00:47:15,685
You're most vulnerable
floating down in a 'chute.

503
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:17,999
I'll get a golden BB up my ass!

504
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:22,196
If it doesn't open
I can use my reserve...

505
00:47:22,767 --> 00:47:24,200
Get up, man! Please!

506
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,804
See you down there. Good luck!

507
00:47:32,287 --> 00:47:36,599
I have never had to
jump out of an airplane before!

508
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:40,835
I'm a fucking den mother!

509
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:51,083
OK, can you run, man? Let's go!

510
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:04,363
What are you doing back here?

511
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:07,236
I forgot my Nikon!
Here it is.

512
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:10,446
You want it? Then jump!
Yes!

513
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:13,039
You put on your parachute!

514
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:15,006
I'm afraid of heights.

515
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:29,677
Jump!

516
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:32,716
Jump!

517
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:34,243
Bye, now!

518
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:12,396
Billy, come in.

519
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:28,646
You satisfied or disappointed
that we're alive?

520
00:51:29,207 --> 00:51:33,325
The jungle is full of Commies
bandits, and headhunters.

521
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:35,798
We're not alive yet.

522
00:51:37,487 --> 00:51:40,559
Want a piece of Juicy Fruit?
No, I do not.

523
00:51:41,127 --> 00:51:42,719
We going home!

524
00:51:43,287 --> 00:51:46,120
Soon, Kwanh.
No. We go now. Look!

525
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,524
Look, we going home.

526
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:34,195
Good afternoon!

527
00:52:38,407 --> 00:52:39,635
Hiya, General.

528
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:44,440
Guess you missed us back there.

529
00:52:45,007 --> 00:52:48,602
Sure is nice
to see some "friendlies" down here.

530
00:52:49,807 --> 00:52:51,798
It's got a couple dings on it.

531
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:55,764
Sure hope they don't
take it out of my paycheck.

532
00:52:57,447 --> 00:53:00,245
Nothin' a coupla days in the
shop won't fix...

533
00:53:02,487 --> 00:53:03,806
Lemme give you a hand.

534
00:53:10,407 --> 00:53:12,796
Guess you're in a hurry, huh?

535
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:15,362
God, these are heavy!

536
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:18,566
Gonna be a tight squeeze, huh?

537
00:53:19,127 --> 00:53:19,798
Hey, man!

538
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:23,326
What about us?

539
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:29,720
You're leaving us here?

540
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:32,806
Goddammit! Fuck!

541
00:53:48,807 --> 00:53:50,798
We not go home now.

542
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:53,517
Opium go home now.

543
00:53:54,247 --> 00:53:58,206
There was opium on that?
Opium, you got it.

544
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:01,285
And he took it instead of us?

545
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:04,202
You helped him load it, pal.

546
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:19,166
You go north of the strip, I'll look
here. We'll find 'em.

547
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:22,719
If we hurry we can still make
that 9:30 table at Nino's.

548
00:54:23,287 --> 00:54:25,517
Sounds good, Gene. See ya!

549
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:32,562
Where is everybody?

550
00:54:37,127 --> 00:54:38,799
Quit it, OK?

551
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:02,646
Trouble for our boys
off your right wing, jungle's

552
00:55:03,207 --> 00:55:05,084
crawlin' with black pyjamas.

553
00:55:32,687 --> 00:55:33,642
Billy, move!

554
00:55:57,847 --> 00:55:59,041
I quit!

555
00:56:14,527 --> 00:56:15,323
Any extra holes?

556
00:56:15,887 --> 00:56:19,436
No.
Wild Dog to base enemy at Tango 7.

557
00:56:20,007 --> 00:56:23,636
Everyone's unfriendly here.
Even the "friendlies!"

558
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:27,686
Why are they so unfriendly?
They haven't gotten to know us yet.

559
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:31,843
Why are they shooting?

560
00:56:32,407 --> 00:56:34,967
'Cause they're unfriendly.

561
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:46,319
You're losing oil pressure...
I already lost tail rotor response.

562
00:56:48,487 --> 00:56:50,717
Put on your belt!

563
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:58,275
I don't want to crash twice today!
But my crashes are the best!

564
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:00,924
You're at 40!

565
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:05,280
You're redlining!

566
00:57:06,207 --> 00:57:08,357
You're redlining!

567
00:57:11,367 --> 00:57:13,927
Autorotate!
Wild Dog to base.

568
00:57:14,487 --> 00:57:17,559
We're going in 3/4 of a mile
southwest of Tango 7.

569
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:44,040
Great rescue, huh?
I thought you had this blessed.

570
00:57:44,607 --> 00:57:47,121
I thought the monk wasn't
really concentrating.

571
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:49,279
We gotta drop, you know.

572
00:57:49,847 --> 00:57:52,566
No, man.
We gotta, we're sniper bait.

573
00:57:53,127 --> 00:57:55,721
Who goes first?
There's no fast rule

574
00:57:56,287 --> 00:57:59,723
about crashing through the cockpit.
You go first.

575
00:58:00,287 --> 00:58:02,357
I don't want to go first!
I'll go. I don't want to go 2nd!

576
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:05,077
We'll toss a coin.

577
00:58:05,647 --> 00:58:06,557
Call!

578
00:58:07,127 --> 00:58:07,764
Tails.

579
00:58:09,407 --> 00:58:11,875
Is that heads? Is that tails?
Tails.

580
00:58:12,527 --> 00:58:13,960
Heads.
That's tails. I'll check.

581
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:31,397
Come on!

582
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:33,395
It's pretty soft.

583
00:58:34,647 --> 00:58:36,046
I hate going second.

584
00:58:53,527 --> 00:58:56,599
Well that fall
seemed to go pretty well.

585
00:59:07,887 --> 00:59:10,606
We should get moving.

586
00:59:11,207 --> 00:59:13,402
Can you walk?
Walk?

587
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,197
We're in the goddamned jungle!

588
00:59:41,207 --> 00:59:44,483
Give me voice. Gene. Billy.

589
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:49,482
Come in, Gene, Billy.

590
00:59:50,247 --> 00:59:51,680
Do you read me?

591
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:11,086
Gene and Billy, where are you?

592
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:19,281
Billy and Gene, do you read me?

593
01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:42,277
I stole some stuff as a kid.

594
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:46,320
Whiffle balls, model airplanes.

595
01:00:46,847 --> 01:00:49,645
I used a fake I D to drink
smoked some reefers.

596
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,919
I performed oral sex
where it's against the law.

597
01:00:52,447 --> 01:00:56,235
But until I worked for my own
government, I never smuggled drugs.

598
01:00:56,767 --> 01:00:59,804
We're not smugglers
just pack mules.

599
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:03,956
No one wins war here without
control of the opium trade.

600
01:01:04,487 --> 01:01:08,400
We help Soong get his crop to market.
He helps us fight the war.

601
01:01:08,927 --> 01:01:11,043
Don't give me
that cooled out Buddhist shit!

602
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,798
Our government is running a war
with drug money

603
01:01:15,327 --> 01:01:17,602
and our GI's are getting
strung out in Vietnam!

604
01:01:18,127 --> 01:01:20,960
You might as well throw rattlesnakes
in the schoolyard!

605
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:25,681
This doesn't bother your soul?
Leave my soul out of this.

606
01:01:26,207 --> 01:01:29,643
We don't work officially for the
US government.

607
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:35,605
Everybody knows.
What happens if you say CIA?

608
01:01:40,887 --> 01:01:44,118
Let's change course. Maybe
we'll be outta here by morning.

609
01:01:44,647 --> 01:01:46,524
How many more miles?

610
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:04,722
When the sales rep from
Bell Helicopters gets here

611
01:02:05,247 --> 01:02:09,923
go easy on him, not like that
asshole from Dow Chemicals.

612
01:02:10,447 --> 01:02:12,881
Nice and easy. Bring him here

613
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:16,524
vintage wine
blah blah blah, elegant dining

614
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:19,845
get him blown at the White Rose

615
01:02:20,367 --> 01:02:25,122
brandy, espresso. Then just
hit him up for the two free choppers.

616
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:28,525
I'm a little nervous about it.
Buona sera, signore.

617
01:02:29,447 --> 01:02:31,438
I have heard about
the pilots shooted down.

618
01:02:31,967 --> 01:02:34,720
I hope they safe. I pray for them.

619
01:02:35,247 --> 01:02:37,636
Thank you. Every prayer helps.

620
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:47,396
I have to have coffee with Davenport.
What should I do?

621
01:02:47,927 --> 01:02:50,646
I'll take him to the White Rose.
I'll get him blown.

622
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:52,361
No.
No. What?

623
01:02:52,887 --> 01:02:56,118
Davenport runs
the Senate prayer group.

624
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:59,684
With him, you don't
bring up the subject of blow jobs.

625
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,086
You let him bring it up.

626
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:13,323
Jesus!

627
01:03:13,847 --> 01:03:14,757
Again?

628
01:03:15,287 --> 01:03:18,006
Restaurant closed!
Health violation.

629
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,926
All go home now!

630
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:22,085
Everybody go now!!

631
01:03:27,047 --> 01:03:30,835
I do business with round eyes
all my life!

632
01:03:31,367 --> 01:03:33,835
But I don't let a
Corsican fuck me!

633
01:03:34,367 --> 01:03:35,083
You crazy?

634
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:38,280
I pick up opium myself!
In bad danger!

635
01:03:38,807 --> 01:03:41,321
Your men
don't want to pay same same last time!

636
01:03:41,847 --> 01:03:44,884
No more break this china!
Understand?

637
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:47,766
Now I tell you something.

638
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:50,642
I talk to Marseilles.
I talk to New York.

639
01:03:51,647 --> 01:03:53,558
They say Opium not so good this year.

640
01:03:54,087 --> 01:03:57,318
Been cut with baking powder.
So who fucking who?

641
01:03:57,847 --> 01:04:01,078
No, I no gonna pay you same same.
You give me shit!

642
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:05,885
Nino. You listen to me.
You pay same same

643
01:04:06,687 --> 01:04:09,121
or you never use my planes again.

644
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,598
OK, pay same same.

645
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:02,923
So this is
the face of modern Communism?

646
01:05:03,447 --> 01:05:06,678
Wrong. A devout Communist
carries an AK 47

647
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:09,801
they have the
oldest weapons known to man.

648
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:12,887
These are hillbillies.

649
01:05:13,767 --> 01:05:17,760
And they're pissed.
They don't cotton to outsiders.

650
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,884
What're they saying?

651
01:05:31,247 --> 01:05:33,442
I'm surprised
they haven't killed us yet.

652
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:36,561
Surprised?
How come you're so relaxed?

653
01:05:37,087 --> 01:05:42,036
Don't you get it? When you die
that's it! Blackness.

654
01:05:42,887 --> 01:05:45,321
They stick you in a box
in the ground.

655
01:05:45,847 --> 01:05:48,759
Don't even let you
out on weekends. Depressing.

656
01:05:49,287 --> 01:05:50,481
Right. Nothing.

657
01:05:51,207 --> 01:05:53,437
Buddha says...
Stop it!

658
01:05:53,967 --> 01:05:56,606
A real Buddhist
wouldn't be running guns.

659
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:02,877
You're a hustler. Call it
Religion, but you're a hustler.

660
01:06:03,687 --> 01:06:06,645
I never said
I was a good Buddhist.

661
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:12,285
They're gonna do it.

662
01:06:14,687 --> 01:06:16,484
You don't need to speed things up!

663
01:06:17,487 --> 01:06:20,399
Those guns are all wrong
for the rainy conditions.

664
01:06:20,927 --> 01:06:23,361
You need all weather weapons.

665
01:06:23,887 --> 01:06:29,166
Your guns were made in France
for the desert warfare.

666
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:35,599
I hope you didn't pay
more than two pigs for it.

667
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,123
A cow.

668
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:40,526
Yeah, I know.

669
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:44,483
A cow?
For a stupid musket?

670
01:06:46,687 --> 01:06:48,245
You got taken!

671
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:52,404
D'ya hear?
A cow for this gun!

672
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:54,724
Isn't that hysterical?

673
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:59,679
Ever shot it in the rain?

674
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:06,840
I reckon.

675
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:08,925
For all weather guns

676
01:07:09,447 --> 01:07:12,484
at great prices.

677
01:07:13,007 --> 01:07:14,884
We should go to my brother in law.

678
01:07:15,447 --> 01:07:16,675
He lives

679
01:07:17,207 --> 01:07:20,165
two days walk from here.
What do you think?

680
01:07:20,687 --> 01:07:24,202
Gentlemen, these guns are cherry.

681
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:32,039
Deal.

682
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,878
Hello? Mei ling?

683
01:07:49,487 --> 01:07:51,876
I missed you!
Oh, I couldn't tell.

684
01:08:11,527 --> 01:08:12,721
This is my wife.

685
01:08:13,247 --> 01:08:15,886
Come in to civilization
and get cleaned up!

686
01:08:20,807 --> 01:08:23,879
You don't look like a guy
who'd live in a place like this.

687
01:08:27,087 --> 01:08:29,476
Looks'll fool you every time.

688
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:31,800
What the fuck are you doing here?

689
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:33,885
Do you believe in this war?

690
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:37,476
I used to believe in all these wars.

691
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:42,079
I had a theory once.

692
01:08:42,607 --> 01:08:45,201
The politics of Saturday night.

693
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:50,564
I rated all countries on how good
their Saturday nights were.

694
01:08:51,087 --> 01:08:54,796
I knew that Moscow and Peking
were a stone drag on Saturday.

695
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:59,604
So I was flying for a cause.

696
01:09:00,127 --> 01:09:03,164
To defend barbecues
and weenie roasts

697
01:09:03,687 --> 01:09:07,885
and Ray Charle songs and
Southern Comfort 'till you pass out.

698
01:09:09,007 --> 01:09:11,726
The politics of Saturday night.
I can relate.

699
01:09:12,247 --> 01:09:15,603
Not bad is it?
But not particularly true.

700
01:09:16,127 --> 01:09:18,357
I hear they party hard in Moscow.

701
01:09:19,047 --> 01:09:22,881
Don't give up a good theory
just because it's not true.

702
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:39,077
So why don't you go home?

703
01:09:41,647 --> 01:09:45,606
Look at me, Neely, the rest.
We're trouble junkies.

704
01:09:46,127 --> 01:09:49,676
Nothing but adrenaline gets us off.
It's kinda sick.

705
01:09:51,207 --> 01:09:55,086
Quit before you pick up the habit.
And you will!

706
01:09:57,327 --> 01:10:01,286
Go back to LA and be
the weirdest guy in the room again.

707
01:10:01,807 --> 01:10:03,877
I gotta take care of something first.

708
01:10:05,207 --> 01:10:08,085
You wanna get even?

709
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:10,719
With who? Rob? Soong?

710
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:15,356
Forget it! This is the orient.

711
01:10:15,887 --> 01:10:18,879
What Soong did to you was nothing!

712
01:10:20,687 --> 01:10:24,646
I've seen things here
that I never could have imagined.

713
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:27,806
And I have a broad imagination.

714
01:10:28,287 --> 01:10:31,484
Why don't you just go home.

715
01:10:33,487 --> 01:10:36,718
This is one of the most famous
temples in Laos.

716
01:10:37,247 --> 01:10:38,919
I've been here four days.

717
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:42,803
I've seen 19 Buddhas
3 tailors, a silk factory

718
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:46,000
and you haven't told me
one new thing about the dope trade.

719
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:49,758
I'm leaving soon and
I'm not going back empty handed.

720
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:52,755
I need heads on a platter

721
01:10:54,247 --> 01:10:58,286
or the rumors will get you
on the hill. What rumors?

722
01:10:58,807 --> 01:11:00,877
You heard the man, Rob.

723
01:11:01,807 --> 01:11:03,684
Heads on a platter.

724
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:37,203
Is that Paul Bunyan's condom?

725
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,282
That's the point of the drop.

726
01:11:41,807 --> 01:11:44,037
Penis size is very
important to Asian people.

727
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:48,958
If we can convince them that
American men use this jumbo size

728
01:11:49,487 --> 01:11:52,843
their men will start to fear us.

729
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:57,879
Dismissed. One more thing, guys.

730
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:04,162
Jack Neely's body
was recovered last night.

731
01:12:05,527 --> 01:12:07,677
He was shot down by the Pathet Lao

732
01:12:08,207 --> 01:12:10,596
while looking for Covington and Ryack.

733
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:15,445
I understand how you must feel

734
01:12:15,967 --> 01:12:19,721
but in the interest of security
you must be quiet about it.

735
01:12:20,247 --> 01:12:23,842
Before you keep us quiet again
could we have a moment of silence?

736
01:12:52,927 --> 01:12:55,760
"Visit colorful native village"
reads my schedule, Gene.

737
01:12:56,287 --> 01:13:00,075
But we've been here 6 hours.
I think we can say I've seen it.

738
01:13:00,607 --> 01:13:03,405
They're nearly finished.

739
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:06,885
What is that, Gene? A boat?

740
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:09,076
Sort of.

741
01:13:09,607 --> 01:13:12,485
You a strange man, Gene.

742
01:13:13,687 --> 01:13:15,439
Thank you for noticing, General.

743
01:13:15,967 --> 01:13:19,277
You love old ways.
Asian ways.

744
01:13:19,807 --> 01:13:22,037
General Soong love

745
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:25,843
tomorrow ways. Modern world.

746
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:33,401
Our friend here's a little tipsy.

747
01:13:35,127 --> 01:13:37,641
He's high on America.
I've seen it before.

748
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:41,477
It's stronger than whisky.
Bigger than opium.

749
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:45,721
He's stoned on
dreams of the USA.

750
01:13:49,247 --> 01:13:50,726
Gene, you just mentioned opium.

751
01:13:52,647 --> 01:13:54,956
Now, tell me
let the chips fall where they may.

752
01:13:55,487 --> 01:13:58,559
Was Jack Neely flying dope
when he went down?

753
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:10,836
Let's take this to the plane.

754
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:12,766
You're taking that kayak with you?

755
01:14:13,287 --> 01:14:15,801
This is Jack Neely's coffin.

756
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:19,558
I promised him they wouldn't
send him home in a body bag.

757
01:14:20,087 --> 01:14:23,079
And, no, he wasn't flying dope.

758
01:14:24,207 --> 01:14:25,356
General! Wake up!

759
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:31,836
I'm here to drink to Jack Neely.
Join me?

760
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:35,963
To Jack!

761
01:14:37,007 --> 01:14:39,885
He wanted it like that. He'd have
been real angry to die in bed.

762
01:14:52,647 --> 01:14:57,721
I'm leaving. I sent Mei Ling
and the kids ahead. What the fuck?

763
01:14:58,247 --> 01:15:02,126
I've got a buyer for all my guns.
I'm gonna pick 'em all up

764
01:15:02,647 --> 01:15:07,880
and sell 'em in one hit.
You gonna be a farmer in Thailand?

765
01:15:09,887 --> 01:15:11,923
What about the rest of us?

766
01:15:12,447 --> 01:15:16,042
Should we go home and sell
aluminum siding?

767
01:15:16,567 --> 01:15:18,319
They're gonna shut this war down soon.

768
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:22,283
There'll be a new one opening
in a theatre near you.

769
01:15:22,807 --> 01:15:24,684
Promise?
I promise.

770
01:15:29,127 --> 01:15:32,244
I was with the Senator all day.

771
01:15:32,767 --> 01:15:36,282
The spooks are lookin' for fall guys.
So watch out.

772
01:15:45,967 --> 01:15:47,605
Where you been?

773
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:49,082
Just around.

774
01:15:49,847 --> 01:15:53,044
I did some shopping
on the black market. Bought grenades.

775
01:15:53,567 --> 01:15:56,240
Now I'm gonna have some fun.

776
01:15:56,767 --> 01:15:58,917
Big fun.

777
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:01,199
Noisy fun.

778
01:16:01,727 --> 01:16:03,797
Doesn't sound like well planned fun.

779
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,085
Like I said
I tend to fuck up on the ground.

780
01:16:08,727 --> 01:16:10,445
I wouldn't do this if I was you.

781
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:12,161
I know.

782
01:16:12,847 --> 01:16:15,441
But then you wouldn't do anything.

783
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:16,843
See you later.

784
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:19,684
Can I have a soda?

785
01:16:30,047 --> 01:16:31,275
Sure, here you go.

786
01:18:36,247 --> 01:18:39,000
I know who do this! That new kid!

787
01:18:39,527 --> 01:18:41,916
The guards saw him running away.
Word on the street is

788
01:18:42,447 --> 01:18:44,802
it's Communist sabotage.

789
01:18:45,327 --> 01:18:47,841
I don't give a rat's ass who did it.

790
01:18:48,607 --> 01:18:53,362
The whole operation is gonna blow up
in our faces, with the Senator here.

791
01:18:53,887 --> 01:18:57,562
We've got to do some
immediate damage control.

792
01:19:03,287 --> 01:19:07,326
With your indulgence:
Could I have two kilos?

793
01:19:15,207 --> 01:19:18,438
These two kilos are for the cause.

794
01:19:20,807 --> 01:19:21,444
Yes, sir.

795
01:19:26,487 --> 01:19:28,717
That's right, C 123, personal use.

796
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:31,283
Pretty big for personal use.

797
01:19:31,807 --> 01:19:35,322
You found a buyer for your guns?
Nail on the head.

798
01:19:35,847 --> 01:19:37,644
How you doing?
Very well.

799
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:42,638
What you taking today?
Flour sacks to Bien Thuong.

800
01:19:43,287 --> 01:19:46,802
That's near Tango 7.
Planning on crashing any planes?

801
01:19:47,327 --> 01:19:51,957
Not today. You already
cost this company enough.

802
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,876
What do you mean?

803
01:19:58,647 --> 01:20:01,081
Feel better?
Much better.

804
01:20:01,607 --> 01:20:05,441
The cloud of opium smoke
in town got everybody high.

805
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,765
You actually shut the plant down
for three whole hours.

806
01:20:09,287 --> 01:20:11,482
Didn't start it 'till this morning.

807
01:20:12,647 --> 01:20:13,875
That's the way it is.

808
01:20:32,847 --> 01:20:35,281
All set?
All set.

809
01:20:41,247 --> 01:20:42,680
Bien Thuong, huh?

810
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:21,685
You! Move truck out! Quick!

811
01:21:27,727 --> 01:21:29,718
Keep movin', Audrey!

812
01:21:30,247 --> 01:21:31,760
You get truck out!

813
01:21:32,567 --> 01:21:34,603
Hey! Calm down!

814
01:21:35,127 --> 01:21:39,643
You get your opium fields.
We need a few hours to move!

815
01:21:51,327 --> 01:21:53,363
Base to Stagger Lee. Come in!

816
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:56,003
Base to Stagger Lee. Over.

817
01:21:56,527 --> 01:22:00,281
Slight change in you flight plan.
Head to LS 18

818
01:22:00,807 --> 01:22:04,083
for a routine inspection.
Inspection?

819
01:22:04,607 --> 01:22:06,916
Affirmative.
We just read 'em.

820
01:22:07,927 --> 01:22:09,804
Check. Heading for LS 18.

821
01:22:14,727 --> 01:22:17,639
I'm going to LS 18
for a routine inspection.

822
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:20,806
Routine inspection? Never heard of it.

823
01:22:23,247 --> 01:22:25,283
Then it ain't routine.

824
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:30,079
Babo, check on the cargo.
What's up?

825
01:22:30,607 --> 01:22:32,882
I don't know. Check it, will you?

826
01:22:47,447 --> 01:22:50,598
I hope to God
our information's wrong.

827
01:22:51,127 --> 01:22:53,516
It'd break my heart
if Heroin was on that plane.

828
01:22:54,047 --> 01:22:57,926
The pilot does come from California.
I see.

829
01:22:58,447 --> 01:23:00,483
Caught up in the youth culture bit?

830
01:23:01,007 --> 01:23:03,475
Too much Rock 'n Roll.

831
01:23:05,087 --> 01:23:09,126
Still, he's only one young man.
Why do we need all these men.

832
01:23:09,647 --> 01:23:11,922
Pilots are tough men, Senator.

833
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:14,677
This one might resist
with force.

834
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:19,479
Our information say's he's
a cool and ruthless customer.

835
01:23:24,567 --> 01:23:25,477
Nothing!

836
01:23:26,007 --> 01:23:28,885
Listen, we're being set up.
Keep looking!

837
01:23:29,407 --> 01:23:31,318
Are you serious?
Yeah, cut 'em open!

838
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:41,877
What you got?
Nothing.

839
01:23:58,607 --> 01:24:00,199
Hurry up!

840
01:24:02,607 --> 01:24:03,437
Bingo!

841
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:06,964
I knew it!

842
01:24:08,967 --> 01:24:12,277
Jesus! Look at those bastards
waiting for us!

843
01:24:16,447 --> 01:24:20,042
They want us busted.
Dead and busted.

844
01:24:25,487 --> 01:24:28,320
Somebody messed with the fuel gauge!
We're running out!

845
01:24:30,207 --> 01:24:33,119
I'm heading for Tango 7.

846
01:24:33,647 --> 01:24:36,957
Wait, Billy!
They can follow us there!

847
01:24:37,487 --> 01:24:39,796
We'll figure it out.
Don't say we, man!

848
01:24:40,327 --> 01:24:43,558
I'm 42 and I never figured out
anything in my fuckin' life.

849
01:24:56,687 --> 01:24:59,918
He's not landing, Rob.
He's only got enough fuel to...

850
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:04,883
Start 'em up! Let's go after 'em!

851
01:25:20,927 --> 01:25:23,236
We're VSF, man!

852
01:25:23,767 --> 01:25:26,327
VSF?
Very severely fucked!

853
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:56,884
Good flying, Covington.
Ever do any valet parking?

854
01:25:59,847 --> 01:26:02,156
Looks like we're gonna make it.

855
01:26:02,687 --> 01:26:05,724
What are we gonna do on the ground?
I'm workin' on it!

856
01:26:17,247 --> 01:26:18,362
Come on!

857
01:26:18,967 --> 01:26:20,286
Come on!

858
01:26:40,327 --> 01:26:43,478
You're too fast!
Hold on! What?

859
01:26:44,007 --> 01:26:45,963
Pull up! Pull up!

860
01:26:46,487 --> 01:26:49,399
What are you doing?
Shut up!

861
01:26:50,087 --> 01:26:53,124
Are you fucking nuts?
Head down, now.

862
01:26:53,647 --> 01:26:54,682
Down!

863
01:27:12,127 --> 01:27:15,642
I never would have thought of it.
It just came to me.

864
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:17,964
I'm gonna buy you some beers!

865
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:26,844
Lousy week, man.

866
01:27:27,407 --> 01:27:29,716
Gene, come in, Gene!

867
01:27:34,847 --> 01:27:35,882
Bullshit.

868
01:27:36,847 --> 01:27:37,882
'Scuse me.

869
01:27:40,447 --> 01:27:42,881
It's Babo here. Gene come in!

870
01:27:43,567 --> 01:27:45,444
This is Gene. What's up?

871
01:27:46,287 --> 01:27:50,246
He did it again?
Can't he keep the thing in the air?

872
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:52,325
I'll think about it.

873
01:27:58,087 --> 01:28:00,965
Nope, no more money.
Speak English.

874
01:28:57,807 --> 01:29:00,367
Where'd he go, Rob?
I don't know!

875
01:29:00,887 --> 01:29:03,276
Well, Senator
looks like we've lost him.

876
01:29:04,767 --> 01:29:08,203
Maybe my trip hasn't
been a complete loss.

877
01:29:08,727 --> 01:29:11,036
Maybe I found those rotten apples
after all.

878
01:29:11,567 --> 01:29:15,116
I beg your pardon, sir?
I may wear shorts in the jungle.

879
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:19,640
And say, "gosh" and "doo doo"
but I know a frame up when I see one.

880
01:29:20,367 --> 01:29:24,440
Unless my eyes deceive me...
They probably do...

881
01:29:24,967 --> 01:29:27,765
You are a highly decorated soldier...

882
01:29:28,287 --> 01:29:30,596
Senator, kiss my highly decorated ass!

883
01:29:32,207 --> 01:29:35,961
I tried to make it easy for you
but there's no way to please you.

884
01:29:36,487 --> 01:29:39,365
I'll tell you what.
You go back to Washington

885
01:29:39,887 --> 01:29:42,162
go straight to the White House

886
01:29:42,687 --> 01:29:45,679
and pour your heart out
about what you think you saw here.

887
01:29:46,207 --> 01:29:50,962
Then sit back and watch
your political career die.

888
01:29:51,487 --> 01:29:55,878
You can't touch me without
cutting your own throat.

889
01:29:57,447 --> 01:30:00,484
You know why?
Because the President loves my ass!

890
01:30:02,007 --> 01:30:03,884
You really are second level, Rob.

891
01:30:06,727 --> 01:30:08,604
We go home now!

892
01:30:50,287 --> 01:30:52,721
Glad you could make it!

893
01:30:54,287 --> 01:30:57,802
Where's your bus?
Long story.

894
01:31:08,847 --> 01:31:12,920
Well, it's my last stop, boys.
One more pick up, then I off load.

895
01:31:13,447 --> 01:31:15,483
It's gravy from there on in.

896
01:31:16,967 --> 01:31:20,846
I had a map someplace
with the stops marked in crayon.

897
01:31:21,367 --> 01:31:22,766
Here it is.

898
01:31:23,647 --> 01:31:25,877
Navigate me to sky blue, please.

899
01:31:27,967 --> 01:31:29,559
Look at all the "friendlies."

900
01:31:30,087 --> 01:31:32,885
Soong's troops.
Been listening all morning.

901
01:31:33,647 --> 01:31:38,038
He's worried someone'll get
to the poppy fields before him.

902
01:31:38,567 --> 01:31:41,877
That's by the refugee camp, too.
That's where the poppies are.

903
01:32:05,247 --> 01:32:08,478
They're no more trucks
no more choppers.

904
01:32:09,007 --> 01:32:12,522
You go ahead, I'll send a call.
Corinne!

905
01:32:31,767 --> 01:32:34,998
Mayday! This is Scout Camp 1.
Enemy troops are moving in

906
01:32:35,527 --> 01:32:38,599
on General Soong
and we're caught in the cross fire.

907
01:32:39,127 --> 01:32:41,277
Request immediate assistance!

908
01:32:42,367 --> 01:32:45,404
Mayday! This is Scout Camp 1

909
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:47,280
requesting assistance.

910
01:32:48,807 --> 01:32:51,367
Mayday
we're under heavy mortar fire!

911
01:32:54,127 --> 01:32:57,881
This is Pirelli. We're about 15
minutes away. Anyone closer?

912
01:32:58,687 --> 01:33:02,282
We'll head in if nobody is closer.
Call us, please!

913
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:06,637
Mayday, mayday! To all aircraft!
We're under heave mortar fire

914
01:33:07,167 --> 01:33:10,398
at Scout Camp 1.
Do you read?

915
01:33:10,927 --> 01:33:14,237
Saunders and Pirelli
are almost as close as we are.

916
01:33:14,767 --> 01:33:17,281
Yeah
we're only about 5 minutes closer.

917
01:33:17,807 --> 01:33:19,081
At the most.

918
01:33:21,127 --> 01:33:22,480
Shut up!

919
01:33:23,007 --> 01:33:26,204
I've planned this day for a long time!
I didn't say anything!

920
01:33:26,727 --> 01:33:29,560
I don't have time to pick up
lost social workers!

921
01:33:30,087 --> 01:33:32,840
She chose to be there herself.

922
01:33:33,367 --> 01:33:36,279
I already pick you guys up.
I appreciate it.

923
01:33:36,807 --> 01:33:39,685
Thank you. She knew
what she was doing.

924
01:33:40,207 --> 01:33:41,481
God dammit!

925
01:33:42,007 --> 01:33:43,963
5 minutes won't kill us.

926
01:33:44,487 --> 01:33:47,479
She's skinny
she'll sit on a machine gun.

927
01:33:48,287 --> 01:33:49,686
Give me the heading.

928
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:52,277
160. Are you sure?

929
01:33:52,807 --> 01:33:54,286
Shut up!

930
01:33:58,407 --> 01:34:02,286
Keep your hands off the wheel.
We know what happens when you fly.

931
01:34:03,647 --> 01:34:06,639
We haven't heard.
Is anybody coming? Call us.

932
01:34:07,367 --> 01:34:10,882
I was changing in a phone booth.
We'll get her.

933
01:34:36,767 --> 01:34:38,837
This was a good idea of yours!

934
01:35:41,287 --> 01:35:44,996
I knew you guys would make it!
I think we can get everybody on board.

935
01:35:45,527 --> 01:35:48,200
No, we just came back for you.
He's fully loaded.

936
01:35:48,727 --> 01:35:50,001
Dump the fucking cargo!

937
01:35:51,047 --> 01:35:54,926
That's a problem.
I'm not leaving without them.

938
01:35:57,047 --> 01:35:58,799
Let's get this kid and get outta here!

939
01:36:02,687 --> 01:36:03,802
Come on!

940
01:36:05,207 --> 01:36:06,276
Let's go!

941
01:36:11,967 --> 01:36:13,366
Get on the plane.

942
01:36:13,887 --> 01:36:15,798
Not without these people!

943
01:36:16,327 --> 01:36:18,636
We came here to get you.
Get on the fucking plane!

944
01:36:19,167 --> 01:36:20,725
Dump your cargo.

945
01:36:39,007 --> 01:36:40,122
One minute.

946
01:36:41,687 --> 01:36:45,885
I got a crazy idea:
Cargo out, people in.

947
01:36:46,407 --> 01:36:47,442
Great!
Please!

948
01:36:47,967 --> 01:36:49,559
You better hurry.
You gotta do it.

949
01:36:50,087 --> 01:36:53,443
Otherwise you're just a 2nd Lemond
with a hipper rap.

950
01:36:56,127 --> 01:36:57,276
Knock it off, will ya?

951
01:37:04,927 --> 01:37:06,485
Goddamn!

952
01:37:08,287 --> 01:37:09,606
Hey, Mother Theresa!

953
01:37:10,127 --> 01:37:12,846
I was gonna do it anyway.
But I hate being lectured!

954
01:37:36,247 --> 01:37:38,124
"Slighly hipper rap?"

955
01:38:08,087 --> 01:38:10,282
Let's go! Quickly!

956
01:38:16,807 --> 01:38:20,720
Get up front and give it some stick!
Those shells are close.

957
01:39:40,047 --> 01:39:42,959
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard Air America Flight 1.

958
01:39:45,527 --> 01:39:48,883
You can unfasten your seatbelts
as soon as we're out of gun range.

959
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:51,842
I'd like to
apologize for that ground delay.

960
01:39:52,367 --> 01:39:54,403
We experienced material turbulence.

961
01:39:54,927 --> 01:39:57,919
On entertainment channel 3
you can hear music from

962
01:39:58,447 --> 01:40:02,235
that group "Gene Ryack and
the Redemption!"

963
01:40:02,807 --> 01:40:07,164
The Captain now has to explain to his
family what he did with their savings.

964
01:40:07,687 --> 01:40:09,040
Our flight path

965
01:40:09,567 --> 01:40:12,525
takes us over Anaheim
Azusa and the Mekong Delta

966
01:40:13,047 --> 01:40:14,924
to...

967
01:40:16,967 --> 01:40:17,922
Where we going?

968
01:40:18,447 --> 01:40:22,804
You're gonna help me make
my money back that you lost.

969
01:40:23,327 --> 01:40:26,364
I made you lose it?
I merely suggested.

970
01:40:26,887 --> 01:40:29,162
Do not blame me for the single
decent act of your adult life.

971
01:40:29,887 --> 01:40:32,037
Besides, where do I get the money?

972
01:40:33,847 --> 01:40:39,285
Here at crazy Gene's we've slashed
the prices on used C 123's.

973
01:40:39,807 --> 01:40:41,718
For your private army...
Forget it!

974
01:40:42,247 --> 01:40:44,920
No more problems
with those pesky border troops!

975
01:40:45,447 --> 01:40:47,403
This plane is US Goverment property.

976
01:40:47,927 --> 01:40:51,715
The US Government doesn't exist
in Laos. Neither does this plane.

977
01:40:52,807 --> 01:40:53,762
Right.

978
01:40:54,287 --> 01:40:57,643
We'll do what we do best.

979
01:40:58,167 --> 01:40:59,600
We fly!

980
