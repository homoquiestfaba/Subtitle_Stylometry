1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,760
Mr. Merdle, having got him away
from that little dancer once,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,479
I now find him
in her clutches again.

3
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:07,480
I need you to find him a post,
an occupation.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,280
I believe I need to hold a dinner.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,240
I find you perfect, my love.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,039
I wouldn't change
a single thing about you.

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,200
I am happy
but marriage is so... different.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,480
I never thought about
what it would really be like.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,319
This is most irregular.

10
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:28,199
Upon my soul! you mustn't just barge
in saying you want to know, you know!

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,880
But I do want to know.

12
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,480
How's a man to get anything done
is this benighted country?

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,479
In the old days...

14
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:38,959
We do not refer to the old days. Amy,
I demand that you conduct yourself

15
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:42,840
in a manner satisfactory
to myself and Mrs. General.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,040
Â£1,000, you know what I have.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,639
The man knows nothing!

18
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:53,680
He is not to be seen here again,
Flintwinch, or heard of again.

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,040
CHURCH BELLS RING

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
GONDOLIER YELLS IN DISTANCE

21
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:42,839
Amy?

22
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:44,240
Yes?

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,759
Has it ever struck you that
Papa and Mrs. General

24
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,480
are becoming very fond
of each other's company?

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,999
What do you mean, Fanny?

26
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:55,200
I mean that Mrs. General
has designs upon Papa

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,880
and he is not averse
to being designed upon!

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,640
How should you like Mrs. General
for a Mama, Amy?

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,159
I...

30
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,080
I don't think I should
like it very much.

31
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,440
I shouldn't like it at all.
I couldn't bear it!

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,279
I wouldn't bear it.
I'd marry Sparkler first.

33
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,800
Oh, Fanny. You said
you'd never marry Mr. Sparkler!

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,239
Circumstances alter cases.

35
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,679
Consider! you may be wrong
about Father and Mrs. General.

36
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:22,000
I may be...

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,279
but I am not.

38
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,839
'Dear Mr. Clennam,
we are still in Venice

39
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:40,760
'and my dear father and Fanny have
adapted themselves to our new fortune

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,400
'with wonderful ease.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
'I, however,
have not been able to do so.

42
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,199
'Mrs. General is always with us
and takes great pains to teach me,

43
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,879
'but I find my mind wandering to
my old cares.

44
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,759
'Then I remember
that there are no such cares left

45
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,319
'and I feel strangely lost.

46
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,799
'I have found great solace in Mrs.
Gowan's company,

47
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:59,200
'during these recent times,

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,760
'and I visit her almost every day
in her confinement.'

49

DISTRESSED PANTING

PET SCREAMS

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,599
The cloth, please.

52
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,079
SCREAMING CONTINUES

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,999
PET SCREAMS

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,399
We have no idea what women
go through at these times, Gowan.

55
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,800
So I understand, yes.

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, I know that you feel as I do.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,879
We wish we could bear the pain
for them but we can't.

58
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,599
Absolutely, absolutely...

59
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,280
Fatherhood! What a potent mixture
of joy and anxiety it is.

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,679
Oh, Pet...

61
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:02,560
You'll discover that for yourself and
it'll be the making of you as a man.

62
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,880
(Pompous buffoon!)

63
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,560
Sorry?
BABY CRIES

64
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,839
A little boy! And both well!

65
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:39,240
'Mrs. Gowan has had a little boy to
be called Henry, after his father.

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,959
'He is a beautiful child,
as you would expect.

67
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,720
'Mrs. Gowan likes me to be near her

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,040
'and help her look after little
Henry, which gives me great pleasure.

69
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,000
'So your Little Dorrit
is a great deal happier now

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,399
'and content to still be in Italy
for the time being.'

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,120
Amy!

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,680
I have a bone to pick with you.

73
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,199
Oh? Could it wait till this evening,
Fanny? I was just going out.

74
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,959
- Where, may I ask?
- To meet Mrs. Gowan.

75
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,919
That is just what I wanted
to mention to you.

76
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,039
Now, you may not realise it, dear,
but you're letting us all down again.

77
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:27,839
You've turned yourself into
a nursemaid for that Gowan family

78
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,920
and it's reflecting upon us.

79
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,560
You'll have everybody thinking
you're a common servant!

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,959
- Would it be so bad if they did?
- Yes, it would.

81
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,360
I am determined Mrs. Merdle shouldn't
have anything to sneer about.

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,960
But Mrs. Gowan likes to have me
near her.

83
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,840
I'm not saying
you should never go to them,

84
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,200
just don't let them take advantage
of you. We're ladies of leisure now.

85
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,560
I don't think I shall ever learn
to be a lady of leisure, Fanny.

86
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,599
Now that is not the spirit, is it?!
Of course it is hard.

87
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,839
It's downright boring sometimes
but one just has to work at it.

88
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,719
Do you not think
I sometimes long to dance

89
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,199
and do my high kicks
in the grand people's faces?

90
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,639
Do you really, Fanny?

91
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:10,959
Do I ever?!

92
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:14,319
One, two, three, kick!

93
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,720
Five, six, seven, kick!

94
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,960
Right in their silly
astonished faces!

95
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,639
But it wouldn't do, so I don't do it.

96
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,200
So, you see,
we all have to make sacrifices.

97
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,640
Even Sparkler's making sacrifices.

98
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm teaching him not to say

99
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,639
I'm a damn fine girl
with no biggod nonsense about me.

100
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,959
- And he's getting a job.
- What? Here, in Italy?

101
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,760
No, in England.
Mr. Merdle's going to get him one.

102
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,719
Mr. Merdle, he can do anything.

103
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,200
'The first Lord of the Treasury.'

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,960
The Lord Chancellor.

105
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,839
The Bishop of Southwark.

106
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,320
Mr. Eustace Barnacle
of the Circumlocution Office.

107
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,999
Mr. Septimus Barnacle
of the Circumlocution Office.

108
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:11,840
Mr. Tite Barnacle, Principle
of the Circumlocution Office.

109
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,120
Lord Decimus Barnacle, First Lord
of the Circumlocution Office.

110
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,240
Mr. Ferdinand Barnacle...

111
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,879
A lot of Barnacles tonight.

112
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,959
They all come out for Merdle.

113
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,320
I understand this evening is about
a little bit of jobbery.

114
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,759
Mrs. Merdle's son by her previous
marriage, name of Sparkler.

115
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,279
- Do you know the boy?
- Nice young fellow.

116
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,839
Absolutely nothing between the ears
at all. A total blank.

117
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,320
They're fixing him up with something
at the Circumlocution Office.

118
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,480
Well,
I suppose he'll do no harm there.

119
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,079
No good either. Oh, come on...

120
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:50,680
MEN LAUGH, CUTLERY CLATTERS

121
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,759
And so we pass, gentlemen,
through the various changes of life,

122
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,159
from Eton pears
to Parliamentary pairs!

123
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:06,400
Excellent, sir,
never heard you on such good form!

124
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,240
We are all sorry
not to have the pleasure

125
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,520
of Mrs. Merdle's company
this evening.

126
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,919
She is in Italy, sir.

127
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,319
Ah, Mrs. Merdle's son has been
spoken of... Mr. Sprinkler?

128
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,039
Mr. Sparkler, sir.

129
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,079
Sparkler, of course. He was mentioned
in the context of a possible opening?

130
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,959
If you please, sir.

131
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,680
Is he here this evening?

132
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,679
In Italy, with Mrs. Merdle.

133
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,320
Ah, well...

134
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,199
it's not indispensable that he
should actually be on the spot.

135
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:44,000
The magic name of Merdle
will suffice.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,679
Quite so.

137
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,799
I think we may consider it settled.

138
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,680
Thank you, sir.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,479
STRINGED INSTRUMENTS PLAY

140
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,480
MUSIC STOPS

141
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
Bravo!

142
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,719
Yes! Dear Edmund is to be one of the
Lords of the Circumlocution Office.

143
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:39,279
I expect you may have seen
the notice in the Times.

144
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,959
What a pity it will take him
away from us all!

145
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,440
Congratulations, old fellow!

146
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,640
Feet under the table now, eh?
Well done!

147
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,760
Well, point of fact, didn't actually
do anything. Thing just happened.

148
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,399
It's a total mystery to me.

149
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,239
It will keep him in town a deal

150
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,480
and he prefers the country,
don't you, Edmund?

151
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,360
Well, I am fond of ratting
with a couple of good terriers.

152
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,200
Not much ratting in Venice.
Lot of rats though. Odd that.

153
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,440
- Edmund.
- Yes?

154
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,479
- Be quiet.
- Right.

155
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:10,040
Still, though the Circumlocution
may not be ideally suited

156
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,279
to Edmund's talents, it is a position
and not a disagreeable one.

157
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,040
Quite, and without wishing to
disparage Mr. Sparkler's abilities,

158
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,600
I think we must see the appointment

159
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,679
as a compliment to Mr. Merdle -
the man of the age!

160
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,880
Thank you, Mr. Dorrit,
that may well be so.

161
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,279
POLITE CHATTER

162
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,040
- How we do fret about our children.
- How indeed.

163
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,959
I wish you joy, my dear old fellow!

164
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,120
There will be nothing to do
and you will do it charmingly!

165
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,280
There'll be a handsome salary to
draw and you'll draw it charmingly!

166
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,120
Eh? I'm delighted to see my dear
old donkey so admirably stabled!

167
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,760
Well, you know, I...

168
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,840
I dare say you wouldn't say no to
such a stable yourself, Mr. Gowan.

169
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,360
Indeed, no, but my relations seem
to have sadly overlooked my talents.

170
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,280
Leaving you to sponge off
the in-laws you affect to despise.

171
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,520
I say!
You know, Fanny, draw it mild!

172
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,879
I'm not sure Miss Dorrit knows how
to draw it mild but I am rebuked.

173
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,080
I don't suppose
you'll change your ways, though.

174
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,439
No, Miss Dorrit,
I don't suppose I will.

175
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,519
I suppose I should congratulate you,
Mr. Sparkler.

176
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,120
I've spent a good deal of time
at the Circumlocution Office

177
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,239
and I never heard one word of sense
in all that time.

178
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:44,480
They seemed to me
the very epitome of how not to do it!

179
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,439
Well, you know,
I've not got in there yet.

180
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:49,960
It's not as if I'm up
to the mark yet.

181
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,359
You'll have to forgive me but all
I've seen anyone do at that place

182
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,119
is push pieces of paper around

183
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:57,359
and give each other jobs for life

184
00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:00,640
and let the country go to
rack and ruin in the mean time.

185
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Barnacles, yes, a well-named family!

186
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,240
Steady, Mr. Meagles.

187
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,520
I must insist, sir, that you
do not speak disrespectfully

188
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,880
of a very distinguished family.

189
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,559
and your good friend, Mr. Clennam,
will say the same.

190
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,439
He spent day after day at that place,

191
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,640
trying to get some sense out of them
about your tangled affairs

192
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,079
and precious little good it did him,

193
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,639
or you, sir!

194
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,399
'Private gentlemen.
Well put. You're very good, sir.'

195
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,440
'We should have made each others
acquaintance before, should we not?'

196
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,919
Aitchoo!

197
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,199
KEYS JANGLE

198
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:40,000
DOOR LOCKS

199
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,199
Poor Pa, he does suffer so.

200
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,080
I felt sorry for
Mr. and Mrs. Meagles too.

201
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,480
The Meagleses are all very well.

202
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,600
They're happy, they know their place

203
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,839
and they don't care tuppence
for what the world thinks of them.

204
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,080
We, on the other hand,
labour under peculiar disadvantages.

205
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,039
Don't tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about.

206
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:07,399
I'm sure I shall,
after a few more words.

207
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,599
We're not quite the thing, are we?

208
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,159
Some of us look the thing.

209
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,520
Pa is very gentlemanly

210
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,520
but he's terrified of people
knowing what he once was.

211
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,480
And Uncle, though a dear creature,
is altogether unpresentable.

212
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,839
Edward is frightfully expensive
and dissipated.

213
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,480
He isn't even any good at it -
the, um... dissipation, I mean.

214
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
And then there's you and me.

215
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,879
And we don't have a mother

216
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,640
but we do have a Mrs. General,

217
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,600
who goes about like a cat in gloves
and she will catch a mouse

218
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,879
and the mouse she'll catch is Papa.
- Fanny!

219
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,119
I refuse to be step-mothered
by Mrs. General.

220
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:53,720
The sooner I become Mrs. Sparkler
the better.

221
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,840
He has a good position now

222
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,040
and I don't think a clever husband
should suit me.

223
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,199
I shouldn't be able
to defer to him enough.

224
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:03,919
But, Fanny, if you loved someone,
that feeling would change.

225
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,839
I know it would!

226
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,999
Oh! You know that, do you?
Oh, bless me!

227
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:13,480
How much some people know
about some subjects!

228
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Well, they say everybody has
a subject and we've hit upon yours!

229
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,639
Don't tease me, Fanny.

230
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,280
It's only in fun, little one.

231
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,760
Fanny...
you do deserve someone you love.

232
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
Well, maybe I do,

233
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,239
but there he is.

234
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,080
And as Mrs. Sparkler, I shall be able
to torment his mother -

235
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,679
that piece of insolence -
for the rest of her life.

236
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,760
That little dancer
she gave her old bangle to,

237
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,839
she will dance through her life.

238
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,640
Mow there is a face I'd like
to land a good high kick on!

239
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,080
Fanny, you wouldn't marry Mr. Sparkler
just to annoy Mrs. Merdle!

240
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,400
Now don't look so anxious.

241
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,359
We have talked it over comfortably
and now it's time for bed.

242
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:06,600
Oh, you are the best
and dearest little mouse, Amy.

243
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:11,000
Good night.

244
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,599
I refuse to know you, sir.

245
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,400
I refuse to know you.

246
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,360
Father?

247
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,239
- Not in bed yet?
- No, no, I, er...

248
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:46,840
Let me help you to bed, Father.

249
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,479
Help me?

250
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,919
I am perfectly capable.

251
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,080
I know, Father.

252
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,959
But I should like to help you...
as I used to.

253
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,559
You should say Papa, you know.

254
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,439
I know. I keep forgetting.

255
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:06,880
Miss Amy Dorrit,
what are we to do with you?

256
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,279
I don't know, Papa.

257
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,039
I'm a disgrace, aren't I?

258
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,159
I fear you are.

259
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:23,120
But you're a good girl, Amy,
for all that.

260
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,880
You're a good girl.

261
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,959
Ah, Mr. Blandois!
Very prompt. Very punctual.

262
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,639
Always, for you,
my dear little Flintwinch.

263
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,839
Let's go in here and have
a few glasses and talk it over.

264
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,560
They don't know me here.

265
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,960
Well, let's put that right,
shall we?

266
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,840
DOG BARKS

267
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,640
Have you seen this, Mr. Clennam?

268
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,839
I know that man!

269
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,159
Blan-DOYS.

270
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,520
Blandois, a Frenchman.

271
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,120
Last seen at Clennam & Co.

272
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,360
Surely they don't suspect
my mother of foul play, do they?

273
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,399
They wouldn't issue a handbill
like this if they didn't.

274
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:33,280
My God.

275
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,799
On your way!

276
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,959
How did it seem to you, Mr. Clennam,

277
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,439
when you saw this man
at your mother's house?

278
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:43,319
She said she had business with him.

279
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,999
Any idea what this business was?

280
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,559
My mother has never in her life
taken me into her confidence.

281
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,719
Try her again, Mr. Clennam.
She's in trouble now.

282
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:54,520
She'll have to swallow her pride
and accept help.

283
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,200
Well, we'll see.
Signor! Signor!

284
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,320
Signor! This is him! The bad man!

285
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,520
You know him? You know Blandois?

286
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,120
No, no, no, no. No Blandois!

287
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,840
He is call Rigaud
and he is a killer!

288
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,359
Good day, Constable.

289
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,519
Flintwinch, what's going on here?
What did the Constable want to know?

290
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:32,720
No need to worry, Arthur.
We're right as rain here, we are.

291
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,399
Here he is.

292
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:37,760
How are you, Mother?

293
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,960
I am exactly as I was the last time
you called here, Arthur.

294
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,320
I'm relieved to hear it, after
your visit from that Frenchman.

295
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,960
You were right to suspect him.
He's not as he presented himself.

296
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,120
- And now he has disappeared?
- Yes.

297
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,160
That is not your concern. You severed
all connections with the firm.

298
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,800
I am still your son, Mother.

299
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,560
I am concerned about you.

300
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,080
There is no need to be.

301
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,519
Monsieur Blandois,
if that is indeed his real name,

302
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,439
came to Clennam and Company
with a business proposition

303
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:18,239
which, after consideration,
we declined.

304
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:22,400
is what I told the constable.

305
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,639
I have been told that this man
is a notorious criminal.

306
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,680
I'm glad I have nothing
to do with him.

307
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,600
Mother, this is a serious matter.

308
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,799
The authorities believe this man has
been murdered.

309
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,719
Do they indeed?

310
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:36,719
And I am suspected, am I?

311
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,200
Then let them produce the body

312
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,079
confined to this chair,
could have committed the crime.

313
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,280
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm rather tired.

314
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,279
Yes, of course.

315
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,279
Mother... I worry about you,

316
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,279
trapped up here in this room.

317
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:03,880
I've hardly seen you
since I got back from China.

318
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:09,519
I'd like to call on you more often,
make sure that you're well.

319
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:15,079
That won't be necessary.

320
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,320
I may be paralysed...

321
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,960
but I'm not a weakling,
like your father was.

322
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,680
Goodbye, Arthur.

323
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,600
Shut the doors.

324
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,520
CHURCH BELLS RING

325
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,840
- Oh!
- Oh, indeed!

326
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,839
I suppose you know what this means,
little sister?

327
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,080
Well, you mean you...?

328
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,960
She's as beautiful as she's doted on

329
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,200
and there's no nonsense about her.
It's all arranged.

330
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,919
- No need to explain, Edmund.
- No, my love.

331
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,599
In short, we're engaged.

332
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,319
We just tell Papa and there's
nothing more to say about it.

333
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,520
My dear Fanny,
I should like to say a word to Amy.

334
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,239
Must you?

335
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:50,799
I think I must, my love!

336
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,280
Well, go on then.

337
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,319
My dear Amy,
if ever there was a girl -

338
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:02,159
next to your highly-endowed
and beautiful sister -

339
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,240
who had no nonsense about her,
not one atom of...

340
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,680
Edmund!

341
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,280
I know it's a habit of mine,
for which I apologise,

342
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,360
but she really hasn't got
the least little bit...

343
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:16,600
What I wished to declare is that,

344
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,560
though I may not be up to the mark
on some subjects,

345
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,159
on the subject of Amy
I am up to the mark.

346
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:31,360
And, when we are at home in London,
a knife and, er...

347
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:38,159
fork and an apartment
will always be at Amy's disposal.

348
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,440
There...

349
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,839
So...

350
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,640
Ah. Yes.

351
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,280
There, there.

352
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,080
It'll be all right. I promise.

353
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,439
My dear Fanny, I am delighted.

354
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,679
On the arm of Mr. Sparkler,

355
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,840
you will move in circles
at the very pinnacle of society.

356
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:18,479
Your noble ambition
finds harmonious echoes in my heart.

357
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,560
You are a child brimful of duty
and good principle.

358
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,320
Thank you, Papa.

359
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,119
Mark and learn, Amy.

360
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,919
Mark and learn.

361
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,319
'Dear Mr. Clennam,

362
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:48,440
'I received some news last night,
which allows me to hope

363
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,880
'that I may soon be leaving Italy
and returning to London.

364
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,759
'My sister Fanny and Edmund Sparkler
are to be married.

365
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,800
'Mr. Sparkler has secured a position
at the Circumlocution Office and,

366
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,199
'as soon as they are married,

367
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:04,239
'he and Fanny will travel to England
to start their new life.

368
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:07,000
'It is my dearest wish
to travel with them

369
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,279
'but I think I must wait
so that I may travel with my father.'

370
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:13,120
In nominee Patris et Filii

371
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,680
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

372
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:42,839
Amy,
now that your sister is married,

373
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:46,360
she and her husband
will travel to London

374
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,799
to take up residence
in the Merdle household.

375
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,760
I myself intend to travel with them.

376
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,800
I've some affairs to settle in
London - investments and so forth.

377
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Indeed, I hope to consult
with Mr. Merdle about them.

378
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,600
So we shall all go back together?

379
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,999
No. Edward is going to do some
exploring, I believe,

380
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:09,400
and you and your uncle Frederick
will stay here.

381
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,920
You will, of course, be under the
excellent supervision of Mrs. General.

382
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,720
Couldn't I travel with you and look
after you on the journey to London?

383
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,839
Whatever makes you think
I need looking after?

384
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,000
HE CHUCKLES

385
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,079
No, no, no.
Much better that you stay here.

386
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:32,800
It is to be hoped, Amy, that one
day you too will find a husband

387
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,679
but Mrs. General and I agree

388
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,760
that you have some way to go yet
before that may be possible.

389
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,399
To be frank, my dear,
you're not yet quite presentable...

390
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,999
in society.

391
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,759
Mrs. General has a little more...

392
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,640
a little more forming to do,
in your case.

393
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,400
Isn't that so, Mrs. General?

394
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,760
I fear it is, Mr. Dorrit.

395
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:21,599
I've been approached
by a factory in St. Petersburg.

396
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,799
I hope you've said yes!

397
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,799
We ought to make our capital work for
us. I want to put it into Merdle.

398
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,000
I should be grateful if you could
give me the benefit of your advice

399
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,920
as to the prudent investment
of my capital.

400
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,360
- Why the devil are you here?!
- I brought you cigars.

401
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,560
Damn your cigars! I don't smoke!
