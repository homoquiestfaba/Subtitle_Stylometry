Corner of Wiltern and Wetherly.

50
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,132
Tumbler messed up.
He said the Porsche would be
at the corner of Wiltern and Wetherly.

51
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,218
- It's right there.
- You're bullshittin' me, right?

52
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,679
- 9024 Wiltern?
- What?

53
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,349
- That?
- I gotta get my tool.

54
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,603
- Kip!
- He ain't bullshittin'.

55
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,567
Kip! Man, that's not a tool.
That's a damn brick.

56
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,112
Kip, man, we gonna use a brick, man,
we might as well call prison
and make reservations.

57
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,406
Aw, come on.

58
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,120
- Oh--
- Get the number.

59
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,167
42850.

60
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,919
Hurry up, man.

61
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,631
Man, let's go!

62
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,469
Let's get the hell outta here.

63
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,804
Okay, Billy Bad-ass,
you got us in here.

64
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,933
Now tell me
how the hell we gonna get out.

65
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,936
Oh, no, I know you ain't gonna do
what I think you're gonna do.

66
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,980
- Oh, man!
- Come on!

67
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,318
- This ain't The Dukes ofHazzard!
- Come on!

68
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,045
Yo, so check out my new move.
I call it the stranger.

69
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,881
What I do is, I sit on my hand...

70
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,009
for, like, 1 5, 20 minutes,
until it goes numb.

71
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,803
No feeling at all.

72
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,307
- And then I rub one out.
- The stranger, huh?

73
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:12,104
It's like a little boy's nursery school
I've come upon here.

74
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,398
Where are they?

75
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,320
- Yeah.
- You want to? All right.
- Hey!

76
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,865
- Man, leave those people alone, man.
- Oh, my God, sweetie,
you're so talented.

77
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,199
- What-- Hey. Hey.
- What did he say?

78
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,160
- No. Stop. No! No!
- Stolen car. Stolen car.

79
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,496
Hey, I-- I love you.

80
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,252
Man, we going tojail, man!

81
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,631
Come on!

82
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,805
Put your hands behind your back.
You have the right to remain silent.

83
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,808
Hey, watch it!

84
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,272
We have a silver Porsche,
estimated speed 80 miles per hour...

85
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,024
heading west on Wilshire Boulevard.

86
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,526
Yeah.

87
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,486
This is Air One.
We have a visual of the suspect.

88
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,739
Southbound on Vincent Thomas Bridge.

89
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,496
- Something wrong, Tumbler?
- Yeah. I'm missing Jerry Springer.

90
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,379
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

91
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,262
That's right, that's right,
that's right.

92
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,686
- What's up, old man?
- She'll go zero to 60 in 5.2. seconds.

93
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,689
Believe me, I can vouch for that.

94
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,985
Ground units, be advised, suspects last
seen entering south side of warehouse.

95
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,531
Thirteen down,
thirty-seven to go.

96
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,331
- What the hell is that?
- What is that, man?

97
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,999
- Now you've gone and done it, Raines.
- What is that?

98
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,001
- Tumbler!
- What's going on?
- Get the board and get the lights!

99
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,505
- All right, I got it, I got it!
- This is bullshit!

100
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,173
- It's not comin' off!
- Keys! Get the keys!

101
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,926
- I got 'em, I got 'em!
- Come on, everybody, let's go!
Hurry up!

102
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,387
- I got it!
- Let's go!

103
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,223
Toby, get it!
Let's go, boys!

104
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,851
Come on, come on, come on!
I got the light! I got the light!

105
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,687
Go, go, go! Let's go!

106
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,566
- Get busy, get busy, get busy
- Shit!
- l guess l didn't know

107
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,781
l guess l didn't know
Get busy time

108
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,242
l guess l didn't
l guess l didn't know

109
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,871
We got tape
all over the other side.

110
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,165
- Get the VIN number on that?
- Got it.

111
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,837
- We've got some more lamp shades
by the truck.
- Let's get those tools dusted.

112
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,755
What do we got?

113
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,008
All gone.
We didn't get a single one of them.

114
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,552
And we are talkin' about professionals.

115
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,806
No visible damage to locking mechanisms,
steering columns or ignitions...

116
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,143
and, as you can see,
these are not Honda Civics.

117
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,062
This is one ofthree
brand new Mercedes...

118
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,108
a car they say is unstealable.

119
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,652
Yeah, unless you get the laser-cut
transponder key...

120
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,363
sent directly to the U.S. dealer
from Hamburg.

121
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,240
They got somebody
working on the inside.

122
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,493
Let's find out which dealership
sold 'em, who serviced 'em,
et cetera, et cetera.

123
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,038
Yeah, I'll get on it.

124
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,292
- Mr Drycoff?
- Yeah?

125
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,628
Let's impound these cars
for one month.

126
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:26,006
I don't give a damn
ifthey belong to Tom Cruise.

127
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:56,453
Control, vision, determination.

128
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,914
These are the three
fundamental components...

129
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,917
of the new generation race car driver.

130
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,295
Speed is a byproduct.
Going fa st.

131
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:10,384
But remember:
The car is you, you are the car.

132
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,471
Okay? Let's ride!

133
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,896
Billy, you just shaved one second
off your lap time!

134
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,621
Tommy, I don't know what that was,
but it wasn't driving.

135
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,252
Go get 'em.

136
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,345
Well, well, well.

137
00:09:55,512 --> 00:10:00,601
What do you pay your pit crews with,
Oreos and Gummi Bears?

138
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,396
I folded, Atley. You know that.
What are you doing here?

139
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,648
- Is there some place we can talk?
- About what?

140
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,193
About your brother
and the deep shit he's in.

141
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,447
Frank. Would you watch the kids
for a minute?

142
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:24,917
- Tell me about Kip.
- He took a job and he fumbled it.

143
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,754
Now he's jammed up.
He's jammed up bad.

144
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:33,759
- What kind ofjob?
- A boost. A big boost.

145
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,261
A boost.

146
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,517
What's Kip doin' on a boost?

147
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,894
Oh, you're shittin' me, man.

148
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,065
Kip's become quite the little
crew runner since you left.

149
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,152
- You don't talk to your ma?
- She neglected to mention it.

150
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,074
Listen, I need somethin'.
I-I need somethin' cold to drink.

151
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,702
I thought we were goin'
someplace to talk.

152
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:11,296
- Who was the job for?
- A new guy named Raymond Calitri.

153
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,590
They call him ''The Carpenter.''

154
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,802
He's runnin'
all the dark ponies down there now.

155
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:20,889
It's a full-on
''Devil Came Down to Long Beach'' trip.

156
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:25,018
He's bad. He's real bad.

157
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,897
And this Calitri
is the one who's after my brother?

158
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,941
Like stains on a mattress.

159
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,404
And you should know,
I work for him.

160
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:43,078
There weren't a lot ofopportunities
for retired car thieves on the gimp.

161
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:46,039
He put me to work.

162
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:51,879
But I gotta tell you, Memphis, this guy,
he scares the shit out of even me.

163
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,486
What are you doing, man?

164
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:20,240
Stop! Stop!

165
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,707
AtleyJackson.

166
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,877
Right. They have Kip.

167
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,213
Take me there.

168
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:07,037
Raymond Calitri, Memphis Raines.

169
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:11,583
I try to learn your ways,
understand your obsessions.

170
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,420
But this baseball,
it's so bleeding boring. Isn't it?

171
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,048
Where's my brother?

172
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,928
Memphis Raines.
Your legend proceeds you.

173
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,347
Atley tells me you're the best.

174
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:29,184
Afteryou left, auto theft in
the South Bay area went down 47 percent.

175
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,062
Where's my brother?

176
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,901
I'm proud of these. Straddle chair
from the Arts and Crafts period.

177
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:41,697
Mahogany table with cloud-lift pattern.
Black walnut wine table.

178
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:45,784
Metal's cold, ugly.
Wood's warm, clean.

179
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,453
Provided by nature.

180
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,250
To see a piece of furniture take shape,
it's like watching a child grow.

181
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,086
I asked you a question.

182
00:13:56,253 --> 00:14:00,048
They threw us out England, threw us
out of France, but here we are.

183
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:04,928
Flourishing, really, except for
the minor inconvenience of despising
everything about your country.

184
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,474
On this list you'll find 50 cars--
five, zero.

185
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:15,189
I need all 50 delivered
to Long Beach Harbor, pier 1 4,
by 8:00 a.m. four days from now.

186
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,316
I'm paying $200,000.

187
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,902
I'm not interested.
I'm just here for my brother.

188
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,363
Your Kip came to me.
He had street cred.

189
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,450
The brother
of the notorious Memphis Raines.

190
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:30,329
So two weeks ago I hired him
and advanced him $1 0,000.

191
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:35,334
Atley told me. If it's about the
advance, I can understand your anger.

192
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:41,006
A debt has to be settled.
Ten grand, from me to you.

193
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:44,134
- I wish it was that easy.
- I don't see the complication.

194
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,429
I have four days to deliver 50 cars,
and I have no cars.

195
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,767
- Well, that's another problem.
- It is another problem, isn't it?

196
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,812
It's about me delivering 50 top-end cars
because I said I would...

197
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:59,024
because if I don't my South American
friend goes somewhere else from now on.

198
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,235
And that's not good.
It's a humiliation.

199
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,529
Because I'm the asshole
who said I could deliver.

200
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:07,449
Am I an asshole?
Do I look like an asshole?

201
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,160
Yeah.

202
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,082
- I need that paper satisfied.
- I'm retired.

203
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:18,293
Now, where the hell is my brother?

204
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:26,885
I made this as well.
My first one.

205
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,031
It takes 80,000 pounds of pressure
to crush a car.

206
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,169
Kip?

207
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,754
- Who's that?
- Memphis.

208
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,300
- Oh, shit.
- You okay?

209
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,557
- Shut it off!
- Turn it off!

210
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,810
- You've got 30 seconds
to consideryour options.
- Shut it off!

211
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,980
One: You kill me, they kill you,
your brother dies anyway.

212
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:24,735
Two: You lie, you accept the job,
you take your brother, you run.

213
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:27,196
I hunt you down, I kill you,
I kill your brother...

214
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,908
and I kill your mother
for the aggravation you've caused me.

215
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:35,370
Three: You accept the deal, you steal
some cars, you make some money...

216
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,789
and you be a big brother.

217
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,717
- Memphis!
- 8:00 a.m. Friday morning.

218
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,803
The cars are on the boat,
or your brother's in the coffi n.

219
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,432
Get me out of here!
Somebody get me out of here!

220
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,317
Listen, you don't really
have to make me anything.

221
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:10,113
Oh, hey, you come down here, you
save my ass, it's the least I can do.

222
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,079
Hey, I heard you were pumpin' gas
someplace up north or somethin', right?

223
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,748
- Yeah, I'm workin' with kids.
- Oh, really?

224
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,962
First place.

225
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,048
I remember this.

226
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,135
Oh, yeah, that was a--
that was a long time ago.

227
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,977
Yeah.

228
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,941
- What'd you put in it?
- I don't know.

229
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,490
It's good.

230
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,954
Ow. Ow.

231
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:02,249
Oh, God.

232
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,752
- Does Mom know about any of this?
- No, no, no, she doesn't.

233
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,838
And, uh, I don't think she should.

234
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:13,760
You know, she-- she works really hard,
and this, this-- she doesn't need
to know about any of this stuff.

235
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,971
Look, you know,
I got everything under control.

236
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,684
The kitchen's on fi re.

237
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,232
Uh, man.

238
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:37,701
Hey, Memphis.

239
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,578
It's good to see you.

240
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,960
Yeah, haul the cartons over there!

241
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,421
- Hey, Fuzzy.
- Aw, shit. What are you doing here?

242
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:53,967
- I told you I don't know anything.
- Yeah, but you're a liar.

243
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,763
- You're gonna get me fired, man.
- Fired? That's not good.
You're on parole, right?

244
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,058
Fuzzy. Hey.
Nobody wants to get you fired.

245
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:04,561
Wejust need this information
is all.

246
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,481
Two weeks ago a call came in
for a lot oftop-end cars.

247
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,983
- And who made that call?
- I don't have a clue.

248
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,904
- Okay, we'll just go talk to your boss.
- Shh!

249
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,281
The delivery date.
I know the delivery date.

250
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,409
- And when is that?
- Thursday, Friday, end of the week.

251
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:23,080
Well, you get me a name within 48 hours,
or we'll be back.

252
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,832
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Thankyou.

253
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,507
- I'm looking for Helen Raines.
- Helen.

254
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:37,052
- Some guy is here foryou.
- What guy? What's he look like?

255
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:41,390
Like a fi recracker. Like your son.

256
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:44,601
- You look so good.
- Thankyou, Mom.

257
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,646
Okay, Spring, uh-- Spring Bouquet.

258
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:52,359
-What are you doing here?
-Well, uh, AtleyJackson came to see me.

259
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,862
He told me something about Kip.

260
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,364
Can I help you with one of these?

261
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,370
Okay. That's yours.

262
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:07,958
Tell Castlebeck he's not gonna believe
who just walked into the Quality Cafe.

263
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,086
I can't say I'm surprised.

264
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:15,424
All his life he looked up to you,
tried to be you.

265
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:18,093
I guess now he is.

266
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,388
So why is this happening?
I send you guys money.

267
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:25,475
He-- He met some people,
and he changed.

268
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:30,480
He lost that-- that s-sweetness.
You know?

269
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,861
Okay, tell me.

270
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:39,531
- How deep in is he?
- Deep.

271
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:42,659
Can you get him out?

272
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,538
It means doing things.

273
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,792
Things I told you
I'd never do again.

274
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,879
Do what it takes, Randall.

275
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:09,144
- When did you get into town, Raines?
- Last night.

276
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,189
- Last night? What for?
- I thought I'd catch a Lakers game.

277
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:16,193
Heard we got Shaquille.
Guys wanna go?

278
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,447
- Guess not.
- Randall, Randall, Randall. Come here.

279
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,825
I get this call from this uniform,
you know.

280
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,245
Axton. Very nice man.
Remembers everything.

281
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,580
This man calls me up, says,
''Guess who's back in town?''

282
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,791
I say, ''Who?''
He says, ''Randall Raines.''

283
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,918
I say, ''Randall Raines, the car thief? ''
He says, ''Yeah.''

284
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,461
I say, ''Impossible.''
He says, ''No, he's back.''

285
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,924
I say, ''No, he's not.''
He says, ''Yes, I will bet you $200
I just saw Randall Raines.''

286
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:43,011
- You guys said a lot. Look, Detective--
- No, w-w-whoa, whoa.

287
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,222
What's really,
really ironic about this--

288
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:49,142
Two nights ago we snare these 1 3
fresh stolens waiting for export, right?

289
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:53,689
And at the time I'm thinking,
''This feels like Randall Raines.''

290
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:56,775
Now, it didn't have your panache,
your, uh, flash...

291
00:21:56,942 --> 00:22:00,070
but it just fe lt like Randall Raines.

292
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,822
And now here you are.

293
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:05,576
Look, I don't know what you boys are
looking for, but I just got back. Okay?

294
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,245
It was a family emergency.
Now, that's the truth.

295
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:11,790
''Family emergency.'' Yeah, I got
a family emergency too, Randall.

296
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:15,752
I gotta go tell my woman
that I just lost $200 on a stupid deal.

297
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,506
- Mmm, she's mean.
- What?

298
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,759
She can be mean to m--
It's not so--

299
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,470
Come here. Come here, Randall.

300
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:28,348
Take those glasses off, man, please.
Do me a favour.

301
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:34,229
Six years ago you make
a real smart move, you know.

302
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:37,691
You retire from a life
that's gonna get you busted or killed,
or maybe even both.

303
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:41,111
And I'm thinkin' that not putting you
away when I had a chance...

304
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:46,491
is like this big bug up the ass of this
real impressive career that I've had.

305
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:52,706
Oh, yeah, well, without disappointment,
you can't appreciate victory.

306
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:57,002
- Eleanor tell you that?
- Well, now, that's hittin'
below the belt.

307
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,921
Yeah, all right, let me tell you
about ''below the belt,'' Randall.

308
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,674
I tell you what-- From here on out,
ifyou walk across the street
outside of a cross walk...

309
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:08,096
ifyou roll through a stop sign,
ifyou use an aerosol can in a manner
other than directed--

310
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:13,519
I mean, I don't care. You make one slip,
and I will put you away for good.

311
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:17,731
- Okay.
- By the time you get out, asshole,
there won't even be cars.

312
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:22,945
We'll all be cruisin' around
in, you know, little spaceships.

313
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,447
That's gonna suck.

314
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:31,328
- Who's Eleanor?
- It's a damn car.

315
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:34,456
And don't you ever talk about my wife.

316
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,549
Excuse me.
Do you know where Otto is?

317
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:46,677
He's in the back in the paint shop.

318
00:23:56,603 --> 00:24:00,566
Is that you?
It's about time you came to see me.

319
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:03,610
- H-Hey!
- I missed you.
- It's good to see you!

320
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,905
- You look great.
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

321
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:10,325
- Ah. You remember myJunie?
- Hey,Junie. How are you?

322
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,911
- We're doing good, thankyou.
- Good. Good.

323
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:18,542
- You look happy.
- Well, I am happy. I really am.

324
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,377
- So what happened here?
- What do you mean?

325
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:25,507
Well, it's nice. But the chop shop,
the stripped cars, my education--

326
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,385
What happened? Hey.

327
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:32,306
Old age happened, that's what happened.
Got tired of killin' 'em.

328
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,142
You know, I woke up
one morning and thought...

329
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,853
''I'm no longer a destroyer.
I am a means of resurrection.''

330
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,939
Now we restore, we revive.

331
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:43,317
- Come here.
Remember when we used to do this?
- What?

332
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,611
You know. Come here. Okay.

333
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:53,202
The Ferrari 365 GDB4, Daytona.
Le Mans, 1 971 .

334
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,037
- Five cam--
- No, that's a V-1 2.

335
00:24:55,204 --> 00:25:02,002
V-1 2! Right, right, right, right!
Here it peaks at 5,500 r.p.m.!

336
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,047
-What do you know about Raymond Calitri?
-Who?

337
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:08,592
Raymond Calitri.

338
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,220
Uh, excuse us, sweetness.
I'll be right back.

339
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:14,056
- Listen, we can talk right here.
- Okay? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's all right.

340
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:16,183
Raymond Calitri.

341
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,146
He's a jackal tearing at the soft belly
ofour-- of our fair town.

342
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,901
And he's an asshole to boot,
so be careful.

343
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,737
I heard about Kip.

344
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,491
- Are you considering a comeback tour?
- Do you think it can be done?

345
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:36,328
Don't do this to me, okay?
Pl-- Please.

346
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:39,665
Please. Not now.

347
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,251
Oh, man.

348
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:51,343
- How many cars?
- Fifty.

349
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,846
- How many days?
- Three.

350
00:25:55,639 --> 00:26:00,561
- How many in your crew?
- One, but I came here hoping
to negotiate for a second.

351
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:05,065
No way. It can't be done.
I mean, you need time to prep,
time to shop. You know that.

352
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,610
It has to be.
They're gonna kill him.

353
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:14,074
Oh, man.

354
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,628
It was a mistake to come here.

355
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:31,008
You have a great life now.
I don't want to upset that.

356
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,389
Uh, uh, wait a minute.
Whoa. Hold on.

357
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:40,017
Look around you.

358
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:44,730
These days
I'm all about second chances.

359
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:49,234
So, uh, let's make a few phone calls
and we'll go from there, okay?

360
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:50,986
Okay.

361
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:56,491
Don't look at me!
Look at the people next to you!
Next to you! Turn the wheel!

362
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:01,622
Pull over!
Pull it the hell over!

363
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,666
Asshole!
Learn how to drive!

364
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:10,506
Don't touch nothin'.Just--

365
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,217
No!

366
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:16,595
You can't negotiate turns,
you can't signal properly...

367
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:20,349
you can't maintain speed,
you can't parallel park.

368
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:24,478
Hell, you can't drive, honey.
Shit, I can't swim. I know I can't.

369
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:28,398
So you know what I do?
I stay my black ass out the pool!

370
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,901
All right, now, just--

371
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,782
Can you-- Oh! Hello.

372
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:42,538
Memphis! Hey, how are you?

373
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:46,667
Sure, sure. When? Okay.

374
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:49,086
- 323-969-81 1 .
- All right, man. Thanks a lot.

375
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,756
Donny.

376
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:57,010
Just take it around the block
a couple of times. Okay? All right.

377
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:06,478
- l've seen betterdays
- Hello. I'm calling for Frankie Fish.

378
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:09,565
Frank's dead, man.
Yeah, h-he got scragged.

379
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:13,819
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, yeah, I'm looking
for Henry Santoro.

380
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:17,865
- He went down to Florida with that
asshole Frankie Fish. You see him,
you tell him I want my money.

381
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:21,118
- I didn't mess with your money.
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm looking for Dan and Mikey.

382
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,829
Both of'em up to Chino.
Doin' a nickel apiece.

383
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,914
Now I'm not so sure I want
to tell you who this is.

384
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:30,252
- Yeah, try it, asshole.
- You sound, uh, very busy right now.

385
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,379
You sound very, very busy.

386
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,053
- There's only two names left.
- Yeah? Let's see which ones you got.

387
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,223
Sphinx-- Those two? No way.

388
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,351
- There's no one else.
- Are you sure?

389
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,064
- ..going in there.
- You tell him.
- Listen, why should I--

390
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,734
- Come on!
- You were the one
who answered the phone, right?

391
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,862
Fine. But how's a guy who can't speak
gonna take a phone call?

392
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,364
You've got a call!

393
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:18,175
Sphinx, is thatyou?

394
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,552
Press a button if it's you.

395
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,854
Sway, you set up this brakejob?

396
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:35,108
Yeah. He warped all four rotors.
He must've been riding those brakes
like an old lady.

397
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:38,987
- That's nice.
- Sounds like the left bank's
running lean.

398
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,085
The service department's over there.

399
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:56,839
- Can I talk to you?
- Talk to me? Yeah, sure, talk.

400
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:00,592
- Well, thing of it is,
I came back because--
- Do you know what time it is?

401
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:04,429
It's 5:30.
I came back because--

402
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:07,891
- I gotta go. I'm late for work.
- Here, let me--

403
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:15,941
- You're at work.
- I got twojobs.

404
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:21,029
I have discovered that you have to work
twice as hard when it's honest.

405
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,705
- Hey, Sway, can I get another shot?
- Yeah.

406
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:32,332
You're still looking amazing.

407
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,918
While you look like a bible salesman.

408
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:37,421
You're healed.

409
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:41,133
- Can we improvise a little bit?
- Sure. What do you have in mind?

410
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,635
Do you wanna get a little crazy?
There's a Cutlass 442 in the back.

411
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:47,472
We can strip down and shine the hood.
What do you say?

412
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:49,641
Uh, that's not what I had in mind.

413
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,727
No?

414
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:54,396
It's about my brother.

415
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:55,939
- Kip's in trouble.
- In trouble?

416
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:58,901
- He took a boost, and he blew it.
- Shit.

417
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:04,364
- And you got some Italians?
- Five or six.

418
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:09,328
- Right.
- It's 50 ladies in 24 hours, $200,000.

419
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:12,497
Well, I've cleaned up.

420
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:19,004
I understand. I hate to
even come here and askyou--

421
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,006
-Sway, can I get that drink now, please?
-Yes.

422
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:25,260
And I had to ask a few of the others
too, and I feel bad about it, but--

423
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:28,347
- But you had no choice.
You had to come here. Yeah.
- Pretty much.

424
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:31,517
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

425
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:37,231
I'd love to help Kip,
but I-I'm not into the life any more.

426
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:43,654
- Well, that's a good thing.
- Yeah.

427
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,866
- I'm glad to see you're doing well.
- Sorry I can't help you.

428
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:52,204
- I'd like to pay for your drink.
- That's fi ne.

429
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,667
How about that drink?

430
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,503
Yeah, how about that drink?

431
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:04,842
- Raines. Memphis Raines, huh?
- Do I know you?

432
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:10,180
Well, you should know me, considering
all the business you done screwed up
for me in the past, baby.

433
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:13,350
-Johnny B.
- That's me.

434
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:18,105
- What can I do foryou?
- Well, I'm gonna tell you
what you can do for me, baby.

435
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:20,440
Get out of Long Beach tonight.

436
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:23,652
I'll be gone in three days.
I'm just here on some family business.

437
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:28,323
Word on the street says Raymond Calitri
hired you and your brother
for a top order...

438
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,409
a order shoulda went to me.

439
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:32,828
That's not the way it went down,Johnny.

440
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:49,636
Hey! Get away from my car, asshole!

441
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:06,570
You got somethin' to say
before I kill you, fool?

442
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,301
Sphinx.

443
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,803
Otto send you?

444
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:42,356
l'm gonna call the doctor

445
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:45,025
l'm gonnaget better

446
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:48,403
- l'm gonna run for the priest
- Oh, Dad.

447
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:53,659
We'd probably both be working
at the dealership if he hadn't died...

448
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,828
just like normal people.

449
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:59,331
Shit.

450
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:10,217
- What's the matter with you?
- Man, six years does a lot of
different things to people.

451
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:16,056
You know, I-- I don't know where you
went, but, you know, you're in there,
you're talkin' about bein' normal.

452
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:20,435
I mean, y-you were always the one who
was goin' after the easy money. Shit.

453
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:26,775
I didn't do it for the money.

454
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:32,114
I did it for the cars.

455
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:36,618
Gleaming in marina blue...

456
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:39,371
sun fire yellow...

457
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:41,832
Marlboro red...

458
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:45,419
begging to be plucked.

459
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:49,256
And I'd do it.

460
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:51,800
I'd boost her...

461
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,845
and just blast to Palm Springs...

462
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:59,266
instantly feeling better about being me.

463
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:04,354
And then, the next day, it seems like,
I'm getting shot at...

464
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:08,609
my friends are dying,
people are going tojail.

465
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:11,111
I didn't like what I'd become.

466
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,784
Yeah, and then you left...

467
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:21,455
and then I didn't have
a brother any more.

468
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,416
And now you wanna give me advice...

469
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,502
and I don't even know you.

470
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:30,172
And, you know, I got my own family now.
I got my own friends.

471
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,467
And, you know, you can say what you want
about them, but they're loyal.

472
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:39,515
Well, when you hit the wall,
the same thing is gonna happen.

473
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:43,644
You and your family...

474
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,480
are either gonna get shot...

475
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:49,983
or get a five-yearjolt at Corcoran.

476
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:02,871
Those Mercedes we impounded,
need those newfa ngled laser-cut keys?

477
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,707
Each one's from Dressner Foreign Motors,
downtown Newport...

478
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:08,293
where all the employees are clean
except for him.

479
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,298
James Lakewood. Served a nickel
at Folsom for auto insurance fraud.

480
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:17,678
Well, gosh, I bet hejust neglected
to mention that to the people
at Dressner Foreign Motors, huh?

481
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:23,392
It gets better. YoungJames there
places orders for lost keys
to the Mercedes home offi ce in Germany.

482
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,068
- The list.
- Ah, the list.

483
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:37,114
Well, I guess we gotta start
beatin' the bushes and try to
find out where they l-- Whoa.

484
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:41,034
- 1 967 Shelby GT 500.
- I know. I know.
- You got Eleanor here?

485
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:44,830
Otto, there's somebody here to see you.

486
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:48,166
Oh! The puppy's a big dog now.

487
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,670
- How you doin'?
- Hey there, Kipper. What is this up--
What's that up under there?

488
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:57,009
Hey. Hey, Otto. How you doin'?
It's a long time. Good to see you.

489
00:36:57,176 --> 00:37:01,221
- Uh, what are you doin' here, Kip?
- Well, actually, we-- We actually
came to talk about some things.

490
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,890
- About what?
- Well, you know.

491
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:07,853
It seems like you guys need
a little help, and we thought
that we should participate.

492
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,897
But I just promised Mom
I was getting you out of this.

493
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:12,191
Listen-- Loo-- No, we're talking
about a lot of money here.

494
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:15,110
- A-And ifyou guys think you're
gonna be gettin' into our Kool-Aid...
- Money?

495
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:16,445
- you gotta be out of your minds.
- Is that why you think I'm doing this?

496
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:20,199
- You inconsiderate little punk!
- Can you explain to me how think three
washed-up car thieves...

497
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,450
- well, then you call Mom
and you explain to her...
- and an old man...

498
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:24,286
- how you wanna--
- are gonna steal 50 cars in two days?

499
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,788
Hey. Hey. Hey.

500
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:31,168
This is why I do not do business
with family.

501
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:33,670
I thinkyou should consider this.

502
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:37,216
Oh, come on, Otto, please. No, his
criminal career has come to an end.

503
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:39,885
Well, his life will come to an end
unless we pull this off.

504
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:43,722
And how can we do it without him?
It can't be done, and you know it.

505
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,938
- You guys have any skills at all?
- Please.

506
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:55,234
Yeah, we have skills. We, um-- Mirror
Man here, he's an electronics expert.

507
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,321
You know, h-he's got some gadgets
that-- that you old fa rts
probably never heard of.

508
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:03,116
You know, uh, Tumbler over here,
he can pretty much drive
anything with wheels...

509
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:05,410
and, you know,
some things without wheels.

510
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:08,539
And, uh, and Toby,
he's a computer genius.

511
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:11,917
He's-- He's-- He does
fa scinating things with computers.

512
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:14,837
Wh-What exactly can you do
with a computer, Toby?

513
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:18,423
I can hack into the DMV mainframe,
I can change VIN numbers...

514
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,717
I can change addresses, registrations.

515
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,178
I can do a lot
of really tricky stuff, okay?

516
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:26,431
All right, all right,
we do this, we do it my way.

517
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:28,684
I run the show.
You take your orders from me.

518
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:32,062
- Ifyou have any problems with that,
you can leave now.
- N-No, that's fi ne.

519
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:34,898
- Yeah, well, w-who is--
- That's fi ne.
- Who is Gilligan here,

520
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:39,111
Uh, Gilligan is actually Freb. Freb
can order pizzas like nobody's business.

521
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,738
- What?
- It's true.

522
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,615
Hey, people gotta eat right?

523
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:48,996
This is outrageous.
I want my lawyer.

524
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:52,291
I'm not saying a word
till I get a lawyer.

525
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:55,836
- All right,James, that's an option.
- And, frankly, a reasonable one.

526
00:38:57,379 --> 00:39:02,092
So you call your lawyer,James.
You tell him you've been arrested
on suspicion of grand theft auto.

527
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:04,219
- We indict you.
- He'll bail you out.

528
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,555
- And we move on to trial.
- Okay, okay.

529
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:13,061
Kid came to me,
said he'd pay $500 a key.

530
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:17,816
So I put the order forms through, and
he picked 'em up a couple days later.

531
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:22,362
- What's the kid's name?
- We kept it anonymous.

532
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:26,241
He was a well-built kid.
Uh, uh, looks like a boxer.

533
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:31,205
- What do you want me to do?
- When he comes back, you call us.

534
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,000
- What says he comes back?
- A hunch.

535
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,378
To make the Friday 8:00 a.m. deadline
you're gonna have to go old school.

536
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:43,050
A one-night boost.
Put all your nuts in one basket. Okay?

537
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,761
- ''One night''?
- Yes.
- What, are you crazy? ''One night.''

538
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:48,305
- What, do you have, like,
a better plan or something?
- Yeah. You spread it out.

539
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:51,350
- You play shadow games and shit.
- We're on a truncated timetable.

540
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,436
- Otto, I'm sorry. C-Can you just listen
to me for one second? All right?
- We've heard you, Kip. Shadow games.

541
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,774
But what you have to understand is
that ifyou play shadow games...

542
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,568
by the second night
the heat is onto you.

543
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:09,034
With a one-night boost, by the time the
first car is reported stolen, your ship
sets sail; it's a surprise attack.

544
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:13,080
This is a complicated list, fe llas.
It really is. Okay?

545
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:17,292
There are 25 that aren't a problem,
but these exotics are tough to find.

546
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:20,838
And the new Mercedes,
they require laser-cut keys. Okay?

547
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:24,299
- Uh, yeah, I got that covered.
- You have that covered?

548
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,635
- What'd I just say?
Yeah, I got it covered.
- Yeah. Yeah.

549
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:29,304
All right, all right.
Well, then, let's get to work.

550
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:33,517
Toby, hack into the insurance database
and find as many cars as you can.

551
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:37,729
Yes! I got addresses
on Hillary, Natalie and Tracy.

552
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:41,233
Donny, check the DMV
for the remaining cars on the list.

553
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,694
I'm sorry, miss, but you've missed
five questions. That's failing.

554
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,655
- Oh, no!
- Next.

555
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:49,157
No! Why?

556
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:52,828
- You're supposed to go fa ster
when somebody tailgates you!
- Ah. Hello again.

557
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:57,249
Mm-hmm. Here's your list
of the 20 car owners' names
and addresses that you requested.

558
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,543
- Thankyou.
- That's $1 00, please.

559
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,297
- A hundred dollars?
- Five dollars a car, 20 cars.

560
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:08,093
- Would you like a calculator?
- It used to be two dollars a car.
Thanks a lot.

561
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,222
- That's all redesigned, right?
- My name is Roger, sir.
May I be of some help?

562
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:17,895
That's funny. My name's Roger.
Two Rogers don't make a right.

563
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:20,606
- Roger, I have a problem.
- Yes?

564
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:23,734
I've been in L.A. three months now.
I have money, I have taste.

565
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,946
But I'm not on anybody's ''A'' list,
and Saturday night is the loneliest
night of the week for me.

566
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:30,908
Well, a Ferrari
would certainly change that.

567
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:35,078
Perhaps, mmm. But you know,
this is the one. Yes, yes, yes.

568
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:40,667
I saw three of these parked outside
the local Starbucks this morning,
which tells me only one thing--

569
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:46,048
there's too many self- indulgent wieners
in this city with too much bloody money!

570
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:52,763
Now, if I was driving
a 1 967 275 GTB fo ur-cam--

571
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,141
You would not be
a self- indulgent wiener, sir.

572
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,227
- You would be a connoisseur.
- Precisely.

573
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:00,187
Champagne would fa ll from the heavens.

574
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:04,066
Doors would open.
Velvet ropes would part.

575
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:08,487
I don't have one here.
However, I do have one in the warehouse.

576
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:12,658
Superb.
What else do you have in the warehouse?

577
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:16,620
Mm-hmm. All right. Uh-huh.

578
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:20,249
That was Mr Lakewood
from the dealership.

579
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:24,795
He says that boxer-lookin' punk
is gonna pick up the keys
to three new Mercedes today.

580
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,673
Same make and model as the ones
we already got impounded.

581
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,258
Now we talkin'.

582
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:37,391
The El Spirito de Graciela
sails Friday...

583
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:39,351
8:00 a.m. sharp.

584
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:42,938
We'll target all the cars
within 45 minutes of here.

585
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,983
By the time their alarm
tracking systems are activated...

586
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:49,111
the cars will already be
in these containers.

587
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:00,497
Fellas, this is Sway.

588
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:03,041
No questions. I'm here for Kip.

589
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,544
- All right.
- All right.

590
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:23,770
- lt 's me. He's-- He's here.
- ln the redChevy Nova ?

591
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,940
- Uh, that's affirmative, sir.
- Pull over.

592
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,443
All right, as soon as he leaves,
you call me with the owners' addresses.

593
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:32,446
-All right?
- I'll get those forms right over, sir.

594
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:37,409
Damn boss.
Always on my case.

595
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:41,163
- I got three here?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thankyou.

596
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:55,302
Huh.

597
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:59,389
Randall Raines,
Donny Astricky, Otto Halliwell.

598
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:02,142
- Should I set up some tails?
- Uh-uh.

599
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:05,062
They're too smart for that.
They'll just dump the cars.

600
00:44:05,229 --> 00:44:08,357
No, we'll get them
with the Mercedes.

601
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:12,319
Let's set up, uh, three surveillance
teams at those addresses.

602
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:17,950
Now, you go ahead
and you make your move, man...

603
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:20,160
and I will be waiting foryou.

604
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:28,627
- Why do you call 'em girls' names?
- That's a good question.

605
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:31,004
- Why do you call 'em girls' names?
- It's a code.

606
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:35,300
You say Jane, you say Shirley,
Lucy, Edna...

607
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:37,928
and nobody listening on the waves
is the wiser.

608
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,682
Got 'em.

609
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:54,111
All right, we've got the addresses
on all 50 ladies. Let's scout 'em.

610
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:02,661
- There she is.
- Nice.

611
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:05,455
Damn, it's cold up here.
They keep these Ferraris refrigerated?

612
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:08,917
And you know black people
don't like cold weather.
We're a tropical people, man.

613
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:14,423
When this is over, I'm gonna
smoke a joint, watch two hours of Roots,
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

614
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:18,218
Hello, and welcome to TVCar Trivia.

615
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:21,555
First question:
Who was the driver of a '73 Firebird?

616
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,224
- Uh, Otto.
- Uh,Jim Rockford, Rockford Files.

617
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,810
Give me Columbo.

618
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:29,104
- A Peugeot convertible.
- What colour?

619
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:31,481
- Grey.
- How you know that?

620
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:33,483
'Cause llo ve thatshow.

621
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,695
Well, I got three words for all y'all:
get a life.

622
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:38,864
Oh, this is some kiddie shit, Sphinx.

623
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,701
What's on Magnum P.I.'s licence plate?

624
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:46,580
- Robin 1.
- Wait, wasn 't Robin that faggoty guy
who hung with him ?

625
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:49,166
No, that was Higgins.
That was Higgins.

626
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,293
Hey, ten points
for our fearless leader.

627
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,338
Sway, how about giving us the honour
of the Bill Bixby trifecta?

628
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:02,346
He dro ve a Corvette in The Magician,
a Ford pickup truck
in The Incredible Hulk...

629
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:05,682
and in The Courtship of Eddie 's Father
he walked.

630
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:15,442
- Bingo.
- My man.

631
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:18,695
We get tired of lookin '
at each other

632
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:31,124
Al, tell me somethin '.

633
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:33,961
Nothin' doin' here, sir.
Nobody's showing.

634
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,796
Copy.

635
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:37,881
A minivan approaching.

636
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:40,425
It seems a little late
for soccer practise.

637
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:47,474
Heads up. I think we got
some activity right here.

638
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:56,650
Oh, that is--
Looks like it's Kip Raines.
And we got a Randall Raines.

639
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:59,278
Ifthey take this,
we will take them down.

640
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:03,156
He's pulling something out
of his pocket. You see that?

641
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:07,077
It's a camera. Looks like
he'sjust doing some homework.

642
00:47:07,244 --> 00:47:11,832
All right, let's leave him be. I don't
wanna burn this. They will be back.

643
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,461
Huh.

644
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:19,423
You know what? Let's go over
to Otto's in the morning.

645
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:24,052
Kick over some rocks
and see what's underneath there.

646
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:30,350
We saved the best for last:
the '67 Shelby Mustang GT-500.

647
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,895
- The GT-500?
- Yeah, yeah.

648
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,234
There she is.

649
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:43,197
Yep. There's Eleanor.

650
00:47:45,282 --> 00:47:47,326
Eleanor is Memphis' unicorn.

651
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:50,329
- What's a unicorn?
- A fa bled creature?

652
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:52,831
You know, the horse with the horn?
Impossible to capture?

653
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:55,792
It's the one car that, no matter
how many times you try to boost...

654
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:58,795
something always happens.

655
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:06,470
We're gonna get through this this time,
right? It's gonna be smooth.

656
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,764
- What's he doing?
- It's gonna be easy.

657
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:12,309
He's talking to her, man,
trying to get reacquainted.

658
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:16,438
You know, they had a rough history. She
almost got him killed a couple of times.

659
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:19,274
- I don't want any talking back.
- He flipped one on the Harbor Freeway.

660
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:21,527
He went off the Long Beach Pier once.

661
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:25,697
A smooth, easy ride.

662
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:27,616
We'rejust gonna glide.

663
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,372
Big night tomorrow, guys.
Let's go home.

664
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,292
- Did you-- Did you get the picture?
- Yeah.

665
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:41,421
See you tomorrow night, Eleanor,
with your fi ne ass.

666
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,385
Man, we're almost home.
You wanna get something to eat?

667
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:50,764
I'd like to get a chocolate malt.

668
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,735
- Hey! Hey!
- Get out of the car!

669
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:07,656
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

670
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:15,080
- Why are people shooting at us?
- 'Cause I blew up their car.

671
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:38,312
Over here!

672
00:49:44,526 --> 00:49:46,904
''Beast.''

673
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,864
Okay, okay.

674
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,205
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

675
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:00,918
Hey!

676
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,710
Oh, you-- y-you think it's a game?

677
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:47,631
Johnny B.
The cops, man.

678
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:51,885
I ain't got nothin' but time, baby.

679
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:03,856
Oh, man,
we're gonna be here all night, man.

680
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:08,986
Look! Cop car! Uh-huh!

681
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:13,365
Long as I'm in here, you'rejust gonna
sit out there. Aren't ya? All right?

682
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:19,913
Hey, listen, this is the plan.
This is what we're gonna do.

683
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,749
There's a big rig over there--

684
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:28,672
Uh, mister, is that your truck
out there, the Big Rig Wrecker?

685
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:30,632
- The Big Rig Wrecker's mine, but--
- That's cool.

686
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:47,608
What do I gotta do? How do I learn?
What do I do? Where do I go?

687
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:50,986
- Well, you gotta go
to truck driving school.
- Truck dri-- I know, man, I know.

688
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:53,572
But I mean, like, um--

689
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:57,326
You boys ready to play
a little Pin the Tail on the Donkey?

690
00:51:57,492 --> 00:52:00,370
- Can I get you
a jelly doughnut or something, man?
- No, I'm just gonna go ahead and go.

691
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:04,124
- 'Cause I'm gonna have the waffl e and--
- I'm gonna-- Maybe next time, though.

692
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,271
I'm gonna smoke you!

693
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:42,079
- Hey! Damn!
- What the hell's going on?

694
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:49,211
- Want some of this?
- Yeah.

695
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:54,925
-You guys got permits for these weapons?
-Oh, man.

696
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,113
So you think I can
only get pizzas, huh?

697
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,992
- Boosted it myself.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. How'd you get it?

698
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:23,704
- Actually, the keys were in it.
- Oh, yeah, well, that kind of
defies the point then, don't it?

699
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:29,293
You stole a car that wasn't on the list.
You stole a car that wasn't on the list!

700
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:32,129
Why didn't you just go to the police
station in-- in a red clown suit...

701
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:34,214
and let everybody know
what we're doin' here?

702
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:37,342
- What have we got?
- I don't know.

703
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,888
- Shit! Fellas.
- What?

704
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:42,723
- Give me that.
- Check this out.
- Let me see that.

705
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:43,849
- Check this out.
- Let me see that.

706
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:46,685
- What?
- Look.
- This looks like heroin.

707
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:47,895
- Yeah.
- What?
- Exactly.

708
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:53,817
- Where did you get this car?
- In front of some poker parlour
in Chinatown.

709
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:57,279
You ever consider why a car
in a neighbourhood like that
would have its keys left in it?

710
00:53:57,446 --> 00:54:00,866
- No.
- Maybe because nobody in that
neighbourhood would be stupid enough

711
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:03,285
- All right.
Get this shit out of here. Take it back.
- No, no, no, we can't take it back.

712
00:54:03,452 --> 00:54:05,370
- Get it out of here!
- Will everybody relax for a second?

713
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:08,832
- Shut up.
- No, no, no! Take it back!
- Take it back!

714
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:15,005
- I want that shit.
Give me that. Give me that.
- Now! Out!

715
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:18,592
- Look what you--
- Man, I will knock the shit out ofyou.

716
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:21,845
- Shut up.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

717
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:24,765
- Who is it?
- Detective Castlebeck.

718
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:26,642
Oh. Christ.

719
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:42,366
Goddamn it.

720
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:47,120
- Hey, hello, Otto.
- Detective. Good to see ya.

721
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:49,873
- Long time.
- Yeah. You're looking good.

722
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,835
Thankyou.

723
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:57,297
So, Randall, what do we got here?
We got a multigenerational
gathering of players?

724
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:58,966
- Is that what we got here?
- Yeah, right.

725
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:03,345
Here's Donny. How you been, D?

726
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:05,889
- I'm just happy to see you, brother.
- Yeah.

727
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:10,269
I got to tell you, Randall,
seeing you here, Otto, Donny...

728
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:12,604
makes me feel almost nostalgic.

729
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:15,107
Kind of like a big reunion.

730
00:55:15,274 --> 00:55:17,192
You should stick around,
'cause a little later we're gonna...

731
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,571
make s'mores and sing ''Kumbayah.''

732
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:25,325
- Yeah. What is this?
- What's it--
- This.

733
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:29,121
They call this a Cadillac. Yeah.

734
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:32,124
- What's wrong with it, Otto?
- Needs restoration.

735
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:35,043
- What?
- Brightening.

736
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:39,214
- Otto. You got a '39 Ford right there.
- Well, that's a pretty car, isn't it?

737
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:42,968
- Yeah.
- Isn't that a nice car?
- And right here you got

738
00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:47,431
Now, these are beautiful cars, Otto.
And here we got a '83 Cadillac Eldorado?

739
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:50,058
- Yeah.
- I mean, who the hell pays...

740
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:53,395
to brighten up a Cadillac Eldorado?

741
00:55:53,562 --> 00:55:56,857
I-I think it holds a certain,
uh, sentimental value, you know?

742
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:59,526
N-Nothing more.

743
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:03,197
Run me down a tag.

744
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:09,286
C licence 3-2-9-H-R-O.

745
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:15,000
That is, uh, Harold, Randall, Otto,
burgundy Cadillac.

746
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,841
No fa ith in our newfo und
goodness, Detective, huh?

747
00:56:23,008 --> 00:56:26,345
Task force runs on statistics
and numbers, Otto. You know that.

748
00:56:26,512 --> 00:56:32,059
- Randall, this Kip?
- That's my brother. He's all grown up.

749
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:36,522
One-Baker-eleven, Pacific Division,
three-two-niner, Harold, Randall, Otto.

750
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:41,109
No wants, no warrants at this time.
DMVnot on file.

751
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:44,154
- Copy that. Thankyou.
- See, I know what you're doin'.

752
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:47,324
I know. You--
You're thinking there's no want...

753
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:51,537
but that, uh, I stripped its guts
and crated her up, right?

754
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:54,206
- Is that what you did, Randall?
- No, I didn't do it.

755
00:56:54,373 --> 00:56:56,458
You know, forget it.
You're trying to hurt my feelings? Fine!

756
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,502
You know what? Go ahead.
Do it. Let her rip.

757
00:56:58,669 --> 00:57:01,630
- Go ahead. Rev it up.
- All right, goddamn it. I will.

758
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:03,757
Sell it to you cheap.

759
00:57:03,924 --> 00:57:06,844
Yeah, '83, first year they put
the auto-ride control on these boys.

760
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:10,973
Oh, I don't know. You probably know more
about cars at this point than I do.

761
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:14,768
- What? You slippin' on me, Randall?
- No, it'sjust your knowledge
overwhelms me.

762
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:18,063
- It's got a real nice-sounding engine,
right, Otto?
- 4.1 litre.

763
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,982
- Digital fuel injection?
- You got it.

764
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:21,859
- All right. Let's see what she got.
- You the man.

765
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:30,075
Give it some more. Give it some more.

766
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:32,411
- Yeah, that's it!
- Go! Go!

767
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:34,496
- Let's go!
- Come on.

768
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:37,124
Baby, don't be so mean!

769
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:40,419
- Yeah, that's it!
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, yeah, that was good.

770
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:44,423
Yeah, you break it,
you buy it, my friend.

771
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:47,551
Yeah, she got some power goin' on.

772
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:51,430
All right.

773
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:56,643
I'll catch you later then.

774
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:17,039
- It's on for tonight.
- How do you know?

775
00:58:17,206 --> 00:58:20,501
They got the call signs
on all the units working tonight.

776
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:24,421
What-- What were you
gonna do with this?

777
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:27,799
- I was gonna bonk him.
- What? Bonk?

778
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:32,095
For the next 24 hours,
all your decision-making privileges
have been removed!

779
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,640
- You got it?
- Got it.
- Yeah, that's cool, man.

780
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:38,227
Obviously they're onto us.
He's sniffi n' real close.

781
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:42,731
If anything tonight appears
out of place, I want you to cut bait,
get out of there and walk away.

782
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:45,108
And get rid of this goddam car!

783
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:50,697
- What's up, Kip?
- Toby, what are you doin'?

784
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:52,783
You think you're comin' with us,
but you're not.

785
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:55,077
- What are you talkin' about, man?
I'm part of the team. I get to go.
- No.

786
00:58:55,244 --> 00:59:00,165
No, no, wake up. You're gonna end up
in jail or in the morgue or some shit.
Don't be stupid.

787
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:02,292
What am I supposed to do?

788
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:04,586
Did you see a box
of rubber gloves here, man?

789
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:09,550
Gloves? Man, you don't need gloves.
This is the new age. Check this out.

790
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:14,221
- What is this?
- Let mejust see that big claw
you call a hand.

791
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:16,765
That's not doughnut jelly,
so don't eat it.

792
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:19,768
Your new fingerprints.
Elvis is back.

793
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:26,233
- Boy got skills, right?
- Yeah, you do.

794
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,360
Look like a little ghetto Smurf.

795
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:51,175
I am a bad man.

796
00:59:58,891 --> 01:00:02,019
Thanks. Thanks for doin' this.

797
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:07,816
Keep it real. Think slow.

798
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:09,860
We should get through it just fi ne.

799
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:16,450
''Low Rider,'' Donny.
Donny? ''Low Rider.''

800
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:32,674
All my friends know the lo wrider

801
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:37,763
Yeah, the lo wrider

802
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:42,142
Yeah

803
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:46,647
Okay, let's ride.

804
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:02,538
Oh! Shit.

805
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,544
Give me the damn torch.

806
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:12,756
What? I tell you, I'm the man.

807
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:18,470
Now, where does this go?
Find a way to get in here. Get this--

808
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:21,849
I tell you, I'm running this shit!
You do that again, I will kick--

809
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:24,351
Cool, man. You don't have
to take it so damn personal.

810
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,939
Ah! Everything is perfect.

811
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:46,665
Hello, ladies.
Always was a sucker for a redhead.

812
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:50,794
Let's go. Come on.
Move. Move. Go, go!

813
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:56,550
Workyour magic, baby. I know you know
Ferraris. Work your magic.

814
01:01:56,717 --> 01:01:58,760
Girl got skills.

815
01:02:24,161 --> 01:02:26,496
You all right?

816
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:32,377
- You think we're gonna make it?
- I don't know. It's too early to tell.

817
01:02:57,277 --> 01:03:00,489
Diana, Tricia, Nadine and Rose
are on their way.

818
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:02,741
Good goin', guys.

819
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:29,434
- Al, tell me something.
- Unit Two. Sorry, sir, nothin' yet.

820
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:35,023
Son of a bitch. I know you're not
parking right in front of me.

821
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:38,068
Oh, no, I can't see a damn thing.

822
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:40,404
All right, we gotta move.
