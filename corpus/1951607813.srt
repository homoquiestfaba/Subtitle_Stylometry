1
00:01:03,626 --> 00:01:08,032
Whiperwill flies about.... 27 miles an hour.

2
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:15,836
That what you thought it woulda been?   -Sure.

3
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:27,631
I'd a thought more like... 31 or something.
-Hm

4
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:32,547
32

5
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,333
God damn that's a pisser

6
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,696
Normally I could look at anything.

7
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:48,733
Tell you exactly how fast
it's goin' within 2 miles per hour... -It's fascinating.

8
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:53,599
I'm gonna...

9
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:01,241
Get the fuck outta
the way cocksucker!

10
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:06,851
Mornin' mayor

11
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,661
Hi, how're ya'll doing?

12
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:17,767
Easy come, easy go

13
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:26,228
When Darwin said fittest...

14
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,419
He didn't necessarily mean the strongest

15
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,276
Or the most intelligence or any one trait

16
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,449
He merely meant those oraganism most
well suited to their environments

17
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:38,833
Now, we humans

18
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,449
We think we're more fit

19
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:43,293
More evolved because

20
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:45,454
We're smarter, We're neophytes

21
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:49,211
We've only been on this earth 2 million years, give or take

22
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:53,703
The cockroach, that fella's been around
350 million years

23
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,394
So based on that which of us is
the more successful species

24
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:03,417
Lots of folks build houses on unsafe ground

25
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:07,849
The erosion of Cambodia is some of the worst,
my friends wanted to buy a house there but...

26
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:09,032
Hey, c'mon

27
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:10,004
Hey Grant

28
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:11,822
Later Hank

29
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,579
He's teaching evironmental studies,
he's gonna borrow one of my lesson plans

30
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:18,527
Oh, I know what he want's to borrow

31
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:19,940
And I ain't lendin'

32
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,313
Come on you little varmits

33
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:23,760
That's it

34
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:28,838
See you guys later
- That's it

35
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,393
That's one match I'll never get

36
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:42,390
Ain't no mystery...
Starla's raisin' them shanties off St. Luke dirt poor

37
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,285
All she ever wanted was to be a lady

38
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:47,199
Ol' Grant Grant, he's always been made of green

39
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:49,292
Gold digger, huh?
- Oh hell Margeret

40
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:52,566
Starla's mother left her, her daddy's a drunk,
she's 17 years old

41
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:55,529
Old Grant pulls up, big old cadillac, house on a hill

42
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:57,369
And college tuition, what would you do?

43
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,051
- Hell, if he'd had a gina you'd a married him too
- What's a "gina"?

44
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:03,949
It's a country

45
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:06,290
You know where "Ginese" people come from

46
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:09,842
Learn to easedrop better
Zack, Hell! Your mother's waitin' over there

Oh yeah

51
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,992
You know what baby?

52
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:49,203
I'm just not really in the mood

53
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:52,925
Come on babydoll, it's been long time we both need it

54

Oh honey l'm just not in

00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:40,625
Where you going?

64
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:46,932

65
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:50,373

66
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:19,934
Uh, yeah, hit me again there killer

67
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,398
Meagen Montgomery's little sister

68
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,194
You kidding me
- Nope!

69
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:47,760
Brenda

70
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:52,907

00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,617

112
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:35,839
I do want to be a good wife

113
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:46,308
You're crying

114
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,322
Baby, what's this?

115
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,978
Just a little bug bite

00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:42,659
What are you so smiley about?

117
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:44,640
Nothing

118
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,748
Grant and I had a good morning
and it's been a while.

119
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:51,857
You slut!

120
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,695
You're a married woman

121
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:01,460
It just Grant, I dunno, it's like.

122
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:05,988
It was like he was discovering all these
different parts of my body, you know like...

123
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:08,188
like little boy or something.

124
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:11,320
l'm telling you this morning I sensed a real change in Grant

125
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:21,445
Meat meat meat

126
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:22,599

137
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:02,246
What's this lock doing on the door?

Baby, you drilled right into the frame,
it's all busted up

139
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:15,798
Sugerplum, you really think you sould be asking so
many questions when it's so close to your birthday

140
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,130
My birthday is not for 2 months

141
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,094
That's close

142
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:20,230

Yeah, think Jack'll make a speech or something...

179
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,130
That'll be interesting

180
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:23,966
Thank you!

181
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,784
l would like to introduce Mayor Jack McCreedy

182
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:41,975
Thank you!

183
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,651
Cheese and crackers
- Ladies and gentleman

184
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:52,416
Right after God invented this world of ours

185
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,842
He came unto Adam

186
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,022
and He said that man sould have dominion

187
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:00,728
over the fish in the sea

188
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,136
and over the birds in the air

189
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:10,064
And over every living thing that
moveth upon the Earth

190
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:13,238
Now, I believe...

191
00:22:14,387 --> 00:22:15,747
when God say that!

192
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:22,708
He was thinking of deer season and Wheelsy
how much damn fun it is to shoot a buck or two

193
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,126
Are you ready?

00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:36,376

207
00:24:45,606 --> 00:24:47,629
Grant why didn't you answer your phone?

208
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,375

We gotta get you to the hospital
- No, no no

214

215
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:28,731
"it should clear up soon"

216
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:32,603
He said "things like this happen...

217
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,310
happens to people all the time"

218
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,459
Come one baby, don't...

219
00:25:41,294 --> 00:25:42,943

220
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,471

00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:06,411

00:26:54,584 --> 00:26:55,991

00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,537
Hey Starla
- Hey!

238
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:43,302

00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:46,942

- Oh no, he's not home from work yet

240
00:27:47,285 --> 00:27:49,735
Mr. Grant!
- He's not home yet Wally, I just said

241
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:53,131
What's going on?

242
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,042
Do you know Brenda Gutierrez

243
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,257
Maybe she called the house...
- No

244
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:05,024
Girl disappeared Friday night

245
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:07,273
Signs of struggle in the house

246
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:08,948
Here in town

247
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,205

249
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,525
And that's the last thing they seen of her

250
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:17,662
It must have been someone that looks like Grant

251
00:28:19,585 --> 00:28:20,996
Yeah, maybe

252
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:26,025

280
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:43,533
nobody wants to go huntin in a town with

281
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:44,829

288
00:32:57,547 --> 00:32:59,933

295
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,363

296
00:33:20,788 --> 00:33:21,879

How can one man do that?

311
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,525
Slay all them dogs by himself?

312
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:02,126
Well, he's gotta be in the forest

313
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:05,683
all 3 ranches run along side it
-I think we should get up a posse

314
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:07,662
And head in there

315
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,405
lt's hundred thousand acres,
be like finding a needle in a fuckstack

316
00:34:13,242 --> 00:34:14,073
Gather some folks together

317
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:16,133

dr doolittle's gonna strike next

318
00:34:18,211 --> 00:34:20,213
right after grant ran off
a cat went missing from here

319
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:21,674
Ranglin's ranch!

320
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:24,231
Two nights ago a mare was stolen

321
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,916
from this property owned by Fitzgibbon
that rancher with the cleft pallet

322
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:29,232
l know that guy, he looks like a chipmunk

323
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:30,913
your momma weren't too proud

00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,251

326
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,216
and if he keeps that pattern

327
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:39,169
Owned by a family called the Stripmeyers

328
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:42,552
