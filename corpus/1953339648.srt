U.S. Embassy, Iran - November 4, 1979

3
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,034
Leave the building, go now.

4
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,286
Iranians go first.

5
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,080
Now, hurry!

U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

13
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,908
Some Americans are missing.

14
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,244
Look at the repaired list
of embassy employees.

15
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,330
The numbers don't match.

16
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,417
Finish assembling the pictures
from the embassy.

17
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,128
All I need is their faces
and I will find them.

18
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,046
Yes, sir, it will be done.

19
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,312
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19, 1980

20
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,785
Sahar, how are you doing?

21
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,245
Fine, thank you.

22
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,707
Your friends from Canada, ma'am.

23
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,544
All this time. They never go out.

IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY

28
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:04,236
Peace be upon you.

29
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:05,779
And upon you, sir. Welcome.

30
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:07,197
I hope you are well.

31
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,032
Thank you very much. How are you?

32
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,618
I'm very well. What's your name?

33
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,285
You know, sister...

34
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:57,455
...those who are with him, Rasool of Allah,
we are tender among ourselves.

35
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,165
But stern against the Kufar.

36
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,209
As God wills it.

37
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:06,047
But those who sit silently have sinned.

38
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,509
How else may I help, sir?

39
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,012
No, no, just one thing.

40
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,515
How long have they been here?

41
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,809
Pardon?

42
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:22,230
The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?

43
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,693
They arrived two days ago.

44
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:32,198
Forgive my intrusion, one must be vigilant.

45
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,369
Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran.

46
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:37,801
Yes, it's a fantasy story about a war
in another world.

47
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,678
Here you can see our notices.

48
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,851
Of course I speak Farsi.

49
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:48,228
I wish to make a film in Iran.

50
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:15,172
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.

51
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,008
Alien villains have taken over
the hero's planet.

52
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:21,345
They fight for their families and
take back the city.

53
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:27,851
The villains know he is the chosen one,
so they kidnap his son in the spice market.

54
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:32,022
So he and his wife storm the castle.

55
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:36,381
The people... hold that... the
people are inspired to join him.

56
01:33:36,382 --> 01:33:39,196
They are farmers, but
they learn to fight.

57
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:44,743
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

58
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:52,209
And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.

59
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:06,489
You are admitted to the Republic of Iraq.

60
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:29,762
The Iran Hostage Crisis ended
on January 20, 1981,

61
01:50:29,763 --> 01:50:33,210
when all remaining hostages were released.

62
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:35,878
They spent 444 days in captivity.

63
01:50:37,422 --> 01:50:39,156
The involvement of the C.I.A.

64
01:50:39,157 --> 01:50:41,031
complemented efforts
of the Canadian embassy

65
01:50:41,032 --> 01:50:42,583
in freeing the six held in Tehran.

66
01:50:42,684 --> 01:50:45,095
To this day, this story
stands as an enduring model

67
01:50:45,096 --> 01:50:47,557
for international cooperation
between governments.

68
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:52,187
All of the Houseguests returned
to the U.S. Foreign Service

69
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:55,398
after their ordeal in Iran.

70
01:50:56,942 --> 01:50:58,983
Oscar-winning makeup artist
John Chambers

71
01:50:58,984 --> 01:51:01,981
was awarded the C.I.A.'s Intelligence
Medal, its highest civilian honor.

72
01:51:02,082 --> 01:51:06,909
He and Mendez remained friends
until Chambers' death in 2001.

73
01:51:08,704 --> 01:51:12,102
Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star
was returned to him in 1997,

74
01:51:12,103 --> 01:51:15,668
when the Argo operation was
declassified by President Clinton.

75
01:51:25,721 --> 01:51:33,686
He lives in rural Maryland with his family.

76
02:00:17,961 --> 02:00:19,962
