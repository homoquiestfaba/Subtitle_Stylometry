- [Andy] <i>I know it.</i>
- Bye.

104
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,300
Shouldn't you be dressed?

105
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,600
What, this is not appropriate
attire for your personal chauffeur?

106
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,800
- You have a client.
- No, I don't.

107
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,958
I mean, yes, I do.
But, you know, we're still good.

108
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,724
- It just means we've got...
- Another tardy.

No, we're good.

110
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:27,791
Okay?

- [man speaking on TV]
- Yeah. No, I know.

112
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,358
I... I get it.
I know you don't like living there,

113
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:37,358
but it's an assisted-living community,
Mom, it's not an old folks' home.

Okay, Mom, you need...
I can't hear you.

117
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,884

You need to press the little
microphone button with the...

121
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:57,884
I don't know if you can hear me.
I'm gonna come see you later, okay?

Anybody seen
my candy-cane scissors?

133

Now, why would you
want to cut candy canes?

You know.
My scissors with the...

00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,808
I think so.

138
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:39,558
Gonna be late again.

139
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:40,925
Found 'em.

Under one of your
piles of trash.

Hey, science has proven

that piles are the most
efficient filing system.

143
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,892
I read that somewhere.

Those are actually
my coupons.

- [man] Were you cutting us coupons?
- [woman] Mm-hmm.

146

- I love you.
- Mm.

147
00:10:57,418 --> 00:11:01,450
Rachel, maybe you could learn a thing or
two from Mary about fiscal responsibility.

[clears throat]

149
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:06,733
- Rachel, I... I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

150
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,200
I really love having you
and my brother here.

151
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:13,516
But if you're so
fiscally responsible,

152
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,616
maybe it's time to kick in
some rent here.

153
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,950
Rachel, you're the one that said
that we couldn't stay at Mom's.

154
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:21,516
We need to sell it.
And you know that. Okay?

155
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,349
I can't afford to pay for her
care, and you really can't either.

156
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:28,583
No, no, I told you,
I'm working on the business

157
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:30,450
and it's gonna start soon.

158
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,758
Come on, Freddy,
we gotta be real.

159
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,166
Real about what?

160
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,799
What does that even mean?

161
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:39,166
She was getting lost
in her own neighborhood.

162
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,133
But to be fair,
I still get lost in our old neighborhood.

163
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,318
- Even with a phone?
- Yeah.

164
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,616
Yeah, the streets in Linwood Springs
are like a freakin' maze of spaghetti.

165
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,683
Kyle, grab a granola bar.
We gotta go.

166
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:51,966
I already ate.

167
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:54,267
Bye, guys.
See you after school.

168
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,733
See you, dude.
Blow it up in there.

169
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,299
Bye, buddy.

170
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:02,650
Morning, Rachel.
Hey, Kyle.

171
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:05,583
Morning, Rosie. New ride?

172
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:06,751
Yeah. We've gone minivan.

173
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:08,450
It suits you.

174
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,133
Bye.

175
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,568
[minivan engine starts]

176
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,899
[sighs]

177
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,933
- [engine starts, dashboard beeps]
- [sighs]

178
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,668
[Kyle] Are we ever
gonna get a new ride?

179
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,166
Sure.

180
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:29,183
You wanna buy me one?

181
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,266
"Prospective."

182
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,001
Mom, I'm good.

183
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,233
Remember,
it's not "per-spective."

184
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:42,466
"Prospective."

185
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:48,101
P-R-O-S-P-E-C-T-I-V-E.

186
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,266
- "Prospective."
- Nice job.

187
00:12:56,967 --> 00:13:00,134
Hey, so what do you say?
Should we risk the freeway today?

188
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,068
No. No freeway.

189
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:06,408
Okay, well, just check
the traffic for me, please.

190
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,158
You don't have
a pass code anymore?

191
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,659
Not since I almost crashed
trying to unlock it.

192
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,991
Wow. That's not safe.

193
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:20,151
- "Precarious."
- What?

194
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,749
Next word. "Precarious."

195
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:29,184
"Precarious."
P-R-E-C-A-R-I-O-U-S.

196
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:31,050
- Use it in a sentence.
- Uh...

197
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:36,605
The way the glass is placed on the
edge of the table is precarious.

198
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,901
Nice. Good job.

199
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:41,533
Says it's clear.

200
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,967
And that's a problem why?

201
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:46,332
Because we still
can't trust it.

202
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:48,550
[exhales]

203
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:51,917
- Sorry, kiddo, but today we must.
- Mom, no!

204
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:54,016
- I don't have a choice.
- No! Please?

205
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,016
- We're gonna be late.
- Trust me, Kyle.

206
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:57,550
This is gonna be
quicker, okay?

207
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:00,684
[Kyle] That's what you said
the last two times.

208
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:06,908
Hey, see? All clear.

209
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:11,607
[cell phone ringing]

210
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,075
It's Dad.
Can I please talk to him?

211
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:15,841
[sighs]

212
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,858
- Hey, Dad.
- [Richard] <i>Hey, man.</i>

213
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,591
Uncle Freddy and I invented
a new Fortnite strategy.

214
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:23,724
- You wanna hear it?
- <i>Not a good time.</i>

215
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,558
- <i>Maybe later, okay?</i>
- [Kyle] Okay.

216
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:27,491
You got the tickets
for the game tomorrow?

217
00:14:27,624 --> 00:14:29,324
[scoffs] <i>Yeah, look,
about the game...</i>

218
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:31,324
<i>My schedule
kind of got messed up,</i>

219
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:33,624
<i>and my boss needs me
to go out of town tomorrow.</i>

220
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:36,092
- <i>Next time, okay?</i>
- Yeah, okay.

221
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,533
That's really understanding
of you, Kyle.

222
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,366
You know, new jobs,
like your Dad's, can be...

223
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:47,058
really unpredictable
at first.

224
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:48,693
[Richard]
<i>See. That's right.</i>

225
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:51,559
<i>But I promise we'll make a
plan to go to a game soon...</i>

226
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:54,124
Well, it probably shouldn't be planned.
It should be more a...

227
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:56,358
a spur-of-the-moment
thing, right?

228
00:14:56,866 --> 00:15:01,799
I mean, 'cause plans...
can be hard to stick to.

229
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,633
[Richard]
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</i>

230
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:06,866
<i>I just need to keep my new boss
happy so I can get my own place...</i>

231
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:09,301
Yeah, and maybe stop relying
on other sources of income.

232
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:12,367
[Richard sighs] <i>Look, I just want
everything to be fair and square, okay?</i>

233
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:15,633
<i>That's why I called, actually.
I needed to talk to you about moving...</i>

234
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,999
Richard,
we gotta go, okay?

235
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,350
We're just
getting to school.

236
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:23,184
[Richard] <i>Okay, fine. But, you
know, this isn't gonna solve itself.</i>

237
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:25,816
<i>Look, I'm sorry again, bud.
I'll talk to you soon, okay?</i>

238
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,375
- Okay.
- <i>Okay. All right. Bye.</i>

239
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:30,174
- [line clicks]
- Bye.

240
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,857
Bye.

241
00:15:36,626 --> 00:15:39,358
I am... I'm sorry, Kyle.

242
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,124
[sighs]

243
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,908
Three tardies
is an automatic detention.

244
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:55,774
I'm doing the best
I can here. Okay?

245
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,791
[groans] Seriously?

246
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,399
[horns honking]

247
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,366
I can't believe this.

248
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:14,499
[cell phone ringing]

249
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,584
Deborah's calling you.

250
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:22,484
[ringing continues]

251
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,066
Deborah. Hey, I was
just gonna call you.

252
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:33,367
[Deborah] <i>I just wanted to make
sure I was gonna see you at 9:00.</i>

253
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,600
- Absolutely.
- <i>Oh, great. I have a big day today.</i>

254
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,166
Uh... but I've just hit
hellish traffic,

255
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:43,367
so I'm gonna be 15,
maybe 20 minutes late, tops.

256
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,066
<i>Are you serious?</i>

257
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:48,033
[Rachel]
Actually, you know what?

258
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:51,166
It looks like
it might be clearing, so...

259
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:52,749
We're good.

260
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:54,916
[sighs] <i>I can't
do this again, Rachel.</i>

261
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:58,283
<i>You know what? I'm gonna call
Linda's guy and get in there.</i>

262
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,449
<i>I love you, Rachel,
but ever since you lost your salon...</i>

263
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:04,749
<i>I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but you're fired. Get your shit together.</i>

264
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:08,051
- Deborah, no, wait. I'm sorry, okay?
- [line clicks]

265
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,267
Oh, my God.

266
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:14,966
Are you okay, Mom?

267
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,334
Yeah.

268
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:19,641
Just...

269
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,276
Oh, my God. Just my...

270
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:25,176
My best client,
that's all.

271
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:27,774
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:35,774
[exhales] Eight miles, you know.
That's it.

273
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:41,874
What takes ten minutes on a Sunday,
takes an hour every other day...

274
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,917
and wrecks your career.

275
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:45,734
You know why?

276
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:50,667
Too many cars.

277
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:54,701
Too many cars
and too many people.

278
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,316
Didn't you also oversleep?

279
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:03,426
Yes. Yes.

280
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:07,267
And I overslept.
You're absolutely right.

281
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,066
[chuckles]

282
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:11,774
It's okay.

283
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:17,109
[Rachel] So...

284
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:19,951
any suggestions?

285
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:22,951
You could take the next exit
and do surface streets.

286
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:27,783
You got it.

287
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:30,516
Hold on. I'm gonna
get us out of this.

288
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,250
[horns honking]

289
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:36,850
From now on,
no more freeways, okay?

290
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:41,183
I only trust you,
okay? Deal?

291
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:42,576
Deal.

292
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,308
[horns continue honking]

293
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:06,241
[Rachel sighs]

294
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:34,009
[sighs]

295
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,975
It's not getting
any greener.

296
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:38,225
Come on, man.

297
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:39,692
Come on!

298
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,158
[growls]

299
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,517
[horn blares]

300
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:43,850
Go!

301
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,783
[breathes deeply]

302
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,550
[horn blares]

303
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,049
[groans]

304
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:56,142
[horn blares]

305
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:58,341
[tires squeal]

306
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,741
[sighs] No, no. Go.

307
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:09,457
Oh, come on.

308
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,734
Of course. Yeah.

309
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,758
- Kyle, don't.
- [man] Morning.

310
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:37,891
I don't even get
a courtesy tap first?

311
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:40,292
Roll up your window.

312
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:46,391
It's not working.

313
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:49,458
You know what
a courtesy tap is, young man?

314
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:51,292
Just ignore him.

315
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,341
- Sounds like this.
- [three short honks]

316
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:57,452
It's light. It's friendly.

317
00:20:57,649 --> 00:20:59,983
Just like you're trying
to get somebody's attention.

318
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,258
I'm sure that's what
your mom meant.

319
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:04,524
Is that right, ma'am?

320
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:07,592
- Is a courtesy tap what you meant?
- No, it's not.

321
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:10,725
Why is that?

322
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:13,524
The light was green,
and you weren't moving.

323
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:16,457
Mom. Stop it, please.

324
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:18,858
Some of us
have places to be.

325
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:23,641
Yeah, I admit to being
a little zoned out back there.

326
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,059
I've been kind of having
a hard time lately.

327
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,125
Yeah, well, join the club.

328
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:31,991
[whispering] Stop it.

329
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,591
Well, I'm sorry.

330
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:37,934
I'm sorry that you are,
and I'm sorry that...

331
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,967
I might've made it worse.

332
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:43,909
You accept my apology?

333
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,607
Sure, whatever.

334
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:47,958
Perfect.

335
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,759
If you could just do the same,
we could press reset.

336
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:54,759
Ma'am, I was saying,
if you could just apologize...

337
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:56,391
Yeah, I heard you.

338
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,625
And?

339
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,391
I don't have anything
to apologize for, sir.

340
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:03,991
- Mom. Just apologize.
- It's okay.

341
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,759
Well, I don't think that's really
true of any of us now, is it?

342
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:12,067
But that's where we are
in this world today.

343
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,467
We seem to have developed a
fundamental inability to apologize

344
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,367
to anyone, for anything.

345
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:27,900
I don't even think you really
know what a bad day is.

346
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:33,550
But you're gonna find out.

347
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:36,949
You hear me, miss?

348
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:39,317
You're gonna fucking learn.

349
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,383
Hey, can you go, please?

350
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:48,992
Just go.

351
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,025
Shit.

352
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:19,867
Mom.

353
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:26,466
- [Kyle] Oh, my gosh! Stop!
- [tires squeal]

354
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:33,058
Are you okay?

355
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:34,825
Yeah.

356
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:36,724
What's this guy's problem?

357
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:38,525
- [chuckles]
- [engine revs]

358
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:41,392
- [tires squeal]
- [horn honks]

359
00:23:54,525 --> 00:23:56,758
[horns honking]

360
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:00,232
[Kyle] What's he doing?

361
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,100
[Rachel] Just gonna let
this person go on his way

362
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,367
- and take the back way, okay?
- Okay.

363
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,367
[engine revving]

364
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:10,342
- Come on, come on, come on.
- [Kyle] Is he stopping?

365
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:11,342
Come on.

366
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:14,575
[honking continues]

367
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:16,958
[tires squeal]

368
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,858
Come on.

369
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:29,892
[Rachel exhales]

370
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,433
So that was terrifying.

371
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:39,466
You know, some people are just
jerks, and that's all there is to it.

372
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,767
Everything's gonna be okay.

373
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,583
I got the window up.

374
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:52,583
[Rachel clears throat]

375
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:58,392
Hey. So, what was that
Fortnite strategy

376
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:00,624
you and Uncle Freddy
came up with?

377
00:25:01,624 --> 00:25:03,125
You don't care about that.

378
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:06,091
Of course I do.
I wanna learn.

379
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:08,025
I wanna learn.

380
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:13,258
You play duos and glide down to a
place you're really familiar with,

381
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:14,591
like Retail Row.

382
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:16,425
And then, one of you
distracts an enemy

383
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,425
while the other speeds a golf
cart out from a hiding place

384
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,492
and crashes into them.

385
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,758
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

386
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,200
You're right, I don't,
but it sounds awesome.

387
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,800
Seriously.

388
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:43,150
[school bell rings]

389
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,450
[bell tolling]

390
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,583
[Rachel] So...

391
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,800
how long's detention?

392
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,500
Thirty minutes.

393
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,333
Okay, so, I'll bail you out
3:30 on the nose,

394
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:14,867
and I'll even have a big "make it
up to you" Butterfinger Blizzard

395
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,733
ready and waiting.

396
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,033
I promise.

397
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:21,466
You don't have to promise.

398
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:23,033
Kyle.

399
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,466
Can you please try
to be on time?

400
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:28,200
Yeah, of course.

401
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,333
[sighs]

402
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:53,800
[line ringing]

403
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,849
- <i>Rach?</i>
- My nine o'clock fired...

404
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,749
- [horn blares]
- [tires squeal]

405
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:05,633
...fired me. [sighs]
Hey, you...

406
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,033
you still there?

407
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,866
<i>Uh, yeah. What happened?</i>

408
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:11,666
Oh, God.

409
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:15,474
Freeway was a parking lot,
and my biggest client couldn't wait,

410
00:27:15,608 --> 00:27:17,641
so she told me
to go to hell.

411
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:19,741
- <i>That sucks.</i>
- Yeah.

412
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:23,308
And then some psycho flipped out
on me and Kyle driving to school.

413
00:27:24,283 --> 00:27:26,416
- [Andy] <i>And all this before noon. Shit.</i>
- [chuckles] Yeah.

414
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,450
<i>At least the day
can't get any worse, huh?</i>

415
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:32,116
I could really use some therapy
on top of the legal advice.

416
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,483
Can you do breakfast
instead?

417
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:37,050
<i>Um... at Darrow's?</i>

418
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:40,082
Yes. Pancake therapy,
even better.

419
00:27:40,216 --> 00:27:41,550
Twenty minutes?

420
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:43,950
<i>Mm. "Human" 20 minutes,
or "Rachel" 20 minutes?</i>

421
00:27:44,082 --> 00:27:45,483
Ha, ha.

422
00:27:45,616 --> 00:27:46,818
See you in 20.

423
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:48,483
[phone alert chimes]

424
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:51,466
[chuckles]

425
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,466
[sighs]

426
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:38,534
- [music playing over speakers]
- [cashier] Thank you.

427
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:39,966
[man] Thank you.

428
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:48,233
[beeping]

429
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:54,958
[door alert beeping]

430
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:00,332
[cashier] Thank you.

431
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:03,009
Cash or credit?

432
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,641
That'll be, uh, $5.33.

433
00:29:05,775 --> 00:29:07,241
Okay. Thank you.

434
00:29:07,374 --> 00:29:10,809
Hi. Can I have five Powerball
Quick Picks? Thanks.

435
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:12,541
And those.

436
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:16,416
That'll be $13.31.

437
00:29:19,982 --> 00:29:21,316
A 20...

438
00:29:21,784 --> 00:29:23,082
your tickets...

439
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:26,116
- Here's your change.
- Thanks.

440
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:30,966
Okay. Thank you.

441
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,732
What can I get you, sir?

442
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:38,366
- [man] Just a pack of Ventti gold.
- That'll be all?

443
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:41,233
- That's it.
- All right. Cash or credit?

444
00:29:42,732 --> 00:29:44,066
Okay.

445
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:52,707
Hi.

446
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,825
Uh, ma'am, are you okay?

447
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:58,491
Yeah. Uh...

448
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:03,126
Actually, no. I...

449
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:06,357
I'm pretty sure the guy
in that truck's following me.

450
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:08,026
[cashier]
He somebody you know?

451
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,159
No, we... we kind of exchanged
words at an intersection.

452
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:14,193
I honked my horn at him,
and now he's...

453
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:15,891
He's road-raging you.

454
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:18,059
You could say that.

455
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:19,958
- You want me to call the cops?
- Nah, that'll take all day.

456
00:30:20,092 --> 00:30:21,992
Besides, that'll just
piss him off even more.

457
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:23,391
[cashier]
Might. Might not.

458
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:25,457
Look, I can call 'em.

459
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,391
I don't know. I'm probably
just being paranoid.

460
00:30:27,524 --> 00:30:28,691
How 'bout I walk out
with you?

461
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:32,226
- You don't have to do that.
- I'm heading out there anyway.

462
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:35,958
- So, you think he's...
- He's just trying to scare you.

463
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:38,324
If he sees both of us together,
and he doesn't drive off,

464
00:30:38,457 --> 00:30:39,791
you still
get in your car.

465
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:41,424
I make sure
I get his plates.

466
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:44,491
If he follows you out,
we'll all call the cops.

467
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:48,608
Okay. Thanks.
I appreciate it.

468
00:31:09,675 --> 00:31:13,074
Why don't you just get in the car?
I'm gonna grab his plates.

469
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:28,283
711 TPX.

470
00:31:28,924 --> 00:31:30,792
711 TPX.

471
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:32,325
Thanks.

472
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:37,443
[man] Hey.

473
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:40,774
Why don't you just chill, man?
Go your own way.

474
00:31:53,654 --> 00:31:56,089
It's a smart move
staying put, bro.

475
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,624
I got your plate
right here.

476
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:08,992
Hey, hey, hey!

477
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,391
Hey, hey, hey!

- [grunts, yells]
- [gasps]

479
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:15,324
- [gasps]
- [groans]

480
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:21,758
Oh...

481
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:25,791
[panting] Oh, God.

482
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:27,691
[grunting]

483
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:31,116
Where's my phone?

484
00:32:33,949 --> 00:32:36,383
[horn blares, tires squeal]

485
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:25,951
Shit.

486
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:32,957
Hey. Hey!

487
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:36,392
[engine revving]

488
00:33:44,492 --> 00:33:45,591
Come on.

[engine revving]

490
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:53,359
Fuck.

491
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,359
Oh, God.

00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,426
[panting]

493
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:24,933
Oh, shit.

494
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:40,616
Shit, shit.

495
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,783
What? That's
my fucking phone.

496
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:59,216
Oh, God.
What's wrong with you?

497
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:02,482
[horn blares]

498
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:03,850

[gasps]

501
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:13,667
What are you doing, bitch?

502
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:15,167
[gasping] I'm sorry.

503
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:16,667
What's wrong with you?
"Sorry, sorry."

504
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:18,533
- I'm sorry, okay?
- It's a fucking one-way street.

505
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:19,499
Move!

506
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:21,266
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Move!

507
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:23,933
- "Sorry." You coming in here...
- Sorry, okay?

508
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,466
Learn how to drive!

509
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,767
- This is not how you drive.
- Sorry.

510
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,133
Fuck you!

511
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:30,616
[man] Dumb bitch!

00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,551
[engine stops]

515
00:36:07,116 --> 00:36:08,517
Oh, God.

516
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:14,517
[line ringing]

517
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,982
[voice mail] <i>Hi, it's Rachel.
Just leave a message.</i>

518
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:20,116
- [voice mail beeps]
- Hey, Rach. Just calling to see what's up.

519
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,583
Please call or text
with an ETA. Thanks.

520
00:36:27,017 --> 00:36:28,850
[sighs]

521
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:44,299
Are you Andy?

522
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:45,900
Uh, yeah.

523
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:47,734
I'm Tom Cooper.

524
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:51,199
- I'm an old friend of Rachel's.
- Oh, hey.

525
00:36:51,332 --> 00:36:55,167
Huh. That makes two of us.
Uh, have we met?

526
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:59,174
No, I, uh... I just moved
to town a couple weeks ago.

527
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:01,207
Rachel told me
she was meeting you here.

528
00:37:01,342 --> 00:37:04,174
Yeah. Well, you know what?
She's very, very late.

529
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:07,116
Well, she asked me
to apologize.

530
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:11,116
But it's hard to tell the level
of sincerity in that, isn't it?

531
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,891
- Uh, when did you talk to her?
- Ten minutes ago.

532
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,326
Okay. So, she's okay?
Everything's okay?

533
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:19,009
Well, Andy,
to tell you the truth...

534
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:22,408
she sounded
a little stressed.

535
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:24,208
She's got plenty
of reasons to be.

536
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:26,641
Yeah, yeah.
The divorce...

537
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,067
the salon, her mother.

538
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:33,299
Plus, she said some guy road-raged
on her pretty hard this morning.

539
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:35,500
- Really?
- Yeah.

540
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:43,833
About a year ago, a guy followed me
for about ten miles on my bumper.

541
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,600
Scary.

542
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:48,716
They follow me
all the time.

543
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:53,217
Yeah?

544
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:55,134
You should be careful.

545
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,333
You never know who you could
be driving next to, right?

546
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:01,832
Or who you might end up
married to. [chuckles]

547
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:03,400
How do you mean?

548
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:08,775
You said she was stressed
because of her divorce.

549
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:11,607
No, actually you said that.

550
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,616
- Yeah? Oh.
- Yeah.

551
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,884
She let me listen
to his voice mails.

552
00:38:18,582 --> 00:38:21,216
You know? I mean...

553
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,624
[sighs]

554
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,400
That guy sounds like
he's doing his best.

555
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:28,467
Well, the man's quit
every job he's ever had.

556
00:38:28,866 --> 00:38:30,600
- Is that his biggest crime?
- No.

557
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:33,332
Did he fuck around on her?
Anything like that?

558
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:35,650
He's just miserable.

559
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:40,384
Kind of like my 11:00 appointment's
gonna be if I show up late.

560
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:43,082
[clears throat] Listen, since you're
having better luck with Rachel,

561
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:45,483
can you just tell her
to call me, please?

562
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:48,000
Now, Counselor...

563
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,832
if I could get Rachel
on the phone...

564
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:55,100
would you buy me
a cup of coffee?

565
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,708
And if she doesn't pick up?

566
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:02,075
Well, then I guess
I owe you a cup of coffee.

567
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,241
Uh...

568
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,391
Okay.

569
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:12,424
[clattering]

570
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:15,559
Oh, God.

571
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:18,357
[cell phone ringing]

572
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,800
What?

573
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:33,366
Where is...

574
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,967
Oh, God.

575
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,967
[ringing continues]

576
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,200
What?

577
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:52,400
[clicks, ringing stops]

578
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,966
Andy?

579
00:39:58,033 --> 00:39:59,833
Are you serious?

580
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:02,467
Rach?

581
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,000
[Rachel] <i>Andy?</i>

582
00:40:04,633 --> 00:40:07,000
I'm sitting here, and I'm
waiting for you. What's...

583
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:10,434
[Rachel] <i>I-I don't... Whose phone is this?
I don't understand.</i>

584
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,175
How did you...

585
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,508
[Andy] <i>Rach, are you there?</i>

586
00:40:15,275 --> 00:40:16,975
[Rachel] <i>Are you
at Darrow's right now?</i>

587
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:20,708
Yeah, yeah. I'm sitting here
right across from your friend Tom.

588
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:22,616
- Cooper.
- Tom Cooper...

589
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,917
who apparently has an easier
time getting hold of you

590
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,483
than your
best friend/free lawyer.

591
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:31,150
I don't know a Tom Cooper.

592
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:32,967
<i>Tom Cooper,
who just moved to town,</i>

593
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,433
who you told to apologize
to me for being late.

594
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:38,233
- Nice guy. Sweet beard.
- [chuckles]

595
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:40,900
Hey, listen to me.

596
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,183
He's not a friend, okay.

597
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:47,783
<i>He's the psycho who came
after me today. Oh, God.</i>

598
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:49,583
[Rachel breathing heavily]

599
00:40:49,717 --> 00:41:08,384
I just watched him run over
someone at a gas station.

600
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:12,903
<i>Andy, do you hear me?
Are you there?</i>

601
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:16,559
No, you're gonna have to say that
again, Rachel. You're breaking up.

602
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:20,875
What the hell
are you doing?

603
00:41:21,124 --> 00:41:22,291
I'm just here with Andy.

604
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:24,825
Hey, if she's almost here,
I can wait.

605
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:28,325
Who says if you're
almost here, he can wait.

606
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:30,558
What do you want?

607
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:33,792
No, it's not what I want.
It's what I need.

608
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:37,059
And I need you to learn
what a bad day really is,

609
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:39,491
and I need you to learn
how to say you're sorry.

610
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,191
[Rachel] <i>Okay, fine.</i>

611
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:43,124
<i>I'm sorry. Okay?
There, I said it.</i>

612
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:45,425
No, how to say you're sorry
and actually fucking mean it.

613
00:41:45,558 --> 00:41:48,158
- Whoa, Tom.
- And this is the beginning of that first lesson.

614
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:49,825
- Can I have my phone back?
- No.

615
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:51,725
- [Rachel] <i>Leave him alone.</i>
- Just give me my phone.

616
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:55,758
[Rachel] <i>Andy?
What's happening?</i>

617
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:56,992
[people murmuring]

618
00:41:57,124 --> 00:41:58,358
What's happening?

619
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:04,375
- You're on speaker now, Rachel.
- [woman] Call the police!

620
00:42:04,508 --> 00:42:06,608
- [Rachel] <i>Andy.</i>
- Someone stop him!

621
00:42:06,742 --> 00:42:09,075
- [Rachel] <i>Andy.</i>
- [customers murmuring]

622
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:13,258
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- He is not okay. You hear me?

623
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,208
- You hear me?
- <i>Yes.</i>

624
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:16,900
I hear you.

625
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:18,600
[man] <i>Who is Andy?</i>

626
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:22,400
Is he really your best
friend/scumbag divorce lawyer?

627
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:24,366
- What?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

628
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:28,099
<i>The kind of person who fucks over
men like me and Richard for a living?</i>

629
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:29,500
Come on. Please.

630
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:32,800
<i>He doesn't do that, okay?
He's a decent guy.</i>

631
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:34,567
- Is that right?
- [Andy groans]

632
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,999
There's a divorce lawyer...

633
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:38,475
who doesn't fuck over
decent men for a living?

634
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:41,775
- I find that very hard to believe, Rachel!
- [grunting]

635
00:42:41,908 --> 00:42:43,908
- Very hard!
- [customers gasping, chattering]

636
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:46,408
[Rachel] <i>What is this?
Is this some kind of sick joke?</i>

637
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:50,241
- <i>Are you having sex with him?</i>
- What are you talking about?

638
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:53,075
'Cause these guys, they don't
get in trouble for that.

639
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:55,275
They'll fuck you
all kinds of ways.

640
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:58,481
Fuck you physically, fuck you
emotionally, fuck you financially.

641
00:42:58,591 --> 00:43:00,524
And they don't get
in trouble for it.

642
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:03,158
Has he been fucking you, Rachel?
Has he been fucking you?

643
00:43:03,293 --> 00:43:04,392
He's married, okay?

644
00:43:04,524 --> 00:43:06,825
That don't mean shit
these days.

645
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,259
<i>Just leave him alone.</i>

646
00:43:08,374 --> 00:43:10,508
Hey, Rachel, if you knew
this was gonna be

647
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:13,532
the very last time you could ever
talk to your lifelong friend Andy,

648
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:14,933
what would you say?

649
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:16,767
Wait. No, wait. What?

650
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:18,500
What would you say,
Rachel?

651
00:43:18,634 --> 00:43:19,899
[choking]

652
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:22,601
[Rachel] <i>Andy?
Hey, what's happening?</i>

653
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,351
[Rachel] <i>What's happening?</i>

654
00:43:24,483 --> 00:43:26,550
- That was a wasted opportunity.
- <i>Wait!</i>

655
00:43:26,683 --> 00:43:27,916
[Andy groans]

656
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,517
- [woman screams]
- [customers clamoring]

657
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,200
[Rachel] <i>Andy?</i>

658
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:35,599
<i>Andy?</i>

659
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:39,499
<i>Andy, are you there?</i>
He can't hear you no more.

660
00:43:42,068 --> 00:43:43,499
What do you mean?

661
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:47,483
Well, I think you know.

662
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:51,425
[Rachel] <i>No, I don't.
I don't, I don't. What did you do?</i>

663
00:43:51,558 --> 00:43:53,024
What did you do?

664
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:55,575
Well, why don't you
get yourself to a TV.

665
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:58,375
Gonna be a lot
of video soon.

666
00:43:58,908 --> 00:44:00,741
<i>You put him on the phone.</i>

667
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,774
<i>You put him back
on this goddamn phone.</i>

668
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:05,108
You put him back
on this goddamn phone!

669
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:07,008
No, I can't do that.

670
00:44:10,008 --> 00:44:11,175
Why not?

671
00:44:11,308 --> 00:44:13,008
<i>Well, number one...</i>

672
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:18,591
he's already dead.

673
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:21,825
No, he's not.

674
00:44:22,891 --> 00:44:24,025
No, he's...

675
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,933
Hey, listen, listen.

676
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,366
I'm really sorry, okay?

677
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,200
- [Rachel] <i>I'm really sorry.</i>
- You know...

678
00:44:32,332 --> 00:44:35,599
I can still hear that faint tinge
of "fuck you" in your voice.

679
00:44:36,101 --> 00:44:38,900
Never know it, but nothing's ever
your good goddamn fault, right?

680
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:41,001
[sirens blaring]

681
00:44:41,134 --> 00:44:42,499
[sighs]

682
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:43,733
Hello?

683
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:50,383

<i>You got some messages.
Got one from Dr. Miller.</i>

She wants to change your
Friday therapy appointment.

694
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:46,592
She better bring her A-game,
'cause you're gonna fucking need it.

<i>Got one here from the principal of

My son doesn't go to Wesley...

702

Rachel, I'm scrolling through
the pictures on your phone.

703
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:21,366
Don't be a fucking idiot.

704
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:23,168
Don't you touch my son!

705
00:46:23,299 --> 00:46:25,968
<i>Then tell me,
who's gonna die next, Rachel?</i>

706

707

<i>Give me a name,</i>

708
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:32,550

709
00:46:33,283 --> 00:46:34,982
[Rachel] <i>No. I can't.</i>

710
00:46:36,634 --> 00:46:37,699
What about Richard?

711
00:46:37,832 --> 00:46:39,300
No! No.

712
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:41,799
You telling me there's still
some feelings there?

713
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:44,133
He's my son's father.
Okay?

714
00:46:44,266 --> 00:46:47,699
- <i>You can't ask me to do that.</i>
- You know what I can do?

715
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:51,634
I can send the $2300 and change
you've got in your checking account

716
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:53,133
straight to Richard.

717
00:46:54,524 --> 00:46:55,958

in your savings account.

719
00:46:59,193 --> 00:47:00,524
You got me a name yet?

720
00:47:03,726 --> 00:47:05,458
<i>Look, here's an idea.</i>

721
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:09,091
<i>How about I swing by your mom's room
at the Shady Falls nursing home?</i>

722
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:12,458
Right after I burn your house
to the fucking ground.

723
00:47:12,924 --> 00:47:16,124
Me. Me, okay? I choose me.

724
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:17,824
<i>I choose me.</i>

725
00:47:18,824 --> 00:47:23,459
Well, that's very noble,
but you can't choose yourself.

726
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:25,024
<i>Why not?</i>

727
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:27,626
Because that would defeat
the fucking purpose, Rachel.

728
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:29,991
Give me a name.
Make a choice.

729
00:47:30,124 --> 00:47:32,726
<i>Who are you
gonna kill next?</i>

730
00:47:33,124 --> 00:47:35,492
<i>Your mom? Richard?</i>

731

732
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:39,526

733

Now, what was her sin,
Rachel?

737
00:47:50,608 --> 00:47:52,107
She fired me.

738
00:47:52,742 --> 00:47:55,141
<i>Through no fault
of yours, I'm sure.</i>

739
00:47:55,474 --> 00:47:57,174
<i>I gave you a name.</i>

740
00:47:57,742 --> 00:47:58,809
Yeah, you did.

741
00:47:59,308 --> 00:48:02,042
So, you won't hurt my son...

742

<i>or my mom,

743
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:05,426
Not right now.

744
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:08,358
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

745

854
00:54:07,991 --> 00:54:09,558
I'm the reason
for that. Okay?

855
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:11,692
Look. Look.

856
00:54:12,266 --> 00:54:13,866
That's my little brother,
okay?

857
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,667
And this maniac's gonna hurt him
even worse if you don't go get my son

858
00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:21,000
- in the next... two minutes.
- [phone vibrates]

859
00:54:21,134 --> 00:54:23,699
Look, that's him
texting me right now.

860
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:26,482
See, look.

861
00:54:27,116 --> 00:54:28,917
Look. Same guy.

862
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:32,750
Mrs. Ayers...

863
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:35,058
I need you to go
get my son.

864
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:38,991
Goddamn it, I need you
to go get my son!

865
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,525
[man] Dear Rachel,

866
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:44,792
you are now responsible
for Mary's death.

867
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:46,225
Okay?

868
00:54:46,357 --> 00:54:48,525
Come on.
Write the fucking letter.

869
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:51,125
[Rachel] Careful.
Come on.

870
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:53,324
[Kyle] Did you remember
my Butterfinger Blizzard?

871
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,825
[Rachel] Get in!

872
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,266
[panting]

873
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,800
Seat belt.

874
00:54:59,434 --> 00:55:00,933
[engine starts]

875
00:55:07,982 --> 00:55:09,350
You're freaking me out.

876
00:55:09,483 --> 00:55:11,483
- It's gonna be okay.
- Tell me what's happening.

877
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:14,217
- I'm not letting you out of my sight.
- What's going on?

878
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:15,982
Mom.

879
00:55:16,117 --> 00:55:19,450
[sirens blaring]

880
00:55:24,184 --> 00:55:26,250
Mom, why aren't you
talking to me?

881
00:55:30,284 --> 00:55:31,982
Have you got Kyle?

882
00:55:32,491 --> 00:55:33,558
[Rachel] <i>Yes.</i>

883
00:55:35,725 --> 00:55:37,025
Have him say hello.

884
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:41,141
Kyle, say hello.

885
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:43,942
- Is it Dad?
- No.

886
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:45,742
Just say hello.

887
00:55:47,108 --> 00:55:48,108
Hello?

888
00:55:48,975 --> 00:55:50,607
Now put my brother
on the phone.

889
00:55:52,442 --> 00:55:53,674
[exhales]

890
00:55:54,308 --> 00:55:56,641
[whimpering]

891
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:58,717
Talk.

892
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:04,016
[Fred] <i>Rachel?</i>

893
00:56:04,684 --> 00:56:06,083
Are you okay?

894
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,050
[Rachel] <i>Fred?</i>

895
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,817
Mary's gone.

896
00:56:11,482 --> 00:56:13,216
<i>Mary's dead. Mary...</i>

897
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,849
- <i>He made me...</i>
- No, no. You didn't. You didn't.

898
00:56:15,983 --> 00:56:18,116
- [Rachel] <i>You didn't.</i>
- You're right, I didn't.

899
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,516
You did.

900
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,784
- What?
- [Kyle] Mom?

901
00:56:22,283 --> 00:56:24,050
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

902
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,916
[Rachel] <i>Please, just...
just let him go.</i>

903
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:34,266
Put me on speaker.

904
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,683
You have kids?

905
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,017
<i>Family?</i>

906
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:44,616
Rachel, your little brother is
sitting in a puddle of lighter fluid

907
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,217
and his own piss.

908
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:48,683
Put me on fucking speaker.

909
00:56:50,982 --> 00:56:52,284
Okay.

910
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:57,750
- [man] <i>Kyle, can you hear me?</i>
- Yes.

911
00:56:57,883 --> 00:57:01,683
<i>I'm the man your mom honked her
horn at this morning. You remember?</i>

912
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:03,900
Yes.

913
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:05,699
[man] Your uncle Freddy,

914
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:08,133
he's written your mom a letter,
and he wants to read it out loud.

915
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:11,600
It's very important that she
remains quiet and respectful

916
00:57:11,732 --> 00:57:14,066
and she listens
to every word, okay?

917
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,099
Okay.

918
00:57:20,633 --> 00:57:22,266
Come on, Fred.

919
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,200
Read.

920
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:26,366
Come on. Read.

921
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:28,200
[grunts]

922
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:38,250
[gasping]

923
00:57:38,383 --> 00:57:41,583
"Dear Rachel,

924
00:57:42,183 --> 00:57:44,950
<i>you are now... res...</i>

925
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:48,050
<i>responsible...</i>

926
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:50,417
- for Mary's death."
- Responsible for Mary's death!

927
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,617
Read the fucking letter,
Fred!

928
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:55,883
"I now realize our loving...

929
00:57:57,091 --> 00:57:59,292
relationship has been a lie.

00:57:59,425 --> 00:58:01,392
[gasping, stammering]

931
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:03,958
You are the most entitled,

932
00:58:04,091 --> 00:58:07,592
<i>self-centered person
that I have ever known.</i>

933
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:09,991
Everything has...

934
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:15,058
has always been about you.

935
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,025
I am deeply ashamed of you.

936
00:58:18,158 --> 00:58:20,425
You are the reason...

937
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,058
this is happening to me

938
00:58:23,192 --> 00:58:27,091
and why I will never see
another sunrise in my life."

939
00:58:27,225 --> 00:58:28,225
[man] Good job.

940
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:29,591
Stop it! Just stop it!

941
00:58:29,724 --> 00:58:31,392
Are you talking to me
or to Freddy?

942
00:58:31,525 --> 00:58:33,325
- [Rachel] <i>You made your point.</i>
- [officer] Police!

943
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:35,091
Show me your hands
and step back.

944
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:38,525
I said put your hands in the
fucking air and step back now!

945
00:58:38,658 --> 00:58:41,177
- Six-Adam-Three, 10-33...
- Don't let him kill me.

946
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,275
- ...at 1204 North Jackson.
- He has a... He has a...

947
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:44,908
- Get on your knees!
- Fuck you.

948
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:46,008
[Fred] No!

949
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:48,208
[Fred screaming]

950
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:52,474
Do something! Help him!

951
00:58:53,918 --> 00:58:55,150
Help him!

952
00:59:02,416 --> 00:59:04,349
[retches]

953
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,683
[panting]

954
00:59:12,099 --> 00:59:15,700
[Rachel retches, coughs]

955
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,700
[labored breathing]

956
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:36,583
Mom?

957
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:43,983
Kyle...

958
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:46,866
- [phone ringing, buzzing]
- [Rachel] I'm sorry.

959
00:59:52,566 --> 00:59:55,033
No, don't answer it.
Don't answer it.

960
00:59:55,168 --> 00:59:57,233
It might be the cop.

961
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,933
Hello? Officer?

962
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:05,575
It's still me.

963
01:00:06,675 --> 01:00:07,841
Where is my brother?

964
01:00:07,976 --> 01:00:09,508
<i>Sorry, Rachel.</i>

965
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:12,408
<i>Freddy's gone.</i>

966
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,274
<i>If it's any consolation,</i>

967
01:00:14,408 --> 01:00:16,875
a fucking cop
shot my shoulder up.

968
01:00:17,508 --> 01:00:19,274
I hope you bleed to death.

969
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:20,808
<i>Well, that was sincere.</i>

970
01:00:20,943 --> 01:00:22,675
It's just not an apology.

971
01:00:22,808 --> 01:00:26,175
There are a lot of people in
my life who deserve apologies.

972
01:00:26,308 --> 01:00:27,741
You are not one of them.

973
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:32,149
Let's talk about Kyle

974
01:00:32,283 --> 01:00:34,483
<i>and how he's gonna die.</i>

975
01:00:35,892 --> 01:00:37,991
You so much as breathe
in his direction,

976
01:00:38,124 --> 01:00:40,591
no force on this earth will
stop me from killing you.

977
01:00:40,726 --> 01:00:41,793
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

978
01:00:41,925 --> 01:00:43,759
Sounds like
you're waking up.

979
01:00:43,892 --> 01:00:47,158
I am wide awake.

980
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:49,108
<i>Wide awake.</i>

981
01:00:49,241 --> 01:00:52,543
That's good,
'cause we ain't near done yet.

982
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:54,509
Yes, this is over.

983
01:00:54,642 --> 01:00:57,341
This is so fucking over,
you sick fuck!

984
01:00:58,741 --> 01:01:02,175
[gasps, panting]

985
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:04,259
Where should we go?

986
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:07,791
Police station. We should
go to the police station.

987
01:01:18,943 --> 01:01:20,308
[Kyle] Mom?

988
01:01:21,108 --> 01:01:22,508
Yeah?

989
01:01:22,976 --> 01:01:24,341
Can I call Dad?

990
01:01:25,575 --> 01:01:28,108
Sweetie, I don't have
my phone, remember?

991
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:30,316
That man took it.

992
01:01:31,116 --> 01:01:32,616
You have your tablet?

993
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:37,149
I think he stole it too.

994
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:39,751
Well, that's probably
a good thing.

995
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:44,216
Well, he has your phone,
so if we had your tablet,

996
01:01:44,349 --> 01:01:46,149
he could know where we are.

997
01:01:46,534 --> 01:01:47,832
What?

998
01:01:48,668 --> 01:01:50,733
He did know
where we were, but...

999
01:01:50,866 --> 01:01:52,999
he was using
that flip phone.

1000
01:01:53,534 --> 01:01:55,033
Don't you think?

1001
01:01:55,634 --> 01:01:57,966
Yeah, maybe.

1002
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:00,333
Hey, um...

1003
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:05,251
I looked for my tablet before, but...
do you just wanna take another look around

1004
01:02:05,384 --> 01:02:06,950
- just in case?
- Yeah.

1005
01:02:08,649 --> 01:02:10,217
- Check the seat pockets.
- Okay.

1006
01:02:10,983 --> 01:02:12,983
Have a really
good look, okay?

1007
01:02:16,418 --> 01:02:17,816
Look under the seats.

1008
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:22,549
- You see it?
- I don't think it's in here.

1009
01:02:25,849 --> 01:02:28,482
Wait, I think
I feel something.

1010
01:02:30,384 --> 01:02:32,016
- I think I see it.
- Where?

1011
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:34,318
- Under your seat, it's...
- What?

1012
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,516
It's stuck. It...

1013
01:02:35,649 --> 01:02:36,950
It's what?

1014
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:39,184
It was taped.

1015
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,418
Oh, my God.

1016
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,649
- Should I throw it out the window?
- Yeah.

1017
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,068
- No.
- What?

1018
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:46,232
Wait, wait, wait.

1019
01:02:46,366 --> 01:02:48,399
- "Find Your Phone" app.
- Yeah?

1020
01:02:48,533 --> 01:02:49,967
You put it
on the tablet too?

1021
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:51,366
Yeah.

1022
01:02:51,499 --> 01:02:53,967
So, if he still
has my phone,

1023
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,633
we should be able
to track him, right?

1024
01:02:56,766 --> 01:02:57,967
Right.

1025
01:02:58,466 --> 01:03:00,866
- Is it working?
- [tablet beeps]

1026
01:03:01,608 --> 01:03:03,708
- [tablet beeps]
- I see it.

1027
01:03:03,842 --> 01:03:05,374
Where is it?

1028
01:03:05,943 --> 01:03:07,274
Right next to us.

1029
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:10,107
Oh, my God.

1030
01:03:11,876 --> 01:03:13,408
[Kyle] Do you see him?

1031
01:03:21,207 --> 01:03:22,508
Oh, my God.

1032
01:03:24,374 --> 01:03:26,374
He's in front of us.

1033
01:03:26,784 --> 01:03:29,049
- He is?
- He has Rosie's van.

1034
01:03:29,999 --> 01:03:32,568
Mom, look! There's a cop.

1035
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,799
- Do you see him?
- It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

1036
01:03:35,933 --> 01:03:37,732
He can help us.

1037
01:03:37,866 --> 01:03:39,866
Put your seat belt back on.

1038
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:46,766
- Do not look at him, okay?
- [Kyle] Okay.

1039
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:12,549
Mom, that... that was...

1040
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,084
The exit. I know. I know.

1041
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:17,849
Kyle, just trust me
and get his attention.

1042
01:04:17,943 --> 01:04:19,341
Officer!

1043
01:04:19,474 --> 01:04:20,975
Hey!

1044
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,541
- Officer! Help!
- [Kyle] Hello!

1045
01:04:22,676 --> 01:04:25,709
- Officer! Hey!
- [Rachel] Hey! Help!

1046
01:04:27,975 --> 01:04:29,575
Roll your window down!

1047
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:32,474
- Please help us! Hello! Hey!
- We need help!

1048
01:04:32,608 --> 01:04:35,042
The guy you're looking for,
he's behind you!

1049
01:04:35,174 --> 01:04:36,541
Right behind you!

1050
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:37,617
Please help us!

1051
01:04:37,751 --> 01:04:38,651
Pull over!

1052
01:04:38,784 --> 01:04:40,183
[crash]

1053
01:04:44,684 --> 01:04:48,116
[panting]
Dispatch, request assist...

1054
01:04:49,383 --> 01:04:50,383
[gasps]

1055
01:04:56,617 --> 01:04:58,517
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1056
01:05:04,517 --> 01:05:05,651
Can you see him?

1057
01:05:05,784 --> 01:05:07,517
He... He's catching up.

1058
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:11,041
Go! Go!

1059
01:05:11,176 --> 01:05:13,774
- [Rachel] Kyle, call 911 on the tablet.
- [beeping]

1060
01:05:16,008 --> 01:05:17,707
[operator] <i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

1061
01:05:17,841 --> 01:05:20,874
[Rachel] The man on the news,
he's chasing me in a silver minivan.

1062
01:05:21,008 --> 01:05:22,941
- <i>Your current location?</i>
- Driving on 95 south.

1063
01:05:23,075 --> 01:05:24,508
Just after the State exit.

1064
01:05:24,641 --> 01:05:26,376
<i>Ma'am, all units
in that vicinity</i>

1065
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:28,542
<i>are currently responding
to a multi-vehicle crash.</i>

1066
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:32,041
He caused that accident!
My son and I are in danger!

1067
01:05:32,176 --> 01:05:33,741
<i>Ma'am, we cannot
get to you at the moment.</i>

1068
01:05:33,874 --> 01:05:36,276
<i>Stay on the line,
get someplace safe...</i>

1069
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:38,276
[Kyle] Mom, it died!

1070
01:05:38,408 --> 01:05:40,209
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

1071
01:05:41,075 --> 01:05:43,109
[Kyle] Tell me
you have the charger.

1072
01:05:43,892 --> 01:05:44,859
I don't.

1073
01:05:44,992 --> 01:05:46,158
Oh, my God.

1074
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:47,691
We're on our own.

1075
01:05:48,033 --> 01:05:49,266
Okay. Okay.

1076
01:05:49,399 --> 01:05:51,232
[Kyle] We should just
go to the station.

1077
01:05:51,366 --> 01:05:54,566
[Rachel] There's no way we can outrun him.
We have to lose him.

1078
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,566
- We need to go to Grandma's.
- Why?

1079
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,133
It's your strategy,
remember?

1080
01:05:58,266 --> 01:05:59,533
- From the video game?
- What?

1081
01:05:59,666 --> 01:06:01,666
It's somewhere
we're familiar with, okay?

1082
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:04,167
It's the safest place
to hide you.

1083
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:07,274
And we can call for help
with the silent alarm.

1084
01:06:07,408 --> 01:06:10,141
And it'll confuse the heck out of
someone who's never been there before.

1085
01:06:10,274 --> 01:06:12,609
Right, like Uncle Freddy
was saying.

1086
01:06:12,742 --> 01:06:15,541
He still gets lost there,
like a maze of spaghetti.

1087
01:06:15,676 --> 01:06:16,875
Yeah, exactly.

1088
01:06:17,008 --> 01:06:18,107
So you think he'll get lost?

1089
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:19,742
For long enough.

1090
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,709
[panting]

1091
01:06:28,088 --> 01:06:29,753
[Rachel panting]

1092
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:34,867
[Kyle] Drive!

1093
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,767
Go faster! Speed up!

1094
01:07:19,594 --> 01:07:21,827
[grunting]

1095
01:07:35,908 --> 01:07:37,441
He's right behind us.

1096
01:07:38,249 --> 01:07:39,716
He's catching up.

1097
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:51,316
Can you go any faster?

1098
01:08:03,633 --> 01:08:05,400
[horns honking]

1099
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,832
[panting]

1100
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:28,008
Hold on!

1101
01:08:28,141 --> 01:08:30,509
[tires squeal]

1102
01:08:36,525 --> 01:08:37,491
- [engine revs]
- Fuck!

1103
01:08:50,009 --> 01:08:52,741
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1104
01:08:55,442 --> 01:08:58,909
[labored breathing, groans]

1105
01:09:07,033 --> 01:09:08,801
- Can you see him?
- No.

1106
01:09:08,933 --> 01:09:11,199
I think he's still back
towards the entrance.

1107
01:10:06,451 --> 01:10:07,516
Kyle.

1108
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:10,567
Starting now,
we stick to our plan.

1109
01:10:10,699 --> 01:10:11,967
Our backup plan.

1110
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:15,034
Yeah, if we do that,
I promise you...

1111
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:18,967
we're gonna get through this
together, okay, you and me.

1112
01:10:19,266 --> 01:10:20,433
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1113
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,167
Go. Go.

1114
01:10:32,549 --> 01:10:33,817
[beeps]

1115
01:10:34,549 --> 01:10:36,582
[panting]

1116
01:10:40,482 --> 01:10:41,717
[beeps]

1117
01:12:31,216 --> 01:12:33,617
[breathing heavily]

1118
01:12:48,775 --> 01:12:50,309
[exhales]

1119
01:13:00,358 --> 01:13:04,158
[gasping, coughing]

1120
01:13:18,425 --> 01:13:19,458
[growls]

1121
01:13:22,492 --> 01:13:25,058
[panting]
Look at me! Look at me!

1122
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:27,357
Look at me. You see me?

1123
01:13:27,608 --> 01:13:29,275
You're always gonna see me.

1124
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:32,208
I'm always gonna be
inside your head.

1125
01:13:32,258 --> 01:13:34,525
Every time you think
of your little boy...

1126
01:13:34,658 --> 01:13:38,858
and what you could've done
to save him.

1127
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,308
[Rachel grunts]

1128
01:13:41,742 --> 01:13:44,875
[panting]

1129
01:14:16,817 --> 01:14:18,316
Kyle?

1130
01:14:19,366 --> 01:14:20,833
Kyle Flynn?

1131
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,433
It's the police.

1132
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,033
You're safe, son.
Come on out.

1133
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,800
Come on, son.

1134
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:44,983
Your mom's hurt,
but she's okay.

1135
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:48,900
She asked us
to come and get you.

1136
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:58,683
[breathing heavily]

1137
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:06,017
[sirens blaring]

1138
01:15:09,216 --> 01:15:10,683
Come on, son.

1139
01:15:11,558 --> 01:15:12,925
It's okay.

1140
01:15:17,308 --> 01:15:18,775
Come on out, boy.

1141
01:15:23,874 --> 01:15:26,375
[breathing heavily]

1142
01:15:26,509 --> 01:15:28,308

[shushes]

1145
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:51,775
- I made a lot of noise.
- It's okay.

1146
01:15:51,908 --> 01:15:52,976
[grunts]

1147
01:15:53,108 --> 01:15:55,608

[Kyle] No! No!

1154
01:16:15,866 --> 01:16:18,800
Get off me! Let go!

1155
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:22,066
- [grunting]
- [man groans]

1156
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,466

1158
01:16:31,016 --> 01:16:32,083

1173
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:37,991
[Rachel] You're okay.
You're okay.

1174
01:17:39,591 --> 01:17:40,892
Mom.

1175
01:17:56,091 --> 01:18:00,626
[reporter] We understand that it may have
started as a result of a two-car crash...

1176
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:03,991
[chattering]

1177
01:18:22,425 --> 01:18:23,592
[officer] Ms. Flynn?

1178
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:26,358
May I have a moment?

1179
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,400
It's okay.
We'll be right back.

1180
01:18:30,066 --> 01:18:31,166
Okay?

1181
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:37,366
I'm so sorry...
[officer continues, inaudible]

1182
01:18:50,908 --> 01:18:52,607
Uncle Fred's alive.

1183
01:18:53,816 --> 01:18:54,950
He is?

1184
01:18:55,616 --> 01:18:57,083
He's gonna be okay.

1185
01:18:57,217 --> 01:18:58,150
Can we go see him?

1186
01:18:58,284 --> 01:19:00,449
Yeah. Yeah.

1187
01:19:00,582 --> 01:19:03,482
We got your statement,
so you are free to go.

[shuddered breathing]

1192
01:19:58,742 --> 01:20:00,408
