1
00:00:02,181 --> 00:00:04,737
APOLLO 18

2
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:10,526
JULY 20, 1969- APOLLO 11 ASTRONAUT
NEIL ARMSTRONG...

3
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:13,009
...IS THE FIRST MAN TO WALK ON THE MOON

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,303
IN 1970 APOLLO MISSIONS 18, 19, 20 WERE
CANCELLED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONCERNS

5
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:20,938
7 DECEMBER, 1972- APOLLO 17...

6
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:24,388
...THE FINAL OFFICIAL LUNAR LANDS
ON THE MOON

7
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:29,897
IN 2011, 84 HOURS OF CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE

8
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:33,757
...IS UPLOADED TO WWW.LUNARTRUTH.COM

9
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:39,414
THIS FILM WAS EDITED FROM
THAT FOOTAGE

10
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:51,075
This's a lot of at stake here,
you know.

11
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:56,649
Talking, nation versus nation.

12
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,798
The race's still on.

13
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:02,909
It's a lot to discover up there.

14
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,470
I guess the call came in on a Friday.

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,670
They've never been to a barbecue.
JOHN GREY COMMAND MODULE PILOT

16
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:12,589
Just few beers you know,
or more than a few.

17
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,997
Could Vince's cooking, he
definitely need few.

18
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:19,211
Nate took the call from Milton.

19
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:23,329
And Milton said, "Eighteen is back on"

20
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,387
But it was classified D.O.D.,
top secret.

21
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:30,489
Asked him "are you OK with that?

22
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:33,964
And it was like "are you kidding me?"

23
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:37,084
I come from a family military pilots.

24
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:40,656
Duty can sometimes pound on
private life.

25
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:43,313
Make choices. Keep going forward.

26
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:47,000
NASA already has like 800 pounds rocks.
Nathan Walker; Mission Commander

27
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:48,782
So why we need more, I don't know,

28
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:52,181
...but, hey, if it means a
trip to the moon.

29
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:56,297
Placing cameras, we have these
Westinghouses all over the place.

30
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:58,961
Well, I think the way it's been
explained is...

31
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:04,151
...they're using a Saturn 5 to launch
classified D.O.D payload.

32
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:07,922
...which's meant to be very large
very heavy and...

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,524
...apparently unmanned.

34
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:15,615
Apparently.

35
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:18,894
Placing these high frequency
transmitters because...

36
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:22,347
...really warning anti-missile defense
system of Soviyet Union.

37
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:26,021
These PSD 5 are kind of like
high-tech radar scanners.

38
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,673
They should pick up and track
anything we can't.

39
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,235
To keep an eye on the Russian's air.

40
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,719
It would be nice to tell my wife.
Benjamin Andersen-Lunar Module Pilot

41
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,358
Or been by my side whole time
and then.

42
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:42,467
She thinks I'm doing training exercise
with the Japanese space agency.

43
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,232
Brian, my boy, it would be nice to tell
him his father's going to the moon.

44
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:50,492
I'd love brought to him a souvenir.
Maybe, a moonrock.

45
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:53,223
I don't know, may be one day.

46
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:56,989
Ben was always the first in his class.
And I was always running at his heels.

47
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,099
I mean, I'm jealous that he will
walk on the moon with Nate...

48
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:03,419
...while I'm alone in an orbit flight.

49
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:08,700
My job is essentially to make sure
I'm bringing us home safely.

50
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:12,359
Look, let's face it. These missions
are result-oriented.

51
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:16,096
And we can't afford the failure
you know, can we?

52
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:18,478
Things can go wrong... things to go
wrong happen.

53
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:21,566
These things you're gonna push
them out of your mind.

54
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,392
It's just not an option.

55
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:31,191
I'm proud to do for these guys,
and proud to do for my country.

56
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:37,237
Ten, nine, eight...

57
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:40,768
seven, six, five...

58
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,743
four, three, two, one.

59
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,555
Apollo 18, it looks good.

60
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:11,298
Christmas lights.

61
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:14,812
- Bring the Christmas lights back?
- I don't know. Not me.

62
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:18,428
- Have you seen anything like that before?
- No, sorry.

63
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,932
It's amazing.

64
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,087
The earth in all her glory.

65
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:30,681
There is a good-looking boy.
You sure he's yours?

66
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:31,894
Watch it.

67
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,930
He's a good kid.

68
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:37,386
It has a large space to fill.
Play on Moon Boots.

69
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:41,980
Nate, you've waited all this time to
put your foot on the moon...

70
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:43,860
...and you need to be number 13.

71
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:46,074
How do you feel about that?

72
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,928
Are you gonna be OK
with staying behind John?

73
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:52,775
Oh, you know, would be nice to have
some alone times here.

74
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,422
It's crowded in here.

75
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:58,297
I keep a light on for you boys.
Don't stay out until late.

76
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:02,978
- In a couple days.
- Roger that.

77
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:05,900
See you in a couple days.

78
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:18,233
Houston, this is Freedom. We're
preparing to unboard the Liberty.Over.

79
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:22,879
OK,18. you can go front
dock in four minutes.

80
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:26,840
John, is the tunnel vented?

81
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:30,082
Roger that. The tunnel is vented.

82
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,958
OK, we are ready. We'll send you
an updated state background on that.

83
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,112
Roger Houston. We're coding the data.
The computer is all yours.

84
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:42,809
I wish you come with us, John.

85
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,321
- Now, you be careful down there.
- Don't worry about it

86
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:52,769
- Got a good visual around here
- OK, 18. You're ready for that.

87
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,138
We go to the moon.

88
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,087
1400 feet.
44 down.

89
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:03,063
OK, good. Down to 1000 feet.

90
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:09,669
54 LPD.

91
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:12,552
20 feet down. Repeat, 20 feet down.

92
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:15,555
OK, good.

93
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:20,069
Mission Elapsed Time:
Four days, 6 hours and 33 minutes.

94
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:22,574
Roger.

95
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:26,248
Here we are.
Take it down.

96
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:28,742
- Carefull with the line. Over.
- Where?

97
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:31,190
After that next crater.
4 o'clock.

98
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,625
It seems pretty rocky area. Mark it.

99
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:38,892
430 feet.
Down 15.

100
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:44,306
Houston, we have a program alarm
1201.

101
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:48,911
- You have go to 1201 Liberty.
- Roger. Go to 1201.

102
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:54,572
Do you want to take about
reversing that approach?

103
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,707
Negative. We miss the window.
The moon isn't...

104
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:02,713
- We're closing now. Three, two, one.
- How does it look?

105
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:06,247
- We're coming in too fast.
- Try to stabilize.

106
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:08,990
Negative Houston.
The range is long. We go to manual.

107
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:15,238
- Contact Light.
- Standby everyone.

108
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:16,391
Stay. No stay.

109
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:20,752
Stay where you are Liberty.

110
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,758
Houston, give that man a cigar.

111
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,851
- Looks great.
- Excellent landing.

112
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,940
You talking to me or to Nate?

113
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:39,040
I'm talking you both, kid.

114
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,127
25 December, 1974.

115
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,987
EMD... 4 days
nine hours, 23 minutes.

116
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:46,641
Commander, Nathan Walker.
Ministry of Defense, Mission Report 1A.

117
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:50,773
For day one of our two-day mission...

118
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,715
This is Thomas Young of
Apollo Mission Control.

119
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:55,459
- Managed to move our 16 mm cameras.
- Copy.

120
00:07:56,267 --> 00:08:01,805
Looks like 5 reels 10,000 feet
Kodachrome.

121
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:05,852
Houston, we're prepared for OA1.

122
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,588
Copy Liberty. You are go for
decompression chamber.

123
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:15,659
But not good boys.
We don't want anyone catching cold.

124
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:19,516
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

125
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:24,928
I look after him.
Hope that the hose is long enough.

126
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:38,979
Houston...

127
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:44,883
...we take now the first step
on the South Pole.

128
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:51,148
I had prepared a speech but
I don't have much audiences anyway.

129
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,754
Do not worry about it.
You will have opportunity soon.

130
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,798
There are rock formations
everywhere.

131
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,049
The sun is low on the horizon.

132
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,632
Maybe.

133
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:11,020
Freedom, do you hear?

134
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:14,306
Freedom receiving you loud and clear,
Liberty. Over.

135
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:25,815
Yeah, yeah, perfect.

136
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,665
You call that a salute?

137
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:32,115
OK. Let me get a shot of you with
that LEM in the background.

138
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,504
It's more like a naval salute.

139
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:40,799
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got to get this.

140
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,394
I promised Lauren and Brian
Christmas to spend with them.

141
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:47,689
This's all going back to the
Department of Defense.

142
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:52,135
We're placing Westinghouse
cams.

143
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:54,286
WESTINGHOUSE MOTION
DETECTION CAMERA

144
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:58,313
Sounds good, Nate.
Standby.

145
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:02,917
Motion cencor is tracking you
perfectly, Nate

146
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:06,794
Captain says that we will
test the audio when you get back.

147
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:14,810
I'm checking the payload
in the missile unit.

148
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:31,601
What was that?

149
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:43,095
Houston, need check that panel
for anything that interferences.

150
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:47,899
Roger. You need to walk to procedure
location 1 and initiate the procedure.

151
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:50,660
Copy. We're on our way.

152
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:54,389
Hey, take a look at that.

153
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,794
Makes you think, doesn't it?

154
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:01,455
It's dusty.

155
00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:04,894
Leave the camera here, so
you get better view Tommy.

156
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:18,890
It's hard to believe that the sun
never shines in some places.

157
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:24,362
Careful now, fellows.

158
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,664
If you are in any of
those craters, you can call to her

159
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:36,945
- PSD5 in place.
- Copy that.

160
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,198
You recorded signal frequency
on the PSD5 in your training?

161
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,423
- It was without that, wasn't it?
- I thought, it was.

162
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:47,951
I think they have changed it.

163
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:51,047
That's the coordinates: 4.3 on Z and...

164
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:55,321
Inititating sequence is completed.

165
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:06,679
If we gonna get noise
from the high tech again?

166
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,492
Don't worry.

167
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:12,264
A good geological sample
and what appears to be...

168
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:15,178
...an impact crater.

169
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:21,729
Samples feel...

170
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,070
...strange.

171
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:41,534
Let's get out of here.

172
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:44,728
EMD...four days,
14 hours and 48 minutes.

173
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,546
Commander Nathan Walker.

174
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:48,478
D.o.D mission report 3C.

175
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:51,072
Day 1, DVA 1 complete.

176
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:57,341
I'm starving.
What's the menu tonight?

177
00:12:57,342 --> 00:13:00,873
- Carrots or peas?
- I'll take carrots.

178
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:04,028
- Get the peas.
- Perfect.

179
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,958
I am many proud of you boys.

180
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:13,210
- You have good time out there?
- You know we have.

181
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:17,870
There is much noise in this frequency.
See if I can isolate it.

182
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:20,825
Cleared up a little bit.

183
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:24,293
Copy that.

184
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:37,742
<i>Astronaut Brian Anderson,
with his dad, flies through space.</i>

185
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:40,652
<i>- Honey, what are you doing?
- Just playing mom.</i>

186
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,665
<i>Don't play with your dad's stuff.</i>

187
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:46,373
<i>- Is this a recording?
- I'm sorry, Dad. I love you.</i>

188
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,318
Beverley is in panic because
hairdresser appointment ran over.

189
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:56,948
Stan and Gene already over,
nothing is ready, so...

190
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:59,431
I offered to help in cutting
the peppers.

191
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:02,234
Couple minutes later I'm in
the bathroom taking a leak...

192
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:05,664
...and with all these peppers
in my hands...

193
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:08,994
Next thing I know, my crotch is
on fire.

194
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:13,522
- So, I'm in the bathroom howling in pain.
- They can not hear you.

195
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:16,871
They all heard me.
Stan's wife is a nurse, so...

196
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:19,898
she sends me back into the bathroom,
with a cup of milk.

197
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:23,758
Hey, I guess you're about to tell me that
you have your balls in a glass of milk?

198
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:27,334
- Hey, no knock it. It works.
- Jalapeno dick!

199
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:30,039
I can't believe that you've
never heard that story?

200
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,031
- Beverly's back to Miami?
- Yes. I heard that.

201
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:36,605
Hear, you divorced because
you snore, right?

202
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,552
I do not snore.

203
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:43,416
Every time!

204
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,091
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

205
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:47,954
- Bumped your head?
- Again!

206
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:49,305
It's big head.

207
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:52,518
Good night guys.
Great first day.

208
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:59,059
- Good night, JD.
- Never should told you that, litle prick.

209
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:56,495
- Nate?
- Yeah, I hear it.

210
00:15:57,177 --> 00:16:00,905
- What can that be here?
- Give me a second.

211
00:16:01,724 --> 00:16:05,962
Should be on the cam.

212
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:08,574
What is that?

213
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:16,247
- Hear that?
- Yes.

214
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,823
I don't think it comes from here.

215
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:38,360
It does not sound right.

216
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:42,993
- I can't find down here.
- It's army.

217
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,567
You think this interference can
be coming from the PSD5?

218
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:51,168
We don't see any obvious.
We double check with the D.o.D.

219
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:04,066
We'll look into it.
You go get some sleep.

220
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:59,944
I am up.
Turn off the noise.

221
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:04,782
Good morning, Liberty. We took care of the
interference a couple hours ago.

222
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:09,752
It should be OK now.
Do you get ready for OA2?

223
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:20,927
EMD... five days, 8 hours and 34 minutes.
And I'm Ben Anderson.

224
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:25,034
I need to document this.

225
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:30,150
Nate says he never snores in his sleep.

226
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,838
I got proof.

227
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,716
Hello boys, just to let you know...

228
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,282
...Freedom, we're going to around the
corner to the back side.

229
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:54,906
- No communication a while.
- Roger that.

230
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:02,963
- I've made you breakfast.
- What do I got?

231
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:06,814
- Scrambled eggs.
- Again.

232
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:10,521
- What do you got?
- A delicious hamsbread.

233
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,499
It's all yours.

234
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:18,238
Just like Mom makes.

235
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:26,512
Hey, did you remove one of my samples?
One of my samples is on the ground.

236
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:34,976
What does that mean, Ben?

237
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:40,154
I don't know.
I bagged and tagged everything.

238
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,244
Look, let's go back in there
giving a scoop.

239
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,594
Oh, damn! This one is contaminated.

240
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:59,853
- I don't understand. How did it get here?
- I don't know.

241
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:03,043
- This's really bad. How did it get here?
- I don't know.

242
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,371
D.o.D's checked around the interference
with the first payload.

243
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:19,132
So found diagnostics...

244
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:24,058
Houston, do you copy?

245
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,801
- There is no communication.
- Probably get some blokage.

246
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:31,034
I see some big craters.

247
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:34,562
Five days, ten hours, 40 minutes
since we left off.

248
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,866
I'm commander Nathan Walker.
We are on DVA 2.

249
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:40,087
Initiating day 2 receiver cell.

250
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:50,258
Activated PSD5 transmission
signal to go.

251
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:56,245
Houston, do you copy?
This is Liberty. Over.

252
00:20:56,985 --> 00:20:59,808
Still down.

253
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:05,726
There's something with that frequency.
Communication can't be down like that.

254
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,778
- Not for this like the time.
- Where are you going?

255
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:14,614
What the hell?

256
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:16,562
- Nate.
- What is it?

257
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:22,975
- Tracks.
- What?

258
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:29,373
That's impossible.

259
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:32,479
These are not ours.

260
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:39,777
EMD... five days, 11 hours, 7 minutes.
Alan P. Anderson.

261
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:50,553
Houston, this is 18.
Do you copy?

262
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,693
Houston, it's 18.
Do you hear?

263
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:03,034
John is on the back side.
No communication with him either.

264
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:08,201
Let's see where they lead.

265
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:12,064
- Impact Crater.
- Feel that?

266
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,824
Yeah, temperature's dropped.

267
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:23,493
Look at the footprints.
It makes no sense.

268
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:27,087
Like it runs in circles.

269
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:31,807
Disoriented.

270
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,474
- How should you do that?
- I don't know.

271
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:41,232
They go from this direction.

272
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:47,523
Come over here.

273
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:00,740
Holly shit!

274
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:12,481
- It is Russians.
- What the hell?

275
00:23:25,913 --> 00:23:29,353
How can be Russians on the moon
and nobody know about them?

276
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,133
We are on the moon
and nobody knows about it.

277
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:42,187
Something is not right.

278
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:48,988
I'll look inside.

279
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:03,547
The lights are out.

280
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:30,869
Somebody's lost it in here.

281
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,395
Everything is crashed.

282
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:42,774
Their system isn't different
from ours.

283
00:24:47,575 --> 00:24:50,674
The power is on.
Oxygen reserve is good.

284
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:54,512
I can't tell whether they
fully operational though.

285
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,251
- Where the hell did they go?
- I don't know.

286
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,146
- I want to take a look around.
- Stay close.

287
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:09,533
Those Russians could be anywhere.

288
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:16,967
What the hell?

289
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:22,385
There is blood. A lot of blood.

290
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:27,767
Someone's got hurt pretty bad.

291
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,295
I don't like this.

292
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:44,808
I think I see something inside the crater.

293
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:53,250
I'll go down.

294
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,724
Wait, Ben. The suits are no
ready for that kind of cold.

295
00:26:01,747 --> 00:26:05,120
No cape. The crater is so deep.

296
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:11,404
It's so cold.

297
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:14,916
I'll see around.

298
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:19,689
The ground is different.

299
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,030
It is soft.

300
00:26:23,794 --> 00:26:26,830
Get out of there.

301
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:36,629
Oh, my god!

302
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:40,790
It's so cold.

303
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:45,853
Get out of there.
Ben!

304
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:49,375
OK, I'm get out of here.

305
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:51,454
Holy shit!

306
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:56,525
It's a dead cosmonaut.

307
00:26:58,206 --> 00:27:01,528
I'm on my way up.

308
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,177
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm get to go.

309
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:14,175
What happened here?

310
00:27:14,685 --> 00:27:19,382
- Maybe the other cosmonaut?
- Do you think killed him?

311
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:29,723
- There is a crack.
- What are you doing?

312
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:33,219
Get your head out of there.

313
00:27:33,594 --> 00:27:36,081
Wait. Something..

314
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:40,018
What the hell was that?

315
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,463
It's a rock.

316
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:55,137
Have it in his jacket down here.
I don't know.

317
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:57,617
Let's get out of here.

318
00:28:00,297 --> 00:28:04,026
We're on the point of no turning back.
If we don't go now, we're just as dead.

319
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:13,057
- I don't like someone has died up here.
- I know.

320
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:28,495
This is a secure line.
I'm just talking to you, right Tommy?

321
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,503
You're just talking to me.

322
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:34,738
The Russians have been to the moon.

323
00:28:34,774 --> 00:28:36,283
Say that again?

324
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,208
The Russians have landed on the South Pool.

325
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:42,871
We've found their LK Proton lander.

326
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:45,581
It has not ended well for the cosmonauts.

327
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:49,198
- We find the crash of the Russians?
- They didn't crashed.

328
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:56,028
- We found his body in a crater.
- You found a dead cosmonaut?

329
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:58,588
Somebody didn't know this?

330
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:03,001
We landed less than 2
clicks of the Soviets, OK?

331
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:05,654
You still believe they
did not know we were here.

332
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,156
We know they scrapped a manned
flight programme in '69.

333
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:13,030
That was the official word.

334
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:18,117
Did you know they were here?

335
00:29:21,187 --> 00:29:22,903
Tommy?

336
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:24,509
This is a D.o.D mission Nate.

337
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:28,034
I'm just bringing down what I need
to know. That's all I can tell you.

338
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:31,946
Say that prick from the D.o.D
to give me a call.

339
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:36,605
Get some rest. I get the go D.o.D
over here and talk to you soon.

340
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:41,550
Tommie is straight here.

341
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:44,124
I knew something's wrong
from the beginning.

342
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,885
OK, what do you think?

343
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:49,851
D.o.D's taken over.
Lying to our families.

344
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:53,803
And the Russians up here for what?
To set up some listening devices?

345
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:58,067
I don't know.
That makes no sense.

346
00:29:58,068 --> 00:30:01,760
Come on, think about Watergate, Nate.
That was our president for God's sake.

347
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:04,379
And you don't think the
D.o.D which is lie to us?

348
00:30:05,018 --> 00:30:08,261
So what are we doing up here?

349
00:30:08,878 --> 00:30:11,833
What we're really doing?

350
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:18,730
This can be spooky a little.

351
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:23,810
Strange beauty in the backside.

352
00:30:25,795 --> 00:30:28,018
I do not know if my mind plays
tricks on me...

353
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:30,579
...but every so often you go
to those little windows...

354
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:33,590
...get this sense as if
something is looking back.

355
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,595
Looking back to you.

356
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,412
Nate, look at this.

357
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,289
- What?
- Look at this!

358
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:40,818
The flag is gone.

359
00:32:44,988 --> 00:32:48,347
- This isn't right.
- Houston, this is 18. Over.

360
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:51,655
Houston, Liberty.

361
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:55,064
Did you see anything unusual in the
Westinghouse last night?

362
00:32:56,235 --> 00:33:00,094
We had some interferences.

363
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:02,303
Our flag has gone.

364
00:33:02,736 --> 00:33:04,898
Repeat again.

365
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:09,863
Repeat once.

366
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:16,422
Maybe the other cosmonaut
took it.

367
00:33:17,002 --> 00:33:18,569
If there is another cosmonaut...

368
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:24,327
...he would need oxygen for
minimum 10 to 12 hours.

369
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:28,022
- What do you think, John?
- There is no way.

370
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:30,403
He can not carry that much.

371
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:32,209
So, how can he survive?

372
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:34,900
Maybe there is not a 'he'.

373
00:33:34,937 --> 00:33:37,392
You're saying the Soviet flew
one man mission?

374
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:40,557
- It would not be the first time.
- One cosmonaut...

375
00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:45,608
But who took the flag?
Who killed the other cosmonaut we found?

376
00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:48,334
Please get the D.o.D online.

377
00:33:48,335 --> 00:33:49,870
Now.

378
00:33:49,872 --> 00:33:53,617
We suspect that the Soviets are
there, but we have no confirmation.

379
00:33:53,653 --> 00:33:55,325
The Intelligence warned that
they might be...

380
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:58,379
...disguising the machines as
routine satellite launches.

381
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,359
Why the hell did not you tell us?

382
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:02,054
National security.

383
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:05,008
We carried out the card pretty close
to the desk. No other option.

384
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,581
I'm sure you can understand.

385
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:09,370
Maybe a little too close.

386
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:14,248
We were concerned that they
might ride to the sky first.

387
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:17,350
That would be a national security disaster.

388
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:19,324
So, where the hell is
the other cosmonaut?

389
00:34:19,937 --> 00:34:22,087
They're just gonna leave
him here?

390
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:26,795
Our intelligence suggests
there was only one cosmanaut.

391
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:27,438
Oh, God!

392
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:31,238
The mission is complete.
Time to get you boys home again.

393
00:34:33,256 --> 00:34:34,469
So, that's it?

394
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:40,821
First we return home
and ask questions later.

395
00:34:55,198 --> 00:34:58,756
- What was that?
- Let's get out of here.

396
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:02,340
It looks pretty good.

397
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:03,818
Ten seconds.

398
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,915
Ten seconds.
Wait for my mark.

399
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:08,653
- Eight...
- Time to go home.

400
00:35:08,654 --> 00:35:10,043
Seven, six...

401
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:26,887
- That's the alarm.
- We can't go. No go. We are no go.

402
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:28,648
Save this damn thing.

403
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:30,425
I try.
I got a power glitch.

404
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:32,120
Use the spare oxygen.

405
00:35:32,156 --> 00:35:34,120
- We have a leak somewhere.
- I try to isolate the tanks.

406
00:35:34,156 --> 00:35:34,952
See if I can stop it.

407
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:36,869
Houston, do you copy?

408
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,182
Houston, do you copy?
We lost communication.

409
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,824
Dropped out. Closed.

410
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:45,630
- No, no.
- What the hell is going on?

411
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:48,413
Houston, this is Liberty. Over.

412
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:11,148
We just lost communication.

413
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:17,796
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.

414
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:20,635
Maybe hit the LEM,
or a meteor rain.

415
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,595
There's no way no tell.
I'm gonna to the air.

416
00:36:23,596 --> 00:36:26,036
Are you sure about this?

417
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:29,206
We need communication
to get home.

418
00:36:29,207 --> 00:36:31,295
You just stay here and wait.

419
00:36:32,578 --> 00:36:34,980
- Look, I served in the army...
- Shut up.

420
00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:38,980
Go down the platform.

421
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:41,941
Nothing on the bottom.

422
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,795
EMD...Six days.

423
00:36:46,686 --> 00:36:49,624
13 hours, 46 minutes.

424
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:54,051
Commander Walker is performing
an unplanned DVA...

425
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:56,692
...to repair the antenna on the Roover.

426
00:36:58,202 --> 00:37:02,802
We experience...we experience
some unexplained...

427
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,545
...malfunctions.

428
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,226
The whole installation seems damaged.

429
00:37:14,756 --> 00:37:18,521
Could be the brief impact
but I don't see any meteor residue.

430
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:28,330
- This reaped to pieces.
- Something crashed it?

431
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:30,402
I can't tell.

432
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:33,151
We get the same sound each time
we activated the communication..

433
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:36,776
- Go to a different frequency.
- Frequency is blocked.

434
00:37:36,777 --> 00:37:38,992
I never heard anything like it.

435
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:41,252
Wait. Wait.

436
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:50,461
Nate, talk to me. What do you see?

437
00:37:50,462 --> 00:37:52,657
Footprint tracks.

438
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:56,437
Footprints?
Maybe there is another cosmonaut.

439
00:37:56,438 --> 00:37:57,902
No.

440
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,642
Mission Duration:
Six days, 13 hours, 47 minutes.

441
00:38:03,643 --> 00:38:05,845
Commander Nathan Walker.

442
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:11,493
We witness tracks that could be
evidence of extraterrestial contact.

443
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:15,713
We witness tracks that could be
evidence of extraterrestial contact.

444
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:20,449
Do you know what you're saying?

445
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:23,960
These tracks are not human.

446
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,242
I found the flag.

447
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:31,958
It's shreded.

448
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,828
And the motion censor camera gone.

449
00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:39,903
That looks OK.

450
00:38:41,114 --> 00:38:43,546
I'm turning the Roover back up.

451
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,837
The connection looks good.

452
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,350
Try contact to Houston or Freedom.

453
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,565
Freedom, copy?

454
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:10,769
Houston, do you copy?

455
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:15,477
Dammit.

456
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:18,783
- No, looks not working.
- OK. Let me try something.

457
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:33,556
Wait.

458
00:39:34,198 --> 00:39:38,000
- Something is moving.
- What?

459
00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:43,574
- I don't see anything
- There's something in my boots.

460
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:48,533
It's in my helmet.

461
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:52,643
- OK, listen to me. Go back to the lab.
- I can't get it out!

462
00:39:52,644 --> 00:39:55,337
- Listen.Go back to the lab. OK?
- I can't get it out.

463
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:58,031
There is nothing inside your suit.
Go back to the ship.

464
00:39:58,067 --> 00:39:59,304
It's in my helmet.

465
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:01,464
Don't take it out!

466
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:05,001
Nate!

467
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,272
Jesus Christ!

468
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,948
Nate!
Nate!

469
00:40:34,212 --> 00:40:35,419
Nate!

470
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,791
You need oxygen.

471
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:44,116
Come on Nate! Keep moving.

472
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:47,417
We're almost there.

473
00:40:47,418 --> 00:40:49,626
Keep moving.

474
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:54,667
Almost there. Come on.
Come on. Almost there.

475
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:12,583
Pull yourself up.

476
00:41:14,662 --> 00:41:17,127
The door is closed.

477
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:23,781
Cabin press auto,
4.5 psi.

478
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,079
You don't get enough oxygen.

479
00:41:36,095 --> 00:41:39,202
Breathe! Breathe!

480
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,332
One.

481
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,822
Look at me in the eye.
You'll be fine.

482
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,426
Two.

483
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,500
Two and a half.

484
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:02,203
The cabin pressure is stable.
It's okay.

485
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:11,442
So, you OK?

486
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:14,424
I'm fine.

487
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,777
What happened out there?

488
00:42:23,852 --> 00:42:27,765
You've started screaming, I've come out
there and you're on your back.

489
00:42:34,023 --> 00:42:37,128
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you hear me?Over.

490
00:42:39,397 --> 00:42:42,394
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

491
00:42:48,243 --> 00:42:50,826
Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you hear me?

492
00:42:50,827 --> 00:42:52,598
We hear you, John. Over.

493
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:54,205
I can't receive the Liberty, Tommy.

494
00:42:54,242 --> 00:42:57,467
Copy that Freedom.
We have the same problem down here.

495
00:42:57,504 --> 00:42:59,541
Have you tried to change the frequency?

496
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:05,229
No. We had some sort of interference.
Could have something to do with those PSD5.

497
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:09,802
We are not sure yet that PDS5
are the source of the problem.

498
00:43:09,832 --> 00:43:14,040
I want to switch shut down the
receivers to see what happened.

499
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:16,385
Negative.

500
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:19,728
Why not? We got two men
down there Tommy. Come on.

501
00:43:21,102 --> 00:43:22,723
Tommy?

502
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,295
Are you there?

503
00:43:25,707 --> 00:43:28,959
We are working on the problem.
We'll keep you adviced.

504
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:32,490
Oh, you're working on it.
That's great.

505
00:43:33,783 --> 00:43:35,557
God damn it.

506
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:40,899
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

507
00:43:44,843 --> 00:43:48,133
EMD...
Six days, 16 hours, 12 minutes.

508
00:43:48,134 --> 00:43:51,734
Post DVA 1,5 hours
with Commander Walker

509
00:43:51,894 --> 00:43:54,096
I've already told everything
I remember.

510
00:43:54,576 --> 00:43:56,496
Come on.

511
00:43:56,506 --> 00:43:58,773
Are you paranoid, Ben?

512
00:44:00,256 --> 00:44:02,192
I thought I saw something...

513
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:08,594
I thought I saw something on
the corner of my eye. I was wrong...

514
00:44:09,117 --> 00:44:11,579
...and then there was a shrieking voice...

515
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:14,193
...and caught off guard.

516
00:44:14,328 --> 00:44:16,082
I must have hit a rock.

517
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:19,438
That's it.

518
00:44:21,008 --> 00:44:23,446
You said something was in your
helmet.

519
00:44:23,447 --> 00:44:25,329
You yelled.

520
00:44:33,923 --> 00:44:35,777
I don't remember that.

521
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:41,980
Christ! You're bleeding.

522
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:45,145
Look at your shirt.
You bleed.

523
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:49,824
Jeez.
Take the first aid kit.

524
00:44:57,786 --> 00:45:00,732
You said that something was
inside your suit.

525
00:45:05,924 --> 00:45:07,875
That's what you said.

526
00:45:07,876 --> 00:45:10,137
You said inside your helmet.

527
00:45:16,674 --> 00:45:19,269
I wonder
how did you get that wound.

528
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:23,456
If there is something in your suit,
where the hell did it go?

529
00:45:24,484 --> 00:45:26,378
Wait a second.

530
00:45:26,394 --> 00:45:31,376
Nate, I can feel it
right here.

531
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:34,866
Oh, man! Something's inside.

532
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:37,671
- What are you talking about?
- Look, it's just below the skin.

533
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,542
I need to get that out. OK?

534
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:50,969
Yeah. OK.
Just make it quick.

535
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,601
Everything is right.

536
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:11,929
Hang in there!

537
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:17,904
Damn, it seems to be moving.

538
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:20,638
Get it out.

539
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:23,616
- I got it! I got it!
- Get it out!

540
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:25,757
Jesus!

541
00:46:27,815 --> 00:46:31,288
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes.

542
00:46:35,037 --> 00:46:36,870
Put this on it.

543
00:46:40,338 --> 00:46:42,980
It looks like one of my samples.

544
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:52,380
You said you felt something's
moving in your helmet.

545
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:57,928
I don't understand,
how did this get in...

546
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,060
Goddamn, you contaminated the entire ship.

547
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:10,926
Liberty, do you copy?

548
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,509
Houston, we hear you.

549
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:20,091
Liberty, do you copy?

550
00:47:20,126 --> 00:47:22,243
Dammit Houston, we hear you.

551
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,989
Liberty, do you receive?

552
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:30,403
They can't hear us.

553
00:47:30,404 --> 00:47:33,713
Liberty, do you hear?

554
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:53,238
Those PSD5's...

555
00:47:55,412 --> 00:47:57,930
...what if they're not there
to spy on the Russians?

556
00:47:57,965 --> 00:47:59,559
What do you mean?

557
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:05,605
They told us that the transmitters...

558
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:09,231
...pick up any frequency,
but they don't.

559
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:12,606
They're blocking our communication,
transmitting a signal.

560
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,916
Alright.

561
00:48:24,804 --> 00:48:26,826
And why would they do that?

562
00:48:26,827 --> 00:48:28,761
No, keep filming. Keep filming.

563
00:48:28,762 --> 00:48:30,581
We need to document this.

564
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,005
To attract the Soviets, made the tracks is

565
00:48:40,532 --> 00:48:42,820
...whatever killed the cosmonaut.

566
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:48,733
All these cameras, man...

567
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:54,987
...they're watching us.

568
00:48:56,006 --> 00:48:57,481
We are alone.

569
00:48:59,725 --> 00:49:01,553
We are guinea pigs.

570
00:49:03,914 --> 00:49:05,787
That's why they sent us here.

571
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:08,588
We have to turn off those
transmitters.

572
00:49:13,568 --> 00:49:15,662
PSD5's destroyed.

573
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,222
Brilliant.

574
00:49:24,103 --> 00:49:25,962
Nice tracks.

575
00:49:30,987 --> 00:49:32,817
They were here.

576
00:49:38,882 --> 00:49:40,822
Let's check on the other sides.

577
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:47,231
Liberty, do you copy?

578
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:51,520
Liberty, do you copy?

579
00:49:52,248 --> 00:49:55,414
Liberty, do you copy?

580
00:50:04,024 --> 00:50:05,875
Something's down here.

581
00:50:13,491 --> 00:50:15,589
It's gone.

582
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:19,741
Hey, what are you looking at?

583
00:50:22,426 --> 00:50:24,057
This was a bad idea.

584
00:50:24,058 --> 00:50:27,763
You need to get rest, Nate. OK?
We're get to back to lab.

585
00:50:28,522 --> 00:50:30,785
We need to get back, Nate.

586
00:50:39,618 --> 00:50:41,507
Oh, Jesus Christ, Nate.

587
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:45,561
It's in your blood stream.

588
00:50:47,898 --> 00:50:50,125
The previous wound seems to...

589
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:53,305
...become infected.

590
00:50:54,276 --> 00:50:56,974
Eyes are extremely bloodshot.

591
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,420
I do not know how to treat it.

592
00:51:10,864 --> 00:51:12,392
Houston, this is Freedom.

593
00:51:12,745 --> 00:51:15,262
I haven't be able to reach Nate or Ben.

594
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,907
Communication's still down with Liberty.

595
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:18,871
We have no communication
with the crew...

596
00:51:18,872 --> 00:51:21,378
...we're receiving data from the LEM.

597
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:24,589
We're trying to restore the
communication now. Standby.

598
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,476
Liberty, this is Houston.

599
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:30,968
Looks like you can hear us,
but we can't hear you.

600
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:35,741
Block the Westinghouse
and survival craft's getting land down.

601
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:38,913
We estimate 12 hours left
on your live support...

602
00:51:38,914 --> 00:51:41,170
...and we are now sorting out the
engine problems.

603
00:51:41,171 --> 00:51:44,122
We'll do everything we can
to get you home.

604
00:51:44,864 --> 00:51:47,319
... and we are now sorting out the
engine problems.

605
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:48,847
We'll do everything we can
to get you home.

606
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,647
They're lying.

607
00:51:57,598 --> 00:51:59,803
No, they'll get us back.

608
00:52:00,707 --> 00:52:05,122
Thay'll get us back.
They want that footage.

609
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:12,083
- What about the Russian ship?
- The poor Russian bastard.

610
00:52:14,538 --> 00:52:16,891
It looks infected.

611
00:52:16,892 --> 00:52:18,904
Just like me.

612
00:52:19,714 --> 00:52:21,545
I'm getting worse.

613
00:52:21,601 --> 00:52:24,906
Ben...

614
00:52:24,943 --> 00:52:28,548
- ...you must leave me here.
- No.

615
00:52:34,102 --> 00:52:36,902
- No one leaves anyone.
- You have to.

616
00:52:38,612 --> 00:52:40,623
Forget it. We won't die uphere.

617
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:45,737
Fate has renamed.

618
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:50,632
The men who went to the moon
to export peace...

619
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,251
...remained on the moon
to rest in peace.

620
00:52:54,512 --> 00:52:56,547
What the hell are you talking about?

621
00:52:56,583 --> 00:53:01,355
I feel my toughts...fragmenting.

622
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,958
I can be attracted to them.

623
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:13,980
I'm so tired.

624
00:53:22,538 --> 00:53:26,008
EMD
Six days, 22 hours, 23 minutes.

625
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,217
Alan B. Anderson. Doctorial

626
00:53:30,128 --> 00:53:33,123
There were no further
communication with Houston.

627
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:35,578
Oxygen levels are low.

628
00:53:38,478 --> 00:53:42,021
Nate's being sleep for about an hour.

629
00:53:43,277 --> 00:53:47,840
The sickness seems brougth fatigue.

630
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:53,722
We're not gonna make it here.

631
00:53:55,716 --> 00:53:59,081
If Houston doesn't come up with the
plans in the next couple hours, we'll..

632
00:54:01,684 --> 00:54:06,743
...we'll abandon Liberty and
go to the Russian LK.

633
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:09,767
Their communications and oxygen
are our only hope.

634
00:54:13,024 --> 00:54:16,219
Just pray to God.

635
00:54:28,228 --> 00:54:30,443
Jesus Christ!

636
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,484
Jesus!

637
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,835
Partial respiration.

638
00:54:49,178 --> 00:54:50,940
Upper left rib...

639
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:54,799
The infection's spreading.

640
00:54:56,231 --> 00:54:57,855
God damn it.

641
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:02,164
Must be the same thing that
happened to the Russian.

642
00:55:04,036 --> 00:55:08,009
- Nate!
- I don't let you kill me!

643
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,397
It's me. Listen to me. Look at me.
It's me. Ok?

644
00:55:10,398 --> 00:55:12,625
I'm just trying to help you.
You're getting worse.

645
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,859
Don't ever touch me!

646
00:57:00,313 --> 00:57:03,639
- Nate, please, what the hell are you doing?
- They are everywhere.

647
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,429
- Please, Nate, you'll kill us all!
- Stop watch us!

648
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,553
Nate!

649
00:57:10,696 --> 00:57:12,886
You're not gonna watch
how I die!

650
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,138
What are you doing? Stop!

651
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:21,401
Stop!

652
00:57:21,422 --> 00:57:22,639
Come on! You...

653
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,198
Stop there!

654
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:29,683
Stop that!

655
00:57:50,356 --> 00:57:53,670
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me?

656
00:57:58,276 --> 00:58:00,099
Liberty, this is Freedom.

657
00:58:02,106 --> 00:58:05,980
I don't know if you hear me, but
I'm gonna be in the comm range soon.

658
00:58:06,785 --> 00:58:09,989
Guys, we need to get you
out of there. There is...

659
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:12,333
Do you copy?

660
00:58:17,374 --> 00:58:20,668
Come on, guys,
Don't make me leave you here.

661
00:58:22,314 --> 00:58:24,509
Freedom, you read us?

662
00:58:27,613 --> 00:58:29,987
John...John, can you hear me?

663
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:32,759
Please, anyone...
can you hear me?

664
00:58:36,235 --> 00:58:38,125
We are leaving Liberty.

665
00:58:50,107 --> 00:58:53,372
- Come on.
- I had to do it.

666
00:58:56,763 --> 00:58:58,384
Take the camera.

667
00:58:58,385 --> 00:59:01,277
We have 25% of the tank.

668
00:59:01,813 --> 00:59:03,541
We can use some reserv.

669
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:05,523
We'll get there.

670
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:07,504
I get to get the films.

671
00:59:10,565 --> 00:59:13,299
Black box of the D.o.D

672
00:59:16,016 --> 00:59:18,631
I get to go down.
It's clear.

673
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:36,516
Come Nate, we go.

674
00:59:42,703 --> 00:59:46,437
They are everywhere.
You can't help me.

675
00:59:46,438 --> 00:59:48,480
You don't have to be here.

676
00:59:56,255 --> 00:59:58,229
That's OK.

677
01:00:00,114 --> 01:00:03,649
- It's gonna be OK.
- Alright. We're gonna make it.

678
01:00:10,394 --> 01:00:12,676
They're waiting for me.

679
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:15,634
We are not safe here.

680
01:00:20,902 --> 01:00:23,578
- Get rid of me.
- Hang in.

681
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:26,605
What the hell are you doing?
Hang on!

682
01:00:52,855 --> 01:00:55,538
Nate!

683
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:00,426
Nate!

684
01:01:00,596 --> 01:01:03,157
EMD
I don't know...

685
01:01:05,381 --> 01:01:07,519
Roover has been destroyed.

686
01:01:10,202 --> 01:01:12,745
There is no sign of Commander Walker.

687
01:01:27,618 --> 01:01:31,749
American astronaut,
Ben Anderson, Apollo 18.

688
01:01:39,282 --> 01:01:41,130
Oxygen is getting low.

689
01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:51,309
I'm...

690
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:54,096
I'm gonna search for the Russian later.

691
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:58,308
Hey, Commander Walker.

692
01:02:06,941 --> 01:02:09,126
Nate!

693
01:02:15,717 --> 01:02:19,553
Go away from here, Ben.
This is where they're coming from.

694
01:02:19,554 --> 01:02:22,274
There's nothing here, OK?
You get to come with me.

695
01:02:22,275 --> 01:02:24,739
God damn it! We need get moving.

696
01:02:25,646 --> 01:02:28,136
Ben, listen to me.

697
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:31,019
We're running out of time here,
please.

698
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:35,812
You must find the LK? Their system is
identical with ours. Save yourself.

699
01:02:36,923 --> 01:02:39,418
No, Nate! I'm not going.
You're coming with me.

700
01:02:39,419 --> 01:02:42,361
You have to leave me here.
Just get the John.

701
01:02:42,397 --> 01:02:45,304
- I'm not leaving here!
- You can't help me.

702
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,647
But you can save yourself...

703
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:48,513
Nate!

704
01:02:48,527 --> 01:02:50,211
Nate!

705
01:02:50,926 --> 01:02:52,616
Can you hear me?

706
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:55,572
Nate!

707
01:02:55,573 --> 01:02:56,857
Answer me!

708
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:01,911
Do you hear me?
Say something Nate.

709
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:12,168
Nate, where are you?

710
01:03:40,909 --> 01:03:42,663
No! No!

711
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:46,140
My god. No!

712
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:02,193
John, Nate is gone.
Repeat, Nate is gone.

713
01:04:04,122 --> 01:04:06,286
Please, can somebody hear me?

714
01:04:43,539 --> 01:04:45,878
Oh, my God!

715
01:04:47,982 --> 01:04:50,084
Nate!

716
01:04:56,353 --> 01:04:57,956
Come on!

717
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:06,328
Frequency is completed.

718
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:28,114
This is an American astronaut.

719
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,895
Ben Anderson, Apollo 18.

720
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:32,466
Been copy?

721
01:05:34,618 --> 01:05:37,952
This is Apollo 18. Do you copy?

722
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:46,137
Anyone, do you copy?

723
01:05:47,816 --> 01:05:50,638
Anyone, please. Do you copy?

724
01:05:53,767 --> 01:05:55,997
Anything, anybody, do you copy?

725
01:06:05,984 --> 01:06:07,757
Damn!

726
01:06:11,153 --> 01:06:14,166
Confirming Commander Walker.

727
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:16,843
- Acknowledge.
- This is Captain Ben Anderson...

728
01:06:16,844 --> 01:06:19,013
Do you copy?

729
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,595
This is Ben Anderson.
Copy, anybody?

730
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:28,062
Anybody, please! Do you read me?

731
01:06:32,003 --> 01:06:35,550
Captain Anderson, this is the
Deputy Secretary of Defense.

732
01:06:35,551 --> 01:06:37,059
What?

733
01:06:37,388 --> 01:06:39,267
D.o.D? Yes.

734
01:06:39,268 --> 01:06:41,795
Yes, this is Captain Ben Anderson.

735
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:46,419
We communicate with the Russians
and they're putting me through you.

736
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,678
We're aware of your condition that...

737
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,806
...and we have decided.

738
01:06:53,623 --> 01:06:57,119
- ...we can't you home.
- No. No, no!

739
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,429
Listen to me please.

740
01:06:59,675 --> 01:07:02,041
Nate get a cut on his body. He's infected.

741
01:07:02,077 --> 01:07:04,429
There's nothing on me. Please,
have to come and get me.

742
01:07:06,742 --> 01:07:10,100
We can't get you.
We can't get you.

743
01:07:10,742 --> 01:07:14,281
Please...

744
01:07:14,283 --> 01:07:19,007
Listen, I...I...got a family
and I need my family.

745
01:07:21,898 --> 01:07:25,198
We'll let your family know
you died a hero.

746
01:07:25,595 --> 01:07:27,358
I'm sorry Captain.

747
01:07:31,622 --> 01:07:35,274
You have to get me out of here!
And you fucking do it right now!

748
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:38,707
I will not give up
until you get me home!

749
01:07:47,966 --> 01:07:49,532
Houston, please.

750
01:07:50,474 --> 01:07:54,608
We'll stay in on this channel with you
but the decision is final.

751
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:59,360
You've done a great service for
your country, son.

752
01:08:14,896 --> 01:08:17,415
EMD...

753
01:08:18,472 --> 01:08:20,732
Still no communication.

754
01:08:23,068 --> 01:08:28,047
Astronaut Brian Anderson, with his dad,
flies through the space.

755
01:08:29,263 --> 01:08:32,522
- Brian, what are you doing?
- Just playing, mom.

756
01:08:32,523 --> 01:08:34,770
Do not play with the your dad's stuff.

757
01:08:34,771 --> 01:08:38,817
- Is that recording?
- Sorry, Dad, I love you.

758
01:08:41,794 --> 01:08:46,569
- Is that recording?
- Sorry, Dad, I love you.

759
01:08:47,365 --> 01:08:49,792
...love you.

760
01:08:50,374 --> 01:08:52,442
...Dad, I love you.

761
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,558
...love you.

762
01:09:12,274 --> 01:09:15,544
This is Freedom,
are you hearing me?

763
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:19,621
- This is Freedom...
- John, it's Ben. I hear you.

764
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,779
Ben, is that you?
Do you copy?

765
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:24,765
Yes, John, I am.
I hear you.

766
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:29,895
I got you on the VHF, partner.
Where the hell are you?

767
01:09:30,385 --> 01:09:34,377
- Soviet's LK.
- Yes. Good for you.

768
01:09:34,412 --> 01:09:37,263
They left me, John.
Left me here!

769
01:09:37,264 --> 01:09:39,170
Where is Nate? How's he?

770
01:09:40,953 --> 01:09:43,682
Get sick, he did not make it.

771
01:09:45,695 --> 01:09:47,904
There's something down here, John.

772
01:09:48,792 --> 01:09:52,968
And they knew about it. You hear me?
Those bastards knew about it!

773
01:09:53,964 --> 01:09:56,498
Forget about the D.o.D, man.

774
01:09:56,933 --> 01:09:58,886
Ben, I'm get you out of there, OK?

775
01:09:58,888 --> 01:10:01,915
Did you figure out that thing?

776
01:10:02,722 --> 01:10:04,664
I don't have much choice. Do we?

777
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:10,313
Powers look good.

778
01:10:10,314 --> 01:10:12,487
And there is plenty fuel.

779
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:14,723
Okay, buddy. You're gonna be
in the darkness yet...

780
01:10:14,759 --> 01:10:17,390
...you're gonna need to get your
synchronized orbit...

781
01:10:17,427 --> 01:10:20,141
...then you need a little space for.

782
01:10:20,657 --> 01:10:23,514
Safely on board.
How does that sound?

783
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,546
Sounds beautiful Johnny.

784
01:10:27,614 --> 01:10:29,302
Sound very beautiful.

785
01:10:32,263 --> 01:10:35,389
I don't mean rush you partner
but we're running out of time.

786
01:10:35,489 --> 01:10:37,316
Get that thing in the orbit.

787
01:10:37,353 --> 01:10:40,042
We can run into it.

788
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:44,868
I got it! I got it, John.

789
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:47,270
Seven. Six.

790
01:10:47,822 --> 01:10:49,350
Five.

791
01:10:50,321 --> 01:10:53,127
- Holy shit!
- Open this door.

792
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:56,067
Nate, you know I can't do that.
Please, you'll kill us both!

793
01:10:56,068 --> 01:10:58,085
I can't let you in.

794
01:10:58,086 --> 01:11:00,610
- I'm coming there.
- No, no!

795
01:11:00,611 --> 01:11:03,471
Nate, please!

796
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:05,469
- Nate, stop this Nate!
- What'd you mean? - It's Nate!

797
01:11:09,744 --> 01:11:11,908
- What is happening?
- Come on buddy! Stop!

798
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:14,565
Stop!

799
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:17,161
- What's going on?
- Don't do this! -What do you think?

800
01:11:19,716 --> 01:11:22,448
Jesus Christ! No!

801
01:11:23,501 --> 01:11:27,608
Nate!
Nate!

802
01:11:27,644 --> 01:11:31,385
Oh, my God!
Nate!

803
01:11:32,692 --> 01:11:34,475
No!

804
01:11:34,476 --> 01:11:37,702
No, no, no!

805
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:40,441
You can launch.
You must do it now.

806
01:11:40,442 --> 01:11:43,041
Our window is almost gone.
You have to launch.

807
01:11:43,601 --> 01:11:46,200
Dammit, they were kind of
too close.

808
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,927
We're going home!

809
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:54,946
Ben, listen to me now.

810
01:11:54,947 --> 01:11:56,907
We're going to go home.

811
01:11:57,253 --> 01:11:59,891
Heard that? We're going to go home.

812
01:12:02,249 --> 01:12:05,152
I'm going home.

813
01:12:12,038 --> 01:12:13,867
We lifted up!

814
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:15,912
Freedom, do you read?

815
01:12:16,409 --> 01:12:19,230
This is the Deputy Secretary of Defense.

816
01:12:19,231 --> 01:12:22,412
Ben has been contaminated.
Do not try to rescue him.

817
01:12:22,413 --> 01:12:24,949
I repeat. You will not recover him.

818
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,362
Contaminated by what?
D.o.D?

819
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:33,471
- What do you say? Where is Tommy?
- You will not recover Anderson.

820
01:12:33,507 --> 01:12:35,015
This a direct order.

821
01:12:40,182 --> 01:12:41,772
I'm on my way.

822
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,628
John, you're abording the rescue
immediately.

823
01:12:50,665 --> 01:12:54,419
Captain Anderson has been
contaminated.

824
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:57,604
You knew something was down there
and you sent them anyway!

825
01:12:58,059 --> 01:12:59,828
I'm coming home.

826
01:13:00,632 --> 01:13:03,945
I'm coming home.

827
01:13:04,434 --> 01:13:06,172
D.o.D to Freedom

828
01:13:06,209 --> 01:13:08,675
If you're not abording in 60 seconds...

829
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:11,318
...transmittion will be terminated.

830
01:13:11,419 --> 01:13:13,928
You'll not receive updated statement.

831
01:13:13,965 --> 01:13:17,429
You'll run out of life support craft
and you'll not return home.

832
01:13:19,446 --> 01:13:23,260
You have 45 seconds
to abort the rescue.

833
01:13:24,408 --> 01:13:28,381
John, we have no choice.
We're begging you. Do not rescue!

834
01:13:28,382 --> 01:13:30,064
God damn it, Ben!

835
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:34,136
We're going home.

836
01:13:39,452 --> 01:13:42,461
I'm in the orbit.

837
01:13:57,361 --> 01:13:59,564
Ben!

838
01:14:01,223 --> 01:14:03,708
They tricked me.
John, get out of here.

839
01:14:06,236 --> 01:14:08,514
Ben, you're coming in too fast!

840
01:14:10,008 --> 01:14:12,179
Ben, your impact, slow it down!

841
01:14:15,405 --> 01:14:18,158
Ben!

842
01:14:18,396 --> 01:14:20,058
Ben!

843
01:14:21,117 --> 01:14:23,664
Ben!

844
01:14:36,064 --> 01:14:40,805
According to all official reports
Apollo 17 was the final mission.

845
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:50,914
Official Report
LI. Colonel John Grey...

846
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:53,961
...was kiiled in a crash during a
training mission over Tallahassee. FL.

847
01:14:53,962 --> 01:14:57,676
His body was never recovered.

848
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:05,674
Official Report
Cmdr. Nathan Walker's F-14 crashed into...

849
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:08,352
...the Pacific Ocean near Kadena Air
Force Base.

850
01:15:08,386 --> 01:15:10,694
His body was never recovered.

851
01:15:20,696 --> 01:15:23,221
Official Report
Cpt. Benjamin Anderson was killed...

852
01:15:23,257 --> 01:15:26,156
...was killed during a mid-air evacuation
over the East China Sea.

853
01:15:26,157 --> 01:15:29,392
His body was never recovered.

854
01:15:29,393 --> 01:15:34,005
We chose to go to the moon
in this decade and do the other things.

855
01:15:34,006 --> 01:15:37,852
Not because they are easy,
but because they're hard.

856
01:15:37,853 --> 01:15:43,678
Apollo Missions brought 378 kg Moon Rock
Samples To Earth.

857
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:48,199
Hundreds Were Given Away To
Dignitaries of Foreign Countries

858
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:53,158
Many of These "Gifts" Were Stolen
or Are Now Missing

859
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:59,297
The voyages of Apollo
dramatized the risks.

860
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:03,637
The men of Apollo identify
the character...

861
01:16:03,673 --> 01:16:08,438
...that accept the danger
and surmounted.

862
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:14,018
There is the spirit that
built America.
