00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,320
guys

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,900
guys

4
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,999
[Music]

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
okay hey steve steve

6
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,840
[ __ ] mother okay

7
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
this is uh day one morning

8
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,160
equipment check equipment check tape one

9
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,760
steve monterey biologist with the

10
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,599
washington state parks department

11
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
video record of new dear migratory

12
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,280
patterns due to over development

13
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
this is a video diary to visually

14
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,360
document my findings

15
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,520
i believe that the recent increase in

16
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,640
predators that we've seen in the

17
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
outlying rural areas is due to a

18
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,879
relatively new change in the migratory

19
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,560
patterns of the prey animals

20
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
deer and elk i'll follow the traditional

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
trails of the uh colombian black-tailed

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
deer through the cascades and

23
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,360
mark here the environment wish me luck

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,599
wes are you ready uh nope

25
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,120
we're scheduled to leave in 10 minutes

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,680
we have to hit that first valley tonight

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,959
talking about it's not going to make it

28
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,680
go any quicker

29
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,200
hey throw the tags on the logs i don't

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,080
know wherever you

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,480
put them

32
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,080
so this is dr steven monterey i've

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,800
exited i-90 around roughly north bend

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
i'll have to continue on foot from here

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
but i expect to follow the

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
exact migration trail of the

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
black-tailed deer

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
if you look through the trees here you

39
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,920
can see there are

40
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,480
multiple houses in the area that's to be

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,560
expected

42
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
so i have found deerskat and vegetation

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,280
that's been chewed on

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,959
of course this is just the outside areas

45
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,120
of the uh developments but

46
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,640
i expect to find more evidence as i

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,319
progress

48
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,480
what the [ __ ] do you mean i you're only

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,680

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,040
not even here

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,280

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,720
[Applause]

53
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,840

55
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,959

yeah thank you

58
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,399
we've hiked approximately 15 miles along

59
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,358
the easternly heading

60
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,240
increased amounts of predator sign of

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,320
which we've seen a lot

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,639
damn it damn it wes would you stop that

63
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,720
and help me

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
okay we should have more to report

65
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
tomorrow

66
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,639
stop that you're wasting the battery

67
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,080
come on man just a sec i need to see

68
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,520
what kind of low-light visibility this

69
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,080
thing has

70
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
and you didn't test that before we left

71
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,440
i didn't feel tested if that's what you

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,320
mean

73
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
come on move around or do something

74
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
seriously man i need to see what kind of

75
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
how this thing works in low light

76
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,680
situations dude okay killing me steve

77
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,360
this ain't no damn reality tv show i

78
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
don't wanna be on that camera more than

79
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,000
necessary

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,800
okay fine um so this is

81
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,039
this is camp night one um

82
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,919
night visibility test one so here we see

83
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,759
the campfire

84
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,039
great so that's basically

85
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,280
outside edge of the human eyes vision

86
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,600
sense

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,520
okay so

88
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,800
there it is all right that's the end of

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,360
uh

90
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,639
night vision field test one

91
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,199
i'm just saying budget cuts and layoffs

92
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,800
are gonna happen you know that's why we

93
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
have to distinguish ourselves

94
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,479
you know with something published i mean

95
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
at least separate ourselves from

96
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,199
everyone else is not doing field

97
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,199
research

98
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,039
and uh how much field research have you

99
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,039
actually done

100
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,919
i don't know i mean i i mean obviously

101
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,600
if you want to include my undergrad you

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:53,840
know

103
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,639
then grad school oh you know i also did

104
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,360
some field reason

105
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,840
we should probably get some sleep

106
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
so this is the start of day two we

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,440
haven't found nearly as many signs of

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
deer as we'd hoped

109
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,039
what's even more strange is that not

110
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,720
only we not found any signs of deer we

111
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,160
really haven't found any signs of any

112
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,400
large mammals in the area

113
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
it looks like a game show look at rock

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,759
slide

115
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,560
those colors for

116
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,039
looks like it's been here for a little

117
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,680
while yeah i'd say at least a week maybe

118
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
two well at least that proves that

119
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,120
there's

120
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,840
some type of large predator in the area

121
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,960
well it's something

122
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,520
okay you see the way its neck is twisted

123
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
like that his head is almost backwards

124
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
and why would a large predator leave so

125
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,960
much of the carcass behind

126
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,160
that's true tainted mate maybe bad from

127
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,120
the start

128
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,479
yeah it's funny yeah i don't know it's

129
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,639
and it's the only thing we've seen what

130
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,880
could survive out here eating

131
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,640
one goat especially

132
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,829
[Music]

133
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
okay it's the end of day two we decided

134
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,319
to set up camp next to this lake here

135
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,599
i've been putting the coordinates into

136
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,440
the gps

137
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
we haven't seen any signs of large

138
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
mammals in at least the last

139
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:31,199
eight hours or so of hiking who's that

140
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,759
who is that

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,560
weird i didn't think anybody was up here

142
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,199
this time of year

143
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
anyway uh that's the first anything

144
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,319
we've

145
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,680
really seen today hopefully we'll find

146
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
more tomorrow

147
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,240
this appears to be some sort of juvenile

148
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,039
mammal

149
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,039
we're gonna take some hair samples back

150
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,840
for analysis

151
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
good job wes

152
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,160
this camera seems to turn the sound too

153
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
did you hear that it's like the whole

154
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,599
world got silent at once

155
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,520
yeah it's it's weird it's like

156
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,479
everything was

157
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,000
hiding from something yeah

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,840
that was weird

159
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,080
okay well this is the end of day two on

160
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,599
our video um we've entered in all the

161
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,279
gps coordinates

162
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,880
and we're both hopeful that tomorrow

163
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,399
will bring uh better results

164
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,320
is it awesome yeah good make sure you

165
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,640
get

166
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,680
all of this a few minutes ago heard some

167
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,200
strange noises in the heels

168
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,600
and then a total silence um

169
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,640
but now you can hear it faintly listen

170
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,880
there it is again goddammit listen

171
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
this could be the reason for a lack of

172
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
deer overpopulation of wolves now i

173
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,680
don't know how many wolves that sound

174
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,720
like that

175
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,040
man what the [ __ ] else could it be i

176
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,839
don't i don't know

177
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,519
look either way we should break out the

178
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,279
bear mates and take watch

179
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,880
i mean if if that's the reason the deer

180
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,560
population is down i don't see why that

181
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,080
wolf or whatever the hell is out there

182
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,399
wouldn't go for a bite of human

183
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,519
and i'm gonna take the first watch i

184
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,640
can't sleep

185
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,839
yeah i can't either

186
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,399
12 15 exactly and we're still hearing

187
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,480
them noises

188
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,519
and it sounded like it's getting closer

189
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,240
oh man

190
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,120
man it's about that time to get going

191

two one university campus officials were

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,839
stunned today when the washington state

244
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,920
patrol changed the investigation of

245
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,320
eight missing students from missing

246
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
persons investigation to a

247
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,040
murder investigation a spokesperson for

248
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,959
the washington state patrol stated that

249
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,839
in light of new

250
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,320
evidence found at what is now considered

251
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,440
the crime scene

252
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,760
all of the missing students are presumed

253
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,160
dead this goes along with the caretaker

254
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,079
as well as the washington state park

255
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:56,800
ranger

256
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,959
now the spokesperson could not confirm

257
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,880
nor deny any leads that they have at

258
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,839
this moment

259
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,360
the story broke when friends of the

260
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,839
victims visited their social networking

261
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,240
pages and found disturbing video

262
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
and pictures of what could only be

263
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,720
described as the victim's last moments

264
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,839
from there it was brought to the

265
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,760
attention of the state patrol

266
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,160
and the search began now this is just

267
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,320
one of many missing person stories that

268
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
has plagued this part of the cascade

269
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,040
mountains

270
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
a long history of disappearances has

271
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,279
earned this section of the mountain pass

272
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:35,839

don't worry we'll be back in a second we

567
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,840
better be

568
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,559
all right so here's the story

569
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
so josh and i are coming back from this

570
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,559
college visitation back in high school

571
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,000
and we're coming through the past down

572
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,720
on i-90 and he's got this piece of crap

573
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,399
car that starts making all these crazy

574
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,120
noises

575
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,720
it's a japanese car i mean come on what

576
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,480
do you guys expect yeah it's horrible

577
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,399
so anyway it starts making these crazy

578
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,240
noises but we don't want to stop because

579
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,559
neither of us knows anything about cars

580
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,559
so we just keep going but it gets worse

581
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,840
and worse so finally

582
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,679
we start to pull over on this off ramp

583
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,039
and sure enough it dies

584
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,200
and we can't get it started so we're

585
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,279
caught out in the middle of nowhere

586
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,520
actually that was really close to here

587
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,840
yeah i was only like a mile down the

588
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,000
road

589
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,480
anyway it's pitch black we have no cell

590
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,679
phone reception

591
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,679
so we gotta walk so we start walking

592
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,799
down the road trying to find a gas

593
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,080
station or something

594
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,360
we go about 10 minutes and then all of a

595
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,000
sudden

596
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,760
both of us at the same time feel this

597
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,200
really creepy

598
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,080
feeling like the like cold fingers on

599
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,279
the back of our necks

600
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,520
creepy right same time so we look at

601
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,480
each other we start

602
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,640
moving faster finally we see some lights

603
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,480
down the road for this gas station so we

604
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
pretty much sprint the rest of the way

605
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,919
to get to a phone wait what was that

606
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,559

607
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,399
anyway so we get to the gas station

608
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,679
oh this is the good part we get to the

609
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,520

658
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,000
be more subtle

fiction

791
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,520

mountains actually

796
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,599
stories of some incomprehensible

797
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,800
presence

798
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,839
no glimpse out of the corner your eye

799
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,359
a glint or a glare darkness

800
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,200
unsettling stories from these hills and

801
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
these roads

802
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,280
there's an indian legend it's hundreds

803
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,480
of years old that

804
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,839
speaks about this mountains it's a

805
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,920
universal theme amongst

806
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,839
all the tribes of the west coast

807
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,000
anyway tell the

808
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,240
ancient spirit that comes down from the

809
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,359
mountain every 30 years or so

810
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,440
and some energy around here that draws

811
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,839
them

812
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,400
i don't know if the stories are monsters

813
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,720
the darker tree but

814
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,079
now this area the cascades is reported

815
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,160
more disappearances

816
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,760
in the last 100 years anywhere else

817
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,640
you know add to that the native legends

818
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,520
of evil

819
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,960
and and and the total absence of

820
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,880
native tribes around here and there's

821
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,839
got to be some truth to that myth

822
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,000
so if you walk around at night stay

823
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,079
close to the light

824
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,440
because you never know where the

825
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,079
darkness may come from

826
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,760

1128
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,559
evil for the cave you know with all the

1129
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,480
religious overtones and the drawings i

1130
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:16,880
thought

1131
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,480
you know it was a religious sign but now

1132
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,680
i think it was a war against the evil

1133
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,559
in the cave

1134
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,200
something about an unstoppable evil

1135
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,480
coming from the earth

1136
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,520
every 360 moons or so
