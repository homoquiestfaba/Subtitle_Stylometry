00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:48,537
Budapest.

3
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,873
The next stop's Budapest.

4
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,875
Budapest is the next stop.

5
00:00:52,877 --> 00:00:54,876
Budapest.

6
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:56,579
Tickets, ladies.

7
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:58,448
Oop, here you go.

8
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,982
- Here's mine.
- And mine.

9
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:01,653
- Mine, too!
- Here you go!

10
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,290
Thank you, young man.

11
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:09,025
Man, I hate wearing disguises.

12
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,660
These heels are killing me.

13
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:12,996
Okay, take it down a notch.

14
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:14,630
We don't want to alarm
the humans.

15
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:18,368
Psst. Drac.

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,836
I'm about to <i>und</i> freak out!

17
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:22,674
You're a nice kitty.

18
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:25,308
I'm <i>und</i> kitty-cat.

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,246
Meow. Meow!

20
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:36,485
Oh, no,
not this clown again.

21
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:38,888
Good evening, travelers.

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,457
I am Professor
Abraham Van Helsing.

23
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:45,627
Yes. One of the Van Helsings.

24
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,032
For centuries, my family
has protected humanity

25
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:51,600
from the evils of monsters.

26
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,869
So you can believe me
when I tell you,

27
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:56,639
there are monsters
hiding amongst you!

28
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:59,675
But fear not,

29
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:03,513
for I am a professional,
and I know how to flush out

30
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:07,517
these beasts
and bring them into the light!

31
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,018
Fire bad!

32
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:35,980
Whoa!

33
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:42,885
Sorry, guys.

34
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:56,999
Finally! First I kill Dracula,

35
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,001
and then
the rest of the monsters!

36
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:01,838
Why do you keep doing this?

37
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,774
Your dad, your grandfather,
your great-great-granny...

38
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:06,743
I defeated them all.

39
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:10,412
When will you Van Helsings ever
learn to let go of the hate?

40
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:14,116
Never! Because you,
monster, are a...

41
00:03:14,118 --> 00:03:15,952
Eh, squeak, squeak.

42
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,487
What? A mouse?

43
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,788
Ahhh!

44
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,059
You can't run from me,
Prince of Darkness!

45
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:25,862
I will hunt you
for all eternity!

46
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:32,702
I swear I will never rest until
I destroy you...

47
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:33,803
And...

48
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:35,004
Every...

49
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,172
Other...

50
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,607
Monster... Ow!

51
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,174
If it's the last thing...

52
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,510
I...

53
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,511
Ever...

54
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,814
Do!

55
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:48,817
Boy, that guy is annoying.

56
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,919
Maybe one day
there will be a place

57
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,722
where monsters can go
to get away from it all,

58
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:55,124
take a vacation.

59
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:57,859
Who knows,
maybe even get married.

60
00:03:57,861 --> 00:03:59,497
Wouldn't that be something?

61
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,803
Hmm?

62
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,041
It's okay.

63
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:48,144
Oh, when is
this thing starting?

64
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:50,613
Aw, you made them cry,
Wayne.

65
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:53,182
All except this little one.
Coochie-coochie...

66
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:55,218
That's Sunny.
She doesn't cry.

67
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:58,488
She bites.

68
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,057
This is a very special moment, Carl.

69
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:06,465
Any second, your beautiful bride is
going to walk right down the aisle.

70
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:10,265
Oh, no, Drac,
she's not coming.

71
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,034
Oh, don't worry.

72
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:16,706
Mavis is with her. I'm sure
everything is under control.

73
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,242
Mavey, is everything
under control?

74
00:05:19,244 --> 00:05:22,010
Um, yep, just a slight case
of pre-wedding jitters.

75
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:26,717
Ahhh!

76
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:34,690
Yep, everything is
fine here.

77
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,894
Please try to relax, Lucy.

78
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:39,795
I've taken care
of everything.

79
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,731
The wedding
is going to be perfect.

80
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,132
It's not that.

81
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:47,235
Just, how do I know
I'm doing the right thing?

82
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:52,074
I know just how you feel.

83
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:55,277
The day I married Johnny was
the best day of my life,

84
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,079
but I was so nervous.

85
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:58,981
Not as nervous
as I was.

86
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,784
And you should have seen my dad.
He was a mess.

87
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:04,620
I wouldn't get out
of my coffin that night.

88
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:06,622
But he knew
it was meant to be.

89
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,757
It doesn't matter
where you come from

90
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,325
or how different
you are.

91
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:12,961
A Zing only happens
once in your life,

92
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:14,596
and you have to
cherish it.

93
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,935
Aw.

94
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:21,002
You're right! Thank you!

95
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:23,139
Okay.
All right. Okay.

96
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:25,043
Oh. Uh... Okay.

97
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:29,745
I do.

98
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:32,914
I do.

99
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,356
Do you hear that?

100
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,824
Yes. I thought we
locked him in his room.

101
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:42,992
We did!

102
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:45,161
Whoa! Whoa!

103
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:46,762
Hi, Mom. Hi, Papa.

104
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,063
- Dennis!
- Dennis!

105
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:49,966
Tinkles was crying,
so we let him out.

106
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:55,841
Ahhh!

107
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:01,112
Tinkles, sit!

108
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:11,187
Ah. Whose idea was it
to let Dennis have a puppy?

109
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:14,089
Um... Yours?

110
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:16,628
Right.

111
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:19,027
Poor Tinkles.

112
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:21,096
Dennis...

113
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:23,733
Look, honey,
I know you love Tinkles,

114
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,700
but we're not allowed
to bring our dogs...

115
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:28,803
Uh... I mean, our pets everywhere.

116
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:29,805
Okay?

117
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:31,173
Okay.

Ooh! Watch out now.

129
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:06,442
She got stitches
in all the right places.

130
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,779
Okay, there's no way that
is related to you, Frank.

131
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,447
No, she's
my right arm's cousin.

132
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:14,784
Ay! Oh!

133
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,286
- Oh!
- Ah! I see it now.

134
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,355
Frank wanted me to meet you.

135
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:22,894
We're arm cousins,
twice removed.

136
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:25,827
Of course.

137
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:29,432
I'd recognize that bicep
anywhere.

138
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:32,133
He thought, since we're both
single, we might hit it off,

139
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,435
maybe go on a date?

140
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:35,070
"Date"? Oh!

141
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,408
Well, eh,
it's just that, eh...

142
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,977
Whoa!

143
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,013
The DJ booth
is a sacred space!

144
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,049
I love this song!

145
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:50,486
Don't you?

146
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,887
Dracula?

147
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,823
Oh, where'd he go?

148
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,757
Dracula?

149
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:00,963
What's the matter, Drac,
you didn't like her?

150
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:03,199
No offense, but you
can't be too picky.

151
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,233
You haven't had a date
in 100 years.

152
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:09,805
Look, guys, I appreciate your
concern, but it's not up to me.

153
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:13,074
You only Zing once,
and I did.

154
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:15,009
Times have changed, buddy.

155
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:17,445
You can even find someone to
Zing with on your phone now.

156
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:19,248
What? Really?

157
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,882
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

158
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:22,852
I'm far too busy.

159
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:26,756
I have Mavis and Dennis and the
hotel, and bleh, bleh-bleh.

160
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:29,023
Um, did you guys
hear that?

161
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,026
He actually said,
"Bleh, bleh-bleh."

162
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,098
I don't say,
"Bleh, bleh-bleh"!

163
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:44,339
Eh, uh,
I'm looking for a Zing.

164
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:47,243
<i>Okay. Changing phone ring.</i>

165
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:51,079
No, no.
I'm looking for a date.

166
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,849
No, no, no.

167
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:56,919
I want to meet someone.

168
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,824
Are you kidding me right now?

169
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:04,959
Don't you get it?
I want to go on a date!

170
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:07,496
I'm lonely.

171
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,100
<i>You want baloney.</i>

172
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,842
What? Look at
that hair. Come on.

173
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:21,443
Ah. Too many eyes.

174
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:23,179
Too few eyes.

175
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:24,914
Not into tentacles.

176
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,147
"Match found"?

177
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:27,983
No, no, no!

178
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:29,318
<i>First things first.</i>

179
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,386
Whoa!

180
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:32,320
<i>I'm not into games.</i>

181
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:34,290
<i>You'd better have a job,
and my cats have to like you.</i>

182
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:38,026
Oh, no.

183
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:39,895
Oh, whoa, no.

184
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:40,896
Dad?

185
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,230
Oh! Mavis! Oh.

186
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:44,333
Uh, what are you doing here?

187
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:47,169
I was just checking on the honeymoon
suite, and I heard something.

188
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:49,271
Oh, I'm sorry,
my little bedbug.

189
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,440
I was just cleaning
the attic.

190
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,080
It's so dirty, ah, yes...

191
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:01,182
- <i>Who is that?</i>
- <i>Are you on the phone?</i>

192
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:06,222
What, this? I was just
trying to find a maid

193
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:08,590
- to help me with the mess.
- <i>A maid?</i>

194
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:10,092
<i>Who do you think...</i>

195
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:11,093
Thank you,
I'll check your references

196
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,864
and get back to you. Goodbye!

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,099
Dad.

198
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:19,901
Stop trying to
hide it from me.

199
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:22,238
Hide? Who?
I mean, what? Me?

200
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,372
Yes.

201
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:25,340
And I know what it is.

202
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:27,243
Uh... Really?

203
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:29,978
You're stressed out
from working too hard.

204
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,280
Oh!

205
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:32,513
Okay, yes.

206
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:34,049
You got me.

207
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:36,185
It's a big hotel,
you know?

208
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:37,920
Can't get to everything.

209
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:39,054
But what about you?

210
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,055
You're pretty busy yourself.

211
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:44,359
I know. It seems like now that
we're working together more,

212
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:46,929
we're seeing
each other less.

213
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:49,230
Ah. Yeah.
You're absolutely right.

214
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:52,166
I am working too much,
you're working too much.

215
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:55,271
We should really take a break,
starting right now.

216
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:56,441
Night-night.

217
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,411
<i>I'm still here!</i>

218
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,193
Aw.

219
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:20,296
Oh! Hey, honey.

220
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:22,397
You ready for

221
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,166
date night?

222
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,434
Aw.

223
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:26,634
That's okay, sweetheart.

224
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:28,103
You rest.

225
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,175
You know, Dad's right.

226
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:34,977
We need a break.

227
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:38,046
We need to all be together
again, like a family.

228
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,317
Like we used to.

229
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:45,087
<i>Are you
overworked and stressed out?</i>

230
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,289
<i>Do you need some family time?</i>

231
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,391
<i>Are you a monster?</i>

232
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,694
<i>Then you need a vacation,</i>

233
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:54,028
<i>a monster vacation.</i>

234
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,034
<i>♪ Sail away, sail away,
sail away ♪</i>

235
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:01,469
Welcome aboard
Gremlin Air.

236
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:08,710
Ah!

237
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:20,388
Ladies and gentlemen,

238
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,757
please direct your attention
to the front of the cabin.

239
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,227
For your safety, please
unbuckle your seat belts.

240
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:26,695
Ooh.

241
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:32,267
In the likely event we experience
a sudden drop in cabin pressure,

242
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,971
oxygen will be provided.

243
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,272
Can I stow that
for you, sir?

244
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:39,476
All right. Thanks.

245
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:44,012
Beverages. Snacks. Beverages.

246
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:45,748
Beverages. Snacks.

247
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,181
Beverages.

248
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:52,621
Ahhh!

249
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,723
- Coffee?
- That would be lovely.

250
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:03,732
Mavis, please,
you're torturing me.

251
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:06,068
You know I hate surprises.

252
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,403
This is
a fun surprise.

253
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:10,472
There are no fun surprises.

254
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,306
Just tell me
where we're going.

255
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:13,776
Why are we on a plane?

256
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:15,676
We can fly, you know.

257
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:18,280
Back in my day,
people took trains.

258
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:19,714
Now, that's classy.

259
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:22,751
Sure, Dad. Forty hours
in a closet-sized room

260
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:25,653
with you and Uncle Bernie
and his smelly cigars,

261
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,623
arguing who was
more attractive,

262
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,391
Cleopatra or Nefertiti.

263
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:31,426
Nefertiti.

264
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,161
Okay, Dad, thank you.

265
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:36,330
Mavis, this is
such an amazing surprise!

266
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:40,201
I can't wait to spend time
with the people I love most.

267
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:44,272
But I beg of you,
tell me where we're going!

268
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:48,109
Nope. I've taken care of everything,
so you don't need to worry.

269
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:49,677
You've been
so stressed out lately.

270
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,049
It's time for you to relax.

271
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,857
Now, isn't that better?

272
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,358
Oh, yes.

273
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,696
So relaxed.

274
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,132
I'm gonna go check
on you-know-who.

275
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:11,733
I'll be right back.

276
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:14,103
I have to go to the bathroom.

277
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:15,337
Hey, did you see that?

278
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:16,872
Dennis went to the bathroom!

279
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,710
Uh... Okay.

280
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,448
Psst. Hey, where are you?

281
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:31,353
There you are, Tinkles.

282
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:34,723
Don't worry, we'd never
leave you home alone.

283
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,858
<i>Okay, folks,
you're free to move</i>

284
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,258
about the cabin, as we have

285
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,596
started our descent.

286
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:56,478
So, any big plans
for the weekend there, Bill?

287
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,845
Oh, you know,
the usual.

288
00:15:57,847 --> 00:15:59,647
Got to take the kids
to soccer.

289
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:05,320
Snacks. Beverages.

290
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:07,658
Snacks. Beverages. Snacks.

291
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:22,938
Ladies and gentlemen, we've
arrived at our destination,

292
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,542
the Bermuda Triangle.

293
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,656
Ooh!

294
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:17,292
Welcome to
the Bermuda Triangle,

295
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:21,299
where you'll embark on a
monster cruise of a lifetime.

296
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:26,867
A cruise?

297
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,737
Surprise!

298
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:30,372
Oh, no, you... No.

299
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:34,776
But it's just like a hotel
on the water.

300
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:36,944
I just figured
you need a vacation

301
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:39,448
from running
everyone else's vacation.

302
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,284
You've barely been
out of the hotel since...

303
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:45,353
Well, since Mom died.

304
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,488
But this is a chance
to make new memories,

305
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,789
with all of us.

306
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,992
With Dennis.

307
00:17:50,994 --> 00:17:56,466
- Boat!
- Boat!

308
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:02,871
Who made you
such an amazing daughter?

309
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,038
You.

310
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,539
That's right!

311
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,508
What a father I am.

312
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,978
Come on, Denisovich,
let's get cruising!

313
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,348
Yay!

314
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:33,403
Wow!

315
00:18:57,894 --> 00:19:01,028
Okay. Smile.

316
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,564
Thank you.

317
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,010
Ow!

318
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:15,847
"No pets allowed"?

319
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:17,815
Uh-oh.

320
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:28,659
Perfect.

321
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,597
Welcome aboard.
How are you doing?

322
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,998
- Dennis, come on.
- Nice to see you.

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,534
Oh, lovely shirt. Yes.

324
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:42,340
Oh, hello.
Welcome aboard.

325
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:52,080
Uh, this is Bob.

326
00:19:52,082 --> 00:19:53,681
Say hi, Bob.

327
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:54,851
"Hi, Bob."

328
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,860
Oh, my gosh, Griffin.

329
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:06,694
I'm, like, so excited.

330
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:08,963
This is, like, the nicest
hotel I've ever been to.

331
00:20:08,965 --> 00:20:10,565
Yeah!

332
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,167
Man, this is amazing!

333
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,768
There's so much to do!

334
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,772
Olympic-size swimming pool...

335
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,609
<i>All-you-can-eat buffet...</i>

336
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:24,645
<i>Full-service spa...</i>

337
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:27,481
Whoo! I'm gonna get me
a seaweed rewrap!

338
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:30,485
Wow, it sounds like
everything we can do

339
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:31,952
at our hotel!

340
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:34,655
Except on the water!

341
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,737
Ooh! Ah!

342
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:50,671
Wow!

343
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:51,840
You nailed it, honey.

344
00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:54,074
Your dad is going to
love this!

345
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:56,010
Best summer vacation ever!

346
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:57,912
Wait till you see
the itinerary.

347
00:20:57,914 --> 00:20:59,480
Oh!

348
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:00,849
That's nice.

349
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:03,617
Frank, "fire bad." Remember?

350
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:06,220
Oh, yeah, right, but,
uh, maybe you'll find

351
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:08,789
your own fireworks
on the cruise, huh?

352
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,859
It's not the Love Boat, Frank.

353
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:13,865
I'm just here to have fun
with my family.

354
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:18,735
Huh?

355
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:21,870
Ha!

356
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:22,970
Ahoy there!

357
00:21:22,972 --> 00:21:24,538
Welcome aboard!

358
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:34,718
Whoa! Who is that?

359
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,623
I am Captain Ericka.

360
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,492
And, yes, I'm human. But
don't hold that against me.

361
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:47,562
I could not be more excited
to have all of you on board

362
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:50,097
our first-ever
monster cruise!

363
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,741
Whoo-hoo!

364
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:00,909
Dad? Are you okay?

365
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:03,245
Eeny feeny fanny
foonyah wah wah?

366
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:05,279
Oh, no! He's having
a heart attack!

367
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:07,248
Drac? Not likely.

368
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,683
Yeah, the only heart attack that can
hurt him is with a wooden stake.

369
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:10,818
It must be a stroke!

370
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,821
Actually, I think
it might be her.

371
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:15,789
Ow! Watch where you're pointing,
mister, I'm right here.

372
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,625
You always stand
so close to me.

373
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,561
It's creepy.

374
00:22:19,563 --> 00:22:22,730
For so long, monsters were
hiding, living in the shadows,

375
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,699
but not anymore!

376
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:28,702
You've stood up and waved
your hand or claw or tentacle

377
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:33,674
and said, "We're here, we're hairy,
and it is our right to be scary!"

378
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:39,113
Now it's time to celebrate!

379
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:42,217
You'll enjoy gourmet dining,
thrilling adventures,

380
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:43,985
and nonstop entertainment,

381
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,087
all on the way
to our final destination,

382
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:50,190
the lost city
that isn't lost anymore,

383
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:52,861
Atlantis!

384
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,667
Oh, yeah!

385
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,067
Whoo-hoo!

386
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:02,304
Whoa!
The fish are acrobats!

387
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:04,139
They're fishcrobats!

388
00:23:07,243 --> 00:23:09,710
Hello. How y'all doing?

389
00:23:09,712 --> 00:23:11,912
So...

390
00:23:11,914 --> 00:23:15,286
You must be
the one and only Dracula.

391
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:20,721
I have waited so long
to meet you.

392
00:23:20,723 --> 00:23:22,856
Wow, you really don't age,
do you?

393
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:24,292
I would kill
for your skin.

394
00:23:24,294 --> 00:23:27,696
Eh doobeeday
shoolah eh koobeeday?

395
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,631
Oh. You're speaking
Transylvanian.

396
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:31,065
Oh. Always wanted
to learn.

397
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,934
Uh, eh doobeeday
shoolah koobeeday?

398
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:36,071
- Eh koobeeday.
- Koobeeday.

399
00:23:36,073 --> 00:23:37,939
- Eh koobeeday.
- Koobeeday.

400
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:39,975
Eh doobeeday
shoolah koobeeday.

401
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:42,744
Doolah-day shoolah koobeeday.

402
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:44,979
Oh, such a romantic language.

403
00:23:44,981 --> 00:23:46,914
You know, there's just
something about an accent

404
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:50,317
that makes a man
sound so intelligent.

405
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,885
Alibooboo.

406
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:53,622
That's Transylvanian
right there.

407
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:55,724
He's saying
it's nice to meet you.

408
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:59,393
Well, then
"alibooboo" to you as well.

409
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:02,930
- Alibooboo. Alibooboo.
- Drac! Drac, snap out of it.

410
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:04,865
Wait. I've always wanted
to do this.

411
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:06,934
Wake up! Wake up, Drac!

412
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:08,202
Snap out of it!

413
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:09,703
Hey, cut it out!

00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:11,006
Hey, buddy, you okay?

415
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,674
No, not okay.

I'm still not sure
I understand.

443
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:33,480

Fish.

445
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,183
That's right.

446
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:38,353

00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:40,220

Oh, well. That's better
than nothing.

453
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:57,741
Oh. Oh!

454
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:05,212
So...

455
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:06,847
What do we do now?

456
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:11,221
I think we do
whatever we want.

457
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,421
"Whatever we want"?

458
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:16,490
Whatever we want.

459
00:27:16,492 --> 00:27:17,892
Whatever we want.

460
00:27:17,894 --> 00:27:19,227
Whatever we want!

461
00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:23,131
Whatever we want.

462
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:25,933
- Stop! Help me!
- Whatever we want.

463
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,971
- Whatever we want.
- Whatever we want.

464
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,505
Oh, hi. Hello.

465
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:32,172
How y'all doin'?

466
00:27:32,174 --> 00:27:33,341
- Oh.
- Good evening, Captain.

467
00:27:33,343 --> 00:27:35,343
Well, hello.
Oh, my goodness.

468
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:37,211
Ah!

469
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:40,882
Would you mind, uh, lifting your tail?
You know...

470
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:42,150
Oh! Certainly.

471
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:44,455
Okay. Thank you
so much.

472
00:27:46,856 --> 00:27:48,323
Oh, hello.

473
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:49,393
Welcome aboard.

474
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:20,255
Ugh! You were so right,
Great-Grandfather.

475
00:28:20,257 --> 00:28:23,157
Monsters are disgusting!

476
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,095
They're animals!

477
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:44,077
I'll be right there.

478
00:28:51,954 --> 00:28:54,288
Dracula, is he on board?

479
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,592
Yes. I saw him.
Face-to-face. Ugh!

480
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:59,227
I was so nice to him.

481
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:01,528
That pale face of his
and his goofy smile,

482
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,230
showing off his fangs.

483
00:29:03,232 --> 00:29:05,033
Argh, it's just like
you taught me!

484
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,602
It's even worse than I feared!

485
00:29:07,604 --> 00:29:10,705
It was that fateful night
that I realized

486
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,308
a human could never defeat
a monster.

487
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:22,283
<i>But I wouldn't let
our family legacy die.</i>

488
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:27,255
<i>And so, I began to search
for an answer.</i>

489
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:32,526
<i>And I saw it in an ancient text,
an instrument of destruction</i>

490
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:35,063
<i>so powerful
it destroyed Atlantis,</i>

491
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,967
<i>a whole city of monsters.</i>

492
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:43,237
<i>And there, deep within the
rubble, it lay, waiting.</i>

493
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:47,040
Endlessly, I searched
for the lost city

494
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:50,545
Time passed, and my body
began to fail me.

495
00:29:50,547 --> 00:29:53,146
Oh, it was so sad, Ericka.

496
00:29:53,148 --> 00:29:55,650
First my liver,
then my spleen,

497
00:29:55,652 --> 00:29:58,318
followed by a kidney or two.

498
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,989
Then my golden locks.

499
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:04,525
But I wouldn't let
that stop me.

500
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:09,497
I replaced my failing organs
with technology!

501
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,199
Ha-ha!

502
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:13,101
And look at me now.

503
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,701
Mmm-hmm!

504
00:30:14,703 --> 00:30:17,573
Oh, girl,
it's an improvement, really.

505
00:30:18,674 --> 00:30:21,008
Um, sure.

506
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:26,680
And now, after 120 years,
I have finally found Atlantis.

507
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:28,516
Oh, forget about all this!

508
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:30,117
Let me get rid of
Dracula right now.

509
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,753
I was so close to him,
I could've just...

510
00:30:33,655 --> 00:30:36,324
No, no, no!

511
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:38,359
We have to
stick to the plan.

512
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:40,228
Lure the monsters
to Atlantis,

513
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,596
retrieve the instrument
of destruction,

514
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:45,466
trap them there,
and then wipe them out.

515
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,301
It's simple, Ericka!

516
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,371
Now, promise me you won't
try and kill Dracula.

517
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:51,773
Ugh, fine!

518
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:54,208
- I promise.
- Promise what?

519
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,745
I promise I won't
try and kill Dracula. Okay?

520
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:04,285
Ugh.

521
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:08,355
Don't worry, Great-Grandfather,
I won't try and kill him...

522
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:10,126
I will kill him.

555

Hey, isn't that
Captain Ericka?

560
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:13,914
Oh, no!

561
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:16,249
Uh, what? Eh, oh...

562
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:17,651
Oops, no,
not her.

563
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:20,854
Ooh, that's good!

564
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:21,956
Very amusing.

565
00:33:31,366 --> 00:33:34,267
Sorry, Drac. You know, it's just
we've never seen you like this.

566
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:35,503
I know.

567
00:33:35,505 --> 00:33:36,903
It doesn't make any sense.

568
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:39,640
You can't Zing twice,
it's impossible!

569
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,942
But I did! So now what?

570
00:33:41,944 --> 00:33:44,612
And what about Mavis?

571
00:33:44,614 --> 00:33:46,747
She wants you
to be happy, right?

572
00:33:46,749 --> 00:33:49,584
I'm sure she'll go
with the flow.

573
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:51,318
Oh, no, no, no!

574
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,787
Mavis needs me.
She depends on me.

575
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:56,856
I need to be home
with my family.

576
00:33:56,858 --> 00:34:00,961
Hey, Murray here may be from
Egypt, but you're the one in

577
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:02,496
"da Nile."

578
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,665
You guys get that?

579
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,933
Ow! You hit me right in the...

580
00:34:06,935 --> 00:34:07,938
Mavis!

581
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:13,943
Don't say a word, or
I'll haunt your dreams.

582
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:17,278
Having fun?

583
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,679
Oh, I'm having even more fun
now that you're here.

584
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:23,784
You know, Dad, I feel really lucky
to have this time with you.

585
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:26,686
All of us together,
it's really special.

586
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,590
Me, too,
spider monkey.

587
00:34:29,592 --> 00:34:32,860
Now, are you ready for me to
destroy you in monster ball?

588
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,630
Whoo-hoo! Monster ball!

589
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:36,896
Come on, Papa Drac!

590
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:38,599
Bring it on!

591
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:41,204
For I am king of family fun!

592
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,575
Ha-ha! All right!
Who is ready to get pummeled?

593
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,278
I got to warn you,

594
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,282
I played second-team coed intramural
volleyball at Santa Cruz.

595
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:56,983
Sure, pal. Whatever you say.

596
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:59,720
Everybody, just please
watch the hair.

597
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,554
Watch the hair!

598
00:35:01,556 --> 00:35:03,958
Oh-ho-ho! Let's go!
Let's do this!

599
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,427
Oh, my gosh, this is
gonna be so much fun.

600
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:07,795
Ha-ha! Get ready.

601
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:09,398
Here comes the pain!

602
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:15,836
- Spike!
- Not the hair!

603
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:17,641
Whoa!

604
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:21,876
No, no, no!

605
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:25,912
All right!

606
00:35:25,914 --> 00:35:29,083
<i>Captain
Ericka, you are needed on deck.</i>

607
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,485
Next stop...
Buh-bye, Dracula.

608
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:34,023
Ha-ha! All right, baby!

609
00:35:56,346 --> 00:35:57,778
Oh, baby, I got this.

610
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,347
Hey there, monsters.

611
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:00,284
Huh?

612
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:04,887
Yeah! What'd I say!

613
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:10,027
<i>We're arriving
at our first destination.</i>

614
00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:18,798
<i>The underwater volcano!</i>

615
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,903
<i>Everyone, grab your scuba
gear and get ready to explore</i>

616
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,309
<i>the wonders of the sea.</i>

617
00:36:25,942 --> 00:36:27,907
Especially you,

618
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:29,478
Count Dracula.

619
00:36:33,715 --> 00:36:35,449
You see that, pal?
She likes you.

620
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:36,816
Oh, no, no, no.

621
00:36:36,818 --> 00:36:38,885
That sounds like a Zing
in full effect.

622
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:40,787
Oh, no, no, no.

623
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:42,490
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

624
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,126
I'm just here
to have family fun.

625
00:36:45,128 --> 00:36:47,431
Family, family, fun, fun.

626
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,487
Hmm, let's see.
What about here?

627
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,044
Right this way, everyone.

628
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:50,090
Welcome to one of the true wonders
of the underwater kingdom.

629
00:37:50,092 --> 00:37:53,626
I give you Volcano del Fuego.

630
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:55,929
Or, as the local sea life
call it...

631
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:57,791
Whee!

632
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:53,880
Aw, what a cute family.

633
00:39:53,882 --> 00:39:54,949
What? No, it's not.

634
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:56,786
Argh! Dracula bad!

635
00:41:11,693 --> 00:41:13,059
Frank, we just ate.

636
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:15,229
I can't believe
you're hungry already.

637
00:41:15,231 --> 00:41:16,963
I'm sorry.
You know what it is?

638
00:41:16,965 --> 00:41:18,898
It's all... Just all that
seafood just swimming around,

639
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,867
and when I "see food..."

640
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:23,970
Oh, man! I'm gone.

641
00:41:23,972 --> 00:41:26,907
Oh! Dracula, Dracula, Dracula!

642
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:28,976
Dracula, Dracula!

643
00:41:28,978 --> 00:41:32,079
I get so close, but it's
almost like he's teasing me.

644
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:34,313
I just, I can't
stand it anymore.

645
00:41:34,315 --> 00:41:35,618
I have to get him!

646
00:41:46,394 --> 00:41:49,829
Boy, that underwater volcano
looked hot.

647
00:41:49,831 --> 00:41:51,701
Mmm-hmm.

648
00:41:55,403 --> 00:41:57,336
Oh... Hi, Bob.

649
00:41:57,338 --> 00:42:01,307
Right. We promised you we'd
play, uh, ping-pong now.

650
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:03,876
Um, Dennis?
Who is this?

651
00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:05,945
Uh, it's our friend, Bob.

652
00:42:05,947 --> 00:42:07,783
- Say hi, Bob.
- "Hi, Bob."

653
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:12,251
Okay! Time to go
play ping-pong.

654
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:13,387
- Drac!
- Drac!

655
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:15,992
- Drac!
- Drac!

656
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,026
Hey, boys,
where's the fire?

657
00:42:20,028 --> 00:42:21,394
Oh, well,
Griffin here, he...

658
00:42:21,396 --> 00:42:23,764
- He has something to tell you.
- Me? Uh...

659
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:26,133
Oh. Yeah, I got this bite on
my hand, and since, you know,

660
00:42:26,135 --> 00:42:28,434
you're a biting expert, I
thought you could take a look.

661
00:42:28,436 --> 00:42:30,005
- Yeah. Come on over here.
- The light is better.

662
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,775
Okay...

663
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:36,876
Okay, what is going on?

664
00:42:36,878 --> 00:42:39,912
You guys are acting weirder than normal,
and your normal is pretty weird.

665
00:42:39,914 --> 00:42:41,914

But what are you talking about?

674
00:43:01,137 --> 00:43:03,436
Okay, well, see, Frank got
hungry, so no surprise there...

675
00:43:03,438 --> 00:43:07,307
But we swam back to the ship, and
we found Ericka raving about you.

676
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:09,142
She can't live
without you, buddy.

677
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:10,878

Uh, yes.

681
00:43:19,954 --> 00:43:22,456
- Maybe? No.
- Ugh.

682
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:25,793
It's been a while. I don't
even know where to start.

683
00:43:25,795 --> 00:43:28,195
It's easy, Drac.
Just make some small talk.

684
00:43:28,197 --> 00:43:30,030
- Remember to smile.
- Look into her eyes.

685
00:43:30,032 --> 00:43:32,032
- Keep it casual.
- Say something funny.

686
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:33,300
Ask her where
her parts are from.

687
00:43:33,302 --> 00:43:35,001
Oh, and say
that her wrappings look nice.

688
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:36,804
- "Do you like coffins?"
- Compliment her.

689
00:43:36,806 --> 00:43:38,805
- "Your neck looks delicious."
- Here she comes.

690
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:41,208
Okay, Drac,
hit it.

691
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,409
Your delicious neck wrappings
are in a nice coffin.

692
00:43:43,411 --> 00:43:46,313
Would you like
to see my parts?

693
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:51,217
Yes, I'd love to go out
with you.

00:43:52,454 --> 00:43:53,586
What?

696
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:54,987

00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:30,583
Whoo-hoo!
Beach time!

712
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:32,418
Johnny, you go
set everything up.

713
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,354
And, Dad, you go get in
line for the snow cones.

714
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,124
You know, actually,
I was thinking you and Johnny

715
00:45:37,126 --> 00:45:38,958
should spend
some time together.

716
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,394
What do you call it again?
Eh, date night?

717
00:45:41,396 --> 00:45:42,929
Date night?

718
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:44,697
- What are you gonna do?
- Well, I thought

719
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:47,066
me and the guys would
take this opportunity

720
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:50,170
to spend some quality time
with Dennis.

721
00:45:50,172 --> 00:45:52,039
Oh. Okay.
That's a great idea.

722
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,706
Come on, Johnny.
Date night.

723
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:56,478
Duh-duh-duh-duh-date night!

724
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,159
Okay, here you go!

725
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,103
- Good girl!
- I got this one.

726
00:46:29,143 --> 00:46:30,644
What was that?

727
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:32,545
It sounds like our children.

728
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:35,382
- It is our children! Run!
- Run!

729
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:37,450
Please! Help! Someone!

730
00:46:37,452 --> 00:46:39,418
Get the parents!

731
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,356
Frank? Would you rub
some moonscreen on my back

732
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:43,990
before I get burned?

733
00:46:43,992 --> 00:46:45,191
Wait one second, honey.

734
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:46,525
You know, the kids buried me
in the sand.

735
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:54,700
Mmm. Thanks, honey.

736
00:46:54,702 --> 00:46:57,204
- Shall we have another?
- Sure.

737
00:46:57,206 --> 00:47:00,539
- Sounds good.
- Straight up.

738
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:02,675
Isn't this place amazing?

739
00:47:02,677 --> 00:47:05,679
Whoa! The menu is in a bottle!

740
00:47:05,681 --> 00:47:07,583
Genius! Isn't that
awesome, honey?

741
00:47:10,085 --> 00:47:11,717
What? Oh, sorry.

742
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:13,720
I was just thinking
about my dad.

743
00:47:13,722 --> 00:47:16,623
Don't you think
he's acting weird lately?

744
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:20,059
Not really. Besides having
a huge crush on the captain.

745
00:47:20,061 --> 00:47:22,028
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

746
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,597
The Love Boat is definitely
making another run.

747
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,365
No way. He's...

748
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:28,635
He's my dad.

749
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,436
I know, right? It's weird.

750
00:47:30,438 --> 00:47:34,273
When my parents kiss,
I still close my eyes.

751
00:47:34,275 --> 00:47:39,579
I guess I never thought about
him with anyone besides my mom.

752
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:42,081
You're cool with it,
though, right?

753
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:44,217
Of course. I want him
to be happy.

754
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:45,221
Totally.

755
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:49,121
Totally.

756
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:57,831
<i>Buenas noches, mi amigo.</i>

757
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:03,836
Have you a beverage
to quench me of my parchment?

758
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:06,342
Yes, of course,
Mr. Chupacabra.

759
00:48:10,244 --> 00:48:12,181
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

760
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,463
You look ravishing.

761
00:48:29,465 --> 00:48:30,563
Oh.

762
00:48:30,565 --> 00:48:31,764
Uh, thank you. I just...

763
00:48:31,766 --> 00:48:33,268
Oh.

764
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:44,177
So, um...

765
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:47,246
Does Captain Ericka
have a last name?

766
00:48:47,248 --> 00:48:48,715
Uh, oh, uh...

767
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,851
Oh, guacamole!

768
00:48:50,853 --> 00:48:52,385
"Ericka Guacamole"?

769
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:55,722
That's so international.

770
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:59,525
No.
Guacamole for us to share.

771
00:48:59,527 --> 00:49:01,894
Oh, how beautiful
is that full moon tonight?

772
00:49:01,896 --> 00:49:03,331
Look. Right behind you.

773
00:49:07,735 --> 00:49:11,204
Mmm! The food here
is to die for.

774
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:25,784
Holy moly, that was
a lot of guacamole.

775
00:49:25,786 --> 00:49:28,155
Are you feeling all right?

776
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:30,824
- Totally fine. Why?
- No reason.

777
00:49:32,693 --> 00:49:34,360
Oh...

778
00:49:34,362 --> 00:49:37,796
There must have been garlic
in the guacamole.

779
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:39,331
Oh, no.

780
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:40,800
Isn't that deadly
for you?

781
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:42,771
No, no, no.
It's just that I'm...

782
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:45,373
Garlic intolerant.

783
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:54,850
Was that you?

784
00:49:56,684 --> 00:49:59,452
Whoo!

785
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:00,686
Oh, yeah!

786
00:50:00,688 --> 00:50:02,889
Dolphin surfing!

787
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,597
Whoa!

788
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,532
Hi, Mama. Hi, Papa.

789
00:50:13,534 --> 00:50:14,668
Hey-hey.

790
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,403
Oh! Hey there.

791
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:18,405
- Papa.
- Hidey-ho!

792
00:50:18,407 --> 00:50:19,606
Hi.

793
00:50:19,608 --> 00:50:21,974
Is my dad
in there, too?

794
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,579
Don't worry,
I'm over here. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

795
00:50:26,581 --> 00:50:30,619
No, Papa Drac's not here.
He's on his date.

796
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:32,487
Date?

797
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:37,856
Please, forgive me,

798
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:39,559
I'm just very nervous.

799
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:41,528
You see,

800
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:46,769
I haven't had a date
since my wife died.

801
00:50:48,804 --> 00:50:50,737
How old was your daughter?

802
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:52,706
She was just an infant.

803
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,673
It was hard
being a single dad,

804
00:50:54,675 --> 00:50:57,212
but I did my best.

805
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,648
I never knew
my mother, either.

806
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,816
Or my father.

807
00:51:03,818 --> 00:51:06,019
Oh, I'm so sorry.

808
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,554
Who raised you?

809
00:51:07,556 --> 00:51:09,623
My great-grandfather.

810
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:12,325
I basically grew up
on this ship.

811
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:14,561
That's why
you're a captain.

812
00:51:14,563 --> 00:51:17,831
Yeah. It's all
I've ever known.

813
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:20,336
It was just expected.

814
00:51:21,302 --> 00:51:22,802
You know, a family thing.

815
00:51:22,804 --> 00:51:26,740
I understand,
family is everything.

816
00:51:26,742 --> 00:51:29,508
You have to honor the past.

817
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,780
But we make our own future.

818
00:51:45,027 --> 00:51:47,026
- Dad?
- Mavis!

819
00:51:47,028 --> 00:51:49,565
- Mmm.
- Johnny!

820
00:51:51,932 --> 00:51:56,970
Captain Ericka and I were just
discussing the hospitality industry.

821
00:51:56,972 --> 00:51:59,039
You know,
just work stuff.

822
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,606
You're working now?

823
00:52:00,608 --> 00:52:02,508
This is supposed to be
a vacation.

824
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,909
A family vacation.

825
00:52:03,911 --> 00:52:07,546
I should really go
do captain-y things.

826
00:52:07,548 --> 00:52:10,583
Dad, you said you were
gonna spend time with Dennis.

827
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,787
Dennis. Dennis? Dennis.

828
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:16,555
Oh! Yeah, you're right.
Where is that kid?

829
00:52:16,557 --> 00:52:19,092
Denisovich? You're
supposed to be with me.

830
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,360
Come on now, kid,
it's family time.

831
00:52:21,362 --> 00:52:22,864
Quit hiding. Dennis?

832
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,632
What was that about?

833
00:52:25,634 --> 00:52:26,932
You mean
your dad's date?

834
00:52:26,934 --> 00:52:29,936
It wasn't a date.
It was work stuff.

835
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,104
Uh-huh.

836
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,938
I'm telling you, Johnny,

837
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,773
there is something about
that woman I don't trust.

838
00:52:34,775 --> 00:52:37,876
But you want your dad
to be happy, right?

839
00:52:37,878 --> 00:52:39,378
Yes.

840
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,414
Just not with her.

841
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:43,115
Mmm.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

842
00:52:43,117 --> 00:52:44,550
Heads up, honey.

843
00:52:44,552 --> 00:52:46,720
This guac is loaded
with garlic.

844
00:52:46,722 --> 00:52:47,790
Garlic?

845
00:52:54,528 --> 00:52:56,831
Aw! That was
a cute toot, honey.

846
00:53:14,115 --> 00:53:16,950
- We've been up all night!
- Let's stay up all day, too!

847
00:53:16,952 --> 00:53:18,851
Let's get wild!

848
00:53:31,565 --> 00:53:33,566
- Ericka!
- What?

849
00:53:33,568 --> 00:53:36,936
Just where have you been, young lady?

850
00:53:36,938 --> 00:53:39,405
Uh, doing work.

851
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,407
Wearing that?

852
00:53:41,409 --> 00:53:43,943
You were with him!
I know it!

853
00:53:43,945 --> 00:53:45,912
Who?

854
00:53:45,914 --> 00:53:48,046
"Who?" You know who!

855
00:53:48,048 --> 00:53:50,617
You've been sneaking around
my back

856
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:53,952
trying to kill Dracula again,
haven't you?

857
00:53:53,954 --> 00:53:56,755
So what if I have?
I am a grown woman!

858
00:53:56,757 --> 00:53:58,057
I have the right to kill
whoever I want.

859
00:53:58,059 --> 00:54:00,526
It's not just about you.

860
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,829
You could have ruined
the legacy.

861
00:54:03,831 --> 00:54:06,599
What if he discovered
who you were?

862
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:09,903
I know. I wasn't thinking.
There's just something about him

863
00:54:09,905 --> 00:54:11,838
that just drives me crazy!

864
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,972
I just, I see him,
and I want to...

865
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:15,108
Punch him?

866
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,811
Uh... I guess.

867
00:54:17,813 --> 00:54:19,878
Just, I can't wait
to get this over with.

868
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,115
Don't worry,
it won't be long now.

869
00:54:22,117 --> 00:54:25,552
Once you recover the
instrument of destruction,

870
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,554
no one can stop us.

871
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,425
Not even Dracula!

872
00:54:30,492 --> 00:54:32,862
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Spies!

873
00:54:37,532 --> 00:54:39,865
Now, quickly,
before someone comes!

874
00:55:00,989 --> 00:55:03,623
<i>Everyone assemble
on the forward deck.</i>

875
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:07,526
<i>We are arriving
at our final destination.</i>

876
00:55:07,528 --> 00:55:09,095
From the depths of creation,

877
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,831
the mighty city has risen
once again.

878
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:15,635
<i>Home to the greatest
monster civilization</i>

879
00:55:15,637 --> 00:55:17,537
<i>the world has ever known,</i>

880
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:22,242
far surpassing Athens and Rome in
art, culture and sophistication.

881
00:55:22,244 --> 00:55:27,583
I give you the legendary
lost city of Atlantis.

882
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:55,874
It's a giant Kraken!

883
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:58,744
<i>♪ There's a place

884
00:55:58,746 --> 00:56:02,081

00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:06,985

Ooh. I am so excited!

899
00:57:06,947 --> 00:57:08,250
Come to Daddy!

900
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,251
- Oh.
- Twenty-eight black!

901
00:57:13,822 --> 00:57:14,757
Oh!

902
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:19,325
- Ahhh!
- Oh, no, you don't.

903
00:57:19,327 --> 00:57:22,327
Last time you gambled, you lost
an arm and a leg. Literally!

904
00:57:22,329 --> 00:57:24,329
- Replacement limbs...
- I'll raise you 40.

905
00:57:24,331 --> 00:57:26,798
...aren't just lying around
like they were in the old days.

906
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,101
So, no gambling.

907
00:57:29,103 --> 00:57:30,235
Frank!

908
00:57:30,237 --> 00:57:32,173
Yes, dear! Got it!
No gambling!

909
00:57:38,713 --> 00:57:40,380
- Tinkles, stop.
- Wait.

910
00:57:40,382 --> 00:57:42,682
- Stop it, Tinkles, stop.
- Ah! Wait!

911
00:57:46,186 --> 00:57:48,220
Have you guys seen Mavis?
I have to find her.

912
00:57:48,222 --> 00:57:49,722
Why? What's going on?

913
00:57:49,724 --> 00:57:51,758
I'm going to tell her
about Ericka.

914
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,226
I can't lie to
my own daughter anymore.

915
00:57:54,228 --> 00:57:57,130
She's the most important
person in the world to me.

916
00:57:57,132 --> 00:57:59,134
I have to tell her the truth.

917
00:58:01,335 --> 00:58:03,171
Right after I talk to Ericka.

918
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,642
Hey.

919
00:58:08,876 --> 00:58:10,208
All right, I'm all...

920
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:12,278
Frank, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

921
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,984
I got this. I'm all in.

922
00:58:18,152 --> 00:58:20,086
Johnny, have you seen
my dad?

923
00:58:20,088 --> 00:58:22,822
- Maybe he's with Bob.
- Why would he be with Bob?

924
00:58:22,824 --> 00:58:24,824
Bob's a great guy.

925
00:58:24,826 --> 00:58:26,894
- Oh, there he is.
- Who? Bob?

926
00:58:44,244 --> 00:58:47,146
There he is!
Hi, Bob!

927
01:00:12,534 --> 01:00:13,736
Oh.

928
01:01:26,173 --> 01:01:27,376
There it is.

929
01:01:45,893 --> 01:01:47,360
You saved my life.

930
01:01:47,362 --> 01:01:49,295
Of course.
Why wouldn't I?

931
01:01:49,297 --> 01:01:52,932
I just can't believe you
would do that for a human.

932
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:55,967
Humans, monsters,
what's the difference?

933
01:01:55,969 --> 01:01:59,005
Yeah, right. Right.

934
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:01,240
Wait. What are you doing here?

935
01:02:01,242 --> 01:02:05,077
Oh, uh... Well, you know,
vampires can predict the future,

936
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:08,113
so I knew you would
need my help.

937
01:02:08,115 --> 01:02:10,349
Ha! Never heard that before.

938
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,418
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a well-known fact.

939
01:02:13,621 --> 01:02:15,287
What are you doing here?

940
01:02:15,289 --> 01:02:16,421
Oh! Uh...

941
01:02:16,423 --> 01:02:18,523
Well, I'm here to get that.

942
01:02:18,525 --> 01:02:20,492
Yeah, it's a family heirloom.

943
01:02:20,494 --> 01:02:25,130
Yeah, it was lost at sea, and
my great-grandfather is... Was!

944
01:02:25,132 --> 01:02:28,467
Uh, was totally obsessed
with getting it back.

945
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:32,907
So, anywho, thanks for saving my
life, but I can take it from...

946
01:02:38,646 --> 01:02:40,179
Got to be
a little more careful.

947
01:02:40,181 --> 01:02:42,081
How many times
can you save my life, right?

948
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,550
I don't know. Every time?

949
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:47,122
Really? Well, then...

950
01:03:21,688 --> 01:03:23,024
Wow!

951
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:43,512
Ah,
that was incredible.

952
01:03:54,688 --> 01:03:56,322
Oh, uh...

953
01:03:56,324 --> 01:03:59,427
Don't you want to get
your family heirloom thingy?

954
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,063
Oh. Right.

955
01:04:07,335 --> 01:04:09,501
Got it.

956
01:04:38,365 --> 01:04:40,365
Mmm.

957
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:42,233
Oh, here, let me get
that for you.

958
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:45,673
Dad!

959
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,606
Mavis!

960
01:04:48,608 --> 01:04:50,409
What are you doing
to my father?

961
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:52,378
Wait! Whoa. Whoa!

962
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,646
Mavis, stop!
Put her down!

963
01:04:54,648 --> 01:04:58,150
No! She's trying to hurt you.
Why can't you see that?

964
01:04:59,554 --> 01:05:02,420
Because I...

965
01:05:02,422 --> 01:05:04,657
Because I Zinged.

966
01:05:04,659 --> 01:05:06,157
What?

967
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:08,696
I Zinged with Ericka.

968
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,164
No, that can't be true.

969
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:13,699
You only Zing once.

970
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,334
That's what I thought, too.

971
01:05:16,336 --> 01:05:18,637
"Zing"? What's a Zing?

972
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:22,675
Uh, well, it's a thing
for monsters.

973
01:05:22,677 --> 01:05:25,478
It's kind of like
our "love at first sight."

974
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,313
What? No. No, no, no.

975
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:30,648
- You don't even know me.
- Well, not yet.

976
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:33,151
- But we're just...
- No, you don't understand.

977
01:05:33,153 --> 01:05:34,686
I can't be with you.

978
01:05:34,688 --> 01:05:37,623
I could never be
with someone like you.

979
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:38,760
I could never be with

980
01:05:39,693 --> 01:05:40,795
a monster.

981
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:54,305
Dad, I'm so sorry.

982
01:05:54,307 --> 01:05:56,110
- I...
- It doesn't matter.

983
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:00,147
You heard what she said.

984
01:06:07,722 --> 01:06:09,557
But a Zing never lies.

985
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:25,807
Ha! You got it!

986
01:06:26,907 --> 01:06:28,342
Yes.

987
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:35,280
Now that we have
the instrument of destruction,

988
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:38,217
our family legacy
will be fulfilled.

989
01:06:38,219 --> 01:06:42,720
But first, we'll draw them in
with a dance party!

990
01:06:42,722 --> 01:06:45,423
I love to dance.

991
01:06:59,373 --> 01:07:00,940
Frank,
could you zip me up?

992
01:07:00,942 --> 01:07:02,907
We're gonna be late.

993
01:07:02,909 --> 01:07:05,211
Where did you get those?

994
01:07:05,213 --> 01:07:07,412
Uh, see,
here's the funny thing.

995
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:10,316
I lost my hands gambling,
but... It's no big deal!

996
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:12,383
Look, I got these
from the seafood buffet.

997
01:07:12,385 --> 01:07:14,753
Look at this. Clickety-click,
click, clack, clack, click, click.

998
01:07:14,755 --> 01:07:17,159
I kind of like 'em.
I like 'em.

999
01:07:22,996 --> 01:07:24,597
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm.

1000
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:26,398
Mmm. Mmm.

1001
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,536
A-ha!

1002
01:07:50,992 --> 01:07:52,825
Ah, I guess the party's
this way.

1003
01:07:52,827 --> 01:07:53,762
Whoo!

1004
01:07:54,894 --> 01:07:56,364
Whoa!

1005
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:06,708
Wow.

1006
01:08:09,409 --> 01:08:11,976
Let's get this party
started right!

1007
01:08:11,978 --> 01:08:13,445
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right!

1008
01:08:13,447 --> 01:08:14,449
What?

1009
01:08:15,815 --> 01:08:17,415
Huh?

1010
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:20,419
I thought they said
the party was this way.

1011
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:48,946
DJ in a clamshell?

1012
01:08:48,948 --> 01:08:51,450
I'm so jealous.

1013
01:09:38,099 --> 01:09:42,067
I can't believe my dad Zinged with
someone who's trying to kill him.

1014
01:09:42,069 --> 01:09:44,469
Yeah, the Zing
makes you do crazy things.

1015
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,705
Really, Johnny?

1016
01:09:46,707 --> 01:09:51,477
What's most important to understand
is that love is an infinite enigma

1017
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:53,745
that is beyond
our understanding.

1018
01:09:53,747 --> 01:09:57,116
You and I were two halves,
a world apart.

1019
01:09:57,118 --> 01:10:00,152
But then we followed
the strands of destiny

1020
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,919
and were brought together.

1021
01:10:01,921 --> 01:10:04,889
And our halves made one whole.

1022
01:10:04,891 --> 01:10:07,092
But what if she and he...

1023
01:10:07,094 --> 01:10:10,661
You must release all the
negativity and look within.

1024
01:10:10,663 --> 01:10:12,701
Your bond is unbreakable.

1025
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,902
You're right, honey. Wow.

1026
01:10:16,904 --> 01:10:18,403
Thanks.

1027
01:10:18,405 --> 01:10:20,772
Whoa, you sounded
pretty smart, Dad.

1028
01:10:20,774 --> 01:10:22,808
Oh, that? Yeah, it was
just the philosophy

1029
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:25,576
of Sifu Sing from my favorite
TV show when I was a kid,

1030
01:10:25,578 --> 01:10:27,178
<i>Kung Fu Shaolin Monk Master.</i>

1031
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,847
Anyways, let's get back
to dancing!

1032
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:29,984
Cool.

1033
01:10:34,154 --> 01:10:36,722
Dad? You have to talk
to Ericka.

1034
01:10:36,724 --> 01:10:37,822
- What?
- I know.

1035
01:10:37,824 --> 01:10:39,657
I know what I said before,

1036
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:42,527
but maybe I overreacted
a teensy bit.

1037
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:44,830
It's just the thought
of losing you.

1038
01:10:44,832 --> 01:10:47,965
What? What are you talking
about, losing me?

1039
01:10:47,967 --> 01:10:50,001
Well, obviously,
after you get married,

1040
01:10:50,003 --> 01:10:51,969
you're gonna live on the ship
and travel around the world...

1041
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:54,572
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Mavis.

1042
01:10:54,574 --> 01:10:56,808
There are two things
I can promise you.

1043
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:02,647
One, nothing can ever take me
from you and all my family.

1044
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:05,920
Two, I will never live
on a boat.

1045
01:11:08,456 --> 01:11:10,923
You're my cute
little tarantula.

1046
01:11:10,925 --> 01:11:13,058
How could I ever leave you?

1047
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,059
Now, seriously,
go talk to her.

1048
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:17,463
I can't. You heard
what she said,

1049
01:11:17,465 --> 01:11:20,165
she could never be
with someone like me.

1050
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:22,500
No, Dad.
You're just a half,

1051
01:11:22,502 --> 01:11:26,004
and you have to follow your destiny
to find an infinite whole.

1052
01:11:26,006 --> 01:11:27,839
You sound like Johnny.

1053
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:30,741
Point is,
you can't deny a Zing.

1054
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:33,512
Monster, human, unicorn...

1055
01:11:33,514 --> 01:11:34,582
It doesn't matter.

1056
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:37,551
So go to her! Now!

1057
01:11:39,019 --> 01:11:40,652
Okay. I'm on it.

1058
01:11:42,155 --> 01:11:43,688
Hey, man, you're
not allowed up here.

1059
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:46,191
The DJ booth is a sacred space.

1060
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:55,200
No. Tinkles, quiet.

1061
01:11:55,202 --> 01:11:56,735
Who is this?

1062
01:11:56,737 --> 01:12:01,138
Ha! I know you recognize me,
your greatest rival.

1063
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:04,041
Hmm. Oh, right.

1064
01:12:04,043 --> 01:12:07,144
You own that Holiday Inn
down by the airport.

1065
01:12:07,146 --> 01:12:11,782
No! It is I,
Abraham Van Helsing.

1066
01:12:11,784 --> 01:12:13,251
Van Helsing?

1067
01:12:13,253 --> 01:12:15,120
After all these years?

1068
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,025
You look awful.

1069
01:12:18,259 --> 01:12:21,226
Always with the quick insults.

1070
01:12:21,228 --> 01:12:23,762
Well, this will shut you up.

1071
01:12:23,764 --> 01:12:25,664
And all monsters.

1072
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:29,701
Eh, huh? That's just Ericka's
family heirloom thingy.

1073
01:12:29,703 --> 01:12:32,204
Good one, Ericka.

1074
01:12:32,206 --> 01:12:33,738
Ericka?

1075
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,107
You fool.

1076
01:12:35,109 --> 01:12:37,976
Not only is she
the ship's captain,

1077
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:39,878
but she also happens
to be...

1078
01:12:42,216 --> 01:12:44,619
Wait. You tell him.

1079
01:12:46,252 --> 01:12:48,922
I'm his great-granddaughter.

1080
01:12:50,256 --> 01:12:52,991
I'm Ericka Van Helsing.

1081
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:55,994
I knew there was
something wrong with her.

1082
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:57,262
But...

1083
01:12:57,264 --> 01:13:00,065
See, what happened...

1084
01:13:00,067 --> 01:13:02,099
Now that we're all caught up,

1085
01:13:02,101 --> 01:13:04,937
let's get back to the dying.

1086
01:13:04,939 --> 01:13:10,342
Behold, the key to the demise
of all monsters.

1087
01:13:22,855 --> 01:13:24,156
Let's see.

1088
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:26,791
Right... Okay.

1089
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:32,030
Listen to the melody

1090
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,902
of your destruction.

1091
01:13:37,003 --> 01:13:39,370
Ooh, what's this little
doodad do?

1092
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:42,242
Yeah!

1093
01:14:04,698 --> 01:14:06,968
Hey, look! It's the Kraken.

1094
01:14:21,681 --> 01:14:23,016
Everybody out! Now!

1095
01:14:35,295 --> 01:14:37,696
We're trapped! Everybody back!

1096
01:14:59,086 --> 01:15:01,021
Yay!

1097
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:10,062
Baby!

1098
01:15:10,064 --> 01:15:11,729
Papa!

1099
01:15:21,942 --> 01:15:23,778
This has to stop now!

1100
01:15:24,944 --> 01:15:25,943
Drac, no!

1101
01:15:25,945 --> 01:15:26,913
Ah!

1102
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:41,026
Dad!

1103
01:15:42,429 --> 01:15:43,928
Mavis!

1104
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:46,867
Time for the immortal Dracula
to die.

1105
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,111
Dad!

1106
01:16:05,152 --> 01:16:06,186
No!

1107
01:16:07,787 --> 01:16:08,822
Ericka!

1108
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,226
Bob! Help!

1109
01:16:14,228 --> 01:16:15,430
Huh?

1110
01:16:18,832 --> 01:16:19,964
Tinkles?

1111
01:16:19,966 --> 01:16:21,133
Dennis.

1112
01:16:21,135 --> 01:16:23,835
Oh, no.
Bob is Tinkles?

1113
01:16:23,837 --> 01:16:25,236
How did he get here?

1114
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:27,240
But thank goodness he did,
'cause look!

1115
01:17:08,181 --> 01:17:09,446
You can't do this!

1116
01:17:09,448 --> 01:17:11,284
You're wrong
about monsters!

1117
01:17:12,452 --> 01:17:15,320
Dracula... He saved my life.

1118
01:17:15,322 --> 01:17:16,588
What?

1119
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,455
I'm so sorry, Drac.

1120
01:17:18,457 --> 01:17:20,925
I was trying to kill you
this whole time,

1121
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:23,495
but then I realized
how wrong I was.

1122
01:17:23,497 --> 01:17:25,533
How wrong all of this is.

1123
01:17:27,033 --> 01:17:28,900
And then I...

1124
01:17:28,902 --> 01:17:30,104
I Zinged.

1125
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:33,304
"Zing"? What's a Zing?

1126
01:17:33,306 --> 01:17:34,572
It's a monster thing.

1127
01:17:34,574 --> 01:17:36,374
You wouldn't understand.

1128
01:17:36,376 --> 01:17:38,977
It's like true love.

1129
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:40,044
Love?

1130
01:17:43,417 --> 01:17:46,183
Well, I guess the legacy
ends with me.

1131
01:17:46,185 --> 01:17:48,119
Hmm, that's an awkward ending.

1132
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:49,321
Nope!

1133
01:17:49,323 --> 01:17:51,959
It's time to start
a new legacy.

1134
01:17:52,993 --> 01:17:55,463
A monster-human legacy.

1135
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,062
No!

1136
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:08,240
Drac! Van Helsing's beats are
controlling the giant octopus thingy.

1137
01:18:08,242 --> 01:18:12,244
If there's one thing I hate,
it's an evil DJ.

1138
01:18:12,246 --> 01:18:15,149
We need positive energy!

1139
01:18:21,354 --> 01:18:24,488
Get ready for a DJ battle!

1140
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:27,424
You just carry all that
stuff around with you?

1141
01:18:27,426 --> 01:18:30,629
Once a bar mitzvah DJ,
always a bar mitzvah DJ.

1142
01:18:30,631 --> 01:18:34,499
We're gonna use good music
to defeat his evil music.

1143
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:37,134
- What?
- Trust me, I know the tunes,

1144
01:18:37,136 --> 01:18:39,036
but you've got the power.

1145
01:18:39,038 --> 01:18:41,071
All right. Okay.

1146
01:18:41,073 --> 01:18:44,342
Opening song needs to
be off the shizak.

1147
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:46,447
Ooh, got it. Play this!

1148
01:18:50,149 --> 01:18:52,116
<i>♪ I'm picking up
good vibrations</i>

1149
01:18:53,252 --> 01:18:55,954
<i>♪ She's giving me excitations</i>

1150
01:18:55,956 --> 01:18:58,255
- <i>♪ Good</i>

1151
01:18:58,257 --> 01:19:00,025

1156

<i>♪ She's giving me...</i>

1157
01:19:07,501 --> 01:19:09,366
What is that noise?

1158
01:19:09,368 --> 01:19:12,202
<i>♪ I'm picking up
good vibrations</i>

1159
01:19:12,204 --> 01:19:13,938
<i>♪ She's giving me

1160
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,339
Wow! I like this one.

1161
01:19:15,341 --> 01:19:17,174
This feels good.

1162
01:19:17,176 --> 01:19:19,244
<i>♪ Good vibrations ♪</i>

1163
01:19:19,246 --> 01:19:21,278
The fool.

1164
01:19:45,372 --> 01:19:48,305
Whoa! His music
is too powerful!

1165
01:19:48,307 --> 01:19:50,642
We're gonna need something
even more positive.

1166
01:19:50,644 --> 01:19:51,913
Now, Drac!

1167
01:20:00,354 --> 01:20:02,189
<i>♪ So don't worry</i>

1168
01:20:03,657 --> 01:20:05,190

<i>♪ Don't worry</i>

1170
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:09,027

<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... ♪</i>

1176
01:20:18,771 --> 01:20:21,539
I've had enough
of this nonsense!

1177
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:47,565
Johnny, we need
the most brain-dominating,

1178
01:20:47,567 --> 01:20:51,335
toe-tappinating song in the
history of all the universe.

1179
01:20:54,707 --> 01:20:57,377
Come on.
Where is it?

1180
01:20:59,378 --> 01:21:01,513
I don't know!

1181
01:21:01,515 --> 01:21:03,214
There's too many choices.

1182
01:21:05,752 --> 01:21:07,751
No, wait!

1183
01:21:07,753 --> 01:21:10,591
This is it.

1184
01:21:23,369 --> 01:21:24,669
What the...

1185
01:21:39,286 --> 01:21:41,154
Boy, that stinks.

1186
01:21:47,327 --> 01:21:49,693
It's working!

1187
01:21:56,470 --> 01:22:01,473
Hey, Johnny's corny music
is defeating the evil music.

1188
01:22:01,475 --> 01:22:02,807
I kind of like it.

1189
01:22:02,809 --> 01:22:04,545
Ooh!

1190
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:27,432
No!

1191
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:49,586
Argh! Ahhh! Whoo!

1192
01:22:49,588 --> 01:22:52,626
I'm a slave to the rhythm!

1193
01:22:58,832 --> 01:23:00,101
No!

1194
01:23:02,402 --> 01:23:04,335
Drac, what are you doing?

1195
01:23:04,337 --> 01:23:06,504
You got to be greater
than the haters!

1196
01:23:10,377 --> 01:23:12,146
Huh?

1197
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:23,321
Why?

1198
01:23:23,323 --> 01:23:26,223
Why, after everything,

1199
01:23:26,225 --> 01:23:28,358
would you save my life?

1200
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,795
Because basically
we are all the same.

1201
01:23:31,797 --> 01:23:35,400
Claws or hands, two eyes
or three eyes.

1202
01:23:35,402 --> 01:23:37,434
- Green skin.
- No skin.

1203
01:23:37,436 --> 01:23:38,835
- Prickly.
- Brainy.

1204
01:23:44,511 --> 01:23:45,813
I'm sorry.

1205
01:23:52,685 --> 01:23:54,686
Ew.

1206
01:23:54,688 --> 01:23:56,824
You are amazing.

1207
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,304
Look at me, Dennis.
Look at me.

1208
01:24:11,537 --> 01:24:14,304
Come on,
you can't deny it.

1209
01:24:14,306 --> 01:24:16,376
No! I'm too young
to Zing!

1210
01:24:21,314 --> 01:24:23,513
Well, I feel
kind of silly now.

1211
01:24:23,515 --> 01:24:27,352
Heh. For decades
I have hunted your kind,

1212
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:28,952
persecuted you.

1213
01:24:31,992 --> 01:24:35,195
The only thing I can do
to make it up to you is

1214
01:24:36,429 --> 01:24:37,728
give you

1215
01:24:38,998 --> 01:24:40,999
a 30% refund.

1216
01:24:41,001 --> 01:24:43,503
Preposterous!

1217
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,704
Oh, all right.

1218
01:24:46,706 --> 01:24:47,905
Full refund.

1219
01:25:18,505 --> 01:25:21,438
Wayne, Wanda,
what happened to you guys?

1220
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,041
Yeah, we, like,
hardly saw you on the cruise.

1221
01:25:24,043 --> 01:25:26,343
Yeah, I know.

1222
01:25:26,345 --> 01:25:28,312
We got tranquilized and spent most
of the trip locked in a closet.

1223
01:25:28,314 --> 01:25:31,018
We're gonna book it
again for the holidays.

1224
01:25:37,023 --> 01:25:38,522
Hi. Checking in?

1225
01:25:38,524 --> 01:25:40,558
Yes. Thank you.

1226
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,529
Great. I have a room all ready for you.

1227
01:25:44,363 --> 01:25:46,531
Hey, buddy, would you mind?

1228
01:25:46,533 --> 01:25:47,635
Sure thing, pal.

1229
01:26:03,483 --> 01:26:07,384
Okay, what's going on,
sneaky pants?

1230
01:26:07,386 --> 01:26:09,419
Oh, nothing.

1231
01:26:09,421 --> 01:26:13,626
It's just, I wanted to make
sure nobody would bother us.

1232
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,059
Oh! Why?

1233
01:26:16,061 --> 01:26:18,729
Are you going to suck-a my blood?
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1234
01:26:20,632 --> 01:26:22,433
No.

1235
01:26:22,435 --> 01:26:25,102
I was going to ask you

1236
01:26:25,104 --> 01:26:26,806
if you would marry me.

1237
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,945
Well? What do you say?

1238
01:26:33,947 --> 01:26:35,481
Will you marry me?

1239
01:26:39,085 --> 01:26:41,422
I... I...

1240
01:26:42,154 --> 01:26:43,856
Woobee deeba doobee?

1241
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:46,793
