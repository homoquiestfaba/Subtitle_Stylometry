1
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,739
<i>In the beginning there was only darkness.</i>

2
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:22,870
<i>And in the darkness a demon Zaal was born.</i>

3
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:25,331
<i>Ruler of the Underworld...</i>

4
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:28,834
<i>oppressor of humans.</i>

5
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:37,426
<i>But from the shadows came Crane,
the warrior of warriors</i>

6
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:41,180
<i>and bearer of the God Sword.</i>

7
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,271
<i>He liberated men</i>

8
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:53,693
<i>and led them to victory.</i>

9
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,067
<i>But the price of victory was high.</i>

10
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:29,179
<i>For Crane suffered a wound
through the heart</i>

11
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:33,150
<i>he bled for seven days
and seven nights.</i>

12
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:37,028
<i>But a hundred warriors
drank his blood.</i>

13
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,908
<i>And all were given his strength.</i>

14
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:53,253
<i>Crane looked at them
and saw that all was good.</i>

15
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:57,132
<i>And then he died.</i>

16
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:03,555
<i>Thus, the barbarians were created.</i>

17
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:06,225
<i>Sons of Crane.</i>

18
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:42,053
Oh, yeah.

19
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:03,658
Yes.

20
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:11,499
Listen, guys.
Strength! Courage! Fearlessness!

21
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:15,462
That is what Crane gave our people.

22
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:19,215
For thousands of generations,
generation after generation,

23
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:22,719
his blood has rushed
undiluted through our veins.

24
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:27,390
This is what we celebrate every year,
before we go on quests.

25
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:31,144
But first and foremost
is the blood of Crane, that makes us,

26
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:35,982
The barbarians,
the greatest warriors throughout Metalonia.

27
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,735
Okay, Ronal, it's your turn.

28
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:41,738
Ronal is sick...

29
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,324
Ronal is sick today.

30
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,660
Ronal!

31
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:50,497
Can't you pass me over?
I have a sore elbow.

32
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,959
Maybe I'm getting
dry skin... or...

33
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:58,172
joint inflammation.
Dammit, Ronal.

34
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:01,967
Put all your strength into it.

35
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,474
I'm looking forward to this...

36
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:34,041
Oh, for God's sake, Ronal, man.

37
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:36,794
One, two...

38
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:38,379
Can't...

39
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:40,464
...do...

40
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,842
...more!

41
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:45,803
You must get
in shape before the quest.

42
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,557
A barbarian who can't
swing an ax, is... uh...

43
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:52,018
not a real barbarian.

44
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:55,480
What do I need to quest for?
I'll just get in the way.

45
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:58,566
- Can't I hang out here?
- You are a Son of Crane.

46
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:03,112
A Son of Crane goes on quests and
kills monsters and returns in glory.

47
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,826
- It is the essence of being a barbarian.
- Uncle, look at me.

48
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:14,124
What should I do to monsters? Buckle on a
muscle suit and hope they die of laughter?

49
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,669
What then, Ronal?
Have you got any better ideas?

50
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,715
Fucking funny. Have you got
any brain cells?

51
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:27,262
What? Where? If there is one on my back,
can you squeez it out?

52
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:31,766
Listen here, kid. When you go on quests,
it is more about big balls...

53
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,603
not arms or heroism.

54
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,566
Once you've grasped it, you'll have
no problem crushing the enemy.

55
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:44,488
I just find it hard to overlook,
that we could die!

56
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:46,698
Just shut up and train.

57
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,043
What is it?

58
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:12,933
The alarm. Everyone to arms!
At your posts! Move!

59
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:18,689
- Get to it!
- Yes, yes!

60
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:21,108
Barricade the gate!

61
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:28,282
Come on! Pull!

62
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:34,538
Up on the barricades, stand ready!

63
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:46,926
Quiet.

64
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,728
Wait.

65
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,899
Quiet!

66
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,818
Who's there?

67
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,661
Hail, noble barbarians.
We are Master Florian

68
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:16,164
a bard and musical act.

69
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:19,793
We simply want...
for humble payment, of course

70
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:25,006
to enrich your minds
and your spectacular muscles

71
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:30,720
with noble sonatas of your past
heroes and heroines.

72
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:47,946
Attack!

73
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:53,368
- Songs. They sing songs at parties.
- Parties?

74
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:58,040
Check out their incredibly
large tuba on the roof.

75
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,833
Oh, let them in.

76
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,794
- No!
- Damn...

77
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,799
it's a hundred years
since I last split some skulls.

78
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:10,261
How the hell should I know
it was a tuba?

79
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,353
Yo, girls. How about
you wash my big, virile,

80
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,106
resilient, filthy and

81
00:08:22,273 --> 00:08:24,233
awesome lute?

82
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,613
There shall be only practice, nothing frivolous,
young Alibert.

83
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,406
We have to be ready.

84
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:34,660
Isn't there just a little bit of time
to walk around and look?

85
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:39,123
A true bard remembers all the songs perfectly.

86
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:43,086
How perfect does it need to be?
Shouldn't we be on our quest?

87
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:46,381
The barbarians are leaving tomorrow.
We could go with them.

88
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:50,009
Go with the flow.
I have to meet girls, man.

89
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:53,221
Maybe, write a heroic poem.

90
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:56,849
Or something like that,
You know, with those verses.

91
00:08:57,016 --> 00:09:00,520
Oh, young Alibert.
Only when you learn all the songs,

92
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:03,231
can you write that kind of poem.

93
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:08,820
- What? That'll take a hundred years.
- Nonsense. It won't take that long.

94
00:09:08,987 --> 00:09:13,408
I was only 57 when I finished
my apprenticeship.

95
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:15,827
Ouch! Fucking great.

96
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:19,331
Can Rikke, can Rikke,
can Rikke drink beer?

97
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:23,084
Can Rikke,
can Rikke, can Rikke drink beer?

98
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:29,049
Oh, it's good, man.

99
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:35,180
Can any one of you little children
guzzle a small pint of beer?

100
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:42,062
Alibert!

101
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:44,314
So I was on the hunt

102
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:48,527
and just run into
an ork and killed it.

103
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:52,531
- Here you go, honey. Wear it.
- Oh, how cute.

104
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:56,493
Yes, it brings out your eyes.
You have to see this also.

105
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,997
This is a real invisible body lotion.

106
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:03,250
I used it,
when I snuck into a harem.

107
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:06,045
Cool, right? Total chick magnet.

108
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:09,632
So you can't see
who is attacking you.

109
00:10:09,798 --> 00:10:12,885
What was that? Hey, there it is again.
And now it stopped.

110
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:16,722
- There it is again.
- Ouch, Gorak. Let me be.

111
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:20,851
- It will not stop.
- For God's sake, stop it!

112
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:23,980
Oh, Ronal, damn man.

113
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,100
All sons of Crane are here,
Prince Volcazar.

114
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,603
Then it's time.

115
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:28,920
- Can I take the watch for a bit?
- What about the feast?

116
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:32,466
I'm just kind of... a little tired.

117
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:36,928
Okay, then. Remember to blow the horn,
if you see something suspicious.

118
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:41,183
- Do you think you can handle that?
- I'm not an idiot.

119
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,269
- I want to be alone.
- It's a large horn.

120
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:48,982
Remember, breathe in.
Deep down in the stomach. And...

121
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,945
Damn, Uncle.
Who would attack us?

122
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,824
We're fucking barbarians.
We smash everything.

123
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,661
- We've never been attacked.
- That may well be.

124
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:04,206
But it's the principle,
which is important.

125
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:08,210
That boy will be the end of me one day.

126
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:13,632
QUEST-MAGAZINE

127
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,969
Fucking barbarians, man.

128
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,986
What the hell is this?

129
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:11,232
We're being attacked?
We're being attacked!

130
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:17,405
Get your weapons!

131
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,083
No, no!

132
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:32,796
- We're ready to attack!
- Let hell rain down.

133
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:39,428
Fuck! Fuck!

134
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:44,266
Fire!

135
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:50,814
Attack! Show no mercy!

136
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,989
- Look! Fireworks!
- Did we order that?

137
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:14,004
We're being attacked!
Barbarians, defend yourselves!

138
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,173
Hup, hup, hup!

139
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:26,767
Oh, thank heavens.
They're saved.

140
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:30,313
This is a mad, fucking sick party, man.

141
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:35,109
- Bummer!
- No!

142
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,573
Help! Help!

143
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:59,676
Punch! Smack!

144
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:02,887
Bash! Muscles!

145
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:21,656
I don't think
there are any more.

146
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:24,326
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

147
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:28,455
He's mine.

148
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:35,504
We're done for.
Why didn't you blow the horn?

149
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:38,090
- I tried!
- You tried?

150
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:41,426
"Trying" isn't good enough, Ronal.

151
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:43,971
Get up.
We must rescue the others.

152
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:04,491
The famous sons of Crane.

153
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:08,370
How pathetic.

154
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:13,542
Put them in chains.
Leave no one behind.

155
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:21,175
We Barbarians shall never surrender!

156
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:50,705
Everyone must bow to me...

157
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,627
No!

158
00:16:55,794 --> 00:16:57,712
...or die!

159
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,173
No!

160
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,552
- Take them away.
- You heard Prince Volcazar!

161
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:08,390
Get the last barbarians in the cart.
Come on!

162
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:11,268
Put him in! Move!

163
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:14,104
- Come here!
- No, I won't...

164
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:17,107
- In with them!
- What the hell?

165
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:19,693
Remember your shoes, bags... axes!

166
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,404
We will not come back
and get them!

167
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:25,907
General? This prisoner
doesn't fit in the shackles.

168
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:29,995
- Should I just throw him away?
- That's not a barbarian.

169
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:34,124
- Drag him over there and kill him.
- Oh, thank you.

170
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,377
- Lucky son of a bitch.
- He's always the one who get to do it.

171
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:42,216
- Kicking ass feels good
- Kicking ass feels good

172
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:47,679
- as a bonus, it is really nice
- as a bonus, it is really nice

173
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:51,016
sits well, feels good

174
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,856
No, I can't die. Help! Help!

175
00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:08,784
Shut up,
this is really exciting.

176
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:16,292
Oh, man. Shit, it's night, man.

177
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:20,046
My head, man.
The town is torn up, what happened?

178
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:23,507
Where did everyone go?

179
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:27,386
Did they go to the afterparty?
Hey you, wait!

180
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:45,738
Ro... Ronal.

181
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:49,826
Uncle. You're alive.

182
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:52,120
Not for long.

183
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,540
Crane... calls to me.

184
00:18:55,707 --> 00:19:00,295
No uncle,
it's probably just a... flesh wound.

185
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:04,799
Ronal when your parents died,
I swore to take care of you.

186
00:19:04,966 --> 00:19:10,347
And I've kept that promise.
But now, it's your turn to promise something.

187
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:15,185
Promise me that you will save the others.
You owe it to them.

188
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:19,356
- What? I can't save them.
- Promise me!

189
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:23,819
- But...
- Travel north to the oracle.

190
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:28,949
- He will help you.
- Oracle? How?

191
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:36,039
You are our only hope, Ronal.

192
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:39,293
The last of the barbarians.

193
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:46,592
Uncle? Uncle?

194
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:50,846
Uncle?

195
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:15,037
Gorak's invisibility lotion.

196
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:19,333
Yo.

197
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,380
- What happened? Going on a quest?
- Uh, no. I must find the others.

198
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:26,507
Well, okay.

199
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:31,345
- It's a quest. You are going on a quest!
- No. I have to find my people.

200
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:34,474
Awesome, this is a quest.
Wait a minute.

201
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,977
- Who are you?
- Hey. Alibert, the bard.

202
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:40,688
Damn nice to be joining you.

203
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:44,943
You can't say no;
I'll just follow you anyway.

204
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:49,239
Now we are on our way, shall we
go through the Amazon land?

205
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:53,201
- No.
- The girls down there would be lovely.

206
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:56,413
- We should investigate.
- Listen to me.

207
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,709
- Don't follow me.
- Those girls are super horny.

208
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,212
- No!
- Fuck, you're boring, man.

209
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:10,302
Now I know where we're going. We're headed
to Berylia. They have ladies with tails.

210
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:13,472
And four breasts!
This could be awesome, man!

211
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:17,350
- No, it's not.
- Come on. Why are we here?

212
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:22,731
- I need to talk to an oracle.
- Is that a kind of travel agent?

213
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:30,322
Sick crib.

214
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,665
Hello?

215
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:46,005
- Hello?
- It's about time.

216
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:49,550
I've been sitting here since last Wednesday.
Are you coming or what?

217
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:54,555
- Sorry, what?
- Heck, I need to be wiped.

218
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:57,016
You aren't the home care?

219
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,018
- No, we...
- Wait!

220
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,483
Gundar has sent me...

221
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:10,321
That's it. You came just in time.
And be careful with my hemorrhoids.

222
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:23,251
He is a mighty warlord, this Prince Volcazar
you're talking about.

223
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:27,171
dark forces from the underworld protect him.

224
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:33,761
I'm not really
interested in fighting him.

225
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:37,724
Volcazar is looking for power
throughout Metalonia.

226
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,561
So far, no one has
been able to stop him.

227
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:45,773
Wow.

228
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:15,387
He wears an impenetrable armor over
his body. No weapon can harm him.

229
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:20,225
Only one sword has the strength
to crush him.

230
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:22,436
Watch.

231
00:23:31,195 --> 00:23:35,157
- Oh, sick.
- What's so special about it?

232
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:40,662
It should be known to you, barbarian.
This is the sword of Crane.

233
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:48,712
That's a joke, right?

234
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:55,219
Honestly, it doesn't exist.
Everybody has been looking for the damn sword

235
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:58,681
for thousands of years,
and no one has found it.

236
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:01,350
It's just a silly story.

237
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:06,480
Crane's sword is not a myth.
Only it can harm Prince Volcazar.

238
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:10,901
You can never save your people
without killing him first.

239
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:12,570
But I can't...

240
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:17,491
Only a great warrior without fear
in his heart will be able to use it.

241
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,995
Without a great warrior
you will not defeat Volcazar.

242
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:25,374
And without a great warrior
your people are damned!

243
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:33,800
But I could be wrong.
I'm just an oracle.

244
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:39,180
It's not your fault the
barbarians were captured, is it?

245
00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:28,438
Gu'ra zul!

246
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:30,983
Wizard!

247
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:35,612
Lord, time is fast approaching.
The resurrection at temple must begin soon.

248
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:40,117
Or it will be impossible to carry out the ritual.
Have we caught the sons of Crane?

249
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:45,581
- The mission is complete.
- Fantastic. Now nothing can stop us.

250
00:25:45,748 --> 00:25:50,461
Mighty Zaal. The sons of Crane are assembled.

251
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:52,922
Awake from your slumber!

252
00:25:55,007 --> 00:25:57,718
What is happening?

253
00:25:57,885 --> 00:26:00,304
Finally.

254
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,984
- What?
- What now?

255
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,488
The mighty Zaal is not satisfied.
We're missing a Son of Crane.

256
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:21,826
- Impossible. Unless...
- I don't understand...

257
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:24,871
- We left none alive.
- Fool!

258
00:26:25,037 --> 00:26:30,335
I need the blood of all living
barbarians, and you let one escape.

259
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:35,715
- I don't understand.
- Find him for me. Now!

260
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:41,012
They are on a quest,
Alibert and Ronal

261
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:45,809
the greatest heroes
in Metalonia

262
00:26:45,975 --> 00:26:49,521
ooh-ooh
it's going so well

263
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:54,275
and the girls they say

264
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:57,153
Alibert you're so sexy

265
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,909
My village has been burned,
and I must find the sword of Crane.

266
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:07,455
Can't you be quiet, for God's sake,
so I can think?

267
00:27:09,124 --> 00:27:13,545
- I'll sing a barbarian song instead.
- For God's sake, no.

268
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:18,175
and Crane drew his proud sword
and drove with all his force

269
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:21,678
the blade deep in Zaal
and Zaal's skull burst

270
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:25,057
Wait a minute. The song.
What was it?

271
00:27:25,224 --> 00:27:27,267
"The Epic of Crane".

272
00:27:27,476 --> 00:27:31,104
There are 2073 verses,
and I know them all by heart.

273
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:33,982
Crane gets tons of pussy.

274
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:37,653
- Why didn't you say this before?
- That he gets pussy?

275
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,906
No, about the song. It's about Crane.

276
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:46,620
You just sang a verse about his sword.
Is there one that says where it is?

277
00:27:46,787 --> 00:27:51,166
from the chest of Crane the blood flowed
it bled day and night

278
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,836
No no. After he dies. Come on. Sing.

279
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:57,631
in his tomb was the sword placed,
the place is now forgotten

280
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:02,261
only the Book of Wisdom in Elfland
knows where it is.

281
00:28:02,428 --> 00:28:05,806
The Book of Wisdom in Elfland.
That's it.

282
00:28:05,973 --> 00:28:08,517
- We need to go to Elfland.
- What do you think?

283
00:28:08,684 --> 00:28:12,813
- This is how we find the sword!
- Elf girls are crazy sexy.

284
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,192
This will be a great quest.

285
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,197
Okay, I have two rules for the quest.
One: This is not a quest.

286
00:28:21,364 --> 00:28:27,495
And two: We see something that is even
the least bit unsafe, we go around.

287
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:30,206
- Is that a deal?
- Got it.

288
00:28:38,423 --> 00:28:42,594
Is it rule number one or two,
that we just violated?

289
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:46,014
Run for your life.

290
00:28:46,931 --> 00:28:50,226
Shit! What the hell happened?

291
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:00,070
What the hell did this?

292
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:16,128
No! No!

293
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:21,008
Ouch!

294
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:29,850
- Who are you? Are you one of them?
- My... my neck.

295
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:32,269
Answer me!

296
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:36,148
I'm just a random passer-by.
I swear.

297
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:39,777
It was not my intention
to disturb you in the middle of your...

298
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:44,740
- Slaughter of random men.
- They challenged me to a duel.

299
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:47,409
Oh no, not again.

300
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:57,628
Get out of here.
I'll let you live.

301
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:04,593
She is like, the warrior,
we need for the sword of Crane.

302
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,556
What? Are you insane?
She is a fucking violent psychopath.

303
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,767
- Yes, exactly... Ask her.
- No.

304
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:16,772
Wanker. Yo, beautiful. My friend Ronal
would like to ask you something.

305
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:19,776
We could use a killer like you

306
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:24,072
on our quest, you know.
In order to save his people.

307
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:30,912
And as a little bonus, I would
let you play my lute.

308
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,040
I don't know what he's talking about.

309
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:38,920
put your hand on my lute
and let me teach you to suck

310
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,340
I don't want to learn to play
your instrument.

311
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,594
- You are extremely uptight.
- I said it wasn't a good idea.

312
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,264
Another must rescue the barbarians.

313
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:53,184
- Did you say barbarians?
- Um, yes.

314
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,646
- The barbarians, those are your people?
- Uh, of course.

315
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,901
Those, that they say,
are the greatest warriors in Metalonia?

316
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,195
Yes.

317
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,532
That's a worthy cause.
I'll go with you.

318
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,284
What?

319
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,537
I'm Zandra from the shield maiden clan.

320
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,290
- Where are you headed?
- Elfland.

321
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:18,585
- We need to find out where it is.
- We will need a guide.

322
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:22,923
- There is a town nearby. Come.
- No, wait. You can't just...

323
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,635
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Now... uh, no.

324
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:32,057
- Super. Come.
- I swear, you scored her, man.

325
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:47,031
Son of Crane! Son of Crane!

326
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,994
Come on! Faster!

327
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,181
Oh, cool.

328
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:22,567
Shave my legs and call me Susan,
if this is not the coolest place.

329
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:28,281
- Okay, we're here.
- Uh, okay.

330
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,783
What's up, assholes?

331
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,829
Can I trouble one of you
to call me a taxi?

332
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:37,874
- Fuck.
- Sweet. It's happy hour.

333
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,461
There are a lot in there today.
Stay behind me.

334
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:45,215
We'll enter quietly,
find a guide

335
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:48,468
and then leave
before anyone notices us.

336
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,763
And without a fight, okay?

337
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:56,142
Please?

338
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,688
- As you wish.
- Thank you.

339
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:06,903
Bing, bing-li-bing-bing.
In your ass.

340
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:19,082
Son of Crane! Son of Crane!

341
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:24,004
So I said to her: "Your breasts
look tired. Should I hold them?"

342
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:27,674
Your mother has always
had the largest tits.

343
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:32,471
Hey! Hey! Stop that, buddy.

344
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:36,058
I'll tell you.
She was angry, man.

345
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:40,813
You can't win them all.
But you can try.

346
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:51,574
- What do you want?
- We're looking for a guide.

347
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:58,122
There is only one left. Down by the
bathroom. Ask for Elric.

348
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:02,126
Hey, who ordered a pint
and a double Manhattan?

349
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:03,920
Okay. Thanks.

350
00:34:11,594 --> 00:34:14,597
Uh, hey. Uh, are you Elric?

351
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:18,768
The voice of the wind
lights the evening sun's embrace.

352
00:34:18,935 --> 00:34:23,523
Stellar Children,
great Mother Sun now rests.

353
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,777
The darkness comes as a
pensive sigh.

354
00:34:29,237 --> 00:34:33,157
I sensed you would come.
We elves are connected with all living things.

355
00:34:33,324 --> 00:34:36,536
Let our souls meet.

356
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:41,708
You bear the dreams of an eagle
and the will of a mouse.

357
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:46,838
Mighty blood dwells in your heart.
Kormamin lindua ka'elja.

358
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:51,676
Yes, that sounds exciting. My name is
Ronal, and I have some place...

359
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,143
Names have no meaning.

360
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,315
- I need...
- Spiritual or physical guidance?

361
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:07,776
We need to find Elfland.

362
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:12,322
The wind's voice shall tell me,
whether I should help you. Stand still!

363
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:18,579
Let me penetrate your aura.
Kormamin lindua ka'elja.

364
00:35:18,787 --> 00:35:21,456
Kormamin lindua...

365
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:27,045
The wind says, I shall follow you.
My bow will sing with your sword.

366
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,216
Okay...

367
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:36,764
Damn.

368
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:40,726
- Hey, I found him.
- My bow will sing with your sword.

369
00:35:40,893 --> 00:35:43,854
Yes. Come, let's get out of here.

370
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:49,568
Hey, shield maiden, you're leaving already?

371
00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:53,030
What do you say to a little dance?

372
00:35:59,245 --> 00:36:02,957
Hey, guys, sorry,
we were just leaving.

373
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:07,170
- I accept your challenge.
- What?

374
00:36:07,336 --> 00:36:09,714
He must defeat me or die.

375
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:13,551
- We shouldn't create any problems.
- He challenged me.

376
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:17,346
You promised. In and out, without fighting.

377
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:21,643
Okay. So, you take care of it yourself.

378
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:25,063
Hey, shield maiden, what's it gonna be?

379
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:27,273
Listen...

380
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,778
Friend, I know,
it's super cool to fight,

381
00:36:31,945 --> 00:36:38,451
but we're in a bit of a hurry and there
are probably plenty of others here

382
00:36:38,618 --> 00:36:42,914
so if it's okay with you,
I think we'll just leave.

383
00:36:48,962 --> 00:36:52,173
- Zandra!
- Not supposed to fight.

384
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:58,889
That'll make a nice soup base.

385
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:03,101
Learn to ride!

386
00:37:07,814 --> 00:37:11,026
Have you seen this before?
I can teach you to play it.

387
00:37:11,193 --> 00:37:14,029
Does it make you horny?

388
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:20,202
I sense much aggression in the room.

389
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:26,750
Any last words, chump?

390
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:30,045
- He's dead.
- What the hell?

391
00:37:30,212 --> 00:37:33,007
I'm gonna make you pay
for throwing up on me.

392
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:37,636
- Now you're gonna get a new asshole.
- That's enough. Let him be.

393
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:47,188
Black Riders.

394
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:01,369
Son of Crane! Son of Crane!

395
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:04,622
- Take him!
- No! Help!

396
00:38:10,128 --> 00:38:12,004
Zandra!

397
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:17,510
Nobody stands up to Prince
Volcazar's riders and lives!

398
00:38:19,595 --> 00:38:22,015
It's gonna explode!

399
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:23,975
Move!

400
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:33,985
Hey! Who is it that ordered
the double Manhattan?

401
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:36,613
Ouch, my ass!

402
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,864
110% ALCOHOL

403
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:39,282
Goddamn!

404
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:57,968
Fabulous, my lord. One more shot,
and then you've beaten the record.

405
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:02,723
But we have to find the last
Son of Crane before the next full moon.

406
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:06,852
- You're ruining my concentration.
- I'm sorry.

407
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:13,734
- Hello?
- He escaped, sir.

408
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:18,447
The task is more difficult than we thought.
He has the help of a strong warrior.

409
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:21,283
We'll need reinforcements.

410
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,078
I will not tolerate any more failures!

411
00:39:24,244 --> 00:39:27,998
Bring them to me. Both of them.

412
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,723
Do you know where we are?
It seems like we're going in circles.

413
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:49,311
The wind speaks to my soul.
We will soon be in the elvish realm.

414
00:39:49,478 --> 00:39:53,441
You said that two days ago.
We're lost, damn it.

415
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:55,693
We're gonna die of thirst.

416
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,821
- Ha.
- What's so funny?

417
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:03,242
I have heard that barbarians are strong and
quick to fight, but you're neither.

418
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:06,162
You just bitch and whine.

419
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:09,916
It's really funny when you consider
the heritage you come from.

420
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:13,711
Why are you with us
if you think all I do is whine?

421
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,964
- What's your deal with the barbarians?
- None of your business.

422
00:40:17,131 --> 00:40:19,884
Stop! See.

423
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,101
- And that means...?
- We elves can communicate with everything.

424
00:40:28,268 --> 00:40:32,981
I will unite myself with its soul
and get it to show us the way.

425
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:40,864
Kormamin lindua ka'elja.

426
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:43,617
Kormamin lindua...

427
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:47,621
Ouch! My beautiful elf lip!

428
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:04,638
There. On the other side. There is no
labyrinth on the other side.

429
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:11,353
The entrance to Elfland.

430
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,189
I did it.

431
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,410
Elf gate, I greet you.

432
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:31,874
You didn't know it was here?

433
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:56,023
- Oh! Wild!
- Come on.

434
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:00,570
Stop! First, our souls are weighed
by the Gate Keepers.

435
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:07,660
Only those with the right character
may be allowed to go through.

436
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:10,997
What about those
who do not have the right character?

437
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:14,500
Who? Well.
They are crushed by the rock wall.

438
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:18,087
- Well, shall we go?
- I can't.

439
00:42:18,254 --> 00:42:21,883
- What?
- I'm a miserable barbarian.

440
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,761
I don't have
the right character.

441
00:42:24,928 --> 00:42:29,808
- You've misunderstood the meaning.
- Forget it. We'll go around.

442
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:33,103
When you're on a quest,
follow the guide.

443
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:36,981
The only thing we get out of that,
is being killed.

444
00:42:37,148 --> 00:42:41,361
But now you call it a quest,
so, remember that it is my quest.

445
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:45,866
And I've decided that we go around
this ridiculous gate. Come on!

446
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:58,712
See. No booby traps, no gates,
nothing.

447
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:03,759
This quest-nonsense is so predictable.
If you just think a bit outside...

448
00:43:10,807 --> 00:43:14,311
- Ouch, my tailbone, man.
- What the hell was that?

449
00:43:14,478 --> 00:43:18,273
We have offended the Gate Keepers.
I sense...

450
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,734
...great danger!

451
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:23,070
Run!

452
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:30,703
Faster!

453
00:43:33,998 --> 00:43:36,041
Ronal!

454
00:43:40,504 --> 00:43:42,131
Come!

455
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:51,974
Ouch, man.

456
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:55,895
Fool! Your stupid idea almost
got us all killed.

457
00:43:56,062 --> 00:44:00,441
I just tried
to steer us away from trouble.

458
00:44:00,608 --> 00:44:04,779
You tried? Well, "trying"
isn't good enough, Ronal.

459
00:44:04,946 --> 00:44:08,324
On any quest there's bound to be problems.

460
00:44:08,491 --> 00:44:11,786
Solve them instead of going around.

461
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:25,341
There's the Temple of the Elves.

462
00:44:25,508 --> 00:44:29,345
The focal point
of all wisdom in the world.

463
00:44:32,348 --> 00:44:36,227
The Book of Wisdom lies
in the tower's upper chamber

464
00:44:37,437 --> 00:44:41,233
so the moon can read it
on his voyage across the night sky.

465
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:44,402
It is the holiest of holy books.

466
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:48,031
- So we'll just go on up and grab it.
- Quiet!

467
00:44:48,198 --> 00:44:49,908
Look.

468
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:56,748
No one from the outside is allowed in.
The King's archers have eyes like hawks.

469
00:45:08,302 --> 00:45:11,388
- Shit.
- They kill everything they see.

470
00:45:22,941 --> 00:45:27,112
So we'll have to do it the hard way.
I'll take these two.

471
00:45:27,279 --> 00:45:29,907
No.

472
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:32,326
- I'll do it.
- What?

473
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:34,620
Alone.

474
00:45:34,787 --> 00:45:38,040
Think about it. They'll kill you,
as soon as they see you.

475
00:45:38,207 --> 00:45:40,251
I know,

476
00:45:40,418 --> 00:45:43,671
they're not going to see me.

477
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:48,259
There isn't much left
and I'm the smallest. Wait here.

478
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:52,513
I could have used
that in high school.

479
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,892
How do I look? Invisible, right?

480
00:45:58,728 --> 00:46:01,564
- What?
- You missed a spot.

481
00:46:04,067 --> 00:46:07,236
Fuck! It's empty.
Fuck, so typical.

482
00:46:07,403 --> 00:46:11,908
Relax, Ronal. They're small dumplings,
nobody will notice.

483
00:46:12,075 --> 00:46:15,954
- Wait here.
- Good luck, Ronal. Don't get killed.

484
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:22,252
Ouch!

485
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:29,676
"I have a headache," "I'm tired"
"The kids will wake up!"... blah, blah, blah.

486
00:46:29,843 --> 00:46:32,512
Having such a wife is a bummer, man.

487
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:34,055
Bitch!

488
00:46:34,222 --> 00:46:35,598
Ouch!

489
00:46:35,765 --> 00:46:37,892
Who's there?

490
00:46:42,189 --> 00:46:45,108
Hmm, nothing there.

491
00:46:45,275 --> 00:46:49,738
- Where were we? Are you ready for this Saturday?
- Are you crazy? I was born ready!

492
00:46:49,905 --> 00:46:53,617
- Hell yeah!
- I must be a crazy psycho!

493
00:47:05,087 --> 00:47:07,256
That's open.

494
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:14,596
Ouch!

495
00:47:28,569 --> 00:47:31,488
Fuck, I'm in bad shape.

496
00:47:51,425 --> 00:47:53,845
Oh!

497
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:01,936
Ah!

498
00:48:07,942 --> 00:48:10,778
Cursed rats!

499
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,707
Oh!

500
00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:34,052
Wow. There it is.

501
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,938
So where is it?
Sword of Crane

502
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:49,359
Sword of Crane,
how the hell do I find the Sword of Crane?

503
00:48:50,902 --> 00:48:52,529
There it is.

504
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,658
The Sword of Crane.
Well, that was easy enough.

505
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:01,038
It's like no one
can see me.

506
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:09,338
- A killer rat!
- Kill the rat!

507
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:13,175
Use the poisoned arrows.

508
00:49:14,927 --> 00:49:16,220
After it!

509
00:49:17,971 --> 00:49:20,766
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

510
00:49:22,851 --> 00:49:25,229
Faster!
Shoot it down!

511
00:49:26,939 --> 00:49:30,192
- Ow, damn it!
- Yes! The pig is down!

512
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,582
Well, how much
are you gonna drink?

513
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:48,920
- Nothing. I'll smoke instead.
- Did you get Elrond's mother's weed?

514
00:50:13,987 --> 00:50:15,780
Ouch.

515
00:50:19,367 --> 00:50:25,248
The page says that Crane was
buried in the Eternal Mountain.

516
00:50:25,415 --> 00:50:28,877
My elfin soul feels,
that it is far, far away...

517
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:31,254
Isn't that it right there?

518
00:50:31,421 --> 00:50:35,425
...that it is nearby.
Destiny is on our side.

519
00:50:35,592 --> 00:50:37,761
Ouch.

520
00:50:37,928 --> 00:50:39,387
No more.

521
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:44,810
- I was wrong about you.
- What?

522
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:47,854
There in the temple. You did it.

523
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:51,858
Yes, more or less in any case.
You make the barbarians proud.

524
00:50:52,943 --> 00:50:55,153
Uh. Thanks.

525
00:50:56,905 --> 00:51:00,617
Well, um... I have to
polish my axe.

526
00:51:00,784 --> 00:51:03,161
I was thinking...

527
00:51:03,328 --> 00:51:06,915
I've never really said...

528
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:10,711
thank you for coming with me.

529
00:51:10,878 --> 00:51:15,049
Actually, I don't know how I would
have made it this far without you.

530
00:51:15,215 --> 00:51:17,801
Uh... okay.

531
00:51:19,303 --> 00:51:24,892
Well, we'd better get some sleep.
Maybe we'll find the Sword of Crane tomorrow.

532
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:29,730
I'll keep watch. We elves need
no sleep. You can sleep safely.

533
00:51:30,689 --> 00:51:35,778
- Can I ask you something, Ronal?
- Uh, yes, of course.

534
00:51:35,945 --> 00:51:38,781
What are the barbarians like?

535
00:51:38,948 --> 00:51:42,743
- They're not very clever.
- I thought more...

536
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:45,871
What are they like in here?

537
00:51:47,164 --> 00:51:49,709
Well.

538
00:51:49,876 --> 00:51:51,627
Uh.

539
00:51:51,794 --> 00:51:56,716
A barbarian is always ready to help
those that need it.

540
00:51:56,883 --> 00:52:01,429
Regardless of how dangerous or difficult.
And they go on quests all the time.

541
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:06,684
They're not afraid of anything.
Hard to believe I'm one of them, right?

542
00:52:06,851 --> 00:52:11,940
- And they're great warriors?
- Yep. The best in the world.

543
00:52:12,106 --> 00:52:15,693
It's just so difficult
to find a proper warrior.

544
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,196
Yeah. Uh, what?

545
00:52:18,363 --> 00:52:22,200
I come from an ancient clan of shield maidens.

546
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:25,036
Far, far away from here.

547
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:31,293
Our religion requires that I only
marry the warrior that can defeat me.

548
00:52:35,964 --> 00:52:38,925
Many have tried to defeat me

549
00:52:39,092 --> 00:52:41,261
but I'm too strong.

550
00:52:41,428 --> 00:52:45,849
And for every duel I won,
I just got stronger.

551
00:52:46,016 --> 00:52:50,103
Meanwhile, I could only watch as
the others found themselves a mate.

552
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:54,566
One by one. Eventually I was
the only one left.

553
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:59,321
It took longer and longer
for anyone to challenge me.

554
00:52:59,488 --> 00:53:03,450
Then the suitors just stopped coming.

555
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:06,870
The head of the clan became impatient.

556
00:53:07,037 --> 00:53:12,292
They told me to go forth, into
the world, to find a worthy husband.

557
00:53:12,459 --> 00:53:16,255
A warrior with the strength
to defeat me.

558
00:53:18,257 --> 00:53:22,344
If I am defeated, I must
obey his slightest command.

559
00:53:22,511 --> 00:53:25,472
There have been none,
who are strong enough.

560
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:30,686
But everywhere I've been, it is said,
barbarians are the strongest warriors,

561
00:53:30,853 --> 00:53:34,315
so maybe a barbarian from
your village can defeat me.

562
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:38,194
- That's why I went with you.
- Uh... Okay.

563
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:40,696
- Okay, what?
- Well, that's...

564
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:44,867
What you just said,
what does it have to do with love?

565
00:53:45,034 --> 00:53:49,997
It will be love that defeats me.
I've waited so long.

566
00:53:51,374 --> 00:53:54,377
Wow.

567
00:53:54,544 --> 00:53:59,340
I've never told this to anyone before.

568
00:53:59,507 --> 00:54:04,762
It feels so... nice.

569
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:15,440
You know what, Ronal?
It's actually nice talking to you.

570
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,194
You're so lovely.

571
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,697
- Uh, to talk with, I mean.
- Well.

572
00:54:22,864 --> 00:54:28,119
And if I had meant it the
other way, we'd have to fight.

573
00:54:28,286 --> 00:54:33,708
- No, I wouldn't be so fortunate.
- Yeah, that would be a little strange.

574
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:40,340
- What was that?
- I don't know.

575
00:54:40,507 --> 00:54:43,885
Hey, Elric.

576
00:54:46,054 --> 00:54:48,724
Elves do not sleep.

577
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:54,688
- What is it, what's making that sound?
- I sense a terrible voice.

578
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:03,822
No one escapes Prince Volcazar's anger!

579
00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:05,949
Ronal, watch out!

580
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:09,828
Zandra!

581
00:55:15,709 --> 00:55:19,088
- Curses!
- Ronal, wait for me!

582
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:32,601
Ronal!

583
00:55:32,768 --> 00:55:34,770
Oh, fuck!

584
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,790
Shit!

585
00:55:58,127 --> 00:55:59,962
They're gone.

586
00:56:00,129 --> 00:56:03,007
Damn! Let's move!

587
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:06,844
Zandra!

588
00:56:09,222 --> 00:56:12,100
- No, no, no.
- We'll find her.

589
00:56:12,267 --> 00:56:15,854
If we go now, we can find them.
Come.

590
00:56:19,023 --> 00:56:22,318
- What did you do?
- It wasn't me.

591
00:56:27,365 --> 00:56:29,284
The Amazons.

592
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,099
- It stuck.
- Congratulations, honey.

593
00:56:52,266 --> 00:56:56,728
can't get too much sun.

594
00:56:56,895 --> 00:57:00,315
See my new shoes.
Aren't they fantastic?

595
00:57:00,482 --> 00:57:03,986
- It's only women.
- I've died and gone to heaven.

596
00:57:06,029 --> 00:57:10,284
- Hey, girls. What's going on?
- What's that?

597
00:57:10,451 --> 00:57:15,164
- Oh, totally botched stomach pouch.
- Hello. Good to see you.

598
00:57:24,673 --> 00:57:28,219
High Queen, we've captured
these women in the jungle.

599
00:57:28,386 --> 00:57:32,765
We have brought them to you,
so you can decide their fate.

600
00:57:32,932 --> 00:57:35,810
Stand them up. Let me see.

601
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:53,953
What remarkable women.
I've never seen anything like it.

602
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,873
- What's this?
- Ow!

603
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,085
- One even has hair on his chin.
- How clumsy!

604
00:58:01,252 --> 00:58:05,048
- High Queen.
- Quiet, ugly girl.

605
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:09,302
- Who asked you to speak?
- We're not women.

606
00:58:09,469 --> 00:58:14,224
- Well, we're men, you know?
- Men?

607
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,936
- Or nearly so.
- Men?

608
00:58:21,147 --> 00:58:27,862
Heaven be praised. The gods have heard
our prayers and sent us two men.

609
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:34,536
Finally, the time has come,
when we can grow our tribe.

610
00:58:34,703 --> 00:58:38,123
Take them to the sacred mating cabins.

611
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:41,460
- What?
- What!

612
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:53,055
We'll take the thin one first.
And save him for tomorrow.

613
00:58:53,222 --> 00:58:56,016
No, help.
No, I won't!

614
00:58:57,935 --> 00:59:02,398
Honestly, man. Why can't it be me.
I'd be more than willing to do it.

615
00:59:02,564 --> 00:59:05,609
That's so fucking typical.

616
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:09,238
No!

617
00:59:17,037 --> 00:59:20,040
- Lord.
- You have them?

618
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:24,670
We have caught the warrior who
helped the barbarian escape.

619
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:40,728
Let me see.

620
00:59:42,897 --> 00:59:45,149
A shield maiden.

621
00:59:45,942 --> 00:59:51,447
- And a very sexy one.
- Give me a weapon and let me fight.

622
00:59:51,614 --> 00:59:54,367
In time.

623
00:59:56,661 --> 00:59:59,747
No one lays a hand on me without suffering.

624
00:59:59,914 --> 01:00:02,584
So die then!

625
01:00:46,003 --> 01:00:51,049
Impressive.
You are my type of woman.

626
01:00:51,216 --> 01:00:55,095
Too bad I have to kill you!

627
01:01:13,822 --> 01:01:15,658
What?

628
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:25,000
Foolish woman.

629
01:01:42,977 --> 01:01:49,025
I know your rules, shield maiden.
You must obey me now.

630
01:01:50,735 --> 01:01:53,446
It is your destiny.

631
01:01:53,613 --> 01:01:56,324
You have defeated me.

632
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,457
Single piercing is not cool.

633
01:02:04,624 --> 01:02:06,835
Double piercing is the shit.

634
01:02:17,637 --> 01:02:20,599
Yes! It's about time.
Is it my turn?

635
01:02:20,765 --> 01:02:23,852
The ceremony is over.
We will use you tomorrow.

636
01:02:24,019 --> 01:02:27,189
- What? Tomorrow?
- It's the Queen's order.

637
01:02:27,355 --> 01:02:31,568
Come back!
I want to be abused!

638
01:02:33,153 --> 01:02:35,989
- Did you remember to lock the door?
- Of course.

639
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:41,161
Hey, what are you doing?

640
01:02:43,163 --> 01:02:46,833
- We have to leave.
- What about all the Amazons?

641
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,671
Zandra is in danger. We must find
the Sword of Crane and help her.

642
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:54,383
- That can wait a week.
- We can't leave her behind.

643
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:58,262
- We can find another warrior?
- I want Zandra!

644
01:02:58,429 --> 01:03:02,766
Hey, you didn't want
her help to start with.

645
01:03:02,975 --> 01:03:07,688
Fuck you! I'll be right here
making sweet love with hot babes.

646
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:11,317
That's the only reason
I came on this quest.

647
01:03:11,483 --> 01:03:16,655
Oh, I forgot. You're not on a quest.
You're just fucking boring.

648
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:20,284
Fine. Stay here.

649
01:03:21,911 --> 01:03:25,331
You're not any help anyway.

650
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:39,220
Oh, I just love that song.

651
01:03:44,058 --> 01:03:47,729
Damn! Fucking shit!

652
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:03,953
Oh, what the fuck am I doing, man?
Ronal, I'm coming.

653
01:04:13,755 --> 01:04:18,593
- Madam Queen?
- I just had to see you.

654
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:24,432
Ever since I saw you the first time,
my body trembles with longing.

655
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:28,854
I know it's against the rules,
but I must have you.

656
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:33,775
- If I may...
- I cannot control myself. Take me!

657
01:04:33,942 --> 01:04:36,528
Take me! Oh! Yes!

658
01:04:42,868 --> 01:04:45,495
Take me!

659
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:47,998
Stop!

660
01:04:48,165 --> 01:04:52,252
Unfortunately I can't, Madam Queen.
My friend needs me.

661
01:04:52,461 --> 01:04:53,545
What?

662
01:04:53,712 --> 01:04:57,132
Perhaps I can be taken prisoner again
on the way back.

663
01:04:57,299 --> 01:04:59,927
Alarm!

664
01:05:04,306 --> 01:05:09,520
- Pigs! Men are pigs!
- Insane bitches, man!

665
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:16,694
- He was your responsibility!
- And I locked the door!

666
01:05:16,861 --> 01:05:20,197
Hang him by his balls!

667
01:05:35,296 --> 01:05:36,881
Elric?

668
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:42,322
It's the first barbarians.

669
01:06:50,456 --> 01:06:52,416
Wow.

670
01:06:57,713 --> 01:07:00,049
Hello.

671
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:05,262
I need your sword.
I'll take good care of it.

672
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:14,271
That was easy. Wow.

673
01:07:23,114 --> 01:07:25,825
Yeah. I apologize.

674
01:07:33,457 --> 01:07:35,793
Zandra.

675
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,753
I'm sorry.

676
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,550
Time after time you escaped
my best riders, barbarian.

677
01:07:42,717 --> 01:07:47,972
And then we find you up here, just as
my shield maiden said we would.

678
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:55,438
The Sword of Crane. The only weapon
in the world that can harm you.

679
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:57,106
Zandra?

680
01:07:57,273 --> 01:08:02,153
Excellent. You've served me well.

681
01:08:03,863 --> 01:08:08,159
- As you have commanded me, lord.
- What the hell is going on?

682
01:08:10,745 --> 01:08:17,043
Lets move! We have to get this
barbarian to my wizard.

683
01:08:34,353 --> 01:08:37,814
I sense, that Ronal is in great danger.

684
01:08:44,071 --> 01:08:48,742
- Do what you must, wizard.
- With pleasure, Lord.

685
01:08:48,909 --> 01:08:51,870
- Ronal?
- Gorak?

686
01:09:03,299 --> 01:09:06,010
- Here he is.
- No, no, no!

687
01:09:12,183 --> 01:09:17,480
Finally! Mighty Zaal,
listen to your humble servant!

688
01:09:17,646 --> 01:09:21,525
The blood has been collected from the Sons of Crane.

689
01:09:21,692 --> 01:09:25,488
Grant us access to your temple!

690
01:09:33,996 --> 01:09:36,457
What are you doing?

691
01:09:36,624 --> 01:09:42,255
Only once every ten thousand years, is it
possible for Zaal, ruler of the underworld

692
01:09:42,422 --> 01:09:49,554
to come to our world.
I offer the ultimate sacrifice.

693
01:09:49,721 --> 01:09:55,018
The sons of the warrior, who sent
him from this world.

694
01:09:55,185 --> 01:10:01,024
And as a reward he will bestow upon me
his divine power.

695
01:10:01,191 --> 01:10:05,111
All will bow to me

696
01:10:05,278 --> 01:10:07,739
or die!

697
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:23,463
Shit. We can't go any further
without being noticed.

698
01:11:03,587 --> 01:11:05,381
Ronal!

699
01:11:05,548 --> 01:11:10,010
What the hell's the matter with you?
Come on! Lift your feet!

700
01:11:10,177 --> 01:11:12,847
Come on! Get up the stairs!

701
01:11:13,806 --> 01:11:15,850
Wait here.

702
01:11:20,104 --> 01:11:22,440
- Ronal.
- Alibert!

703
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:25,693
- What?
- Take it easy.

704
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,279
Keep moving, you wretch.

705
01:11:29,947 --> 01:11:32,867
Ronal, where's the Sword of Crane?

706
01:11:33,034 --> 01:11:38,289
There's nothing you can do.
It's on the altar below. Get away from here.

707
01:11:55,932 --> 01:12:00,145
I will not be satisfied,
until they scream like the pigs they are!

708
01:12:05,108 --> 01:12:09,613
Mighty Zaal we give to you the
blood from the Sons of Crane.

709
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:12,991
Let your darkness bless us.

710
01:12:15,619 --> 01:12:18,538
Soon I will be mightier than a god

711
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:22,793
and you shall be my queen
in the after life.

712
01:12:35,681 --> 01:12:38,141
Hey! What are you doing here?

713
01:12:38,976 --> 01:12:41,937
- Uh...
- Kill him.

714
01:12:42,104 --> 01:12:45,899
No, wait. I am master Alibert.

715
01:12:46,066 --> 01:12:48,444
The bard!

716
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:53,574
I'm here to play at the feast...
the occult ritual.

717
01:12:53,741 --> 01:12:56,285
Here's a song you might know.

718
01:12:57,328 --> 01:13:00,623
your muscles they make me crazy

719
01:13:00,789 --> 01:13:04,168
on the dance floor you can see it

720
01:13:04,335 --> 01:13:07,338
your skull charm it makes me hot

721
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:11,801
little cuddles sweet treasure

722
01:13:13,552 --> 01:13:16,722
- Shut up, that's crap.
- Oh!

723
01:13:16,889 --> 01:13:20,184
- Later.
- Come back, you little shit!

724
01:13:23,896 --> 01:13:27,650
Let the Chosen One step forward!

725
01:13:40,246 --> 01:13:42,915
- Hey, Ronal.
- The Sword of Crane.

726
01:13:43,082 --> 01:13:45,919
- I'll set you free.
- We must liberate the others.

727
01:13:46,085 --> 01:13:49,756
- I'm hurrying as fast as I can.
- What the hell?

728
01:13:57,055 --> 01:14:00,683
Drop it, pip-squeak.
You don't have a chance.

729
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:03,895
Come on. Give me your best shot.

730
01:14:11,111 --> 01:14:13,738
Very nice. It was really...

731
01:14:19,995 --> 01:14:23,206
- What the hell?
- Sorry.

732
01:14:23,373 --> 01:14:32,841
What?

733
01:14:40,432 --> 01:14:43,435
I've totally been looking forward to this!

734
01:14:51,276 --> 01:14:53,362
Oh yeah!

735
01:15:00,786 --> 01:15:03,080
- Kill them.
- But...

736
01:15:03,247 --> 01:15:05,583
- That's an order!
- Zandra!

737
01:15:05,749 --> 01:15:10,671
You belong to me, shield maiden!
Don't forget.

738
01:15:10,838 --> 01:15:13,215
Yes, my Lord.

739
01:15:21,682 --> 01:15:24,685
- Ronal.
- You don't have to do this.

740
01:15:24,852 --> 01:15:29,148
Volcazar has defeated me in a duel.
It is my destiny.

741
01:15:40,743 --> 01:15:43,496
Zandra, it's me.

742
01:15:43,663 --> 01:15:47,750
This is completely ridiculous.
Is this really your destiny

743
01:15:47,917 --> 01:15:50,920
to kill the only one,
who loves you,

744
01:15:51,087 --> 01:15:55,467
just because some maniac
has beaten you in a fight?

745
01:16:00,555 --> 01:16:02,599
Watch out!

746
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,393
Ronal!

747
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:08,939
Zandra.

748
01:16:17,989 --> 01:16:20,158
Let me go!

749
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:31,086
Lord, drink it up,
before it's too late.

750
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:37,050
Clever Lord. Drink it all up.

751
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,058
Oh, shit.

752
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,981
Die!

753
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,611
No!

754
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:24,307
The darkness must be awakened in Metalonia.

755
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:29,479
The sound of screams
must rise to the sky.

756
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:33,608
All must bow to me

757
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:36,486
or die!

758
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:56,256
Fuck!

759
01:18:00,552 --> 01:18:04,639
The Epic of Crane! "Crane drew his proud sword
and drove with all his force

760
01:18:04,806 --> 01:18:08,810
the blade deep into Zaal
and Zaal's skull burst."

761
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:13,482
You have to strike him in the forehead.
It is his weak point, man!

762
01:18:16,485 --> 01:18:18,820
That's impossible!

763
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:28,705
There's nothing you can do here.
Save yourself!

764
01:18:28,914 --> 01:18:32,167
- What?
- This is no place for you.

765
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:34,002
Run!

766
01:18:34,169 --> 01:18:38,298
No. I'm done running away.

767
01:18:42,636 --> 01:18:45,597
Now you better behave yourself.

768
01:18:49,393 --> 01:18:52,438
Yes, do it! Stab him in the forehead!

769
01:18:55,482 --> 01:18:58,110
- In the forehead.
- What do you think I'm trying to do?

770
01:18:58,277 --> 01:19:02,156
I'll crush you like a bug!

771
01:19:10,414 --> 01:19:12,708
He's fucking dead.

772
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,794
Oh, damn!

773
01:19:19,048 --> 01:19:23,302
May my aim be sharp as a hawk's
and as perfect as the great breast.

774
01:19:32,895 --> 01:19:35,481
Stand still!

775
01:19:44,949 --> 01:19:46,826
No!

776
01:19:48,453 --> 01:19:50,497
Now I have you!

777
01:19:52,874 --> 01:19:54,709
Eat lute, you bitch!

778
01:20:18,525 --> 01:20:20,986
No, no. No!

779
01:20:29,578 --> 01:20:36,126
- Zandra!
- My queen! Kill these fleas.

780
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:50,641
What are you doing? Your honor commands
you to serve me!

781
01:20:50,808 --> 01:20:53,352
No! No more!

782
01:20:54,687 --> 01:20:57,690
Then die!

783
01:21:06,824 --> 01:21:08,451
Zandra!

784
01:21:08,617 --> 01:21:13,539
Okay, guys, let's show them
how barbarians really fight!

785
01:21:20,129 --> 01:21:21,881
Gorak!

786
01:21:27,011 --> 01:21:29,514
- Come on, guys!
- Muscles!

787
01:21:34,644 --> 01:21:38,773
I am invincible!

788
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:54,706
- What?
- This one's for Uncle Gundar!

789
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,879
Uh?

790
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:27,573
Holy shit.
My g-string is so high up my ass.

791
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,701
Ronal?

792
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:37,791
Ronal!

793
01:22:42,504 --> 01:22:44,381
Oh no.

794
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:03,150
Here lies Ronal.
The greatest barbarian of us all.

795
01:23:27,008 --> 01:23:31,137
- What happened?
- Damn, he lives, man!

796
01:23:34,432 --> 01:23:37,644
I sense great love.

797
01:23:38,478 --> 01:23:40,396
It's so beautiful.

798
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:47,779
I haven't challenged you
to a duel, right?

799
01:23:47,987 --> 01:23:49,489
You...

800
01:23:49,656 --> 01:23:53,702
You have already
conquered my heart, Ronal.

801
01:23:56,579 --> 01:23:58,623
Now it becomes cheesy.

802
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:02,794
It's time for ale and lager,
ale and lager.

803
01:24:02,961 --> 01:24:06,047
Ale and lager, ale and lager.

804
01:24:13,013 --> 01:24:15,140
You wanna see something sick?

805
01:24:15,307 --> 01:24:17,184
Wow!

806
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:21,021
Cool.

807
01:24:21,188 --> 01:24:25,776
- Oh, that's good.
- I sense much tension in your muscles.

808
01:24:25,943 --> 01:24:29,279
I've been tied up on
a cross all week.

809
01:24:29,446 --> 01:24:33,534
Just shut up, man.
I want to say something important.

810
01:24:35,202 --> 01:24:38,914
To Ronal, the thirstiest barbarian in the world.

811
01:24:40,374 --> 01:24:42,376
Cheers!

812
01:24:42,543 --> 01:24:47,423
- Why the hell aren't you drinking?
- Fucking barbarians...

813
01:25:00,644 --> 01:25:12,198
Ronal the Barbarian

814
01:25:12,365 --> 01:25:18,371
<i>oh, he was a weak boy
lacked a pair of balls</i>

815
01:25:18,538 --> 01:25:24,460
<i>he wasn't pierced at all</i>

816
01:25:24,627 --> 01:25:30,675
<i>oh, he was a geek boy
with a chest so small</i>

817
01:25:46,024 --> 01:25:48,985
<i>big balls hairy balls</i>

818
01:25:49,152 --> 01:25:52,030
<i>hard balls hot babes</i>

819

<i>hairy babes yummy babes</i>

820
01:25:55,325 --> 01:25:59,204
<i>yummy balls and oily muscles too</i>

821
01:26:04,584 --> 01:26:20,976
<i>Ronal the Barbarian he rules</i>

822
01:26:28,025 --> 01:26:30,778
<i>big balls hairy balls</i>

823
01:26:30,944 --> 01:26:33,739
<i>hard balls hot babes</i>

824

<i>hairy babes yummy babes</i>

825
01:26:36,784 --> 01:26:41,413
<i>yummy balls and oily muscles too</i>

826
01:27:01,225 --> 01:27:07,607
<i>we'll keep on fighting
muscles are shining</i>

827
01:27:07,773 --> 01:27:12,904
<i>we are the champions</i>

828
01:27:14,322 --> 01:27:20,870
<i>thunder and lightning
excess of lightning</i>

829
01:27:21,037 --> 01:27:26,959
<i>fighting with balls in thongs</i>

830
01:27:27,752 --> 01:27:34,092
<i>we are together all dressed in leather</i>

831
01:27:34,259 --> 01:27:40,723
<i>all bits are wet
and we're perfectly taned</i>

832
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:44,602
<i>and have pierced our nipples</i>

833
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:58,594
<i>Ronal the Barbarian he rules...</i>
