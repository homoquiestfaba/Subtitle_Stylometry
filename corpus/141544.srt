KNOW HE EXISTS.

BUT US.

IT'S LIKE WE CAME
OUT HERE ON A HIKE,

NOBODY MENTIONS THE MONEY,

4,390,000...

351
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,800
$4,400,000!

352
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,500
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
LISTEN TO THAT.

353
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,990
LOOK AT THAT SHIT, MAN.
LOOK HOW SQUARE IT IS.

354
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
THAT IS COOL, HUH?

355
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,300
HOW MUCH IS THAT
APIECE?

356
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
ABOUT A MILLION
AND A...

357
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
A MILLION
AND WHAT? SHH!

358
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,400
A MILLION AND
A HALF? WHAT?

359
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,800
SHH! YOU
HEAR THAT?

360
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
UH-UH.

361
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,100
OH, SHIT.

362
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
GET IN THE TRUCK.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

363
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,900
SHIT.
GO ON!

364
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,600
Hank: LET'S GO!

365
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,000
COME ON, COVER UP
THE MONEY!

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
JAKE, GET
IN THE TRUCK!

367
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,600
DUMMY UP.
LET'S GO!

368
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,100
COME ON!

369
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,900
HEY, CARL.

370
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,000
ENGINE TROUBLE,
HANK?

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
OH, I WISH.
DOG TROUBLE.

372
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,990
JACOB'S MUTT CHASED
A FOX INTO THE WOODS.

373
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,500
SHE TREE IT?

374
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,800
WE THOUGHT SO, BUT JUST
WHEN WE WENT AFTER IT,

375
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,300
SHE CAME RUNNING BACK.

376
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,000
AH.

377
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,600
WHAT'D YOU DO
TO YOUR HEAD THERE?

378
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,700
OH. GOD, UH...

379
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,500
HEH. RAN INTO
A TREE BRANCH.

380
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,800
YOUR BROTHER
STILL OUT OF WORK?

381
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
YEAH.

382
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,300
LOU?

383
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,400
YEAH, HIM, TOO.

384
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,300
THAT'S A SHAME,
AIN'T IT?

385
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,400
WELL, WE PROBABLY BETTER
BE HEADING BACK--

386
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,900
HEY, HELLO, JACOB!

387
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,100
HEY, CARL,
HOW YOU DOIN'?

388
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,600
GOOD, GOOD.

389
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
I WAS BEGINNING
TO THINK

390
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,200
YOU WERE TRYING
TO AVOID ME.

391
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,100
I'M SORRY?

392
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,900
WELL, YOU SITTIN'
OVER THERE IN THAT TRUCK.

393
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,100
I THOUGHT YOU WAS
TRYING TO AVOID ME.

394
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
NO. JUST SITTIN'
IN THE TRUCK.

395
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,900
IT'S A LITTLE COLD
OUT HERE, YOU KNOW.

396
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
JUST KEEPIN' WARM.

397
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,700
WELL, WE PROBABLY
BETTER BE--

398
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,200
DID YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT THE PLANE?

399
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
IT SOU-SOUNDED
LIKE A PLANE.

400
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,600
WHAT PLANE?

401
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,700
WHAT, YOU HEARD
A PLANE?

402
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,300
UH...I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE HEARD.

403
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,200
YOU KNOW HE'S ALWAYS
HEARING SHIT.

404
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,900
MAYBE YOU BETTER
TELL ME, JACOB.

405
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,300
NO, THAT'S OK.

406
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,800
WE'RE GONNA
GET ON HOME.

407
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,800
ALL RIGHT.

408
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,500
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, MAN.

409
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,200
IT'S NEW YEAR'S!
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

410
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Jacob:
CALL ME, CARL.

411
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,400
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

412
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
SURE YOU DON'T
NEED ANY HELP?

413
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
NO, WE'RE ALL SET.

414
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
THANKS.
ALL RIGHT.

415
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,600
GODDAMN IT!

416
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,800
I'VE SEEN YOU DO SOME
PRETTY STUPID THINGS, JACOB,

417
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,500
BUT THAT PRETTY MUCH
TAKES THE CAKE!

418
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,500
IT WAS MY IDEA.

419
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,800
OH, WELL, THAT'S
BRILLIANT, LOU.

420
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
NOW WHEN THEY FIND
THE PLANE,

421
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,900
AND THEY REALIZE
THE MONEY'S GONE,

422
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,700
THEY'LL KNOW RIGHT OFF
WHO TOOK IT.

423
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,100
WELL, THAT'S--

424
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
THAT'S WHAT'S COOL
ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

425
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,300
I MEAN, WE WOULDN'T
TELL SOMEBODY

426
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,900
IF WE WERE THE ONES
THAT DID IT.

427
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,000
IT'S NOT LIKE HE SAID

428
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,700
THAT YOU ACTUALLY SAW
A PLANE GOING DOWN.

429
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,500
JUST YOU THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT'VE HEARD ONE

430
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,500
WITH ENGINE TROUBLE.

431
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
YOU WANT ME TO
BURN THE MONEY?!

432
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,800
I AM NOT GOING
TO PRISON OVER THIS!

433
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,700
IF IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE

434
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,300
OF US GETTING CAUGHT,

435
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
I SWEAR TO GOD,
IT'S ALL GONNA VANISH!

436
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,200
YOU UNDERSTAND?

437
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,000
"IT WAS A PINE APPLE."

438
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,100
HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE...

439
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,300
[GROANING] OH, GOD...
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

440
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,400
Woman: WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?!

441
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
YOU COME WHEN
I'M ALWAYS FINISHED.

442
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
I'M FINISHED,
YOU ASSHOLE!

443
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,700
HEY, NANCY!

444
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
DON'T--
DON'T HIT--

445
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,900
DON'T HIT
MARY BETH.

446
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,500
[LOW] REMEMBER,
NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS.

447
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,400
THAT INCLUDES NANCY.

448
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,200
SHE'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT
ABOUT IT SOONER OR LATER.

449
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,500
SHE'LL WONDER WHERE ALL
THE MONEY'S COMING FROM.

450
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,600
2 HOURS LATE!

451
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,000
OW! STOP IT!

452
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,800
TELL HER WHEN WE DECIDE
IT'S SAFE TO KEEP IT,

453
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
BUT NOT BEFORE THEN.

454
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,100
THEN THE SAME GOES
FOR SARAH.

455
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,200
OF COURSE.

456
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,200
[THUNK]

457
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,000
DAMN IT!

458
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,700
Nancy: COME ON!

459
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,200
YOU PROMISED TO
SHOVEL THE WALK,

460
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
YOU LAZY SON
OF A BITCH!

461
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:47,900
CALM DOWN, BABY.

462
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,800
I GOT A GOOD REASON
FOR BEING LATE. WHAT?

463
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
SEE YOU, LOU!

464
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,800
[INDISTINCT ARGUING]

465
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,100
YOU KNOW, I BET
HE'S TELLING HER.

466
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,000
THAT GUY CAN'T
KEEP A SECRET.

467
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,400
HEY, HONEY.

468
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
HEY.

469
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,000
WHERE YOU BEEN?

470
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,100
I WAS STARTING TO GET
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

471
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
SORRY I'M LATE.

472
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

473
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,400
HEY.

474
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,900
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HEAD?

475
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,300
IT'S OK. IT'S
JUST A SCRATCH.

476
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,800
IT'S ALL BLOODY.

477
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,000
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

478
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,400
YEAH, SURE.

479
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,400
WHAT IF YOU WERE
WALKING IN THE WOODS--

480
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,000
IT'S NOT DEEP.

481
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,600
AND YOU FOUND
A BAG FULL OF MONEY,

482
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,300
LET'S SAY $4 MILLION...

483
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,800
WOULD YOU KEEP IT?

484
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,500
OF COURSE NOT.

485
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
HERE, HOLD THAT.

486
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,100
HOW COME?

487
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,800
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
IT'D BE STEALING.

488
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,100
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
LOST MONEY HERE,

489
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,000
NOBODY'S LOOKING FOR IT.

490
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,700
$4 MILLION
OF LOST MONEY...

491
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,200
YEAH.

492
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,900
THAT NOBODY'S
YEAH. LOOKING FOR?

493
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,300
WELL, SO THEN
WHOSE MONEY IS IT?

494
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
YOURS.

495
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,300
OH.

496
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
OOH.

497
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,800
IT'S MY MONEY?

498
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,300
BUT WHOSE MONEY
WAS IT BEFORE?

499
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,600
A BANK ROBBER'S.

500
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,300
SO THEN IT'S
THE BANK'S MONEY.

501
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
ALL RIGHT, IT'S, UH,

502
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,000
A DRUG DEALER'S.

503
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
IT WAS--

504
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
HANK.

505
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,800
I MEAN, THIS IS
REALLY SILLY.

506
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,600
OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT ME TO SAY
SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR.

507
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,400
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,

508
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,100
BUT YOU WANT ME
TO AGREE WITH YOU

509
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,700
OR SAY THAT YOU'RE RIGHT
OR SOMETHING.

510
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,200
BUT I WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

511
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,700
THAT'S JUST ME. I WOULDN'T.

512
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,300
IT'S REAL.

513
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
IF WE KEEP IT,
WE NEVER HAVE TO WORRY

514
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,100
ABOUT MONEY AGAIN.

515
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,200
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT MONEY NOW, HANK.

516
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,100
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD JOB.

517
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,900
WE DON'T NEED IT.

518
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,200
YEAH, BUT NOBODY GETS
HURT BY US KEEPING IT.

519
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,900
I MEAN, THAT'S
WHAT MAKES IT A CRIME,

520
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,200
DOESN'T IT?

521
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,100
SOMEBODY GETTING HURT?

522
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,100
WHAT MAKES IT
A CRIME

523
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,200
IS THAT IT'S
AGAINST THE LAW.

524
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,600
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
SOMEBODY GETS HURT

525
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,400
OR IF THEY DON'T.

526
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,900
IF YOU GET CAUGHT,
YOU GO TO JAIL.

527

00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,200
WE BOTH DID.

703
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,100
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, HANK?

704
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,000
HE WAS ALIVE WHEN YOU LEFT.

705
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
I SMOTHERED HIM.

706
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,400
I GUESS THAT MAKES IT
MY DECISION.

707
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,400
IT'S GONNA BE OK.
I MEAN, IT LOOKED REAL.

708
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,200
AND EVEN IF--I MEAN,
LET'S SAY IT DIDN'T

709
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,600
LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

710
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,300
WHATEVER. I MEAN...

711
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,700
WHY WOULD ANYONE
THINK OF US?

712
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
YOUR TRACKS LEAD
RIGHT TO THE PLANE.

713
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,800
BUT IT'S GONNA SNOW.

714
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,100
ANY MINUTE NOW, IT'S
GONNA START SNOWING.

715
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,700
WAS THERE ANY BLOOD?

716
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,500
BLOOD?

717
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,200
JACOB HIT HIM. WAS
THERE BLOOD ANYWHERE?

718
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,500
DID HE GET BLOOD
ON ANYTHING?

719
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,200
WAS THERE BLOOD
ON THE ROAD OR--OR--

720
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,800
I DON'T REMEMBER.

721
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,000
DID YOU LOOK?
I LOOKED,

722
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,600
BUT I--I JUST DON'T--
IT WAS ALL HAP--

723
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,000
HONEY, IT'S GONNA SNOW.

724
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,400
IT'S GONNA SNOW

725
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,800
AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA
BE COVERED UP.

726
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,100
ALL THE TRACKS--

727
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,400
SHH.

728
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,100
TV:  HE WAS APPARENTLY
TRYING TO CROSS

729
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,500
ALONG THIS BANK OF SNOW

730
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,990
WHEN HIS SNOWMOBILE
SLIPPED OVER THE EDGE

731
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,990
THROWING HIM INTO THE ICY
WATERS OF ANDERS CREEK.

732
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,100
WRIGHT COUNTY DEPUTIES
RECOVERED THE BODY

733
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,600
SHORTLY BEFORE
4:00 THIS AFTERNOON.

734
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,300
A TRAGIC BEGINNING
TO THIS NEW YEAR

735
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,800
FOR ONE LOCAL FAMILY.

736
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,200
BACK TO YOU, PAUL.

737
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,200
THANKS, TRACY.

738
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,300
I WISH YOU HADN'T
TOLD JACOB.

739
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,200
I WISH HE STILL THOUGHT
THAT HE DID IT.

740
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
DOES IT SCARE YOU?

741
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,600
YEAH, IT SCARES ME.

742
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,600
WHAT IF HE TELLS SOMEBODY?

743
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,900
I MEAN, WHAT I DID.

744
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,800
WHAT YOU DID?

745
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,000
WELL, I KNOW THAT
YOU ONLY DID IT

746
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,200
BECAUSE YOU FELT TRAPPED.

747
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,500
THAT YOU COULDN'T
FIND ANY OTHER WAY.

748
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
WOULD YOU HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING?

749
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,400
I MEAN, IF YOU'D BEEN
THERE INSTEAD OF ME?

750
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,990
I--I--I JUST NEED TO
KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE.

751
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,730
OH, HONEY.

752
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,200
YOU LISTENING TO ME,
HANK?

753
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,600
EVERY MONDAY I COME DOWN
HERE, BUY 2 BAGS OF FEED

754
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
REGULAR AS CLOCK WORK.

755
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,500
2 BAGS OF WHEAT
4 TIMES A MONTH.

756
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,200
THAT'S 8 BAGS I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE BILLED FOR.

757
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,900
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE
TO GET THROUGH TO YOU.

758
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,600
DECEMBER STARTED
ON A MONDAY, MR. SCHMITT.

759
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,300
SO THERE WERE 5 MONDAYS
IN THE MONTH.

760
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:33,900
SO YOU CAME IN HERE 5--

761
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,800
ARE YOU TELLING ME THERE
WERE 5 WEEKS LAST MONTH?

762
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,600
NO, SIR, I'M TELLING YOU
THERE WERE 5 MONDAYS.

763
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,600
[TELEPHONE RINGING]

764
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,900
EXCUSE ME.
I GOT IT.

765
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,300
YEAH.

766
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,900
Jacob: HEY, HANK,
IT'S ME.

767
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,800
HANG ON A SECOND.

768
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,600
LISTEN, CHECK THAT
CALENDAR OVER THERE

769
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,600
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
SIR.

770
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

771
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,100
WELL, I'M A LITTLE BUSY
RIGHT NOW, JACOB.

772
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:51,900
WHAT IS IT?

773
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,500
OK, LISTEN, CAN YOU
MEET ME AT THE FARM?

774
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,700
WHAT FARM?
OUR FARM.

775
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,600
LOOK, UH,
WHAT IS IT?

776
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
ON YOUR LUNCH BREAK.
12:30, OK?

777
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,600
HEY, ARE WE STRAIGHT
ON THIS, MR. SCHMITT?

778
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,600
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

779
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,700
LOOK, I CAN'T DRIVE
OUT THERE RIGHT--

780
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
JACOB?

781
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
JACOB?

782
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,100
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

783
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,300
LOOK OUT!
HA HA HA HA HA.

784
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,800
WHAT THE HELL'D YOU
DRAG ME OUT HERE FOR?

785
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,200
LISTEN TO THIS.
I'M GONNA BUY IT BACK.

786
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,700
I'M GONNA FIX IT UP.
I'M GONNA REBUILD IT

787
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,800
JUST LIKE IT WAS
BEFORE MOM AND DAD DIED.

788
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,900
WHOA, WHOA. COME ON, WAIT, WAIT.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS.

789
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

790
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,800
ONCE WE SPLIT UP THE MONEY,
WE'VE GOTTA LEAVE.

791
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,200
WE HAVE TO GO.

792
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,400
WHAT DO YOU--WHAT DO
YOU WANT ME TO DO,

793
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,990
JUST LIKE THAT, JUST
DRIVE OFF BY MYSELF?

794
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,200
WELL, I MEAN,
SUPPOSE YOU STAY.

795
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,000
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA TELL
PEOPLE YOU GOT THE MONEY?

796
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,800
OH, THAT'S EASY.

797
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,400
WE JUST TELL PEOPLE
THAT SARAH

798
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,300
INHERITED SOME MONEY.
IT'S EASY.

799
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,900
NOBODY AROUND HERE KNOWS
ANYTHING ABOUT HER FAMILY.

800
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,600
YOU GUYS COULDA JUST
BOUGHT THE FARM, YOU KNOW,

801
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,100
AND THEN LEFT ME TO RUN IT.

802
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,300
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

803
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,000
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
GONNA MAKE YOU HAPPY.

804
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
JACOB...

805
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,800
FARMING? COME ON.

806
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,800
YOU DON'T JUST BUY A FARM.
YOU GOTTA--YOU GOTTA WORK IT.

807
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,200
YOU GOTTA KNOW
ABOUT MACHINERY AND SEED.

808
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,200
I KNOW THAT.

809
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,600
NO, YOU DON'T.

810
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,700
FERTILIZERS, PESTICIDES,
HERBICIDES,

811
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,300
DRAINAGE, IRRIGATION,
THE WEATHER?

812
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,200
COME ON, YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ANY OF THAT STUFF.

813
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,500
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
JUST LIKE DAD.

814
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,900
WHY DO YOU THINK HE
ENDED UP LIKE THAT?

815
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,700
I'LL TELL YOU HOW HE
ENDED UP LIKE THAT.

816
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,900
HE HAD 2 MORTGAGES RIDING
ON THE PLACE.

817
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
HE COULDN'T MAKE THE PAYMENTS.

818
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,400
WHERE DO YOU THINK
THE MONEY WENT?

819
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,400
HE WAS A BAD BUSINESSMAN.

820
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,600
WHERE DO YOU THINK
THE MONEY WENT?

821
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,300
NO, YOU THINK HE SPENT
IT ALL ON THE FARM?

822
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,950
I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHERE THE MONEY WENT.

823
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,300
4 YEARS OF COLLEGE, BUD.

824
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,300
YEAH, DIDN'T YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT HOW HE PAID FOR THAT?

825
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,500
DIDN'T THAT EVER
OCCUR TO YOU?

826
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,600
NO, MY TUITION WAS--

827
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,200
LISTEN, I'M SUPPOSED
TO GET THE FARM!

828
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,100
WHAT DO I GET?!

829
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,600
I'M SUPPOSED
TO GET THE FARM.

830
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,600
YOU GOT--YOU GOT
THE WHOLE WORLD. YOU CAN...

831
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,900
I DON'T WANNA HEAR THAT.

832
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,600
YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE
YOU WANT.

833
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,900
THIS IS WHAT I WANT.

834
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,800
THIS IS--THIS IS WHERE
I WANNA BE.

835
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,400
IT'S MY HOME, HANK.

836
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
SHIT.

837
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,000
HEY, HONEY.

838
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,500
WHAT?

839
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,000
I WANNA SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

840
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,500
WHAT IS IT?

841
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,000
I GOT THIS.

842
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,700
I HAD IT SENT OVER
FROM THE OTHER BRANCH.

843
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,600
LOOK. HERE IT IS.

844
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
"HEIRESS'S BODY
ID'D BY FEDS."

845
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
$4.4 MILLION RANSOM.

846
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,900
YOU SEE? THIS PERSON
NOBODY KNOWS

847
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,200
HAS JUST DISAPPEARED
RIGHT INTO THIN AIR.

848
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,300
DO YOU RECOGNIZE ONE
OF THEM FROM THE PLANE?

849
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,800
I CAN'T TELL.

850
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,900
HIS FACE WAS...

851
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
WHAT?

852
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,600
THIS CHANGES IT.

853
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,700
WHY IS THAT?

854
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,200
WE CAN'T SAY IT ISN'T
STEALING ANYMORE.

855
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000
WELL, HANK, IT'S
ALWAYS BEEN STEALING.

856
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,400
WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHO
WE WERE STEALING FROM.

857
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,300
WE THOUGHT IT WAS DRUG MONEY.

858
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,100
WE THOUGHT IT WAS MONEY
THAT WE COULD FIND--

859
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,100
NO, YOU THOUGHT THAT.

860
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,500
THIS IS GOOD.
I'M GLAD--

861
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,600
IT'S GOOD?

862
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,600
YES, IT'S GOOD WE KNOW
WHERE IT'S FROM,

863
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,900
BECAUSE I WAS STARTING
TO GET WORRIED.

864
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,300
I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT
BE COUNTERFEIT OR MARKED.

865
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,700
IT MIGHT STILL BE MARKED.

866
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,700
NO, IT SAYS RIGHT HERE.

867
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,200
LOOK. DENOMINATION
IN UNMARKED BILLS.

868
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,500
UNMARKED.

869
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
YOU SEE?

870
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,400
YOU'RE JUST BEING
PARANOID, HANK.

871
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,700
IT'S OVER. IT'S GOOD.

872
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,200
Man: SARAH?

873
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,900
WOULD YOU
COME HERE, PLEASE?

874
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,800
SURE. OK. JUST A SECOND.

875
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,900
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

876
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
[BANGING]

877
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,900
HA HA HA HA HA.

878
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:33,900
JESUS.

879
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,900
HEY, COME ON, HANK.
OPEN UP.

880
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,400
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

881
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,400
HEY, MR. ACCOUNTANT.

882
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,100
WELL, I'VE COME TO MAKE
A TINY WITHDRAWAL.

883
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,900
GO HOME. TURN AROUND
AND GO HOME RIGHT NOW.

884
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,800
OH, COME ON, IT'S
FREEZING OUT HERE, HANK.

885
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,900
SHH! KEEP IT DOWN.

886
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,000
INVITE ME IN.

887
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,500
ALL RIGHT,
JUST FOR A SECOND.

888
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,400
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS SHIT.

889
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,100
I GOTTA GET UP
AND GO TO WORK.

890
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,400
I WANT MY SHARE.

891
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,400
WHAT?

892
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,600
I DO. I WANT MY SHARE.

893
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,100
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY HERE,

894
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,100
AND EVEN IF I DID,
I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU ANY.

895
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
OH, COME ON, NOW.

896
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,900
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE
YOU HAVE IT

897
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,200
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S YOURS.
PART OF THAT IS MY MONEY.

898
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,100
PART OF IT MIGHT BE
YOUR MONEY...

899
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,600
IF WE DECIDE TO KEEP IT.

900
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,500
THE PLAN WAS TO SIT
ON THE MONEY

901
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,400
TILL WE DECIDE THAT
IT'S SAFE TO KEEP IT.

902
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,300
WHY ARE YOU COMING OVER HERE
WITH THIS SHIT?

903
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,800
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

904
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,200
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

905
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,700
JUST GIVE ME
ONE PACKET, OK?

906
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
JUST ONE PACKET.

907
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,200
AND I'LL COME BACK
LATER FOR THE REST.

908
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,600
ASK ME AGAIN, AND I'LL GO
BURN IT TOMORROW MORNING.

909
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,600
IS THAT CLEAR?

910
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
BLUFF.

911
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,100
WHAT?

912
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,600
IT'S A BLUFF.
B-L-U-F-F.

913
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,600
OH, THEN WHY DON'T YOU
CALL IT THEN

914
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,300
AND JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS?

915
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,800
YEAH.

916
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,100
ALL RIGHT. OK.

917
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,100
SEE, JACOB TOLD ME

918
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,800
A LITTLE SECRET,
MISTER ACCOUNTANT.

919
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,800
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO DWIGHT STEPHANSON.

920
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,600
YOU DRANK TOO MUCH.

921
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,100
I WANT ONE
OF THOSE PACKETS.

922
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,200
WELL, I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY HERE,

923
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,400
AND I HID IT AWAY
FROM THE HOUSE.

924
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,500
MM-HMM. WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

925
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,900
IT'D BE A SHAME
IF SOMEBODY

926
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,600
WAS TO DROP A NOTE
TO CARL JENKINS

927
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,900
SAYING THERE
MIGHT JUST BE

928
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,400
A LITTLE SOMETHING
SUSPICIOUS ABOUT

929
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,300
DWIGHT STEPHANSON'S
ACCIDENT.

930
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,300
HE JUST DROVE OFF
THAT BRIDGE?

931
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,600
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
DO YOU?!

932
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,100
COME ON. JESUS, LOU.

933
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,600
REMEMBER, YOU'RE A THIEF, TOO.

934
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,200
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

935
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,700
IF ONE OF US GOES TO JAIL,
WE ALL DO.

936
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
OH, GOD.

937
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,600
I NEED MY SHARE, HANK.

938
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
I DO.

939
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,200
I'M BROKE...

940
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,200
AND I OWE PEOPLE MONEY.

941
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,000
CHRIST, LOU,
I MEAN WH-WH...

942
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,600
I NEED SOME
HELP HERE, MAN.

943
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,100
OK, JUST WAIT HERE.

944
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,300
HERE, HERE.

945
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,100
$40?

946
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,200
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

947
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,400
MAYBE I CAN GO TO THE BANK

948
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,400
AND GET YOU A LOAN OUT
OF OUR SAVINGS.

949
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,900
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

950
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,700
THE MONEY'S A DAY'S DRIVE
FROM HERE.

951
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,400
EVEN IF I WANTED GO GET IT,
I CAN'T GO GET IT,

952
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,600
NOT TILL SARAH
HAS THE BABY.

953
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,000
A DAY'S DRIVE?!

954
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,600
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

955
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,900
I PUT IT IN A STORAGE LOCKER
ABOVE THE INTERSTATE.

956
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,600
WHAT THE HELL IS IT
DOING IN A STORAGE--

957
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,300
SHH! IT'S SAFE.
DON'T WORRY, ALL RIGHT?

958
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,900
I DIDN'T WANT IT NEAR US

959
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,500
IN CASE WE COME UNDER
ANY SUSPICION.

960
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,000
HOW THE HELL'S
THAT GONNA HAPPEN?

961
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,700
HOW'S THAT GONNA HAPPEN?

962
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,800
HOW ABOUT CARL KNOWING
ABOUT THE PLANE, HUH?

963
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,200
WHO'S IDEA WAS THAT?

964
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,800
YEAH.

965
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,700
ALL RIGHT.

966
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,400
BUT WE GO GET IT AS
SOON AS SHE'S DONE,

967
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,200
SPLIT IT UP
RIGHT THERE...RIGHT?

968
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,900
YEAH.

969
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,100

I'M SORRY.

DO YOU HAVE A CAR SEAT

978
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,600
IN THE CAR YOU'LL BE
TRAVELING HOME IN?

00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,800
YES.
YES.

980
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,200

INSTALLED?

981
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,500
HELLO, LOOK WHO'S HERE

WOULD YOU SIGN HERE?

984
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,600
SURE.

985
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,100
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"GAMBLING"? WHERE?

986
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
AT THE CASINO.
HE LOST SOME MONEY.

987
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,300
HOW MUCH?

988
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,700
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH.

989
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,300
SHH. HEY,
CONGRATULATIONS.

990
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,500

991
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,200
CONGRATULATIONS.

992
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,700
DID YOU SEE THAT
LITTLE BABY?

993
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,900
IT LOOKED LIKE
A LITTLE TOMATO.

994
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,800
HOW COULD YOU HAVE
TOLD HIM THAT, HUH?

995
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,900
I PUT MYSELF OUT FOR YOU.

996

WHAT DO YOU DO,
YOU BETRAY ME?

WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

999
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,800
IT'S LIKE
THERE'S 2 SIDES NOW.

1000
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,600
WHY ARE YOU BOTH ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT SIDES?

1001
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,400
THERE'S NO SIDES.

1002
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,700
WHO'S TALKING ABOUT SIDES?

1003
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,800
I'M ON BOTH OF YOUR SIDES.

1004
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,400
WE'RE ALL IN THIS
TOGETHER, MAN.

1005
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,300
IF YOU HAD TO PICK RIGHT NOW,
WHO'D IT BE?

1006
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,100
NO, I DON'T--WHY WOULD
I WANNA PICK?

1007
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,800
NO, I WANNA KNOW--
ME OR LOU?

1008
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,800

1012
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,900
I DIDN'T BUY IT, BUT, LOOK,
IT'S--IT'S KINDA COOL.

1013
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,700
JUST TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.

1014
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,900
YOU'RE GONNA
LIKE IT, I THINK,

1015
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,300
WHEN YOU SEE WHAT IT IS.

1016
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,800

DICTATING KIND,

THE KIND YOU CAN
HIDE IN YOUR POCKET?

1035
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,800
WHY DO YOU WANT
A TAPE RECORDER?

1036
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,000
YOU'RE GONNA TAPE
LOU CONFESSING

1037
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,300
TO STEPHANSON'S MURDER.

1038
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,200
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1039
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,200
[CURTAIN BEING DRAWN]

1040
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
YOU AND JACOB INVITE
HIM OUT FOR DRINKS.

1041
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,500
GET HIM DRUNK.

1042
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,000
YOU TAKE HIM BACK
TO HIS PLACE,

1043
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,800
THEN YOU START
JOKING AROUND,

1044
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,600
KIDDING ABOUT CONFESSING
TO THE POLICE.

1045
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,700
EACH OF YOU TAKE A TURN
PRETENDING HOW YOU'D DO IT.

1046
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,400
YOU GO FIRST, JACOB
SECOND, AND LOU LAST,

1047
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,900
AND WHEN LOU GOES,
YOU TAPE HIM.

1048
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,400
COME ON,
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

1049
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
JACOB HELPS YOU.
THAT'S THE KEY.

1050
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,200
IF JACOB EGGS HIM ON,
HE'LL DO IT.

1051
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,400
YEAH, BUT EVEN
IF HE, YOU KNOW,

1052
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,900
EVEN IF HE TALKS ON THE TAPE,
IT WON'T MEAN ANYTHING.

1053
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,700
I MEAN, WHO'S EVER
GONNA BELIEVE IT?

1054
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,300
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER
AS LONG AS LOU BELIEVES IT,

1055
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,300
AS LONG AS HE SEES THAT
JACOB'S TAKING YOUR SIDE.

1056
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT.

1057
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,400
WE SHOULD AT LEAST TRY,
SHOULDN'T WE?

1058
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,800
WE CAN'T LOSE ANYTHING
BY TRYING...RIGHT?

1059
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
Hank: COME ON,
IT'S NOT LIKE

1060
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,000
I'M ASKING YOU
TO DO THAT MUCH.

1061
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,200
HERE, JUST PICK UP THE PHONE
AND GIVE HIM A CALL

1062
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,700
AND SAY, "HEY,
LOU, HANK SUGGESTED

1063
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,600
WE GO OUT DRINKING
TOMORROW NIGHT."

1064
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,100
HANK SUGGESTED
WE GO OUT DRINKING?

1065
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
WHAT ARE TALKING ABOUT?

1066
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:00,800
WILL YOU LET ME FINISH?

1067
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,800
WE SUGGEST WE
GO OUT DRINKING.

1068
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,900
YOU DON'T EVER SUGGEST
WE GO OUT DRINKING.

1069
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'M GETTING TO THAT.
LET ME FINISH.

1070
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,600
I'M SAYING, TELL HIM I'VE
AGREED TO SPLIT UP THE MONEY.

1071
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,300
I THOUGHT IT'D BE
A GOOD IDEA FOR US

1072
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,200
TO--TO GO OUT AND
CELEBRATE FIRST.

1073
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,100
SO YOU WANT ME
TO TRICK HIM?

1074
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,200
YOU WANT ME
TO TRICK LOU?

1075
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,600
YOU WANT ME TO
TRICK MY FRIEND?

1076
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,300
OK.

1077
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,000
DO YOU GET WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE?

1078
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,900
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THE SERIOUSNESS

1079
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,600
OF THE SITUATION
WE'RE IN?

1080
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,200
HE CAN PUT US BOTH
IN JAIL, JACOB.

1081
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,800
HE'S NOT GONNA
SEND US TO JAIL.

1082
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,700
WELL, I CAN'T TAKE
THAT CHANCE,

1083
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,900
NOT NOW,
NOT WITH THE BABY.

1084
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,500
I CAN'T AFFORD TO
GO TO PRISON, JACOB.

1085
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,800
I MEAN, WH-WHAT
ABOUT SARAH, HUH?

1086
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,400
WH-WHAT ARE
THEY GONNA DO?

1087
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,000
I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GET RID

1088
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,100
OF THAT CHRISTMAS TREE
OUT OF HERE.

1089
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,500
IT'S TOO DRY. IT'S
GONNA START A FIRE--

1090
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,200
WOULD YOU--WOULD YOU
PAY ATTENTION HERE?

1091
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,600
PAY ATTENTION.

1092
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,900
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

1093
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:46,900
WHAT WOULD DAD DO?

1094
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,800
DON'T DO THAT,
PLEASE, HANK.

1095
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,300
DON'T YOU THINK HE'D
WANT US TO STICK TOGETHER?

1096
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,200
DON'T--DON'T SAY THAT.

1097
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,100
I MEAN,
YOU DON'T KNOW

1098
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,100
WHAT THE HELL
DAD WOULD DO.

1099
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,700
THAT'S FUCKED UP.
DON'T BRING HIM UP.

1100
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,100
WELL...

1101
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,900
WHAT IF I WAS TO SAY

1102
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,800
I'D HELP YOU GET
THE FARM BACK, HUH?

1103
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
ALL RIGHT,

1104
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,900
I'LL HELP YOU
BUY BACK THE FARM.

1105
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,200
BUT YOU GOT
TO HELP ME FIRST.

1106
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,400
YOU KNOW, ALL I MEANT BY
THAT ABOUT THE TREE IS

1107
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
IT'S JUST DRIED OUT,

1108
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,500
AND IT COULD START
A FUCKING FIRE.

1109
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,100
YOU KNOW HOW
THAT STUFF GOES.

1110
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,800
IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS
TRYING TO IGNORE YOU

1111
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,600
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,

1112
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,900
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
PRACTICAL SHIT TO YOU

1113
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,300
IS ALL IT WAS.

1114
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,200
Hank: YEAH, WE GOT
THAT WHITE CARPET.

1115
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,500
HONEY?

1116
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,000
OH. OH, HEY.

1117
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,500
HEY, SARAH.

1118
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,700
HEY, JACOB.

1119
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,300
I TAKE MY SHOES OFF
FOR YOU THERE, SEE?

1120
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,400
THANK YOU.

1121
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,200
OH, UH...

1122
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,700
IT'S A NICE SHIRT.

1123
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,200
TA-DA! HA HA.

1124
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,200
HERE, LET ME DO THAT.

1125
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,600
[WHISPERING]
HEY, I GOTTA PEE.

1126
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,600
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

1127
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,900
HI, BABY.

1128
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,300
HEY. YOU BROUGHT
HIM HERE?

1129
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,300
WELL, YEAH. I INVITED
HIM FOR DINNER.

1130
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,900
OH. OH! OH, GOOD.

1131
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,100
GOOD, GOOD.

1132
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,600
OK.

1133
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,700
SO HE'S GONNA DO IT?

1134
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,600
I HAD TO PROMISE HIM
THE FARM.

1135
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,300
YOU WHAT? WAIT,
I THOUGHT YOU SAID--

1136
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,100
WE AGREED THAT YOU
WERE GONNA SAY SOMETHING.

1137
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,800
WHERE'S HE SUPPOSED
TO GO, SARAH, HUH?

1138
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,500
I MEAN, WHAT'S
HE GONNA DO,

1139
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,300
DRIVE AWAY?

1140
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,000
I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.
I DON'T KNOW,

1141
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,900
BUT IF HE STAYS,
WE GET CAUGHT.

1142
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,800
I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S JUST--

1143
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,800
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF
TIME BEFORE HE SCREWS UP.

1144
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,700
I KNOW. THAT'S
NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

1145
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,500
I JUST...

1146
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,400
I JUST WISH HE COULD,
THAT'S ALL.

1147
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,200
[LAUGHTER]
[LAUGHTER]

1148
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,000
NO, NO, YOU REMEMBER
WHAT SHE DID?

1149
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,700
SHE WAS SO FREAKED OUT
THAT SHE CALLED

1150
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,400
THE VOLUNTEER
FIRE DEPARTMENT,

1151
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,000
AND THEN, REMEMBER,
THEY CAME OUT...

1152
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,700
OH, YEAH, THERE WAS
ALL OF DAD'S BUDDIES--

1153
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,400
ALL HIS DRINKIN'
BUDDIES.

1154
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,000
YEAH, YEAH.

1155
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,900
THAT'S--THAT'S ALL THE VOLUNTEER
FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS,

1156
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,700
WAS GUYS HE KNEW,
YOU KNOW?

1157
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,900
SO THEY SHOW UP--

1158
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,600
AND HE'S SITTING
THERE IN THE KITCHEN

1159
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,500
WITH THAT ICE PACK
ON HIS FACE.

1160
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,900
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
HE FELT LIKE AN IDIOT,

1161
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,000
'CAUSE THEY'RE
ALL GATHERED IN THERE

1162
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,800
LIKE THERE'S SOME HUGE
MURDER GOING DOWN, YOU KNOW?

1163
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,100
[BABY CRIES]

1164
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,300
SHH, SHH.

[BABY CRIES]

1166
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,800
OK.

1167
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,800
[BABY CRIES]

1168
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,100
WELL, BACK ON CALL.

1169
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,600
HEY, HOW ABOUT
SOME MORE WINE?

1170
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,400
YOU GOT A FULL
GLASS HERE.

1171
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,100
WHAT'S IT LIKE,
A WALKIE-TALKIE, SARAH,

1172
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,600
KIND OF LIKE A BABY
WALKIE-TALKIE?

1173
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,000
YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S KINDA COOL.

1174
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,800
REMEMBER, WE HAD
THAT THING WE DID

1175
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,400

WALKIE-TALKIES?

1176
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,000
OH, YEAH.

1178
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,900
REMEMBER THAT?

1179
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,800
YEAH.

1180
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,200
YEAH.

1181
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,400
YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD.

1182
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,800
I THINK--I THINK
ABOUT THAT STUFF.

1183
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,900
I THINK IT'S KINDA WEIRD--

1184
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,700
YOU REMEMBER EVERYTHING,
TOO, DON'T YOU?

1185
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,600
WELL, YEAH.
I WAS ALWAYS--

1186
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,000
I WAS ALWAYS
TALKING TO DAD.

1187
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,000
I KNOW YOU WERE.

1188
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,800
I WAS ALWAYS FIGURING OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU KNOW?

1189
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,200
I WAS ALWAYS NERVOUS ABOUT
SHIT, YOU KNOW, I GUESS.

1190
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,200
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT,
HE'S A...
