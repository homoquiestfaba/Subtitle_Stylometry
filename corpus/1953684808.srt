1
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,270
My name's Paul Raymond.

2
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,814
Welcome to my world of erotica.

3
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,844
-30?
-(Paul) Yes.

4
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,464
(Fawn) 39?
(Paul) Yes.

5
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,550
-50?
-(Paul) Yes.

6
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,561
(Fawn) 55?
(Paul) Yes.

7
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,389
Why do you buy
so many houses, Grandpa?

8
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,069
(Paul) They're not houses, they're...
they're shops, restaurants, offices...

9
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,522
cafes, clubs.

10
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,569
But why so many?

11
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,902
(Paul) I bought them for your mummy.

12
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,706
For your mummy and...you
and your little sister.

13
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,536
-(overlapping chatter)
-(car honks)

14
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,505
-(cameras clicking)
-(reporters shouting)

15
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,131
(Charles) Give him space.

16
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,800
Please, move away.

17
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,001
Can you give him some room, please?
Thank you.

18
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,962
(reporter 1) Mr Raymond!
(reporter 2) Paul.

19
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,505
(reporter 2) Paul!
(reporter 3) Mr Raymond.

20
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,261
What can you tell us
about your daughter?

21
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,183
(reporters clamouring)

22
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,721
Debbie had all the money in the world.

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,227
She had a beautiful house,

24
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,558
beautiful children,

25
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,438
beautiful cars.

26
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,986
(cameras clicking)

27
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,065
I don't understand it.

28
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,487
(reporter 2) Okay, thank you.

29
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,278
(reporters clamouring)

30
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,582
(reporter 1) Thank you.

31
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,633
(sighs)

32
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,320
(clicking)

33
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,815
I think we're both quite showy.

34
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,113
<i>We're both quite extrovert
and sort of...</i>

35
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,653
spark each other off in that way.

36
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,123
<i>(Paul) I certainly, uh,
see</i> a <i>lot of myself in Debbie.</i>

37
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,791
She's a maverick.

38
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:06,122
Uh, [started out as a performer
and so did Debbie,

39
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,832
and eventually I moved backstage

40
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,668
and Debbie has followed a similar path.

41
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,134
My name is Paul Raymond.
Please welcome La Cirque Nu de Paris.

42
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,187
That's "nu", not "new".
It's French for "nude".

43
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,436
'(band playing)
-(applause)

44
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,068
(lion tamer) Come here.
Come here. Come here.

45
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,278
Good boy. Out.

46
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,447
Good boy, out. Out, steady now.

47
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,663
Steady now.
Steady, Atlas, steady. Steady.

48
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,283
- Come on. Come on. Out. Come on.
-(roaring)

49
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,205
- Ahl

50
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,962
- Paul, do the curtain.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

51
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,163
Get down. Get down.

52
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,665
- We're not allowed.
-(lion tamer) You've got to.

53
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,000
-(girl) We're not allowed to move.
- Don't be silly.

54
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,675
Come on, you've got to. Get down, quick.

55
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,468
-(audience cheering)
-(Paul) Listen to them.

56
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,088
That's fantastic.

57
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,099
(girl) Quick, hurry. Open the gate.

58
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,644
- The curtain. Do the curtain.
-(Paul) Curtain!

59
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,856
-It's all right.
- I was so scared.

60
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,479
-(Jean) Florence, are you all right?
- Oh, yeah, great.

61
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,935
A bloody lion tried to
eat me for dinner.

62
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,146
- Calm down...
- I am not getting back in that cage.

63
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,230
(Jean) Jim, how bad is it?

64
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,156
Well, the audience liked it.

65
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,660
(Paul)
You can't buy publicity like that.

66
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,704
And they can't prosecute me
because the girls had to move.

67
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,829
- You watch. Tonight we'll be sold out.
- Well, it's all right for you.

68
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,626
I'm the one who's got
to go into the lion's den.

69
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,123
Well, they're not gonna pay
to watch me in a cage.

70
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,625
Oh, I would.

71
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,166
(Paul) Back, by popular demand,

72
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:37,096
Atlas the lion and
the amazing Cirque Nu de Paris.

73
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,922
-(loud cheering)
-(fanfare playing)

74
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,882
(roars)

75
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,520
(Paul) Look at that. Fantastic.
We're in the nationals. Daily Sketch.

76
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,896
It says I was nude.

77
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,018
Does it matter?

78
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,401
No, I wasn't nude.
I most certainly wasn't nude.

79
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,617
I am a choreographer.
I'm Paul Raymond's wife. I'm not a nude.

80
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,740
What would my mother say?

81
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,571
- Well, they can't...
-it's half a page.

82
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,998
They can't just make things up.

83
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,371
Saying I was nude.
I wasn't bloody nude.

84
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,378
I wasn't naked.
I was wearing a G-string.

85
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,879
A G-skin?

86
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,624
- A G-string.
-(laughter)

87
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,838
It's a form of ladies underwear.

88
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,887
You've been called the
"king of the keyhole shows".

89
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,765
I like to think of myself as the, er...
"king of the glamour shows".

90
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,641
Your shows are refined, respectable

91
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,722
-and modest?
- Yes.

92
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,433
Well, in that case,
surely it is a compliment for a woman

93
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,610
to be classed as a "nude"?

94
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,739
Paul, do you wish that your wife
hadn't tried to sue the Daily Sketch?

95
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,988
I love my wife and I fully support her
in everything she does.

96
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,740
Although she will
have to pay the legal costs.

97
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,945
(laughter)

98
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,658
Gentlemen, I'd love to stand around
and chat further

99
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,078
but, er, my new members-only club
is opening in Soho,

100
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,084
the heart of London's West End.

101
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,756
Er, now being a private club,

102
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,051
our nudes will move,
dance and express themselves.

103
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,633
Gentlemen of the press are,
of course, welcome.

104
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,682
Once you've paid the 10 shillings
and sixpence membership fee.

105
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,429
-(laughter)
-if you come along this evening,

106
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,271
you can enjoy a complimentary
glass of champagne. House champagne.

107
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,768
Thank you.

108
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,901
- I thought you handled that very well.
- Thank you.

109
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,608
I hated that lawyer
making me look stupid.

110
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,064
They didn't make you look stupid.

111
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,658
They didn't "make you" look stupid.

112
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,110
You.

113
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,088
- I do hope this is a good idea.
-(Paul) It's gonna be a great night.

114
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,712
We're a beacon of excellence
in a sea of mediocrity.

115
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,797
Hello, Jean.
How'd it go in court, darling?

116
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,345
- Dreadfully. We lost.
- Oh, yeah? How much you lose?

117
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,548
Uh, it was all money well spent
as far as I'm concerned.

118
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,632
Right.

119
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,513
There's only one thing worse
than being talked about, Jimmy,

120
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,809
and that is not being talked about.

121
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,977
- Do you know who said that?
- No.

122
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,101
Oscar Wilde.
Except he didn't say "Jimmy".

123
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,899
-(Jimmy) Wasn't he a queer?
- Yes, he was one of the first.

124
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,227
See you later.

125
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,819
- Hello, sir. How are you?
- Hello, sir.

126
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,362
- I'm all right, how are you?
- Little bit of striptease.

127
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,609
Beautiful, beautiful girls.

128
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:05,361
(Jean) One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. And one, two, three...

129
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,241
(Paul) How's the prettiest girl
in the club?

130
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,740
I don't mean you. I mean...
Hello, squeaky nose.

131
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,621
Have you got a squeaky nose still?

132
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,247
Ooh. (squeaks)

133
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,958
Six seven, eight. Chins.
Two, three, four.

134
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,416
-(Paul) How's she been?
- She's a beauty. Just like her father.

135
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,378
Excellent.
Flattery very important for a hostess.

136
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,132
And one, two, three, four...

137
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,007
- So, are you gonna squeak my nose?
-(sighs)

138
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,925
Well, there might be squeaking involved.

139
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,011
- I can't promise it'll be your nose.
-(chuckles)

140
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,058
Five six, seven, eight.
And one, two three, four, five, six...

141
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,064
No, no, no. Yeah, yeah.

142
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,612
(Paul) Ah, there you are.
(Edwyn) Hello, Paul.

143
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,032
Are we having a party?
Hello, sweetheart.

144
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,984
We're just...
We're just chatting, really.

145
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,320
How are you? You all right?
Tending to your flock, are you?

146
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:52,158
Yes, everyone seems to be in, er...
you know, good spiritual health.

147
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,993
- Oh!
- Out on the town, girls.

148
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,954
Where is my costume?

149
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,580
(dancer)
I'm gonna wear it for David, I think.

150
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,381
I think there's something wrong
with my zip.

151
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,759
I have a needle and cotton
if you need it.

152
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,929
Girls, I want you all on stage
1O minutes before curtain. Okay?

153
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,507
Oh, Betsy, you've decided
to join us, have you?

154
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,385
I'm sorry, Mrs Raymond, I missed my bus.

155
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,687
Well, next time you're out.
It's a professional theatre.

156
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,435
- It's not a bloody fish and chip shop.
- Yes, Mrs Raymond.

157
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,730
Uh, lipstick's bleeding.

158
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,902
All right, lots of smiles.
Confident and enjoy.

159
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,438
(dancers) Thank you.

160
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,862
I ask the girls. I say, you know,
"Don't call me Reverend. Call me Edwyn.

161
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,534
"Forget the dog collar.
Just see me as a friendly face.

162
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,077
"And use that face as... as...
as you wish."

163
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,497
(dancers giggling)

164
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,993
You know, you shouldn't be in here
unless you're topless.

165
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,582
Now, you save that cheek
for on stage, young lady.

166
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,085
Adam and Eve were naked.

167
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,333
Baby Jesus was naked for the first...

168
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,843
part of his life.

169
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,173
(people cheering)

170
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,885
-(cabaret music playing)
-(applause)

171
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,066
(Paul) A glass of champagne. Taittinger.

172
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,227
(music continues)

173
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,173
- To the future.
- To the future.

174
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,757
(music continues)

175
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,228
(interviewer) Paul Raymond's Revue Bar.

176
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,726
To some, a Mecca.
To others, Sodom and Gomorrah.

177
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,851
Ever since it opened in 1958,

178
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,481
people have been flocking to the club

179
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,940
that has become synonymous
with Soho, sex and sophistication.

180
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,363
Mr Raymond has always been a pioneer.

181
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,490
Pushing at the boundaries
of what is legal,

182
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,413
occasionally crossing the line.

183
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,957
This has brought him rich rewards.

184
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,036
His club turns over more than
a quarter of a million pounds a year.

185
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,542
(applause)

186
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,831
Bravo.

187
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,632
(interviewer)
Even as the '60s started to swing,

188
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,802
it seemed people were willing
to pay good money

189
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,050
to see a girl take her clothes off.

190
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,515
Now,
with the Lord Chamberlain abolished,

191
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,141
Paul Raymond faces a new challenge
and a new opportunity.

192
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,439
Legitimate West End theatres
can put on shows with naked girls,

193
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,986
so Mr Raymond has plans to transform
himself into a theatre impresario.

194
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,692
But, for today, he has his hands full,

195
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,240
rehearsing a new dance show
for his Revue Bar.

196
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,368
Okay. Hold it, hold it, hold it.

197
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,993
We're now getting near
to the end of the act.

198
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,667
What I want you to do is,
now, readjust the ending,

199
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,461
so that, by the end,
you're completely nude.

200
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,791
That's great. Undulate.

201
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,254
Remember more... more...
more snake-like movements.

202
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,422
The fact that Midas
has turned you to gold...

203
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,722
Don't worry about the logic of that.

204
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,597
You're not gold ingots,
you're beautiful women

205
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,428
and the gold
doesn't impede your movements.

206
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,979
Very fluid.

207
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,811
Excellent. Great.

208
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,898
Mr Raymond, what makes
a good striptease artist'?

209
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,025
(Paul) Well, the girls are...

210
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,405
in a sense, actors

211
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,610
and they must persuade the men
that they're enjoying the experience.

212
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,070
Uh, so it's a performance
and they must be convincing.

213
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,867
And how did your career begin?

214
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,162
Well, I'm an entertainer,
first and foremost.

215
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,539
I started out with a mind-reading act.

216
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:28,249
Erm, and I soon realised that people
like to look at attractive girls.

217
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,426
And they liked it even more
if the girls had no clothes on.

218
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,132
Er, so in that sense,
in that sense alone,

219
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,930
I could read people's minds.

220
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,433
(interviewer) In leafy SW19,

221
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,100
not far from the world-famous
grass courts of Wimbledon Tennis Club,

222
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,807
he and his young family
live among the company directors,

223
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,897
city bankers and lawyers.

224
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,195
His son and daughter
go to public schools

225
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,772
and enjoy the right sports.

226
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,530
Not bad for a boy from Liverpool
who arrived with five bob in his pocket.

227
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,830
(Jean) Good try, darling.

228
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,909
Yes, try and hit it, though, Howard.
Try and hit it with the bat.

229
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,921
Okay, again, one more time. Thanks.

230
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,294
Again.

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,377
(Jean) Come on, Howard.
Keep your eye on the ball.

232
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,005
Yes! Out! Out!

233
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,432
(interviewer) All this is the measure
of Raymond's success,

234
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,225
far from the grey class certainties

235
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,429
of Moseley Hill, Liverpool,
where he was born.

236
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,189
(Paul) My father left home
when I was just a baby.

237
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,943
Uh, so I was brought up
in a house full of women.

238
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,895
So I'm very comfortable around them.

239
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,814
Um, we moved to Glossop
when I was a child,

240
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,275
where I was educated
by the Sisters of Notre Dame.

241
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,744
What would the nuns think
of what you do now?

242
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,742
I think that they would be forgiving.

243
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,869
I think, you know,
I mean, I'm very strict.

244
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,201
I would never allow anything blasphemous
in any of my shows.

245
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,412
No, never.
I wouldn't have some...

246
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,668
one of the dancers, you know,
dressed as a nun, you know, with...

247
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,718
suspenders under her habit,
you know.

248
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,135
You know, pulling the rope off
a Franciscan monk and, you know,

249
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,932
having him ravage her or something,
you know, in a confessional box.

250
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,477
I would never do anything like that
because I would find that offensive.

251
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,270
Do you keep in touch with your father?

252
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,640
Uh, no, he disappeared completely.

253
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,813
(eastern music playing)

254
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,818
Would you say everything you touch
turns to gold'?

255
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,402
Not... not everything, er...
but enough.

256
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,994
Mr Raymond, thank you very much.
Cheers.

257
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,450
You're more than welcome.
Thank you.

258
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,459
What time do you finish tonight?

259
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,873
I think about 5:00.

260
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,004
(Paul) You're a sweetheart.

261
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,624
(Kim) I think an hour with me
will sort you right out.

262
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,833
(girls giggle)

263
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,966
- Well, I may well take you up on that.
-(girls laugh)

264
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,119
Hello.

265
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,838
I was trying not to wake you.

266
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:14,997
What time is it?

267
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,675
(sighs) Uh, late. Well, early.

268
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,429
- Was she nice?
- Uh, a girl. Just a girl.

269
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,756
Mmm?

270
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,009
- What's that?
- Hmm?

271
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,720
Oh, shit. (stutters) It's gold paint.

272
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,565
One of the girls in the Midas thing,
you know.

273
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,273
(sighs) Makes a change from lipstick.

274
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,693
You wouldn't want a husband
who was surrounded by all these...

275
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,901
beautiful, naked girls
and have no libido.

276
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,952
- Would you?
- Oh, I don't know.

277
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,831
You could have a boy if you want.

278
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,499
_ "Mmm?

279
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,998
Would you be there?

280
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,875
Yes. Of course.

281
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,503
And would you make love to him, too?

282
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,842
- No, of course not.
-(both chuckle)

283
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,379
And where would this be happening?

284
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,464
Right here. In our bedroom.

285
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,220
And what would you be doing?

286
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,719
I'd be over there in the chair. Tied up.

287
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,305
How would it all get started?

288
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,107
- Well, the doorbell would ring.
- Would you answer it?

289
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,106
Well, of course I can't.
I'm fucking tied up, aren't I?

290
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,529
- I'm not Houdini.
-(laughing)

291
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,574
(auctioneer) Twenty-five with you, sir.
Thirty with you, sir.

292
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,117
Forty.

293
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,200
Forty-five, sir. With you at 45.

294
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,079
I am looking for £50,000.
Fifty at the back.

295
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,410
(Paul) Debbie, this is Carl. My lawyer.

296
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,541
- Hello, Debbie.
-(Debbie) Morning.

297
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,622
£60,000.

298
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,378
I have 60. I'm looking for 65.

299
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,760
Do I see... Thank you, 65.

300
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,303
Seventy with you, sir. Seventy-five.

301
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,847
Hundred and fifty.

302
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,674
(auctioneer) No further bidding.

303
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,223
Sold to you, sir, for £150,000.

304
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,813
- Do you own that one?
- No.

305
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,891
-15?
- No.

306
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,355
-(Debbie) What about 78?
- Not 78.

307
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:02,238
-76?
-76 is mine. I own 34.

308
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,073
- What about the next one?
- No.

309
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,485
-(Debbie) Is this yours?
- That's mine, yes.

310
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,529
- Say "mine". I mean "ours", of course.
- Of course.

311
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,329
I own this one here.

312
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,408
(Debbie) Why? It's horrible.

313
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,169
Some of the streets...
some of them are a little bit scruffy.

314
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,088
So why do you buy so many buildings?

315
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,968
Because, uh, one day
you will own the company

316
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,179
and nothing confers more respectability
on someone than property.

317
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,632
Do you want a piece of cake
from that shop there?

318
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,351
(Debbie) Yes. Obviously.

319
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,559
I told you I could
read people's minds, didn't I, eh?

320
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,974
Can I have the berry cheesecake,

321
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,942
the strawberry mountain,

322
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,145
the cake with the almonds on the side

323
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,856
and the marzipan figs?

324
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,864
-(Paul sighs) Debbie!
- Mmm!

325
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,700
You're not supposed to eat them all.

326
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,498
They're to share with the other girls,
to help you make friends.

327
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,829
Now, we must insist that you
don't come inside to the dormitory.

328
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,788
It's a rule that we have here.

329
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,839
It can be very upsetting
for the children.

330
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,916
Right.

331
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,128
But they do get over it
after a week or so.

332
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,587
Right.

333
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,519
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

334
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,775
Hello, I'm here for the audition.

335
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,321
Too late, I'm afraid.

336
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,825
Are you sure you can't just
squeeze one more in'?

337
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,071
Hold on one moment.

338
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,244
- Mr Raymond?
- Mmm?

339
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,075
I'm here for the auditions.

340
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,367
You're late.

341
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,086
Yes. No. Yes, lam late.

342
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,005
But I told myself
that I wasn't going to come in

343
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,755
unless there was a free parking meter,
which usually there never is.

344
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,259
But, at the last second,
a red Cortina pulled out.

345
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,806
So...here I am.

346
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,347
Luck, hopefully, or destiny?

347
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,721
- Uh, what's your name?
- Um, Amber.

348
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,354
Well, my real name is Julia
but I call myself Amber.

349
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,607
I see. Yes, well,
my name's not really Paul Raymond.

350
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,443
It's, uh...
My real name's actually Geoffrey Quinn.

351
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,523
Oh.

352
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,324
Gosh. (chuckles)

353
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,665
It's really...
It's quite grand, isn't it?

354
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,793
Well, in your own time,
if you'd like to take off your robe.

355
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,916
Of course.

356
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,259
Excellent. Um, turn round, please.

357
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,929
- Exquisite.
-(9i99le$)

358
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,227
if you want to hop into the pool.

359
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:39,929
Yes.

360
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,722
If you'll fit.

361
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,059
Think you're almost as tall
as the pool is long.

362
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,397
(Amber chuckles) Yes.

363
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,019
Breast stroke?

364
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,483
- Of course.
-(Am ber chuckles)

365
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,406
(water splashes)

366
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,947
(Yvonne) How could any man
be such a cad'?

367
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,573
Such a hypocrite

368
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,622
as to make love to me
whilst he had a wife?

369
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,790
(Leonard) Oh, any man
who would do that...

370
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,916
(audience laughs)

371
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,292
(Yvonne) I thought
you were like other men,

372
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,919
-eager to start an affair...
-(whispers) Quickly.

373
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,796
(Yvonne) ...as long as there were
no strings attached.

374
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,794
-(audience cheering)
-(wolf whistle)

375
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,223
Leonard, Leonard!
Who are those women?

376
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,141
Oh, they're our neighbours.
We let them use the swimming pool.

377
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,645
- They're very liberated.
- Mmm! Liberated from their clothes.

378
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,397
Leonard, I need a huge favour.

379
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,236
You need a place to hide
from this nasty story

380
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,608
-that's going around about you.
-(Leonard) Yes.

381
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,441
(actress 1) Well, it's clear to me,
George, you've made a fool out of me

382
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,151
and I'm leaving you.

383
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,785
(actress 2) And I'm leaving you.

384
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,371
(George) Oh, no, you're not.
I'm leaving you.

385
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,074
(Leonard)
And I'm leaving you, Yvonne, after all.

386
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:45,412
- In my house with my best friend.
-(Yvonne) Absolute nonsense!

387
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,714
It was I, yes, I
who spent the night with him...

388
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,462
(dialogue fades)

389
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,878
(George speaks gibberish)

390
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,095
(audience cheering)

391
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,276
(upbeat music playing)

392
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,237
-(man) ...lovely boy.
- Rusty! You fancy a drink?

393
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,994
- Er... Oh! How are you?
- I'm celebrating.

394
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,449
- Yeah. You want to join us for a drink?
- Oh, yeah, come on.

395
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,910
Dave can look after here.
It's dead tonight anyway.

396
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,212
(J1 Born Under a Bad Sign
by Booker T & the MGs)

397
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,918
(Paul) Ladies.
(Jimmy) Yeah, thanks, darling.

398
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,584
(Jimmy) on, look at this.

399
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,340
(Jean) Thank you.

400
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,008
Where did you find this lot?

401
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,635
Vienna. Vienna, yes.

402
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,887
(Jimmy) Must have cost you a few bob.
(Paul) No, no.

403
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,677
Just shipping and packing.
And that's just the women.

404
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,146
(Rusty) Oh, I'd like a big snake
like that. Wouldn't you, Jean?

405
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,347
Yeah, I bet you do. (chuckling)

406
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,270
(man) Here's the papers, Mr Raymond.

407
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,813
Right, here we go.

408
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,192
"Hoot or miss?

409
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,652
"Pyjama Tops is the worst acted farce
I have ever seen on any stage

410
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,156
"in the last 25 years."

411
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,278
- Ooh!
-(Jean) That's rubbish.

412
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:04,832
"It is littered with
arbitrary displays of naked flesh."

413
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,625
Well, he's not wrong there.

414
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,871
To be described as
the worst play in the last 25 years

415
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:13,675
is almost as good as being described
as the best play in the last 25 years.

416
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,214
Because people
are going to talk about it,

417
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,761
and that's all that matters.

418
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,385
Here's to the worst play
in the last 25 years.

419
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,848
(all) To the worst play.

420
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,350
Bottoms up. Literally.

421
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,469
(applause, cheering)

422
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,903
(girls) Bye.
(Amber) Have a good weekend.

423
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,280
- Bye, Annabell.
- Bye, love.

424
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,033
- Hello, Amber.
- Hello.

425
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,576
Congratulations on
a very successful first week.

426
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,243
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

427
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,159
Anyway I got this bottle of
chilled vintage champagne

428
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:52,455
and the Rolls is outside and I thought
perhaps, you know, we could...

429
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,831
celebrate.

430
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,043
The audience really lapped it up,
didn't they?

431
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,003
You soaked the first three rows.

432
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,890
- You know, I actually own the theatre.
- Oh, really'?

433
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,217
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Wow.

434
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,394
- The Windmill Theatre, you know that?
- Mmm-hmm.

435
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,685
Yeah, that's...
that's one of mine.

436
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,680
- The Revue Bar, of course.
- Yes.

437
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,436
- Yes.
- Raymond's Revue Bar.

438
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,777
I am probably one of the biggest
show producers in the UK.

439
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,939
Wow.

440
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,574
So tell me all about yourself,
warts and all.

441
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,200
- Gosh. Um...
- Actually, skip the warts.

442
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,075
(Amber) Well, once I was a nanny
for a woman

443
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,286
whose boyfriend
happened to be Sean Connery.

444
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,294
- Really? Yes.
- Mmm.

445
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,248
And, uh, did he try to kiss you?

446
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,425
(laughs) I was... I was 17.

447
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,002
Mmm, and he was James Bond. So...

448
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,176
Actually, he was, um...
he was really nice.

449
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,680
He, er, gave me two tickets
to the Dr No premiere.

450
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,016
- Did he now?
- Mmm-hmm.

451
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,390
And, uh, he kissed me aftewvards.

452
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:57,524
- Did he? On the lips?
- Yes.

453
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,278
And, um, was it like this?

454
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,955
Mmm. No, it was
a little bit more like, um...

455
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,671
Like that.

456
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,671
Well, um...

457
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,636
(mimics Sean Connery)
I'm shaken but not stirred.

458
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,762
(laughing)

459
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,478
Very good.
You sound very like him.

460
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,143
I've even got the eyebrows.

461
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,439
- Did you notice?
- Yes, you do.

462
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:38,107
Yes, you'd make a very good,
uh, Honey Ryder.

463
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,445
'Cause I could just imagine you
like Ursula Andress,

464
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,866
you know, emerging from the, uh...
from the waves.

465
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,909
With a dagger strapped to my thigh.

466
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,489
Yes, perhaps you could be, er...
my Honey Ryder in the, er...

467
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,156
in the Caribbean.

468
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,534
I'd love to be. Hmm.

469
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,719
(Paul) Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

470
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,675
What time is it?

471
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,476
(sighs)

472
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,769
Just after 2:00.

473
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,685
That's early.

474
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,697
- What was she like?
- Nice.

475
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,702
Good in bed?

476
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,614
I don't know.

477
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,326
- Night, girls.
- See you later, Jack.

478
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,707
- Have you kept the school uniform?
-(girl) Oh, of course I still have it.

479
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,834
-(laughter)
-(knock on door)

480
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,004
Mr Raymond's waiting
at the stage door, Amber.

481
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,468
Oh, thank you.

482
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,088
-(girls) Ooh!
- Mr Raymond!

483
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,843
Yes, Mr Raymond.

484
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,091
Going home with the boss-man.

485
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,851
- Maybe.
-(girl) You want to be careful.

486
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,596
- Night, Jack.
- Night.

487
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,111
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

488
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:14,240
J1 I'm just mad about Saffron

489
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,794
J1 Saffron's mad about me

490
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,298
J1 I'm just mad about Saffron

491
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,926
J1 She's just mad about me

492
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,590
(tyres screeching)

493
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,676
J1 They call me mellow yellow

494
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,598
J1 Quite rightly

495
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,889
I hope it's big enough for you.

496
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,389
(chuckles) I think it is.

497
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,971
Talking about the room.

498
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,518
Nice jugs-.

499
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,598
(Amber chuckles)

500
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:41,975
(grunts)

501
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,023
Yes, I fit.

502
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,063
Yay! (laughs)

503
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,485
I had a mind-reading act
called Mr and Miss-tree.

504
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,076
Mr and Miss-tree!

505
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,031
- Yes. It's very clever word play...
-it's very clever.

506
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,410
Ah, I love it
when you do all the work.

507
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,749
It's so nice when you're on top.

508
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,415
Especially 'cause of my bad back.

509
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,718
There would be a code system,
uh, for the alphabet.

510
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:14,308
And the word for "P" was "come",
and the word for "N" was "here".

511
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,219
So if she said, "Come, Mr Raymond,
what do we have here?"

512
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,100
I would say,
"Come-here, P-N. Pen."

513
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:23,313
Oysters start off as male
and become female.

514
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,648
I did not know that.

515
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,276
- Well, there you go. It's, uh...
- Thank you for that fascinating fact.

516
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,323
I'll give you a fascinating fact
every day.

517
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,992
- Mmm!
- After we've made love.

518
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,819
- Okay.
- A sort of motivation for you.

519
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,949
Oh, great.

520
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,527
I'll be staying at the Mayfair Hotel.

521
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,813
You're a coward. Do you know that?

522
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,901
You're just like your father.
Walking out on your children, on your...

523
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,568
on your family.

524
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,325
Oh, Howard. Howard's here.

525
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,657
You're just in time
to see Daddy leaving.

526
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,040
Look after your mum.

527
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,208
Do you want to tell him
where you're going?

528
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,412
Go on.
Tell your son where you're going!

529
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,916
You're a lying, cheating bastard
and I hate you!

530
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,339
You just wait.

531
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,092
Wait until I tell Debbie
what her dad's really like.

532
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:37,050
That some stuck-up
fucking little vicar's daughter's

533
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,850
more important than she is.

534
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,520
Don't you dare turn Debbie against me.

535
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,097
Don't you threaten me.

536
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,016
(Paul sighs)

537
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,522
(Jean sobbing)

538
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,242
If only I could trust you.
Start a new life with you.

539
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,116
Tonight our happiness begins.

540
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,738
(Amber) Will you give me your word

541
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,449
-your wife means nothing to you?
- Nothing.

542
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:07,584
Evening, Jeff. Um, what dressing room
is Amber St George in?

543
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,040
Dressing room four, Mrs Raymond.

544
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,749
Dressing room four, thank you.

545
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,214
(man) Well, I'm not gonna wear this.

546
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,045
I mean, it just feels like
somebody else's suit

547
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,176
and I can't wear it.

548
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,799
(girls chatting, laughing)

549
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,816
(Jean) You keep your hands
off my husband.

550
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,608
He's got two children!

551
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,028
And they need a father,
even one like him.

552
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,317
He probably tells you you're special,
doesn't he'? Oh, he tells everyone that.

553
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,324
Do you know he's had half the girls
in every bloody show we've done?

554
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,156
- Has he had you, love, has he?
- No... (clears throat) ...Jean.

555
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,746
(Jean) Oh, you're nothing special.

556
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,794
In fact, I don't even know
what he sees in you.

557
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,122
You're just a jumped-up
posh little tart.

558
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,883
Well, have you got anything to say?
Can you speak?

559
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:53,959
(Amber) Yes, I can speak.

560
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,670
(mimics) "Yes, I can speak.
Yes, I can speak."

561
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,473
Don't you look your
snotty little nose up at me.

562
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,343
- Yes, can I help you?
-(giggling)

563
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,186
What are you looking at?

564
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,021
Oh, and you were rubbish
in the play tonight.

565
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,317
(actor) Thank you.

566
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,651
- Night-night, Jeff.
-(Jeff) Goodnight, Mrs Raymond.

567
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,241
(Amber) Is that Jean?

568
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,160
Is she following us?

569
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,078
You're being paranoid.

570
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,796
(Amber) I told you she was following us.

571
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,211
I'll go and talk to her.

572
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,593
(engine revving)

573
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,477
This is silly.

574
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,312
You're the one being silly.

575
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,019
It won't last.

576
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,063
- What won't?
- She won't!

577
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,653
Perhaps, but this is ridiculous.

578
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,076
It's not the 19th century.

579
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,904
Yeah, I don't care what
bloody century we're in!

580
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,113
I'm your wife!

581
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,075
She's making a fool out of me.
It's humiliating.

582
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,081
(Paul) Well, what are you doing here?
Go home.

583
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,289
- Get some sleep.
- Well, come with me.

584
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,675
Paul, come with me.
Get in the car now.

585
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,675
No.

586
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,469
If you don't leave her now
that is it, it's over.

587
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,178
That is absolutely it.

588
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,855
Don't you come running back begging.

589
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,611
Jean, I've never begged
for anything in my life.

590
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,864
Goodbye, then.

591
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,797
(tyres screeching)

592
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,925
Mrs Raymond, you're smiling.
How much did you get?

593
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,470
Well, I'm very, very happy
with the settlement.

594
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,719
It entitles me to 250,000.

595
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,717
Well, this is a great day.
It's like throwing away your crutches.

596
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:08,802
(laughing)

597
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,603
I deserve every penny.
I've worked damn hard.

598
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,680
(male reporter) There he is.

599
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,315
(all) Mr Raymond!

600
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,231
(female reporter) Mr Raymond, this is
one of the largest divorce settlements

601
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,657
this country's ever seen.

602
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,734
Ah, well, it's... I think you'll find

603
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,820
it's the largest divorce settlement
this country's ever seen.

604
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,033
Not bad for a boy who arrived from
Liverpool with five bob in his pocket.

605
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,283
(laughing)

606
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,833
Just gonna warn you,
I don't own the whole building.

607
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,004
Just the, uh, top floor.

608
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,709
(gasping)

609
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,715
Oh, I love it.

610
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,639
These are the two ladies with big balls.

611
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,931
(Amber) Ladies with balls.

612
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,759
Spirit of Ecstasy.

613
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,685
- You'll be seeing a bit more of him.
- Yes, you love that.

614
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,934
And this is, uh,
this is all designed by Ringo Starr.

615
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,895
- Oh, really?
- Yes. That lamp's a bit low.

616
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,976
Uh, yes. It's nice, isn't it?

617
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,106
(Amber) Ooh, I love it.

618
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,321
- Follow me, come on.
- Come on, I'm going to shoo you in.

619
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,522
- I'm the Pied Piper.
-(Amber laughs)

620
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,192
Follow me into the, er...
Well, not the sewer.

621
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,778
That wouldn't be appropriate
but, uh, the bedroom.

622
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,863
- Fairy-tale bed.
- Yes, it is.

623
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,537
You could get Snow White
and the Seven Dwarves on here.

624
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,334
Starting with, um, Dopey,

625
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,870
and, uh, Happy.

626
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,458
No dwarves.

627
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,876
- Really?
- Mmm.

628
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,590
Press this button.

629
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,794
(Amber) Ooh.

630
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,680
- Better close your eyes.
-(Amber gasps)

631
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,756
(Amber giggling)

632
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,476
(Amber) That is amazing.

633
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,017
(Paul) It's almost like living
inside a giant missile silo.

634
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,481
What, for your, uh, big rocket?

635
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,021
- Mmm. Yes.
- Mmm.

636
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,425
Your guest is seated at your table, sir.

637
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,930
Excellent.

638
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,807
(Tony) £12,000 to you.

639
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:18,265
I tried doing a magazine in the '60s.
Uh, King. It didn't work.

640
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,942
That's because you didn't know
what you were doing.

641
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:25,614
We will persuade readers that,
by buying Men Only,

642
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,942
they are buying into the world
of Paul Raymond. Right?

643
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,867
The world of cigars

644
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:33,823
and exotic holidays and luxury cars.

645
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,835
This will take the world of Paul Raymond
out to the nation.

646
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:38,998
There will be lots of girls.

647
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,962
Beautiful girls,
beautifully photographed.

648
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,293
We copy the car magazines, right?

649
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,091
We have,
as the face of our magazine,

650
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,670
we have a hot female columnist,
right,

651
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,347
and she road-tests the men of Europe.

652
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,013
I have a contact at John Menzies.

653
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:58,563
Menzies have 5,000 newsagents.
That's their own newsagents.

654
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:03,652
Their distribution arm
covers another 20,000.

655
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,528
It's a perfect,

656
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,610
perfect market for advertisers.

657
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,865
Well, if you can, er, edit
as well as you talk,

658
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,080
then, er...I'm very interested.

659
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:29,378
We're looking for someone who would,
erm, road-test the men of Europe.

660
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,837
Me.

661
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,339
- Could be.
- I'd like that job.

662
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,011
And I'm a very good driver.

663
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,720
It wouldn't be cars
that you'd be driving.

664
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,895
The columns will have to sound sexy.

665
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,972
- Yeah.
-(Amber clears throat)

666
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,354
"Her lips parted.

667
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,528
"His hot, hard member thrust into her."

668
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,983
-it's a good start.
- That's good, that's good.

669
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:53,073
"He pushed his tongue deep into
her hot, wet, velvet pussy."

670
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,486
Also good.

671
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,368
"He bit my lips hard

672
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:01,168
"and my whole body shuddered

673
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,121
"as his swelling member
forced its way inside me."

674
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,331
Can I see you with your clothes off?

675
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,629
- If you give me the job.
-(Tony chuckles)

676
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,086
(Tony) We have to think
what we're gonna call you.

677
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,671
Emily Spankhurst?

678
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,301
- That sounds like a porn name.
- Come on, be serious.

679
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,803
Georgina Allcock.

680
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,600
Oh! Iona Jaguar.

681
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,179
I own a Jaguar.

682
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,262
Yeah, we got...

683
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,231
- I don't like Iona. I don't like Iona.
- Oh. Um...

684
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,775
Fi-ona. Fiona Jaguar.

685
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,102
(Paul) It's too... It's too exotic.

686
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,479
- Fiona's good.
- Fiona Kent.

687
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,778
- Yeah.
- Fiona Kew.

688
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,902
- Fiona Richmond.
- Yeah, no, Fiona Richmond.

689
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,992
It's too like "Raymond".
It's too like you.

690
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,535
- Perfect.
-(Tony laughs)

691
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,611
Perfect.

692
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,198
- Oh, that's so romantic and sweet.
- Fiona Richmond.

693
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,492
My name is Fiona Richmond.

694
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,576
(camera clicking)

695
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:44,999
I'm a professional journalist,

696
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:49,549
hired by Britain's new and most
sophisticated men's magazine

697
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,720
to travel my way around Europe
and ask penetrating questions.

698
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,348
Need something to make it
a bit less picnic,

699
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,550
a bit more cornucopia.

700
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,310
Here you go. This is luxury.

701
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,053
It is dead.

702
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,639
- Should have had a crab.
-(laughing)

703
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,813
Around the World in Eighty Lays
by Fiona Richmond.

704
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,519
(assistant) More fan mail.
(Tony) More?

705
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,688
Bloody hell, we've created a monster.

706
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,156
And it's me!

707
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,572
(Fiona) Vladimir's strong hands
held me aloft

708
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,530
before dropping me down
on to his upright stalk.

709
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,080
"I wish that you would spank
my naughty bottom like mummy did."

710
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,132
- That might be for me.
-(laughter)

711
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,848
- Think of me.
- Or, if it helps, think of me.

712
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,183
Look at Paul but think of me.

713
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:45,935
A bit more tit.

714
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,986
The butcher's counter at Harrods,
is at Harrods,

715
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,866
but it's still selling meat, isn't it?
Right, so...

716
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,697
I'm not sure I like Fiona
being compared to a piece of meat.

717
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,785
(clears throat) She's tasty,
you want to eat her. She's rare.

718
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,180
-(footsteps)
-(bell tolling)

719
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,282
Pa, I was only smoking.

720
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,200
(Paul sighs)

721
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,290
That's not really a crime, is it?

722
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:54,712
Well, you were smoking a marijuana joint
which is illegal, yes.

723
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,844
I can't believe...

724
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:02,049
that that fat cow expelled me.

725
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,179
You're the one that wanted to
go to that school. You insisted.

726
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,764
Well, I want to go to drama school.

727
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,273
I want to follow in your footsteps
and go out into the world

728
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,897
and do all of those things.

729
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,281
(saxophone playing)

730
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,239
J1 I can hardly wait to hold you

731
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,450
J1 Feel my arms around you

732
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,037
J1 How long I have waited

733
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,293
J1 Waited just to love you

734
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,376
J1 Now that I have found you

735
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,928
J1 Don't ever go

736
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,559
(Paul) Here's to a star of tomorrow.
(Amber) Yes, absolutely.

737
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,760
Pa, thank you. Thank you.

738
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,224
- To Debbie Raymond.
-(Debbie) Cheers.

739
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,560
Cheers.

740
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:55,231
(Debbie) One thing,
if it's going to be an erotic show,

741
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,320
does that mean, um...
Would I be scantily clad?

742
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,740
No, you will not have to
take your clothes off, of course.

743
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,692
I would never ask my daughter
to do that.

744
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,992
(Debbie) 'Cause the other people
on stage... Thank you.

745
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,866
-...probably would...
- Yes, of course there'll be nudity.

746
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,448
- But you won't. No, no.
- I just wanted to make sure,

747
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,536
because I don't have the equipment
to, sort of, deliver the goods.

748
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,917
(cabaret music playing)

749
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:20,297
Remember to look up, look up.
Okay, now stay here.

750
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,088
(ma/e choreographer) One, two.
Really swivel those hips.

751
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,173
And two.

752
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,139
And look, and look and dance break.

753
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,393
At the sides.

754
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,561
(director) Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

755
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,149
- Cut, cut!
-(mouthing)

756
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,856
Cut.

757
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,158
Ok, let's get the girls in the hoops.

758
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,154
(both vocalising)

759
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,285
(director)
We've got Miss Nude International

760
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,793
followed by Genghis Khan
and Attila the Hun.

761
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:00,213
(Paul) I think Genghis Khan and
Attila the Hun together is too much,

762
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,714
because it's basically
rape and pillage twice.

763
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,552
Ladies.

764
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,476
- Hello.
- Hi.

765
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,144
My soubrette.

766
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,642
My ingénue.

767
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,769
(kissing)

768
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,316
Do you think I look stupid?

769
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,689
You look beautiful.

770
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,813
Like a peacock.

771
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,445
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Thank you all for waiting.

772
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,785
I hope I haven't kept you too long.

773
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,612
Uh, right.
Well, I'll set straight to it.

774
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,703
I'm here to announce
my latest production,

775
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,625
which is entitled Royalty Follies.

776
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:38,376
This will be the most expensive
production ever mounted

777
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,751
in the UK.

778
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,175
Uh, we understand that
your daughter is to be in the show.

779
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,672
Will she be topless?

780
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,048
No, she will not.

781
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,096
Isn't that a double standard?

782
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:51,268
Someone had to keep their clothes on
and Debbie bravely volunteered.

783
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,886
(laughing)

784
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,188
-(vocalising)
- Good.

785
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,644
(vocalising)

786
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,401
-(vocalising)
- Okay.

787
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,570
(cabaret music playing)

788
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,699
J1 My baby does it good

789
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,990
J1 He treats it like he should

790
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,294
J1 When I'm feeling down

791
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,167
J1 When I'm feeling gloomy

792
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,921
J1 I tell you now
he really socks it to me

793
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,553
J1 Shooby-do and sure enough

794
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,932
J1 My baby really knows his stuff

795
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,974
J1 Yeah, my baby does it good

796
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,770
J1 My baby does it good

797
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,901
(J1 Wig Wam Bam by Sweet)

798
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,693
(Russian music playing)

799
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:58,785
(woman coughing)

800
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,286
(snoring)

801
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,921
J1 Thank you for coming to Follies

802
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,681
J1 We hope that we'll see you soon

803
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:16,683
J1 We'd like you to know
just before you go

804
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,687
J1 Thank you for seeing our show

805
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,268
(music ends)

806
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,357
(scattered applause)

807
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,367
- Good morning, Dennis.
- Morning, sir.

808
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:36,580
- How are you'?
- Very well, thank you.

809
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,124
Good, good.

810
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,327
How bad is it?

811
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,371
Bookings just aren't coming in.

812
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,832
If it carries on like this
we're gonna take a real beating.

813
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,337
I don't understand. It's baffling.

814
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,760
I mean, there's something for everyone
in that show.

815
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,463
Is it the black and white baby or...

816
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,548
Oh, that's my favourite.
I love the black and white baby.

817
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,928
It's bloody hilarious.

818
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,260
I mean, we've got dolphins
pulling knickers off girls

819
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,812
for goodness sakes.
I mean, what's not to like?

820
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,941
Excuse me, Mr Raymond, I've got
a gentleman on the phone for you.

821
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,016
He says he's your son.

822
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,227
Well, just take his number.

823
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,154
I get a lot of crank calls.

824
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:12,529
Well, we've got to make sure
that Fiona's next show is a knockout.

825
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,235
- Yeah.
- We have to...

826
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,741
make as big a splash as possible.

827
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,915
Bigger than those damn dolphins.

828
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,535
My name is Paul Raymond.

829
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,494
This is Fiona Richmond.

830
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,209
Fiona Richmond is starring

831
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,880
in the West End farce Let's Get Laid,

832
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,921
starting this Thursday night.

833
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,180
If you enjoy, as I do,

834
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,553
looking at nude ladies,

835
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,555
please do come along.
You shan't be disappointed.

836
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,977
(woman) That's disgusting.

837
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,895
(Paul) No, it's not disgusting.
It's perfectly natural.

838
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:45,521
If it's good enough for Lady Godiva,
it's good enough for Fiona Richmond.

839
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,819
That's enough now.
Enough fun. Get off.

840
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,771
-(Fiona) Sorry, everyone.
- Come on, you've had your laughs.

841
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:53,442
Come on. All right, get rid
of the horse, it's blocking the road.

842
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,500
- Hi. Hello.
-(Carl) Lady Godiva.

843
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,421
- How are you?
- Oh, it went brilliantly.

844
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,672
Paul. Fiona. Let's get laid.

845
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,216
(glasses clinking)

846
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,551
(crowd cheering)

847
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,889
(cheering continues)

848
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,313
(Paul) I'd rather see a beautiful lady
with her top off

849
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,648
than a middle-aged man
with his pants down.

850
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,196
I mean, who wants to see Brian Rix
with his trousers down all the time?

851
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,739
(Fiona) Me!

852
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:38,365
Well, well, well. Deborah Raymond.
I didn't know you were here.

853
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,488
- Hello. You look gorgeous.
- Oh, hello.

854
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,040
Oh, you were wonderful this evening.

855
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,575
- Don't, I'm hardly in it.
- No...

856
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,411
This is all down to you.

857
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,329
Mwah! Hello, Mr Raymond.

858
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:52,759
Pa's really happy and
it's a smash hit, isn't it?

859
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,834
Mmm-hmm.

860
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,633
You're a very lucky man, Paul,

861
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,806
getting to share your bed with
such a beautiful and talented woman.

862
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,475
- Are you flirting with my girlfriend?
- Ah, I might be.

863
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,682
Should I be jealous?

864
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,596
Well, that's up to you.

865
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,690
How are the Follies going?

866
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,565
Oh, Tony, I don't want to talk about it.

867
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,568
Well, my apartment's right at the top,
so there's very little light pollution.

868
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,320
You can actually
see the stars from the bed.

869
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,651
I'd love to see it.

870
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,527
Are you all right, Debs? Are you okay?

871
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,446
Tired.

872
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,952
And I also have a sun...
sunbed above the bed

873
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,408
so you can get a tan at the same time.

874
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,744
I have something that'll cheer you up.

875
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,664
- Have to do it quick, right.
- Yeah.

876
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,420
This way... Trumpet. Toot-toot!
This way, right?

877
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,002
(inhaling deeply)

878
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,296
Ha! There you go.

879
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,719
(Kate) Wow, it's amazing!

880
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:52,318
Ah! Home at last.

881
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,565
(laughing)

882
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,197
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

883
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,490
I'm so glad you guys love each other.

884
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,364
- And, er... and I like you a lot.
-(laughing)

885
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,786
(Fiona) Wouldn't it be awful
if we didn't?

886
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,408
- And I like you a lot.
- Good.

887
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,037
(knocking)

888
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,414
- Here's Debbie.
- Hello.

889
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,046
- Hello, darling.
-(laughs)

890
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,510
Do you want us to, um, head on
when she... when she comes in?

891
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,339
- Uh, yes. Yes, if you wouldn't mind.
-(Carl) Could be a little bit awkward.

892
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:22,514
- Hello.
- Hi.

893
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,974
- How are you?
- Hello.

894
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,890
- Come, have a seat.
-(Debbie) Oh, thank you, Carl.

895
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,433
- There we are.
- Hi.

896
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,524
Thank you.

897
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,227
- Would you like a drop?
- Yes, please.

898
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,903
- How are you?
- How's the voice?

899
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,982
It's okay. It was a bit hoarse
when lwoke up this morning, yeah.

900
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:40,274
(Paul) It doesn't sound hoarse.

901
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,651
And, more importantly,
you don't look like a horse.

902
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,327
-(Debbie laughs)
-(Carl) Yeah, you certainly don't.

903
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,196
Not at this moment in time.

904
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,031
Pineapple juice is what you want
for the throat.

905
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,541
Tony, we ought to, uh...

906
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,459
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- See you at the bar.

907
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,081
Just a second.

908
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:53,834
- See you in a little bit.
- See you in a bit.

909
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:55,665
Apparently, as well,
if you have chocolate

910
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:56,874
it's good for your voice.

911
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,425
It soothes it.

912
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,629
Um, I was thinking, uh,
we should think, er...

913
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,010
of perhaps finding another vehicle
for your talents.

914
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,891
I really like the Follies, though.

915
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,348
I know. I just think, you know,
we should find something else.

916
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,479
I don't think we should.
I really enjoy it

917
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,774
-and I really enjoy it every night.
- I'm thinking of cancelling the show.

918
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,861
The public were not ready.

919
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,530
They didn't understand it,
they didn't get it. More fool them.

920
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:23,527
I mean, is it my...
is it my fault?

921
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,657
No, it's not.
Of course it's not your fault, no.

922
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,864
It was haemorrhaging cash, you know.

923
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,075
I've got to balance the books,
you know, that's...

924
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,378
Well, what am I gonna do now, Pa?

925
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,248
I want to be able to act
and I want to be able to sing.

926
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,174
And I was doing that
and now everyone's going to...

927
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,376
Don't cry.

928
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,929
But they're going to know that
I was in the show that you put me in

929
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,883
and I wasn't good enough
and now nobody's going to hire me

930
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,513
in anything else ever again.

931
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:49,893
Don't cry.

932
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:54,145
I'm sorry, Pa, but I'm upset
about what you've just told me!

933
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,726
But don't cry!
The show's losing money!

934
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:01,531
I can't haemorrhage cash
just because you want to sing.

935
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,575
Don't cry, there's nothing to cry about.

936
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,278
- I can't help crying, I'm sorry.
- There's nothing to cry about!

937
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,783
(sobbing) I'm sorry.

938
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:12,162
(stutters) Dry your tears. Come on.
Come on, dry your tears.

939
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,913
(waiter) Anything else for Miss Raymond?

940
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,873
Can I have some champagne?

941
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,921
(waiter) Would you like
another bottle of champagne?

942
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,419
Yes. Yes, please, Carl.

943
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,713
(muffled sobbing)

944
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,294
(Paul) Your mascara's running.

945
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:27,723
I'm just gonna go, um...
I'm just gonna go to the loo.

946
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,895
(overlapping chatter)

947
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,272
Tony, do you have, um, a pick-me-up?

948
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,488
- Are you all right, sweetheart?
- I'm okay. Yeah.

949
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,569
Yeah, thank you. Thanks.

950
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,244
(Carl) Didn't take that so well.
(Tony) No, she didn't.

951
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,583
I think you should watch that.

952
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:58,003
- Oh, she's fine. She's a big girl.
- She's a kid.

953
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,547
(toilet flushing)

954
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,812
(upbeat jazz music)

955
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:23,855
-(Fiona) Hi.
- Good evening, Tony.

956
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,443
Evening.

957
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:27,983
Deb?

958
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,694
(Debbie) Um, I'll have
a vodka tonic, thank you.

959
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,404
(Tony) And a scotch, please.

960
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,334
-It's quite phallic, isn't it?
- Yes.

961
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:40,788
If my penis was shaped like a saxophone
I'd seek urgent medical attention.

962
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,164
There's Pa over there

963
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,462
with those girls.

964
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,301
They look about 12 years old.

965
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:47,970
I tell you, I did love the show, but...

966
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,805
You know what he's like.

967
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,640
Yeah, I do know what he's like.
That's what pisses me off.

968
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,390
Well, I've got some hard feeling.
Well, I will have later...

969
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,642
Look, come on, let's do a line.

970
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,690
(Fiona) Is she angry with Daddy?

971
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,313
Okay-

972
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,358
Keep these two lovely dishes
on the boil.

973
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,149
'Cause I'm working up
quite a large appetite.

974
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,316
Excuse me.

975
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,152
Oh, do you mind?

976
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,168
(laughing)

977
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,414
Oh, hi. (clears throat) Er, right.

978
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,795
(stutters) This isn't
what it looks like, obviously.

979
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,502
No, we... we were literally
just having a snog in the ladies.

980
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,554
No. No, no, no. Whoa! No, no, no.
We were just...

981
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,926
Where did you get this?

982
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,183
If you're just buying it
off some random guy in the street,

983
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,511
you're crazy. It's junk.

984
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,347
If you're gonna do this kind of thing,
get the good stuff.

985
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,979
Yeah, well, that's mine, Paul,
so it is the good stuff, so...

986
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,478
Oh, right. Well, good.

987
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,275
But thank you for your advice.
I will remember that forever.

988
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,114
- Tony, uh, take her home.
- Pa.

989
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:54,946
- Come on, Debs. Come on.
- Are you being serious?

990
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,661
No, this is the first time
I've been happy all daylong.

991
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,287
- Come on, Debbie. Look, this is...
- Dad...

992
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,538
(Tony) I'll put you in a cab.

993
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,416
(Debbie) Go have fun
with your four-year-old friends.

994
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:06,750
- And you're just being an old man.
- Yeah, and you've made me an old man.

995
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:29,280
All of us are in the gutter.
But some of us are looking at the stars.

996
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,698
'(Q/TU Wow.
-(kissing)

997
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:32,775
(Paul sighs)

998
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,031
That was Oscar Wilde,
by the way, said that.

999
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,953
- I know.
-(9i99liﬂ9)

1000
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,289
(Paul) Well, I don't mind
pushing the envelope,

1001
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:44,461
you know, taking a risk.

1002
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,289
I don't want to show too much pink.

1003
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,715
Of course. It's gonna be classy.

1004
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,129
-(Paul) No penetration.
-No, no, no, no. No, no. No.

1005
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,803
- If it's interesting we can give it a...
-"interesting"?

1006
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,472
This is an opportunity
for us to re-write

1007
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,549
the cultural history of this nation.

1008
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,385
And these girls are prepared to do that?

1009
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,636
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

1010
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,523
-(Tony) Okay, a bit too much tease.
-(camera clicking)

1011
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,695
Let's take 'em down. Down.
That's good, that's it.

1012
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,273
Back against the wall.

1013
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:13,403
I want to see something.

1014
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,777
I don't want to think
I might be seeing something.

1015
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,860
I want to see it.

1016
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,201
Lovely, that's great. That's good.

1017
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,663
(camera clicking)

1018
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,908
if you come... Yeah. That's it.

1019
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:25,999
No, that's good.

1020
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,960
That's it. This isn't...
It's not Germany. So we'll just...

1021
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,879
That's it, that's it. Beautiful.

1022
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:35,634
Look at that. I fucking love this girl.

1023
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,597
We've got to use her again,
she's amazing.

1024
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,217
- Can I have a look, please?
-(Paul) Yes, please do.

1025
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,347
- I'm very worried about this.
- Oh, Paul.

1026
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,436
(Paul) Are we going to
run into problems with that?

1027
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,972
-(Tony) No...
-(chuckles) I think we are going to

1028
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:48,810
run into severe problems
with half of these images, I'd say.

1029
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,185
-(publisher 2) Yes.
- Why?

1030
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,486
(publisher 1) She's got her bum
in your face here.

1031
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,405
You can see her bum-hole here.

1032
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,107
Right in your face.

1033
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,151
And, you know, I can't see
her middle finger there.

1034
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,032
So men are just gonna assume
that's inside her.

1035
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:00,112
- That's obscene.
- Really?

1036
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,493
- Well, it's not in her fanny.
- I don't... I don't remember that.

1037
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:03,950
(publisher 1) Do we need
to take these kind of risks?

1038
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,659
-(Tony) Yes!
- On the day it wasn't inside her.

1039
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,086
(Tony) No,
it's definitely not inside her.

1040
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,454
Not during the shoot, anyway.

1041
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,541
I think we have to ask ourselves
if we're pornographers or not.

1042
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,885
With all due respect,
I do not publish, uh, pornography.

1043
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,131
I, earlier today, obtained
these Scandinavian publications

1044
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,090
from, uh, a Soho outlet.

1045
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:24,558
Now these are what I call pornography.

1046
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,263
Héstspela, for example,

1047
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,314
which, you know,
is literally "Horseplay"

1048
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,523
in, um...Scandinavian.

1049
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,437
And, by the way,
this is not your common or garden

1050
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,569
equestrian publication,
I can assure you of that. Um...

1051
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:41,036
The Obscene Publications Squad today
impounded more than 300,000 copies

1052
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,079
of Paul Raymond's magazine Men Only.

1053
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,833
It's the largest amount of pornography
ever seized in Britain.

1054
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,999
(Carl) Tony, I think
you should let me go first.

1055
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,624
Ah, you'll only depress him, Carl.

1056
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,877
(Carl) It'd be better if you let me
do the talking.

1057
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:54,716
- Paul.
-(Carl) Paul.

1058
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,841
Those joyless, puritanical bastards.

1059
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,638
(Carl) Yeah, I know.

1060
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,681
You know, they're the Roundheads
and we're the Cavaliers.

1061
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,050
Yeah, who won?

1062
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,143
(Paul) It's as if
masturbation doesn't exist.

1063
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,389
Think of one person who you can say
has never had a wank.

1064
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:12,025
-(Tony) Mother Teresa?
- All right, name me another person.

1065
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,985
-(Tony) Gandhi.
- Come on.

1066
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,359
(doorbell ringing)

1067
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,406
(Paul) Oh, Jenny,
it's all right, I'll get it.

1068
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,241
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

1069
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,665
(sighs)

1070
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:32,087
Darryl. Pleased to meet you.

1071
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,214
Come in.

1072
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,258
So you found us all right?

1073
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:37,964
Yeah, ljumped in a black cab at Euston.

1074
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,303
I'm here on business as well
as seeing you, you know.

1075
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,847
Oh, right. What kind of business?

1076
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,640
Uh, it's a job interview, yeah.

1077
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,137
(Paul) Right, very good.

1078
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,639
I like your flat.

1079
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,267
It's like something out of James Bond.

1080
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,064
(laughs) it is a bit.

1081
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:55,110
Yeah, what's the... what's the
guy called? Dr No. It's like, yeah.

1082
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,318
Yes, but it's a...
I don't have the white cat, I'm afraid.

1083
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,738
Yes. Uh, Ringo helped me
design it, actually.

1084
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,615
Ringo Starr from the Beatles.

1085
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,662
- Oh, you know him?
- Well, I know all the Beatles.

1086
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,785
Very friendly with them,
apart from Yoko.

1087
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:11,001
Now, Darryl, can I offer you
a glass of champagne?

1088
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,128
It's a very, very nice bottle.

1089
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,331
(stutters) Yeah, I've had it before.

1090
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,175
And by the way,
it's not Darryl, it's Derry.

1091
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,169
Okay, well, Derry it is.

1092
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:23,263
I changed my name many years ago.
I used to be called Geoffrey.

1093
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,555
- Geoffrey.
- Yes.

1094
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,632
(ice cubes rattle)

1095
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,306
(Derry) It's really nice.

1096
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:34,225
You know, for years I'd tell people
that you were dead.

1097
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,478
That's what Mum...
what Mum told me to say.

1098
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,652
And then I find out that
not only are you not dead,

1099
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,029
but you're Paul bloody Raymond.

1100
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,530
It's just...

1101
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,365
It's just, I don't know.

1102
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,865
Your mother was very young
when she fell pregnant.

1103
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,250
Yeah, she was, urn, 17.

1104
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,413
I, uh... (clears throat)
I kept up the maintenance payments.

1105
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,915
Thirty shillings a week until I was 21.

1106
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,008
Yes.

1107
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,303
You know, we even share
the same birthday.

1108
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,180
15th of November.

1109
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,516
Yes, it's quite a coincidence, isn't it?

1110
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,101
(Derry) Mmm.

1111
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:12,472
Yeah, so when I was...
blowing out candles on my birthday cake

1112
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,682
at some point during that day,
you'd be doing the same.

1113
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:18,481
Well, I haven't actually had a
birthday cake since 1958, but, uh...

1114
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:23,232
I've got some old photos
if you want to see 'em. I've got, um...

1115
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,404
One of you and Mum.

1116
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,993
(Paul) Good Lord.

1117
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:34,368
We both look so young.

1118
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,334
Your mother is a fine-looking woman.

1119
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,383
Yeah. Yeah.

1120
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:45,880
I've got some pictures of me
if you want to see them.

1121
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,385
Yes, of course. Please do.

1122
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,389
Show you these...

1123
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,647
There's another one of you and Mum.

1124
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,697
(Paul) That's Southend.
You can tell by the, er... by the pier.

1125
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,534
Did a lot of the seaside resorts,
when we were touring.

1126
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,700
(chuckles)

1127
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,456
- It's so funny.
- Mmm.

1128
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,713
Uh... And that's you, is it?

1129
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:23,509
Yeah. That's... that's me
at the seaside.

1130
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,336
(Paul) Yes, you've got
a very characterful face.

1131
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,420
-(Derry) Thanks.
- Yes.

1132
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,807
- There she is again.
- Yeah.

1133
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,350
- That's you as a baby, is it?
- Yeah.

1134
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,265
I think I was about three weeks.

1135
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,347
(Paul) Yes, she looks very happy.

1136
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,277
Such a long time ago.

1137
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,361
(sighs) Another life.

1138
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,863
Yeah, urn, thanks for dinner.
It's really nice to meet you.

1139
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,665
Well, absolutely.
And thank you for getting in touch

1140
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:57,334
and I thought it was very worthwhile.

1141
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,623
Well, goodbye, Derry.

1142
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,918
Yeah, goodbye, Paul.

1143
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,545
(Paul) Take care.

(Debbie) Hi.

I'm Paul Raymond.

1153
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,764
(Paul) I really want to emphasise

1154
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,467
-we only do coke socially.
- Absolutely, yes.

1155
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,969
We just happen to be
very sociable people.

1156
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,896
I like to do it anti-socially myself.

1157

1161
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,412
Okay, I'd like to propose a toast

Oh, my back. I'm joking, I'm joking.

a good start to a conversation.

I'm leaving, Paul.

I'm tired of it.

1178
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:44,887
Is there anybody else?

1179
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,059
No.

1180
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,981
Captain of the cruise ship in St Tropez?

1181
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,809
No.

1182
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,610
Cocktail waiter in Jamaica?

1183
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,274
No.

1184
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,323
Is it me?

1185
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,576
Don't answer that. (chuckles)

1186
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,042
- Yes.
- Yes.

1187
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,749
Is it something I've done?

1188
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:15,508
Something I've, uh, not done?

1189
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,549
Something I could do?

1190
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,256
You're never gonna change, Paul.

1191
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,346
Where will you go?

1192
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,845
I'm going to go and live with Debbie.

1193
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,481
Debbie knew you were going to leave me
before I did?

1194
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,479
- You wanted us to be friends.
-(sighs)

1195
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,604
Well, uh, I own Debbie's flat

1196
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:39,862
and, urn, technically
she's not allowed to sublet.

1197
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,693
- It's in the lease.
- I'm sorry.

1198
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:46,243
J1 Anyone who ever loved

1199
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,748
J1 Could look at me

1200
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,127
J1 And know that I love you

1201
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,880
J1 Anyone who ever dreamed

1202
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,754
J1 Could look at me

1203
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:05,054
J1 And know I dream of you

1204
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:10,347
J1 Knowing I love you so

1205
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,184
J1 Anyone who had a heart

1206
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:19,569
J1 Would take me in his arms
and love me, too

1207
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:23,448
<i>J1 You couldn't really have</i> a <i>heart
and hurt me-..</i>

1208
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,995
(doorbell rings)

1209
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,711
Pa?

1210
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,838
Pa?

1211
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:47,934
Are you all right?

1212
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:52,772
I don't know.

1213
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,442
Oh, dear.

1214
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,159
Did Fiona send you?

1215
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,951
No, she didn't.

1216
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,166
You haven't got
a temperature or anything.

1217
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,665
I just feel old.

1218
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,554
I don't think you're old.

1219
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:33,397
Oh, Pa. You can't just lie here
and feel miserable all day, can you?

1220
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:35,936
Yes.

1221
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,396
No.

1222
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:41,439
Come on. You're getting up.
And we're going out!

1223
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,403
You're going to feel much better.

1224
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,278
I'll get you some clothes.

1225
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:54,118
Come on, you're Paul Raymond.
You're not Geoffrey bloody Quinn.

1226
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,416
Let's have some caffeine, first of all.

1227
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:03,172
And then let's go and
have some champagne.

1228
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,842
Go to L'Escargot for dinner,
and we'll go out to a club

1229
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,092
and we'll have lots and lots
and lots of fun.

1230
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,590
Just what the doctor ordered.

1231
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,767
Did you hear that, Chris?

1232
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,561
I'm afraid it's going to be
a late one tonight.

1233
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,722
Good, I've been missing them.

1234
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,275
(Debbie) It's just beautiful
at night-time.

1235
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,228
(Paul) Everything looks beautiful
at night-time.

1236
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,563
-(Debbie) No, this.
-(Paul laughs)

1237
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,067
This is beautiful.

1238
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:28,277
(Paul) Henry VIII used to
use this area as his hunting ground.

1239
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,995
And "Soho" was his battle cry.

1240
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,244
- So-ho.
- So-ho, you know.

1241
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:34,495
- So-ho.
-(imitating horn blowing)

1242
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,498
(howls) So-ho!

1243
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,999
(laughing)

1244
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,751
Sorry.

1245
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,666
(howls) So-ho!

1246
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,797
(people cheering)

1247
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:47,129
I own all of you!

1248
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,923
(chuckles) Well, actually,
the Queen owns the pavement, darling.

1249
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,932
No. Soho!

1250
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,553
(J1 disco)

1251
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:57,856
(waiter) Anything else, Mr Raymond?

1252
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,612
I think the magazine needs a revamp.

1253
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,363
It's a little old-hat and I think
we need to make some changes.

1254
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,111
- Do you have any big changes in mind?
- Yes.

1255
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:14,323
Yes, I think we need to, er...
fire Fiona.

1256
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:18,164
(Debbie) What are you two doing
sitting here like two wallflowers?

1257
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:23,999
I know what you're thinking.
"Her father's come to pick her up."

1258
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,129
(laughter)

1259
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,051
But, no, I'm here under m own volition.
Y

1260
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,963
I am here to dance.

1261
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,132
He is actually here to pick her up.

1262
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:33,424
(Paul) Les girls.

1263
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:35,385
- Yeah.
-(girls) Whoo!

1264
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:39,518
We're looking for new beautiful girls
and we were wondering if you knew any.

1265
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:40,940
(laughter)

1266
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,776
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
You're very, very beautiful, all of you.

1267
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:45,945
(blows kisses) Sexy ladies!

1268
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,489
You wouldn't think I was 35.

1269
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:58,367
I'm here to tell you about
the re-launch of Men Only.

1270
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,831
Paul, how do you think Fiona feels
about getting the sack?

1271
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,292
I don't know how she felt. Um...

1272
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:06,545
All I know is it's, of course,
always unpleasant

1273
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,126
when you have to fire somebody.

1274
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:10,967
Is Men Only gonna become
more pornographic?

1275
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,433
It is not pornographic
and it will never be pornographic.

1276
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,510
Is Men Only degrading to women?

1277
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:22,356
- No, it is not.
-(chuckling)

1278
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,518
(Paul) Oh, that's fabulous.

1279
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:26,315
(Tony laughs)

1280
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:27,611
(Tony) Yeah, that's good. That's great.

1281
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,360
Think it could be a little more Sapphic?

1282
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:32,071
He wants you to just lick her.

1283
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,576
Turn round, Nicole, go down and...

1284
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,777
That's it, yes!

1285
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,033
(Paul) You're doing a great job, girls.

1286
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,409
Let's have a quid pro quo.

1287
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:38,489
Huh?

1288
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:40,450
- He means, urn, the other way...
- Do it for each other.

1289
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,534
Yeah, do it for each other.

1290
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,830
Little more sensual.

1291
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,164
Can we get some, uh, Vaseline?

1292
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,504
(cameraman) Yeah.

1293
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:49,880
We don't want the jar in the shot.

1294
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,294
Yeah, that's it.

1295
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,549
(Paul) Excellent, yeah.

1296
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:55,923
I do like the blue shoes.

1297
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,600
(Chloe) I really like them.

1298
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,848
- I want Tony to get me some.
- Whatever colour, I don't mind.

1299
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,929
I don't normally see the colour.
They're usually behind my head.

1300
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:03,765
- What, on a shelf?
-(Tony laughs) No.

1301
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,813
No, I can feel 'em,
I just can't see 'em.

1302
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:08,065
- Do you like these, Chloe?
- I think it'd look better maybe

1303
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,272
if there was two blondes, though,
instead of the brunette.

1304
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:11,732
I'm blond, we'll do it with me.

1305
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,738
We could always do two blondes
and then you in the middle or something.

1306
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,818
- You like that idea, Tony?
-(Tony) No.

1307
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:16,949
- I do.
-(Paul) You see,

1308
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:18,154
she knows which side
her bread's buttered.

1309
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,454
And it wouldn't just be the bread
that's buttered.

1310
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,531
(Tony) on!

1311
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:21,992
Have you seen Last Tango In Paris?

1312
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,623
- I haven't.
-(mimics Marlon Brando) Pass the butter.

1313
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,501
Pass, pass... Pass the butter.

1314
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,959
Hey, pass the butter.
And the Worcester sauce.

1315
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,503
Wouldn't the Worcester Sauce sting?

1316
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,587
Precisely.

1317
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,514
(normal voice) No, he wouldn't
use a word like that, would he?

1318
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:37,932
(mimics Marlon Brando)
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you got it.

1319
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,513
-(laughs)
-(Paul) Something like that.

1320
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,019
(telephone ringing)

1321
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,653
Hello.

1322
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,568
Ward... Ward West 8.

1323
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,696
- Straight up there on the right.
- Thank you.

1324
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:58,528
- He knows what he's doing?
- Yeah...

1325
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,158
Um, excuse me,
I'm looking for Deborah Raymond.

1326
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,623
- Oh, she's just through there, sir.
- Thank you.

1327
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,830
Hello. You must be Jonathan.

1328
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,832
Yes. And you are?

1329
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,128
- Paul...
- Raymond.

1330
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,330
Precisely.

1331
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,173
Is she all right?

1332
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:14,628
Uh, yeah, she's, er, sleeping
at the moment. They gave her something.

1333
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,681
(Paul) So, um, what happened?
Enlighten me, please.

1334
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,716
I heard a crash
so I went to have a look.

1335
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,642
Um, I found Debbie.

1336
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:23,845
Her boyfriend lives
in my block of flats.

1337
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:26,856
Um, and she looked pretty messed-up

1338
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:29,442
so I, er...
brought her here, you know.

1339
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,312
Well, thanks. Thank you.

1340
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,147
Hi.

1341
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,356
Good evening.

1342
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,192
Have you met Jonathan, Pa?

1343
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,243
(Paul) Yeah, we have been speaking, yes.

1344
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:43,073
You know he rescued me,
like a knight in a fairy tale?

1345
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,459
Yeah. Sounds like
you're severely concussed.

1346
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,003
He writes songs.

1347
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,589
He's going to write a song
for me to sing.

1348
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:52,798
That's the plan.

1349
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:53,916
It's kismet.

1350
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,715
I thought there was already
a song called Kismet.

1351
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,175
What songs have you written?

1352
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,256
Uh, mainlyjingles for commercials.

1353
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:04,556
I'm very good friends with the Beatles,
apart from Yoko.

1354
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,105
Ringo actually designed
my, er, apartment.

1355
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:10,354
Cool.

1356
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,355
I thought you were going to be
a theatre impresario like your Pa.

1357
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:16,607
- What's happened with that?
- Oh, I'm gonna do that as well.

1358
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:20,277
You know, I can do whatever I like

1359
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:24,247
because I'm feeling lucky.

1360
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,290
(Debbie laughs)

1361
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,247
Six, take one.

1362
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:32,748
(interviewer) Some people will say
you're only able to produce this play

1363
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,332
because your father is Paul Raymond.

1364
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:37,423
Pa's renting the theatre to us
for a thousand quid a week.

1365
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,634
J1 You and I have found a world

1366
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,596
J1 Where dreams will come true

1367
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:49,273
I could just sit around eating cake
because I'm Paul Raymond's daughter,

1368
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:52,685
but that's not my way, really.

1369
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,269
I'm... I'm a worker.

1370
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,607
Debbie is a very hard-working
professional producer.

1371
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,574
There's no doubt in my mind that...

1372
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,573
Women Behind Bars
will be a huge success.

1373
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:06,532
J1 ...together, you and I...

1374
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:09,580
(engineer) That's fantastic.
Just some, uh, technical issues our end,

1375
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,377
but you're sounding great.

1376
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:16,508
'Cause people like you are like the
slime at the bottom of the shower stall.

1377
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:19,135
After a while, it gets so thick

1378
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:23,093
all the Dutch cleanser in the world
can't get it off.

1379
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,185
If you don't love me,
you don't love everybody.

1380
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,477
(chuckles)

1381
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:33,225
(Paul) I'd like to propose a toast
to my new impresario

1382
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,605
and my always-gorgeous leading lady.

1383
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:37,604
- Cheers.
-(all) Cheers.

1384
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,781
I'd like to propose a toast of my own

1385
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,324
to...

1386
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,699
marriage and to Jonathan.

1387
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,213
Thank you.

1388
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,591
(waitress) Good evening, Mr Raymond.
(Paul) Now, this is Jean.

1389
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:09,185
(Paul) America suits you.
Your tan's almost as deep as mine.

1390
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:12,146
I'd have said it's
twice as deep, actually.

1391
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,098
- You like my hair'?
-(Paul) Yes, very nice.

1392
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,975
It's got a sort of a...

1393
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,310
a Myra Hindley effect.

1394
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,813
Say what you like about her,
you know, she was a looker.

1395
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,987
So, Howard, are you missing home?

1396
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:26,035
America's more like home for me.

1397
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,737
America's a big market for us now.

1398
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,946
- Mmm.
-Isn't it?

1399
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:30,998
Tony's doing a really fantastic job.

1400
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,825
He's really making quite a fortune

1401
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,458
-which is great for us. So...
-it's great. Yeah.

1402
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:36,921
- Yeah.
-(Howard) Yeah.

1403
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,377
He's sort of like a son to Pa.

1404
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:43,386
Howard, er...
has made no secret of the fact

1405
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,634
he's not particularly interested
in the business.

1406
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:49,388
- Not like you, Debbie, is he?
- No, you prefer, sort of,

1407
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:52,095
-playing tennis and...
- Shame about your tits, really.

1408
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,055
Otherwise you could
work in the Revue Bar

1409
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,061
or be in Men Only, like your friend.

1410
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:57,688
Fiona?

1411
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:58,984
- Whatever she calls herself now.
- Yeah.

1412
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,904
She's not in Men Only. Um...
Pa sacked her, so...

1413
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,612
Oh. I thought she sacked Dad.

1414
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:07,489
No, you're wrong. I sacked her,
so you're wrong about that.

1415
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,570
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's enough, you two.

1416
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,373
Come along,
we're supposed to be celebrating.

1417
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,540
Y3)'-

1418
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,034
(glass tinkling)

1419
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,332
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Could I have your attention, please?

1420
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,960
My name is Paul Raymond.
I am the...

1421
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,882
-(shushing)
- Thank you. ...er, father of the bride.

1422
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:24,510
- That's what you think.
-(laughter)

1423
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:28,680
Deborah, you look super,
you've got a smashing figure,

1424
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,137
and I'm very proud of you.

1425
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,470
She may not be a double-D

1426
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:36,021
but, to me, she'll always be three-D.

1427
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,600
- My darling daughter Deborah. Ah.
-(guests) Aw.

1428
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,860
Someone came up to me earlier
outside and said,

1429
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:45,236
"I understand that the wedding
cost in excess of £75,000."

1430
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,362
I said, "Please don't
talk about money, it's vulgar.

1431
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:51,196
"And anyway," I added, "their wedding
was actually closer to £95,000."

1432
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,572
(scattered laughter)

1433
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:53,823
(inhaling)

1434
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,492
(sniffling)

1435
01:14:58,494 --> 01:14:59,871
J1 And put the freshness back

1436
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,213
J1 Do the shake and vac...

1437
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,503
- I love that! I love that. Oh!
- Guilty as charged.

1438
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,422
Hi.

1439
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,260
(Jean) Don't call me Mum, call me Jean.

1440
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,717
Well, you're very, very, very gorgeous

1441
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,186
and I'm very proud to have you
as my son-in-law.

1442
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,897
- I can't believe you're my...
- Am I interrupting you two?

1443
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,561
- Huh?
- Hi, Debs.

1444
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:21,104
Hi.

1445
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:23,444
Hi. I, um...

1446
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,191
- What?
- I'll see you later.

1447
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,194
- See you later.
- Yeah, see you later.

1448
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,363
(Jonathan) She's great.
(Debbie) She's unbelievable.

1449
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:31,156
You should get a room, you two.
Why don't you do that?

1450
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,822
- You been dancing?
- No, I haven't been dancing, Jonathan.

1451
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,531
I've just been watching my mother
dance with you.

1452
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,283
(Jonathan) Don't be cross with me.
It wasn't me that was...

1453
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,994
I'm not cross, Jonathan. I'm not 14.

1454
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:41,704
Welcome to the family, Jonathan.

1455
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,665
-(softly) Cheers.
- You've been welcomed.

1456
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,422
Our condolences on this sad day.

1457
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,501
(Jonathan chuckles)

1458
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,379
This is more like a fucking funeral.

1459
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,344
So, what are you doing later on?

1460
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,850
Probably going to bed.

1461
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,219
-(Paul) With me?
- No.

1462
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:00,356
-(Paul) Uh, alone?
-(chuckles) Probably.

1463
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:05,562
Mmm. I mean, my bed's too big
to sleep in all by myself.

1464
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:08,823
Well, that was always
the problem, wasn't it?

1465
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:12,528
I prefer a bed big enough
forjust two people.

1466
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:14,820
Oh.

1467
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,827
You know what?
I want you to have my children.

1468
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:21,957
Seriously. They're outside in the car.
You can take 'em now if you like.

1469
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,253
(both laugh)

1470
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:25,915
(wolf whistles)

1471
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,505
Who is that foxy lady?

1472
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,837
- Oh, it might be me.
-(laughing)

1473
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,844
You are looking absolutely sensational.

1474
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,301
Oh, thank you very much.

1475
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,260
Are you feeling very lonely
now you've lost your girlfriend?

1476
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,689
- Well, I can always get a girl.
- Well, I certainly know that.

1477
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,309
(Paul) No, seriously,
you're looking better than ever.

1478
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,235
Better than women half your age.
That's a compliment, by the way.

1479
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:48,730
Cheeky bugger.

1480
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:52,446
Do I look good enough
to be on the cover of Men Only?

1481
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,823
If you want to be. Is that an offer?

1482
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:56,578
Might be.

1483
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,457
Are we ready, Mr Bailey?

1484
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,126
(Paul) Hop on.

1485
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,794
(Jean) Which way, backwards or forwards?

1486
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,416
(Paul) Which way do you want to start?

1487
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:06,543
I'm gonna do both, so...

1488
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:07,631
Right, look back at me.

1489
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,878
Take the bloody picture.

1490
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,588
(camera clicking)

1491
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,140
Where the hell is Tony, by the way?
(stammers) There's no make-up artist.

1492
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:17,341
No black and white film stock.

1493
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:19,347
What's going on? What's wrong with him?

1494
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:20,848
Oh, that's beautiful.

1495
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,350
Desire me.

1496
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,348
Oh, Golly gosh!

1497
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:26,058
Change of scenery. Great.

1498
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,269
Did you know Debbie's doing drugs?

1499
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:30,696
- Who said that?
- Well, is it true?

1500
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,650
She's an adult.
She can take care of herself.

1501
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:34,733
(knocking on door)

1502
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,318
Come in.

1503
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,655
Anna, will you tell me the truth?
You're another woman. Do I look red?

1504
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,990
- You look gorgeous.
- See?

1505
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,000
I bet Fiona got hair and make-up.

1506
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:44,459
-(Paul) Oh, darling, just...
-(camera clicking)

1507
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:46,833
Look at me. Look at me, darling.
We know what's under there.

1508
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,664
That's excellent. No love, just lust.

1509
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,420
(Tony) lwish I had half your talent

1510
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,671
for manipulating people.

1511
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,424
-(Paul) Manipulate?
- She must want you back. Doesn't she?

1512
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,637
She doesn't want me back.

1513
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,842
She just wants to show me
that other men still desire her.

1514
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,177
Yeah, well, I desire her.
Fucking hell, look at that.

1515
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:04,017
(Paul)
I'm thinking of taking a year off.

1516
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,518
- Oh, yeah?
-(Paul) Going to live in a monastery

1517
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:06,645
like a monk.

1518
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:07,850
(Tony) What, Rasputin?

1519
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:09,226
(inhaling)

1520
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,897
- That's very good stuff.
- Yeah. Only the best.

1521
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:14,990
Yeah, it's not too, er...
it's not too buzzy.

1522
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:17,322
(Tony) He's good. He doesn't...
he doesn't cut it with any shit.

1523
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,242
(Tony)
We need to shift up a gear, right.

1524
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,245
The magazine needs to...
needs to stay on top.

1525
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:25,372
We've, uh... We're, you know...
We've dropped down to third, second.

1526
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:29,414
We're revving hard
but we're stuck on a hill or...

1527
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:31,043
I don't know, I don't know.

1528
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:32,758
We've caught too many red lights
or whatever.

1529
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:36,387
We need to put
the serious driving gloves on

1530
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,263
because we don't...
we don't want to get, you know...

1531
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,882
we don't want to get blisters,

1532
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:43,056
uh, gripping the wheel too hard
whilst we're stuck...

1533
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,437
Well, I think I know
what you're talking about.

1534
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,014
We need to be in the fast lane.

1535
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,440
(TOW) Yes.

1536
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,018
(overlapping chatter)

1537
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:53,904
(inhaling)

1538
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:58,867
I shouldn't bring my work home
with me, you know, Tony, huh.

1539
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:00,695
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo.

1540
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,196
(laughing)

1541
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:06,909
Can you not see
I am making great art here?

1542
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:08,832
(moaning)

1543
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:10,829
(inhaling)

1544
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,587
Well, it's not the neatest line
I've ever set up!

1545
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,592
That's fantastic.

1546
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,845
A sort of albino Supremes.

1547
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,343
Sort of Chicken Supreme.

1548
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:28,021
Paul Raymond, a name once
synonymous with sophistication,

1549
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:32,352
has been accused by the Sunday Times
of organising prostitution

1550
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,277
from one of his clubs in Soho,

1551
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:35,525
the Pink Pussycat.

1552
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:36,651
(Paul) "Sex for sale."

1553
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:37,902
I can't believe I bloody fell for it.

1554
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:39,567
Nice picture of you.

1555
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:42,161
"Squalid side of Raymond's Soho."

1556
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:43,487
I am sorry, Paul.

1557
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:44,913
Good morning.

1558
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:46,991
How does it feel to be exposed
as a common pimp?

1559
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:50,874
Well, I'm going to go to court,
and I will swear on a stack of Bibles

1560
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:54,966
that these allegations bear no relation
to the way I conduct my business

1561
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,758
in any shape or form.

1562
01:19:57,001 --> 01:20:01,131
Not only do they ruin the reputation
of one of London's finest districts,

1563
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,386
but they also bring down
property prices,

1564
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,555
which I'm sure you'll understand
that I do not want.

1565
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:08,846
Club looks good.

1566
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,356
-(Tony) Mmm.
- Mmm.

1567
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,267
- No, thanks.
-(Paul on film) Repeat the conclusion...

1568
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,351
This is quality.

1569
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:15,903
(inhaling deeply)

1570
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,855
...imagine that my face is the camera

1571
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:22,486
and I would like you to splay your legs
before the camera, my face.

1572
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:23,652
(clears throat)

1573
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,373
Superb.

1574
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,041
(laughing)

1575
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,877
- Is that funny?
-(Tony) It's hilarious.

1576
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:33,871
I'd love to see that girl's pussy

1577
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,080
but there's an old man's head
in the way.

1578
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,292
-(Paul on film) That was excellent.
- I love the gestures.

1579
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:40,294
- They make you look like an air hostess.
- Funny-looking air hostess.

1580
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,966
"Doors to manual."

1581
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,594
(Tony) That's your new bird, Di, is it?

1582
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:45,845
- Yes.
-(Tony) All right.

1583
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,227
- Yeah, she's hot.
- Thank you.

1584
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:50,596
I'd fuck her.

1585
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:53,398
Tony, please.

1586
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:54,896
Let me know when you've
finished with her, eh?

1587
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:56,477
Right, stop the... stop the film.

1588
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,607
Switch it off.

1589
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:02,650
How many grams are you
getting through a day?

1590
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,197
Why?

1591
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,404
Because you've got to stop.
You're out of control.

1592
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,956
(laughs) Bollocks.
I do about half as much as you do.

1593
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,041
(Paul) We both know that's rubbish.

1594
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:15,292
And even if it were true,
I don't turn up for work two days late.

1595
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,588
I don't insult the staff.

1596
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:20,167
Listen to me. I don't insult the staff.
I don't upset advertisers.

1597
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,504
And I certainly don't lose 10%
of US sales of Club International.

1598
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:26,716
And I don't have a boss
because I am the boss.

1599
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,018
Yeah, I like you, Tony,
but you've got to clean up your act.

1600
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,813
- And I'm telling you for your own good.
- Who's gonna take over the magazines?

1601
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:35,186
- Deborah.
- No. (laughs)

1602
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:39,027
No. No! Because she...
she's a psycho-woman.

1603
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,229
- You can't have a...
- Whoa. Tony.

1604
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,939
- That's enough.
- No. She's up and down like a yoyo.

1605
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:45,447
- She does twice as much coke as I do.
-(Carl) No, she doesn't.

1606
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:46,994
- Yes, she does. She's...
- Tony...

1607
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:49,660
No-one can stand her. She's talentless.

1608
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:52,082
If you weren't bankrolling her
she'd be nowhere. I'm sorry.

1609
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,830
(Carl) Zip it! Enough.

1610
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,126
I'm sorry, Paul,
I know she's your daughter

1611
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,375
but she is nothing like you. Nothing.

1612
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:59,206
And she's nowhere near me.

1613
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,381
- Carl?
-(Carl) Yes, Paul?

1614
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:01,709
Sack him.

1615
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,553
- Wha... No, come on.
- Tony...

1616
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:13,058
Before long, I think she will
take over the empire that I've built up.

1617
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:15,351
But I wouldn't have said that once.

1618
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:18,401
She was very badly behaved

1619
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,898
and almost impossible to control.

1620
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:24,858
But now I think she's found
the right balance between work and play.

1621
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,493
(Debbie) A lot of people still view him

1622
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:30,947
as very hard-edged and quite
a ruthless businessman, you know.

1623
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:35,042
<i>But, um..- Yeah, I mean, I don't
see him that way. I'm his daughter.</i>

1624
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:39,338
So, as far as I'm concerned,
he's my father and that's that, yeah.

1625
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,008
(Paul) Now that Debbie has a child,
I think she'll be a great mother

1626
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:47,714
and I do hope that her child brings her
as much pleasure as she has brought me.

1627
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,803
(screaming)

1628
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,763
(midwife) All right.
Okay, just take the gas and air,

1629
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:53,844
take the gas and air.
Good girl. Good girl.

1630
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:55,099
Breathe it in.

1631
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,894
In through your nose
and out through your mouth.

1632
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,358
Can I have more pethidine?

1633
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:01,401
(midwife)
I can't give you any more just yet.

1634
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:04,151
(groans) I'm really drug-tolerant.
I need it, please.

1635
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:05,815
-(midwife) I'm sorry, love.
- Please.

1636
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:07,366
Can you... Can you get the doctor?

1637
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:10,115
- He's on the ward.
- No, can you get the doctor, please!

1638
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,787
(Debbie groaning)

1639
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:16,075
All right, love, you're doing
really well. You're doing great.

1640
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,956
No, can you do me a line?
Please, can I have a line?

1641
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:19,958
- I really need it.
- I can't do that.

1642
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:22,711
- It's a hospital.
-(sobs) No, please, I really need it.

1643
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:25,459
(Paul) I'll do you a very,
very, very small one.

1644
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,051
(inhaling)

1645
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,354
Hey, aren't you? Yes, you are.

1646
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,102
(Carl) A-ha! There he is!

1647
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:46,356
(laughs) The grandfather of Soho!

1648
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,781
(all cheering)

1649
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,574
(Carl) All hail the King!

1650
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,703
Champagne for everyone.

1651
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:54,780
(all cheering)

1652
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,577
House champagne.

1653
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:57,874
(laughter)

1654
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:03,672
I'd like to propose a toast, please,
to my new grand-daughter Fawn.

1655
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,879
(all) To Fawn.
(woman) Cheers.

1656
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:08,837
- And, of course, my darling Deborah.
-(woman) And darling Deborah.

1657
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,515
- Evening, Mr Raymond.
-(Paul) Good evening.

1658
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:19,020
Evening, Michelle.

1659
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:20,681
The hair never moves!

1660
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:22,983
No matter what Thatcher does!
And we're all watching!

1661
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,685
Just locked, locked!

1662
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:26,645
- Glued into position!
-(laughter)

1663
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:29,402
She could have gone to Brixton
at the heart of the riots.

1664
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,950
Paving stones would have bounced off it.

1665
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:33,902
The cops could have held her
as a battering ram.

1666
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:36,372
The most insane head of hair. Oi!

1667
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,828
Speaking of insane heads of hair,

1668
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,409
it's our landlord, Paul Raymond.

1669
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,415
Paul, how are you?
Good to have you here.

1670
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:43,537
Who are you out with tonight, Paul?

1671
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,746
Is that one of your dancers
or your daughter?

1672
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,005
Daughter!

1673
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:49,092
It doesn't matter, either way she's
gonna end the night being wanked over.

1674
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:50,715
(audience laughs)

1675
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:51,928
What did he just say?

1676
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:56,259
He owns all of this because
he's a genius at turning that into that.

1677
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:57,934
(audience laughs)

1678
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:00,809
Very clever man. Built on spunk.

1679
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:05,150
He is a fantastic father to me.

1680
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,648
Um, he's my best friend, really.

1681
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:13,363
I've kind of called him up
over the years with problems

1682
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:15,577
at 4:00 in the morning
in ﬂoods of tears

1683
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:18,451
and he's, um,
he's always been there to listen

1684
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,498
and pick up the pieces.

1685
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:23,703
And he still does that now. (laughs)

1686
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:34,972
Can you see what I'm doing, Pa?

1687
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:39,014
(Paul) Just joining lots of lines
of coke up in a big circle.

1688
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,309
(Debbie) No, I'm not.

1689
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,016
I'm making a big

1690
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,806
It's not a "C" for "coke", Pa.

1691
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,396
(inhaling)

1692
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:51,776
Um...

1693
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:55,488
I'm making a "C" for "cancer".

1694
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,703
What are you talking about?

1695
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:03,450
Er...

1696
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,120
I've got breast cancer.

1697
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,917
(Debbie sobbing)

1698
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:22,019
-(Paul) It's gonna be all right.
-(sobbing) What am I gonna do?

1699
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:23,596
(Paul) It's okay.

1700
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:24,805
What am I gonna do?

1701
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:27,767
(Paul) Okay, we'll get treatment.

1702
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:31,233
We'll get some treatment.
It's gonna be all right.

1703
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:32,904
(sobbing)

1704
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:51,006
Would you describe him
as a good father?

1705
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,003
Yeah. He's a fantastic father.

1706
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:56,715
I don't really know
of too many other people

1707
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:59,719
who have a relationship
like the one that we do.

1708
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,596
I think it's quite rare, yeah.

1709
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:06,222
Okay, I think that's
a good place to finish.

1710
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,690
- Thank you. Happy?
-(recordist) Yes, mate, sure thing.

1711
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:10,312
Can you get Debbie's mic off, please?

1712
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,269
Thanks very much, Paul.
Thanks for having us.

1713
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:13,353
Thank you. Thank you kindly, yes.

1714
01:27:13,437 --> 01:27:14,905
Sorry for interrupting your morning.

1715
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,948
No, no, it's very illuminating.

1716
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:18,570
(chuckling)

1717
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,574
Can you tell these are fake
on the camera?

1718
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,496
Thank you.
I wasn't looking too closely.

1719
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:24,573
(laughter)

1720
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:28,870
They used to be much, much smaller.
I had to get them chopped off.

1721
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:32,673
I got the Big C,
and it's kind of ironic, really,

1722
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:35,217
the business I work in,
'cause the other ones were too small.

1723
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:37,920
- Weren't they, the other tits?
- Well, no, they were fine.

1724
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:39,471
Feel, it's really weird.
They don't feel like...

1725
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,556
Leave the poor man alone, darling.

1726
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:42,632
-(chuckles)
- Sorry.

1727
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,093
Next time, maybe.

1728
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:45,810
(laughs) Next time.

1729
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,896
I thought I was...
I thought I was very fair.

1730
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:50,975
You were. I was nice about you, too,
so we're even.

1731
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,943
Well, I don't know,
I think I was more nice about you.

1732
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:55,946
- Goodnight, Lydia.
-(Lydia) Night, Mr Raymond.

1733
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,357
You want to get dinner or something?

1734
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,943
No, I think I'm just gonna go
and meet some friends

1735
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,614
and go and get dinner out.

1736
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:04,079
Give you a lift?

1737
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:07,249
- No, I'm good. Thank you. Bye.
- Okay. All right, my love.

1738
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:08,834
That was very good.
That was very good.

1739
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:11,662
- Well done. Bye, darling.
- Thank you, Pa. Love you. Bye.

1740
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:14,915
Hello, Charles.

1741
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,933
(inhaling deeply)

1742
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,127
(Ainsley) Debbie arrived at my ﬂat.

1743
01:28:56,206 --> 01:29:00,052
She drank some vodka,
and she snorted some cocaine.

1744
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,713
She then said
she wanted to try some heroin.

1745
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:06,300
I'd never seen her do heroin
before that night.

1746
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:11,396
She snorted some heroin
and sat on the bed.

1747
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:16,436
When I woke up, I tried to wake her
but she wouldn't wake up.

1748
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:18,941
I thought she was joking.

1749
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:23,697
I tried to wake her by putting her under
the shower but she wouldn't wake up.

1750
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:31,079
I took her back to the bed and
gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

1751
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,252
And then I called Mr Raymond.

1752
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,043
(Ainsley over phone) Hello. Mr Raymond?

1753
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:39,879
-(Paul) Yes. Who's this?
- Look, I'm a friend of Debbie's.

1754
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:41,426
You need to come.

1755
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:43,924
- Why, what's happened?
- She's here at my ﬂat.

1756
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:46,765
J1 Anyone who ever loved

1757
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,893
J1 Could look at me

1758
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:53,518
J1 And know that I love you

1759
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:57,225
J1 Anyone who ever dreamed

1760
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,561
J1 Could look at me

1761
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:04,404
J1 And know I dream of you...

1762
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:05,825
(Paul) Hello?

1763
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,033
Hello. Are you Ainsley?

1764
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,907
Yeah, yeah. I'm so sorry.

1765
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:16,745
J1 Anyone who had a heart
would take me in his arms

1766
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:19,251
J1 And love me, too

1767
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:20,423
(sobs)

1768
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:23,047
J1 You couldn't really have a heart

1769
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:24,969
J1 That hurt me like you hurt me

1770
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:29,512
J1 And be so untrue

1771
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:30,843
J1 What am I to do?

1772
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,348
(sobbing) Debbie...

1773
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:34,471
J1 Every time you go away

1774
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,015
"Where, O death, is your victory?

1775
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:39,693
"Where, O death, is your sting?"

1776
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:42,984
For as much as it has
pleased Almighty God

1777
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:45,740
to take to himself the soul
of our beloved Debbie,

1778
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:49,486
we bear her body hence
to the place prepared for it.

1779
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:51,579
That ashes may return to ashes

1780
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:53,453
and dust to dust.

1781
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:57,286
(Edwyn) Who gives this woman
in marriage to this man?

1782
01:30:57,911 --> 01:30:59,037
I do.

1783
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:02,586
This is the first time
I've ever given anything away

1784
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,544
and it's the thing
that is most precious to me.

1785
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,470
J1 Love me, too

1786
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:10,219
J1 You couldn't really have a heart

1787
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,893
J1 That hurt me like you hurt me

1788
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:16,392
J1 And be so untrue

1789
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:19,607
J1 What am I to do?

1790
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:45,380
J1 Knowing I love you so

1791
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:50,506
J1 Anyone who had a heart...

1792
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,514
-(Paul) Hello, Jean.
- Hello.

1793
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:58,054
- Hello.
- Hello.

1794
01:31:58,138 --> 01:31:59,731
- Do you remember me?
- Yes.

1795
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:01,604
Yeah? You've got big.

1796
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:05,236
- Oh, is that your baby sister?
- Yeah.

1797
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:08,573
Oh, yes, this is India.
This is her father, John.

1798
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,321
-(lndia coos)
- Hello.

1799
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,868
Hi, gorgeous.

1800
01:32:14,904 --> 01:32:17,157
Well, don't spoil them
like you did Debbie.

1801
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:23,501
Nice to see you, Jean.

1802
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:26,174
You know, all she ever wanted
was to impress you.

1803
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:27,626
To be strong like you.

1804
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:29,757
To get everything she wanted,
just like you.

1805
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,013
But she never was you.

1806
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:34,804
(stutters) This is not the right time.

1807
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,301
No.

1808
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:38,520
Never is with you.

1809
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,305
Goodbye, Jean.

1810
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:01,956
(Paul) Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1811
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:06,331
I'll take Fawn.
I'll see you later on, all right?

1812
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,590
-31?
-(Paul) Yes.

1813
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,387
-(Fawn) 32?
- Yes.

1814
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,928
-36?
- Yes.

1815
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:18,889
Why do you buy
so many houses, Grandpa?

1816
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:20,390
They're not houses,

1817
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:24,191
they're offices, shops,
cafes, restaurants, clubs.

1818
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:26,063
But why so many?

1819
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:28,444
I bought them for your mummy.

1820
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:30,739
For your mummy and you,
and your little sister.

1821
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:33,992
- I don't want them.
- Why not?

1822
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,486
I want my mummy.

1823
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:41,875
I know. I know.

1824
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,456
Now, this...

1825
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:46,170
this is my favourite.

1826
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,498
- Do you own it?
- Yes, I do.

1827
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:49,958
Do you fancy a cake?

1828
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,177
- Yes, please, Grandpa.
- Right.

1829
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:54,345
Charles, will you take Fawn inside?

1830
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:01,724
(Debbie singing)
J1 The look of love

1831
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:07,147
J1 Is in your eyes

1832
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:10,611
J1 The look your heart

1833
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,399
J1 Can't disguise

1834
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:16,652
Can I have the berry cheesecake,

1835
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:19,161
the strawberry mountain,

1836
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:21,740
the cake with the almonds around it

1837
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:24,209
and the marzipan figs?

1838
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:26,374
I like this shop. Do you own it?

1839
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:29,005
No. No, not yet.

1840
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:32,258
Ah! So, what did you get?

1841
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:33,422
Chocolate éclair.

1842
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:36,216
- Thank you, Grandpa.
