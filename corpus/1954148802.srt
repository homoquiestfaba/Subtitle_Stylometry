Caught a loop there.

17
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,996
Go lateral and fix.

18
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,009
We're level.

19
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,845
Right on time with one zero niner,

20
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,388

21
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,182
All right, heat her up.

22
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,229
I'm burning!

23
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,066
T.A.D. At eleven seconds

24
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,526

Holy shit!

36
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,842
What a waste.

37
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,888
Fire alert. Observation one.

38
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,264
Send in the boys.

39
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,767
And have them send up a shitload
of window cleaner.

40
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,146
Cyborg stew.

41
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,953
Glycerine 3
acidosulphide-dioxogine.

42
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,704
"Glass Shadow" for short.

43
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,250
Injected into the cyborg's
circulatory system

44
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,294
and directly linked
to a micro-beam detonater.

45
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,797
Virtually undetectable

46
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,174
in human form.

47
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,427
Aggressively affective.

48
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,971
The cutting edge
of counter-espionage

00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,556
technology in a humanoid

50
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,890
robotics application.

51
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,101
And while our major competitor
Kobayashi

52
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,646
has tried similar designs,
only Pinwheel

53
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,858
has been able to overcome
the chemical rejection

54
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,442
of a bio-explosive

55
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,694
implant.

56
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,697
Dreena, the cyborg test unit
you just saw,

57
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,784
was injected with a mere
20 milligrams of Glass Shadow.

58
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,746
The Osaka operative will be
carrying over 100,000.

59
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,623
Has she been selected?

60
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,334
Her name is Casella Reese.

61
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,837
The trainers call her Cash.

62
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,423
Peak condition. Top of the line.
Our very best.

63
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,717
What has she got?

64
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,596
A hyper-sophisticated
psycho-emotional program designed

65
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,973
specifically for her.

66
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,475
Human in almost every respect.

67
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,561
Love, hate,

68
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,648
anxiety, anger, sexuality,

69
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,026
and most importantly,
fear.

70
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,696
Are you telling me every time she
screws somebody she'll explode?

71
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,990
I wish my ex-wife
had that problem.

72
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,870
The sexual demonstration
was chosen as the most

73
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,872
entertaining way

74
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,123
of showing the board

75
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,292
the infinite possibilities

76
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,877
of the Glass Shadow.

77
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,046
With Kobayashi Corporation
folding,

78
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,090
Pinwheel will monopolize
the bio-tech world.

79
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,844
Two years from now they'll say:
"If God didn't make you,

80
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,513
Pinwheel did".

81
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,264
We'll own this planet.

82
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,940
Casella Reese, you've got
a great future

83
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,608
behind you.

84
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,176
Dropping your left, Cash?

85
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,804
You think so, Colt?

86
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,552
Class dismissed.

87
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,472
Where's Dreena?

88
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,475
Who?

89
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,603
Dreena, my roommate. They took
her away. What happened to her?

90
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,065
How should I know?

91
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,548
<i>Can't take my eye off you.</i></i>

92
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,693
-Whas going on?
-Nothing that concerns you.

93
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,612
Whas she done?

94
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,489
Nothing that concerns you.

95
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,366
Come here.

96
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,537
Look, Ricks.
Don't start any shit with me.

97
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,289
You're already on thin ice.

98
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,047
Asshole.

99
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,760
Mind your own business
or you'll never get out of here.

100
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,150
You're going to be semi-operative
for a couple of hours.

101
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,153
Nothing to worry about.
Just try and relax.

102

<i>Interrupt Pinwheel feed.</i></i>

103
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,786
<i>Enough synthetic homework</i>

104
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,663
<i>Time to get real.</i></i>

105
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,374
<i>There's a few things</i>
you should know</i></i>

106
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,001
<i>if you decide to go.</i></i>

107
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,129
<i>Other cyborgs have tried it</i></i>

108
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,381
<i>and failed.</i></i>

109
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:18,715
<i>Only one</i></i>

110
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,384
<i>made it all the way,</i></i>

111
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,886
<i>but she had a protector.</i></i>

112
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,097
<i>A human.</i></i>

113
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,808
<i>A warrior.</i></i>

114
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,727
<i>A hero.</i></i>

115
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,522
<i>If you really</i></i>

116
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,315
<i>want to make it,</i></i>

117
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,693
<i>find yourself a hero.</i></i>

118
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,489
<i>-Do you know any heroes?</i>
-No.</i>

119
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,243
<i>-Would you like a suggestion?</i>
-Yes.</i>

120
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,416
-Did they hurt you?
-Probably.

121
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,170
You know the rules,
no fraternizing with cyborgs.

122
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,218
<i>Whaùs happening?</i></i>

123
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:46,637
<i>Yeah.</i></i>

124

<i>"Colt 45".</i>
Mano a mano.</i></i>

127
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:57,773
This a joke?

128
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,195
<i>Guess not.</i></i>

129
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,571
Holy Christ.

130
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,074
<i>"Dominus vobiscum et</i></i>

<i>I am the word of God almighty!</i></i>

00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,383
<i>Yeah, no pleasing some.</i></i>

136
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,594
<i>So what did she give you?</i>
A "billet-Ôamour"?</i></i>

137
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,013
No, a matchbox.

138
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,724
<i>Oh, the flame of love.</i></i>

139
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,938
Nobody told me about you.

140

I'll get back to you on that.

00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,912
<i>I can throw a monkey</i>
in anybody's wrench.</i></i>

184
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,331
<i>Right, Cash?</i></i>

185
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,668
-You've seen him before?
-He talks to me at night.

186
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,796
What was that?

187
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:16,550
<i>The plot thickens.</i></i>

188
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,510
<i>Go ahead.</i></i>

189
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,929
<i>I'll keep an eye on you.</i></i>

190
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:56,798
Dreena?

191
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:04,515
Guess what?

192
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:05,974
What?

193
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,935
They put the chill on me, Cash.

194
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:10,437
Why?

195
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,856
They didn't discuss it with me.

196
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,193
Are they going to fix you?

197
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,153
They already did.

198
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,698
Better kiss it good bye, Cash.
You're next.

199
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,786
Next for what?

200
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:29,414
<i>-Glass Shadow.</i>
-Glass Shadow?</i>

201
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,960
<i>Liquid explosive.</i>
Highly effective.</i></i>

202
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,671
<i>Iùs circulating in your body</i>
at this moment, Cash.</i></i>

203
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,132
Why? Why me?

204
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,052
<i>Corporate counter-espionage units.</i></i>

205
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,555
<i>You were made to be destroyed.</i></i>

206
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,014
When?

207
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,934
<i>Osaka, two days from now.</i></i>

208
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,937
<i>Dunn has arranged for you to attend</i>
a corporate meeting at the Kobayashi</i></i>

209
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,899
<i>robotics plant posing as</i>
an American investor.</i></i>

210
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,610
<i>At a pre-programmed point</i></i>

211
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,904
<i>you will self-detonate</i>
thus liquidating</i></i>

212
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:03,115
<i>the company's entire</i>
chain of command.</i></i>

213
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,826
<i>-For what reason?
-In the ensuing crisis,</i></i>

214
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:09,580
<i>stock value will plummet,</i>
leaving Kobayashi vulnerable</i></i>

215
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,665
<i>to an immediate takeover</i>
by the chief rival</i>.</i>

216
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,333
Pinwheel!

217
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,044
<i>Business as usual.</i></i>

218
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,338
<i>Time to make hard choices.</i></i>

219
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,841
<i>You have five seconds.</i></i>

220
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,718
Five seconds?

221
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,887
<i>Three... two...</i></i>

222
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:27,598
<i>one... bingo!</i></i>

223
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:32,102
<i>You've just been reported stolen,</i>
Cash.</i></i>

224
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:35,856
<i>And guess who they claim</i>
the thief is?</i></i>

225
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,233
<i>You, handsome.</i></i>

226
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,319
What do we do now?

227
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,987
<i>Run like hell.</i></i>

228
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:46,575
<i>Security breach. Sector three.</i></i>

229
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,805
-You know where we're going?
-A freight elevator on level 6.

230
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:19,650
<i>Hold your fire!</i></i>

231
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:23,195
<i>-Don't damage the cyborg.</i>
-What about don't damage the human?</i>

232
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:00,941
Come on! This way!

233
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,861
This should be it.

234
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,195
Yeah!

235
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,360
I got a bad feeling about this.

236
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:49,198
Humans. Always struggling
with their feelings.

237
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,790
Unfortunately, your feeling
is right this time.

238
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:13,096
Not bad. Mine's not as sweet.

239
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,474
Thaùs funny.

240
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:19,019
Bring up a schematic on this area
and leùs get out of here, okay?

241
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,152
We can get out to the bottom.

242
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,571
Under the floorboard
there's another hatch.

243
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:48,757
But watch out for
the half a mile drop.

244
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,016
Swing me!

245
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,091
-What a stench!
-I just shut my smell sensors off.

246
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,729
Okay, now whaùs next?

247
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:28,440
We wait for our ride up.

248
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,571
You're kidding me, right?

249
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,199
We're going to hitchhike a ride
on a trash container from hell?

250
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,785
Logic tells us
we have no other choice.

251
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,704
I'll attach us.
You just ride it out.

252
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,790
Yeah, thaùs easy for you to say.

253
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,845
-You all right?
-Like I was dragged through a hole.

254
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:01,598
-Get this thing off me!
-Leùs go.

255
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:26,707
I've got to quit smoking.

256
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,098
-You know the city?
-Haven't been topside for a while.

257
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:46,018
About 8 years, I think.

258
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:50,689
-What are you doing?
-A little interface.

259
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,947
<i>Not bad for a first time break.</i></i>

260
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,450
How do you do that?

261
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,619
<i>Black magic.</i></i>

262
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,747
<i>Now I have to make you disappear.</i></i>

263
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:10,417
All right, you better do it quick,
because I'm a felon now, okay?

264
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,128
Grand theft robot.

265
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:16,548
I don't need to get busted for
possession of an unlicensed cyborg.

266
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,133
Colt!

267
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,801
What?

268
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,972
-Colt!
-What?

269
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,475
What is it?

270
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,854
-What?
-I've been activated.

271
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:33,774
Whaùs going on?

272
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:36,485
<i>I was afraid of this.</i></i>

273
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:40,447
Afraid of what? You better give me
some answers, hotlips! Come on!

274
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:42,950
<i>They wired a recall code</i>
to her tracking system.</i></i>

275
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,118
<i>The detonator self-activates</i></i>

276
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,329
<i>if she gets too far</i>
from the plant.</i></i>

277
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:48,789
<i>They don't want anyone to find out</i></i>

278
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,874
<i>she's carrying the Glass Shadow.</i></i>

279
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,125
Help me!

280
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,671
Iùs okay. Iùs okay.

281
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,465
<i>Stay calm, Cash.</i></i>

282
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,676
<i>The pattern recall voice</i>
will probably switch off</i></i>

283
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,679
<i>any second. Think straight.</i></i>

284
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:05,681
<i>What does the clock read?</i></i>

285
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:09,518
Eight hours fifty-seven and three.

286
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,103
<i>You got time.</i></i>

287
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:12,771
How much time?

288
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,148
<i>About nine hours.</i></i>

289
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:17,860
<i>The signal is just playing hockey</i>
with your feedback control.</i></i>

290
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:21,822
<i>Iùs trying to disorient you so</i>
you can't form an escape strategy.</i></i>

291
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,699
Come here, come here.

292
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,201
You're safe.

293
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,786
You're safe.

294
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:29,872
Iùs cool.

295
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:38,213
<i>Remember, you're throwing out</i>
a hell of a signal.</i></i>

296
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,341
<i>You won't be clear of danger</i>
until you've been defused.</i></i>

297
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,302
Okay, whaùs the plan?

298
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,970
<i>Get some wheels.</i></i>

299
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:47,055
Some wheels?
Hope I remember how to drive.

300
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,057
<i>She can if you can't.</i></i>

301
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,601
No problem.

302
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,060
Yeah, I'll drive.

303
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,062
-No problem.
-I'll drive.

304
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:56,231
<i>Go to 1830 North Perot Street.</i></i>

305
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,484
<i>Iùs in the warehouse district</i>
downtown and wait</i></i>

306
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,196
<i>for Wild Card.</i>
If you miss him,</i></i>

307
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:05,115
<i>head straight for the old city</i>
muzeum in the South Sector.</i></i>

308
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:06,575
<i>I'll find you.</i></i>

309
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,371
Hey, who the hell are you?

310
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,542
<i>Oh, I almost forgot.</i></i>

311
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,545
<i>The name's Mercy.</i></i>

312
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:53,288
Ready when you are, Chen!

313
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,715
You screwed up, letting

314
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:06,009
our princess out of her tower.

315
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,761
Whaùs our plan now, Dunn?

316
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:11,014
She's not the problem.
Iùs the human, Colt.

317
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:12,683
The best laid plan...

318
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:14,768
Just shut up and listen.

319
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,145
Get topside and intercept Cash.

320
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:19,565
Disconnect the Pinwheel detonator
and install one of your own.

321
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:22,484
Make sure iùs undetectable.
After you kill Colt

322
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:24,152
we're back in business.

323
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,029
And what about Pinwheel?

324
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,824
They'll definitely want her back.

325
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,409
Don't worry about Pinwheel.

326
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:33,537
When the time is right
I'll destroy

327
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:37,291
Cash, Pinwheel and Kobayashi
all at the same time.

328
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,793
Remind me never to piss you off.

329
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,547
Who says you haven't already?

330
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:51,555
Sending Pinwheel Security to
locate her is out of the question.

331
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:52,806
Why?

332
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:56,685
Our tracking system will alert
the hackers and tappers topside

333
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:59,605
and they'll tear her to pieces
just for the parts.

334
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:03,650
That sort of garage sale
must be avoided at all costs.

335
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:06,278
She won't respond to
the activation warning?

336
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:08,864
After the 40 minute point there,
the odds decrease

337
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:11,074
some eleven percent on the hour.

338
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:13,869
Apparently, whatever emotion
drove her to escape

339
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:17,331
may override her sense
of self-preservation.

340
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,334
You mean she'd rather
self-destruct than surrender?

341
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:23,587
Check. The boys in
programming call it

342
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:26,590
a "freedom-cathexis aberration".

343
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:28,383
Put simply,

344
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:32,346
she's the first cyborg
to escape by human reasoning.

345
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,515
So, iùs escape or bust.

346
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:38,268
Now we're still speculating on the
motives of the combat instructor.

347
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:41,188
-Corporate spying?
-Possibly.

348
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:45,067
They appear to have had outside
help. Could be Kobayashi.

349
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:48,821
-Whaùs your plan, Dunn?
-This uniùs training program

350
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,406
was under your own
personal supervision.

351
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,535
If she's apprehended and analyzed,

352
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:58,205
the entire Glass Shadow Project
is dead.

353
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:00,582
And Pinwheel bites the big one.

354
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:04,878
The normal tracking patterns
of escapee traffic

355
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,755
will not apply in this scenario.

356
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:09,758
No. Not with a major
corporate accomplice.

357
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:12,886
Now, my fellows,
I suggest we enlist a man

358
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:14,680
who has experience.

359
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:17,266
Somebody who knows the street.
Somebody who's worked

360
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,059
with irrational prototype models,

361
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:22,062
like the Velma Unit 5 years ago.

362
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,941
Get a psychopath
to find a psychopath.

363
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,861
-You're not suggesting...
-Yes.

364
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:30,946
Yes.

365
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,866
Master Daniel Bench.

366
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:05,439
<i>-Yes?
-Hello, Bench.</i></i>

367
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,901
Yeah, well, well, well, well.

368
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:13,489
Martin Dunn of Pinwheel.

369
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,326
Iùs been a long time.
How may I

370
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,536
assist you?

371
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,622
Are you still active?

372
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,208
<i>Well, if thaùs your</i>
polite little way</i></i>

373
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,127
of inquiring if
I still kill people

374
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:29,338
for a living, the answer is...

375
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,715
<i>oui, oui, sÌ, sÌ,</i>
oh, yes.</i>

376
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,635
I'm still an equal

377
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:37,137
opportunity terminator.

378
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:40,682
<i>I thought you may have slowed down</i>
after the Velma incident.</i></i>

379
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,187
Temporary setback.

380
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:48,315
You call five years "temporary"?

381
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:53,403
Oh, yeah.

382
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:57,783
The face is nicely on the mend now.

383
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,662
Trifle expensive, though.

384
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,747
But we can afford it.

385
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,750
An emergency has come up.
We're in need of service.

386
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:09,586
To the tune of?

387
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:12,172
Three hundred and fifty thousand

388
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:14,049
for nine hours.

389
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,969
Plus an additional ten percent
if the product is delivered

390
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,637
<i>intact.</i></i>

391
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:21,557
<i>-Thirty percent.
-Twenty.</i></i>

392
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,601
Come on, Dunn. Twenty five.

393
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:26,687
Surgical costs are absurd

394
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:28,146
<i>these days.</i></i>

395
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,192
Affirmative.

396
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:36,780
We have a Spec A, LC 7
female cyborg.

397
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,616
<i>Standard anatronic</i>
espionage model.</i></i>

398
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:43,162
<i>Plus one human. Male, 30 years.</i></i>

399
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,621
Employee?

400
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:47,833
<i>Instructor.</i>
Hand to hand, small arms.</i></i>

401
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:50,878
I don't know, Dunn.

402
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:53,589
You sound kind of nervous to me.

403
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,340
She wouldn't happen

404
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:58,177
<i>to be an experimental model,</i>
would she?</i></i>

405
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:01,180
Thaùs classified.
Do you want the job, or not?

406
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:04,016
<i>Well, times being what they are...</i></i>

407
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,602
I thought so.

408
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,855
<i>The product is wired with</i>
a 200 mile tap.</i></i>

409
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:11,523
<i>We can vid-fax their pictures</i></i>

410
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,609
and set up a relay right now.

411
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,320
Proceed.

412
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,066
I think iùd be better
if I go alone.

413
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,985
The hackers will be looking
for a couple, not a single.

414
00:37:57,486 --> 00:38:00,823
If I'm not back in 30 minutes, meet
me in the muzeum in South Sector.

415
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,074
Okay.

416
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,118
I'm going to wait across the street
in that alley, okay?

417
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,335
Don't get dead.

418
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:11,852
-I'm looking for Wild Card.
-Just follow me.

419
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,023
You wait here.

420
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,198
<i>Over here, killer.</i></i>

421
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:52,786
<i>No doubt about it.</i></i>

422
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,497
<i>That window will never</i>
mess with you again.</i></i>

423
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,126
<i>-Nervous reflex, man.
-I forgot you're</i></i>

424
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,753
<i>strung pretty tight.</i></i>

425
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:05,299
<i>-Too many drugs.</i>
-Probably.</i>

426
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:07,259
Whaùs next?

427
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:08,427
<i>Hook up with Cash</i></i>

428
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,512
<i>and wait for your contact.</i></i>

429
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,184
<i>-Okay. How will I know him?
-He'll know you.</i></i>

430
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:18,103
<i>Smart as a whip.</i>
And remember:</i></i>

431
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:21,148
<i>Somebody somewhere</i>
is dogging Cash's beacon.</i></i>

432
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:24,067
<i>In fact you've probably got</i>
a wire-tapper</i></i>

433
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:25,402
<i>on your tail right now.</i></i>

434
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:27,404
Wire-tapper?

435
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:29,573
<i>Professional cyborg tracker.</i></i>

436
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,575
<i>Keeps the escape classified.</i></i>

437
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:33,327
<i>They're well-paid</i></i>

438
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:37,080
<i>and I never met one who wasn't</i>
a borderline psychopath.</i></i>

439
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:42,419
<i>-What are my chances?
-Hell, kid.</i></i>

440
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,130
<i>I'm amazed you're still breathing.</i></i>

441
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:49,718
You're a sweetie.

442
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:49,778
Where you learn speak Chinese?

443
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:52,156
I was trained.

444
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:56,535
Trained for what?

445
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,957
What you want to know?

446
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,504
-How much time do I have?
-You got friend?

447
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,173
Yes.

448
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:11,341
He's waiting for me.

449
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,803
A sharp field.

450
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:16,763
Very strong charge.

451
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:18,640
How you got such strong energy?

452
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:25,105
You need money?

453
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:26,899
Money?

454
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:28,150
I got job for you.

455
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,570
Good work for cyborg.

456
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:34,072
Top dollar.

457
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:25,916
Hey, buddy. Got a light?

458
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,223
This is a very big gun.

459
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,645
It makes very big holes.

460
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:48,939
I get the point.

461
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:51,650
Put these on.

462
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:56,446
Behind you.

463
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:05,330
Your pretty little mate.
Where is she, inside?

464
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:08,125
She's gone, man.

465
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:12,212
I didn't realize
you were so tired of living.

466
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,923
What the fuck? Don't!

467
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:17,634
Don't kill me, man.

468
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:22,931
Whaùs the magic word?

469
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:26,810
-Please.
-Please.

470
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:29,104
Please, please what?

471
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,024
Please don't kill me.

472
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:40,991
Oh, I do like a boy with manners.

473
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:48,290
You beckon the doorman
and you keep your hole shut.

474
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:54,546
-Your girlfrienÔs close, isn't she?
-You got me.

475
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:58,091
Can I help you?

476
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,512
Just conducting a little inquest

477
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,180
here in your

478
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:06,934
beautiful, beautiful Kosk parlour.

479
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,810
You're no cop.

480
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,152
Colt?

481
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,155
Colt, you down there?

482
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:04,491
Colt!

483
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:39,711
Have a seat.

484
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:42,422
I'll stand if you don't mind.

485
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:46,593
Please!

486
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:08,282
Okay.

487
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:11,285
Cuff yourself to that bar.

488
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,003
Give it a nice little tug.

489
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:47,070
Cigarette?

490
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:51,450
Yeah.

491
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:56,663
Oh, so sorry.

492
00:49:57,372 --> 00:49:58,832
I don't have any.

493
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:15,307
You're a spook, man.
You know that?

494
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:17,726
You need some
serious fucking therapy.

495
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:21,271
Oh, but iùs so much fun

496
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:22,731
to watch, isn't it?

497
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:25,859
I guess so.

498
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:27,820
I have

499
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,365
unusually sensitive skin.

500
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:36,161
We must guard continually against

501
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,789
infections.

502
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:41,083
They do cause complications.

503
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:45,671
I knew Pinwheel was cutting costs,
but they must be really desperate

504
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:47,214
to bring you in.

505
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,842
Where do you hail from,
Mr. Ricks?

506
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:52,010
New Orleans.

507
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:54,429
Have you ever been to

508
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:59,017
the magical Far East?

509
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,937
No, I haven't had the pleasure.

510
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:05,482
You really should get out more,
Mr. Ricks.

511
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:10,279
Travel really does
broaden the mind.

512
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:14,867
Now...

513
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:18,078
Are you going to tell me

514
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:20,706
where she is?

515
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,085
I told you I have no idea
where she is.

516
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:29,548
Little boy Colten
has lost his mate

517
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:31,967
and doesn't fancy a look.

518
00:51:32,259 --> 00:51:34,261
But, Master Bench

519
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,972
and his bloody henchmen

520
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:41,018
must hang

521
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:42,686
his head

522
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:44,688
on a hook.

523
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:54,156
What the hell is that?

524
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:55,824
Thaùs the third eye.

525
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:59,161
They say to me that
it does help you see

526
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:00,537
far into the future.

527
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:02,414
Shit.

528
00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:05,751
No, no, do not cover it up.
Iùs a

529
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:08,045
liquid crystal base, very

530
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:10,339
very sensitive to the light.

531
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:12,216
You see?

532
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:15,010
Otherwise iùs going
to burn a furrow deep,

533
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:18,472
deep, deep into
your corpus colossus

534
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,475
and then you're going to be in

535
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:24,394
a desperate state.

536
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:29,608
All this fun has just left me

537
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:31,902
limp with excitement.

538
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,155
I believe I'm going to join you

539
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:37,533
in your peaceful slumber.

540
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:42,746
You have pleasant dreams,
Mr. Ricks.

541
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:52,256
<i>I think we're coming around, yes?</i></i>

542
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:59,346
Hello, my name is Tea.

543
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:02,558
Would you like Miss Chen
with your cream?

544
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:06,728
Re-code logical

545
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:08,522
and pattern back.

546
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:09,857
Entry first

547
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,316
subject.

548
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,444
Who... who is you,
greeting me?

549
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:16,446
And I am?

550
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:21,451
-Miss Chen.
-Who has offered you...?

551
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:24,246
Cream...

552
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:26,123
for my tea.

553
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:28,417
And if you don't like cream?

554
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:33,130
I'll take it black, thank you.

555
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:35,424
Well, it doesn't appear
to be any serious

556
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:36,967
damage.

557
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:41,138
Now, VEM replication.
I want optical memory playback.

558
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:46,351
You've been a naughty girl.

559
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:48,437
Iùs in my program.

560
00:53:56,487 --> 00:53:58,864
It appears as if Pinwheel
has planted a bomb in you.

561
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:01,575
Yes. Can you remove it?

562
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:05,037
I don't think it can be removed.

563
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:08,874
Your entire system appears
to be suffused with it.

564
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:10,876
This is the detonator.

565
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:12,336
Iùs still active.

566
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:14,421
Not necessarily.

567
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:19,927
There.

568
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:22,638
The detonation clock
in your field

569
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:25,766
of vision will gradually
run its course to zero

570
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:27,643
and stop.

571
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,188
On the other hand...

572
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:34,942
No!

573
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:36,193
Oh, yes!

574
00:54:38,195 --> 00:54:39,112
Make it stop!

575
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:40,697
Well,

576
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:43,075
whaùs it worth?

577
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:45,577
Anything.
Just make it stop.

578
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:52,584
I know you have a partner.

579
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:56,964
A cyborg.

580
00:54:58,006 --> 00:54:59,967
Tell me where he is,

581
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,261
and I guarantee safe passage out

582
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:03,720
of the country.

583
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:07,057
All right.

584
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:56,935
They say the happiest people

585
00:57:57,227 --> 00:57:59,104
have no memories.

586
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:00,898
None.

587
00:58:11,742 --> 00:58:13,494
You've been contacted
by a tapper.

588
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:16,747
Just stay in the dark
and don't reveal any landmarks.

589
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:19,041
Geography always tips them off.

590
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:25,797
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

591
00:58:27,883 --> 00:58:30,802
I just hope Mercy contacts us soon.

592
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,179
Yeah.

593
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:34,681
Mercy.

594
00:58:40,312 --> 00:58:41,355
Iùs not what you expected,
is it?

595
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:44,358
What?

596
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:46,443
The world.

597
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:48,862
Topside.

598
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,325
I thought it would be beautiful.

599
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:57,079
Yeah, well, it ceased to be
beautiful a long time ago.

600
00:58:58,539 --> 00:58:59,706
People just screwed it up.

601
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:03,126
How could they let it get so bad?

602
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:06,171
Because people
aren't programmed, Cash.

603
00:59:06,463 --> 00:59:09,508
They're not schematics
and they're not circuitry.

604
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,968
They're flesh

605
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:12,219
and blood.

606
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:15,556
They learn by trial and error.

607
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,933
Some errors are worse than others.

608
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:22,646
Some of the trials, too.

609
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,774
Now you're talking about cyborgs.

610
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,319
Man's puny attmept to play God.

611
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,741
A fucked concept, I mean...

612
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:40,164
I hated you all and Pinwheel,

613
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:41,498
you know?

614
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:44,751
I mean when I first started
working there, they had

615
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,462
the staff that acted like Dunn
was Geppetto.

616
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,883
And by the end all we have created
is a bunch of perverted Pinnochios.

617
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:01,435
Until they created you.

618
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:12,905
When I first started

619
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:16,867
having feelings,

620
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:20,913
I mean a genuine attraction to you,
I got really scared.

621
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,749
Because they were playing God
better than ever

622
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:25,834
and I was buying into it.

623
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:30,422
I mean I knew
what kind of treachery

624
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:33,425
Pinwheel was capable of,
and I was more afraid for you

625
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:37,596
than for myself.

626
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,296
-Any regrets?
-No.

627
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:15,467
None.

628
01:01:15,676 --> 01:01:16,802
None.

629
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:20,681
Except one.

630
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:25,477
We're not going to live our lives
together and die together.

631
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:29,231
Today might be that day, punk.

632
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:39,950
I'll be damned

633
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:42,995
if ain't sween Raven Chen.

634
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:46,957
Long time no see, Danny.

635
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:49,459
I heard a cyborg
almost did you in.

636
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,842
Oh, yes.

637
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:01,972
She gave me a run for it,
all right.

638
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:03,849
Seems that

639
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:06,018
our darling little Velma

640
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:07,603
had a fondness

641
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:10,397
for battery acid.

642
01:02:11,648 --> 01:02:14,067
Gave me a full face-splash.

643
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:18,322
The beautiful bitch.

644
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:22,409
The tapping game isn't
what it used to be.

645
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:25,954
Maybe iùs time you checked out.

646
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:43,680
Jesus Christ!

647
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:49,186
Look what you've done!

648
01:02:57,653 --> 01:02:59,613
Look, Cash,
we don't have time for this.

649
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:03,158
We've got to keep moving.

650
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:14,545
Ah, "the nuclear family".

651
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:17,047
An appropriate name.

652
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:19,216
You were right.

653
01:03:19,758 --> 01:03:21,301
He's of very little use to me.

654
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:25,597
Where are you?

655
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:49,997
So tell me, whaùs worse?
Cyborg envy or human envy?

656
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:53,625
Penis envy?

657
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:29,703
I like your style, gorgeous.

658
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:54,645
Hey, puppy. You lost?

659
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:56,313
Who cares?
How much time we have left?

660
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:00,275
Wait a minute, he's synthetic.

661
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:02,653
Mercy must have sent him.

662
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:05,906
Great.

663
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:07,157
" Benji the cyborg".

664
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,829
Leùs follow the dog.

665
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:08,135
This must be it.

666
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,680
Oh, yeah. This sounds like
a wonderful place.

667
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:25,777
Yes, may I help you?

668
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:27,654
Yes, you can let us in.

669
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:29,948
Do you have a reservation?

670
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:36,413
-Mercy sent us.
-I'll check with the management.

671
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:38,290
Excuse me for a moment.

672
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:44,546
Welcome to Towndown.
Your entrance has been approved.

673
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:05,901
Thanks.
We're looking for Mercy.

674
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:09,238
Nobody finds Mercy.
Mercy will find you.

675
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:12,366
Towndown's a shipyard?

676
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:14,993
More like a graveyard.
This is pre-war shit.

677
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:18,330
All obsolete. When enough
fools and freaks moved in,

678
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:20,207
they called it a town.

679
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:23,544
-You need one thing to live here.
-Whaùs that?

680
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:26,463
Basic human survival instinct.

681
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:32,928
The man says to approach.

682
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:35,013
He can see us?

683
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:38,767
In these parts, if you don't see
it coming, iùs probably too late.

684
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:40,519
I wish you luck.

685
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:48,652
Cover it up, boys!

686
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:55,868
So where to, Benji?
Whaùs next?

687
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:36,325
<i>You're late.</i></i>

688
01:08:36,533 --> 01:08:37,576
Yeah, ran into some shit.

689
01:08:37,784 --> 01:08:38,911
<i>And iùs getting thicker.</i></i>

690
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:40,704
What do you mean?

691
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:45,501
<i>The ship I paid my last dollar for</i>
just burned to the ground.</i></i>

692
01:08:46,543 --> 01:08:49,046
<i>I'd say someone</i>
doesn't want you to leave.</i></i>

693
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:51,340
<i>-What other options do we have?
-Only one.</i></i>

694
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:53,509
<i>Rent another boat.</i></i>

695
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:56,637
Great. How are we
supposed to do that?

696
01:08:58,096 --> 01:08:59,473
<i>Ever hear of the Blade?</i></i>

697
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:02,059
-No.
-No.

698
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:04,353
<i>Snuff combat</i></i>

699
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:06,980
<i>under a stern propeller</i>
of a dry-docked ship.</i></i>

700
01:09:07,272 --> 01:09:10,609
<i>Big attraction here.</i>
Two go under, one comes out.</i></i>

701
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:12,903
<i>Fast, brutal</i></i>

702
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:15,614
<i>and highly illegal.</i></i>

703
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:16,990
<i>And you're a contender.</i></i>

704
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:18,742
Forget it!

705
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:22,287
I'm not putting my ass through a
blender so you can place some bets!

706
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:25,541
<i>Easy, Colt 45.</i></i>

707
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:29,503
<i>Remember the difference between</i>
champ and chump is U.</i></i>

708
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:32,214
<i>The Blade's your ticket</i></i>

709
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:33,674
<i>to the Mombasa shuffle.</i></i>

710
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,010
<i>-The ticket to where?
-Mombasa.</i></i>

711
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:39,805
<i>The only free-zone on earth</i>
for unlicensed cyborgs.</i></i>

712
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:41,390
<i>The purse will rent you</i></i>

713
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:44,726
<i>a black market boat for the trip.</i>
And it leaves tonight.</i></i>

714
01:09:45,144 --> 01:09:46,687
<i>With you...</i></i>

715
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:47,855
<i>or without you.</i></i>

716
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:53,694
Hey, Marty, my love.

717
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:57,239
Four hours and counting, Bench.
Where in hell are you?

718
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:01,702
I'm due west riding right by
a beautiful magical harbor view.

719
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:03,287
Towndown.

720
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:06,206
Not unlike our late
lovely Velma, huh?

721
01:10:07,457 --> 01:10:10,460
The harbor zone has a well developed
criminal network.

722
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:13,172
However the similarity
is circumstantial at best.

723
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:17,342
Yeah, well, silly me. I just have
a little trouble believing that.

724
01:10:17,551 --> 01:10:20,053
So you listen to me.
I'm going to outline

725
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:22,973
our new terms of agreement.

726
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:26,435
Total termination for a 50 percent

727
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:28,187
increase in fees.

728
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:30,063
Out of the question.

729
01:10:31,106 --> 01:10:32,774
The woman is too valuable

730
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:35,277
and the man is a matter
of internal security.

731
01:10:35,486 --> 01:10:36,320
<i>I just bet he is.</i></i>

732
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:40,199
But Marty, you're just
missing the point there.

733
01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:43,619
Because retrieval is no longer

734
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:46,330
<i>an acceptable option.</i></i>

735
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:49,249
Are you threatening me, Bench?

736
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,709
<i>Threaten?</i></i>

737
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:54,171
What a quaint, quaint, quaint word.
I've been mutilated.

738
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:56,048
Five painful years

739
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:59,259
<i>of dermo-therapy ruined</i></i>

740
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:00,928
<i>by a little shit-kicker</i></i>

741
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:03,972
and a stupid little piece
of wind-up muff!

742
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:11,355
You're off the case, Bench.

743
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:14,191
You touch them,
we'll have your license.

744
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:15,859
<i>Oh, I love it.</i></i>

745
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:19,071
What license?

746
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:23,033
I love it, I love it.

747
01:11:23,242 --> 01:11:27,120
<i>I love it, I love it, I love it!</i></i>

748
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:30,666
I love it!

749
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:38,382
So, why do they call you
Wild Card?

750
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:40,759
Iùs a long story

751
01:11:41,802 --> 01:11:43,679
and you're not going
to be awake for it.

752
01:11:52,563 --> 01:11:54,314
<i>You got a thing happening, huh?</i></i>

753
01:11:55,774 --> 01:11:58,902
<i>Yeah, cyborg love.</i>
Just like</i></i>

754
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:01,405
<i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>
have to cross</i></i>

755
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:04,324
<i>all those lines to connect.</i></i>

756
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:07,995
<i>-Kind of a doomed thing.</i>
-Doomed?</i>

757
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:12,583
<i>Yeah, like it cannot last</i>
even if this love is true.</i></i>

758
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:14,877
<i>Only</i></i>

759
01:12:15,169 --> 01:12:17,171
<i>one way it can live on.</i></i>

760
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:19,756
How?

761
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:24,261
<i>Someone's got to cross over and</i>
live the time of their beloved.</i></i>

762
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:26,346
<i>Time</i></i>

763
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:28,640
<i>is what iùs all about.</i></i>

764
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:31,226
<i>Cash will live for</i>
a thousand years,</i></i>

765
01:12:31,435 --> 01:12:33,437
<i>forever 22, as long as</i></i>

766
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:36,565
<i>they keep making parts</i>
to maintain you.</i></i>

767
01:12:36,857 --> 01:12:38,650
<i>But Colt 45...</i></i>

768
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:40,944
<i>He'll peel like yesterday's</i></i>

769
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:43,655
<i>paint, being just a bit of blood</i></i>

770
01:12:43,864 --> 01:12:44,907
<i>and bone.</i></i>

771
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:47,618
<i>He's a memory as we speak.</i></i>

772
01:12:48,118 --> 01:12:50,537
<i>But if you can cross over</i>
just a little,</i></i>

773
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:53,665
<i>just enough to taste</i>
each other's time...</i></i>

774
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,125
<i>Well, then</i></i>

775
01:12:55,334 --> 01:12:58,253
<i>your time together</i>
just might be enough.</i></i>

776
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:03,467
<i>-Would you want to live forever?
-Mortal</i></i>

777
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:07,930
<i>or immortal, here I die.</i></i>

778
01:13:08,972 --> 01:13:11,266
<i>I leave eternity to thee.</i></i>

779
01:13:12,309 --> 01:13:13,977
<i>For what is a man</i></i>

780
01:13:14,728 --> 01:13:18,148
<i>that he should live out</i>
the lifetime of his God?</i></i>

781
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:34,832
Who is Mercy?

782
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,876
He used to command a fleet.

783
01:13:39,628 --> 01:13:41,421
-What happened?
-Iùs not a pretty story.

784
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:43,924
He was wounded in
the battle of El Najaf.

785
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,844
The navy just couldn't scrap
a human hero, so

786
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:51,098
-they rebuilt him with cyborg parts.
-He's a cyborg?

787
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:53,183
Experimental model.

788
01:13:53,392 --> 01:13:56,436
He went renegade.
Saw the world as a hired soldier.

789
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:58,105
Ran guns in Gaza, Kabul,

790
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,691
led a coup in Mozambique...

791
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:03,819
The genùs a poet-warrior

792
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:05,612
in the classic sense.

793
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:16,874
<i>My wife, Velma.</i></i>

794
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,251
Where is she?

795
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:24,590
<i>-She's dead.</i>
-Sorry.</i>

796
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:29,386
<i>It was sort of an arranged</i>
marriage, the pairing of man</i></i>

797
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:30,512
<i>and machine.</i></i>

798
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:35,100
<i>Velma was a free spirit,</i>
a searcher for a better world.</i></i>

799
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:38,228
<i>She spent most of her time</i>
helping renegade cyborgs</i></i>

800
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:40,522
<i>escape from Pinwheel's hell.</i></i>

801
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:42,733
<i>But they finally got her.</i></i>

802
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:46,069
<i>Your tapper, Bench, killed her.</i></i>

803
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:48,655
<i>But not before she messed him up.</i></i>

804
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:51,783
Is that why you're helping
Cash and me?

805
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:56,079
<i>Marriage is a magical thing.</i></i>

806
01:14:57,414 --> 01:14:59,500
<i>A treacherous thing.</i></i>

807
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:02,336
<i>Pull out that center drawer.</i></i>

808
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:04,922
<i>Open it.</i></i>

809
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:11,386
<i>Some things are customary</i>
before a man goes into battle.</i></i>

810
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:30,669
<i>Iùs time to rumble.</i></i>

811
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:50,481
<i>I've spoken to the fight promoter,</i>
Bobby Linn. He's expecting you.</i></i>

812
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:55,277
<i>This is the Dragon.</i></i>

813
01:18:55,486 --> 01:18:57,446
<i>Here's Pier 77.</i></i>

814
01:18:58,071 --> 01:18:59,948
<i>After the fight you'll have</i></i>

815
01:19:00,157 --> 01:19:02,159
<i>20 minutes to make it</i>
to Die Frau Maria.</i></i>

816
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:03,911
<i>-Who do we meet?
-The captain's name</i></i>

817
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:06,955
<i>is Joey Fook.</i>
He'll know what you look like.</i></i>

818
01:19:07,164 --> 01:19:10,083
<i>If he doesn't,</i>
you get the hell out. Fast.</i></i>

819
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,252
<i>Thaùs it.</i></i>

820
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:16,340
Win or lose, iùs been a trip.

821
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:18,842
You're a kick-ass wire, Mercy.

822
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:32,689
We're looking for Bobby Lin.

823
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:35,192
Mercy sent us.

824
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:03,053
Bobby Lin?

825
01:20:04,096 --> 01:20:05,556
Who want to know?

826
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:07,307
Mercy.

827
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:21,822
Mercy

828
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:24,616
says good things about you.

829
01:20:24,825 --> 01:20:27,327
Fast, lots of style.

830
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,038
This guy I'm fighting,

831
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:31,707
whaùs his record like?

832
01:20:32,749 --> 01:20:34,334
He first-time fighter, too.

833
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:37,045
Newcomers always

834
01:20:38,297 --> 01:20:39,840
kick the odds up.

835
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:41,008
Make lots more money.

836
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:44,970
Thaùs good.

837
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:02,988
Everything set.

838
01:21:04,573 --> 01:21:06,658
This next match

839
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:12,915
goes all the way.

840
01:21:18,337 --> 01:21:20,422
Round one, no blade.

841
01:21:20,631 --> 01:21:22,508
Round two, one blade.

842
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,719
Round three and final round,
both blades.

843
01:21:25,928 --> 01:21:27,513
Only person allowed is trainer.

844
01:21:27,805 --> 01:21:29,181
That you, right?

845
01:21:30,307 --> 01:21:33,352
Bell starts fight.
Give us a show, eh?

846
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:43,237
Whaùs our time situation?

847
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:47,324
Two minutes to bell.
44 to make the ship.

848
01:21:47,533 --> 01:21:49,827
Shit, Mercy. We got to make sure
things are settled with the boat.

849
01:21:51,995 --> 01:21:53,455
Be careful, Colt.

850
01:21:53,789 --> 01:21:55,958
Right. So, go.

851
01:22:00,754 --> 01:22:03,257
-For love.
-Yeah, what else is there?

852
01:22:04,007 --> 01:22:06,802
Go! Go! Go!

853
01:25:45,354 --> 01:25:45,979
Hit him!

854
01:27:04,808 --> 01:27:07,102
If you interfere,

855
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:09,188
Colt disqualified.

856
01:27:09,521 --> 01:27:11,899
No Mombasa.

857
01:27:38,091 --> 01:27:39,009
Kill him, Colt!

858
01:27:51,104 --> 01:27:53,816
-All right, break up this party.
-Yes, sir.

859
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:03,826
Colt! Pinwheel!

860
01:28:27,724 --> 01:28:28,433
Leùs go!

861
01:28:36,984 --> 01:28:38,861
No, don't, Cash.
They'll blow you away, baby.

862
01:28:39,069 --> 01:28:41,363
No they won't.
I cost too much.

863
01:28:43,782 --> 01:28:45,450
But your boyfriend is dirt cheap.

864
01:28:45,951 --> 01:28:47,411
Give it up, cyborg,
or he's

865
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:48,453
a dead man.

866
01:29:15,355 --> 01:29:17,024
<i>Way to stand by your man, Cash.</i></i>

867
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:19,318
<i>I like that. And Colt,</i></i>

868
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,988
<i>that was one hell of a fight.</i></i>

869
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:27,993
<i>And you, Pinwheel...</i></i>

870
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:29,745
<i>Pinheads...</i></i>

871
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:32,998
<i>I only have one thing to say.</i></i>

872
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:35,292
<i>Incoming.</i></i>

873
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:47,805
Goddamn it!

874
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:50,516
All right, break off and fan out.

875
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:52,184
I want these people

876
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:53,519
found.

877
01:30:13,747 --> 01:30:15,207
Mercy!

878
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:18,043
So much for a myth.

879
01:30:19,795 --> 01:30:22,214
If you want to dine
with the devil

880
01:30:23,132 --> 01:30:25,425
you'll need a long spoon.

881
01:31:15,476 --> 01:31:16,643
Mercy.

882
01:31:25,277 --> 01:31:26,445
I can do better.

883
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:38,957
Mercy,

884
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:41,877
glad you could make it.

885
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:46,548
You know you've always
been such a

886
01:31:46,757 --> 01:31:48,967
formidable opponent.

887
01:31:52,805 --> 01:31:55,432
Until your untimely capture,
that is.

888
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:00,521
And I thought I'd at least
let you come and watch me

889
01:32:01,063 --> 01:32:03,148
play my final card.

890
01:32:09,071 --> 01:32:11,156
You see, this is Chen's

891
01:32:11,365 --> 01:32:13,575
detonator.
It has a 2000

892
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:15,452
mile range.

893
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:18,872
So, alas, it appears that
the honeymoon is over

894
01:32:19,081 --> 01:32:20,666
for Cash and Colt.

895
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:22,751
What?

896
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:25,879
No quick, smart-ass remark?

897
01:32:26,797 --> 01:32:28,590
No retort from the man
with the video

898
01:32:28,799 --> 01:32:30,050
mouth?

899
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:37,349
Cash and Colt...

900
01:32:37,766 --> 01:32:39,434
You can kiss your asses good-bye.

901
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:44,439
<i>Warning! A detonation sequence</i>
has been detected within</i></i>

902
01:32:44,731 --> 01:32:46,108
<i>the complex.</i></i>

903
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,694
<i>Initiate emergency</i>
evacuation sequence.</i></i>

904
01:32:48,902 --> 01:32:51,613
I think you kissed
the wrong ass good-bye.

905
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:53,407
<i>One... Zero.</i></i>

906
01:34:48,105 --> 01:34:50,482
<i>Time is what iùs all about.</i></i>

907
01:34:50,691 --> 01:34:52,693
<i>Cash crossed over it</i></i>

908
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:55,612
<i>and lived the time</i>
of her beloved Colt.</i></i>

909
01:34:55,821 --> 01:34:57,781
<i>Proving once again</i></i>

910
01:34:57,990 --> 01:35:01,535
<i>that love is stronger than flesh</i></i>

911
01:35:02,703 --> 01:35:04,371
<i>or machine.</i></i>
