1
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,720
No radiation?

2
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,760
Perez, what did you got?

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,240
Chronometer is up and running, sir.

4
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,440
We'll have an answer as soon as
we have triangulation.

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,920
Perfect. Gives you fifteen
to scout the perimeter.

6
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,960
There's gotta be
somebody alive out there.

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,920
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,280
Hey you two. Keep your profession.

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,640
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,720
What exactly are we looking for?

11
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,440
There's nothing out here.

12
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
What do you think you're doing?

13
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,080
We're not due back
for another fifteen minutes.

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,280
Besides, what he doesn't know
won't hurt him.

15
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,120
Not now, Marco.
I don't wanna be put on report.

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Oh! Help! Help me! Help!

17
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,840
This is Perez.
Captain Finis, what's your status?

18
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,800
This is Perez. I repeat,
Captain Finis, what's your status?

19
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,440
Let's go!

20
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,440
What the hell did this?

21
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,080
Find the latch.

22
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,360
Got it!

23
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,520
Let's go! Come on!

24
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,080
Go...

25
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,200
- Dial us in.
- I'm on it.

26
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,600
Hurry. Come on.

27
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,080
Okay. Almost there.

28
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,680
Got it!

29
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,960
Move aside, move.

30
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,560
What happened, private?

31
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,040
Hey, you're gonna be fine.
What went wrong out there?

32
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,560
It's not here, captain.

33
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,720
What about the latch? Where is it?

34
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,600
No.

35
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,440
I need to know where the device is.
Do you have it with you?

36
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,520
With Marco.

37
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,960
Marco?

38
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,120
Marco.

39
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,840
Damn it.

40
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,280
Captain?

41
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,200
It's on the other side.

42
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,440
It was then
that he realized his mistake.

43
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
{\an5}Building the device was supposed...

44
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,200
{\an5}to provide answers.

45
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
{\an5}Would humanity achieve...

46
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
{\an5}a utopian society or would...

47
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,640
{\an5}be destroy ourselves?

48
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,840
{\an5}The answer was swift in coming.

49
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,520
{\an5}The device brought only suffering...

50
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,880
{\an5}death and despair.

51
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
{\an5}What he beheld was no glorious...

52
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,840
{\an5}future, it was the end of man...

53
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,600
{\an5}the end of hope, of love.

54
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,320
{\an5}The end of the world.

55
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,480
Yes, question?

56
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,760
{\an5}Dude, are you kidding me with this?

57
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,560
I'm sorry.
Don't quite understand the question.

58
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,560
{\an5}You wrote the book in this weird...

59
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,160
{\an5}technical jargon and it's...

60
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
it's just not a story.

61
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,760
It's like a scientific manual for...

62
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
{\an5}events that actually happened.

63
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,240
{\an5}Still waiting for a question.

64
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,480
So like, what's it all about?

65
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,320
Well, it's in a narrative style
that I felt would be engaging for...

66
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
the reader and you know,
it made it a lot more readable.

67
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
I get that, it's just...

68
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,800
half the footnotes you're alluding to
don't exist.

69
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,040
They're just marked classified.
So, is your narrative style...

70
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,520
to try and piss off your readers?

71
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,160
I think that's a good question but...

72
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,840
I wonder that I really can't provide
an intelligent answer...

73
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,440
for in the limited time that I have.
So...

74
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,760
What?

75
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,480
Yeah, look. I'm sorry.
I'm honored to be here and...

76
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,320
really appreciate you guys
coming out.

77
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,360
but I have a previous engagement
so gotta run.

78
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,880
And you know, enjoy the book.
Please buy many copies...

79
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,280
for friends and family. Cheers.

80
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
James.

81
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,680
Angela.

82
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,120
Bit of a step up from the ol' Chevy,
isn't? it?

83
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,720
Just get in.

84
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
Am I getting offed?

85
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,120
You've been ignoring my calls.

86
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,760
Well, there was the divorce,
and the book tour...

87
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,160
tour being a little presumptuous
of course.

88
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
I read it.

89
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,360
Oh, your end notes saying
they were classified...

90
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,160
that was a nice touch.

91
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,480
Course if it had been
five years ago...

92
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,720
it may not have been seen
in the same light.

93
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
Five years ago.

94
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,120
We're finished here.

95
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
James.

96
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,040
I was out of line. It's important!

97
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,600
I thought we'd finished
with this clandestine crap.

98
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,120
There's been an accident,
and it involves your work.

99
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
What, somebody accidentally
bought a copy of the book?

100
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,160
Your previous work.

101
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,800
- Time travel?
- Yes.

102
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
You're serious.

103
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,360
Yes.

104
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,240
- That's from the device.
- A refraction crystal.

105
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Something to remember you by.

106
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,640
It's unlike you to cling to failure.

107
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,160
It didn't fail.

108
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,520
The project?

109
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,600
It works.

110
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,520
We have a plane leaving
in twenty minutes.

111
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,000
<i>Attention,
all nonessential personnel...</i>

112
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,360
<i>check in with the duty officer
by 0700.</i>

113
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,960
<i>Dr. Watkins, need you to report to
the E.M. chamber.</i>

114
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,440
The team were supposed to
go to the other side...

115
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,680
and set up a stellar chronometer.

116
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,240
- To determine what year it was.
- Exactly...

117
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,360
but they were interrupted
before they could get a reading.

118
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,200
By what?

119
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,880
The future isn't
what we thought it was going to be.

120
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:10,000
Look James, before we get into this
I need to apologize.

121
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,840
What part, exactly?

122
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,160
For not talking you into staying.

123
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,720
Staying? People died because of me,
because of my arrogance.

124
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,680
We succeeded.

125
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,880
Tell it to the ten people
who disappeared.

126
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,360
Look, I would give anything to change
what happened.

127
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,960
But, that's why we're doing this.

128
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,560
You of all people
know the potential here.

129
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
We can go back and fix it.

130
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,320
This whole place
should've been leveled.

131
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
It's not all on your shoulders.

132
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,240
Hundreds of people
were right beside you.

133
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
And I pushed the button.

134
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,560
And I stayed behind
to clean up the mess.

135
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,760
You should've left with me.

136
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,120
What was I supposed to do?

137
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,360
These people buried my career.

138
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,080
And you chose them over me.

139
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,560
Stop. Arms up.

140
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,400
Well, it's about time.

141
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,080
Colonel Wichita,
for the welcome wagon.

142
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,520
My apologies.

143
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,040
I wanted to witness
the return of the prodigal son.

144
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,120
So, how's it been?

145
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,840
Oh, you know, women,
booze, parties, writing.

146
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,000
Ah yes, your book.
Touched on some sensitive subjects.

147
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,520
Classified subjects.

148
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,920
He read it, too.

149
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Enough that I was going to have you
arrested for writing it.

150
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,600
Until I was convinced otherwise.

151
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,600
- Hmm? By whom?
- Your wife.

152
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,000
Ex-wife.

153
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,480
She seems to think I've done
enough to ruin your life already.

154
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,880
Thanks.

155
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,560
Well, we're all tickled pink
that you landed on your feet...

156
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,960
more or less.

157
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,240
Dr. Radnor is to have
complete access to this facility.

158
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Welcome back, James.

159
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,200
You said you were gonna shut it down.

160
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,440
No.

161
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,120
I told you that we would not try
to recreate your experiment.

162
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,120
And yet, here you are
doing exactly that anyway.

163
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,720
Listen Radnor,
this country is falling behind.

164
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,200
Mining the future for technology
can put us back on top.

165
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,280
The project's working so well,
what do you need me for?

166
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,600
Fair enough.

167
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,040
Show him.

168
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,120
What the hell happened here?

169
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,160
We had a little trouble
with the natives.

170
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,320
- Natives? What, you mean the...
- From the future.

171
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes. I thought you said
he was a genius.

172
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,840
James, meet Dr. Felix Watkins.

173
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,960
- He's the one who is...
- What did you do?

174
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,200
I realized that the data
from your initial experiment...

175
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,080
was consistent with a temporal rip
but it was unstable.

176
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,640
You were able to rework the sequence?

177
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,320
- Yes.
- How?

178
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,920
Doctor, it's rather complicated.

179
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
Yes, I know it is. I came up with it.
Look, what did you change?

180
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,400
I formulated a new
temporal coefficient.

181
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,840
- It was quite simple, really...
- Once you had...

182
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,320
my original sequences and
equations to work off of, yes.

183
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,040
I perfected them.

184
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,560
No, you filled in the blanks.
A new temporal coefficient...

185
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,440
doesn't solve the overriding problem.

186
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,400
We have been successful,
successful...

187
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,080
You have not been lucky.
Look, is that why I'm here.

188
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,640
Because he doesn't
understand the underlying concept?

189
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,840
No, James, look,
Felix was the one who was able to...

190
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,600
maintain the first stable rip.
Now, we need you because...

191
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,400
well, we ran into a problem
with the latch.

192
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,600
That's what we call the device
that latches onto...

193
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,720
'Cause it latches on
to reiterative tachyon fluctuations.

194
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,960
Yes, I know, I invented it.

195
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,720
Look, I can't believe you
built another one. This is nuts!

196
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,520
Look, where is the thing now?

197
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,120
It's not a question of where,
it's more a question of when.

198
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,600
<i>Detecting tachyon surge.
E.M. radiation rising.</i>

199
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,880
This sometimes happens before a rip.

200
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,520
Sometimes?

201
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,080
Yeah, you might wanna stand back.

202
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,920
James.

203
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,120
Tachyon surge reaches 38,000
cycles per millisecond...

204
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,240
the space-time continuum will rip.
Who's tracking this?

205
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,920
It's amazing.

206
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,120
No, James. James, look out!

207
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,080
Yeah, we might wanna get out of here.

208
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,800
What the hell were those things?

209
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,760
Well technically they're known
as U.B.E.s...

210
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,360
unknown biological entities.

211
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,680
We just call them hostiles.

212
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Yeah but, surely the humans from
the future would wanna...

213
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,480
destroy creatures that
hunt, kill and eat us.

214
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,240
Well, as far as we can tell,
in the future humanity is...

215
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,480
Extinct.

216
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,280
Vanished from the face of the earth.

217
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,960
So you traveled thousands of years
into the future...

218
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,560
only to discover the end of mankind?

219
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,560
Look, James, if humanity's
gonna be destroyed...

220
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,920
then don't you wanna
find out how, when?

221
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,560
Maybe try and figure out
a way to stop it?

222
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,040
Yeah but,
you've lost control of the rip.

223
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,160
You don't even know
where the latch is.

224
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,680
We believe it's been damaged
and is now malfunctioning.

225
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,400
Creating rips at random intervals,
each time the rips do appear...

226
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,320
they're growing larger
and they're lasting longer.

227
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,160
It's almost as though
they're feeding off themselves.

228
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,400
You've got a problem
that's getting exponentially worse.

229
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,000
- Yes.
- And you're screwed.

230
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,640
Soon the rips will become permanent.

231
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,560
By that point they'll be large enough
to swallow the whole base...

232
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,080
then the whole state.

233
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,560
Eventually they'll engulf the entire
planet in a permanent rip...

234
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,040
between present and future.

235
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,520
So what do you want me
to do about it?

236
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
Fix the device.

237
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,360
How? It's on the other side,
remember with your hostiles?

238
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,120
Can you build another one?

239
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,000
Of course I can, given enough time,
but that's not gonna help us.

240
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,280
Look, each device is keyed
to a specific time.

241
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,000
Your latch jumped, say,
a thousand years into the future.

242
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,520
That's what ensures you come back
to the time that you left from.

243
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,840
And if I built another one,
it there's no way of controlling...

244
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,040
when it would send us. I mean,
it could send us back in time.

245
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,320
Then we proceed with Plan B.

246
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,840
Captain Hoyle will assemble a team
to retrieve the device.

247
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,040
No, you can't just bring it back.

248
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,720
He's right. If we bring the latch
back through an open rip...

249
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,440
- it...
- Kaboom!

250
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,120
And you're the only person
who can repair it, correct?

251
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,320
Look, why don't you talk to him?
He's the guy who built the device.

252
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,000
Based on your plans and designs,
Doctor.

253
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,000
Which means you're the only one
who can repair it.

254
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,280
Okay.
Let me see if I got this straight.

255
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,920
You want me to travel
through a rip in time...

256
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,440
find and repair a device
that you lost and broke...

257
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,760
all the while trying to avoid
rampaging creatures from the future.

258
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,080
That about sum it up?

259
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,960
- James, wait!
- Don't bother following me.

260
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,680
Hold it right there, sir.

261
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,080
Oh, come on.

262
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,200
He's free to leave.

263
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,400
It sure doesn't look that way.

264
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,360
I can't force you to help, James.

265
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,720
But that's not gonna stop you
from trying.

266
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,640
I don't think
we understand each other.

267
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,120
No, have to agree with you on that.

268
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
You think I'm reckless...

269
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,960
that I pushed this project
without thinking of consequences.

270
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,840
My job is to consider consequences.
Is gaining X worth losing Y?

271
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,320
So this project was worth
the lives of those soldiers?

272
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,440
People have died.

273
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,240
But without your help,
more people will.

274
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,840
Felix didn't spend his career
designing this technology, you did.

275
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,840
But, forget it. Go. Get him a ride.

276
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,040
I know what's wrong with the latch.

277
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,480
I think I can fix it.

278
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,360
The latch if your first priority.

279
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,560
Until you find it,
the earth is in your hands.

280
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,520
And I shouldn't need to remind you,
if it's damaged further...

281
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,360
you could be stranded.

282
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,040
Rip should spit you out
a few hundred yards from the spike.

283
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,720
And this E.M scanner should point you
in the right direction.

284
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,760
That's a lot of shoulds.

285
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,240
- Tyrell.
- Yes sir.

286
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,680
I want you and Pip on point
with the Doc.

287
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,680
- Keep it tight.
- Roger that.

288
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,880
Hey, what happens
if the Doc can't fix this thing?

289
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,160
Okay, be fine, it's just like...

290
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,560
stepping through a revolving door,
right?

291
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,560
He's smarter than he looks.

292
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,880
Sir, what are the rules
of engagement?

293
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah. We're gonna shoot
these bastards, right?

294
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,880
We're going into enemy territory.

295
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,120
We'll keep a low profile,
unless we see an enemy target.

296
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,640
Roger that.

297
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,560
It's like stepping
through a revolving door, right.

298
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,520
Alright squad, we're Oscar Mike.
Stay sharp.

299
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
Temporal rip is imminent.

300
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,440
Move into positions.

301
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,080
When you're through,
stay clear of the rip.

302
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,360
Yes sir.

303
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,440
Pip, lead the way.

304
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,840
Damm it, Doc.

305
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm sorry.

306
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,000
Pull yourself together.

307
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,480
Alright, that's our cue.

308
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,840
Fan out, groups of two.
You get any E.M. readings...

309
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,240
see any hostile activity,
you radio in.

310
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,440
- Is that clear?
- Sir, yes sir!

311
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,200
- Tyrell, Pip, you're with the Doc.
- Sir, yes sir!

312
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Now, people, wake up and move out!

313
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
Man, you guys sure did screw
this thing up.

314
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,880
Yeah, we sure did.

315
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,240
Thanks. God...

316
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,760
that time jump is not
doing great things to my inner ear.

317
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,240
Name's Peter Squally.
But everybody calls me Pip-Squeak.

318
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,800
James Radnor.

319
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,880
- What?
- Come on, man...

320
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,640
everybody knows who you are.

321
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,200
You're the reason we all out here
gettin' hunted by monsters.

322
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,960
Right. I'm sorry about that.

323
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,800
Hey, don't be sorry, man.

324
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,880
Alright, now, speaking of...

325
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,720
what is the strategy
if we run into one?

326
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,400
Don't worry, Doc, we take care of ya.
But, if you see me running...

327
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,480
I suggest you do the same.

328
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,840
Noted.

329
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,280
Hey, Doc! Where you goin'?
Supposed to stay behind me!

330
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,320
This is it. We found it.

331
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
That wasn't so bad now, was it?

332
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,600
God.

333
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,440
It's gotta be...

334
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,160
- Doc.
- Yeah, you mind giving me a hand?

335
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah. Speakin' of hands,
if you wanna keep yours...

336
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,600
you might consider
takin' a big ol' step back.

337
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,320
Why? What is it?

338
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,400
What is it?

339
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,080
What?

340
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,760
Let's go! Go!

341
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,680
Let's go!

342
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,840
This is Tyrell! We got enemy.
Repeat, enemy! Birds!

343
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,840
Pip-Squeak, go!

344
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,400
Clear!

345
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,280
Tyrell!

346
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,560
Hardcore.

347
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,360
Damn it, corporal!

348
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,760
What's going on? I heard live fire.

349
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,200
We found the latch, sir.

350
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,520
- Where is it?
- Oh, these evil raptor birds...

351
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,000
Where's the latch!

352
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,360
Son of a bitch!

353
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,480
Fall back, team! Fall back!

354
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,800
Get those legs working! Move!

355
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,160
Heads down!

356
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,480
This way!

357
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,600
Damn it!

358
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,760
We hold in there!
Suppression team in there!

359
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,360
Sight for the corner!

360
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,800
Short bursts!

361
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
Short bursts! Aim for the body!

362
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,920
You're cleared hot!

363
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,960
Tyrell, one o'clock, hot!

364
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,280
I got ya!

365
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,440
Pip-Squeak, watch the roof!

366
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Sir, yes sir!

367
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,680
Stay controlled!

368
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,600
Hold your fire!

369
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,280
Are we still cleared hot, sir?

370
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,600
No. Hold your fire.

371
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,760
Is that?

372
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,280
Those creatures.

373
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,440
Hold your positions.

374
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,760
There's something else out there.

375
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,840
Hold your fire.

376
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,320
No...

377
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,920
Patterson.

378
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,760
We have been waiting
a long time for you.

379
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,120
You know these men?

380
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,800
Sorta.

381
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,480
I killed them.

382
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,800
No radio contact during the rip.

383
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,200
Large pupils, light sensitive skin...

384
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,240
endogenous circadian rhythms
and nerve ganglia.

385
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,400
We can assume
a primarily nocturnal existence.

386
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,240
Assume?

387
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,080
I'm still working. We won't know
anything for sure until...

388
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,320
- Yeah. Where's the DNA test?
- It isn't finished.

389
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,120
That should be your first priority.

390
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,600
It's running on the sequencer
right now.

391
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,840
I can't make it process any faster.

392
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,800
Look, you should've
let me go with them.

393
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,600
Negative, Doctor.
Too dangerous for a civilian.

394
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
I don't feel right about this.

395
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,160
The United States government
does not...

396
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,840
make decisions based on feelings.

397
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,680
Yeah, well maybe they should.
Look, people's lives are at stake.

398
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
I shouldn't be in here
dissecting this thing.

399
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,760
I should be out there helping.

400
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,640
Get your initial findings into
this report as soon as possible.

401
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,080
I need to send...

402
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,360
Well...

403
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,360
let's just say, people are waiting
to hear what you find.

404
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,480
Oncology.

405
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,960
This is Colonel Wichita.

406
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,120
How is he, Doctor?

407
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,560
I don't accept that.

408
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Are there experimental options,
anything at all?

409
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,240
Please change your rhetoric, Doctor.
I...

410
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,040
There is always cause for hope.

411
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,760
You mind explaining this to me?

412
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,800
Patterson's team
were the guinea pigs man...

413
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
the first team we tried to
send through time.

414
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,040
Yeah, but I thought you killed them.

415
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,160
Yeah, you and me both,
but I guess we must've just...

416
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,760
what, zapped you forward?

417
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,000
We were only meant to go
fifteen minutes into the future...

418
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,320
but somehow
that didn't quite pan out.

419
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,560
Sure did take you long enough
to come looking for us.

420
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,520
- Yeah, look, about...
- Yeah, that's a pleasure.

421
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,520
Look, it's not that
we're not grateful.

422
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,760
It's just...

423
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,720
how do we get back anyway?

424
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,560
That part is a little complicated.

425
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,920
Complicated? No, complicated
is living off dead squirrels...

426
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,760
and dirty river water
for God knows how long.

427
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,560
We'll get you home as soon as we can.

428
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,400
But to do it,
we need to find the latch.

429
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,560
The latch?

430
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,920
It's our one ticket home.
No latch, no time travel.

431
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,680
Right now it's in the middle of
a frickin' giant ostrich nest.

432
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Yeah, we need to go get it.

433
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,880
No, we need to get underground.

434
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,440
Excuse me?

435
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,720
They hunt at night.

436
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,400
Great.

437
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,240
Hey, what was that thing you used
back there, scared off the creatures?

438
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,200
You mean this guy?

439
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,840
Is that bone?

440
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,560
Vocal chords from a morlock.

441
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
Excuse me? Did you say morlock?

442
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,880
Yeah. We found some newspapers
and that's what people called them.

443
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,000
Before they got wiped out.
Anyway, you don't wanna do that.

444
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,440
Why's that?

445
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,960
They scare predators,
but they attract morlocks.

446
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,320
We need to talk.
The creatures aren't creatures.

447
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,600
Their genetic makeup is human.
That isn't all.

448
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,200
The DNA, the chromosome pairs
are identical.

449
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,720
- Meaning?
- Well...

450
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,680
all human life
has forty-six chromosomes...

451
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,920
two sets of twenty-three,
one from each parent.

452
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,520
Whatever these things are,
they came from one human...

453
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,880
a male, to be specific.

454
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,320
We need to tell somebody about this.

455
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,360
Listen, we need to get your data to
Project E.L.O.I. as soon as possible.

456
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,960
So they can begin extracting the DNA.

457
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,960
No, well, there might still
be a way to prevent it...

458
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,120
so that no one else gets hurt.

459
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,040
No one will, I promise.

460
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,640
But first we need to get that data
to the hospital.

461
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
What's happening?

462
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,760
It's a major E.M. spike.
No radio contact yet but...

463
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,560
but something is
definitely coming in.

464
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,440
Should be James.

465
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,560
Felix.

466
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,840
Open the door.

467
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,600
Open the damn door!

468
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,920
I'm trying.

469
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
No.

470
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
No!

471
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,720
Oh my god.

472
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,560
What is this place?

473
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,040
Wait, stop. Where're you taking us?

474
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,720
Don't you recognize it?

475
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,600
Welcome home.

476
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,960
Okay guys, go. Move.

477
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,120
Come on, keep moving.

478
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,880
Do you know what happened to
all the people?

479
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,360
I mean, is it's like this everywhere?

480
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
We've only been as far as
the nearest town.

481
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,200
That was bad enough,
crawling with morlocks.

482
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,000
We didn't wanna go any further
than that...

483
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,640
because we didn't wanna
miss the rescue party.

484
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,440
Besides,
this is the safest place to be.

485
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,800
Roof over our head,
doors that still lock...

486
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,400
and a locker full of ammo.

487
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,080
And you got power.

488
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,760
Yeah. Backup generator
was the only thing that survived...

489
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,720
whatever blew this place.

490
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,040
I don't think I would've made it
if I was in your shoes.

491
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,440
Yeah. You're probably right.

492
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,800
We dragged most of our stuff
down here.

493
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,560
It's the most secure spot
in the whole building.

494
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,960
We had hoped to find enough
odds and ends...

495
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,480
to build a latch or
whatever you call it.

496
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,000
But most of the stuff was fried.

497
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,800
There was one thing of note, though.

498
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,680
Anderson, bring up
the security footage.

499
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,040
<i>We need to talk.</i>

500
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,680
What is this?

501
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,920
The video's corrupted. Just hang on.

502
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,600
<i>Creatures aren't creatures.
They're genetic makeup is human.</i>

503
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,520
What the hell?

504
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,920
<i>We need to get your data to
Project E.L.O.I. as soon as possible.</i>

505
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,760
<i>So they can begin extracting the DNA.</i>

506
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,080
<i>Well there might still be a way
to prevent it...</i>

507
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,200
<i>- so that no one else gets hurt.</i>
- They can't be human.

508
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,280
<i>No one will, I promise.</i>

509
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,920
Oh no.

510
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,480
Look, can you pull up
the Project E.L.O.I. file?

511
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,080
What do you know about
Project E.L.O.I.?

512
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,360
Never heard of it.

513
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,960
Look, is there anything else
you can bring up?

514
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,000
That's the end of the record.
The server's scorched.

515
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,680
So what're we gonna do?

516
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,320
- About what?
- About this?

517
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,520
I mean, look those things are humans.
We can't just kill them.

518
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,120
They won't extend you
the same courtesy.

519
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,280
We gotta get 'em back to the way
they were before or...

520
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,000
stop this from happening
in the first place.

521
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,840
No we don't.
We need to find the latch...

522
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,440
and get the hell out of here.
I'm sorry about your wife.

523
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,840
No one else is gonna say this to you,
so I will.

524
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,640
If the morlocks got her, she's dead.

525
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,280
Look, this isn't just about Angela.
Look, I have an obligation.

526
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,680
What about your obligations to us?
We've waited years...

527
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,600
for you to come and find us and
when you do you spend your time...

528
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,840
running around morlock country
looking for a dead girl...

529
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,160
and looking for clues for something
that hasn't even happened yet.

530
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,760
You aren't even looking for us.

531
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,760
I have a family.

532
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,720
They think I'm dead.
My kids think I'm dead.

533
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,720
If you do anything but find the latch
and get us the hell out of here...

534
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,480
you're risking our lives.

535
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,960
- I'm sorry, but I have to insist...
- No.

536
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,720
Patterson's right.

537
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,840
What?

538
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,160
I have orders. Get the latch,
bring it home.

539
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,600
C.O. said if I find any of
our missing people, I bring 'em back.

540
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,640
But he was clear.
The latch is our mission.

541
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,080
Yeah, but I created this. I mean...

542
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,000
this could be the one good thing
that comes of it.

543
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,080
I mean, if we have to
go to one of the nearest cities...

544
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,800
look up some files,
try to figure out what caused...

545
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,400
My orders are final!

546
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,560
At sunup, we go get this thing
and get the hell out of here.

547
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,480
And you got a problem with that,
when we get back...

548
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,560
you take it up with Wichita.

549
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,280
Doc.

550
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,880
See anything?

551
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,080
Nope. All clear.

552
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,320
Yeah.

553
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,840
Must've been hard for you to try
and work out a life here.

554
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,080
I was eating army rations,
either way.

555
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,800
Me, I couldn't handle it.
I mean the stress and everything.

556
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,440
I don't know
how you can live that long...

557
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,280
with just those guys around here.

558
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,840
Meaning?

559
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,720
Come on, man.
They're a sad-looking bunch.

560
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,760
You ladies, man you know, have needs.
Know what I'm sayin'?

561
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,000
Well, that's good.
Really, just great.

562
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,840
I finally got somebody new
to talk to, you're a walking cliche.

563
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,720
Okay.

564
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,920
Okay.

565
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,000
Okay Anderson, we need a minute here.

566
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,320
You take five.

567
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
How many?

568
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,480
Five.

569
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,400
Half the team.

570
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,640
I lost the first
when we were making our way uptown...

571
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,400
just up and vanished.

572
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,440
I didn't know anything was wrong...

573
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,400
till I found his dog tags
in a pile of blood.

574
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,280
They build nests,
collect their kills...

575
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,280
their captures, if you like.

576
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,360
Any idea where they'd 've taken 'em?

577
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,600
Yeah. But you don't wanna go there.

578
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,600
Let's start over. Hi, I'm Tyrell.

579
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,600
Okay, Tyrell.

580
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,280
This is what I've been thinking
about since...

581
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,120
the day we got stuck here.

582
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,480
Loading it.

583
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,600
Pointing it.

584
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,960
Pulling the trigger.

585
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,320
Ending all my problems, forever.

586
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,880
You were gonna kill yourself?

587
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,040
Nah. I was gonna shoot Patterson.

588
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,840
Son of a bitch.

589
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,760
Get the door.

590
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,960
Move!

591
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,720
What's goin' on?

592
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,600
Back! Come on!

593
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,120
I thought you said
this place was secure.

594
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,360
- It was.
- Well, not anymore.

595
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Time to move out. Move! Go!

596
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,680
Cortez, head for the hatch!
We're movin' out!

597
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,760
Keep movin'!

598
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,240
Watch your back!

599
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,000
Go!

600
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,200
Nice of you to join us.

601
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,040
Clear!

602
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,640
Go! Move! Get some speed!

603
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,600
Keep movin'!

604
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,720
Come in.

605
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,520
Colonel, you wanted to see me?

606
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,920
Dr. Watkins, you need to finish
what Dr. Kelly started.

607
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,560
The purpose of this project is bring
back technology from the future.

608
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,880
Instead we found these creatures.

609
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,640
And after our last encounter,
Dr. Kelly did a genetic test.

610
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,880
They're human.

611
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,160
They're like cousins.

612
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,040
More primitive than us in some ways
and in others more evolved...

613
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,960
stronger, faster,
more resistant to disease.

614
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,360
If we could extract their DNA,
we could use it to...

615
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,520
Colonel, Dr. Kelly was killed
by one of these creatures.

616
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,720
We don't know that.

617
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,760
I think we oughta be focused on
getting our people back right now...

618
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,680
besides, which I'm not a geneticist.

619
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,760
I think we oughta wait and bring in
someone who's an expert on DNA.

620
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,680
It can't wait. And it's an order.

621
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,560
I'm not military. I'm a civilian.

622
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,360
And I'm telling you
it's not going to happen.

623
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,280
Start work on the DNA extraction
or there will be repercussions.

624
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,280
It was right here. Now I got nothing.

625
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,920
You sure this is the right place?

626
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,520
I'm positive.

627
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,520
Morlocks were here.
They must've taken the latch.

628
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,120
- Why would they?
- Because they collect junk.

629
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,400
- Why?
- Because they're American.

630
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,720
I don't know.

631
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,600
We seen 'em picking up old rubbish,
broken toasters, VCRs.

632
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,960
Well whatever their reasons
for taking it...

633
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,920
we need that device to get back home.
Let's get moving.

634
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,440
You recognize it?

635
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,840
It's Angela's.

636
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,680
They've taken her.

637
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,840
Help me!

638
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,400
We've trailed the morlocks
this far before.

639
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,440
But beyond it,
ain't no one ever come back.

640
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,640
At least we know they hunt at night.

641
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,800
Exactly.

642
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,040
Which means that during the day
they hold up some place dark...

643
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,600
where they've got the advantage.

644
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,080
Like what, a cave?

645
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,920
Think bigger.

646
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,680
Looks like we'll have to split up.

647
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,120
I'm gonna head west,
find some high ground.

648
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,600
Alright. Tyrell,
take Pip and Cortez, head down.

649
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,520
- Remember, keep your eyes open...
- And my lips sealed.

650
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,640
Right. Radio silence, got it.

651
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,560
Come on, you heard the man. Move out.

652
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,080
I guess I'm with you?

653
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,480
Lucky me.

654
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,520
Toppling oppressive regimes,
assassinate brutal dictators.

655
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,120
Hell, I'd even
do another U.N. police action.

656
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,720
But this, getting' lost in time?

657
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,280
Wading through a sewer
that smells like monkey crap...

658
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,680
this definitely ain't
what I signed on for.

659
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,800
There's always Vera, right?

660
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,120
Yeah.

661
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,240
Nothin' loves good misery
like good company...

662
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,440
- What happened?
- It's kind of dark. Vera?

663
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,000
Fall back.

664
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,120
- See anything, man?
- Nuh-uh.

665
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,200
What's that? You see that?

666
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,920
Man, what the hell is that?

667
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,120
What?

668
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,960
Man.

669
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,880
You're one impressive bitch.

670
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,640
She used us for bait.

671
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,480
You think that's impressive?
Wait 'til you see what I found.

672
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,760
This place is a damned labyrinth.

673
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,280
We're not getting anywhere.

674
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,720
Help me!

675
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,280
What was that?

676
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,480
I hear it, too.

677
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,400
That was Angela.

678
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,000
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

679
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,320
The latch is our priority.

680
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,080
You're gonna need this.

681
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,680
Okay. Make it quick.

682
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,720
Help me!

683
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,720
Help me!

684
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,080
Help me! Help!

685
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,000
Help me!

686
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,440
Help me!

687
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,080
Help!

688
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,720
James!

689
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
- Angela!
- James!

690
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,440
- You gotta get me out of here.
- Okay.

691
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,600
You've got to be quiet.
They're everywhere.

692
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,920
Okay. I think I found a way out.

693
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,280
Can you get up there? Can you get up?

694
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,320
Wait, just stay there.

695
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,360
Let's go.

696
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,360
Go!

697
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,840
What d'ya think?

698
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,720
I'll get it working.

699
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,280
It's amazing after all these years,
they've still got power.

700
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,680
Impressed?

701
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,120
You know it, baby.

702
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,240
Guys? I think we might have
a slight problem.

703
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,320
<i>Captain.</i>

704
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,120
Damn it, Tyrell, does maintain
radio silence mean anything to you?

705
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,000
<i>Yeah, I know sir.
But it's where you are.</i>

706
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,160
- What do you mean, where I am?
<i>- They're everywhere.</i>

707
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,080
You're about to become
really popular.

708
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,360
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

709
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,680
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

710
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,120
- Come on, let's move.
- Go.

711
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,920
Go!

712
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,360
Come on!

713
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,840
Hey, come on!

714
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,360
There're hundreds of these things!

715
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,880
Take the latch and
get your damn ass in there!

716
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,200
Move!

717
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,240
Dead end!

718
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,560
Patterson.

719
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,480
Patterson!

720
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,240
No time for Google eyes.
Get your asses moving!

721
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,800
Tyrell, what's your E.T.A.?

722
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,720
I can't roger you, sir.
I can't hear. Come on!

723
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,360
Hoyle! Get on the other side
of the light!

724
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,480
Get the doors shut.

725
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,240
Tyrell!

726
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,040
We have to get something! James!

727
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,760
What's your E.T.A.?

728
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,680
Where are you guys?

729
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,480
Move back!

730
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,880
The elevator's not working.
It's out of power.

731
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,720
- So we're...
- Cover me.

732
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,600
- Don't do it!
- I got it.

733
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,680
Come on!

734
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,920
Come on!

735
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,760
Come on!

736
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,680
The tissue started to degrade
as soon as the creature died.

737
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,200
At this point
there's nothing left to...

738
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,360
What're you telling me?

739
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,360
I can't do it.

740
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,360
Not with what we have.

741
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,120
If you want useable DNA,
we have to have a live sample.

742
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,400
Where's Patterson?

743
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,240
Sorry, Cortez.

744
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,760
I understand.

745
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,400
What is that?

746
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,240
Gonna need to fix that latch!

747
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,200
It's more of a mess than I thought.

748
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,280
Tyrell, let's get this thing moving!

749
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,400
I'm on it.

750
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,280
- Can you do it?
- I don't know.

751
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,600
Doc, talk to me. How we doing here?

752
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,920
I'm working as fast as I can!

753
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,320
That's not good enough!
We need an exit now!

754
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,360
The core bridge is damaged.

755
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,880
So, what do you need?

756
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,520
I don't know!

757
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,200
We got it!

758
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,160
Hope this doesn't blow us up.

759
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,960
Another E.M. pulse.

760
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,320
Yup, something's coming in.

761
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,280
- Can you identify it?
- No, but it's something big.

762
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,040
Lower your weapons.

763
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,840
Captain, you made it.

764
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,160
Sir.

765
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,880
And the others?

766
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,640
Lost 'em, sir.

767
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,200
But we did manage to
pick up some strays.

768
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,200
The latch, where is it?

769
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,080
It's right here.

770
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,040
And let me tell ya,
after a very large scotch...

771
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,440
possibly a nice hot bath...

772
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,960
I'm going to really enjoy bashing it
to pieces with a hammer.

773
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,840
Private Anderson, please relieve
Dr. Radnor of his cargo.

774
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,920
It's imperative that
this program go on...

775
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,360
with or without you.

776
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,680
You son of a bitch.

777
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,880
Glad you're home safe, Doctor.

778
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,800
Colonel!

779
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,320
Sir, I think you should see this.

780
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,360
Hey.

781
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,720
Hey Doc.

782
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,920
How long does she gotta be in there?

783
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,960
'Til she's been examined, debriefed.

784
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,160
She's got a family and friends.

785
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,960
I assume she does.

786
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,040
I mean, they're gonna
wanna know that she's okay.

787
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,000
A few more weeks
ain't gonna make any difference.

788
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,240
Weeks?

789
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,600
Look, I'll do whatever I can
to get her out sooner.

790
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,360
Yeah. Right.

791
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,280
What about Dr. Radnor?

792
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,240
You're all gonna stand by
and just let that happen?

793
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,000
My hands are tied.

794
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,200
You two had a thing, right?

795
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,600
You don't have children.

796
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,320
Come in, make yourself at home.

797
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,480
I have a son.

798
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,280
I would do anything for him,
whatever it took to make him safe.

799
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,240
Yeah, you know what? Save the spiel.
I've heard it all before.

800
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,920
You know, the North Koreans
are gonna nuke us...

801
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,960
Chinese are owning our mortgages,
Iranian jihads, all of it.

802
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,240
Time travel isn't a weapon.

803
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,840
This isn't about weapons.

804
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,760
It's about a twenty year old boy
lying in a hospital...

805
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,800
hooked up to a ventilator, dying...

806
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,400
while doctors tell me
there's nothing they can do.

807
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,000
Now these morlocks are genetically
related to humans...

808
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,520
but they're stronger,
more resistant to disease.

809
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,840
Project E.L.O.I. was designed
to bring back technology...

810
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,240
from the future to save this country.

811
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,560
And that is exactly
what it's gonna do.

812
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,200
Starting with my son.

813
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,720
No.

814
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,440
No... I've seen the future.
I know what happens.

815
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,840
If you use morlock DNA
to save your son, if you play God...

816
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,760
it's just gonna guarantee that
what I witnessed comes true.

817
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,840
Colonel. Colonel, don't do this!

818
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,360
Colonel!

819
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,680
Colonel, I was wondering
if I could...

820
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,480
I don't change my mind,
Doctor, so don't ask.

821
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,960
I understand. Let me talk to him.
Maybe I can convince him.

822
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,040
You have five minutes. Private.

823
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,680
Look, I don't have much time.

824
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,880
I'm no good at this,
but you were right.

825
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,800
We should've never continued
with the experiment.

826
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,040
You know, the whole time
we're together I was usually wrong...

827
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,360
so I guess I owe you.

828
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,880
What can we do to make it right?

829
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,720
Look, Wichita is off the reservation.
He's got his own agenda.

830
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,280
We can't get to the latch
to shut it down.

831
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,320
Well, we can't just give up.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

832
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,640
No, Angela.

833
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,480
You're our only hope.
You've to get out there...

834
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,240
you've to tell people
what's going on, try to stop it.

835
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,640
Well, what about you?

836
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,080
Don't worry about me,
you just... you go.

837
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,000
Okay, here goes nothin'.

838
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,880
Dr Felix Watkins, first attempt...

839
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,120
data retrieval
on the reclaimed latch.

840
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,840
Initializing...

841
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,320
and... good.

842
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,680
Data's flowing nicely.

843
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,960
Wait. This is impossible.

844
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,160
Angela, how far in the future
did you think you traveled?

845
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,360
Well, I assumed thousands...

846
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,640
Sixty-eight years.

847
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,960
That's what the latch is telling us.

848
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,600
You traveled sixty-eight years
into the future.

849
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,280
That means that
whatever's gonna happen...

850
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,720
Is gonna happen very soon.

851
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,840
Oh my God.

852
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,200
How? But how?

853
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,400
What? What're you doing?

854
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,920
It's going to be me. Me.
You understand?

855
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,480
Not you and not your friend Radnor.

856
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,360
- Felix...
- Stand back.

857
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,840
We've had enough messing around
with this thing...

858
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,120
Felix...

859
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,720
And the colonel, he's insane.
He threatened me.

860
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,120
- Did you know that?
- Felix.

861
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,400
We are gonna stay
and do science here.

862
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,920
- Felix...
- We're gonna go step-by-step...

863
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,840
and stop the wildcat show
grade stuff. Do you under...

864
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,200
Felix!

865
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,400
<i>Code red.</i>

866
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,480
<i>All personnel to the hostiles
have entered the reservation.</i>

867
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,560
<i>- Repeat, hostiles have entered...</i>
- Oh, damn it.

868
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,840
Oh my God.

869
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,280
A rip just formed in the hangar, sir.
Cause unknown.

870
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,080
Seal the base. Nobody gets in or out.

871
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,360
Yes sir.

872
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,360
Son of a bitch.

873
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,560
The base is under attack,
they need your help. Go!

874
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,720
What's going on?

875
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,840
The morlock escaped
and the time rip has opened.

876
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,880
See, I told you
I'd come back for you.

877
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,800
- God I miss that.
- Yeah.

878
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,680
Not available?

879
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,760
I'm being overwhelmed by hostiles.

880
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,040
I mean we've seen
hundreds of hostiles.

881
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,440
I repeat, I'm being overrun
by hostiles. I'm out of ammo.

882
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,880
No!

883
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,560
- Tyrell.
- We've gotta get out of here.

884
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,200
Okay. Gun.

885
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,920
We gotta move and we gotta move fast.

886
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,160
Let's do this.

887
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,480
This way.

888
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,320
Sir, I have a Private Strickland
on the red line.

889
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,520
Put him on.

890
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,880
- Situation report, private.
<i>- Sir.</i>

891
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,360
<i>We're getting slaughtered down here.
We need reinforcements.</i>

892
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,680
I'm afraid that's not possible.
I'm sealing off the base.

893
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,920
- Retreat to...
<i>- Sir, we can't hold out.</i>

894
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,200
<i>There's just too many of 'em.</i>

895
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,480
<i>- There are hostiles everywhere.</i>
- Cut it off.

896
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,400
<i>All around my position.
Sir, we are being overrun.</i>

897
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,960
I said cut the damned thing off, now.

898
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,320
<i>Sir. We are being overrun.</i>

899
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,400
Sir.

900
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,120
They're afraid of the sunlight.

901
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,880
As soon as the sun sets...

902
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,360
we won't be able to stop 'em
from leaving the base.

903
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,680
If we destroy the latch...

904
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,880
Not an option.

905
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,560
Sir, we can't risk
civilian contamination.

906
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,040
We must follow containment protocol.

907
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,640
I'm overriding that protocol.

908
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,960
Sir, you're not authorized
to override con...

909
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,760
- These stairs lead outside, right?
- Yeah.

910
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,600
Alright, you go.
I'll meet you up there.

911
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,480
- No, I'm coming with you.
- Angela, I...

912
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,400
No, I won't let you leave me,
not this time.

913
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,200
I can't leave without making sure
the latch is destroyed.

914
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,600
I know where it is. Follow me.

915
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,720
Ready for this?

916
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,520
Believe it, baby.

917
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,600
Tyrell!

918
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,440
This is Wichita. I'm sending it now.

919
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,840
Did you get it?

920
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,120
Did you get the data?

921
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,920
Damn it!

922
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,360
Tyrell, are you okay? Talk to me.

923
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,840
Are they all dead?

924
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,520
Yeah, the grenade got 'em.

925
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,520
- How bad am I?
- You're good.

926
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,240
Just need to find something
to stop the bleeding.

927
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,480
No. You go on without me.

928
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,000
I'm not letting you get killed
on account of me.

929
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,120
Not gonna happen.

930
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,160
- Vera...
- No, not this time.

931
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,840
Those creatures have killed
too many people I care about.

932
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,520
- What?
- I knew you'd come around.

933
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,080
I guess I'm just too darned
good looking to resist, huh?

934
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,320
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

935
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,920
Oh, come on crybaby,
get your sorry ass out of here.

936
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,440
Do you think it's safe?

937
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,040
The morlocks must've got through
by now.

938
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,040
Will it work?

939
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,680
Christ, not a chance.

940
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,000
- What, and you can't...
- Not this time, no. I mean...

941
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,440
we've just run out of luck.

942
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,760
Now what do we do, Doc?

943
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,880
Come on, a man like you
can't figure out a plan?

944
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,960
The rate the rip is expanding,
I mean...

945
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,400
it's gonna overwhelm us
in a matter of minutes.

946
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,480
We need some kind of
an energy pulse, like a...

947
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,760
This?

948
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,480
You can't just blow the...

949
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,640
Heads down.

950
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,760
You just stabilized the rip.

951
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,320
Look, can you do
the same thing again...

952
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,080
only like a hundred times
more powerful?

953
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,760
Hey, this is the U.S. Armed Forces,
Doc. We can do explosions.

954
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,160
What are you doing?

955
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,240
You don't open the door to hell
without having a way to close it.

956
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,560
What, this is self-destruct?

957
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,800
That's right. This should be
a big enough explosion.

958
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,480
Fuck.

959
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,400
Step away from the console, Captain.

960
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,320
Listen to me.

961
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,360
We have to follow protocol
and contain this.

962
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,920
If those things get out...

963
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,120
Don't move.

964
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,040
Colonel, listen.

965
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,120
It's over. The latch is destroyed.

966
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,760
Then you might as well
have killed him yourself.

967
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,440
Who?

968
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,920
My son.

969
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,080
Don't.

970
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,880
- Where are the charges?
- There.

971
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,800
Doc, take this.

972
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,560
Alright.

973
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,760
What are you doing?

974
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,680
Destroyed the console,
but not the explosives.

975
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,400
If we can get a charge inside
the event horizon of the rip...

976
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,200
When you say inside, you mean...

977
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,640
No, we'll find another way.

978
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,760
We don't have
a lot of options, Angela.

979
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,480
Look, if that rip
continues to expand...

980
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,600
it's the end of everything.

981
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,600
Look, someone has to go.
I started this...

982
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,920
I'm responsible for this,
I need to end this.

983
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,560
Hand over the charges.

984
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,520
What're you gonna do?

985
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,280
This is a gut shot.
I got twenty minutes, tops.

986
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,920
Just hand over the damn charges, Doc!

987
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,800
We both know I'm dead either way.

988
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,840
I do this, at least...

989
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,080
at least I know
my death meant something.

990
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,080
Thank you.

991
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,560
You're running out of time.

992
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,960
- Go.
- Let's go.

993
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,680
We need to get further away.

994
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,000
We can't be this close
when the rip blows.

995
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,120
- Then what do we do?
- I don't know.

996
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,960
Over here! Come on!

997
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,240
Come on, let's go!

998
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,720
Come on, let's go!

999
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,000
No! Into the tank.
Get into the tank!

1000
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,960
Come on. Right here!

1001
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,080
Yes. Come on, let's go, baby.

1002
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,520
I got ya.

1003
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,000
Come on, take her up!

1004
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,320
Turn it around and head for the tank!

1005
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,880
Now what?

1006
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,440
Now we get this thing started.

1007
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,080
How hard can it be to turn it on?

1008
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,640
Oh, jeez.

1009
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,960
- We're out of control.
- We're going to hit the dirt!

1010
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,840
- We're going down.
- Hold on!

1011
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,760
It's them.

1012
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,640
They made it.

1013
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,000
Come with me.

1014
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,600
Come on, let's go!

1015
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,480
Okay. It's my turn.

1016
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,320
Yeah, well be my guest.

1017
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,120
Doc.

1018
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,000
It's all yours.

1019
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,360
Alright Mr Morlock, you are history.

1020
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,400
Come on,
let's get the hell out of here.

1021
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,320
I think we're gonna make it.

1022
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,120
It's finally over, isn't it?

1023
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,000
I really hope so.

1024
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,200
Now you can write a book
that isn't science fiction.

1025
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,880
Hi Danny. How are we tonight?

1026
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,680
Well, we'll try to make tonight
a little bit better.

1027
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,320
This will hurt just a little.

1028
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,920
Good. Doing better already.
