1
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:14,393
Remember Argyle Somerfield,
an old movie star?

2
00:01:15,294 --> 00:01:18,062
Eighty-three, according to this, an'
he's just had a baby with his nurse!

3
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:23,400
'"It was love at first sight", she
cooed, "I've always liked older men'".

4
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:27,236
God, if she ever ran into
Tutankhamen he wouldn't stand a chance!

5
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:31,173
She'd have his bandages off before
you can say "silicon implants".

6
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:34,843
There's some pictures of
them here with the new-born.

7
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:39,246
There's Argyle, and there's the baby.

8
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:46,085
No no no no, there's
Argyle, and there's the baby!

9
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:52,256
I was thrown for a minute by the bib and the
bonnet. Thought that was the baby at first!

10
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:07,402
An eighty-three year old
dad! How's that gonna work?

11
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:11,305
I bet he's not gonna get up in the middle
of the night to give the baby its feed.

12
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:13,240
Probably pretend to be dead!

13
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:21,313
"Darling, can you give the
baby his bottle tonight?"

14
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:27,251
It's not gonna work, is it?

15
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:30,254
The only advantage, as far as I can see,

16
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:33,256
is the wife can change both
their nappies at the same time.

17
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:46,266
Are you still not talking to me?
It's unbelievably childish, y' know.

18
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,405
I've a good mind to fill your
shoes with runny porridge again.

19
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,239
Teach you a lesson about maturity...

20
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:02,746
All right, I'll tell you
what: I bet I can make you

21
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:05,081
say something in the next... minute.

22
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,251
Twenty big ones. Shake on it...

23
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:14,255
All right, if I'm on, say nothing.

24
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:24,163
I'm on! Okay. I'm gonna say something, all
right, an' you're gonna totally lose it.

25
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,431
Are you ready? Y' ready?

26
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,271
Remember Yvonne McGruder?

27
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:39,275
You really liked her, didn't you?
I used to go out with her, y'know.

28
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:44,279
Before you did. You didn't know
that, did you? Broke up in the end.

29
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,284
Really hurt me. Still got the scars today.
They never heal, carpet burns, do they?

30
00:03:55,288 --> 00:04:01,260
Both cheeks, man! She nearly
wore them down to the bone!

31
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:07,264
Will you shut up!

32
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,267
What did I tell you? Twenty big ones!

33
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:14,270
I've been listening to you whittling
on now for what seems like two ice ages!

34
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:17,973
My mind is so numb
and brain-dead I feel

35
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:21,276
like I've just attended a three-day
seminar entitled "The Future of Plumbing".

36
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:26,280
Oh, at last you're talking
to me. I knew we'd make it up.

37
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,283
Eighty-three!

38
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:48,297
This thing's even bigger than I remember...

39
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,269
Errr, guyyys... we've got a problem..!

40
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:00,274
Hey guys! Look at my body!

41
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:03,276
There's an invitation that
will not cause a stampede.

42
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:04,277
No! It's back to normal.

43
00:05:05,278 --> 00:05:06,512
No time for that now, sir.

44
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:10,282
We're flying down a corridor on Red
Dwarf and Starbug appears to be expanding.

45
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:15,286
It's not Starbug that's expanding,
it's Red Dwarf that's shrinking!

46
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:18,221
It must be something to do with
the nanobot's molecular process.

47
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,289
Just like my body!

48
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,292
We're being sucked into a vent!

49
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:25,093
Can't fight it!

50
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:29,897
Air vent walls closing in.

51
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:33,267
We must take action. Be
bold, positive, decisive.

52
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,167
All right, dudes.

53
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,304
Anyone fancy a game of charades using
just your noses, or is this a bad time?

54
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,306
Holly, man, we're about
to get crushed to death!

55
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:43,308
So that's a 'no', then, is it?

56
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:47,278
Once the nano's rebuilt the ship, I thought
things were going to get back to normal!

57
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:51,014
We don't know where we are, what to do,
and haven't got a clue what's happening.

58
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:52,282
Things are back to normal!

59
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:54,617
Can't you get this crate to go faster?

60
00:05:55,117 --> 00:05:57,286
It's gonna be like getting crushed to
death under a gigantic trouser press!

61
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:03,257
Freshly laundered and wrinkle-free!
I always prayed I'd go out like that!

62
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,659
There may be a way through
this if we take a detour.

63
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:09,295
Past Epsilon 14 and take a right at the
hydro unit. We'll save about two minutes!

64
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:11,297
Epsilon 14.

65
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:17,402
There's... there's... there's
some kind of heartbeat up ahead,

66
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:19,303
and it's beating at an incredible rate!

67
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:24,307
You mean there's a heart out there with
no body? No wonder it's beating so fast.

68
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:29,311
Heyyy!

69
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:54,298
I hope we don't get stopped by the cops.
They don't like it when you're rat-arsed...

70
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:16,316
According to the desk
we've lost all engines!

71
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:20,319
Didn't I read somewhere that can
seriously affect your ability to fly?

72
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,426
Now we've lost the
mid-section and the kitchen!

73
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:33,296
I'm sorry everyone, but we may
have to have sandwiches for lunch!

74
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,303
Dave?

75
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,307
Selby! Chen! Is it really you?

76
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,309
Is it really us? Hang on, I'll check.

77
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,311
Yeah, I think it's us.

78
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:37,280
Guys! This is brilliant! I can't believe it!

79
00:08:39,315 --> 00:08:40,283
You know these people, sir?

80
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:44,586
Know them? When they've been drunk and
unconscious I've taken their clothes off

81
00:08:44,586 --> 00:08:46,254
and painted parts of them green!

82
00:08:46,288 --> 00:08:49,290
Course I know them! This is
the Red Dwarf crew, Krytie!

83
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:50,258
How?

84
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,293
The nano's must have resurrected
them along with the ship.

85
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:54,094
This is Chen.

86
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,430
He works in the kitchen
and he's always drunk,

87
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,299
and this is Selby, and he's
always drunk too! Where's Peterson?

88
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,301
He couldn't make it. He's drunk!

89
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:07,171
The crew are all alive,
sir! This is great news!

90
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,308
Wonderful, marvelous, incredible
news! All that extra ironing! Bliss!

91
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:19,281
Mister Thornton, read them their rights.

92
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:24,185
David Lister, you are formally charged
with stealing and crashing a Starbug.

93
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:26,887
You are also charged with
having no pilot's license,

94
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:28,788
and smuggling two stowaways on board,

95
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:31,290
along with Navigation
Officer Kristine Kochanski.

96
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:35,727
Anything you say now, or do not say now, may
be used at a board of enquiry against you.

97
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,295
Do you require any form of aid?

98
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:40,298
Yeah, lemonade in a really large scotch.

99
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,267
Left, right, left, right, left, right!

100
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:45,302
Try and relax! You're
gonna burst a blood vessel!

101
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:49,305
Shut up, you maggot! Do you
understand? Do you understand!?

102
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:51,306
"Yes -" what!?

103
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:53,308
"Yes, Mister... Shouty"..?

104
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:54,309
"YES - SIR"!

105
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,279
Left, right, left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right, left, right. Halt!

106
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,981
Lift arm.

107
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:05,284
At ease.

108
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:12,323
All right, dude.

109
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:16,927
They don't know about you yet, Holl.
It might be an idea to keep it that way.

110
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:21,631
I need some info. If the board of enquiry
find us guilty tomorrow, what happens then?

111
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:25,167
Well if you lose, you'll probably
get a couple of years in the brig.

112
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:26,134
What brig?

113
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,168
The brig on floor 13.

114
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,169
There isn't a floor 13!

115
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,172
Yeah, there is. It was classified.
A need-to-know only basis.

116
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,173
So who knew?

117
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:36,176
Well, all the officers, and anyone
who's ever seen the Twilight Zone.

118
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:40,179
So what's it like, this brig?

119
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,681
Well if I was an estate agent,

120
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:45,817
I'd probably describe it as an
old-style penal establishment,

121
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:49,219
abundant wildlife, two-hundred
bedrooms, all with ensuite buckets.

122
00:10:51,154 --> 00:10:52,155
Smeggin' hell.

123
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:54,457
They call it The Tank.

124
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:57,293
There was an inmate
population of four-hundred,

125
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:59,394
all being transported to Adelphi 12.

126
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:02,130
Presumably, they've all
been resurrected too.

127
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,799
What are they like? No don't
tell me, I already know.

128
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,234
They're all deranged,
hairy no-lobes with breath

129
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,335
like old nappies, arms
like toilet walls...

130
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,171
scum of the universe. They're
all like that, aren't they?

131
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,173
Well, the nice ones are, yeah.

132
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:20,177
Hang on, I've got one of them
on file somewhere. Here we go:

133
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,181
I'm Nigel. I'm nice!

134
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:30,786
See what I mean? They're
not all headbangers.

135
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,056
Nige is lovely, though he
does tend to get a bit narky

136
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:37,224
if you go too close
to him with a magnet.

137
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:43,163
Thanks very much Holl.
Y' really cheering me up.

138
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:46,165
The brig.

139
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:53,171
Two years..! Two years without curry
and lager! Two years without sex!

140
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,842
- You hope!
- Rimmer!

141
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:01,777
Word's out they're going to
throw the book at you, Listy!

142
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:03,846
Followed by the bookcase, and
then the library, brick by brick.

143
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:07,849
God, it's you like you used to be. Ughhh.

144
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,886
What got into you? You can't fly a
Starbug, meladdo! You're a technician!

145
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,887
A zero! A nobody!

146
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:19,592
This is gonna sound nuts, but the
whole crew died, including you!

147
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:22,828
And you've all been resurrected
by these microscopic little robots!

148
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:24,829
- I died?
- Yeah.

149
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:26,831
- All the crew died?
- Yeah.

150
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,999
And you're going to spend
the next two years in the brig

151
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,434
with a load of neanderthals
with badly spelled tattoos.

152
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:33,836
So where are we, is it my heaven?

153
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,740
Look, a radiation leak
wiped everybody out.

154
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,009
I survived because I was in stasis.

155
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:45,846
Then these nano's arrived... rebuilt
the ship, and resurrected the crew.

156
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:46,847
So where are they?

157
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:50,817
Dunno... gone, scarpered.
Maybe I should take the fifth?

158
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,886
The fifth? If I were you, I'd take
the sixth, seventh and eighth, too.

159
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:57,622
I've got to track down these
nano's, to corroborate our story.

160
00:12:57,622 --> 00:12:59,724
Otherwise, who's going
to believe our defence?

161
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:01,825
Only meths drinkers and
the corn circle society.

162
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:03,827
I need your help, man.

163
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:04,828
Me?

164
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:08,664
Who else is going to help
me? I'm confined to quarters.

165
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:11,300
The minute I walk though that door,

166
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,835
I get enough wattage up my jacksie
to light up the whole of Bootle!

167
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,571
Well, considering what the future
has in store for your jacksie,

168
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:19,840
a couple of zillion volts
is going to be easy street...

169
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,923
What's this rumour that we're three
million light years into Deep Space,

170
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,424
and Red Dwarf's changed shape?

171
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:47,429
That is classified information,
Karen! Who the hell told you that?

172
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:49,430
The coffee machine on G-deck.

173
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:54,434
That damn coffee machine. I'm gonna
bust his ass down to tampon dispenser!

174
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,436
Is it true?

175
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,173
Until we get Holly back
up, we can't verify it.

176
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,141
Starbug took out one of his CPU banks

177
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,410
in the crash and we're
having trouble rebooting.

178
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:09,780
The coffee machine said the ship's now
identical to its original design plans,

179
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,414
before the JMC made all its cutbacks?

180
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:15,484
We now have a quark-level
matter anti-matter generator,

181
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:19,421
ship-wide bio-organic computer
networking, and a karaoke bar on C-deck.

182
00:14:20,422 --> 00:14:23,424
But how? And how did we
wind up in Deep Space?

183
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:25,125
Nobody knows...

184
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:39,437
We don't believe this one's
human. Take a look at this:

185
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:43,407
Has he got the measles?

186
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,441
Those are his nipples, Frank.

187
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:50,446
Six nipples? I wonder what the
female of the species is like?

188
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:55,450
Pretty easy to please in bed!
Especially if you play the piano.

189
00:14:57,451 --> 00:14:59,420
His internal organs are different too.

190
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:00,387
In what way?

191
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,457
His kidney, liver, appendix,
are all colour co-ordinated.

192
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:09,428
And even weirder, his stomach
wall appears to be decorated.

193
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:12,430
This guy's intestines look
better than my quarters.

194
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:19,436
His heartbeat's weird too. Instead of a
normal heartbeat, his sounds... cooler...

195
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:24,473
You think I'm going to have
the dorky human heartbeat?

196
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:28,443
D dff, d dff, d dff, d dff.
Where's the tune in that?

197
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:30,444
Let me hear it.

198
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:40,419
Also, his pulse is a different rhythm.

199
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:52,429
Oh, that's good. Can you
slam that down on tape for me?

200
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:02,437
Rimmer, I'm begging you man: help me escape.
I've got to track down these nanobots.

201
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:06,440
I'm not risking my career and standing
for you, Listy. I'm going places!

202
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:08,441
"Up the ziggurat, lickety-split"...

203
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:12,445
Up the ziggurat, lickety-split, precisely!
I'm going to pass the engineering exam!

204
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:13,445
"And become an officer"...

205
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:18,416
And become an officer, yes! An officer.
A guy of honour, decency and breeding.

206
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:21,418
Are you saying I haven't
got those qualities?

207
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,556
Generally, people with breeding, when
they're bored and want my bridge club chums

208
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:29,458
to wrap up and go home, people with
breeding, generally, do not play

209
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,427
'Popeye the Sailor Man' with a kazoo
inserted between their buttocks.

210
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,433
I remember that! I used to do
that sort of thing, didn't I?

211
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,434
Don't expect help from me, Lister.

212
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,469
But that was years ago...

213
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,270
It was last week!

214
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,407
Last week for you, because you've just
been resurrected; years ago for me.

215
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,810
And anyway I was whirlitzered then.
I even finished off the advocar.

216
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:56,446
I even downed that smeg-awful pink stuff
down the back of the drinks cabinet.

217
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:03,452
That was my Windowlene... I must have left
it there when I was cleaning the glass.

218
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:07,455
It tasted all right with that
Chartruess green liqueurey thing.

219
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:13,460
You drank my Swarfega
too? You're unbelievable.

220
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:18,231
Look, I've changed, I'm different
now... more mature, more debonair.

221
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:22,434
I don't even stir my tea with a spanner
any more. You'd hardly recognise me.

222
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:23,468
Have you stopped playing the guitar?

223
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:27,571
No, but I've stopped
accompanying myself on the armpit.

224
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,441
What I'm trying to say is that I don't need
to take my frustrations out on you anymore.

225
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:33,443
How's that?

226
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:38,013
I've been away, what is it? Five,
six years, not counting stasis?

227
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:42,750
I've done stuff! Stuff that would make
your hair straight. I've come through it.

228
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:46,453
I can help you...

229
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:48,755
- Do what?
- Get promoted.

230
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:51,958
Preposterous!

231
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,459
How?

232
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,829
Information. I've seen the
crew's confidential reports.

233
00:17:57,829 --> 00:18:00,464
I've seen their strengths
and weaknesses...

234
00:18:01,465 --> 00:18:02,433
How?

235
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:05,468
Well before you were resurrected, I
had the run of the whole of the ship.

236
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:10,739
I've seen the crew's files, medical records,
sessions with the therapist, the works.

237
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:12,474
Knowledge is power. Who said that?

238
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:14,442
I don't know.

239
00:18:15,443 --> 00:18:20,847
Nor do I. The point I'm trying to make
is, I can make you look like a genius.

240
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:24,750
You can get promoted in the field,
man, you won't have to take exams,

241
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,453
or do that astro-engineering
smeg... Just, help me escape.

242
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:35,392
I have my principles, Lister. You think you
can buy me with promises of power and glory?

243
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:40,463
You really think... okay, I'll do it.
But you'll have to prove it to me first.

244
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:41,464
You're on.

245
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:44,466
- Get me promoted.
- You've got it.

246
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,467
Okay, deal.

247
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:49,404
You'll find the confidential
files in Starbug's cockpit.

248
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:53,473
There's a senile version of Holly loaded
into this watch. He'll lead you to it.

249
00:18:54,474 --> 00:19:00,012
Hello, I'm Doctor Lucas McLaren; I am
the ship's chief psychiatric counsellor,

250
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:03,481
and I thought it's about time we got
together, and had a really good natter.

251
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:05,483
My name is Kryten, sir.

252
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:13,456
Lovely! We are doing well, aren't
we! Now, you're a robot, aren't you?

253
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,459
I was, the last time I looked, sir, yes.

254
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:21,463
And can you tell me, when you
were created, can you remember?

255
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:22,463
2340, sir

256
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:28,468
Very good, 2340. Now, that's
in the future, isn't it?

257
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,437
Yes sir, I was created after you died.

258
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:37,842
Lovely! Lovely! So, I died,
er, and you were created.

259
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,478
And how long would you say
I've been dead, altogether?

260
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:42,479
Oh, you're not dead any more, sir.

261
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:43,480
Aren't I?

262
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:47,483
No no, you're alive again
now, sir. Can't you tell?

263
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:52,487
Right! I was alive, died, and
then started living again..?

264
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:54,456
You have been most fortunate sir!

265
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,494
I have, haven't I? Golly! Your chair
is screwed down, isn't it, Kryten?

266
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:04,497
Er, yes, sir?

267
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:08,233
Just checking!
Excellent, lovely, lovely!

268
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:11,469
So, how did I suddenly
spring back to life again?

269
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:15,472
You were rebuilt, sir, by these itty-bitty,
teeny-weeny, teenty little robots!

270
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:17,441
'Teenty little robots'?

271
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:21,477
And they make this little noise,
'miniminiminiminiminiminiminiminimini'!

272
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:25,614
Yes, just double check that
chair for me, would you, Kryten?

273
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:27,482
It is still screwed down, isn't it?

274
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:31,485
With really long, long screws
that go deep, deep into the ground?

275
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,486
Er, yes, sir.

276
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:37,390
Okay, now tell me, what kind
of robot do you think you are?

277
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,458
What were you programmed to do?

278
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:41,160
Oh well, I'm a sanitation droid, sir.

279
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,496
I'm programmed to do sanitation-type
things: washing, cleaning, ironing.

280
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,965
Hmm. You also drive
spaceships though, don't you?

281
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:51,635
Pretend to be the science officer,
and sit in that lovely, swivelly chair,

282
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:54,470
with all those lovely, pretty
buttons and press them all?

283
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:57,473
Yes, I do that too, sir. That's
sort of thanks to Mister Lister.

284
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,473
Mister Lister..?

285
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,076
He helped break my programming, sir.

286
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:02,810
Over the years I have managed to develop

287
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,479
some serious character faults
of which I'm extremely proud!

288
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,416
I'm even able to lie
to a modest standard,

289
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,485
for example: "you have
a very fine hair cut!"

290
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:18,056
You see how good I've got?

291
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:22,493
Also, "I've completely mastered
pomposity, even though I say so myself!"

292
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:28,731
I've also developed several
rudimentary emotions, including fear:

293
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:33,468
"Oh my God! It's going to kill us!";
sadness: "Oh my God, it's killed us";

294
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:41,475
happiness: "oh no it hasn't!"; surprise:
"Oohh! I've turned into a frog!",

295
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:45,645
and just lately, I'm proud to
say, I've got the hang of anger,

296
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:47,479
with rudimentary mindless violence:

297
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:55,886
That's a newie. I was going to
launch it at this year's Emotion Show.

298
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:59,789
At the moment, I'm
working on ambivalence

299
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,324
which means feeling two opposite,

300
00:22:01,324 --> 00:22:03,559
irreconcilable emotions
about the same thing:

301
00:22:08,563 --> 00:22:11,565
As you can see, I haven't quite
got the hang of that one yet.

302
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,500
I look like a dog with a caramel toffee.

303
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,506
What is your relationship with Lister?

304
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,441
I love Mister Lister, sir,
he taught me everything.

305
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:25,510
Without him, I'd probably be normal.

306
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:32,182
I'm going to make a recommendation now,
Kryten, which I think will help you,

307
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:35,518
but just before I do, just double
check that chair for me, would you?

308
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:51,564
Yes!

309
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,504
Luck virus; sexual magnetism?

310
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,505
Holly, what's this?

311
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,109
Dave got them years ago from
this scientist called Lanstrom.

312
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:07,577
They're positive viruses.

313
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:11,246
One gives you sexual magnetism,
and the other gives you luck.

314
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:14,516
Well, 'til your natural body
defences combat the virus.

315
00:23:15,516 --> 00:23:16,517
Sexual magnetism!

316
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,486
You gonna use it?

317
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:22,589
Is Paris a kind of
plaster? You bet I am!

318
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:26,559
A tiny swigette to see if
it works. Well, bottoms up!

319
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:30,562
Then bottoms down, and
hopefully bottoms up again!

320
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,505
Hi, Arn...

321
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,508
Ladies!

322
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,509
Hi, Arnold...

323
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,511
The world loves a bastard!
