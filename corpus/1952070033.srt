1
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:37,759
The following is based
on true events.

2
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,865
I swear by God this sacred oath:

3
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:04,417
I am unconditionally obedient,
to Adolf Hitler,

4
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:07,449
Führer of the German Empire
and its people,

5
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:10,245
Chief
of the armed forces.

6
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:13,237
I am ready any time,
as a good soldier,

7
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:18,199
My life for this oath.

8
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,432
The promises of the Führer about
peace and prosperity are destroyed

9
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,432
and left nothin but destruction.

10
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,432
The nastiness Hitler broughed with his SS
are a shame to the German army.

11
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,232
In the officers choir
there is widespread disgust,

12
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,536
about the bad things the Nazis did.

13
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,632
The killing of civilians,

14
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:22,618
The torture and starving
of prisoners.

15
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:26,319
The mass execution of Jews.

16
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:31,084
My job as an officer,
is no longer to save my country,

17
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,682
but to save lives.

18
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:40,022
I think no general with the courage,
to have to confront Hitler.

19
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,078
Von Stauffenberg, sir,
the General is coming.

20
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,740
Thank you I want him to speak
once he has arrived.

21
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:55,142
I was surrounded with people,
who wanted to see the truth.

22
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:58,923
Hiltler is not only the arch-enemy,
of the whole world,

23
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,876
but the arch-enemy of Germany.

24
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:06,680
This must change.

25
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:13,492
Colonel, my orders are to tear
to Sidi Mansour and we do.

26
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,169
The British are coming from the south
Patton and approaching from the coast,

27
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:20,461
know that we have two days.
- No, Colonel, we continue to fight.

28
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:22,391
Until the final victory.

29
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:26,092
That is a big lie
and you know too.

30
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,581
We can Germany,
or Füher, not both simultaneously.

31
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:35,542
With that kind of statements,
you are sent through colonel.

32
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:37,747
What I said was much worse.

33
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,252
General.

34
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,977
I try only to these men
live here to get.

35
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:55,506
What do you want me to do?

36
00:03:55,782 --> 00:04:00,389
Do the headquarters to the proposal for a
other route, with the 1st Panzer unit.

37
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,263
Then we at least have a chance.

38
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:07,791
And from the reports will show
Sidi Mansour that you will achieve?

39
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:09,996
That I guarantee.

40
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:21,022
Let's see what it is.

41
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,463
General.

42
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:06,568
Sit.

43
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:27,674
Hitler departs quickly.
- Yes, the igniter.

44
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:02,718
Colonel Brandt.

45
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:06,577
A gift for Colonel Stieff.

46
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:13,192
Thank you,
so we do not get thirsty on the way.

47
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:51,151
He has landed.

48
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:02,176
With General Tresckow, give me operations,
Colonel Brandt.

49
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,704
Colonel, in Tresckow.

50
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:08,870
I am glad you are safely arrived.

51
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:11,666
I'm sorry you hard to be covered
but you got the wrong bottle

52
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,438
for Colonel Stief.

53
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:16,273
Did you pack yet?

54
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:26,156
No, but I is expected in Berlin,
I'll fetch you in the morning.

55
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:29,700
Sorry for the inconvenience colonel.
Yes, thank you

56
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,992
Do you think that he has it?

57
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:37,575
There is only one way,
to find out.

58
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,672
We detected.
- Why do you think?

59
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:54,428
Oster is arrested
the Gestapo came to retrieve him.

60
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:56,397
The Gestapo, he may for all
and some have been arrested.

61
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:59,390
What's wrong?
- No idea.

62
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:04,115
The ignition temperature,
know, that thing has not exploded.

63
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,479
General Tresckow,
for Colonel Brandt.

64
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:18,487
The colonel expects you, sir.

65
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,024
Rust.

66
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,042
Sorry General, I have the whole day
write reports on a raid.

67
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:45,932
A raid?

68
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:50,421
Dissidents.
- Another conspiracy against the Führer.

69
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,020
Who are these people?

70
00:11:55,697 --> 00:11:57,509
You would be stunned.

71
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:05,896
Is this where you come?

72
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,346
Maybe we should make it open.

73
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,630
Pardon?

74
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,552
You have a long trip,
you must be thirsty.

75
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:33,892
I do not know what the Führer thinks,
of a soldier who drink during his service.

76
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,752
Colonel Brandt.

77
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:46,650
I had you otherwise assessed, General.

78
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,233
And I am

79
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,786
We are still in business.

80
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:03,149
Search for Replacement Oster.

81
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:05,236
Here you can trust no one,
not in Berlin.

82
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:07,953
Stop searching in Berlin.

83
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:35,516
Frau von Stauffenberg.

84
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:39,887
Maybe we can first
talk in my office.

85
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,052
I go to my husband.

86
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:52,054
His right hand,
is amputated above the wrist.

87
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,046
He lacks the fourth and fifth finger
of his left hand.

88
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:58,000
And the left eye,
we could not survive.

89
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,040
Colonel.

90
00:14:57,891 --> 00:14:59,308
Are you ready, sir?

91
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,819
I am a soldier, I serve my country.

92
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:46,323
But this is my country.

93
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,198
I was there, while I bled to death
and thought,

94
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:53,371
if I die,
I let my children nothing after.

95
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:59,750
I must find another way,
to Germany to serve.

96
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:03,924
If I do,
I am a traitor,

97
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,011
I accept that.

98
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,618
Tell me,
these men see it as?

99
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:16,131
We need to reorganize,
rethink our strategy,

100
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:18,100
recruit new men.

101
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,092
We want you

102
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:28,259
What happens to my wife and children,
if these men not see?

103
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:34,598
Come listen
what they have to say.

104
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,537
You know where you can find us.

105
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,487
Enough. I do not listen anymore.
You had your chance and you failed.

106
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:23,425
Your solution, failed.

107
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,023
The only way now,
Hilter to directly confront.

108
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,874
This is a military operation.

109
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,315
It is not a military operation,
it is a political organization,

110
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:32,914
and what happened,
is that the military too much power.

111
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,513
We must still consider,
with some errors.

112
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:39,136
Mistakes?
How about a complete fiasco?

113
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:41,498
Gentlemen, we have the facts
face.

114
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:45,633
The allies will come sooner or later,
I say, let's wait

115
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,326
and let them deal with the Nazis.

116
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:50,200
And every living soul in Europe,
the price to pay? Use your head.

117
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,823
Carl, please.
- Ludwig Sorry, I love me too long silent.

118
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,012
We must now confront Hitler.
Forcing him to leave.

119
00:17:57,249 --> 00:17:58,509
And then what?

120
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:01,816
Pardon?

121
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:04,848
If Hilter away.

122
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,573
Excuse me, who is this?

123
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:12,212
Colonel Stauffenberg,
is the replacement for Oster.

124
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:15,283
He was transferred to my office,
the Ministry of War.

125
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:20,166
How is your uncle?
- Well sir, he do for me.

126
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:23,316
He speaks with praise for you
- About you, General.

127
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:28,238
What Oster good organizer made,
that his opinion is held.

128
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,002
I ask simply, what you do
as Hitler away.

129
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,625
You do not believe that you Reichskanzelarei
can walk,

130
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:38,869
the military orders,
the war to end?

131
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,759
Yes, we believe it.

132
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:49,343
You were close to these men,
from Hitler's immediate vicinity.

133
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:52,415
We refused that, colonel.

134
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:55,604
The people know that our principles,
top private places.

135
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,006
We have respect for people

136
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,660
and the army.

137
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:03,440
Then you do not need.

138
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:07,220
Gentlemen.

139
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:12,142
They confuse respect,
in popularity.

140
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:16,670
They have sworn an oath,
forget that they just do not.

141
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,608
What will you do with Goebbels,
Himmler and the SS?

142
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:22,774
They will delete you.
- Stauffenberg.

143
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:29,704
We must now do something,
before we lose the war.

144
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:34,271
Otherwise, it always
Hitler's Germany remain.

145
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,375
We must show the world,
that we can not all be like him.

146
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,580
That is not enough for me.

147
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:46,557
There should be a chance of success.

148
00:19:47,738 --> 00:19:49,589
Then find a way.

149
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,534
Papa is home.

150
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:11,521
I thought we would see each other
in Bamberg.

151
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:13,844
The children could not wait.

152
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:16,128
The children?

153
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:40,284
Valkyrie.

154
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:42,332
We have already considered,
it is not appropriate.

155
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:45,403
I know, but the Colonel has an idea,
that we have to take.

156
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:48,829
Sorry, what is Valkyrie?
- Operation Valkyrie.

157
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:51,782
The reserve army of thousands of men,
all over Berlin.

158
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:56,664
Valkyrie is Hitler's plan, they are
mobilized by a national catastrophe.

159
00:22:56,901 --> 00:23:00,484
With the aim of his government to protect
cut or if he is slain.

160
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,335
And what have we there?

161
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:05,603
Valkyrie is designed
Civil unrest.

162
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:09,147
But what if the SS consult a coup?

163
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,746
The security service would overthrow Hitler,
how will the highest command respond?

164
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:19,188
We, the military emergency
should cry.

165
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:23,598
Just start and Valkyrie.
- Hitler's reserve army against Hitler's own plan.

166
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,354
We have no other option
than the power in Berlin,

167
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:28,953
to prevent
that the SS is in power.

168
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:33,087
They think Hilter for government to fight
instead of against it.

169
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:36,474
While we quietly
a new government installed.

170
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:39,348
But only if he is dead.

171
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:41,829
That mean you right?

172
00:23:42,065 --> 00:23:45,136
How do you convince people,
that the SS would seize power?

173
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:49,350
We must kill Hitler.
- I'm disappointed in you, colonel.

174
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:53,130
I thought that someone of your background,
a more honorable approach would choose.

175
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:56,831
Your plan includes a few obstacles colonel.

176
00:23:57,264 --> 00:24:00,099
Valkyrie should be rewritten,
the SS off.

177
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:03,013
And I need your help,
to copy it.

178
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,848
A warrant rewriting is one thing.

179
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,431
The spread is something else.

180
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:14,393
In this case we disseminate evidence
high treason.

181
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:16,834
Proof that Hitler's signature required.

182
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,749
We can all his signature.

183
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:28,489
How about the Fromm?
- Who is Fromm?

184
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:30,025
The commander of the reserve army.

185
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:34,042
I can troops in reserve to preparedness,
only Fromm, Valkyrie can start.

186
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:39,436
Can you approach him?

187
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:45,146
Our time is running out,
Fromm you approach?

188
00:24:45,461 --> 00:24:46,996
He is a carrièreman.

189
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:49,083
But how far is he willing to go
with Hitler's army?

190
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,367
It is no secret,
that he is not happy with it.

191
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:54,123
Offers him a key position
in the new government.

192
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,880
Let him see the light.

193
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,473
Colonel Stauffenberg,
for General Fromm.

194
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:16,961
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. Welcome back.
It is an honor, sir.

195
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:23,577
I send you to the front,
for you to give as Montgomery's whore.

196
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:30,940
The General will now receive.

197
00:25:44,997 --> 00:25:46,848
What do you want?

198
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:51,416
I wish our new husband.
Colonel Stauffenberg.

199
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:54,684
Right, from Africa.

200
00:25:55,432 --> 00:26:00,078
I would like to give you my hand,
but I might not get him back.

201
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:03,661
I would say that the General has important
Cases lost this morning.

202
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,466
It was time that someone
with balls placed in this office.

203
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:17,601
Please sit, Colonel.
And you too, Olbricht, and certainly should.

204
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:33,981
They say that you are critical about the war,
you seem to have good reasons.

205
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:36,226
I am critical
certain decisions, General.

206
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,116
In the field?
- In Berlin.

207
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:43,195
So why are you here to ...

208
00:26:43,431 --> 00:26:46,148
to make decisions.
I have my decision already taken.

209
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:48,826
I'm here to help others,
in taking their decisions.

210
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:58,512
They say that if there is no clear option,
it is best to do nothing.

211
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:01,781
We have war, we must do something.

212
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:03,986
Sometimes rational.

213
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:08,593
What rational action
you are a colonel?

214
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:15,287
That would be a decision,
of a chief, sir.

215
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:18,397
The chief?

216
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:22,650
The two men behind the Chancellor.

217
00:27:27,651 --> 00:27:29,935
If I was that man ...

218
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:34,305
would this war are very different.

219
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:37,062
That thought so too.

220
00:27:45,882 --> 00:27:56,316
I need you not to remember
that we have taken oath to the Führer.

221
00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:06,987
That said,
I will call not made to consider

222
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:09,704
that means that the types of calls,

223
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:12,579
never more will take place.
Is that clear?

224
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:17,186
Tell your friends colonel
I always choose the right side.

225
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:22,620
And as long as the Führer lives
you know where that is.

226
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,158
You realize,
Hitler how close I am?

227
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:35,072
I can keep them away.

228
00:29:36,253 --> 00:29:38,655
My partners do not know that we talk
if you are afraid of.

229
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:42,789
If you get the SS,
you get them apart.

230
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:45,625
It would be a crime,
you know it.

231
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,507
I warn you,
Take no more contact.

232
00:29:50,704 --> 00:29:56,414
When I first approached,
had you on your oath to keep.

233
00:29:56,571 --> 00:30:00,666
Now you're just as guilty as me.
- And why am I a sympathizer?

234
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:03,423
Ask a man his fellow officers
and the Führer to betray,

235
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,667
and you believe that his actions
I will show its true?

236
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:08,581
If it is not easy.
- Yes it is.

237
00:30:08,856 --> 00:30:12,046
For the last time,
compelling me to take a decision.

238
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:14,172
I have no choice.

239
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:19,409
Without you, there is no hope of success.

240
00:30:20,315 --> 00:30:22,520
You are like rats,
which leave a sinking ship,

241
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:25,001
why do you think,
otherwise you will be?

242
00:30:25,276 --> 00:30:26,733
Why do you
you are stronger than the people,

243
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:31,813
now, at this moment in history.
- This will continue an action is inevitable,

244
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:33,506
as the consequences.

245
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:38,585
If they get me, I will do everything
to hide me, hold not kid yourself,

246
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:42,641
you did to this crime,
long before you met me.

247
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:47,091
There is still time for something to do.

248
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,839
Only God can judge you.

249
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:04,062
Hitler designed operation Valkyrie,
within six hours of his government to secure.

250
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:07,802
I Rewrite the orders, so we
the government can take over in three hours.

251
00:31:08,393 --> 00:31:12,331
The orders are distributed
on all 19 German military districts.

252
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:16,859
including occupied cities,
such as Paris, Vienna and Prague.

253
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:19,655
Here are the main sources
because all these districts,

254
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:25,443
strictly follow orders from Berlin.
If you take Berlin, please Germany.

255
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,467
I Rewrite so that the strongest units,
fully focus on Berlin.

256
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:35,169
We surround the government buildings,
manage the S.S. and gray shirts.

257
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:39,776
If the government hands,
Close all the concentration camps.

258
00:31:40,012 --> 00:31:42,493
Officers who refuse
be arrested.

259
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:45,722
I am transferred to the front.

260
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:52,101
It does not matter.
You know this better than anyone recommend.

261
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,251
Therefore I give you,
the command of the operation.

262
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:58,676
Beck agrees.
- Why not Olbricht?

263
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:01,984
No, it is your plan.
You're it.

264
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,827
Make sure that no
conflicting orders are issued.

265
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:08,599
Hitler dead, is not enough.

266
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:13,403
You should isolate its command structure
and direct closure of the outside world.

267
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,529
It is thought.

268
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,191
I have the right man to help.
- Who is that?

269
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,341
Maybe I better not tell.

270
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:28,957
God promised to Abraham,
that he would not destroy Sodom,

271
00:32:29,193 --> 00:32:31,319
when ten
righteous men could find.

272
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:36,162
I have the feeling,
that Germany is a need.

273
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,368
Let us begin.

274
00:32:43,998 --> 00:32:47,542
The Führer, Adolf Hitler,

275
00:32:49,826 --> 00:32:51,558
is dead.

276
00:32:57,898 --> 00:32:59,434
Heil Hiltler, General.

277
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:04,198
Would you excuse us?

278
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:17,074
You play a good bureaucrat.
- I hope so.

279
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,854
You are encouraged,
to chief of staff of the reserve army.

280
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,910
Pardon?
- Congratulations.

281
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:28,257
I am with other issues.

282
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:32,195
Unfortunately, your action has not
the merit of the 'Reich'.

283
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:35,069
I refuse.
- You can not do.

284
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:39,794
Tresckow you exercise leadership made
but I am higher in rank,

285
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,920
you accept that promotion.

286
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:46,252
You'll have access to Hitler,
his advisers, his agenda.

287
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:48,024
We need him to.

288
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:52,828
I have your changes in Valkyrie views.

289
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:57,592
I agree.
You must be signed Hitler.

290
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,971
There is a man,
that is your job as assistant.

291
00:34:04,207 --> 00:34:06,176
It is highly recommended.

292
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:14,288
Close the door.

293
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,525
Sit down.

294
00:34:23,305 --> 00:34:26,100
Do you know how the world
to its end, Lieutenant?

295
00:34:26,337 --> 00:34:32,007
This portrait is removed,
and that man will be prosecuted.

296
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,756
I love me busy with high treason,
with all the resources but are available.

297
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:44,568
Do you?

298
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:54,609
In all, sir. With anything.

299
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,067
Come children.

300
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:03,084
Colonel Brandt, operations.

301
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,943
Colonel Stauffenberg, I want your presentation
the Führer gladly take.

302
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,463
That is normal.

303
00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:11,904
Sir, the contents of the folder
are only intended for the Führer eyes.

304
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,991
I am the eyes of the Führer, Lieutenant.

305
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:17,928
The colonel is my staff at the Ministry
of war, he is not among you

306
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:21,236
They wait.

307
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:23,599
Along here.

308
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:03,723
My Führer, I present Colonel Stauffenberg,
our new chief of staff of the reserve army.

309
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:06,164
My Führer.

310
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:18,961
It is an honor for an officer to meet
which so many sacrifices made for Germany.

311
00:37:24,553 --> 00:37:27,034
Waren but my men like you

312
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:34,239
Leave him an example for you.
He is the epitome of a German officer.

313
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,468
My Führer ...

314
00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:40,973
Colonel Stauffenberg will inform us,
the mobilization

315
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:45,501
of the reserve army,
to drive back the invasion.

316
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:48,966
Invasion?

317
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,982
In Normandy, my Führer.

318
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,739
Right.

319
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,692
Normandy.

320
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:01,566
That will not be necessary.

321
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:07,315
Reich Marshall Göring, assures me,
that everything is under control.

322
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,292
Thank you Colonel.

323
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:21,569
My Führer, if I may, I have a copy
of Operation Valkyrie, for approval.

324
00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:13,625
You know your Wagner colonel?

325
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:23,351
The Valkyrie, the help of the gods.

326
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:26,304
Those who decide on who will live
and who will die.

327
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:32,249
The most heroic save,
a painful death.

328
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:40,361
One can not understand socialism,

329
00:39:42,094 --> 00:39:44,417
if Wagner does not understand.

330
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,672
I am sure,
that your changes are good.

331
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:12,019
You can go.
Send your men to the front.

332
00:40:12,295 --> 00:40:14,815
If a fresh team, yes?

333
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:28,951
I do not know and would not know
what you are doing.

334
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:34,818
But when the music stops,
I no cent for those without a seat.

335
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:49,505
Every problem on this planet,
can be solved,

336
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,734
with a proper application
of explosives.

337
00:40:53,246 --> 00:40:55,727
The only thing not in the neighborhood are
if they go off.

338
00:40:56,357 --> 00:41:01,436
2 slices 975 grams of plastic explosives,
enough to cripple a tank.

339
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,484
The inflammation.

340
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:05,768
British ball points.

341
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,737
This acid capsule is the igniter.

342
00:41:07,973 --> 00:41:11,989
You put everything in focus by the igniter
the ball to confirm.

343
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,564
So.

344
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,384
Put the ball in the explosive.

345
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,573
Break the acid capsule

346
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:22,739
and he is on edge.

347
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:29,905
If the wire in the acid dissolves the igniter,
you better nearby.

348
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:36,205
For you
- How much time do we have?

349
00:41:36,402 --> 00:41:38,765
Theoretically, about 30 minutes,
but given the heat,

350
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:42,348
Wolves in the gap you need to rely on,
10 up to 15 minutes.

351
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,199
That is not very accurate.

352
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,940
This is the latest, you can small
or accurate will not both.

353
00:41:48,176 --> 00:41:50,145
Maybe a little too small.

354
00:41:51,129 --> 00:41:52,940
Hitler bunker strengthened the explosion.

355
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,760
It reinforced concrete,
with steel doors and without windows.

356
00:41:56,996 --> 00:42:00,461
The pressure built
by an explosion in such a space,

357
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:04,399
everyone will get killed.
The second charge is unnecessary.

358
00:42:04,596 --> 00:42:07,588
What do we as Hitler
by a miracle survive?

359
00:42:08,415 --> 00:42:12,943
That we still Valkyrie export.
At that moment, we can not go back.

360
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,558
But we have an advantage.

361
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,983
We have an insider.

362
00:42:18,692 --> 00:42:21,409
After the explosion, he breaks
communication with the outside world.

363
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:23,614
While Hitler's confidants will
struggling with regrouping,

364
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,725
we have the time,
to the control to take over in Berlin.

365
00:42:28,497 --> 00:42:31,529
Himmler is also expected
do not

366
00:42:31,804 --> 00:42:33,419
unless you can address them both.

367
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:38,577
Do not unless you both,
both Hitler and Himmler can address.

368
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:47,279
This is Goerdeler work, huh?

369
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:52,438
I do not

370
00:42:52,674 --> 00:42:55,824
if the decision is unanimous,
but I want an additional member of the team.

371
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:58,895
And no politician.
- Who?

372
00:42:59,092 --> 00:43:00,392
Him.

373
00:43:03,817 --> 00:43:05,117
Well.

374
00:43:05,944 --> 00:43:09,566
But remember,
this is a military operation.

375
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:12,204
Everything goes according to plan.

376
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:43,469
We bring the children to Bamberg.

377
00:43:50,163 --> 00:43:51,423
If I fail ...

378
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,266
Do they get you.

379
00:43:58,432 --> 00:43:59,928
All of you.

380
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:04,771
I know.

381
00:44:30,484 --> 00:44:32,098
Gentlemen, good morning.

382
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:35,603
Hitler has scheduled an emergency meeting,
today for an hour.

383
00:44:36,194 --> 00:44:39,541
Stauffenberg begins when everyone is present.
- They are.

384
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:43,754
For the calk will Stauffenberg
call for authorization.

385
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:48,124
After the explosion, will his inside man
Disconnect all communication.

386
00:44:48,755 --> 00:44:52,456
If Fromm does not participate,
Olbricht will command

387
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:55,212
the reserve army to take over
Valkyrie and launch.

388
00:44:55,448 --> 00:44:59,622
That tells you all district commanders,
that the SS want to take power.

389
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:03,836
The reserve army will all SS, Gestapo,
and Nazi leaders arrested.

390
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:08,246
By that time, Stauffenberg returned to Berlin
and take over the reserve army.

391
00:45:08,797 --> 00:45:11,593
Witzleben and I take the role of
supreme commander,

392
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:13,443
and on state.

393
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,011
With a secured Berlin Dr. Goerdeler,
the people speak as new Chancellor.

394
00:45:18,444 --> 00:45:22,264
With God's help ... can we go on peace
negotiate with the Allies

395
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,296
and Europe,
prevent a complete destruction.

396
00:45:27,264 --> 00:45:33,840
This identifies you as a member of the operation,
nobody is without inwards.

397
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:36,242
Gentlemen.

398
00:45:36,872 --> 00:45:39,471
This is the most important day,
of your life.

399
00:45:41,637 --> 00:45:43,842
We are fighting for Germany.

400
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:22,942
What is it?
- A command of General Olbricht.

401
00:46:23,218 --> 00:46:28,297
The reserve army in preparedness come
in all districts, including Berlin.

402
00:46:29,242 --> 00:46:32,707
It will be an exercise.
Send more.

403
00:46:57,593 --> 00:47:03,106
Preparedness Action, why?
- It's not.

404
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:05,547
Let the men taking.

405
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:08,106
Please let this one exercise.

406
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:47,452
The men took
and waiting for orders.

407
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:50,721
This is rather strange.

408
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,982
HITLER'S shelter.
Station.

409
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,462
You may pass.

410
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:08,301
Your husband?

411
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,586
Now.

412
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:38,590
Colonel.

413
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,427
Attention.

414
00:53:02,964 --> 00:53:05,956
Gentlemen, the first item.

415
00:53:06,193 --> 00:53:10,170
General Fromm will present plans,
for moving troops,

416
00:53:10,642 --> 00:53:12,453
of the reserve army,
to the Eastern front.

417
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:16,942
As you know, the Russians
Army Group North Ukraine attacked,

418
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:19,029
in Poland's southern sector.

419
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:24,896
General Harmel Model has replaced
an end to this confrontation.

420
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:28,204
Himmler was not there.
- I have three divisions,

421
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,693
Harmel troops to reinforce.

422
00:53:32,929 --> 00:53:37,182
These divisions are,
to a mobile defense plan

423
00:53:37,457 --> 00:53:40,568
and are not used,
at a certain fixed position.

424
00:53:48,286 --> 00:53:51,003
Give me the ministry of war,
the office of General Olbricht.

425
00:53:57,027 --> 00:53:59,114
General Olbrichts office.
- Himmler is not at the meeting,

426
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,847
I call for approval,
to continue.

427
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,343
A moment.

428
00:54:02,737 --> 00:54:06,281
Stauffenberg said Himmler is not there,
he wants to continue.

429
00:54:06,517 --> 00:54:07,777
Call Beck.

430
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,408
Himmler was not there.

431
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,939
They say no.

432
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,113
What do you think?

433
00:54:47,074 --> 00:54:48,452
I say continue.

434
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:28,143
You are a little lost, Colonel.
I hope that it was important.

435
00:55:29,915 --> 00:55:32,396
Colonel, your bag.

436
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:59,290
This was an exercise, Dismissed.

437
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:05,944
How dare you reserve army in preparedness
it, without that I know?

438
00:56:06,141 --> 00:56:07,520
That cost me my commission.

439
00:56:07,716 --> 00:56:10,276
In God's name,
why do you think you have that power?

440
00:56:10,552 --> 00:56:13,308
It was just an exercise.
- Don 't lie to me.

441
00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:17,639
We both know that it was not a drill.
- General, if I may ...

442
00:56:17,915 --> 00:56:20,789
No, Colonel, you can do nothing.

443
00:56:21,026 --> 00:56:24,845
You are not only incompetent,
you made me a target.

444
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:29,413
If I even feel,
that you have the reserve army to do

445
00:56:29,649 --> 00:56:31,696
I arrest you both.

446
00:56:34,295 --> 00:56:37,091
I have expressed myself clearly enough?

447
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:49,416
I did not hear you say, Colonel.

448
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:12,884
The need to replace Hitler,
the peace negotiations.

449
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:15,404
I had hoped that the Allies
were prepared to negotiate,

450
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,200
before them, damn, Berlin reach.

451
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:21,350
Hitler did not kill sentence
if you do not kill Himmler.

452
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:24,264
Why remove a crazy,
if we have a crazy back.

453
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,784
This has nothing to do with this
and that you know

454
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:30,091
This is a military operation
and not political, nothing more.

455
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,808
What you suggest?
- I suggest nothing.

456
00:57:33,044 --> 00:57:34,738
I mention the facts as I see them.

457
00:57:35,013 --> 00:57:37,612
You have the courage not to kill Hitler.
So make the mission impossible.

458
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:39,345
Nothing seems to murder you and your command
to stop

459
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,810
to hand to do.
- I wish that you would be right back again.

460
00:57:43,007 --> 00:57:45,920
I think I am not alone
if I gave your review in question.

461
00:57:46,117 --> 00:57:47,810
I suggest to vote.

462
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:52,299
I propose that we Colonel Stauffenberg
relieve of his duties.

463
00:57:52,929 --> 00:57:57,654
Carl, I can even speak in private?
- If you just want to say, say it.

464
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,553
Okay.
I heard the chief of police,

465
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,191
Himmler that you want to arrest.

466
00:58:07,302 --> 00:58:09,231
You should have left Germany last night.

467
00:58:09,664 --> 00:58:15,137
If we are successful,
get back as Chancellor.

468
00:58:15,374 --> 00:58:19,666
Disappearing Carl
and you avoid any contact.

469
00:58:33,487 --> 00:58:34,825
Good luck, Colonel.

470
00:58:41,716 --> 00:58:45,890
From now on,
Stauffenberg has all powers of attorney.

471
00:58:46,126 --> 00:58:48,725
I can not approach the Allies,
if we do not continue.

472
00:58:48,962 --> 00:58:52,466
I accomplish my task,
take Berlin.

473
00:58:59,593 --> 00:59:03,058
I can now connect.
- Thank you

474
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:17,076
Excuse me sir, there were bombs
in Emmingen, we paused.

475
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:22,510
Emmingen is not in that environment.
I am sure that your family is safe.

476
01:00:58,194 --> 01:01:01,816
Welcome colonel.
- Can I change something, Major?

477
01:01:03,352 --> 01:01:04,809
Come on.

478
01:01:11,936 --> 01:01:15,204
Make it the reserve army in preparedness
- Not before I'm called by Stauffenberg.

479
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:16,976
Not before I have security.
- That is ...

480
01:01:17,212 --> 01:01:19,142
No Colonel, thank you

481
01:01:30,837 --> 01:01:33,278
The meeting,
is delayed until 12:30.

482
01:01:33,514 --> 01:01:38,397
Mussolini comes this afternoon by train.
The Füher want to wait.

483
01:01:38,672 --> 01:01:40,641
Will Mussolini to the meeting, sir?

484
01:01:41,862 --> 01:01:44,539
This was only true
than was an ambitious officer

485
01:01:44,776 --> 01:01:47,847
the opportunity,
for that bastard to pop.

486
01:01:49,698 --> 01:01:54,423
Sorry General. I expect a call
do you want me to get

487
01:01:54,659 --> 01:01:56,234
even though I am in the Führer.

488
01:01:57,179 --> 01:01:59,817
But of course, Colonel.
- Thank you sir.

489
01:02:00,172 --> 01:02:02,219
Colonel.

490
01:02:34,114 --> 01:02:35,728
With Major Freyend.

491
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:46,793
Colonel.

492
01:02:47,462 --> 01:02:49,116
They want you to make.

493
01:02:49,431 --> 01:02:53,015
The meeting begins.
- One moment, Major.

494
01:02:59,669 --> 01:03:04,512
Two minutes, two for the welcome,
one for the checkpoint.

495
01:03:04,788 --> 01:03:06,284
Time enough.

496
01:03:10,261 --> 01:03:11,561
Sorry, Colonel.

497
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:16,522
Sir, the Führer is already in the meeting.

498
01:03:21,956 --> 01:03:24,122
The dresses to Colonel, Major.

499
01:03:27,823 --> 01:03:31,327
This is tricky, with his disability.
- Sure.

500
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,354
Time enough.

501
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,200
Get the car.

502
01:04:13,814 --> 01:04:15,980
I have everything I need.
Get the car.

503
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:45,315
I wear it.

504
01:04:57,876 --> 01:04:59,727
Where are they going?
- It is too hot,

505
01:04:59,963 --> 01:05:02,129
they go to the conference room.

506
01:05:26,818 --> 01:05:31,306
Majoor by my accident, I hear bad
I would like to stand close to the Führer.

507
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:33,236
I will see what I can do.

508
01:05:34,535 --> 01:05:40,245
They come not only from the east,
but also from the North and South of France.

509
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:43,946
As you can see, my Führer,

510
01:05:44,182 --> 01:05:49,341
the critical situation in the east,
as if the enemy continues.

511
01:05:49,774 --> 01:05:52,569
The lack of resources,
weakened our units.

512
01:05:52,806 --> 01:05:55,286
And the reserves are incomplete.

513
01:05:55,523 --> 01:05:57,807
My Führer,
you know Colonel Stauffenberg yet?

514
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:10,958
As you know,
is the 10th Army in Poland displaced

515
01:06:11,431 --> 01:06:13,754
and the 14th Division back.

516
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:18,046
Army Group Central is 28
lost 40 of their divisions,

517
01:06:18,676 --> 01:06:21,983
that nearly 350,000 men.

518
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:30,331
Since the attack of the Red,
about a month ago

519
01:06:30,607 --> 01:06:34,033
our troops back
to the Polish border.

520
01:06:37,222 --> 01:06:39,663
Together with the loss,
of the 4th Army in Minsk ...

521
01:06:41,632 --> 01:06:42,892
Yes sir.

522
01:06:43,522 --> 01:06:47,617
... Army Group North of Ukraine,
as well as the Romanian army.

523
01:06:53,012 --> 01:06:55,099
... further losses.

524
01:06:55,099 --> 01:07:00,887
Unless we use new divisions,
along the border of the Reich.

525
01:07:01,045 --> 01:07:05,258
Army Groups are enclosed by the enemy,
in less than 14 days.

526
01:07:05,494 --> 01:07:11,400
We risk losing all profit site,
that the last three years we have made.

527
01:07:13,094 --> 01:07:16,047
The General, he said that it was urgent.

528
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,087
Yes General, Stauffenberg.

529
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:29,238
Russian air activities
are as determined as the ground troops.

530
01:07:38,216 --> 01:07:40,302
Some parts are flooded ...

531
01:07:44,004 --> 01:07:46,051
... the Italian front, I go for ...

532
01:07:48,965 --> 01:07:54,242
One thing is certain, the Red Army
pulls aggressive westward on.

533
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:55,856
Even at the expense ...

534
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:02,707
To regroup ...

535
01:08:07,905 --> 01:08:12,000
... all southwest of Lüneburg
and approaching army group ...

536
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:17,710
It will be a catastrophe.

537
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:40,115
Step into.

538
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:43,029
Ride.

539
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:45,549
For the future, driving.

540
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,738
Ride.

541
01:08:52,321 --> 01:08:53,699
To work.

542
01:09:23,862 --> 01:09:28,508
Enter the ministry of war,
General Olbricht, it's urgent.

543
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:42,171
With General Olbrichts office.
- There was an explosion ... General ... Führer.

544
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:49,259
Staak all communication.
- Sir?

545
01:09:49,535 --> 01:09:50,834
Do it.

546
01:09:53,748 --> 01:09:58,355
What did Fellgiebel?
- It was not clear.

547
01:09:59,103 --> 01:10:00,481
Get him back on the line.

548
01:10:03,356 --> 01:10:05,128
The bomb went off, that was clear.

549
01:10:05,364 --> 01:10:08,199
Fell Giebel next step
is breaking all communication.

550
01:10:18,712 --> 01:10:21,863
Sorry, Colonel, but nobody out.
- We have a command of the Führer.

551
01:10:22,059 --> 01:10:23,674
We need to operations,
Do the gate open.

552
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:28,045
Excuse me sir. I recommend ...
- I just gave you an order, Sergeant.

553
01:10:30,565 --> 01:10:31,825
Excuse me.

554
01:10:38,873 --> 01:10:41,078
Colonel Stauffenberg,
for Field Marshal Keitel.

555
01:10:47,536 --> 01:10:50,922
Colonel Stauffenberg was clear.
We start Valyrie, despite ...

556
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:55,962
We need Fromm.
- The Führer is dead, arrest him now.

557
01:10:56,199 --> 01:10:58,758
He should recommend to Valkyrie to start
this is our only ...

558
01:10:58,994 --> 01:11:02,459
I do nothing, before I got a confirmation
of Fellgiebel. Call him.

559
01:11:02,696 --> 01:11:04,743
Every second of discussion,
is a second lost.

560
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:06,279
The risks are too great.

561
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:09,232
Stauffenberg and then
What about its risks?

562
01:11:09,468 --> 01:11:12,146
He did his part
and now let him down.

563
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:15,138
Veldmaarschalk,
Stauffenberg in here, Sergeant ...

564
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,580
Kolbe, sir.

565
01:11:18,643 --> 01:11:22,817
Kolbe will not let me through the fence.
Yes, I explained.

566
01:11:23,053 --> 01:11:25,573
Maybe you want him out, sir.

567
01:11:30,771 --> 01:11:33,291
Everything is fine sir, thank you

568
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:38,016
Open the gate.

569
01:11:46,954 --> 01:11:49,632
Then the reserve army in preparedness.
- Only when Stauffenberg back,

570
01:11:49,868 --> 01:11:54,278
and confirms that Hiltler dead.
Then we go through.

571
01:11:59,594 --> 01:12:03,217
Where are you going?
- Wherever you go.

572
01:12:03,413 --> 01:12:04,713
Lunch.

573
01:13:41,696 --> 01:13:44,295
Another preparedness order.

574
01:13:46,185 --> 01:13:49,138
Send by and give me a copy.

575
01:14:14,142 --> 01:14:15,520
Another preparedness order.

576
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:20,679
Here was an ancient Greek to be slain.

577
01:14:21,978 --> 01:14:24,695
Lucky for you,
we have developed.

578
01:14:27,648 --> 01:14:29,263
Gather the men.

579
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:18,246
What is wrong?

580
01:15:19,861 --> 01:15:21,711
I see where our driver.

581
01:15:25,058 --> 01:15:28,957
The Colonel and I are at the airport,
there is no car, no one.

582
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:33,052
The command is only just given?

583
01:15:34,469 --> 01:15:36,871
This is Stauffenberg,
give me General Olbricht.

584
01:15:44,589 --> 01:15:46,558
What is this?

585
01:15:52,858 --> 01:15:54,945
Explain me this once?
- We did something, while h. ..

586
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:59,079
We do not know whether Hitler is still alive.
- This is Germany, not u.

587
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:14,357
Office of General Olbricht.
- Colonel Stauffenberg, for you

588
01:16:20,815 --> 01:16:24,201
It's been three hours ago Olbricht,
where were you doing?

589
01:16:24,438 --> 01:16:27,351
We have no confirmation,
Hiltlers of death.

590
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:30,895
I have seen the explosion itself.

591
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,809
We have carried out.
- Oh dear.

592
01:16:34,045 --> 01:16:36,054
Where is Fromm, does he?

593
01:16:37,629 --> 01:16:39,794
There was nobody with him.

594
01:16:50,977 --> 01:16:54,915
Listen to me.
Think not to Germany or Europe.

595
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:59,876
Your life is at stake,
if you want to survive, do what I say.

596
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,790
Once you have suspended,
start from Valkyrie Fromm name.

597
01:17:03,026 --> 01:17:06,609
Give him the chance to do
otherwise you arrest him, understand?

598
01:17:07,436 --> 01:17:10,389
Be about 50 minutes Fromm office.

599
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:44,214
Call Beck and others,
tell them that the time has come.

600
01:17:49,293 --> 01:17:51,459
Connect me with communications.

601
01:17:52,758 --> 01:17:56,420
This is General Olbricht.
I call on behalf of General Fromm,

602
01:17:56,656 --> 01:18:00,712
commander of the reserve army.
The Führer Adolf Hitler is dead.

603
01:18:00,948 --> 01:18:04,256
Radical elements within the SS,
try the government to take over.

604
01:18:04,492 --> 01:18:07,760
Start Operation Valkyrie.

605
01:18:41,624 --> 01:18:44,892
Give the orders through.

606
01:19:20,764 --> 01:19:22,339
Battalion.

607
01:19:22,772 --> 01:19:24,111
Attention.

608
01:19:32,262 --> 01:19:35,963
Our Führer, Adolf Hitler ...

609
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,176
is dead.

610
01:19:40,412 --> 01:19:42,027
Who told you,
that the Führer is dead?

611
01:19:42,302 --> 01:19:44,862
General Fellgiebel,
Wolves from the Gorge.

612
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:50,138
You do not call
all communication lines are dead.

613
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:51,713
Give me the Wolves Gorge.

614
01:19:57,856 --> 01:20:01,045
Yes, this is General Fromm,
for Field Marshal Keitel, urgent.

615
01:20:05,731 --> 01:20:09,984
I am sorry to disturb you,
but can you tell what is going on?

616
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,921
There are terrible rumors rotation.
- What do you mean?

617
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:17,465
They say that the Führer was murdered.

618
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:23,608
Another failed attempt.
The Führer has never been in danger.

619
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:27,782
By the way.
Where is your husband, Stauffenberg?

620
01:20:28,018 --> 01:20:31,365
Stauffenberg?
On return to Berlin, I think.

621
01:20:32,153 --> 01:20:35,657
Let us know when he has arrived.
I want him to speak.

622
01:20:42,508 --> 01:20:44,753
The Führer is unharmed.
- That is a lie

623
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:47,155
Hitler is dead,
Operation Valkyrie runs.

624
01:20:47,391 --> 01:20:50,502
Only I can start Valkyrie.
- That you have done.

625
01:20:59,322 --> 01:21:00,621
This is treason.

626
01:21:00,858 --> 01:21:03,142
At present, the reserve army
control over Berlin.

627
01:21:03,378 --> 01:21:06,843
If you are with us or not?
- Do you know what you have done?

628
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,497
The Führer is alive.

629
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:12,631
I have placed the bomb.
I saw the explosion, he is dead.

630
01:21:14,561 --> 01:21:17,120
If you join us?
- I believe this. Is this a kind of ...

631
01:21:17,356 --> 01:21:19,286
If you are with us or not?

632
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:25,271
Colonel, if this is true.
- Should you shoot yourself now.

633
01:21:25,507 --> 01:21:28,382
The rest is under arrest.
- We do not u.

634
01:21:34,091 --> 01:21:36,808
I do not know whether you know
which should lead.

635
01:21:39,643 --> 01:21:40,943
Give me operations.

636
01:21:42,557 --> 01:21:46,298
With Colonel Stauffenberg
leader of Operation Valkyrie.

637
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:50,393
Nobody goes in or out,
without command of General Olbricht.

638
01:22:06,576 --> 01:22:07,876
Geral Beck.

639
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:10,947
You carry your uniform not, sir.

640
01:22:11,223 --> 01:22:13,546
We need to see us,
as movement from the people.

641
01:22:19,531 --> 01:22:20,870
Colonel Stauffenberg.

642
01:22:27,131 --> 01:22:30,320
The chef has the full cooperation
the police of Berlin guaranteed.

643
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,817
My people, you will not suffer,
you have my word.

644
01:22:39,692 --> 01:22:41,031
Thank you

645
01:23:15,406 --> 01:23:18,674
Colonel Stauffenberg,
We report our service.

646
01:23:24,069 --> 01:23:25,801
Thank you for coming.

647
01:23:29,975 --> 01:23:33,834
Gentlemen.
About three hours we have the confirmation,

648
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:38,559
that we in government hands.
And SS command center is removed.

649
01:23:39,701 --> 01:23:41,237
You know what needs to be done.

650
01:23:42,654 --> 01:23:46,946
Tonight, the Hitler's Germany,
seen his last sunrise.

651
01:24:17,502 --> 01:24:22,975
Yes sir, everybody is replaced.
In fact, everything is already commander.

652
01:24:23,211 --> 01:24:27,188
He is correct participant
just think back to that party.

653
01:24:27,425 --> 01:24:31,205
I get it, but this is an emergency.
- Can I's 11th district ...

654
01:24:31,402 --> 01:24:35,261
I need a decision, Major.
- This is not revenge, for ...

655
01:24:35,497 --> 01:24:39,119
Can I have your highest officer in Hanover ...
- To set up another government form.

656
01:24:39,316 --> 01:24:42,073
Be careful with who
you say, loyalty is now different.

657
01:24:42,309 --> 01:24:43,805
Yes, Paris, France.

658
01:24:44,002 --> 01:24:45,813
It also said the Führer.

659
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,861
Thank you, you took the right decision.

660
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:51,168
District 13 of us.

661
01:25:02,706 --> 01:25:06,683
I arrest you in command of the Field,
for crimes against the state.

662
01:25:15,936 --> 01:25:18,023
This is Colonel Stauffenberg,
I want General Todt speak.

663
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,134
I spoke with battalion 134,
no difficulty in reporting.

664
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:23,772
Colonel Stauffenberg, will explain everything.

665
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,819
Excellent.

666
01:25:27,631 --> 01:25:32,198
For my wife, she is in Bamberg,
with the children, would you call them?

667
01:25:32,395 --> 01:25:33,695
Thank you

668
01:25:33,892 --> 01:25:36,805
The General has declared
that the orders at the headquarters are.

669
01:25:37,002 --> 01:25:40,231
Check every 20 minutes the radio,
until we have a confirmation.

670
01:25:52,831 --> 01:25:55,115
With respect sir,
but you can not believe everything.

671
01:25:55,391 --> 01:25:59,604
That's SS propaganda, he is dead.
- The whole army awaiting orders.

672
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,400
General.

673
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:07,637
The army, the communications centers
in their power.

674
01:26:07,873 --> 01:26:09,803
They repeat the message.

675
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:16,772
He participates.

676
01:26:17,323 --> 01:26:20,749
Call Postner, tell him that he
units under our management places.

677
01:26:21,025 --> 01:26:22,679
We must find a way,
to control.

678
01:26:22,915 --> 01:26:24,569
We have the government center
under control.

679
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:26,262
Berlin we have not.

680
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:51,502
What is it now sergeant?
- An arrest warrant.

681
01:26:51,777 --> 01:26:53,589
A command of Colonel Stauffenberg,
of the Ministry of War

682
01:26:53,864 --> 01:26:55,282
to Reich Minister Goebbels to arrest.

683
01:26:55,991 --> 01:27:00,165
The other comes from the Wolf Gap,
to Colonel Stauffenberg arrested.

684
01:27:05,441 --> 01:27:06,977
Send them both on.

685
01:27:08,119 --> 01:27:12,765
We do not recommend to assess
we send them on.

686
01:27:13,434 --> 01:27:15,994
That's all sergeant.

687
01:27:51,629 --> 01:27:54,740
New arrest warrants sir.
For Stauffenberg and Goebbels,

688
01:27:56,827 --> 01:27:58,914
them both arrested.

689
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:02,143
I would not like that,
to discover that I was abused.

690
01:28:02,339 --> 01:28:03,914
Do you really think a coup is?

691
01:28:04,387 --> 01:28:05,686
I'm afraid so.

692
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,403
I do not know,
which side we are.

693
01:28:09,624 --> 01:28:10,884
Come on.

694
01:28:21,437 --> 01:28:23,209
I just spoke with the colonel,

695
01:28:23,248 --> 01:28:26,910
they have 1200 SS and Gestapo officers
in Paris were arrested.

696
01:28:27,186 --> 01:28:28,840
Without one shot.

697
01:28:29,076 --> 01:28:32,501
The first reports from Vienna and Poland,
look good.

698
01:29:06,404 --> 01:29:08,176
I am ready to be connected.

699
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,139
Minister Goebbels?

700
01:29:23,809 --> 01:29:25,265
What can I do for you, Major?

701
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:31,172
My battalion has a warrant,
your ministry to be filled and you arrested.

702
01:29:34,046 --> 01:29:36,645
Are you a dedicated
national socialist, Major?

703
01:29:53,065 --> 01:29:54,404
With Major Remer.

704
01:29:59,759 --> 01:30:02,358
Hopefully you recognize my voice.

705
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:07,083
Yes sir.
- Then listen to me.

706
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:16,297
I want to live traitors in charge.
- Yes, my Führer.

707
01:30:20,392 --> 01:30:24,763
You heard what he said.
The Führer wants to live traitors address.

708
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:27,480
Yes sir.

709
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:53,429
It is a coup.

710
01:30:54,334 --> 01:30:56,854
We can no longer remain neutral.

711
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:02,721
You must decide.

712
01:31:04,493 --> 01:31:07,328
If it is, we know
whether we have chosen the right direction.

713
01:31:17,881 --> 01:31:19,653
Send all communication
Wolves of the gap by

714
01:31:19,889 --> 01:31:21,819
stop all communication with Stauffenberg.

715
01:31:28,355 --> 01:31:29,891
Let these men Friday

716
01:31:31,505 --> 01:31:33,080
But why?

717
01:31:33,395 --> 01:31:38,632
We now have orders Hiltler itself.
We were misled.

718
01:31:42,137 --> 01:31:44,184
We lost contact with District 11.

719
01:31:47,649 --> 01:31:50,878
The circuit panel is overloaded,
try again later.

720
01:31:55,525 --> 01:31:58,005
Give me Fellgiebel General.

721
01:31:58,202 --> 01:32:01,864
We still have ...
- Keep trying.

722
01:32:04,069 --> 01:32:05,566
Where is General Fromm?

723
01:32:08,007 --> 01:32:10,488
I command
not General Fromm.

724
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:15,331
What are you doing here? What happens here?
- The Führer is dead.

725
01:32:15,567 --> 01:32:18,560
The SS was a coup to make,
Operation Valkyrie then,

726
01:32:18,796 --> 01:32:21,119
to stop the riot.
To Hitler's government to protect.

727
01:32:21,355 --> 01:32:23,442
You keep the command of your troops.

728
01:32:24,584 --> 01:32:27,577
I do nothing,
until I have spoken with General Fromm.

729
01:32:27,774 --> 01:32:30,806
You follow the orders on
or you are arrested.

730
01:32:32,026 --> 01:32:33,759
This is treason.

731
01:32:34,704 --> 01:32:38,011
Since I do not participate.
The Führer is not dead.

732
01:32:49,115 --> 01:32:53,880
Listen to me,
you make a terrible mistake.

733
01:32:54,116 --> 01:32:56,754
The Führer is not dead.

734
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,275
Try my wife
again achieved.

735
01:33:49,873 --> 01:33:53,023
I can reach anyone.
Look what is happening.

736
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:05,702
Yes with Stauffenberg,
General would return your call.

737
01:34:05,938 --> 01:34:08,655
I assume,
that everything in your district under control.

738
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,609
The General wants me to wait?
I recommend him to the phone to get.

739
01:34:16,885 --> 01:34:18,775
You need the oath,
a liar, Hans ...

740
01:34:23,461 --> 01:34:24,839
Hans, listen.

741
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:53,859
This operation is aborted.

742
01:34:58,781 --> 01:35:01,419
Today was an attack
the Führer committed.

743
01:35:01,774 --> 01:35:06,381
The Führer is not seriously injured ...

744
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:10,869
And he immediately picked up his work again.
Were seriously injured ...

745
01:35:19,493 --> 01:35:25,911
Send this to all commanders.
"Broadcasting is incorrect, Führer is dead."

746
01:35:28,313 --> 01:35:30,400
Operation Valkyrie run.

747
01:35:45,127 --> 01:35:46,505
I saw the explosion.

748
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:53,317
I saw the explosion.

749
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:04,775
Today was an attack,
on the life of the Führer.

750
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:08,122
The Führer is not seriously injured ...

751
01:36:42,025 --> 01:36:46,986
What happens.
- I do not want to be caught.

752
01:36:50,215 --> 01:36:51,554
Excuse me.

753
01:36:53,129 --> 01:36:54,429
Go.

754
01:36:55,925 --> 01:36:58,012
It is good, go ahead.

755
01:37:13,723 --> 01:37:16,755
General, sir, you have here.

756
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:43,422
Stop.
- Reverse.

757
01:38:43,658 --> 01:38:45,784
I said stop.
- I said back.

758
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:13,623
Stop shooting.

759
01:39:22,364 --> 01:39:24,333
Colonel Stauffenberg.

760
01:39:26,932 --> 01:39:29,885
You are under arrest,
by order of the Führer.

761
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:56,543
If you have something like, to your wives
and children, I am now happy.

762
01:39:58,472 --> 01:40:01,662
Okay, the war,
represented by me,

763
01:40:01,937 --> 01:40:03,591
in the absence of the Führer,
will pronounce the verdict.

764
01:40:03,828 --> 01:40:05,324
Beck, you are under arrest.

765
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:10,561
Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim,
General Olbricht, Lieutenant Haeften

766
01:40:10,836 --> 01:40:14,223
and the colonel, whose name I do not call,
to death.

767
01:40:14,459 --> 01:40:16,703
General, according to my orders,
I have these guys live ...

768
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:18,200
No Major.

769
01:40:19,932 --> 01:40:22,137
I would like a gun,

770
01:40:24,461 --> 01:40:26,626
for personal reasons.

771
01:40:43,676 --> 01:40:45,881
Continue.
- With all due respect sir ...

772
01:40:46,117 --> 01:40:47,417
That was all, Major.

773
01:40:47,692 --> 01:40:49,583
By us to kill
hide not your concern.

774
01:40:49,858 --> 01:40:52,181
My involvement? What are you talking about?

775
01:40:52,575 --> 01:40:55,607
You knew it. And did not.
- You are as guilty as we do.

776
01:40:55,843 --> 01:40:59,978
Hold still lieutenant.
- No one is spared.

777
01:41:14,586 --> 01:41:17,106
I think of times of yesteryear.

778
01:41:21,871 --> 01:41:25,966
This is a disgrace.
This has never occurred

779
01:41:26,202 --> 01:41:30,809
the Field Marshal and General
declare him dead,

780
01:41:29,589 --> 01:41:33,251
him, the Füher all of us.

781
01:41:33,526 --> 01:41:36,164
And you protest when I say this?

782
01:41:42,031 --> 01:41:46,717
My German countrymen,
I speak to you, because of two things.

783
01:41:46,953 --> 01:41:51,482
First, I want you to hear my voice,
so you know that I am unharmed.

784
01:41:51,915 --> 01:41:56,089
Second:
I want to inform you about a crime,

785
01:41:56,325 --> 01:41:58,648
which is unprecedented in German history.

786
01:41:59,396 --> 01:42:05,815
A small group of malignant officers
stretched together in order to eliminate me.

787
01:42:07,193 --> 01:42:09,595
Apart from a few bruises
and burns,

788
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:12,548
I was totally unharmed.

789
01:42:14,005 --> 01:42:16,840
I see the hand of Providence,

790
01:42:17,864 --> 01:42:20,817
I encourage,
to accomplish my work.

791
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,252
Look them in the eyes.

792
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:34,914
They will continue to remind you.

793
01:43:02,989 --> 01:43:07,478
We must show the world,
Lest anyone forget us.

794
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,700
Fire.

795
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:50,949
The people will know
that our principles, our lives.

796
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,619
Targeting.

797
01:44:12,133 --> 01:44:14,259
Halt. Stand still.

798
01:44:20,638 --> 01:44:25,127
You can now send to the executioner,
but within three months

799
01:44:25,363 --> 01:44:28,947
be honest people,
please leave

800
01:44:29,144 --> 01:44:35,011
and you will live to the scaffold drag.
- Feed him away.

801
01:44:39,933 --> 01:44:42,413
Men ready.

802
01:44:44,697 --> 01:44:45,957
Targeting.

803
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:48,989
Fire.

804
01:45:42,186 --> 01:45:45,415
The plan of June 20,
was the last of 15 known attempts

805
01:45:45,651 --> 01:45:48,644
Germans,
for Adolf Hitler to murder.

806
01:45:50,298 --> 01:45:55,456
Nine months later, Hitler committed,
surrounded in a Berlin, suicide.

807
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:00,772
Nina von Stauffenberg, and her children,
survived the war.

808
01:46:01,008 --> 01:46:04,079
She died on April 2, 2006.

809
01:46:07,308 --> 01:46:10,498
You could not shame,
you resisted.

810
01:46:10,734 --> 01:46:13,923
you gave your life for freedom,
justice and honor.

811
01:46:14,199 --> 01:46:16,640
From the memorial,
of the German Resistance, Berlin.
