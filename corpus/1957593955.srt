00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:04,560
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:16,383
(dramatic music)

3
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:09,649
(siren blaring)

4
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:12,399
(dramatic music)

5
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,666
(clock ticking)

6
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:31,561
(car horn blaring)

7
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:48,326
(explosion)

8
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:55,464
(yelling)

9
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:58,214
(alarm sounding)

10
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,736
(door banging)

11
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,486
(alarm sounding)

12
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:32,775
(explosions)

13
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,580
(alarm ringing)

14
00:03:45,712 --> 00:03:47,376
(door knocking)

15
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:48,469
- Yes.

16
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:50,267
- Hi, Daddy.

17
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:51,767
I just wanted to let
you know that everyone

18
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:53,445
is arriving downstairs.

19
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:54,362
- Oh, good.

20
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:00,062
- Are you okay?

21
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:02,466
- Yeah.

22
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:03,466
Joseph here?

23
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:07,155
- [Diane] Daddy, is everything all right?

24
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:07,988
- Mm-hmm.

25
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:13,089
(soft music)

26
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:15,002
- Oh, Daddy, that's terrible.

27
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:16,169
How many died?

28
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:18,874
- 19, it's barbaric.

29
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:25,039
Virtual slavery, in this day
and age and in this country.

30
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,289
And it disturbs me, deeply.

31
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,155
- Sorry, everyone, sorry.

32
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:31,595
I was getting something from the car.

33
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:34,012
You will see why, hello, Mom.

34
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:37,040
So what do you think?

35
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,784
- Nobody's gonna eat my dinner
with a desert like that.

36
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:42,607
- Are you kidding, miss your dinner?

37
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:44,058
- All right.

38
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:46,479
I think it's time we sat down and

39
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,737
enjoyed your mother's wonderful dinner.

40
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,731
Joseph, Robert?

41
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:51,981
- Sure, Father.

42
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:56,257
Oh heavenly Father, we all
thank you for this bounty

43
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:59,482
that you've given us here tonight.

44
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:01,586
We thank you for showing us

45
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:04,219
what is good and what is right.

46
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:08,381
Keep this family together
in love, forever.

47
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:09,631
- [Group] Amen.

48
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:14,139
(laughing)

49
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,306
(singing)

50
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:25,502
- Justin, I spoke to Allen today.

51
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:29,033
He says the quicker you pass
the bar, the better for him.

52
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,541
He wants to retire.

53
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,874
(applause and cheering)

54
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:38,585
I think this is the time to make

55
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:41,914
another announcement of another first-rate

56
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,747
addition to the ranks.

57
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,955
It's time that Joe here becomes familiar

58
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:50,847
with the workings of our business.

59
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:53,795
- Excuse me, Father, can I speak?

60
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:55,515
I mean, Joseph's young.

61
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,709
He's just graduated.

62
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,214
- Right, none of the
rest of us started out

63
00:05:58,214 --> 00:06:00,365
in the family business
just like (snaps fingers).

64
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:01,906
- Joseph has excelled in his studies.

65
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:03,223
He's demonstrated his readiness.

66
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:06,534
He begins by helping Ashton and

67
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,559
you, Robert, with the bookkeeping.

68
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:11,212
- Yeah but, Father, wait a second.

69
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:15,379
Ashton's doing great in
accounting, you said so yourself.

70
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:17,297
- Excuse me.

71
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:20,902
I'm sorry, Mother.

72
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:24,525
(murmuring)

73
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,447
- What's this about?

74
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:31,640
- I'm sorry, but that
position was promised to Ash

75
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,329
and only Ash.

76
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,790
He's worked very hard, and
he's done an excellent job.

77
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,571
- He still has his job, his position.

78
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:39,836
- Well obviously not.

79
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:42,620
As soon as Joe learns the
ropes, isn't that just the way

80
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,297
it is around here, Father,
especially when it comes to Joe?

81
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:49,176
- Sit down, I've made my decision.

82
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,563
Ashton's position is secure.

83
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:52,509
Joseph is only gonna be an apprentice.

84
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:53,859
(throat clearing)

85
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,849
- Father, may I, you know.

86
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,932
Maybe I can help Simon on the docks

87
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:00,427
or do something else, or?

88
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:02,656
- I know, but working
with Ashton in bookkeeping

89
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,435
is where I want you to start.

90
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:08,518
Robert will supervise, is that clear?

91
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:12,546
- Excuse me, Dad, may I be excused?

92
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:16,402
I would like to go talk
to, to Ash, please.

93
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,439
- All right.

94
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,356
- Thank you, thank you.

95
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,069
- Simon, you have something to say?

96
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,236
- Yeah, I say it's unfair.

97
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:30,279
This is a joke, right?

98
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,630
- Well, everything's a joke to you.

99
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,239
- What I mean

100
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,230
is that Joe is just handed everything,

101
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,808
opportunities none of the rest of us had,

102
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,934
like this so-called apprenticeship?

103
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,900
- What have you done with
your opportunities, Simon?

104
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,060
- Oh, Jacob, not now.

105
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,151
- Thrown them away.

106
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,680
Got yourself a police record.

107
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,212
In the process, dragged
Lee here into the mess

108
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:50,628
just for good measure.

109
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:52,665
Is that what you mean by unfair?

110
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:53,699
- I was a kid.

111
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:54,935
- When are you gonna grow up?

112
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:55,768
- Jacob.

113
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:00,080
- All right, all right.

114
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,998
I'm sorry, I apologize.

115
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:10,364
The past can't be undone,
but it can be learned from.

116
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:15,910
I'd like to show you
something, all of you.

117
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:19,372
Take at a look at this,

118
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:23,205
if you wanna know what
unfair can really mean.

119
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:36,527
(horn blowing)

120
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:41,694
(upbeat rock music)

121
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,552
- Good morning.

122
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:45,520
Say, you're early.

123
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,633
- Yeah, I was trying to impress the boss.

124
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:51,054
And this coffee, ugh.

125
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:54,221
I thought we ran a successful company.

126
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,859
- Ooh, oh, you're fired.

127
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:01,155
Just kidding.

128
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:03,239
Uh, you've been here.

129
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,445
My office there, keep your
grubby fingers off my desk.

130
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:09,278
Come on, I'll give you
the new employees tour.

131
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:17,507
You'll find Grant in these
departments, most of the time.

132
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:19,674
(singing)

133
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:25,791
Oh here it is, your desk.

134
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,208
Get to work, now.

135
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,817
Got you again.

136
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:37,245
We just moved Simon into
that office over there.

137
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:40,739
It's closer to his department.

138
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:43,630
Sometimes, you're gonna find Lee there.

139
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,213
But well, you know.

140
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:49,684
Hey, guys, come on, what is this?

141
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:50,517
Look, huh?

142
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:55,272
- Hi, Ash.

143
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:13,157
(dramatic noises)

144
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:18,125
(explosion)

145
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:38,254
- Hey, hey hey hey, are you all right?

146
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:41,540
- Come on, let's get him inside.

147
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,539
- Maybe you should go home.

148
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:44,806
- No, I'm fine, really I'm fine, you guys.

149
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:48,820
- Ash, Ash please, would
you mind repeating that?

150
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,475
- Our dear little egg white half-brother

151
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:56,807
said he felt this wave
of power wash over him,

152
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:58,346
just like in his dreams.

153
00:10:58,346 --> 00:10:59,611
- Oh.

154
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:01,776
- I'm flying, I'm flying.

155
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:03,105
Really, I'm flying.

156
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:05,688
- That's good, the little twit.

157
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,384
- I think he's all right.

158
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:11,801
He's in his room.

159
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,299
- Oh.

160
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:21,339
Have I not been listening?

161
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:24,166
- I know you love your children.

162
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,583
But sometimes, you see Joseph

163
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:32,629
and hear Joseph a little more
than you hear the others.

164
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:37,668
- How can I not, I mean, see
him at least differently?

165
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,285
And Joseph is our child.

166
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,423
He's the only child of our marriage.

167
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:44,267
- They're all our children.

168
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:48,250
And blood related or
not, I'm their mother.

169
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,833
Joseph is our gift.

170
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:51,836
- Oh.

171
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:56,279
I love them all.

172
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,562
I do, I love them all.

173
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:58,729
- I know that.

174
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,432
Do you think of her?

175
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,739
- [Jacob] Sometimes.

176
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:09,268
- She gave you six wonderful sons.

177
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:12,185
And she gave you a lovely daughter.

178
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:18,371
If you had another child,

179
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:21,518
what would you want?

180
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:23,654
Another son or another daughter?

181
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:25,904
(laughing)

182
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:28,322
- I think we're getting a little too old

183
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:30,322
for that sorta nonsense.

184
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:35,411
- We're not.

185
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:39,281
- We're not?

186
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:41,698
(chattering)

187
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:48,626
- Well, it's taken us a couple of months,

188
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:51,987
but I think our coffee problem
is finally solved, you guys.

189
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:54,170
- You're sure these figures are right?

190
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,836
- Ash, listen to me.

191
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:58,367
Father expected us to need
money for the next season.

192
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,211
- Yeah, well, I had
intended to show Father

193
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:03,533
that I could increase our profits.

194
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,118
- You know, he's right, Ash.

195
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,221
It's not your fault.

196
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:09,562
- Ash, look, remember Simon's suggestion?

197
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:11,892
He and Justin, they're
working it out right now.

198
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,634
Right now, as we speak.

199
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:15,571
That's gonna help us out a lot.

200
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:19,665
- Is this something that you
guys have gone over with Dad?

201
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,498
(horn honking)

202
00:13:22,498 --> 00:13:23,415
- Joe, Joe.

203
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:28,808
When Father established this
business, labor was cheap.

204
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,352
Now, with the laws and the unions,

205
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,477
our competitors are just
blowing us out of the water.

206
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:34,031
What are we gonna do?

207
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:36,192
- Father just doesn't
understand today's market.

208
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:39,319
The competition, you know,
it's just tougher out there.

209
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,211
- So, what is that you guys plan to do?

210
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:46,360
- Okay, see, it's the cost
of labor that's killing us.

211
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,377
So that's the one area that
we can probably cut back on.

212
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:54,727
- You can't cut pay and
benefits, you can't do that.

213
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:55,894
- Not exactly.

214
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:59,609
It would be having to let some people go.

215
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:02,523
You're just contracting
it out to somebody else.

216
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:04,137
- Wait a minute.

217
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:06,767
Are you talking about using sweatshops?

218
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:09,826
- Look, I've arranged it with Justin.

219
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:10,928
He can arrange the whole thing

220
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:13,134
so we won't be legally connected.

221
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:15,362
- That's not the point, and you know it.

222
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:18,230
Ash, you can't agree to this.

223
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,248
- Grant says these places,
they're not as bad as reported.

224
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:24,036
- Of course they are.

225
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:25,510
Why do you think they stay underground?

226
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,871
Because they're such nice places to work?

227
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:30,132
Dad will never agree to
this, and you know it.

228
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:33,383
- Joe, he can't stop
what he don't know about.

229
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:35,780
Besides, these shops are right
here in the United States.

230
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,918
They're not in some third-world slum.

231
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:40,370
Right here.

232
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,953
- That doesn't change anything.

233
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,962
- I'm not gonna risk losing
this company that it took

234
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:49,031
Dad a lifetime to build, what about you?

235
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:53,184
- This is the future
of our family business.

236
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,229
- Yeah.

237
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:55,622
- But the costs.

238
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:58,289
- Joe, sometimes things do cost.

239
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:04,138
But in this world, you gotta
protect your own first.

240
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:04,971
- So it's,

241
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,557
it's us or them?

242
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:10,765
- I'm not gonna argue ethics
and morals with you, Joe.

243
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:12,700
This is my decision,

244
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,893
and there's no reason
to involve Dad in it.

245
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:19,136
- Oh no, you will not do this thing.

246
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:20,670
- It was just an idea, Dad.

247
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,918
Joseph had no right.

248
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:25,291
- He had every right, every right,

249
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,194
and he was man enough
to do the right thing.

250
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,437
- We were thinking of
the business, of you.

251
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:33,104
- Thinking about me?

252
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:38,120
I worked in a sweatshop when I was a kid.

253
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,997
Three years of my life, I slaved.

254
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:43,495
For scum who had the gall to tell me

255
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:45,957
that they were doing me
a favor, letting me work

256
00:15:45,957 --> 00:15:49,790
in their stinking shop
for 15, 16 hours a day.

257
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:55,950
You dare tell me that I raised sons

258
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,425
who would do what those
dregs of humanity did to me?

259
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,092
- I'm sorry, Father.

260
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:05,393
- I want everybody at the house tonight.

261
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:07,643
Six o'clock, no exceptions.

262
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,301
(birds chirping)

263
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:15,707
- I planned to present
this with a little bit

264
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:19,790
more pomp and circumstance
on Sunday dinner, but.

265
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:26,466
Try it on.

266
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,458
I made it, with these old hands,

267
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,227
so I'm not so sure I
haven't lost my touch.

268
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:34,810
- I don't think so.

269
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:37,308
Not hardly, I would say.

270
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,954
- [Jacob] Not bad, not bad.

271
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:41,529
I mean, I haven't touched
a needle and thread

272
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,726
for 15 years, but not
bad if I say so myself.

273
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:45,929
- Not bad at all.

274
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:47,596
Thank you very much.

275
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:51,263
But why this?

276
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:54,253
What did I do to deserve this, why now?

277
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:56,503
- I'm proud of you, Joseph.

278
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,350
My hopes are with you.

279
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,793
Well, let's just say that
this marks the beginning

280
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:04,043
of what I expect will be a,

281
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:07,738
a very successful career and life.

282
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:10,983
- How you holding up?

283
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:14,783
- Okay, for now, ask me again in an hour.

284
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,004
- Is everyone here?

285
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:17,148
- Yeah, I think so.

286
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:18,898
- I haven't seen Joe.

287
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:22,175
- I hate this.

288
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:24,305
How could he do this?

289
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:28,288
How could he just stab
us in the back like that?

290
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:29,762
- Well why not?

291
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:31,504
This is Daddy's good little boy.

292
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:34,226
A shining example to us all.

293
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:36,183
Joe isn't one of us.

294
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:39,538
But as long as he's around
doing Daddy's little spying,

295
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,697
we're all gonna be under the microscope.

296
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:43,407
- So what are we gonna do about it?

297
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:44,240
- Nothing.

298
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:46,310
Not yet.

299
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,604
- Joseph was right in coming to me.

300
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:52,541
And I think, Robert, if you're honest

301
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,647
with yourself, you'll agree.

302
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:55,480
- Yes.

303
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:58,158
- And you realize that
there are consequences

304
00:17:58,158 --> 00:17:59,720
for your actions?

305
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,637
- Yes, sir.

306
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,128
- I will not be signing
the business over to you

307
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:05,878
next fall as planned.

308
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:11,244
I will be releasing it to you,
conditionally, in five years.

309
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:16,458
- Five years, oh, Father.

310
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,934
- I need to know that you can
run the business, profitably,

311
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:24,101
without resorting to intolerable
solutions to problems.

312
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:30,239
If you want to work with us,
you'll be going to New York

313
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:33,406
next week as planned to secure a loan.

314
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:38,703
And taking Ashton and
Simon and Joseph with you.

315
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:44,145
- Robert, I know you're angry with me,

316
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:46,395
but just hear me out, okay?

317
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:50,713
I've been studying the
market with my eye towards

318
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:54,573
getting us very very
favorable terms on a loan.

319
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:55,878
I'll give you my advice.

320
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:58,834
You don't have to take it, but I'm betting

321
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:02,667
I can get you the best
terms you've ever seen.

322
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:04,629
- All right.

323
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:12,042
But, the final decision
on the loan, that's mine.

324
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:14,948
- Yes, yes.

325
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,369
All right.

326
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:29,581
- Justin.

327
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:30,997
- Simon, I thought you'd left.

328
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:32,294
- No, I just wanted to talk to Ash

329
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:34,035
about what happened downstairs.

330
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:35,689
Robert got the worst of it.

331
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:37,838
- Ash didn't fare much better.

332
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:39,277
I was gonna go talk to him.

333
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:41,291
- He'll be okay.

334
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,979
- We all got a chewing out.

335
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:46,735
Our little half-brother
should feel very proud.

336
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:48,902
There's nothing we can do.

337
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:53,601
- Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.

338
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:00,916
(upbeat music)

339
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,833
- Oh, Tattinger, way to go, Robert.

340
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,286
- Here's to a job well done.

341
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:14,369
Loan terms that brought
tears to a banker's eyes.

342
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:19,369
- [Ashton] So what's
the plan for tomorrow?

343
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:21,372
- How about some sightseeing?

344
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:22,429
Huh?

345
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,455
We got two days to kill.

346
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:25,538
- Yeah, sure.

347
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:29,539
- Man, what a day.

348
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,039
I've about had it.

349
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,389
- I'll tuck you in, come on.

350
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:38,461
- Yeah, yeah, good night, Robert.

351
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:40,517
- Good night, you guys.

352
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:43,100
(upbeat music)

353
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:46,705
Okay.

354
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:50,872
All right, well, I guess
I'll see you tomorrow, right?

355
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,985
- Yeah, good night, Joe.

356
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,568
(upbeat music)

357
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,854
- I tried, Lord.

358
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:08,734
I really did.

359
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:11,497
But,

360
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:15,127
they're still so angry with me.

361
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:20,448
I don't know what else to do.

362
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:39,670
- Can I come in?

363
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,753
- Yeah, yeah.

364
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:45,789
What time is it?

365
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:47,289
- It's about 8:30.

366
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:49,551
- Oh yeah?

367
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:52,205
- Look, Joseph,

368
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:57,422
I know things have been bad recently.

369
00:21:57,422 --> 00:22:00,589
I think, well, can I say we all think,

370
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:05,510
maybe it's about time
we buried the hatchet.

371
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:10,657
What about it, how do you feel?

372
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:12,907
- I don't know what to say.

373
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:16,956
- Well, why don't you get yourself ready

374
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:18,419
and join Ash and me?

375
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,636
We're going out on a little
excursion this morning

376
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:22,225
while we're waiting for Robert.

377
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:23,462
- Oh yeah?

378
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:24,295
Where to?

379
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:27,819
- It's a manufacturing plant.

380
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:31,096
Actually, it oughta be pretty interesting.

381
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:33,707
Seeing how one of these
local operations is run.

382
00:22:33,707 --> 00:22:35,290
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

383
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:38,986
Ooh.

384
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:42,983
Give me about 15 minutes.

385
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:44,634
- Good.

386
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:46,886
See you in the lobby, champ.

387
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:49,803
(mysterious music)

388
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:12,839
- Kellers.

389
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:15,516
We're expected.

390
00:23:15,516 --> 00:23:18,433
(mysterious music)

391
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,615
- Not the best part of town, is it?

392
00:23:49,615 --> 00:23:52,138
- Serves the purpose.

393
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:52,971
Joseph.

394
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:12,001
- Good morning, gentlemen.

395
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:12,834
Frisk him.

396
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:20,823
- They don't take any chances, do they?

397
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:22,448
- Can't afford to.

398
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:23,615
- Right there.

399
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,702
- Trade secrets.

400
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:10,344
- [Thompsonn] Mister
Childress, they are all here.

401
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:13,094
- Good, let's get this over with.

402
00:25:13,932 --> 00:25:15,349
- This is Ashton.

403
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,891
That's Joseph.

404
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,850
- Gentlemen.

405
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,437
(grunting)

406
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:29,604
- Just get the coat off him,
and then we're finished here.

407
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,634
- I think I was clear on what will happen

408
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:34,389
if this is not the agreed upon amount.

409
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:36,139
- What are you doing?

410
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,806
- No.

411
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:39,639
No, buddy.

412
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:42,595
- It's too late for all that.

413
00:25:42,595 --> 00:25:43,529
Now listen to me.

414
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:45,159
Listen to me, listen.

415
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:45,992
Are you listening?

416
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:46,825
- Yeah.

417
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,436
- From this point on,
he's as good as dead.

418
00:25:51,436 --> 00:25:53,853
Do you understand, that's it.

419
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,107
Let me deal with this, okay?

420
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:57,940
- Okay.

421
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,788
- I need the coat.

422
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:04,621
- Take it.

423
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:13,642
- All right, he's all yours.

424
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:16,839
As far as we're concerned,
he never existed.

425
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,772
That's what we paid you for.

426
00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:21,189
- Agreed, now get outta here.

427
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:23,766
- Let's go.

428
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:31,725
- Show him the coat.

429
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:34,526
- Look, we really messed it up,

430
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,315
made it look like he was
in a fight or something.

431
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:38,226
- We're gonna show the coat to Dad,

432
00:26:38,226 --> 00:26:41,611
tell them that we found it, in an alley.

433
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:44,361
Let him draw his own conclusions.

434
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:47,530
- You idiots, what are we doing with this?

435
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,770
How come the police don't got it?

436
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,603
- What?

437
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:55,136
They look for it, but they're
not gonna find anything.

438
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:58,027
There's no blood, nothing.

439
00:26:58,027 --> 00:27:00,549
So they return it to the grieving family.

440
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:02,787
- The grieving family?

441
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,620
- Yeah.

442
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:08,296
- You don't feel anything, do you?

443
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:10,760
- Feel?

444
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:15,734
I feel we did what was
right for the family.

445
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,927
- Welcome to the presidential suite.

446
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:26,647
- Bye, Father, I'm sorry.

447
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:32,872
- Well?

448
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:35,547
- What he say?

449
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:36,784
- The boys can't handle this.

450
00:27:36,784 --> 00:27:38,809
I mean, they're not even making any sense.

451
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:40,888
They're all over the place.

452
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:42,937
- He said that he loves us,

453
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:45,851
and that he trusts that
we're doing everything

454
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:47,851
that we can to find Joe.

455
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,736
- That's perfect.

456
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,627
- Jacob, please, sit down.

457
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:57,675
- I gotta go there, talk to the police.

458
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:01,769
- If we leave tonight, we
could be in New York tomorrow.

459
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:04,021
- I can look for Joseph myself.

460
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:06,202
- Joseph is my son too.

461
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:08,285
(crying)

462
00:28:12,153 --> 00:28:12,986
- Mother?

463
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:15,439
- Rachel, are you all right?

464
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:17,106
- It's not the baby.

465
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:19,927
- I'm sorry, I'll be all right.

466
00:28:19,927 --> 00:28:21,163
- Shall I call the doctor?

467
00:28:21,163 --> 00:28:22,163
- No, don't.

468
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:24,245
- [Diane] Are you sure you're all right?

469
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,995
- Yes, darling, fine.

470
00:28:27,036 --> 00:28:28,036
- I'll stay.

471
00:28:28,994 --> 00:28:30,827
- No, don't stay.

472
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:32,660
Jacob, listen, you go.

473
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:35,514
I'm worried.

474
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,090
I'm frightened, I don't know why.

475
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,353
Not just about Joseph, about all the boys.

476
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,186
- Room service please.

477
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:46,827
(upbeat music)

478
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,450
(yelling)

479
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,283
Noooo!

480
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:26,188
- [Thompsonn] Easy.

481
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,849
- [Joseph] Let me go, let me go.

482
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,628
- Easy.

483
00:29:32,628 --> 00:29:33,461
- Your friends went to much trouble

484
00:29:33,461 --> 00:29:37,016
and expense to put you here,
and here you will stay.

485
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:38,711
Now you have a choice.

486
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:42,258
Stay put, do what you're told
and keep your mouth shut,

487
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:43,756
and you'll survive.

488
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:46,506
Otherwise, in here you're nobody.

489
00:29:48,185 --> 00:29:50,976
Out there, you're as good as dead.

490
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,811
I can and will do whatever is necessary

491
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:56,161
to maintain the status quo, understood?

492
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,164
- You can't just make me disappear.

493
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:01,020
- I already did, happens all the time.

494
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,305
- These friends of mine, they
didn't tell you, did they?

495
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:06,198
- Tell me what?

496
00:30:06,198 --> 00:30:08,706
- They're my brothers.

497
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:12,363
Puts you in a rather uncomfortable
position, doesn't it?

498
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:13,196
- No.

499
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:15,768
Get him outta here.

500
00:30:21,582 --> 00:30:24,520
- You said that no deceased person fitting

501
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,556
his description has come in
in the last couple of days,

502
00:30:27,556 --> 00:30:30,389
and that you've checked hospitals.

503
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:34,804
Because you see, he sometimes has,

504
00:30:34,804 --> 00:30:37,198
I don't know, I mean,
something like a lapse.

505
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:39,181
- Maybe we should just go
out and start looking again.

506
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:40,922
We did come up with his coat.

507
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,169
- Maybe he was epileptic, you
know, maybe it was epilepsy.

508
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:45,903
You asked me that 10 times,
I already told you that.

509
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:47,049
Last time I saw him was in the morning.

510
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:48,837
- I remember what he had for breakfast.

511
00:30:48,837 --> 00:30:51,101
We'd always get together as a family,

512
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:51,934
have our breakfast together.

513
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,384
- I just turned back, and
I looked, I didn't see him.

514
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:55,901
I figured, well, he just
stepped into the shop.

515
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:59,484
So I went back, maybe
I don't know, two or.

516
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:04,572
- Please, God, where is my son?

517
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:09,013
(dramatic music)

518
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:15,754
- Everyone works.

519
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:19,486
(speaking foreign language)

520
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,118
No one looks up at me.

521
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:22,987
You don't wanna see my dirty face.

522
00:31:22,987 --> 00:31:24,629
Nobody wants to look at my dirty face.

523
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:26,574
Everyone look at the machines.

524
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:28,491
No one wants to see me.

525
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:30,963
And nobody talks.

526
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:37,128
(speaking foreign language)

527
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:40,854
Everyone works, everyone, everyone.

528
00:31:40,854 --> 00:31:42,033
- You okay?

529
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:42,950
Let me see.

530
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:46,625
Who did this to you?

531
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,625
Huh, he did?

532
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:52,509
- Mr. Childress wants to see you.

533
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:54,842
- This woman needs a doctor.

534
00:31:55,738 --> 00:31:57,763
- She's lucky she can still walk.

535
00:31:57,763 --> 00:31:59,202
- No one deserves that.

536
00:31:59,202 --> 00:32:00,902
Look, look at her face.

537
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:03,735
- Maybe you want some of the same.

538
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:08,078
I said Mr. Childress wants to see you.

539
00:32:08,078 --> 00:32:10,411
- I said she needs a doctor.

540
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:14,085
- Now.

541
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:22,301
- One of the women has been beaten.

542
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:24,079
She needs help.

543
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,396
- That's not your concern.

544
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:27,275
She tried to smuggle a letter out.

545
00:32:27,275 --> 00:32:28,659
I can't allow that.

546
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:29,779
- So what?

547
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,469
She's hurt, she needs help.

548
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:32,618
- I suggest you drop the subject,

549
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:35,785
or do you need Thompsonn's assistance?

550
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:39,908
All right then.

551
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,921
I've been doing a little checking.

552
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,640
It seems that your family owns

553
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,463
quite a successful little firm.

554
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:48,400
- Yeah, it's my father's.

555
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,503
So?

556
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:51,403
- Did you work there?

557
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,608
- I started to.

558
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:54,351
- How did that go?

559
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:58,896
- If you're asking me was I
good at my job, yes, I was.

560
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:02,235
- Well my accountant went skiing
and decided to hug a tree.

561
00:33:02,235 --> 00:33:03,755
He'll be laid up for a while.

562
00:33:03,755 --> 00:33:07,390
In the meantime, I've got books
to balance and bills to pay.

563
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,390
Think you can handle it?

564
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:13,613
- I've done it before.

565
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:14,613
- All right.

566
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:17,267
We'll see.

567
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:24,095
This is where you'll work.

568
00:33:24,095 --> 00:33:26,095
However, any phone calls

569
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:30,047
will be made by me.

570
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:33,175
There'll be no attempt
at outside communication.

571
00:33:33,175 --> 00:33:35,109
Let me be clear on this.

572
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:39,276
My back's against the wall,
and that's given you a chance.

573
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:44,112
Abuse it, and you'll live
just long enough to regret it.

574
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:45,204
- I understand.

575
00:33:45,204 --> 00:33:47,670
- Let me add a last word of caution.

576
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,165
You may understandably care
nothing for your brothers,

577
00:33:51,165 --> 00:33:52,719
but I'm sure you wish no harm

578
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:55,552
to come to your parents or sister.

579
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:57,995
- Don't touch them.

580
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:04,349
- You don't wanna test me on this.

581
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:05,486
- Don't touch them, okay?

582
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:07,365
Just don't touch them.

583
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:11,448
- I'll have no need to,
as long as you cooperate.

584
00:34:14,316 --> 00:34:18,316
("God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen")

585
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:29,911
- Dad.

586
00:34:29,911 --> 00:34:30,744
- Ashton.

587
00:34:30,744 --> 00:34:31,577
- What are you doing?

588
00:34:31,577 --> 00:34:32,660
- Look, look.

589
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,250
No blood, no blood.

590
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:38,629
- It's late, Mom'll be worried.

591
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:42,485
- There's no blood, but every time I dream

592
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:44,163
it's covered with blood.

593
00:34:44,163 --> 00:34:47,245
- Father, please, you're just,

594
00:34:47,245 --> 00:34:49,912
it was just a dream, that's all.

595
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:52,185
- How could it be?

596
00:34:52,185 --> 00:34:53,525
How could it be?

597
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:57,729
Three and a half months,
and no trace, nothing.

598
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,250
Why can't they find my son?

599
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,003
The police, the people I'm paying for,

600
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:02,623
why can't they find him?

601
00:35:02,623 --> 00:35:04,776
There's no blood, there's no blood.

602
00:35:04,776 --> 00:35:05,609
- You need some rest.

603
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:08,236
- [Jacob] There's no blood.

604
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:10,262
- Will you please get some sleep?

605
00:35:10,262 --> 00:35:12,012
- No blood, no blood.

606
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:30,151
- Be careful with that material.

607
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:34,318
Bring it to the machine shop,
they're waiting for you.

608
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:37,434
- Mr. Childress?

609
00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:44,652
- I'm glad to see winter winding down.

610
00:35:44,652 --> 00:35:47,508
The gray and cold depress me.

611
00:35:47,508 --> 00:35:51,591
- Ah, we that have free
souls, it touches us not.

612
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:55,069
- What?

613
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:59,670
- Shakespeare, I used to read a bit.

614
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,087
- Let's sit down.

615
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,882
You did a good job on the accounting,

616
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:09,594
but that's not why you're here.

617
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:13,381
It seems that made in America
is less important these days.

618
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:16,916
That market is shrinking,
and my profits are dropping.

619
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,378
- Price versus quality.

620
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:20,728
That's the bottom line,
not where it's made.

621
00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:24,091
- My accountant had a few suggestions.

622
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:25,848
I'd like to hear yours.

623
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:27,098
- Oh, oh, okay.

624
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,955
Well, as a contractor,

625
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:36,437
you're just a hired hand
at the mercy of the market.

626
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:37,941
Supply and demand.

627
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:40,496
If I were you, I'd create my own demand.

628
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:41,761
- How so?

629
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:44,482
- Well, do some homework
on some current trends.

630
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:48,733
Then move towards design
and manufacturing.

631
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:49,767
You've already got the labor,

632
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:53,021
maybe even some untapped
talent if you check, you know.

633
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:55,372
- No, there's no way I can risk

634
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:57,214
calling attention to my business here.

635
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:59,378
- Oh, of course, of course.

636
00:36:59,378 --> 00:37:01,502
And that's why, that's why

637
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:04,777
you set up a legitimate arm
of business out of state.

638
00:37:04,777 --> 00:37:08,093
You know, kind of like a
front or something, you know.

639
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:11,676
Then you funnel your
products through that.

640
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,657
- And why would David help Goliath?

641
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:22,081
- A chance.

642
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:25,876
- Hi.

643
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:26,709
- [Woman] Hi.

644
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:29,151
- Remember the designs we talked about?

645
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:31,729
Did you think of a few.

646
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:33,705
Remember the designs we talked about?

647
00:37:33,705 --> 00:37:35,301
No, no?

648
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:37,552
Remember the designs we
talked about earlier?

649
00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:40,118
You think you can maybe write a few down?

650
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:40,951
No.

651
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:43,457
- Hi, Emily.

652
00:37:43,457 --> 00:37:46,996
Hi, remember the designs
we talked about earlier?

653
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:48,400
- Hello, Martha.

654
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,819
How are you?

655
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:52,326
Well, I came by to drop off a pad.

656
00:37:52,326 --> 00:37:53,979
I know you had a few designs

657
00:37:53,979 --> 00:37:57,545
you wanted to write down for me, right?

658
00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:58,378
Right?

659
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:00,056
Right?

660
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,789
Well, I'll tell you what.

661
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:04,622
I'll.

662
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:14,100
Bye, Martha.

663
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,850
(dramatic music)

664
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:31,658
- Joseph.

665
00:38:36,098 --> 00:38:37,506
Joseph.

666
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:40,256
(dramatic music)

667
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:59,874
(yelling)

668
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:03,577
- Mother, oh.

669
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:06,827
(church bells ringing)

670
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:14,760
- He's a beautiful baby, our Benjamin.

671
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,843
I wish you could see him.

672
00:39:17,965 --> 00:39:20,298
(footsteps)

673
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:27,338
But don't worry, Diane's
taking care of him.

674
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:29,250
Just the way you took care of her

675
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,500
when she was a little girl.

676
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:35,472
- Can I get you anything?

677
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:40,693
I miss Mama so much.

678
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:43,377
- So do I.

679
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,547
(machines running)

680
00:40:03,254 --> 00:40:06,122
- Thank you, thank you,
these are great, thank you.

681
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:07,167
Hi, Emily.

682
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:09,745
- Hi, I've got the designs for you.

683
00:40:09,745 --> 00:40:11,008
Do you like them?

684
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,682
- Ho ho, do I like these?

685
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:14,232
Mr. Childress is gonna love these.

686
00:40:14,232 --> 00:40:17,399
Thank you very much, Emily, thank you.

687
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:19,392
Hi, Martha.

688
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:22,429
Hello, I was just.

689
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:25,506
Oh, wow.

690
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:29,838
Wow.

691
00:40:31,455 --> 00:40:35,269
Martha, these are, these are fantastic.

692
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:38,352
Thank you, thank you very much.

693
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,185
Bravo.

694
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:41,019
Bravo.

695
00:40:42,628 --> 00:40:44,586
Look, everybody, Martha.

696
00:40:44,586 --> 00:40:45,753
Bravo, Martha.

697
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,706
(applause)

698
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:52,623
(triumphant music)

699
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:04,831
- Did you have a chance
to look at the sketches?

700
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:06,272
I may have found these
people down and out,

701
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:09,592
but, Mr. Childress, there
is definitely talent here.

702
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,425
- Maybe.

703
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:14,574
You know, my wife liked these.

704
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:15,657
- Oh, Martha.

705
00:41:16,947 --> 00:41:19,436
You know, she had dreams
of becoming a designer.

706
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:20,853
She even studied.

707
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:25,540
- If I establish this
legitimate front then disappear,

708
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,206
how do I know I won't be arrested

709
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:29,029
five minutes after I close down?

710
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:31,165
- Well, because the way this is set up,

711
00:41:31,165 --> 00:41:33,406
the authorities will never find you.

712
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:36,882
- Except through you,
another interesting problem.

713
00:41:36,882 --> 00:41:37,715
- No, no.

714
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,763
I, I give you my word.

715
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,095
If it doesn't work,
you can always go back.

716
00:41:45,095 --> 00:41:46,612
- Well the accountant thinks it'll work.

717
00:41:46,612 --> 00:41:48,940
I mean, if we're cautious.

718
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,591
And my wife, well, she
hates this place as it is.

719
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:53,996
I'll tell you what.

720
00:41:53,996 --> 00:41:57,137
Bring Martha and Emily to my office

721
00:41:57,137 --> 00:41:59,604
this Friday, and we'll talk.

722
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:01,241
- Okay.

723
00:42:01,241 --> 00:42:04,182
Okay, thank you very much, Mr. Childress.

724
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:06,970
(seagull calling)

725
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:11,137
- And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters.

726
00:42:12,177 --> 00:42:16,386
- And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters.

727
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:18,342
- And God said.

728
00:42:18,342 --> 00:42:21,279
- And God said, let there be light.

729
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:25,395
- You already know it
before I even say it.

730
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:26,228
And,

731
00:42:28,344 --> 00:42:29,424
and there was.

732
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,697
- And there was light.

733
00:42:31,697 --> 00:42:32,765
- Bravo.

734
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:33,993
- [Childress] I'll have
Dr. Russell take a look

735
00:42:33,993 --> 00:42:35,117
at the workers.

736
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:36,837
- Dr. Russell?

737
00:42:36,837 --> 00:42:39,124
Frank, I'm sure you could
find someone better.

738
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:42,217
- Nonsense, Russell's a fine doctor.

739
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:45,074
Joseph, this is my wife, Clara.

740
00:42:45,074 --> 00:42:48,357
Clara decided it was
finally time to take a look.

741
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,955
- Mrs. Childress, how are you?

742
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:52,295
Pleasure to meet you.

743
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:55,546
- Joe, or do you prefer Joseph?

744
00:42:55,546 --> 00:42:57,593
- Joe is fine, it doesn't matter.

745
00:42:57,593 --> 00:43:01,259
- I must say, you're not
at all what I expected.

746
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:04,974
All these improvements,
they're your ideas?

747
00:43:04,974 --> 00:43:09,035
- Well, let's call it
a cooperative effort.

748
00:43:09,035 --> 00:43:11,003
- With Frank out of town
so much more these days,

749
00:43:11,003 --> 00:43:13,400
I decided to check out the competition.

750
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,131
I'm impressed.

751
00:43:15,131 --> 00:43:18,290
- Clara has chosen some of
our more successful fashions.

752
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,856
She has a great sense of design.

753
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:23,794
She was a model, you know.

754
00:43:23,794 --> 00:43:26,133
- Well, I wish I could stay longer,

755
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:29,283
but my afternoon's completely booked, so.

756
00:43:29,283 --> 00:43:30,532
- [Childress] Well then,
let's finish the tour

757
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:31,868
and I'll show you out.

758
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:33,139
- I was a pleasure to meet you, Joe.

759
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:35,844
- [Joseph] Pleasure to
meet you, Mrs. Childress.

760
00:43:35,844 --> 00:43:38,344
- I'm sure I'll see you again.

761
00:43:51,356 --> 00:43:54,189
(classical music)

762
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,620
- Ah, come in, Joseph.

763
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,182
You remember Clara.

764
00:44:10,182 --> 00:44:12,310
- Mrs. Childress.

765
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,478
- She dropped by to talk over
some marketing ideas with me,

766
00:44:14,478 --> 00:44:17,752
but unfortunately, I've
got an appointment.

767
00:44:17,752 --> 00:44:19,824
- I thought I could stay
anyway, talk to you,

768
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,175
if that's all right.

769
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:22,830
- Of course.

770
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,078
- Good.

771
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,256
Listen to her, Joseph,
she has some great ideas.

772
00:44:26,256 --> 00:44:27,923
She'll surprise you.

773
00:44:29,464 --> 00:44:32,851
Fill me in when I get back this afternoon.

774
00:44:32,851 --> 00:44:33,768
- Yes, sir.

775
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:47,040
- I have a confession
to make, so they say.

776
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,019
I knew about Frank's appointment.

777
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,889
I wanted to speak to you alone.

778
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:51,722
- Oh?

779
00:44:54,552 --> 00:44:58,221
- I wanted to thank you for
everything you've done here.

780
00:44:58,221 --> 00:45:00,404
You've accomplished something I couldn't.

781
00:45:00,404 --> 00:45:02,528
- And what is that?

782
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:07,132
- I hated this place, hated
the way Frank made his money.

783
00:45:07,132 --> 00:45:09,396
When anybody would ask,
what does your husband do,

784
00:45:09,396 --> 00:45:12,396
I would hedge, evade, lie, anything.

785
00:45:15,705 --> 00:45:16,538
- So,

786
00:45:18,045 --> 00:45:21,212
what ideas do you have to help us now?

787
00:45:24,197 --> 00:45:25,364
- Take a seat.

788
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,410
Thanks again, Joe, thanks for listening.

789
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,716
- Any time.

790
00:45:34,716 --> 00:45:37,335
You have some workable ideas.

791
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:39,564
- I was thinking that next time we talk,

792
00:45:39,564 --> 00:45:43,645
maybe it could be somewhere
else, somewhere nice.

793
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:45,718
- If you mean away from
here, I doubt Mr. Childress

794
00:45:45,718 --> 00:45:47,051
would okay that.

795
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:51,039
- Let me work on that,
catch him in the right mood,

796
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,589
a little bit off guard.

797
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:57,508
- Well, I should be getting back to work.

798
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:58,912
Good day, Mrs. Childress.

799
00:45:58,912 --> 00:46:01,329
- Goodbye, Joe, thanks again.

800
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:15,034
- I'm really gonna miss you.

801
00:46:17,844 --> 00:46:18,677
Genuine.

802
00:46:19,766 --> 00:46:22,933
Bye, Frank, I'm really gonna miss you.

803
00:46:29,756 --> 00:46:33,837
Bye, Frank, I'm really
gonna miss you, hurry back.

804
00:46:33,837 --> 00:46:35,587
- I like these, I do.

805
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,818
I like those right there.

806
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:40,193
- [Martha] You think this is a good one.

807
00:46:40,193 --> 00:46:42,690
- [Joseph] Mrs. Childress, hi.

808
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:43,531
- [Clara] Hi.

809
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:44,814
- It's nice to see you.

810
00:46:44,814 --> 00:46:46,247
I didn't hear you were coming.

811
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:47,809
- Surprise inspection.

812
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:48,642
- Really?

813
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:49,475
- Hi, Martha.

814
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:50,316
- Oh, hello.

815
00:46:50,316 --> 00:46:52,691
- I've been hearing about all
these wonderful new designs.

816
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:53,524
May I look?

817
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:54,524
- Of course.

818
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,405
- They're wonderful.

819
00:46:57,405 --> 00:46:58,405
- Thank you.

820
00:47:01,794 --> 00:47:04,133
- Now, I have another surprise.

821
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:05,883
Can I whisk you away?

822
00:47:07,146 --> 00:47:08,146
- Of course.

823
00:47:11,242 --> 00:47:12,075
- Ta-da.

824
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:16,272
- Wow.

825
00:47:17,632 --> 00:47:19,299
What's all this for?

826
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:24,674
- Frank is being so stubborn
about not letting you go out,

827
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:25,507
so.

828
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:31,605
Well, we can stand here and stare at it

829
00:47:31,605 --> 00:47:34,540
until Frank gets back, or we can dig in.

830
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,721
What'll it be?

831
00:47:35,721 --> 00:47:37,235
- I vote we dig in.

832
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:38,989
- Good decision.

833
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,421
- What about Mr. Childress?

834
00:47:41,421 --> 00:47:43,185
Why isn't he here?

835
00:47:43,185 --> 00:47:46,176
- Frank is out of town again.

836
00:47:46,176 --> 00:47:49,843
I'm so glad I have you
to talk to sometimes.

837
00:47:51,085 --> 00:47:53,229
Well, shall I do the honors, or shall you?

838
00:47:53,229 --> 00:47:54,312
- I'll do it.

839
00:47:56,787 --> 00:47:59,904
- And do me a favor, please.

840
00:47:59,904 --> 00:48:02,569
Take off that appalling tie.

841
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:05,716
I promise I'll buy you a replacement,

842
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,883
one that won't ruin my sense of taste.

843
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:20,521
- I have, I've got to thank you.

844
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:26,237
I haven't eaten like that
in a very long, long time.

845
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,576
Your husband missed out on
a very enjoyable afternoon,

846
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:29,984
I must say.

847
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:31,569
- I'm not sure he would
have appreciated it

848
00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:32,902
the way you did.

849
00:48:35,157 --> 00:48:38,555
Too bad this place isn't
a little more comfortable.

850
00:48:38,555 --> 00:48:41,816
- But still the company is good.

851
00:48:41,816 --> 00:48:42,649
- I agree.

852
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:46,042
I'm glad you think so too.

853
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:51,068
Look, even your place has
got to be a little better.

854
00:48:52,177 --> 00:48:55,177
Let's go there a while, relax, talk.

855
00:48:57,015 --> 00:49:01,015
- Uh, I don't think that'll
be a very good idea.

856
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:03,806
- Why not, Joe?

857
00:49:03,806 --> 00:49:04,642
Where's the harm?

858
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,036
We're friends, aren't we?

859
00:49:06,036 --> 00:49:07,758
- Of course, but.

860
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:08,972
- But I'm married.

861
00:49:08,972 --> 00:49:10,369
- [Joseph] Yes.

862
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:13,977
- To the man who basically owns you.

863
00:49:13,977 --> 00:49:15,275
So what?

864
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:17,567
I can help you, Joe.

865
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,097
I can help you get out of here.

866
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:21,584
- Stop, please stop.

867
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,733
Clara, listen to me, just go home.

868
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:25,813
Go home to Frank.

869
00:49:25,813 --> 00:49:29,662
He loves you, and needs
you very very much.

870
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:30,662
I know this.

871
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:33,633
- But I need you.

872
00:49:36,254 --> 00:49:37,087
- No, no.

873
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:39,109
I can't.

874
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:43,036
I can't do this, okay, I can't.

875
00:49:45,602 --> 00:49:48,352
(dramatic music)

876
00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:54,392
(door opening and closing)

877
00:50:01,025 --> 00:50:03,442
- Frank, I'm just so shocked.

878
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:07,260
He just grabbed me.

879
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,860
I didn't know what to do.

880
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,943
No, he won't go for that.

881
00:50:12,995 --> 00:50:14,458
Oh God.

882
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,208
(dramatic music)

883
00:50:31,552 --> 00:50:34,036
So I just thought I'd
be nice and have lunch

884
00:50:34,036 --> 00:50:36,579
and had a glass of wine,
and I think he must have

885
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:39,179
just thought I was coming
on to him or something,

886
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:43,346
because, all of a sudden, he
leaned over and kissed me.

887
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:50,657
(dramatic music)

888
00:50:50,657 --> 00:50:54,824
And then he put his hands on
my breasts, my breasts, Frank.

889
00:50:59,713 --> 00:51:00,630
- You scum.

890
00:51:01,604 --> 00:51:03,452
I trusted you.

891
00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:04,285
Come here.

892
00:51:06,556 --> 00:51:07,723
She's my wife.

893
00:51:08,692 --> 00:51:10,029
You might have gotten
outta here in a few years,

894
00:51:10,029 --> 00:51:11,629
but not where you're going now.

895
00:51:11,629 --> 00:51:13,743
I got a doctor I want you to meet.

896
00:51:13,743 --> 00:51:15,294
Sedate him.

897
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:18,044
(dramatic music)

898
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:29,035
- I didn't do anything.

899
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:33,963
Mrs. Childress, I.

900
00:51:35,768 --> 00:51:37,556
- He's here.

901
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:41,723
No no, the papers are ready,
all I need is the money.

902
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:45,941
Schizophrenia, acute onset.

903
00:51:45,941 --> 00:51:49,135
Yeah, we'll keep him
drugged up for a while.

904
00:51:49,135 --> 00:51:53,148
Any claims he makes later
on'll just sound delusional,

905
00:51:53,148 --> 00:51:57,315
paranoid, just what the
doctor ordered, so to speak.

906
00:51:58,864 --> 00:52:01,197
(dial tone)

907
00:52:10,314 --> 00:52:12,647
(screaming)

908
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,780
(drawer opening)

909
00:52:41,118 --> 00:52:43,658
- [Parker] I really hope you're Forrester.

910
00:52:43,658 --> 00:52:45,266
- John Forrester.

911
00:52:45,266 --> 00:52:46,705
- Parker.

912
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,197
- You look desperate.

913
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:51,686
- A week alone on this ward,
I'm starting to talk to myself.

914
00:52:51,686 --> 00:52:54,049
Pretty soon they'll think
I'm one of the patients.

915
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:56,701
- If by they you mean
the doctors, I doubt it.

916
00:52:56,701 --> 00:52:59,459
For a psych hospital,
the presence of doctors

917
00:52:59,459 --> 00:53:01,530
is noticeably lacking.

918
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,331
- You catch on fast.

919
00:53:03,331 --> 00:53:04,915
Now let me show you
around our little place,

920
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:07,748
introduce you to our group.

921
00:53:07,748 --> 00:53:08,915
This is Alice.

922
00:53:09,911 --> 00:53:10,994
Hello, Alice.

923
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:13,645
- Most of them been here a while?

924
00:53:13,645 --> 00:53:17,168
- Yeah, once they get
here, they seldom leave.

925
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:18,348
Like Lydia here.

926
00:53:18,348 --> 00:53:19,991
She'll probably die here.

927
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:21,744
She hasn't said more
than a couple of words

928
00:53:21,744 --> 00:53:23,512
in a couple of years.

929
00:53:23,512 --> 00:53:27,345
No one seems to be able
to get through to her.

930
00:53:28,337 --> 00:53:32,128
And watching television,
we have Mr. Martinez.

931
00:53:32,128 --> 00:53:32,961
- Shh.

932
00:53:33,998 --> 00:53:35,932
This is a good plot.

933
00:53:35,932 --> 00:53:38,530
- [Parker] And he's fine,
until he gets a message.

934
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:40,917
- [Forrester] From the TV?

935
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,424
- Just restrain him, get
him back to his room.

936
00:53:43,424 --> 00:53:46,591
The nurses will take care of sedation.

937
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,800
- Who's this guy?

938
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,048
- [Parker] That's Carl.

939
00:53:51,048 --> 00:53:54,548
- I ask you very politely
just to keep quiet, okay?

940
00:53:54,548 --> 00:53:55,381
- Sorry.

941
00:53:57,677 --> 00:54:00,603
Carl has spent every
morning since he got here

942
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:02,809
staring at the chess board.

943
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:04,226
He's yet to move.

944
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,663
- What if somebody else moved first?

945
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:10,431
- No, no, wouldn't wanna do
that, apoplexy, you know.

946
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,166
- Oh, got it.

947
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,924
- And here's our newest arrival.

948
00:54:14,924 --> 00:54:17,025
According to his chart,
acute schizophrenia.

949
00:54:17,025 --> 00:54:18,587
- Hey!

950
00:54:18,587 --> 00:54:20,793
Now that's twice.

951
00:54:20,793 --> 00:54:23,910
- He was really out of it for
the first couple of weeks.

952
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,889
Delusions, hallucinations, most of it

953
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:28,556
was probably the meds he was on.

954
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:31,867
Here, watch this.

955
00:54:34,597 --> 00:54:35,681
- Whose move?

956
00:54:35,681 --> 00:54:36,818
- Mine.

957
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:40,837
- He'll sit with him every
morning for a little while.

958
00:54:40,837 --> 00:54:42,550
- Does he know?

959
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,628
- That Carl won't move?

960
00:54:44,628 --> 00:54:47,745
Yeah, yeah, I think he does.

961
00:54:47,745 --> 00:54:51,578
He just doesn't talk
much, paranoid, you know?

962
00:54:57,332 --> 00:54:59,163
- [Forrester] What's his name?

963
00:54:59,163 --> 00:55:00,673
- [Parker] Well he calls himself Joseph,

964
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,644
and the name on the
chart's something else.

965
00:55:03,644 --> 00:55:08,219
I call him Joe, he seems
to be all right with that.

966
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:09,401
And over here.

967
00:55:09,401 --> 00:55:12,318
(mysterious music)

968
00:55:15,436 --> 00:55:17,186
- I'll be back, Carl.

969
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:21,134
I'll be back.

970
00:55:33,422 --> 00:55:36,255
(woman screaming)

971
00:55:37,856 --> 00:55:39,002
(crying)

972
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:39,935
- What am I gonna do?

973
00:55:39,935 --> 00:55:43,715
What am I gonna do, how do I save myself.

974
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,774
How do I save myself?

975
00:55:45,774 --> 00:55:48,081
Are you listening?

976
00:55:48,081 --> 00:55:50,048
Are you listening?

977
00:55:50,048 --> 00:55:51,504
(laughing)

978
00:55:51,504 --> 00:55:55,161

979
00:55:55,161 --> 00:55:59,369

982
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:10,448
- Do you think he'll move today, Joe?

983
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,763
You know, I think you're wearing him down.

984
00:56:19,763 --> 00:56:21,346
- Please, shh, shh.

985
00:56:38,752 --> 00:56:40,325
Yeah?

986
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:41,325
- The paper.

987
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:47,547
- Joe, it's just the financial section.

988
00:56:47,547 --> 00:56:50,547
- I know, that's why I'm interested.

989
00:56:52,116 --> 00:56:53,449
- Yeah, take it.

990
00:56:56,848 --> 00:56:59,010
I don't need it back, I'm finished.

991
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,347
- Thank you.

992
00:57:00,347 --> 00:57:05,347

995
00:57:13,512 --> 00:57:16,262
(dramatic music)

996
00:57:28,956 --> 00:57:30,845
- He came to me, he came to me last night.

997
00:57:30,845 --> 00:57:33,196
He came to my room, and
I told him, in my dreams,

998
00:57:33,196 --> 00:57:34,425
I told him everything.

999
00:57:34,425 --> 00:57:37,573
But I've still got the
moves, I've got the moves.

1000
00:57:37,573 --> 00:57:38,653
- What's this?

1001
00:57:38,653 --> 00:57:40,162
- Night school.

1002
00:57:40,162 --> 00:57:41,489
It's killing me.

1003
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:44,220
- Man, I'd help you, but you're set

1004
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,304
on passing the class, right?

1005
00:57:46,304 --> 00:57:50,054
- Passing, graduating
and getting outta here.

1006
00:57:51,644 --> 00:57:53,227
I need some coffee.

1007
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:56,764
- [Carl] Frank?

1008
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:57,597
- [Parker] Yeah.

1009
00:57:57,597 --> 00:57:58,825
- You just go ahead, you keep on living

1010
00:57:58,825 --> 00:58:00,030
in your world of your dreams.

1011
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,378
But you're a prisoner
of all of those dreams.

1012
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:02,819
You don't wanna die, do you wanna die?

1013
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:05,056
I don't wanna die.

1014
00:58:05,056 --> 00:58:07,025
- [Joseph] Don't move here, Carl.

1015
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,587
- I can move, I can move if I want.

1016
00:58:08,587 --> 00:58:09,615
You can't tell me not to move.

1017
00:58:09,615 --> 00:58:10,448
Look, see.

1018
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:15,485
Why can't I kill God inside me?

1019
00:58:15,485 --> 00:58:17,023
Why does he go on living like this?

1020
00:58:17,023 --> 00:58:20,379
It's humiliating, it's
painful, I wanna rip him out.

1021
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:22,845
But still here he is, and he's crazy,

1022
00:58:22,845 --> 00:58:24,262
and he is afraid.

1023
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:28,609
(dramatic music)

1024
00:58:30,044 --> 00:58:31,461
But I gotta move.

1025
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:43,498
- You almost had it.

1026
00:58:46,511 --> 00:58:48,094
- I've got to move.

1027
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,291
I got the moves.

1028
00:58:56,512 --> 00:58:57,845
I got the moves.

1029
00:58:59,694 --> 00:59:02,611
♪ I got the moves. ♪

1030
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:06,311
Can't touch me now.

1031
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:08,811
- He's got a point there, Joe.

1032
00:59:10,936 --> 00:59:14,477
- [Parker] Joe, okay if I come in?

1033
00:59:14,477 --> 00:59:17,394
- Yeah, of course, what's going on?

1034
00:59:19,034 --> 00:59:22,198
- I brought you a couple more journals.

1035
00:59:22,198 --> 00:59:23,198
- Thank you.

1036
00:59:24,097 --> 00:59:25,761
- You know that assignment
you helped me with

1037
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:27,730
the other day?

1038
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,195
You were dead on with those
market predictions, thanks.

1039
00:59:31,195 --> 00:59:34,558
- Oh, just some minor
adjustments, you know.

1040
00:59:34,558 --> 00:59:36,808
- I'd have gotten it wrong.

1041
00:59:37,877 --> 00:59:39,960
- Is there anything else?

1042
00:59:40,982 --> 00:59:43,469
- I've been going to school
for a long time, Joe.

1043
00:59:43,469 --> 00:59:46,934
I work hard, I'm a good student.

1044
00:59:46,934 --> 00:59:50,667
- But a little extra help wouldn't hurt.

1045
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,145
- You see things differently.

1046
00:59:52,145 --> 00:59:54,806
I can't learn that in school.

1047
00:59:54,806 --> 00:59:58,389
- Sure, I seem to have
a little extra time.

1048
01:00:00,994 --> 01:00:02,244
- Morning, Joe.

1049
01:00:07,879 --> 01:00:10,546
- So how'd you sleep last night?

1050
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,426
- What's sleep?

1051
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:16,958
These tests, I've been
having these dreams,

1052
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:18,647
over and over.

1053
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:19,814
I'm exhausted.

1054
01:00:21,189 --> 01:00:22,772
- What's the dream?

1055
01:00:25,001 --> 01:00:25,834
- Really?

1056
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:31,572
Okay.

1057
01:00:34,226 --> 01:00:37,130
It's like I know I'm
awake, but I'm asleep.

1058
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:40,965
It's pitch black, I can't
see anything out there,

1059
01:00:40,965 --> 01:00:44,056
but I know that there's
something in the room with me.

1060
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:46,056
And I'm scared, I panic.

1061
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:50,189
And I know if I get on the
other side of the door,

1062
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:51,272
I'll be safe.

1063
01:00:52,326 --> 01:00:55,915
And I'm fighting to find the door.

1064
01:00:55,915 --> 01:00:58,165
And I walk through the door

1065
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,765
and into this light, and there's somebody

1066
01:01:02,765 --> 01:01:04,265
sitting at a desk.

1067
01:01:08,493 --> 01:01:11,205
And he looks up, and it's me.

1068
01:01:11,205 --> 01:01:12,622
It's me, it's me.

1069
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:19,348
That is kid stuff, right?

1070
01:01:19,348 --> 01:01:21,348
- No, no, not kid stuff.

1071
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:26,859
You know dreams, dreams are a,

1072
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,115
a kind of a communication.

1073
01:01:31,115 --> 01:01:32,914
- Well, whatever this one's communicating,

1074
01:01:32,914 --> 01:01:34,952
it's making me jumpy.

1075
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:39,363
- It's the future that
frightens you, the unknown.

1076
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:40,282
Don't let it.

1077
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:43,127
You're not going into it alone.

1078
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:46,933
Study, prepare, kinda like
what you're doing now,

1079
01:01:46,933 --> 01:01:48,600
and you'll be ready.

1080
01:01:49,778 --> 01:01:51,111
It's not so bad.

1081
01:01:54,154 --> 01:01:55,904
So where we starting?

1082
01:01:57,563 --> 01:02:00,313
(dramatic music)

1083
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:21,509
You need me to read you something?

1084
01:02:21,509 --> 01:02:22,342
Oh.

1085
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:26,623
Yeah, you like this one, don't you?

1086
01:02:28,196 --> 01:02:29,863
I like this one too.

1087
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:32,582
Okay.

1088
01:02:33,446 --> 01:02:36,134
(clearing throat)

1089
01:02:36,134 --> 01:02:39,217
To suffer woes, which hope has taken.

1090
01:02:42,189 --> 01:02:45,857
To forgive wrongs, darker
than death or night.

1091
01:02:45,857 --> 01:02:49,024
To defy power, which seems omnipotent.

1092
01:02:50,728 --> 01:02:52,145
To love and bear.

1093
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:55,619
To hope til hope creates

1094
01:02:58,129 --> 01:03:01,962
from its own wreck, the
thing it contemplates.

1095
01:03:03,451 --> 01:03:05,118
This is alone, life.

1096
01:03:07,928 --> 01:03:09,548
Joy.

1097
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:12,326
(dramatic music)

1098
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:13,326
And victory.

1099
01:03:29,304 --> 01:03:30,137
- Wow.

1100
01:03:32,632 --> 01:03:35,975
- Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, congratulate me.

1101
01:03:35,975 --> 01:03:38,539
- All right, congratulations,
I take it it's good news.

1102
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:41,832
- I not only passed, I
graduated and I got a job.

1103
01:03:41,832 --> 01:03:44,141
A really good job.

1104
01:03:44,141 --> 01:03:45,716
I'm outta here a week from Friday.

1105
01:03:45,716 --> 01:03:46,742
- Didn't I tell you?

1106
01:03:46,742 --> 01:03:49,396
- Well I owe a lot to you.

1107
01:03:49,396 --> 01:03:50,790
- Nah.

1108
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:54,637
You did all the necessary
work, that's what's important.

1109
01:03:54,637 --> 01:03:55,970
Congratulations.

1110
01:03:57,471 --> 01:03:58,304
- Thanks.

1111
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:01,882
Oh, and Forrester wants to talk to you.

1112
01:04:01,882 --> 01:04:06,066
Seems he's been having his own
little weird dreams lately.

1113
01:04:06,066 --> 01:04:08,609
You're getting famous.

1114
01:04:08,609 --> 01:04:11,859
- I had the creepiest dream last night.

1115
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,757
I was in a black room, all
dark, with white furniture.

1116
01:04:17,757 --> 01:04:19,963
And there was a gold chest

1117
01:04:19,963 --> 01:04:22,467
in the center of the room.

1118
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,884
And Marcel Marceau was there.

1119
01:04:29,724 --> 01:04:32,411
And he was doing a mime of a snake

1120
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:34,901
with his left arm and hand.

1121
01:04:34,901 --> 01:04:37,651
(dramatic music)

1122
01:04:52,205 --> 01:04:53,622
Then he vanished.

1123
01:04:56,963 --> 01:04:58,880
And I opened the chest.

1124
01:05:01,226 --> 01:05:03,809
(lid creaking)

1125
01:05:05,299 --> 01:05:07,549
And there was a real snake.

1126
01:05:08,865 --> 01:05:11,093
And then there was a flash of light.

1127
01:05:11,093 --> 01:05:13,426
(explosion)

1128
01:05:27,745 --> 01:05:30,578
- The conquest is dragged happily.

1129
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:34,400
Ho ho ho ho ho.

1130
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:39,483
Look at you, you look ready for the world.

1131
01:05:39,483 --> 01:05:42,226
- I just wanted to say thanks and goodbye.

1132
01:05:42,226 --> 01:05:43,376
- Oh.

1133
01:05:43,376 --> 01:05:45,938
Any time, you know that.

1134
01:05:45,938 --> 01:05:49,630
I'm truly sorry about what
happened to Forrester.

1135
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:50,463
- Me too.

1136
01:05:51,485 --> 01:05:53,818
They said he died instantly.

1137
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,333
You knew what was gonna
happen, though, didn't you?

1138
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,269
- No, not exactly.

1139
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:03,298
Not about the car going off
the road and the explosion.

1140
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:06,706
- His dream was what, a warning.

1141
01:06:06,706 --> 01:06:07,623
- In a way.

1142
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:11,635
He was being given time to prepare.

1143
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:15,088
- He was so sure you were wrong.

1144
01:06:15,088 --> 01:06:16,505
Well, I gotta go.

1145
01:06:17,528 --> 01:06:18,361
Joe.

1146
01:06:20,878 --> 01:06:22,939
You don't belong here.

1147
01:06:22,939 --> 01:06:24,189
I believe that.

1148
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,483
I won't forget you.

1149
01:06:33,097 --> 01:06:35,847
(dramatic music)

1150
01:07:04,067 --> 01:07:06,125
- Mr. Saunders.

1151
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:09,882
We finished the loan reports,
and we're in very good shape.

1152
01:07:09,882 --> 01:07:12,333
- That's great, Parker.

1153
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,833
- By the way, sir.

1154
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:19,437
There's a wonderful article on
you in the news this morning.

1155
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,036
- Yeah, it's not bad.

1156
01:07:23,652 --> 01:07:26,439
Parker, I do need your help on something.

1157
01:07:26,439 --> 01:07:27,351
- Sure.

1158
01:07:27,351 --> 01:07:31,774
- You've been tracking
business and market trends.

1159
01:07:31,774 --> 01:07:32,607
- Of course.

1160
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:35,361
- Have you noticed anything
unusual in the market,

1161
01:07:35,361 --> 01:07:36,522
trouble signs?

1162
01:07:36,522 --> 01:07:38,849
- No, I, do you think
I've missed something?

1163
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:42,016
- It's nothing I can put my finger on.

1164
01:07:44,406 --> 01:07:45,600
It's just a hunch.

1165
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,433
- Based on anything in particular?

1166
01:07:51,596 --> 01:07:53,596
- It's nothing tangible.

1167
01:07:56,803 --> 01:07:59,672
This is gonna sound ridiculous.

1168
01:07:59,672 --> 01:08:03,005
The last few nights, I've had this dream

1169
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:06,398
that I'm missing something.

1170
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:08,881
It's disturbing.

1171
01:08:12,124 --> 01:08:16,130
- I don't know what to
tell you, except that

1172
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,416
I'll look harder at the market.

1173
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,249
- Okay.

1174
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:23,926
I'll see you in the morning.

1175
01:08:23,926 --> 01:08:25,009
- Good night.

1176
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:28,014
- Good night.

1177
01:08:32,388 --> 01:08:35,055
(phone dialing)

1178
01:08:36,819 --> 01:08:38,569
- Yes, for Graymount.

1179
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:43,657
Graymount Psychiatric Hospital please.

1180
01:08:43,657 --> 01:08:46,407
(dramatic music)

1181
01:09:32,008 --> 01:09:34,591
(horn honking)

1182
01:09:41,371 --> 01:09:45,441
- To defy power, which seems omnipotent.

1183
01:09:45,441 --> 01:09:46,858
To love and bear.

1184
01:09:49,546 --> 01:09:51,629
To hope til hope creates,

1185
01:09:52,744 --> 01:09:56,577
from its own wreck, the
thing it contemplates.

1186
01:10:20,242 --> 01:10:22,992
(dramatic music)

1187
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:38,943
- Good morning, sir.

1188
01:10:40,844 --> 01:10:42,464
- Good morning.

1189
01:10:42,464 --> 01:10:44,318
Have a seat, have a seat.

1190
01:10:44,318 --> 01:10:45,318
- Thank you.

1191
01:10:46,727 --> 01:10:48,933
- What did you wanna talk to me about?

1192
01:10:48,933 --> 01:10:53,174
- Well, I was thinking about
our conversation last night.

1193
01:10:53,174 --> 01:10:56,514
There is someone I know that
I think could be useful.

1194
01:10:56,514 --> 01:10:59,847
He helped me, he's incredibly intuitive.

1195
01:11:01,464 --> 01:11:03,321
And he taught me a lot.

1196
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:06,853
- And the weekday weeps
that it should be so.

1197
01:11:06,853 --> 01:11:09,686
- [Nurse] This is for you to sign.

1198
01:11:17,152 --> 01:11:18,481
- I don't,

1199
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:20,222
I don't understand.

1200
01:11:20,222 --> 01:11:22,024
- You're being released.

1201
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:24,967
Tomorrow afternoon, four p.m.

1202
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:27,717
Here, someone sent these for you.

1203
01:11:28,683 --> 01:11:30,784
- But who, who signed this?

1204
01:11:30,784 --> 01:11:32,438
Who's Dr. Wyatt?

1205
01:11:32,438 --> 01:11:34,296
- You haven't heard.

1206
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:38,098
Dr. Russell's gone, lost his license.

1207
01:11:38,098 --> 01:11:40,304
- I can't believe this.

1208
01:11:40,304 --> 01:11:41,387
Are you sure?

1209
01:11:42,475 --> 01:11:43,558
- Absolutely.

1210
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:47,592
I'll come back for this later.

1211
01:11:47,592 --> 01:11:50,342
(dramatic music)

1212
01:12:08,797 --> 01:12:09,630
- Lydia.

1213
01:12:12,339 --> 01:12:14,041
- Til hope creates.

1214
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:16,357
- Lydia, you're talking.

1215
01:12:16,357 --> 01:12:18,690
- The thing it contemplates.

1216
01:12:20,844 --> 01:12:22,427
This is to be free.

1217
01:12:28,443 --> 01:12:29,276
- Lydia.

1218
01:12:37,444 --> 01:12:40,361
(triumphant music)

1219
01:12:46,685 --> 01:12:48,018
- Joe, you okay?

1220
01:12:49,092 --> 01:12:51,342
(giggling)

1221
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:57,419
- I've been locked up so
long, I forget how it smells.

1222
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:58,502
How it feels.

1223
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:07,000
I can walk through that door,
and no one will stop me.

1224
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,833
It's gonna take a little
time getting used to.

1225
01:13:12,324 --> 01:13:13,157
Thank you.

1226
01:13:14,427 --> 01:13:15,260
Thank you.

1227
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:19,551
(dramatic music)

1228
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:32,076
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

1229
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:33,649
- Nice meeting you.

1230
01:13:33,649 --> 01:13:35,899
- [Joseph] It's a pleasure.

1231
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:38,993
- Just relax.

1232
01:13:40,511 --> 01:13:42,761
- Have a seat, have a seat.

1233
01:13:44,818 --> 01:13:46,485
Is it Joe or Joseph?

1234
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:49,758
- Either is fine.

1235
01:13:52,492 --> 01:13:55,934
- Well, Joe, let's get down to business.

1236
01:13:55,934 --> 01:13:57,798
I went through a lotta
trouble to get you here.

1237
01:13:57,798 --> 01:13:59,353
- So I understand.

1238
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:02,910
I hope you will find
that, that it's worth it.

1239
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,077
- I expect to.

1240
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,881
As Mr. Parker no doubt told you,

1241
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:11,974
the holdings to my corporation
are extremely diversified.

1242
01:14:11,974 --> 01:14:13,956
And recently I had some misgivings.

1243
01:14:13,956 --> 01:14:16,071
That's why you're here.

1244
01:14:16,071 --> 01:14:19,154
He says you're something of a genius.

1245
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:22,417
- He said that?

1246
01:14:23,787 --> 01:14:26,037
Well, I do study the market

1247
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:30,350
and have a pretty good
handle on interpreting it.

1248
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:33,017
What are your concerns based on?

1249
01:14:35,827 --> 01:14:36,660
- Dreams.

1250
01:14:37,954 --> 01:14:41,811
Every night for a month now,
I've had this same dream.

1251
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,679
And I can't help feeling that it means

1252
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:46,762
something very important.

1253
01:14:49,268 --> 01:14:51,685
- Please, all I do is listen.

1254
01:14:52,969 --> 01:14:54,386
- All right then.

1255
01:14:56,388 --> 01:15:00,471
My dream always starts
right here in this office.

1256
01:15:08,562 --> 01:15:10,530
- His opinion of my dream
didn't make me happy,

1257
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:12,376
but it was honest.

1258
01:15:12,376 --> 01:15:15,772
He truly believes his
explanations come from God.

1259
01:15:15,772 --> 01:15:17,427
- Yes, yes, he does.

1260
01:15:17,427 --> 01:15:19,609
- I asked him, I said, why does God

1261
01:15:19,609 --> 01:15:22,771
talk to people that
don't wanna talk to him?

1262
01:15:22,771 --> 01:15:24,973
And you know what he said?

1263
01:15:24,973 --> 01:15:27,618
He said sometimes when people
don't wanna talk to God,

1264
01:15:27,618 --> 01:15:30,285
he jump-starts the conversation.

1265
01:15:31,759 --> 01:15:33,344
- That's a good thought.

1266
01:15:33,344 --> 01:15:35,051
How'd he explain your dream?

1267
01:15:35,051 --> 01:15:36,537
- It appears that the market is in

1268
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:39,204
for seven very prosperous years.

1269
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:42,737
And then seven very bad years.

1270
01:15:42,737 --> 01:15:44,263
The market's gonna take a dive.

1271
01:15:44,263 --> 01:15:45,389
- A crash.

1272
01:15:45,389 --> 01:15:47,222
- Exactly, nationwide.

1273
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:52,872
And Joe's idea is to prepare the people.

1274
01:15:52,872 --> 01:15:54,997
Help them stay afloat.

1275
01:15:54,997 --> 01:15:58,722
- Did Joe have any ideas
of what steps to take?

1276
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:01,241
- He had a solid plan.

1277
01:16:01,241 --> 01:16:03,658
This was a good call, Parker.

1278
01:16:12,839 --> 01:16:15,506
(siren wailing)

1279
01:16:19,892 --> 01:16:21,502
(phone dialing)

1280
01:16:21,502 --> 01:16:24,335
(phone ringing)

1281
01:16:24,335 --> 01:16:26,440
- [Jacob] Hello.

1282
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,440
Keller residence, hello.

1283
01:16:29,533 --> 01:16:31,153
Hello.

1284
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:32,153
Keller resi-

1285
01:16:37,981 --> 01:16:39,481
- Are we on, guys?

1286
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:44,157
Jane, I'm standing here
in the corridor of power,

1287
01:16:44,157 --> 01:16:47,431
where there's been yet another
downturn in the market.

1288
01:16:47,431 --> 01:16:49,951
Following a seven-year boom,
Wall Street now endures

1289
01:16:49,951 --> 01:16:54,042
its second straight year
of falling stock prices.

1290
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,256
Joseph Keller, the leading spokesman

1291
01:16:56,256 --> 01:16:59,362
for Silver Falcon Financial,
explains how while

1292
01:16:59,362 --> 01:17:01,779
other firms have managed to--

1293
01:17:06,844 --> 01:17:11,614
- Joe, I was looking forward
to your television debut.

1294
01:17:11,614 --> 01:17:13,468
What did you say?

1295
01:17:13,468 --> 01:17:17,102
- While other businesses were riding high,

1296
01:17:17,102 --> 01:17:20,353
James A. Saunders had the foresight

1297
01:17:20,353 --> 01:17:22,988
to prepare in the event of a downturn,

1298
01:17:22,988 --> 01:17:25,438
et cetera, et cetera, mumbo-jumbo.

1299
01:17:25,438 --> 01:17:27,406
- [Parker] The entire country's
just beginning to hurt,

1300
01:17:27,406 --> 01:17:31,011
and you still think there's
five more years of this?

1301
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:31,928
- Yes I do.

1302
01:17:33,809 --> 01:17:35,788
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

1303
01:17:35,788 --> 01:17:38,086
- Mr. Saunders, it's good to see you.

1304
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:41,260
- Joseph, do you have
that report on the crash?

1305
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,677
- Finished it this afternoon.

1306
01:17:45,552 --> 01:17:48,501
I analyzed all the different figures,

1307
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:50,166
from all the different departments.

1308
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,303
They confirmed that we are very stable.

1309
01:17:52,303 --> 01:17:54,581
- We did our homework.

1310
01:17:54,581 --> 01:17:55,616
- Yes, sir.

1311
01:17:55,616 --> 01:17:58,199
- And, Parker, good call again.

1312
01:18:01,601 --> 01:18:03,076
- [Parker] I'll make sure
that the executive directors

1313
01:18:03,076 --> 01:18:05,409
have a copy of that tonight.

1314
01:18:06,257 --> 01:18:07,811
- Thank you.

1315
01:18:07,811 --> 01:18:09,728
Keep it up, keep it up.

1316
01:18:13,513 --> 01:18:16,227
- Well, good night, everyone.

1317
01:18:16,227 --> 01:18:19,150
- Goodnight, Lydia, thank you.

1318
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:21,052
Well I'm gonna call it a day.

1319
01:18:21,052 --> 01:18:22,400
What about you, Joe?

1320
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,983
- In a few minutes.

1321
01:18:24,989 --> 01:18:27,825
- Oh, oh, I almost forget.

1322
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:30,310
There are some guys
waiting to see Mr. Saunders

1323
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:31,357
about a loan.

1324
01:18:31,357 --> 01:18:35,282
He'd asked me earlier if I would
ask you to take care of it.

1325
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:36,115
- Sure.

1326
01:18:37,578 --> 01:18:38,661
What company?

1327
01:18:39,601 --> 01:18:43,434
- [Parker] Keller
Manufacturing, any relation?

1328
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:45,124
- What?

1329
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:48,714
- Keller Manufacturing.

1330
01:18:48,714 --> 01:18:51,187
What's wrong, you know these guys?

1331
01:18:51,187 --> 01:18:52,020
- No.

1332
01:18:53,382 --> 01:18:54,715
No, no, nothing.

1333
01:18:57,884 --> 01:19:01,358
Uh, give me, give me five minutes please.

1334
01:19:01,358 --> 01:19:02,191
- Sure.

1335
01:19:05,758 --> 01:19:06,964
- Parker?

1336
01:19:06,964 --> 01:19:08,660
- [Parker] Yeah?

1337
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,493
- Did you,

1338
01:19:10,942 --> 01:19:12,677
did you give them my name?

1339
01:19:12,677 --> 01:19:15,242
- No, they were waiting to see Saunders.

1340
01:19:15,242 --> 01:19:16,575
- Don't, let me.

1341
01:19:17,705 --> 01:19:19,455
- Sure, five minutes.

1342
01:19:37,512 --> 01:19:38,512
- Thank you.

1343
01:19:41,354 --> 01:19:43,702
- Good evening, thanks
for seeing us so late.

1344
01:19:43,702 --> 01:19:44,606
I'm Robert Keller.

1345
01:19:44,606 --> 01:19:48,340
These are my brothers,
Simon, Justin, Ashton.

1346
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:50,644
We're from Keller Manufacturing.

1347
01:19:50,644 --> 01:19:51,646
Clothing.

1348
01:19:51,646 --> 01:19:54,144
- So you told my assistant.

1349
01:19:54,144 --> 01:19:55,394
- That's right.

1350
01:19:56,281 --> 01:19:59,948
We understand that you're
in the position, this bank,

1351
01:19:59,948 --> 01:20:03,943
this institution, of giving
rather substantial loans.

1352
01:20:03,943 --> 01:20:04,776
- Go on.

1353
01:20:06,293 --> 01:20:07,641
- Mr., I--

1354
01:20:07,641 --> 01:20:08,599
- [Joseph] Gray.

1355
01:20:08,599 --> 01:20:10,266
- Mr. Gray, we are a

1356
01:20:12,053 --> 01:20:15,136
proud foundation, 40 years, clothing.

1357
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,849
We have great references.

1358
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:22,357
- If it's such a successful company,

1359
01:20:22,357 --> 01:20:23,940
why do you need me?

1360
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,947
Or perhaps you're borrowing in panic.

1361
01:20:27,947 --> 01:20:30,953
Taking money from smaller
firms in real need.

1362
01:20:30,953 --> 01:20:31,786
- No.

1363
01:20:32,763 --> 01:20:37,026
And there's more than
just business at stake.

1364
01:20:37,026 --> 01:20:39,580
We have personal considerations.

1365
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:40,985
People.

1366
01:20:40,985 --> 01:20:43,168
- What my brother means to
say is that this is a business

1367
01:20:43,168 --> 01:20:46,251
that our father started 40 years ago.

1368
01:20:47,647 --> 01:20:50,830
And he's depending on us, Mr. Gray.

1369
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:54,160
- As are the workers and their families.

1370
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,903
And our own families, as well.

1371
01:20:56,903 --> 01:20:58,648
- With so much at stake,
why isn't your father

1372
01:20:58,648 --> 01:21:00,767
here to see me himself?

1373
01:21:00,767 --> 01:21:03,071
- He couldn't make it out here.

1374
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:04,404
It's his memory.

1375
01:21:05,465 --> 01:21:07,048
He's quite elderly.

1376
01:21:08,164 --> 01:21:12,331
- He hasn't traveled much
since the death of our mother.

1377
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,437
Stepmother.

1378
01:21:16,254 --> 01:21:17,254
- I'm sorry.

1379
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,837
May I ask how she died?

1380
01:21:21,968 --> 01:21:23,051
- Childbirth.

1381
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:27,238
That's our youngest brother, Ben.

1382
01:21:29,619 --> 01:21:32,286
- The death of a wife, a mother,

1383
01:21:35,186 --> 01:21:36,269
is very hard.

1384
01:21:38,031 --> 01:21:41,031
It's fortunate that the child lived.

1385
01:21:42,881 --> 01:21:46,348
Still, the man who
stands to lose the most,

1386
01:21:46,348 --> 01:21:47,789
meaning your father, should be here

1387
01:21:47,789 --> 01:21:50,744
to negotiate with me himself.

1388
01:21:50,744 --> 01:21:52,494
- He can't, he won't.

1389
01:21:53,554 --> 01:21:55,054
He hates New York.

1390
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:59,364
He lost a son here.

1391
01:21:59,364 --> 01:22:00,197
- Lost?

1392
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:06,451
- He disappeared.

1393
01:22:06,451 --> 01:22:09,656
A few months before our mother died.

1394
01:22:09,656 --> 01:22:12,627
He may have been murdered.

1395
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:15,496
- Yeah, and I was the one who was supposed

1396
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:17,496
to look after him, yeah.

1397
01:22:20,974 --> 01:22:22,724
- We're all to blame.

1398
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:24,474
All of us.

1399
01:22:27,588 --> 01:22:28,588
- It's late.

1400
01:22:29,873 --> 01:22:34,040
Give me your financial report,
and I will look it over.

1401
01:22:36,015 --> 01:22:37,700
- You may have some questions

1402
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,848
regarding some of the
family history with loans.

1403
01:22:39,848 --> 01:22:42,098
- I will give you my answer

1404
01:22:42,954 --> 01:22:44,420
tomorrow.

1405
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:46,726
- You've been most kind.

1406
01:22:46,726 --> 01:22:47,559
Thank you.

1407
01:22:53,272 --> 01:22:56,022
- Carl, please, please excuse me.

1408
01:23:08,876 --> 01:23:12,398
(dramatic music)

1409
01:23:12,398 --> 01:23:14,648
Why do you send them to me?

1410
01:23:16,435 --> 01:23:18,102
After all this time.

1411
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:20,283
I can

1412
01:23:22,152 --> 01:23:22,985
ruin them.

1413
01:23:26,007 --> 01:23:29,174
Destroy everything they've worked for.

1414
01:23:31,903 --> 01:23:34,570
And they wouldn't even know why.

1415
01:23:37,292 --> 01:23:38,125
My mother.

1416
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:43,249
Damn them.

1417
01:23:50,832 --> 01:23:51,665
19 years.

1418
01:23:55,545 --> 01:23:57,378
How do I forgive that?

1419
01:24:00,147 --> 01:24:02,397
How do I forgive any of it?

1420
01:24:04,659 --> 01:24:06,258
- This is a generous loan.

1421
01:24:06,258 --> 01:24:10,002
And the rates, they seem more than fair.

1422
01:24:10,002 --> 01:24:11,296
Justin.

1423
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,297
- Everything seems to be in order,

1424
01:24:14,297 --> 01:24:18,326
but I'm unclear on these
last two provisions.

1425
01:24:18,326 --> 01:24:22,070
- The first provision simply
means that for the duration

1426
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:25,368
of the loan, one of you will stay here

1427
01:24:25,368 --> 01:24:27,730
and be available for consultation.

1428
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:29,498
- That's unheard of.

1429
01:24:29,498 --> 01:24:32,264
- The second requires Jacob Keller,

1430
01:24:32,264 --> 01:24:35,706
as principal owner of
Keller Manufacturing,

1431
01:24:35,706 --> 01:24:37,036
to come to New York and sign the papers

1432
01:24:37,036 --> 01:24:41,203
in person, and all of his
sons will accompany him.

1433
01:24:42,637 --> 01:24:44,720
Those are the conditions.

1434
01:24:47,014 --> 01:24:49,981
- Mr. Gray, with all due respect,

1435
01:24:49,981 --> 01:24:53,020
Robert and Justin have power of attorney.

1436
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,966
Father's presence, it's uncalled for.

1437
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:58,799
- These are special circumstances.

1438
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:02,131
It is a requirement,

1439
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:05,393
if you wish a loan to save
your father's business.

1440
01:25:05,393 --> 01:25:06,606
- I'll stay.

1441
01:25:06,606 --> 01:25:07,837
- What?

1442
01:25:07,837 --> 01:25:09,524
- I said I'll stay.

1443
01:25:09,524 --> 01:25:10,593
- Why?

1444
01:25:10,593 --> 01:25:12,603
- I have my reasons.

1445
01:25:12,603 --> 01:25:14,855
Let's just say I owe it to Dad.

1446
01:25:14,855 --> 01:25:15,859
I'll be all right.

1447
01:25:15,859 --> 01:25:16,777
- [Robert] Are you sure?

1448
01:25:16,777 --> 01:25:18,419
- Yeah.

1449
01:25:18,419 --> 01:25:19,502
- Good, fine.

1450
01:25:22,777 --> 01:25:24,444
- Is this guy wacko?

1451
01:25:25,327 --> 01:25:26,621
He's certifiable.

1452
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,204
Nobody does business like this.

1453
01:25:30,151 --> 01:25:32,346
- It was the only way to get the money.

1454
01:25:32,346 --> 01:25:33,413
- Well return it.

1455
01:25:33,413 --> 01:25:35,051
We don't need it, not this way.

1456
01:25:35,051 --> 01:25:36,796
- Father, listen.

1457
01:25:36,796 --> 01:25:39,033
Please, we do need the money.

1458
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:40,809
Without it, we stand to lose everything.

1459
01:25:40,809 --> 01:25:42,162
- We'll get it someplace else.

1460
01:25:42,162 --> 01:25:44,600
- Don't you think we tried?

1461
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,682
Everyone's hurting now, Dad.

1462
01:25:46,682 --> 01:25:48,100
- But why keep Simon?

1463
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,630
And why would this man want Dad?

1464
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:50,508
- I don't know.

1465
01:25:50,508 --> 01:25:51,949
- Benjamin's staying here.

1466
01:25:51,949 --> 01:25:53,949
I'll not risk his going.

1467
01:25:55,145 --> 01:25:58,986
- Well, Mr. Gray, he said
all of us together, Dad.

1468
01:25:58,986 --> 01:25:59,819
I'm sorry.

1469
01:26:01,308 --> 01:26:03,166
- I fear for Benjamin
because he's my youngest,

1470
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:05,684
but I fear for all of you.

1471
01:26:05,684 --> 01:26:08,434
So I'll go and see this Mr. Gray.

1472
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:11,372
- I'm going with you.

1473
01:26:14,188 --> 01:26:17,313
Don't look at me like that, I'm going.

1474
01:26:17,313 --> 01:26:20,063
(dramatic music)

1475
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:25,672
- How long are we supposed to wait?

1476
01:26:25,672 --> 01:26:26,924
We've been here half an hour already.

1477
01:26:26,924 --> 01:26:28,757
- As long as it takes.

1478
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,220
Simon.

1479
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:32,829
Are you all right?

1480
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:34,755
- Yeah, I'm fine, really.

1481
01:26:34,755 --> 01:26:36,137
It's good to see all of you.

1482
01:26:36,137 --> 01:26:37,328
- Do you know what's going on here?

1483
01:26:37,328 --> 01:26:38,161
- Yeah.

1484
01:26:38,161 --> 01:26:39,186
- So where is this Mr. Gray.

1485
01:26:39,186 --> 01:26:40,446
- Well that's just it.

1486
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:41,435
I couldn't tell you right now.

1487
01:26:41,435 --> 01:26:43,584
I haven't seen that much of him.

1488
01:26:43,584 --> 01:26:45,699
His assistant, Mr. Parker,

1489
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:48,880
wanted me to give this to you, Dad.

1490
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,547
- Like the big city?

1491
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:55,740
- Diane, I don't have my glasses.

1492
01:26:57,263 --> 01:26:59,555
- Dear Mr. Keller,

1493
01:26:59,555 --> 01:27:03,079
I will meet you and your
sons in my home at seven p.m.

1494
01:27:03,079 --> 01:27:06,150
Transportation is awaiting.

1495
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:06,983
Mr. Gray.

1496
01:27:10,051 --> 01:27:12,134
- Can't we sit down?

1497
01:27:12,134 --> 01:27:15,215
- Father, I'm sure it would
be all right if you sat.

1498
01:27:15,215 --> 01:27:16,318
- [Jacob] It's all right, all right.

1499
01:27:16,318 --> 01:27:17,319
I'll only have to stand a while.

1500
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:20,088
- [Justin] Maybe we're
supposed to start without him.

1501
01:27:20,088 --> 01:27:21,088
- Gentlemen.

1502
01:27:24,494 --> 01:27:26,244
Thank you for coming.

1503
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,083
Welcome.

1504
01:27:43,264 --> 01:27:44,097
All of you.

1505
01:27:44,097 --> 01:27:46,506
- What's this all about?

1506
01:27:46,506 --> 01:27:47,710
Why are we here?

1507
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:51,793
- I would like to propose
a toast to your family.

1508
01:27:53,626 --> 01:27:56,293
To those who are no longer here.

1509
01:27:57,753 --> 01:28:00,920
To those who sit in health before you,

1510
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:05,307
and to those who are lost.

1511
01:28:08,194 --> 01:28:09,611
But now is found.

1512
01:28:10,725 --> 01:28:11,558
Salute.

1513
01:28:22,001 --> 01:28:22,834
Father.

1514
01:28:25,182 --> 01:28:26,182
I am Joseph.

1515
01:28:30,548 --> 01:28:31,381
Your son.

1516
01:28:39,009 --> 01:28:40,092
- That can't.

1517
01:28:42,394 --> 01:28:44,227
This is too cruel, no.

1518
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:47,740
No, no, no.

1519
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,323
- Yes, I am Joseph.

1520
01:28:50,608 --> 01:28:52,700
My mother is Rachel.

1521
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,861
We had a house next to an empty lot.

1522
01:28:55,861 --> 01:28:58,255
My room was down the hall from Ash.

1523
01:28:58,255 --> 01:29:01,244
I worked one summer at the factory.

1524
01:29:01,244 --> 01:29:03,596
You gave me a coat.

1525
01:29:03,596 --> 01:29:05,679
(crying)

1526
01:29:18,965 --> 01:29:20,298
- What happened?

1527
01:29:21,227 --> 01:29:23,635
What happened, what happened?

1528
01:29:23,635 --> 01:29:25,244
- To be honest, Father,
those are not memories

1529
01:29:25,244 --> 01:29:26,661
I wish to recall.

1530
01:29:27,626 --> 01:29:28,459
Ever.

1531
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:33,287
But I will say this.

1532
01:29:37,158 --> 01:29:39,491
What might have destroyed me

1533
01:29:40,565 --> 01:29:43,141
has instead shaped me.

1534
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:45,511
Shaped this moment.

1535
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:47,344
I am here to help you.

1536
01:29:49,475 --> 01:29:50,392
All of you.

1537
01:29:51,624 --> 01:29:54,124
And many other people besides.

1538
01:29:59,947 --> 01:30:03,408
(dramatic music)

1539
01:30:03,408 --> 01:30:05,158
- Joseph, forgive me.

1540
01:30:09,595 --> 01:30:12,116
- Forgiveness will always be in my heart.

1541
01:30:12,116 --> 01:30:14,116
I know what you planned.

1542
01:30:15,164 --> 01:30:17,914
But fate always takes its course.

1543
01:30:21,114 --> 01:30:22,864
We are all right now.

1544
01:30:25,096 --> 01:30:25,929
All of us.

1545
01:30:29,067 --> 01:30:32,484
In time, you will see what I say is true.

1546
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:34,719
A second chance.

1547
01:30:36,753 --> 01:30:40,305
(glasses clinking)

1548
01:30:40,305 --> 01:30:44,676
- To that grace which
has brought us together.

1549
01:30:44,676 --> 01:30:46,093
- To my children.

1550
01:30:49,255 --> 01:30:50,505
I love you all.

1551
01:30:56,512 --> 01:30:57,512
- Thank you.
