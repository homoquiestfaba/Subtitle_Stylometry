1
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:45,432
- Hey, you need help?
- No, I'm just looking.

2
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,735
Well, what exactly
is your range, price-wise?

3
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,712
Depends, what do they cost?

4
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:54,032
Well, we got little ones and big ones.

5
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:58,453
- Big ones start at about three thousand.
- No senior citizen discount?

6
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,207
I sell headstones at a senior
citizen discount, I won't last long.

7
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,984
What do you got on the small scale?

8
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:08,088
Well, the one you were looking at,
that starts at three hundred.

9
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,589
That's pretty good for a budget.

10
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,501
Yeah, but these are shit, people step
on 'em, they wear the words off.

11
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,637
Well, they ain't cheaper
'cause they're better.

12
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,681
Well, the VA's picking up the tab for the
funeral but I gotta pay for the headstone.

13
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,851
Oh, pay for the funeral, that's nice.

14
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:26,247
Listen, you're a vet,
I'll give you five percent,

15
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:28,316
plus we'll throw in some flowers.

16
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,237
I'm sure that's a comfort
to dying vets everywhere. Come.

17
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,156
Listen, you want me to
hold anything for you?

18
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,367
Let me think about it, I got time.

19
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,304
Here, pop. Right here. Come on.

20
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,305
Yeah, people always think they got time.

21
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,810
So...

22
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:59,297
- how'd it go?
- It was lovely. What do you think?

23
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,198
I think it was a bad idea to begin with.

24
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,397
- Did you pick something?
- Dying ain't cheap.

25
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,693
It costs less to pay you to stand in the
cemetery and point at my grave all day.

26
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,778
Will you get off the goddamn cellphone?
It's illegal.

27
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,405
Are you kidding?
How did you know that I was...

28
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,990
Can you hear me pushing
the buttons or something?

29
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,200
You're driving like an idiot,
you're all over the road.

30
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,660
Okay, I'm just... I'm trying to tell Ann

31
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,996
that this is taking a little bit
longer than I thought,

32
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,498
and that I'm going to be late
for dinner. That's all.

33
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,022
Hey.

34
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,865
Hey!

35
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,872
Easy, boy.

36
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,515
Speed limit's 25.

37
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,842
Thanks a lot fucking asshole.

38
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,928
I gotta live here, Will. Don't make them
hate me, I can do that on my own.

39
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,181
What's it look like?

40
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,877
It's nice.

41
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:15,838
It is... you know,
the houses are close together, but...

42
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,619
It reminds me of that place
we used to live in when I was a kid.

43
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,806
Any jerk-offs staring at us?

44
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,572
Yeah.

45
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,237
Yeah, they are. Yep.
But, I mean, who can blame them,

46
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:32,539
this is probably the most exciting thing
that's happened to them in a month.

47
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,238
Jesus, what's his problem?

48
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,132
It's you. You have your mother's scent.

49
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,972
That's the first time you've mentioned
her since her funeral, pops.

50
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,904
Come.

51
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,284
- Dad, wait for me, I'll be right there.
- I got it.

52
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,920
- Mailbox on your right.
- Thanks.

53
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,006
Hold on, pops, let me get your bags.

54
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,593
Looks like we beat the movers here.

55
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,834
Sounds empty.

56
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,252
Yeah.

57
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,045
I feel like I'm dropping
you off at prison.

58
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,871
You don't look like
a necklace kind of guy.

59
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:29,849
I can't see you,
but you smell beautiful.

60
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,776
Oh, thank you very much.

61
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,231
- Did you just move next door?
- Yes.

62
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,984
It's so nice to see
a new face around here.

63
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,738
It's nice to hear somebody referring
anything of me as "new."

64
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,573
- Delores.
- Ambrose.

65
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,866
Hello, Ambrose.

66
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,369
- Hello, Delores.
- Hello, hello.

67
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,562
Delores... Can you tell me what that is?

68
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:00,254
- Claw-something? Some kind of claw?
- Dad?

69
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:04,509
You know I really don't like it when you
go walking around without Shadow like that.

70
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,762
I'm sorry, excuse me, my name's Will.
I'm Ambrose's son.

71
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,232
- Oh, hello, Will. Delores.
- Nice to meet you, miss.

72
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:14,811
Can I get you back to the house?
The movers are going to be here any minute.

73
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,688
I hope to smell you again very soon.

74
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,748
I hope so, too.

75
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,009
Right this way, pops.

76
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:43,881
- Knock, knock!
- Hello!

77
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,091
Who's there?

78
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,428
We are Crescent Bay's Welcoming Party,

79
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,549
and, well, we just couldn't wait
to introduce ourselves to you!

80
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,352
- I'm Emma.
- And I'm Gloria!

81
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,339
- I'm Clarissa.
- Ambrose McKinley.

82
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:03,025
Mr. McKinley, is there anything
we can do to help?

83
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,751
No, thanks.

84
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,383
- Did you bring cake?
- Yes.

85
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:10,741
Yes we did!
And where would you like us to put it?

86
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,035
I can't eat sugar, but thanks anyway.

87
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,540
You were a veteran.

88
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,003
I am a veteran, twenty years
United States Army. Five years Vietnam.

89
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,506
Oh, my!
Oh, that's very impressive!

90
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,316
Yeah? You didn't hear? We lost that one.

91
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,267
Oh, there don't tend
to be firearms at Crescent Bay.

92
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,296
That's nice.

93
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,899
- I didn't think it was legal.
- What, for a blind person to own guns?

94
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,567
- It's legal.
- Oh.

95
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,487
Perhaps you were thinking of retards.

96
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,115
Now, you just hold on
one minute, Mr. McKinley...

97
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,409
You hold on one minute.
I'm a weapons expert.

98
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,786
I know more about guns
than you do Pop-Tarts.

99
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,330
So thank you for the sugar
and have a nice night.

100
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:03,252
Well...

101
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,846
Welcome to Crescent Bay, Mr. McKinley.

102
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,475
Any help at all, Mr. McKinley...

103
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:13,695
I'd see you ladies to the door,
but I'm blind.

104
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,943
There we go.

105
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,363
Are you a good doggie,
or are you a bad doggie?

106
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,265
You're a good doggie... yes.

107
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,412
That's my boy. Is that good?

108
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,748
Is that good? Yes.

109
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,412
Darn!

110
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:25,084
Hey, mom, it's me. I just wanted to say
I'm sorry we missed the yard sale...

111
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,235
Victoria! Are you there?

112
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:29,463
Hi, Mom!
Didn't think you'd still be awake.

113
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,842
I sure am!
Thank you for calling, sweetheart.

114
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,967
But you actually said
you'd come help tomorrow.

115
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:40,182
Are you sure?
I'm looking at my planner and...

116
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:45,271
Oh, Mom, I'm so sorry.
Oh, God. I hope I didn't confuse you.

117
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,940
I'm not the one who's confused,
Victoria.

118
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,093
If I didn't remember these things
nobody else would.

119
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:53,153
Mom, I'm sorry!
I've been all over the...

120
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,359
Even I can see this ain't
the goddamn bedroom.

121
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,890
What the hell is that?

122
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,590
Mom, remember when we talked about changing
your outgoing answering machine message?

123
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,968
It's just nice to hear
his voice, Victoria.

124
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:01,914
I'd feel so much better
if you let us get you another dog.

125
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,200
Just a little someone
to keep you company.

126
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,520
There is no point in getting
dog after dog, sweetheart,

127
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,397
if they're all going to run away.

128
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:14,918
If a third dog runs away I'm going
to have to start taking it personally.

129
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,435
Shadow! Where are you, boy?

130
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:33,295
Anyway, mom,

131
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:38,016
I'm going to have to go.
I have to put the little munchkins...

132
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:41,095
Julie! Put that... put that down!

133
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,097
Mom, I've got to put
the little ones to bed.

134
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,351
Victoria, can you just stay
with me for a second?

135
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,869
Can you stay on the line with me?

136
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,169
Shadow.

137
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,790
What is it, boy?

138
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,246
What? Mom?

139
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,332
Hello? Mom?

140
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,016
Is everything okay?

141
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,538
Delores! Delores!

142
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,606
Delores! Delores!

143
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,060
Delores!

144
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,436
Hello, you've reached
Delores and Jonathan.

145
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:17,107
Please leave us your name
and number and we'll...

146
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,501
Delores! Delores!

147
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,755
- Mom?
- Delores!

148
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,717
- Delores!
- Mom?!

149
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,129
Okay. Call me back.

150
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,582
Shadow?

151
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,762
What did I do with the guns?

152
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,392
Shadow?

153
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,777
Shadow?

154
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,587
Shadow?

155
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,944
It's me, boy. C'mon.

156
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,020
Shadow?

157
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,068
Shadow? Shadow?

158
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,562
It's okay.

159
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,102
Daddy's here.

160
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,699
It's okay.

161
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,622
Daddy's here, boy.

162
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,126
Shadow.

163
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,942
You know we wouldn't have to come back here
if you hadn't left early last night, right?

164
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,661
You smell that?

165
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,597
- No.
- Swear to God,

166
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,892
I can smell this old folk smell
from all the way up here.

167
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,728
- Really?
- It's following me.

168
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,521
Why is it that they
don't smell the same?

169
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,125
It's almost like, it's on their furniture,
it's on their clothes. I don't even know.

170
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,428
- Is it something medical, you think?
- Dude. Not all old people smell like that.

171
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,739
No, no, no! Old people do smell like that,
I'm telling you.

172
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,615
I smell my grandfather like, every day.
I sleep with him.

173
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,868
I've been sleeping with him
for ten years. In the same bed!

174
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,661
I'm not even lying to you, man!
I'm serious.

175
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,997
Yeah, just be glad
it's not patchouli, alright?

176
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,525
You're lucky you were on vacation when we
had to move this guy from the north end.

177
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,069
He had like twenty guitars that all...

178
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,058
- Oh, man.
- Jesus!

179
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,744
You alright, Mr. McKinley?

180
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,714
Oh, fuck!

181
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,922
Help me, please. My dog...

182
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:57,603
Don! Don! Come over here, Don!
Get over here now!

183
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:06,956
No. Yeah, I'm up here right now.
It happened some time last night.

184
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:11,568
Well, I'm at least an hour
out of the city so...

185
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,331
Look, I'll call you
as soon as I leave here, okay?

186
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,315
Alright. Thank you.

187
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,077
- Hey.
- Hi.

188
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,662
- Was that work?
- Yeah.

189
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,972
I'm catching hell
from missing this meeting.

190
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,993
Will, did you seriously leave
your father alone in the new house

191
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:33,298
without a working phone?
Honey, what were you thinking?

192
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,686
I wasn't, okay? I've been
a little scattered... recently,

193
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:41,056
and besides, I thought that the movers
took care of that sort of thing.

194
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,802
You know, he was sitting at home
by himself until someone found him.

195
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:47,813
How is he now?

196
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,482
- You know what? I don't know.
- What do you mean?

197
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:55,202
Well, his "okay" and his "not okay,"
they look exactly the same.

198
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,613
Mr. McKinley.

199
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:03,829
Do you have any idea
what attacked you and Shadow?

200
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,040
No. Whatever it was, it was big.

201
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,877
- Like a mountain lion? Or a bear?
- More like a dog.

202
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,713
- You're sure?
- Yeah. I could smell it.

203
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:16,758
- You've been in Crescent Bay a while?
- No. It's our first night.

204
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:21,555
Mr. McKinley, we get phone calls
once a month about Crescent Bay.

205
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,657
The police ask us what could do
something like this.

206
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:25,309
It's actually a very common thing.

207
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,187
Once a month?
This has happened before?

208
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,024
It's a secluded community.
Town basically ends there.

209
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,984
And the woods begin.

210
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,320
Sometimes I'm surprised
it doesn't happen more often.

211
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,323
It's a terrible location.
Even with the gates.

212
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,034
What do you think, Doc?

213
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,221
Does it look like a dog
did this to Shadow?

214
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,763
In passing.

215
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,298
Are you kidding me?

216
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:54,004
The whole point that we came out here was
so that they were going to take the dog.

217
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,692
We can't take that in my car.
It's a company car.

218
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:59,468
- He was supposed to leave the dog here.
- Okay. Stop that, Will.

219
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,347
Hi, Ambrose, I came straight from work.
I'm so glad you're okay.

220
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,906
Anne, which car are we taking?

221
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,896
Are we taking you
to take a new guide dog?

222
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,565
No. I'm taking Shadow home.

223
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,709
Dad... seriously?

224
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,811
Yeah. I can take care of myself.
Now, which car are we taking?

225
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,664
- Speed limit's twenty...
- I know it's twenty-five. I got it.

226
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,222
Fine.

227
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,458
There's a lot of cops here.

228
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,808
Let me get you inside. I'll come back
and figure out what's going on.

229
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,726
I want to see the cops.

230
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,937
No. Let me get you
in the house first. Please, Dad.

231
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,231
Just take care of the dog.
I'll see you in a minute.

232
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,774
Please, Mrs. Kaye.

233
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,151
You really don't
want to go in there, Mrs. Kaye.

234
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,321
Let us take you down to the station
and finish your report there.

235
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,449
Oh, for God's sake! How long
does it take you people to do your job?

236
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,202
I just want to get this over with
and move on with my life, okay?

237
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,327
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Are you alright, sir?

238
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:11,540
Yeah. I was attacked last night.

239
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,084
- Are you Mr. McKinley?
- Yeah.

240
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,044
Excuse me for one second. Excuse me.

241
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,688
Miss?

242
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:20,189
- Yeah?
- Is Delores your mother?

243
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,343
She was. Yes.

244
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,454
Well, I'm sorry.
She seemed like a nice lady.

245
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,724
Thank you.

246
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,403
God, this place.

247
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,336
I should have taken her out of here
the moment I heard the stories, but...

248
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:44,407
there were so few options and I swear

249
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:48,876
I never thought she'd... I'm sorry.

250
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,207
You know the woman
who used to live here?

251
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,544
I only met her once.
You guys need a statement from me?

252
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,088
No, there's no need.
It's just an animal attack.

253
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,008
You got any leads?
Suspect may have sharp teeth.

254
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,135
Hey. Hey.

255
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:10,182
Sir, attacks like these happen all the time
around wooded areas like this.

256
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,393
The problem is the elderly
can't defend themselves.

257
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,853
So we suggest during the day

258
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,231
you don't walk by the perimeter
of the woods if you're alone.

259
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:22,123
And at night, please, stay in your house,
keep the doors closed

260
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:24,446
and the windows closed
until we sort this out. Okay?

261
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,991
- Starting now.
- Gotcha.

262
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,851
- Thanks for the piece of mind, boys!
- You're welcome.

263
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,613
We need another hour at least
to clean up the rest of it.

264
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,441
- Ambrose, I'm so sorry about Shadow.
- Yeah. It is a shame.

265
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,640
It is a shame.
It seems like such a nice place to live.

266
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,018
People don't come
to places like this to live.

267
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,479
They come here to die.

268
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,773
Yeah, well...

269
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,151
Seems like everybody's been
having a crazy couple of days.

270
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,278
Must be the full moon.

271
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,881
Office is filled with a bunch
of nut jobs every time like clockwork.

272
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,349
Hey, pops, have you eaten today?

273
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,187
No.

274
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,340
You've got to eat something.

275
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,611
What is he doing?

276
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,899
Pops, I...

277
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:47,195
I checked the phone line about
a dozen times. It's working fine now.

278
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,905
We can stay longer if you like.

279
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,659
No, I'm fine.
Nothing's going to happen tonight.

280
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,635
Is it a full moon?

281
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,789
What?

282
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,500
No, the full moon
was last night, Ambrose.

283
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,820
So the next one's in a month.

284
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,601
Yeah, that's pretty much
the way it works, Dad.

285
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,489
One month.

286
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,989
I'll call you tomorrow. Okay, Dad?

287
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,215
Drive safe.

288
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,194
One month.

289
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:05,697
One month.

290
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,616
I'm only here a week, I got mail?

291
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,744
- Are you Kimberly Carty?
- Do I look like Kimberly Carty?

292
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,442
Not particularly.

293
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,667
- How'd you know I was the mailman?
- I'm not deaf.

294
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,669
You want some chicken?

295
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:31,800
No, thank you, sir.
Say, what happened here?

296
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,470
- My dog got killed.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

297
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,140
The blood. Where does it lead?

298
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,660
- It goes out to the street.
- Show me.

299
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,705
- Is this it?
- Yeah. 1202 Huntington.

300
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,165
- Gloria and John Baker.
- Good.

301
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:08,677
I got it from here, thanks. Just point me
in the right direction. Will ya?

302
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,565
- Hey, are you going to be alright?
- Yeah, I'm going to be fine.

303
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:50,103
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness.
Oh, Ambrose!

304
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:53,489
What a pleasant surprise! Come in.

305
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:56,509
Watch your step. Here. Good.

306
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,054
- You're growing vegetables?
- Oh, yes!

307
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:03,475
I want to apologize for my behavior.
I'm a little stressed with the move.

308
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,270
Oh, yes. Well, sure. Just welcome!

309
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,491
Welcome to our little part
of the world! John and I.

310
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,978
I just gave him a haircut.

311
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:19,949
My goodness. Why are you carrying
that shovel around?

312
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,609
I've been digging.

313
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:26,331
You walked all this way.
You must be thirsty.

314
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,377
You know, I just made some sun tea.
I'll go get you a glass.

315
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,269
Thank you.

316
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:28,268
Stop! Ambrose! Oh! Oh, my god!

317
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,812
You just about turned off
John's machine!

318
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,897
I'm sorry.

319
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,065
I didn't know what it was.

320
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:38,027
It's alright. I know you
didn't mean it. Let's just go.

321
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,748
- What's wrong with him?
- He's in an iron lung.

322
00:30:41,948 --> 00:30:44,082
Poor fucking bastard.

323
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,831
I've actually got a lot of things
to do with John today, Ambrose.

324
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,751
Any other day
you would be more than welcome.

325
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,795
- I'm sorry about your husband.
- Oh, well.

326
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,296
Does he ever get out of that thing?

327
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,384
About as often as you blink,
Mr. McKinley.

328
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,320
Yeah. Good luck with your vegetable.

329
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,079
You won't believe what just happened.

330
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,703
Hey! This is private property.

331
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:32,123
Private property is the reason
we were called out here, Mr. McKinley.

332
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,251
A couple people have called in complaints.
Feeling threatened.

333
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,045
- We're the police, sir.
- Yeah.

334
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,839
- I can smell the donuts.
- This is serious business.

335
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:43,009
We've had two fatal attacks occur
within five blocks of each other.

336
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,679
- Two?
- Yeah, we discovered another victim.

337
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,642
Cole Evanston.
Lives about three blocks...

338
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,810
North of here.

339
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,629
Listen, sir. We get assigned
to patrol Crescent Bay daily.

340
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,009
And a lot of the cranks that live here,
they throw fits, lose their minds

341
00:31:57,109 --> 00:31:59,484
and call in every little problem,
making them into our little problems.

342
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,236
Since when is murder a little problem?

343
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,280
They're animal attacks, sir.
Considered acts of God.

344
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,203
And forgive me, but death at old age is not
on our list of this town's biggest problems.

345
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,620
The only big problem
I'm sensing around here is you.

346
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,665
So don't be a pain in the ass.
You wouldn't like me if I hated my job.

347
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,918
You can always retire. This place is great!
Units opening up all the time!

348
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:21,214
Sir, please. Please, just stick
to your own property, okay? Thank you.

349
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:25,110
Hey! I found this in my mailbox.

350
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,886
Can you tell me what it is?

351
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,450
Oh! It's just a flyer
from the St. Anthony's church.

352
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,929
They send a shuttle up here
every Sunday to get people down there.

353
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,774
- You should consider going this Sunday.
- I'm not religious.

354
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:43,278
Well, even so. You get out of the house,
you get to meet your neighbors.

355
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,095
You might have a good time.

356
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,210
- Morning, sir. You ready to go?
- I was born ready.

357
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,394
I gotcha. Here you go.

358
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,975
Thanks, James.

359
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,965
I'm Father Roger Schmidt
from St. Anthony's.

360
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,467
Who might you be?

361
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:51,513
Ambrose McKinley.
United States Army. Retired.

362
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:56,267
Glad to have you. Welcome.
To your left that's James Griffin.

363
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,937
He's the one who organizes
the shuttle services.

364
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,437
Welcome.

365
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,901
You smoke?

366
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,819
Yeah. Guilty.

367
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,839
It's really hard to get the smell
out of your beard...

368
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:14,551
- What about you?
- Used to. Had to quit. Doctor's orders.

369
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,582
So I've never seen you
at Saint Anthony's before.

370
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,384
- You just moved in, right?
- That's right.

371
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:31,027
I live on Duke Street, myself.
Right over near the woods there.

372
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,353
It's good to know you, neighbor.

373
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,643
What gives with the shovel?

374
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,920
I lost my cane.

375
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,690
Well, maybe we can get one
donated to you?

376
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,485
It's hardly worth it. Besides,

377
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,416
I like the feel of this one.

378
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,774
A lot of people.

379
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,782
A lot of people

380
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:38,912
when they hear the word
"sacrifice" think

381
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,230
"I don't think that's so bad.

382
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,292
I make sacrifices all the time."

383
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,670
And they sacrifice their time
and they sacrifice their schedule.

384
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,373
And their plans.

385
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,219
And parents, in particular,

386
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,806
make a life-long
occupation of sacrifice.

387
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:04,003
And if they... And if they do it right,

388
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,399
their children have no awareness

389
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:12,028
of sacrifices that have
been made on their behalf.

390
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,926
But it dawned on me

391
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:20,288
that if sacrifice comes easily,

392
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:24,040
if sacrifice comes naturally to you,

393
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,676
you don't know the half of it.

394
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,276
Richard.

395
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,194
Why does he have to bring a shovel?

396
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:57,422
Why is he bringing the shovel
into our church?

397
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,491
Hey, Ambrose.

398
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,187
- Follow my smoke trail?
- Yeah.

399
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,693
Hey, I hope you don't...

400
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:13,444
mind me gearing my sermon towards you.

401
00:37:13,544 --> 00:37:18,184
You said you were a vet
and it got me thinking about sacrifice.

402
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,265
You were in 'Nam?

403
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,923
Yeah.

404
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,395
Hey, you got an extra fag?

405
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,074
Oh, sure. Take mine.

406
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:35,295
Because, my brother...
older brother... went over there.

407
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:39,265
I was in the seminary
when he shipped out.

408
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:41,357
When he came back...

409
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:44,474
he came back... he came back screaming.

410
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,716
And he still does it at night sometimes.

411
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,668
I guess it's fear...

412
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,440
No. He's angry.

413
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,373
Yeah.

414
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,843
Me?

415
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,845
I come back with eye trauma.

416
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:05,600
Kept getting worse, but...
I was too stubborn to ask for help.

417
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,476
By the time I went blind I couldn't stand
to look at the world anyway.

418
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,619
You mean, you think you deserved it
because you didn't ask for more help?

419
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,678
Maybe.

420
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:24,160
Well, because you said that you didn't think
it was worth you getting a cane.

421
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,828
Canes are for cripples.

422
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:29,765
Besides, I don't plan on
being around much longer anyway.

423
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,930
I hope you're not talking about
what I think you're talking about.

424
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,158
Because that's not an option.

425
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:43,040
I will not participate
in that sort of giving in.

426
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,106
Everybody dies, Father. Besides,

427
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,985
some things are okay to quit.

428
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,966
Mr. McKinley, Father.
The shuttle's getting ready to go.

429
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,318
One, two,

430
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:10,171
three,

431
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:12,940
four, five.

432
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,603
It's two weeks
and he's still doing this.

433
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,355
Oh, god, that smell.

434
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,165
I can't believe the neighbors
haven't complained about it.

435
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,326
Six,

436
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:45,056
seven.

437
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:54,549
One, two, three, four, five,

438
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,190
six...

439
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,688
One, two, three.

440
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,733
One, four, two, five, three, six.

441
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,126
One, four, two...

442
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,886
Mr. Griffin?

443
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:35,191
I just want to say that we all really
appreciate what you're doing for us.

444
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,792
Keeping the shuttle bus going.

445
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:40,796
And we do believe that everyone

446
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,966
should have a chance to hear God's word.

447
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:48,387
But, I don't feel comfortable
having him on this bus.

448
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:53,267
He tried to kill my husband and he
scratched up my floors with his shovel.

449
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,788
I mean, I think he has a capacity for...

450
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,357
- Violence.
- Yes!

451
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:04,152
I'll talk to Father about it and see if I can
get an alternate vehicle or something.

452
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:07,239
- Oh, thank you.
- Means a lot to us.

453
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,572
- Thank you, Mr. Griffin.
- Please, just James.

454
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,010
Four, five, five, seven,

455
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,318
eight, nine.

456
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,753
Seems to be a lot of new dogs
popping up in the area.

457
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,730
Maybe we should start talking about
getting you a little Shadow Jr.

458
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,673
No, thank you.

459
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,653
How are you doing
on your blood pressure medicine?

460
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:31,548
I've got a couple bottles left.
Fucking things make me constipated.

461
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,162
You know, Ambrose, I was reading
about this thing online,

462
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,597
this great new microwave
for the visually impaired.

463
00:42:38,697 --> 00:42:42,501
It actually reads the numbers out loud
as you're entering them.

464
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,853
Jesus Christ,
I'm not that goddam lonely.

465
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,623
I want this one.

466
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,161
- Dad...
- Are you sure?

467
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,122
That's a little pricier than some of
the ones we were looking at before.

468
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,541
You don't have that much
money left. Okay?

469
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,920
I mean, how can you justify
spending it all on a headstone?

470
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,438
Because it's not for me.

471
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,849
Okay!

472
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,270
This should cover it.

473
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,223
- Okay. Hey.
- What?

474
00:43:40,323 --> 00:43:43,612
- These are tens not hundreds!
- You're kidding.

475
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,857
- Okay. It's just a joke.
- Real funny.

476
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,734
Can I have this delivered to my house?

477
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:52,905
Yep! I've got a guy. Take two days.

478
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,699
As long as I have it in two weeks.

479
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,268
- You got it.
- Is there a gun store around here?

480
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,123
What you want a gun for, old man?

481
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:06,267
Guns I got. I need ammo.

482
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,132
I know a guy. Uptown.

483
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,385
Westmark. That's the name of the shop.

484
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,444
Can you write it down for me?

485
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,683
Will,

486
00:44:23,388 --> 00:44:26,105
he still has all that cash with him.

487
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,289
What if he loses it?

488
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,486
Oh, shit. Pops! Hold on!

489
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,045
What?

490
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,742
- Pops.
- What?

491
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:39,868
Hey.

492
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,122
- What do you want?
- I need to get that cash from you.

493
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,124
What for?

494
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,127
I want to deposit it in a bank, okay?

495
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,503
Why?

496
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,463
Because it's not safe walking around
with your entire savings

497
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:54,216
in your pocket like that.

498
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,318
I can take care of myself.
What do I look like, an idiot?

499
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,806
Would you please stop acting like this?

500
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:04,143
Okay? I'm trying to help you. Alright?

501
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,079
You're making it harder
and harder for me to do that.

502
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:11,416
It's my money. I'm keeping it.
Stop acting like your mother.

503
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,377
I don't want to argue
about it anymore, Will.

504
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,318
I said, I didn't want to talk about it.

505
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,675
I smell you, you son of a bitch.

506
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,983
When are you going to bury
your dog, Mr. McKinley?

507
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,636
Thinking about having him stuffed.

508
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,155
Look, we can't get prints off a scarf.

509
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:23,841
None of the neighbors
saw any sign of this assailant

510
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,285
but he did kill a couple of dogs.

511
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,620
But there's not witnesses.
Well, there was one.

512
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,082
- But it was an Alzheimer's patient.
- You can smell the scarf though, right?

513
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:36,319
- No, sir. Not over the smell of your dog.
- Smelled like smoke.

514
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,474
What the fuck?

515
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,916
Mr. McKinley! It's James Griffin.
I'll be your ride today.

516
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,268
- Here, let me help you.
- I got it.

517
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,296
I'm blind. I'm not crippled.

518
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,059
So some of the neighbors thought the shuttle
might be a little cumbersome for you.

519
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,019
So I was happy to volunteer.

520
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,232
Lucky me. How long have you been
at Saint Anthony's?

521
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,818
About twenty-five years now.

522
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,362
You must know the priest pretty well?

523
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,889
I suppose you could say that.

524
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:48,826
- Not as well as he knows me though.
- Oh, yeah?

525
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,579
Yeah, I owe my undying soul to that man.

526
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,372
Seems a little strange to me.

527
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:01,338
Father Roger is the least strange
person I know. Myself included.

528
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,925
I can tell you he's been quite concerned
with you this past week.

529
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,936
Oh, yeah? That's reassuring.

530
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,184
You don't seem like a very
religious man, Mr. McKinley.

531
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,520
I'm not. Just because you wear
a collar don't mean much.

532
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,214
A man can get away with a lot
in uniform. Believe me.

533
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,779
It's just... I don't know.

534
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:29,116
I was just... it was funny
when you called, because it...

535
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,010
You know, I went to high school with
your mother and you look just like her.

536
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,787
- Isn't that amazing.
- It's really incredible.

537
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,689
Hey, Father!

538
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:38,045
Well, I've got to talk to this guy.
I'll talk to you again.

539
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:41,251
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah. Stay in touch.

540
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,742
I owed you one.

541
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:51,877
That's kind of you.

542
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,652
I was very glad to see you
came back in this week.

543
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:04,291
And, you know, it looked to me
like you were paying attention.

544
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,672
When you're blind, it always
looks like you're paying attention.

545
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:14,843
Yeah, well, what the hell were you
thinking about so intently for an hour?

546
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,897
How you became a priest.

547
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,835
It's funny how people don't ask that...

548
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,891
question much anymore.

549
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,697
I don't know, I was a bad kid and I...

550
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:32,612
was mean and greedy
and stole and hurt a lot people.

551
00:50:32,712 --> 00:50:35,912
Then... I don't know, one day, you...

552
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:41,612
you have to pick college or trade or...

553
00:50:41,712 --> 00:50:44,642
- The Army.
- Yeah.

554
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,954
And I decided to go into the seminary.

555
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:52,240
Go for the full transformation.

556
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,369
It's sort of life and death, really.

557
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,121
So you killed that bad part of yourself.

558
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:02,843
Killed it? No.
You can't kill that thing.

559
00:51:03,043 --> 00:51:08,222
I guess I caged it and starved it and...

560
00:51:08,322 --> 00:51:10,895
and whittled it down to...

561
00:51:10,995 --> 00:51:12,818
a half pack a day.

562
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,015
When I went to 'Nam,

563
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:20,117
I honestly thought
I was going to save lives.

564
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,205
Yeah, but you ended up taking them.

565
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:30,903
My last tour, '68, Dien Phu Valley...

566
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,283
The gooks,

567
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:39,555
they strapped a grenade to a kid,
maybe six years old.

568
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,431
And they sent him at us.

569
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,676
Nobody would take the shot.

570
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:48,387
I did.

571
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,763
Is that what happened
to the "good side" of you?

572
00:51:56,363 --> 00:52:00,336
I might be blind, but when I close
my eyes I still see that kid's face.

573
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,964
That moment was like a transformation.

574
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,150
God don't want nothing
to do with me, Father.

575
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,909
And I don't want nothing to do with him.

576
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,102
Excuse me, Mr. McKinley,
we better get going.

577
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,091
Talking about this felt good, didn't it?

578
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:31,230
If you want to talk to me, Father,
you know where I live.

579
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,202
So what did you and Father talk about?

580
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,733
Not much. I don't think he is
who I thought he was.

581
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,986
You ever see him act violent?

582
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,030
What are you saying?

583
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,133
I mean, he's a human being. He's just
another monkey like right of us. Come on.

584
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:00,660
Look, you can disrespect the community,

585
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,080
you can disrespect our neighbors,
you can disrespect me. I don't care.

586
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,390
Do not disrespect that man. Do not...

587
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,024
We're here.

588
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:34,343
Yeah. Here we are.

589
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:53,086
I wish I had that goddamn ammo.

590
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,151
- Yeah?
- Hey.

591
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,702
Is this the right address for the cross?

592
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,116
You're late. Is it heavy?

593
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,995
Yeah, it's fucking heavy. You want it inside
or you want it somewhere else?

594
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,345
Bring it around back.

595
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,709
Jesus.

596
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,510
What's the rest of your day
look like, Chief?

597
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,553
I dunno.

598
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,529
You mind giving a old man
a ride into town?

599
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,575
Afternoon.

600
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,737
O'Brien sent me. You Westmark?

601
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:12,261
If I'm not then he should be grateful
that I'm paying all his bills.

602
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,426
Come on in.

603
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:19,341
Watch your step here,
it's a little uneven.

604
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,384
What can I do for ya?

605
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:25,639
Do me a favor. I don't need no wisecracks,
no questions. You good with that?

606
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,267
Hell, yeah, I'm good with that.
What do you need?

607
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:32,562
Berreta's? M16's?

608
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:36,775
Uzi. You're an Uzi guy.
Come in here. Come in my office.

609
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,993
Watch your step right here. There it is.

610
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,838
What can I do for ya?

611
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,050
Can you make silver bullets?

612
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:51,890
Yeah. I can make silver bullets.

613
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,375
What guns?

614
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,892
Smith and Wesson 64 revolver,
Remington 700 BDL rifle.

615
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:02,001
- Yeah, I can make those.
- Can you do silver shotgun shells?

616
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,636
Shotgun shells? Well...

617
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,681
Shotgun shells
are a little more complicated.

618
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:12,601
- They take like an hour to make.
- I only need one. I'll take it.

619
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,516
Hey.

620
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,250
What do silver bullets
make you think of?

621
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,787
Me? The Lone Ranger.

622
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,072
You ever see that?

623
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:27,859
Vigilante, fighting for
justice and all that.

624
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:32,539
He used silver bullets,
something about how the precious metal

625
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,666
stood for the preciousness of life.

626
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,043
The only thing precious
about life is that it ends.

627
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,386
I heard that, brother!

628
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:44,366
Anybody else ever come in here?
Asking for these?

629
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,806
Only guy I can remember,
come in about a year ago.

630
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,641
Do you mind if I ask who?

631
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,601
Nah.

632
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,596
I got to look.

633
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:59,531
My memory is not what it used to be.

634
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,870
Let me see here...

635
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,630
Oh, yeah! Here it is. His name was...

636
00:59:29,382 --> 00:59:30,991
Thanks.

637
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,901
Take care.

638
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:22,374
I'm sorry.

639
01:00:22,844 --> 01:00:25,037
I'm sorry for everything.

640
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,085
Dad! Dad! Dad! Jesus Christ!

641
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,712
It's Will! Put the fucking gun down!

642
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,965
What the fuck are you doing here?

643
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:56,309
I came here to check up on you, man.
You almost shot me, Dad!

644
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:02,482
What has gotten into you?
What have you done to this place?

645
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:08,413
What are you doing with this house?
Why are you sitting in the closet with a gun?

646
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,001
It's a system.

647
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:22,210
It's your system?

648
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,933
This house, I mean,
it's a complete mess.

649
01:01:27,033 --> 01:01:30,387
You've only been living here
for a month, Dad.

650
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,302
Tomorrow will be a month.

651
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,573
What do you want, Will?

652
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,131
Anne's pregnant, Dad.

653
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,275
Good.

654
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,469
Look, I came here to tell you that...

655
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,558
She wants to have the baby
closer to her family.

656
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,105
So we're moving, pops.

657
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,445
I'm happy for you, Will.

658
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,407
Are you?

659
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,645
What do you want from me?

660
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:32,231
Hugs and kisses? Go live your life.

661
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,217
You know what...

662
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:42,301
You know what I want from you?
How about the truth?

663
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:44,528
You know what that is?

664
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:49,799
I think you know exactly what that is.

665
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,779
I found that when I was
cleaning up your house.

666
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:59,050
Now you told me you threw that
in my mother's casket when she died.

667
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,015
Why?

668
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:07,115
Why'd you tell me that?
Why did you lie to your son?

669
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:10,895
It's got nothing to do with you, Will.

670
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:15,867
No. No, that's a lie too.
It's got everything to do with me.

671
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:25,413
You know what, Dad.
If you ever need anything from me,

672
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:30,547
don't come calling 'cause
I'm going to go live my own life.

673
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,065
Will...

674
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,908
Richard? Richard? Wake up!

675
01:03:58,008 --> 01:04:01,027
- What?
- I think there's someone inside.

676
01:04:10,997 --> 01:04:13,390
Oh! Richard...

677
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,803
Mr. Griffin?

678
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,242
Mr. Griffin...

679
01:04:25,442 --> 01:04:28,556
- Should I call the police?
- No! No, no.

680
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:32,102
- Are you alright?
- Clarissa, Richard...

681
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:36,314
What are you doing here?
James? Do you know where you are?

682
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,776
Will you kneel with me? Will you
pray with me? Just for a moment.

683
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:43,154
Hey, look. What is this?
It's the middle of night!

684
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,822
Richard...

685
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:49,118
Yes. Yes, James, we will pray.
We will pray.

686
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,982
Lord,

687
01:04:52,393 --> 01:04:55,411
make me an instrument of Your peace.

688
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:59,169
Where there is hatred,

689
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:02,059
let me sow love.

690
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,477
Where there is injury,

691
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,279
pardon.

692
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,139
Where there is doubt, faith,

693
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,109
and where there is despair, hope.

694
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,895
Where there is darkness, light.

695
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:20,037
And where there is sadness, joy.

696
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,945
Lord...

697
01:05:23,876 --> 01:05:26,843
Lord let me seek not to be consoled

698
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,575
but to console.

699
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:32,790
Let me seek not to be understood

700
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,906
but to understand.

701
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:38,084
Let me seek not be loved

702
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,438
but to love.

703
01:05:40,738 --> 01:05:44,048
For it is in giving that we receive.

704
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:47,467
And it is in dying
that we are born to eternal life.

705
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:14,287
Mr. Griffin! Hello?

706
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,936
- It's meals on wheels!
- Knock it off, Lang.

707
01:06:18,449 --> 01:06:21,685
- You think he's gone?
- I don't know.

708
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:35,933
What a pleasant surprise, Mr. Griffin!
What brings you to my door?

709
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:38,361
Please, Emma, call me James.

710
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,519
I...

711
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,921
I need your help.

712
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,988
May I have your hand, please?

713
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,109
Alright.

714
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,663
Emma, you know I've always been
quite fond of you.

715
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,930
And,

716
01:06:59,188 --> 01:07:04,003
please understand, I would never
do this if I didn't need the help.

717
01:07:05,702 --> 01:07:06,813
What are you...

718
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:29,353
- I thought I smelled smoke.
- Yeah, I'm still working on that.

719
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,243
- Is this a good time, Ambrose?
- Yeah.

720
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,378
You got an extra cigarette?

721
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,765
What's with the hole in the lawn?

722
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,897
My dog.

723
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,928
That's a big cross for a dog.

724
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,062
It was a big dog.

725
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,560
I came out here today
to visit one of your neighbors

726
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:06,148
but I wanted to stop by because
I didn't like the way our last talk ended.

727
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,817
Well...

728
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,468
Wasn't exactly a happy topic.

729
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:18,160
Yeah, well. I got to thinking you don't
have a lot of happy topics in your life.

730
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,895
Yeah, at this point what can I expect?

731
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:26,210
You've got stories.
You have wisdom. You...

732
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:31,339
You're a deep guy, Ambrose. I mean, you still
see a bigger picture than most people.

733
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:38,085
All I got left, Father,
are consequences.

734
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:41,434
Okay, you're a loner,
either by choice or by nature.

735
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:45,655
But no one can be truly alone.
So stop trying.

736
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:49,707
It's a little late in my game
for advice, but thanks.

737
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,406
You wanted to save lives
a long time ago, right?

738
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,008
Yeah.

739
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,667
A long time ago.

740
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,747
Yeah, well,

741
01:09:02,947 --> 01:09:06,133
it's never too late to save your own.

742
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:07,711
You hear me?

743
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,581
I'm pointing at you.

744
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,752
I hear ya.

745
01:09:35,154 --> 01:09:37,422
"Visiting a neighbor..." Shit!

746
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,374
Oh, James. No!

747
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,334
You made it!

748
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:34,046
We talked about this and you promised.

749
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:37,967
Whatever you think this medieval business
accomplishes, it simply doesn't.

750
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,512
It's corporal mortification, Father.
Acts of contrition.

751
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,881
I chastise my body
and bring it into subjection.

752
01:10:43,981 --> 01:10:47,143
Did you... I gave you prayers.
Did you use them? And the rosaries?

753
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,402
I tried those. Didn't work.

754
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:54,917
What do you mean
that you cannot find him?

755
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,904
You are the police!
I mean, he's an old man!

756
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:01,991
Let me tell you something, he attacked
both me and my neighbors in our own home.

757
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,735
I am lucky to be alive!

758
01:11:05,598 --> 01:11:08,971
God, this neighborhood has gone to pot.

759
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:18,114
It's tonight already, Father.

760
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,887
Will you sit down here?
I'll take care of your cuts.

761
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,281
I've done everything.
Everything this week.

762
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:26,599
Everything you said.
I turned to you and you gave me shit!

763
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:30,261
I took your confession and I gave you
what you need to come back to light.

764
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:34,740
This necklace? Prayers?
It's Sunday school garbage.

765
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,276
You gave me nothing
because you never believed me!

766
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:41,488
I believe that you think
that you are possessed by an evil.

767
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:43,574
But have you killed any more dogs?

768
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:46,711
They wouldn't stop barking at me!
I swear to God they're barking in my head!

769
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:50,630
Father, I need absolution.
I need it before it's too late.

770
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:57,746
James...

771
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,460
When I moved here, no one believed me.

772
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,637
I hunted the beast.
I went in the woods and I killed it.

773
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:08,933
But it got to me first. I have tried
everything and nothing works.

774
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:14,142
All I want to do is live and worship
and kill in solitude and die in peace!

775
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:16,857
- No more killing, James. No more killing.
- You have to!

776
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:19,151
You have to kill what you attack.

777
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:23,155
If you draw blood and you
leave it alive it carries over,

778
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:26,075
- it transforms with you.
- You're making all this up.

779
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,893
No, I'm telling you this
because I want you to know

780
01:12:27,993 --> 01:12:31,185
that when I kill you it's out of love.

781
01:12:31,285 --> 01:12:33,723
It's an act of mercy.

782
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:26,934
Son of a bitch.

783
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,618
Mrs. Baker?

784
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,254
It's Ambrose McKinley.

785
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,552
Is everything alright?

786
01:16:38,668 --> 01:16:40,586
I know that perfume, you bitch.

787
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:22,494
Will, pick up the fucking phone.

788
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,893
Will,

789
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,263
it's your old man.

790
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,159
I don't want to leave it
like this between us.

791
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:43,524
I got something I need to tell you.

792
01:18:58,316 --> 01:18:59,799
Oh, shit.

793
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:04,889
Shit!

794
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:27,204
Here comes the welcoming party.

795
01:21:20,717 --> 01:21:22,543
Oh, fuck.

796
01:21:56,394 --> 01:21:58,037
Fuck!

797
01:22:10,617 --> 01:22:12,187
Oh, fuck.

798
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:14,238
Griffin...

799
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:27,819
Oh, come on.

800
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:30,180
Are you fucking kidding me?

801
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,072
Oh, shit.

802
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,674
Come on.

803
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,369
Come on, Dad! Pick up your phone!

804
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,796
Come on, Dad, pick up your phone!

805
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:15,632
Fuck.

806
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:27,235
One, two, three, four.

807
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,300
I'm done.

808
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:42,687
Oh, my God. Hey.

809
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:58,997
Dad.

810
01:26:59,397 --> 01:27:01,156
Dad!

811
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:27,190
Will.

812
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,746
It's your old man.

813
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:32,373
I don't want to leave
it like this between us.

814
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:35,087
I got something I need to tell you.

815
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,880
I know I wasn't the father
you needed me to be.

816
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,674
I wasn't a good husband to your mother.

817
01:28:41,774 --> 01:28:43,927
You both deserve better.

818
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:47,513
When you were born it was
the happiest day of my life.

819
01:28:47,613 --> 01:28:51,927
You don't remember but those
were good years for all of us.

820
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,979
When they told me I was going blind,

821
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:58,424
there was a black thing inside me
that shut out the light.

822
01:28:58,524 --> 01:29:00,883
Including you and your mother.

823
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:06,699
I left because I didn't want it
touching you or her, but I was wrong.

824
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:08,326
I know that now.

825
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:12,413
I wasn't just blind in my eyes,
I was blind in my heart.

826
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:16,042
The only thing I was good at
was being a soldier.

827
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:19,295
That's what I am
and that's how I'm going out.

828
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:22,474
Remember me, son,
for that and nothing else.

829
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:27,220
I'm proud to be your father and I'm sorry
I won't get to see my grandkids.

830
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,056
You have a good woman
and a future in front of you.

831
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:33,017
Don't look back. That was my mistake.

832
01:29:33,117 --> 01:29:35,478
You can't live in the past.

833
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:37,647
You've got to put it away
and move forward.

834
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:40,692
Life's a gift.
Don't waste it like I did.

835
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:44,654
Give my love to Anne
and be the man I couldn't be.

836
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:47,922
I love you, boy. I always have.

837
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:51,383
Okay. Goodbye, son.
