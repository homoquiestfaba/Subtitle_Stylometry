1
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:28,233
(ominous music)

2
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:54,225
(thundering)

3
00:00:56,487 --> 00:00:58,654
(gunfire)

4
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:07,405
- [Soldier] Medic!

5
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:11,483
(barking)

6
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:17,185
(shouting in a foreign language)

7
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:42,017
- [Soldier] I surrender, I surrender!

8
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:43,214
Please!
(gunshot)

9
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:46,131
(foreign language)

10
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,593
- Please! (groaning)

11
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:58,510
(foreign language)

12
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:10,516
("Ave Maria")

13
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,743
(wailing)

14
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:22,985
- Padre.

15
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:23,818
Is that you?

16
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:24,651
- Yes.

17
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:25,484
Shh.

18
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:27,122
We got Krauts about us.

19
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:27,955
- [G.I.] Padre.

20
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:28,788
- [Soldier] No, please!

21
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:29,621
(gunshot)

22
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:31,921
- Padre, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

23
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:33,434
You gotta give me last rights.

24
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:34,452
- We're both gonna make it

25
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:36,013
if you just shut up.

26
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:38,653
- Padre, you never lie
in your sermons before.

27
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,580
That's why I came.

28
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,523
Don't start now.

29
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,493
Padre, please!

30
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,057
- [Soldier] Please!
(gunshot)

31
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:50,900
- Please!

32
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,150
Oh God, please!

33
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:01,075
(gunshot)

34
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:02,158
- Here we go.

35
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,704
(thundering)

36
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:19,954
(shouting)

37
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,203
(moaning)

38
00:03:28,513 --> 00:03:31,513
(breathing heavily)

39
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:14,695
(upbeat pop music)

40
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:17,278
(bell tolling)

41
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:21,471
- Oh hell.

42
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,200
- The zombie's aimless
wanderings come to fruition.

43
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,700
The revolting corpse roams
through the graveyard

44
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,703
searching for an evil sorcerer.

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,793
Kep away!

46
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:39,368
This spell gives me power.

47
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:41,570
(foreign language)

48
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,960
- Robbie, oh Robbie, Robbie, not again.

49
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,370
How many times we have to tell you?

50
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,780
This is why you keep having bad dreams.

51
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,760
- No it's not.

52
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,920
Yes it, what is this?

53
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,023
- Mom, it's just stories.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,200
- That's the last straw.

55
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,260
You are not spending another night

56
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,781
with screaming nightmares.

57
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,458
- Dad, no!

58
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,796
I bought them with my own money.

59
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:05,966
They're mine!

60
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,306
- Robbie, this is for your own good.

61
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:09,943
Phyllis, we will discuss this downstairs.

62
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,005
Bed, young man.
- No!

63
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:11,838
Please!

64
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:14,255
- The face of evil: Old Nick,

65
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,183
Beelzebub,

66
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,870
Lucifer.

67
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,710
(laughter)

68
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,500
Finally, just when we've run out of names,

69
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,823
we came up with the runaway winner.

70
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,763
Good candidate, but
still only a front man.

71
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,170
Now, the Bible tells us that Satan

72
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,390
lost the war in heaven
to God and His angels.

73
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,330
Assuming that fuhrer was on the same side,

74
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,330
Satan just lost the war
of all time on Earth.

75
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,663
Mr. Halloran.

76
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,130
There's 10 seconds left in the game.

77
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,470
Your team is down by one.

78
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,033
What's the call from the
point guard for hell?

79
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,620
- I'm safe.

80
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,700
- Don't worry, answering won't affect

81
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,301
your standing as a seminary student.

82
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:02,551
(laughter)

83
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,600
- Well, that's when it
can get a little ugly.

84
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,210
You can take the shot from the outside,

85
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,950
but odds are that you'll miss.

86
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,270
If you get it to your inside man,

87
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,670
you might run out the clock.

88
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,900
- Different kind of game.

89
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,773
Different kind of war.

90
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,360
In a world where the Prince
of Darkness has gone from

91
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,313
pitchfork ...

92
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,163
to pitch man.

93
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,380
In a world that's seen real evil.

94
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,500
In that world, Satan's
reduced to a thug, a mugger,

95
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,130
a scavenger on the
battlefield of good and evil,

96
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,100
a field where we are the players,

97
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,170
and the game has no timeouts.

98
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,050
(bell ringing)

99
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,883
Okay.

100
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,074
All right, I want you
to read Brest's chapter

101
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:51,460
on Ignatian on monotheism.

102
00:06:52,805 --> 00:06:55,222
I'll see you all of the game.

103
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:21,287
(glass shattering)

104
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,620
(commotion)

105
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:31,142
- [Man] We don't want guys like you here!

106
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,062
- [Man] First blacks, then commies!

107
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:38,812
(gospel singing)

108
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:43,114
- Jesus loves us, but he hates commies!

109
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:48,566
The Catholic church is white, not black!

110
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:52,233
- Which one of you
motherfuckers threw this?

111
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:57,064
We fought a war against people like you!

112
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:58,521
Officer, over here.

113
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,641
Come on, arrest them.

114
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:02,123
Officer.

115
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:04,327
Officer, all they're doing
is saying the rosary.

116
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:05,196
Since when is that a crime?

117
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:08,137
These are the people
you should be arresting.

118
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:10,290
(artillery whistling)

119
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,270
- You're outta line, padre.

120
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,830
Nobody goes to bat
(fireworks popping)

121
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,748
for a bunch of niggers, not on my beat.

122
00:08:14,748 --> 00:08:15,581
- [Soldier] Medic!

123
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:17,600
- Come on, come on.

124
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,850
(shouting)

125
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,277
(glass shattering)

126
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:25,860
- Fascist bastards!

127
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:29,590
All they're doing is praying.

128
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,757
- [Man] He's a priest, for God's sake!

129
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,170
- [Elderly Woman] Spirits
are never wrong, Robbie.

130
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,790
There is another way to
reach the other side.

131
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,700
- Spirits, tell me my fortune.

132
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,533
D.

133
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,290
A.

134
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,123
N.

135
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,523
G.

136
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,373
E.

137
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,200
R?

138
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,033
Danger?

139
00:08:57,961 --> 00:08:59,653
- The world is full of it.

140
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:01,273
This world and the next.

141
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,670
- Spirits, what kind of danger?

142
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,593
Some kinds are fun Aunt
Hanna, like in action comics.

143
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,694
- F.

144
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:14,527
R.

145
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,512
O.

146
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,022
M.

147
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:20,855
H.

148
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:22,709
E.

149
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,351
L.

150
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:28,184
L.

151
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,575
(ominous music)

152
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:31,408
From hell.

153
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:37,600
- What is going on here?

154
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,447
What is go...

155
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,500
We have talked about this nonsense, Hanna.

156
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,520
You know about his nightmares
and the bedwetting,

157
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,010
and still you play silly games

158
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,410
that you know will frighten him.

159
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,633
- How could it be
nonsense and frightening?

160
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,668
It hardly goes together, dear.

161
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:55,501
- What?

162
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,660
I will tell you what does not go together.

163
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,883
This gypsy hocus-pocus in a decent house.

164
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,200
- That's right, mom.

165
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,673
Why don't you just trash it?

166
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,080
Just like my comic books!

167
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,810
- Robbie, you come back here!

168
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,700
I take you in out of charity,
and this is how you repay me?

169
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,790
By undermining me?

170
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,820
Look what you have done!

171
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,997
- He was happy until you showed up.

172
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:27,360
He's always happy until you show up.

173
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,770
- That's because you
indulge his fantasies.

174
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,503
You never exercise a drop of discipline.

175
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:36,173
- Why bother with a drop when
you're drowning him in it?

176
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,773
The boy has no childhood left.

177
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,080
Now I know just what
you meant by repay you,

178
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,210
you and that nickel-and-dime
husband of yours.

179
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,170
- Oh, that's it.

180
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,923
- When I die, you will be paid in full.

181
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:57,524
In full.

182
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,824
In full.

183
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:11,760
- No, no, no.

184
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,763
Habeas corpus doesn't mean
they gotta find the body.

185
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,580
It means they gotta have
proof of the body of a crime,

186
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,360
like the car's gone, dog's
gone, bank vault's empty.

187
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,100
- So when when that lyin' bitch
says that I pulled the job

188
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,730
with her brother, it's like
her word against my word.

189
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,234
- You got it.

190
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,126
Now go tell that to your
idiot public defender.

191
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,450
- Thanks.

192
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,225
- Now, what was that
about the neighbor's wife?

193
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:40,713
- Bowden, Bowdeen, Bowdern.

194
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,810
- Yeah.

195
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,310
- Guy's here to pay your bail.

196
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,057
Says he lives with you.

197
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:48,140
(oohing)

198
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:57,994
- [Priest] Do you know where you are?

199
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:58,827
- [Fr. Bowdern] No.

200
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,710
- The Alexian brothers.

201
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,590
800 years ago they took in the lepers,

202
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,210
the insane, the mentally unbalanced.

203
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,830
Today, it's where the church sweeps

204
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,363
its current embarrassments under the rug.

205
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,633
Crazies.

206
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,740
Feeble-minded.

207
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,573
Criminally insane.

208
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,470
The drunks.

209
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,303
You know.

210
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:24,650
- I wasn't drunk, Ray.

211
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,543
I was just defending the faith.

212
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,910
- You want end up in there, Bill?

213
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,110
- [Patient] He's coming!

214
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,671
- Come on, now.
- Get him down.

215
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:39,504
He'll break the window.
- Get down.

216
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,560
- [Man] Come on, Thomas.

217
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,918
Easy there, come on.

218
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:45,710
Give me your hand.

219
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,543
Let go.

220
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:49,421
- Poor devil.

221
00:12:51,857 --> 00:12:53,274
- I'll die first.

222
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:55,760
- [Patient] He's coming!

223
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
He's coming!

224
00:12:58,031 --> 00:12:58,864
He's coming!

225
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:00,860
- Through his power resting upon us,

226
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,740
we may overcome the world
and be counted worthy

227
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,233
of the last to reign with
him eternally in heaven.

228
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,573
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

229
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,910
Hanna was loved by many but
known to a precious few.

230
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,793
Her niece Phyllis, her
dear grandson Ronnie.

231
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,450
- Grandson Ronnie.

232
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,570
Listen to him, going
on like even knew her.

233
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,356
Well at least the old pastor had met her.

234
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:29,270
- Karl.

235
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,103
- They're all alike.

236
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,753
- Karl, please show some respect.

237
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,710
- Now if we could have
a few silent moments

238
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,814
of respect and prayer.

239
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:40,231
(soft music)

240
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,710
- [Announcer] An incredible
eight miles per gallon.

241
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,800
- From high taxes to the
shameful mess in Korea,

242
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,980
he in inextricably woven
with the communist issue.

243
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,366
- Dad?

244
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:17,416
- What?

245
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,392
- Something's dripping in aunt...

246
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,518
In my room.

247
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:21,351
- Check the bathroom?

248
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:22,684
- Nothing there.

249
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,137
- God damn.

250
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,169
(dripping)

251
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,669
- It's over there.

252
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,150
What is that, a doll?

253
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,983
- [Robbie] Dummy.

254
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:52,967
- What?

255
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:53,800
- It's a ventriloquist dummy.

256
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,120
I made him myself.

257
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,857
- Put that much time into your schoolwork,

258
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,690
you'll have something.

259
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:08,402
(tapping)

260
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,423
- Oh, oh, oh, Jesus!

261
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:20,369
Ow!

262
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,340
- Find something?

263
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,540
- No!

264
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,373
Nothing.

265
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,663
Listen now.

266
00:15:30,478 --> 00:15:31,378
It stopped, right?

267
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:35,113
- I guess.

268
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:38,357
- All right, go to sleep.

269
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,150
You finished your homework, right?

270
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,830
- All done, but I had to help
him out with his spelling.

271
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,940
- That's funny.

272
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,173
But I think you gotta work on the lips.

273
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:54,711
There we go.

274
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,973
Good night.

275
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,056
- Good night.

276
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:09,911
(eerie music)

277
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:13,074
(creaking)

278
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,680
- [Hanna VOICEOVER] Robbie.

279
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,803
Robbie.

280
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,143
There is another way to
reach the other side.

281
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:32,177
There is another way.

282
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:34,410
There is another way.

283
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,160
(cheerful music)

284
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,360
- All right, everybody, listen to Tommy.

285
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,570
Get ready.

286
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,853
It's an atomic attack.

287
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,821
Everybody get ready to get under
your desks for safety sake.

288
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,011
And ...

289
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:54,844
Now!

290
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:59,085
Quick, quick, everybody, come on.

291
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,010
Robbie Mannheim, everybody includes you.

292
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,843
- But Larry...

293
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,490
- Uh-uh, no more excuses, young man.

294
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,913
Duck and cover now.

295
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,100
- Robbie doesn't have to worry.

296
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,950
His grandma's a Nazi spy.

297
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,530
- Yeah, she'll save his ass.

298
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,010
- My aunt.

299
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,060
And she wasn't a spy.

300
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:21,269
(laughing)

301
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,500
(shouting)

302
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,450
- Robbie Mannheim!

303
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,571
Why did you do that?

304
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:38,404
- I didn't do it.

305
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:41,240
It's my desk, it just moved by itself!

306
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,930
- You expect me to believe that?

307
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,263
(screaming)

308
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,930
- Robbie, Robbie?

309
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,370
Robbie, look at me, look at me.

310
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,430
Did you do this?

311
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,263
- No.

312
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:03,320
- Are you telling me the truth?

313
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,480
- I'm telling you the truth.

314
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,807
- I will deal with your
father when he gets home but...

315
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,527
All right, just sit there.

316
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,243
Hi.

317
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,327
It's all right, I called the school.

318
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,446
Everything's gonna be all right.

319
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:19,529
(overlapping speech)

320
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,160
- Well this is great.

321
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,993
Just great.

322
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:25,090
- Karl.

323
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,070
- Suspended from school.

324
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,390
Destruction of school property.

325
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,800
What the hell do you
think you're playing at?

326
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,227
- I wasn't playing, dad!

327
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:35,020
But I'm scared.
- Well you should be.

328
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,753
Now where do you think you'll
be if you don't finish school?

329
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,150
You're gonna be a bum.

330
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,400
A deadbeat.

331
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,790
- I know that.

332
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,623
- That's good.

333
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,310
Then promise me you'll never do

334
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,143
anything like this ever again.

335
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,310
- But dad, I swear I didn't do anything!

336
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,260
- That is just it!

337
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,339
- Karl, this is not gonna

338
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:56,970
accomplish anything.
- Phyllis, please stop!

339
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,826
- Look.
- Maybe this will, huh?

340
00:18:58,826 --> 00:18:59,763
- Oh, for god's sakes!

341
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,960
Karl, don't!
- Phyllis, sit down!

342
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,240
- Don't do this.

343
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:10,193
(dramatic music)

344
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:23,970
- Robbie.

345
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,765
How did you do that?

346
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:30,473
- I didn't do it!

347
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:34,556
It just moved by itself,
like the desk at school!

348
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,800
I'm gonna go to my room.

349
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,780
- There has got to be an
explanation for this, right?

350
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,803
I mean, maybe ...

351
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,880
Maybe when Robbie fell out
of the chair, the force,

352
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,310
it spun the chair around
and then it just...

353
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,260
- You look me in the eyes and
you tell me you believe that.

354
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,253
There is something very
wrong in this house.

355
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,620
- Bless me Father for I have sinned.

356
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,953
- How long has been since
your last confession?

357
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,773
- Six weeks.

358
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:16,798
- [Priest] And what
sins have you committed?

359
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:20,869
- I bore a false witness.

360
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:21,702
- How?

361
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:23,620
- I placed a couple of bets on the Browns.

362
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:27,733
- And how is that false witness?

363
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,033
- The team sucks now, no?

364
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:33,554
- Is there anything else?

365
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,830
- I've been ...

366
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,786
falling back into an old habit.

367
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,980
- [Priest] Well, if you
noticed it yourself,

368
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,433
can't you stop it yourself?

369
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,370
- Used to be able to.

370
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,723
Now I feel like ...

371
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,573
I feel like back in bootcamp when,

372
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,920
even though you know
you're gonna be a chaplain,

373
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,000
the Army's got you training because

374
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,883
you're gonna end up in combat anyway.

375
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,543
Now I'm in a different army.

376
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,343
But that thing.

377
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:23,114
That thing that's out
there with your name on it.

378
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:25,991
(ominous music)

379
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:26,824
I feel ...

380
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:28,591
it ...

381
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,419
It's still coming for me.

382
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,669
(creaking)

383
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,730
- Let's see what the spirits

384
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,763
have to say to us today, Robbie.

385
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,543
- Okay.

386
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Spirits, what are the messages
from the other side today?

387
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,910
I still say you're making it say

388
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,710
whatever you want it to, Aunt Hanna.

389
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:12,750
- [Robbie And Hanna] And maybe you're

390
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,970
making it say what you want.

391
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,323
- [Hanna] Spirits are never wrong, Robbie.

392
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,447
- Who are you?

393
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,040
- [Hanna And Demon] You will never guess.

394
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:34,277
- [Robbie] Fuck you, fuck you!

395
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:35,110
- Oh god.

396
00:22:36,284 --> 00:22:37,117
Karl.

397
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:40,856
We have to get some help.

398
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:41,876
- [Robbie] Go to hell!

399
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:42,709
- Please.

400
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,013
- Do whatever you like.

401
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:48,633
Just remember we're not made of money.

402
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,768
- [Robbie] Fuck all of you!

403
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:53,018
(shouting)

404
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:56,709
Fuck you!

405
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,792
Burn in hell!

406
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:03,110
- [Phyllis] The school guidance counselor

407
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,603
just couldn't wait to get rid of us.

408
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:06,160
- [Karl] Damn doctor
couldn't find anything

409
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,210
except 20 bucks out of my pocket.

410
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,710
And the psychiatrist?

411
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,030
You know, it's no wonder
they call them shrinks.

412
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,303
He sure shrunk my wallet.

413
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,685
- Any more moving objects?

414
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,237
- No.
- All the time.

415
00:23:17,237 --> 00:23:19,058
- No.
- Yes.

416
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:21,190
- [Robbie] The Union forever!

417
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,507
- [Karl] Yes.

418
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:23,340
- Karl.

419
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,030
- Would you stop denying it.

420
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,597
- Do either of you know
what a poltergeist is?

421
00:23:29,597 --> 00:23:30,970
Polter what?

422
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,820
- Poltergeist.

423
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,653
Here.

424
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,880
It's from the German.

425
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,333
It means noisy ghost.

426
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,687
- You mean you think we have a ghost.

427
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:42,430
- No, no.

428
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,700
You misunderstand.

429
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,990
The phenomenon you're describing

430
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,730
is not unknown to clergy or to science.

431
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,340
Most cases contain two
invariable elements:

432
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,260
an adolescent and noisy
inexplicable events

433
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,203
in the vicinity of said
adolescent, like moving objects.

434
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,760
Some cases go back as
far as eight centuries.

435
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,710
- You actually believe in this?

436
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,653
- Not just me.

437
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,760
- It's all right.

438
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,088
It's all right.

439
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:09,921
It's all right.

440
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:11,470
- Scholars all over the
world are studying this.

441
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,260
I correspond with a few.

442
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,276
On my day off, of course.

443
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:18,410
- Reverend Eckhardt, we just
want it to stop, please.

444
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,990
Things have gotten worse since Robbie

445
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,083
was suspended from school, and it ...

446
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,910
He's throwing temper tantrums worse

447
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,800
than a two-year-old, and
the profanity he uses...

448
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,400
- I would like to try something.

449
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,083
Here.

450
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,767
One moment.

451
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,785
Robbie?

452
00:24:43,785 --> 00:24:44,630
- [Robbie] Yeah?

453
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,980
- Could you come in here?

454
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,313
- [Robbie] Sure.

455
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,550
- Now, Robbie, you'd
like all these bad things

456
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,500
that are happening to stop, wouldn't you?

457
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,880
- Yes.

458
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,780
Sure.

459
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,600
- Then the first thing that we must do

460
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,660
is remove you from the
environment in which they occur.

461
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,260
- You mean his bedroom?

462
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,530
- No.

463
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,623
I mean this house.

464
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,200
There's plenty of room at mine.

465
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,179
(mysterious music)

466
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,283
- I canceled dinner with the Maynards.

467
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,880
I've made up the guest room.

468
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,450
- No, no, no, no.

469
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,904
Put him in the study.

470
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,753
I want to be able to observe him closely.

471
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,480
Get Eliot off the lawnmower and have him

472
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,867
help you move the bed where the couch is.

473
00:25:50,795 --> 00:25:51,628
- Eliot?

474
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:52,461
Eliot?

475
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,176
Excuse me.

476
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,009
- Yes, ma'am.

477
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:56,459
- Could you come inside please
and help me move the sofa?

478
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:58,643
- Oh, another one of them
sleepovers, eh, Mrs. Eckhardt?

479
00:25:58,643 --> 00:26:00,440
- Yes, the reverend frequently ministers

480
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,273
to troubled young boys.

481
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:02,870
- [Eliot] I know he does.

482
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,877
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

483
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:07,544
(ominous music)

484
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:14,380
- [Eckhardt VOICEOVER] To the
editor of Psychic Magazine.

485
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,070
Dear Professor Rhine, in my work

486
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,960
I have stumbled upon an
adolescent who seems to fit

487
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,250
the classic pattern of a
psychoactive prepubescent

488
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,180
worthy of publication
in your fine journal.

489
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,430
I will soon have an opportunity
to closely observe the child

490
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,390
for manifestations of abnormal behavior

491
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,870
fitting your description of a polter...

492
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:38,690
Of a poltergeist.

493
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,470
I will keep you informed
of all future developments.

494
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,220
Very truly yours,
Reverend Roland Eckhardt.

495
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,883
- Every word appropriate.

496
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,163
- What happened?

497
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:56,630
Did something happen?

498
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,963
- You keep saying that.

499
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:01,530
Can I go to bed?

500
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,480
- Sure.

501
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,313
Any minute.

502
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,550
Are you done.

503
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,003
- Any minute!

504
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:28,222
Okay.

505
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,023
There you go.

506
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,363
Sleep tight.

507
00:27:43,684 --> 00:27:46,434
(eerie rattling)

508
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,360
Good God.

509
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,533
Actual poltergeist manifestation.

510
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:08,536
(dramatic music)

511
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:09,863
It's incredible!

512
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:12,165
Yes.

513
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:14,396
(cuckoo clock whistling)

514
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:16,142
- [Robbie] What the hell is that?

515
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:17,209
What the hell?

516
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:18,792
Ah, get him off me!

517
00:28:20,627 --> 00:28:22,218
- Robbie, what is it?

518
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:23,051
- Get off of me!

519
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:23,885
- Stop fighting!

520
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:25,302
What's happening?

521
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,509
Robbie.

522
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:28,372
- [Robbie] Get me out of here!

523
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:29,205
Let me go!

524
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:31,919
(cloth tearing)

525
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,434
- Robbie, stop it!

526
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:34,358
- [Mrs. Eckhardt] Roland?

527
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:35,347
- Let go!

528
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,180
- What ...

529
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,830
What happened in here?

530
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,280
- I'll go make some hot chocolate.

531
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,720
- I can't explain it.

532
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:57,490
I thought I was a man of reason,

533
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,863
a man of science, and a man of God.

534
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,030
I am not sure of anything anymore.

535
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,873
The Catholics.

536
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,871
They should take him to the Catholics.

537
00:29:25,871 --> 00:29:27,070
(unsettling music)

538
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,023
They know about these things.

539
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:31,273
(shouting)

540
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:41,720
- [Mrs. Eckhardt] Oh my God!

541
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,670
You little bastard!

542
00:29:44,578 --> 00:29:46,995
(whimpering)

543
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,758
- Jesus.

544
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:04,591
Well they're still there.

545
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:05,930
- [Phyllis] Why won't they leave us alone?

546
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,582
He hasn't done anything!

547
00:30:07,582 --> 00:30:08,415
- [Karl] Done anything?

548
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:09,375
He just about killed somebody.

549
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,458
66 stitches.

550
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:11,963
What the hell possessed him to do that?

551
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:13,499
- [Phyllis] Do you realize
what you just said?

552
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:14,332
Possessed!

553
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:16,814
- [Karl] I'm the
ex-Catholic here, not you.

554
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:19,084
(shouting)

555
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:20,946
- [Phyllis] Robbie?

556
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:22,509
- Robbie?
- Robbie?

557
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:23,403
Robbie!

558
00:30:23,403 --> 00:30:24,250
Oh my God!

559
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,221
Karl!

560
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:26,471
Robbie, Robbie.

561
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:28,531
- Where does it hurt, son?

562
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:29,611
Son, where does it hurt?

563
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:31,528
- His chest, his chest.

564
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:38,416
Robbie.

565
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:41,967
Robbie, Robbie.

566
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:46,307
Do something!

567
00:30:49,602 --> 00:30:52,013
(cheerleaders chanting)

568
00:30:52,013 --> 00:30:54,346
- [Coach] Rebound, rebound!

569
00:31:03,826 --> 00:31:06,409
(bell tolling)

570
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,060
- You know, I swore I
would never step foot

571
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,160
in one of these again.

572
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,430
It's your idea, you do it.

573
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,130
- I'm gonna get you some help, Robbie.

574
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,343
You go for a walk with daddy, okay?

575
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,623
Karl?
- What?

576
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,080
- Please.

577
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,913
Go to him.

578
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,960
- Hey, pops.

579
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,753
What do you say we catch
a little hoop action?

580
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:15,150
- Forget the score.

581
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,468
Forget the clock.

582
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,237
Get the ball to Halloran

583
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:21,237
and take that ugly dog to get fixed!

584
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:27,519
(soft choral music)

585
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:40,968
- Right here.

586
00:32:44,864 --> 00:32:46,803
One Catholic school versus another.

587
00:32:46,803 --> 00:32:48,330
What's God gonna do?

588
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,230
Bet on both sides?

589
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,286
Come on, bud.

590
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:02,482
(cheering)

591
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:03,503
- Yes!

592
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:04,920
Now, there he is!

593
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,052
- Yes, now ...

594
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:10,224
there he is.

595
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:16,179
(eerie piano music)

596
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,260
- [Priest] Can I help you, ma'am?

597
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,624
(whistle blowing)

598
00:33:33,624 --> 00:33:34,769
- Charging.

599
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:37,449
St. Luis University number 10.
- What?

600
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:38,786
Guy's really funny.

601
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:40,260
He's still on the court.

602
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,313
- [Referee] You're out!

603
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,823
- I'm not a Catholic, reverend.

604
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,493
- Father.

605
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,570
God's mercy isn't rationed.

606
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,820
What exactly is your sin?

607
00:33:54,748 --> 00:33:55,581
- I ...

608
00:33:57,983 --> 00:34:00,203
I'm terrified of my own child.

609
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,070
My own child!

610
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,090
Please, help me, God!

611
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,000
- Come on, keep arguing with me.

612
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,850
There might be some other idiot call.

613
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,610
- [Phyllis] Love is a virtue, I know that,

614
00:34:14,107 --> 00:34:18,297
and I want to love him the
way I used to, but I can't.

615
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,560
It's so hard.

616
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,390
11 years.

617
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,710
Who could believe it?

618
00:34:27,852 --> 00:34:28,685
Oh God.

619
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:31,256
God help me, father.

620
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,170
Father.

621
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,317
Please!

622
00:34:36,317 --> 00:34:38,484
(sobbing)

623
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:40,832
I don't know!

624
00:34:52,446 --> 00:34:53,300
- [Priest VOICEOVER] Yesterday, a woman

625
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,080
came into the university chapel

626
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,530
when I was taking confession.

627
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,623
Talked about her 11-year-old son,

628
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,870
about how the family began to hear

629
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,233
strange noises in their house,

630
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,760
witnessed objects moving by themselves,

631
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,133
always around the boy.

632
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,244
- I can walk you to his room.

633
00:35:18,244 --> 00:35:19,244
- It's fine.

634
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,470
- [Priest VOICEOVER] Then
the child began to exhibit

635
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,433
abrupt changes in personality,

636
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,893
became morose, on occasion violent.

637
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,200
She said welts and claw-like marks

638
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,400
began to appear on his
body, marks the parents

639
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,340
interpreted as leading
them to the university.

640
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,653
- Robbie?
(knocking)

641
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,312
- [Priest VOICEOVER] Because the mother

642
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:50,950
seemed so agitated in confession

643
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:55,052
I brought along a bottle
of holy water, in case.

644
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,552
- [Priest] Robbie?

645
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,503
- [Priest VOICEOVER] Just when
I thought I didn't need it.

646
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,660
- Robbie?
- Surprise, Father!

647
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,640
- Somehow the child showed a strength

648
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,393
and a power I can only call superhuman.

649
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,090
I know this sounds like I might be crazy,

650
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,663
but I think this boy might be possessed.

651
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,537
- No, Ray, you don't sound crazy.

652
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:30,909
You sound like a raving lunatic

653
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:33,712
who just dropped in from the 12th century.

654
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:36,758
How many people claim
to have seen all this?

655
00:36:36,758 --> 00:36:40,080
- Well, parents, neighbors,
school teachers and students.

656
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,703
It's at least a dozen people.

657
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,170
It's a lot of evidence.

658
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,470
- That's a lot of hearsay.

659
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,590
- What, do you think they're all lying?

660
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,000
- No, they ...

661
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,250
they probably believe ...

662
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,121
everything they're telling you,

663
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:57,420
but so do the people who
believe they see flying saucers.

664
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,570
You never heard of mass hysteria?

665
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,420
- I know, but ...

666
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,840
Listen, when I was in that house,

667
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,680
I felt this sense of evil, you know?

668
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,260
Not evil as an idea.

669
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,390
Evil as a ...

670
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,233
As a force, you know?

671
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:14,872
As a presence.

672
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,869
It doesn't make sense unless
you've felt it yourself.

673
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:20,702
Nevermind.

674
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:24,290
(anxious music)

675
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,290
- So how'd you leave it with the family?

676
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,067
- I told them I'd come
back tomorrow and ...

677
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:32,821
- And you want a second opinion.

678
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,523
- Yeah.

679
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,547
- It'll cost you.

680
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,310
- Johnny Walker Red?

681
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,523
- I'm a priest, Ray?

682
00:37:41,528 --> 00:37:42,361
Black.

683
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,194
- Oh, black, black.

684
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,040
Ah, football tickets.

685
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,250
- [Karl] Teachers, guidance
councilors, shrinks.

686
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,213
Why not this?

687
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,760
- [Fr. Bowdern] I understand
you were raised Catholic.

688
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,770
- Yeah, do I get extra points for that,

689
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,550
or do you just pass the collection plate?

690
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,383
- Karl.

691
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,993
This is about Robbie.

692
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,746
- Straight to the point.

693
00:38:03,746 --> 00:38:04,610
I like that.

694
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,890
- I doubt that.

695
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,231
- Speaking of Robbie.

696
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:10,043
- Yes, fathers, please, come this way.

697
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,473
This goes outside.

698
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:19,060
- It's third door on your left.

699
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,340
- Yeah.

700
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,600
- Could I get another cup of coffee?

701
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,500
- Sure.
- Thanks.

702
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,140
- And some cake?
- Please.

703
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,100
- Abracadabra, kalalazam.

704
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,363
Spirits,

705
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,000
defy ...

706
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,833
gravity.

707
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:37,970
(knocking)

708
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:38,923
- Hello there.

709
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,953
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

710
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:43,943
- It's okay.

711
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:45,943
Got a spare.

712
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:47,943
- Listen, I'm father Bill.

713
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,633
This was real good.

714
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,830
Card tricks too?

715
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,180
- Sometimes.

716
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,013
Wanna see?

717
00:38:58,013 --> 00:38:58,846
- Sure.

718
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,533
What have we got here?

719
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:13,366
What's this?

720
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:14,199
Superman!

721
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:16,073
He's working with Batman now?

722
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,560
- You like comics?

723
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,630
- [Fr. Bowdern] Yeah.

724
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,960
- I thought that, well ...

725
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,580
Well, my mom says that
they're supposed to be evil.

726
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,095
- Listen, if reading the funnies is evil,

727
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:29,095
I'm in hot water myself.

728
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,430
That girl reporter, what's her name?

729
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,320
- Lois Lane!

730
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,110
- Yeah, Lois Lane.

731
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,362
She figured out he's the same guy yet?

732
00:39:38,362 --> 00:39:39,520
- No.

733
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,353
- Women.

734
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:42,010
You leave the toilet seat
up, they notice that.

735
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,330
But you put on eyeglasses,

736
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,670
and they don't notice you're the same guy

737
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,161
who was wearing long
johns five minutes ago.

738
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:52,056
(laughing)

739
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,920
- You know a lot about comics.

740
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,419
- Yeah, well, wait till you
get me started on football.

741
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:58,669
(creaking)

742
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:10,516
(faint shouting)

743
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,820
You collect tin soldiers, huh?

744
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,720
- Yup!

745
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,820
They're so real!

746
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,235
You can even see ranks and stuff.

747
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:24,643
(mimicking gunfire)

748
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:25,611
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

749
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:27,632
Yeah, yeah, come here.

750
00:40:27,632 --> 00:40:28,465
Here.

751
00:40:29,672 --> 00:40:31,222
I used to collect these myself.

752
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,179
Lost interest after the real thing.

753
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:35,269
- You were in the war?

754
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,324
- [William] Sure.

755
00:40:36,324 --> 00:40:37,190
- Were you in battles?

756
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,740
- I saw my share of action.

757
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,990
- [Robbie] What'd you do?

758
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,590
- Well let's have a look see.

759
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:45,853
That'd be me.

760
00:40:51,843 --> 00:40:53,830
- [Robbie] Medic?

761
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,560
- Yeah, our I'm medic
bought it in the Ardennes.

762
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,040
C.O. figured band of angels, band-aids,

763
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,215
what's the difference?

764
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:02,060
- Get wounded?

765
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,217
- Well, nothing an aspirin wouldn't fix.

766
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:06,723
- Okay, mister medic.

767
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,203
Father Bill?

768
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,560
- [G.I.] Padre, please.

769
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,133
Please.

770
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:24,990
- Can you help me?

771
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,883
(eerie music)

772
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,810
- What makes you think
you need help, Robbie?

773
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,663
- I know I've done some things.

774
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,863
Some really bad things.

775
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:46,319
But I don't remember any of it.

776
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,423
I'm not crazy or evil.

777
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,433
Just a kid.

778
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,827
I just want things to be like they were.

779
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:58,623
- Well, We'll get together
so and talk about it, okay?

780
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,524
- Whatever you say, sonny.

781
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,764
- A ventriloquist, huh?

782
00:42:07,764 --> 00:42:09,227
God bless.

783
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:12,133
- [Robbie And Hanna] God
bless you too, father Bill.

784
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:14,383
(laughing)

785
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:18,845
(barking)

786
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,762
- So?

787
00:42:20,762 --> 00:42:21,595
- Already?

788
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,003
No superhuman strength, just
toy soldiers and comic books.

789
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:29,080
- Is everything all right?

790
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,840
- He's a fine young man.

791
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,230
- Thank you.

792
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,210
And what about ...

793
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,650
- [Fr. Bowdern] I'm puzzled.

794
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,520
We'll talk, schedule something
in the next few days.

795
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,270
In the meantime, if you need us,

796
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,320
don't hesitate to call us at the rectory.

797
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,820
We'll be there for you.

798
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,740
Thank you, Father.

799
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,040
- Yes, thanks for nothing.

800
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,250
- We'll show ourselves out.

801
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,450
It was good meeting you.

802
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:59,590
- You'll have your game tickets tomorrow.

803
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,548
- I'm not sure I earned them, Ray.

804
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:03,881
(screaming)

805
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:09,815
(dramatic music)

806
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:12,148
- Fuck you, fucker!
- Robbie!

807
00:43:13,643 --> 00:43:15,976
(screaming)

808
00:43:17,934 --> 00:43:18,989
Fuck you!

809
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:21,075
Fuck fucking God!

810
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:21,908
Fuck!

811
00:43:21,908 --> 00:43:22,741
Fuck!

812
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:28,449
(moaning)

813
00:43:31,063 --> 00:43:33,980
(foreign language)

814
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,100
- [Reporter] A communist atomic bomb.

815
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,280
- [Woman] Oh my God.

816
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,850
- [Reporter] Thanks to the Rosenbergs,

817
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:53,850
a nuclear sword of Damoclea
hangs over everyone watching...

818
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:54,833
- Come on, Eddie.

819
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,913
Thanks.

820
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,060
- Padre, is that you?

821
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,893
Please!

822
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:07,610
- [Reporter] The frontline has
now become every household.

823
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,941
- Hey, do you want to put
on something more conducive?

824
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:10,774
- [Eddie] Conducive to what?

825
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:12,113
- Me staying a regular customer.

826
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,977
- [Woman] There's no place to hide.

827
00:44:16,977 --> 00:44:19,144
- [Man] Pretty scary, huh?

828
00:44:23,362 --> 00:44:25,762
- [Woman] That fallout
stuff, you can't even see it.

829
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:27,690
- [Woman] They could nuke us in our sleep.

830
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,857
- [Man] Not if we hit those
commie bastards first.

831
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:37,570
- How much time did they
spend on possessions

832
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,420
when you were in seminary?

833
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,520
- One lecture, and a multiple choice test.

834
00:44:43,803 --> 00:44:45,803
- That puts you one lecture ahead of me.

835
00:44:47,777 --> 00:44:48,690
You saw what the blood spelled

836
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,240
on the kid's belly, didn't you?

837
00:44:51,443 --> 00:44:53,252
- [Woman] Did you hear what
those priests just said?

838
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:54,255
- Shh!

839
00:44:54,255 --> 00:44:55,588
They'll hear us.

840
00:44:56,787 --> 00:44:59,690
- And you know what he
said in Latin, don't you?

841
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:03,653
- Minister of Christ, can't
you see I'm the devil?

842
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,683
Why do you bother me?

843
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,600
- According to the family,

844
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,270
the kid has no religious
training whatsoever.

845
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,340
He never studied Latin or
any other foreign language.

846
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,750
- Well maybe he went to the library.

847
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,600
They've got books on magic there too.

848
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,560
- You think he's playing a game?

849
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,110
- I think whatever he's
doing, it's a cry for help,

850
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:27,303
even if he doesn't know he's doing it.

851
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,843
We're gonna have to run
this by the archbishop, Ray.

852
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,860
- How much do you think I should tell him?

853
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,903
- If you want to get in the
door, as little as possible.

854
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,620
- Apropos of the septic of hell,

855
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:45,513
I heard of an Irish
woman who went to Moscow,

856
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,550
and she met a communist over there

857
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,243
who helped her onto a tram.

858
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,630
She was rather surprised.

859
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,267
And she turned to him and she said,

860
00:45:57,267 --> 00:46:00,802
"May the good Lord find a nice
cool spot in hell for you."

861
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:03,052
(laughing)

862
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,830
- Look at that.

863
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,550
Bishop Sheen is a celebrity.

864
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,940
You both know what a Nielsen
rating is, don't you?

865
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,420
Well his is higher than Milton Berle's.

866
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,897
And when Milton heard that, he said,

867
00:46:15,897 --> 00:46:19,386
"Well, the Bishop has better writers."

868
00:46:19,386 --> 00:46:21,490
(laughing)

869
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,960
And the wedding of the the past year?

870
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,400
Senator Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier.

871
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,233
Catholic wedding.

872
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:30,690
- Your excellency, what does all this

873
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,310
have to do with our request?

874
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,490
- It has everything to do with it.

875
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,270
We're trying to bring the
church into the 20th century.

876
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:40,963
I can't approve of a medieval
relic like an exorcism.

877
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,960
- We don't know that it would ever

878
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,307
come to that, your excellency.

879
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:49,763
All we want to do is investigate, for now.

880
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:51,490
- For the love of heaven!

881
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:55,243
I recently desegregated the archdiocese.

882
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:59,702
Like it or not, that puts
the church in the spotlight.

883
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:01,720
Or the crosshairs.

884
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,920
You're naive, or a fool.

885
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,883
Last I heard, Jesuits were neither.

886
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,520
- The events are surrounding this boy

887
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,340
defy easy explanation, your excellency.

888
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,113
We saw something.

889
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,900
Now, this family has nowhere
to turn, your excellency.

890
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,050
We can't just walk away.

891
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,213
There is a moral imperative here.

892
00:47:26,322 --> 00:47:28,310
- You just listen to me.

893
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:32,210
The spectacle of an
exorcism would undermine

894
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,940
everything good that
we've tried to accomplish,

895
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,110
would destroy all the progress we've made

896
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,230
to show that Catholics

897
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,810
are as American and as modern

898
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:45,643
as anyone.

899
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,500
If I allow this, what's next?

900
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,260
Indulgences?

901
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,630
- Wait a minute.

902
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,300
- Thank you for your
time, your excellency.

903
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,840
- [Fr. Bowdern] One more
minute, your excellency.

904
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,203
- This discussion is over.

905
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:03,503
I'm talking to you now,
as one priest to another.

906
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:08,600
Politics and Nielsen ratings aside,

907
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,000
the soul of a child

908
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,423
may be in jeopardy.

909
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,510
- Father Bowdern, your
faith and your passion

910
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,340
have been amply demonstrated.

911
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,893
Now demonstrate some patience.

912
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,620
Leave us alone with father McBride.

913
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:40,855
For most of my life,
I watched America grow

914
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,463
from being suspicious of
Catholics to embracing them.

915
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,950
I was hoping I could keep things that way.

916
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:50,783
But now ...

917
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,143
I've changed my mind.

918
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,053
I'll allow the rite of exorcism.

919
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,293
- Very good, excellency.

920
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:05,800
Father Bowdern and I took the
liberty of drafting a list

921
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:10,930
of suitable candidates to
perform the exorcism if need be.

922
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,920
- Oh, that's most impressive.

923
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,610
Why is it I see so little of your friend

924
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:16,680
at the archdiocese retreats?

925
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,280
- He's very busy.

926
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,860
He teaches with me at SLU,

927
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,530
and he's also the pastor
at the University Chapel.

928
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,600
- Ah, St. Francis Xavier's.

929
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,190
So technically, he answers to the rector

930
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,393
at the university and not the archdiocese.

931
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,080
- [Fr. McBride] Mm-hm.

932
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,550
- Yes, well, I've made my decision.

933
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,150
- Who have you chosen?

934
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,220
- Father Bowdern.

935
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:47,253
(chuckling)

936
00:49:47,253 --> 00:49:49,200
- He's not on the list.

937
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,540
- Not because he's unqualified?

938
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,370
- Oh, no, no, he's one of
the finest priests I know.

939
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,287
But as I said, I went through
the archdiocese roster...

940
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:58,910
- And as I said, the
staff at the university

941
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,433
is not officially on
the archdiocese roster.

942
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:06,521
(soft music)

943
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:15,210
- I believe Father Bowdern
to be an excellent choice.

944
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:18,160
- (chuckling) I'm very pleased
you think so right, Raymond.

945
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,570
I admire your counsel and your discretion.

946
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,248
- Thank you, your excellency.

947
00:50:22,248 --> 00:50:24,920
- And for that very reason,
you will assist Father Bowdern.

948
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:32,080
Now, this whole matter
must be kept confidential.

949
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,070
For the privacy of the boy and his family.

950
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,980
You and the father both will
carry on your regular duties

951
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,823
as though nothing has changed.

952
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:44,742
However, you will report to me.

953
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,829
- Thank you, your excellency.

954
00:50:56,609 --> 00:51:00,026
(emotional choral music)

955
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:27,948
- Are you shitting me?

956
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,010
Once a demon possesses its victim,

957
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:36,360
it mocks the Holy Trinity by
proceeding in three stages.

958
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,960
The first stage is
infestation, then obsession,

959
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,953
and finally actual possession.

960
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,700
- So the noises in Robbie's
house after his aunt died

961
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,687
would have been signs of infestation.

962
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:51,900
And the marks on his body
now represent obsession.

963
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,070
- Yeah, and all that's
left is actual possession,

964
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,130
when a demon occupies a human body

965
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,743
and feeds off the victim's soul.

966
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,990
- Bill, if this is right, then Robbie,

967
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,970
he's running out of time.

968
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,921
And he's not the only one, so are we.

969
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:08,220
- Yeah, it says here if
the exorcist demonstrates

970
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,050
sufficient faith will
and courage, the victim

971
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,910
may be saved during the first two stages,

972
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,260
but once possession has occurred

973
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:18,973
the victim's last hope
is the time of changing.

974
00:52:21,036 --> 00:52:22,324
- Time of changing, what's that?

975
00:52:22,324 --> 00:52:24,160
- I don't know, it doesn't say.

976
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,820
- Changing, some sort of metamorphosis,

977
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,253
maybe from one stage to another.

978
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,693
- Or one host to another.

979
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:36,320
- Dewey decimal says that
there's the detailed account

980
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,960
of an exorcism took place in
France in the 17th century,

981
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,890
but I can't find it anywhere.

982
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,050
- Look, I'll keep on looking.

983
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:44,883
Look, you take this.

984
00:52:44,883 --> 00:52:46,950
Your German is better than mine.

985
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,017
Well, take them all.

986
00:52:49,507 --> 00:52:52,340
(speaking German)

987
00:52:53,881 --> 00:52:56,798
(mysterious music)

988
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,170
I got it.

989
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,937
Detailed description of an
exorcism in 17th century France.

990
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,019
- Thank you, Saint Anthony.

991
00:53:53,884 --> 00:53:56,134
(shouting)

992
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:02,370
(throat clearing)

993
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:03,730
- Sorry.

994
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:04,633
- Silverfish.

995
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:06,690
They like old books.

996
00:54:08,192 --> 00:54:09,392
I suppose you know that.

997
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:19,513
Use your war experiences.

998
00:54:19,513 --> 00:54:21,073
- What?

999
00:54:21,073 --> 00:54:21,990
- Well, you were in France.

1000
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:25,883
You said you translated for
your unit, so translate.

1001
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:32,478
- See what it says.

1002
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:33,600
In 1634, a group of Jesuits
attempted to exorcize

1003
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,900
several nuns who were
believed to be possessed.

1004
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,650
Father Jean-Joseph Surin

1005
00:54:42,727 --> 00:54:44,900
concentrated on the worst case,

1006
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,620
the prioress of the convent
sister Jean des Ange.

1007
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,100
According to Surin,

1008
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:56,100
the turning point came
after he forced the demon

1009
00:54:56,170 --> 00:55:00,873
to reveal its hidden-in-hand
time of changing,

1010
00:55:01,783 --> 00:55:03,700
when the demon was susceptible.

1011
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,803
Susceptible and vulnerable.

1012
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,003
- Uh-huh.

1013
00:55:10,003 --> 00:55:11,770
- At that moment the priest personally

1014
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,363
challenged the demon to ...

1015
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:19,881
To confront him.

1016
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:21,743
Directly.

1017
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,943
Well, the exorcism was successful.

1018
00:55:31,835 --> 00:55:32,835
Although ...

1019
00:55:35,931 --> 00:55:39,681
Although Father Surin
went mad in the effort.

1020
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:46,733
- It's a lucky thing you found that book.

1021
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:49,903
- Well, let's pray it was luck.

1022
00:55:51,864 --> 00:55:54,114
(pounding)

1023
00:55:56,382 --> 00:55:58,882
(eerie music)

1024
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,320
If we need you, we'll let you know.

1025
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,253
In the meantime, pray for us.

1026
00:56:18,577 --> 00:56:20,127
And especially pray for Robbie.

1027
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:23,893
Mr. Halloran, we may need
you in the backcourt.

1028
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,690
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1029
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,150
Blessed art thou amongst women

1030
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,610
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1031
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,000
- [Together] Holy Mary, mother
of God, pray for us sinners

1032
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,454
now and at the hour of hour death, amen.

1033
00:56:37,454 --> 00:56:40,371
(speaking Latin)

1034
00:56:40,371 --> 00:56:43,555
(unsettling music)

1035
00:56:43,555 --> 00:56:44,805
- Oh, I get it.

1036
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,530
You think you can drive me
out with a fucking baptism!

1037
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,320
- You handled Loyola, Jamie.

1038
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,420
You can handle this.

1039
00:56:53,762 --> 00:56:54,595
Pray.

1040
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:01,766
(speaking Latin)

1041
00:57:02,901 --> 00:57:05,244
- Don't speak that Latin shit!

1042
00:57:05,244 --> 00:57:06,994
Talk fucking English!

1043
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,259
- Do you renounce Satan and all his works?

1044
00:57:11,259 --> 00:57:12,759
- Renounce my ass!

1045
00:57:13,816 --> 00:57:16,461
- Is that Robbie speaking or it?

1046
00:57:16,461 --> 00:57:18,303
- I don't know.

1047
00:57:18,303 --> 00:57:20,136
I'm talking to Robbie.

1048
00:57:21,073 --> 00:57:24,306
Do you renounce Satan and all his works?

1049
00:57:24,306 --> 00:57:26,556
(snarling)

1050
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:29,544
- Robbie?

1051
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:31,120
What are they doing?

1052
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,680
Robbie?

1053
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,513
Robbie?

1054
00:57:33,513 --> 00:57:34,346
- [Fr. Bowdern] Jamie, stop them.

1055
00:57:34,346 --> 00:57:35,179
Don't let them in.

1056
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:38,544
- Father, Father, please, please, please.

1057
00:57:38,544 --> 00:57:41,294
(speaking Latin)

1058
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:46,160
Robbie!

1059
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,733
Do you renounce Satan and all his works?

1060
00:57:50,038 --> 00:57:51,185
- I ...

1061
00:57:51,185 --> 00:57:53,437
I, I renounce Satan

1062
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:55,090
and all, and all his works.

1063
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,040
- And you believe in God.

1064
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,543
- I believe in God.

1065
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:02,409
(speaking Latin)

1066
00:58:12,324 --> 00:58:15,900
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1067
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,140
- [Together] Blessed art
thou amongst women and...

1068
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:17,973
- Women!

1069
00:58:18,892 --> 00:58:19,900
(giggling)

1070
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,733
Women.

1071
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:23,270
You leave the toilet seat
up, and they notice that.

1072
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:25,860
But you put on a pair of eyeglasses,

1073
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,450
and they don't realize you're the same guy

1074
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:31,703
who was wearing long
johns five minutes ago.

1075
00:58:34,029 --> 00:58:36,279
(shouting)

1076
00:58:41,693 --> 00:58:44,457
What's the matter, guys?

1077
00:58:44,457 --> 00:58:46,124
Can't walk on water?

1078
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:49,588
(giggling)

1079
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:02,900
- He's just a little kid.

1080
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,541
How can he hold that much liquid?

1081
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,291
(speaking Latin)
It's not natural.

1082
00:59:07,702 --> 00:59:08,535
- Speak English, shit head!

1083
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:13,370
- Tell me your name and time of departure.

1084
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,060
Tell me your name and time of departure!

1085
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,151
- Never.

1086
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:16,984
He's mine.

1087
00:59:19,701 --> 00:59:22,747
How's that for a nutcracker?

1088
00:59:22,747 --> 00:59:26,176
- Well I guess we're just
gonna have to start over again.

1089
00:59:26,176 --> 00:59:27,727
In Greek and then Latin.

1090
00:59:27,727 --> 00:59:28,560
- Fuck you.

1091
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,070
(speaking Greek)

1092
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,248
Abracadara.

1093
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:33,081
Alakazam.

1094
00:59:36,496 --> 00:59:38,362
- [Toy Train] All aboard!

1095
00:59:38,362 --> 00:59:41,530
All aboard the Holiday Express.

1096
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:42,944
All aboard!

1097
00:59:42,944 --> 00:59:44,996
Train leaving now for birthdays,

1098
00:59:44,996 --> 00:59:47,579
Christmas, Candy Land, and fun.

1099
00:59:48,695 --> 00:59:52,177
All aboard!

1100
00:59:54,276 --> 00:59:57,125
- Tell me your name and time of departure.

1101
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:59,350
- I will never depart until this child

1102
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:02,097
speaks my hidden name,
and he will never say it.

1103
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:04,650
- Oh, you will speak, demon.

1104
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,435
Tell me your name and...

1105
01:00:06,435 --> 01:00:09,480
(coughing)

1106
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,467
Tell me your name and time of changing.

1107
01:00:11,467 --> 01:00:13,960
(roaring)

1108
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,233
- [Hanna] I can see you in hell, Father.

1109
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,523
- [Halloran] That looks
like Roman numerals.

1110
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,990
Is that a one?

1111
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:47,823
11.

1112
01:00:49,467 --> 01:00:50,300
One.

1113
01:00:57,309 --> 01:00:59,680
- [Radio DJ] Despite the
continuing turmoil and walkouts,

1114
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,170
Archbishop Hume warned
he would excommunicate

1115
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:03,880
any Catholic school administrator

1116
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,400
who hindered the immigration plan.

1117
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,830
But if you are cutting school,
here's a song to do it.

1118
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,650
- Mrs. Mannheim, these are great.

1119
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,040
I could eat a horse.

1120
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,230
- He's not kidding, you know.

1121
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:16,367
We feed him a pony before
every game, right Ray?

1122
01:01:16,367 --> 01:01:17,327
- Yeah, right.

1123
01:01:17,327 --> 01:01:19,577
(groaning)

1124
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,883
- Is this just a grownup party?

1125
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,480
'Cause I'm starving.

1126
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:32,733
- How are you?

1127
01:01:33,712 --> 01:01:34,545
How do you feel?

1128
01:01:34,545 --> 01:01:35,470
- Fine.

1129
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:36,450
- [Phyllis] Yeah?

1130
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:37,473
- Sticky.

1131
01:01:37,473 --> 01:01:39,043
And hungry.

1132
01:01:39,043 --> 01:01:40,710
- Here, have a seat.

1133
01:01:42,006 --> 01:01:42,839
- Thanks.

1134
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:43,805
- Here, here.

1135
01:01:43,805 --> 01:01:44,638
- Thanks.

1136
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,030
- Father Bill.

1137
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:52,150
I had this dream, and
you were shouting at me.

1138
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:53,343
- Never at you, Robbie.

1139
01:01:55,354 --> 01:01:56,783
Never at you.

1140
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,880
- Those numbers on his body,
I never saw anything like it.

1141
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,987
No one's ever seen anything like it.

1142
01:02:08,987 --> 01:02:09,820
- Someone has.

1143
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,670
Remember, Bill?

1144
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:11,720
Father Surin in France.

1145
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,420
Remember that book you found?

1146
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,720
There's a hidden name,
date, time of changing.

1147
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,840
The archbishop should be pleased.

1148
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,680
We might have two out of three.

1149
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,540
- Well let's not start
reading tea leaves, Ray.

1150
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,150
We don't have jack.

1151
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:23,480
And those marks on the kid's body,

1152
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,640
they could have been anything.

1153
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,270
- But Father, you saw them.

1154
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:28,250
One, 11, one.

1155
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,110
So that could be a date.

1156
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:32,910
- Day, month, a time.

1157
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,463
All right, it's October 28th.

1158
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:38,170
In four days it'll be November first.

1159
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,450
- All Saints Day.

1160
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:40,770
And that's the day after Halloween.

1161
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:41,870
- Yeah, the old pagan holiday,

1162
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:44,120
which at midnight becomes a sacred day.

1163
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,910
Bill, that might be your time of changing.

1164
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:49,413
The old gods out, the one God in.

1165
01:02:51,277 --> 01:02:53,277
The first few seconds of All Saints Day.

1166
01:02:54,454 --> 01:02:55,505
Is that too perfect?

1167
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,387
- All Saints Day.

1168
01:02:57,387 --> 01:02:58,220
Yeah.

1169
01:02:59,846 --> 01:03:01,336
Perfect.

1170
01:03:01,336 --> 01:03:04,775
(mysterious music)

1171
01:03:04,775 --> 01:03:07,108
(muttering)

1172
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:54,049
- You're not the first?

1173
01:03:54,936 --> 01:03:56,686
- Call the President!

1174
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,622
He's expecting my call.

1175
01:03:59,622 --> 01:04:01,887
- We'll call the President
after you have your nap.

1176
01:04:01,887 --> 01:04:02,720
- Okay.

1177
01:04:04,762 --> 01:04:06,365
It's very important.

1178
01:04:06,365 --> 01:04:07,615
- I understand.

1179
01:04:10,386 --> 01:04:11,386
- Excuse me.

1180
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:16,825
Do you have any idea
where I can find this man?

1181
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:18,500
- He's over there.

1182
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,333
- Thanks.

1183
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:26,879
No, thanks.

1184
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,201
- Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

1185
01:04:41,194 --> 01:04:43,444
(shouting)

1186
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:04,019
Reverend Eckhardt?

1187
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:10,288
You, um ...

1188
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:14,163
You sent this?

1189
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:23,067
- In the beginning, there was the word.

1190
01:05:23,067 --> 01:05:26,100
(parrot squawking)

1191
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:26,933
- Right.

1192
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:31,130
Right.

1193
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,030
My name is...

1194
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,424
- Legion!

1195
01:05:33,424 --> 01:05:34,257
- What?

1196
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,633
What did you say?

1197
01:05:46,184 --> 01:05:47,275
How did you find me?

1198
01:05:47,275 --> 01:05:50,108
(startling music)

1199
01:05:51,188 --> 01:05:53,588
- [Eckhardt] You've felt
its power, haven't you?

1200
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,363
- It?

1201
01:06:01,402 --> 01:06:02,817
- The child!

1202
01:06:02,817 --> 01:06:06,150
The child is just the bait,

1203
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,430
the lure, the trap.

1204
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:09,743
- I don't understand.

1205
01:06:12,085 --> 01:06:13,373
- Words, words, words.

1206
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,333
Useless.

1207
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,250
Picture paints a thousand.

1208
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,467
So be it.

1209
01:06:20,467 --> 01:06:23,134
(cloth tearing)

1210
01:06:27,496 --> 01:06:29,746
(shouting)

1211
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,666
The boy is just the bait!

1212
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:42,123
You are the real target!

1213
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:46,730
And he will suck you down into the pit!

1214
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:48,773
And he will chew you to bits!

1215
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,243
Just ...

1216
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:53,440
like ...

1217
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,610
Just like me.

1218
01:06:56,994 --> 01:06:57,827
Me!

1219
01:07:00,774 --> 01:07:03,191
(whimpering)

1220
01:07:11,344 --> 01:07:14,094
(speaking Latin)

1221
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:23,375
(parrot shrieking)

1222
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,013
- [Broadcaster] We now
conclude our broadcast day.

1223
01:07:30,928 --> 01:07:33,845
(mysterious music)

1224
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:55,727
- [Hanna] They discard the carcass.

1225
01:07:57,355 --> 01:07:58,772
We are beyond it.

1226
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:02,675
Now we inhabit ...

1227
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:07,848
- Flesh.

1228
01:08:23,787 --> 01:08:25,464
(shouting)

1229
01:08:25,464 --> 01:08:28,547
- [Disembodied Voice] All Saints Day.

1230
01:08:34,522 --> 01:08:35,939
- Father Bowdern?

1231
01:08:40,962 --> 01:08:42,824
Father Bowdern?

1232
01:08:42,824 --> 01:08:44,324
Are you all right?

1233
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,653
- I'm fine.

1234
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:54,140
You look like you could
do with some sleep.

1235
01:08:59,196 --> 01:09:02,090
How do you feel about a day trip?

1236
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:03,697
If we're right about the ...

1237
01:09:05,414 --> 01:09:07,593
that date and time of changing,

1238
01:09:09,143 --> 01:09:11,113
all of us, you, me and Robbie,

1239
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:14,037
are gonna need to spend some
time on sacred, holy ground.

1240
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,530
Which way would you like to go, Robbie?

1241
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:28,290
- The Paths of the Saints, of course.

1242
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,510
- I have to move the car, Father.

1243
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:30,343
I'll catch up.

1244
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,330
- Come on, father Bill.

1245
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,533
Let us share the lives of the holy.

1246
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:42,885
(ominous music)

1247
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:54,143
Who's this?

1248
01:09:54,143 --> 01:09:55,620
- Ah, that's Saint Joseph.

1249
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,068
When our Lord was a little child,

1250
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,718
Saint Joseph was his mentor,
his teacher, his father.

1251
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,737
- Like you are with me, Father Bill.

1252
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:18,520
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1253
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,350
Blessed art thou among women,

1254
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,833
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1255
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:30,213
Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners.

1256
01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:38,617
(uneasy music)

1257
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:42,020
- Now at at the hour of our deaths.

1258
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:44,119
Amen.

1259
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:45,640
- A week away from election day.

1260
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,790
Your excellency, you've
seen this headline?

1261
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:52,110
- Father Walsh, but what can I say?

1262
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:55,810
- I'm sure your organization
has the very best

1263
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,893
of intentions, as do you, senator.

1264
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:02,933
- Italy is not the Vatican, or the church.

1265
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:05,610
- Tell that to the voters.

1266
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:08,160
My opponents are already
playing the Catholic card.

1267
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:09,953
This doesn't help.

1268
01:11:13,684 --> 01:11:16,601
(mysterious music)

1269
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,753
- Ooh, this one is really cool!

1270
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:31,432
Who is it?

1271
01:11:31,432 --> 01:11:32,432
- That's ...

1272
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:35,240
That's Saint Michael the Archangel.

1273
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,813
He's that protector of ...

1274
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:40,758
men in ...

1275
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,430
men in battle.

1276
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:45,680
(groaning)

1277
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,249
- Oh my goodness, Father Bowdern.

1278
01:11:50,249 --> 01:11:51,263
Is something wrong?

1279
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:53,904
- Just dizzy.

1280
01:11:53,904 --> 01:11:55,775
(thundering)

1281
01:11:55,775 --> 01:11:56,843
I'm fine.

1282
01:11:56,843 --> 01:11:58,260
- I'll get Jamie.

1283
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,253
- Robbie, no, come back!

1284
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,923
- I shall be around next week, senator,

1285
01:12:12,225 --> 01:12:13,680
to show that American Catholics

1286
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,553
stand united against communism,

1287
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:20,093
no matter where it rears its ungodly head.

1288
01:12:22,864 --> 01:12:25,614
(dramatic music)

1289
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,153
- Sisters!

1290
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:54,743
Robbie!

1291
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,973
- The little boy, where did he go?

1292
01:13:18,548 --> 01:13:19,381
- Oh God.

1293
01:13:25,765 --> 01:13:26,682
Oh, Robbie.

1294
01:13:29,066 --> 01:13:31,816
(dramatic music)

1295
01:13:35,531 --> 01:13:36,364
No!

1296
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:42,123
(groaning)

1297
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:56,615
- I told you I'd see you in hell, Father.

1298
01:14:00,237 --> 01:14:02,487
(groaning)

1299
01:14:09,337 --> 01:14:11,507
- [Jamie] Hang on, Father.

1300
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:12,340
- What?

1301
01:14:13,521 --> 01:14:14,777
No!

1302
01:14:14,777 --> 01:14:15,694
No, no, no!

1303
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,870
- As to your election,
Senator, I can only quote

1304
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:27,293
from the Oracle at
Delphi: be a great victor.

1305
01:14:28,626 --> 01:14:31,459
(woman screaming)

1306
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,183
- Step back now.

1307
01:14:35,183 --> 01:14:36,016
Careful.

1308
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,050
- [Archbishop] You said it was over.

1309
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,330
- [Fr. McBride] Almost over.

1310
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:46,290
- That's a premature observation.

1311
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:48,500
- That I did not make, your excellency.

1312
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,740
- You were supposed to keep
this whole matter under wraps.

1313
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:54,753
Instead, it was right in the center ring.

1314
01:14:58,388 --> 01:15:01,320
Do yo know how many people
witnessed this fiasco?

1315
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,170
- Besides God?

1316
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,140
- Don't be impertinent.

1317
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:08,030
You told me that the boy has
shown no symptoms now for days.

1318
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,910
- That's right, until this afternoon's,

1319
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,510
how did you call it, fiasco.

1320
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:13,123
- Well that's how a demonic.

1321
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:16,790
Simply got too close to the
edge, slipped and panicked.

1322
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:17,810
And who wouldn't?

1323
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:19,240
- [McBride] That is your explanation?

1324
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,090
- No, that's my observation.

1325
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:22,440
If the boy had had a
fever, he would have been

1326
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,340
considered out of danger after a week.

1327
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:27,080
I want one of the attending physicians

1328
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,510
to give me a diagnosis.

1329
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:29,343
- Do what you like.

1330
01:15:29,343 --> 01:15:30,770
I'm a priest, not a doctor.

1331
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:32,580
- That's not an answer.

1332
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:36,263
Do you consider this boy
to be possessed by a demon?

1333
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,960
- I can't say for
certain, your excellency.

1334
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,810
Half the literature tells me yes.

1335
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:43,820
The other half tells me that

1336
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,070
it's a matter for a psychiatrist.

1337
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:47,000
- And father Bowdern?

1338
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:47,833
- I can't speak for him.

1339
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:48,666
- Of course you can.

1340
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:49,750
You've known the man for years.

1341
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,012
- He's using the Roman ritual

1342
01:15:51,012 --> 01:15:53,690
in the Surin case from 17th France...

1343
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:55,310
- This is the 20th century America.

1344
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:56,770
- Well according to those two sources,

1345
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:59,923
there should only be one
more exorcism session.

1346
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:03,703
Perhaps two.

1347
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:05,403
- One.

1348
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,163
Father McBride.

1349
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:12,018
One.

1350
01:16:12,018 --> 01:16:12,851
- [Robbie] Fuck you!

1351
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:13,684
Fuck everyone!

1352
01:16:13,684 --> 01:16:15,423
- Father Bowdern, please help us.

1353
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:19,610
Why is this happening to us, to Robbie?

1354
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:22,450
He asks us, and we don't have any answers.

1355
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:24,390
Did we do something, did we do something?

1356
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:25,390
- [Bowdern] No, no you didn't, Phyllis,

1357
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:26,615
no more than any of us.

1358
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:28,600
- [Robbie] Fucker!

1359
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,924
- I wish I could give you
the answer, but I can't.

1360
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:32,133
Why did ...

1361
01:16:33,104 --> 01:16:35,650
our Lord pick Judas Iscariot
as one of his disciples?

1362
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:38,330
Was it God's will he choose and trust

1363
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,583
a man who would betray him?

1364
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:41,773
I don't know.

1365
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:44,920
But this I do know.

1366
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:48,380
Evil ...

1367
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:51,650
comes amongst us not simply to test

1368
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:54,350
the strength and the
courage of the victim,

1369
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:58,104
but to test the strength and
the courage of the rest of us.

1370
01:16:58,104 --> 01:17:00,560
Now, God is with us and with Robbie!

1371
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,540
- [Robbie] Fuck you, mother fucker!

1372
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:04,163
- Robbie's position is
an act of the devil,

1373
01:17:04,163 --> 01:17:06,180
not of God's will.

1374
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:08,623
And if God is with us, who
can prevail against us?

1375
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,307
- Fuck you, burn in hell!

1376
01:17:15,307 --> 01:17:16,933
Fuck everybody!

1377
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:18,064
Fuck!

1378
01:17:18,064 --> 01:17:19,597
Fucking die!

1379
01:17:19,597 --> 01:17:20,977
Fuck you!

1380
01:17:20,977 --> 01:17:23,275
Fuck fucking die you dirty bastards!

1381
01:17:23,275 --> 01:17:25,184
Fuck you, fuck everyone!

1382
01:17:25,184 --> 01:17:26,890
Fuck fucking God!

1383
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:29,140
(shouting)

1384
01:17:46,207 --> 01:17:48,120
I won't eat that fucking carrion.

1385
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,486
- Whoa there, cowboy.

1386
01:17:50,486 --> 01:17:52,486
- Get your hands off me!

1387
01:17:55,068 --> 01:17:57,526
You're all dirty assholes!

1388
01:17:57,526 --> 01:17:59,589
(groaning)

1389
01:17:59,589 --> 01:18:00,635
(speaking Latin)

1390
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:01,468
Bastards!

1391
01:18:02,523 --> 01:18:07,103
- This is the body of Christ,
given for you and for all men.

1392
01:18:10,104 --> 01:18:11,638
Robbie!

1393
01:18:11,638 --> 01:18:14,111
That sins may be forgiven.

1394
01:18:14,111 --> 01:18:14,944
- Amen.

1395
01:18:19,606 --> 01:18:22,523
(mysterious music)

1396
01:18:32,502 --> 01:18:33,502
Father Bill?

1397
01:18:41,193 --> 01:18:43,300
There's your body of Christ.

1398
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,217
You eat it.

1399
01:18:54,143 --> 01:18:56,726
(blowing nose)

1400
01:18:59,863 --> 01:19:01,701
(shouting in a foreign language)

1401
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:05,140
- Thou hast told me they time of changing.

1402
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:09,310
Now you will tell my thy hidden name.

1403
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,460
- Name?

1404
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,000
Name?

1405
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,003
There is no single name.

1406
01:19:15,128 --> 01:19:16,420
In truth,

1407
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,243
my name is legion,

1408
01:19:19,886 --> 01:19:21,219
for we are many.

1409
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:23,928
- You have the names, Bill.

1410
01:19:23,928 --> 01:19:25,730
Ask it its other name.

1411
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:27,837
- I am ...

1412
01:19:27,837 --> 01:19:29,593
the devil!

1413
01:19:29,593 --> 01:19:32,343
(dramatic music)

1414
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:41,990
(groaning)

1415
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,400
- Hey, Fathers, here we are again.

1416
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,880
Let's freshen up the out.

1417
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,520
Who do we have here in hell?

1418
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,900
It's one of your teammates, padres.

1419
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:03,010
Father Dorgamada, come
on up here, take a bow.

1420
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:04,510
Come on, please, don't be shy.

1421
01:20:05,672 --> 01:20:08,470
There's priests who have supped

1422
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,030
with sinners, publicans, and Moors.

1423
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:14,920
We condemn you, traitor, to
the holy motherfucker church!

1424
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,950
Our next guest on the really big stage

1425
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:19,520
here in hell needs no introduction.

1426
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,674
Take a bow.

1427
01:20:21,674 --> 01:20:24,757
(shouting in German)

1428
01:20:38,153 --> 01:20:39,922
(mimicking explosion)
(explosion)

1429
01:20:39,922 --> 01:20:44,922
(mimicking gunfire)
(gunfire)

1430
01:20:58,373 --> 01:20:59,379
- [Soldier] Padre.

1431
01:20:59,379 --> 01:21:02,017
Padre, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1432
01:21:02,017 --> 01:21:03,473
You gotta give me last rights.

1433
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:18,280
- Stay with Robbie.

1434
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,743
- (stuttering) That's all folks.

1435
01:21:30,847 --> 01:21:31,950
- [Phyllis] Father?

1436
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:32,913
- It's all right, it's
all right, it's okay.

1437
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:36,260
(vomiting)

1438
01:21:41,012 --> 01:21:43,429
(whimpering)

1439
01:21:47,364 --> 01:21:49,023
- Oh, kid.

1440
01:21:49,023 --> 01:21:51,200
That kid knew I was in the war.

1441
01:21:52,817 --> 01:21:54,870
The kid knows, it knows.

1442
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:55,703
Kid knew.

1443
01:21:57,639 --> 01:21:59,939
That damn poker face
gave it away, that's all.

1444
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,117
That's all.

1445
01:22:17,793 --> 01:22:18,626
(knocking)

1446
01:22:18,626 --> 01:22:19,459
- Hey, um ...

1447
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:22,085
I think that's my suitcase.

1448
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,490
You borrowed it from me when you went

1449
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:26,190
to the Browns away game, remember?

1450
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:29,383
No, here, let me.

1451
01:22:29,383 --> 01:22:30,700
It sticks.

1452
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,270
You gotta wiggle a little doohickey.

1453
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:34,520
- So where are you going?

1454
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:40,060
- The archbishop wants me
to go to Rome with him, so.

1455
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:40,893
- Rome.

1456
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:44,479
- Where are you going?

1457
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:46,940
- We're moving the boy out of the house.

1458
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:48,160
- Really?

1459
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:50,540
- Yeah, Roman ritual, page 64.

1460
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:51,373
If it can be done conveniently,

1461
01:22:51,373 --> 01:22:53,710
the possessed person
should be led to church

1462
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:58,460
or to some sacred and worthy
place away from the crowd.

1463
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,003
Midnight tomorrow, remember.

1464
01:23:02,443 --> 01:23:03,810
Jesus.

1465
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:04,643
- Probably a good idea.

1466
01:23:04,643 --> 01:23:06,010
Just make sure that it's ...

1467
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:10,260
Private and secure with
people who will understand.

1468
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,093
- It is.

1469
01:23:12,902 --> 01:23:13,973
The Alexian Brothers.

1470
01:23:15,743 --> 01:23:16,576
- I thought you said you'd die

1471
01:23:16,576 --> 01:23:17,840
before you set foot in that place.

1472
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,543
- What about the boy's soul, Ray?

1473
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,420
- Listen, Bill, if...

1474
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:24,420
- No farewells, Ray.

1475
01:23:28,839 --> 01:23:29,672
- Right.

1476
01:23:33,577 --> 01:23:35,520
- Did you ever hear this one?

1477
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,740
St. Ignatius of Loyola
had laid down the sword

1478
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,530
and taken up the cross,
and he was traveling

1479
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:42,130
in the Holy Land one day
when he encountered a Moor.

1480
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,543
And pretty soon they got
striking up a conversation.

1481
01:23:49,048 --> 01:23:50,290
And be damned if they didn't turn out

1482
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:54,700
to be convivial travelling companions.

1483
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,550
But of course, they did fall
into a theological argument,

1484
01:23:58,850 --> 01:24:01,046
and before Saint Ignatius could
gather a convincing argument

1485
01:24:01,046 --> 01:24:03,700
in support of Jesus Christ our Lord,

1486
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:06,700
they came to a fork in the road.

1487
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:10,650
And the Saracen, well,
he tipped his helmet

1488
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:13,133
and was off, gone one way.

1489
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:15,960
Saint Ignatius, he had to go the other way

1490
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,957
to catch the ferry, meet his buddies

1491
01:24:18,957 --> 01:24:21,700
and carry on the work of the Lord.

1492
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,773
And he suddenly thinks to
himself, "Well, which is the way?

1493
01:24:26,678 --> 01:24:28,727
"And I know if I had five more
minutes with that unbeliever,

1494
01:24:28,727 --> 01:24:30,250
"I could bring him to Lord Jesus Christ."

1495
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,607
Get the door, would you?

1496
01:24:32,607 --> 01:24:35,563
"Which way am I supposed to go?

1497
01:24:37,477 --> 01:24:39,653
"Which way am I supposed to go?

1498
01:24:42,267 --> 01:24:43,513
"Save one soul?

1499
01:24:45,317 --> 01:24:46,423
"Or lead a hundred?

1500
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,423
How flummoxed, he suddenly has an idea.

1501
01:24:52,722 --> 01:24:53,772
And he says, "I know.

1502
01:24:56,147 --> 01:24:58,067
"I'll take whichever path this donkey

1503
01:24:58,067 --> 01:25:01,030
"I'm riding decides to choose."

1504
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:02,470
I know the story, Bill.

1505
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:04,613
- Yeah, but you don't
know the punchline, Ray.

1506
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,563
Ever since then, so many
jackasses have made our decisions.

1507
01:25:28,687 --> 01:25:29,520
- [Phyllis] This?

1508
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,630
This is where you want to put our son?

1509
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,130
- It's not to imprison him, Phyllis.

1510
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:34,370
It's to free him.

1511
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:35,203
Robbie, come.

1512
01:25:41,772 --> 01:25:45,189
(emotional choral music)

1513
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:57,930
- We are here for you,
father, for all of you.

1514
01:25:57,930 --> 01:25:59,080
- God bless you.

1515
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,930
I'll need your help and your prayers.

1516
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:03,590
Karl, Phyllis, I think it would be better

1517
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:06,963
if you stayed here with these brothers.

1518
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,033
Robbie.

1519
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:25,450
The people here are closer to
God than almost anyone I know.

1520
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:27,073
I trust them with my life.

1521
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:33,140
We'll begin in a moment.

1522
01:26:41,718 --> 01:26:44,026
First I need to pray.

1523
01:26:44,026 --> 01:26:46,609
(uneasy music)

1524
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:50,710
- Say a day to adjust to the time zone.

1525
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:53,090
Arrange a breakfast
with American delegates.

1526
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:55,450
I've already discussed this
with Cardinal Spellman.

1527
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:57,300
Of course, we'll need to sit

1528
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,920
with the European hierarchy as well.

1529
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,960
Make sure you vet the list,
especially the French.

1530
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,070
They're overrun with socialists.

1531
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:05,990
Last thing I need is to have my picture

1532
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:08,383
beside some fellow traveler.

1533
01:27:10,816 --> 01:27:12,601
Are you getting all this?

1534
01:27:12,601 --> 01:27:14,749
- Oh yes, mm-hm.

1535
01:27:14,749 --> 01:27:17,499
(dramatic music)

1536
01:27:37,655 --> 01:27:40,072
(thundering)

1537
01:28:09,028 --> 01:28:11,278
- We'll just about make it.

1538
01:28:14,627 --> 01:28:16,200
Hello.

1539
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,033
- Stop.

1540
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,083
Think.

1541
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:22,130
- That's a cheery thought.

1542
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:22,963
- Time's up.

1543
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:25,890
- [Archbishop] Just what you want to see

1544
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:28,257
before you get on a plane.

1545
01:28:28,257 --> 01:28:30,368
- Are you ready, Father?

1546
01:28:30,368 --> 01:28:32,386
Can you face him for the final tally?

1547
01:28:32,386 --> 01:28:34,700
Are your earthly accounts balanced,

1548
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,453
or are you overdrawn on heaven's books?

1549
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:40,140
- Something wrong?

1550
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,443
I thought I was the only one
who was afraid of flying.

1551
01:28:43,836 --> 01:28:45,336
What's the matter?

1552
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,403
- He's only 11 years old, Lord.

1553
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,760
Just two years younger than I was

1554
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:57,760
when I first heard your call
as clearly a cathedral bell

1555
01:28:58,270 --> 01:28:59,913
and realized my life's ...

1556
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,500
deluded myself, my life's path

1557
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,733
was to follow in your footsteps.

1558
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:13,240
And you were with me Lord,
every hour of every day

1559
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:17,053
of every night, through high
school, through college.

1560
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:21,963
Until ...

1561
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,200
And that evil ...

1562
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,093
that broke me then ...

1563
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,053
is back in my life waiting to crush me.

1564
01:29:38,913 --> 01:29:40,413
And another child.

1565
01:29:42,302 --> 01:29:45,280
A child on the battlefield
cried out for me too.

1566
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:48,833
Dying.

1567
01:29:50,296 --> 01:29:51,610
He cried out for me.

1568
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,860
And what did I do?

1569
01:29:57,193 --> 01:29:58,026
I cringed.

1570
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,093
I cowered.

1571
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,303
I hid.

1572
01:30:04,884 --> 01:30:05,717
God.

1573
01:30:07,261 --> 01:30:11,483
Don't let me fail another child.

1574
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:16,304
I'm sinking, Lord, I'm sinking
fast on a slough of doubt.

1575
01:30:16,304 --> 01:30:17,887
Where are you, God?

1576
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,470
Is this child's soul
possessed or disturbed?

1577
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:24,477
Am I being taunted from hell or not?

1578
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,087
Help me.

1579
01:30:27,949 --> 01:30:29,453
Give me a sign.

1580
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:32,603
- [Fr. McBride] Bill?

1581
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,433
- Ray.

1582
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,700
What's the matter, you
forget your passport?

1583
01:30:51,385 --> 01:30:53,660
- Something like that.

1584
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:55,510
Look, Bill, I don't know
what you've learned,

1585
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:56,453
what you've lived.

1586
01:30:58,295 --> 01:30:59,267
You never talk to me about it,

1587
01:30:59,267 --> 01:31:01,163
you never let me open that door.

1588
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,630
But there's one thing I
think you've forgotten.

1589
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:07,270
He ...

1590
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:09,883
was a man too, flesh and blood,

1591
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:13,723
muscle and bone, hopes and fears, Bill.

1592
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:18,163
Isn't that the whole point?

1593
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:22,830
Sometimes some of us try

1594
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,220
to be something even he wasn't.

1595
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:27,320
- I'm frightened, Ray.

1596
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:29,213
Bill,

1597
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:31,853
when they broke him,

1598
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,763
when they tortured him,

1599
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:37,860
come on, what did he say?

1600
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:42,543
- God, why have you forsaken me?

1601
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,680
- He was frightened.

1602
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:52,935
But he came back.

1603
01:31:52,935 --> 01:31:54,602
- And you came back.

1604
01:31:57,670 --> 01:31:58,653
You came back, Ray.

1605
01:32:00,926 --> 01:32:02,410
- I just took a taxi.

1606
01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:09,297
(thundering)

1607
01:32:09,297 --> 01:32:12,047
(dramatic music)

1608
01:32:33,991 --> 01:32:36,741
(speaking Latin)

1609
01:33:14,673 --> 01:33:16,473
- Will it hurt as much as last time?

1610
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:19,628
- I don't know, Robbie.

1611
01:33:19,628 --> 01:33:21,278
It isn't God that makes the pain.

1612
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:25,130
We're here to ask him to take it from you.

1613
01:33:27,664 --> 01:33:30,613
- I don't know how much
more I can take of this.

1614
01:33:30,613 --> 01:33:32,613
What if it doesn't stop?

1615
01:33:33,463 --> 01:33:35,372
I don't want to be crazy.

1616
01:33:35,372 --> 01:33:37,333
I'd rather be dead.

1617
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:41,870
- You're not crazy, and you
will get your life back.

1618
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:45,207
As God is my witness, I'll drive it out.

1619
01:33:57,883 --> 01:34:00,466
(moving music)

1620
01:34:14,201 --> 01:34:16,951
(speaking Latin)

1621
01:34:27,807 --> 01:34:28,990
(snarling)

1622
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:31,693
- So what, you think I'm gonna go?

1623
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,901
Stick it up your ass you motherfuckers!

1624
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:35,850
Fuck you!

1625
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:36,683
- Brothers!

1626
01:34:36,683 --> 01:34:37,843
- You'll never get rid of me!

1627
01:34:37,843 --> 01:34:38,676
Never!

1628
01:34:43,424 --> 01:34:45,592
(vomiting)

1629
01:34:45,592 --> 01:34:46,909
Five against one, huh?

1630
01:34:46,909 --> 01:34:48,326
Five against one!

1631
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:51,404
Holy rollers, more like...

1632
01:34:51,404 --> 01:34:52,723
- No, he's my son!

1633
01:34:52,723 --> 01:34:55,661
- They know what they're doing.

1634
01:34:55,661 --> 01:34:58,214
- Oh God of heaven, oh God of Earth,

1635
01:34:58,214 --> 01:35:01,849
God of the angels and
God of the archangels.

1636
01:35:01,849 --> 01:35:04,917
(growling)

1637
01:35:04,917 --> 01:35:09,334
God of martyrs, God of
confessors and God of virgins.

1638
01:35:11,245 --> 01:35:12,977
- [Patient] I told you!

1639
01:35:12,977 --> 01:35:14,428
He's here!

1640
01:35:14,428 --> 01:35:16,261
I told you, he's here!

1641
01:35:18,306 --> 01:35:19,639
- I abjure thee!

1642
01:35:21,824 --> 01:35:23,720
By the judge of the living and the dead,

1643
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:27,069
by thine own creator, by
the creator of the world,

1644
01:35:27,069 --> 01:35:30,236
be gone from this servant of the Lord!

1645
01:35:31,718 --> 01:35:33,968
(groaning)

1646
01:35:40,686 --> 01:35:41,519
All right.

1647
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:43,773
- Let's let him rest.

1648
01:35:45,630 --> 01:35:46,910
- [Bowdern] Wake him up.

1649
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:48,711
- Bill, for God's sake.

1650
01:35:48,711 --> 01:35:49,990
- Yes!

1651
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:51,900
For God's sake.

1652
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:53,300
It isn't over.

1653
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:56,470
It's 10 minutes of midnight,
the time of changing.

1654
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:58,173
This demon wants a struggle.

1655
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:00,643
He's gonna get it.

1656
01:36:01,514 --> 01:36:02,347
Wake up!

1657
01:36:02,347 --> 01:36:03,782
(growling)

1658
01:36:03,782 --> 01:36:06,032
(shouting)

1659
01:36:10,994 --> 01:36:13,994
(soft choral music)

1660
01:36:16,513 --> 01:36:20,770
- No, Father Bowdern,
please, please, no more.

1661
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:23,780
It hurts so bad, I just
can't take it anymore.

1662
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:25,020
- Satan's supposed to be a general.

1663
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:26,120
What are you?

1664
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:27,720
A chicken lieutenant or private?

1665
01:36:29,115 --> 01:36:29,948
Now come on!

1666
01:36:29,948 --> 01:36:30,781
Show yourself!

1667
01:36:30,781 --> 01:36:31,614
Show me you're real.

1668
01:36:34,364 --> 01:36:36,590
- I'm as real as cancer!

1669
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:37,580
Fuck you!

1670
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:40,643
- Say something Robbie
hasn't heard in a schoolyard!

1671
01:36:42,655 --> 01:36:44,055
Is that the best you've got?

1672
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:47,830
Devil in a canned ham has
more cajones than that.

1673
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:49,093
Come on, Robbie.

1674
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:54,033
Robbie, don't let this chump beat you.

1675
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:01,603
Robbie, if you can hear
me, do you know its name?

1676
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,493
It's secret identity.

1677
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:09,680
Come on, it's name.

1678
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:10,513
- Father Bill.

1679
01:37:12,392 --> 01:37:13,225
His name is ...

1680
01:37:15,265 --> 01:37:16,932
His name is Dominus.

1681
01:37:17,788 --> 01:37:19,371
My name is Dominus.

1682
01:37:22,788 --> 01:37:24,955
(yelling)

1683
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:37,020
(dramatic music)

1684
01:37:43,777 --> 01:37:45,080
- Dominus.

1685
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,477
- Then this is it.

1686
01:37:46,477 --> 01:37:47,877
- I hope to God we're ready.

1687
01:37:49,748 --> 01:37:52,630
(thundering)

1688
01:37:52,630 --> 01:37:53,563
Parlor tricks.

1689
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,793
You use a boy to scare men.

1690
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:01,210
- [Robbie] Oh, you wanna play, eh?

1691
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:02,763
Okay, let's play.

1692
01:38:04,266 --> 01:38:06,516
(groaning)

1693
01:38:16,453 --> 01:38:17,980
- Sacrilege!

1694
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:18,813
Ooh.

1695
01:38:20,664 --> 01:38:21,957
We're so scared.

1696
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:28,390
(speaking pig Latin)
(laughing)

1697
01:38:30,019 --> 01:38:30,936
This is it?

1698
01:38:32,513 --> 01:38:33,533
This is evil?

1699
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,720
I'm tired of this game.

1700
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,950
I've seen hell front row center, Dominus.

1701
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:42,720
And compared to that, you're a lawn chair.

1702
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,929
Now you want a piece of me?

1703
01:38:44,929 --> 01:38:46,429
Let's go, come on!

1704
01:39:01,868 --> 01:39:04,368
("Ave Maria")

1705
01:39:42,821 --> 01:39:43,654
- Bill.

1706
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:45,433
What's wrong?

1707
01:39:46,853 --> 01:39:47,686
- No!

1708
01:39:48,919 --> 01:39:52,142
- Padre, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1709
01:39:52,142 --> 01:39:52,975
- How?

1710
01:39:54,852 --> 01:39:56,953
I never told anyone that.

1711
01:39:56,953 --> 01:39:59,975
I never told anyone, not even the shrink.

1712
01:39:59,975 --> 01:40:01,892
Not even in confession.

1713
01:40:02,972 --> 01:40:04,416
Never.

1714
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:05,645
Never.

1715
01:40:05,645 --> 01:40:06,600
- You stay in this room.

1716
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,363
Bill, come on, you stay with us!

1717
01:40:10,410 --> 01:40:12,430
Don't let him win, not now.

1718
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:16,917
(laughing)

1719
01:40:22,913 --> 01:40:24,163
Son of a bitch.

1720
01:40:27,758 --> 01:40:29,008
Mother fucker's for real.

1721
01:40:34,316 --> 01:40:36,983
Fasten your seatbelt, Beelzebub.

1722
01:40:40,347 --> 01:40:42,303
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

1723
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:45,977
Don't touch him!

1724
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:49,593
Oh God.

1725
01:40:50,936 --> 01:40:53,727
(gunshot)

1726
01:40:53,727 --> 01:40:56,330
Who has the power to
restore life after death

1727
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:59,940
and rest after toil, for this
is no other God beside thee,

1728
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:02,760
nor ever could there be a
true God apart from thee,

1729
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:06,200
the creator of all things
visible and invisible,

1730
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:09,223
of whose kingdom they shall be called.

1731
01:41:10,382 --> 01:41:12,700
No.

1732
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:13,533
No.

1733
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,770
(groaning)

1734
01:41:18,574 --> 01:41:21,204
- Hence, we humbly appeal.

1735
01:41:21,204 --> 01:41:22,675
Bill!

1736
01:41:22,675 --> 01:41:24,536
Hence, we humbly appeal.

1737
01:41:24,536 --> 01:41:26,837
- Hence, we humbly appeal
to the sublime majesty

1738
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:32,050
that thou wouldst graciously vouchsafe

1739
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:36,260
to deliver us by thy might

1740
01:41:37,662 --> 01:41:40,450
from every power of the accursed spirits

1741
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:41,903
from their bondage,

1742
01:41:43,896 --> 01:41:45,896
and from their deception

1743
01:41:48,828 --> 01:41:51,578
and to preserve us from all harm.

1744
01:42:01,183 --> 01:42:04,183
(shouting in Latin)

1745
01:42:08,348 --> 01:42:09,868
I cast thee out.

1746
01:42:09,868 --> 01:42:12,155
(speaking in Latin)

1747
01:42:12,155 --> 01:42:15,590
Thy name is Dominus, and I command thee,

1748
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:18,260
in the name of the Father,

1749
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:19,863
in the name of the Son,

1750
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:24,370
in the name of the Holy Ghost,

1751
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:27,446
I cast thee out!

1752
01:42:27,446 --> 01:42:29,613
(roaring)

1753
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:33,612
(bell tolling)

1754
01:42:33,612 --> 01:42:36,362
Now is the time of they changing.

1755
01:42:37,496 --> 01:42:40,246
Give me a sign of your departure.

1756
01:42:43,309 --> 01:42:46,226
(glass shattering)

1757
01:42:48,277 --> 01:42:50,610
(screaming)

1758
01:42:57,287 --> 01:43:00,666
(shouting in Latin)

1759
01:43:00,666 --> 01:43:02,333
Thy name is Dominus!

1760
01:43:04,613 --> 01:43:06,863
(shouting)

1761
01:43:10,990 --> 01:43:11,990
Thy name ...

1762
01:43:13,274 --> 01:43:14,107
is Robbie.

1763
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:29,643
I command thee, in the name of the Father,

1764
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:31,763
and of the Son,

1765
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:35,543
and of the Holy Ghost,

1766
01:43:36,938 --> 01:43:39,605
depart from this servant of God.

1767
01:43:47,579 --> 01:43:48,412
Depart.

1768
01:43:58,913 --> 01:44:01,163
(shouting)

1769
01:44:31,616 --> 01:44:33,889
- It's gone, Father Bill.

1770
01:44:33,889 --> 01:44:35,624
I felt it go.

1771
01:44:35,624 --> 01:44:37,207
- So did I, Robbie.

1772
01:44:39,367 --> 01:44:40,200
So did I.

1773
01:44:44,966 --> 01:44:47,383
- I had this nightmare again.

1774
01:44:48,595 --> 01:44:50,345
You were angry at me.

1775
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:52,473
- Never at you, Robbie.

1776
01:44:53,328 --> 01:44:54,411
Never at you.

1777
01:45:06,493 --> 01:45:09,910
(emotional choral music)

1778
01:45:20,565 --> 01:45:23,232
(bells tolling)

1779
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:27,970
- We have informed the chancery office

1780
01:45:29,170 --> 01:45:32,720
that the events which
took place in St. Louis

1781
01:45:34,230 --> 01:45:35,980
must not be publicized.

1782
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:42,470
However, I fear that the
news has already broken

1783
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:45,203
in various parts of the city,

1784
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:49,123
through individuals asking for prayer,

1785
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:55,477
and some who may have
taken part in the ...

1786
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:57,583
episode.

1787
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:03,380
The difficulty in keeping
certain facts secret

1788
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:08,290
is at the moment practically
beyond our control.

1789
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:10,720
But in so far as we ar able,

1790
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:13,850
we must not make this case public

1791
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:17,080
until we receive a definite statement

1792
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,053
from the chancery office.

1793
01:46:20,430 --> 01:46:23,063
Of course, there will be no statement.

1794
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:28,120
The room at the Alexian Hospital,

1795
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:32,323
where the reputed event
allegedly took place ...

1796
01:46:35,914 --> 01:46:37,164
will be sealed.

1797
01:46:39,745 --> 01:46:40,578
Forever.

1798
01:46:43,403 --> 01:46:46,736
(soft orchestral music)

1799
01:46:53,436 --> 01:46:56,353
(mysterious music)
