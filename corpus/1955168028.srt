1
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,761
Hold on,
i can't hear you.

2
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:46,498
Okay, that's better.
Where are you guys?

3
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,634
No, I don't--
i don't know where that is.

4
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:52,437
I-- I don't--
i don't have GPS
on this phone.

5
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,840
Well, can
you just give me
directions from here?

6
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,177
Hello?

7
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,414
Shit.

8
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,783
Come on.

9
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,919
You okay?

10
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,787
Yeah. I'm just--

11
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,889
-couldn't help but, uh...
-Yeah. No, no, I'm fine.

12
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,725
I just--
i lost my friends.

13
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,727
And I have
no reception. So...

14
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,829
Where are you headed?

15
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:22,334
-Um, LAN kwai--
-LAN kwai fong.

16
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,769
-Yeah.
-You need directions?

17
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,903
Yeah, that'd be great.
I don't--

18
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,238
I don't have GPS
on my phone.

19
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,940
Yeah, I heard.
So, it's easy.

20
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,576
-You just walk down
these stairs here, okay?
-Okay.

21
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,444
- Take a right on Elgin.
-Okay.

22
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,379
-And you go till
you hit the escalators.
-Escalators.

23
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,281
Yeah, mid-level
escalators.

24
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:39,284
Okay, what building?

25
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,787
No, they're outside.

26
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,722
Oh, like in the middle
of the street?

27
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,825
Yeah.
It's one of Hong Kong's
most famous sights.

28
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,327
The mid-level escalators.

29
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,229
-It's in all
the guidebooks.
-Oh!

30
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,563
-The mid-level escalators.
-Yeah, okay.

31
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,265
Okay? So you go up
two blocks,

32
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,933
you take a right
on Hollywood.

33
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,969
You know,
i think I'm just gonna--
I'll just ask someone

34
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,404
when I get off the escalators.

35
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,306
-Are you sure?
-Thanks. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

36
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,475
I mean, I...

37
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:04,776
I can--
i can walk you there.

38
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,880
Mm, no.

39
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,515
-Thanks, though.
-Yeah.

40
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,917
-Yeah.
-Okay.

41
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,518
Just down
to the right.

42
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,612
-You lost already?
-Yeah, you know, it's--

43
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,515
it's--
it's just pretty
confusing down there.

44
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,319
Well, my offer
still stands.

45
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,694
Are you sure
I'm not taking you away
from anything?

46
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:56,895
-I don't wanna--
-it's fine.

47
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,997
It's a big
birthday party,

48
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,899
I doubt anyone will
miss me for five minutes.

49
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,935
So let me
just text somebody.

50
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,741
Okay.
Good to go.

51
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,310
I really appreciate it,

52
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,744
-thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

53
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:13,812
Don't mention it.

54
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,360
I'm Ruby,
by the way.

55
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,696
-Nice to meet you,
Ruby by the way.
-Hmm.

56
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:33,398
-I'm Josh.
-Hey.

57
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,433
First time
in Hong Kong?

58
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,534
Uh, yes, it is.

59
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,868
I'm guessing
it's not yours.

60
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,937
No, I live here.

61
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,005
Where you from?

62
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,907
-California.
-Ah, cool.

63
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,942
-San Francisco?
-Nope, L.A.

64
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,744
Oh.

65
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,012
And where
are you from?

66
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,514
-New York.
-Oh.

67
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,683
-What?
-Nothing,
it's just so cliche

68
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,452
for new yorkers
to hate on L.A.

69
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,022
So have you ever been?

70
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,890
No, I never
saw the need.

71
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,426
What? You got something
against nice weather?

72
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,729
See there's something
very wrong with your city
when the only good thing

73
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,564
you have going for it
is the weather.

74
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,899
Okay, that's not
the only nice thing.

75
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,901
Yeah, I guess.

76
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,371
- If you like earthquakes.

77
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,743
-So this is soho.
-Just like New York.

78
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,878
-And London.
-Buenos Aires.

79
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,447
Apparently you're not a major
city unless you have a soho.

80
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,882
What does this
soho stand for?

81
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,951
South of Hollywood.

82
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:29,020
I wonder why L.A. hasn't
jumped on that bandwagon--
don't even start.

83
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,593
So what brings
you to Hong Kong?

84
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,461
-Work.
-What do you do?

85
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,865
-I design toys.
-Well that's cool.
What kind?

86
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,402
Have you ever seen
those stuffed animals
that sing and dance?

87
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,936
My niece is obsessed
with this one toy.

88
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,405
It's a-- it's a beaver,
but it's--

89
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,773
-Justin beaver.
-Justin--

90
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,441
-yeah.
-Oh, my-- you?

91
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,442
-I designed that.
-What?

92
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,576
-Yep.
-Really?

93
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,578
-Yeah.
-That's pretty cool.

94
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,047
Thanks.
She's obsessed with one toy
and you designed it.

95
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,849
Apparently.

96
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,084
What else you got?

97
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,486
Um, let's see
i have, uh--

98
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,155
moos like Jagger.
It's a cow.

99
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,123
-Ha!
-Lady ba-ba.

100
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,992
-A sheep?
-A sheep. Mm-hmm.

101
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,560
-Where can i
get one of these?
-Um, I don't know.

102
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,562
If I see you next time
I'll just give you one.

103
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:11,897
Are you planning on
getting lost around here
in the near future?

104
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,865
Well now I know
who to call.

105
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,067
You don't even know
if I'm taking you
to the right place.

106
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,804
Yeah. My mother did
warn me

107
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,473
about talking
to random strangers,

108
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,475
in a foreign city.

109
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,177
Such oddly specific advice.

110
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,179
She's like that.
She's like a fortune cookie.

111
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,057
So these are
the famous mid-level
escalators.

112
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,959
Ready for the ride
of your life?

113
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,461
Let's do it.

114
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,806
Technology strikes again.

115
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,541
What do you mean?

116
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,110
They're on a date
and they're just
on their phones.

117
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,979
Yeah, well maybe
they've been going out
for a long time

118
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,781
and they just ran
out of things to say
to each other.

119
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:06,485
No way. They're
on their third date,
at most.

120
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,587
-How do you know?
-The way they're dressed.

121
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,955
I'm sorry,
what are you talking
about?

122
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,924
What were you saying?

123
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,699
Oh wait,
so I actually
make a left here.

124
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,101
Yeah, we go down here,
and then you we down peel.

125
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,669
-Okay.
-And then...

126
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,705
Right, you know what?
I'm gonna be okay.

127
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,974
I'm gonna--
i don't wanna take up
any more of your time.

128
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:33,078
Yeah, I guess I should--
should get back.

129
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Cool.
Nice to meet you.

130
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,182
Yeah, it was nice
to meet you too.

131
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,617
Thanks very much.

132
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,188
- Bye.
-Bye.

133
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,862
Hey, you know what?

134
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,864
Another 10 minutes
is not gonna hurt.

135
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,533
-Really?
-Yeah, I should make sure
you get there.

136
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,601
What a gentleman.

137
00:08:56,603 --> 00:09:00,071
I just don't want
to be accused of anything
in case you go missing.

138
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,673
Wow, that was really creepy.
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,308
-So creepy.
-Sorry.

140
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,809
I take it too far.

141
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,956
So what do you do here
in Hong Kong?

142
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,925
Nothing as exciting
as designing toys,

143
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,092
that's for sure.

144
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,327
Come on.
What do you do?

145
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,129
I don't wanna bore you.

146
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,797
All right,
I'll guess then.

147
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,065
Uh, you're an expat
in Hong Kong

148
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,867
so I'm thinking...

149
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,335
Trust fund baby?

150
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,003
What? Jesus, no.

151
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,039
All right.
So you're in finance.

152
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,074
I know we're not
the most popular people
in the world right now.

153
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,109
Oh, I feel
so sorry for you.

154
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,146
Trust me, I'd rather be doing
something creative like you.

155
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,814
Like what?

156
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,749
Like writing, actually.

157
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,718
Oh, what did you
study in college?

158
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,919
I was a double major,

159
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,756
i-- i-- studied business
and English lit.

160
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,191
So what happened?

161
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,927
I guess my practical side
won out.

162
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,762
I got my mba.

163
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,998
But now,
whenever anybody asks me
what I do for a living,

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,866
I feel the need
to follow it up with,

165
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,768
but I did study literature
in college.

166
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,203
Yeah. I get that.

167
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,039
It's not like
i went to school
to design toys.

168
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,307
How did you
become a toy designer?

169
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,909
Well, out of design school

170
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,310
I thought I was gonna
be the next Vera wang,

171
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,180
but I quickly realized
that it is much easier

172
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,716
finding a job
designing toys.

173
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,318
-Still want to do
something with fashion?
-Oh yeah, definitely.

174
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,987
You know, but instead
of designing my own label,

175
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,723
I think I'd love to own
my own boutique

176
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,859
and-- and be able to curate
all my own pieces.

177
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,862
-You got pretty good style
what's stopping you?
-Thanks.

178
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,864
Student loans.

179
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,834
Rent. The need to eat
on a regular basis.

180
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,770
Eating is
highly overrated.

181
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,940
Coming from a guy
who probably has caviar
for breakfast.

182
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,708
No, I have cocaine
for breakfast.

183
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,211
-Ahh.
-Caviar is like a--
a late afternoon snack.

184
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,682
So do you still write
on the side?

185
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,919
-I'm working on a novel.
-Oh, you're a novelist.

186
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,254
I think you have
to finish the book

187
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,790
before you call yourself
a novelist, but--

188
00:10:58,792 --> 00:10:59,791
kind of.

189
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,760
What's it called?

190
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,228
Do you really wanna know?

191
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,063
I just keep asking
you questions

192
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,332
because I love
hearing the sound
of my own voice.

193
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,801
You're kind of sassy,
you know that?

194
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,177
So?

195
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,378
It's uh--

196
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,215
it's called,
"living on Hong Kong time."

197
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:27,886
You mean,
living on jet lag time?

198
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,689
I had this boss
when I was living
in New York,

199
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,857
and he said, uh,
"let's hustle people,

200
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,226
it's already tomorrow
in Hong Kong."

201
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,328
And that phrase--
that phrase like
really stuck with me

202
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,031
because it's
so fast paced here,

203
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,001
it really
is already tomorrow.

204
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,303
-Guess what?
-Hmm?

205
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,106
It's still
yesterday in L.A.

206
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,975
That's funny.
It's probably very true too.

207
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,044
I think if you gave it
a solid chance,

208
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,746
you'd really
like it there.

209
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,948
Yeah, I hear
the weather's amazing.

210
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,783
So what's it about?

211
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,853
It's a far-fetched story
about an American expat

212
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,456
living in Hong Kong,
and all his misadventures.

213
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,026
Hmm, I've always been
intrigued with expats.

214
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,494
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

215
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,862
I mean they always gave
the impression

216
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,797
that living abroad
is so glamorous,

217
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,334
but when my grandparents
immigrated to the states
from Hong Kong,

218
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,138
their journey
was anything but glamorous.

219
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,273
And what makes
them immigrants,

220
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,943
and you expats?

221
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,213
Well, I guess expats
are living abroad temporarily,

222
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,282
and an immigrant
is there to stay.

223
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,452
Okay. So how long
have you been in Hong Kong?

224
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,387
-10 years.
-Hmm.

225
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,824
Do you have any plans
to move back to New York
any time soon?

226
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,127
-Nope.
-Okay, so...

227
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,997
A white investment banker
living abroad is an expat,

228
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,866
and a Chinese
restaurant worker

229
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,301
living in arcadia
is an immigrant?

230
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,537
I guess I never really
thought about it that way.

231
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,905
Yeah.

232
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,507
It just kind of ironic,

233
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,343
that my, like,
grandparents worked
so hard

234
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,245
to give us a better life
in the states,

235
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:03,948
and yet here we are.
We're all just flocking
back to Asia.

236
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,151
It's like most
of my friends here.

237
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,886
The far east movement.

238
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,525
This is really pretty.

239
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:18,129
Yeah, so these are like,
the last four remaining
gas lamps in the city.

240
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,231
-Oh, cool.
-Mm-hmm.

241
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,067
This is the first
Starbucks in Hong Kong.

242
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,571
Try that. Ready?
Let's try.

243
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,973
Do you guys want me
to take a photo for you?

244
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,942
Yeah, that'd be so great,
thanks so much.

245
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,977
Yeah, no worries.

246
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,145
Okay.

247
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,281
Cheese.

248
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,983
-There you go.
-Thanks again.

249
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,119
Did you want a photo?

250
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,155
-Um-- no, we just met--
-yeah, let's get a photo!

251
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,558
-Come on.
It'll be fun.
-Sure. Thank you.

252
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,027
Right by the gas lamps.

253
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,829
Thanks.

254
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,231
-Say cheese.
-Cheese.

255
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,467
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

256
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,069
-All right,
have a good night.
-Thank you.

257
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,070
-Bye.
-Bye.

258
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,005
Bye.

259
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,341
It's pretty cute.

260
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,610
Yeah. It's not bad.

261
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,212
-I mean, I look good.
-I was just gonna say,

262
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:08,279
you messed up the shot.

263
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,114
I messed up
the shot?

264
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,351
-See that?
-Yeah.

265
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,019
That's my office
right there.

266
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,288
Oh. You work inside
the bank of China building?

267
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,924
No, no.
This is the h.S.B.C.
Building.

268
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,492
That right there,
that's the bank of China
building.

269
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,562
-Oh.
-Please let me buy
you a guidebook.

270
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:04,035
It almost makes it worth
being a banker.

271
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,137
All those lights on
in the offices,

272
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,206
it's 11:00
on a Friday night.

273
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,674
Those are all
people working.

274
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,976
It's not as glamorous
as it looks.

275
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,645
Guess not.

276
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,449
So how long have you
been in finance for?

277
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,685
Basically the entire time
that I've lived here.

278
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,987
-That's a long time.
-Uh, yeah.

279
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,391
Do you not like it
very much?

280
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:27,992
Well, it's all fun and games
until someone

281
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,694
triggers
a global recession.

282
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,099
Oh, look at that.

283
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,268
They're so cute.

284
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,072
- Should we photobomb?
- -Yeah, let's do it.

285
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,409
Cheese!

286
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,095
Not to be confused
with dragon's back,
which is a hike.

287
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,164
-Okay.
-I should write
a tour guide book.

288
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,733
Yeah, you should.
You're very knowledgeable.

289
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,569
And this is LAN kwai fong,
right across the street.

290
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,972
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

291
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,607
I'm really surprised
you got me here
in one piece

292
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,977
-oh, you're surprised?
-Yeah.

293
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,548
Oh, god.
I'm sorry, I'm not--

294
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,682
it's all right.

295
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,184
Whoo.
I'm not used to people

296
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,452
driving on the wrong
side of the road.

297
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,253
Well, here it's
the right side.
Come on.

298
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,492
-Wow, you saved me.
-I saved your life.

299
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,363
-Thank you.
-Yeah. You owe me.

300
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,125
-This is crazy.
-Yeah it's pretty much
like this every night.

301
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,793
So, which bar
are your friends at?

302
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,661
Uh, club 97.

303
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,296
-Really?
-Yeah.

304
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,364
Oh god. That's like,
that's right around here.

305
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,066
Oh, god.

306
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:18,202
Yeah.
Now I remember
why I never come here.

307
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,371
A little insane,
i know.

308
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,740
And, um,
all right,
you see that--

309
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,476
that neon sign,
the purple neon sign?

310
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,246
-That's--
-hey, Josh?

311
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,450
I had a really great time
getting lost with you
tonight.

312
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,352
Yeah, me too.

313
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,753
And, you know, like,

314
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,056
I'm gonna see my friends
in the morning

315
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,691
and I was thinking
maybe we could just
grab a drink

316
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,527
together instead.

317
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,430
-Oh, um--
-or, not.

318
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,633
If you have to go,

319
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,101
I mean...

320
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,569
No, yeah.

321
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,205
I'd love to grab a drink.

322
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,406
Awesome.

323
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,408
Should we just go to one
of these joints?

324
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,178
No, no, these are
cheesy tourist places,
you don't want this.

325
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,446
Okay, so where do you
want to go?

326
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,281
Let's get out
of the depths of hell.

327
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,715
Come on.

328
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,097
Oh wow, this is great.

329
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,231
It works for you, right?

330
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,833
Yes.

331
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,768
Are you sure this isn't
too civilized for you?

332
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,409
Well, if you hate him so much
why don't you just quit?

333
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,478
Okay, what would I do
for money?

334
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,513
Um, write.

335
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,381
It's a hobby,
no one's gonna pay me
to write.

336
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,716
Wow.

337
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,519
How can you fail
with that kind of attitude?

338
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:42,854
Well, I did tell myself

339
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,523
at the eight year mark
i was gonna quit,

340
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,791
but it's hard, you know,
you get accustomed

341
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,426
-to a certain lifestyle
-yeah.

342
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,595
Sex, drugs,
and Gucci suits.

343
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,430
It's actually, sex, drugs,
and number crunching,

344
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,831
-but, it was close--
-okay.

345
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,268
I keep telling myself
every year,

346
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,438
this is--
this is the year
I'm gonna save enough money.

347
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,673
But at the end
of the year,

348
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,209
you get that bonus check,
and then you're sucked
right back in.

349
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,612
Yeah.

350
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:11,282
Those high-class
problems, huh?

351
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,517
You gotta suck it up.

352
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,385
You've gotta stop
being a wuss,

353
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,587
I mean, when are you
one hundred percent ready--

354
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,423
ever ready,
to do anything?

355
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,792
You know,
you've worked so hard
for this safety net.

356
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,327
So, if you want
to take some time off

357
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,197
to write this book,
then you've earned that.

358
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,168
Wow.

359
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,503
You're absolutely right.

360
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,474
I'm always right.

361
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,647
Excuse me.

362
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,448
-I'm gonna use
the ladies room.
-Yeah.

363
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,873
Hey.

364
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,854
I'll see you soon.
Okay.

365
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,823
Bye.

366
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,858
-Hey.
-Hey.

367
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,562
Ready for another round?

368
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,299
I would love to,
but actually I need to
get back to the party.

369
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,735
Okay.
I get it.

370
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,470
Your friends
are probably waiting.

371
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:43,274
Yeah,
and my girlfriend's
there too, so.

372
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,812
Your girlfriend?

373
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,248
Yeah, probably should
get back.

374
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,494
Yeah.

375
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,798
Thanks for the drinks.

376
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,003
Wait, Ruby,

377
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,739
Ruby,
hold on.

378
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,741
-Ruby.
-Yeah.

379
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:17,775
You okay?

380
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:18,876
Of course I am.

381
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,678
Why wouldn't I be?

382
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,346
You sure?

383
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,852
Let me
just get this right.

384
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:31,289
You left your girlfriend
at a bar

385
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,057
so you can come
to another bar

386
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,325
with another girl?

387
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:35,526
It was a big
birthday party.

388
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,994
It's not like
i left her alone.

389
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,330
Oh, okay. That totally
makes it okay then.

390
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:40,464
I could have lied to you
right now,

391
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,666
but I didn't.

392
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:42,933
No, you should have just
told me earlier.

393
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,702
What was I supposed
to say?

394
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,637
Oh, sure, I'll walk you
to your friends,

395
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,005
but by the way,
i have a girlfriend?

396
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,808
I didn't ask you
if you have a boyfriend.

397
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,576
Do you--

398
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,712
-do you have a boyfriend?
-No.

399
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,414
Because if I did,
i wouldn't be here
right now.

400
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,051
I wasn't planning
on this, okay?

401
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:03,821
I don't do this type
of thing ever.

402
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,956
I'm trying to apologize.

403
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,727
If I misled you
in any way, I'm sorry.

404
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,830
It's fine.

405
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,032
I'm leaving tomorrow,

406
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,567
don't even worry
about it.

407
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,839
Well, I mean,

408
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,442
should we exchange
contact information now?

409
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,344
Or how does this--
what do we do?

410
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,046
-I don't know--
how does this work?
-Really?

411
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,782
God, I feel really bad
for your girlfriend.

412
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,418
Don't. Okay?
This was such innocent stuff

413
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,853
compared to what she was doing
back at the bar.

414
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,655
She was flirting
with a bunch of aussies,

415
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:40,124
taking shots,
completely embarrassing me.

416
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,629
Whose birthday was it?

417
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,670
-Oh.
-Yeah.

418
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,373
This night
just gets better,
and better.

419
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,576
-That sounds worse
than it really is.
-Wow.

420
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,514
You know,
i have to say,

421
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,783
thank you for a really
interesting night.

422
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,086
Ruby?

423
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,757
- Josh.

424
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,225
-Hey.
-I-- i-- wow.

425
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,829
I can't believe
that it's you.

426
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:34,198
How are--

427
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,699
-how are you?
-How--

428
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,834
-how are you?
-I'm good.

429
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,636
-Good, good.
-Yeah.

430
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,571
-Good.
-What are you doing here?

431
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:43,541
I, um--
I'm just picking up
some clothes in kowloon.

432
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,776
No, I mean,
what are you doing
in Hong Kong?

433
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:49,847
Oh. I--
i actually live here now.

434
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,850
- Really?
- -Yeah.

435
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:55,052
-Wow.
-Yeah, I got a promotion.

436
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,688
-Well, congrats.
-Thank you.

437
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,189
Yeah, the tradeoff was i--
i had to come live here

438
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:02,326
for a year, so,
here I am.

439
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:03,928
I can't believe you--

440
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,063
wait, you live here,
in Hong Kong?

441
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,932
I'm sorry, should I have
notified you first?

442
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:10,100
Yeah, I thought that next time
we were gonna see each other,

443
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,969
you were gonna give me
a lady ba-ba.

444
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,871
Oh, god,
i really hope you weren't
holding your breath

445
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:15,072
since last year.

446
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,078
You know,
i should apologize
about last year.

447
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,780
About that--

448
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,281
oh, don't even--
don't even worry about it.

449
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,750
It was-- it's fine.
It's not a big deal.

450
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,819
No, I was--
i was kind of a jerk.

451
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,087
Yes, you were.

452
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,822
A big jerk.

453
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,759
All right,
all right.

454
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,329
God, I have to know,
how mad was your girlfriend

455
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,632
when you finally
showed up to that bar?

456
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,367
Yeah, well,
she wasn't happy,
that's for sure.

457
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,702
Yeah, I bet.

458
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,305
Did you guys
work things out?

459
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,641
Are you asking
if we're still together?

460
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,209
Nah, why don't we just hang out
for a couple hours,

461
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,678
and then you can just
surprise me later.

462
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
-It's more dramatic that way.
-Yeah, fair enough.

463
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,349
I deserve that.
I deserve that.

464
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,217
Yes. Yes,
we're still together.

465
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,920
Oh, good for you.
Good for you.

466
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,630
So, how about you?
Are you seeing anyone?

467
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,633
Yeah, I am.
I am.

468
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,668
What?

469
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,236
You let me ride the ferry
with you this whole time

470
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,071
you didn't mention,
not once,

471
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,674
-that you had a boyfriend.
-Yeah, I guess we're even now.

472
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,278
-Did you meet him here, or--
-no, no. Back in L.A.

473
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,014
-Oh.
-Yeah, he's in L.A.

474
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,016
-So it's long distance, then?
-Yeah, it is.

475
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,018
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm only doing this for a year.

476
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,887
So, I figured
if we can weather this,

477
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,323
we can weather anything.

478
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,359
I'm sorry,
i can't believe--

479
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,861
I never ride the ferry,

480
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:45,229
-this is crazy.
-Yeah, this is weird.

481
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:47,231
-It's weird, right?
-It's weird. I--

482
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:50,134
it's weird.
I never go to cat lune.

483
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,378
So, it was really good
running into you.

484
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,380
-Yeah.
-I'm like,

485
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:07,418
-i was really glad
we got to catch up
-uh-huh. Definitely.

486
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,954
So-, hah,
where are you off to now?

487
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,824
-I'm picking up clothes.
-Oh, right. Right.

488
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,359
-Where?
-Chungking mansion.

489
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:19,063
You need
me to come with you?

490
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,931
No, I think
i can handle it.

491
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,233
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, yep, I've got a GPS now.

492
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,704
-No, I mean--
that's a sketchy area.
-Really?

493
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:29,339
Look, I think your boyfriend
would want me to go with you.

494
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,708
Uh-huh.

495
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,142
I'd be doing him a solid.

496
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,112
Minding the perimeter,
and shit.

497
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,484
Okay.
Whatever.

498
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,052
If you must.

499
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,956
-It's this way.
-Yeah, that's---

500
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,025
I just thought I'd dropped
something back there.

501
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,359
Yeah-- no. Totally.

502
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,212
Oh, did you see that guy?

503
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,981
-Huh?
-That guy--

504
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:45,816
that bleeding guy.

505
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,184
What are you talking about?

506
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,052
Are you sure
we're in the right place,

507
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,521
'cause most of these tailor
shops are on the ground floor.

508
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:51,922
Yeah, we're right here.

509
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,297
Um-- sorry...

510
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,800
I-- I'm here
to pick up a suit.

511
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,172
You really didn't see
that guy?

512
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,110
Okay.

513
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,827
So, who's the suit for?

514
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,264
Are we picking up a suit
for your boyfriend?

515
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,966
-You said you wanted to come.
-What's his name?

516
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,968
-Suit not ready.
-Wait, what?

517
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,003
-Suit not ready.
-No, no, no, no, I called
this morning,

518
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,005
and you said it'd
be done today.

519
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,273
Sorry, suit not ready.

520
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,308
Next week, come back.

521
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,195
Okay.

522
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,530
Your suit will be ready
this weekend,

523
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,032
and you're getting
a 15% discount.

524
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,200
What?

525
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,937
Thank you.

526
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,908
- What was that?
- -What?

527
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,543
That was amazing.

528
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,578
I didn't know you could speak
cantonese so well.

529
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,314
Hey, I told you
that'd come in handy.

530
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,650
It's so weird watching
you speak Chinese.

531
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,518
It's weird watching
you speak English.

532
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,888
-Whatever, that's different.
-How is it different?

533
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,356
It's different because
i grew up in the states.

534
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:35,259
Well, I spent the last
ten years of my life here.

535
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:36,894
It's still weird.

536
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,528
No, only because
i don't speak any Chinese.

537
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,064
Yeah, well, if it makes
you feel any better,

538
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,200
I don't speak a lick
of yiddish.

539
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:45,035
My grandmother thinks
that's mashugana.

540
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,937
What does that mean?

541
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:48,672
I have no idea.

542
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,543
Okay.

543
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,613
Okay. Well,
i should probably get going.

544
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,082
-But, thank you.
-Yeah, all right.

545
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,352
Hey, I um...

546
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,187
I got-- I gotta be at
this thing in a few hours,

547
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,422
but I've got
some time to kill.

548
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,291
-If--
-oh, no...

549
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,226
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

550
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:12,462
Um, yeah.
It started to sound
eerily familiar.

551
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,431
One drink.

552
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,935
Totally platonic.

553
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,575
Okay.
Fine, fine.

554
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,044
But only because...

555
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:30,080
You got my boyfriend
a discount.

556
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,382
-That's all it takes?
-My boyfriend...

557
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,985
Yeah.

558
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,086
A really good discount.

559
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,700
I mean,
look at this here.

560
00:32:49,702 --> 00:32:52,402
- Is this where
you take all the ladies?

561
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,571
When I'm not haggling
for their boyfriend's menswear,

562
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,273
yes. Yes.
This is--

563
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:58,041
this is where
i take the ladies.

564
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,376
Oh, it's super swanky.

565
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,244
-Don't worry,
I'll pay for it
-oh.

566
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,714
-Using the good, old
expense account?
-I wish.

567
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:05,482
You know,
technically it's okay,

568
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,551
because I am now officially
a customer of h.S.B.C.

569
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:09,086
So you can totally
write it off.

570
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,054
Well, I don't have
an expense account.

571
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,024
-I quit my job.
-What?

572
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:17,527
-Yeah.
-When?

573
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:21,164
Right after I met
this sassy girl from L.A.

574
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,233
No, you actually
took me seriously?

575
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,701
I'm a pauper now
because of you.

576
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:28,038
And you're making
me feel bad?

577
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,139
-You want a drink?
-Yeah.

578
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,440
-Hi.
-What can I get for you?

579
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,476
Um, I'll take a glass
of rose, please.

580
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,211
Yeah, a vodka redbull.

581
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,246
-Um, can I have
a credit card?
-Oh, yeah.

582
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,248
Oh, no, here, I'll get it.
No, seriously.

583
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,583
-No, no, no, no.
-No, it's my treat.

584
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:41,785
-Please.
-No, you got it last time.

585
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,589
I mean, that's a first.

586
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,457
A girl buying me a drink
in Hong Kong.

587
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,761
So you don't have an office
anymore, that's weird.

588
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,195
-No, I don't have an office.
-Uh-huh.

589
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,430
Don't have a secretary,

590
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,232
I just work at home.

591
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,167
-Cheers to that.
-Cheers to this.

592
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,403
Even though
i only said one drink.

593
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,775
But, I'm just
trying my best to--

594
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:07,444
-to treat it
like a day job, you know?
-What do you mean?

595
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,646
Like I clock in
at the same time every day.

596
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,214
You know,
i put the hours in.

597
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,582
Good.

598
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,619
And do you ever get
writers block?

599
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:17,454
I read somewhere
that if you're blocked,

600
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:18,822
that just means
you're writing about
the wrong things.

601
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:20,457
Okay.
It looks like

602
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,626
someone's been googling
quotes about writers block

603
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:24,161
instead of actually writing.

604
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,330
Busted.

605
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:29,433
I mean, who knows
what will happen.

606
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:30,767
How many unpublished books
are out there

607
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:33,737
-just waiting to be ignored.
-Don't do that.

608
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,305
-Don't do that.
-What?

609
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:36,606
You should be proud
of yourself.

610
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,708
You took a chance,
and you went for it.

611
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,343
You know?
You're never gonna
have to look back

612
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:42,179
and wonder "what if."

613
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,615
Thanks.

614
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,522
You know, I always knew
we'd be great friends someday.

615
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,291
Don't get too ahead
of yourself.

616
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:56,226
Let's see how the rest
of the night pans out first.

617
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,829
No way.
I'm not taking that risk.

618
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:00,630
-What are you doing?
-I'm facebooking you.

619
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,232
-No.
-What is your last name?

620
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,836
--What is it?

621
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,705
It's lin.

622
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,407
-Ruby lin?
-Yes, it is.

623
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,310
I like that.
Ruby lin.

624
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,846
Okay.

625
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:17,380
Is that you?

626
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,618
-Yep.
-Cute pic.

627
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:36,399
Facebook friend request
from Joshua Rosenberg.

628
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,135
Your last name
is Rosenberg?

629
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,137
-It is.
-Ah.

630
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,738
Could you be any more Jewish?

631
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,773
Could you be
any more racist?

632
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,775
I'm just joshing you.

633
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,878
Okay, we're not gonna
say that joke again.

634
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,746
-That's an awful joke.
-I've been waiting all night
to say that.

635
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:52,549
- That's an-- ah.

636
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,317
This is the part where
you hit the "accept" button.

637
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,719
I don't know about that.

638
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,487
I just don't know
if our relationship

639
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,457
is ready to be taken
to the next level yet.

640
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,225
Okay, this is the part
where you hit the button--

641
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,928
-you just hit the button.
-I'm gonna think about it.

642
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,230
-What? Really?
-Yeah, really.

643
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:08,565
Excuse me.

644
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,400
I have to use
the ladies' room.

645
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,708
So cold.

646
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,453
Ready to go?

647
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,422
I can't wait to stalk you
on Facebook later.

648
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:08,692
Stalking is okay,
poking is not allowed.

649
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,844
Look at this skyline.

650
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,779
They go all in
on the light show.

651
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,551
It's easy to see why
people fall in love with it.

652
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:37,354
Yeah...

653
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:38,588
But?

654
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:43,460
I just don't think
that I'm in love with it yet.

655
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:45,662
-No?
-No.

656
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,697
-Huh.
-All right, let me just bitch
about a couple of things,

657
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,367
-and I'll never
bring it up ever again.
-Okay. Hit me.

658
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:54,371
I just think the people here
are a little superficial--

659
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,605
that they only care
about money,

660
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,574
or the perception
of having money.

661
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:58,775
Oh, not everyone.

662
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,744
For example,
our company receptionist

663
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,846
has multiple
Louis vuitton purses,

664
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:05,515
and I know for a fact,
even though it's none
of my business,

665
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:06,916
that just one
of those purses

666
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,718
costs more than
her monthly salary.

667
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,420
Well, yeah, she's got her
priorities straight.

668
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,955
She doesn't even have
her own apartment.

669
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,423
She lives with her parents,
she's 35.

670
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,958
That's a cultural thing,
though.

671
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,760
And when you're saving
money on rent,

672
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,462
you can buy purses.

673
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,365
It's always raining
at the worst times possible.

674
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,534
And there's like a random
typhoon every other week.

675
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,569
Yeah, but if it's a signal 8,
you get off work.

676
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:30,073
-I miss netflix.
-Just run a vpm program.

677
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:33,543
And the Mexican food,
ooh, not good.

678
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:36,046
Yeah, okay,
that one I'll give you.

679
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:39,783
I mean, we live in a major
Cosmopolitan city

680
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:43,420
and, yet, they still make nachos
with doritos and yogurt.

681
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:44,754
Ruby, stop.

682
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,056
Would you look at this?

683
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,558
Look at this.

684
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,563
You're harping about nachos?
Really?

685
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,400
I know, but aren't there
just some foods

686
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,502
-that you miss
from back home?
-Eh.

687
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,638
What's a good slice,
every now and then?

688
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,742
But dim sum?
It's so much better.

689
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:08,578
-Maybe I'm just homesick.
-Maybe you just haven't been
to the right places.

690
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,447
Like where?

691
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:11,948
-Are you hungry?
-I'm always hungry.

692
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,483
All right.

693
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:14,584
I'm gonna take you
where the locals eat.

694
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,919
Okay,
there's just one thing,

695
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:17,921
hmm?

696
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:19,456
I can't eat chicken feet.

697
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,124
Like, I've tried.
I've just looked at it--

698
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,759
-all right.
-I can't do it.

699
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:24,694
We'll save that for another time
when you're ready.

700
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:28,064
I'm gonna take you to the best
seafood spot in Jordan.

701
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,533
All right.

702
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,534
Are you paying?

703
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,002
Yeah, it's cheap.

704
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,871
I got this.

705
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:54,591
... a post-it,
or a curling iron, or--

706
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,526
the one that I always
think about is like,

707
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:59,829
the envelope,
with the little window
on the envelope,

708
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,966
oh, the window on the envelope?
I'm more into the like--

709
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:08,471
-what?
-Nothing. Sorry.

710
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:12,175
Look, don't--
could you stop being
so judgmental?

711
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,778
-I'm not being judgmental.
-You don't know
if they're a couple.

712
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,947
-They could be like
co-workers or something.
-I'm just--

713
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:22,786
-really? Do you do
that with your co-workers?
-Oh, yes, actually.

714
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,889
-You do? Of course you do.
-That's a cultural
thing here as well

715
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:28,758
that you will become
accustomed to.

716
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,164
Do you think anyone
thinks anything of us

717
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,598
when they see us together?

718
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,637
I-- no, I don't--
i don't think that--

719
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,905
-really?
-No.

720
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:43,740
-No?
-No.

721
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,742
You don't think that people
assume that I'm a gold digger?

722
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,143
-A gold digger?
-Yeah.

723
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:49,946
No, if anything,
you're employed,

724
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,915
and you make more money
than me, so,

725
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,784
they'd probably think
you're my sugar mama.

726
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,786
I mean, obviously I make
more money than you,

727
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,123
-but they don't know that.
-"Obviously" you do?

728
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,125
They don't know that.

729
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,693
I just-- I know--

730
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:06,596
I know I'm being
super judgmental,

731
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:10,200
I apologize, but,
i-- I can't help it.

732
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:11,701
I just--
i see couples like this,

733
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,703
and I make assumptions.

734
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:17,507
And I hate that
i perpetuate the stereotype
even further

735
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:19,542
by dating a white guy.

736
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:21,711
-What?
-What?

737
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,515
-So, Greg's a white guy?
-Who's Greg?

738
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:28,852
Oh, he's your boyfriend.
You never told me his name
so I just gave him one.

739
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,188
Yeah. Greg.
I like that name.

740
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,924
Yeah, Greg's a white guy.

741
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:37,160
-So you're one of those
Asian girls, huh?
-What?

742
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,629
Yeah.
That only date white guys.

743
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:41,631
I do not only date
white guys.

744
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,900
-Really?
-No.

745
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,070
Like, the majority
have been white,

746
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,772
- but it's not on purpose.

747
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:52,108
-It's totally coincidental.
-Oh, no, it's okay.

748
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,111
I've had a few
Asian girlfriends,
and suddenly i--

749
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:58,281
like, I'm the white guy
with an Asian fetish.

750
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:00,717
I fucking hate that.

751
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,886
You gotta get used
to couples like this,
it's Hong Kong.

752
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:05,622
-I know.
-It's east meets west.
They're everywhere.

753
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:07,790
-You're right.
-All right?

754
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,259
You're right.

755
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:12,228
There's this couple
in my office--

756
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,598
he's a white guy,
and he's married to this
beautiful Chinese woman,

757
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,166
and when they first
started dating,

758
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:20,703
he didn't know how to speak
any Chinese,

759
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,539
and she couldn't speak
any English.

760
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,008
So like, the first like,
six dates,

761
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,111
they brought like--
they brought on like--
a translator.

762
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:29,779
-Could you imagine--
-like a-- like a person?

763
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,915
-Yeah! A translator.
-Wow.

764
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:34,217
So it was like a table for three
instead of a table for two.

765
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:37,654
Like, it's so-- awkward.

766
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:40,023
I felt so bad
for the translator.

767
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,625
I know. There's a couple
like that in my building,

768
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,561
and, they, uh--

769
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:46,563
everywhere they go,
they-- they get by,

770
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:48,965
but they use--
they use like, a,
like an app.

771
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,334
-Like a Google
translator app.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

772
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:52,835
It's seen that before, too.

773
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,205
Yeah.

774
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,041
Well, do you think
that you'd ever be able

775
00:42:58,043 --> 00:43:00,176
to be in a relationship
like that?

776
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:01,978
Please.
I find it hard enough

777
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
to date girls
who do speak English.

778
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:05,882
Yeah?
How so?

779
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:09,052
It's-- it's just like,
it's not a language barrier,

780
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:11,254
but it's like
a cultural barrier.

781
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:15,758
- Yeah.
-TV shows, movies, music I grew up on,

782
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,627
like it just goes
way over their heads.

783
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:20,163
Yeah.
Yeah, I feel you
on that one.

784
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:21,864
It's been really hard
for me to connect,

785
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:24,233
you know,
with my friends
at that level.

786
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,802
I just want
to be with somebody

787
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:27,270
who understands
what I'm talking about

788
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:31,307
when I say, like--
"no soup for you!"

789
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,943
Ah!
Don't piss off
the soup Nazi.

790
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,212
-Yes.
-It's the best soup
in town.

791
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:39,182
Okay,
i had this ex girlfriend,
and I was--

792
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:41,050
I was trying to watch
"seinfield" with her,

793
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:42,752
-yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Because I had like,
the DVDs,

794
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,687
and she was like,
"i don't get it,"

795
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:46,889
it just seems, like,
about nothing.

796
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:50,293
-And I'm like...
-But that's the whole point.

797
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,028
Exactly.

798
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:26,062
- Yes.
- -These are cool.

799
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:28,297
Put it like that.

800
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,766
And you can take,
like, a selfie.

801
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:31,067
Oh, really?

802
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:32,268
Here, you ready?

803
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,040
-That's awesome.
-Wahh!

804
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,208
I need this in my life.

805
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,311
You know, they said
it was 120 for both.

806
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:44,914
- 80.
- -No?

807
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,816
- 80.
-She's tough.

808
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:48,451
We're gonna walk away
empty handed.

809
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:50,119
That's the thing about
negotiating,

810
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:51,754
you have to be okay
to walk away.

811
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:53,990
Okay.

812
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:55,692
We'll buy it here
for 120.

813
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:05,702
How do you do that?

814
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,706
You gotta work on
your negotiation skills.

815
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:10,707
I'm terrible.

816
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,208
Like, if they say 125,

817
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,177
that really means,
like, 10.

818
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:15,845
160, 160.

819
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:18,114
-No, not selling.
-160? 170.

820
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:19,916
- 180.
-170.

821
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,385
150, you're screwing
this whole thing up.

822
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,221
Whoo!

823
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,728
-No.
-It feels like the Batmobile.

824
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,029
Wow.

825
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:38,768
160.

826
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,070
160. Do you want it?

827
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,005
-160?
-Yeah!

828
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:45,108
Yah!

829
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,810
There's some
cute little trinkets.

830
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:50,813
Wait, this is...

831
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,117
This is moos like Jagger.

832
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,351
Wait, this is mine,
too.

833
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:56,919
-You designed this?
-Yes, I did.

834
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,955
Where did you--
where did you get these?

835
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:00,389
-What are these doing here?
-Very cute.

836
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,391
-Yeah, they are very cute.
I designed them.

837
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:04,093
-He's totally ripping me off.
-Well, um--

838
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,862
do I call the police?

839
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,831
You can take it
as a compliment.

840
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,434
You know you've made it
when you've been ripped off
in China.

841
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,870
They're cute. Cute.
It's a deal?

842
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,505
-Very cheap.
-They're very cheap.

843
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:17,273
-Yeah, real cheap.
-Very good.

844
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:21,077
Okay.
Yeah, you're right.

845
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:23,112
It's a silver lining.

846
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:26,382
-Hey man,
do you have the lady ba-ba?
-Okay, thank you.

847
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,317
-Thank you.
-'Cause I can't find
that anywhere.

848
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,186
We're not gonna
support that.

849
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,191
All right.

850
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:36,793
This is the place.

851
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:38,227
Yum.

852
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,797
Really looking forward
to this fresh crap.

853
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:42,999
Hmm?

854
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:45,101
Oh.

855
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:47,170
- Don't worry about that.

856
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,940
This is great.

857
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:53,176
- Thank you.

858
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,412
Oh, my god.

859
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,548
-I love this.
-Told you.

860
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,250
I know.
I was really hesitant first,
but this is--

861
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,519
this is really good.
Mm, it's really good.

862
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:06,389
-I can see that you like it.
-Mm-hmm.

863
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:08,457
-You know how I can tell?
-How?

864
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,193
Because you have it
all over your face.

865
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,897
-Did I get it?
-No. Other side.

866
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,232
-Other side.
-Did I get it?

867
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:18,167
No. Here.
Hold on.

868
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,602
It's been driving me crazy.

869
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,138
I think I got it.
There you go.

870
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,840
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

871
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:26,175
-I'm sorry.
I'm a messy eater.

872
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:29,512
Hey, to eat politely
is not to eat at all.

873
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:30,913
Oh, is that another
Josh quote?

874
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:32,181
-It is.
-Hmm.

875
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,482
Yours truly.

876
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:37,053
So, do you come here often?

877
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,187
Ah, it sounds like
you're hitting on me.

878
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,891
I used to.

879
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:45,094
-Not so much anymore.
-Yeah, why not?

880
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:48,464
I don't know, um, Sam doesn't
really like it that much.

881
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,002
-Sam is your--
-oh, sorry, Sam,
she's, um,

882
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:55,271
that's my girlfriend.
Sorry. Yeah.

883
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:56,973
- Yeah.
-Samantha.

884
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:01,310
-Not her kind of place?
-No, not really.

885
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:03,613
She likes, um,

886
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:07,149
more like,
Sushi and French places

887
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:10,052
-with ceilings
and comfortable, seats...
-Air conditioning?

888
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,622
Yeah, air conditioning.
Expensive bills.

889
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:14,557
Sounds like
a delicate flower.

890
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,461
No, no.
She's um--

891
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:20,129
she's tough as nails,
actually.

892
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:21,330
How?

893
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,100
She grew up in China,

894
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:27,503
not-- not poor, but,
kinda poor,

895
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,539
but she managed to--
make her way through college

896
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:34,277
on a--
on a full scholarship
to u penn.

897
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,078
-That's really impressive.
-Yeah, she's worked really hard

898
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,380
to get to where she's at.

899
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:38,981
What does she do?

900
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:40,983
She's a banker.

901
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:43,586
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

902
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,254
Okay.

903
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,157
And how did she take
you quitting your job?

904
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,692
Oh, you know...

905
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:51,394
Uh-oh.

906
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:52,595
-Not so good, huh?
-Yeah.

907
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,598
Like--
for someone like her

908
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,600
who's worked so hard
for every opportunity,

909
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:59,168
I think it's difficult
for her to understand

910
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,404
why someone would just
throw it all away.

911
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:04,307
-Well, you're not throwing
it away, technically.
-Yeah. I know I'm not.

912
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:05,474
But--

913
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,378
it's an ongoing discussion.

914
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,713
I guess.

915
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,120
All right.
I've had a couple beers,

916
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,089
I'm gonna say something
i usually probably
wouldn't have.

917
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:24,126
-So please
don't be offended.
-Okay.

918
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,328
I just think
it's a little weird

919
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,630
that she doesn't
understand

920
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,498
why you want
to write, or--

921
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,368
or why she doesn't come
to one of your favorite
restaurants.

922
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:35,004
Well, do you and Greg
agree on everything?

923
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:36,639
No, we don't,
but you know,

924
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,407
we've been together
long enough

925
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:41,110
where we've kind
of ironed out
those important things.

926
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:43,212
"Those things,"
meaning what?

927
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,650
You know,
it's not just about
likes, or dislikes.

928
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:51,253
It's about supporting
each other through
your goals and dreams.

929
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,089
She supports me.

930
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:54,357
I don't want to give you
the wrong impression

931
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,192
that she doesn't
support me.

932
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,595
It's--

933
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,219
hat's another thing
i can't seem to get used to.

934
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:24,487
What?

935
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,757
Oh.

936
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:29,759
You get to a place
where you don't even notice.

937
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:34,196
I can't imagine
not noticing.

938
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,605
Sorry.

939
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,041
Should we get out
of here?

940
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,619
Hey, so-- I'm--
I'm really sorry
about before.

941
00:50:56,621 --> 00:51:01,323
I didn't realize
that you and Sam
were so serious.

942
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:03,192
We've only been going out
for two years.

943
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:05,294
-Two years is a long time.
-It's not that long.

944
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:06,462
It's long enough
for the two of you

945
00:51:06,464 --> 00:51:08,264
to hit
milestones together.

946
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:09,698
I guess.

947
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,300
Did you guys do the whole
meet-the-parents thing?

948
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:13,602
She's met mine,
yeah.

949
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:16,505
But, you haven't met hers?

950
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:17,807
They don't know I exist.

951
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,743
It's complicated.

952
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:23,813
They're not crazy about
their daughter dating a gweilo.

953
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:26,415
But, no, I mean, things--
things are good with us.

954
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,284
Overall.

955
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:31,420
She's got a lot
that she wants to accomplish
career-wise.

956
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,490
Neither one of us
is really ready
to settle down yet.

957
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:39,495
Plus,
she's a little younger.

958
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,166
How much younger
is a little younger?

959
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,502
- Does it really matter?

960
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:48,504
Josh.

961
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:51,340
Which birthday
was she celebrating
when we first met?

962
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,142
-24th.
-24th.

963
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:56,145
Yeah. I'm not
that much older, okay.

964
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:57,813
-Ooh, so typical.
-What?

965
00:51:57,815 --> 00:51:59,115
I-- you're-- you're

966
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:00,416
practically
a decade older,

967
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,184
but that's okay.

968
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:03,652
So, it's not like I'm one
of these 60-year-old guys

969
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:05,221
chasing
around 20-year-olds.

970
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:06,455
Yeah, not yet.

971
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,224
But how do you think
it all starts?

972
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:09,325
Okay,
what is the right age

973
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:10,726
that I should
be dating, then?

974
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:12,128
Let's see--

975
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,297
I would say
if you're 35,

976
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,399
late twenties,
early thirties,

977
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,568
hmm.
How old are you again?

978
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,636
That has nothing
to do with this
conversation.

979
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:21,637
Just-- just curious.

980
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,805
How old are you?

981
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:23,806
-I'm 30.
-Oh.

982
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:26,542
How age-appropriate.

983
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,595
Do you know anything
about cantonese opera?

984
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:47,796
Nope.

985
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:49,198
Are they any good?

986
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:53,936
- I don't know.

987
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:56,472
These are your people.
This is your
cultural heritage.

988
00:52:56,474 --> 00:52:59,275
-You should know this.
-I don't know anything
about Chinese opera.

989
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,819
Well,
from one starving
artist to another,

990
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:12,254
I should probably
tip her.

991
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:13,822
Aw, that's very
nice of you.

992
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,795
Thank you.

993
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:20,796
It's kind of catchy.

994
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:21,897
Yeah, it's grown on me.

995
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,240
So, when are you gonna
take your own advice

996
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:33,909
drop the Teddy bears,
and open up a clothing
boutique, huh?

997
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:37,513
I don't know.
I think I may stick with
singing animals for a while.

998
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:40,382
-Really?
-Yeah.

999
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,918
You know, for a long time
i held fashion in
such a high regard,

1000
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,921
but it was actually
much more difficult
constructing

1001
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:48,424
a three dimensional toy
than it is a piece
of clothing.

1002
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:49,792
Huh.

1003
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:51,894
I just don't think
that I appreciated it

1004
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,829
because I didn't really
spend a lot of time
in the factories,

1005
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:56,432
-but now I do.
-Huh.

1006
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:58,968
-Because last year,
you were kind of--
-what? Above it all?

1007
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,869
Hmm. Yeah.

1008
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:02,771
- Shut up.

1009
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:04,873
Well, you know,
i used to dream of like,
seeing my designs

1010
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,609
at Bergdorf's and barneys,

1011
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:09,011
but, now I get to see it
at every Wal-Mart,

1012
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:10,879
and drug store chain
in the country.

1013
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:11,914
Hmm.
They buy quantity.

1014
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,549
Exactly.

1015
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:15,718
This one time,
i was at walgreens,

1016
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,254
I saw this father buying
one of my toys

1017
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:20,322
-for his daughter--
-uh-huh.

1018
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,725
It actually, like,
brought a little tear
to my eye.

1019
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,929
I know,
it's super cheesy, but--

1020
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,831
it's not cheesy,
it's cute.

1021
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:32,401
Hello, hello.
Come, come, come.

1022
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:34,803
My birdy tell you
fortune, okay?

1023
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:36,872
He's a poor
fortune teller.

1024
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:38,040
That's like a--
that's like a tourist trap.

1025
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:40,976
Well, yeah,
it's so awesome.

1026
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:43,279
- Please sit down.
- -Aw.

1027
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:46,548
Right.
Shall we speak in French,
Italian, German,

1028
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:47,983
English, American English?

1029
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:50,019
-English.
-American English, yes.

1030
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:52,021
Okay. So...

1031
00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:54,490
-Uh, lady first. Okay?
-Yes.

1032
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:55,724
What would you like
to know?

1033
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:58,594
Fortune--
health, study, love,

1034
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:00,362
love.

1035
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,597
Of course.

1036
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,565
All ladies want to know
about now.

1037
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,567
- Always.
- -Okay.

1038
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:07,369
- First, you shall
move the cards. Okay?
-Okay.

1039
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:09,571
Because it's your fortune.

1040
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:15,611
-There.
-Okay.

1041
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:18,347
I will give it to
the birdy to pick. Okay?

1042
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,615
-Okay.
-Okay.

1043
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:21,650
The birdy will decide
your fortune.

1044
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:25,721
I will let the birdy out.
Okay?

1045
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:28,424
- Oh, hey.
-Oh my god, it's so cute.

1046
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:33,028
-Okay, that's pretty cute.
-Aw!

1047
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,965
What's he doing?

1048
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:38,067
He's indecisive.

1049
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:39,401
- Oh.
-Oh my god!

1050
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:41,670
Oh, that was awesome.

1051
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,005
I'm impressed.

1052
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,641
-So, here is your fortune.
-Oh, thank you.

1053
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:49,011
You read. Okay?

1054
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:51,013
"Love can be likened
to a tree,

1055
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:53,982
"when it is blossoming,
wait for fruit with Patience,

1056
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:56,685
"of course the precondition
of our marriage

1057
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,020
is that both of you
have a disposition

1058
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,555
for getting along well.

1059
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:01,957
Thank you for
your h.K. 50 dollars."

1060
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,695
That's it?

1061
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,398
But the birds were cute.
Right?

1062
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,033
Oh, sorry. No good?

1063
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,101
It's good.

1064
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:13,369
Oh, birdy no good?

1065
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:14,470
No, it's fine.

1066
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:15,471
Okay, nevermind.

1067
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:16,605
I tell you fortune,

1068
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:17,606
for real. Okay?

1069
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:19,141
No charge.

1070
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:20,843
You know what?
I'm actually
all fortuned out,

1071
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:23,645
but why don't you do him?

1072
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:24,646
I tell your fortune. Okay?

1073
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:25,848
Yes.
Tell my fortune.

1074
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,549
Okay. Good.
Come here.

1075
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,650
Oh.

1076
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:29,651
I tell your fortune,

1077
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:30,652
from your face.

1078
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:31,687
Oh, okay.

1079
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:32,688
This side doing it?

1080
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,958
Okay.

1081
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,959
- My god.
- -What?

1082
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:40,896
Everything okay?

1083
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,564
Very big nose.

1084
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,436
Is that a fortune,
or is that just like,
a statement?

1085
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:50,539
No, no, no.
Big nose means much money.
Okay?

1086
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,040
Oh.

1087
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:53,609
- Wow.
- Lots of money.

1088
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:55,677
-Should I be offended by this?
-Not at all.

1089
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:56,712
-It doesn't sound--
-he hasn't even gotten
to your ears yet.

1090
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:58,447
-Okay.
-But,

1091
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:01,150
-you have to wait
until you are 40.
-Oh.

1092
00:57:01,152 --> 00:57:02,718
Big nose,
much money,

1093
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,819
when you are 40.

1094
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:04,887
Until I'm 40,
all right.

1095
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:05,954
Right.

1096
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:08,957
Are you married?

1097
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:11,026
Me? No, no, no, no.

1098
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:14,163
I think maybe
come very close.

1099
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,032
Yes.

1100
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:20,436
I think maybe
you're engaged.

1101
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:22,604
I was.

1102
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,007
Ah. Too bad. Right?

1103
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:26,442
But never mind.

1104
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,643
New love coming.

1105
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:31,547
Yes, thank you.
You can tell all this
by my nose, huh?

1106
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:33,749
No, no.
I can tell it
from the young lady.

1107
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:35,083
And the way you look
at each other.

1108
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:36,819
-You're good.
-Oh, no.

1109
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,887
All right.
Well, thank you.

1110
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,155
- Good.
- -I-- you have a beautiful nose, as well, sir.

1111
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:41,857
Thank you.

1112
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:42,858
- Much money.
-Here.

1113
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,092
Yeah. Good.

1114
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,594
For the birds. Okay?
For the birds.

1115
00:57:45,596 --> 00:57:46,862
- Okay.
- -All right.

1116
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:48,764
- Aw, thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1117
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,666
- I'll be back when I'm 40.
-Thank you.

1118
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:51,767
- And see if you're right.
-Good luck.

1119
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,248
What?

1120
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,784
So you were engaged once.

1121
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:10,118
Okay. There it is.
Ten minutes.

1122
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,054
I knew you were
gonna ask me.

1123
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:13,789
What happened?
I mean, we don't have
to talk about it--

1124
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,657
I don't--
i don't care.
I'll talk about it.

1125
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:18,160
We were young,
and stupid.

1126
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:19,661
We met right after
graduation,

1127
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:23,265
and we got engaged
three weeks later.

1128
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:25,734
Yeah. She was
an American lit major.

1129
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:28,604
So-- we--
we took a day trip
up to sleepy hollow

1130
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:29,838
and I got one one knee,

1131
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,773
right on
Washington Irving's grave.

1132
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:34,977
Aw. That's impulsive
and weirdly romantic.

1133
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,078
Yep.

1134
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,180
Then she cheated on me,

1135
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:39,915
with my friend.

1136
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,517
-I'm really sorry...
-No, it's-- it's--

1137
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:42,885
-that's awful.
-Actually, it's fine.

1138
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:45,254
It all worked out
for the best.

1139
00:58:45,256 --> 00:58:47,122
You know,
i came here
for a job,

1140
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:48,824
I was only supposed
to be here for a year.

1141
00:58:48,826 --> 00:58:50,125
Sounds familiar.

1142
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,593
11 years later.

1143
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:53,629
Could I end up here
for that long?

1144
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:55,664
Well, you never know,

1145
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:57,266
yeah,
i guess you don't.

1146
00:58:57,268 --> 00:58:59,768
Oops.

1147
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,637
-Is he trying
to Skype you?
-Sorry. No, no,

1148
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:05,841
it's just--
my outlook reminder
for a Skype call later.

1149
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:07,009
Wait, your what?

1150
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:09,144
I know, I know.
It's pretty dorky.

1151
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:12,147
But he likes to send me
an outlook reminder
for our Skype dates.

1152
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:13,916
Wow, that's uh--

1153
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:15,851
because it makes him happy
to see it in his calendar,

1154
00:59:15,853 --> 00:59:18,120
so...

1155
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:19,254
Well, I guess
that's pretty sweet.

1156
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,725
-Yeah.
-It is really sweet.

1157
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,060
So how long
have you and Greg

1158
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:28,230
been, uh--

1159
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:31,867
um, five years,
on and off.

1160
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:35,203
-So, when we met you were--
-off, again.

1161
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:36,605
Obviously.

1162
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:39,074
Hey, I don't know.

1163
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,043
What's next for you two?

1164
00:59:43,781 --> 00:59:45,180
- Oh, sorry.
-Yeah, no worries.

1165
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:46,982
My turn.

1166
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:50,652
Hello? Hey.

1167
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:52,754
Yeah. I'm sorry,
I'm gonna be there.

1168
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,090
I just got caught up
with something. Okay.

1169
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,625
Okay. Coming.

1170
00:59:56,627 --> 00:59:58,827
Sorry. Bye.

1171
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:01,830
-Sam?
-No.

1172
01:00:01,832 --> 01:00:03,098
It was my friends--
they're-- they're musicians

1173
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,232
they're playing
at this little spot

1174
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:07,269
-over in Hong Kong.
-Oh.

1175
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,004
-Do you want to come?
-No thanks.

1176
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,176
-She's not gonna be there.
-I wasn't thinking that.

1177
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:17,312
Okay, then
forget I said it.

1178
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:19,748
It would be a good
opportunity for you to meet
some new people.

1179
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:22,684
-Come on.
-No, i-- I don't know.

1180
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:25,287
I just--
it would be weird.

1181
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,755
You're being weird.

1182
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:28,256
It's practically
on your way home.

1183
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,993
Come on.
We'll split a cab.

1184
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:32,327
I'm not being weird.

1185
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:33,328
You're being weird,
let's just go.

1186
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,997
It's-- they're a good band.

1187
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:38,166
Fine, only if you can
find a cab.

1188
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,837
All right.

1189
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,773
-This is weird.
-Everyone knows you can't
find a cross-harbor taxi

1190
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:46,241
at this time.

1191
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:47,943
There's usually
a long line
of taxis here.

1192
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:51,880
Here we go.

1193
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,221
-No? Come on.
-See? Told ya.

1194
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:01,156
-Maybe it's a sign.
-A sign of what?

1195
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:02,758
That I should just
take the train home.

1196
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,394
No. That's not happening.

1197
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:07,129
We're getting a taxi.

1198
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:08,730
All right,
I'm gonna give you
one more shot.

1199
01:01:08,732 --> 01:01:10,899
Okay.
I'll take those odds.

1200
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,769
Here we go.

1201
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:14,870
This is the one.

1202
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,375
- Hey, Josh.
- -Hey, man, how are you?

1203
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:28,477
Hey, Josh.

1204
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:29,778
This is Ruby.

1205
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,179
-Hi.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

1206
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:32,481
-How's everything
with work?
-Good.

1207
01:02:32,483 --> 01:02:33,949
Tell them I said hello.

1208
01:02:33,951 --> 01:02:36,485
-Will do.
-Thank you.

1209
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,423
You want a drink?

1210
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:42,991
Yeah.
That would be great.

1211
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:44,993
-What are you having?
-I'll have a beer.

1212
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:47,129
Thank you.

1213
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,246
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1214
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,348
Cheers.

1215
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:31,506
-So I want to--
-so, i--

1216
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:34,342
no, you first.
You first.

1217
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:35,911
Your friends are great.

1218
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:37,379
Yeah. Yeah,
they have a residency here.

1219
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:39,548
Oh. It's a cool place.

1220
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,550
-It's cool, right?
-Yeah.

1221
01:03:41,552 --> 01:03:42,551
I'm sorry,
what were you gonna say?

1222
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:44,152
Oh, I wanted to--

1223
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:47,122
I wanted to show you
this picture.

1224
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,425
No.

1225
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:52,194
Ten minutes
after we met.

1226
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:53,895
And this got me
into a lot of trouble.

1227
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,164
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1228
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,999
What happened?

1229
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:00,836
-I told Sam what
happened that night.
-Mm-hmm.

1230
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:02,838
And then she saw
this photo three months later.

1231
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,840
And she was like--

1232
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:06,274
"well, you didn't tell me
she was that pretty."

1233
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:08,176
Whatever.
She didn't say that.

1234
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:15,383
Whoo!

1235
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,253
Thank you very much.

1236
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:21,323
I think we have
a few more songs.

1237
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:22,858
What do you guys
want to hear?

1238
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,960
- "Hearts!"
-"Hearts!"

1239
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:26,328
Is that their big one?

1240
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:27,629
-The big one.
-Yeah?

1241
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:44,279
Okay. Come on.
Let's go.

1242
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:45,647
Oh, no, no, no, no,
please.

1243
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:47,249
Come on, come on.
Come on.

1244
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,101
Josh?

1245
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,104
-How's it going?
-Hey, Monica.

1246
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:17,272
Good, uh--

1247
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:19,541
this is my friend, Ruby.

1248
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:22,177
-Hey.
-Hi, I'm Monica,
Sam's friend.

1249
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,478
His girlfriend.

1250
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,547
She knows Sam.
Yeah.

1251
01:06:25,549 --> 01:06:27,182
What are you doing here?

1252
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:29,551
Uh, we just came here
to see knots and axes,

1253
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:32,320
-with the guys.
-Well it was really good
seeing you.

1254
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,688
Yeah, you too.

1255
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:36,124
-Tell Sam I said hi.
-I will.

1256
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:38,026
Good to see you.
Bye.

1257
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,465
Excuse me.

1258
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:49,170
Wait.

1259
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,271
Hey, Josh,
we're taking off.

1260
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:51,673
Oh, you guys
are taking off?

1261
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,508
-Yeah.
-Why don't you come over
sometime, man?

1262
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,377
-Yeah. I will,
i will, I promise.
-And check out the new--

1263
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:15,497
you okay?

1264
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,334
Yeah,
i just needed some air.

1265
01:07:19,336 --> 01:07:21,770
Yeah.

1266
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:23,071
Sorry about that.

1267
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,075
It was pretty awful.

1268
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,513
Can I get one of these?

1269
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:36,818
Yeah.

1270
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:52,700
What are we doing?

1271
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,707
Smoking a cigarette.

1272
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:04,112
I don't--
i don't know.

1273
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:05,680
What do you mean?

1274
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:10,485
I mean this whole night.

1275
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:11,786
-Look--
-what are we doing?

1276
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:14,656
I know where you're going
with this, but--

1277
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:17,392
really, we were just
hanging out.

1278
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,762
Right?

1279
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:32,207
I don't know.

1280
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:45,220
I need to get going.

1281
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,325
-Should we split a cab?
-Yeah, that's fine.

1282
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:49,450
-Which address?
-Uh, ridgeview terrace.

1283
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:50,785
I'm on a square street,
thanks.

1284
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:24,485
Does she appreciate
your stupid quotes?

1285
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:29,991
Does he appreciate
your sassy attitude
all the time?

1286
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,994
It goes right over
his head.

1287
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:34,462
That's good, I guess.

1288
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,501
- It's not fair for them.

1289
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,474
We haven't done anything.

1290
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:49,978
I don't want
to be a cheater.

1291
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:52,280
Neither do I.

1292
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:54,816
But, we're not.

1293
01:10:54,818 --> 01:10:55,950
I'm talking about
emotionally cheating,

1294
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:56,951
not just--

1295
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:59,954
all right.

1296
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:02,857
It's hard to define.

1297
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,861
You know when you feel it.

1298
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:10,365
Look, I don't think
we should beat ourselves
up over this.

1299
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:11,966
Maybe just by virtue
of the fact

1300
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,935
-that we can have
a night like this.
-Two.

1301
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,904
Exactly.
Two nights like this.

1302
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:20,742
Maybe that means
that we should

1303
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:22,043
take a good look
at our relationships

1304
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:26,914
and, I don't know,
re-evaluate them.

1305
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:38,026
-He's coming this weekend.
-Who, Greg?

1306
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:39,661
Daniel,
his name is Daniel.

1307
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:41,896
Daniel, wow.

1308
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:44,299
I was way off.

1309
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:46,434
And he's helping me
pack up.

1310
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,804
My year is up next week.

1311
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:53,074
And the suit was...

1312
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:55,510
For our engagement party.

1313
01:11:57,713 --> 01:12:00,548
You're engaged?

1314
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:03,718
Yeah.

1315
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,587
--I'm sorry.

1316
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:08,856
I know,
i should have told you
sooner, I just--

1317
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:10,525
it's just such
a new thing for me.

1318
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:13,027
I'm not really used
to the idea yet.

1319
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,898
You're not wearing
a ring.

1320
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,966
We're picking out
one together,
when he gets here.

1321
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:21,369
It's just--
more cost-efficient
that way.

1322
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:22,670
Good, old,
sensible Greg.

1323
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,607
Did he propose
over Skype, too?

1324
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:28,476
No.

1325
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:31,079
We discussed it together
as a decision we made.

1326
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:36,384
Very, very romantic.

1327
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:38,019
Not everyone can be
as impulsive as you.

1328
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,561
I'm happy for you, Ruby.

1329
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,697
I am.

1330
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:58,873
Except now,
i just--

1331
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,876
I don't know what I want.

1332
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,711
I don't know what I want.

1333
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,962
Okay, total--

1334
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:22,563
just, one second.

1335
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,866
Right here.
Meter running.

1336
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:27,635
Just keep it running,
it's okay.

1337
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:30,905
What-- what are
you saying, Ruby?

1338
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,573
I don't know.
I just--

1339
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,810
this night just threw me
for such a loop.

1340
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,113
Me too.

1341
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:41,849
I don't want to hurt him.

1342
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,421
I don't want to hurt her.
