1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,009
This is Amy Fisher's story,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,550
her version of the truth.

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,530
She says she had a partner in crime.

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,750
The man she claims was her lover, Joey Buttafuoco.

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,570
He has consistently denied any sexual involvement with her

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,280
and any knowledge of the criminal activities

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,550
you will see portrayed in this film.

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,737
Only they know what really happened.

9
00:00:17,737 --> 00:00:20,154
(soft music)

10
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:53,355
(bubbles popping)

11
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:55,772
(soft music)

12
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:08,702
(alarm beeps)

13
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,119
(soft music)

14
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:23,636
(keys tapping)

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,353
Joey.

16
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:31,413
Yeah, I heard.

17
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:35,513
They saying the mafia did it.

18
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:40,729
Just talk?

19
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,553
Nothing else?

20
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,113
I'd better not.

21
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,347
I love you too.

22
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:05,939
(foot steps)

23
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,272
Going for a run.

24
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:17,970
(door bangs)

25
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,470
(engine revs)

26
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,370
(radio plays)

27
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,706
(siren screeching)

28
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:53,829
(tires screech)

29
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:54,662
Freeze.

30
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:58,613
Put your hands on the wheel.

31
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,312
Why, what did I do?

32
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:01,401
Get em on the wheel.

33
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:02,635
What did I do?

34
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:04,041
Get out of the car, now!

35
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:07,160
Down on your knees and cross your feet.

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,993
Ouch,

37
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:09,138
Cross your feet.

38
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:12,790
What did I do?

39
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,463
Dear Paul, I'm making this tape so you won't forget me.

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,620
So you'll know I'm thinking about you.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,700
Do you think about me?

42
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,173
I hope so.

43
00:03:28,924 --> 00:03:31,933
My lawyer says I shouldn't communicate with anybody,

44
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,930
but he doesn't understand how I feel.

45
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,480
You're the only one I could trust, even Joey betrayed me.

46
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,790
You're probably laughing.

47
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,960
Maybe I should have expected it,

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,960
but I didn't, not that he'd lie about everything.

49
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,810
So now I'm locked up and I can't even call anybody

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,550
'cause somebody might be listening.

51
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,070
And there's like a $2 million bail,

52
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,643
so I'll never get outta here.

53
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,793
Paul, you're the only one who understands.

54
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,253
You're the only one who'll believe me when I say,

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,993
I still don't know what happened.

56
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,420
I mean, I know what I did,

57
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,213
but I just don't understand how it all began.

58
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,293
Was it my father, what he did to me?

59
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,123
He says he's sorry now.

60
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,093
Poor, pathetic fool that he is.

61
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,243
Or my mother who never stopped him.

62
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,370
Or did it start with Joey?

63
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,260
Give me a million dollars,

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,530
I couldn't tell you where the damage was.

65
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,340
Very good work.

66
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,850
I told the princesses if she needs anything else

67
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,430
done to her car, this is the place.

68
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,623
Amy, this is Mr. Buttafuoco.

69
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,920
Hi.

70
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,753
Joey.

71
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,633
If you need anything, just bring the car to him.

72
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,597
You need this.

73
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:25,822
Anything.

74
00:05:25,822 --> 00:05:26,655
Thank you.

75
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,110
Indeed, thank you.

76
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,210
Good to see you again.

77
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,360
Let me get that for you.

78
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:37,994
(door slams)

79
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:40,494
(engine revs)

80
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,360
He was very polite, a real gentleman.

81
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,320
Did you see that?

82
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,153
Jail bait.

83
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,039
I didn't even see him again for, must've been months.

84
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,640
(bell ringing)

85
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,260
It's gonna be a great play (indistinct).

86
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,510
I wasn't invited.

87
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,618
Come on, Amy, nobody's invited, not really.

88
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:07,770
You just show up.

89
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,070
Amy.

90
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,903
I gotta go.

91
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,470
With them?

92
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,570
Yeah.

93
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,610
Crystal and Ellen don't even go to school here.

94
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,078
Not anymore.

95
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:18,323
So?

96
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,540
Where you going? I'll take you.

97
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,560
You can't, it's girl's stuff,

98
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,770
first the braces, now the hair

99
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,280
He looks happy.

100
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,580
He wants me to go to Toll bay.

101
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,338
There's a million guys there on the beach, on the dock.

102
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:34,421
Oh, boring.

103
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:36,671
I'd rather be in Brooklyn.

104
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:38,221
(doors slam)

105
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,781
With guys that are old enough to know what to do

106
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:41,675
in the dark.

107
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:42,909
(engine roars)

108
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:43,743
No, Roseanne,

109
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:45,928
you tell me, you two are the big buddy buddies here.

110
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:47,423
Explain that.

111
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,480
Elliot, it's only hair.

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,313
Purple hair?

113
00:06:51,313 --> 00:06:53,090
It's just a hair extension.

114
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,840
This is her future we're talking about here.

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,420
Her educational future.

116
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,120
What does my hair have to do with school?

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,570
You're not concentrating.

118
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,720
I go every day, my grades all right.

119
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,553
Amy.

120
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,810
You look like a slut.

121
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,123
Elliot, stop it.

122
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,590
Can I go now?

123
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,540
May I go?

124
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,163
Whatever, mom?

125
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:17,942
(chair scrapes)

126
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,490
She's spoiled.

127
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,640
She's young.

128
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,743
She's too young.

129
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,576
For what?

130
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:27,370
Are you blind, the way she dresses, her hair.

131
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,980
She's willful, spoiled.

132
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,050
And who bought her the dog and the car?

133
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,250
I did and that's fine.

134
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,730
But I expect her to hold up her end, work, study.

135
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,563
If you...

136
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:36,990
You're supposed to be her mother,

137
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,090
not her sister or her friend.

138
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,100
She works at the mall.

139
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,550
She goes to class. She'll pass.

140
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,093
She'll be all right.

141
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,570
I'm just afraid she'll take off again.

142
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,420
And you're not.

143
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,659
No, I'm telling you Crystal.

144
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,500
No, he just went crazy.

145
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,823
He's like that.

146
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,230
No, I can't (chuckles).

147
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:10,643
I guess I'm gonna go.

148
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,481
(door handle creaks)

149
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:17,898
(soft music)

150
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:27,221
(door closes)

151
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:29,638
(soft music)

152
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,520
Paul, before you, there was only one person

153
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,670
I could talk to, really talk

154
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,563
who wouldn't betray my confidence.

155
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:27,053
My aunt Violet.

156
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,180
She's younger than my mom.

157
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,083
A lot younger.

158
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,883
And she listened.

159
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,520
I'm telling you I can't stay there anymore.

160
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,683
Amy, can't you just...

161
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:41,516
I can't.

162
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:43,470
I mean, you know what he's like,

163
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,650
and her, that's why you haven't talked to them for 13 years.

164
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,483
Yeah.

165
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:49,520
It's everything.

166
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,245
I mean, everything, work, school.

167
00:09:52,245 --> 00:09:55,760
Who I see, where I go and now my hair,

168
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,070
I mean, he talks to me like I'm a kid,

169
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,103
like he still thinks I'm a child.

170
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,870
What's your mom say?

171
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,360
Nothing.

172
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,433
You know? I mean, she tries to talk to him and she says,

173
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,847
"She's got a life Elliot, let her live it".

174
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,060
But he won't.

175
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,440
And I don't know, you know, he acts like

176
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,110
he's all concerned.

177
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,703
And maybe he is, but it's not for me.

178
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,113
You know it's for himself.

179
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,793
And she just ignores it.

180
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,033
I mean, she won't stand up to him.

181
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,060
Not when it counts.

182
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,650
Yeah, but you know, running away is not the answer.

183
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,400
Yeah, but why can't I go live with gram again?

184
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,447
Or come live with you?

185
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:50,800
You're my aunt.

186
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,050
Because gram's old

187
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,531
and if you came here,

188
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:57,033
you know the way your mom feels about me,

189
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,800
it would never work.

190
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,990
Amy, listen to me now,

191
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,360
you've only got your senior year to go.

192
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,453
I mean, you've got one more year and then you are free.

193
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:11,728
And if I can make it that long?

194
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:14,413
Of course you gonna make it.

195
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:16,163
Oh come here kid.

196
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,930
Okay, I want it right here, okay?

197
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,930
Amy, only spelled A I M E E and in pink.

198
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,933
Hot pink, like your hair?

199
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,423
No, I like it.

200
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,633
Really?

201
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,693
So, how hot do you want it?

202
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,710
As hot as you've got

203
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,380
Are you sure you can handle it?

204
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,013
Try me.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,333
You're the boss.

206
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,720
So is she your boss?

207
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,013
That's my wife, Mary Jo.

208
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,990
Beautiful, don't you think?

209
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,913
She's the model for magazines.

210
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,553
No doubt about it, I got me a beautiful woman.

211
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,343
I mean, it was all just flirting, nothing serious.

212
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,543
He had a wife.

213
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:29,269
(upbeat music)

214
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:35,813
I don't feel like dancing.

215
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:37,480
I do. Let's do it.

216
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:39,752
Don't you wanna dance?

217
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:42,315
No, I'm gonna go talk to Mick.

218
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:43,458
That loser?

219
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,040
(upbeat music)

220
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:54,582
Hey.

221
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,566
Where's Tom?

222
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:58,399
I dunno.

223
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:01,055
Hey, are you still at home?

224
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,422
Yeah, I'm sick of it.

225
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:03,808
I'm gonna get my own place soon.

226
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:04,641
All right.

227
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:05,474
Come on, lets dance.

228
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:06,307
Come on.

229
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:12,020
Her car is not ready yet.

230
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,520
So I'm gonna drive her home.

231
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,350
I'll be back in a half hour.

232
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,183
Yeah, sure.

233
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:21,242
(door bangs)

234
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:23,909
(engine starts)

235
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,523
So he took me home and that's when everything changed.

236
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:34,083
Dad, Dad?

237
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,440
Your folks working?

238
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,400
Yeah, every day, except Sunday,

239
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,610
unless my dad's fallen asleep

240
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,770
and he's got a heart condition.

241
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,070
All right, it's too bad.

242
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,700
Boy, this place is beautiful.

243
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,293
What's upstairs?

244
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,023
Just bedrooms and stuff.

245
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,970
You know, you can tell a lot about a woman

246
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,303
by how she decorates.

247
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,181
(stairs creaking)

248
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,233
Hey, (chuckles) look at all this stuff.

249
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,283
This is great.

250
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,550
Your father's right, you are a princess,

251
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,423
a beautiful princess.

252
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,900
Did anybody ever tell you how beautiful you are?

253
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,063
And not like a girl either, like a woman.

254
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,140
You smell good too.

255
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,440
You believe in love at first sight?

256
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,543
I dunno, I guess.

257
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,461
Wait, my parents are...

258
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:16,737
Yeah, they're working, remember?

259
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:21,788
(soft music)

260
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:45,932
(keys tapping)

261
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,173
Theresa?

262
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,103
You are not gonna believe what just happened.

263
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:56,271
(birds chirping)

264
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,040
Hey, Joey.

265
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,140
Good day hey fellas.

266
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,890
Yeah, very good day.

267
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,040
All right, way to go.

268
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,048
See you Joe.

269
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:08,881
It's fun.

270
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:11,595
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

271
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,715
Double Trouble.

272
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:15,298
(engine roars)

273
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,309
You like it?

274
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:22,250
I love it.

275
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,050
(engine roars)

276
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,220
You wanna drive?

277
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,387
Of course I wanna drive.

278
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,050
Just stay away from the rocks.

279
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,103
Which rocks? Those rocks.

280
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:39,247
_ Good night sir.

281
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:40,960
Ah, Mr. Buttafuoco.

282
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,746
Alan, how are you?

283
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:44,380
You've got things set up for my girlfriend here?

284
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,960
Of course. Your usual table.

285
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,006
Yeah.

286
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,746
And take good care of us, okay.

287
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:51,163
(soft music)

288
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,660
Good seeing you again, sir.

289
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,110
And I'll send your waiter over right away.

290
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,943
Thank you.

291
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:11,640
You see that guy over there?

292
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,990
Yeah.

293
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,290
Do you know who that is?

294
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,819
Yeah. The mafia guy.

295
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,857
What's his name?

296
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:18,737
Shush, shush, shush.

297
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,920
Well, you know him?

298
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Let's just say we have mutual friends.

299
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:31,550
You know, this is what I live for.

300
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,163
Romance, love, sex.

301
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,143
You do too, I can tell.

302
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,283
That's why we're made for each other.

303
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,800
I never had it before.

304
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,250
Come on.

305
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,593
Not like this.

306
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,370
You mean with love?

307
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,863
That's okay you don't have to say it, I can wait.

308
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,450
I just want you to know how I feel.

309
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:03,859
(soft music)

310
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,710
I said hang the shirt's, Fischer.

311
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,560
Don't fold them, hang.

312
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,660
You know how to do that?

313
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,140
I know you have got an attitude problem.

314
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,220
I've got, am I the one who's late all the time?

315
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,850
Who can't follow direction?

316
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,050
You know what?

317
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,913
Hang em yourself.

318
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,430
You're fired, Fisher.

319
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,560
Yeah, like hell. I quit.

320
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,393
Amy?

321
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:30,459
Theresa, get back here.

322
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:31,780
What are you gonna do when your dad finds out?

323
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,930
Who's gonna tell him?

324
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,760
You told him, so what happened?

325
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,190
Nothing.

326
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,880
I mean, nothing.

327
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,548
He's like crazy.

328
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:45,170
He's like, I never know with him, you know,

329
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,607
I mean I put a hair extension in my hair

330
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,130
and he goes ballistic.

331
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,000
But I quit my job, nothing.

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,650
Don't worry, princess, you'll get another one.

333
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,520
Forget him.

334
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,683
Wish I could.

335
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,550
So where's the new boyfriend?

336
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,853
Late.

337
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,153
Who I really want to hear about is this guy, Joey.

338
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:07,986
Not Joey, Joey.

339
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:12,115
Sorry. Joey.

340
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:15,934
Joey who?

341
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:19,460
You don't know him.

342
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,863
If he goes to JFK, I know him.

343
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,373
He's outta high school.

344
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,009
How far outta high school?

345
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,913
Um, 18 years.

346
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:37,223
36?

347
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,470
Geez.

348
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,697
(engine running)

349
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:46,760
You know, all night's

350
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,813
just a few bucks more than four hours.

351
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,720
Okay, Mr. Buta..

352
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,553
Buttafuoco.

353
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,360
When you said go out,

354
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,973
I didn't know you meant a deli sandwich and a motel.

355
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,175
Hey, come on.

356
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,008
Simple pleasures.

357
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,953
Did you get it?

358
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,663
What's the code?

359
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,910
007.

360
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,813
That's right, we're secret agents.

361
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,243
That was great.

362
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:44,655
(passionate kissing)

363
00:20:57,404 --> 00:20:59,668
(soft laugh)

364
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:00,918
Joey, for me?

365
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:04,836
It's beautiful.

366
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,343
Oh, I wish I could get you something.

367
00:21:15,236 --> 00:21:16,686
I know what you can get me.

368
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,340
Besides that.

369
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,610
All right, but nothing expensive.

370
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,970
All right.

371
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,083
Maybe just a Rolex.

372
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,083
You're a working girl, right?

373
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,603
Not anymore. I quit.

374
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,100
You quit?

375
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,553
What are you gonna do for money?

376
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:40,369
I don't know.

377
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,115
Find a job where the customers wait on me.

378
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:46,750
Oh yeah.

379
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,836
Like what?

380
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:50,419
(soft chuckle)

381
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,033
God, it felt so good to be loved.

382
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,958
(engine humming)

383
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,559
(dog barks)

384
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:15,104
(door slams)

385
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,044
(door opens)

386
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:19,877
Did they come?

387
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:21,570
Yeah. Too early.

388
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,640
My mom was still here.
(excited screech)

389
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,480
I had to tell her they were for me, I lied.

390
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,078
So?

391
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:28,050
What, you want to get caught?

392
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,003
Don't be jealous.

393
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,360
Right. Of an old married guy.

394
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,860
Amy, he's a sleaze.

395
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,580
Won't even send the flowers to your house.

396
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,540
Oh, yeah right.

397
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,293
Like my dad would really love that.

398
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,000
He's using you.

399
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,310
Teresa, I thought you were my friend.

400
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,630
But I am.

401
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,580
That's why I'm trying to talk to you.

402
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,393
I mean, what do you see in this guy anyway?

403
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,380
He loves me.

404
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,243
We have great sex and he fixes my car.

405
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't know if he's using you, Amy,

406
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,920
but I think your friends are right.

407
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,130
He could be.

408
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,630
But he loves me.

409
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,800
He says it.

410
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,403
Amy, what's he gonna say if he wants to have sex?

411
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,060
You're gonna tell me not to see him aren't you?

412
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,483
Would it do any good?

413
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,693
No.

414
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,913
You know, this isn't some boy your own age.

415
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,293
This is a married man.

416
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:30,480
You gotta protect yourself.

417
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,900
He's had a vasectomy.

418
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,363
Not sexually, emotionally.

419
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,260
And I really think you ought to talk to your...

420
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,520
No.

421
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,380
Amy, your mother's old fashioned,

422
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,493
but we both know she loves you.

423
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,610
Vi, she'll tell my dad, please.

424
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,830
I mean, you told me that I could come to you with anything

425
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,260
that you wouldn't tell.

426
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,263
And I won't.

427
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,210
It's just that from, you know what you told me,

428
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,523
this guy sounds strange, sick.

429
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,470
Vi, I just want you to help me figure out

430
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,640
if he's telling the truth,

431
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,670
just help me figure out if he loves me.

432
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,903
Amy, it's not that simple.

433
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,473
But it was, we have fun.

434
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,400
He made me laugh and I felt good about myself.

435
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,223
Even though sometimes I had my doubts.

436
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,460
Tell me she's not beautiful?

437
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,280
Joey, tell me she's 18.

438
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,920
Yeah. Going on 35.

439
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,550
Right babe?

440
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,420
This is a woman, gentlemen.

441
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,253
A real woman.

442
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,203
Can she talk?

443
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,413
Yeah, when there's someone to talk to.

444
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:55,181
Ooh.

445
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,770
And since there's nobody like that around here,

446
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,487
wanna take a walk down to the boat?

447
00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:04,123
All right.

448
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:06,540
(soft music)

449
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:12,593
Is that all I am to you, sex?

450
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,290
You're the one wearing the clothes.

451
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,980
Well, no clothes.

452
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,850
You asked me to.

453
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,600
No, you asked me what looks good.

454
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:24,323
Maybe my aunt's right?

455
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,930
What, you're talking to your family about us?

456
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,030
Joey, you're hurting me.

457
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,230
What are you stupid?

458
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,300
You want this thing to end?

459
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,328
No.

460
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:34,928
Then you keep your mouth shut.

461
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,550
She won't tell.

462
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,193
Hey, I say shut, you understand?

463
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:51,897
Hey, I love you.

464
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,040
And maybe you just say that

465
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,590
so you could get what you want.

466
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,372
Do you know, maybe I do.

467
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,530
Seriously.

468
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,140
Our relationship is about more than just sex.

469
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,050
Yeah, like what?

470
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,720
Like, I tell you about my life.

471
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,237
What do I know about yours?

472
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:17,070
(water splashing)

473
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:21,509
(boat creaks)

474
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,160
Hey, I've already told you what's important.

475
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,993
I love you.

476
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,160
That's more than I've heard from you.

477
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,660
I do love you.

478
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,390
It's just, I don't want every time we're together,

479
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,673
to have to be sexual.

480
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,323
All right.

481
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,163
Well, what do you want to know?

482
00:26:45,551 --> 00:26:47,193
I don't know, anything.

483
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,963
How about, about Mary Jo?

484
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,890
She's a good woman.

485
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,290
She's the mother of my kids.

486
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,887
So how'd you meet her?

487
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,753
In high school, we were high school sweethearts.

488
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,543
We still are.

489
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,610
Amy, she's my wife, all right?

490
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,473
We live together, but 20 years is a long time.

491
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,670
That's why I'm here.

492
00:27:19,148 --> 00:27:20,223
Just for sex?

493
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,193
Not just for sex. Come on.

494
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
You don't know how good this is, do you?

495
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,423
So tell me, how come you picked me?

496
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:43,170
Because you're beautiful and smart.

497
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,513
Sexy and tough.

498
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Don't you know that?

499
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,920
That's what I love about you.

500
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,733
You're a woman who knows how to live free.

501
00:27:55,511 --> 00:28:00,161
That's why we're so good together, in bed and out.

502
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:02,578
(soft music)

503
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,883
Joey, Joey, Joey, we can't make love.

504
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,300
What now?

505
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,673
I told you, I've got this burning sensation.

506
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:29,435
It's probably just a rash.

507
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,870
Or honeymooner's disease.

508
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,233
Elliot!

509
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:38,348
(heavy breathing)

510
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:41,017
(soft crying)

511
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:42,890
You said you wouldn't tell.

512
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,880
I said that we would talk together.

513
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,913
Talk Elliot.

514
00:28:45,913 --> 00:28:47,300
Then she better stop lying.

515
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,350
You do not get herpes from toilet seats.

516
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,730
It wasn't Joey.

517
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,481
Then why did you tell your mother that it was?

518
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,400
Because I was scared, okay.

519
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,730
You expect me to believe you got this disease

520
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,753
from some boy you met once at a beach party?

521
00:28:57,753 --> 00:28:58,773
It's the truth.

522
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:00,270
Elliot, stop it, she's gotta go to school.

523
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,233
Fine. Go, go!

524
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,790
I want you home when school's out.

525
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,500
What did the police say?

526
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,673
If it was him, it's statutory rape.

527
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,580
You're kidding, a girl like that?

528
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,030
I'm telling you.

529
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,677
Never, not before me.

530
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:25,510
(phone rings)

531
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,880
I'm taking her places she's never been.

532
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,713
Joey?

533
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,383
Joey.

534
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,230
All right, I'll be right there.

535
00:29:43,903 --> 00:29:45,870
When I think of that son of a bitch,

536
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,147
I got a good mind to go over there and...

537
00:29:47,147 --> 00:29:48,420
Don't.

538
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,463
Look, we'll deal with it tonight, okay.

539
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,907
(engine running)

540
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:01,532
(soft music)

541
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,543
Mrs. Fisher.

542
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,410
What are you doing here?

543
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,937
Hey, this is not what it looks like.

544
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:33,830
And you?

545
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,060
I, I had an accident, Ma.

546
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,893
An accident?

547
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:37,726
Are you all right?

548
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:38,812
Yeah, she's fine.

549
00:30:38,812 --> 00:30:40,260
She just threw out the undercarriage of her car,

550
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,470
taking a shortcut.

551
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,110
We had to tow it in here.

552
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,217
I just called Mr. B to help me with the car.

553
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:47,510
Why didn't you call us?

554
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,070
Come on. We're going home.

555
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,780
Look, this is a big misunderstanding.

556
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,270
And you, you follow us.

557
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,883
We are gonna clear this up right now!

558
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,020
I told them it wasn't you Mr. B.

559
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,690
Yeah. Well, you got that right.

560
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,260
What I can't figure out is how could you lie like that,

561
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,780
to your folks an all?

562
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,033
Especially when I thought we're friends.

563
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,400
I'm sorry.

564
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,210
So you're trying to tell us

565
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,120
that you have not been seeing Amy?

566
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,953
See her?

567
00:31:18,953 --> 00:31:22,010
Yeah, sure I see her, when she brings her car in.

568
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,480
Yeah, sometimes she hangs around

569
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,959
and once when she was having to wait,

570
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,710
I bought her a slice of pizza,

571
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,000
but I swear Mr. Fisher, Mrs. Fisher,

572
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,740
I would never do anything to abuse your trust.

573
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,403
I mean you're valued customers.

574
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,120
And besides, she's just a kid.

575
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,953
16.

576
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,663
Yeah.

577
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,890
You know look, I have kids on my own,

578
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,160
so I understand what you must've been going through,

579
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,720
but I swear, whatever Amy's been telling you,

580
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,570
I don't know how she got her problem.

581
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,980
Then why would she say that it was you?

582
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,250
Ma, I told you...

583
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,550
I would like to hear it from Mr. Buttafuoco.

584
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,270
I really don't know. Mrs. Fisher,

585
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,720
I guess maybe she has a crush on me or something.

586
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,090
Is that what this is, a crush?

587
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,180
If you knew that, why did you let her hang around?

588
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,968
It was my mistake. It seemed harmless.

589
00:32:09,968 --> 00:32:11,810
It was not harmless.

590
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,913
Well, I see that now, but at the time I had no idea.

591
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,683
Look, no harm done, I hope.

592
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,670
And if you want to ask me any questions,

593
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,080
I mean, go right ahead, because I got nothing to hide.

594
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,100
She needs to finish school.

595
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,320
That's what I tell my kids.

596
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,260
You gotta finish school,

597
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,900
listen to what your folks are telling you.

598
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,890
So if she's hanging around your shop,

599
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,920
we'd appreciate it if you just send her on her way.

600
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,250
Yeah, if that's what you want, you got it.

601
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,400
No more pizza for you.

602
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,913
Do we understand each other?

603
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,690
Do we?

604
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,890
Absolutely.

605
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,183
I mean, I'd do the same thing if it was my kid.

606
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,403
No hard feelings?

607
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,800
One condition.

608
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,550
You keep bringing me your business.

609
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,197
I'm really sorry, Mr. B.

610
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,320
Look, let's just forget about it, okay.

611
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,083
We all get carried away sometimes.

612
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,370
I'm even kind of flattered that a beautiful girl like you

613
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,643
would even think about a older guy like me.

614
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,490
Mr. Fisher, Mrs. Fisher, I will call you about the car.

615
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,023
When will it be ready, Mr. B?

616
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,730
How'd I do?

617
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,100
I almost believed you myself.

618
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,920
Yeah, We'd better cool it for a while, okay.

619
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,970
Yeah. Just ping me.

620
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:38,740
Bye, Mr. B.

621
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,843
They're lying.

622
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,940
Maybe, but there's nothing we can do.

623
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,613
Not with them both denying it.

624
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,300
Except to make sure she stays away from him.

625
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,970
I couldn't go by the shop.

626
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,243
My parents had me on a 10 o'clock curfew.

627
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,403
All I could do was sneak a few calls.

628
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,123
Weeks went by.

629
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,904
(loud sigh)

630
00:34:08,904 --> 00:34:09,773
It was terrible.

631
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,719
You are making it with a married guy?

632
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,039
So what?

633
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,172
(soft laugh)

634
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:19,293
Pretend you're my boyfriend, all right.

635
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:21,210
All right, all right.

636
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:24,665
(door slams)

637
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,500
Hey, is Mr. B around?

638
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,612
Hey, Joey?

639
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,710
Just wait one second.

640
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,871
What are you crazy coming here?

641
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:43,822
I had to see you.

642
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,583
How's my car doing?

643
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,840
Well, it was a lot of damage.

644
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,612
Yeah. So when will it be fixed?

645
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,040
Well, it's hard to say,

646
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,510
I got all the paperwork in my office.

647
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,980
Why don't we go in there?

648
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,610
My dad said he'd buy me a new car, you know,

649
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,410
if there's too much damage, only not a sports car,

650
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,360
but he'll pay for it.

651
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,097
And he'll let me make payments to him.

652
00:35:06,097 --> 00:35:07,690
You know, we'll talk to the adjuster,

653
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,590
because we here at Tides Auto and Body...

654
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,153
Who's the guy?

655
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,233
My cover.

656
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,010
I'd buy you a sports car.

657
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,520
I love you. I missed you.

658
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,810
Me too, but we gotta be careful.

659
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,450
You gotta be smart.

660
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,480
We meet in public.

661
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,860
Pretend we're just friends.

662
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,018
When will you meet me?

663
00:35:29,018 --> 00:35:29,851
Where?

664
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,260
There's a Church Carnival.

665
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,223
I'm taking my kids, but my wife won't be there.

666
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,670
I got a better idea.

667
00:35:41,126 --> 00:35:43,160
(soft knocking)

668
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,590
Amy.

669
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,960
I just wanted to tell you that the insurance adjuster

670
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,370
called back.

671
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,030
Apparently they missed some damage

672
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,830
the first time they checked the car.

673
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,160
Your father's going to take your car shopping,

674
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,890
but don't tell him, I told you, act surprised.

675
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,250
All right. I will.

676
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,083
Thanks mom.

677
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:09,100
Is everything else okay?

678
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,933
You know.

679
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,360
Mom, it's over, all right.

680
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,730
Can we just stop talking about it?

681
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,820
Yeah.

682
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,740
I'm sorry. You're right.

683
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,356
Night, night, sleep tight.

684
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:23,773
(door bangs)

685
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:28,485
(soft music)

686
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,220
So now I had a new car

687
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,960
and all I needed was a job to pay for my half.

688
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,140
That's when Joey suggested an escort service.

689
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,113
He denies it.

690
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,460
But I remember him opening up the phone book,

691
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:14,460
showing me the number, telling me, "Hey, it's a nice place".

692
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,150
My friends go there.

693
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,673
You'd get dressed up. Go fancy places.

694
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,750
I thought I was gonna be Cinderella.

695
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,620
Welcome home, Mr. B.

696
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,037
(soft music)

697
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:40,470
(lion roars)

698
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,390
Hey, hey will you make up your mind?

699
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,643
You're driving me crazy.

700
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:51,095
(control bangs)

701
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,014
It looks good.

702
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:14,073
It's yours.

703
00:38:29,672 --> 00:38:32,101
It really wouldn't bother you?

704
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,695
If I?

705
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:34,894
What?

706
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:36,311
You know, if I?

707
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,930
Didn't I already tell you, you have sex with your body.

708
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,380
You make love with your mind.

709
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,493
I don't care who you're with.

710
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,323
As long as I know,

711
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:54,293
I'm the only one you really love and you don't kiss them.

712
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:56,163
Right?

713
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,743
You know, the problem is my parents, you know,

714
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:04,807
I have to lie to them again.

715
00:39:04,807 --> 00:39:06,280
You know what you need?

716
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,050
Buttafuoco's rules of survival.

717
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,210
Number one, do anything you want,

718
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,200
but just make sure you don't get caught.

719
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,473
Number two, never tell anybody more than they have to know.

720
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:20,670
You see, life is beautiful.

721
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,043
You just gotta, you gotta live it on the edge.

722
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,563
I'm not the first one you've lied about to Mary Jo.

723
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:33,763
Am I?

724
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,320
Look, I don't claim to be a saint,

725
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,697
but if you love somebody,

726
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:45,860
big deal if you get a little on the side,

727
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,833
I mean, it don't mean nothing.

728
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,100
Hey, I'm not talking about you, okay.

729
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,187
I'm talking about before you,

730
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:54,437
because you're different.

731
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,530
All I'm saying is that if you love me,

732
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,480
what I'm gonna get mad if you make it with another guy?

733
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,033
No way, it doesn't make any difference.

734
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,520
As long as nobody gets hurt.

735
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,503
But I do love you, Joey.

736
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,973
I love making love only to you.

737
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,260
Come on, who you kidding?

738
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,723
You just love sex like me, right?

739
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,970
Right?

740
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,083
Yeah. I guess,

741
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:44,327
But what am I to you?

742
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:45,270
I mean...

743
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:49,840
Hey, I already told you,

744
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,403
you are everything.

745
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,243
Everything.

746
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,520
If I wasn't married and Catholic and didn't have two kids,

747
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,940
I got to be concerned with.

748
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:04,341
Hey, you listen to me.

749
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,890
If it wasn't Mary Jo,

750
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,540
you know who would be, don't you?

751
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,133
Don't you?

752
00:41:14,511 --> 00:41:17,178
(loud knocking)

753
00:41:18,591 --> 00:41:19,424
Oh man.

754
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,423
Come on honey.

755
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,670
You know what I want.

756
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,730
A date.

757
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,000
That's what they told me.

758
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,660
What is this?

759
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,683
Your first time?

760
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,850
Wow, come a little closer

761
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:42,610
and I'll tell you what you can do for this.

762
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,027
(soft music)

763
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,020
People ask me, how could you do it?

764
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:55,705
Now I don't know.

765
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:01,397
Back then, I had to prove myself to Joey

766
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,213
and besides I did need the money.

767
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,423
Way to go, Terry.

768
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,883
Hey Fisher, Terry got your job.

769
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,560
Congratulations.

770
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,940
Oh, not that Fisher needs one

771
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,120
with the auto mechanic paying her bills.

772
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,640
Not that Fisher needs minimum wage,

773
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,750
where she could make a hundred bucks an hour

774
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,250
Doing what?

775
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,220
An escort service.

776
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,941
You're a hooker?

777
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:36,680
No, I'm an escort.

778
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,260
You're trying to tell me that for a hundred bucks an hour,

779
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,163
they don't get sex?

780
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,143
I'm not trying to tell you anything.

781
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,393
What do you do?

782
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,540
I eat dinner in elegant restaurants.

783
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,750
I drink fine wine.

784
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,530
And I enjoy intelligent conversation with mature men,

785
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,827
which you obviously know nothing about.

786
00:43:04,827 --> 00:43:06,980
(sarcastic laughter)

787
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:07,813
Amy?

788
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:13,406
Amy, are you crazy?

789
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,493
Who cares?

790
00:43:24,817 --> 00:43:25,650
(door slams)

791
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,630
How do these guys pay for sex with credit cards?

792
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,950
Well, I fill out the receipt, like they buying flowers.

793
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,653
I turn it in and I pick up my cut.

794
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,110
You, there you go.

795
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,227
Thank you.

796
00:43:39,695 --> 00:43:40,528
All right.

797
00:43:40,528 --> 00:43:42,770
So where's Joey when you doing it with guys for money?

798
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,383
I don't do it with Joey.

799
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:46,720
We make love.

800
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,613
Excuse me.

801
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:51,990
Look, whatever you doing, I just hope you're bagging them.

802
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,940
What do you think I am, crazy?

803
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,960
Everyone has a condom on.

804
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,310
Except Joey.

805
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,680
Yeah, and what if they don't want to?

806
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,480
Most of them are old, you know?

807
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,540
And they just want to talk.

808
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,120
Maybe, you know, look, hold hands.

809
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,030
And if they don't want to?

810
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,730
Look, I'm in control.

811
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:13,723
I mean, they just lie down and they never touch me.

812
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,193
God, don't I wish that was true.

813
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,713
I thought a shower would just wash it all away.

814
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,540
I mean, what was the big deal?

815
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,743
Joey didn't care.

816
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,173
Even liked to hear about it.

817
00:44:35,428 --> 00:44:36,628
And didn't Joey love me?

818
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:40,683
It had to be okay.

819
00:44:41,732 --> 00:44:44,482
(engine running)

820
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,723
You wanna tell me what we're doing here?

821
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,100
Proving he's a liar.

822
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,360
Who, Joey?

823
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,406
Yeah.

824
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:57,080
You see, see that's her car.

825
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,913
The Jeep.

826
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,090
The Cadillac's his.

827
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,497
And the bikes?

828
00:45:02,497 --> 00:45:04,123
Must be his kids.

829
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,533
His kids?

830
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:07,633
Yeah.

831
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,943
We'll bond, you know.

832
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:14,710
It'll be like me and my aunt, you know,

833
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,543
like sisters.

834
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,660
I mean the boy will be harder.

835
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:20,998
But it'll be all right, you know,

836
00:45:20,998 --> 00:45:22,410
he's already bonded with Joey.

837
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,466
Oh, there she is, see her?

838
00:45:25,466 --> 00:45:26,803
I saw a woman.

839
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,890
Was she prettier than me?

840
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,693
What?

841
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:35,431
C'mon, you saw her, is she prettier than me?

842
00:45:35,431 --> 00:45:37,803
I don't know. I couldn't see that well.

843
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:42,281
Can't wait until she's out of the way.

844
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,363
Why doesn't he just get a divorce?

845
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,913
He can't, you know, I mean, he's like Catholic, right?

846
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,713
Plus I mean, she's the mother of his kids.

847
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,270
You could always kidnap her or something.

848
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,360
Yeah. Like hold her for ransom, Joey.

849
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,070
Make her pay with Joey.

850
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,793
Yeah, but she'd still be around.

851
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,680
Not if you like drowned her.

852
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,490
She washes out to sea.

853
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:19,410
Shot, Tina.

854
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,250
No, no, no drown her in acid.

855
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,390
All right.

856
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:24,850
She just disappears.

857
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,540
Nitric acid.

858
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,950
No way.

859
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,473
Sulfuric acid, what the hell.

860
00:46:32,215 --> 00:46:33,365
Oh, it will never work.

861
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,467
Yeah.

862
00:46:35,467 --> 00:46:37,970
Well, you know, you got to do something,

863
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:40,970
because it sounds to me like his playing with you.

864
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,293
Yeah, tell me about it.

865
00:46:43,993 --> 00:46:47,650
You would think maybe it's time you took some control.

866
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,000
Maybe she's the one you love.

867
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,053
And I'm just your piece on the side.

868
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,126
C'mon, what you talking about?

869
00:47:00,126 --> 00:47:01,476
Talking about you and me.

870
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,390
Yeah. And here we are.

871
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,372
Yeah. Now, but what about in a month?

872
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:09,205
Or a year?

873
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:16,950
Amy, I already told you, it's you that I love, right.

874
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,360
When are you gonna get that through your thick head?

875
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,193
It's you!

876
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:27,840
God forbid anything should happen to Mary Jo.

877
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,883
Oh, God forbid.

878
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,360
What's that supposed to mean?

879
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,360
It means, it means Joey, if you're serious,

880
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:43,470
if you mean what you say, then get a divorce.

881
00:47:48,054 --> 00:47:48,887
Or what?

882
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:56,589
Or it's over.

883
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,093
You giving me an ultimatum?

884
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,553
Fine!

885
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:18,273
Fine, Joey, what do you mean?

886
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,120
Where you going?

887
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,323
Joey, I'm sorry.

888
00:48:22,323 --> 00:48:24,323
Hey, hey, it's no big deal.

889
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,310
I got to spend some time with the family anyway,

890
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,423
you know, Thanksgiving, Christmas.

891
00:48:30,853 --> 00:48:32,153
You know how it is, right?

892
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,509
I'll see you around.

893
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:40,259
(dramatic music)

894
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,040
(soft knocking)

895
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,873
Amy?

896
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:50,877
I'm not hungry.

897
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,133
Amy, honey, what's wrong?

898
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,460
Can't you tell me anything?

899
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,440
What if there was a girl who was in love with an older man

900
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,043
and he said he loved her too.

901
00:49:20,726 --> 00:49:23,726
And then one day he just dumped her.

902
00:49:32,453 --> 00:49:34,703
We just talking hypothetically here, right?

903
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,400
I'd say that the girl was probably lucky to be out

904
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,453
of that relationship,

905
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,983
but that it probably wouldn't feel that way.

906
00:49:50,676 --> 00:49:53,843
What it would feel like is her heart's been broken.

907
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,563
(somber music)

908
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,510
Forget him.

909
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,390
How?

910
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,223
Yeah. How?

911
00:50:07,223 --> 00:50:09,340
I mean, he might be a jerk but you love him, right?

912
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,310
You gotta be strong. You can't call him.

913
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,000
You gotta make him come to you.

914
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
He's going back to his wife, is what he's doing.

915
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,450
And you don't stand a chance.

916
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,633
Wait a minute, I got an idea.

917
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,000
Amy, this is crazy.

918
00:50:27,012 --> 00:50:29,163
Well, you know what Joey always says,

919
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,783
you got to live on the edge.

920
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:35,533
(birds chirping)

921
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:46,267
(gate creaks)

922
00:51:02,545 --> 00:51:05,745
(bell chimes)

923
00:51:05,745 --> 00:51:08,495
(birds chirping)

924
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,447
Hi, can I help you?

925
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:24,770
Yeah, I'm from Massapequa High School.

926
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:29,980
I'm a selling these candies for fundraising, you know,

927
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,870
for charity.

928
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,422
It's just a dollar.

929
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:34,255
I don't know.

930
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:35,088
You know, the kids still have plenty

931
00:51:35,088 --> 00:51:36,043
left over from Halloween.

932
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,530
Yeah, but it's really important.

933
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,323
You know, I got a quota to sell.

934
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,633
It's for a really good cause.

935
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,083
One then, okay.

936
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,443
Hey, Hey.

937
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,053
You're welcome.

938
00:52:03,645 --> 00:52:06,111
(gate slams)

939
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:08,170
I can't believe you did that.

940
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,010
What'd she say?

941
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:10,440
Who cares.

942
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,690
She's old. She's out of shape.

943
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:15,291
I'm prettier. I got a better body.

944
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,220
If he wants to be with her,

945
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,401
he can have her.

946
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,932
♪ Misery stay away from me ♪

947
00:52:21,932 --> 00:52:23,338
♪ You big fat slob ♪

948
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:25,912
♪ You are history ♪

949
00:52:25,912 --> 00:52:28,829
(laughs jovially)

950
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:37,100
Joey didn't call or beep, but I was strong.

951
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,133
I didn't call him.

952
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,030
I pretended everything was great.

953
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,493
And after a while I didn't have to pretend.

954
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,793
My mom and I were going shopping.

955
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,990
Cause we were going on this great vacation on Christmas

956
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,283
and I was gonna have fun.

957
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,560
And you know something, I did.

958
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,463
I really did.

959
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,343
And then when we got back,

960
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,130
my mom and I spent time together doing my applications

961
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,373
for college in the fall.

962
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,533
And by the time school started again,

963
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,070
I'd almost forgotten about Joe.

964
00:53:19,568 --> 00:53:20,401
Almost.

965
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,390
Yeah. So they got dorms there where I could live.

966
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,260
Yeah, right, away from home.

967
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,651
But I can still come back on weekends and visit everybody.

968
00:53:30,651 --> 00:53:33,983
(pager beeping)

969
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:36,283
Wait a minute Theresa, my beeper is going off.

970
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:39,713
No, nobody's been beeping me since I broke up with Joey.

971
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:41,413
I don't even know where it is.

972
00:53:42,282 --> 00:53:44,121
Oh, hold on.

973
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:46,704
(pager beeping)

974
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,020
Theresa, can I call you back?

975
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,470
Yeah.

976
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,543
It's 007.

977
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,343
No, no, it's over.

978
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,470
I just want to hear him whine.

979
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,423
(door slams)

980
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,923
(engine revs)

981
00:54:24,696 --> 00:54:27,279
(horn honking)

982
00:54:43,935 --> 00:54:44,810
Where you going?

983
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:45,643
Home.

984
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,113
We are home.

985
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,640
But you dumped me?

986
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,350
I didn't dump you.

987
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,980
You get off that already.

988
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,753
Well, you never called,

989
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,360
Well, we're here aren't we?

990
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:15,803
Yeah, but for what, a quickie?

991
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,220
Am I gonna see you?

992
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,133
You just try to keep me away.

993
00:55:36,341 --> 00:55:39,424
(passionate kissing)

994
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:42,003
God, I missed you so much.

995
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:46,654
(passionate kissing)

996
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,653
When?

997
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,543
When what?

998
00:55:51,543 --> 00:55:52,733
Am I gonna see you?

999
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,483
Look, you see me when you see me, okay?

1000
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,260
Well you got to get a life here, Amy.

1001
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,690
I told you things are gonna work out,

1002
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,003
but we can't be impatient.

1003
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,860
Why don't you hang out with your friends?

1004
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,713
You girlfriend.

1005
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:14,803
Maybe get some exercise.

1006
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:18,041
I'll fix you up with my trainer.

1007
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,733
Those thighs could use it.

1008
00:56:26,085 --> 00:56:28,502
(door bangs)

1009
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,080
Listen, I've had it.

1010
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,474
Look, I've got a lot of work to do,

1011
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,110
I'll see you tonight.

1012
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:36,943
Yeah. Right.

1013
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,603
Damn.

1014
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,693
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1015
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:43,908
Sorry about the interruption.

1016
00:56:43,908 --> 00:56:44,741
It's all right.

1017
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:48,243
What I'll do is, I'll set up a training program for you.

1018
00:56:48,243 --> 00:56:49,533
Personalized program.

1019
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,530
So, am I gonna look as good as you?

1020
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,560
Do you wanna look as good as me?

1021
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,870
Well, you look pretty good.

1022
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:57,717
So do you.

1023
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,803
We'll be working on toning, not bulking up.

1024
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:06,995
You know how to use this equipment?

1025
00:57:06,995 --> 00:57:09,022
Sure.

1026
00:57:09,022 --> 00:57:09,863
Show me.

1027
00:57:15,893 --> 00:57:17,093
No, no, no, no, hold on.

1028
00:57:18,925 --> 00:57:21,432
Yes, well done, nice and slow.

1029
00:57:21,432 --> 00:57:22,500
Right.

1030
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,166
There you go.

1031
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:27,416
Let it up nice and slow, nice and slow.

1032
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:39,636
(door closing)

1033
00:57:39,636 --> 00:57:40,469
Radical.

1034
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:43,973
What do you do in here?

1035
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,793
Work out?

1036
00:57:47,605 --> 00:57:51,863
Hey, I came here looking for a trainer.

1037
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:56,571
Anyway, what would your wife say?

1038
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:02,500
We're not married, besides we have an understanding.

1039
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:03,733
Like what?

1040
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:07,833
She lives her life and I live mine.

1041
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:16,960
Amy, Joey's just as big a sleaze now as he ever was

1042
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,810
and you can't believe a word he says, you know that.

1043
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,200
So what are you doing?

1044
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,173
I love him.

1045
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:25,555
But he's gonna dump you again.

1046
00:58:25,555 --> 00:58:28,773
No, this time he is mine.

1047
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:33,194
(upbeat music)

1048
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:37,725
Hey, Joey.

1049
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:42,913
Paulie.

1050
00:58:42,913 --> 00:58:44,447
Hey, Mr. B, long time no see.

1051
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:46,001
You looking all flabby.

1052
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:47,101
What you a wise guy?

1053
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:48,923
Come here.

1054
00:58:50,707 --> 00:58:52,200
I sent you a referral.

1055
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,520
She ever show up, a girl about 17.

1056
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,353
Nice body.

1057
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,440
Amy, yeah.

1058
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,274
Yeah, that's it, Amy Fisher.

1059
00:58:59,274 --> 00:59:00,587
Yeah, that's the girl.

1060
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:02,833
I got her on a program, personal program.

1061
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,870
Yeah, that's good.

1062
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,170
That's good. She needs it.

1063
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,220
Is there anything else you want to tell me, Mr. B?

1064
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,660
No, no, she's a good kid.

1065
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,660
I know her old, man.

1066
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,470
All right, I'm gonna hit it.

1067
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,303
Okay.

1068
00:59:19,303 --> 00:59:20,520
I'll see you later.

1069
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:31,140
So, this guy, Paul, he's hot?

1070
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,097
And if he's good looking, why not?

1071
00:59:32,097 --> 00:59:35,893
You know, a little jealousy to keep old Joey honest.

1072
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:45,510
Thanks for helping, cleaning this place is a drag.

1073
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,673
So what's my reward?

1074
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,811
What do you have in mind?

1075
00:59:49,811 --> 00:59:51,859
I don't know. What do you have in mind?

1076
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:53,373
(pager beeping)

1077
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:54,206
You wanna use the phone?

1078
00:59:54,206 --> 00:59:55,720
No. It's nobody.

1079
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,980
I won't tell Joey you said that.

1080
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,450
Come on, I'll take you out and buy you something to eat,

1081
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,250
but I got to stop by my house first.

1082
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,083
All right.

1083
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:02,916
Can I ride with you?

1084
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:03,749
Sure.

1085
01:00:07,593 --> 01:00:09,373
Come on in.

1086
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:10,770
This is the living room.

1087
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:13,265
Make yourself at home and I will be right back.

1088
01:00:13,265 --> 01:00:14,098
Okay.

1089
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:36,820
What are these for?

1090
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:38,090
The shotguns?

1091
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,390
You never seen one before?

1092
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,022
I hate guns.

1093
01:00:42,022 --> 01:00:44,240
(pager beeping)

1094
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,440
So, where's the bedroom?

1095
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:47,563
Upstairs.

1096
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,840
And who sleeps there?

1097
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:52,763
She does.

1098
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:56,120
So where are you?

1099
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,060
In the guest room.

1100
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,473
Look, it's kinda complicated.

1101
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,000
Hey, what, you're still seeing Joey.

1102
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,750
I am not.

1103
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,600
Amy, you can't lie to me.

1104
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,923
With a teacher like Joey, don't bet on it.

1105
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,053
Anyways it's true.

1106
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,520
So how come he's always beeping you?

1107
01:01:18,494 --> 01:01:20,840
He's jealous.

1108
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,690
Yeah, but there's nothing going on.

1109
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:24,403
There isn't?

1110
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:28,123
No wonder the guy hasn't come back to the gym.

1111
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,660
It's over.

1112
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,210
I mean, for me it is, you know, we're friends and all,

1113
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:37,500
and sometimes I'll let him take me out to dinner.

1114
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,680
We talk, but no sex.

1115
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,290
Come on, Amy.

1116
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,123
Really.

1117
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,660
He wants to, but I won't let him.

1118
01:01:50,675 --> 01:01:53,092
(soft music)

1119
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:56,633
You doing him?

1120
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:58,633
No, but what if I was?

1121
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:08,667
With your body or your mind?

1122
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:10,334
What do you think?

1123
01:02:12,817 --> 01:02:14,680
You know, that guy, he's scum.

1124
01:02:16,305 --> 01:02:18,026
He's nice to me.

1125
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:18,940
Yeah, sure he's nice to you.

1126
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,890
He wants something.

1127
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,930
You know, he deals drugs, steroids.

1128
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:28,920
Hey, you didn't know that did you, well it's true.

1129
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,884
Well, you told me to go there.

1130
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:32,693
Yeah. I told you to go there to work out.

1131
01:02:35,326 --> 01:02:37,210
Okay, I don't want you talking to him, right.

1132
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:39,183
You don't say anything about us to him.

1133
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:45,850
Us, as in marriage?

1134
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,740
What are you talking about, marriage?

1135
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,840
Who said anything about marriage?

1136
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,763
I said, we'd be together, but marriage, I've been married.

1137
01:02:57,154 --> 01:02:58,254
Yeah, but not to me.

1138
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,523
A sports cars better, believe me.

1139
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:06,293
I'd rather have you.

1140
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:15,750
A black one, like my cat, Angel.

1141
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,080
I'll buy you a sports car.

1142
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,929
You can drive me around.

1143
01:03:21,929 --> 01:03:23,729
What do you think of that?

1144
01:03:23,729 --> 01:03:26,146
(soft music)

1145
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,763
What could I think?

1146
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,883
Cause I wanted him.

1147
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,390
I wanted the life I'd learned with him.

1148
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:49,090
The only trouble was I began to want you too,

1149
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,453
cause we'd talk, you know?

1150
01:03:51,988 --> 01:03:52,973
And it was nice.

1151
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:54,853
Felt easy.

1152
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,433
Now can we go dancing?

1153
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,343
You got it.

1154
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:02,050
Take a shower.

1155
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:02,913
Just a shower?

1156
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:06,090
(soft chuckle)

1157
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:07,439
Come here.

1158
01:04:07,439 --> 01:04:08,272
Okay.

1159
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,677
Close your eyes.

1160
01:04:12,677 --> 01:04:13,510
Why?

1161
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:14,343
You'll see.

1162
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:16,730
Keep your eyes closed.

1163
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:21,730
Okay.

1164
01:04:27,314 --> 01:04:28,833
Open.

1165
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,060
Turn you on?

1166
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:36,740
(soft music)

1167
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,463
Is that what you're gonna do to me?

1168
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:40,573
Anytime.

1169
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:44,470
Where's the camera.

1170
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,513
I'll get it.

1171
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,720
He keeps telling me, you know that he loves me.

1172
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,440
That he wants to be with me.

1173
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,100
That we're gonna be together.

1174
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,020
It's gonna happen.

1175
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,860
But it never does.

1176
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:03,960
There's always Paul.

1177
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:06,480
He lives with somebody.

1178
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,570
Yeah, but he's not married.

1179
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,050
Right?

1180
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:09,883
Do you love him?

1181
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,920
Sometimes I think maybe I could.

1182
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,833
Then dump Joey.

1183
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,153
I can't.

1184
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,860
I can't. I love him.

1185
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:25,610
Look, I don't see you dumping your boyfriend.

1186
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:28,160
Dump, if I catch the little whore

1187
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,743
that he's been seeing, bang!

1188
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,093
That's realistic.

1189
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:34,923
What do you know?

1190
01:05:34,923 --> 01:05:37,550
Oh like you could really get a gun?

1191
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:38,600
You call me a liar?

1192
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,732
You could?

1193
01:05:41,732 --> 01:05:43,173
Sure, anytime.

1194
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:46,723
But hey, let's not get carried away.

1195
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,420
For me?

1196
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,060
For you?

1197
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:53,350
The little princess.

1198
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,593
Come on, seriously.

1199
01:05:57,279 --> 01:05:58,113
Seriously.

1200
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,823
What for, robbing banks?

1201
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,693
Look, maybe you're right.

1202
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,993
Maybe it is time that somebody took control.

1203
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,773
Is this a joke?

1204
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,546
This is a joke, right?

1205
01:06:19,546 --> 01:06:20,379
Right?

1206
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:29,000
People ask me if I meant it.

1207
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,163
Paul, did I really want her dead?

1208
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,150
I never thought about it.

1209
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:38,742
All I thought about was having Joey.

1210
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,993
Except sometimes when I was with you.

1211
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,933
Paul, can I ask you a question?

1212
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:51,270
Do you think if you love somebody

1213
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,770
that it's all right to have sex with other people.

1214
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:56,123
Who told you that?

1215
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,130
I think it's false love.

1216
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:03,080
You know you got to stop listening to Joey.

1217
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:06,573
I'm not, I'm not even seeing him anymore.

1218
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:10,170
So where's all your money coming from?

1219
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:14,640
Joey never gave me money.

1220
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,613
I work.

1221
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:17,603
Doing what?

1222
01:07:18,995 --> 01:07:20,763
Just a job.

1223
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,453
An escort job?

1224
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,837
Who told you about that?

1225
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:31,363
You think people don't know, don't talk?

1226
01:07:33,529 --> 01:07:35,890
Well, there's nothing to talk about.

1227
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,203
I don't do it anymore.

1228
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:42,053
And besides, it was never sexual or anything.

1229
01:07:43,084 --> 01:07:44,490
(pager beeping)

1230
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:47,260
Right, like that's not Joey?

1231
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,147
Well can I help it if he calls?

1232
01:07:49,147 --> 01:07:50,797
You can get rid of your beeper.

1233
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,653
Why should I miss calls from my friends?

1234
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:57,736
(persistent beeping)

1235
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:09,997
You know, he acts like he owns me, you know.

1236
01:08:10,882 --> 01:08:13,400
Like I'm his possession or something.

1237
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,713
Why does he think that if you not still seeing him?

1238
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,502
Fine. Don't believe me all right.

1239
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:23,620
It's not like you care about me anyway.

1240
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:24,663
Amy, I do.

1241
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,832
Do you?

1242
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,810
Then how come you keep rejecting me?

1243
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,233
Rejecting?

1244
01:08:35,559 --> 01:08:37,273
Does your girlfriend know about me?

1245
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:39,042
Does she?

1246
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,440
So what's honest about that?

1247
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,910
I told you we have an arrangement, right?

1248
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:51,490
What you and I have together is great,

1249
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:52,323
but I can't get involved

1250
01:08:52,323 --> 01:08:55,750
into another relationship, not right now.

1251
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,750
Then I'm gonna go out with other guys.

1252
01:08:59,354 --> 01:09:01,104
I think you should.

1253
01:09:02,446 --> 01:09:03,863
Good, watch me.

1254
01:09:05,013 --> 01:09:07,595
(somber music)

1255
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:18,075
(engine running)

1256
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,649
Amy, I'm telling you, this is crazy.

1257
01:09:26,649 --> 01:09:28,113
Just introduce us.

1258
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,940
Darren. Amy.

1259
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,800
Hey.

1260
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,970
Hi. I heard you could help me out.

1261
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:41,040
Maybe, it'll cost you.

1262
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,270
How much?

1263
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:43,470
Depends what you want.

1264
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:48,880
I want you to hit someone.

1265
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,712
Who?

1266
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:53,183
My boyfriend's wife.

1267
01:09:55,421 --> 01:09:59,038
So, what do you want me to hit her with, my fist?

1268
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:00,360
(soft laughter)

1269
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,633
No, a gun.

1270
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:06,420
Well, that'll cost you.

1271
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:11,403
So when can you do it, tomorrow, next week?

1272
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:14,620
What next year? What?

1273
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:15,452
I'll call you.

1274
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,150
Hey, you know, I heard that before.

1275
01:10:20,493 --> 01:10:23,260
Maybe we should find somebody else, you know.

1276
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,559
Somebody with guts.

1277
01:10:24,559 --> 01:10:26,057
Hey, I can do it.

1278
01:10:28,816 --> 01:10:29,649
Soon.

1279
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,232
I wanted to stay mad at you, Paul.

1280
01:10:33,232 --> 01:10:34,690
But I couldn't.

1281
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:38,350
Maybe because I kept hoping things between us would change.

1282
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:40,774
I don't know who to believe anymore.

1283
01:10:40,774 --> 01:10:42,230
Me.

1284
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:43,230
I want to.

1285
01:10:44,169 --> 01:10:46,702
All those things that Joey's been telling you about me.

1286
01:10:46,702 --> 01:10:47,993
They're not true.

1287
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:50,740
He's just jealous.

1288
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,490
What you still hanging around him for?

1289
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:53,363
He loves me.

1290
01:10:54,318 --> 01:10:56,200
Do you still love him?

1291
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,680
If it wasn't for his wife.

1292
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,800
Oh, you really believe that?

1293
01:11:01,684 --> 01:11:03,973
You know, sometimes when I'm with you,

1294
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:07,281
I feel so good about myself, you know?

1295
01:11:07,281 --> 01:11:10,900
Like I could really do something with my life.

1296
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,870
I could open a store, you know?

1297
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:18,870
And sell clothes, these really beautiful clothes.

1298
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,841
I'd get married.

1299
01:11:20,841 --> 01:11:22,580
Have kids.

1300
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:23,413
Sounds good.

1301
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,599
Maybe I could even go with you to Texas.

1302
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:31,140
I know, I know, things are complicated,

1303
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,683
but I want to be with you.

1304
01:11:34,908 --> 01:11:37,023
I mean, I want to do things with you.

1305
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:39,613
For you.

1306
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:44,070
You want me to do something for you?

1307
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:46,983
Something special.

1308
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:00,525
(birds chirping)

1309
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,275
(engine running)

1310
01:12:14,248 --> 01:12:17,199
(door slams)

1311
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,770
Where were you? I've been calling.

1312
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,663
With friends like you told me.

1313
01:12:23,045 --> 01:12:24,650
I bet I know who.

1314
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:26,000
Yeah, and where were you?

1315
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:29,278
At home with my kids.

1316
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:30,163
And your wife?

1317
01:12:36,309 --> 01:12:38,630
How could you let this guy come between us?

1318
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:40,214
He cares about me.

1319
01:12:40,214 --> 01:12:41,120
What, and I don't?

1320
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,730
You're the one that's cutting me off, Amy.

1321
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:46,373
Because, I don't know what our future is.

1322
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,433
Baby, it's whatever you want it to be.

1323
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:56,003
Yeah. Right.

1324
01:12:58,198 --> 01:13:00,702
(door slams)

1325
01:13:00,702 --> 01:13:03,202
Hey, Joey loves you! Say it!

1326
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:06,036
Say it!

1327
01:13:06,036 --> 01:13:07,147
Joey loves me.

1328
01:13:07,147 --> 01:13:10,085
And we'll always be together.

1329
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:12,472
Are you telling me the truth.

1330
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:14,753
How could I lie to you?

1331
01:13:14,753 --> 01:13:16,654
How could I tell?

1332
01:13:16,654 --> 01:13:19,071
(soft music)

1333
01:13:24,472 --> 01:13:27,389
Is that a lie, is our future lie?

1334
01:13:32,052 --> 01:13:34,719
(keys pounding)

1335
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:40,403
Crystal?

1336
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:42,863
Did he get it?

1337
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,000
Why did you tell them?

1338
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,163
My mom asked me.

1339
01:13:51,163 --> 01:13:55,020
I mean, all I said was we were going on a trip.

1340
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:56,380
So now your dad calls me up

1341
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:57,790
threatening to have me arrested

1342
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:59,821
if I take you out of the state.

1343
01:13:59,821 --> 01:14:01,193
Amy?

1344
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,640
I was mad all right.

1345
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:08,640
I wanted to get out of there to be with you, was all I said

1346
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:13,680
and that we might move to...

1347
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,680
Texas, yeah.

1348
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,290
Well, what's wrong with that?

1349
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:19,140
You mean besides it not being true?

1350
01:14:21,502 --> 01:14:22,669
It could be.

1351
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:28,830
And anyway, who are you to talk about truth?

1352
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,520
Things are complicated.

1353
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,390
You know who you're starting to sound like?

1354
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:34,660
Because I won't make you phony promises,

1355
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:37,510
because I won't pretend things are different than they are?

1356
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:39,660
I'm not the one telling lies about my life.

1357
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,613
I don't lie.

1358
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,480
Amy, you lie to everybody, me, your parents

1359
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,170
and especially yourself

1360
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,870
and don't bother denying it again,

1361
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:51,570
because it'll be just another lie.

1362
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:59,130
I didn't used to be this way.

1363
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,514
Get away from him.

1364
01:15:00,514 --> 01:15:01,347
How?

1365
01:15:01,347 --> 01:15:02,180
Just do it.

1366
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:05,077
And then will you be with me?

1367
01:15:05,077 --> 01:15:07,260
You can't keep living your life like this.

1368
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,373
Will you be with me?

1369
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:16,983
See you preach about honesty and you say you love me,

1370
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,660
but you're no different,

1371
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:24,660
with your things are complicated and your videotapes.

1372
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:27,180
You wait a minute.

1373
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,841
I am no Joey.

1374
01:15:28,841 --> 01:15:29,853
So prove it.

1375
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,323
Please help me, I need you.

1376
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,070
I want to believe what you say,

1377
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,670
that my life could be different.

1378
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,653
I want to have the courage to make my life different.

1379
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:52,003
Please Paul, I need you, just help me,

1380
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:54,973
just love me.

1381
01:15:56,016 --> 01:15:58,433
(soft music)

1382
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,623
Those things I said, Paul, I didn't mean them.

1383
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:12,470
I know you're not like that.

1384
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,513
I know you care,

1385
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:22,540
but still I wonder what would have happened

1386
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,093
if life wasn't complicated.

1387
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,950
If we could have been together.

1388
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:32,853
You were my last hope.

1389
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:36,780
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

1390
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:37,613
Yeah?

1391
01:16:37,613 --> 01:16:38,446
Yeah.

1392
01:16:38,446 --> 01:16:40,120
All right. So when?

1393
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,230
Soon, okay.

1394
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:42,530
I still got to get the gun.

1395
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:44,370
So how long would that take?

1396
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,680
Money talks.

1397
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,559
Sure.

1398
01:16:46,559 --> 01:16:49,340
Yeah, yeah, I got money, how much?

1399
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,880
Eight hundred aught to do it.

1400
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,713
Eight hundred.

1401
01:16:51,713 --> 01:16:53,320
(money rustling)

1402
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,479
Eight.

1403
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:55,312
Right.

1404
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:00,820
Okay, now how long will it take?

1405
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,809
A few days I'll beep you

1406
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,235
and don't forget, steal some plates.

1407
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:08,652
(soft music)

1408
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:20,663
Nobody touches like you do.

1409
01:17:23,029 --> 01:17:25,027
You remember that, all right.

1410
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,730
How could I forget.

1411
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,983
That's when I told him.

1412
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,513
He's denying all this too.

1413
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:40,707
But I remember when I said to him,

1414
01:17:40,707 --> 01:17:42,350
"I got a surprise for you".

1415
01:17:43,564 --> 01:17:44,880
And he said, "What"?

1416
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,197
And I went, "Bang".

1417
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,980
And at first he didn't know what I was talking about.

1418
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,250
He thought I was just kidding.

1419
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:57,747
But then when he knew I was serious, he said,

1420
01:17:57,747 --> 01:17:59,916
"You would do that for me"?

1421
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:04,253
And when I told him, I wasn't sure if I could,

1422
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:09,610
I remember he took my hand in his hands

1423
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:13,747
and he looked into my eyes and he said,

1424
01:18:13,747 --> 01:18:18,747
"I care about you, I want you to be safe.

1425
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:23,507
Are you sure you're strong enough to do this"?

1426
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:29,282
And I figured, Joey wouldn't let anything happen to me.

1427
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,973
I didn't think about life and death.

1428
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,670
I didn't think about anything.

1429
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:44,410
Featured like him.

1430
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:46,110
I came with friends, possessed,

1431
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:49,180
desiring this man's art and that man's scope.

1432
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:51,559
It's what I most enjoy, content at, least.

1433
01:18:51,559 --> 01:18:54,227
(pager beeping)

1434
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,223
I got to make a phone call.

1435
01:18:58,223 --> 01:18:59,202
It's important.

1436
01:19:00,108 --> 01:19:01,100
Can't it wait?

1437
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:01,933
No.

1438
01:19:04,547 --> 01:19:05,778
Got it.

1439
01:19:05,778 --> 01:19:08,890
(pager beeping)

1440
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:10,513
Hold on, okay, hold on.

1441
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,223
Joey.

1442
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:24,973
I can't talk now I'll call you later.

1443
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:27,643
I love you.

1444
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,040
Hi.

1445
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,483
Okay listen, meet me at my house at 11 o'clock.

1446
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:38,648
(soft music)

1447
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,240
Mary Jo.

1448
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,440
Hi.

1449
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,530
Chairs are looking good.

1450
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,363
Thank you.

1451
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:47,960
Hey, How's Joey, I haven't seen him lately?

1452
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,418
Good, good. Working hard.

1453
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:50,251
Good.

1454
01:19:50,251 --> 01:19:51,084
(phone rings)

1455
01:19:51,084 --> 01:19:51,916
Excuse me.

1456
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:02,150
But you said it yourself.

1457
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:03,410
It's no big deal, right?

1458
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:04,900
Yeah that's right, no big deal.

1459
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,753
No big deal, so you do it.

1460
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,733
(heavy breathing)

1461
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:16,350
What if she attacks me or something?

1462
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:21,350
You just, that's why you got this, right?

1463
01:20:23,841 --> 01:20:25,424
Safety's off, okay.

1464
01:20:26,526 --> 01:20:27,359
Okay.

1465
01:20:28,939 --> 01:20:31,420
There you go, all right.

1466
01:20:32,276 --> 01:20:33,609
Put it in there.

1467
01:20:35,294 --> 01:20:38,000
Snap, snap.

1468
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,616
She comes at you.

1469
01:20:39,616 --> 01:20:41,040
You just aim and shoot.

1470
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:41,993
Bang, bang.

1471
01:20:45,518 --> 01:20:46,351
Okay.

1472
01:20:49,304 --> 01:20:50,471
Go on take it.

1473
01:20:57,161 --> 01:20:59,911
(dramatic music)

1474
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:06,231
(doorbell rings)

1475
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:18,933
Can I help you?

1476
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:24,740
Yeah, are you Mrs. Joseph Buttafuoco?

1477
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:25,573
Yeah.

1478
01:21:27,504 --> 01:21:30,490
I want to talk to you about your husband, Joey.

1479
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:31,490
What's this about?

1480
01:21:33,954 --> 01:21:36,995
(nervous laugh)

1481
01:21:36,995 --> 01:21:41,920
Well, it's not every day I confront a wife you know.

1482
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,933
What about Joey?

1483
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:50,023
He's having an affair with my little 16 year old sister.

1484
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:53,563
Really?

1485
01:21:58,620 --> 01:21:59,570
What's your name?

1486
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,630
Ann Baker.

1487
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:06,240
Where do you live, Ann?

1488
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,210
Over in Bahava.

1489
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:10,110
Honey, Bahava is that way.

1490
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:12,950
What's going on? Where do you really live?

1491
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:13,782
Dolphin Coy.

1492
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:20,083
Who's that?

1493
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,073
My boyfriend?

1494
01:22:23,921 --> 01:22:25,390
What are you trying to pull here?

1495
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:27,540
Look, I I'm telling you,

1496
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:30,138
your husband is having an affair with my little sister.

1497
01:22:30,138 --> 01:22:33,690
And I just think the idea of a 40 year old man

1498
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:36,230
sleeping with a 16 year old girl is disgusting.

1499
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:38,290
Well, he's not 40 yet.

1500
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:39,163
Let me see this.

1501
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,110
It's not even Joey's size.

1502
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:44,943
I'm telling you.

1503
01:22:44,943 --> 01:22:46,870
Who are you really, Bobrick Zoe's daughter?

1504
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:48,530
No.

1505
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:49,770
He gave her that shirt.

1506
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,460
Joey gives these shirts to lots of people,

1507
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:52,610
doesn't prove anything.

1508
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,600
I am telling you the truth.

1509
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,103
Okay. When does she see him?

1510
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,646
Where?

1511
01:23:00,646 --> 01:23:03,729
(confused muttering)

1512
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,633
See, you don't even know, you lying little bitch.

1513
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:16,230
You don't even want to know.

1514
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:18,230
Oh, I know my husband.

1515
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:19,980
He wouldn't do something like this.

1516
01:23:20,836 --> 01:23:24,730
You, know Joey, what scum he is.

1517
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:29,553
Get outta here.

1518
01:23:29,553 --> 01:23:31,680
I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna call Joey.

1519
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,693
Now you get the hell off my property!

1520
01:23:34,693 --> 01:23:35,860
Now!

1521
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:38,610
(dramatic music)

1522
01:23:41,714 --> 01:23:43,679
(loud gun shot)

1523
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,971
(terrified screaming)

1524
01:23:45,971 --> 01:23:48,721
(dramatic music)

1525
01:23:58,425 --> 01:23:59,258
(gate bangs)

1526
01:23:59,258 --> 01:24:01,382
The gun, the gun, get the gun.

1527
01:24:01,382 --> 01:24:04,132
(dramatic music)

1528
01:24:08,696 --> 01:24:10,313
C'mon, c'mon.

1529
01:24:10,313 --> 01:24:13,063
(dramatic music)

1530
01:24:18,593 --> 01:24:21,152
(tyre's screeching)

1531
01:24:21,152 --> 01:24:23,902
(dramatic music)

1532
01:24:30,377 --> 01:24:31,377
Oh my God.

1533
01:24:32,573 --> 01:24:33,740
I'll call 911.

1534
01:24:37,254 --> 01:24:41,160
Mary Jo, Mary Jo, you're going to be all right.

1535
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,568
Amy, give me the gun.

1536
01:24:42,568 --> 01:24:44,110
Give me the gun.

1537
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:46,094
What happened to it, where's the rest of it?

1538
01:24:46,094 --> 01:24:47,540
It's pulled apart man.

1539
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:48,830
Take it easy Amy.

1540
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:50,260
Oh man, she went down.

1541
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,093
Amy, you dropped...

1542
01:24:51,093 --> 01:24:52,500
She went down, man.

1543
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,040
Amy, you all right?

1544
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,327
Darren's gonna take you home, Amy.

1545
01:24:57,327 --> 01:24:59,090
(phone rings)

1546
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:00,220
Tides Auto Body.

1547
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:07,616
(sirens whaling)

1548
01:25:08,943 --> 01:25:11,611
(crowd talking)

1549
01:25:20,909 --> 01:25:24,659
(helicopter blades churning)

1550
01:25:46,402 --> 01:25:48,235
Easy now, easy easy.

1551
01:25:51,002 --> 01:25:53,835
(engines running)

1552
01:25:56,794 --> 01:25:57,627
Joey.

1553
01:26:02,472 --> 01:26:04,199
What, what's going on?

1554
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:05,545
What happened?

1555
01:26:05,545 --> 01:26:06,378
Mary Jo.

1556
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:13,829
Joey.

1557
01:26:13,829 --> 01:26:16,252
(helicopter blades churning)

1558
01:26:16,252 --> 01:26:17,669
Mary Jo, Mary Jo.

1559
01:26:51,657 --> 01:26:54,241
(door closing)

1560
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,163
(somber music)

1561
01:27:08,872 --> 01:27:10,539
Crystal, I did it.

1562
01:27:14,659 --> 01:27:17,326
(water pouring)

1563
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:29,973
Amy.

1564
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:33,993
There's blood.

1565
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:37,723
Everywhere.

1566
01:27:42,418 --> 01:27:44,251
Where'd you shoot her?

1567
01:27:48,342 --> 01:27:49,342
Is she dead?

1568
01:27:52,065 --> 01:27:52,898
Oh God.

1569
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:56,610
Lie down. Come on.

1570
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:03,593
My dad's gonna kill me.

1571
01:28:05,048 --> 01:28:06,180
I gotta call Paul.

1572
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:10,720
No, you don't talk to nobody.

1573
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,813
Nobody. All right?

1574
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,020
You shot her in the head.

1575
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,853
She'll die.

1576
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:18,330
You just gotta wait, you know,

1577
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:21,053
you gotta stay calm and act normal.

1578
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:27,883
Just close your eyes.

1579
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:32,880
Close your eyes and sleep.

1580
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,930
Just pretended it's a dream, a bad dream.

1581
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:42,803
But when I woke up, it was real.

1582
01:28:45,809 --> 01:28:50,309
And now, even if I get out on bail,

1583
01:28:52,553 --> 01:28:54,723
I'm gonna be in a place like this,

1584
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:59,286
maybe for the rest of my life.

1585
01:28:59,286 --> 01:29:01,830
(camera's clicking)

1586
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:04,380
While Joey's walking around free telling everybody,

1587
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:09,368
Amy Fisher, well, yeah, I had pizza with her once.

1588
01:29:09,368 --> 01:29:11,760
The bottom line is, I never touched her.

1589
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,593
Never.

1590
01:29:12,593 --> 01:29:13,425
That's not what she claims.

1591
01:29:13,425 --> 01:29:14,793
That's the end of the story.

1592
01:29:14,793 --> 01:29:16,280
(reporters shouting)

1593
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,530
Excuse me. I have to go take care of my wife.

1594
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:21,489
How is your wife Mr. Buttafuoco?

1595
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:22,322
We'd like to know.

1596
01:29:22,322 --> 01:29:23,540
How do you think she is?

1597
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:25,390
She was shot in the head.

1598
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:26,873
If he's telling the truth,

1599
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:30,593
if he never touched me,

1600
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:35,773
then how come I passed the lie detector test?

1601
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:41,980
How come I know he's got two black moles

1602
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,573
on the inside of his thigh.

1603
01:29:48,844 --> 01:29:49,677
Oh God.

1604
01:29:51,353 --> 01:29:52,947
Why did I shoot her?

1605
01:29:54,415 --> 01:29:56,832
(soft music)

1606
01:29:58,334 --> 01:30:00,080
I didn't want to,

1607
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:00,973
I didn't mean to.

1608
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:04,720
When I was standing on that porch

1609
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,083
and I saw her eyes.

1610
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:09,943
She wasn't just this obstacle to Joey anymore.

1611
01:30:11,559 --> 01:30:16,263
She was human, but she wouldn't listen.

1612
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,753
She dismissed me.

1613
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:24,943
I was so mad and the gun was in my hand.

1614
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,883
And now we're both victims.

1615
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:35,723
I'm sorry.

1616
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:42,913
So sorry for all the pain I caused.

1617
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:53,720
Joey, Joey, he's the worst thing that ever happened to me.

1618
01:31:01,178 --> 01:31:03,595
You know, what's really sick.

1619
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:07,637
I think I still love him.

1620
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,559
Mary Jo Buttafuoco survived,

1621
01:31:12,559 --> 01:31:14,440
but is permanently disabled.

1622
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,150
Joey Buttafuoco continues to insist that his relationship

1623
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:19,640
with Amy Fisher was casual and innocent.

1624
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,990
He denies it was sexual or that he played any part

1625
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:24,730
in Amy's prostitution or in planning and carrying out

1626
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:26,240
her crime.

1627
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,130
The district attorney has declined to file charges

1628
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:29,660
against him.

1629
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:32,110
While out on bail, Amy Fisher met with Paul Makely

1630
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:33,460
in his office.

1631
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:36,530
She was videotaped there without her knowledge or consent.

1632
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:39,740
The video tape later appeared on a tabloid television show.

1633
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:42,740
No one knows how the program obtained the tape.

1634
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:45,300
Amy Fisher pled guilty to reckless assault,

1635
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,530
was sentenced to five to 15 years

1636
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:49,900
and is serving her time at a correctional facility

1637
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,943
in New York state.

1638
01:31:56,196 --> 01:31:58,613
