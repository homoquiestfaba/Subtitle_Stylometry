1
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,569
Good. Thank you.
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:13,338
Right.

3
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,554
They're gonna be here
in 10, okay?

4
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:30,556
So, be ready.

5
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:35,193
Don't screw up.

6
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:36,561
Of course not, boss.

7
00:01:36,594 --> 00:01:37,530
Go.

8
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:06,259
That's a big box.

9
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:17,169
Tiny tykes measured in
at well over 100 inches,

10
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,504
and I'd say 900 pounds each,
wouldn't you, Russ?

11
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:22,241
A hundred pounds
of beak and claws,

12
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:25,544
and the mangiest feathers you ever
laid your beautiful brown eyes on.

13
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:28,813
The male is a bit bigger
than the female

14
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:30,850
and a hell
of a lot more pissed off.

15
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:52,938
What's the matter?
You afraid of a big bird?

16
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:59,541
Harvey, maybe we should
rethink releasing

17
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,846
them in the aviary this quickly.

18
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,250
-Doing...
-Stop. Stop. Stop.

19
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:05,850
I did not hire you for advice.

20
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:08,920
I hired you
to be my bird watcher, okay?

21
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,256
Unacceptable.

22
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:21,366
Do you think
this is wise?

23
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,336
They could hurt themselves
in there.

24
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:24,870
Better than hurting us out here.

25
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:25,770
They will be fine.

26
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,606
All we need to do
is an initial check,

27
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,509
make sure my babies weren't
harmed in their voyage.

28
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,980
Do you realize what today is?

29
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,213
Do you realize?

30
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:38,950
Today is the day that the past
has collided with the future

31
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:42,021
in the pursuit of knowledge
that no one else has.

32
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,356
No one. Only us.

33
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:45,490
And you know
what that makes you?

34
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:46,891
What?

35
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:48,828
It makes you pioneers.

36
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,531
Like Lewis and Clark,
or Darwin, or Copernicus.

37
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:54,866
Now, there's a man

38
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,271
who changed the view of where we
stand in this universe today.

39
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:00,539
Right, Russ?

40
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:03,608
What he said.

41
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:13,885
Are they down?

42
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,655
Shut up, you idiot!

43
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,657
Hey!

44
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:23,295
You bastards awake?

45
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,798
All right, why don't you go join them?
Go join them.

46
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:26,766
Go. Go.

47
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:33,772
Yeah, okay.

48
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:36,341
Okay, I think we're good.

49
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,679
Open it up.

50
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,315
Are you sure about this?

51
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:45,084
What? Do you think
they're faking it?

52
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,552
They're freaking birds,
for Pete's sake.

53
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:50,855
There's a reason people coined
the term "bird brain."

54
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,658
Not much up there.

55
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,661
Maybe you should get in
the car just in case.

56
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:56,729
I think you're right.

57
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:01,834
How we doing?

58
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,336
We're good, boss.

59
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,872
All right, let's do this.

60
00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:48,880
I think we're good.

61
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:53,386
Okay, let's drag
those bastards out of there.

62
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:56,656
Time for the good doctor to see
how Heckle and Jeckle are doing.

63
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:08,800
Okay, that's weird.

64
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,536
Hey, I hope
you didn't kill this...

65
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:12,838
one.

66
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,879
I'm gonna get in the car, too.

67
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:24,384
Get out of the way! Move it!
Don't shoot the bird!

68
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,829
Another weekend
with Mother Nature?

69
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:44,797
Yeah.

70
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,834
What you going in for this time?

71
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,603
Birdwatching.

72
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:56,042
I'm hoping I can find
a Falconidae caracara.

73
00:07:58,709 --> 00:07:59,978
Falconacara what?

74
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,215
A Mexican eagle.

75
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,851
Another watcher spotted a nest
about four miles north of here.

76
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:09,754
What the hell is a Mexican eagle
nesting up in these parts anyhow?

77
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:13,759
They've been living in these
regions for hundreds of years.

78
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:17,195
No wonder San Antone
lost the Alamo?

79
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,664
Done planted a bunch of
spies up in the sky.

80
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:20,866
Yeah.

81
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:25,004
That cover it?

82
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:31,276
-Okay, you have a good weekend.
-Yeah.

83
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,115
You go out and find yourself
a big bird now.

84
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,149
Will do.

85
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,769
Come on, Dad. Pick up.

86
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:06,337
Hello, this is Keith Stern.

87
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,905
Sorry I can't come
to the phone right now.

88
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:09,207
But if you could
please leave a message,

89
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,708
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

90
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:11,743
Have a great day.

91
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,213
Hey, Dad, it's me,
your loving daughter.

92
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:16,481
I was just thinking about you.

93
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:18,683
I know you're probably on one
of your crazy bird adventures,

94
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:20,284
but give me a call.

95
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,353
It would have been
Mom's birthday next week,

96
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:24,756
so I'd like to do
something special.

97
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:26,024
Call me. I love you.

98
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,346
Look at that?
It's a thing of beauty.

99
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,951
So, Slater, she still
over at the compound?

100
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,420
-She only popped in for lunch.
-All right.

101
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,422
Speaking of lunch,

102
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,990
when's the next feeding?

103
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:47,091
Should be dropping in
any minute now.

104
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,543
What the hell kind of birds
are they feeding out here?

105
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,346
Hey.

106
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:43,883
How we doing?

107
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:46,617
-Any luck?
-Nope.

108
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,053
We'll have to start over.

109
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:51,523
What? What the hell
is going on?

110
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:54,026
I mean, this is the finest
incubation equipment on the market.

111
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:55,026
It's not the equipment.

112
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,628
Two of the eggs
had microbial contaminations.

113
00:14:57,662 --> 00:14:58,964
Same as the last.

114
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:00,665
How can this be possible?

115
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:06,571
All it takes is one bad egg
to spoil the entire litter.

116
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:09,574
What's causing the
contamination this time?

117
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:11,677
-I think it's the soil.
-The soil?

118
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,546
By the time your men
are finding those litters,

119
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:17,548
primitive bacteria has
already contaminated them.

120
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:19,384
I mean, as you're aware,

121
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,286
those birds thrived...

122
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:24,021
They thrived in regions
this far north.

123
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:27,959
Soil now is different than it was
two and a half million years ago.

124
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,262
I think you would probably
have had better luck

125
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:33,966
trying to breed them on one of the
islands where you found them.

126
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,067
Well, that's not
gonna happen, is it?

127
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,504
You know, I hired you because you're
the best at what you do, right?

128
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:42,206
So if there's something to be
done with the soil, please do it,

129
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,442
because it's been
six months, okay?

130
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:46,711
Fix it! Fix it!

131
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:51,549
Well, unless your men are planning
to catch that hen's next litter

132
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:54,519
as it comes falling
from her rear,

133
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:58,557
I really don't see how you expect
me to make this happen overnight!

134
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,359
And I need more time.

135
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,094
Fine. Do it.

136
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:19,010
What the hell is that?

137
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:22,080
Gonna do me some fishing later.

138
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:23,181
Fishing?

139
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:24,483
Yes, sir.

140
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:26,517
Light one of those babies,
toss it in,

141
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:29,554
all the fish come bubbling up
to the surface. Easy as pie.

142
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:30,755
Here's your money.

143
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,994
Next time you come around, you leave
that stuff at home. You got it?

144
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:38,562
What is this?
It looks like someone's pet.

145
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:41,466
Looks like it's not your day,
Old Yeller?

146
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,070
You're bird food,
you mangy mutt.

147
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,274
Help!

148
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:50,542
Go! Go!

149
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:54,778
Help!

150
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:58,316
-Get to the gate!
-Where is it? I don't see it!

151
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,719
Get to the gate!
Keep going!

152
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:03,488
Don't touch the fence!
It's electrified!

153
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:06,191
Please!

154
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,358
-Quick!
-Get back!

155
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:08,393
-Let me out!
-I'm trying!

156
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,394
Let me do it!

157
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:10,594
What's the new combo?

158
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:12,597
Come on!
Get me out of here!

159
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:18,069
Let me out of here!

160
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,671
-Where's your gun?
-It's on the car.

161
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:21,740
Go get it!

162
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,130
-Hey, who are you calling?
-My dad.

163
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:46,865
He's going birdwatching
again this weekend.

164
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:49,634
Trying to get some prize photo for
this nature competition he entered.

165
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,169
Nature competition? Yeesh.

166
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:54,239
Thought I'd catch him before
he left the cabin, though.

167
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:57,541
Dude, your dad
seriously needs a girlfriend.

168
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,376
He loves his independence.

169
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,680
Nut doesn't fall
far from the tree.

170
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,717
How the hell
did neither of you see

171
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,653
that some schmuck got
into the aviary?

172
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:12,389
And how did you not see him get past
the compound fence in the first place?

173
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:14,526
We never saw him
on the feeds.

174
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,194
And I don't know how the hell
he got past the voltage fence,

175
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,564
but the main fence
anyone can hop right over.

176
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:22,334
Must have got in on the east
side, down by the river.

177
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:23,634
The birds never go there.

178
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,870
It's covered in trees.
I bet he went up over.

179
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:28,606
Yeah, you know, the birds mostly
stick to the western region anyhow.

180
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,876
That's where they've been
hunting these mutts. -Who cares?

181
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,445
He's in.
He clearly got through.

182
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:35,279
Now, we have a dead man
on our hands,

183
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:36,615
and what are we supposed
to do with this?

184
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:38,516
How are we supposed
to deal with this?

185
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:39,717
Could find his car.

186
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,485
Stage a crash somewhere.

187
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,887
That's a great idea.

188
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,757
Yeah, maybe we can just prop up
his half-eaten skeleton

189
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,558
and put it in the driver's seat.

190
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:48,894
What do you want us to do?

191
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,695
Shut up so I can think!

192
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:54,398
What's there to think about,
Harvey?

193
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,402
The jig is up.

194
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,538
Another man is dead.

195
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,674
And I doubt he's some ex-con no one
cares about like the last one.

196
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,310
Have you lost your mind?

197
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,579
They'll shut us down.
They'll take away my birds,

198
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:09,413
and god knows
what they'll do with them.

199
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:12,216
No, I found those birds on
my expedition. They're mine.

200
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,684
And they're dangerous.

201
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:15,586
Harvey, they're dangerous.

202
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:17,688
Why do we have to tell
the authorities anything?

203
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,192
They already think
this is a cat ranch.

204
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:22,459
We just tell them the man got mauled
by a big Bengal or something.

205
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:23,794
No, no, no. No, no, no, no no.

206
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:27,199
No, the rules change when an
animal kills a human being, okay?

207
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:30,268
Having a permit and a promise
to put them down is not enough.

208
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,269
They're gonna come
do an investigation.

209
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:33,772
They're gonna wanna
see the animal.

210
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,974
No, we say nothing to anyone.

211
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,542
-Got it?
-What?

212
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,577
Are you kidding?

213
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,613
That man could be married.

214
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:43,447
He could have a family.

215
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,784
He could have children.

216
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:49,820
You just can't dictate someone's
death like that, Harvey.

217
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:51,722
The man is a trespasser.

218
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:54,392
Think of the birds for a second, okay?
Think of the birds.

219
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:56,661
Think of what would happen if
those birds get into the hands

220
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:58,262
of this corrupt government.

221
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:02,467
Come on. We are this
close to hatching them.

222
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,271
Now, don't you think we at least
owe it to a dying species

223
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:08,807
to at least try?

224
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,308
This isn't
about the birds, Harvey.

225
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:15,447
It's never been
about the birds.

226
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,817
And your big,
archaeological expedition?

227
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:22,386
Just another notch
on an endless ego belt.

228
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,756
We all know
you're a money man, Harvey.

229
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:27,525
And when you hatch
an entire flock,

230
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:29,326
you'll do what you do best.

231
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,462
You'll take all the credit,

232
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,964
and you'll sell them

233
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:34,967
to the highest bidder.

234
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:39,503
Hey!

235
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,974
You don't walk out that door,

236
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:47,613
because you work for me,
and you do what I say.

237
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,482
Screw you, Sullivan.

238
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:53,618
I quit.

239
00:20:58,556 --> 00:20:59,790
Let go. Come on.

240
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:01,393
Just... Just tell him
to let me go.

241
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,963
I gave you everything
that you wanted.

242
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,565
I gave you a house
in the Hamptons.

243
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:09,800
I gave you everything
that you asked for.

244
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,011
Well...

245
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:23,782
why don't you go get Dr. Slater's
car for her so she can leave?

246
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:49,007
Where's my car, Dale?

247
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,408
It's just down the drive there.

248
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:53,611
My keys.

249
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:58,517
Dale, don't do this.
Don't do this, Dale.

250
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,353
My things are ready.

251
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:04,955
Please have them picked up
in the morning.

252
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,692
I hate to see you go, Doc.

253
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:09,661
Me too.

254
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:45,896
Come on.

255
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:52,703
Come on. Come on.

256
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:01,145
Da...

257
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:06,550
Come on. Come on!

258
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:12,057
Dale!

259
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:41,886
All right, tranq 'em
and put 'em back in.

260
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:47,858
Hi, this is Keith Stern.
Pick up.

261
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:49,227
Sorry I can't come
to the phone right now.

262
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:50,494
But if you could
please leave a message,

263
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,131
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Have a great day.

264
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,936
Hey, here's
a little percolated roast

265
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,839
to perk up
my fave roomie's afternoon.

266
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,674
Thanks.

267
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:08,546
Hey, no word
from your pops yet?

268
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:10,615
You know what?
It's probably okay.

269
00:24:10,647 --> 00:24:12,583
He's probably climbing
some mountain,

270
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:15,086
finding some bald eagle's
nest or something.

271
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:16,319
You know, it's gonna be okay.

272
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:19,624
It's Friday. He said he'd be
back Tuesday at the latest.

273
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:21,091
Yikes.

274
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,964
Well, what are you gonna do?

275
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:26,932
I...

276
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,067
am gonna look for him.

277
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:35,006
Have you thought about
maybe calling the police first?

278
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:38,209
Well, my dad keeps
a GPS tracker on him

279
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,777
whenever he goes
out into the wild.

280
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:42,547
My mom bought it
for his birthday two years ago

281
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:44,883
and made him promise
to always keep it in his gear.

282
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:47,217
The receiver is
at the cabin in the woods,

283
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,488
so I'm gonna start there.

284
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:53,790
Maddy, you can't traipse the backwoods
by yourself. That's insane.

285
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:57,062
Paige, I'm going.
End of story.

286
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:00,163
Fine, I'm coming with you.

287
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:01,664
Paige, you don't have to come.

288
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:04,903
No, you're crazy if you think I'm
letting you go out there by yourself.

289
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:09,107
Justin? Hey, it's Paige.

290
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,777
So, Maddy kind of needs a favor.

291
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,581
Yeah, you know that big,
bohunk friend of yours,

292
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:19,250
the one that's
into all the outdoorsy stuff?

293
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:20,817
Brett, yes!

294
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,088
So, we could
really use his help.

295
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:26,357
Maddy's dad is missing.

296
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,961
He went camping, and no one has
seen him since last week, so...

297
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:33,765
Really? Could you?
That would...

298
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,267
That would be amazing.

299
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,136
Of course you can come.

300
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,338
Maddy would really like that.

301
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:41,806
Yeah, we're packing right now.

302
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:43,040
I'll text you.

303
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,109
Thank you so much.

304
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,582
So, what makes you think
Maddy would like that?

305
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:53,116
'Cause Maddy does not.

306
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,919
Are we talking
about the same Maddie here?

307
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:57,355
'Cause the one I'm referring to
used to be totally in love

308
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:59,957
with her inseparable
best friend, Justin.

309
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:03,861
Yeah,
before he got a girlfriend.

310
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:06,698
Okay, how many times
do I have to repeat myself?

311
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:11,201
The guy obviously
started dating that sorostitute

312
00:26:11,234 --> 00:26:13,670
in the first place
to make you jealous, okay?

313
00:26:13,703 --> 00:26:16,807
-You're the one who went AWOL on him.
-Paige!

314
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,976
I'm stressed out enough
about my dad as it is.

315
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:20,278
I don't need any more
added anxiety, all right?

316
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:23,914
Now, just call him back and tell
him not to come, all right?

317
00:26:25,215 --> 00:26:26,950
Maddy...

318
00:26:26,983 --> 00:26:29,252
will it or will it not help us

319
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:33,057
to have an experienced hiker on
the trail help us look for him?

320
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:37,227
Okay, you said it yourself how
crazy-far your dad is willing to trek

321
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,231
in order to take some snapshots
of some strange species.

322
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,738
Okay, give me five to pack.

323
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,658
Looks like you bought yourself
a little time, my friends.

324
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:10,827
Chef has pulled the canine
cuisine from the menu.

325
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:15,166
The birds had themselves a nice,
little Slater soufflé last night.

326
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,002
Just get 'em out, Dale.

327
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:23,707
Hey, guys.

328
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,249
He did not bring
that slutosaurus.

329
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,019
Hey, are you okay?

330
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,856
Thanks, you guys, but you
really didn't have to do this.

331
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,860
Are you kidding? I would have been
pissed if you hadn't called me.

332
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:45,797
Anyway, besides...
it's the weekend, right?

333
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,831
We didn't have
anything better to do anyway.

334
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:50,268
Yeah, nothing better. Nope.

335
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:55,939
Look, it would have been the
same old beer pong and keggers.

336
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:59,911
My liver... could use a break
and a little fresh air.

337
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:00,944
Hop in.

338
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,916
Thanks, Rough and Tumble.

339
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,384
Taylor, so great to see you,

340
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:08,452
but you really
didn't have to come.

341
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:12,957
Two desperate girls
in the wild with my boyfriend?

342
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,791
Yes, I did.

343
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:15,960
Yikes.

344
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,432
Sorry. Window seats
give me the regurg.

345
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:24,034
I'm gonna need to sit bitch.

346
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:25,068
Fittingly.

347
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:27,439
All right, let's do this.

348
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:09,080
Fill her up, man.

349
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,383
I'll tell you what.

350
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:14,351
How about I put $4.50 in there

351
00:29:14,384 --> 00:29:16,488
and take the rest
for you trying to punk me?

352
00:29:21,157 --> 00:29:22,159
Turd.

353
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,935
My god.

354
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,236
Hi, excuse me.

355
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:08,472
Excuse me.

356
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:15,346
Hi. Yeah, where's
your nearest ladies' room?

357
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:35,599
Never again, Justin.

358
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:42,440
Excuse me.

359
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:44,541
Could you tell me?

360
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:46,576
My dad, he comes
through here all the time.

361
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:47,443
I don't know if you know him.

362
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,180
He, drives
this dirty, old jeep.

363
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:51,581
He's got a cabin
down by the river bend.

364
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:53,852
Yeah. Yeah.

365
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,187
He was just through here
last week.

366
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,623
Going out to find him
some kind of crazy bird.

367
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:02,893
Mexican barracuda or something.

368
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:04,361
But he hasn't come back through?

369
00:31:05,362 --> 00:31:06,531
I ain't seen him.

370
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:09,534
He doesn't always stop
passing back neither.

371
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:13,203
-All right, thank you very much.
-Yeah.

372
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:28,385
-Hi.
-I'd like to pass please.

373
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:32,056
What's the magic word?

374
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:34,925
You wanna play?

375
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:38,663
Okay, well...

376
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:41,031
seeing that
we're all alone in here,

377
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:46,070
I'm gonna guess
the password is...

378
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,210
Lay a finger on me,
and I will kill you.

379
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,280
Get out of my way.

380
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:05,622
Hey, are you okay?

381
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:07,124
No, Justin,

382
00:32:07,157 --> 00:32:10,427
and I won't be until I get a freaking
bar of service on my cell phone.

383
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,596
Gosh!

384
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:25,575
Did you hear those kids?

385
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:30,315
You know exactly who
they were talking about.

386
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:32,683
So, what happened to you?

387
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:51,435
What happened to my little baby?

388
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,705
Let me check that.

389
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:58,009
Russell to Sullivan.

390
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:58,976
You copy?

391
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:04,115
What?

392
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:06,350
We may have a little problemo.

393
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:09,587
The kid of our recent
bird fodder friend

394
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:13,423
is on the prowl with some kids
looking for him. Over.

395
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:14,825
Do they have any leads?

396
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:19,629
Nah, just asking questions to the
store clerk on the county road.

397
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:22,098
He's dumber than nails. Over.

398
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:25,370
Well, people go missing
in the woods all the time.

399
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:27,337
Copy that.

400
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:28,806
We're heading back now.

401
00:33:28,838 --> 00:33:30,673
With my containment equipment.

402
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:33,411
Hood fumes and all, sir.
Over and out.

403
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,426
Do you know
where those kids went?

404
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:51,595
Can't say that I do.

405
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:53,696
I probably wouldn't tell you
if I did.

406
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,266
No.

407
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:59,836
That hot chick left her
cell in the bathroom.

408
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:02,239
I was hoping I could just catch
up with them and give it back.

409
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,745
They went east.
You best hurry.

410
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,592
This is it. Right up here.
Keep going.

411
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:51,121
Well, he definitely
hasn't come back.

412
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,190
That's his jeep.

413
00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:58,528
Where in the world are we?

414
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:15,612
There he is.

415
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:18,214
Why isn't he moving?

416
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:20,117
Perhaps he got bored
and fell asleep.

417
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,155
What? I know I would.

418
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,623
Maddy, he's just birdwatching.

419
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:28,826
I imagine you have to sit pretty still
in order to not spook the birds.

420
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:32,463
About how far out is that?
Any idea?

421
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:36,666
I don't know. It looks like maybe...
seven, eight miles maybe.

422
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:39,202
All right,
that's where we'll start.

423
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:40,770
We're gonna need some maps.

424
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:50,614
Now, just in case he fell,
or got hurt, or something,

425
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:52,349
you got a first aid kit
around here too?

426
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:54,918
Yeah, I think he keeps one
under the bed in the bedroom.

427
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,654
Taylor,
would you grab it please?

428
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:00,858
Hogeye County, that's the one.

429
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:03,360
Right there. Looks about right.

430
00:36:03,393 --> 00:36:04,494
Not bad, soldier.

431
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:06,596
Looks like
pretty rugged territory.

432
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,231
Yeah, the more remote
the better for my dad.

433
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:11,335
He can get closer to birds
that are unaccustomed to people.

434
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:14,304
Hey, check it.

435
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,673
This little blinking light thing
is fading out.

436
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:19,576
No! No, no, no, no!

437
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,213
Please! Please!
Please! Please! Please!

438
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,557
Why are we taking our bags?

439
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,392
Mother Nature
is unpredictable, Tay.

440
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:37,760
-It's always better to be prepared.
-For what?

441
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,829
You know, in case we have
to camp out or something.

442
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,432
Camp?

443
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:44,634
I don't understand why we
don't just call the police.

444
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:47,238
I mean, surely they're better
at handling this type of thing

445
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,773
than a bunch of kids
tramping around in the forest.

446
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:51,307
We report it, and then what?

447
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,377
They sit on it for 48 hours
until they do something?

448
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:55,646
No, thanks.

449
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,249
He's already been gone a week.
I'm not waiting around anymore.

450
00:36:59,715 --> 00:37:01,784
Hey, Tay,

451
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:04,255
just think of it
as camping out overnight

452
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,856
for the newest handbag line
at Nordies.

453
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:10,728
Hey, there's the trail.

454
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:12,697
Hey.

455
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,565
Hey.

456
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,668
Hey, we're gonna find him.

457
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:21,871
Okay, look,
we know his last location,

458
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:25,676
and he's gonna be all shocked when we barge
in there and interrupt his birdwatching.

459
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,043
Okay?

460
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:28,579
Come on.

461
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:29,914
What if he's not there?

462
00:37:32,715 --> 00:37:33,650
Come on.

463
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,608
So, how'd you know
I was into camping anyhow?

464
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:00,610
Get over yourself.

465
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,446
You know
your five-foot friend, Phil?

466
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,583
So, I work with him over
at the West Campus Coffeehouse.

467
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:10,753
He swoons every time he talks about
the way you handle a fishing rod.

468
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:15,326
I mean, no, it's not like I have a
problem with gay dudes or anything.

469
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,360
It's just that
we, like, lived together

470
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:18,628
in the same dorm room
freshman year.

471
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:20,063
I know.

472
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,799
I also know that you sleep nude.

473
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:24,934
-He told you that too?
-Yeah.

474
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:28,739
So...
So Phil digs me?

475
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:31,541
At least as much
as I dig chicks...

476
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:36,612
No, it's nothing like your web browser
history would lead you to believe.

477
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:38,382
So, sorry.

478
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:48,893
So, guys, I think
we should take a minute.

479
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:01,838
So...

480
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:05,342
Why didn't you call me?

481
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:10,146
I don't know. I guess I was just
so worried about my dad that I...

482
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:12,148
No, I don't mean this morning.

483
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:16,419
I mean, like, either of my
calls a few months back.

484
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:19,889
And then every time I text you, I
get this terse, one-word response

485
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:22,925
like, "Yes. No. Sure. Cool."

486
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,861
Like you feel obligated
to humor me or something.

487
00:39:24,894 --> 00:39:28,465
No, it's not that.
It's just I've been busy.

488
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:29,700
With bio labs and stuff?

489
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:31,567
Yeah.

490
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:34,637
That's bull, Maddy,
and you know it.

491
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,509
You're, like, one of
the smartest people I know.

492
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:40,476
In fact,
our entire sophomore year,

493
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,812
you were finishing your papers

494
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:44,013
weeks before I did
when we had class together.

495
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:45,815
Well, yeah, that was before.

496
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:51,522
Before I had classes
for my major,

497
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:53,923
so you don't know how difficult
some of those labs can be.

498
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:55,092
Fine.

499
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:58,561
But I do know
when you're lying.

500
00:39:59,695 --> 00:40:01,597
-Like you're lying now.
-I'm not lying.

501
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,065
You so are.

502
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:04,968
You're making
the exact same face you made

503
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:07,671
the night we double dipped
at the Dobie Theater

504
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:10,974
and then got busted by that
usher with the terrible breath.

505
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:13,510
He was like,
"May I see your ticket?"

506
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:15,211
God!

507
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:17,547
I didn't lie. You did.

508
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,916
Please.

509
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,418
I was too busy laughing
at your reaction, but...

510
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,623
you were a terrible liar then,
and you're a terrible liar now.

511
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:28,491
Maybe if you would have
been a better liar,

512
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:29,960
we wouldn't have gotten
kicked out.

513
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:31,929
My god!

514
00:40:35,264 --> 00:40:37,201
"Sneaking into a second feature

515
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:40,103
"without paying is
a serious..."

516
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:45,476
Dude, like, so is your breath, so...
Ew. -Totally.

517
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:51,882
You know...

518
00:40:53,048 --> 00:40:54,884
I've really missed you
this semester.

519
00:40:57,152 --> 00:41:01,692
So, whatever I did
to make you mad,

520
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:02,759
I'm sorry.

521
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:05,094
Justin, it's not you.
It's just...

522
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,666
Guys, what's so funny?

523
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:10,701
Nothing.

524
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:12,869
Just reminiscing
our sophomore year.

525
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:14,538
Sophomore year.

526
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,906
Okay, that's the year
I was crowned homecoming queen

527
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,143
and became president
of the equestrian team, right?

528
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:21,510
I love that year.

529
00:41:21,543 --> 00:41:24,681
Well, somebody's mood sure has
perked up since this afternoon.

530
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:29,085
Well, this wilderness girl selife I was
trying to post finally went through.

531
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,487
Random?

532
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,956
I think there must be, like, a tower
in the vicinity or something.

533
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:35,025
You guys wanna
take a picture together?

534
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,497
Have fun.

535
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:42,232
What's up with that?

536
00:41:42,264 --> 00:41:45,568
I don't know. I'll take a
picture with you. -Okay.

537
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:48,170
Gosh, we look so good together.
It's, like, ridiculous.

538
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:49,273
Yeah.

539
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:02,853
Where's the bridge?

540
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:04,554
Ain't one.

541
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,023
So, how do we get across?

542
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:09,092
Seriously?

543
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,260
Brett, this is the backwater.

544
00:42:11,293 --> 00:42:13,663
Do the words "gator bait"
mean anything to you?

545
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,666
Contrary to popular belief,

546
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,735
gators don't like to attack
anything they can't swallow.

547
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:23,273
And who told you that, little bitty
baby gator or big, fat papa gator?

548
00:42:23,306 --> 00:42:25,074
You know, Brett,
she does have a point.

549
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:28,144
Taylor doesn't attack anything
she can't swallow either.

550
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:31,248
I mean, that's never stopped
you before, has it, Tay?

551
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,817
A lesbian comic,
what a novelty.

552
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:41,958
My god! My dad's watch!

553
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:45,295
My god! He must have
crossed the river right here.

554
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:46,829
That's why it was
hanging right there.

555
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:52,269
No, I'm sorry, Justin.

556
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:54,237
I cannot cross this water.

557
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:56,373
That's fine, babe.
That's cool.

558
00:42:56,405 --> 00:42:58,741
You can stay here
and wait if you like.

559
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:10,788
You, look away.

560
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:37,815
Ew! something just touched me!
Something...

561
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:40,850
It's got me!

562
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,219
-Just hold on.
-It's got me! Justin, pull!

563
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,956
Justin, what is it?

564
00:43:52,094 --> 00:43:53,696
What was that?

565
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:55,898
It was a branch, Tay.

566
00:43:55,931 --> 00:43:58,901
Your panties got caught
on a big, fat branch.

567
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:00,938
A branch?

568
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:05,409
Okay, well...

569
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,411
Well, I haven't had
my panties pulled on that hard

570
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:10,648
since the back of Tommy Swanson's
pickup truck on prom night.

571
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:01,965
They feel dry enough.

572
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:04,735
Get dressed everyone.
Daylight's a-burning.

573
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,802
Is it weird that
there's stairs here?

574
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:08,337
Maybe somebody owns
a summer house or something.

575
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:10,907
Okay, summer house or not,

576
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,744
I do not wanna be stuck here
in the dark, okay?

577
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,112
How much farther
do we have to go?

578
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,815
Let's go another half mile.

579
00:45:18,847 --> 00:45:20,016
That's where his GPS was.

580
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:21,518
Yeah.

581
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,086
At this point, it might be good
to start calling out his name.

582
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:25,221
See if he can hear us.

583
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,957
Keith.

584
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:27,924
His name is Keith.

585
00:45:29,525 --> 00:45:30,527
Keith!

586
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:31,894
-Keith!
-Dad!

587
00:45:31,927 --> 00:45:33,096
Keith!

588
00:45:33,128 --> 00:45:35,164
-Dad!
-Keith!

589
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,201
Maddy's daddy!

590
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,002
Maddy's daddy!

591
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,439
Maddy's daddy!

592
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:44,908
-Keith!
-Genius!

593
00:45:59,021 --> 00:46:00,958
-We must have taken a wrong turn.
-No.

594
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:03,527
No way.

595
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:04,728
According to the map,

596
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,931
the tracking signal was some
200 yards north of here...

597
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:10,800
which is right through there.

598
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,568
How would he have
gotten in there?

599
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:14,370
Maybe he knows people
who lived here

600
00:46:14,403 --> 00:46:16,172
and stopped in for brunch.

601
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,175
Looks like some sort of
government-regulated facility.

602
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:21,210
Why would my dad be
in a government facility?

603
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:23,146
Maybe he's assisting special ops

604
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:26,449
for some sort of Mother
Nature-inspired biological warfare.

605
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:27,817
Hey, special ops over there,

606
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:29,385
why don't you cut
the conspiracy theory?

607
00:46:29,418 --> 00:46:31,887
You're freaking out
bottle blond over here.

608
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,088
So what do you wanna do then?

609
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:35,893
I wanna find a gate and see
if anyone will let us in.

610
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:52,107
Guys, it's gonna be too dark to
walk back if we don't go now.

611
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:54,577
We can take this road so we don't
have to go through the woods.

612
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,579
Yeah, in the dark?

613
00:46:56,612 --> 00:46:58,214
We have flashlights.

614
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,516
Hey, someone's standing
guard over there.

615
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:04,054
Excuse me.

616
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:05,054
Hello there.

617
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:11,126
Man. We're not terrorists.
We're just college kids.

618
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:13,230
This is private property.
Move along.

619
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:14,230
But wait. My dad...

620
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,499
We think my dad is
already on your property.

621
00:47:16,532 --> 00:47:17,467
Come again?

622
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,969
My dad, he's somewhere in there.

623
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,472
We keep a guard posted here
around the clock.

624
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:26,076
I can assure you your father is not...
on these grounds.

625
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:27,877
But, sir, we tracked him here.

626
00:47:28,677 --> 00:47:31,447
Are you guys on drugs?
Are you tripping on shrooms?

627
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:35,251
No. No, sir. We're sober.

628
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:37,586
But we're just looking
for our friend's father.

629
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:41,523
He was carrying a GPS tracking
device in his camping gear,

630
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:44,059
and that device is
somewhere in there,

631
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:45,527
and we think
her father might be, too.

632
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:48,064
Please, can we just come in
and look for him?

633
00:47:48,097 --> 00:47:49,900
We're not gonna steal anything.

634
00:47:49,932 --> 00:47:51,034
You can watch us.

635
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:53,036
Okay, you kids hang right there.

636
00:47:58,074 --> 00:47:59,009
Sullivan.

637
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:03,380
Yes?

638
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,414
This is gate.

639
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:06,182
I know.

640
00:48:06,215 --> 00:48:08,050
I've got a couple of kids here,

641
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:10,887
and one says her dad
is on the estate grounds. Over.

642
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,623
All right.

643
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:15,291
Maybe we should let them in,

644
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:16,460
and we can get this settled.

645
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:19,028
10-4. Would you like me
to escort them?

646
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:20,496
They're on foot. Over.

647
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:24,567
No, that won't be necessary. Just
have them come down the main road.

648
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,570
Have them wait for me at the
aviary fence. Thank you.

649
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,612
Guys, I really don't like this.

650
00:48:35,644 --> 00:48:36,880
Doesn't anyone find it odd

651
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:39,548
that they're allowing us to just
waltz across their property

652
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:40,951
without an attendant?

653
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,454
It's obvious
some rich guy owns the place.

654
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:47,456
Probably has security cameras
in half these trees, too.

655
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:50,492
Yeah, not to mention the electrical
fence surrounding the entire property,

656
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:53,996
ensuring we couldn't escape even
if we did try and steal something.

657
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,432
Yeah, see,
that's what concerns me.

658
00:48:56,465 --> 00:48:59,101
Rich people like
to keep their stuff safe.

659
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,538
Yeah, but what kind
of normal rich person

660
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,505
lives this far
out in the backwoods?

661
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:06,543
Finally, Tri Delt has
a valid point.

662
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:07,376
Thank you.

663
00:49:09,512 --> 00:49:11,314
What do you think is in there?

664
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:12,549
Maybe horses.

665
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:15,284
What kind of horse needs
a fence that high?

666
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:17,187
Could have some exotic game.

667
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:19,455
Maybe ostriches
or water buffalo.

668
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:23,393
Guys, according to this, that GPS
device is right through there.

669
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,197
Can't we just go back
to Maddy's cabin,

670
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,432
and shower the filth
of this forest off of us,

671
00:49:30,465 --> 00:49:33,402
and then come back
tomorrow maybe

672
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:36,173
when a third party knows
where to find us?

673
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:50,353
Taylor, we can't just bail
on Maddy's dad right now,

674
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:52,788
not when we've come
all this way already.

675
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:55,625
Justin,
do I have "suicide"

676
00:49:55,657 --> 00:49:58,795
written in pink lip gloss
across my forehead?

677
00:49:58,827 --> 00:50:01,063
No, I don't think so.

678
00:50:01,097 --> 00:50:02,766
I'm not going any farther.
I'm sorry.

679
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:06,335
Taylor, this is exactly what I was
talking to you about last week.

680
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:08,137
Sometimes, you are
the most selfish...

681
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,105
Justin, wait.

682
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:11,740
I think Taylor is right.

683
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:13,710
I think we should go
and come back tomorrow.

684
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:15,612
You guys have done enough
for me already,

685
00:50:15,644 --> 00:50:17,780
and it's getting late.
It's gonna be dark soon.

686
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,018
-What...
-Taylor! Taylor!

687
00:50:22,485 --> 00:50:24,086
Taylor, wake up! Taylor!

688
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,623
Taylor, wake up.

689
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,329
Run! Run!

690
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,468
Paige!

691
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,205
Nice! Nice!

692
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:18,574
What happened?

693
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:22,479
We found another one
at the cabin,

694
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:26,316
out cold on the ground,
big knot on his forehead.

695
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,717
All right, so what do you think?

696
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,219
Do you think
he's with the other kids?

697
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,489
Well, when we saw him
at the gas station earlier,

698
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:33,623
we didn't think he was.

699
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:35,557
All right, good. Good.

700
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:36,726
So, what about the car?

701
00:51:38,293 --> 00:51:39,394
We just took care of it.

702
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,396
All right, so we'll take care
of the vehicles later.

703
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:43,699
We'll put the...
We'll put the kids in the barn.

704
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,668
And that new kid, I want
you to give him a sedative

705
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:46,802
before you put him
with the other kids.

706
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:49,471
All right. I'm gonna need
a sleeper though. I'm out.

707
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:50,707
I'm loaded, buddy.

708
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:01,350
Don't let him get away! Come on!

709
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:02,485
No worries. I got this.

710
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:11,827
Woo wee!
I could get used to this!

711
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,864
Hey, don't be
such a Neanderthal, Dale.

712
00:52:14,896 --> 00:52:16,665
We're not murderers!

713
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:18,668
We're doing this
because we have no choice.

714
00:52:47,862 --> 00:52:48,797
Paige.

715
00:52:49,998 --> 00:52:50,966
Wake up.

716
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,802
-Dude...
-Paige.

717
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:55,237
I got hit in the head
with a baseball bat.

718
00:52:58,373 --> 00:53:00,643
Try knock-down
tranquilizer dart.

719
00:53:02,311 --> 00:53:04,780
What the...
We were attacked.

720
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:09,219
And what is he doing here?

721
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:14,856
Dude, I think
I have a conclusion.

722
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:17,527
It's "contusion," half-baked.

723
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:20,429
I don't get it.
Why would the guys let us go?

724
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,633
Yeah, and where the hell are we?

725
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:26,336
Out by the river.
I can hear it down there.

726
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,870
Who were those guys?

727
00:53:27,902 --> 00:53:30,439
Wait. What guys
are we talking about?

728
00:53:30,472 --> 00:53:32,307
You didn't see them 'cause
you were first knocked down,

729
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,777
but there were two big guys coming
down the drive with dart guns.

730
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,648
How did you get here?

731
00:53:42,784 --> 00:53:44,653
I was on my bike.

732
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:49,492
They kidnapped me when I stopped
on the side of the road.

733
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:52,662
Right. And why were you stopped
on the side of the road?

734
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:54,597
Take a piss.

735
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:55,765
You're an idiot.

736
00:53:55,797 --> 00:53:58,567
Guys, stop.
We're in this together.

737
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:02,604
Well, do you remember
them saying anything,

738
00:54:02,637 --> 00:54:04,406
or do you know where we are?

739
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,275
Maddy! Hey, Maddy!

740
00:54:07,842 --> 00:54:08,844
Guys...

741
00:54:10,646 --> 00:54:12,515
I think these are
my father's footprints.

742
00:54:14,148 --> 00:54:17,052
I thought you said your dad was on the
other side of that big cage that we saw.

743
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:18,721
Yeah.

744
00:54:18,753 --> 00:54:20,589
And my guess is we are too.

745
00:54:23,492 --> 00:54:25,028
Wait.

746
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,597
Cage? What the hell cage
are you talking about?

747
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:31,067
I don't know. It was some sort
of electrical, fenced-in pen.

748
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:32,469
It was eight feet tall.

749
00:54:33,902 --> 00:54:35,637
Well, what the hell
is in the pen?

750
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,442
What was that?

751
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:40,643
Some sort of bird.

752
00:54:40,675 --> 00:54:42,811
It sounded more like a banshee.

753
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,487
Guys, come check this out.

754
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:58,561
So, maybe this is
an ostrich farm.

755
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:02,065
No. I ain't never seen
no ostrich with feet that big.

756
00:55:02,097 --> 00:55:03,500
Maddy, where are you going?

757
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,034
I'm going to find my father.

758
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,671
In the same direction
as those big bird tracks?

759
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:09,939
Nope, I don't think so.

760
00:55:11,206 --> 00:55:14,043
You can do whatever you want,
but I'm going to find my dad.

761
00:55:14,076 --> 00:55:16,579
Maddy, come on.
Don't be crazy.

762
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:17,947
We are in here deep.

763
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,248
We need to get out of here now,

764
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:21,918
call the cops, and send someone
back after your dad, okay?

765
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:25,822
Maddy... that is the best way
to help your dad.

766
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,361
Fine.

767
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:34,396
Which way should we go?

768
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,869
I think the south fence line should
be somewhere right through there.

769
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:08,764
Everybody.

770
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:10,866
Do not make a move.
Do not take a step.

771
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,969
Do not make a noise.

772
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:19,008
Dude, we're sitting ducks
in this clearing, man.

773
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:21,443
Yeah, but if we can see them
coming from all four sides,

774
00:56:21,476 --> 00:56:22,978
they can't spring
a surprise attack.

775
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:31,754
I'm getting
the hell out of here!

776
00:56:31,786 --> 00:56:32,821
Where are you going?

777
00:56:36,858 --> 00:56:38,894
-Maddy, what are you doing?
-We might need this.

778
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:47,503
What the hell is that thing?

779
00:56:52,173 --> 00:56:54,943
Everybody back up very slowly.

780
00:56:59,614 --> 00:57:00,883
Paige!

781
00:57:02,985 --> 00:57:04,621
Everybody run!

782
00:57:57,572 --> 00:57:59,708
-Over here!
-Come and get us! Hey!

783
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,611
-Here! Here!
-Maddy, look out! Come on!

784
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:04,146
-Hey! Over here!
-Come and get us, ugly!

785
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:21,998
Pull your legs up.

786
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,867
My god.

787
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,936
Maddy, are you okay?

788
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,139
Let me see the leg.
Let me see your leg.

789
00:59:40,175 --> 00:59:42,378
It looks...

790
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:45,048
No. No, not so bad. Not so bad.

791
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:50,786
We do need
some disinfectant right away.

792
00:59:50,818 --> 00:59:53,722
-Can you check your dad's bag?
-Yeah.

793
00:59:53,755 --> 00:59:55,790
And we gotta
stop the bleeding too.

794
00:59:58,092 --> 00:59:59,295
So now what are we gonna do?

795
00:59:59,327 --> 01:00:01,898
Guys, any ideas?

796
01:00:02,898 --> 01:00:04,133
Just hold on.

797
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:09,137
What's going on over there?

798
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:12,240
That thing plucked her leg.

799
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:16,012
Yeah, and I'm gonna pluck her
in the head.

800
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,713
Taylor, try your phone again.

801
01:00:24,018 --> 01:00:25,721
Your dad's Swiss Army Knife.

802
01:00:27,255 --> 01:00:30,025
I gave this to him...
last Christmas.

803
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,762
It was right
after my mom passed away.

804
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:41,237
She was always
against those things.

805
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:45,875
Too bad she didn't have one the
night she drowned in that car.

806
01:00:45,907 --> 01:00:48,911
She might have been able
to cut herself from that belt.

807
01:00:48,943 --> 01:00:50,346
Hey. Hey.

808
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:53,715
Hey, Maddy.

809
01:00:53,748 --> 01:00:54,916
Be with me right now, okay?

810
01:00:56,284 --> 01:00:57,252
Okay.

811
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,688
Can she walk?

812
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,356
Yeah, we think she can walk.

813
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,724
I'm not walking anywhere.

814
01:01:02,757 --> 01:01:04,125
That thing is still out there,

815
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:07,429
and for all we know, there could
be 20 more of them running around.

816
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:09,065
And what the hell are they?

817
01:01:09,097 --> 01:01:10,733
They're definitely
not ostriches.

818
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:13,135
And aren't
all the dodos extinct?

819
01:01:13,168 --> 01:01:15,336
They're not dodos.

820
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:17,239
Well, then what the hell
are they?

821
01:01:17,271 --> 01:01:19,275
I think they're
called terror birds.

822
01:01:19,307 --> 01:01:21,443
Terror birds? That's light.

823
01:01:21,476 --> 01:01:25,181
Try "scare the crap out of me, send
my ass into a pecan tree" bird.

824
01:01:26,248 --> 01:01:31,253
I'm serious. I think they're
called terror birds or Titanis.

825
01:01:31,286 --> 01:01:35,057
My dad knows everything about every
kind of animal that ever existed.

826
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,160
Growing up,
it's all he ever talked about.

827
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:39,862
Those birds should
be extinct, though.

828
01:01:39,894 --> 01:01:42,130
Clearly, they're not.

829
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:45,101
Maybe they're genetic clones
like in that movie.

830
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,936
Who cares? They're real,

831
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:50,940
and they wanna eat us like some
salty, sweaty student skewers.

832
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:52,741
Now, how are we gonna
get out of here?

833
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,343
If we found a tree
that was tall enough,

834
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:57,046
I think we could get over that
electrical fence, easy-breezy.

835
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:58,514
Yeah, but how are
we gonna get there?

836
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:00,081
We're gonna need some bait.

837
01:02:00,114 --> 01:02:02,083
Wait. What do you mean "bait"?

838
01:02:02,117 --> 01:02:04,320
You don't really think
those guys that put us here

839
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:07,056
are gonna let us hang out
in these trees all day, do you?

840
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:12,060
We have Maddy's dad's water and
enough pecans to eat for days.

841
01:02:14,028 --> 01:02:15,965
So let's see
who caves in first.

842
01:02:21,036 --> 01:02:22,371
Kids are in the trees.

843
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:24,005
Birds are on the ground.

844
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:25,975
Kind of funny?

845
01:02:26,007 --> 01:02:27,108
Yeah, that's really funny.

846
01:02:27,141 --> 01:02:28,277
You wanna know
what's really funny?

847
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:30,346
You're the one that's gotta
get them out of the trees.

848
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,915
How are we supposed to do that?

849
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:35,017
Well, I don't know.

850
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:37,887
Why don't you just hit them
with a dart maybe?

851
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,555
I don't care what you gotta do.
Shoot them.

852
01:02:39,588 --> 01:02:40,990
They're teasing my birds.

853
01:02:42,023 --> 01:02:43,025
Go. Do it.

854
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:46,329
You want us... to go out
there in the aviary?

855
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:50,031
Do what you did before,
bring your tranqs.

856
01:02:50,065 --> 01:02:52,001
Go on. Do it. Go!

857
01:03:02,844 --> 01:03:04,480
Looks like
both the birds are back.

858
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:09,417
I think that's
the one that had Paige.

859
01:03:10,918 --> 01:03:12,420
Yep, that's the one.

860
01:03:14,623 --> 01:03:19,061
Hey, you!
You are one ugly creature!

861
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:21,130
You hear me? Yeah!

862
01:03:21,163 --> 01:03:23,365
U-G-L-Y!

863
01:03:23,398 --> 01:03:27,603
You ain't got no alibi!
You ugly! Yeah, yeah, you ugly!

864
01:03:27,635 --> 01:03:30,405
Maybe you shouldn't
antagonize it like that, Taylor.

865
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,177
I'm sorry, Mr. Birdy Bird.

866
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,112
Did I insult your feelings?

867
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,382
Taylor.

868
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,456
My god.

869
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:08,244
Friends helping friends.

870
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,079
Ain't that cute?

871
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,914
All right, get down here,
all of you.

872
01:04:13,447 --> 01:04:15,317
Justin, what are we going to do?

873
01:04:15,349 --> 01:04:17,420
They have guns.
What else are we gonna do?

874
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:20,389
Hurry it up!

875
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:26,528
Let's go.

876
01:04:28,195 --> 01:04:29,297
Come on!

877
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,010
Toss that pack
over here, sweetie.

878
01:04:46,715 --> 01:04:47,916
What do you want from us?

879
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:52,288
Well, we were trying to make
you the birds' breakfast,

880
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,223
but clearly,
you're a bit more resourceful.

881
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:57,358
Well, most of you, anyway.

882
01:04:57,391 --> 01:04:59,661
Clever little Polly's crackers,
ain't they?

883
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:02,965
A lot more clever than their
father was. That's for sure.

884
01:05:02,998 --> 01:05:04,166
Just let us go, okay,

885
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:06,534
and we won't say
anything to anybody.

886
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:09,571
We'll just say that we got attacked
by some massive mountain lion.

887
01:05:09,603 --> 01:05:13,574
You thought this speech out,
haven't you, hot stuff?

888
01:05:13,608 --> 01:05:15,443
I bet you're
at the top of your class.

889
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:18,947
Or, you know... at least
working your way to the top.

890
01:05:19,748 --> 01:05:23,085
Screw you,
you backwater bacteria.

891
01:05:23,117 --> 01:05:26,688
Now, we're gonna give you
to the count of three

892
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:30,125
to head that way
back into the forest

893
01:05:30,157 --> 01:05:32,560
before we start putting
bullets in your head.

894
01:05:32,594 --> 01:05:33,663
How does that sound?

895
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,133
One...

896
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:39,235
Two...

897
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:46,675
No, no!

898
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,750
Everything! I gotta do
everything myself!

899
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,323
Are you in? Let's go.

900
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:13,402
I think the kids escaped.

901
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:14,536
Think so?

902
01:06:14,568 --> 01:06:15,603
Well, so did my birds,

903
01:06:15,637 --> 01:06:18,207
because you let those kids
get ahold of your keys.

904
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,476
Yeah, but who's gonna get
the birds back in the sanctuary?

905
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,611
After they're done feeding,

906
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:25,280
you're gonna load up on darts
and pray you don't miss.

907
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:27,383
Russ! Russ was dead.

908
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,051
Yes, I know.

909
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:31,252
Those damned birds
tore him apart.

910
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:34,423
Yes, I know. I saw the whole
show on the monitor, all right?

911
01:06:34,456 --> 01:06:37,659
Now, what we're gonna do is I'm going
back to the laboratory where it's safe.

912
01:06:37,692 --> 01:06:40,061
You're gonna stay here.
Keep an eye on that driveway.

913
01:06:40,094 --> 01:06:42,697
Make sure the birds don't get
past the house. Understood?

914
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:43,966
Yeah, but I don't think...

915
01:06:43,998 --> 01:06:47,035
Or you could go out and help
my babies finish their job.

916
01:06:47,068 --> 01:06:49,271
-I'll be right here if you need anything.
-That's good.

917
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,811
How are we gonna get
through that gate?

918
01:06:56,844 --> 01:06:58,646
We got his keys.

919
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:01,783
Well, I guess
it's our lucky day.

920
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:22,604
Guys, they're coming back.

921
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:25,040
Justin, you're never
gonna make it! Come on!

922
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:39,421
It stalled!

923
01:07:39,454 --> 01:07:41,523
Maybe those keys work
on that barn over there.

924
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:43,125
Let's go.

925
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,096
Hell!

926
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:55,337
Base to Bio. Base to Bio.

927
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:58,874
You look good.
You look good.

928
01:07:58,907 --> 01:08:00,642
Base to Bio. Base to Bio.

929
01:08:00,675 --> 01:08:01,576
You look good there.

930
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,813
Base to Bio. Base to Bio.

931
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,482
Son of a...

932
01:08:07,882 --> 01:08:09,150
Justin.

933
01:08:19,426 --> 01:08:20,728
Justin, hurry.

934
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:22,530
I'm trying.
There's a lot of keys,

935
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:24,834
and there isn't one labeled
for the barn like the gate.

936
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:31,672
My god! They're coming!

937
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:34,176
Dude, you gotta
get that key right now.

938
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:41,116
Justin!

939
01:09:00,268 --> 01:09:01,869
That's my swinging arm, baby.

940
01:09:01,903 --> 01:09:04,907
That ugly beak of yours
is about to hit me a grand slam.

941
01:09:11,512 --> 01:09:12,780
My god! Justin!

942
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,198
Boy, you kids,

943
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:31,599
you sure put a damper in
my afternoon, haven't you?

944
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,738
Six months, this ranch
has been a safe haven,

945
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,875
a place of peace
for my baby birds.

946
01:09:39,908 --> 01:09:41,410
A safe haven?

947
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:45,479
You killed my father.

948
01:09:45,512 --> 01:09:46,782
No, dear.

949
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:49,451
No, your father got himself
into this mess

950
01:09:49,484 --> 01:09:51,853
when he trespassed
on my property

951
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:55,324
when natural selection
chose him as food.

952
01:09:55,356 --> 01:09:57,391
No, I'm no murderer, dear.

953
01:09:57,425 --> 01:10:00,329
You tried feeding us
to your giant parakeets.

954
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,631
Pretty sure some states
consider that murder.

955
01:10:02,663 --> 01:10:05,000
I can't let anything interfere
with my operation,

956
01:10:05,033 --> 01:10:06,835
at least not until
the little ones are hatched.

957
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:08,303
Are you kidding?

958
01:10:08,336 --> 01:10:10,338
You really want
these things to reproduce?

959
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,608
You bet I do!

960
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,710
They're the last two
of their kind.

961
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:17,646
I'm just trying to help them
survive, save a species.

962
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,483
By sacrificing your own kind
to feed them? That's balanced!

963
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:25,787
You kids are the only ones
who cost innocent lives today.

964
01:10:26,787 --> 01:10:30,858
Now I gotta spend the rest of the
afternoon trying to find new wranglers.

965
01:10:31,859 --> 01:10:34,595
And you know how hard it is
to find new wranglers?

966
01:10:34,628 --> 01:10:36,297
I mean, wranglers you can trust.

967
01:10:36,331 --> 01:10:38,800
Look at me. Of course I do.

968
01:10:38,832 --> 01:10:41,737
Okay, Blondie,
let me ask you this.

969
01:10:42,737 --> 01:10:44,573
You know what it costs
to keep somebody's mouth shut?

970
01:10:45,573 --> 01:10:48,677
Probably not any more than it costs
for your Italian import shoes.

971
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:53,248
Welcome to the food chain,
you bastard!

972
01:10:54,716 --> 01:10:55,684
Get away!

973
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:00,855
No, no, no! No!

974
01:11:04,658 --> 01:11:07,028
If there's one thing I know to do,
it's divert a guy's attention.

975
01:11:11,899 --> 01:11:13,902
We need to make a move for it
now while they're still eating.

976
01:11:13,935 --> 01:11:14,870
Where to?

977
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,538
What about in there?
Maybe there's a phone.

978
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:17,738
You don't know that.

979
01:11:17,771 --> 01:11:19,006
But there will be one
at the house.

980
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,908
It's too far. You'll never be
able to outrun those birds.

981
01:11:20,942 --> 01:11:23,311
Watch me.
I did track in high school.

982
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:24,346
Taylor!

983
01:11:50,771 --> 01:11:52,440
Let me look at it.

984
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,842
I think we should find
a way out of here.

985
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:56,744
We're not going anywhere
until I look at your leg.

986
01:11:56,778 --> 01:11:59,381
Besides, I don't think that thing
can get through that door.

987
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:02,718
I think you got
a lot of dirt in it.

988
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:06,888
I'm gonna have
to wrap it better.

989
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:09,625
Well, it looks like
we're in the right place.

990
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,095
What do you think
this place is anyway?

991
01:12:14,695 --> 01:12:16,597
I don't know.
It looks like...

992
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:19,735
Like a hatchery or something.

993
01:12:21,168 --> 01:12:22,805
So either they hatched them
in here or...

994
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:25,740
they were hoping
two of them would lay eggs.

995
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:27,409
Can I borrow your knife?

996
01:12:47,561 --> 01:12:49,930
My god.

997
01:12:49,963 --> 01:12:52,134
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

998
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:53,836
No, I should be sorry.

999
01:12:56,837 --> 01:13:01,108
For Brett, and for getting all of you
into this mess in the first place.

1000
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:02,978
-I am so sorry.
-No, no.

1001
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:05,514
Maddy, it's not your fault.

1002
01:13:06,747 --> 01:13:09,585
Besides, I'm not the only one who
lost someone I cared about today.

1003
01:13:13,654 --> 01:13:15,157
We're gonna make it
through this, okay?

1004
01:13:16,623 --> 01:13:18,159
I hope Taylor is okay.

1005
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:19,561
Me too.

1006
01:13:24,532 --> 01:13:26,435
But I gotta admit...

1007
01:13:26,467 --> 01:13:28,871
I'm thankful that the person
I care about the most...

1008
01:13:30,003 --> 01:13:31,672
is still right here
in front of me.

1009
01:13:32,907 --> 01:13:35,144
You do know I only dated her
to get my mind off you, right?

1010
01:13:36,877 --> 01:13:39,514
I never really had with her
what I have with you.

1011
01:13:39,546 --> 01:13:40,715
Justin, I'm sorry.

1012
01:13:42,082 --> 01:13:43,918
I'm sorry I pushed you away.

1013
01:13:46,887 --> 01:13:50,192
But it's only because I felt the same
way about you, and I just didn't know...

1014
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:53,829
Maddy, Maddy, I get it. I know
all your defense mechanisms.

1015
01:13:54,962 --> 01:13:58,132
And I now that it was hard for
you to get close to people

1016
01:13:58,166 --> 01:13:59,601
after your mom died.

1017
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:04,473
But I let you push me away too,

1018
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:05,841
and I never should have.

1019
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:07,643
But that doesn't matter
anymore, right?

1020
01:14:08,743 --> 01:14:10,579
Because it's never
gonna happen again.

1021
01:14:16,551 --> 01:14:17,786
Yeah.

1022
01:14:17,819 --> 01:14:19,054
Thank god for that knife?

1023
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,027
Looks like somebody has been looking
out for us today from afar.

1024
01:14:28,695 --> 01:14:29,631
Hey.

1025
01:14:30,765 --> 01:14:33,202
Hey. It's okay.

1026
01:14:37,604 --> 01:14:39,707
Do you think
that door is gonna hold?

1027
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,143
I sure as hell hope so.

1028
01:15:19,713 --> 01:15:21,884
You've got to be kidding me!

1029
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,734
That's weird.

1030
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,036
Hello?

1031
01:15:44,939 --> 01:15:47,075
All right, all right.
Keep it down in there.

1032
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,149
What the hell?

1033
01:15:57,618 --> 01:15:58,886
What's wrong with you mutts?

1034
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,841
Hey.

1035
01:16:20,841 --> 01:16:22,978
Hey, so...

1036
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,879
it looks like Sullivan
found the two birds

1037
01:16:24,912 --> 01:16:27,649
in these neighboring islands
in the Caribbean.

1038
01:16:27,681 --> 01:16:31,086
He was funding a dig in Trinidad
for some rumored buried treasure

1039
01:16:31,118 --> 01:16:34,121
all his yuppie friends in Barbados
caught legend of from locals.

1040
01:16:35,122 --> 01:16:37,960
What a better way to waste money than
to spend it all searching for more?

1041
01:16:39,092 --> 01:16:41,162
But what does the treasure
have to do with the birds?

1042
01:16:41,194 --> 01:16:43,130
Well, they didn't find
anything in Trinidad,

1043
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:45,867
so they expanded the dig
to nearby islands, only...

1044
01:16:46,934 --> 01:16:49,371
the natives refused to take
them to two of the islands,

1045
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,706
claiming they were home
to death birds.

1046
01:16:51,738 --> 01:16:54,675
Needless to say, Sullivan was
thrilled by the prospect.

1047
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:57,112
I didn't think that there were
any uncharted islands left.

1048
01:16:57,145 --> 01:17:00,248
Well, these are charted,
Navassa and Caparo.

1049
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,951
So, why didn't anybody know
that the birds were there?

1050
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:05,220
Well, it seems like
they were pretty small islands.

1051
01:17:05,252 --> 01:17:06,954
Totally uninhabited too.

1052
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:09,891
Only the natives did know.

1053
01:17:09,923 --> 01:17:14,095
They even claimed their ancestors
hunted down what was left of them.

1054
01:17:14,127 --> 01:17:16,764
But since no one of any
prominence had ever seen them,

1055
01:17:16,797 --> 01:17:18,733
everyone else just chalked
it up to local myth.

1056
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:24,104
So if the birds were staying so
concealed, how did he find them?

1057
01:17:24,137 --> 01:17:25,739
Bait.

1058
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:27,809
He put goats
all over the island,

1059
01:17:27,841 --> 01:17:30,679
monitored them for weeks to see
where they would disappear.

1060
01:17:31,878 --> 01:17:33,148
Clever bastard.

1061
01:17:34,347 --> 01:17:36,951
So Sullivan found
his buried treasure after all.

1062
01:17:36,984 --> 01:17:40,055
Only two in the world left
of its kind.

1063
01:17:41,055 --> 01:17:42,090
Just like he said.

1064
01:17:44,891 --> 01:17:46,028
Too bad we're gonna kill them.

1065
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:49,730
Miss Biology!

1066
01:17:49,764 --> 01:17:51,266
You do realize
that we'd be responsible

1067
01:17:51,298 --> 01:17:54,335
for the extinction
of an entire species?

1068
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:55,737
Sure do.

1069
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:58,240
Good. Glad we're
on the same page.

1070
01:18:41,048 --> 01:18:44,118
My god! Crap!

1071
01:18:48,555 --> 01:18:50,125
Hey, don't move!

1072
01:18:52,193 --> 01:18:53,228
Where's Harvey?

1073
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:54,496
He's in there.

1074
01:19:17,984 --> 01:19:21,088
We might be stuck.

1075
01:19:21,122 --> 01:19:24,459
There is no way that bird is
leaving if we're up here.

1076
01:19:27,427 --> 01:19:28,997
Well, his ranch house
is just up there.

1077
01:19:29,997 --> 01:19:32,133
All right, I mean,
if we find weapons in there,

1078
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,467
we can maybe get
past that guard.

1079
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:35,302
But what are we gonna do
about that?

1080
01:19:37,604 --> 01:19:39,039
I have an idea.

1081
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,377
Hey, you big chicken,
come and get me!

1082
01:19:45,613 --> 01:19:47,315
See how excited it gets
when I scream?

1083
01:19:47,347 --> 01:19:48,382
Yeah, I don't like it.

1084
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,052
So I record myself
screaming into my phone,

1085
01:19:52,086 --> 01:19:54,856
I press repeat, and I throw
it as far as I can that way.

1086
01:19:54,889 --> 01:19:56,091
You really think
that's gonna work?

1087
01:19:57,091 --> 01:19:58,026
It's worth a shot.

1088
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:02,529
All right, but we're gonna
have to be quick.

1089
01:20:02,563 --> 01:20:03,931
If that bird goes
after the phone...

1090
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,167
I mean, those things are clocking
in at well over 20 miles an hour.

1091
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:08,804
Let's just hope my arm gives us
a good enough head-start.

1092
01:20:09,936 --> 01:20:10,971
All right.

1093
01:20:11,005 --> 01:20:12,407
Ready?

1094
01:20:12,439 --> 01:20:15,342
Hey, you big chicken,
come and get me!

1095
01:20:15,376 --> 01:20:18,012
Hey, you big chicken,
come and get me!

1096
01:20:18,045 --> 01:20:20,081
Hey, you big chicken,
come and get me!

1097
01:20:22,649 --> 01:20:24,018
I don't hear anything.

1098
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,123
It's so far away
you can't hear it.

1099
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,029
It worked.

1100
01:20:36,197 --> 01:20:37,431
Let's go.

1101
01:20:40,434 --> 01:20:42,503
Hey, you big chicken,
come and get me!

1102
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:06,226
Come on! Move!

1103
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:07,161
I can't. No keys!

1104
01:21:07,194 --> 01:21:09,363
My god!
You've got to be kidding me.

1105
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:14,302
I don't see it. It must still be out...
in the field.

1106
01:21:18,271 --> 01:21:22,210
Okay, any sign of that thing
taking a step towards us,

1107
01:21:22,243 --> 01:21:23,611
and I'm back in the van, okay?

1108
01:21:23,644 --> 01:21:24,646
Okay.

1109
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:32,287
Anything?

1110
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,056
No. Let me try the other one.

1111
01:21:37,257 --> 01:21:39,461
-Still over there?
-Yeah.

1112
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:43,631
Wait.

1113
01:21:45,966 --> 01:21:47,368
What do you mean "wait"?

1114
01:21:50,637 --> 01:21:51,506
Justin...

1115
01:21:53,173 --> 01:21:54,442
I think you should get
back into the van.

1116
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,244
Right now.

1117
01:22:05,586 --> 01:22:07,155
Go! Go!

1118
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,100
How are we gonna
open that thing?

1119
01:22:20,134 --> 01:22:21,402
-We're not.
-What?

1120
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:22,971
We're gonna smash
right through it.

1121
01:22:23,003 --> 01:22:24,405
Are you crazy?

1122
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,175
This isn't the movies! That could
be reinforced steel or something.

1123
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,278
Justin, don't do it!

1124
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:34,648
Damn it!

1125
01:22:34,681 --> 01:22:36,717
Look in the back.
Maybe they have another gun.

1126
01:22:38,519 --> 01:22:39,688
I don't see one.

1127
01:22:42,655 --> 01:22:44,225
There's dynamite.

1128
01:22:44,257 --> 01:22:45,393
Bring that over here.

1129
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:57,972
Hey, you prehistoric, overblown
turkey, come and get me!

1130
01:23:01,307 --> 01:23:03,176
Okay, do it.

1131
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:05,012
Here it comes!

1132
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:06,114
Go! Go!

1133
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:44,652
Roasted bird?

1134
01:23:46,753 --> 01:23:48,756
How much you wanna bet
it tastes just like chicken?
