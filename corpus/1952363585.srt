A  Painted  House

2
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:11,361
MAN: It was early
in September 1952.

3
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:13,863
The Cardinals were five games
behind the Dodgers,

4
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:16,366
and the season looked hopeless.

5
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,368
The cotton, however,
was waist-high,

6
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:20,870
and my father and pappy
could be heard whispering words

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:22,872
that were seldom spoken:

8
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:25,375
"It could be a good crop."

9
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,378
Highway 135 ran
straight and flat

10
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:30,380
through the farm country
of the Arkansas Delta.

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,383
On both sides,
as far as I could see,

12
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:35,885
the fields were white
with cotton.

13
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:39,389
Pappy, my grandfather,
drove 37 miles per hour.

14
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:41,891
His theory was that every
automobile had a speed

15
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,893
at which it ran
most efficiently,

16
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,895
and through some
vaguely defined method,

17
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:49,399
he had determined that
his old truck should go 37.

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,901
On the nose.

19
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,920
It was time for the harvest--
a wonderful season for me,

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,423
because they turned out school
for two months.

21
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:17,927
For my grandfather, though,
it was a time of endless worry.

22
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,906
In Pappy's opinion,
this was the best spot

23
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,908
in the county
to catch the hill people.

24
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,410
I wasn't so sure.

25
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,414
We'd been trying to hire some
for a week with no results.

26
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,924
(brakes screech)

27
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,939
Howdy.

28
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,441
Good afternoon.

29
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,442
My name's Spruill.

30
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,443
Eli Chandler.

31
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,445
Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,946
Y'all lookin' for work?

33
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:27,947
Yep.

34
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,449
Where you from?

35
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,451
Eureka Springs.

36
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,953
Well, I'm looking
for field hands.

37
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:34,954
How much you paying?

38
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,456
$1.60 a hundred.

39
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,463
Fella wants to give us $1.60.

40
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,465
I think we
should take it.

41
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,467
You think?

42
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,469
Uh, what kind of cotton?

43
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,971
Stoneville.
Bolls are ready.

44
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,473
Be easy to pick.

45
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:59,979
Well, we made
$1.60 last year.

46
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,981
This the same.

47
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:02,982
Well, we was
kinda hoping

48
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,484
to make
a little more...

49
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,485
What's your name?

50
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,486
Luke.

51
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,987
Sorry,
can't help you.

52
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:08,988
What's yours?

53
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:09,989
Tally.

54
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,491
How old are you?

55
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,992
Ten.

56
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,994
How old are you?

57
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,997
Seventeen.

58
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,500
How long you been riding
that trailer?

59
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,001
Day and a half.

60
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,505
This is Trot.

61
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,007
He ain't right.

62
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,009
Nice to meet you, Trot.

63
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,530
(indistinct conversation)

64
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,547
Your penmanship's
getting better, Luke.

65
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,050
Where's your grandfather?

66
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,053
Across the street,
checking on the Mexicans.

67
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:17,056
You all using
hill people, too?

68
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,559
Yep.
Just found us some.

69
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,563
Buenos dias, senor.

70
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,064
Buenos dias.

71
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,568
Last year, Juan taught me
some Mexican.

72
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,070
Eli's worried
about paying them too much.

73
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,573
Your grandfather worries
about everything.

74
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,075
(sighs):
He's a farmer.

75
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,577
Are you going
to be a farmer?

76
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,578
No, ma'am.

77
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,580
Baseball player.

78
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,081
For the Cardinals?

79
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,583
Of course.

80
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,087
Here's my truck.

81
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,093
(speaking Spanish)

82
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,101
Buenos dias, senor.

83
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,651
I thought you told them
to set up behind the barn.

84
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,152
I did.

85
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,155
They set up right on
my baseball field.

86
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,659
Well, finally got
the Mexicans.

87
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,660
Seven of them.

88
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,161
Yes, ma'am.

89
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,663
MAN:
That's good.

90
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,666
What are those
people doing in
our front yard?

91
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,668
I asked them to set up
behind the barn.

92
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,170
I don't know why
they pickedthatspot.

93
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,672
Can you ask
them to move?

94
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,674
I cannot.
They pack up,
they'll leave.

95
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,676
You know how
the hill people are.

96
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,678
Segue me, muchachos.

97
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,180
(sheep bleating)

98
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,682
Go on out into
the fields

99
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,184
and tell your dad
supper's almost ready.

100
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,188
(sheep bleating,
chickens clucking)

101
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,700
(guitar picking
slow Spanish melody)

102
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,670
It is... is very nice.
Very clean. Thanks.

103
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,172
It is, isn't it?

104
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,174
Oh.

105
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,676
(laughs)

106
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,678
The garden's full,
and I'll...

107
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,180
bring you a basket
every other day.

108
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,683
Y'all don't have
to pay for it.

109
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,685
It's just... part
of the deal.

110
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,186
Gracias, senora.

111
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,694
ADULT LUKE:
As I rode back from the fields,
holding on to my father,

112
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,697
his shirt and overalls
were soaked with sweat,

113
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,700
but his arms were like steel.

114
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,705
My mother was waiting for us
by the water pump.

115
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,207
She had grown up in a house
full of girls,

116
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,211
and had been raised in part by
a couple of old, prissy aunts.

117
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,214
I think they had bathed more
than farm people,

118
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,718
and her passion for cleanliness
had rubbed off on my father.

119
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,722
I got a complete scrubbing
every Saturday afternoon,

120
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,724
whether I needed it or not.

121
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,730
(sighs)

122
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,702
...picking cotton
or something?

123
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:11,707
(giggling)

124
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:12,708
You're all dirty.

125
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:24,220
RADIO REPORTER:
...subcommittee ended

126
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,722
a 17-month investigation
of mismanagement and scandal

127
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:29,225
in the Justice Department,
reporting the elimination

128
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,727
of most of the conditions
it had been investigating.

129
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:32,728
Meanwhile...

130
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:36,232
No Cardinals game.
Rained out.

131
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,733
Right.

132
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,235
Nothing to
worry about.

133
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:40,736
It's all the way
up in St. Louis.

134
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:41,737
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh...

135
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:44,240
...adjourned again,
still tightly deadlocked.

136
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,742
They will meet again
September 12.

137
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:49,245
In related news,
Chinese troops hit Bunker Hill

138
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:53,249
east of Pan Mun Jom
in two small feeler actions,

139
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:55,251
as nine other enemy groups

140
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,753
probed along
the Eighth Army Front.

141
00:08:57,753 --> 00:08:59,255
Ricky's all right.

142
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:01,757
He'll be home
before you know it.

143
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,759
...Chinese troops stormed
the hill.

144
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,261
No bad news.

145
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:08,764
...were killed in this action.
Meanwhile, northwest of...

146
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:34,790
If our luck holds out,
we can expect what,

147
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,792
to break even this year?

148
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,794
That's the goal.

149
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:41,297
Breaking even's not a bad thing.

150
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:42,798
We don't want for anything.

151
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,300
What about the debt

152
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,802
you and your daddy are carrying
from previous years?

153
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:51,807
We owe $2,000
to the gin for '51.

154
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:55,311
We owe the John Deere dealer
in Jonesboro for parts.

155
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:59,315
Co-op for seed and supplies,
and Watson's for groceries.

156
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:00,816
I know the situation.

157
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,820
Someday it'll be different.

158
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,324
I'll own my own land,
free and clear.

159
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:11,827
And how different
will it be, Jesse?

160
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,371
Howdy. How you doing?

161
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:57,873
Okay.

162
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,877
I'm getting myself
a Cardinals jacket.

163
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:03,379
Oh, yeah?

164
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,881
Uh, Car-Cardinal red.

165
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:08,384
It's shiny.

166
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,386
Costs $7.50.

167
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:14,390
In ten days, I'll have
picked enough to get it.

168
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,892
That's real nice.

169
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:18,894
JESSE:
Luke!

170
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:19,895
Yeah?

171
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:21,897
What are you doing?

172
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:24,400
I-I had to take a pee.

173
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,902
Keep up now!

174
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,904
Yes, sir.

175
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:40,416
Cinquenta-dos.

176
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,917
No piedras.

177
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,919
Fifty-two.

178
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:51,927
All right! Lunch!

179
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:02,438
Probably heat got him.

180
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:07,943
TALLY: Thank you.

181
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,453
(engine chugging)

182
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:23,459
(men speaking Spanish)

183
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,472
Luke...

184
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:39,475
We'd like you to stay with Trot, 
up here at the house,

185
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,477
for the rest
of the afternoon.

186
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:44,480
And if he takes a turn for
the worse, y'all just come out

187
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,483
to the lower 40, and fetch
one of the Spruills.

188
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:50,486
Well... what about
my Cardinal jacket?

189
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,492
There's 80 acres
of cotton out there...

190
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,994
I guess we could save you
a little bit.

191
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:03,499
(engine chugging)

192
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:04,500
(gears grinding)

193
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,021
Trot... are you okay?

194
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,025
I guess.

195
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,537
Does Tally like baseball?

196
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,554
(men speaking Spanish)

197
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,581
(laughing)

198
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:31,587
Ball.

199
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:34,089
(Trot coughs)

200
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:43,599
Picked 300 pounds...

201
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,602
then the heat got me.

202
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:49,104
Fetch me some water, boy.

203
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:51,106
Sir?

204
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:52,608
Fetch me some water.

205
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:59,114
Cold water, boy...
from the house.

206
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:02,618
And hurry. I've been working
all day-- you ain't.

207
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:34,650
Give me another glass.

208
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,652
(belches)

209
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:38,654
You got anything to eat?

210
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:41,156
Do you?

211
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:43,659
Um, no.

212
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,163
You mean no, sir...

213
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:49,665
don't you, boy?

214
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:52,167
No, sir.

215
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:57,673
You farm people are
right uppity, you know that?

216
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:06,181
Think you're better than us hill
folk because you have this land,

217
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:07,683
'cause you pay us to work it.

218
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,194
We're just one notch above
them wetbacks, ain't we, boy?

219
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,699
Just a bunch a hillbillies.

220
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,701
Ain't that right, boy?

221
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:34,710
We got a house
nicer than yours, boy.

222
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,712
A lot nicer.

223
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:39,715
It's bigger.

224
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:43,218
Got a long front porch.

225
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:46,221
And you know what else it's got?

226
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:48,724
You ain't gonna believe this,

227
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:51,727
but our house
has got paint on it.

228
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:53,729
White paint.

229
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:54,730
You ever see

230
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,734
paint, boy?

231
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,243
Why don't you sodbusters
paint your houses?

232
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:09,745
Stop it, Hank!

233
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:15,250
(laughs)

234
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:27,162
(crickets chirping)

235
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:29,164
(baseball game on radio)

236
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:30,165
Stan up?

237
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,667
No, ma'am. Slaughter.

238
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,669
That's a deep fly ball
to right center!

239
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,170
It might be out of here...
No!

240
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,672
It's off
the center field screen.

241
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,173
One run, two runs will score!

242
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:39,675
And here comes Stanky!

243
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,176
They're waving him in

244
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:42,678
for number three.

245
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:44,680
The throw to the plate.
He slides...

246
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,181
He's safe!
Stanky is safe,

247
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:47,683
and Slaughter will make it

248
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:49,184
safely into third.

249
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:51,186
TALLY: Be right back, Pa.

250
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:53,689
Holy cow!
This game is tied.

251
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,190
Life from the Cardinals.

252
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,192
What a play!
Through seven innings...

253
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:58,193
Howie Pollet was having

254
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:00,195
a great night,
showing the Cardinals

255
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:02,197
why they should've
never traded him.

256
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:05,701
(guitar strumming,
men singing in Spanish)

257
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:08,203
Trot told me about
what Hank said...

258
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:12,207
what he did.

259
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:14,209
You tell your daddy?

260
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:18,213
Didn't tell no one.

261
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,218
You scared?

262
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:24,720
No.

263
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,223
My Pappy would take
a stick to Hank.

264
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,227
He's got a mean streak,
my granddaddy has.

265
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:35,230
Why, then?

266
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,733
Because...

267
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:40,235
(long, heavy sigh)

268
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:44,239
because if...
Pappy punishes Hank,

269
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,241
you folks will pack up

270
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:49,745
and move down the road
to another farm.

271
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:52,748
We'll be left
shorthanded.

272
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:55,751
That's why.

273
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:59,254
You're smarter
than I thought.

274
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:04,259
Well, if it
means anything...

275
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,764
I'm sorry about what
Hank done and said.

276
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:21,276
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
So after their three-run
outburst...

277
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,277
Mama?

278
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:23,278
Mm-hmm?

279
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:25,781
Ever think of
painting the house?

280
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:26,782
Foolishness.

281
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:29,284
It costs too much.

282
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:33,789
Luke, someday we'll have a house

283
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,792
with indoor plumbing, and...

284
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,294
shrubs around the porch,

285
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:41,296
and with paint on the boards.

286
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:43,799
Maybe even brick.

287
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,817
(crying)

288
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:05,821
JESSE:
12:00. Quittin' time!

289
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:11,326
On Saturdays,
we pick a half day.

290
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:13,328
Just a half day today.

291
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,330
¿Comprende?

292
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,332
We can go to the movies.

293
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:18,834
I understand.

294
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,335
I don't need a movie.

295
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:22,337
I need all the work I can get.

296
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,841
On Saturdays,
you work a half day.

297
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,342
Sundays, we don't work at all.

298
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:29,344
We observe the Sabbath.

299
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,854
On Saturdays, we work half day.

300
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:49,865
ADULT LUKE:
Town on a Saturday afternoon
was very busy.

301
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,867
All the farmers
and all their families

302
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:54,369
were loading up on supplies,
talking weather,

303
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,371
and trading gossip.

304
00:20:58,373 --> 00:20:59,875
Hey,buenos dias.

305
00:21:11,386 --> 00:21:16,892
Okay, so, five cents
for the matinee,

306
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:18,894
five cents for a Double Cola,

307
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:22,898
three cents for popcorn.

308
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:23,899
That there
is an advance

309
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,400
against your
pickin' earnings.

310
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,902
You got to pay
that back.

311
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:28,403
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:32,407
Bye.

313
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:33,408
Bye, Mom.

314
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:34,910
KATHLEEN:
Bye.

315
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:41,917
(banjo playing)

316
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:49,424
There's a fight
behind the Co-op!

317
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:50,926
Come on!
Get out of my way!

318
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:55,430
(yelling)

319
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:02,938
Oh, get up!

320
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:05,440
I'll bet it's
the Sisco brothers.

321
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:10,445
Told ya.

322
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:11,446
Who's that?

323
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:13,448
Don't know.
Probably a hillbilly.

324
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:14,950
Get up and fight,
hillbilly!

325
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:18,453
Come on, Jerry,
come on!

326
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:19,454
Let's go!

327
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,956
Let's go! Come on!

328
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:22,457
That ain't fair!
Fight like a man!

329
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:28,463
(shouting)

330
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:49,484
Hey, you stupid hillbilly!

331
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:51,486
Let go of my brother!

332
00:22:57,492 --> 00:23:00,495
(grunting and shouting)

333
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,509
(crowd quiets)

334
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:16,511
Anybody want more?

335
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,016
Come on!

336
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:23,018
Come on an'
get you some!

337
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:26,021
(groans, coughs)

338
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:32,027
Come on. Y'all don't
need to see this.

339
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:34,446
(thud)

340
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,449
(thunder rumbles)

341
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,451
I awoke to the sound of rain

342
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,453
and the tin roof sang
under the torrents.

343
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,455
My thoughts were on the fight.

344
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,457
I wanted to tell my father,

345
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:49,461
but then I did not want
to be a witness.

346
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,963
GRAN:
Luke!

347
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,465
Pappy says the rain's

348
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,967
going to stop in
time for church.

349
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,473
What you want
for breakfast?

350
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,475
Biscuits.

351
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,977
Then I'll make
some biscuits.

352
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,482
I had a dream last night
about Ricky.

353
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:11,983
A good dream?

354
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,985
Yes, very good.

355
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,988
I dreamed the war
suddenly ended.

356
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,490
They forgot to tell us.

357
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,992
We were all sitting out here
on the porch one night,

358
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,994
and out there
on that road

359
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:26,498
we saw a man
running toward us.

360
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,999
And it was Ricky.

361
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:32,003
I wish I could have
a dream like that.

362
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:36,007
Well, I think the Lord
is telling us something.

363
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,009
Uncle Ricky coming home?

364
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,511
Yes.

365
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,514
Maybe not
right away, but...

366
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,016
the war will
be ended soon.

367
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:49,020
And we'll look up
and we'll see him

368
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,022
walking across
the yard there.

369
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,028
Gran?
Uh-huh?

370
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:00,532
I pray for Uncle Ricky
every night.

371
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,534
Oh...

372
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:17,549
(organ music playing)

373
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,055
Hello, Stick.

374
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,056
You working on a Sunday?

375
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:28,560
Crime don't seem to
respect the Sabbath.

376
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,563
One of them
Sisco boys is dead.

377
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,564
PAPPY:
Murder?

378
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,566
STICK:
Good folks get murdered.

379
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,568
White trash like the Siscos
get killed.

380
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,570
I still got
to investigate.

381
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,072
I'm going to need
to come out and speak
to one of your hands.

382
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,075
You'll have to wait
till after church.

383
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,577
Some folks go to church.

384
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,579
I'm on duty.

385
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,102
Had a big fight
yesterday in town.

386
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,104
Couple of local boys
got into it

387
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,106
with a fellow
from the hills.

388
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,108
One of them died
this morning.

389
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,110
Fractured skull.

390
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,112
Ain't none of us.
We're peaceful folk.

391
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,114
Is that so?

392
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,116
Y'all go into town
yesterday?

393
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,118
We did.

394
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,127
We did.

395
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:40,632
You got a boy
named Hank?

396
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,633
Maybe.

397
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,134
Don't play games with me.

398
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,137
I ask you a question,
you give me a straight answer.

399
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,639
Got a big jail
over in Jonesboro

400
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,140
with a lot of room.

401
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,142
I'm Hank Spruill.

402
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,144
Did you go into
town yesterday

403
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,146
and get in a fight
behind the Co-op?

404
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,148
Nope. I stopped the fight.

405
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,150
Couple fellas was beating up
on a boy from the hills.

406
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,652
I stopped it.

407
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,153
You use a piece of wood?

408
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,154
Didn't need to.

409
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,155
I asked you
a question.

410
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,157
Did you use a
piece of wood?

411
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,158
Nope.

412
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,160
They had a two-by-four.

413
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,662
I guess I'd better take you in.

414
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,664
Whoa.

415
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,666
If he goes, we go.

416
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,668
Aw, slow down, Stick.

417
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,169
You and I both know

418
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,672
the Siscos ain't
good for nothin'.

419
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,174
They fight often,
they fight dirty.

420
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,177
Seems to me they
just picked on
the wrong fella.

421
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,180
I got a body, Eli.
You understand?

422
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,182
He was just breaking up a fight.

423
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,685
I heard after
the fight was over,

424
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,187
he picked up a piece of wood
and beat the boys.

425
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,192
Now I know two against one
ain't fair,

426
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,694
and I know it's the Siscos,

427
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,697
but I ain't sure one of them
had to get killed.

428
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,699
I didn't kill nobody.

429
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:48,700
I broke up a fight.

430
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,201
And there was three of them,
not two.

431
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,703
Ain't a court
in this country

432
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,205
convict three
against one.

433
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:57,208
That's if he's telling
the truth.

434
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,210
He's going to need witnesses.

435
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,212
Little Chandler saw it.

436
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,215
Come here, Luke.

437
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,221
You see the fight?

438
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,724
Yes, sir.

439
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,225
What were you
doing there?

440
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,729
I heard there was a fight,

441
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,732
so I took off and watched it.

442
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,734
Tell me what you saw.

443
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,235
And tell the truth.

444
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,737
My boy don't lie.

445
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,242
Jerry Sisco was fighting
some man from the hills

446
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,243
when Mr. Hank
stepped in

447
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,246
and helped the man
from the hills.

448
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:39,751
The first hill
man, he left.

449
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,253
I think he was
hurt pretty bad.

450
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,261
Then, all of a sudden,

451
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,263
Bobby Sisco charged
from the crowd

452
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,766
and attacked Mr. Hank.

453
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:59,270
It was three against one,
just like Mr. Hank said.

454
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,772
That settles it.

455
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,774
Who used the two-by-four?

456
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,776
Tell him, boy.

457
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,781
One of them Sisco boys picked up
that stick of wood, didn't he?

458
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,283
(breathing hard)

459
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,785
Didn't he, boy?

460
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,788
You watch yourself, boy.

461
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,793
Stick, you're scaring
my boy to death.

462
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,294
There must be
a lot of people

463
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,796
who saw this fight.

464
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,799
What say we go
bedevil them.

465
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,301
I'm going to keep
asking around.

466
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,307
And I might be back.

467
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:54,325
Luke, why didn't you
tell us about that fight?

468
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:57,328
I was scared, I guess.

469
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,330
Scared? Scared of what?

470
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,333
Scared of getting caught
behind the Co-op

471
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,835
watching a fight.

472
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:09,841
Uh, Luke, I'm not
too worried about you
watching a fight.

473
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,844
But keeping secrets
can get you into trouble.

474
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,345
You should've told us
what you saw.

475
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,346
I saw a fight.

476
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,849
Never knew Jerry Sisco
was going to die.

477
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,351
And you told Stick Powers
the truth?

478
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,354
Yes, sir.

479
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,357
One of them Sisco boys
picked up that stick of wood

480
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,859
or was it Hank Spruill?

481
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,361
Well...

482
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:35,867
to be honest, Dad,
things happened so fast.

483
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,870
There was bodies falling
and flying everywhere.

484
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,371
Hank was throwing
those boys around

485
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,373
like they were little toys.

486
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:45,877
The crowd was moving
and hollering.

487
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,879
Then I saw the stick of wood.

488
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,883
Luke, honey, little
boys who keep secrets
from their parents

489
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,886
can get in big trouble.

490
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,387
You can tell us anything.

491
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,389
Yes, ma'am.

492
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,391
Supper in an hour,
okay?

493
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,893
Okay.

494
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,400
"Dear Mom and Dad

495
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,402
"and Jessie and Kathleen
and Luke,

496
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:15,406
"I hope all
is well at home.

497
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:18,910
"I never thought
I'd miss cotton picking,

498
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,913
"but I sure wish
I was home right now.

499
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,415
I miss everything..."

500
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,418
(sighs heavily)

501
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:32,423
"...the farm,
the fried chicken,
the Cardinals.

502
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,926
"Anyway, I'm doing fine
over here.

503
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,427
"Things are quiet.

504
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,429
"We're not on
the front anymore.

505
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,932
"My unit
is five miles back,

506
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,934
"and nobody
is shooting at us

507
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,437
"and we're not
shooting at anybody.

508
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,940
"I really think
I'll be home soon.

509
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,942
"I got your last
batch of letters,

510
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,945
"and they mean
a lot to me.

511
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,448
"So keep writing.
Got to run.

512
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,951
Love to all,
Ricky."

513
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,463
(screen door closes)

514
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,967
We won't be going
to town Saturday.

515
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,470
Why not?

516
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,472
Because I say so.

517
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,975
You ain't afraid
of the Siscos, are you?

518
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:26,978
Be best if
the Spruills

519
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,980
stay out of town for a while.

520
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,481
I discussed it with Mr. Spruill,

521
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,984
and we decided it'd be best
to stay put on Saturday.

522
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,485
Even the Mexicans.

523
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,987
Hey.

524
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,489
I ain't afraid of nobody, son.

525
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,994
Don't you sass me.

526
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,012
I don't see why
I got to do this,

527
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,014
if we're not
going to town.

528
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,515
I'll do it.

529
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,517
(clears throat)

530
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,520
I'm going to Pop and Pearl's
for a few things.

531
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,023
You want to go, Luke?

532
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,026
No, sir.

533
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:18,029
Buy you a cola.

534
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,530
No, thanks.

535
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,036
Hey...

536
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:29,040
no need to be just
as stubborn as he is.

537
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,046
(gasps)

538
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,550
(laughs)

539
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,552
(laughing)

540
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,055
(yells):
Oh!

541
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:47,058
After five days
of endless labor and heat,

542
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,560
and without the prospect
of going to town,

543
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,063
we all got together
and played baseball.

544
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,564
Cowboy pitched
for the Mexicans,

545
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,567
and was surprisingly good.

546
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,569
He struck me out easily.

547
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:03,074
I was humiliated,
especially in front of Tally.

548
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,076
MAN: Come on now, girl!
Get a hit on him.

549
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,578
Give it a whack, Tally.
He ain't no pitcher.

550
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,584
Oh! That's all right.

551
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:18,589
Let's go, Tally, give it a ride.

552
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,595
(cheering)

553
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,597
Good contact.
That's the game.

554
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,598
When Tally got a hit,

555
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:32,603
my humiliation,
enormous, grew even greater.

556
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,607
MIGUEL: Foul! Strike two.

557
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,113
TALLY: Come on, Hank!

558
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,123
Hank wasn't having any better
luck than me against Cowboy,

559
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,126
and when he struck out, I
was glad my father was around.

560
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,627
Don't throw the bat.

561
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,130
If you can't be a sport,
then don't play.

562
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,640
It was now Hank's turn
to pitch to Cowboy.

563
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,644
He reached back for all
the juice he could find,

564
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:17,148
and hurled a fastball
directly at him.

565
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,150
(grunts)

566
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,658
(laughing)

567
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,666
Hey! Hey!

568
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,168
Hey. Hey.

569
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,669
Put it down!

570
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,171
Put it down!

571
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,172
Fight like a man.

572
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,673
Nobody's fighting you.

573
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,175
Miguel, get him back
to the barn.

574
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,176
Come on, Hank.

575
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,179
I'm going to kill that boy.

576
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,180
You've killed enough.

577
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,682
All right, come on, Hank.
Let's go. Come on.

578
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,683
I'm going to kill him.

579
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,185
(muttering in Spanish)

580
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,187
Stay away from the barn, Hank.

581
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,688
MAN: I gonna to talk to him.
Come on home.

582
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,691
(whispers in Spanish)

583
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:10,651
TALLY: Psst!

584
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:13,154
Will you do me
a favor, Luke?

585
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:15,656
Your grandma told my mom

586
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:18,159
there's a creek close by
we can bathe in.

587
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,660
Do you know where it is?

588
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,162
Silers' Creek.

589
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:23,664
About a half-mile that way.

590
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:25,166
Are there any snakes?

591
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:30,171
Maybe a little water snake
or two-- no cottonmouth.

592
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:34,675
Well... will you go with me?

593
00:36:34,675 --> 00:36:36,677
Why?

594
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:39,180
I don't know.

595
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,182
Make sure nobody sees me.

596
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:43,684
Are you scared?

597
00:36:43,684 --> 00:36:46,187
Maybe, a little.

598
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:54,195
I'm real sorry about Hank.

599
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:59,700
He's always causing trouble.

600
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,203
Did you see the fight?

601
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:04,205
The one in town? No.

602
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:06,207
Was it awful?

603
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:07,708
Yeah, pretty bad.

604
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:11,212
He beat those boys so bad.

605
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:13,714
He beat them long after
the fight was over.

606
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:15,716
Now, you tell me
the truth, Luke.

607
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:18,219
Did he pick up
that stick first?

608
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:22,723
Happened real fast.

609
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:28,229
Has he ever killed anyone before?

610
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:30,731
Not that I know of.

611
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:34,235
He went up north once...

612
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:36,737
and he got into some
trouble up there...

613
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:38,239
but we never knew
what happened.

614
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,744
That's the best spot.

615
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:45,246
How deep is it?

616
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:47,748
About here.

617
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:49,750
Well, you go on back
up by the trail,

618
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,752
and make sure
nobody's looking, okay?

619
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:52,753
Okay.

620
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:56,257
Go on.

621
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:57,758
Okay!

622
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:03,764
And, Luke...

623
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:05,766
no peeking, okay?

624
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:07,268
Course not.

625
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:30,291
Luke!

626
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:31,292
Yeah?

627
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,794
Is everything clear?

628
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:34,795
Yep.

629
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:25,846
Thanks, Luke.

630
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:27,348
I feel so much better.

631
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:34,855
You saw me,
didn't you, Luke?

632
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:36,857
Yes.

633
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:38,859
That's okay. I'm not mad.

634
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:40,861
You're not?

635
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:42,863
No.

636
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:46,867
I guess it's only natural,
you know...

637
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:49,370
for boys to look at girls.

638
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:06,887
(turns off engine)

639
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:16,397
Someone's coming!

640
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,402
(honks horn)

641
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:23,404
Hey, everybody.

642
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:25,406
Look who's back.

643
00:40:25,406 --> 00:40:26,407
Jimmy Dale?

644
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:28,409
Why, it's Jimmy Dale!

645
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:31,412
Dang, Jimmy!
We haven't seen you in ages.

646
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:32,413
How you doing?

647
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:34,915
Hey, folks,
this here's my bride, Stacy.

648
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:35,916
She's from Michigan.

649
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,918
Now, this here's my Uncle Eli,

650
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:39,920
and, uh...
his son, my cousin Jess,

651
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,422
and that there is Gran,

652
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:43,424
and Kathleen, Jess's wife,

653
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:44,925
and Kathleen's boy, Luke.

654
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:47,428
I brung Stacy down
to meet all the relatives.

655
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:49,430
I'm so pleased to meet you.

656
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,931
Some car, Jimmy.

657
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:51,932
Yep, it's brand-new.

658
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:52,933
Got it last week.

659
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:54,935
Me and Stacy got married
a month ago, and, uh,

660
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,437
it's our wedding present.

661
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:58,939
"Stacy and I got married;"
not "me and Stacy."

662
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:02,943
ELI:
What is it?

663
00:41:02,943 --> 00:41:04,445
'52?

664
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:05,946
No, no, it's '53.

665
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:07,448
Newest thing on the road.

666
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:08,949
Built it myself.

667
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:10,451
You don't say.

668
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:12,453
Yeah, Buick lets us
custom-order our own cars,

669
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:14,455
and then they, uh,
you get to watch them

670
00:41:14,455 --> 00:41:15,956
when they come
down the line.

671
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:17,458
I put the dashboard
in this one.

672
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,959
How much did it cost?

673
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,461
KATHLEEN: Luke!

674
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,463
$2,700. It's no secret.

675
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:26,467
Every dealer in the country
knows how much they cost.

676
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:29,970
Hill people?

677
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:34,475
Yeah... Eureka Springs.

678
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:36,477
Why do they
live like that?

679
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:38,479
How else could they live?

680
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:41,482
Can't you provide
housing for them?

681
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:44,485
Anyway, um...
(clears throat)

682
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:47,988
Buick will let us finance
the cars for 24 months.

683
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:49,990
Here's some sweet tea.

684
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,492
Tea with ice-- whew!

685
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:52,493
None for me.

686
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:53,494
Thank you.

687
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:54,995
Do you have any hot tea?

688
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:57,998
We don't drink hot tea
around here.

689
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:01,001
Well, up in Michigan,
we don't drink it with ice.

690
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,503
This ain't Michigan.

691
00:42:04,004 --> 00:42:06,507
Would you like to see
my garden, Stacy?

692
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:08,509
Yeah, that's
a great idea.

693
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:10,511
Go on, sweetheart.
Uh, Kathleen's got

694
00:42:10,511 --> 00:42:12,513
just about the prettiest
garden in Arkansas.

695
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:14,515
GRAN: I'll go with you.

696
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:22,523
Where in Pete's sake did you
find her, Jimmy Dale?

697
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:25,025
She's a sweet girl, Eli.

698
00:42:25,025 --> 00:42:27,027
Sh-yeah.

699
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:33,033
She is a Yankee.

700
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:36,036
Yankees ain't so bad.

701
00:42:36,036 --> 00:42:39,039
Hell, they were smart enough
to avoid cotton.

702
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,042
They-They make good money,
and they build good schools.

703
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:45,045
Stacy's family lives in
a real nice house with, uh...

704
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:47,548
indoor plumbing and a telephone
and television.

705
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:48,549
How's Luther?

706
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:49,550
He's doing real well.

707
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,552
I got him on
at the plant.

708
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:53,554
He's making $3 an hour,
40 hours a week.

709
00:42:53,554 --> 00:42:56,056
Luther ain't never seen
so much money.

710
00:42:56,056 --> 00:42:59,560
He was picking cotton
for other people around here,

711
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,562
making what,
a thousand bucks a year?

712
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:05,566
Now he makes $6,000 a year,
plus a bonus and retirement.

713
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:07,067
$6,000?

714
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,068
Yes, sir.

715
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:10,571
Luke, go check
on your mama.

716
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:12,072
Go on.

717
00:43:16,076 --> 00:43:18,078
(sighs)

718
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:20,080
Where's the clutch?

719
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,083
Ain't got no clutch;
it's a automatic.

720
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:24,585
Yeah.

721
00:43:24,585 --> 00:43:26,587
I think I inherited it.

722
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:31,091
We seem to have a lot
of green thumbs in my family.

723
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:36,096
We get almost everything
we eat out of here.

724
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:37,598
It's amazing how much

725
00:43:37,598 --> 00:43:40,100
can provide
for the wintertime, too.

726
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,103
It's-it's really incredible, actually.

727
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:45,105
GRAN: Oh, look what you found.

728
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:46,106
(screams)

729
00:43:46,106 --> 00:43:48,609
Jimmy Dale! Snake! Jimmy Dale!

730
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:49,610
Oh, my gosh!

731
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,112
It's just a green one.

732
00:43:57,117 --> 00:43:59,119
Don't they have snakes
up in Michigan?

733
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,123
Gracias.

734
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:04,625
De nada.

735
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:08,128
Oh...

736
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,131
Oh, dear!

737
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:16,637
I'll make some hot tea.

738
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:18,138
I'll... help you.

739
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:20,140
Luke, you watch after Stacy.

740
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:29,650
I've never ridden in a car.

741
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,151
We have a truck.

742
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:32,653
How old are you?

743
00:44:32,653 --> 00:44:34,154
Ten years old.

744
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:37,157
You're ten, and you've never
ridden in a car?

745
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:41,161
You ever seen a television?

746
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:43,163
In the catalogues.

747
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:45,165
Ever use a telephone?

748
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:47,668
No, ma'am.

749
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:49,670
Unbelievable.

750
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,171
Do you go to school?

751
00:44:51,171 --> 00:44:53,173
Yes, ma'am.

752
00:44:53,173 --> 00:44:55,676
Well, thank heavens.

753
00:44:55,676 --> 00:44:58,178
I just can't believe how
backward you people are.

754
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,681
Here we are.

755
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:06,687
Jimmy Dale!

756
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:14,194
If we don't get going,
we're going to be late.

757
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:16,697
Oh, that's right.

758
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,202
Um, she has to go
to the bathroom.

759
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:25,205
Oh... come with me.

760
00:45:35,716 --> 00:45:36,717
(gasps)

761
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:39,219
You don't have
indoor plumbing?!

762
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:41,722
Uh, well, this is it.

763
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:44,725
(whines and whimpers)

764
00:45:52,232 --> 00:45:54,735
I'll give you
some privacy.

765
00:45:56,737 --> 00:45:58,739
(whimpers)

766
00:46:12,252 --> 00:46:14,254
(Stacy gasps)

767
00:46:14,254 --> 00:46:16,757
Miss Stacy, it's me, Luke.

768
00:46:17,257 --> 00:46:19,259
I'm occupied!

769
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:21,261
Well, um, don't
come out right now.

770
00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:23,764
There's a big black
snake out here.

771
00:46:24,264 --> 00:46:25,766
Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh!

772
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:29,269
Shh! Be quiet!

773
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:31,271
Otherwise he'll know
that you're in there.

774
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:34,274
Do something!

775
00:46:34,274 --> 00:46:37,277
I can't.
He's big and he bites.

776
00:46:37,277 --> 00:46:40,280
Get Jimmy Dale.

777
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,783
Okay, but-but don't come out.

778
00:46:42,783 --> 00:46:45,285
He's right by the door.

779
00:46:47,788 --> 00:46:50,791
(wailing)

780
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:09,810
(honks horn)

781
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:17,317
Getting in some
practice, Luke?

782
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:18,819
Yes, sir.

783
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:21,822
You be careful
you don't bother the Mexicans.

784
00:47:21,822 --> 00:47:24,825
And keep an eye out for
them big, biting black snakes.

785
00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:27,828
That was a good one, Luke.

786
00:47:27,828 --> 00:47:28,829
Served her right.

787
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:31,331
(laughing)

788
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:32,332
You little dickens.

789
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:34,334
Come with me to the Latchers.

790
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:36,837
The Latchers were a family
of sharecroppers

791
00:47:36,837 --> 00:47:39,339
who lived no more than a mile
from our house.

792
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:43,343
Their rundown shack contained
a horde of little Latchers.

793
00:47:43,844 --> 00:47:45,345
They had no electricity.

794
00:47:45,345 --> 00:47:49,349
Mom's delivery was one part
kindness and one part gossip.

795
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:50,350
Hello, Mrs. Chandler.

796
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,852
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

797
00:47:51,852 --> 00:47:53,353
It's... it's Libby.

798
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:54,855
She's about to have the baby.

799
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:55,355
A baby?

800
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:57,357
Yes. She's in labor.

801
00:47:57,357 --> 00:47:59,860
Well, we better
get the doctor.

802
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,361
Oh, no, we can't do that.

803
00:48:01,862 --> 00:48:03,864
No one can know about this;
no one.

804
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:05,866
We've got to keep it quiet.

805
00:48:05,866 --> 00:48:06,867
We're so ashamed.

806
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:08,869
She won't tell us
who the father is

807
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:10,871
and right now, I don't care.

808
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:13,874
If the doctor comes,
the whole county will know.

809
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:16,376
We got to keep this quiet,
Mrs. Chandler, please.

810
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:17,377
Can you promise me?

811
00:48:17,377 --> 00:48:20,881
I'll get Gran. She's
done this many times.

812
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:23,383
Please do.

813
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:24,885
And hurry.

814
00:48:24,885 --> 00:48:26,887
I'll back in
half an hour.

815
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,892
(starts engine)

816
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:34,394
(mooing)

817
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:44,905
GRAN:
We have to get these
in the truck, Miguel.

818
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:55,415
KATHLEEN: Miguel, please tell
Jesse to watch Luke.

819
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:56,917
Si, senora.

820
00:49:03,423 --> 00:49:05,926
Mom and Gran
were up to something,

821
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:07,427
but I didn't know what.

822
00:49:07,427 --> 00:49:10,430
I saw Tally
over at the water pump

823
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,935
and decided we could
figure it out together.

824
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:20,440
Luke... what are you doing?

825
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,943
Promise you won't tell?

826
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,944
Promise.

827
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:30,450
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
And storm clouds gathering in
the northern part of the state

828
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,953
moving at a south-southeasterly
direction, so we can see...

829
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,961
(girl crying and groaning)

830
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:48,468
Mama!

831
00:49:50,971 --> 00:49:53,974
(girl panting)

832
00:49:56,476 --> 00:49:58,478
(girl crying and groaning)

833
00:49:58,478 --> 00:50:00,480
(grunting, screaming)

834
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,983
KATHLEEN: Mr. Latcher, you
got those towels?

835
00:50:02,983 --> 00:50:04,985
Here you go, ma'am.

836
00:50:04,985 --> 00:50:06,486
Thank you.

837
00:50:06,486 --> 00:50:09,489
GRAN:
Breathe. Breathe.

838
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:10,490
Okay, we're ready?

839
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:11,491
Water!

840
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:13,493
Push now, push. Push. Push.

841
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:14,494
GRAN:
There it is!

842
00:50:14,494 --> 00:50:15,996
Good, good.

843
00:50:15,996 --> 00:50:16,997
Good girl.

844
00:50:16,997 --> 00:50:19,499
You're doing fine, honey.

845
00:50:19,499 --> 00:50:20,500
Only a couple more now.

846
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,503
Good girl.
Rest now, rest.

847
00:50:23,503 --> 00:50:25,505
(girl panting)

848
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:34,014
Wait, wait, wait...
wait till I tell you.

849
00:50:34,014 --> 00:50:36,016
Okay now, push. Push!

850
00:50:36,016 --> 00:50:38,518
GRAN: Push, push.

851
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:40,020
(girl screaming)

852
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,521
GRAN: It's coming.

853
00:50:41,521 --> 00:50:43,523
It's coming. It's doing great.

854
00:50:44,024 --> 00:50:46,026
Good. Good girl.

855
00:50:46,026 --> 00:50:49,029
It's a boy!

856
00:50:49,029 --> 00:50:52,032
(baby crying)

857
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:01,541
Here's your baby.

858
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,543
Congratulations.

859
00:51:05,545 --> 00:51:09,049
LUKE:
Ma, better come and see this.

860
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,053
Mmm, still fresh.

861
00:51:13,053 --> 00:51:14,554
Someone's paintin' our house.

862
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:16,056
You know, I bet it's Trot.

863
00:51:16,056 --> 00:51:18,058
He's the only one
who has the time

864
00:51:18,058 --> 00:51:20,060
and he's here by
the house all day

865
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,061
with nothing to do.

866
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:23,063
Wonder why he'd
do such a thing?

867
00:51:25,565 --> 00:51:27,567
Where'd he get the paint?

868
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:29,069
It's a mystery.

869
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:41,581
(wind whistling)

870
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:53,093
(roaring)

871
00:51:53,093 --> 00:51:56,096
Everybody in the house!

872
00:51:56,596 --> 00:51:59,599
Kath! Kath! Get him!

873
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,601
Luke, come on.

874
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:03,103
Let's go!

875
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:05,605
Let's go!

876
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:11,611
(all shouting)

877
00:52:24,624 --> 00:52:26,126
Hurry, Luke!

878
00:52:27,627 --> 00:52:29,629
Hurry!

879
00:52:42,142 --> 00:52:43,643
Tornados were common
in our part of Arkansas

880
00:52:43,643 --> 00:52:46,646
and I'd heard many stories
about them.

881
00:52:46,646 --> 00:52:49,149
We watched the funnel
in muted fascination,

882
00:52:49,149 --> 00:52:50,650
and as suddenly as it appeared,

883
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,152
it was gone.

884
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,113
(distant thump)

885
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,116
After three days
of peace and hard work,

886
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:09,119
I was awakened
in the middle of the night.

887
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,620
I crept toward my window

888
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,622
and peered
through the darkness.

889
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:19,629
(thump)

890
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,636
And there was Hank,
still angry and determined

891
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,639
to torment Cowboy
and the other Mexicans.

892
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:33,643
(thunder rumbles)

893
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,658
COWBOY (half-whispers):
Me gustas mucho.

894
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,663
I like you very much.

895
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,665
TALLY: Me gustas mucho.

896
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,167
(giggles)

897
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,668
COWBOY: Tu tambien.

898
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:00,670
What does that mean?

899
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,671
You, too.

900
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,174
(both giggling)

901
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,675
Eres muy bonita.

902
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,177
What does that mean?

903
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:11,681
You are very beautiful.

904
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,682
(giggling)

905
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:14,184
You think I'm beautiful?

906
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,685
Quieres ser mi novia?

907
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,687
(Tally giggles)

908
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,191
COWBOY: Sweetheart?

909
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:32,702
Mom?

910
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:33,703
Mm-hmm?

911
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,205
There's something
I need to tell you.

912
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,706
What is it?

913
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,709
I think Tally and Cowboy
like each other.

914
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,211
Oh, really?

915
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,213
Now, how do
you know this?

916
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,717
I caught them
in the cotton patch.

917
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,719
What were they doing?

918
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:50,720
I don't know.

919
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,722
But they were together.

920
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:55,225
Do you think
they were kissing?

921
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,227
Probably.

922
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,229
Oh, well.

923
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,731
I'll talk to your father about it.

924
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,751
Hi, girls.

925
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,753
Hi, Mrs. Chandler.

926
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,760
MRS. LATCHER:
Hi, Mrs. Chandler. Hi, Luke.

927
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:31,761
Hey!

928
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,763
Howdy.

929
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,265
Thank you very much.

930
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:36,266
Oh, you're welcome.

931
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:37,267
Mrs. Chandler.

932
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,268
How's the baby?

933
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,269
Oh, he's fine.

934
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:40,270
Good.

935
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,771
I-I guess
you want to see him.

936
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:43,773
Yes, I would.

937
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,289
Luke?

938
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,791
Howdy, Percy.

939
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,793
We're going to whoop
your behind, Luke.

940
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:05,295
Why?

941
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,796
'Cause you're a Chandler,

942
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,298
and your Ricky did that
to Libby.

943
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,799
It wasn'tmyfault.

944
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,804
(grunts)

945
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,321
Stop!

946
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,322
What in the world?!

947
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:33,823
Elijah!

948
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,827
Luke, are you
all right, honey?

949
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,329
Cut me a switch!

950
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,831
What do you mean, beating up
on a little boy like that?

951
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,333
He ain't done nothing!

952
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,834
I want you to watch this.

953
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,836
No, Darla, we're leaving.

954
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:49,339
What was that all about?

955
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,341
For what Ricky did to Libby.

956
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:52,842
We don't know that for sure.

957
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,845
(switch whipping, boys yelling)

958
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:05,855
♪Ay ay ay-ay♪

959
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:09,859
♪Canta y no llores♪

960
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:13,863
♪Porque cantando se alegran...♪

961
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:14,864
Si, Senor...

962
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,371
You're not going to believe
what happened.

963
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:24,374
Three of them jumped Luke,
the little criminals.

964
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,377
We're taking food over, and
they pull a stunt like this.

965
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,879
Three. You didn't
run away, did you?

966
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,381
No, he did not.

967
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,884
He was kicking and clawing
just as much as they were.

968
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,387
Hey, you land a good punch?

969
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:38,388
They were all crying when I left.

970
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,390
HANK: You say there were
three of them, huh?

971
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:43,393
Well, good for you, boy.
It'll make you tough.

972
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,895
GRAN: Well, I think
it's broken.

973
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,897
You okay, Luke?

974
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:48,898
Yep.

975
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:49,899
Come on.

976
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,901
Let's get you
out of those muddy clothes.

977
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:52,902
Aw, no.
Come on, champ.

978
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,404
Come on over there.

979
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:55,405
Yeah!

980
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,407
All right.

981
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,408
Yeah!

982
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,909
(cheering)

983
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,912
(chanting): iViva Luke! iViva Luke!

984
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,914
iViva Luke! iViva Luke!

985
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,423
(sheep bleating)

986
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,426
Where you going?

987
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,428
I don't know.

988
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,429
Just walking.

989
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,431
Going to the creek?

990
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,435
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

991
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,436
(giggles)

992
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,437
Not this time.

993
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:29,439
I'm-I'm not bathing.

994
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,441
It's just to sit on.

995
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,446
(cow mooing)

996
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:38,948
(hammering)

997
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,966
Jesse, how much
did Hank pick today?

998
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:57,967
Under 200.

999
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,469
I'd say 190.

1000
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:02,972
He was picking 400 a week ago.

1001
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:06,476
I've got a good mind
to drive into town tomorrow.

1002
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,978
Find Stick Powers, tell him
I'm done with the boy.

1003
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:09,979
Mexicans are saying

1004
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:11,481
somebody's still throwing rocks

1005
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:12,482
at the barn at night.

1006
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,984
Well, it seems to me,
the thing to do

1007
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,488
is tell Mr. Spruill
that Stick is coming after Hank.

1008
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,990
Let the boy sneak away at night.

1009
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,493
He'll be gone.
That's all that matters.

1010
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,996
Mr. Spruill will be thankful

1011
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:29,499
you kept him
from gettin' arrested.

1012
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:50,019
Pappy, we done
passed the Co-op.

1013
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,522
Mr. Watson wants to see you.

1014
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:53,523
(cheering)

1015
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,024
Hey, Luke,
come here.

1016
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:58,027
I want to show you
something, boy.

1017
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,529
(indistinct voices)

1018
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,533
Come on!

1019
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:04,534
It's the World Series.

1020
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,536
ANNOUNCER:
I don't have to tell you...

1021
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:09,038
Game Three, Dodgers
at Yankee Stadium.

1022
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:12,542
...what a big game this is
for these crosstown rivals.

1023
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,544
Who you pullin' for?

1024
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:16,045
I don't know.

1025
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,547
Dodgers, I guess.

1026
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:21,050
You always got to pull
for the National League.

1027
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,552
Here's the windup...
and the pitch.

1028
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:25,555
Wow, he got
under all of that one...

1029
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:26,556
Hey!

1030
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,558
Farther...

1031
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,059
Yeah!
Yeah!

1032
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,061
It's drifting back, back...

1033
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:33,062
Yes, home run.

1034
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:34,564
That's right.

1035
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,064
(cheering)

1036
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,566
I'll be danged.

1037
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:47,577
Had some heavy rains
up in North County last night.

1038
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,578
Six inches or more.

1039
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:51,080
Ain't no tellin'
when they're gonna be able

1040
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,582
to get a wagon
in them fields.

1041
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:56,085
My cousin in Oklahoma
got flooded out.

1042
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:59,589
We ain't had a flood in October
in 20 years.

1043
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:00,590
Hey, Luke.

1044
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,091
Hey, Tally.

1045
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,595
I just saw the World Series...
on a television.

1046
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:09,098
I'm going to have a television 
of my own someday.

1047
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,100
What's the paint for?

1048
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,602
Oh, nothing.

1049
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,604
(snickering)

1050
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,610
Let's go, Luke.

1051
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:26,115
JESSE: Stick tells me he's
coming out here to take Hank.

1052
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:27,116
Well, I'll talk to him.

1053
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:28,117
All right.

1054
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,620
Probably be better
if he heads out.

1055
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,121
All right.

1056
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,123
Well, like I say, I'll talk to him.

1057
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,629
How'd he take it?

1058
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:42,632
Well, they need
the money.

1059
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,134
They say that old Sheriff
Stick's coming to get you.

1060
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:48,137
I ain't afraid of
that dumb sheriff.

1061
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,639
But you don't want
to get arrested.

1062
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,140
I didn't
do nothing.

1063
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,142
The Chandlers
want you to leave.

1064
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,144
Aw, I got more
money in my pocket

1065
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:57,647
than them sodbusters
will ever have.

1066
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,649
Just go on back
home now, son.

1067
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:00,650
Let things cool down.

1068
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,151
Go on. I'll deal
with this.

1069
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,153
All right, I'll leave.

1070
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,689
(giggling)

1071
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,194
What's going on here?

1072
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:50,199
None of your business, Hank.

1073
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,201
Go home.

1074
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:54,704
You heard him.

1075
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:56,205
Get on out of here,

1076
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,207
or I'll tell Ma and Pa
what you're doing.

1077
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,709
Go home.

1078
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,713
Come on up here, brown skin.

1079
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:06,215
I'm fixin'
to teach you something.

1080
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:13,723
Now I'm going to settle
your hash once and for all.

1081
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,730
You like my sister,Mexicano?

1082
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,731
Huh?

1083
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:26,736
(grunts)

1084
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,240
You're a slippery
little wetback, ain't ya?

1085
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,744
(yells)

1086
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,284
(switchblade clicking)

1087
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:16,786
(groans)

1088
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,305
(yells)

1089
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:28,357
Come here.

1090
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,361
Shh.

1091
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,863
Silence.

1092
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,865
You been to the river?

1093
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:39,368
Then where have you been?

1094
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,372
You speak one word
of this to anyone,

1095
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:44,874
and I will
kill your mother.

1096
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:48,878
Understand?!

1097
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:52,882
No matter--
you tell them next year,

1098
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:55,384
you tell them when I'm gone,

1099
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:58,888
I will come back,
and I will kill your mother.

1100
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:11,400
JESSE: You okay, Luke?

1101
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,402
Didn't eat enough
to feed a bird.

1102
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:16,405
Just tired.

1103
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,909
Tonight you go
to bed early, okay?

1104
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,413
(sighs)

1105
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,419
Any reason the truck
would be gone?

1106
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:31,921
Say what?

1107
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:35,925
The truck's gone.

1108
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:37,426
I left it right here.

1109
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,928
MR. SPRUILL: Tally!

1110
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:40,429
Where was the key?

1111
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:41,430
On the radio,

1112
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,932
same as always.

1113
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:43,933
We lost Tally.

1114
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,935
I can't find her no place.

1115
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:48,437
Could she drive a truck?

1116
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:49,939
No, she can't. What?

1117
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:52,441
Don't suppose Hank took it.

1118
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:53,943
Hank would not steal
your truck.

1119
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:55,444
Hank's halfway home by now.

1120
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:59,448
We better go check
the barn for Cowboy.

1121
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:01,951
Morning, Miguel.

1122
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:02,952
Senor.

1123
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:03,953
Is there a problem?

1124
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,955
Si, senor,a little problem.

1125
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:06,956
What is it?

1126
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,457
Cowboy is gone.

1127
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:09,959
Must be contagious.

1128
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,460
You think he took her?

1129
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,962
I don't know what to think.

1130
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:14,964
He took my baby?

1131
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,465
We need to get the law
into this.

1132
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:17,466
I'm going to go
unhook the truck

1133
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:18,467
from the tent.

1134
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,969
Jesse will go with you.

1135
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,470
Go on, son.

1136
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:28,978
No, Luke, honey.

1137
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:30,980
It's not your place.

1138
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:57,506
When the weather didn't let up,
Pappy got concerned

1139
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,009
that the rain
would swell the river.

1140
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:01,510
We'd be flooded out.

1141
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,521
But there was
a secret part of me

1142
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,524
that prayed the riverwouldrise

1143
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,027
and wash everything away.

1144
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:50,559
We'll check it later.

1145
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,601
Found it in
the bus station

1146
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:34,103
over in Jonesboro.

1147
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,104
Where's the key?

1148
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:36,105
Under the seat.

1149
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:37,606
And it had
a full tank of gas.

1150
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:40,109
I don't know if it had
a full one when it left here,

1151
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:41,110
but it's full now.

1152
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,111
It was half empty.

1153
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,613
They must have just
borrowed it.

1154
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:46,115
That's the way I see it.

1155
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,117
You still want
to press charges?

1156
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:50,119
I guess not.

1157
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:54,123
Did anybody see 'em?

1158
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:57,126
They bought two tickets
to Chicago.

1159
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,127
When the bus got loaded,

1160
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,129
they both got on
and sat together.

1161
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:03,132
MR. SPRUILL:
What time the bus leave?

1162
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,134
6:00 this morning.

1163
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:08,137
Found this on the front seat.

1164
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,639
It's a note from Tally to y'all.

1165
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,641
I ain't read it.

1166
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,146
Ain't none of my
business, ma'am,

1167
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:21,150
but if there's any useful
information, I need to know.

1168
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:26,655
She says she
ain't comin' home.

1169
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:29,658
She says she and Cowboy
are gettin' married.

1170
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:31,660
Gonna live up north

1171
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,663
where they can find
good jobs and such.

1172
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:37,166
They going to stay
in Chicago?

1173
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,667
Don't say.

1174
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,669
Just says up north.

1175
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:50,679
Well, thanks, Stick, for
bringing the truck back.

1176
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:51,680
Much obliged.

1177
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,183
Oh, ain't nothing.

1178
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,185
Say, Eli.

1179
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:58,687
Where's that big one-- Hank?

1180
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:00,689
He took off for home.

1181
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:04,193
Well, I'm going
to call the sheriff

1182
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,195
up in Eureka Springs.

1183
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,197
I ain't through with him,
you know.

1184
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,199
When I find him,

1185
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,201
I'm going to put him
in the jail in Jonesboro,

1186
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,203
and we're going to have us
that trial.

1187
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,705
Yeah, you do that, Stick.

1188
01:11:25,564 --> 01:11:28,067
Although there were
occasional clear days,

1189
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:30,069
the news was somber
and threatening.

1190
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:32,571
Heavy rains had hit Clay County
north of us.

1191
01:11:32,571 --> 01:11:34,573
The creeks and streams
were flooded up there

1192
01:11:34,573 --> 01:11:36,075
and poured into the river.

1193
01:11:36,075 --> 01:11:40,579
The water was rising.

1194
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:53,592
JESSE: Well, the ground's
too soft.

1195
01:11:53,592 --> 01:11:55,094
Cotton's too wet.

1196
01:11:55,094 --> 01:11:57,596
Guess they've had enough.

1197
01:12:13,112 --> 01:12:14,613
Over here.

1198
01:12:23,122 --> 01:12:26,125
It's for you.

1199
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:30,129
Tally bought it.

1200
01:12:30,129 --> 01:12:33,132
Thanks.

1201
01:13:56,715 --> 01:13:58,217
How am I doing?

1202
01:13:58,217 --> 01:14:00,719
Ah, it's beautiful, Luke.

1203
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,722
Just go slow
and take your time.

1204
01:14:05,224 --> 01:14:06,725
And don't fall.

1205
01:14:06,725 --> 01:14:08,227
I'm not gonna fall.

1206
01:14:26,745 --> 01:14:30,249
We picked near 1,100
pounds between us.

1207
01:14:30,249 --> 01:14:33,752
The rains start
to drive the prices up.

1208
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:36,255
Yeah, a few more dry
days, we're clear.

1209
01:14:36,255 --> 01:14:39,758
(thunder rumbling)

1210
01:14:43,762 --> 01:14:46,265
(speaking Spanish)

1211
01:14:48,267 --> 01:14:51,770
JESSE: Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke,
come on.

1212
01:15:46,325 --> 01:15:48,327
The rains had forced us all

1213
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:50,829
to kill long hours
in and around the house.

1214
01:15:50,829 --> 01:15:54,333
Even on days when the sun tried
to break through the clouds,

1215
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:57,836
the cotton was too wet
and the ground was too soft.

1216
01:15:57,836 --> 01:16:00,339
The Mexicans were delighted
to have something to do,

1217
01:16:00,339 --> 01:16:02,841
and we all attacked
the unpainted house

1218
01:16:02,841 --> 01:16:04,343
with a vengeance.

1219
01:16:54,893 --> 01:16:58,897
Pappy,
if I told you a secret,

1220
01:16:59,398 --> 01:17:02,901
would you promise
not to tell anybody else?

1221
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:05,904
Let's try it out.

1222
01:17:08,407 --> 01:17:11,410
Hank is dead.

1223
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:13,412
Cowboy killed him.

1224
01:17:13,412 --> 01:17:15,414
With that knife of his.

1225
01:17:15,414 --> 01:17:17,416
I saw it all.

1226
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:21,420
Hank saw Cowboy
and Tally together.

1227
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,422
(sighs)

1228
01:17:23,422 --> 01:17:25,424
Tally see this, too?

1229
01:17:25,424 --> 01:17:27,926
No, sir.

1230
01:17:28,427 --> 01:17:30,429
Cowboy sent her away.

1231
01:17:33,932 --> 01:17:36,435
They fought at the bridge.

1232
01:17:36,435 --> 01:17:38,937
Hank landed in the middle
of the river,

1233
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:41,440
and he never came back up.

1234
01:17:43,942 --> 01:17:46,445
You should have
told me then.

1235
01:17:46,445 --> 01:17:48,447
I just couldn't.

1236
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:50,449
Cowboy see you?

1237
01:17:54,453 --> 01:17:56,955
What are we gonna do, Pappy?

1238
01:17:56,955 --> 01:17:58,457
(sighs)

1239
01:17:58,457 --> 01:18:02,961
Killed their son and stole
their daughter. My, oh, my.

1240
01:18:05,464 --> 01:18:07,466
Are we gonna tell anybody?

1241
01:18:09,968 --> 01:18:13,472
Nope, I don't think so.

1242
01:18:13,472 --> 01:18:16,475
Nothing we can say is
gonna bring that boy back,

1243
01:18:16,475 --> 01:18:18,477
and tellin' folks
will just...

1244
01:18:18,477 --> 01:18:20,979
make a fuss
none of us need.

1245
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,984
Well, what about
Mr. and Mrs. Spruill?

1246
01:18:27,986 --> 01:18:30,489
It'll only hurt
them if they knew.

1247
01:18:30,489 --> 01:18:32,991
We ain't tellin' nobody.

1248
01:18:32,991 --> 01:18:35,494
Just be our secret--

1249
01:18:35,994 --> 01:18:40,499
one we'll take to our
graves, just you and me.

1250
01:18:40,499 --> 01:18:44,503
But you done right
telling me.

1251
01:18:44,503 --> 01:18:48,507
Don't you worry none.
I'll handle this.

1252
01:18:48,507 --> 01:18:53,011
Hey, don't worry.

1253
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:55,514
I'll handle it.

1254
01:18:57,516 --> 01:19:01,019
It's over the banks.

1255
01:19:01,019 --> 01:19:02,521
(sighs)

1256
01:19:02,521 --> 01:19:04,523
It's floodin'.

1257
01:19:23,542 --> 01:19:26,044
Four cans of paint
coming right up.

1258
01:19:26,044 --> 01:19:28,046
That's not enough.

1259
01:19:28,046 --> 01:19:29,548
That'll do for now.

1260
01:19:29,548 --> 01:19:34,052
That'll be, uh, ten dollars
plus tax of 36 cents.

1261
01:19:34,052 --> 01:19:38,056
Well, looks like I just
brought ten with me.

1262
01:19:38,056 --> 01:19:40,058
I'll bring in the tax next time.

1263
01:19:40,058 --> 01:19:41,560
Well, sure, Jesse.

1264
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,562
Let me go talk to Riggs.

1265
01:19:43,562 --> 01:19:46,064
You help Mr. Watson put
this paint in the truck.

1266
01:19:46,064 --> 01:19:47,566
I'll be back
in a few minutes.

1267
01:19:48,567 --> 01:19:50,569
How much is two gallons?

1268
01:19:50,569 --> 01:19:54,573
$2.50 a gallon.

1269
01:19:54,573 --> 01:19:56,074
Total of five dollars.

1270
01:20:00,579 --> 01:20:02,581
Here's five.

1271
01:20:02,581 --> 01:20:05,083
You pick cotton
for that money?

1272
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:07,085
Yes, sir.

1273
01:20:07,085 --> 01:20:10,088
Does your daddy know
you're buying paint?

1274
01:20:10,088 --> 01:20:11,590
Not yet.

1275
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:13,091
What are y'all
painting out there?

1276
01:20:13,091 --> 01:20:14,593
Our house.

1277
01:20:14,593 --> 01:20:16,094
But why're you doing that?

1278
01:20:16,094 --> 01:20:19,097
'Cause it ain't never
been painted before.

1279
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,603
Plus 18 cents for tax,
you got that?

1280
01:20:24,603 --> 01:20:27,105
How much does my daddy
owe you for tax?

1281
01:20:27,105 --> 01:20:28,607
36 cents.

1282
01:20:28,607 --> 01:20:31,610
Take it from this.

1283
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:33,612
All right.

1284
01:20:33,612 --> 01:20:35,614
(cash register rings)

1285
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:03,642
It's a very good job, Luke.

1286
01:21:03,642 --> 01:21:05,143
How much paint is left?

1287
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:08,146
None. It's all gone.

1288
01:21:08,146 --> 01:21:10,148
How much do you need
to paint the front?

1289
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:14,653
Reckon four or five gallons.

1290
01:21:14,653 --> 01:21:18,156
I don't want you to spend
your own money on paint.

1291
01:21:18,156 --> 01:21:19,157
It'smymoney.

1292
01:21:19,157 --> 01:21:21,660
Y'all said I could spend
it on whatever I wanted.

1293
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,663
What about your jacket?

1294
01:21:24,663 --> 01:21:28,166
Maybe Santa Claus
will bring me one.

1295
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:30,168
(laughing): Oh, maybe so.

1296
01:21:30,168 --> 01:21:32,170
You ready for some lunch?

1297
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:33,171
Yep.

1298
01:21:33,171 --> 01:21:34,673
All right.

1299
01:21:39,177 --> 01:21:43,181
Backwaters trickling across the
main road into the back forty.

1300
01:22:06,204 --> 01:22:07,706
(sighs)

1301
01:22:07,706 --> 01:22:09,207
Miguel...

1302
01:22:09,207 --> 01:22:11,710
tragueme todos muchachos.

1303
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:12,711
Muchachos.

1304
01:22:12,711 --> 01:22:14,713
PAPPY:
Todos hombres, aqui.

1305
01:22:17,716 --> 01:22:21,720
PAPPY:
Marque lina para agua,
por favor.

1306
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:24,222
MIGUEL:
Una fila marquando
donde termina la agua.

1307
01:22:24,222 --> 01:22:26,224
It's here.

1308
01:22:26,224 --> 01:22:27,726
Two inches of it.

1309
01:22:55,253 --> 01:22:57,255
Cotton's wet.

1310
01:22:57,255 --> 01:23:02,260
The sun breaks, we maybe
can get a hundred pounds each.

1311
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:06,264
Jesse, go on into town,
check on the Co-op,

1312
01:23:06,264 --> 01:23:08,266
see if there's another farm

1313
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:10,268
where the Mexicans
might get work.

1314
01:23:20,779 --> 01:23:22,781
GRAN:
This cotton's soaking wet.

1315
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:24,783
They're not gonna get 50 pounds.

1316
01:23:24,783 --> 01:23:25,784
It's a waste of time.

1317
01:23:25,784 --> 01:23:27,786
LUKE: Can I go to town?

1318
01:23:27,786 --> 01:23:30,789
KATHLEEN: Well, yeah.

1319
01:23:30,789 --> 01:23:32,791
We need more paint.

1320
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:36,795
GRAN: What foolishness, spending
good money on house paint

1321
01:23:36,795 --> 01:23:38,797
when we're losing
another crop!

1322
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:40,799
Can't leave the house
half-and-half.

1323
01:23:40,799 --> 01:23:42,801
We've got to finish
the job.

1324
01:23:42,801 --> 01:23:46,304
No mas trabajo aqui.

1325
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,807
Lo siento.

1326
01:23:48,807 --> 01:23:51,309
Si, senor.

1327
01:23:54,312 --> 01:23:57,816
(thunder rolling)

1328
01:24:02,821 --> 01:24:04,322
I have a secret for you.

1329
01:24:04,322 --> 01:24:07,826
Can you keep a secret?

1330
01:24:07,826 --> 01:24:08,827
Sure.

1331
01:24:09,327 --> 01:24:12,330
Your daddy and I are thinking
about going up north.

1332
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:13,832
What about me?

1333
01:24:14,332 --> 01:24:15,834
Why, you're going, too.

1334
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:18,837
What about Pappy and Gran?

1335
01:24:19,337 --> 01:24:21,339
They're gonna be okay.

1336
01:24:23,341 --> 01:24:26,344
It's gonna be exciting, Luke.
Trust me.

1337
01:24:26,344 --> 01:24:27,846
It'll be an adventure.

1338
01:24:29,848 --> 01:24:31,349
Okay?

1339
01:24:37,355 --> 01:24:39,357
Get in that bed.

1340
01:24:44,362 --> 01:24:45,864
Night.

1341
01:24:45,864 --> 01:24:47,365
Night.

1342
01:25:08,386 --> 01:25:10,388
Reckon it's safe?

1343
01:25:10,388 --> 01:25:11,890
(sighs)

1344
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:13,892

Ice cream.

1357
01:25:40,418 --> 01:25:41,419
A sundae for the boy, Cindy.

1358
01:25:41,419 --> 01:25:44,422
Y'all pickin' out there?

1359
01:25:44,422 --> 01:25:46,424
Well, creek came over
last night.

1360
01:25:46,424 --> 01:25:49,427
Moved more than half
a mile before sunrise.

1361
01:25:49,427 --> 01:25:50,929
Lower forty's gone.

1362
01:25:50,929 --> 01:25:53,932
Yeah, all the creeks
are backing up.

1363
01:25:53,932 --> 01:25:57,435
Just... putting a lot of
pressure on the St. Francis.

1364
01:25:57,435 --> 01:25:59,437
You know someone who
needs any Mexicans?

1365
01:25:59,437 --> 01:26:01,439
I got six of them now
with nothing to do.

1366
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:02,941
Ready to go home.

1367
01:26:02,941 --> 01:26:05,944
Yeah, I think Riggs
might know some farmers

1368
01:26:05,944 --> 01:26:07,946
up north of Blytheville.

1369
01:26:07,946 --> 01:26:09,447
They might take 'em.

1370
01:26:09,447 --> 01:26:11,950
Thanks, Jackie.

1371
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:12,951
Mm-hmm.

1372
01:26:52,423 --> 01:26:57,929
I had another dream last night
that Ricky came home.

1373
01:26:57,929 --> 01:26:59,430
It was windy,

1374
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:03,434
and he was standing
out in the road in the wind,

1375
01:27:03,434 --> 01:27:06,938
and he made it
just in time for Christmas.

1376
01:27:09,941 --> 01:27:11,943
(knocking on door)

1377
01:27:20,952 --> 01:27:22,453
Mr. Latcher.

1378
01:27:22,453 --> 01:27:26,457
LATCHER: Excuse me, ma'am,
I need to speak to Mr. Chandler.

1379
01:27:26,457 --> 01:27:28,960
Oh, he's in the barn.
What is it?

1380
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,963
We've been flooded out.

1381
01:27:31,963 --> 01:27:34,966
Water's up past the porch
and in the house.

1382
01:27:34,966 --> 01:27:36,968
Can you help us?

1383
01:27:36,968 --> 01:27:38,970
We ain't got no place to go.

1384
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:39,971
Of course we can help.

1385
01:27:39,971 --> 01:27:41,472
You folks can stay here.

1386
01:27:41,472 --> 01:27:43,975
The loft is clean.
The Mexicans just left.

1387
01:27:43,975 --> 01:27:46,477
You'll have a warm bed
and plenty of food.

1388
01:27:46,477 --> 01:27:47,478
Let's get a move on.

1389
01:27:47,478 --> 01:27:48,980
We'll get the loft ready.

1390
01:27:54,986 --> 01:27:56,487
Come on.
Let's go get dry.

1391
01:27:56,487 --> 01:27:57,989
Come on, honey.

1392
01:27:57,989 --> 01:28:00,491
Now, after you get dressed,
you run down to the kitchen

1393
01:28:00,491 --> 01:28:03,494
and get something to eat.

1394
01:28:03,494 --> 01:28:05,997
They ain't much,
but they're dry.

1395
01:28:05,997 --> 01:28:09,500
Some of them have been in
the family for generations.

1396
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:13,004
(baby crying)

1397
01:28:16,507 --> 01:28:18,009
What's his name?

1398
01:28:18,009 --> 01:28:20,511
Don't have one yet.

1399
01:28:20,511 --> 01:28:24,015
When's Ricky coming home?

1400
01:28:24,015 --> 01:28:25,516
I don't know.

1401
01:28:25,516 --> 01:28:28,519
(crying continues)

1402
01:28:28,519 --> 01:28:30,521
Shh...

1403
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:32,523
(crying)

1404
01:28:36,027 --> 01:28:38,529
Did you say good-bye
to the Mexicans?

1405
01:28:38,529 --> 01:28:40,031
Yes, ma'am.

1406
01:28:40,031 --> 01:28:42,033
Does that mean we're
done pickin' cotton?

1407
01:28:42,033 --> 01:28:44,035
Sure looks like it.

1408
01:28:45,536 --> 01:28:48,039
Why does our land
flood so quick?

1409
01:28:48,039 --> 01:28:52,543
Because... it's low and...

1410
01:28:52,543 --> 01:28:54,045
close to the river.

1411
01:28:54,045 --> 01:28:56,047
It's just not
very good land, Luke.

1412
01:28:56,047 --> 01:28:58,549
That's one reason
why we're leaving here.

1413
01:28:58,549 --> 01:29:00,551
How long we gonna be
up north?

1414
01:29:00,551 --> 01:29:03,054
Not long.

1415
01:29:03,054 --> 01:29:06,057
We'll stay until
we save some money.

1416
01:29:06,057 --> 01:29:09,060
When we come back,
what are we going to do?

1417
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,561
Well...

1418
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:12,563
we're not gonna farm.

1419
01:29:13,564 --> 01:29:17,568
We'll get a job in Memphis
or Little Rock,

1420
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:20,071
and we'll buy us a house

1421
01:29:20,071 --> 01:29:22,573
with a television

1422
01:29:22,573 --> 01:29:25,576
and a telephone.

1423
01:29:25,576 --> 01:29:27,578
And we'll have a nice car
in the driveway,

1424
01:29:27,578 --> 01:29:29,080
and you can play baseball

1425
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,581
on a team
that has real uniforms.

1426
01:29:30,581 --> 01:29:31,582
How does that sound to you?

1427
01:29:31,582 --> 01:29:33,584
Sounds pretty good.

1428
01:29:33,584 --> 01:29:35,586
(cow moos in distance)

1429
01:29:35,586 --> 01:29:41,092
We'll always come back and visit
Pappy and Gran and Ricky, but...

1430
01:29:41,092 --> 01:29:43,094
it'll be a new life, Luke.

1431
01:29:50,601 --> 01:29:53,104
PAPPY: The crop loans
can be rolled over

1432
01:29:53,104 --> 01:29:54,605
till next spring.

1433
01:29:54,605 --> 01:29:56,607
The other bills
can be put off, too.

1434
01:29:56,607 --> 01:30:00,611
I hate the thought of riding those
I owe, but...

1435
01:30:00,611 --> 01:30:02,613
How do we get through
the winter?

1436
01:30:02,613 --> 01:30:04,615
We got plenty of food, but...

1437
01:30:04,615 --> 01:30:07,118
what about gasoline and...

1438
01:30:07,118 --> 01:30:09,620
electricity and oil for the truck?

1439
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:11,622
Well...

1440
01:30:11,622 --> 01:30:14,125
about a third of the crop
is still out there

1441
01:30:14,125 --> 01:30:15,626
standing in water.

1442
01:30:15,626 --> 01:30:18,629
Weather breaks, we might be able
to salvage a bit of it.

1443
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:20,631
That'll get us some money.

1444
01:30:20,631 --> 01:30:23,134
The gin'll take most of that.

1445
01:30:25,636 --> 01:30:27,138
Jimmy Dale...

1446
01:30:27,638 --> 01:30:30,641
is holding a job for me
at the Buick plant.

1447
01:30:32,143 --> 01:30:34,645
But he can't wait long.

1448
01:30:34,645 --> 01:30:37,148
Jobs are tight right now, so...

1449
01:30:37,148 --> 01:30:39,150
we need to get on up there.

1450
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:41,652
He says I can make
as much as $200 a week.

1451
01:30:41,652 --> 01:30:44,155
We'll send home
as much as we can.

1452
01:30:45,656 --> 01:30:49,160
But we got to leave...
day after tomorrow.

1453
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:57,668
Eat your food, son.

1454
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:25,112
You'll be leaving tomorrow.

1455
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:26,614
Yes, sir.

1456
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:29,617
Should be coming back soon.

1457
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:32,119
Yes, sir.

1458
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:39,126
Been thinking more
about Hank and Cowboy.

1459
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:42,630
Let's leave it be
like we agreed.

1460
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:46,133
Can't nothing good come
from telling nobody.

1461
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:48,135
It's our secret.

1462
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:52,139
Deal?

1463
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,141
Deal.

1464
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:01,649
Don't forget about your
pappy up there, you hear?

1465
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:03,651
I won't.

1466
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:21,168
MAN (over radio):
Bugle-blowing,
Chinese Communist troops

1467
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:24,171
hurled 14 separate attacks
at United Nations forces...

1468
01:32:24,672 --> 01:32:28,676
(baby crying) Oh, come here.

1469
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:30,177
Shh, shh, shh.

1470
01:32:30,678 --> 01:32:33,180
Meanwhile,
Allied fliers swarmed low

1471
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:36,183
along western and central
sectors on the front,

1472
01:32:36,183 --> 01:32:38,185
in close-support forays.

1473
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:41,188
They reported knocking out
close to 50 Communist bunkers

1474
01:32:41,188 --> 01:32:43,691
and killing 58 of the enemy.

1475
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:46,694
Elsewhere, surface...

1476
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:48,696
Luke, I've written Ricky a letter

1477
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:50,698
telling him all about the baby.

1478
01:32:50,698 --> 01:32:52,700
Do you have his address?

1479
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,201
Yeah, I got it.

1480
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:56,704
Do you have an envelope?

1481
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,206
Sure.

1482
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:01,208
Could you mail my letter for me?

1483
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:04,712
Please, Luke. I don't think
Ricky knows about the baby.

1484
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:08,215
I guess I can mail it.

1485
01:33:08,215 --> 01:33:10,217
Thank you, Luke.

1486
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,724
(baby continues crying)

1487
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:49,757
(sniffles)

1488
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:56,263
Don't come back here
talkin' like a Yankee.

1489
01:34:04,772 --> 01:34:06,774
We're gonna be fine.

1490
01:34:06,774 --> 01:34:08,776
I know.

1491
01:34:09,276 --> 01:34:12,780
(crying): I'm just going to
miss you so much.

1492
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:29,797
Good job, Luke.

1493
01:34:32,299 --> 01:34:34,802
You done a good job.

1494
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:38,305
Just wish we'd finished.

1495
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:41,809
Yeah.

1496
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:45,312
I figure...
another gallon?

1497
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:46,814
Yes, sir.

1498
01:34:46,814 --> 01:34:49,316
That's about right.

1499
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:51,819
I'll get it done this winter.

1500
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:53,821
Thanks, Pappy.

1501
01:34:53,821 --> 01:34:57,324
When y'all come home,
it'll be finished.

1502
01:34:57,324 --> 01:35:00,327
I'd like that.

1503
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:02,830
Let's shake on it.

1504
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:29,356
When we pulled away,
Gran was standing

1505
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:31,358
by the front porch,
wiping her face.

1506
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:33,360
My father told me not to cry,

1507
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,862
but I couldn't help it.

1508
01:35:34,862 --> 01:35:35,863
My heart ached.

1509
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:37,364
But at the same time,

1510
01:35:37,364 --> 01:35:41,368
I knew our adventure
was just beginning.

1511
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:58,385
And I hoped
when I returned one day,

1512
01:35:58,385 --> 01:36:01,388
my Uncle Ricky
would be coming home, too,

1513
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:04,892
just like in Gran's dreams.

1514
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:09,897
We would be
a complete family again.
