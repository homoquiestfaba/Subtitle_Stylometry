1
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,221
Hey! Shut off the hose!

2
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,019
There's a fucking faucet outside, man!
Hurry up!

3
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,451
- Go! God!
- Jesus!

4
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,215
Shit!

5
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,339
- What a piece of shit old house, man.
- Yup, yup.

6
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,220
Fucking thing wasn't even half full.

7
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,419
- Who the hell are you?
- Jake Bradford.

8
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,451
- Infielder?
- Pitcher.

9
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,861
- What?
- Hey!

10
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,501
Just what we need,
another fucking pitcher.

11
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,050
- Not a lefty, are you?
- No, right-handed.

12
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,177
Thank God.

13
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,657
Those guys are always so fucking weird.

14
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,054
- Like Nez. I hate that guy.
- I love Nez.

15
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,094
He's fine. He's just fucking weird.

16
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,740
Hey, I'm just gonna
tell you something right now.

17
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,653
- Yup.
- I hate pitchers, okay?

18
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,220
So you and me will be teammates,

19
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,577
but we're not gonna be friends
or anything like that.

20
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,095
It might give you some kind of edge

21
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,731
if I gotta face you down the line
in pro ball, if you ever make it there.

22
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,936
I'm just not gonna do that.

23
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,096
- All right.
- Those your bags?

24
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,059
- Wanna pick your shit up?
- Yeah. Sorry.

25
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,219
- Excuse me. Bye.
- Yup. Bye.

26
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,457
You know, nobody really realizes
how much water weighs.

27
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,771
You're talking about 62 pounds
per cubic foot.

28
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,011
- Yeah.
- You know, I tried to warn them.

29
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,934
But let's be honest,
that would be fucking amazing

30
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,900
if that fell through the ceiling right now.

31
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,210
Dude, this is a good example

32
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,458
of someone being so invested
in what they want.

33
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,296
In this case, getting laid on
an oversized, overpriced water balloon,

34
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,452
that they fail to see the giant
waterbed-shaped iceberg right in their path.

35
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,817
Or he just finds you
super-annoying and ignores you.

36
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,855
At his own peril, as evidenced by this
ill-fated and ill-advised adventure

37
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,137
in mid-collapse before you...

38
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,011
I assume, being a new teammate.

39
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,531
Thank you, Willoughby. I'm Finn.

40
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,816
Jake.

41
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,133
- Hi. Charlie Willoughby. Hi.
- Jake. Good to meet you.

42
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,621
Nice to meet you.

43
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,137
Did you meet the brain trust
that perpetrated such a folly,

44
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,661
McReynolds and Roper?

45
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,334
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

46
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,980
One of them told me he hated pitchers.

47
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,734
Even his own teammates.

48
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,019
Undoubtedly Glen McReynolds,
resident All-American.

49
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,980
On the field, you know.
Up here, benchwarmer.

50
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,781
Hey. Chapter 9 will blow your mind.

51
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,451
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,531
Guys.

53
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,857
Is it true that our house
is about to fall down?

54
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,934
Yeah, any second.

55
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,340
What's up, man? Jake Bradford.

56
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,333
What's up, dude? Tyrone Plummer.

57
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,016
Man, you can't even
fuck good on a waterbed.

58
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,890
It's like having sex with a girl
on top of another really fat girl,

59
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,176
know what I mean?

60
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,536
- Just moving around.
- Yeah.

61
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,534
- Get out of my shot.
- Sorry, man.

62
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,290
- Shit!
- Shit. Sorry.

63
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,293
What the hell's wrong with you?
You scared the shit out of me.

64
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,372
- Hey, you Billy Autrey?
- Beuter?

65
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,815
Shit, if I was that
pussy-whipped little bitch,

66
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,336
I'd be on the phone
moping to my girlfriend. Why?

67
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,060
I'm just supposed to be rooming with him.

68
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,895
"I'm just..." Damn. Yeah.

69
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,941
Well, shit, if you ever wanna find Beuter,
just follow the phone cord.

70
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,216
- This?
- Yeah, come on.

71
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,372
You're like a lost lamb.

72
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,861
Thanks.

73
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,577
What did I tell you?

74
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,890
Hey, Beuter, this your new roommate.

75
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,415
Damn, put some pants on, man.

76
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,730
- What's up, man?
- Hold on one second, babe.

77
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,971
Jake Bradford.

78
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,661
Jacob? Hey, how you doing?
I'm Billy Autrey.

79
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,892
- Good to meet you, man.
- Good to meet you.

80
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,414
- Dale Douglas.
- Jake Bradford.

81
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,537
Hey, man, what position do you play?

82
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,816
Pitcher.

83
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,652
- What are you?
- Second base.

84
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,421
Hey, I'll see you later, man.

85
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,652
Okay, Jacob. Yeah, we'll see you, man.

86
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,581
Hey, ladies!
Happy hour is upon us at the Fox.

87
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,573
Two hours of drinking
before the team meeting.

88
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,613
- Let's go.
- That's what I'm talking about.

89
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,772
You guys go ahead, man.
I've got some unpacking to do.

90
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,933
Bullshit! You're on the team now, baby!

91
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,299
- Onward, upward and inward! Ja?
- Yeah!

92
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,021
Say hello, Finn.

93
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,895
Look at what we have here.

94
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,495
Well, look at this lovely bunch of ladies.

95
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,537
Let's say hi.

96
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,374
I think we should.

97
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,818
Tits!

98
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,540
- Fuck off, faggots!
- Yeah!

99
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,533
That was beautiful.

100
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,214
I love this time of year.

101
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,772
Party later tonight
at the baseball houses.

102
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,533
- Where?
- 15th and Avenue H.

103
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,533
You know,
just look for two beautiful houses

104
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,533
filled with Greek gods who care.

105
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,659
- Okay, when?
- When you get there.

106
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,655
And when you do get there,
ask for me, Kenny Roper.

107
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,614
We look forward to
seeing all of you there.

108
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,580
All of you.

109
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,491
There we go.

110
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,060
She looks like my fifth grade teacher.

111
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,820
She's built right.

112
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,335
Hey, ladies.

113
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,060
I don't know if you guys
are doing anything tonight,

114
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,258
but we'd like to invite you
to a baseball party with...

115
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,536
Sorry.

116
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,096
Okay.

117
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,776
- Ouch!
- Not my fault she's a bitch.

118
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,933
Jeez, ball hit the mitt
before you ever even swung.

119
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,535
And what was I supposed to do, huh?

120
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,254
You gotta notice the clues, Rope.

121
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,775
There was a typewriter in the back.

122
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,420
- Yeah.
- They're intelligent girls.

123
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,259
You have to rise
and meet them on their level.

124
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,934
Is that right?

125
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,933
Act like you've read a book before. Jeez.

126
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,614
Okay, Finn, you're up.

127
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,454
- Well, I can't do any worse.
- Here we go.

128
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,373
Take notes, boys.

129
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,611
Excuse me, ladies.

130
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,170
You know, I couldn't help but notice
you ladies being hassled

131
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,854
by that asshole in the car back there.

132
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,056
It's a shame.

133
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,734
You know, some guys
are just so aggressive.

134
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,858
Myself, I'm a firm supporter of the ERA...

135
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,699
Although I doubt it's gonna
have an immediate impact

136
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,460
on the societal norm of the male gender,

137
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,613
initiating virtually all contact
with respect to females.

138
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,291
You know, which might seem predatory
on the surface, but I assure you...

139
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,451
Trust me.

140
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,931
You should be investing
this energy elsewhere.

141
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,899
Well, now you just
plain hurt our feelings.

142
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,501
Do you also hate guys
that are athletic, intelligent,

143
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,732
sometimes endearingly clumsy,
or is that just her?

144
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,810
Hey, Finn, did you mention hung?

145
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,130
I didn't mention hung, Dale, not yet.

146
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,735
Okay.

147
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,781
Y'all wanna know the truth?

148
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,456
Always. It'll set you free.

149
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,656
I like the quiet guy in the back seat,

150
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,061
in the middle.

151
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,491
Well, there's nothing here.

152
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,651
Lesbians.

153
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,494
Yeah! Did you guys hear that?

154
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,617
I didn't hear anything.

155
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,658
- Delusional. Freshman's hearing things.
- No, dude.

156
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,693
Quiet, non-asshole guy in the back,
that's me.

157
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,181
Wait, no, guys.

158
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,979
Yeah, no, I think I heard her
say something like,

159
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,018
"The guy in the back,
whether he knows it or not,

160
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,819
"is a cock jockey."

161
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,861
- Yeah, but I heard "cock gobbler."
- Cock gobbler.

162
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,853
I heard, "The guy in the back seat,

163
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,853
"his cock looks like
an outie bellybutton."

164
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,171
- Yeah. Are we mistaken?
- That's what we heard.

165
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,530
Yeah, I can see how
that could get threatening.

166
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,021
All right, new guy coming in,
getting all the ladies.

167
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,775
Hey there, freshman, I've fucked more
girls than you've cranked off to.

168
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,654
- Hey, do me a favor. Stop for a second.
- Why?

169
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,936
I wanna see what room she's in.

170
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,531
Just give it up, son.

171
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,214
This just went from "cute"
to "restraining order."

172
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,372
Just do it. I'll buy the first pitcher.

173
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,780
Okay. Now you're talking
our language a little.

174
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,534
All right, what are we looking at?
Let's see.

175
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,776
Okay. Stop, stop.

176
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,096
- Okay, that's her.
- Hey.

177
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,458
All right, 307. Help me remember that?

178
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,500
- Sure, man, 309.
- No, 307.

179
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,653
- 304.
- Can we go now, Mr. Stalker?

180
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,210
- Weirdo, man.
- 30-12?

181
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,371
Damn. Hey.

182
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,135
- Yeah?
- That was pathetic, man.

183
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,771
She was using you, a peasant,
to fuck with us, the kings.

184
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,340
Look, if you'd opened your mouth, too,

185
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,538
you'd have been shut down.
You don't see that?

186
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,977
No, I don't, actually.

187
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,176
Only been at college an hour

188
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,491
and I'm already pulling in
the groupies, man!

189
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,372
- That was a joke.
- Got your joke right here.

190
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,740
Did he just call his dick a joke?

191
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,141
That's what he implied.

192
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,934
- To the Fox?
- To the Fox.

193
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,299
Didn't it seem like
most of the girls we saw today were,

194
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,418
you know, moving into the dorms on campus?

195
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,180
That's what we're talking about!

196
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,371
Thank God. Finally.

197
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,371
Thanks, man.

198
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,296
So don't you think we would get
more ass living on campus?

199
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,656
You know, where all the girls are.

200
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,811
No, no.

201
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,619
Have a clue, freshman. The dorms suck.

202
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,454
You guys have no idea.

203
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,171
They gave us two houses.
Man, we've got it made.

204
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,695
No dorm resident snitches keeping track.

205
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,057
You know, den-mother types up your ass.

206
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,339
No centralized authority.
It's fucking brilliant.

207
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,214
Let's just hope they don't
realize what they've done.

208
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,530
Yeah.

209
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,133
We knew we'd find you drunks here!

210
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,571
What miserable updraft
wafts you three hither?

211
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,773
- Bite me, Finn.
- I will not...

212
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,897
Dismount.

213
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,859
This is our third bar
of the afternoon, boys!

214
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,170
You one of the new freshmen?

215
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,820
- Yeah, Jake.
- Coma.

216
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,052
- Hey, Alex Brumley.
- Hey, man. Nice to meet you.

217
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,370
Nesbit. A pleasure.

218
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,054
Go get some glasses, Brumley.

219
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,291
Yeah, sure thing, dude.

220
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,451
Is...

221
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,771
Wait, Jay Niles isn't with you guys?

222
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,531
Who's Jay Niles?

223
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,692
You haven't heard of Jay Niles?

224
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,011
The second coming of Nolan Ryan.

225
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,536
Yeah, man, 95-mile-an-hour fastball.

226
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,214
Self-professed, mind you.

227
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,019
He's this intense fuck from Detroit,

228
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,092
who just kind of spouts out all his stats

229
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,979
and just talks about
what a pro prospect he is.

230
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,290
How'd that guy end up here?

231
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,293
Well, he's filling the obligatory quota.

232
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,657
You know, we have to have at least
two weirdos on every team.

233
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,459
Now we're full up.

234
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,570
Wait, Jay Niles, one. Two? Who's two?

235
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,652
You, you sawed-off drunk fuck.

236
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,776
No, actually your roommate,
Beuter, the hayseed.

237
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,301
Can we agree?

238
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,417
We can agree.

239
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,776
I thought his name was Billy Autrey.

240
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,453
It was, until we changed it to the most
country bumpkin name we could come up with.

241
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,656
Beuter Perkins.

242
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,255
Beuter!

243
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,617
Hey, you guys sure Coach isn't
gonna know if we've been drinking?

244
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,890
Fuck, Brumley, you've seriously
asked that at every bar.

245
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,541
"Are you sure Coach isn't gonna know
if we've been drinking?

246
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,135
"What if he smells my breath?"

247
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,611
We're fucking drinking, man!
That's what we're doing!

248
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,613
- Yeah, we are.
- Okay? Yeah.

249
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,499
Cheers for the beers.

250
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,299
What is that brown shit on your lip?

251
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,053
I thought it was like a light,
like a shadow on your lip, but it...

252
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,814
- Is that a mustache?
- Yeah.

253
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,810
I'm sorry. Don't touch it. Don't...

254
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,261
Stop.

255
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,134
Yeah, it's a mustache. That's a mustache.

256
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,373
- It's growing.
- Was that hair?

257
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,340
- Full throttle to the bottle.
- Shut up, Brumley.

258
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,333
Why does he keep saying things like that?

259
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,732
Finn, I'm seriously worried
about these new guys. I mean...

260
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,858
It's gonna be a strange year, man.

261
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,579
Hey!

262
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,776
If you haven't met yet,

263
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,137
I'd like to introduce you
to the new guys on the team.

264
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,821
Freshman Ty Plummer, catcher.

265
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,380
Stand up, Ty. Come on, son.

266
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,572
Alex Brumley, outfield.

267
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,812
- Hey, guys.
- Sit down.

268
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,211
All right. Jake Bradford

269
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,459
and Billy Autrey, both freshman pitchers.

270
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,815
Also, I'm taking a leap
this year on two transfers,

271
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,654
trying to shore up our pitching staff.

272
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,051
From California,
senior Charlie Willoughby.

273
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,859
Stand up, Willoughby.

274
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,977
Guys.

275
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,656
And from Detroit, Jay Niles.

276
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,016
All right.

277
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,570
For you vets, I expect you
to show the new guys around.

278
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,379
Hopefully be a positive influence on them.

279
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,335
I'd appreciate that, all right?

280
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,180
Wake up, Coma!

281
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,933
Okay, for the eight of you
living in this house

282
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,139
and the eight of you living next door,

283
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,258
there's gonna be some guidelines
for living here.

284
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,251
The city's been generous enough
to donate these houses

285
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,015
to help with the overcrowding
situation in athletic dorms,

286
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,854
and we've agreed to be
responsible for them.

287
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,854
So, two rules.

288
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,491
Number one.
No alcohol in these houses, okay?

289
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,577
It's against school policy.
Need I say more?

290
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,737
Now, we can't stop you from having a drink

291
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,019
down at that Jolly Fox
and Sound Machine, or whatever.

292
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,334
You're all over 18, all right?
Just no booze in this house.

293
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,660
Okay. Number two,
and it's a biggie, gentlemen.

294
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,415
No girls upstairs in those bedrooms.

295
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,141
- What?
- Yup. I'm sorry.

296
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,814
She's gonna have to take it
back to her place or,

297
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,571
if you want, you can spend as much time
as you like together down here.

298
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,221
There's plenty of room
in both these houses for socializing.

299
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,611
So, if you just gotta bring
some little gal back to the house,

300
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,455
you keep her buns downstairs. You got it?

301
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,261
Don't want the program taken
down by a piece of poontang.

302
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,941
Okay, that's it.

303
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,251
Voluntary practice is on Sunday.

304
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,570
That's players-only now.

305
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,813
Rulebook says I can't be on the field,
so I'll see you fellas on Monday.

306
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,496
Be responsible out there
this weekend, okay?

307
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,777
Think before you do
something stupid, please.

308
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,897
Skip?

309
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,972
All right. Mac, you got something?

310
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,575
Yeah. Hey, new guys, listen up.

311
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,494
Just so you know,
"voluntary" means mandatory, okay?

312
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,571
Everybody's got to be there.

313
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,936
If you're not there,
then you probably don't care

314
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,012
about beating those fuckers from Arizona.

315
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,377
And if you're not serious about that,
you might as well go home.

316
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,498
Yeah. We're taking it this year, fellas.

317
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,493
All the way.

318
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,499
All right! Our lucky year!

319
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,331
Get ready, boys,
your college careers are about to begin.

320
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,061
- How's it going?
- Yeah, yeah!

321
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,736
Murphy! Trouble walking in.

322
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,733
- How's it going, man?
- Hey. Two-dollar cover.

323
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,495
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no. They're with us.

324
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,571
Freshman superstars.

325
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,495
It's all right. Let them in.

326
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,698
- Thanks, man.
- Have fun, boys.

327
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,056
Hey, shake something,
don't break something.

328
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,217
Yes, sir.

329
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,691
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Yeah?

330
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,135
If you guys want more beer, go to Howard.

331
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,417
The guy that looks like Cheech.

332
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,299
We're getting all this shit for free, okay?

333
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,380
Dude! No cover and free beer.

334
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,538
College is the fucking greatest!

335
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,499
Hey, it's part of the scholarship.

336
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,496
Say goodbye to your
high school sweethearts, fellas.

337
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,779
The wonderful world of
college pussy is upon you.

338
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,971
Ladies! How was your summer?

339
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,135
- Fun. How was yours?
- Angie, you look amazing.

340
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,292
Let me introduce you to
some of the new guys. This is Jake.

341
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,576
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

342
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,971
- That dude is Plum.
- What's up? Tyrone.

343
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,336
- How you doing?
- Hi.

344
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,779
- You guys wanna dance?
- Yeah.

345
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,811
- Cheers. To a beautiful night.
- There we go.

346
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,411
Yeah.

347
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,811
- We're gonna need a couple more.
- Yeah, come on!

348
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,337
She needs quite a few more. You do, too.

349
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,333
- Lookit.
- What? What's up?

350
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,052
Finn's in his average cock mode.

351
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,781
Right now, I guarantee you
he's telling those girls

352
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,540
about how he has an average cock.

353
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,816
Why the hell would he do that?

354
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,858
See, no, it's genius, actually.

355
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,012
See, he tells girls that
he has an average cock,

356
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,060
and while that might only seem
moderately compelling on paper,

357
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,416
women find it a relief

358
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,970
from all the guys talking
about how huge they are.

359
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,780
I'm a performer, all right?
I'm a grower, not a shower.

360
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,976
See all that fun, all that laughing?

361
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,051
Yeah, yeah.

362
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,859
They're talking about his dick, man!

363
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,056
- Fuckin' with me.
- No...

364
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,292
- You heard of "foot in the door"?
- Of course.

365
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,610
Finn's got his dick in the door.

366
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,055
That's fucking genius.

367
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,576
- Genius. Yes!
- Genius!

368
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,697
- Fuck.
- I tell you.

369
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,900
Hey, you see what I see?

370
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,774
- You know them?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

371
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,739
That's Michelle with her friend Val.

372
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,971
What's the book on them?

373
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,656
The book is,
we're going over to rap with them.

374
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,539
- Yeah?
- Hell, yes.

375
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,098
Let's get it.

376
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,696
- Hey, which one you going after?
- Michelle, definitely.

377
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,613
- The one on the right.
- The tall one?

378
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,897
I'm climbing that tree, Jake!

379
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,894
- I hear Val is fun. Go for it!
- All right, cool.

380
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,654
- Val?
- How you doing, Dale?

381
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,097
- Michelle.
- Dale.

382
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,501
Michelle, Val, this is Jake.

383
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,696
- Hey there.
- What's up?

384
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,898
- I love this song! Come on.
- It's Jake.

385
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,893
Val.

386
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,258
Are you gonna ask me to dance,
or are you just gonna stand there?

387
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,537
I'm asking you to dance.

388
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,460
Hey, what position do you play?

389
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,691
Pitcher.

390
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,336
- Cool. And you're a freshman?
- Yeah, yeah. You?

391
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,732
I'm a sophomore.
I live in the apartment next to Angie.

392
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,936
Cool.

393
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,297
Hey, do you live in those
new baseball houses?

394
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,451
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,500
Yes! Yes! Two at a time, bro! Shoot!

396
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,375
Just a second.

397
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,216
Wait here a second.

398
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,578
Soul brother, what's the deal, man?

399
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,018
I don't know, man.
Finn's got that Leeann chick in there.

400
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,580
I'm gonna go upstairs real quick.
I'll be right back.

401
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,737
Okay.

402
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,813
Strike three. Strike three.

403
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,454
Strike...

404
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,416
...and his answer is, his answer is,

405
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,460
"It needs some tail." And ol' Ben says,

406
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,693
"Well, that's what I told Mrs. Franklin.
She told me to go fly a kite!"

407
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,891
- "Go fly a kite!"
- Man, that's funny.

408
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,096
- Hey, what's going on, Jacob?
- What's up, man?

409
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,013
So, where you guys been tonight?

410
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,330
Shoot, man.

411
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,493
We went over to the Guaranteed Wholesome.

412
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,776
What about you?

413
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,137
- Sound Machine.
- Sound Machine, all right.

414
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,372
Yeah. Hey, Beuter.

415
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,133
I mean, Billy.

416
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:22,501
Look, man, I got a little lady downstairs
who maybe wants to come up here

417
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,334
and check out
my album collection, you know?

418
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,459
How about that? Hey, Jacob,
didn't Coach Gordan say this afternoon

419
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,851
that we weren't supposed
to have girls upstairs?

420
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,092
He said something about that, didn't he?

421
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,331
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

422
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,856
But, I mean, half the guys in this house
just broke that rule, you know?

423
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,013
So I kind of decided not to be
like a one-man holdout on that.

424
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,060
Yeah. Yeah, you is a team player,
ain't you?

425
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,571
So, what you want me to do?

426
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,451
I don't know, man.

427
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,534
Just do the right thing, you know?

428
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,061
Give me the room alone for a bit.

429
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:59,297
You know, man, but my girlfriend,
she lives out of town, right?

430
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,101
So what, you want me to just

431
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,252
pitch a tent on the couch
all the time, or what?

432
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,496
Not all the time.

433
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,095
Just this little window of time.

434
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,934
- Little window? Yeah.
- Yeah.

435
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,016
Look, come on, man, you guys
are already breaking the alcohol rule.

436
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,258
Or is there a waiver for Lone Star?

437
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,140
Dang, that sure is Lone Star.
That's alcohol right there.

438
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,974
Alcoholic beverage in there.
I'll be danged.

439
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,336
Well, man, I'll tell you what,

440
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:25,460
I gotta get up early
for registration in the morning.

441
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:31,337
Plus, I think Mr. Finnegan
set up a room downstairs for that.

442
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,935
Yeah, he's in there.

443
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,376
Well, shoot,

444
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,340
I reckon he'll be out of there
before too long, won't he?

445
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,821
Un-fucking-believable.

446
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,733
You go get 'em, Jacob.

447
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,017
Go show her them albums.

448
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,339
All right, bro.

449
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,171
Let's go somewhere quiet.

450
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,260
I feel like the Astros
are gonna make it to the World Series.

451
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,937
Tom, you know I wouldn't ask you this
unless it were very important.

452
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,012
Erica's such a bitch.

453
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,694
Yeah, she's definitely cheating on him.

454
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,181
What?

455
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,738
Hey, Beuter, you leaving us already?

456
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,539
Running home to mama, Perkins?

457
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,932
Come on, y'all, my name ain't Beuter.
Okay, guys? It's Billy Autrey.

458
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,779
Bullshit!

459
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,739
It's Beuter Perkins
until we tell you otherwise.

460
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,016
Now, where you going, BP?

461
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,060
You running back to that corn-fed
girlfriend of yours already?

462
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,416
No, sir, I'll be back Sunday for practice.

463
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,060
Well, well, well!

464
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,337
Looks like Beuter Perkins
is getting laid this weekend.

465
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,339
You finally trading in that phone
for the real thing?

466
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,620
Shoot, y'all.

467
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,134
Man, guys, she says she might be pregnant.

468
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,891
No, sir.

469
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,098
Yeah, man, that's what she says.

470
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,094
- How late is she?
- She's a day late.

471
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,058
You gotta be shittin' me, Beuter!

472
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,979
She's one day late
and she's giving you shit for it?

473
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,212
She's testing you.
She's trying to gauge your response.

474
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,416
Are you the guy that says,

475
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,571
"Don't worry,
I'm gonna pay for the abortion,"

476
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,015
or are you talking about marriage?

477
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,740
Which is what she's hoping for.

478
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,893
Either way, you're fucked.
Give it up, Beuter Perkins.

479
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,972
No trust me, man,
she's not fucking pregnant, all right?

480
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,540
We've all been through shit like this.

481
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,135
Except for Nez, of course,
'cause he's still a virgin.

482
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,378
Look, she's just taking
your little chicken-fried nuts

483
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,690
and she's running them
through the wringer, okay?

484
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,137
She's just giving you shit for it
because you left her back on the farm

485
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,655
with all the other little pigs
you used to fuck.

486
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,610
I ain't never put it in a pig!

487
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,251
They speaketh the truth,
young Beuter Perkins.

488
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,731
Man, we're just
worried about you, all right?

489
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,096
Yeah, man.
I mean, school hasn't even started yet,

490
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,539
and, guys, correct me if I'm wrong,
but you are the official frontrunner

491
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,692
for the Freshman Numb-Nut
of the Year award, right, guys?

492
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,250
- The what award?
- It's the annual award.

493
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,014
We give it out
to the most clueless freshman.

494
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,337
I think we've already started
engraving his name on the plaque.

495
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,571
How do you spell "Beuter," by the way?

496
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,061
My name is not Beuter!

497
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,577
Beuter, we also got a bet going on

498
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,417
whether your share of the phone bill
is gonna be under or over $300.

499
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,096
We gotta pay the phone bill here?

500
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,174
I've already done the calculations
based on its usage thus far,

501
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,695
way over $300.

502
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,374
- Really.
- Yeah.

503
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,340
$300 and a kid?

504
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,731
Man, your life's gonna fucking suck.

505
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:15,139
- Fine. Fine.
- Later, Beuter!

506
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,771
- Later, Beuter!
- Bye, Beuter! Beuter.

507
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,611
Five bucks says we never see him again.

508
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,419
Nez, he's gotta come back for his shit.

509
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,696
It's a bad bet.

510
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,738
This is why
you're losing money all the time.

511
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,498
A good bet would be, I don't know,

512
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,050
"Is his girlfriend in his family tree?"

513
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,576
Okay, five bucks
that his girlfriend's in his family tree.

514
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,652
Okay, first cousin, second cousin?

515
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,010
First cousin, Finn.

516
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,855
See, that's a bad bet. I'll take the bet.

517
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,739
- Still bad odds.
- First cousin?

518
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,740
So, what do most of the guys
on the team major in?

519
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,221
Besides baseball and pussy?

520
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,292
You mean when a girl asks? That's easy.

521
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,816
Look, there are thousands
and thousands of people

522
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,779
majoring in all kinds of shit here.

523
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,411
But there's only 25 of us.
We're the best team on campus.

524
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,811
You got a football team
that'll win about three games a year.

525
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,494
Basketball team hasn't won shit.

526
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:06,380
We are in the playoffs every year
and we're always ranked nationally.

527
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,815
Dale, you're confusing him.

528
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,621
Bottom line is this,
her friends are gonna ask,

529
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,772
"What's he like? What's he do?"

530
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,932
She's not gonna have to say the old,

531
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,455
"I don't know. He's a marketing major."

532
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,453
That's not gonna cut it.

533
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,532
"He's a baseball player."

534
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,696
See, now they got something special
to talk about.

535
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,896
"How's your ballplayer doing?"

536
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,411
"He's still stiff as a bat."

537
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,696
"You still ballin' your player?"

538
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,010
"He's sliding home."

539
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,297
That's cool, that's cool and everything.
I like pussy.

540
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,533
But, you know, what about school?
Like, what do I take?

541
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,180
That's easy, that's easy.

542
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,457
You get good at making
the school-part work for you, right?

543
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,691
It's like a puzzle, man.

544
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,091
What teachers will give you a break,
what classes to take.

545
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,453
Hey, look, you gotta start the semester
with 12 hours, all right?

546
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,975
But you only gotta be
passing nine to be eligible.

547
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,979
Drop one class, blow off another.

548
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,539
God damn it, Plummer!

549
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,459
Call it! Wake up!

550
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,135
I kinda like our relationship.

551
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,577
It's like, I throw the junk
and you get yourself out.

552
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,015
Fuck!

553
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,900
Was that a big deal for you,
transferring in senior year?

554
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,495
No, man, not really.

555
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:22,053
You know, I'll still have a few hours
that I gotta complete, you know?

556
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,897
I'll go back in late summer,
graduate, do that thing.

557
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,211
And where's San Luis Obispo?

558
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,691
- California.
- That's where you're from?

559
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,492
Yeah. Yeah.
Sort of the central coast area.

560
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,460
- Cool. Cool.
- Yeah. Yeah. Very cool.

561
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,374
- I'm from this small town in the valley.
- Yeah.

562
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,091
- Hey, man, you get high?
- Yeah. Yeah, here and there.

563
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,616
Yeah? Well, I don't know.

564
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,931
Couple of guys are gonna go
burn this with me

565
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,455
in my room pretty soon.

566
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,416
- If you wanna join that.
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

567
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,811
- Yeah? All right. All right.
- Cool.

568
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,617
- I'll bet you 10 bucks.
- Ten bucks?

569
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,533
- Yeah. Ten bucks.
- You wanna go... That's steep for you.

570
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,896
Best out of three.

571
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,735
- So, I gotta get two?
- Yeah, Mac, two.

572
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,734
Okay. You feel like losing 10 bucks?

573
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,653
You're just excited to
hit off me for once, huh?

574
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:25,936
Man. I mean, this is gonna be fun.
This is gonna be very fun, Nesbit.

575
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,580
Man, let me get a little stretch in.

576
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,137
Come on. Come on, Mr. Ax. Strong Man.

577
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,497
Anytime.

578
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,301
Fuck. I don't believe
what I just fucking saw.

579
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,974
You know how strong
you'd have to be to do that?

580
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,575
- And the eyes!
- Let me see that.

581
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,732
You know how well
you'd have to see the ball

582
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,175
to hit it with an ax?

583
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,093
Fucking crazy.

584
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,457
You just wouldn't listen, Nez.
You wanna go half price?

585
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,100
We can stop now.
We can call it five bucks.

586
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,820
- No, no, no.
- Double or nothing.

587
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,659
Triple or nothing.

588
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,939
- Yeah, you feeling lucky? I am.
- I feel great with those odds.

589
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,012
Triple or nothing sounds fantastic.

590
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,060
Maybe one of the best days
of my life here, Nez.

591
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,132
You know, until tomorrow.

592
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,451
What was that?

593
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,774
You're gonna be squashed, Jake.

594
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,851
I hate this game.

595
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,500
It starts out easy,
and then it just gets fucking impossible.

596
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,696
I'm telling you.

597
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,930
Yeah, man,
I must've wasted, like, $200 in quarters

598
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,455
on this bitch last summer,

599
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,897
just getting reamed
by these little fuckers.

600
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,814
You can't win.
Once they get up on you, you're fucked.

601
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,255
Sounds of amateurs

602
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,332
who have not yet mastered the gap method.

603
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,220
- What the fuck is the gap method?
- You're looking at it, Plum.

604
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,055
Like you were saying,
most people lose at this point

605
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,212
not because they get shot,
but because they get overrun.

606
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,258
But I discovered that they actually

607
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,418
don't shoot you from
the absolute front row.

608
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,855
- Shit, they don't?
- No.

609
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,659
You just gotta create
a clearing of columns.

610
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,970
- You see what I'm doing right there?
- Yeah.

611
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,417
Make your space, okay?
You just hold your ground in there.

612
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,460
Just gets a little hairy.

613
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,339
They speed up at the end. See that guy?

614
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,457
See how fast he's going?

615
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,532
All right? But you just gotta remain calm,

616
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,533
meet them in the middle and...

617
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,501
- Fucking nailed that!
- Fuckin A, man! Okay! Okay!

618
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,651
Gimme some dap! Gimme some dap!

619
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,010
- Shit, come on.
- Shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

620
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,861
It's the same shot every time!

621
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,218
- Same shot every time!
- All right. You know, Mac?

622
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:43,460
I... This is supposed to be fun,
and now I'm not having fun.

623
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,736
Well, it's not his fault. It's our fault.

624
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,857
Thank you.

625
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,773
- You can't teach this chemistry.
- You can't.

626
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,181
We've been together for three years!

627
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,133
I know where I'm going with it
before he even gets it to me.

628
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,536
Yeah, and I know where he wants it.

629
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,577
- That's special.
- Let me talk, man.

630
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:00,531
- That ass is golden.
- Absolutely, say no more.

631
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,817
Hey. The bitch stick?

632
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,816
Are you kidding me?

633
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,174
What, I'm just trying to make the shot.

634
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,491
Okay. Not with this you're not.

635
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,379
Okay, Brum, have your balls dropped?

636
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,940
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

637
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,820
Okay, now play like you got some
fucking semen in your sack, Brum.

638
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,460
Okay.

639
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,611
- Okay? All right.
- Okay.

640
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,299
- What the hell is this?
- Please.

641
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,417
- What are you doing?
- Putting it on.

642
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,214
- First time wearing cologne?
- No.

643
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,337
Get it on there, man.

644
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,531
Get it under your arms and on your chest.

645
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,816
Don't just put it on your neck. Come on.

646
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,131
I don't know, man.

647
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,338
Too much of this smells like cat piss.

648
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,139
Yeah, no shit.

649
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,571
Trying to help you out,
and you're gonna question me?

650
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:24,053
Jesus. I'm telling you, man,
chicks dig this shit. All right?

651
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,656
Now you can come back here
and do the five-knuckle shuffle

652
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,220
all night if you want to.
I don't really care.

653
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,815
What's the five-knuckle shuffle?

654
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,979
Jesus, freshman, figure it out, man.

655
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,021
Hey, good one, McReynolds.

656
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,218
You're so fucking desperate, dude.

657
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,021
Desperate for pussy!

658
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,538
This shirt makes me fucking sad, man.

659
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,451
What's up, guys? You lost?

660
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,972
I got the best cheese on campus.

661
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,334
I mean, girls, they come up to me
out of the blue and they say,

662
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,653
"You got the best cheese on campus."

663
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,970
Yeah?

664
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,532
Sure those pants couldn't
be a little tighter there?

665
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,176
Nope.

666
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,979
No?

667
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,051
What are you doing?

668
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,698
I'm going through your album collection.

669
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,374
Okay, don't mind me.

670
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,659
Holy shit!

671
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:49,133
Nesie, look at what I found here.

672
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,850
"2nd Team All-State."

673
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,211
- Yeah, so?
- You're a fucking badass!

674
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,975
Hey, guys! We got
a 2nd Team All-Stater among us!

675
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,291
Fuck off with that shit, boy.

676
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,453
Golly gee, you're good. You're good.

677
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,374
Hey, I'm sure afraid to hit off you,
2nd Team All-State.

678
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,976
Yeah, I'm scared.

679
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,817
2nd Team All-State.

680
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,654
- Scariness.
- Wait. Wait.

681
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,734
Did I ask you guys
to be in my room right now?

682
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,053
No. No. Goodbye.

683
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,655
Well, look at you.

684
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,619
Nice fucking life
you got here, Joe College.

685
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,774
I mean, you got your whole room to yourself
for the weekend, and you got your albums.

686
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,255
This is mine now.

687
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,817
Borrowing this.

688
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,056
Hey, wait. Hey, no.

689
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,258
Hey, you return that
with one scratch on it, Nez...

690
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,820
What? What?

691
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,896
What?

692
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,052
Just return my album, man.

693
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,212
What? What?

694
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,416
What?

695
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,578
Fuck, that guy's weird.

696
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:04,051
Yeah, 95 on the gun, official.

697
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,497
Could've gone to anywhere in Texas.

698
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,410
I had a stack of offers
about that high, that high.

699
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,812
- Almost went to USC.
- Were you drafted?

700
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,576
Yeah, yeah.
The Blue Jays almost picked me up,

701
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,620
but I told them I'm going to college
for a couple of years.

702
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,097
- Good move.
- Yeah, yeah.

703
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,660
- You drafted?
- No.

704
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,976
McReynolds was.

705
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,376
Really?

706
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,501
You got some moves. Alison, right?

707
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,135
Like your dress.

708
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,980
- Blue, like your eyes.
- ...baseball team.

709
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:39,212
- Shit, you like baseball, too?
- Some nice... Fuck.

710
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,173
Fuck it, man.

711
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:43,896
- We suck tonight.
- Dude, this is getting ridiculous.

712
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,256
We suck so fucking hard.

713
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,901
I'm gonna get a drink. Man's drink!

714
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,621
- A real drink!
- Yeah! Yeah, do that!

715
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,896
Way to go!

716
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,495
All right. I'll see you guys in a bit.

717
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,773
- Right. See ya.
- Okay. All right.

718
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,251
God, am I the only person
living in reality here?

719
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,458
That I'm not gonna be
playing this game forever?

720
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:05,216
Hey, man, you gotta appreciate it
while it lasts, you know?

721
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,416
I mean, I'm a good college player.

722
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,811
But beyond that,
I'm not counting on anything.

723
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,858
Screwdriver!
This place is fucking awesome.

724
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:18,141
I've been dancing up on like five girls
all night long, man.

725
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,417
That's not true, though.
You haven't danced with one girl yet.

726
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,575
Yeah, I have. Yeah. Before you got here.
I was all up on 'em, man.

727
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,256
Hey, who's that douchebag
she's dancing with?

728
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,061
Thompson? He's a football player.

729
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,979
What a dyke!

730
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:37,460
Man, this is savage.
We're getting fucking hosed out here.

731
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,656
Fucking sucks.

732
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,415
You know what?
I mean, taking account of the situation,

733
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,016
we're not doing so hot,
but we're in the early innings.

734
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,297
- We got a whole game to play.
- Yeah.

735
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,974
This is college, Jake, all right?

736
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,132
The girls can be
as big of sluts as the guys!

737
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,371
Make it work for you.

738
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,821
Hey, screwdriver! Okay?

739
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,813
It's not the writing of
the Magna fucking Carta!

740
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,857
That's a book.

741
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,341
Who drinks a screwdriver, anyway?

742
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,821
I drink a fucking screwdriver!

743
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,892
Everybody I know drinks
a fucking screwdriver.

744
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,971
You know who drinks a screwdriver?

745
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,621
- My little sister drinks a screwdriver too.
- Really? Does she?

746
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,819
Does she have blue eyes
and a big ass like you?

747
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,574
I bet she has a big ass.

748
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,254
- Big mouth!
- Yeah.

749
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,055
Did he just flick a lime in my drink?

750
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,970
Did he just fucking...
It's a fucking screwdriver!

751
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,176
You don't flick a fucking lime!

752
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,661
You don't have lime in a screwdriver!

753
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,495
Hey, motherfucker!
Let's go, fucking Pancho Villa!

754
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,097
I'm gonna come back there,
and I'll fucking make you my bitch, man!

755
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,821
Don't act like you don't like me
just because I got good hair!

756
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,700
Now he's giving me
the old-fashioned stare down!

757
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,171
All right, that's a fucking stare down!

758
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,297
Dude, you're staring, he's cool.

759
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,179
No, he's not cool!
No, he's not fucking cool!

760
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,934
You're back there having
a fucking good time!

761
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,614
I'll come show you a good time.

762
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,136
I'll come over the bar
and show you a good time.

763
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,781
- Let's go. Let's go.
- I'm not gonna do anything.

764
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,815
Hey! No, you fucking stay.

765
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,974
Back off! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

766
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,534
Out of the club! Right the fuck now!
Get them out!

767
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,453
All baseball players out of here!
I mean it!

768
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,658
Let's go! Come on!

769
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,254
Get them out! Right now. Get them out.

770
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,491
Don't bring him back here again,
you get me?

771
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,050
Let's go, boys. Let's go! Hey!

772
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,700
Keep walking.

773
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,898
I'm gonna fucking defend myself!

774
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,972
No! One more chance!

775
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,861
Fuck you! Fuck you, you jackoffs!

776
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,695
Bunch of fucking numb-nuts!

777
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,059
Suck my dick, man!

778
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,096
- You fucking asshole!
- Stupid fucking asshole!

779
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,581
Don't bring your ass around here!

780
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,011
Bunch of fucking numb-nuts!

781
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:00,418
- What the fuck, Niles!
- Well, that was ugly.

782
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,295
I don't know, just based on
an outsider's perspective,

783
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,099
totally avoidable.

784
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,219
- Well, I'm a fucking raw dog, all right?
- Raw dog!

785
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,573
Anybody who fucks with me,
they don't get fucked with back!

786
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,890
They get fucking killed!

787
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,133
The only thing you killed tonight was
the prospect of any of us getting laid!

788
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,577
Your fucking junkyard dog routine
from fucking Detroit

789
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:21,778
might make you feel tough, but it's not
helping out any of your fucking teammates.

790
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,579
Watch that shit in the future.

791
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,459
It's crazy we're fucking
defending this guy.

792
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,419
It's all so damn tribal.

793
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:29,970
It's the pack mentality, animal instincts.

794
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,575
All the adrenaline!

795
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,221
Guys. Hey, guys. I got a new plan.

796
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,815
We're gonna shift our focus

797
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,699
from disco snatch
to country poon. All right?

798
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,933
No cover, free beer till 11:00
at Guaranteed Wholesome.

799
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:44,776
Okay, fucking no cover, free beer!
We can't afford not to go!

800
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:47,774
Fuck you, Sound Machine! Let's fucking go!

801
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,420
Fuck you, Sound Machine!

802
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,892
I got seven of my bucks back! Let's do it!

803
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,654
No, no, no, no!

804
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,095
I don't know where the hell
you think you're going.

805
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,212
You sitting this one out
with that "raw dog" bullshit.

806
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,292
- Sit!
- Heel, boy. Heel, boy.

807
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,013
- Fetch.
- Yeah!

808
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,411
I get it. I get it. I get it!

809
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,140
I'll fucking go home.

810
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,099
I got shit to do. I'll do some pushups.

811
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,376
How's that sound?

812
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:14,454
I'll do some pushups, do some abs.
I'll come back looking awesome!

813
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,375
I'll read a book.

814
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,452
Fuck it! I'll fucking run home.

815
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,532
Yeah! Fuck it!

816
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,936
Fuck it!

817
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,377
Hey, check your pillows, man!

818
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,101
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Fuck if I know.

819
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,741
Fuck's that mean? Let's fucking go.

820
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,619
I don't know about this country bar, man.

821
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:32,691
Wait, wait, wait.

822
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,215
What the Charlie Pride
are you talking about?

823
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,416
We're just gonna do a quick
wardrobe change, and we're there.

824
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:38,651
All right, I gotta say,

825
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,017
I hate all this Cotton-Eyed Joe,

826
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,212
"Looking for love
in all the wrong places."

827
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,861
What, Disco Boy now wearing
a cowboy hat and boots and shit?

828
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,261
- Yeah.
- It's unbelievable

829
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:49,412
that's trendy now everywhere!

830
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,413
Does that mean you're not going?

831
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,456
I didn't say that.

832
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,971
Crank it up, sweetheart! Come on, baby!

833
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,501
All right, crank it up!

834
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,410
You're not detecting
an anti-pitcher bias around here?

835
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,491
No, man.

836
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,935
- No?
- No!

837
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,614
I sure as hell am.

838
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,859
Well, let me tell you something, Jake.

839
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,978
It is lonely out on the bump, man.

840
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,293
You know, hitters,
they got no idea what that's like.

841
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:49,294
They don't know
the first thing about it, you know?

842
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:51,691
It's the most important part
of the game, hands down,

843
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:54,535
and yet it is a complete mystery to them.

844
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,740
Yeah, no shit,

845
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:59,256
but it's almost like
they view us as a necessary evil.

846
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,061
Well, yeah, man, we kind of are, you know?

847
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,178
But that doesn't make them bad guys.

848
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:09,574
You know, they're just...
They're a little scared of us. You know?

849
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:13,132
We're fucking weird, man! We're different!

850
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,694
And the trick is, what's the trick?

851
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,534
I don't know. Tell me.

852
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,773
The trick is, you can't fight it.

853
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,579
You gotta accept it.

854
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:26,814
You gotta fucking embrace
your inner fucking strange, man.

855
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,813
Just be fucking weird, you know?

856
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:34,817
And when you do that,
you bring who you are,

857
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,860
never who they want.

858
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:42,094
And that, my friend, is when it gets fun.

859
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,338
So, all of y'all play
on the baseball team?

860
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,299
Yeah, we got all nine positions covered.

861
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,417
And then some.

862
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,811
This one,
this one loves catching our balls,

863
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,016
don't you, Plum?

864
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,058
He's an animal husbandry major.

865
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,211
What?

866
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,894
I'm actually studying
to be a cunnilinguist.

867
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,335
What's that?

868
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,300
It's a major you can
actually practice before graduating.

869
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,772
Sometimes I feel like
I'm just, you know, buried in my work,

870
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,852
but I feel like
it's important to give back, you know?

871
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,137
- Y'all know what time it is!
- Oh, my God!

872
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,531
It's time to grab your partner dosey-do

873
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:14,137
'cause here we come with Cotton-Eyed Joe!

874
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,131
- Hey, what'd you say?
- Bullshit!

875
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,139
- Y'all say what?
- Bullshit!

876
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,730
- You're steppin' in what?
- Bull shit!

877
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,292
- Hey, what'd you say?
- Bullshit!

878
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,412
- Stepped in what?
- Bull shit!

879
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:01,492
- A big pile of what?
- Bull shit!

880
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,657
Cotton-Eyed Joe.

881
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,375
Damn you, Jake!

882
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:12,336
- Eight up! Eight up! Let's go! Let's do it!
- Eight-eight.

883
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:15,581
Okay. Let's go!

884
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,095
Get the ball now.

885
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,932
- Fuck!
- That's for you, babe!

886
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,490
- It's our ball.
- Damn it!

887
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,618
- Detroit?
- What? What?

888
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,180
Ball in!

889
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,696
Night and day!

890
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:34,013
See, the perfect rim ingredients
keep the drink on its toes.

891
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,610
It simultaneously complements
then conflicts.

892
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:39,614
What I like to do is a little sugar,
cayenne pepper,

893
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,899
you add a little whiskey, a little lime.

894
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,210
- Finn?
- Yeah?

895
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,981
Hey, yeah,
I just want a fucking drink, man.

896
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,694
Pardon me for trying
to class up the joint.

897
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,135
Don't get low.

898
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,055
That's right, freshman.

899
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,053
Yeah, you keep up that
funky-ass spin shit.

900
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,291
I've got you figured out, son.

901
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,701
Yeah, that's just what I want.

902
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,615
You thinking you got me clocked,
then I set you up.

903
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,533
I'll let you know when I feel threatened.

904
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,821
You feeling threatened yet?

905
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,614
All right, smartass.

906
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,779
- 19-17.
- Actually, it's 17-19.

907
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,654
Thank you, Nesbit! 17-19, is that better?

908
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,256
No, I'm scared now, but, yeah...

909
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,331
Can we fucking play now?

910
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,935
God damn it!

911
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,253
Glen, get your head
out of your fucking ass! Let's go!

912
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,095
- 20-17!
- 17-point.

913
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,333
I swear to fucking God! Shut your mouth!

914
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,534
17-point!

915
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,816
Hey, good game, man. Let's play again.

916
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,420
Fuck!

917
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:05,616
Fuck.

918
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:11,931
Stupid fucking game!

919
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,814
- My dad was a table...
- Fuck off.

920
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,694
Now I gotta put out that fucking fire.

921
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,693
- That dude needs to relax.
- Thanks, Jake.

922
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,215
I told you so, man.

923
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,657
He broke the fucking paddle.
Look at that shit.

924
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:24,341
Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake.

925
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:25,497
Here.

926
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:29,092
If things calm down, Nez,
you're next, bro.

927
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:30,581
- Fuck!
- You're up, man.

928
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:32,015
I don't think
you could use that one, though.

929
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,656
He does not like losing, at all!

930
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,899
Lot of Twilight Zones, man.

931
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,779
Yeah.

932
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,296
Almost every single episode.

933
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:48,421
Recorded them all
over the last year or so.

934
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,140
Yeah, you got that one where the lady,

935
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:52,452
she's getting the surgery
to correct how ugly she is?

936
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,895
- Yeah!
- So she gets surgery,

937
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:58,134
but it turns out that she's beautiful,
and everyone else is, like, hideous.

938
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:00,099
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, dude.

939
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,854
- You know what that's called?
- No.

940
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,940
- "The Eye of the Beholder."
- Yeah, yeah, that one.

941
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:09,174
Yeah, Season 2, Episode 5,
if I'm not mistaken.

942
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,261
Whoa there, Willoughby.

943
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,094
There's no way you're gonna suck that down

944
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:16,774
in one hit, man.

945
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,332
Yeah. Yeah.
There's gonna be too much smoke.

946
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:24,216
You know, like, there's not even
enough room in your body

947
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:26,936
for the amount of smoke there's gonna be.

948
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,341
Really?

949
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:31,892
Well, take notes, boys,

950
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:35,378
'cause I grew up on two rivers.

951
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:38,414
All right, I got fucking swimmer's lungs.
I'm a river rat.

952
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:39,935
And don't forget, he does have

953
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:42,178
a double chamber
cooling system on that thing.

954
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,776
I don't care if he grew up
on 40 fucking rivers,

955
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,215
it's just not happening.

956
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,460
Okay.

957
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:53,013
Okay. Well, get ready.

958
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:09,215
Shit, no, no, no. Is it?

959
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:13,659
- Oh, my God.
- Un-fucking real, man.

960
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,017
- Shit!
- Fucking unreal.

961
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,660
Super-human!

962
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,414
Wow, man.

963
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,696
Fucking mahogany rush, man.

964
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,811
You know, I don't wanna be presumptuous.

965
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,898
I know that I only have been here
for a few days,

966
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:35,019
but I'm pretty sure that
that is a new school record.

967
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,251
Bullshit. Bullshit. Just...

968
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:41,015
Let's break that school record
right fucking now.

969
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,854
Yeah? All right.

970
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,773
- I don't know, dude.
- Go for it, man.

971
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,258
God. Listen to this song.

972
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,615
Listen to this progression here, okay?

973
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,541
Listen to how it goes up.

974
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:59,218
It steps up from one moment to another
and leads you there, just...

975
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:08,661
Yes. I mean, look,

976
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:12,092
you can play an E pentatonic scale
at 100 miles an hour

977
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,935
till somebody's ears burn off,
you can learn that, right?

978
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:18,332
But finding the tangents
within the framework,

979
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,578
therein lies the artistry, man.

980
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,251
You know, a fucking bunch of dudes
jump around on stage,

981
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:28,617
jerking each other off,
you know, in spandex,

982
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,499
isn't fucking music.

983
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:36,821
I don't know, man. I kinda like Van Halen.

984
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:40,576
Well, yeah, Plum, you do.
And you know why you do?

985
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,893
Because corporate America
is shoving something down your throat

986
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,131
and making you believe it,

987
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,099
because that's what
they want you to believe.

988
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:51,175
I mean, guys,
it's about finding out who you are

989
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,654
in the space

990
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,859
in-between the notes
that they're offering you.

991
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:01,490
I mean, you gotta tune in, man.
You gotta tune in.

992
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:05,575
You know, and don't be afraid

993
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,977
to let the experience find you.

994
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,978
It's like Carl Sagan says, man,

995
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,497
"The beauty of a living thing
isn't about the atoms that go into it,

996
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,096
"it's how those atoms are put together."

997
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,660
I mean, language, fucking language.
What is language?

998
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:29,052
Language is a construct, man. You know?

999
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,212
And we used to be telepathic.

1000
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,133
Humans were telepathic, man.

1001
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,861
We could just... Right here. You know?

1002
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,819
The fucking Mayans knew it, man.

1003
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:40,018
The Druids fucking knew it.

1004
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:43,338
And you think the way things are going now

1005
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,981
that we're ever gonna get that back?

1006
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,895
- Fucking no.
- No.

1007
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,576
Do you guys wanna
try a little telepathic shit?

1008
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,300
Let's do it.

1009
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,254
Okay, lock in. Lock in.

1010
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,298
- You locked in? All right.
- Yeah.

1011
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,100
- What am I thinking about?
- Baseball.

1012
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,140
- Having a tail.
- Cereal?

1013
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,096
Fuck.

1014
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,740
Dude, I was thinking about sharks.

1015
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:26,019
- Fuck!
- I was thinking about sharks.

1016
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,854
Sharks have tails.

1017
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,136
That's a good point. That's a good point.

1018
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:32,134
I wish I had a tail.
Fuck, that'd be awesome.

1019
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,618
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck you!

1020
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:36,771
I'll take one.

1021
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,693
Sharpshooter status, right here.

1022
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,693
Coming at you! Coming at you!

1023
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:43,656
Been working out.

1024
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,734
Hey! Man-child here thinks he can take me.

1025
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:50,891
Even though he knows
I'm the reigning knuckles champ.

1026
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:53,735
Two years in a row. Undefeated.

1027
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:55,976
Bitch.

1028
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,774
Hey, have you noticed everything
around here's a competition, huh?

1029
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:03,535
Even taking hits from bongs.

1030
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,534
- Look at you, ping-pong pimp.
- Yeah!

1031
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:09,216
You see that back there though?
Mac almost took my head off.

1032
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:10,621
Hey, look,

1033
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:13,421
if Mac wanted to take
your head off with that paddle,

1034
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:14,975
he would have.

1035
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,291
All right, man,
he just don't like losing at anything.

1036
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:19,014
None of us do.

1037
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,330
Fuck yeah!

1038
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:23,698
Okay, look, that's just, what,
Willoughby, borderline insane?

1039
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,250
- About there?
- Yeah, border. Borderline.

1040
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,492
Well, you notice how everybody
was somewhat courteous

1041
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:30,140
- on the first day or so?
- Yeah.

1042
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,099
See, now the gloves are off.

1043
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,821
All of our true
assholish nature is emerging.

1044
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,301
Not very healthy.

1045
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,577
Until we get out on the field, Jakie.

1046
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:44,972
This, this, all of this, this is why we're
one of the best teams in the nation, man.

1047
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,018
You get a bunch of competitors together...

1048
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:50,537
- Yeah.
- ...and you're addicted to winning.

1049
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,015
That's a championship team right there...

1050
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:54,218
- I see.
- ...flicking each other's knuckles.

1051
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,734
- All right.
- Damn!

1052
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,699
That's all swolled up.

1053
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,898
That's gonna be erupting
like Mount St. Helens

1054
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,654
or some shit, man.

1055
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,015
You had enough?

1056
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:16,659
See, you can tell a lot about somebody
from these stupid little competitions.

1057
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:17,731
Really?

1058
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,733
Yeah, something's always revealed, like...

1059
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,256
Are you a competitor? Are you a gamer?

1060
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:25,971
You know, can you find a way
to overcome all obstacles

1061
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,337
to practically will yourself to victory.

1062
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:30,458
Or, are you a...

1063
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,895
- Fuck it!
- ...quitter?

1064
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,301
I'm fucking done, all right!

1065
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,691
- Folded like a lawn chair.
- Yup. Yup, yup, yup.

1066
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,898
- Good game, man.
- You can't...

1067
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,654
No, you can't beat me twice in a row!

1068
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,573
I know that for a fucking fact!

1069
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,335
And it's best two out of three, okay?

1070
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,571
Them's the rule, Brums!

1071
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,732
- Okay, man.
- Okay, all right!

1072
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,141
Give me my hat, all right?

1073
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,014
Stop laughing, Coma!
It's not fucking funny!

1074
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:54,697
- Tomorrow, same time, all right?
- Sure thing.

1075
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,898
Stop laughing, Dale!

1076
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,576
Hey, you're still the champ!

1077
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,220
Fuck off, Brum!

1078
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,371
You'll always be the champ, Nesie.

1079
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,576
Shut up. Let's go.

1080
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,857
- Hey, did you guys see me win?
- Put your fucking hands up.

1081
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:09,251
Who are these people?

1082
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,139
Like this guy with the backpack?

1083
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:14,252
And this dude on the porch?

1084
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,897
Like, I know what we're doing here.

1085
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:19,177
You know, we're playing baseball.

1086
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,173
What are all these other guys doing here?

1087
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,775
Yeah, I think that, too.

1088
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:24,215
Like, what would it be like
to go through life

1089
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:27,339
knowing there's no way
you'd ever play pro ball?

1090
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,498
Exactly.

1091
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:33,620
All these people
never be anything more than

1092
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,739
some dude doing some job,

1093
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:39,211
just like everybody else.

1094
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:40,291
Bradford!

1095
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:45,056
Holy shit! Justin?

1096
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,098
- Hey!
- What's up, man?

1097
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:48,899
- How you doing?
- This is where you living?

1098
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,098
As of right now,
but hey, don't let them know.

1099
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:53,093
These are my teammates.
Plum, Finn, and Coma.

1100
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,741
- What's going on, fellas?
- Hey, guys, this is Justin.

1101
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:57,050
We used to play ball
in high school together.

1102
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,936
- What's up?
- What's happening, man?

1103
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,819
Not much.
But hey, I'm loving this new look.

1104
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,130
- Yeah?
- This new 'do!

1105
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,053
I love this. What, is it pledge week?

1106
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:06,655
Yeah. Fuck you, too.

1107
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,141
- Come on, let's get a beer. Come in.
- Yeah.

1108
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,099
Hey, you guys want a beer? Come on.

1109
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:12,138
- Why not?
- Why?

1110
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,934
This is my old high school buddy, Jake.

1111
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,615
Hey, you still with Gretchen?

1112
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,215
Fuck Gretchen!

1113
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,771
Hey, you gotta walk me through this, man.

1114
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:27,456
What, you just wake up
one morning just fucking...

1115
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,975
Nah, man. It's as simple as this.

1116
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:31,451
You go to a show,
meet a couple of cute girls,

1117
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,180
get drunk, later that night

1118
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,901
they're chopping bits of your hair off,
giving you real bangs.

1119
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:38,941
Used to, I'd be like, "No, don't do that."

1120
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,616
But now that I don't play
on a team anymore

1121
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:44,261
or I'm doing anything
particularly "respectable,"

1122
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,616
I'm like, fuck it!

1123
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,658
Whatever, man.

1124
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:49,816
We're going to a show soon.

1125
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:53,053
Man, there are six bands in town,
some from L.A., some from Austin.

1126
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:54,695
We're gonna go in a bit.
You guys wanna join?

1127
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,459
We've got our party tonight.

1128
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:00,534
Yeah, yeah,
we should probably set up for it, right?

1129
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:02,533
No, it's not till later. Yeah.
No, we're just walking around,

1130
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:03,611
heading to the Student Center.

1131
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:07,490
Student Center? Come with us.
Come on, we'll fix you up!

1132
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,731
You guys down for that?

1133
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:11,216
Finn?

1134
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,299
- Of course we're down!
- Yeah!

1135
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:17,340
Come on, man. What about Costello
or the Talking Heads?

1136
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,333
They're great. Devo and The Cars,

1137
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:21,412
look, there's a lot of
decent stuff out there.

1138
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:23,777
We got a whole 'nother thing
going on around here.

1139
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:26,012
This? This is ours.

1140
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,616
At least take the sunglasses off, man.

1141
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,135
You look like a fucking narc.

1142
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,575
Hey, I don't think we really fit in here.

1143
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:34,534
No, no, you don't fit in.
Okay, I told you to change.

1144
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:37,375
Will you at least untuck your shirt?
You look like a Bible salesman.

1145
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,293
These people could really use a Bible!

1146
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,099
Got both of them.

1147
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,858
I'm starting to have
an identity crisis here.

1148
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,095
What are you talking about?

1149
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,979
Look at us, man.

1150
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:11,539
The last three nights, we've danced
at a disco, total mindless disco music,

1151
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,419
danced the Cotton-Eyed Joe
in kicker attire,

1152
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:15,893
and here we are, punks for a night.

1153
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,101
It sort of begs the question
about who we really are.

1154
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,460
- Are you insecure about the duck feet?
- So insecure about the duck feet.

1155
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:24,861
The duck feet look great, dude.

1156
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:27,171
- Serious? Promise?
- Yeah, they look great.

1157
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,059
Look, I'll tell you who we are.

1158
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,541
We're a couple of guys who are gonna do

1159
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:33,011
whatever it takes to get laid.
That's who we are.

1160
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,421
It just seems a little phony.

1161
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,778
It's not phony. Okay? It's adaptive.

1162
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:38,897
All right, think about this.

1163
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,496
There are animals, salmon, spiders

1164
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:44,414
that will literally die
in the process of mating.

1165
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:45,855
I mean, what are we doing?

1166
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:47,739
We're switching around
our wardrobe a little bit.

1167
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,699
It's camouflage!

1168
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:52,931
You need to stop thinking so much.
You're fucking yourself up.

1169
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:55,536
Dude, look at you, man.
You're one to talk.

1170
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:56,776
I actually don't think that much.

1171
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,252
I actually don't think at all.
I just, you know, I talk a lot.

1172
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:02,810
This is the jazz improv. You're invited.

1173
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,090
What?

1174
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,456
Listen.

1175
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:10,811
Hear that?

1176
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:13,457
That's the Gilligan's Island theme song!

1177
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:14,691
Yes, it is.

1178
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,613
You can make a punk song out of that?

1179
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,772
Coming full circle.

1180
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,693
It's all coming around.

1181
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,493
- Are you liking it?
- I'm liking it. Shall we go?

1182
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:06,534
- This might be our best batch.
- This is gonna be the best ever.

1183
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:11,931
That's some pussy shit.
It tastes like fruit punch.

1184
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:14,820
Well, that's the sign of a good
coon dog punch, Coma.

1185
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:17,780
No, no, not until Coma gets in here.

1186
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:20,740
All right, so this is about done.

1187
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:24,731
What I need you to do is take that sifter,
and then pour about half of that.

1188
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:26,340
- Okay.
- Just about half.

1189
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:28,016
Into the bowl.

1190
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,454
Brain dead, let's go!

1191
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:09,533
All right! Jake!
Where you fucking been, man?

1192
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:12,295
- What's up?
- You got some catching up to do.

1193
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:14,060
Get in here! You're up!

1194
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:16,212
Go, go, go.

1195
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,975
- Oh, my God.
- Hey!

1196
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:21,291
Welcome to the fucking party, Jake!

1197
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:23,054
Yeah, baby!

1198
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,371
You know what they call me?

1199
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:27,259
The raw dog.

1200
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,094
You wanna know why?

1201
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:32,855
'Cause I'm the fucking raw dog, man.

1202
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:34,819
It's not about the ingredients,

1203
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:37,541
it's about the way
the ingredients make you feel.

1204
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,135
The experience.

1205
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:45,421
That's why I say, "Indulge in temptation."

1206
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,333
I'm not watching.

1207
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,301
Are you serious?

1208
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:56,535
Okay.

1209
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:00,899
Chug it, Justin! Go, go, go, go, go!

1210
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,660
Yeah! Here we go.

1211
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:20,619
Yes.

1212
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,021
So, where is the flag?

1213
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,376
Right there, Volkswagen.

1214
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,293
There's the flag.

1215
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:27,532
- Ready?
- Aim...

1216
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:29,781
Fire.

1217
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:35,931
- You are a natural.
- Thank you.

1218
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:37,779
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Let's go!

1219
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:43,292
Come on, no one on their deathbed is filled
with regrets of the things they've done.

1220
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:47,101
It's those things they didn't do.

1221
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:50,811
You're not gonna let this be
one of those things, are you?

1222
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:54,376
- I guess not.
- Of course not!

1223
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:56,371
Yeah?

1224
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:59,056
Competitors ready? Go!

1225
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,141
- Yeah.
- Go!

1226
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,091
Yeah!

1227
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,495
Okay, baby!

1228
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:03,052
- Let's go!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1229
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:04,211
Let's go!

1230
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:31,980
- Phone.
- What, man?

1231
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,973
Dude, some chick on the line, man.

1232
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,256
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1233
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:37,936
Said she wanted to squat on your boner.

1234
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,821
Hello?

1235
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,016
Hi.

1236
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:46,218
Is this the guy that left
the flowers on my door?

1237
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:48,133
Yeah.

1238
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:49,291
Yeah.

1239
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:51,816
Hey, you're the quiet guy
in the back seat, Jake.

1240
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:54,416
Yeah. Yeah. Hi.

1241
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:59,291
Hi. It's the quote-unquote
"auburn-haired girl in 307."

1242
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:01,978
That was just so there
wouldn't be any confusion,

1243
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:05,372
but I'm glad you called. That was quick.

1244
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:07,932
Yeah, no, I mean,
it was the least I could do

1245
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:10,741
after you went to all that trouble.

1246
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:13,381
How did you know what room I was in?

1247
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:16,694
I'm an Investigative Journalism major.

1248
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:19,578
I have very special ways.

1249
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:22,733
So I guess you know my name then.

1250
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,177
Yes. As soon as you tell me.

1251
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,650
Well, Jake, it's so interesting,
'cause I feel like there...

1252
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:33,655
Investigative Journalism
is not an official major here,

1253
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:36,819
- but my name is Beverly.
- Hello, Beverly.

1254
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:40,133
Hey. So, what do you study?

1255
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:42,620
What, the old
"What's your major" question?

1256
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,658
Is that really what you're asking me?

1257
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:45,970
I don't know.

1258
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:47,256
Hey, that's not really fair.

1259
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:49,901
I took special care.
I didn't say that word, okay?

1260
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:55,491
I'm just... I'm curious.
Maybe you study poetry, with that

1261
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:58,016
charming Rod McKuen bit
you quoted in your note.

1262
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:00,138
I'm pretty sure that'd be Whitman.

1263
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:02,292
I was just testing you. You pass.

1264
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:04,213
A. A-minus.

1265
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:08,614
So, what do you concentrate on here?

1266
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:14,254
I concentrate on theater and dance,
performing arts.

1267
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:16,901
Really? That's so cool.

1268
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,777
What do you do?
I mean, you didn't really answer me.

1269
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:22,296
You just made fun of me.

1270
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:25,135
I'm on the baseball team.

1271
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:26,371
- Really?
- Yeah.

1272
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,821
- No.
- Yeah.

1273
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,458
- You don't really seem like it.
- Seem like what?

1274
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:34,251
Aren't most athletes kind of...

1275
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,937
- Kind of dumb?
- No, no, no.

1276
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,500
No, not dumb necessarily.

1277
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:44,935
Single-minded, and...

1278
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,416
- Okay, dumb.
- You know, actually,

1279
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:50,379
there's probably
the same ratio of intelligence

1280
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:52,418
on my baseball team
as there is anywhere else.

1281
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:53,730
Which isn't very much.

1282
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,090
Unfortunately true.

1283
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:57,332
- Hey, Jake.
- Yeah?

1284
01:09:57,410 --> 01:10:00,254
I kinda hate talking on the phone
for extended periods of time.

1285
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:02,537
It feels so high school.

1286
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:04,812
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.
- Right? Yeah.

1287
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,779
Yeah, and now that I've determined
I don't really think

1288
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:08,818
you're the Hillside Strangler anymore...

1289
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,215
I think.

1290
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:15,260
Do you maybe wanna continue
this conversation in person?

1291
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:17,020
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

1292
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:18,979
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

1293
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:21,371
Well, I'm around
for the next couple of hours.

1294
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:25,171
Out, actually, for the rest of the day
and most of the night, though.

1295
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,491
Okay, so should I come over
like right now?

1296
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:31,216
- If you want.
- Cool, yeah, okay.

1297
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:32,451
I'll head over pretty soon then.

1298
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:34,658
Okay. Pretty soon. Then I'll see you then.

1299
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,095
- Okay, cool. Yeah, see you.
- Pretty soon.

1300
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:37,331
Okay.

1301
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:39,661
Fuck.

1302
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:43,494
So, what's your strategy?
What's the game plan?

1303
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,618
Don't tell me you're flying blind
into this thing.

1304
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:48,534
Dude, I don't know. I mean, she's cool.

1305
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:50,055
She's smart, you know?

1306
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:52,132
Not one of these airheads
we got running around here.

1307
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:55,181
Okay. Well, then just don't come across
like a dumb jock.

1308
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:56,935
All right, her antennas are out.

1309
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:00,093
She's gonna be looking
for signs of dip-shitification.

1310
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:01,660
Yeah. You trying to make me nervous?

1311
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:04,099
No, like they say, pressure's a choice.

1312
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:09,533
Well, you gotta approach it like getting
out on the mound, taking an at bat. Yeah.

1313
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:11,612
Put everything else out of your mind.

1314
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:12,976
Hey, Coma.

1315
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,415
Just let natural ability take over.

1316
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,857
Assuming, you know,
you have natural ability.

1317
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:20,901
A, fuck you. B, bye.

1318
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:25,979
C, she say if her roommate's
gonna be there?

1319
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:28,098
D, I don't know. Why?

1320
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:30,059
E, 'cause I think I'm gonna, you know,

1321
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:32,258
grant her the old Finnegasm.
Here, I'm coming with you.

1322
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,855
- No, F that and you.
- No, Jake, Jake!

1323
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:35,091
Come on, Jake!

1324
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:40,299
Just trying to help you! Ungrateful kid.

1325
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:41,860
Coma, wake up!

1326
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:57,580
- Hey.
- Hi, Jake.

1327
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,896
- Wanna come in? Okay.
- Sure. Yeah.

1328
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:08,976
Rock 'n' roll isn't about being
glamorous or hip, it's a force.

1329
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:15,251
It's a revolutionary, political,
sexual and poetic force.

1330
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:17,534
Yeah.

1331
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:19,100
You're not one of those guys
that thinks that

1332
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:21,218
Jim Morrison is still alive, are you?

1333
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,934
- No.
- Good.

1334
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,091
Why?

1335
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:26,059
I found it to be a good litmus test.

1336
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,859
Any other litmus tests?

1337
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:29,978
Not at the moment.

1338
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:32,776
So, you were really good
at baseball in high school?

1339
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:34,741
Yeah. I mean, every guy here

1340
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:36,972
was the baddest guy
on his high school team.

1341
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:38,256
You know, that's a big adjustment to make.

1342
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:39,377
You want a Dr. Pepper?

1343
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:41,339
No, no, I'm all right, thanks.

1344
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:43,412
You know, not only
are you not the best guy on the team,

1345
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:45,015
you know, you're barely even
good enough to be here.

1346
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:46,171
Yeah.

1347
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,740
You know?

1348
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,539
It's a little intimidating.

1349
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:53,179
What about you?
You play any sports in high school?

1350
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:54,780
No. We didn't even have any sports, no.

1351
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:55,931
- No?
- No.

1352
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:58,775
But it's the same thing that you're saying
with the performing arts.

1353
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:02,175
Everybody here was the best in their
high school, got the lead in every play,

1354
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,413
and now we're just gonna be hoping
to get cast in anything.

1355
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:06,935
And there's a lot of talent around.

1356
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:09,251
Yeah. Yeah.
Where did you go to high school?

1357
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:11,571
HSPVA.

1358
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:14,221
Which, although it sounds
like a venereal disease...

1359
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:15,337
Yeah.

1360
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:18,414
It's actually High School for
Performing and Visual Arts.

1361
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:20,458
- Like the one in Fame?
- Kind of.

1362
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:23,852
We weren't spontaneously performing
in the streets

1363
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:25,091
in large groups or anything,

1364
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:28,253
but we were so ridiculous.

1365
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:31,971
Like, the theater kids
would be hysterically crying

1366
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:33,336
in the bathroom stalls,

1367
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:36,619
visual artists like
anything they could find.

1368
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:38,021
Dancers...

1369
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:40,058
And musical theater kids...

1370
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:44,931
It was so fun, I loved it!

1371
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:46,819
Yeah, I loved it.

1372
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:51,020
And it was a great place
to be able to cultivate the thing

1373
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,138
that you loved most in life, you know?

1374
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:54,416
So you're really serious.

1375
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,618
Yeah, I'm moving to New York
the second I graduate.

1376
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:58,977
- Really?
- Yeah. God, I can't wait.

1377
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,971
So, what's this thing you're doing later?

1378
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:04,134
Helping decorate for a party at Oz.

1379
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:05,450
What's Oz?

1380
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:09,740
This big house just outside of town,
where a lot of theater majors live.

1381
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:13,053
And apparently the party's
a first weekend tradition.

1382
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:15,451
They, like, recruited us freshmen
to help set up.

1383
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,254
- Probably do the shit work.
- Nice.

1384
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,494
You could probably come, if you want.

1385
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:21,095
- Cool. Yeah, cool.
- Yeah, might be fun.

1386
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:23,537
I mean, we have our first practice
this afternoon, but yeah.

1387
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:26,454
- Yeah, it sounds great.
- Cool.

1388
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,181
Is it baseball season now?

1389
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:31,978
Okay. Well, when do you stop,
like, rehearsals

1390
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,052
and start doing the actual game?

1391
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,855
Well, the official season
doesn't start till the spring,

1392
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,170
but we got a big fall schedule.

1393
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:41,857
It's just a players-only practice
to kick things off.

1394
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:44,701
You know, it's kind of
a dress-up party tonight.

1395
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:46,693
You could come all sweaty
and in your uniform.

1396
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:48,858
People might think you're method,
I don't know.

1397
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:50,091
Might be a hit with the ladies.

1398
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,854
Now I definitely gotta be there.

1399
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,180
You're seriously trying?

1400
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,173
No, not right now, but I can't do it.

1401
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:00,411
It's impossible. I...

1402
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:01,531
I've never been able to do it.

1403
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:04,136
I know a lot about the human body,
and I've never seen anything like that.

1404
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,178
Watch this. You ready? Try to move.

1405
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:12,257
- We all tried it.
- No. It's impossible.

1406
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:13,570
What's up, dude? You gotta see this.

1407
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:14,697
What is it?

1408
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:16,661
It's this physiological phenomenon.

1409
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:18,778
You close your eyes
and somebody places a thumb

1410
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:20,534
below the chest bone in the solar plexus,

1411
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:22,772
semi-paralyzes the whole upper torso.

1412
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,136
- He can't sit up.
- That's ridiculous.

1413
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:26,258
- From here to here.
- Go on, show me.

1414
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:27,377
Dude, the whole team's tried it.

1415
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:28,736
- Try it again, Nesbit.
- Okay.

1416
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,740
Nope. I'm telling you,
it's absolutely impossible.

1417
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:33,892
It's a thumb
on your fucking chest, Nesbit.

1418
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,210
- You can't, no.
- Get up.

1419
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:36,371
I wanna give it a shot.

1420
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:37,895
I'm just saying, you can't do it.

1421
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:39,460
I know, he thinks he can. All right.

1422
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,698
Make sure and close your eyes,
'cause that shuts down the spinal.

1423
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,215
Okay, so shut up.

1424
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:45,133
Shut your eyes,

1425
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,178
and on the count of three,

1426
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:50,220
finger in the solar plexus,
count of three, try to sit up.

1427
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:53,015
One, two, three.

1428
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:59,217
Good job, baby! Good job!

1429
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,856
That's what I'm talking about, man!

1430
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:05,017
Beautifully played.

1431
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:07,741
The hiney was flawless.

1432
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:10,651
It all comes down to how well you sell it,
'cause when he was coming in,

1433
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:12,937
I was saying "impossible,"
and then when you put the...

1434
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:14,500
- And I was like...
- "What is he doing?"

1435
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,777
- The leg stuff.
- How does that happen?

1436
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:18,659
Hey, at least it was before
practice, all right?

1437
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:21,773
'Cause had it been after practice, who knows
what fucking sweaty and encrusted items

1438
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,375
I might've encountered up your ass crack.

1439
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,254
You're a freshman, too.
Not supposed to be hazing me.

1440
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,934
Hey, Jake, man, I'm sorry, all right?

1441
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,136
They made me do it.

1442
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,939
They just got me five minutes ago.

1443
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:32,581
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, and, you,

1444
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:35,733
with all your physiological
phenomena bullshit.

1445
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:38,381
Okay, you know, we all take turns
being chumps around here.

1446
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:42,375
Now, you accept your chumpification,
you wear it well, and you pass it on.

1447
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:43,690
It's all you can do.

1448
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,216
Well, well, well, if it ain't
Beuter Perkins! Hey!

1449
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:47,820
Speaking of.

1450
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:56,053
- Hey, Beuter!
- Beuter Perkins!

1451
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:59,532
All right now, boys,
it's Billy Autrey, okay?

1452
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,971
Did you give her two solid inches, Beuter?

1453
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:06,021
Hey, so, Pops, you pick out a name yet?

1454
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:08,661
No, sir. She got the rag.

1455
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:11,893
Really? No fucking way!

1456
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,495
Hey, what's wrong with Jacob?

1457
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:14,901
- You gotta see this.
- Yeah.

1458
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:16,938
It's this physiological phenomenon.

1459
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:18,341
You close your eyes, and somebody places

1460
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:20,492
their finger below the chest bone,
in the solar plexus,

1461
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,413
it semi-paralyzes the whole torso.

1462
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:23,935
Impossible to move.

1463
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:26,018
- How about that?
- Hey, Beut, you gotta try this.

1464
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:27,580
One of them old phenomegans, huh?

1465
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:29,414
I can't. Fucking I can't.

1466
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:32,460
I'll let you boys deal
with that hocus-pocus junk.

1467
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:35,052
Isn't that how you always fuck?

1468
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:37,498
Rally back.

1469
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,900
So, how'd it go with the Beverly chick?

1470
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:41,779
Yeah, man, you get it in?

1471
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,139
She's cool, you know?

1472
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,934
Went about as well as it could've.

1473
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,861
Probably meeting up with her
at a party later tonight.

1474
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:49,977
What?

1475
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:51,620
What party?

1476
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:55,174
It's just something
for a bunch of performing arts majors.

1477
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:57,611
You know, at someone's house out of town.

1478
01:17:57,690 --> 01:17:58,771
Everybody up!

1479
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:03,301
Right arm cross.

1480
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:07,218
All right, fellas, who's gonna
be the first poor fuck

1481
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:10,533
to take batting practice off Jay Niles

1482
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:13,580
and his 95-mile-an-hour fastball?

1483
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:16,460
- The fuck is wrong with that guy?
- I'm not doing it.

1484
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:18,857
- He doesn't throw 95.
- No.

1485
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:19,897
Get out of my way.

1486
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:22,371
Hey, man, I'm doing it, huh?

1487
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:25,101
What? Let's go! Come on! What'd you say?

1488
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,820
Guy's a fucking loon.

1489
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,932
Willoughby! Come over here.

1490
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:34,935
Get all your stuff.

1491
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:46,340
What the hell?

1492
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:49,896
- What's going on?
- Well, boys,

1493
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:53,020
here for a good time,
not a long time, right?

1494
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:56,657
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

1495
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:59,052
Get your ass ready. Let's go.

1496
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:01,175
- Jesus Christ, not this psychopath.
- Shit.

1497
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:03,179
Here you go, Plum.

1498
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:04,940
This'll be interesting.

1499
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:07,377
- What is that?
- What is he doing?

1500
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:13,293
Did he just throw the ball
in the fucking parking lot?

1501
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:14,895
Yeah. There it goes.

1502
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,614
- What the fuck?
- Let's go!

1503
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:25,177
- I'm ready. Get in the box.
- Jeez, let's not.

1504
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:26,251
Go get him, kid.

1505
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:28,776
Guy's gonna have a fucking
aneurysm on the mound.

1506
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:31,892
Fucking looney tune.

1507
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:33,734
Yeah.

1508
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:37,336
Yeah!

1509
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:39,373
Jesus fucking Christ, damn it.

1510
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:41,259
It's batting practice.

1511
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,540
Hit it to me! The ball's coming to me!

1512
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:47,740
- Yeah.
- Fuck this. I'm done.

1513
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,016
Fuck this guy.

1514
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:52,532
- Fucking nutjob. Ridiculous.
- You don't want any more?

1515
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:55,341
- All right.
- Fucking batting practices.

1516
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:06,132
Don't fuck it up, man. Let's go.

1517
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:09,217
Yeah.

1518
01:21:14,290 --> 01:21:15,576
That's strike one.

1519
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:17,379
- Hey, Detroit!
- Yeah?

1520
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:19,094
Those fucking goggles,
you can't use those to read?

1521
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:20,979
The schedule says "batting practice."

1522
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:22,700
Scrimmage is later. What the fuck, man.

1523
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,295
Yeah. All right, well, I'm not afraid

1524
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:26,134
to get this over with
right here, right now.

1525
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:28,576
Get what over?

1526
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,857
I'm a fucking pro prospect,
too, and you know it.

1527
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,578
I'm not afraid to challenge you, man.

1528
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:35,618
And everybody else on this team.

1529
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:39,775
And I'm not afraid to stick it in
and break it off from day one!

1530
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,091
All right?

1531
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:44,700
Okay, meat, you wanna try
to make that starting rotation

1532
01:21:44,810 --> 01:21:47,177
on your first BP session?

1533
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:49,491
Be my guest.

1534
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:51,379
Practice like you play, man.

1535
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:55,172
Shut his fucking mouth.

1536
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:08,936
Yeah.

1537
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:11,333
Good hit, McReynolds.

1538
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:14,141
I think you've had enough, raw dog.

1539
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,371
That the best shit you got?

1540
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:18,616
That ain't close to touching 90, son.
Who you fooling?

1541
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:20,818
Go get that ball,
I'll fucking sign it for you.

1542
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:24,377
Yeah. Real funny, man. Real funny.

1543
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:26,532
You know, it's first day
of practice, all right?

1544
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:28,939
Just warming up.

1545
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,694
You know, I will go get the fucking ball.

1546
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:31,817
You know what I'll do?

1547
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:33,699
I'll shove it up your ass and I'll sign it!

1548
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:34,771
How's that sound?

1549
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,215
Yeah, hey, you know what,
do what you do best, Niles,

1550
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:39,055
keep running that fucking mouth,
'cause it makes you feel better, right?

1551
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:40,501
You get your teammates
in a fight and kicked out

1552
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:42,220
of a bar, 'cause you wanna
look fucking tough?

1553
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:44,651
You're fucking selfish, man!
It's about the team here!

1554
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:47,097
It's not about you! Go fuck yourself.

1555
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:50,333
You know what, man?
I only know 150%, all right?

1556
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:52,299
You want me on the mound!

1557
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:54,611
You know I'm a fucking
ballplayer, all right?

1558
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:55,771
You don't get it!

1559
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:57,571
Fuck!

1560
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:01,254
Too fucking philosophical for this shit.

1561
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:03,775
Fucking balls.

1562
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:06,335
Fuck that shit.

1563
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:10,577
Yeah.

1564
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,061
Way to go! Run, run, run!

1565
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:24,937
Hey, where's my helmet at?

1566
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:26,774
It's the one with the three
scratches on the bill.

1567
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,377
It's my good luck helmet.

1568
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:29,497
You know what I'm talking about, Finn.

1569
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:30,771
It's the one with the three
scratches on the bill.

1570
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:31,976
There's five helmets right there.

1571
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:33,859
Yeah, grab a helmet
and get in the box. Come on.

1572
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:35,170
Hey, batter up!

1573
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:37,896
Might as well put a strikeout
down in the books, fellas.

1574
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:41,531
Why is the .230 hitter always
the most superstitious?

1575
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,931
News flash, it's not working.
Get some new superstitions.

1576
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:48,411
- You got superstitions.
- No, I have routines.

1577
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:49,616
Big difference.

1578
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:52,018
- No.
- Superstitions are

1579
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:53,933
a holdover from primitive humans

1580
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:56,456
finding simple reasons for
things they don't understand.

1581
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:58,498
- Yeah.
- Verifiably a complete waste

1582
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:00,692
of mental capacity in this day and age.

1583
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:04,013
I'm just saying, in a deterministic event,
such as hitting a baseball,

1584
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:07,651
there actually is a strict relation
between cause and effect.

1585
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:10,415
Now, superstition, it's bringing a...

1586
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:12,413
A probabilistic framework
and projecting meaning

1587
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:14,140
onto a completely random sequence.

1588
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:19,212
Yeah!

1589
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,934
See, we can deduce from that,

1590
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:23,257
that the lucky helmet
was probably not the factor

1591
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:25,059
in Coma's ability to get a hit

1592
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:27,411
because he was just able
to do so without it.

1593
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:29,857
The question now will be
if this new, random helmet

1594
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:31,091
now becomes Coma's lucky helmet.

1595
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:32,981
Exactly.

1596
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:35,337
- What's happening, boys?
- Attaboy, Dale.

1597
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:39,651
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1598
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:42,540
Hey, Coma, Pete Ward
just saw your first hit, man.

1599
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:45,295
- Pete Ward's here? Yeah, baby.
- Yeah.

1600
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:46,781
Who's Pete Ward?

1601
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:48,693
Legendary super scout for the Reds.

1602
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:49,851
Master of disguise.

1603
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:51,819
Yeah, yeah, he never wants
people to know he's watching,

1604
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:53,972
so he'll disguise himself somehow.

1605
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:56,576
- Anybody spotted him?
- Give me a second.

1606
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,533
Anybody? Come on. Finn?

1607
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:00,214
- Finn, don't disappoint me.
- Give me a second.

1608
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:02,941
Come on, it's right
in front of you, brother.

1609
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:09,136
Out there past the right field fence,
painting the trim on the house.

1610
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:10,621
Good spot, bro!

1611
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:13,534
Thank you. Thank you.
Give me my adoration.

1612
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:14,816
How's that for incentive?

1613
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:17,291
First scrimmage game,
not even an official practice,

1614
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:20,055
we already got the scouts here
checking us out.

1615
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:22,261
Welcome to the big time, boys.

1616
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:24,135
Fucking A, man.

1617
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:26,212
That's what I'm talking about.

1618
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:35,574
All right, boys, let's go!

1619
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:37,140
- Hey, Bradford.
- Yeah.

1620
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:38,740
- You warm?
- Yeah.

1621
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,699
You're on the hill. Plum, you're catching.

1622
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:43,971
- All right, go get 'em, Jake.
- Let's go, fellas.

1623
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:47,130
You got it. Attaboy.

1624
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:04,974
McReynolds.

1625
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:15,135
Good hit.

1626
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:18,455
We're cool.

1627
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,972
- Strike!
- Come on, Plum.

1628
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:37,131
Man, that's strike three.

1629
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:38,496
Come on, Plum, we're friends, man.

1630
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:39,577
That's strike three. Dude, just sit down.

1631
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:41,771
Friends don't strike out friends,
especially when we're freshman friends.

1632
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:43,056
Fucking swing the bat, man.

1633
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:45,815
You're making us look bad. Just sit down.

1634
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:51,176
You wanna rub your strikeout
on me, man? Jesus.

1635
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:53,934
What's up, Mac?

1636
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,578
Don't talk to me when I'm hitting.

1637
01:26:56,970 --> 01:26:58,335
Yes, sir.

1638
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:01,811
All right, freshman ping-pong champ.

1639
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,216
Let's see what you got, kid.

1640
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:07,254
Here we go, Jake.

1641
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,017
Strike. 0-1?

1642
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:19,661
- Make it 0-2.
- 0-2?

1643
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:21,579
- Yeah.
- 0-2!

1644
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:36,253
Two, two, two, two! Ball's in the gap!

1645
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:39,211
- Get two, McReynolds, get two.
- There we go.

1646
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:43,339
Attaboy, Mac!

1647
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:45,660
That's what I'm talking about.

1648
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:47,892
Sweet double, McReynolds!

1649
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:49,774
- Good hit, Mac!
- Hey, nice hit.

1650
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:52,456
Welcome to college ball, freshman.

1651
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:57,938
All right, boys.
All right, bring it up, bring it up!

1652
01:27:58,050 --> 01:28:00,052
If I look good, I fucking play good.

1653
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:01,814
All right, listen up, good first practice.

1654
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:03,301
All right? This is where it all starts.

1655
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:04,781
We're out here,
ahead of all the other teams

1656
01:28:04,890 --> 01:28:06,301
in the country, and we're
gonna keep it that way

1657
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:07,656
and work hard all year, right?

1658
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:09,459
Yeah!

1659
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:11,618
All right then, boys, y'all be good.

1660
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:14,100
Not so fast.

1661
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:18,176
We have a little tradition out here
welcoming in the new guys.

1662
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,814
It's called a little bit of freshmen...

1663
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:22,733
Batting practice!

1664
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:43,136
Oh, gosh!

1665
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:45,411
Fuck!

1666
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:50,331
- My nuts!
- Let's go, boys! Come on!

1667
01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:51,411
Fuck!

1668
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:06,775
Dale! Dale! Dale! Dale!

1669
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:16,051
That was not good.

1670
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:17,939
Say cheese, baby!

1671
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:21,654
Say cheese!

1672
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:30,293
That's how we do it.

1673
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:43,891
Whatever, girls.

1674
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:45,570
Did you get hit, Jacob?

1675
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:48,096
Yeah, man. They got me on the wrist,
and they almost knocked me in the nuts.

1676
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:50,099
Shoot, man.
They got me on the shoulder with one,

1677
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:52,857
but, hey, they said a few years back,
one ol' boy got hit in the head

1678
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:55,331
and nearly knocked
his eyeball out of its socket.

1679
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:58,137
- Is that enough for you? Okay.
- Yes. Yes.

1680
01:29:58,210 --> 01:29:59,939
Gotta get some meat on that boy's bones.

1681
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:01,375
Hey.

1682
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:03,976
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd graduated.

1683
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:06,770
Look, maybe it just feels
like I've been here too long.

1684
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:08,420
You have.

1685
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:11,057
- Hey, Jacob.
- What?

1686
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:15,856
Unreal, doggie, we made it!

1687
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:19,013
This isn't what I was expecting at all.

1688
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:20,774
Well, what were you expecting, Beuter?

1689
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:25,615
Shoot, man, it's just, you know,
I tell you, it's kind of confusing.

1690
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:26,930
Well, what's confusing, Perkins?

1691
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:28,774
Well, besides your ever-changing name.

1692
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:30,693
Good grief, guys, come on now.

1693
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:35,813
All right, look, y'all, so a buddy of mine
told me that last year,

1694
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:38,177
one of his professors
in them scientific classes

1695
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:40,571
told him that there's no historical proof

1696
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:41,816
Jesus Christ ever existed.

1697
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:44,774
Who gives a turd what some
egghead professor says?

1698
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:48,133
Seems like there's a lot of stuff
going on around here, you know?

1699
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:50,497
Just lots of different types of stuff

1700
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:53,301
and temptations, and things like that.

1701
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:54,815
- Beuter.
- Yes, sir.

1702
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:56,574
Are you prepared to
fold like a lawn chair?

1703
01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:58,935
Private Beuter, are you prepared

1704
01:30:59,050 --> 01:31:01,178
- to fold like a lawn chair?
- Sir, no, sir.

1705
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,615
Good! Then don't.

1706
01:31:02,730 --> 01:31:06,451
I'll give you freshmen a little advice
on how to get your shit together, okay?

1707
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:08,134
You're at a new level here.

1708
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:10,656
You're pissing in the tall grass
with the big dick dogs now.

1709
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:13,176
Hell, you got 21, 22-year-old
guys over there

1710
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:15,981
who, at this stage, see you as someone
trying to take their position.

1711
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:17,979
But what you limp cocks
don't seem to realize

1712
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:20,661
is that you have not earned
teammate status yet.

1713
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,491
And until you do, you're nobody.

1714
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:25,732
And not only do those guys
not give a fuck about you,

1715
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:28,421
they would love to watch
every single one of you fail.

1716
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:32,171
I already told you, Jake,
this ain't high school, man.

1717
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:33,854
You guys aren't the All-Stars
you thought you were

1718
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:35,932
back from wherever the hell
it is you came from.

1719
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:38,451
Here, you're on your own.

1720
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:40,656
And it's competitive, man.

1721
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:44,257
So, shit, if you wanna succeed,
really succeed, the only choice you have

1722
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:46,810
is to mentally toughen the fuck up.

1723
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:49,698
- Yes, sir.
- Temptation, my asshole.

1724
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,094
Temptation his asshole?

1725
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:55,014
- Dude, did you guys hear?
- What?

1726
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:56,660
Willoughby's gone!

1727
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:59,455
- What?
- Busted!

1728
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:01,692
- What, weed?
- Nah, dude.

1729
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:05,616
He's 30! Like, he's 30 fucking years old!

1730
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:07,692
- Thirty!
- Like a three and a zero.

1731
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:09,374
- No fucking way.
- No, sir.

1732
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:11,612
Yes, sir! No, no, no! Get this, get this.

1733
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:15,092
Willoughby isn't even his real name.

1734
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:17,218
Dude, it's like a secret identity!

1735
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:19,497
Yeah, no,
the registrar's office discovered it.

1736
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:22,616
They were looking up on some
transfer hours that looked fishy.

1737
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:25,375
They'd been investigating it for a while,
and told the coach this afternoon.

1738
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:26,616
That's what that was all about.

1739
01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:27,737
- No way.
- Dude, what?

1740
01:32:27,810 --> 01:32:30,177
Yeah. No, not only that,

1741
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:32,776
but they think he's been
doing this to other colleges.

1742
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:36,252
- Transferring, playing ball.
- Is he still here?

1743
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:39,254
Nah, man. We just went by the house.

1744
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:40,531
Van's gone, he's gone.

1745
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:42,652
All his shit's gone, man.

1746
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:45,019
He just left one thing, man.

1747
01:32:45,090 --> 01:32:48,617
In the middle of our room,
he left a Pink Floyd album

1748
01:32:48,690 --> 01:32:51,216
and a big-ass joint on top.

1749
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:52,576
We smoked it!

1750
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:56,741
You know, he's probably just a guy that
wasn't quite good enough to play pro ball,

1751
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:59,336
but he loved baseball
and he just wanted to keep playing.

1752
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:01,691
- And living the college life.
- Maybe that, too.

1753
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:04,216
He's not a bad guy. He just got caught.

1754
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:05,337
I liked him.

1755
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:06,616
- Good pitcher, too.
- Yeah.

1756
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:10,291
Brum!

1757
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:13,856
- How's this?
- Let's see. Oh, shit.

1758
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:15,819
It's one card away
from a Saskatchewan straight.

1759
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:17,699
- You know what that is?
- What?

1760
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:19,260
You might as well show 'em.

1761
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:20,775
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

1762
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:23,211
What is it?

1763
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:24,780
It's called a Manitoba Moose.

1764
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:26,818
- You're fucked, Brum.
- What?

1765
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:29,661
Well, the rules state that, if you
ever wanna play this game again...

1766
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:32,017
If you wanna stay on this team, bro.

1767
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:33,655
I do.

1768
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:37,180
You have to fly to Winnipeg, you have
to drive to Caribou River Park Reserve

1769
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,297
in Manitoba,

1770
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:41,540
you have to walk out on the tundra,
you have to find a moose,

1771
01:33:42,570 --> 01:33:45,141
carefully get under said moose...

1772
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:48,211
You gotta suck its dick.

1773
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:53,210
- Really?
- Yeah.

1774
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:56,012
- Happened once before.
- Wait, really?

1775
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:58,331
- He was a good guy.
- He was a great guy.

1776
01:33:58,410 --> 01:34:00,981
- Anyway, you guys all pass?
- Yeah, that's it, man.

1777
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:04,259
Take off, you hosers!
It's a Winnipeg Flip!

1778
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:08,096
O Canada!

1779
01:34:08,170 --> 01:34:11,891
Our home and native land!

1780
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:14,576
True patriot love...

1781
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:16,539
What the fuck game are they playing?

1782
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:17,896
I mean, they say it's called "O Canada,"

1783
01:34:17,970 --> 01:34:20,780
but I'm pretty sure they're just making
it up as they go along, you know?

1784
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:24,855
Like most things with these guys,
it's total bullshit.

1785
01:34:24,930 --> 01:34:27,251
But why, you know?

1786
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:29,338
It's more about seeing
how witty they can be.

1787
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:30,690
Like that whole Pete Ward thing.

1788
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:32,932
What do you mean, "the Pete Ward thing"?

1789
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:35,098
- Pete Ward.
- What about him?

1790
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:37,741
The super scout for the Reds?
Master of disguise?

1791
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:39,972
- They made all that up, too.
- Yeah?

1792
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,575
Are you trying to... Pete Ward ain't real?

1793
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:42,731
Come on.

1794
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:44,733
Hey, guys, guys, Plum and bitch boy think

1795
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:46,653
Pete Ward's real.

1796
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:51,292
- What are you implying?
- Yeah, Jake.

1797
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:52,940
Who are you to say he isn't real?

1798
01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:54,614
Yeah, "bitch boy."

1799
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:55,930
Okay, he's real.

1800
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:57,899
Hey, Jake, you're still not
saying where that party is.

1801
01:34:57,970 --> 01:34:59,051
What party?

1802
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:00,734
Jake's got a big party tonight.

1803
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:02,892
Supposed to meet up with
this hot dancer-actress chick,

1804
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:04,301
but he doesn't want us to be there.

1805
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:06,498
Hey, hold on, hey, I'm not saying
you guys can't come, all right?

1806
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:08,419
Did I say that? No.

1807
01:35:08,530 --> 01:35:10,612
I just implied you guys
might be bored, that's all.

1808
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:12,897
Dancer chicks have great asses.

1809
01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:14,051
Now, that's a fact, I know that.

1810
01:35:14,130 --> 01:35:16,531
Let me get this straight. A freshman

1811
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:20,171
is trying to stop us from
going to a party, is that...

1812
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:24,053
It's not even that we're not invited to
this party, he just doesn't want us to go.

1813
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:26,741
Did I ever say that? No, okay?

1814
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:28,733
I was just implying that
this party might not be

1815
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:31,381
your guys' cup of tea,
but, I mean, fuck it,

1816
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:32,531
you guys can come with me if you want.

1817
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:39,016
I don't wanna embarrass you
in front of all your new

1818
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:40,694
artsy-fartsy theater major friends.

1819
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:42,937
We're gonna stay here,
we're gonna play cards, you have fun.

1820
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:47,379
Give me a fucking break. Finn. Finn. Finn.

1821
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:48,980
- Hey, come on, look at me.
- Don't do it.

1822
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:50,734
- Hey, look at me. Look at me.
- Don't look.

1823
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:52,175
Stay strong.

1824
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:54,298
All right, I beg you. No, I implore you

1825
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:56,818
to come to this party.

1826
01:35:56,890 --> 01:35:58,460
All right, I realize that
I wouldn't know how to make it

1827
01:35:58,530 --> 01:36:01,659
through this world without all
of your unsolicited wisdom.

1828
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:05,576
And all you guys' constant fuckwithery.

1829
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:09,814
- What do you say?
- You don't really mean that.

1830
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:12,419
I wouldn't say it if I didn't.

1831
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:16,896
- Can you give us a moment?
- Of course I can.

1832
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:22,018
- Your call.
- I wanna go.

1833
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:25,578
- Theater party.
- Theater party.

1834
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:27,539
Theater party!

1835
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:30,453
Guys, were we supposed to wear a costume?

1836
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:32,937
You are in costume, of a dipshit.

1837
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:35,818
Shit, it's the Led Zeppelin dude.

1838
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:37,096
Yo, what's happening, man?

1839
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:39,178
- It's creepy!
- Tell me about it.

1840
01:36:41,970 --> 01:36:43,495
Holy shit.

1841
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:46,457
The inside is even weirder.

1842
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:47,656
This ain't no frat party.

1843
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:49,734
Here's what we're gonna do.

1844
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:52,453
Feel the freak!

1845
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:58,097
Dude, how great is this?

1846
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:04,420
Hey, girls, how you doing? I'm Roper.

1847
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:06,897
Hey, Brum, go get some drinks, man.

1848
01:37:13,570 --> 01:37:14,981
Fuck!

1849
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:16,939
- Did you see that?
- What?

1850
01:37:17,050 --> 01:37:18,097
A fucking cat.

1851
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:20,093
Cats shouldn't be in fridges.

1852
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:35,017
Best costume ever. Amazing.

1853
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:37,616
- Jake! Hey! Hi!
- Hey! Hey!

1854
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:40,496
- You're blonde!
- I know.

1855
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:42,692
I'm really glad you came.

1856
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:46,019
Except for, I think... This one.

1857
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:48,377
- Yeah, you need this. Yeah.
- Yeah?

1858
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:52,977
Hi. I'm Debra Kadabra.

1859
01:37:53,730 --> 01:37:55,016
What are you gonna do with that?

1860
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:58,890
And now, I can officially
welcome you to Oz.

1861
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:00,620
Hi, guys. I'm Beverly.

1862
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:01,896
- Hi, Beverly.
- Good to see you.

1863
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:03,938
Three words,

1864
01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:06,980
thoroughly equipped dungeon.

1865
01:38:11,810 --> 01:38:13,574
Can I borrow you for something
really quickly?

1866
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:15,732
'Cause someone dropped out,
and it's really easy,

1867
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:17,699
and it's gonna be really fun.

1868
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:19,135
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay.

1869
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:22,293
Well, I gotta go inside for a second,
but I'll see you soon.

1870
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:23,496
- Cool.
- Okay.

1871
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:49,891
He's being modest.

1872
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:51,739
Not only is he a pre-season All-American,

1873
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:54,290
you're gonna be seeing
this guy on TV someday.

1874
01:38:54,370 --> 01:38:56,099
Now, this guy,

1875
01:38:56,210 --> 01:38:58,690
this guy's the best
third baseman in the state!

1876
01:38:58,810 --> 01:39:00,778
Like a fucking vacuum cleaner
down there, man.

1877
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:02,454
Fuck that.
We're taking that shit this year.

1878
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:03,531
It's this year.

1879
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:04,611
Hey, that's what I'm talking about, man.

1880
01:39:04,690 --> 01:39:06,260
Fuck losing the playoffs.
We're taking it all this year.

1881
01:39:06,330 --> 01:39:08,139
- You're into astrology?
- Of course.

1882
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:09,371
So, you've had your chart done?

1883
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:11,578
Yeah. It's fascinating.

1884
01:39:11,730 --> 01:39:13,494
I'm a Leo.

1885
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:16,972
Yeah, I know, I know.
A little full of myself.

1886
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:19,212
But I'm very loyal...

1887
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:20,291
Confident...

1888
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:21,781
Right.

1889
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:26,261
The chart says I'm overly confident,
but the truth is

1890
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:29,293
I wound easily.

1891
01:39:30,170 --> 01:39:32,298
It also says I'd make
a great father someday,

1892
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:34,213
but I don't know.

1893
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:38,172
You gotta be shittin' me, man!

1894
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:40,696
You wound easily, poor Finnegan.

1895
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:43,979
Astrology?
Mr. Cause-and-Effect Rationalist?

1896
01:39:44,410 --> 01:39:46,219
Who are these guys?

1897
01:39:46,690 --> 01:39:49,421
Excuse us. I'm a Scorpio.

1898
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:52,212
- I'm Jake.
- Don't do it.

1899
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:57,139
Has he told you about his average cock?

1900
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:01,614
Has he told... Finn!
Did you tell her, Finn?

1901
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:04,096
Did you tell her?

1902
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:05,979
"Hey, so have you had your chart done?"

1903
01:40:06,050 --> 01:40:08,530
"Yeah, I'm a Leo.
You know, very confident..."

1904
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:11,136
You know what, if I had a prohibition
against sleeping with all women

1905
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:13,377
who believed in astrology,
I'd still be a virgin, all right?

1906
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:14,781
I'm being practical.

1907
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:17,496
I'd rather die a virgin
than say my chart says

1908
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,772
I'll make a good father someday.

1909
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:23,016
Just because you guys are laying bricks
with the ladies, you know, I stepped up.

1910
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:25,172
I was talking her language,
I was meeting her on her level.

1911
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:26,815
Instead of making fun of me,
you should be taking notes.

1912
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:27,931
Yeah?

1913
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:29,011
And by the way,
she was really fucking cute.

1914
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:30,171
She was really fucking cute,

1915
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:32,372
and you immature jerkoffs
just fucked up my whole rap!

1916
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:33,531
Coming around talking shit like that.

1917
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:34,850
You know what, your little...

1918
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:38,491
Fucking little jealous asshole crap
just pulling me back in the boiling pot!

1919
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:40,260
Finn, come on!

1920
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:41,377
By the way, you know what?

1921
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:44,056
Have you noticed,
whenever we're around baseball,

1922
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:45,814
all we talk about is pussy.

1923
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:49,218
Now, we're actually around a few
potentially interesting young women,

1924
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:51,611
all you talk about is baseball!

1925
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:53,818
It's a little fucked up!

1926
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:05,137
Bachelor number three,

1927
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:08,532
what would be your dream date
and your dream girl?

1928
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:11,650
My dream girl and my dream date.

1929
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:14,211
- Yes.
- That's a very tough question.

1930
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:17,294
I suppose my dream girl
would come bearing tea

1931
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:18,451
and special crumpets,

1932
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:21,101
preferably in the bed, as well.

1933
01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:23,855
And we could get hopped up
on the tea and the crumpets.

1934
01:41:24,130 --> 01:41:25,859
- Is this the Mad Hatter?
- Yes.

1935
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:27,574
Curious and curiouser.

1936
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:29,618
Bachelor number one!

1937
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:32,011
- Yes!
- Yes.

1938
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:33,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

1939
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:38,898
Give me your best pick-up line.

1940
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:43,613
Would you like to come see
my large collection of heads,

1941
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:46,136
so that I can give you some?

1942
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:49,492
Is the Queen of Hearts a dude?

1943
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:51,540
A good one.

1944
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:55,458
Red Queen, very interesting.

1945
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:57,134
That wasn't for you, sweetie.

1946
01:41:57,210 --> 01:41:58,450
Bachelor number two!

1947
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:01,659
What is the most trouble
you've ever gone to, to meet a girl?

1948
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:06,373
Bachelor number two? Are you there?

1949
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:08,619
I'm late!

1950
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:11,421
I'm late for a very important date.

1951
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:16,819
All right, Mr. Rabbit.

1952
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:18,858
It must've been awfully important like...

1953
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:20,420
Like a party or something.

1954
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:21,571
Yeah, totally.

1955
01:42:22,850 --> 01:42:24,090
All right then.

1956
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:26,172
Bachelor number one.

1957
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:28,218
You've just invited me over
for dinner, haven't you?

1958
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:32,380
307, right?

1959
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:35,132
The feminist.

1960
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:39,935
What, no speech?

1961
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:41,971
No.

1962
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:44,781
I'm kind of the silent type, you know?

1963
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,975
What's one kiss from...

1964
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:49,700
That is so sexy.

1965
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:52,896
- Priceless.
- Priceless, is it?

1966
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:58,338
Okay, being completely honest...

1967
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:02,092
When you said you liked
the quiet guy in the back seat best,

1968
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:04,931
was it just a line to piss off the
other guys in the car, or was it true?

1969
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:07,570
- Why do you ask?
- I'm curious.

1970
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:09,300
You're curious about what?

1971
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:11,937
You know, we all make up this
romantic crap in our heads.

1972
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:13,296
I'm just looking for some kind of...

1973
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:15,654
I think it's a little bit of both.

1974
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:16,731
What does that mean?

1975
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:19,414
Did I

1976
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:24,737
think that the quiet guy
in the back seat was cute?

1977
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:25,777
Yes.

1978
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:26,976
Okay.

1979
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:28,774
Would I have walked up to you

1980
01:43:28,850 --> 01:43:31,615
in a crowd, completely alone,
unprovoked, by the way,

1981
01:43:31,690 --> 01:43:34,057
and said that? No.

1982
01:43:34,130 --> 01:43:36,451
So, my obnoxious teammates
actually helped me on this one?

1983
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:39,058
- I think they did.
- Shit!

1984
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,541
They're good for something after all.

1985
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:44,621
I was definitely messing with them,
but I meant what I said.

1986
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:46,180
Don't make me say it again.

1987
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:54,576
Is this your first-choice school, or...

1988
01:43:54,650 --> 01:43:56,573
No, I applied to a few,
but this was the best school

1989
01:43:56,650 --> 01:43:58,300
that also offered me a scholarship.

1990
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:01,180
You mean, you had to, like,
write a bunch of essays

1991
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,775
and all that fun stuff?

1992
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:05,057
- Just one.
- What'd you write about?

1993
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:08,851
The topic was to take a Greek myth
and relate it to your own life.

1994
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:11,621
So you wrote about Aphrodite
and being a baseball slut.

1995
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:12,771
Kind of.

1996
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:14,659
Shit. No.

1997
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:17,654
I just took Sisyphus and baseball,
and just kinda...

1998
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:19,061
You wrote about that for your essay...

1999
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:21,701
How did you even, like...

2000
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:22,777
...those two things together?

2001
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:24,454
Yeah, I did, believe it or not.

2002
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:25,770
I mean, the point
of the whole thing is that

2003
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:27,898
the gods intend for Sisyphus
to suffer, right?

2004
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:29,335
Right.

2005
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:32,095
Well, my point was that
they'd actually blessed him

2006
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:34,298
with something to focus on, you know,

2007
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:37,101
something that he could
potentially find meaning in.

2008
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:41,294
You know, it's a gift to be striving at all,
you know, even if it looks futile to others.

2009
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:42,496
Yeah, that's true.

2010
01:44:42,570 --> 01:44:44,060
I mean, yeah, it's ridiculous
to roll a boulder

2011
01:44:44,130 --> 01:44:45,973
up a mountain over and over
and over again,

2012
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:48,178
but so is everything else in life.

2013
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,979
When you really think
about it, especially a game.

2014
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:52,178
Things only mean as much
as the meaningfulness

2015
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:54,901
that we allow them to have.

2016
01:44:54,970 --> 01:44:57,735
That's where I tie it in to baseball.

2017
01:44:57,810 --> 01:45:00,654
Just accepting whatever comes
my way, you know?

2018
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:02,732
Good, bad, doesn't matter.

2019
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:06,861
What matters is just getting
in that groove

2020
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:09,661
where the whole world kinda goes away,

2021
01:45:09,730 --> 01:45:12,301
and I'm just doing what
I'm supposed to be doing.

2022
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:14,976
I feel the same way about performing.

2023
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:18,213
It's putting yourself
out there in art, in life,

2024
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:20,292
just participating.

2025
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:21,337
Yeah.

2026
01:45:21,410 --> 01:45:23,697
Having the guts to look fucking stupid.

That was adorable. Just the whole like...

2058
01:48:14,410 --> 01:48:15,935
I think I got a tear in my eye, Jakie.

2059
01:48:16,050 --> 01:48:17,734
Oh, my goodness.

2060
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:20,895
We noticed that you never
made it home last night.

2061
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:25,459
- Are we to suppose...
- We're supposing.

2062
01:48:25,570 --> 01:48:27,857
Look, it's cool, guys.
All right. We had a nice time.

2063
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:29,375
- "A nice time"?
- Man, I know...

2064
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:30,861

01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:35,452
You like her! God, Jake!

2067
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:39,216
Don't you guys have class or something?

2068
01:48:39,290 --> 01:48:41,179
You know what, I do have class.

2069
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:42,854
But I go to class
when I say I go to class.

2070
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:44,534
You go to class.

2071
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:47,056
I want a full report on my desk
by the end of the day.

2072
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:50,657
Bibliography! Annotated! Highlighted!

2073
01:48:52,450 --> 01:48:53,736

Cho!

2075
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:12,417
It sounds like you rocked it last night.

2076
01:49:12,490 --> 01:49:13,457
How'd you do?

2077
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:14,895
Not bad.

2078
01:49:14,970 --> 01:49:18,213
Ended up with that tall chick
in the leather, you know,

2079
01:49:18,290 --> 01:49:19,894
- Debra Kadabra?
- Yeah?

2080
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:22,496
- Yeah, she's a senior.
- Yeah!

2081
01:49:22,570 --> 01:49:25,733
You know, she's not like,
actually a dominatrix.

2082
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:27,414
I didn't get beat up or anything.

2083
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:29,219
- Cool.
- That was just a costume.

2084
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:31,938
Yeah, we had ourselves a good ol' time.

2085
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:33,250
Nice, man.

2086
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:34,855
Who's this fuck?

2087
01:49:35,770 --> 01:49:37,772
I think that's our professor.

2088
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:40,012
- This guy?
- Yeah.

2089
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:41,979
No shit.

2090
01:49:42,050 --> 01:49:45,099
You know what, man, I got outta there
about 6:00 in the morning.

2091
01:49:45,170 --> 01:49:48,140
Shit, if I wasn't still drunk,
I think I'd be fucking dead.

01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:49,780
Yeah, me, too, man.

01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:29,579
- You talkin' to me?
- No, can't you see?
