1
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:10,512
- Nah.

2
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,447
- Yeah.

3
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,318
- No.

4
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,259
- Yeah.

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,396
- No.

6
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,305
- Yes.

7
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,206
- No.

8
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,282
- Yeah.

9
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:52,486
- All right, everybody.

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,455
What tactics did Charlotte
use to be able to achieve

11
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,224
her goal in the scene?

12
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,260
- She
made him uncomfortable

13
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,195
by lifting up his shirt.

14
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,897
- Yes.

15
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:04,498
She gained power in the scene

16
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,266
by making him feel uncomfortable
enough

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,535
to give up the chair.

18
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:11,773
But, she tried a variety
of different tactics

19
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:15,810
in order to get what she wanted,

20
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:16,878
which is what we should be doing

21
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,846
in every scene that we read.

22
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:20,615
Thank you Kieran.

23
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:21,448
Thank you Charlotte.

24
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,453
Now, I'm sure you're all very
anxious

25
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,624
to know what this season's
production is going to be.

26
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,465
We are going to be
putting on Billy Elliot,

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,237
Fin, home time.

28
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,277
- Do you want them to know?

29
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,419
- Do you ever wonder what people
would say at your funeral?

30
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:04,291
- No. I don't think I want to
know.

31
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,393
- Really?

32
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,294
- Yeah.

33
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,431
Probably be a bunch of bullshit.

34
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,737
- Well, I want a front
row seat to my funeral.

35
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,672
- Of course you would.

36
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,874
- What's that supposed to mean?

37
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,643
- I'm teasing.

38
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:24,679
- You're not, I don't care.

39
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:31,519
I wanna hear what they have
to say, even if it was all
bullshit.

40
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,920
- I'd rather rest in peace.

41
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,659
- You wouldn't even wanna
hear what I would have to say?

42
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:43,296
- Well, why don't you tell
me now, while I'm alive?

43
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,867
- No.

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,602
No, you're just gonna have to
wait.

45
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:49,369
- Till I'm dead?

46
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,872
- Mhm

47
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:51,739
Hm?

48
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:52,607
- Hm?

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,508
- Hm?

50
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,382
- What time is it?

51
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,219
- 6:47.

52
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,254
- I gotta go.

53
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,823
- Okay, let me drive you home.

54
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:09,857
- No.

55
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:11,726
- Come on, don't be an idiot.

56
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,494
- Oh, guess I'm an idiot.

57
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,871
- Ladies.

58
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,440
- We were just obsessing
over your brown bread

59
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,509
from last week's book club.

60
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,678
- Well, I could give you the
recipe,

61
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:32,279
but then I'd have to kill you.

62
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,383
Come here.

63
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,685
Did you hear about Bridgette?

64
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,486
- Oh yes, such a shame.

65
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:41,756
- I heard she left him,

66
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,825
coz he shacked up with
some hussy from Dublin.

67
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:46,393
- She didn't have to go and
leave him.

68
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,294
- I dunno.

69
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,298
- We all have tough shite to
deal with.

70
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,300
- Well, it's not setting a
very good precedent for us.

71
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,836
That's all.

72
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:58,039
- How's Kay doing with
her CAO submissions?

73
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,373
- She's got a few she's looking
at.

74
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,679
- She's such a special girl.

75
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,647
I'm sure she'll end up in the
right place.

76
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:08,448
- Hey K.

77
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,885
- Don't call me that.

78
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,352
- Sorry man, my bad.

79
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:14,889
- What's up Finn?

80
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:15,923
- Yeah, not much.

81
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:19,527
I kind of just was
wondering if we could talk?

82
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:21,662
- Okay.

83
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,363
- Well seeing as how you always
get,

84
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,264
usually get the best parts,

85
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,767
I just thought that maybe I
could get

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,835
like a little bit of advice off
you.

87
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:31,005
- Listen mate, I've gotta go.

88
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,807
- All right, yeah, no worries,
man.

89
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,575
Hey, maybe we can like get a
coffee

90
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,878
before audition sometime or..?

91
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,012
- Yeah, sure.

92
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,446
- Alright, cool.

93
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,515
I'll see you.

94
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,933
- Mams got the dinner nearly
ready.

95
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:14,168
- Hope she didn't make
her brown bread again.

96
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,170
- I'll be in in a sec.

97
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:18,139
- Need any help?

98
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,740
- No, I'll be fine.

99
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:20,641
- Okay.

100
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:35,189
- Now.

101
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,563
For what we are about to
receive,

102
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,065
may we be truly thankful.

103
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:45,900
Amen.

104
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,074
- So, ready for your
last day of school, Kay?

105
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:54,208
- Meats a bit dry.

106
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,111
- Just in time too.

107
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,647
I could do with your help.

108
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,984
I think the minxes are back
again.

109
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,053
Could be a bit of a frenzy.

110
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:07,822
Alastar slacked off fixing the
holes

111
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,223
in the hen house last season.

112
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,561
- I saw Elizabeth down in the
shop.

113
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,797
She says, Sean needs a date for
the debs.

114
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,233
And it's perfect.

115
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,069
You're looking so much better.

116
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:24,038
Now that her hair has grown out
a bit.

117
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:27,141
- I have auditions.

118
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,744
- Her hair is looking nice,
don't you think Declan?

119
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,613
- Is that the same Sean

120
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,582
who was caught running
naked down the street

121
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,984
last week after a few too many
pints?

122
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,086
- Let's not pretend you haven't
made

123
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,654
a bigger fool of yourself.

124
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:48,829
- Meat's good.

125
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:41,916
Come in.

126
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:44,718
- Good time?

127
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,888
I was thinking about
those damn minxes again.

128
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,326
Remember the time Alastar

129
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,761
thought one of them was the cat

130
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,329
and spent hours trying to catch
it?

131
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,832
- He even got up that tree.

132
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,070
It's late.

133
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,307
- I'll give you a lift
to school tomorrow, okay?

134
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,808
- No, you're all right.

135
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:08,742
- Come on.

136
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:09,977
It's your last day.

137
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,947
All right.

138
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,381
I get the message.

139
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:30,798
- What did they say about the
lads in England? They're uh...

140
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,166
They're quite fit.

141
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:37,037
- They can't be that different.

142
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:40,207
- Literally any variation
of the translucent eejits,

143
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,276
beats the plague of pink dick

144
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,410
that Ireland faces.

145
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,015
- Pink dick?

146
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,417
- Yeah, pink dick.

147
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:56,991
I thought Sean would be
different because you know,

148
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:58,826
he tans during the summer kind
of,

149
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,162
but couldn't have been more
wrong.

150
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,197
- Wait, you and Sean?

151
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:06,033
- Yeah, I rode him last week.

152
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:07,902
Remember?

153
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,906
You coming?

154
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,073
- Oh, I'll catch up.

155
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:30,484
Dad?

156
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,287
Mam?

157
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:42,890
- How many times have I-

158
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,127
Fuck, fuck, fuck-

159
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,533
- Mam.

160
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:52,933
Mam it-

161
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,436
Mam, it's not what it looks
like, okay?

162
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,572
Mam, mam, please.

163
00:13:57,605 --> 00:13:59,006
- Declan!

164
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,207
Declan!

165
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,342
It's gone too far.

166
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,242
- Mam.

167
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,406
Ahhh!

168
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,186
- Oi!

169
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:57,024
I have to practice my audition.

170
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:57,725
- Come on.

171
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,093
- No, I'm serious.

172
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:05,299
- Kieran.

173
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,200
Kieran.

174
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,037
- Do you have any idea what
we've been going through?

175
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,305
We've been attacked.

176
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:12,406
We've been fined.

177
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,475
We've been arrested.

178
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,678
The last thing that we need is
some

179
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:19,379
fuckin' do gooder
pissing about our family.

180
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,517
Putting ridiculous ideas into
our heads.

181
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,218
Ballet.

182
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,386
What are you trying to do m-

183
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,290
Was it my intonation?

184
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,359
- I would really like
you to read for Billy.

185
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:36,096
- I would like to
support my peers for once

186
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,599
instead of leading them.

187
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,266
- Oh, come on.

188
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,035
- Why don't we give Finn a shot?

189
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,339
- Lookit.

190
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,609
There are enough parts
for everyone to go around

191
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:52,312
and since when are you worried
about who gets, what part?

192
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,782
- Since I realized that in the
real world,

193
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:57,284
it doesn't always work like
this.

194
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,786
- Like what, Mr. Dearg?

195
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,755
- Like, I won't be
getting the lead always.

196
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,057
- Look, you're looking to
go to drama school, right?

197
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,059
- That's exactly why I want to
play Tony.

198
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,160
He'd explore my range.

199
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,596
- And Billy wouldn't?

200
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:13,433
- I don't wanna play Billy
because,

201
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,537
he and I are too similar.

202
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,473
- Lookit, I really think-

203
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,174
- Let me try again.

204
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:23,678
- All right.

205
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:25,713
- Okay.

206
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,456
Do you have any idea
we've been going through?

207
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,792
We've been attacked.

208
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:39,393
We've been fined.

209
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,562
We've been arrested.

210
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:43,765
- You are just being angry
for the sake of being angry.

211
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:47,569
Yes, Tony, he is prideful to a
fault,

212
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:50,505
but it's because he's been
formed

213
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:53,708
in a very demanding environment

214
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:57,277
and his masculinity is just a
facade.

215
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,081
- I know all that.

216
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:04,384
- Look, I really want
you to read for Billy.

217
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,420
- And I really think that Tony-

218
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,321
- Kieran.

219
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:12,159
You are one of my best students

220
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,697
and I would be doing you a
disservice,

221
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,333
if I did not insist that you at
least try.

222
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,335
Please.

223
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:24,304
- All right.

224
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,408
- I actually just now she has me
locked in

225
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,277
as like supporting character or
something.

226
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,345
- Prove her wrong then.

227
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,313
If you want the lead you
have to walk like a lead,

228
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,148
your shoulders are perpetually
hunched.

229
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,249
- No, they're not.

230
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,317
- Are too.

231
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:40,354
Hey look how Kieran does it.

232
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,154
Kieran.

233
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,790
Show Finn here what it looks
like

234
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:43,958
to walk like a leading man.

235
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:49,262
- You look like a prick.

236
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:52,533
- Ah, but a leading prick.

237
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,135
- He thinks Ms. Doyle
doesn't see him as a lead.

238
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:57,137
- Prove her wrong then.

239
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:07,515
- Kay.

240
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,416
We're just here to help.

241
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:10,918
- This isn't necessary.

242
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:11,819
- Kay.

243
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:14,488
- You have it wrong.

244
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:15,523
- It's all right, Kay.

245
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:16,456
- It's not all right.

246
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,592
It goes against God.

247
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,860
- Your mother is right, Kay.

248
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,762
Can you please come down here
and join us?

249
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,432
Whatever you have cooking
in there smells amazing.

250
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:28,201
I remember it was a three
Christmases ago.

251
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,838
I was over and you made a goose.

252
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:32,774
- It was two Christmases ago,
father.

253
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:36,209
- Kay.

254
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,879
Your hair has grown back nicely.

255
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,280
Kay, what your mother saw-

256
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,582
- She didn't see anything.

257
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:42,884
- Lies fester, Kay.

258
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,217
- I'm not lying.

259
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,285
- And the most dangerous lies

260
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,655
are the ones we tell ourselves.

261
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,757
- We only want what's best for
you.

262
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:50,625
- I'm fine.

263
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:53,661
- Denial is typical.

264
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:54,896
Now, with that being said,

265
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:58,498
the first step we need to take
is to dispose of the object.

266
00:19:58,533 --> 00:19:59,567
- I don't have it.

267
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,768
- You wouldn't mind if we
searched your room then?

268
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:01,703
- No.

269
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,406
I mean,

270
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,944
no, all right,

271
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:11,946
I'll get it.

272
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,853
- If we are too forceful,
she will retaliate.

273
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,689
We have to let her think this is
her idea,

274
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:24,224
or else she will never
truly come to her senses.

275
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:29,296
- Well, I'll put the kettle on.

276
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:05,566
- We need to talk about penance.

277
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,082
- Hurling isn't
the same since they

278
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,650
made the helmets compulsory.

279
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:25,987
- It's the same game

280
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,389
just a lot less broken noses.

281
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,358
- Well, that's exactly my point.

282
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,425
Why are we keeping our boys

283
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,628
from getting roughed up?

284
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:36,931
Broken bones, build character.

285
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:42,837
Dec gets it.

286
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,772
You were the best character
builder on the hurling pitch,

287
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:45,673
weren't ya Dec?

288
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,011
How many noses did you
break back in the day?

289
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:53,446
- Too many to count.

290
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,347
- Exactly.

291
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:00,353
Ah, Jesus Christ.

292
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:10,765
- Quinn came home last
night with eye makeup on.

293
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:15,503
He said it was nothing, his pals

294
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:16,704
were just messing around.

295
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:20,373
- You gotta beat that out of
him, before it goes too far.

296
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,845
- Well, I dunno about that.

297
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:26,647
What do you think Dec?

298
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:29,717
- I don't know.

299
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:31,953
I'm sure,

300
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:35,890
it's probably just a phase.

301
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:36,791
- Bullocks.

302
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:49,103
- Wives submit
yourselves to your own husbands

303
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:54,642
as to the Lord, where the
husband is head of the wife.

304
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:59,614
As Christ is head of the church

305
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,751
and he is the saviour of the
body.

306
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:06,486
Therefore,

307
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,791
just as the church is subject to
Christ.

308
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:15,596
So let the wives be to their own
husbands

309
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:17,497
in everything.

310
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:23,137
In the name of the father

311
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,872
and the son

312
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:26,173
and the holy spirit.

313
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:28,743
Amen.

314
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:44,592
Thank you all for being here
today.

315
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,561
But before we call it a Sunday,

316
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:49,630
it's to my understanding,

317
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:52,900
there's a new family in
the community from England.

318
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:57,238
Would everyone please join me

319
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:02,176
in welcoming Connor,
Keith and his son Egan.

320
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:15,022
- Let's introduce ourselves.

321
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:16,724
- Where did Kay go?

322
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,662
- Hey, how you doing?

323
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:23,631
- Nice to meet you.

324
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:25,132
- Nice to meet you.

325
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:29,103
Nice to meet you.

326
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:29,804
Hey.

327
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:31,539
- Lovely meeting you, finally.

328
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,741
We were due new neighbours
weren't we Declan?

329
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:35,643
- Hi, I'm Declan Dearg.

330
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:36,644
- Declan, pleasure.

331
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:37,845
- Gwinn.

332
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:38,846
- Gwinn.

333
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:42,583
Erm, I think our kids
met earlier in the week.

334
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:47,288
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

335
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,823
- Wrecked my shed too.

336
00:24:50,825 --> 00:24:53,260
- Hey it's alright.

337
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:55,997
I'm still trying to toughen
this one up though, you know?

338
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,632
No hard feelings, right?

339
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,534
- Oh.

340
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:01,235
- No

341
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:15,176
- Kay.

342
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:19,013
Where have you been?

343
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,314
- Sorry, dad.

344
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:22,917
I just needed some fresh air.

345
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,119
- You just kind of go around
disappearing like that.

346
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:29,623
- You beat that poor boy.

347
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:32,626
Such a nasty thing for a girl to
do.

348
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:35,229
What does that say about you?

349
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,798
Let alone what it says about our
family.

350
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:39,300
And you ruined his shed.

351
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,903
You'd be lucky if a boy like
that took interest in you

352
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:46,073
and you go around beating them
up.

353
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:48,209
- You haven't got the full
story.

354
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:50,077
He tackled me from behind.

355
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:51,912
- You can't run around blame
free, Kay.

356
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:54,148
There are consequences for your
actions.

357
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,317
- You're right.

358
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,319
I'm sorry.

359
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:00,721
- Words, that's all that is.

360
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:01,856
- Gwinny.

361
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:04,024
- No, she needs to knows
what a right mess she's made.

362
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:05,893
You were such a good baby.

363
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:08,129
What happened?

364
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:12,266
You're going to make
things right with that boy.

365
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,668
You'd be lucky if he paid
you any mind after all this,

366
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:16,003
but you are sure going to try.

367
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:22,409
Give it.

368
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:29,150
- He would have wanted-

369
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:31,952
- No, I won't hear that.

370
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:34,922
Why must you insist on
reminding me constantly?

371
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,991
- You're all right, dear.

372
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:41,695
We're all right.

373
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:43,697
Why don't you go upstairs and
lie down

374
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:45,900
and I'll bring you up a nice cup
of tea.

375
00:27:56,744 --> 00:28:00,247
It's been so hard on your
mother.

376
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:02,850
- It's been hard on all of us.

377
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:03,918
- Still.

378
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,222
You have to show her some
understanding.

379
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:13,394
- I don't mean to upset her.

380
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:14,428
- Then why must you?

381
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:20,868
Make nice with that boy.

382
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:24,171
Fix the shed.

383
00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:54,268
- You're a Dearg
and you don't take shit.

384
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:55,869
Say it.

385
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,137
- I'm a Dearg

386
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,005
and we don't take shit.

387
00:28:58,038 --> 00:28:59,340
- Say it again!

388
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:02,009
- I'm a Dearg
and we don't take shit.

389
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:04,111
- Say it again.

390
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:07,881
- I'm a Dearg
and we don't take shit!

391
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:17,519
- Oi.

392
00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:29,463
- Fuckin' thing.

393
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,100
- It's your mess.

394
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,569
- It's your shed.

395
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:36,270
It'll be your hole.

396
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:50,585
- What kind of bloke doesn't
know how to patch a hole?

397
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:53,621
- The same "bloke" that beats
your ass.

398
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:01,962
So you're just gonna lets me
fuck this up?

399
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:27,921
- Not gonna do this all for you.

400
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,132
- Fucking brute.

401
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:53,981
Here, you pull out the rotten
ones,

402
00:31:54,014 --> 00:31:55,282
I'll get the new ones.

403
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:56,183
- No, thanks.

404
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:58,919
- Right.

405
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:00,688
Just trying to protect those
dainty hands.

406
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:01,689
- Fuck off.

407
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:03,424
- It's a joke.

408
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:04,526
Relax.

409
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,033
Egan.

410
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:19,006
- Kieran.

411
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:47,167
- Do you remember that little
play you put on for me,

412
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:48,570
for my 35th birthday?

413
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:52,607
What, you must have been seven
or eight?

414
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:58,078
- Me mam put me up to that.

415
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:02,382
- I think I distinctly remember
you having a good time.

416
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:04,619
- You're mistaken.

417
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:08,623
- Come on.

418
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:11,024
Come with me.

419
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:17,599
Do you believe in God, Kay?

420
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:19,701
- Yes.

421
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:22,604
- Do you believe his creations

422
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:25,439
made in his divine image
are holy and perfect?

423
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,513
- Mrs. O'Leary's daughter was
born blind.

424
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:33,815
- So, the world is unfair.

425
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:36,316
You're going to use that
to deflect responsibility

426
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,685
for your own actions.

427
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:44,391
We all have our demons Kay.

428
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:47,361
After my brother died, I

429
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:50,230
felt lost just as you do.

430
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:53,768
- He has nothing to do with
this.

431
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:55,737
- With what?

432
00:33:57,605 --> 00:33:59,072
- With anything.

433
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:01,843
- It's perfectly normal for you
to feel,

434
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:04,344
you have to fill the void of his
presence.

435
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:09,817
- You have no idea what
you're talking about.

436
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:11,619
Do you?

437
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:15,557
You know, just because you

438
00:34:16,524 --> 00:34:20,628
were born exactly in accordance
to Catholic standard,

439
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,831
doesn't make you better than
anyone.

440
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,769
It just makes you privileged.

441
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:33,508
- I know you're hurt
more than you think I do.

442
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:34,709
Just because I was strong enough

443
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:36,778
to face my demons, head on.

444
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,782
A coward, like you,

445
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:42,850
will never have the strength to
be a man.

446
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,660
- Batted away by
O'Dudden.

447
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:54,294
Sent to the left corner back.

448
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:56,764
Now back down the pitch,
Aberdine with it.

449
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:59,399
Goalie on the attack,
Limerick with the pull

450
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:01,201
and Doughtrey is down.

451
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:03,504
Limerick is arguing with the
referees and it looks like-

452
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:22,289
- There.

453
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:27,194
- Looks good.

454
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,731
- On the outside yeah,

455
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:33,166
but still got fixing inside.

456
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,802
- You like fixing stuff?

457
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:35,870
- Need to, more than like to.

458
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:41,408
Trying to make this a studio
space for my paintings.

459
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:42,910
- Paintings?

460
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:44,211
- Yeah.

461
00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:45,245
What's it to you?

462
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:46,581
Never met a painting puff
before?

463
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:50,551
- Uh, no, it's not that, uh

464
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:52,553
it's

465
00:35:52,587 --> 00:35:53,655
just.

466
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:55,556
- You're weird.

467
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,891
- You are.

468
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,793
- Don't get your panties in a
twist.

469
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:02,797
Wanna see some of them?

470
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:04,832
- Yeah.

471
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:06,601
- Come on.

472
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:17,444
- It's not much, but it is what
it is.

473
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:21,649
Let's see

474
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:27,755
Oh huh.

475
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:30,190
I finished this one right before
we left.

476
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:33,828
Sort of a political statement.

477
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,496
- Yeah.

478
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:44,672
- I like this one a lot.

479
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:48,442
- What is it?

480
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:50,812
- Um, it's abstract.

481
00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:52,714
Here.

482
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:58,720
It could be whatever you need
really.

483
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:01,488
Um.

484
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:09,630
- What's that one?

485
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:10,531
- Oh yeah.

486
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,803
Well, it was a beautiful
landscape painting but,

487
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:19,306
I was pissed off and the
beauty pissed me off,

488
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:21,274
so I punched a hole in it.

489
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:28,750
Makes a good statement piece
though.

490
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:30,350
Don't you think?

491
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,855
- I don't think you should go.

492
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:36,256
- Why not?

493
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:38,559
- I'd miss you.

494
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:41,629
- Fuckin' hell.

495
00:37:42,597 --> 00:37:43,564
How was that?

496
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:46,299
- What do
you think your intentions

497
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,300
are at this point?

498
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,071
- Billy is torn.

499
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,639
- Don't talk
about your character

500
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:53,074
in the third person.

501
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:55,442
It'll just distance
you from understanding.

502
00:37:56,544 --> 00:37:57,945
Why are you torn?

503
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:00,948
- I don't know.

504
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:02,717
- Put yourself in his shoes.

505
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:04,719
- How could I?

506
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:10,057
- Can you not understand, or
sympathize with the feelings?

507
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:13,360
- I don't know.

508
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:14,095
- You don't know?

509
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:15,696
- Yeah.

510
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,633
- Alright, everybody take five,

511
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:19,867
Patrick, thank you.

512
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:22,703
Come here.

513
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,013
Alright.

514
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:35,482
What's going on?

515
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:38,719
- I told you it'd be difficult.

516
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:41,022
- Well, what's the hangup?

517
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:43,124
- I,

518
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:44,859
don't, know.

519
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:48,361
- Alright.

520
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:50,965
Well then let's call it a day.

521
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:51,833
- Alright.

522
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:53,433
- Yeah?

523
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:56,537
Come ready for rehearsal on
Monday.

524
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,140
Yeah?
- Yeah.

525
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,473
- Yeah.

526
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:05,539
- This was my brothers.

527
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:08,643
I thought you'd like it.

528
00:40:11,112 --> 00:40:12,647
- Won't he miss it?

529
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,781
- Don't think so.

530
00:40:14,682 --> 00:40:15,950
- That's quite cute of you.

531
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:19,954
Suppose you wanna help with the
rest?

532
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:22,489
- Just thought you'd like it.

533
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:25,626
- I'd like the help.

534
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:31,032
- Alright.

535
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:42,677
Are we painting all the walls?

536
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:49,083
- Erm, no, we'll make
sort of an accent wall.

537
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:49,984
- A what wall?

538
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:54,922
- An accent wall.

539
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:56,791
Three are the same, one's
different.

540
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:00,661
I like that sort of stuff.

541
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:07,568
- Why would anyone in
the right mind move here?

542
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:11,072
- What made you think my
dad's in his right mind?

543
00:41:20,114 --> 00:41:23,217
Your brother sounds cool.

544
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:28,923
You should bring him around
sometime?

545
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,960
- What?

546
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:34,095
I'm not good enough?

547
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,932
- That's exactly what I'm
saying.

548
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:48,743
C'mon.

549
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:58,819
- What are we doing here?

550
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:03,958
- You never come here?

551
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:06,594
- I mean, I came with my
parents,

552
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:07,661
when I was younger.

553
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:18,305
- It's beautiful.

554
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:20,674
- Bet it was more beautiful

555
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:23,077
a few hundred years
ago when it was intact.

556
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:26,814
- Nah, I like it like this.

557
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:49,637
- Gwinn, I knocked at the
door, but no one answered.

558
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,972
So I figured I'd come around.

559
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:53,974
I was just stopping by to return
this.

560
00:42:57,011 --> 00:42:57,978
- Why don't you come inside?

561
00:42:58,012 --> 00:42:58,979
Have a cup of tea.

562
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:03,117
- I didn't realize you worked
the land.

563
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,752
- Oh, just a bit of gardening.

564
00:43:06,187 --> 00:43:07,988
- Sean said, Kay wasn't at the
debs.

565
00:43:09,723 --> 00:43:14,195
- Oh, she was so busy with
the college preparations.

566
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:16,063
- Of course.

567
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:23,270
It's quite the task, watching
them grow up

568
00:43:23,304 --> 00:43:24,805
and become their own person.

569
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:28,909
- How do you mean?

570
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:32,213
- You know.

571
00:43:33,948 --> 00:43:35,749
You have all these ideas in your
head

572
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:38,185
since they were babies,
of who they're going to be

573
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:43,724
and then when they grow up.

574
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:55,936
- I was about to go wash up.

575
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,238
- No it's all right.

576
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:59,006
Did you finish the shed?

577
00:43:59,039 --> 00:43:59,974
- Not yet.

578
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:04,245
I have to go back tomorrow and
finish off.

579
00:44:04,278 --> 00:44:05,146
- Come sit.

580
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:14,421
I know things have been
difficult around here lately.

581
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:24,098
I've got something for you.

582
00:44:40,515 --> 00:44:42,016
You'll be wearing this to the
dinner

583
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:43,050
with our new neighbours.

584
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:45,886
You'll look so good.

585
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,222
- Do you really have to
have them for dinner?

586
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,457
- I'm not going to carry on
being the talk of the town Kay.

587
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:51,926
Now, you'll be wearing this

588
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:54,495
and you will be nice to that
boy.

589
00:44:54,529 --> 00:44:55,763
- He's a prick.

590
00:44:56,764 --> 00:44:59,400
- Your dad was a prick
until our third date.

591
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:01,302
That's how boys express their
feelings.

592
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:02,903
- Oh yeah.

593
00:45:02,937 --> 00:45:05,873
Because you and dad are the
prime example

594
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:07,708
of a successful relationship.

595
00:45:31,465 --> 00:45:32,800
- You know it.

596
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:35,469
- 'Course I do.

597
00:45:35,503 --> 00:45:36,370
- 'Course I do

598
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:40,441
Of course I do.

599
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:48,882
- Bullocks.

600
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:55,122
Do you like what you see?

601
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:56,857
- What?

602
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:57,858
No.

603
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,028
What's that from?

604
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:07,134
- Me dad gets super
homophobic when he's drunk.

605
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:09,069
- Oh.

606
00:46:10,204 --> 00:46:11,772
- It's fine, I provoke it.

607
00:46:15,276 --> 00:46:16,143
Anyway.

608
00:46:17,545 --> 00:46:20,080
Michael Caffrey, love him.

609
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:22,016
- Yeah.

610
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:28,389
- How'd your parents take it?

611
00:46:29,323 --> 00:46:30,391
- Take what?

612
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:31,458
- Yous being a puff.

613
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:35,062
- I'm not a puff.

614
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:38,098
- Sure.

615
00:46:40,535 --> 00:46:42,604
- Do you want me to beat your
arse again?

616
00:46:42,637 --> 00:46:44,471
- You'd like that wouldn't you?

617
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:05,192
Puff.

618
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:09,897
- You're looking good up there
Kieran.

619
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:10,898
- You think?

620
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:13,501
- Maybe you should give
up acting for ballet.

621
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,304
- What's up Finn?

622
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:18,205
- What?

623
00:47:19,273 --> 00:47:20,575
- What do you mean, what?

624
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:23,310
- I just don't really
think you need anyone else

625
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:24,945
blowing up your head, that's
all.

626
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:26,581
- He's just jealous, he's
ensemble.

627
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:30,417
- How come Ms. Doyle never
actually corrects you?

628
00:47:30,451 --> 00:47:31,885
- What are you getting at?

629
00:47:34,556 --> 00:47:37,057
- Here, don't mind him, I'll
talk to him.

630
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:37,958
- Yeah.

631
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:41,462
- Where are they going?

632
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:45,132
Did they find out your big
secret?

633
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:48,469
- You're a fucking twat, you
know that?

634
00:47:51,171 --> 00:47:52,039
- Come on.

635
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,543
You're really gonna be that
sensitive?

636
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:57,978
- I'm just, I'm not in the mood.

637
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:01,215
Okay?

638
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:02,116
- K...

639
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:13,661
- Why are you reading that?

640
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:17,364
- I am,

641
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:20,267
trying to find a good monologue.

642
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,202
- You act?

643
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:24,271
- No, I mean,

644
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:27,642
it's what I want to do.

645
00:48:27,675 --> 00:48:31,345
- Sometimes I think I know
nothing about you Kieran.

646
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:32,446
Don't be so coy.

647
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,549
Have some pride in who you are.

648
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:35,949
- It's whatever.

649
00:48:37,685 --> 00:48:39,253
- Let me see what you got.

650
00:48:39,286 --> 00:48:41,121
- I haven't really got anything
yet.

651
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:45,092
- How about this?

652
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:48,596
- I really, haven't prepared,

653
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,597
anything.

654
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:52,199
- You've been watching
me paint all morning.

655
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:55,135
Let me see what you got.

656
00:48:56,303 --> 00:48:57,572
Come on, get up.

657
00:48:57,605 --> 00:48:58,439
Up, up, up.
- Alright,

658
00:48:58,472 --> 00:49:00,174
alright.

659
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:01,074
Don't um,

660
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,211
don't expect much.

661
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:05,345
- On with it.

662
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:11,185
- Okay.

663
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:19,259
He told us we ought to
think of Jesus as our buddy.

664
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:22,764
He said he talked to Jesus all
the time.

665
00:49:22,797 --> 00:49:26,634
Even when he was driving
his car, that cracked me up.

666
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:31,338
I could see that big, phony
bastard

667
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:34,308
shifting into first gear asking
Jesus

668
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:36,310
to send him a few more stiffs.

669
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:37,545
What?
- Nothing.

670
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:40,080
- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing.

671
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:41,281
Why'd you pick that one?

672
00:49:43,383 --> 00:49:44,552
- I don't know.

673
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:48,021
He's tough.

674
00:49:48,055 --> 00:49:49,389
I like the way he's tough.

675
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:55,028
- Well, I feel like it's more of
a satire,

676
00:49:56,463 --> 00:49:58,298
besides there are way better
parts.

677
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,269
What about this?

678
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:07,174
I was sitting there on that wash
bowl

679
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:10,545
and I got bored, so I hopped
down

680
00:50:10,578 --> 00:50:12,145
and stepped back a few feet

681
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:15,449
and start doing this tap dance,
just for-

682
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:17,050
- I didn't criticize your
painting.

683
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:17,719
Did I?

684
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:18,820
And guess what?

685
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:22,089
Not everything has to be
as as feckin' queer as you.

686
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,426
- I'm sorry.

687
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,327
- No.

688
00:50:28,262 --> 00:50:29,697
No.

689
00:50:29,731 --> 00:50:32,099
I'm sorry.

690
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:32,800
Okay?

691
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:35,235
I'm stressed.

692
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,171
- It's alright.

693
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,178
- Let's go into Dublin tonight.

694
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:47,649
- What about dinner?

695
00:50:47,682 --> 00:50:48,583
- Screw dinner.

696
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,252
My parents are...

697
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:57,592
My parents are rotten and
they'll ruin everything.

698
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,226
Please Egan, please,

699
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:01,228
please, let's just go to Dublin

700
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:03,363
and have a good time instead.

701
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:20,875
- Come on.

702
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:23,544
Let's go, before my dad
realizes,

703
00:52:23,578 --> 00:52:26,179
me mom's earrings he keeps are
gone.

704
00:52:26,213 --> 00:52:27,347
- What are you wearing?

705
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:29,416
- What are you wearing?

706
00:53:26,841 --> 00:53:27,709
- Kieran.

707
00:53:29,544 --> 00:53:30,912
- What, Finn?

708
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:32,747
- Oh, what do you not talk
to your friends anymore?

709
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,715
Is that it?

710
00:53:33,748 --> 00:53:35,348
- Piss off, you're drunk.

711
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:36,751
- Are you for...

712
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:38,452
Hold on, man, what,
what is this?

713
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,289
Oh, I actually just knew you
were full of shit, you know?

714
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:43,423
Yeah, I even said it to Braiden.

715
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:44,125
- Yeah.

716
00:53:44,158 --> 00:53:44,992
- No actually forget Braiden.

717
00:53:45,026 --> 00:53:46,060
Wait till...

718
00:53:46,094 --> 00:53:47,795
You know, wait till
Charlotte hears about this.

719
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:48,663
I don't think-

720
00:53:48,696 --> 00:53:49,931
- Kieran.

721
00:53:56,037 --> 00:53:58,973
♪ Let's go back to having fun ♪

722
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:00,273
- Who was that?

723
00:54:01,843 --> 00:54:02,877
- Can we not?

724
00:54:09,717 --> 00:54:11,018
Alright, alright.

725
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:11,919
He

726
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:16,423
is just a lad that I know.

727
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,727
- From where?

728
00:54:23,396 --> 00:54:24,331
- Acting group.

729
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,466
- Get out.

730
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:31,271
- If we're being completely
honest,

731
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,408
I have something else to get off
my chest.

732
00:54:36,476 --> 00:54:37,344
- What is it?

733
00:54:39,514 --> 00:54:42,683
- I'm playing Billy Elliot in my
theatres.

734
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:44,719
production of Billy Elliot.

735
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:45,953
- No, you're not.

736
00:54:45,987 --> 00:54:47,054
- I swear.

737
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:50,591
- You're so hot Kieran.

738
00:54:52,492 --> 00:54:53,426
I want you.

739
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:55,563
- We're in an alley.

740
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:57,397
- Oh, come off it.

741
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,398
That's even hotter.

742
00:55:00,768 --> 00:55:03,938
- Let's um, get a hotel,

743
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,607
this weekend.

744
00:55:08,843 --> 00:55:09,710
- You're such a tease.

745
00:55:13,748 --> 00:55:14,582
- Four.

746
00:55:14,615 --> 00:55:15,550
One, two,

747
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:16,517
three, four,

748
00:55:16,551 --> 00:55:17,384
five, six.

749
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:18,553
Now take his hand.

750
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:19,587
Seven, Eight, nine, 10.

751
00:55:20,822 --> 00:55:21,756
One, two,

752
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:22,890
three,

753
00:55:22,924 --> 00:55:24,491
no, no Kieran.

754
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:26,894
One more beat until two of you

755
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:30,031
fall to the ground together,
with the crescendo.

756
00:55:30,064 --> 00:55:31,098
Yeah?

757
00:55:31,132 --> 00:55:32,800
- I know.

758
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:35,468
I need to catch my breath.

759
00:55:35,503 --> 00:55:37,772
- Alright everybody, take five.

760
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:43,544
- I heard he's
been cheating on her since

761
00:55:43,578 --> 00:55:44,745
they started dating.

762
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:47,648
- I wonder
how Charlotte feels?

763
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:48,616
- Piss off!

764
00:55:51,819 --> 00:55:52,720
- Kay.

765
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,656
- Don't call me that.

766
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,524
- Why not?

767
00:55:56,557 --> 00:55:58,726
Don't everyone know the you're a
liar?

768
00:55:58,759 --> 00:55:59,627
- I'm not a liar.

769
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,528
- And a cheat.

770
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:02,830
- Why do you care?

771
00:56:05,566 --> 00:56:06,834
- It's too much drama.

772
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:08,401
It's too much drama.

773
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:10,771
Anyways, the lies were
plaguing my conscience,

774
00:56:10,805 --> 00:56:12,907
so, I've come clean.

775
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:16,744
- Everyone will know that you're
a lezzy.

776
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:17,645
- He

777
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:19,547
I mean, she,

778
00:56:20,715 --> 00:56:22,149
lied to me this whole time.

779
00:56:23,618 --> 00:56:24,785
I can't believe it.

780
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,387
How could somebody do that?

781
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:27,882
- What are you doing here?

782
00:57:27,915 --> 00:57:28,783
- Kieran.

783
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:31,652
I was waiting for you at the
shed

784
00:57:31,686 --> 00:57:33,654
and ye never showed up. Come on.

785
00:57:33,688 --> 00:57:34,855
Let's go.

786
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:36,090
- I can't go out anymore.

787
00:57:37,725 --> 00:57:40,161
- You know you want this.

788
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:42,830
- Egan shut up.

789
00:57:42,863 --> 00:57:43,898
- Please, please.

790
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:45,533
Please, please,

791
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:46,968
please, please please.

792
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:47,902
- Shut up.

793
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:49,136
- Please, please, please.

794
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,671
Kieran please.

795
00:57:50,705 --> 00:57:51,706
- Ugh

796
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:52,606
- Please.

797
00:58:10,825 --> 00:58:12,626
- Egan stop.

798
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:16,697
Stop.

799
00:58:18,899 --> 00:58:19,967
Shut up Egan.

800
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,537
Go.

801
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:33,214
Stop.

802
00:58:34,982 --> 00:58:36,817
You can't come around here.

803
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:37,952
- Come on.

804
00:58:37,985 --> 00:58:38,819
Come on.

805
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:40,254
- Leave.

806
00:58:40,287 --> 00:58:41,689
- What's wrong baby?

807
00:58:41,722 --> 00:58:44,091
- I said, leave.

808
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:45,226
- I'm not just gonna leave.

809
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,599
We don't gotta do nothin'.

810
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,970
Jus' want to be with you.

811
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:00,875
- Well I don't want to be with
you.

812
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:06,781
- What?

813
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:10,818
- I don't give a shite about
you.

814
00:59:14,622 --> 00:59:15,756
Leave Egan.

815
00:59:17,825 --> 00:59:18,692
Don't.

816
00:59:21,262 --> 00:59:22,696
- What's wrong?

817
00:59:25,132 --> 00:59:26,000
- Go.

818
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:29,637
- No.

819
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:32,773
- Go!

820
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:25,359
I'm ready.

821
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:30,931
- Oh Kay.

822
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:07,401
Isn't this great?

823
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:09,737
I'm serious.

824
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:14,108
Declan, take a picture of us
girls.

825
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,719
I'd love to show Elizabeth and
the ladies.

826
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:29,256
- Alright.

827
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:31,392
One, two,

828
01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:32,293

829
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:36,330

830
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:39,501
- Whoa!

831
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:42,069
That's what I'm talking about!

832
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:44,405
- That'll would be so
nice.

833
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,007
Take your shirt off.

834
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:50,811
♪ And it's no nay never ♪

835
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:52,780

836
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:54,281

838
01:01:58,085 --> 01:02:01,088

840
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:03,857
- Take your shirt off.

841
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:07,027
What have you done?

842
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:12,499
What are we going to do?

843
01:02:13,568 --> 01:02:14,435
Declan.

844
01:02:19,473 --> 01:02:20,341
Declan!

845
01:02:44,398 --> 01:02:45,466
- I can't do it.

846
01:02:48,836 --> 01:02:50,471
- She just misses you.

847
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:52,406
- I haven't gone anywhere.

848
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:54,008
I'm still me.

849
01:02:55,276 --> 01:02:57,911
- We can't be so selfish
with our own grief.

850
01:02:59,213 --> 01:03:00,548
She was his mother.

851
01:03:01,616 --> 01:03:02,883
- Should have been me.

852
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,855
It should have been me.

853
01:03:15,062 --> 01:03:16,430
- We have to stick together,

854
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:18,432
as a family,

855
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:22,136
for her sake.

856
01:03:24,004 --> 01:03:27,542
- What she wants doesn't exist.

857
01:03:33,581 --> 01:03:34,982
She wishes it was me too.

858
01:03:35,015 --> 01:03:35,883
- No.

859
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:39,053
No, that's not true.

860
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:41,922
- I'll never be what she wants.

861
01:03:41,955 --> 01:03:43,525
No matter how hard that I try.

862
01:03:49,129 --> 01:03:50,431
- She loves you.

863
01:03:50,464 --> 01:03:52,032
- She loves her idea of me.

864
01:03:55,402 --> 01:03:56,303
- Kay.

865
01:03:56,337 --> 01:03:58,138
- You know it.

866
01:03:58,172 --> 01:03:59,239
- What about me?

867
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:05,346
Please.

868
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:10,417
I can't lose you.

869
01:05:42,176 --> 01:05:44,011
- Oi painting boy.

870
01:05:48,081 --> 01:05:50,250
Painting's looking really nice.

871
01:05:51,285 --> 01:05:53,187
- So you're allowed to
meddle in my things,

872
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,254
but not me in yours.

873
01:05:55,355 --> 01:05:58,626
- Egan, I'm sorry.

874
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:03,497
- I don't know you Kieran.

875
01:06:03,531 --> 01:06:04,398
- What?

876
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:07,234
Come on, course you do.

877
01:06:14,509 --> 01:06:15,375
I said,

878
01:06:16,744 --> 01:06:17,612
I'm sorry.

879
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:47,174
Shall I compare the
thee to a summer's day?

880
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:50,410
Thou art more lovely

881
01:06:51,278 --> 01:06:53,247
and more temperate.

882
01:06:54,248 --> 01:06:57,050
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May.

883
01:06:57,084 --> 01:07:00,788
And summer's lease hath
all too short a date.

884
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:05,560
Every fair from fair sometime
decline,

885
01:07:05,593 --> 01:07:10,532
either by chance or by
nature's changing course.

886
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:17,137
But thy eternal summer,

887
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,741
shall not fade.

888
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,716
- You know, you're officially
a bigger puff than me.

889
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:46,333
It can't be like this Kieran.

890
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:47,234
- I know.

891
01:07:48,435 --> 01:07:49,771
- I want to help you.

892
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:55,409
- But I've been where you
are and I can't go back.

893
01:07:56,844 --> 01:07:59,379
- I don't want to do that, okay?

894
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:00,715
I won't.

895
01:08:00,748 --> 01:08:02,482
- Promise.
- Promise.

896
01:08:29,309 --> 01:08:30,511
- Oh, sorry.

897
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:32,412
Cross.

898
01:08:38,586 --> 01:08:42,189
You know, I bet your
mom's acting this way,

899
01:08:42,222 --> 01:08:44,892
because she'd be sad if you
left.

900
01:08:46,226 --> 01:08:47,629
- When I leave.

901
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:51,198
Acting school or not,

902
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:52,366
I can't stay here.

903
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,702
- Right?

904
01:08:54,736 --> 01:08:57,170
When you leave, I'm sure she'll
miss you.

905
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:00,273
- I honestly don't care.

906
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:05,212
You know, if I'm lucky,

907
01:09:06,547 --> 01:09:08,650
I'll forget about this
whole bleedin' island.

908
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:17,357
Easy there killer.

909
01:09:18,392 --> 01:09:19,761
- What do you care?

910
01:09:21,763 --> 01:09:22,897
- Come on.

911
01:09:38,412 --> 01:09:40,782
- Tell me something I
don't know about you.

912
01:09:42,517 --> 01:09:44,217
- Ummm.

913
01:09:46,688 --> 01:09:47,889
I don't know.

914
01:09:49,957 --> 01:09:51,859
- There has to be something.

915
01:09:54,762 --> 01:09:59,399
- You know more about me than
anyone.

916
01:10:00,902 --> 01:10:02,670
- So I know everything?

917
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:06,507
- I don't know everything about
you.

918
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:09,309
Isn't a little mystery the
point?

919
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:10,343
- The point of what?

920
01:10:11,344 --> 01:10:12,279
- I don't know.

921
01:10:12,312 --> 01:10:13,480
Dating.

922
01:10:13,514 --> 01:10:15,516
- Oh, so we're dating now.

923
01:10:17,484 --> 01:10:19,554
- I just meant that we're clear-

924
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:27,762
- What if I went with you?

925
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,665
- To London?

926
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:32,800
- Yeah I mean,

927
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:36,003
there's nothing for me here and

928
01:10:37,004 --> 01:10:39,306
I got people for help us out
there.

929
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:42,510
- Oh, oh, okay.

930
01:10:42,543 --> 01:10:43,811
You, got people.

931
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:45,947
Yeah.

932
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:47,882
- You're serious?

933
01:10:49,617 --> 01:10:50,785
- You're not?

934
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,289
What's so bloody important
about here anyway?

935
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:00,628
- You.

936
01:11:13,373 --> 01:11:16,511
- Alright
folks, that's it for today.

937
01:11:16,544 --> 01:11:18,378
And now show was up in one week,
alright?

938
01:11:18,411 --> 01:11:19,981
So if you're not off book by
now,

939
01:11:21,414 --> 01:11:22,282
God help me.

940
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:29,891
And next months rent. God. Oh!
Ummm... uh,

941
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:32,325
And don't forget your
tickets on the way out,

942
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:33,995
before you leave.

943
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:35,563
Collect them at the front,
alright?

944
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:36,564
Yeah.

945
01:11:36,597 --> 01:11:38,032
Bye.

946
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:48,276
Mr. Dearg,

947
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:51,813
we missed you at rehearsals
today.

948
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:54,048
- I had a family emergency.

949
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:57,618
I should have called, but,

950
01:11:58,953 --> 01:11:59,854
yeah.

951
01:11:59,887 --> 01:12:01,055
- Yesterday too?

952
01:12:06,861 --> 01:12:08,763
Your stand in sucks anyway.

953
01:12:10,932 --> 01:12:12,099
- It won't happen again.

954
01:12:15,036 --> 01:12:17,872
- Do you know who my
greatest inspiration is?

955
01:12:17,905 --> 01:12:18,773
- Who?

956
01:12:19,774 --> 01:12:20,641
- Him.

957
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:24,344
He always rises.

958
01:12:25,146 --> 01:12:27,048
Even though every day he falls.

959
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:30,551
- Yeah, until he explodes

960
01:12:31,953 --> 01:12:34,088
and brings us all to a fiery
death.

961
01:12:34,121 --> 01:12:36,624
- Well, if that's all you're
anticipating,

962
01:12:36,657 --> 01:12:38,458
then he's already killed you.

963
01:12:42,964 --> 01:12:45,132
We can only try our best, right?

964
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,134
- Right.
- Right.

965
01:12:48,202 --> 01:12:51,038
Then I will see you tomorrow
for dress rehearsal.

966
01:12:51,072 --> 01:12:52,073
Right?
- Right.

967
01:12:53,741 --> 01:12:57,745
- Oh and Kieran don't forget
your tickets to opening night.

968
01:12:59,981 --> 01:13:02,016
- Do you think I could get one
more?

969
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:03,416
- Yeah, no problem.

970
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,387
- Thanks Ms. Doyle.

971
01:13:08,089 --> 01:13:10,423
- Never anticipate the fall
Kieran,

972
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:14,028
'cause it'll only make the
rising that much shorter.

973
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:26,574
- Oh, you're definitely
stabbing me harder now.

974
01:13:26,607 --> 01:13:27,842
- No, I'm not.

975
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,777
- Yes you are.

976
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,145
Are you enjoying this?

977
01:13:32,513 --> 01:13:33,180
- Maybe.

978
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:35,816
You bleeding sadist.

979
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:39,921
- Hold still, ya big baby.

980
01:13:41,022 --> 01:13:42,422
I'm almost done.

981
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:45,693
There.

982
01:13:46,928 --> 01:13:47,895
Now we're matching.

983
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:54,168
- I have something for you.

984
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:55,536
- Oh yeah?

985
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:56,904
- It's not much.

986
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:58,005
Just a peace offering.

987
01:14:00,808 --> 01:14:02,109
It's a shite production really,

988
01:14:02,143 --> 01:14:04,111
so you don't have to come.

989
01:14:04,145 --> 01:14:06,847
- Kieran, I'm coming.

990
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:09,083
I honestly thought I was already
invited,

991
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:10,818
so it's a bit of an insult.

992
01:14:10,851 --> 01:14:12,787
- Well, don't go ruining a nice
moment.

993
01:14:29,804 --> 01:14:32,540
I've been meaning to tell you
something.

994
01:14:32,573 --> 01:14:33,240
- Yeah.

995
01:14:42,783 --> 01:14:44,518
- I'm not a really good singer.

996
01:14:44,552 --> 01:14:46,187
So don't expect much.

997
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,221
- Come off it.

998
01:16:00,828 --> 01:16:02,763
- Do you ever think about how
crazy it is

999
01:16:02,797 --> 01:16:05,299
that no matter where we are on
this earth,

1000
01:16:05,332 --> 01:16:06,767
we're all on the same sky.

1001
01:16:08,903 --> 01:16:12,273
- But in Australia it's night
time.

1002
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:14,208
- Don't be a dick.

1003
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:18,312
I mean, we all look at the same
moon

1004
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:20,081
and our days are lit by the same
sun.

1005
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:25,186
- I never really thought about
it.

1006
01:16:30,224 --> 01:16:31,892
- When me mom left,

1007
01:16:33,127 --> 01:16:35,663
I used to look up at the sky

1008
01:16:35,696 --> 01:16:38,165
and wonder if she was looking
too.

1009
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,209
Oi, wait up.

1010
01:16:55,883 --> 01:16:56,750
Kieran.

1011
01:16:57,785 --> 01:16:58,652
Kieran.

1012
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,668
- Egan please.

1013
01:17:14,702 --> 01:17:15,336
- What the-

1014
01:17:15,369 --> 01:17:16,237
- Egan.

1015
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:17,738
- What the fuck Kieran.

1016
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:20,007
I knew-

1017
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,144
I fucking knew, don't fucking
touch me.

1018
01:17:23,177 --> 01:17:24,011
- Please.

1019
01:17:24,044 --> 01:17:25,212
I'm sorry.

1020
01:17:25,246 --> 01:17:26,981
See this is why I didn't fucking
tell you.

1021
01:17:27,014 --> 01:17:28,883
I knew you'd fucking react this
way.

1022
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:31,952
- No, you do not get to put this
on me.

1023
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,088
I fucking trusted you.

1024
01:17:34,121 --> 01:17:35,723
You didn't let me in.

1025
01:17:35,756 --> 01:17:37,958
- Don't you think, I
wish I wasn't like this?

1026
01:17:37,992 --> 01:17:40,194
- It's got nothing to do
with the way you are Kieran.

1027
01:17:40,227 --> 01:17:41,328
- What?

1028
01:17:41,362 --> 01:17:42,229
What?

1029
01:17:43,097 --> 01:17:46,133
- You're a selfish piece of shit
Kieran.

1030
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:48,302
- Oh, that's easy for you to
say.

1031
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:50,471
That's easy for fucking you to
say.

1032
01:17:50,505 --> 01:17:52,239
If I was born, like you,

1033
01:17:52,273 --> 01:17:53,841
I wouldn't have to deal with any
of this.

1034
01:17:53,874 --> 01:17:56,977
- Everyone's shit is fucked
Kieran.

1035
01:17:57,011 --> 01:18:00,247
But when you put that
shit on someone else,

1036
01:18:00,281 --> 01:18:01,448
it's all you.

1037
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:05,486
We were gonna go to London
together.

1038
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,720
- We still can.

1039
01:18:06,754 --> 01:18:08,155
- What are you going to do?

1040
01:18:08,189 --> 01:18:10,224
Never take your shirt off?

1041
01:18:10,257 --> 01:18:11,892
Did you even..?

1042
01:18:11,926 --> 01:18:13,060
- Please Egan.

1043
01:18:16,397 --> 01:18:17,231
Please.

1044
01:18:17,264 --> 01:18:18,265
- I loved you.

1045
01:18:18,299 --> 01:18:19,433
I love you, Egan.

1046
01:18:19,466 --> 01:18:20,334
I love you.

1047
01:18:21,402 --> 01:18:23,037
Egan I love you.

1048
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:23,938
Egan, please.

1049
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:28,209
Fuck.

1050
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:46,927
Hey.

1051
01:18:47,828 --> 01:18:50,464
I'm sorry that I hit you.

1052
01:18:50,497 --> 01:18:52,066
It was fucked up.

1053
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,770
I understand, if you can't
forgive me,

1054
01:18:58,172 --> 01:19:00,407
I don't really deserve it
anyway,

1055
01:19:00,441 --> 01:19:01,809
but for what it's worth,

1056
01:19:03,244 --> 01:19:04,211
I think that you would've made

1057
01:19:04,245 --> 01:19:05,346
a better Billy than me.

1058
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:13,254
- Break a leg.

1059
01:19:13,287 --> 01:19:14,154
- Yeah.

1060
01:19:46,053 --> 01:19:47,488
You were wrong about me.

1061
01:19:47,522 --> 01:19:49,323
I don't deserve this part.

1062
01:19:49,356 --> 01:19:50,958
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1063
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:53,427
It's not a matter of deserving.

1064
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,964
You got this part because of who
you are.

1065
01:19:56,997 --> 01:19:59,199
- If you knew half the
shite that I've done.

1066
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:03,571
- Who you are, has nothing
to do with what you've done.

1067
01:20:05,607 --> 01:20:07,575
Look, there's always gonna be
bad things.

1068
01:20:07,609 --> 01:20:09,076
They're always gonna happen

1069
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:10,210
and life of course, yes,

1070
01:20:10,244 --> 01:20:11,945
it's gonna have its
difficulties.

1071
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:14,248
But listen to me.

1072
01:20:15,883 --> 01:20:17,418
The measure of a true man,

1073
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:20,821
is in how he chooses to react

1074
01:20:23,223 --> 01:20:25,059
and how he learns from his
mistakes.

1075
01:20:26,126 --> 01:20:29,096
And then if he grows, despite
them.

1076
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:32,900
- But that time all I've run
everyone off.

1077
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:34,602
- Seeking validation from
others,

1078
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:37,905
without coming from yourself
first

1079
01:20:37,938 --> 01:20:38,972
is dangerous Kieran.

1080
01:20:42,109 --> 01:20:43,077
Now look darling.

1081
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,579
I'm not gonna sugar coat it

1082
01:20:44,612 --> 01:20:47,314
and tell you that it gets any
easier,

1083
01:20:47,348 --> 01:20:49,584
because it doesn't.

1084
01:20:49,617 --> 01:20:52,554
But, we get better and handling
it.

1085
01:20:53,621 --> 01:20:55,956
- I don't think I can do it.

1086
01:21:11,539 --> 01:21:15,042
- We can't control what
anyone else does, okay?

1087
01:21:15,075 --> 01:21:18,011
We only have control over our
actions.

1088
01:21:19,146 --> 01:21:21,415
So, we certainly can let
the actions of others

1089
01:21:21,448 --> 01:21:23,150
control what we do.

1090
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:25,018
Look.

1091
01:21:27,287 --> 01:21:30,592
Darling, the world has
dealt you your cards

1092
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:37,632
and now it's only up to you and
how you are gonna play them.

1093
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:02,956
- Are you a balletomane, Mr.
Elliot?

1094
01:22:04,526 --> 01:22:05,527
- I beg your pardon?

1095
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,262
- Are you a fan of the ballet?

1096
01:22:09,531 --> 01:22:12,734
- Well, I wouldn't exactly say
I was an expert, or anything.

1097
01:22:12,767 --> 01:22:14,301
- Well, you do realize that our
students

1098
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:17,237
are expected to attain the
highest standard of work?

1099
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:18,172
Not only in ballet,

1100
01:22:18,205 --> 01:22:20,441
but also in their ordinary
academic work.

1101
01:22:21,543 --> 01:22:23,110
In order for a child to succeed,

1102
01:22:23,143 --> 01:22:26,346
they must have the 100%
support of their family.

1103
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:29,283
Now you are 100% behind Billy
are you not?

1104
01:22:32,186 --> 01:22:33,053
- Well,

1105
01:22:36,023 --> 01:22:37,191
yes, of course.

1106
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,287
- Hey.

1107
01:23:10,725 --> 01:23:13,728
You know, when you see a kid
who's

1108
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:17,264
so unabashedly themselves?

1109
01:23:18,298 --> 01:23:21,235
Pressure to fit in, hasn't

1110
01:23:23,671 --> 01:23:26,173
hasn't caught up with them yet.

1111
01:23:31,111 --> 01:23:35,415
I haven't been myself in a long
time.

1112
01:23:37,585 --> 01:23:40,087
I wake up every morning,

1113
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,723
wishing I was someone else

1114
01:23:41,756 --> 01:23:44,526
and then I dress up

1115
01:23:44,559 --> 01:23:49,564
and pretend to be someone else
that,

1116
01:23:52,332 --> 01:23:53,200
I'm not.

1117
01:23:55,803 --> 01:23:57,437
I'm still chasing that kid

1118
01:23:59,473 --> 01:24:00,340
and,

1119
01:24:02,442 --> 01:24:04,612
he's in there, somewhere.

1120
01:24:06,714 --> 01:24:09,717
Between Kay

1121
01:24:09,751 --> 01:24:11,285
and Kieran.

1122
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:16,256
- I still love you.

1123
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:19,226
- I love you.

1124
01:24:36,578 --> 01:24:39,212
You mean so much to me.

1125
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:45,687
I don't want to ever hurt you
again,

1126
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,590
but, I can't promise
that to you right now.

1127
01:25:04,237 --> 01:25:06,541
- This is for you.

1128
01:25:07,809 --> 01:25:10,377
It's called a "A Dark Boy".

1129
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:15,083
Actually,

1130
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:16,316
now that I'm looking at this
light,

1131
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:17,919
I think it needs one more thing.

1132
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,220
Will you hold it up for me?

1133
01:25:21,188 --> 01:25:22,222
Flip it the other way

1134
01:25:22,255 --> 01:25:24,391
and as far away from your
face as you can, right?

1135
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:32,132
Right, one last thing

1136
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:34,736
and,

1137
01:25:37,639 --> 01:25:38,740
there,

1138
01:25:38,773 --> 01:25:39,774
much better.

1139
01:28:43,024 --> 01:28:44,424
- Feeling nervous?

1140
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,627
- Anxious,

1141
01:28:47,728 --> 01:28:49,329
to get on with it.

1142
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:51,364
- Well, don't forget me

1143
01:28:51,398 --> 01:28:53,034
when you're rich and famous.

1144
01:28:56,436 --> 01:28:58,773
What?

1145
01:28:58,806 --> 01:29:00,608
- I haven't even gotten
in yet.

1146
01:29:00,641 --> 01:29:02,910
- You're a shoe in.

1147
01:29:02,944 --> 01:29:03,945
- I'll see.

1148
01:29:07,815 --> 01:29:08,716
Here.

1149
01:29:11,118 --> 01:29:13,453
- Thank you.

1150
01:29:13,486 --> 01:29:14,856
- He'd be very proud of
you.

1151
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:20,460
- Fucking sucks
that he's not here.

1152
01:29:21,662 --> 01:29:23,764
- You know what?

1153
01:29:23,798 --> 01:29:25,533
It really does fucking suck.

1154
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:30,538
- That selfish arsehole

1155
01:29:30,571 --> 01:29:32,039
should have just listened to me.

1156
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:37,444
- Well, you know what he
was like.

1157
01:29:39,113 --> 01:29:40,480
- Yeah.

1158
01:29:41,682 --> 01:29:43,751
- Remember the time we
were building the stone wall

1159
01:29:46,654 --> 01:29:49,657
and he refused to wear
the steel capped boots

1160
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:52,425
and the third stone he was
carrying dropped it right-

1161
01:30:31,032 --> 01:30:36,037
- Ahhh, Ahhh, Ahhh

1162
01:30:53,888 --> 01:30:54,755
- Hi.

1163
01:30:55,656 --> 01:30:56,624
I'm Julian.

1164
01:30:56,657 --> 01:30:57,725
- Kieran.

1165
01:30:57,758 --> 01:30:59,026
- Is it your first time
auditioning?

1166
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,227
- Yeah.

1167
01:31:00,261 --> 01:31:01,963
- I could tell, I auditioned
for the first time last year

1168
01:31:01,996 --> 01:31:04,065
and I was shaking exactly like
you.

1169
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:06,499
- Is it that's obvious?

1170
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:07,335
- Yeah.

1171
01:31:07,368 --> 01:31:09,670
But don't worry, it's not that
bad.

1172
01:31:09,704 --> 01:31:10,805
They're all bit stuffy in there,

1173
01:31:10,838 --> 01:31:12,773
but they let you down easy.

1174
01:31:15,543 --> 01:31:17,111
- Ms. Henley you're up.

1175
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:18,980
And Ms. Dearg you're next.

1176
01:31:19,013 --> 01:31:22,650
- Actually, it's Mr. Dearg.

1177
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:27,221
- I am so sorry, I will
get that fixed immediately.

1178
01:31:29,623 --> 01:31:32,827
- I guess prestige doesn't
include proper record keeping.

1179
01:31:37,698 --> 01:31:39,800
After this, I'm meeting
up with a couple of pals,

1180
01:31:39,834 --> 01:31:42,069
a few blocks over at the pub.

1181
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:44,138
You should join us.

1182
01:31:45,139 --> 01:31:45,973
- Yeah?

1183
01:31:46,007 --> 01:31:47,141
- Yeah, totally.

1184
01:31:47,174 --> 01:31:49,577
They'd love to meet you and
we could show you around.

1185
01:31:51,612 --> 01:31:52,880
- I would love that, yeah.

1186
01:31:56,717 --> 01:32:00,621
- Mr. Dearg they're ready for
you.

1187
01:32:16,303 --> 01:32:18,039
- Kieran Dearg is it?

1188
01:32:20,074 --> 01:32:20,941
- Yes.

1189
01:32:23,144 --> 01:32:24,178
- You're from Dublin?

1190
01:32:25,946 --> 01:32:27,014
- About an hour out.

1191
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:31,185
- Not too bad of a
flight then?

1192
01:32:32,119 --> 01:32:33,587
- No, not bad at all.

1193
01:32:35,089 --> 01:32:36,357
- So,

1194
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:38,125
Kieran.

1195
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,194
What do you have prepared for us
today?

1196
01:32:41,295 --> 01:32:43,230
- The Son's Funeral monologue
from

1197
01:32:43,264 --> 01:32:45,633
"Metaphor of a Metamorphosis".

1198
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:50,137
- Alright.

1199
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:51,238
Whenever you're ready.

1200
01:33:07,755 --> 01:33:10,057
- I'm honored to speak here
today

1201
01:33:10,091 --> 01:33:12,593
and to celebrate the life of,

1202
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:21,168
I'm honored to be free.

1203
01:33:23,838 --> 01:33:27,007
I'm honored because her death

1204
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:29,977
is my permission to heal.

1205
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:34,215
She spent my whole life
trying to convince me

1206
01:33:34,248 --> 01:33:38,152
that I needed her, but
it was she who needed me.

1207
01:33:42,423 --> 01:33:44,325
And the fact that she abandons
me

1208
01:33:44,358 --> 01:33:46,694
the time when I need her most
is,

1209
01:33:48,195 --> 01:33:49,063
it's fitting.

1210
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:53,934
After I stuck around for all
these years.

1211
01:33:55,836 --> 01:33:56,704
It's fitting.

1212
01:34:04,211 --> 01:34:06,647
When a bird is freed from its
cage,

1213
01:34:08,315 --> 01:34:09,817
the constraints linger.

1214
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:14,688
Most people can't tell but,

1215
01:34:16,991 --> 01:34:20,094
a watchful eye can see,

1216
01:34:22,129 --> 01:34:25,766
when a free bird has just
learned to fly.
