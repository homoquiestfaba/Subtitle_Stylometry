( sighing )

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
( moans )
Mmm.

3
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:26,132
( kisses )

4
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:29,799
- Your hair smells good.
- Thank you.

5
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:32,200
- Is it that pear stuff you got?
- Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,767
- I like it.
- You like that?

7
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,668
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

8
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:40,534
- I do. Hi.
- Hi.

9
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:05,667
- Mmm...
- What?

10
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:13,751
- I'm so tired.
- I'm tired too, shit.

11
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:16,007
I was hoping you
were going to say that.

12
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:19,614
I was like--
I was like, are we doing this?

13
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,567
Because I don't know
if I'm really into it.

14
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,732
Man...

15
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:28,033
- I love you.
- You're awesome.

16
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:31,434
This is so great.

17
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:36,834
- Tomorrow though, yeah?
- Yeah, got it on the calendar.

18
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:37,933
- Great.
- It's actually better.

19
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:40,332
We can save the charge.
Make it count.

20
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,434
- Save it up.you don't want to waste it.
- Save it up.

21
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:46,734
- Man: <i>Good night, sweetie.</i>
- <i>Good night, baby.</i>

22
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:48,834
- Man: <i>I love you.</i>
- <i>I love you too.</i>

Shush, quiet quiet,
Anna's in there.

33
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,032
Fuck, that's right!
You've got a wife!

34
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,701
- You're still married.
- What the fuck are you doing, man?

35
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:46,501
What the fuck!

36
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:48,232
What the fuck!

37
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:51,200
What the fuck are
you doing here, man?

38
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:53,098
What the fuck
is this, dude?

39
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,701
- It's my gravitas, motherfucker.
- Your "gravitas"?

40
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:57,965
- What's that?
- This?

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,583
- Yeah!
- I'm pregnant, man.

42
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:01,132
Well, look at
that shit.

43
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,267
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, hey!

44
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:05,784
- Hey, sweetie.
- What's going on?

45
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,232
Andrew-- Andrew
from the wedding.

46
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:10,234
- I met you at the wedding.
- Oh, wow! Hi!

47
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:11,866
- Hi! Nice to see you.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:14,601
What's going on?
I'm so sorry for waking you up.

49
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:16,851
I got you a--

50
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:19,032
a duck...

51
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:21,467
- in Mexico.
- That is a gorgeous duck.

52
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,399
Thank you very much.

53
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:27,400
- You know, it's one of these.
- Oh, yeah.yeah, sure.

54
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:29,365
<i>What a perfect spot.</i>

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,901
- You guys, this is amazing.
- Thanks.

56
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:33,599
No, this is
fucking incredible.

57
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:36,267
- You got the car, you got the wife...
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:36,302 --> 00:03:40,200
- You got the coffee table books.
- Yeah.

59
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:42,133
Wow.

60
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:44,899
Good to
see you, man.

61
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,951
- I fucking love you, man.
- I love you too.

62
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:48,968
I love you so much.
And I will love you.

63
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:50,732
I don't love you
yet, but just--

64
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,801
- we'll spend a little time together...
- ( laughs ) okay.

65
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:54,685
And I will love you
like I love him.

66
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,534
- ( slaps Ben's face )
- <i>Ow.</i>

67
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:02,699
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

68
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,351
Let's get you settled in.
I'm assuming, you know...

69
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,933
- Oh yeah yeah! No, you should.
- Wanted a place to...

70
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:11,167
- If that's okay with you.
- Of course, of course. Yeah yeah.

71
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:12,968
<i>Right on, I would</i>
<i>love to, yeah.</i>

72
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,065
Of course you're
gonna sleep with us.

73
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,334
- I'm sure you have a tent somewhere.
- We'll hook you up.

74
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:22,200
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

75
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:42,334
( softly )
What the hell was that?

76
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:45,000
- I'm sorry.
- He is amazing!

77
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,199
Yeah, I--

78
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:50,133
I just want to say for the record
I had no idea he was coming.

79
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:51,499
He just does this.

80
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:53,299
- <i>Yeah. </i> no, I mean, I...
- I'm sorry.

81
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,167
I kind of assumed you would've
told me if you had a friend

82
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:58,634
who was going to show up
at 2:00 in the morning.

83
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,365
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,954
Oh my God!

85
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:03,834
He's not normally this hyper.
He'll settle down.

86
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:06,332
He just gets really excited.
He's like a puppy.

87
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:06,775
He's like--

88
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:08,517
Andrew: <i>Are you
guys naked in there?</i>

89
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:10,667
- Hey, man, getting your bed ready.
- <i>( knocks on door )</i>

90
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:11,934
- ( Anna sighs )
- Come on in.

91
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:18,100
- I love the hot water shower!
- Ben: <i>Feels good, right?</i>

92
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:20,866
- <i>How's it feel to be clean?</i>
- Amazing.

93
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:23,667
That shower was like the best
thing that ever happened to me.

94
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:25,667
Oh good, I'm glad.

95
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:27,199
All right.

96
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:29,699
- This room is great.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:32,899
- <i>I want to go...</i>
- <i>( clattering )</i>

98
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:35,567
- Mountain climbing.
- Ben: <i>don't worry</i> about that.

99
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,934
( chuckles )
I'm going to--

100
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:40,232
I think I'm going
to go to bed.

101
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:42,334
- All right, I'll be right up.
- Okay.

102
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,833
- Good night.
- Good night.

103
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:46,868
- <i>I love you, sweetie.</i>
- Thank you so much.

104
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:49,267
- See you in the morning.
- Love you.

105
00:05:49,302 --> 00:05:51,234
Andrew:
<i>I love you now!</i>

106
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,000
- She seems really awesome.
- <i>She's awesome.</i>

107
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:57,167
Yeah, she seems great.

108
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:59,100
She is.

109
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:04,217
<i>I was just saying,</i>
<i>it's crazy...</i>

110
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:07,259
that I started out the day
in Mexico City and...

111
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:10,267
- you were in Mexico City today?
- This morning.

112
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:12,400
- This morning?
- Yeah.

113
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:16,667
What the fuck are
you doing here, man?

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,532
What's going on?

115
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,632
You know
I started out--

116
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,883
I've been living
in San Cristobal de Las Casas

117
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,100
- down in Chiapas and--
- Whabababa?where?

118
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:30,833
It's a--
it's a state in Mexico.

119
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:33,367
The southernmost state
in Mexico, but, um, I--

120
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:36,100
- I've been there.
- Really?

121
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:38,299
No.

122
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,732
But, you know,
I started out--

123
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,067
I started an art project
with the locals there.

124
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,367
- Mm-hmm.
- And, you know, we've still got,

125
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:47,251
well, I've got to get
some funding.

126
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:49,065
I figured
I'd come here and meet

127
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,067
with some grant folks
and some gallery folks.

128
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:54,884
But, you know,
honestly,

129
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:57,632
a big part of it
was just--

130
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,567
I was in the airport
in Mexico City going, like,

131
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:03,118
"Okay, where, you know,

132
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:05,810
where do I want to go?"

133
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:08,432
And, um-- and then--

134
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:10,666
and then I thought
about you.

135
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,367
I felt like it was time,
it was, you know,

136
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:16,501
kinda well past time
for us to--

137
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,332
it's been a while.

138
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:21,300
- Yeah, just-- get back--
- It's definitely been a while.

139
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:23,351
- Get back on a page because--
- Yeah.

140
00:07:23,386 --> 00:07:25,443
I mean, dude,
we got different lives,

141
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,501
but, like, I respect
the fuck out of you

142
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:29,432
and you're
like my brother.

143
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:32,567
I respect what you're doing too, man.
I mean, I really do.

144
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:36,118
I-- I-- I don't exactly know
what it is that you're doing.

145
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:39,634
I get postcards every now
and then with little snippets,

146
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,165
like something about--

147
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,734
like some princess
and a hat and a smooch.

148
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:45,566
Dude, that's the hat...

149
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:47,934
- The hat I showed up in. That's the hat.
- That's the hat?

150
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,367
That's the hat.
( laughs )

151
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,065
In Morocco,

152
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,199
bought for me
by a princess.

153
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:58,934
- Yeah, she bought me a hat.
- What a wild life you live, my friend.

154
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:00,965
Yeah.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,332
Here's the thing is--

156
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,734
you always have the option
of doing what I'm doing.

157
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:10,501
And I don't know
that I so much have

158
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:13,199
the option of doing
what you're doing.

159
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:16,601
Oh, it's easy. Go, you know,
you just go to the grocery store,

160
00:08:16,636 --> 00:08:19,734
you find someone with
long hair that's a girl,

161
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,285
- start kissing her...
- ( laughing )

162
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,766
One thing leads
to another, you know?

163
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:28,834
Then you buy her a ring, you get
married, you buy a house and, you know,

164
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:31,667
soon enough you're converting
your upstairs office

165
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:35,098
into-- into
a potential baby room.

166
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:39,334
- Are you fucking serious?
- Not yet, but we're on the path.

167
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:41,784
We've officially
removed the goalie

168
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:44,200
and now we're just
doing free kicks.

169
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,901
- It's more fun that way.
- It is more fun that way.

170
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:49,499
Dude, that's amazing.

171
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:51,833
That's kind of like the
biggest thing you'll ever do!

172
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:52,692
It's kind of big.

173
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:55,017
It's the biggest thing
anybody will ever do.

174
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:58,167
Yeah. It's big. It hasn't happened
yet, but, you know, we're hoping.

175
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:02,500
Look, I should get to bed.
I got to--

176
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:05,499
I got to go do
the job thing tomorrow.

177
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,214
But, yeah, why don't
we just plan on--

178
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:09,067
I mean, if you don't
have plans or anything,

179
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:13,601
you know, maybe tomorrow night
we can just catch up proper.

180
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,451
- Totally.
- All right.

181
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:19,259
This is weird
seeing you.

182
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:22,033
Good weird.
All right, man.

183
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:23,968
( sighs, grunts )

184
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,334

- Ben: <i>Hey, sweetie.</i>

188
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,265
- <i>How are you?</i>
- <i>I'm good. How are you?</i>

189
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,901
<i>Oh, I'm just really excited</i>
<i>to get out of here.</i>

190
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:51,434
<i>Yes, me too. </i>
<i>So I got a call from Andrew,</i>

191
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:54,368
and he--
this is classic Andrew--

192
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:57,232
he met someone
at a coffee shop

193
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:00,036
and now he is hanging
out at her house and--

194

<i>( laughs )</i>

195
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:02,532
- <i>Wow.</i>
- Yes!

196
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:06,532
And she's got roommates
and they're artists.

197
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:10,033
And he wants me to come
over there and meet them.

198
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,998
So I feel
like I should go

199
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,666
- just to kind of go.
- <i>Oh, you-- no, yeah yeah.</i>

200
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,766
<i>I was hoping we could</i>
<i>all have dinner together.</i>

201
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:18,533
<i>I just want to get</i>
to know him a little bit.

202
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,032
<i>Yeah.</i>

203
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:20,290
<i>I was hoping we
could have dinner--</i>

204
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,200
<i>you want to do dinner?</i>

205
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:24,065
<i>I could make us</i>
<i>some pork chops</i>

206
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,566
<i>or something like that and
get a couple bottles of wine.</i>

207
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,179
<i>and we could just,
you know, hang out...</i>

208
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,033
<i>You're so sweet.</i>

209
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:32,301
I just love that the guy busts into
your house at 1:30 in the morning

210
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:34,499
and then you make him
your famous pork chops.

211
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,534
<i>( laughing )</i>

212
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,833
You're awesome.
I love it.

213

- <i>So I will go wrangle him.</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

214
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,667
<i>And we'll be home</i>
<i>as soon as we can get there.</i>

215
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:43,432
<i>Great great.</i>
<i>I'll have dinner ready.</i>

216
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,400
- <i>I love you, sweetie.</i>
- <i>I love you too, babe.</i>

- I didn't get your name.
- Andrew, he's here.

223
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,434
- I'm Monica.
- Monica, okay.

00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:13,766
- Jessie, John, Ben.
- Hi, guys.

- Yummy!
- <i>What is this thing?</i>

231
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:31,234
This is my famous
Genoese fettuccine--

Genoese.

234
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:39,998
Shit, Anna was going to make
her pork chops for us tonight,

235
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,267
like, she makes these famous pork
chops, to kind of welcome you.

236
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,132
- Monica: <i>Who's Anna?</i>
- She's my wife.

237
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,601
- Monica: <i> She should bring them.</i>
- <i>That's a great idea!</i>

238
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:48,933
- She should bring them.
- Yeah?

239
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:52,100
- Tell her to bring them.
- We have this incredible...

- standing Friday night feast, music--
- Okay.

00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:57,499
Dionysian.

242
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:00,100
And I think she might like
to try my fettuccine.

243
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:02,199
Yeah.well,
I'll call her and see.

- Right on. Check in with the--
- Let's get you a corkscrew.

247
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:13,634
How's it going? Hi.

Lily, Ben;
Ben, Lily.

- Hi, Ben.I'm Lily. Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you too.
How's it going?

251
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:22,998
- You got some tomatoes there?
- Making a salad.

252
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,478
Andrew:
<i>Do you have a rolling pin?</i>

253
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,934
Is this your domicile?

254
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:29,567
I end up here a lot 'cause
my girlfriend lives here,

255
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:31,601
but I actually
live down the street.

256
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:32,933
- Got it.
- Yeah.

257
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:36,634
- And your girlfriend is?
- Let's try some water.

258
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,667
That's your girlfriend--
Monica?

259
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:41,251
Monica.

- Right on.
- They're hitting it off, huh?

263
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,668
Yeah. I didn't want to
say anything at first

264
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,535
because I didn't want
it to be weird, but--

265
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,332
she, you know--
she likes her boy time.

266
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:00,200
- <i>who am I</i> to deprive her?
- All right, hey.

267
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:02,751
You know, it's all good,
you know, in the hood.

268
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:05,267
- <i>Yeah, they're hitting it off.</i>
- Yeah.

269
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:07,432
- It's cool.
- So,

270
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,599
how do you spend
your days?

271
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:12,467
- I'm a transportation planner.
- Hey, sweetie.

272
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:15,365
- Come here, look at you.
- Hi!

- Woman: <i>Hey, guys.</i>

- How are you?
- <i>Long time no see.</i>

276
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,734
I'm going to make
a quick phone call,

277
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:27,451
and I'll
be right back.

278
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:30,133

- Hey, baby.
- <i>Hey, sweetie.</i> How's it going?

281
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:44,567
Good good. What time are
you guys going to get here?

282
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:49,332
Um, well,
I'm here at the house.

283
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:53,801
<i>So there's a little hiccup.</i>
<i>Andrew, it seems like--</i>

284
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:56,065
he's wrapped up in potential
dinner plans here,

285
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,000
although I'm not sure it's all
about the dinner. There's this girl.

286
00:13:59,035 --> 00:13:59,326
Right.

287
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:01,901
<i>There's another girl
that she's interested in.</i>

288
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:04,417
<i>it's fucking--
I don't even know.</i>

289
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:04,901
Wha-- oh?

290
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:06,833
But I'm pretty sure
he's going to stay,

291
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:09,334
which totally sucks
'cause I know you were, like,

292
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:11,801
- <i>making an extra effort.</i>
- Well, whatever.

293
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:15,098
I mean, that's--
that's fine. Okay.

294
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,950
The other option is, of
course, you could come here.

295
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:20,767
They've invited you.
They definitely want to meet you.

296
00:14:20,802 --> 00:14:23,834
<i>Um, it's</i>
<i>a little weird.</i>

297
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:25,968
The place is
called Dionysus.

298
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,432
And they're not
kidding.

299
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,000
- ( snickers )
- <i>You're welcome to come...</i>

300
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,399
- and "Dionyse" here.
- <i>Wow.</i>

301
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:35,767
No, I think I'll stay and
hang out with my pork chops.

302
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:38,766
Okay. All right.
I'm going to, um,

303
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:41,734
put in a little face time and
then I'm going to come home.

304
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:44,265
And you and I are
going to share pork.

305
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,008
That's great.

306
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,733
<i>And then there was,
you know, obviously--</i>

307
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:51,167
our plan for the evening, which
we should do, don't you think?

308
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,968
Okay, yeah,
that sounds nice.

309
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:56,933
<i>And...</i>

310
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:59,365
sorry, I'm just trying
to figure out

311
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,098
if this is a girl or a boy
on the wall here.

312
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:02,829
<i>( laughs )</i>

313
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,466
Anyway, I'm going to
be home in an hour.

314
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:05,224
<i>Okay okay.</i>

315
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:07,434
Hopefully nothing terrible
will have happened to me.

316
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:10,232
All right. Well, you and I are
going to have a great dinner.

317
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:13,801
- <i>Yes, I'm looking forward to it.</i>
- And Andrew can suck it.

318
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:16,051
- I love you.
- <i>I love you too, babe.</i>

319
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:18,267
- Okay. Bye. I'm sorry.
- <i>All right, bye.</i>

320
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,968
( sniffs,
snaps fingers )

321
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,901
Fuck.

322

<i>( slow music playing )</i>

324
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,634
Andrew: See, dude, we have
to talk about something.

325
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,834
( snickering )

326
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,232
Fuck off.

327
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,334
- Do you even know what it is?
- Fuck off.

328
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:25,200
- It counts your steps.
- It's a pedometer.

329
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:30,534
- What's so funny?
- It counts your steps.

330
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:57,267
I mean, that's so,
that's so...

331
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:54,367
- <i>( Monica laughs )</i>
- Body parts touching and moving in ways

332
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:58,267
where you can't necessarily
tell what's what or who's whose,

333
00:17:58,302 --> 00:18:00,868
or how many there are.

334
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:03,998
( all laughing )

335
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:07,466
Monica: <i>They're really gorgeous.</i>
<i>They're really really...</i>

336
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:10,534
- <i>just aesthetically beautiful.</i>
- Lily: <i>Yeah, that's the point.</i>

337
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:13,367
You know, there's this sort
spirituality of that I really like.

338
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:15,100
Lily: <i>Melding</i>
<i>the connection,</i>

339
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,732
<i>the two bodies</i>

340
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:19,799
<i>becoming one</i>
<i>indiscernible, emotional--</i>

341
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:23,067
I'm just covering myself with
peanut butter and letting tangent,

342
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,100
- My dog, lick if off.
- ( all laugh )

343
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:28,532
Man:
<i>I love you.</i>

344
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,466
Lily:
<i>Whatever floats your boat.</i>

345
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:33,065
Woman: You do your sensitive
spiritual thing.

346
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,167
Ben: <i>What the fuck are</i>
<i>you guys talking about?</i>

347
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:37,299
Do you know about
Humpfest? You know,

348
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:39,417
- the amateur porn festival?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

349
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,609
No, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

350
00:18:41,644 --> 00:18:44,589
Andrew:
<i>Okay, dude, "The Stranger,"</i>

351
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,534
the newspaper, has this
amateur porn festival

352
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:49,599
where everybody
makes and-- and--

353
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:52,434
I think, you know, the type
of people who are making them

354
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:54,718
are making very
creatively-based

355
00:18:54,753 --> 00:18:56,933
- "porn" films,
- Got it. Got it.

356
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:57,816
<i>Alternative.</i>

357
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:59,601
Porn films-- and
everybody screens them.

358
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:01,632
And then at the end
of it, you know,

359
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,734
<i>they burn the tapes</i>
<i>and that's it.</i>

360
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,165
So it's like this
awesome art project.

361
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,132
- Cool.
- Woman: <i>we're</i> all doing one.

362
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,550

- Really? You're doing one?

363
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,899
- Monica: <i> You're doing one?</i>
- Fuck, yeah!

364
00:19:13,934 --> 00:19:16,667
- Man: <i>What are you doing?</i>
- Monica: <i>Wait a minute.</i>

365
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:19,701
- Man: <i>What are you going to do?</i>
- Something amazing.

366
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:22,399
( all laugh )

367
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:25,901
I will make--
I will make the raddest,

368
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:27,933
most awesome,
most beautiful,

369
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:30,701
- most profound, most poetic--
- Ben: <i>I got it, actually.</i>

370
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,532
What's that?

371
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:35,411
<i>All right. This blows
people away, okay?</i>

372
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:35,767
Uh-huh.

373
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:38,332
<i>It's you in a room.</i>

374
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,067
<i>And you're having sex with a girl</i>
<i>with blonde hair</i>

375
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:44,065
<i>with huge fake tits.</i>

376
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,100
- It will fucking blow everybody away--
- <i>( Monica laughs )</i>

377
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:50,232
An unprecedented
art porn film.

378
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:52,098
You have never seen me
boning before.

379
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:55,467
<i>I haven't seen</i>
<i>you boning before, no.</i>

380
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:59,067
- But this sounds--
- It is a work of art.

381
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:00,833
( all laughing )

382
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:01,834
What are you talking about?

383
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,300
<i>What are</i> you
<i>talking about?</i>

384
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,332
You ain't making a porno.
( laughs )

385
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,676
I'm making an art film.
I'm making an erotic--

386
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:09,100
You're gonna make an art film?

387
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:12,634
- An erotic art film.
- ( snorts, laughing )

388
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,866
- Fuck you.
- What? I just don't see--

389
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:19,899
Dude, don't hate.
Don't hate 'cause you can't play.

390
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:23,067
Don't hate 'cause you can't play
'cause you're all fucking locked up

391
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:26,200
- ball-and-chain domestic style.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

392
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:27,934
- Don't fucking hate on me.
- <i>What?!</i>

393
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:29,965
That doesn't mean
I can't make porn!

394
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,767
- Okay, what kind of porn?
- I can go make porn if I want to.

395
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:35,034
Yeah? What kind
of porn would you make?

396
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:37,232
- What kind of porn would I make?
- Yeah.

397
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:41,267
<i>Let's see. Well, first of all,
how are we going to get a camera?</i>

398
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:44,000
We need-- if you're
going to be in it,

399
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,432
we're going to need
a macro lens.

400
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:48,766
- <i>And--</i>
- ( Monica, Ben laugh )

401
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:51,151
- How are we going to do that?
- Monica: <i>Ouch.</i>

402
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:53,466
- That's complicated. Wait a minute.
- Poor thing.

403
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,201
Bring it, bring it.

404
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:55,968
Woman: <i>You know,
I think you guys maybe--</i>

405
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:58,566
- sticks and stones.
- Ben: <i>Um,</i>

406
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:01,399
seriously, I feel like,
you know, you go to google

407
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:05,132
you do a search for any kind
of porn-- it's been done.

408
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,968
<i>If you're going to do this,
you have to do something unique.</i>

409
00:21:08,003 --> 00:21:09,901
Otherwise it's like, what the fuck?
Who cares?

410
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,801
- Right?
- Andrew: <i>Totally.</i>

411
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:20,232
I should
just fuck you.

412
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:23,065
Nah, we do that
all the time.

413
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,934
I'm so sick of that. Everybody's
sick of watching that, you know?

414
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,799
Lily: <i>It's not like</i>
<i>there isn't gay porn.</i>

415
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,804
It's not like there aren't
lots of movies with guys.

416
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:33,067
Monica: <i>But they're not gay.</i>

417
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,067
There's a lot
of dude-on-dude porn.

418
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:37,617
But there's not
a lot of dude-on-dude

419
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:40,098
- who are... not gay.
- Could you even--

420
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:40,897
Andrew: Totally.

421
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:42,901
If you could do it,
that would be amazing.

422
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,866
I don't know if you
could actually do it.

423
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:47,466
Ben: <i>As in-- as in like,</i>
<i>I'll fucking--</i>

424
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:50,366
<i>I'll pop a fucking
pill and I'll be...</i>

425
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:51,300
( all laughing )

426
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:53,265
I mean-- okay,
this is what we're doing.

427
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,870
Lily:
<i>You guys are onto something.</i>

428
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:55,767
This is what we're doing.

429
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:58,133
- <i>What are we doing?</i>
- Ben: <i>You and me,</i>

430
00:21:58,168 --> 00:22:00,968
- two straight dudes...
- Andrew: Mm-hmm.

431
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:03,232
Straight balling.

432
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:06,133
- Monica: <i>Beyond gay.</i>
- <i>( Lily laughs )</i>

433
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:08,384
- Andrew: <i>Beyond gay.</i>
- It's beyond gay.

434
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,601
Lily: I know you're like
this is all a joke,

435
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:13,065
but if you will film

436
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,133
realizing this incredible way
to express your love

437
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,132
- for your longtime friend, I--
- Ben: It's tender.

438
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,567
- Tender is the butt.
- Monica: <i>You know what it is?</i>

439
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:24,651
I will bow down
and give you the trophy.

440
00:22:24,686 --> 00:22:27,666
That would be an
incredible piece of art.

441
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:31,801
It would be beautiful. It would
be a beautiful beautiful thing.

442
00:22:31,836 --> 00:22:34,885
It's kind of fucking amazing, dude.
I mean, you do this,

443
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,899
you close out the festival.
We come home with the trophy.

444
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,526
Dude, I fuck--
I love you...

445
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:41,667
Monica: It's definitely
beyond straight.

446
00:22:41,702 --> 00:22:44,933
...but in a million years,

447
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:47,901
when you wake up
and you're a little bit sober,

448
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:50,766
you would
<i>never</i> do that.

449
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:54,834
<i>Even in your craziest days</i>
<i>you would never do that shit.</i>

450
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:58,267
Okay, I'm going to book
a hotel room for us

451
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,032
- right now.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

452
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:03,634
<i>And we're going to fucking
get some sweet-ass equipment,</i>

453
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:06,667
and we're going to shoot a
fucking sweet-ass porn film.

454
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:08,868
- I'm going to book it right now.
- <i>Awesome.</i>

455
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:10,499
What are you doing
Sunday night?

456
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,966
Sunday night?
Boning the shit out of you.

457
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:13,834
<i>I'm-- no.</i>

458
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:16,998
Nope, wrong. Getting the
shit boned out of you by me.

459
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:19,934
- No, boning the shit out of you.
- <i>I'm calling 411 right now.</i>

460
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:22,868
- We'll fucking draw straws.
- <i>I'm calling 411 right now.</i>

461
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,801
- Let me hear it.
- You want to hear it?

462
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,065
All right
here it comes.

463
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,433
I'll hang up if you want me to.
I'll let you off the hook.

464
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:33,767
- Do you want me to hang up?
- Don't try to get off the hook,

465
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:35,497
'cause you're trying
to get off the hook.

466
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:35,699
Hello?

467
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:37,684
Operator: <i>I'm sorry, what
city and state, please?</i>

468
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:38,334
Seattle, Washington.

469
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:40,968
- <i>Thank you. What listing?</i>
- I'd like the phone number

470

472
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:51,098
<i>One moment.</i>

473
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:53,699
I'll hang up.
I'll hang up right now.

474
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:56,484
- Andrew: <i>Fuck!</i>
- Ben: <i>All right. Get the camera.</i>

475
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,199
Get the camera. What am I supposed
to do here? What's the angle?

476
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:01,374
Monica: <i>First you
pull down your pants.</i>

477
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,467
What's the angle on this?

478
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:04,998
Did you stick it in yet?
'Cause I don't feel anything.

479
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:07,085
Lily: Do you want me
to get a diagram out?

480
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:07,801
Oh, you'll know.

481
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:09,335
You won't have to ask.

482
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,834
You won't have to ask.

483
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:13,400

484
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,400
Whoa.

485
00:24:42,634 --> 00:24:44,899
Good morning.

486
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:47,232
Pleasant surprise.
Hello.

487
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:50,050
I really don't want
to talk to you right now.

488
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:52,799
- ( moans )
- You want to have sex with me,

489
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:55,650
- you don't want to talk to me?
- I spent a lot of time last night

490
00:24:55,685 --> 00:24:58,467
being mad at you and I just don't
want to talk to you right now.

491
00:24:58,502 --> 00:25:01,300
I'm not comfortable with-- I'm
not-- what the fuck is this?

492
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:04,234
I'm not really--
what are we doing here?

493
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,499
Forget it.

494
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,098
Whoa, I'm sorry.

495
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:10,767
I just think
that's a little weird.

496
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,499
What happened
last night?!

497
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:17,032
I spent so much time really
trying not to be mad at you,

498
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:21,067
trying to just understand, but, you know,
you didn't give me much to work with.

499
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,334
So can you please explain
to me what happened?

500
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:27,132
Can we just go back
a second, real quick?

501
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:31,217
You just came in here and
mounted me like a horse.

502
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:35,267
<i>And you wouldn't even</i>
<i>let me kiss you.</i>

503
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:37,451
You remember that I'm
ovulating right now?

504
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:39,576
And that we have
this tiny little window

505
00:25:39,611 --> 00:25:41,632
that actually pretty much
ended last night?

506
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,901
And I was just kind of hoping we
might be able to finish it today but--

507
00:25:44,936 --> 00:25:49,098
all right. I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry. You're right.

508
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:51,634
- <i>I screwed up, okay?</i>
- I just want to know what happened.

509
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:53,699
I just need you
to make me understand.

510
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:55,851
Andrew was there.
He's just like a wild card

511
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:57,968
and I was trying
to just look after him.

512
00:25:58,003 --> 00:25:59,732
And then he was
pouring shit.

513
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,634
I got a little drunk and I just
needed to sober up before I came home.

514
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:05,834
And it took you
until 3:00 a.m.

515
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:07,767
To sober up
to come home?

516
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,399
I just-- I'm not
buying it, Ben.

517
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:14,617
I mean, you know,
Andrew's a big boy.

518
00:26:14,652 --> 00:26:16,766
He's been out fucking
herding goats

519
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:19,467
or whatever he does, and
you have to look after him?

520
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:21,468
- ( sighs )
- I don't get it!

521
00:26:21,503 --> 00:26:23,434
All right,
all right, all right.

522
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,334
It was kind of fun.

523
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:31,632
Oh.

524
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:34,334
I mean, look, I'm not going to
hang out with them every weekend.

525
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:36,532
These people aren't going
to be my best friends.

526
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:39,267
But it was fun for a night to
experience some different people

527
00:26:39,302 --> 00:26:41,601
and some different
conversation.

528
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:44,466
And I enjoyed it,
okay?

529
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:46,617
I just feel like,
on the eve of us

530
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:48,699
making a family
and having kids,

531
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,732
we shouldn't be subscribing
so much to that lifestyle

532
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:55,134
that we close ourselves off
completely from other experiences.

533
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:58,518
If anything, I think we should
do more of those kinds of things,

534
00:26:58,553 --> 00:27:01,868
- you know what I'm saying? As parents.
- Where's the "we" in this?

535
00:27:01,903 --> 00:27:04,135
You left me with some
fucking pork chops last night.

536
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,367
<i>I invited you.</i>
<i>I mean, I invited you.</i>

537
00:27:06,402 --> 00:27:08,833
You invited me
in the most half-ass, like--

538
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:11,467
- that was before--
- "I don't know if you'll like it here.

539
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:13,933
It's really boring
and weird and uncomfortable,

540
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:18,034
but you should totally come down.
- What do you think I'm going to do?

541
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:22,100
I know, but that was before it got
kind of fun. So I'm sorry, all right?

542
00:27:22,135 --> 00:27:24,834
I don't know, man. I mean,
I got to say, just for a second,

543
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:26,732
I know it was my fault
and I screwed up.

544
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:30,067
But I'm a pretty great
husband and I'm always on time

545
00:27:30,102 --> 00:27:33,367
and I'm always stuff.
And I screwed up, like, one night.

546
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,766
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I deserve just like--</i>

547
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:38,234
<i>can I just get a "get out</i>
<i>of jail free" card?</i>

548
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:40,332
Like I just--

549
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,998
can I just get
a pass on this one?

550
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:44,132
I just don't even
know what to do with that.

551
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:46,434
- Yeah, get out of jail free!
- <i>And it was not fair.</i>

552
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:49,100
I mean, that's fine.
I'm going to go take a shower.

553
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:51,165
- <i>We can talk about this.</i>
- It's fine.

554
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,367
<i>You're right, it's cool.</i>
<i>I shouldn't be mad.</i>

555
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:57,400
- <i>( steps departing )</i>
- <i>( door slams )</i>

556
00:27:57,435 --> 00:28:01,134
I'm sorry.
That was my fault.

557
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:04,084
I'm grumpy
and I'm tired and--

558
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:07,000
can you come back
to bed, please?

559
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:09,934
<i>( shower running )</i>

560
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:25,100
- <i>Yo.</i>
- Hey.

561
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:26,934
Hey.

562
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:33,267
- Oh, coffee?
- <i>El cafe.</i>

563
00:28:33,302 --> 00:28:34,965
Good deal.

564
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,400
( blowing nose )
Oh fuck.

565
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:49,400
It's fucking
right there.

566
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:56,901
- Um, can I get that spoon?
- <i>mm-hmm.</i>

567
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,532
Thanks.

568
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:00,399
Is this salt or sugar?

569
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:02,434
<i>That's salt.</i>
<i>You don't want that.</i>

570
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:04,466
I mean, you might
want that.

571
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:07,617
No, that's not what I want.
Do you have sugar?

572
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:10,734
Yeah, it's up there
in that cabinet up there.

573
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:18,267
<i>Do you happen</i>
<i>to have anise seed?</i>

574
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:20,965
- Have what?
- <i>Anise?</i>

575
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,801
No, I don't have anise.
What-- anise?

576
00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:27,300
<i>Anise. It's like a--</i>

577
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:29,766
it's like a herb.

578
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,901
- It's like a licorice seed.
- <i>The seed-- no, I don't.</i>

579
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:35,466
Well, it would be up there
if it was here.

580
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:37,901
I didn't see it.
I'm sorry for poking around, but--

581
00:29:37,936 --> 00:29:40,234
<i>No, that's fine,</i>
<i>That's fine.</i>

582
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,601
Does that work?

583
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:53,866
Give me that.

584
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:56,534
Do you just suck on it
or do you swallow it?

585
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:00,667
- It's got to go under your tongue.
- <i>Under my tongue?</i>

586
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:09,534
<i>You kind of just
let it dissolve.</i>

587
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:10,133
Dissolve?

588
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,968
You're supposed to mix it
with anise. It works better.

589
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,067
<i>It's something</i>
<i>about the alkaline.</i>

590
00:30:19,102 --> 00:30:20,968
Mm-hmm.

591
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:25,167
I learned this
in Machu Picchu.

592
00:30:27,968 --> 00:30:31,634
- Mm-hmm.
- Is it working?

593
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:36,067
No.

594
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:40,367
What are you up
to today?

595
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:42,901
I want to get
some exercise.

596
00:30:42,936 --> 00:30:44,699
And I want
to throw up.

597
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:47,365
- You want to throw up?
- <i>I want to throw up.</i>

598
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,817
I got this nasty shit in my
stomach and I want to throw up.

599
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:54,234
It'll make me feel better.
So I'm going to go out and throw up.

600
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,067
<i>Sounds like</i>
<i>a well-spent day.</i>

601
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:58,000
<i>What are you up to?</i>

602
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:02,965
Um, well...

603
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,701
you know, I wanted
to go and see some art

604
00:31:05,736 --> 00:31:08,132
and maybe get laid.

605
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:12,567
But throwing up sounds
like a good alternative.

606
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:14,199
Mm-hmm.

607
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:16,667
- <i>( Andrew grunts )</i>
- Ben: <i>Yeah yeah yeah!</i>

608
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:18,318
( grunting )

609
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:19,934
- Nice!
- Yeah!

610
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:22,299
Good shot.

611
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:24,499
- Four to one.
- <i>Fuck, yeah.</i>

612
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:26,234
- That's good.
- <i>Do you have four?</i>

613
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:27,200
I've got four, yeah.

614
00:31:37,968 --> 00:31:40,000
Ben:
<i>Get some shit going.</i>

615
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,566
- Fuck, oh!
- ( both grunt )

616
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,684
Shit, man.
Dude, watch the dogshit.

617
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:49,126
- Watch out, here.
- So that's a foul.

618
00:31:49,161 --> 00:31:51,499
- ( Andrew laughs )
- Just so you know.

619
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,300
- On me or on you?
- That's a foul on you, yeah.

620
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:56,265
- What did I do?
- Um, I was planted...

621
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,400
'cause you did kind of kick
me in the balls a little bit.

622
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:01,367
That was after you
threw me onto the grass.

623
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:03,265
I got a little ringing
in my balls right now.

624
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,634
That was after you threw me
on the grass. So it's my ball.

625
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,866
Oi!

626
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:10,933
All right, six to one.
My ball.

627
00:32:10,968 --> 00:32:13,199
Dude, I think you've
had the ball enough.

628
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:15,667
Daddy wants the ball?
Okay, daddy wants the ball.

629
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:17,968
- Go ahead.
- Daddy had the ball.

630
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:20,000
Daddy had
the ball plenty.

631
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:23,599
Yep, missed
that one.

632
00:32:23,634 --> 00:32:26,400
Now let's do this.
Six-one.

633
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,432
Ref!

634
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:32,799
Yeah, seven-one.

635
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:35,601
- Let's just keep playing.
- Why don't you give me the ball?

636
00:32:35,636 --> 00:32:38,000
- <i>Seven-one.</i>
- Why don't you give me the ball?

637
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:40,934
( both grunting )

638
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:46,033
- ( both laughing )
- Andrew: Get off.

639
00:32:46,068 --> 00:32:47,684
Fuck!

640
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,265
Get off!

641
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,534
Okay, dude, fucking
give me the ball!

642
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:57,067
- Ben: Aw, fuck!
- Oh, Jesus!

643
00:32:57,102 --> 00:33:00,599
Get off! Fuck!

644
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:02,567
<i>( car horn honks )</i>

645
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:06,200
( honks )

646
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:15,033
( softly )
Fuck.

647
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,934
Hey.

648
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:33,000
That fucking hurt.

649
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,833
That's my bad.
Sorry about that.

650
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:44,300
- <i>You okay?</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine.

651
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:45,834
- You sure?
- Yeah.

652
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:56,033
I fucking hate
basketball.

653
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:18,467
Well, my body
hurts like shit,

654
00:34:18,502 --> 00:34:20,751
but my hangover's gone.

655
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:22,965
It works, doesn't it?

656
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,701
Now all you need is somebody
to rub your face in dogshit

657
00:34:25,736 --> 00:34:27,167
and that
takes care of it.

658
00:34:27,202 --> 00:34:29,866
( both laugh )

659
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,501
- I'm sorry if that was, uh--
- No no.

660
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:34,899
I'm--

661
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:38,432
I'm sure
that was just...

662
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:42,200
post-last night
residual weirdness.

663
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:43,884
Weirdy weird.

664
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,499
( grunts )
Yeah.

665
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:48,975
I was waiting for somebody
to talk about that.

666
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:49,634
( laughs )

667
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:53,866
Dude, I'm sorry
about that.it's--

668
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:56,634
- <i>It's fine.</i>
- No, it's just a fucking weird scene

669
00:34:56,669 --> 00:34:58,933
- to bring you in on.
- You know,

670
00:34:58,968 --> 00:35:03,067
it was a weird night and,
you know, it happened, and...

671
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:06,334
you know, nothing you
need to apologize about.

672
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,732
- It's just--
- <i>I mean, come on.</i>

673
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:10,300
I fucking roll into town and
all of a sudden, you know,

674
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:12,365
you're drunk and talking
about fucking dudes

675
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,065
and your wife is waiting
at home with a cold dinner

676
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,000
- ( laughs ) That she cooked for us.
- <i>Yeah, I know, but, I mean,</i>

677
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,566
you know, she's-- she's fine
and I made that decision.

678
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:23,901
It's wasn't like you dragged me
into it and forced me to stay there.

679
00:35:23,936 --> 00:35:26,100
I could've come home.
And I wanted to stay

680
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:27,965
and I had a good time
and, you know,

681
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,965
<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>to apologize for that.</i>

682
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,634
I get it and, look, we've known
each other a long fucking time.

683
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:35,632
And like I said
last night, you know,

684
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,973
<i>We've got really fucking
different lives now.</i>

685
00:35:38,974 --> 00:35:39,534
It's true.

686
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:41,934
And I get that
in the paradigm

687
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:43,666
in which you live,

688
00:35:43,701 --> 00:35:46,399
these weird conversations
are not things

689
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:49,299
that are really appropriate
and that, you know,

690
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:51,767
that I don't-- I don't
think any less of you for it.

691
00:35:51,802 --> 00:35:54,332
That-- you know, that--

692
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:56,968
first of all,
let's just, like, take the--

693
00:35:57,003 --> 00:35:58,965
take this down
just a second.

694
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,383
You're not as kerouac
as you think you are,

695
00:36:01,418 --> 00:36:03,732
even though you've
got the headband on.

696
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:06,801
<i>And I'm not as white picket fence</i>
<i>as you think I am, okay?</i>

697
00:36:06,836 --> 00:36:09,368
Like, the black and whites
in which you're thinking this

698
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:12,568
- is a little bit extreme, okay?
- Look, I'm saying it--

699
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,734
it's an awesome idea for an
art project, but I understand.

700
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:17,365
I think it's
an awesome idea too.

701
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,133
Yeah, but I understand
that it's not something

702
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:22,032
that you can really
do in your station.

703
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,200
<i>That's kind of what</i>
<i>I have a problem with.</i>

704
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:26,801
I feel like
you're trying to...

705
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:30,766
I don't know, man.
Like, what--

706
00:36:30,801 --> 00:36:31,570
Dude, I'm just--

707
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:34,167
<i>I'm not going to force
you to have sex with me.</i>

708
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:36,851
That is over, okay?
You don't need to, like--

709
00:36:36,886 --> 00:36:39,501
you're not forcing me.
I mean, if anything,

710
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:41,299
I'm calling it out
and going, like,

711
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:44,365
look-- fucking look--
last night was last night.

712
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:44,824
Yes. Yes.

713
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:46,801
<i>We were drunk.
It fucking happened.</i>

714
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:48,566
And I'm not
holding you to it,

715
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:50,599
- I guess is what I'm saying.
- <i>I know.</i>

716
00:36:50,634 --> 00:36:54,267
But what I'm saying is you don't need
to come here and let me off of the hook

717
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:56,968
based on some preconception
of who you think I am, okay?

718
00:36:57,003 --> 00:36:59,067
- <i>It's not--</i>
- You just worry about yourself

719
00:36:59,102 --> 00:37:00,833
and I'll worry
about myself, okay?

720
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:02,934
<i>If that is something</i>
<i>that I wanted to do,</i>

721
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:05,132
<i>then I would do it.</i>
<i>And it's not--</i>

722
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:07,667
<i>I'm not limited</i>
<i>because I'm married, you know?</i>

723
00:37:07,702 --> 00:37:09,466
Anna and I have
a strong relationship.

724
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:12,400
You don't really understand what a
marriage is 'cause you are single.

725
00:37:12,435 --> 00:37:15,118
And I appreciate that you think
you have an idea, but you don't.

726
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:17,801
We have the type of relationship
where if we want to do things,

727
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,732
we will do them.
Does that make sense?

728
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:20,814
I'm just-- I'm trying--

729
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:23,000
<i>You're trying to make
my decision for me.</i>

730
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,532
I'm not trying to make
your decision for you.

731
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:28,334
I'm just trying to be your friend
and let you know that it's cool.

732
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:30,599
<i>That, like, I get it that
we're in different spots.</i>

733
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:33,067
- I know you're saying all this shit--
- <i>Andrew, you need to--</i>

734
00:37:33,102 --> 00:37:34,770
<i>You need to shut
up for a second.</i>

735
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:34,933
Okay.

736
00:37:34,968 --> 00:37:37,901
You're making yourself sound
very close-minded and like a fool.

737
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:40,567
- <i>All right.</i>
- Stop trying to let me off the hook.

738
00:37:40,602 --> 00:37:42,998
Because you know
what it sounds like?

739
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:45,199
<i>It sounds like you're trying</i>
<i>to put this off on me</i>

740
00:37:45,234 --> 00:37:47,914
<i>as to why we're not doing it
because you can't handle it.</i>

741
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:48,367
Straight up,

742
00:37:48,402 --> 00:37:51,251
- <i>straight up, straight up.</i>
- Straight up.

743
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:54,100
You would have sex with
me on film for this project

744
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:57,300
- tomorrow night?
- I could absolutely do this.

745
00:37:57,335 --> 00:38:00,300
<i>You could</i>
<i>or you would?</i>

746
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:02,265
I would do it.

747
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,634
- You would?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

748
00:38:03,669 --> 00:38:05,766
'Cause I would.

749
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:07,799
- <i>Really?</i>
- Totally.

750
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:11,067
But I don't think we should do this
'cause neither one of us wants to back down.

751
00:38:11,102 --> 00:38:13,599
This shouldn't be about us
challenging each other.

752
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:16,067
This should be about us.
If we want to make a piece of art,

753
00:38:16,102 --> 00:38:18,365
we should make
a piece of art together.

754
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,100
I think the idea is fucking weird,
but I think it's great.

755
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,834
It's weird but it's amazing
and it pushes boundaries.

756
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,000
And that's what good
pieces of art should do.

757
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:30,766
Do you at least have
to talk to your wife?

758
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:33,466
Yeah, I do. And I'll have a
conversation with her about it.

759
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:35,405
<i>You think she's going
to be cool with it?</i>

760
00:38:35,406 --> 00:38:36,299
Absolutely
she's going--

761
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:40,234
<i>I can't predict what she's going to say,
but I'm going to have a discussion with her.</i>

762
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:43,467
I will say "okay, this is an art
project that I am thinking about doing."

763
00:38:43,502 --> 00:38:46,067
And we'll discuss it
and if she's not cool with it,

764
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:47,699
then, you know,
I won't do it.

765
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:50,199
<i>But, the thing is,</i>
<i>I think she will be</i>

766
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:53,334
because she understands me and that's
what a marriage is: People who are there

767
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:55,219
to support each other
and grow and do things.

768
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,701
<i>Great.</i>

769
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:57,834
And we have that
kind of relationship.

770
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,767
<i>Okay?</i>

771
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:04,165
- <i>You don't believe me.</i>
- No, dude--

772
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,801
- I think you're freaking out about this!
- <i>No no no.</i>

773
00:39:06,836 --> 00:39:08,918
- <i>No, listen--</i>
- You don't have to do this.

774
00:39:08,953 --> 00:39:11,000
If you go talk to Anna
and you come back to me

775
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:13,667
and you say it's on,
it is fucking on.

776
00:39:13,702 --> 00:39:15,699
Just erase
what you just said

777
00:39:15,734 --> 00:39:18,599
'cause I will handle the
situation with Anna, okay?

778
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:21,601
- So you're telling me right now it's on.
- <i>It's on.</i>

779
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:25,000
- <i>Straight up, it's on?</i>
- I'm not kidding you.

780
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:28,799
- Tomorrow night?
- <i>Yeah, tomorrow night.</i>

781
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:32,701
If you're going to back out,
do it now, because I'm serious.

782
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,283
Yeah. Well,

783
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:38,167
I'll be there.

784
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:40,901
Okay. Me too.

785
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,267
<i>( slow jazz playing )</i>

786
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:01,734
- Hello-oo!
- <i>Hi.</i>

787
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:04,400
Welcome home.

788
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:08,199
Wow, that's, um--

789
00:40:08,234 --> 00:40:10,365
- This is really nice.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

790
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,000
<i>It was my fault.</i>
<i>Last night was stupid of me.</i>

791
00:40:14,035 --> 00:40:17,884
- I'm sorry. I love you.
- I'm sorry too.

792
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:21,734
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. I'm really--

793
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:24,051
this is--
this is nice.

794
00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:26,334
I just want
to be us, okay?

795
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:28,098
- Yeah.
- I love you.

796
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,417
Thanks.
I'm going to put my bag down

797
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:32,666
- and come-- wow!
- Okay. Come sit

798
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:34,776
and I will rub your
feet and serve you...

799
00:40:34,777 --> 00:40:35,567
<i>( laughs )</i>

800
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:37,334
...and do all those things.

801
00:40:39,634 --> 00:40:42,834
Ben: <i>So there's something kind of
important I wanted to talk to you about.</i>

802
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:47,067
It's kind of
an elephant in the room,

803
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:49,501
or if you will,
a duck in the room.

804
00:40:49,536 --> 00:40:51,566
( laughing )

805
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:55,167
And I just want to say thank you for
allowing that to sit on our mantel.

806
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,851
Oh, but it can go away, right?
As soon as he leaves--

807
00:40:57,852 --> 00:40:58,734
God bless his soul.

808
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:00,599
Yeah, as soon as he leaves,
it can go away.

809
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:02,732
It can just go down
and live in the storage room?

810
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:05,667
The fact that you are allowing
that to stay up while he's here

811
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:08,365
is a testament to how
amazing a woman you are.

812
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,938
It's just classic Andrew.
I mean, it's weird.

813
00:41:10,939 --> 00:41:11,434
( laughs )

814
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,051
- This was really good by the way.
- Oh, thank you.

815
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:16,634
- I'm glad you dug it.
- Yeah, I really appreciate it.

816
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:18,532
You're welcome.

817
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:21,000
Um, but, yeah,
back to the Andrew thing,

818
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:23,200
I mean, he's just--

819
00:41:24,434 --> 00:41:26,732
he's just lost, you know?

820
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:29,017
Um, and even last night,
you know,

821
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:31,232
I just was watching him
at that party

822
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:36,367
and he's just, like, trying to get
something going in his life, you know?

823
00:41:36,402 --> 00:41:38,833
The good news is
actually

824
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:40,998
he met some people
there last night,

825
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:45,100
you know, kind of just his
kind of peeps. And they, um,

826
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,833
they're all involved
in this sort of art festival.

827
00:41:47,868 --> 00:41:50,506
And they've invited Andrew
to be a part of it...

828
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:50,667
Wow.

829
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:53,098
...and sort of add his own
piece to the festival.

830
00:41:53,133 --> 00:41:53,787
That's great.

831
00:41:53,788 --> 00:41:55,801
So he's totally psyched.
And he's, like,

832
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:57,933
"Oh, man, I need your help!"
So I was like,

833
00:41:57,968 --> 00:42:00,399
- "sure, of course I'll help."
- Oh, that's so cool.

834
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,665
Not that I know art.

835
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:04,434
No, that'll be great though.
That's so great.

836
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:06,766
Is it a festival that
they put on themselves?

837
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:10,034
It's this cool thing, actually,
that "the stranger" does.

838
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,651
It's like this film festival
that they put on every year.

839
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:17,234
I hadn't heard of it. And
they make these kind of artsy

840
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:19,199
- films about--
- It's not Humpfest?

841
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:22,400
- What's that?
- It's not Humpfest, is it?

842
00:42:22,435 --> 00:42:24,566
Um, I'm not
exactly sure.

843
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:27,933
- That might...
- The-- the porn festival?

844
00:42:27,968 --> 00:42:31,432
"The stranger" does a
porn festival every year.

845
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:34,767
I didn't know necessarily what it
was because I hadn't heard of it

846
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,399
but their take on it was
it's an art festival

847
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:40,651
that is about reclaiming
pornography back to an art place

848
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:43,868
instead of like a disgusting
place that we all know it as--

849
00:42:43,903 --> 00:42:46,300
- was my understanding of the project.
- Is--

850
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:48,434
is somebody having
sex in his film?

851
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:52,965
Yes, as far as
I understand.

852
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,466
( snickers )
And what are you doing with the--

853
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:59,801
I just told them I would help, you
know? So I'm just going to like--

854
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:03,334
you know, lackey stuff is
what I'm assuming, you know?

855
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:05,699
I don't know what the...

856
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:08,417
job roles or titles are
or would be,

857
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:11,065
but I'm assuming
I would, like, um...

858
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,132
maybe I can like make them
breakfast or something, you know?

859
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:17,400
Like feed the crew 'cause I know
it's like a low-budget kind of thing.

860
00:43:17,435 --> 00:43:19,566
Or I could bring
coffee in or, um,

861
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:22,051
you know, if they needed
like copies or something,

862
00:43:22,086 --> 00:43:24,466
I could just run to Kinko's
and make some copies,

863
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,117
<i>or, I mean, I don't know.</i>
<i>I think I just--</i>

864
00:43:27,152 --> 00:43:29,699
I'm not an artist and, you know,
that's not my thing.

865
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:33,167
And so I just want to lend my
support 'cause he's super excited

866
00:43:33,202 --> 00:43:35,399
<i>and they're going</i>
<i>to do it tomorrow night.</i>

867
00:43:35,434 --> 00:43:38,267
And I figured, "you know what?
I should lend a hand on that."

868
00:43:38,302 --> 00:43:41,601
So, you know, I thought
that was pretty cool.

869
00:43:41,636 --> 00:43:43,532
Um...

870
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:45,432
I don't know,

871
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:47,200
you know,
I thought it was...

872
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,300
you know, we don't have to--
we can talk about this later.

873
00:43:52,335 --> 00:43:55,434
Let's just enjoy
our dinner, okay?

874
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,801
I love you.

875
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:08,467
<i>( jazz music playing )</i>

876
00:44:15,634 --> 00:44:17,868
<i>( door creaking )</i>

877
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:18,332
Ho!

878
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:22,400
- ( Monica laughs )
- I just touched some rubber cocks.

879
00:45:22,435 --> 00:45:26,434
- Did she scare you?
- Dude, who the fuck are those for?

880
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:29,418
Don't be scared.
They don't bite.

881
00:45:29,453 --> 00:45:32,332
- Hey-yy...
- ( girls laughing )

882
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:35,167
How about we go <i>au naturel</i>
for a while?

883
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,959
<i>Au naturel?</i> I already
have a lover with a cock.

884
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,801
Lily: This is what

885
00:45:40,836 --> 00:45:44,067
- I want to do tonight.
- It's true. And I don't want...

886
00:45:44,102 --> 00:45:46,566
- right right, but--
- ...one cock to disappear

887
00:45:46,601 --> 00:45:49,132
because there's a new cock in town.
Like, it's just--

888
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,875
that's not the way
it's going to happen.

889
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:52,733
( both laugh )

890
00:45:52,768 --> 00:45:53,434
I'm sorry.

891
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:56,300
Andrew: Look, let's
try, maybe for tonight,

892
00:45:56,335 --> 00:46:00,068
using my machinery.
See how it goes

893
00:46:00,103 --> 00:46:03,302
and if all parties
aren't satisfied...

894
00:46:03,337 --> 00:46:05,935
- ( Lily scoffs )
- Then we can bring--

895
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,499
- Lily: Oh.
- That's just not how it goes.

896
00:46:08,534 --> 00:46:11,034
- It's just not how it goes, honey.
- You know--

897
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,534
- Monica: <i>It's not, I'm sorry.</i>
- Uh-huh.

898
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:16,499
All right.
No.yeah.

899
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:18,833
- Aww.
- No no no, it's cool.

900
00:46:18,868 --> 00:46:21,267
- You really don't have to be threatened.
- Yeah.

901
00:46:21,302 --> 00:46:23,632
No no, it's--
no, it's cool.

902
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:26,767
It's cool. It's cool. It's
cool. It's cool. I'm just--

903
00:46:26,802 --> 00:46:28,899
Yeah.

904
00:46:28,934 --> 00:46:32,801
- I'm really disappointed.
- <i>Yeah, me too.</i>

905
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:36,683
- Monica: It doesn't--
- No, I'm sorry.

906
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:39,199
- <i>I'm such a fucking square.</i>
- Oh.

907
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:42,734
I'm sure that I will
see you some other time,

908
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:44,801
some other place.

909
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:47,799
And, um,

910
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:50,033
<i>au revoir.</i>

911
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,065
( whispers )
Boys.

912
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,901
- ( laughs )
- Fucking boys.

913
00:46:59,936 --> 00:47:03,033
( both laughing )

914
00:47:05,234 --> 00:47:07,734
<i>( distant barking )</i>

915
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:32,467
<i>( faucet running )</i>

916
00:47:40,701 --> 00:47:42,300
Hey.

917
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:46,732
- Hey.
- I didn't mean to startle you.

918
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:50,000
- <i>shit, I'm sorry.</i>
- That's really sweet of you to clean up.

919
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:53,133
- Oh, no no, it's nothing.
- <i>( turns faucet off )</i>

920
00:47:53,168 --> 00:47:55,367
I was just going to
get a glass of water.

921
00:47:56,968 --> 00:47:59,866
<i>I still have a couple</i>
<i>yet to wash though.</i>

922
00:47:59,901 --> 00:48:03,234
Just leave them. I'll do them
in the morning. It's no big deal.

923
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:05,432
I can-- I can finish.

924
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:07,501
You guys had
a nice dinner?

925
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:08,933
Yeah yeah!
Ben cooked.

926
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:11,466
- It was really-- it was great.
- <i>Oh, that's very sweet.</i>

927
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:14,934
The leftovers on the plates as I was
scraping them off smelled very good.

928
00:48:14,969 --> 00:48:17,186
<i>There's more in the fridge.
Have you eaten?</i>

929
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:17,534
No no no.

930
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:19,998
I wasn't fishing.
I just-- you know,

931
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:22,300
<i>it was a dumb</i>
<i>compliment.</i> Sorry.

932
00:48:22,335 --> 00:48:24,300
( chuckles )
Are you, um,

933
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:26,132
how was your night?

934
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:28,332
It was-- it was strange.

935
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:29,998
It was all right.
It was all right.

936
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,634
- I should go to bed.
- <i>Oh, really?</i>

937
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:34,968
Um, do you, um--

938
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:37,232
do you wanna--

939
00:48:37,267 --> 00:48:39,434
do you want to have a drink with me?
( laughs )

940
00:48:41,133 --> 00:48:43,616
<i>I just-- I feel like I
haven't had a chance</i>

941
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:46,100
to get to know you at all
and I'd-- I'd love to.

942
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:49,917
- <i>Yeah, sure. Totally.</i>
- Yeah?

943
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:52,593
Okay, cool. I just--
I got some, um--

944
00:48:52,628 --> 00:48:55,298
we got some scotch
when we moved in

945
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,968
and I guess it's
really good. Um...

946
00:48:58,003 --> 00:49:00,866
- ( both laugh )
- And-- and,

947
00:49:00,901 --> 00:49:04,167
like, I was going to
perform spoken-word poetry.

948
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:06,268
<i>( both laughing )</i>

949
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,299
I had to write a paper.

950
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:10,232
Well, listen.
Listen listen.

951
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:13,934
So he literally pulled out
for a non-paid internship.

952
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:16,132
- Wow!
- And he backs out.

953
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:19,299
He backs out on the entire trip
which we had been planning forever,

954
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:23,400
which we've got nicknames for-- like,
we were calling each other Sal and Dean.

955
00:49:23,435 --> 00:49:26,568
It's like, you know?
And I did--

956
00:49:26,603 --> 00:49:29,666
I did the trip,
but, um, uh...

957
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:33,699
I couldn't actually
manage to turn anything in.

958
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:36,868
So I never graduated. And that
is why I'm not a college graduate.

959
00:49:36,903 --> 00:49:38,965
( laughs )
That's so sad!

960
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,194
And I still to this
day blame your husband.

961
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:43,501
As well you should.

962
00:49:43,536 --> 00:49:46,033
What a dick!
( snickers )

963
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:47,666
Totally.

964
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:51,300
( both laughing )

965
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:56,367
- Dude, you're cool.
- Oh, I'm so glad you like me!

966
00:49:56,402 --> 00:49:59,467
- You are far cooler than you look.
- Oh...

967
00:49:59,502 --> 00:50:02,051
no, I didn't--
no, I didn't mean that.

968
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:04,566
- I just meant that--
- no, I get it.

969
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:07,601
What I meant was--
what I meant-- what I meant--

970
00:50:07,636 --> 00:50:10,499
was that I am a dick

971
00:50:10,534 --> 00:50:13,701
close-minded motherfucker
is what I meant.

972
00:50:13,736 --> 00:50:15,332
- No, it's--
- Because--

973
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:18,734
I'm sure I look like,
you know, Betty Crocker

974
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:21,667
with my white
picket fence outside.

975
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:23,899
No no no, but seriously.

976
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:26,634
And, you know, that's what
Ben was saying and I just--

977
00:50:26,669 --> 00:50:29,518
like I'm just now
realizing that he was right

978
00:50:29,553 --> 00:50:32,510
which is-- he was like,
"dude, don't judge me.

979
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:35,439
Just because I have
pleats and a pedometer.

980
00:50:35,474 --> 00:50:38,303
And a wife doesn't mean
that, like, you know."

981
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:41,133
The pedometer is pretty
sexy, I've got to say.

982
00:50:41,168 --> 00:50:43,032
You like that shit?

983
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:45,750
We got a plan for the
pedometer for tomorrow.

984
00:50:45,785 --> 00:50:48,434
- Really?
- We've got a whole thing, yeah.

985
00:50:48,469 --> 00:50:50,332
What's your-- oh right!

986
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:55,234
Oh my God, I can't believe I
haven't grilled you about this yet!

987
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:57,566
( laughs )
Tell me!

988
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:02,051
Tell me all about this. I cannot
wait to hear about it.

989
00:51:02,086 --> 00:51:06,168
So-- so he talked to you
about that whole thing.

990
00:51:06,169 --> 00:51:06,501
Yeah.

991
00:51:06,536 --> 00:51:08,833
( laughing )

992
00:51:08,868 --> 00:51:11,666
- This is weird.
- ( both laugh )

993
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:15,234
Well, I mean, you're going to have
to get used to talking about it.

994
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:19,133
I guess so. I mean, it's weird,
but, like, you're awesome.

995
00:51:19,168 --> 00:51:22,000
And you're making it
less weird, which is great.

996
00:51:22,035 --> 00:51:25,732
Well, I just--
I guess I just feel like,

997
00:51:25,767 --> 00:51:28,767
in the long run, what's
the big deal, right?

998
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:32,065
- I mean...
- Totally.

999
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,217
Totally.
I just don't know...

1000
00:51:34,252 --> 00:51:36,299
I mean, I just
have to say, like,

1001
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:39,400
that's <i>astoundingly</i>
open-minded of you

1002
00:51:39,435 --> 00:51:42,267
- in a really good way.
- Jesus, I guess I just--

1003
00:51:42,302 --> 00:51:45,167
I just didn't really
realize what kind of a square

1004
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,033
- you thought I was before.
- ( both laughing )

1005
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:51,000
No, it's just that--
you know, I mean,

1006
00:51:51,035 --> 00:51:52,799
there are people
who I know who are like

1007
00:51:52,834 --> 00:51:56,965
in kind of secretly
polyamorous relationships,

1008
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,734
but it's only the people, like,
who are really fucking honest

1009
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:03,584
which is what Ben said that
you guys were to each other,

1010
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:06,400
who actually make it function.
But, you know, it's--

1011
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:08,332
I mean, not that
it's polyamorous.

1012
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:10,667
It's like one fucking night.
It's not like--

1013
00:52:10,702 --> 00:52:12,632
it's not like
it has to have...

1014
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:13,965
What are you talking about?

1015
00:52:13,966 --> 00:52:16,033
...implications for
your whole relationship

1016
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:18,499
- or anything.
- I have no idea what

1017
00:52:18,534 --> 00:52:23,133
- you're talking about.
- Me and Ben having sex on film is like,

1018
00:52:23,168 --> 00:52:25,934
you know, is kind of crazy.

1019
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,801
Hang on.
Wait wait wait.

1020
00:52:31,836 --> 00:52:33,968
( faltering )

1021
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:38,032
So...

1022
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:41,466
so the movie
tomorrow is--

1023
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:46,701
is-- is you and Ben
having sex?

1024
00:52:48,434 --> 00:52:50,232
Right.
( laughs )

1025
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,017
- Oh, well, no. Not-- not--
- Yeah.

1026
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:53,732
- Wait wait wait wait.what--
- Ben.

1027
00:52:53,767 --> 00:52:57,234
- Ben!Ben!
- No no no, he-- wait wait wait.

1028
00:52:57,269 --> 00:52:59,132
- Wait, it's not--
- No no, it's okay.

1029
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:01,566
- It's fine. It's fine.Ben!
- <i>No no no no, it's not.</i>

1030
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:03,700
What happened?
What happened, what happened?

1031
00:53:03,701 --> 00:53:05,100
What's going on? What happened?

1032
00:53:05,135 --> 00:53:06,532
- I--
- Did you do something?

1033
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:08,866
Shut the fuck up,
both of you, right now.

1034
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:11,367
- Okay okay okay.
- What the fuck is going on in here?

1035
00:53:11,402 --> 00:53:14,151
You said you were going to
tell her and she said she knew

1036
00:53:14,186 --> 00:53:16,901
and then I just talked about
it and I guess she didn't know.

1037
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:24,299
You told her?

1038
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,501
<i>( softly )</i> <i>"You told her?"</i>
<i>( snickers )</i>

1039
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,768
Dude, you said you were
going to tell her at dinner.

1040
00:53:28,803 --> 00:53:31,835
- I was going to tell her.
- We were talking and I got--

1041
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,868
I planned on telling you
at dinner and I got-- fuck!

1042
00:53:34,903 --> 00:53:36,599
- Okay.
- Anna: <i>are you--</i>

1043
00:53:36,634 --> 00:53:38,566
this is not the way I wanted
this to come out.

1044
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:42,534
<i>I wanted to tell you at dinner.</i>
<i>I planned on telling you.</i>

1045
00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:44,632
It just-- the conversation
didn't go well.

1046
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:46,998
I could see you were freaking
out about the word porn

1047
00:53:47,033 --> 00:53:50,067
- <i>and the porn angle.</i>
- "Freaking out"-- I was freaking out.

1048
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,232
I'll show-- I-I--

1049
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:56,200
<i>I cannot even</i> believe
<i>I'm standing in my kitchen</i>

1050
00:53:56,235 --> 00:53:58,165
<i>talking to you about...</i>

1051
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,167
- Ben: <i>okay.</i>
- ...making a porn film with him!

1052
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:05,299
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Tomorrow? I mean,</i>

1053
00:54:05,334 --> 00:54:07,934
<i>I just, I--</i>
<i>( breathing heavily )</i>

1054
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:09,998
Ah-hh!

1055
00:54:10,033 --> 00:54:13,300
- Just-- what the fuck!?
- Ben: <i>Okay.</i> All right.

1056
00:54:13,335 --> 00:54:16,365
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Okay okay okay.</i>

1057
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,868
<i>Let's just calm down for a second.</i>
<i>Let's just--</i>

1058
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:23,501
I just-- can you--
can you tell me why?

1059
00:54:23,536 --> 00:54:25,132
( stammers )

1060
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:28,200
Why is this
even happening?

1061
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:30,299
Just-- just calm down.

1062
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:32,067
( softly )
Can we go in the bedroom

1063
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,766
and have a conversation,
please?

1064
00:54:33,801 --> 00:54:36,240
I'm right here. Let's
have a conversation.

1065
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:36,467
Okay.

1066
00:54:36,502 --> 00:54:38,934
I need you to tell me
why you're doing this.

1067
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:44,100
I don't know
why I'm doing this.

1068
00:54:45,634 --> 00:54:47,965
I know it's
important to me

1069
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,200
and I don't see the reason why we
have to get all worked up about it.

1070
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:03,100
I'm going to go to bed.

1071
00:55:13,267 --> 00:55:15,200
<i>( door slams )</i>

1072
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,267
I should, um--

1073
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:42,532
I should go talk to her.

1074
00:55:42,567 --> 00:55:43,156
I'm so sorry.

1075
00:55:43,157 --> 00:55:45,601
<i>Dude, it's not your fault.
It's not your fault.</i>

1076
00:55:45,636 --> 00:55:49,167
Not even. Nope.

1077
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,532
I'm-- I'm gonna--

1078
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:55,467
should I go
somewhere else?

1079
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,501
<i>I just don't know if it will
help or hurt if I'm here.</i>

1080
00:56:00,536 --> 00:56:03,466
- You're fine. You're fine.
- Okay.

1081
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:05,399
- <i>Yeah, you're fine.</i>
- All right.

1082
00:56:05,434 --> 00:56:09,167
I think I basically
just need to sit with her

1083
00:56:09,202 --> 00:56:11,100
and I need to...

1084
00:56:13,868 --> 00:56:17,501
just talk it out.
She's pretty good about, um...

1085
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,200
I'm beginning to feel
like a total fucking fraud.

1086
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:55,434
I guess that the way I
like to think of myself

1087
00:56:55,469 --> 00:56:59,300
and the way
I actually am are...

1088
00:56:59,335 --> 00:57:01,866
um...

1089
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:03,866
maybe more different

1090
00:57:03,901 --> 00:57:06,934
- than I'd like them to be, you know?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1091
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:12,467
<i>I think I was 17 when
somebody asked me, you know,</i>

1092
00:57:12,502 --> 00:57:14,668
<i>what do I want</i>
<i>to do when I grow up.</i>

1093
00:57:14,703 --> 00:57:16,834
<i>And I said I wanted</i>
<i>to be an artist.</i>

1094
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:20,432
And I don't think...

1095
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:24,950
no, actually I know
I've never completed

1096
00:57:24,985 --> 00:57:29,434
a single fucking project
in my entire life.

1097
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:45,234
<i>Can I tell you something I've
never told anyone before?</i>

1098
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,466
Yeah.

1099
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,801
When I first moved to
Seattle, when I was 18,

1100
00:57:53,836 --> 00:57:56,699
I was really lonely.

1101
00:57:56,734 --> 00:57:59,567
I would just rent
movies all the time

1102
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:02,400
because I didn't
have any friends.

1103
00:58:02,435 --> 00:58:04,817
And there was this guy--

1104
00:58:04,852 --> 00:58:07,165
a video-store clerk
there

1105
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,634
who recommended a Frank Lloyd Wright
documentary to me

1106
00:58:10,669 --> 00:58:12,899
and I normally don't
take recommendations,

1107
00:58:12,934 --> 00:58:16,767
but I was like "sure." Something
about him made me just say "sure."

1108
00:58:16,802 --> 00:58:19,968
I watched it and it was
kind of dry, you know,

1109
00:58:20,003 --> 00:58:21,833
<i>and kind of boring</i>

1110
00:58:21,868 --> 00:58:24,701
<i>and I brought it back
to the store the next day.</i>

1111
00:58:24,736 --> 00:58:26,566
<i>And he looked at me</i>

1112
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:28,833
<i>and I told him that I
thought it was great.</i>

1113
00:58:28,868 --> 00:58:32,033
I don't know why I did that because
I'm not really a people pleaser,

1114
00:58:32,068 --> 00:58:34,699
but there was
something about him.

1115
00:58:34,734 --> 00:58:37,734
And then I quickly discovered
that it was the first disc

1116
00:58:37,769 --> 00:58:39,899
- in a 10-disc series.
- <i>( Andrew laughs )</i>

1117
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:43,384
( laughs ) So he handed me disc two
which I went home and watched

1118
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:46,834
<i>and liked even less.</i>
<i>And I was determined to go back</i>

1119
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:49,567
<i>and tell him</i>
<i>the truth this time.</i>

1120
00:58:49,602 --> 00:58:51,518
<i>And when I got there</i>

1121
00:58:51,553 --> 00:58:53,434
<i>and I looked at him,</i>

1122
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:55,499
I said,

1123
00:58:55,534 --> 00:58:58,634
"disc two was even better
than the first one."

1124
00:58:58,669 --> 00:59:01,399
And it continued on
in this cycle.

1125
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:05,767
I would see him every day and rent
discs all the way through disc 10.

1126
00:59:05,802 --> 00:59:08,732
And when I was done,
I was really sad

1127
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:13,234
that we weren't going to have that
to talk about in the store anymore.

1128
00:59:13,269 --> 00:59:16,165
<i>So I went home</i>

1129
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,968
and I couldn't stop
thinking about him

1130
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:21,165
and those, like,

1131
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,499
dorky-hemmed jean shorts

1132
00:59:24,534 --> 00:59:27,232
and his pale,
kind of overly hairy legs

1133
00:59:27,267 --> 00:59:32,534
<i>and then just the blue eyes</i>
<i>just popping out.</i>

1134
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,201
<i>And I started</i>
<i>imagining kissing him</i>

1135
00:59:36,236 --> 00:59:39,799
<i>and it wasn't</i>
<i>actually that weird.</i>

1136
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:43,787
And then I started
thinking about his balls...

1137
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,133
<i>( laughs )</i>

1138
00:59:45,168 --> 00:59:48,300
And like how hairy
they would be

1139
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,899
and I got so freaked out

1140
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:55,934
and I never went to
Island Video ever again.

1141
01:00:02,868 --> 01:00:07,334
I just feel like you should
know that because, you know,

1142
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:10,001
I know I'm pretty sure
my motives are pure,

1143
01:00:10,036 --> 01:00:12,634
but I mean I had
a moment with that guy,

1144
01:00:12,669 --> 01:00:14,901
like I felt something.

1145
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:19,033
You know?

1146
01:00:19,068 --> 01:00:21,033
Yeah.

1147
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:25,100
Um...

1148
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:39,834
I don't think I've ever
had one of those moments.

1149
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,934
It's pretty weird.

1150
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:48,501
But again it's
almost like, um...

1151
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:55,884
I'm around all these
very open-minded people,

1152
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:59,534
these artists and these
travelers all the time.

1153
01:00:59,569 --> 01:01:02,399
And I almost get
embarrassed, like,

1154
01:01:02,434 --> 01:01:05,967
that, you know,
I haven't been with a guy

1155
01:01:06,002 --> 01:01:08,751
or that my mind is
not open in that way.

1156
01:01:08,786 --> 01:01:11,501
I wasn't with this guy.
I just, you know...

1157
01:01:11,536 --> 01:01:13,299
- No, I'm not--
- just making--

1158
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:16,167
- I'm not saying that you were.
- I'm just making sure you know that.

1159
01:01:16,202 --> 01:01:19,033
No, I'm just saying
for me that, um...

1160
01:01:20,234 --> 01:01:22,167
( whispers )
Yeah.

1161
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,466
Dude, you're not gay.

1162
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:28,551
I don't think I'm gay.
I just thought--

1163
01:01:28,586 --> 01:01:31,566
No. I mean, you're
pretty solidly not gay.

1164
01:01:31,601 --> 01:01:34,267
I think-- yeah. I think the
same thing about you too.

1165
01:01:34,302 --> 01:01:35,866
I just-- I just--

1166
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:40,167
I wish I was more gay.
I feel like--

1167
01:01:40,202 --> 01:01:42,801
tomorrow would be
more fun.

1168
01:01:42,836 --> 01:01:45,818
( both laughing )

1169
01:01:45,853 --> 01:01:48,801
Oh, tomorrow.

1172

( sighs )

1173
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:54,432
How you doing?

1174
01:02:54,467 --> 01:02:57,868
It was a long night.

1175
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:00,033
Yeah.

1176
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:05,734
( sighs )
Okay, um...

1177
01:03:07,434 --> 01:03:11,234
I don't really
understand...

1178
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:13,601
why I want to do this.

1179
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:16,065
I just know

1180
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:20,000
that I feel pretty
deeply compelled.

1181
01:03:20,035 --> 01:03:22,332
Um...

1182
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:26,033
and the only way I can
think to explain it is like

1183
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:30,199
I have, you know,
different sides to me,

1184
01:03:30,234 --> 01:03:32,499
different sides to my
personality, you know?

1185
01:03:32,534 --> 01:03:36,501
And when we met, one of those sides in
particular really connected with you.

1186
01:03:36,536 --> 01:03:40,534
And it was exciting. And I was
excited to build a life with you

1187
01:03:40,569 --> 01:03:44,834
and to get married and buy
a house and have children.

1188
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:48,432
And that side swelled

1189
01:03:48,467 --> 01:03:51,367
and grew so big
that it became an ogre

1190
01:03:51,402 --> 01:03:54,267
and crushed all
the other sides to me.

1191
01:03:54,302 --> 01:03:56,599
And...

1192
01:03:56,634 --> 01:04:00,067
I think that's fine
in general.

1193
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,968
Actually,
you know what?

1194
01:04:03,434 --> 01:04:07,501
It's probably not fine,
because I'm here right now

1195
01:04:07,536 --> 01:04:10,300
wanting to do this and--

1196
01:04:12,467 --> 01:04:14,868
then you
should do it.

1197
01:04:19,567 --> 01:04:21,866
Really?

1198
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,834
<i>Yeah.</i>

1199
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:27,732
Are you serious?

1200
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,632
You know--
( scoffs )

1201
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:33,267
You talk about how you've got all
these other sides to your personality

1202
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:36,200
as though I'm a cardboard
cutout that, you know,

1203
01:04:36,235 --> 01:04:39,200
stands in the kitchen
and makes dinner.

1204
01:04:39,235 --> 01:04:42,098
There's just
as much to my world

1205
01:04:42,133 --> 01:04:45,232
that doesn't involve you
as there is to yours.

1206
01:04:45,267 --> 01:04:49,334
There are just as many parts of me
that aren't necessarily fed by this.

1207
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:52,267
Okay okay, that's fair.

1208
01:04:54,868 --> 01:04:56,801
Like what?

1209
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:06,167
( chuckles )
God.uh--

1210
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,132
( sighs )

1211
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,267
When I went back
to visit molly...

1212
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:19,100
um, about a year
and a half ago...

1213
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:25,199
we went to a party

1214
01:05:25,234 --> 01:05:29,567
that some of her friends were
having in this crazy loft thing.

1215
01:05:29,602 --> 01:05:32,299
And, um,

1216
01:05:32,334 --> 01:05:34,801
I had a lot
to drink...

1217
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:41,634
and I made out with
somebody in the bathroom.

1218
01:05:41,669 --> 01:05:43,701
( gasps )

1219
01:05:45,367 --> 01:05:48,868
And it was great.
( snickers )

1220
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,100
And, um...

1221
01:05:51,135 --> 01:05:52,732
I--

1222
01:05:52,767 --> 01:05:55,601
I was so happy
to come home

1223
01:05:55,636 --> 01:05:57,532
after that.

1224
01:05:57,567 --> 01:06:01,000
I just knew what I was
coming home to, you know?

1225
01:06:01,035 --> 01:06:03,717
And I knew
what I wanted.

1226
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:06,400
But you said
it was great.

1227
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:08,732
It was.it was.

1228
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,834
- It was great.
- Wow.

1229
01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:14,767
Wow.

1230
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:19,334
Um...
( sighs )

1231
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:21,365
Okay.

1232
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,100
All right.

1233
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,265
( stammers )

1234
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:32,400
It's like pistons firing
in my body are just prepared

1235
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:37,033
to give you one of my
classic guilt trips.

1236
01:06:37,068 --> 01:06:39,284
And...

1237
01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:41,426
um...

1238
01:06:41,461 --> 01:06:43,534
( sighs )

1239
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:49,100
I guess I can't
really say shit.

1240
01:06:49,135 --> 01:06:51,767
( both snicker )

1241
01:06:55,667 --> 01:06:58,732
I thought you were
just saying that

1242
01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:02,000
when you said there were other
sides to you. I didn't realize...

1243
01:07:02,035 --> 01:07:06,065
- wow.
- Look,

1244
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,333
I'm not going
to pretend to get

1245
01:07:08,368 --> 01:07:10,417
what this is
that you're after

1246
01:07:10,452 --> 01:07:12,432
with this whole
thing with Andrew.

1247
01:07:12,467 --> 01:07:14,901
I don't know that I'll
ever be able to understand.

1248
01:07:14,936 --> 01:07:16,766
I really want to
guilt you right now.

1249
01:07:16,801 --> 01:07:19,264
Shut up and just listen to
me for a minute, would you?

1250
01:07:19,265 --> 01:07:19,667
I really--

1251
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:20,965
- I just--
- ( softly ) fuck.

1252
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,998
And I know that it's
not the same thing,

1253
01:07:23,033 --> 01:07:27,033
but I feel like you
have to see this through

1254
01:07:27,068 --> 01:07:28,834
because I don't want
to live with you

1255
01:07:28,869 --> 01:07:31,334
with that
buried in you.

1256
01:07:32,701 --> 01:07:36,701
I just-- I need you
to get this out of you

1257
01:07:36,736 --> 01:07:38,933
or decide that it--

1258
01:07:38,968 --> 01:07:41,432
you know,
that it's bigger.

1259
01:07:41,467 --> 01:07:44,567
But I think that it's better
that you figure that out now

1260
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,567
before we have a baby.

1261
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,234

Hey.

- very beige.
- Yeah.

1279
01:10:40,185 --> 01:10:42,726
It's got
all the basics,

1280
01:10:42,761 --> 01:10:45,232
got all
the elements.

It's not exactly what
we envisioned, but...

about it another way,

1285
01:10:55,553 --> 01:10:58,399
- like straight-- just home--
- ( laughs )

1286
01:10:58,434 --> 01:11:01,160
It's like straight home movie.
Think about it though.

1287
01:11:01,161 --> 01:11:01,968
Yeah, it's like--

1288
01:11:02,003 --> 01:11:04,133
what this is about
is about two dudes--

1289
01:11:04,168 --> 01:11:06,599
it's like $5
Czechoslovakian porn.

1290
01:11:06,634 --> 01:11:08,532
It's like we don't
know how to make porn.

1291
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:10,734
We make it with this,
you know what I'm saying?

1292
01:11:10,769 --> 01:11:12,866
- Okay.
- So that's part of the slant though,

1293
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:13,718
which is like--

1294
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:16,167
I'm guessing you didn't
get me a star filter.

1295
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:19,051
I didn't get you a
star filter, but apparently

1296
01:11:19,086 --> 01:11:21,651
there's actually
effects inside of here.

1297
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:21,901
Okay.

1298
01:11:21,936 --> 01:11:23,998
Or we can put it
in iMovie

1299
01:11:24,033 --> 01:11:26,233
- and just do shit with it too.
- Awesome.

1300
01:11:26,268 --> 01:11:28,399
I don't know.
I'm thinking about this project

1301
01:11:28,434 --> 01:11:32,100
and I'm thinking about what makes this
really really interesting, you know?

1302
01:11:32,135 --> 01:11:35,151
And it was always the fact
that it was two dudes--

1303
01:11:35,186 --> 01:11:38,167
- two <i>straight</i> dudes boning.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1304
01:11:38,202 --> 01:11:40,632
- Okay?
- ( snickers )

1305
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:44,334
So how the fuck are they going to know
that we're straight unless we tell them?

1306
01:11:44,369 --> 01:11:46,566
Unless we, like,
you know--

1307
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:49,033
do like a testimonial
kind of thing?

1308
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:52,601
- <i>yeah.</i>
- That's what I'm talking about.

1309
01:11:52,636 --> 01:11:55,667
I mean, I do think
in all fairness that,

1310
01:11:55,702 --> 01:11:58,199
you know,

1311
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:01,634
if they look at me, they'll
kind of know that I'm straight.

1312
01:12:03,934 --> 01:12:07,132
Can I get you--
yep.

1313
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,434
- Here? Cool.
- Perfect. You're perfect.

1314
01:12:09,469 --> 01:12:11,067
All right,
we are recording.

1315
01:12:11,102 --> 01:12:13,098
- Yo.
- Yo.

1316
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:14,833
- I'm Ben.
- I'm Andrew.

1317
01:12:14,868 --> 01:12:17,023
And we're about to
make this movie here--

1318
01:12:17,024 --> 01:12:17,434
Our film.

1319
01:12:17,469 --> 01:12:19,632
Yeah, in a couple
of minutes.

1320
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:22,400
But we just want to tell
you a little about ourselves.

1321
01:12:22,435 --> 01:12:24,032
We're old friends
from college,

1322
01:12:24,067 --> 01:12:26,634
but we've kind of gone down
different roads in life.

1323
01:12:26,669 --> 01:12:29,098
Ben has become Mr. Motorcycle
- adventuring man.

1324
01:12:29,133 --> 01:12:32,901
I got married and have a really
nice house and a wife and stuff.

1325
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:35,732
Um, he came
to visit me two days ago

1326
01:12:35,767 --> 01:12:38,968
and we were out at a party
and we heard about Humpfest.

1327
01:12:39,003 --> 01:12:41,766
And, um, kind of
as a joke,

1328
01:12:41,801 --> 01:12:43,984
we thought it-- like,
how cool would it be

1329
01:12:44,019 --> 01:12:46,132
if two straight guys
had sex on camera?

1330
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:49,334
The funny thing was we were drunk
when we first came up with the idea

1331
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:52,566
and then it evolved into this
weirdly straight-guy macho thing

1332
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:55,680
where we're like, "No,
I'm more man, I'll fuck you."

1333
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:56,667
No, I'll fuck you.

1334
01:12:56,702 --> 01:12:58,901
- No, I'll fuck you.
- I'll fuck you. And then it kind of

1335
01:12:58,936 --> 01:13:00,965
transcended
into something more

1336
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,133
and we're still trying
to figure out what it is.

1337
01:13:04,168 --> 01:13:08,065
But we're here
and, um--

1338
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,466
I guess you'll see
what you see.

1339
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:13,968
We don't even know what you're going to
see because we haven't done it yet, so.

1340
01:13:16,734 --> 01:13:20,020
Cool, I liked it. I'm cool
with it if you are.

1341
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:20,300
Fine.

1342
01:13:20,335 --> 01:13:22,499
<i>So...</i>
<i>( snapping fingers )</i>

1343
01:13:22,534 --> 01:13:24,767
At some point we may want
to watch it back, but.

1344
01:13:24,802 --> 01:13:27,400
Yeah.
I'm good for now.

1345
01:13:27,435 --> 01:13:29,801
So... sweet!

1346
01:13:29,836 --> 01:13:31,968
Cool.

1347
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,701
- You know what?
- ( snickers )

1348
01:13:37,736 --> 01:13:39,732
It's--

1349
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:42,273
the fucking weirdness
is starting again.

1350
01:13:42,274 --> 01:13:42,701
Totally.

1351
01:13:42,736 --> 01:13:46,968
We need to not sit
around and talk about this

1352
01:13:47,003 --> 01:13:50,132
and we need
to just fucking--

1353
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:52,167
I think we just need
to start basically.

1354
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:54,132
And I'm going
to count to five

1355
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:57,400
and we're going to kiss and
we're just going to fucking do it.

1356
01:13:57,435 --> 01:14:00,434
Basically, I think if we
just get going, it's like--

1357
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:03,901
okay.let me just--
I'm going to piss.

1358
01:14:03,936 --> 01:14:05,532
Okay.

1359
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:07,567
All right.

1360
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:14,067
Mmm...

1361
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:18,365
hurry up!

1362
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,899
<i>( toilet flushes )</i>

1363
01:14:21,934 --> 01:14:24,601
- Andrew: All right. You ready?
- <i>You ready? Yep.</i>

1364
01:14:24,636 --> 01:14:26,801
- You ready? Ready?
- <i>I'm ready.</i> Five--

1365
01:14:26,836 --> 01:14:30,000
Both:
Four, three, two, one.

1366
01:14:34,501 --> 01:14:37,334
( sniffs, smacks )

1367
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:43,767
It wasn't that bad.

1368
01:14:43,802 --> 01:14:46,666
( laughs )

1369
01:14:46,701 --> 01:14:49,165
- Yeah, no, it-it--
- <i>I mean--</i>

1370
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:53,133
it's weird.
I've never kissed stubble before.

1371
01:14:53,168 --> 01:14:55,534
- Wasn't that bad.
- It wasn't terrible.

1372
01:14:55,569 --> 01:14:57,901
It wasn't terrible.
No, it wasn't terrible.

1373
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:03,400
- Yeah, that was awful.
- Dude, that was awful.

1374
01:15:03,435 --> 01:15:05,399
Okay, this is
going to be hard.

1375
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:08,801
Yeah, that puts a little
wrench in the works, doesn't it?

1376
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:13,467
We might have to impose
the "pretty woman" rule.

1377
01:15:13,502 --> 01:15:15,118
- No kissing.
- No kissing.

1378
01:15:15,153 --> 01:15:16,699
No kissing.
Okay, that's fine.

1379
01:15:16,734 --> 01:15:19,234
Actually, the intimacy of kissing
might be what makes it harder.

1380
01:15:19,269 --> 01:15:22,400
- We might just need to fucking--
- ( exhales )

1381
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,901
( blowing softly )

1382
01:15:24,936 --> 01:15:27,601
<i>Um...</i>

1383
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:32,199
fuck it!

1384
01:15:32,234 --> 01:15:33,866
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it,

1385
01:15:33,901 --> 01:15:36,133
fuck it, fuck it, fuck it,
fuck it, fuck it.

1386
01:15:36,168 --> 01:15:38,634
- All right. Fuck it.
- <i>cool.</i>

1387
01:15:38,669 --> 01:15:40,467
- <i>Fuck it.</i>
- Do it.

1388
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,699
- Fuck it.
- Go...

1389
01:15:42,734 --> 01:15:45,434
<i>still got it, baby, right here!</i>
<i>( smacks stomach )</i>

1390
01:15:45,469 --> 01:15:47,566
There's a six-pack
under there.

1391
01:15:47,601 --> 01:15:50,334
- Deep deep under there.
- <i>socks.</i>

1392
01:15:50,369 --> 01:15:53,032
- Socks!
- Socks!

1393
01:15:53,067 --> 01:15:54,834
- Right.
- <i>socks!</i>

1394
01:15:54,869 --> 01:15:56,901
( exhales )

1395
01:15:56,936 --> 01:15:58,934
Um...

1396
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,968
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- ( exhales )

1397
01:16:08,334 --> 01:16:10,267
All right.

1398
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,300
- Do it!
- Fuck!

1399
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:15,332
Do it!

1400
01:16:15,367 --> 01:16:17,466
All right, all right.

1401
01:16:17,501 --> 01:16:19,801
Dude, we've got almost
the same boxers on.

1402
01:16:19,836 --> 01:16:22,801
- Love it.
- ( groans )

1403
01:16:22,836 --> 01:16:24,599
Okay.

1404
01:16:24,634 --> 01:16:27,317
- <i>Good step. Good step.</i>
- ( slaps belly )

1405
01:16:27,352 --> 01:16:29,965
Can I just make an observation
for a second? Like--

1406
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,868
you're-- it's weird because
you're an attractive person.

1407
01:16:32,903 --> 01:16:35,268
I can see that. I could
see a girl looking at you

1408
01:16:35,303 --> 01:16:37,868
- and be like, "got a good-looking guy."
- Uh-huh?

1409
01:16:37,903 --> 01:16:40,434
Good build and stuff
like that. It just, um...

1410
01:16:42,133 --> 01:16:45,834
you think maybe we took
our clothes off too fast?

1411
01:16:47,467 --> 01:16:49,968
Just in terms of
kind of like...

1412
01:16:51,367 --> 01:16:53,868
- <i>I just feel like--</i>
- No, I think that's true.

1413
01:16:53,903 --> 01:16:56,501
- Ben: Okay.
- Yeah.

1414
01:16:56,536 --> 01:16:58,532
Okay.

1415
01:16:58,567 --> 01:17:01,900
I think it's important for us to keep
a hard line on each other tonight,

1416
01:17:01,935 --> 01:17:05,234
like it can be a lot of mental
trickery and I think one of the problems

1417
01:17:05,269 --> 01:17:07,767
- we're having is we're like... up here.
- In there.

1418
01:17:07,802 --> 01:17:09,799
As soon as we get up
here, it's like "whew!"

1419
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:13,601
Yeah yeah yeah. It's one of those things
that you just can't fucking think about.

1420
01:17:13,636 --> 01:17:16,934
We need to let bodies,
like, take over.

1421
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,232
Dude, I think
we kind of pussed out.

1422
01:17:24,267 --> 01:17:26,767
I mean, I think that if
we're going to do this,

1423
01:17:26,802 --> 01:17:28,734
if we're going
to <i>fucking</i> do it,

1424
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,365
then we've got
to get comfortable.

1425
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,965
- Ben: Right. We establish a rapport.
- We just have to go.

1426
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,534
I think you were right. We jumped in
quick, but I think part of that's just

1427
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:39,499
it's going to be fucking
uncomfortable

1428
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:43,534
and we've got to, like, we've
got to get through the discomfort.

1429
01:17:43,569 --> 01:17:45,751
You're right, we backed away.
You're right.

1430
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:47,934
So we need to just
fucking plunge forward

1431
01:17:47,969 --> 01:17:51,365
<i>and take the next step.</i>

1432
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,833
Can I suggest something
a little weird?

1433
01:17:53,868 --> 01:17:55,801
- <i>Yeah, absolutely.</i>
- I mean-- ( laughing )

1434
01:18:00,567 --> 01:18:02,599
- Yeah.
- Um,

1435
01:18:02,634 --> 01:18:06,133
can we try hugging without
shirts for a second?

1436
01:18:06,168 --> 01:18:07,968
Yeah.

1437
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:16,767
- Okay.
- Yep...

1438
01:18:18,334 --> 01:18:20,734
- okay.
- That's not terrible.

1439
01:18:20,769 --> 01:18:22,399
No.

1440
01:18:22,434 --> 01:18:24,599
It's almost like

1441
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:27,632
we saw each other
at a swimming pool

1442
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:30,067
- and hadn't seen each other for a while.
- Mm-hmm.

1443
01:18:30,102 --> 01:18:32,432
And so,

1444
01:18:32,467 --> 01:18:34,799
I mean, we're
basically like--

1445
01:18:34,834 --> 01:18:37,234
- these could be swimsuits, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

1446
01:18:37,269 --> 01:18:40,566
Just sharing a
particularly extended hug

1447
01:18:40,601 --> 01:18:41,832
at the local swimming pool.

1448
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:44,067
Yeah.and we're like,
"hey, dude, good to see you.

1449
01:18:44,102 --> 01:18:46,132
- What's up, man?"
- "How are you?

1450
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:48,934
- Nice to see you."yeah.
- "Yeah, you look good..."

1451
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,367
- that's great.
- Yeah.

1452
01:18:53,402 --> 01:18:55,300
Yeah.

1453
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,934
Yeah.

1454
01:19:01,234 --> 01:19:04,800
You know something we
have yet to discuss is,

1455
01:19:04,835 --> 01:19:08,367
- <i>um--</i>
- I know what you're going to say.

1456
01:19:08,402 --> 01:19:10,965
The-- yeah. Yeah.

1457
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,133
Yeah, dude,
I have no clue.

1458
01:19:13,168 --> 01:19:15,532
I have no fucking idea.

1459
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:18,834
I mean, the backup option
if nothing is happening

1460
01:19:18,869 --> 01:19:21,300
is like one of us is
in the bathroom, like,

1461
01:19:21,335 --> 01:19:23,332
kind of just
getting it up

1462
01:19:23,367 --> 01:19:26,132
and then they just
kind of run in and, like,

1463
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:29,868
<i>go while it's going.</i>
<i>Which sucks because it's like--</i>

1464
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:33,567
we can try that. I'm sure
that if I went in the bathroom,

1465
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:36,399
I could kind of get
myself revved up.

1466
01:19:36,434 --> 01:19:40,267
But I'm not sure when
I actually had to come,

1467
01:19:40,302 --> 01:19:42,884
you know, perform,

1468
01:19:42,919 --> 01:19:45,432
whether, you know,

1469
01:19:45,467 --> 01:19:47,633
whether I'd be able
to do the job or not.

1470
01:19:47,634 --> 01:19:48,200
<i>Yeah.</i>

1471
01:19:48,235 --> 01:19:50,234
<i>When you start</i>
<i>thinking about that,</i>

1472
01:19:50,269 --> 01:19:52,385
it's just like if
we're going to do this

1473
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,960
- it should be good, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

1474
01:19:54,995 --> 01:19:57,466
And it should be like
a piece of art.

1475
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:00,234
<i>And I mean-- so, yeah,</i>
<i>I guess I'm being-- I don't know.</i>

1476
01:20:00,269 --> 01:20:02,934
- <i>it should be--</i>
- I mean, I don't even know, like,

1477
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:05,499
art is such a--
you know,

1478
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:07,901
- art is such a fucking, like, "thing."
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1479
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,632
I just think-- I think
if we're going to do it,

1480
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:14,065
it has to be like a fucking
experience and not just like--

1481
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,694
not just like we're doing
it to get through it.

1482
01:20:16,695 --> 01:20:17,667
Close my eyes and--

1483
01:20:17,702 --> 01:20:20,068
- Yeah.
- It's got to be something that we do

1484
01:20:20,103 --> 01:20:22,434
- because, you know-- fuck!
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1485
01:20:22,469 --> 01:20:24,365
Like--

1486
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,132
like we didn't think we could
do it and we fucking did it.

1487
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:31,601
And I don't know how to actually get
there and that's the tricky thing.

1488
01:20:31,636 --> 01:20:33,599
You know, it's the
difference between this

1489
01:20:33,634 --> 01:20:35,799
- and fucking bungee jumping, dude...
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1490
01:20:35,834 --> 01:20:38,934
...is that bungee jumping, you just
walk to the edge and fucking jump.

1491
01:20:38,969 --> 01:20:41,285
<i>And then the whole thing</i>
<i>takes care of you.</i>

1492
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,601
And you don't have to have a
fucking hard-on to bungee jump.

1493
01:20:43,636 --> 01:20:46,067
Yeah.
( slapping thighs )

1494
01:20:46,102 --> 01:20:47,901
This is hard.

1495
01:20:49,267 --> 01:20:53,534
- So here's where I'm at...
- Okay.

1496
01:20:53,569 --> 01:20:55,766
..I don't want
to be a pussy.

1497
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:58,234
I don't want to chicken out
on this, all right?

1498
01:20:58,269 --> 01:21:02,267
But I can't help
thinking...

1499
01:21:03,334 --> 01:21:05,532
what exactly...

1500
01:21:05,567 --> 01:21:09,968
about two straight dudes
having sex on camera

1501
01:21:10,003 --> 01:21:13,100
is a great piece of art?

1502
01:21:14,601 --> 01:21:16,534
And not to overanalyze it
or anything,

1503
01:21:16,569 --> 01:21:18,434
'cause art is
a feeling thing

1504
01:21:18,469 --> 01:21:20,265
and it's not
a thinking thing,

1505
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:24,501
but, like, I'm just starting
to kind of look at it

1506
01:21:24,536 --> 01:21:26,434
and I'm like...

1507
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:33,033
you know
what I'm saying?

1508
01:21:33,068 --> 01:21:34,666
( snickers )

1509
01:21:34,701 --> 01:21:36,666
And we should be
really careful here

1510
01:21:36,701 --> 01:21:39,267
because we don't want to
let each other off the hook.

1511
01:21:39,302 --> 01:21:41,701
No, but what's
interesting about it is

1512
01:21:41,736 --> 01:21:43,699
I think--

1513
01:21:43,734 --> 01:21:45,532
you know, and again,

1514
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,866
I'm not--
I'm not saying

1515
01:21:47,901 --> 01:21:50,486
let's run away from it.
Let's shitcan the idea.

1516
01:21:50,487 --> 01:21:50,701
Yeah.

1517
01:21:50,736 --> 01:21:53,532
But-- but...

1518
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:56,656
the fact that we picked
this as this hurdle...

1519
01:21:56,657 --> 01:21:57,050
Mm-hmm.

1520
01:21:57,085 --> 01:22:00,499
Was almost arbitrary. It was
almost like it kind of came up--

1521
01:22:00,534 --> 01:22:02,724
in this drunken moment
and we went with it.

1522
01:22:02,725 --> 01:22:03,968
It could've been anything.

1523
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:06,033
It seriously could have
been fucking anything.

1524
01:22:06,068 --> 01:22:07,799
It could've been
fucking anything.

1525
01:22:07,834 --> 01:22:10,032
- It could've been bungee jumping.
- Yeah! Right.

1526
01:22:10,067 --> 01:22:12,400
It would have to be a little
more momentous than that, but--

1527
01:22:12,435 --> 01:22:14,466
like hiking across Bhutan
or something like that.

1528
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:17,300
It's weird. And when you say
something like "hiking across Bhutan,"

1529
01:22:17,335 --> 01:22:19,451
I don't even know what
that is, but I know that

1530
01:22:19,486 --> 01:22:21,532
- in the experience of doing that...
- Mm-hmm.

1531
01:22:21,567 --> 01:22:24,400
We would probably enrich
our lives actually a lot more

1532
01:22:24,435 --> 01:22:26,332
than just trying

1533
01:22:26,367 --> 01:22:29,332
to fucking tag ass
in a hotel room...

1534
01:22:29,367 --> 01:22:30,154
( Andrew laughs )

1535
01:22:30,155 --> 01:22:32,100
...and force it.
You know what I'm saying?

1536
01:22:32,135 --> 01:22:34,801
We would get exercise.
We would have good conversations.

1537
01:22:34,836 --> 01:22:37,234
We'd get to know each other.
We'd meet weird people.

1538
01:22:37,269 --> 01:22:39,232
We'd eat new foods,

1539
01:22:39,267 --> 01:22:42,400
- be in a different surrounding.
- Dude, we're fucking...

1540
01:22:42,435 --> 01:22:45,901
we're pussing out.
Are we pussing out?

1541
01:22:45,936 --> 01:22:49,965
We're doing this
because...

1542
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,033
it scares us more
than anything else.

1543
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:56,067
I'd be pretty amped
to go to Bhutan

1544
01:22:56,102 --> 01:22:58,801
and not
particularly scared.

1545
01:22:58,836 --> 01:23:01,466
That is a really
good point.

1546
01:23:01,501 --> 01:23:06,467
There is nothing
in this world...

1547
01:23:06,502 --> 01:23:09,899
that I want to do less

1548
01:23:09,934 --> 01:23:12,601
than what we're
talking about doing.

1549
01:23:12,636 --> 01:23:14,566
( snickers )

1550
01:23:14,601 --> 01:23:18,434
I mean, that's something.
That's something.

1551
01:23:18,469 --> 01:23:21,501
So I guess
the question is

1552
01:23:21,536 --> 01:23:23,833
is--

1553
01:23:23,868 --> 01:23:26,400
is that a reason
to go through with it?

1554
01:23:44,067 --> 01:23:48,267
- ( sighs ) Something just hit me.
- <i>Mm-hmm?</i>

1555
01:23:51,734 --> 01:23:53,667
I think...

1556
01:23:54,734 --> 01:23:56,834
we might be morons.

1557
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:05,534
That this whole
fucking idea...

1558
01:24:07,267 --> 01:24:10,098
is built
from the planet moron,

1559
01:24:10,133 --> 01:24:13,801
- <i>like--</i>
- but with the best of intentions.

1560
01:24:13,836 --> 01:24:16,352
Great intentions, dude.
Great intentions,

1561
01:24:16,387 --> 01:24:18,833
- but, like, clearly--
- <i>( laughs )</i>

1562
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:22,100
<i>Clearly, there are other places
to put this kind of energy.</i>

1563
01:24:22,135 --> 01:24:26,467
I mean, here's the thing.
For me, it's, um,

1564
01:24:29,534 --> 01:24:32,899
you know, I just want to
fucking finish something.

1565
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:33,178
Yes.

1566
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:36,232
And this was the thing
that I was, like, you know,

1567
01:24:36,267 --> 01:24:40,534
"I'm finally going to do it. Like, I'm finally
going to fucking see something through

1568
01:24:40,569 --> 01:24:43,234
- and finish it" and--
- You chose the wrong thing.

1569
01:24:43,269 --> 01:24:45,199
( both laugh )

1570
01:24:45,234 --> 01:24:48,501
And I could've chosen
something much more awesome.

1571
01:24:48,536 --> 01:24:50,634
<i>Dude, I mean--</i>
<i>Um...</i>

1572
01:24:57,267 --> 01:24:59,133
( chuckles )

1573
01:24:59,168 --> 01:25:00,968
Man.

1574
01:25:02,968 --> 01:25:06,567
- Can I just say something here?
- Mm-hmm.

1575
01:25:07,868 --> 01:25:09,833
And if you don't agree,
that's fine,

1576
01:25:09,868 --> 01:25:12,901
but I just want to throw it
out there and test the waters.

1577
01:25:16,434 --> 01:25:19,367
I think we should
put on our clothes.

1578
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:51,100
( sighs )

1579
01:26:15,767 --> 01:26:18,100
( snickers )

1580
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:21,532
( snickers )

1581
01:26:21,567 --> 01:26:24,501
( both laughing )

1582
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:30,334
( groans )

1583
01:26:31,601 --> 01:26:33,732
Ben:
<i>You want to--</i>

1584
01:26:33,767 --> 01:26:36,332
you want to get
some room service?

1585
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:39,801
Yeah. Hey there, I'd like to
order room service, please?

1586
01:26:39,836 --> 01:26:44,067
Um, two steak sandwiches.
Do you have milkshakes?

1587
01:26:44,102 --> 01:26:46,168
I would like one
strawberry milkshake

1588
01:26:46,203 --> 01:26:48,151
- and--
- Chocolate-strawberry mix.

1589
01:26:48,186 --> 01:26:50,100
And a chocolate-
strawberry mix.

1590
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,267
- ( Andrew laughs )
- Still got it.

1591
01:27:26,302 --> 01:27:29,467
- Still got it.
- Oh.

1592
01:27:29,502 --> 01:27:31,968
Yeah.

1593
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,734
Man...

1594
01:27:58,534 --> 01:28:02,501
I think I'm in deep shit with Anna.
( laughs )

1595
01:28:02,536 --> 01:28:06,033
- I think I'm in really deep, man.
- Why?

1596
01:28:06,068 --> 01:28:08,734
I fucking dug
my own grave, man.

1597
01:28:08,769 --> 01:28:11,551
Jesus, what I just
put her through.

1598
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:14,334
Poor thing.
I feel so terrible.

1599
01:28:16,367 --> 01:28:18,132
Yeah.

1600
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:22,934
I am so lucky that
she puts up with me.

1601
01:28:25,501 --> 01:28:27,499
She loves you.

1602
01:28:27,534 --> 01:28:31,632
Yeah.I hate
to say it, dude,

1603
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:33,666
but I think I need
to go fucking--

1604
01:28:33,701 --> 01:28:37,067
( laughs )
I might need to go start my reparations

1605
01:28:37,102 --> 01:28:38,699
immediately.

1606
01:28:38,734 --> 01:28:41,868
As much as I want a steak
sandwich and a milkshake,

1607
01:28:41,903 --> 01:28:44,968
I think I actually
might have to go...

1608
01:28:45,003 --> 01:28:49,100
um, I might have
to go see her.

1609
01:28:50,868 --> 01:28:52,868
- Totally.
- You know what I'm saying?

1610
01:28:52,903 --> 01:28:54,801
Fuck yeah.

1611
01:28:57,868 --> 01:28:59,868
But, dude, fucking
live it up here

1612
01:28:59,903 --> 01:29:02,098
and munch my shit

1613
01:29:02,133 --> 01:29:04,165
and drink my milkshake

1614
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,467
and charge whatever the
fuck you want to the room

1615
01:29:06,502 --> 01:29:10,067
- and put 'em up.
- <i>Mm.</i>

1616
01:29:10,102 --> 01:29:12,000
Give it up, man.

1617
01:29:18,434 --> 01:29:20,800
I love you, bud.

1618
01:29:20,835 --> 01:29:23,167
I love you too, man.

1619
01:29:27,567 --> 01:29:31,234
All right, I'll see you
tomorrow, okay?

1620
01:29:31,269 --> 01:29:34,866
Pick you up, we'll go
do something stupid.

1621
01:29:34,901 --> 01:29:37,634
<i>Not this stupid.</i>
<i>Something stupid,</i>

1622
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:40,300
something fun,
all right?

1623
01:29:59,467 --> 01:30:01,400

1624
01:30:43,033 --> 01:30:45,267

- <i>No.</i>

1627
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:07,866
<i>It's almost like</i>

1628
01:31:07,901 --> 01:31:10,232
<i>we saw each other</i>
<i>at a swimming pool</i>

1629
01:31:10,267 --> 01:31:12,834
<i>and hadn't seen each other
for a while, you know?</i>

1630
01:31:12,869 --> 01:31:14,868
- Andrew: <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- <i>And so,</i>

1631
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:16,833
<i>I mean, we're</i>
<i>basically like--</i>

1632
01:31:16,868 --> 01:31:18,801
<i>these could be</i>
<i>swimsuits, you know?</i>
