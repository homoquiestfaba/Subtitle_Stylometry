1
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,862
Please. Please.
Please, no.

2
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:31,007
Please. Please.

3
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:45,554
No. Please. Please.
Please. Please don't.

4
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:48,892
Please.
No, no, please.

5
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,327
Don't-- don't do that!

6
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,404
Please, John,
just let me talk to him. Okay?

7
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:02,638
<i>Absolutely fucking not.</i>

8
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,740
Come on.
It's been months.

9
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:06,276
-You don't even care, do you?
-I care.

10
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:08,411
I care.
What do you think I'm--

11
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,046
-No, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

12
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,248
No, that's part of
what I'm talking about. Okay?

13
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:15,285
The only person that
matters to Rachel is Rachel.

14
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,654
Where is it? Hmm?

15
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:21,191
Give it to me now.

16
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:22,658
Oh, is this
where we are going?

17
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,061
Yeah.

18
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:29,665
Okay. Slow it down there.

19
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,135
You know what?

20
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:36,539
You are such
a fucking pussy.

21
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:38,374
Baby, come on.
Why would I--

22
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:40,776
You're a whore not a thief.
Give me the fucking ring now.

23
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,445
- <i>No.</i>
- Yeah.

24
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,847
Well, I am his mother, okay?
And he's my only baby.

25
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:46,682
<i>You had your chance.</i>
<i>You fucked it up.</i>

26
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:50,719
That is not fair. And that--
and you know that's not true.

27
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:55,024
Nothing? I'm walking out
right now, you got nothing?

28
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:57,860
Let me see this purse.
Give me this-- ow!

29
00:03:57,994 --> 00:03:59,395
You wanna hit, huh?

30
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:02,932
I paid you to leave,
not to steal my shit.

31
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,069
I said slow it down.

32
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,837
I'm not a fucking whore.

33
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:11,207
Dude, what the fuck?
Come on.

34
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:15,844
So you know what?
You pay for it for once.

35
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,315
<i>You're a fucking psycho.</i>

36
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,417
<i>-You're a fucking psycho.</i>
<i>-Stay out.</i>

37
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:23,319
<i>Don't ever</i>
<i>fucking call me again.</i>

38
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,421
<i>You're such</i>
<i>a fucking psycho.</i>

39
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:27,557
<i>And you know something, you're</i>
<i>not gonna bring her back,</i>

40
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:30,293
<i>and it's your fucking fault</i>
<i>you drunk piece of shit.</i>

41
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,129
<i>Keep walking.</i>

42
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:34,364
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>I was just playing around.</i>

43
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:35,664
<i>Fuck you.</i>

44
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:36,765
<i>Jojo, good, copy.</i>

45
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,468
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

46
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,537
<i>JoJo.</i>
<i>This is Stalker Two.</i>

47
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:44,107
<i>Standing by for timeline.</i>
<i>All copy? Over.</i>

48
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,610
<i>Stalker Two, solid copy.</i>

49
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,513
<i>Stand by for Stalker One.</i>

50
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:53,550
, <i>go.</i>
<i>Stay frosty, motherfuckers.</i>

51
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:56,119
<i>Proceed with plan.</i>

52
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:58,321
<i>Stalker Two, roger that.</i>

53
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:22,378
General Santiago
is calling in, sir.

54
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:24,414
Patch him in.

55
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:27,716
General Santiago,
Colonel Roake reporting.

56
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:28,918
<i>At ease Colonel.</i>

57
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,453
<i>Status report?</i>

58
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:33,122
Sir, I have five fresh
new assignments inbound

59
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:35,291
and Chief Woodman
is en route.

60
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:36,758
<i>Copy. ETA?</i>

61
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:38,695
Five mikes, sir.

62
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:40,463
<i>Is that Israeli</i>
<i>bitch there yet?</i>

63
00:05:41,197 --> 00:05:43,832
Thank you
for the compliment.

64
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,602
<i>- Wasn't a compliment.</i>
- No?

65
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:48,538
Where I come from, if you're
referred to as a bitch

66
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,273
means you're doing your job.

67
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:52,008
<i>Then</i>
<i>you should get a promotion.</i>

68
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:53,643
<i>Just stay the fuck</i>
<i>out of the way.</i>

69
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:56,045
<i>You've done your part.</i>
<i>Now let us do ours.</i>

70
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:58,780
We'll do the right thing
at whatever cost.

71
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:01,783
<i>Keep me posted,</i>
<i>Colonel Roake.</i>

72
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:04,087
Copy that, sir.

73
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,322
<i>I hand-picked you</i>
<i>for this program. You get it?</i>

74
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:10,360
<i>Don't drop the ball</i>
<i>on me now.</i>

75
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:13,096
<i>Too close</i>
<i>to the finish line.</i>

76
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:14,964
<i>I want a status report</i>
<i>in 48 hours</i>

77
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:17,133
<i>and a clinical eval</i>
<i>on Woodman post hunt.</i>

78
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,135
Understood.

79
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:21,004
<i>This man in particular</i>

80
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:24,407
<i>is of special interest to us,</i>
<i>Marcus Woodman.</i>

81
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,276
<i>You do well for him,</i>

82
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:28,144
<i>there may be</i>
<i>a brigadier general spot</i>

83
00:06:28,278 --> 00:06:30,046
<i>in our covert ops unit</i>
<i>here in Washington.</i>

84
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,780
I know the stakes.

85
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:34,317
<i>Good. Carry on.</i>

86
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:39,989
Great day.

87
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:49,332
Woodman's transport
is ten minutes out, sir.

88
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:50,900
I want you
to keep an eye on it.

89
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:10,653
<i>You're gonna love it.</i>
<i>Trust me.</i>

90
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:14,490
Okay. Now I know that you said
you don't wanna do anything,

91
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:15,958
but...

92
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,328
here you go.

93
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:23,499
Stop.

94
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:24,967
<i>Blue Jay 1, out copy, over.</i>

95
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:26,402
Babe, you okay?

96
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:29,205
-Babe.
-Get--

97
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,673
-Babe, it's just a present.
-Just get away.

98
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:32,408
-Babe.
-Jess, get away.

99
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:34,477
-Get away. Get away. Get out.
-Babe? Marcus!

100
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,646
Just get out.
Get out. Get out.

101
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,047
<i>It's just a box, Marcus.</i>

102
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,782
<i>Marcus, please,</i>
<i>it's just a box.</i>

103
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,284
<i>Get out!</i>

104
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,752
<i>Please. Please, calm down.</i>

105
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:44,487
<i>Please, make it stop.</i>

106
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,557
<i>Please, it's just a box.</i>

107
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,026
<i>Please, calm down. Please.</i>

108
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,829
- Sir.
- Top, come in.

109
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:55,264
-Thank you, sir.
-I called you here

110
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:57,400
because I wanna talk to you
about our new recruit.

111
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,203
We really need this one.

112
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:02,372
Washington
is telling us that

113
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:05,007
if we pull this off
without a glitch...

114
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:07,510
we get fully funded.

115
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:09,445
Dream come true, sir.

116
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,381
That it is.

117
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:20,490
We pulled all the footage from
various devices in the home.

118
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:25,228
Senior Chief Marcus Woodman.

119
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:28,064
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

120
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:29,766
Uh, it's my husband.

121
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,367
He has locked himself
in the bathroom with his gun.

122
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:33,936
Please help.

123
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,638
Marcus.

124
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,907
No, I don't know.

125
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,876
I mean, he's talking
but not to me.

126
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:43,713
Marcus, please.
Just come out baby. Please.

127
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,917
I know you're in there.
Come back to me.

128
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:51,988
I need you, Marcus.
I want you.

129
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:57,760
Marcus. Marcus. Marcus.

130
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,333
<i>Never scare me</i>
<i>like that again, please, babe.</i>

131
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:06,969
Sir, it's hard to believe
all those stories.

132
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,373
Yeah, well you better believe
them 'cause they're all true.

133
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:14,444
Behavioral avoidance
can happen to the best of them.

134
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:17,980
The man spent
the last four months

135
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:19,982
at AMACORP's
Prime Psych Facility

136
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:24,287
being probed and tested
and evaluated.

137
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:26,956
Voodoo bullshit
if you ask me.

138
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,426
Now, it's up to us to
get him back in the saddle...

139
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:32,695
for Ghost.

140
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:34,898
Ghost Recon.

141
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:36,365
Exactly.

142
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:39,101
Never met anyone up
for that.

143
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:44,507
And Top,
you and I we pull this off,

144
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,210
it's gonna be
a huge win for both of us.

145
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:50,213
Sir, he's arrived.
Would you like him here?

146
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,982
- That's fine.
- Sir.

147
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,902
Damn! I'm good.

148
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:15,104
I mean, it was okay.

149
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:18,241
I mean, just five out of
five cans okay or was it--

150
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:20,877
-Easy.
-I got it. It's okay.

151
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,778
I know, I just--

152
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,714
Uh...

153
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,385
Anyway, do you wanna go set
the cans back up or?

154
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,187
Yeah. For you.

155
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:34,023
Oh, no, I'm not really
feeling it today.

156
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,361
Look, if you don't
wanna talk about it,

157
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:40,496
you don't have to,
but you can.

158
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:48,437
I don't know.

159
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:54,644
I just, uh...

160
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:03,419
it's like doing good
doesn't feel good anymore.

161
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:08,791
Like the right thing
became the wrong thing...

162
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,761
if that makes any sense.

163
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,098
I mean,
if it makes sense to you,

164
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:17,466
then that's all that matters.

165
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,069
And maybe you could
go to that place

166
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:23,139
and you could talk to somebody
and maybe they'll understand.

167
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:25,441
Hmm.

168
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:29,178
Either way.
I'm here for you.

169
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,149
You got this.

170
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,667
The wife?

171
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:55,871
She passed away unfortunately
a while after he got out.

172
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:58,307
I think it's why
he joined the program.

173
00:11:58,441 --> 00:11:59,943
Nothing left
for him at home.

174
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:02,678
That's tough stuff
right there.

175
00:12:04,513 --> 00:12:05,815
Yeah, it is.

176
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,554
Is he on board?

177
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:12,722
He will be.

178
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,790
Once he sees
it's not about him,

179
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:17,593
it's about the men and women
who will come after him.

180
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:19,228
He is a soldier.

181
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:22,732
He's not just any soldier.

182
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,369
The man
is an exceptional Navy Seal.

183
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:29,705
This is the fast track
back to where he belongs.

184
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:06,509
-Hey, I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

185
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:08,377
Yeah.

186
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:10,312
You go deal with your friends.
They're here for you.

187
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:11,915
I'm here for you.

188
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,017
Thanks.

189
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,092
Mind if I
hang out over here?

190
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:23,693
Mingling is not
really my thing.

191
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:25,528
Sure, I'm just
flipping these burgers

192
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:26,963
pretending like I know
what I'm doing.

193
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,198
Honestly, I like it.

194
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:30,733
Greg.

195
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,136
Marcus, nice to meet you.

196
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,570
Like the poet king.

197
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:36,672
-Or the assassin.
-Oh, yeah.

198
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:38,541
Depends on
how you look at it I guess.

199
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:40,476
That's true.

200
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:44,280
Thanks for not
saying that.

201
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,848
Saying what?

202
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,249
Uh, when people meet me,

203
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:48,551
they usually can't wait
to get it out.

204
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:50,187
Thank you
for your service.

205
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:52,189
Uh, yeah.
You guys don't like that.

206
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:53,957
And I don't blame you.

207
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:55,992
I think living a good life
is the best thanks I can give.

208
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:57,526
Exactly.

209
00:13:58,627 --> 00:13:59,963
Jess said
you're getting out?

210
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:02,598
That's the plan.

211
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:33,662
Took you long enough.

212
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,765
What's that?

213
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:37,366
To get here.

214
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,802
Car trouble?

215
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:43,506
I'll drive next time.

216
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,307
Shit.

217
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:47,376
Heard about your wife.

218
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:51,214
She's why I'm here.

219
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:52,916
I never picked
one up along the way.

220
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:55,018
It's too much to carry.

221
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,653
-We ready to go?
-You know that mission.

222
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,024
Is it true?

223
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,458
What's it to you, man?

224
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:06,796
It's just,
you know, over 200 kills.

225
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,999
You go on
a Rambo and shit.

226
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:12,802
And then, of course, you had
to put down your own objective.

227
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:16,973
It's too wounded
to move so they say.

228
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:21,777
So they say.

229
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,914
You know, that's the thing
about Lone Survivor missions.

230
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:28,285
It's only ever one version
of the story, yours.

231
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,785
Ops aren't always clean.

232
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,654
Oh, I'm not afraid
to get my hands dirty.

233
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:34,057
I can see that.

234
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:40,297
You know, the most
dangerous animal in the world,

235
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:41,831
it's a desperate one.

236
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:46,569
Had a mission like
yours once, Siberia,

237
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:48,470
three days
in the mountains.

238
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:51,674
Snowstorm.
Signal was shit.

239
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,810
Intel was wrong,
like usual.

240
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:59,082
We were hurt,
bleeding bad, no ammo.

241
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:01,584
The forest was too thick
to land anything in.

242
00:16:01,717 --> 00:16:03,419
So we had to climb
to elevation.

243
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:07,023
Snow you've never seen
in your fucking life.

244
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:10,894
About 15 hours in
we start getting tracked

245
00:16:11,027 --> 00:16:12,361
by a pack of wolves.

246
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,298
Wolves.

247
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:17,566
It doesn't happen
like you think.

248
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:20,136
They don't come fast,
they wait.

249
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:23,873
They stalk you.
They scout ahead.

250
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:27,543
They find the perfect
ground to attack.

251
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,145
Just like us.

252
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:33,883
My team and I, we took
a stand and we waited.

253
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,253
Those wolves knew
what it was too.

254
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,990
'Cause here comes the biggest
motherfucker they got.

255
00:16:40,556 --> 00:16:44,627
Gray, this black chest...

256
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,396
these big yellow eyes.

257
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,267
I knew when
I saw that motherfucker

258
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,970
a sacrifice would have
to be made one way or another.

259
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:57,073
I let him get close.

260
00:16:58,074 --> 00:16:59,808
And when he launched
I stuck my hand

261
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:03,246
in that motherfuckers mouth
and I pulled him close.

262
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:06,582
I was the last thing
he ever saw.

263
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:11,922
So I'm still breathing
and he's not.

264
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:14,391
-Lucky for you.
-You know,

265
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:16,092
they talk like
you're some big hero.

266
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,897
Well, my team is still alive,
your guy isn't.

267
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:25,101
<i>Claver, ready for Woodman.</i>

268
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:29,039
Time to let
the dog off the leash.

269
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:34,743
You're wrong.

270
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,545
How's that?

271
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:40,984
The most dangerous animal,
it isn't the desperate one.

272
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:44,687
It's one
with nothing to lose.

273
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,226
Ready?
One, two.

274
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:29,498
I'll get him back to you

275
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:31,067
after I debrief him.

276
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,203
Top, take care of him.
Will you?

277
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:35,771
Copy that sir.

278
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:38,174
Thank you.

279
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:40,210
Chief.

280
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:44,880
I'm Colonel Roake.

281
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:47,117
Good to meet you, son.

282
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:49,953
Come on in.

283
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:01,730
<i>Welcome to the new</i>

284
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:03,366

285

How you doing, son?

289
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:41,703
Fine.
Just ready to go.

290
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:44,240
-You packed and strapped?
-Of course.

291
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:46,142
Checked it twice
like I have been trained to.

292
00:19:46,976 --> 00:19:48,644
-Stay alert.
-Stay alive.

293
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,649
You know,
nerves are good.

294
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,453
-Keeps you sharp.
-I'm not nervous.

295
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,089
Hey, Top,
you mind if I have a word?

296
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:03,259
Yeah.

297
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:11,067
So, Marcus Woodman?

298
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,070
Yeah.

299
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,507
To be honest.

300
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:18,607
I've heard some
wild ass shit about him.

301
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,443
Hmm.
I hear ya.

302
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:23,679
But we're the only ones who
can relate to this man, right?

303
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:27,417
Like him or not,
he's one of ours.

304
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,851
He's not one of mine.

305
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:32,654
You kill one of our own,
there's no excuse. Not for me.

306
00:20:35,225 --> 00:20:36,359
Yeah.

307
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,161
Hey.

308
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:42,565
- Hey.
- Hello.

309
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:45,001
- Hey.
- Hello.

310
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:47,370
Help.

311
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:52,142
Oh, God. Help.
Help me. Help me, please.

312
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,377
Please.
Please, get me out of here.

313
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:58,548
Please. Please. Please.

314
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:00,550
Why does my head hurt?

315
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:01,918
Please help me out of here.
Please.

316
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,852
I don't fucking know.

317
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:05,221
I didn't do anything, please.

318
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:06,755
Just calm down. Just calm down.

319
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,024
Shut up, bitch!

320
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:09,791
Please, somebody help.

321
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:12,095
Help!
Hey! Somebody!

322
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,330
Let me out!

323
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:16,966
It was just me
and my boyfriend

324
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,800
and we were having dinner
and then, uh--

325
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:22,671
Yeah, let-- let's start to--
I-- I was out at the bar.

326
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:24,407
Yo, I don't remember shit.

327
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,911
I-- I had just--
I was coming home from work.

328
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:29,412
Let me out!

329
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:31,047
Let me out! Let me out!

330
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,714
- Keep it down, man.
- We're being watched.

331
00:21:32,848 --> 00:21:34,050
What?

332
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:35,851
Look, we're being watched.

333
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:38,555
We're being watched.
Look there. Look. Look.

334
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:41,658
Somebody,
anybody, let me out now.

335
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,261
Help us!
Hello! Help!

336
00:21:55,438 --> 00:21:57,140
What number hunt
is this for you?

337
00:21:58,374 --> 00:22:00,343
I don't know.
A few dozen.

338
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:04,746
And, um, how has your home life
been since treatment?

339
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:07,283
Excellent, honestly.

340
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:09,452
Professionally?

341
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:12,888
Better than ever.

342
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:17,093
So don't you think
it would be fair

343
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:19,929
if we give this man
the same chances we gave you?

344
00:22:28,737 --> 00:22:30,373
Yeah, you're right.

345
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:33,910
I just had
to say something.

346
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,845
Woodman will mainly be
with me and Junior today

347
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,514
I'll keep
an eye on him.

348
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:42,784
How's the little
dumb dumb doing?

349
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:46,855
He's wound a little
tight right now,

350
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,391
but that's how it goes.

351
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:51,894
His results will come
once he's been in the hot seat.

352
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:54,763
Then we'll see if this
is preventative as well.

353
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:06,376
The fuck are you?

354
00:23:09,746 --> 00:23:11,180
What the fuck?
Get off me.

355
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:13,283
Hey, hey.
Fuck you man.

356
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:17,053
Seriously?
Answer me. Hey, hey.

357
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:21,790
Don't fucking care.

358
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:27,463
Help me.

359
00:23:45,281 --> 00:23:46,815
Can you just
tell me what's going on?

360
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:48,785
What's going on?

361
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:50,553
Person to person, please.

362
00:23:54,757 --> 00:23:56,192
They are ready.

363
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:05,168
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>the Stalking Fields Program</i>

364
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:07,103
<i>for which</i>
<i>you've been selected.</i>

365
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:09,205
<i>I'm sure many</i>
<i>of you have questions,</i>

366
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,474
<i>but now is not the time.</i>

367
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:13,343
What the fuck?

368
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:16,079
<i>We here,</i>
<i>along with the US military,</i>

369
00:24:16,212 --> 00:24:18,847
<i>are part of a brand new</i>
<i>treatment program.</i>

370
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:21,217
<i>Experimental.</i>
<i>And it's working.</i>

371
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:22,618
Okay.

372
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,320
<i>The program's trying</i>
<i>to bring our best</i>

373
00:24:24,454 --> 00:24:26,656
<i>and bravest soldiers</i>
<i>back into fight.</i>

374
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:28,825
What are you
talking about?

375
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:33,029
<i>I'm talking about serving</i>
<i>those who have served you.</i>

376
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:35,431
<i>Giving you an opportunity</i>
<i>for a good life,</i>

377
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:38,468
<i>an opportunity</i>
<i>that none of you took.</i>

378
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:41,804
<i>The program will start</i>
<i>16 minutes after your release.</i>

379
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,907
<i>Here is where I'm sure</i>
<i>you will have many questions.</i>

380
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,542
I just wanna go home.

381
00:24:46,676 --> 00:24:48,244
No, no, no. You have--
you have the wrong people.

382
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:51,080
Okay. I haven't done
anything wrong. Please.

383
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:55,118
<i>You see,</i>
<i>there are no accidents.</i>

384
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:58,921
<i>Each of you,</i>
<i>you're all here for a reason.</i>

385
00:24:59,055 --> 00:25:00,757
<i>Rachel, for instance,</i>

386
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:02,859
<i>embezzlement</i>
<i>of your own family business</i>

387
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,894
<i>a fraud of $3 million.</i>

388
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:06,629
- Hey.
<i>- Lance,</i>

389
00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:09,365
<i>DUI, aggravated assault,</i>
<i>manslaughter.</i>

390
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:11,267
<i>-Wow.</i>
-Fuck this and fuck you.

391
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:12,735
This is deranged.

392
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:15,371
<i>Sara, another addict</i>

393
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:17,006
<i>whose child</i>
<i>is taken from her.</i>

394
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,442
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I could go on, shall I?</i>

395
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:22,011
<i>None of you here</i>
<i>are special.</i>

396
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,448
<i>But you have</i>
<i>a chance to be.</i>

397
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:30,052
<i>A chance to reclaim</i>
<i>your life, fresh start.</i>

398
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:32,822
<i>Participate and survive,</i>

399
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:35,057
<i>each of you will earn</i>
<i>your own identity,</i>

400
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:38,194
<i>$500,000, and passage</i>
<i>to anywhere inside</i>

401
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:39,897
<i>the US</i>
<i>that you choose.</i>

402
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:41,899
Hey, what
the fuck does that mean?

403
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:46,602
What if we say, "Fuck this,
fuck you," and don't do shit?

404
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:50,373
<i>Well, I should tell you</i>
<i>that each of you</i>

405
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:53,342
<i>have a nano thermic</i>
<i>explosive in your brain.</i>

406
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:56,446
<i>It's a tiny explosive,</i>
<i>but remote controlled.</i>

407
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:58,047
What?

408
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,782
<i>Should you choose</i>
<i>not to participate?</i>

409
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:02,385
<i>Well, I can end your life.</i>
<i>It's nothing to me.</i>

410
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:04,654
- Holy shit.
- God.

411
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:08,191
<i>And finally,</i>
<i>I want to express</i>

412
00:26:08,324 --> 00:26:10,526
<i>our gratitude</i>
<i>for your service.</i>

413
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,462
<i>Testing on humans</i>
<i>has always had</i>

414
00:26:12,595 --> 00:26:14,363
<i>the quickest gains</i>
<i>in medical knowledge.</i>

415
00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:18,034
<i>And for that,</i>
<i>I want to say thank you</i>

416
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,570
<i>for making</i>
<i>the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

417
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:22,371
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

418
00:26:22,505 --> 00:26:24,073
What? Ultimate sacrifice.
What does that mean?

419
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:27,310
<i>Zimieski, please escort them</i>

420
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:29,045
<i>through the SW</i>
<i>tunnel to begin.</i>

421
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:32,515
<i>Oh, and good luck.</i>

422
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:41,591
Don't fucking
think about it.

423
00:26:58,274 --> 00:26:59,709
Anybody else?

424
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,522
Get up.

425
00:27:15,893 --> 00:27:17,360
Get up against the wall.

426
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,529
Hey, shit head.

427
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:23,866
Scoot over, Jesus.
You wanna see something?

428
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:25,936
-What is it?
-My hunt?

429
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:27,637
No, not really.

430
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,038
Why not?

431
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:30,706
You know what?
Guess I'm kinda over

432
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,175
watching other people
get the experience.

433
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,513
I hear you.
And trust me, I get it.

434
00:27:37,647 --> 00:27:40,349
I wish that I would've
started off the way you are.

435
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:43,085
Participation first,
kill later.

436
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:44,988
Death is a motherfucker.

437
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:46,889
Without the right people,
it'll really fuck you up.

438
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:48,224
Yeah, I get it.

439
00:27:48,357 --> 00:27:49,659
I'm kind of tired
of the excuses.

440
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,028
Some people wanna kill.

441
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,762
Okay.
And what if they don't?

442
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:54,898
Really?

443
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,566
No one's ever thought
they'd be good at killing

444
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:58,134
and actually been right
about themselves?

445
00:27:58,267 --> 00:28:00,436
Jesus H-- well,
I mean, here's the deal,

446
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,438
Princess,
you're in a bit of a mood.

447
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:05,641
So I'm gonna help less and
I'm gonna kick it over here.

448
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:07,143
But just don't forget

449
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:08,744
I can whoop
your fucking ass, all right?

450
00:28:08,878 --> 00:28:11,314
Sure, sure, sure.
Just know I can handle it.

451
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:13,215
Handle what, boy?

452
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:15,818
Kill, Dad.
I'm fucking ready, man.

453
00:28:15,953 --> 00:28:17,386
You have me
sitting here in the wings.

454
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,255
I mean, how are
we supposed to know

455
00:28:19,388 --> 00:28:20,958
if it's preventative treatment
if we don't test it out?

456
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,692
I know corporate's on your ass
but I'm fucking sick--

457
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:24,226
I don't care
what AMACORP says.

458
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,963
You'll go
when I say you're ready.

459
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:36,606
Don't worry about Woodman.

460
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:41,310
You will go soon.

461
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:44,280
<i>You have made it</i>

462
00:28:44,413 --> 00:28:45,983
<i>to the final stage</i>
<i>of your treatment.</i>

463
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:49,086
<i>Now go enjoy yourself</i>
<i>and have a happy hunt.</i>

464
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:51,454
That's exactly
what we do here.

465
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,056
Now, you know.

466
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:56,325
No more rumors
or whisperings in your command.

467
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:58,794
This is it.
Soft combat.

468
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,763
It's why there's
so much hardware.

469
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,201
Your support staff
is beyond excellent.

470
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:11,240
While somewhat controversial,
these methods have been, well,

471
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,776
beyond expectation
in terms of results.

472
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:17,480
We get our soldiers
back to work,

473
00:29:17,613 --> 00:29:21,717
whether it's
for the country or for us.

474
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:29,592
That's all well and good but
the real question here is...

475
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:32,194
are you willing
to do the work necessary

476
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:33,930
to get back out
where you belong?

477
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:38,768
Because son,
your-- your dossier is--

478
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,302
Excellent.

479
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:43,606
That it is.

480
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:48,310
But it's not
just about you,

481
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:50,947
it's about a lot of other
men and women like you.

482
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,617
The data
we retrieve in the field,

483
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,319
it dramatically improves
our entire process.

484
00:29:59,388 --> 00:30:02,224
So if you ever
wanna make a difference,

485
00:30:02,358 --> 00:30:03,994
here's your chance.

486
00:30:04,827 --> 00:30:07,563
- Does it work?
- Yes, it does.

487
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:10,399
This is something
to be proud of, son.

488
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:18,307
Talked and thought enough
the last few months.

489
00:30:20,476 --> 00:30:21,544
Let's get on with it.

490
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:28,517
You heard the man,
let's get on with it.

491
00:30:46,402 --> 00:30:48,171
Protocol is as follows.

492
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,073
You'll have
exactly 60 minutes

493
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:52,374
to get a head start
before your team gets their OP.

494
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:55,578
-Fuck this shit, man.
-Fucking serious?

495
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:57,847
Let's do this.

496
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,950
-Okay.
-Okay.

497
00:31:03,954 --> 00:31:06,322
How do we survive
something like this?

498
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:09,458
Just make it
to the river.

499
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,327
I'll get you,
you piece of shit.

500
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,963
-Stop.
-I swear.

501
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:14,864
-Stop. Stop. Stop.
-You don't even fucking know.

502
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,900
- I'll come for you, you fuck.
- Please stop.

503
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:31,547
Please. You--
you don't have to do this.

504
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,616
You can just--
you just let us go.

505
00:31:34,383 --> 00:31:35,484
You better hurry.

506
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:48,899
Kill the music.

507
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:51,801
No need.

508
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:53,836
Up, rest.

509
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:56,739
Chief, you can settle
in here with your support team.

510
00:31:57,174 --> 00:32:00,376
Gentlemen, ladies,

511
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:01,912
you all know the drill.

512
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,282
This man is in the final phases
of his treatment,

513
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:08,051
which means
he needs our help.

514
00:32:08,818 --> 00:32:12,621
So, we're gonna do
everything within our power

515
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:14,991
to make sure we get him
back in the saddle.

516
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:17,160
Is that clear
with all of you?

517
00:32:17,294 --> 00:32:18,694
Yes, sir.

518
00:32:18,828 --> 00:32:20,663
I expect it
to be done.

519
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,866
-Good luck.
-Sir.

520
00:32:26,468 --> 00:32:27,770
Welcome.

521
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,740
Make yourself at home.

522
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:33,944
We're still
a little ways out

523
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,678
so you help yourself
to anything.

524
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:37,713
Thank you.

525
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:41,985
Welcome, brother.
Good to have you.

526
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:44,087
You boys kissing?

527
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:45,989
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

528
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:49,259
I would actually.
Um, don't listen to Price.

529
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:51,094
He will never stop
talking to you.

530
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:53,296
Oh, I thought
you got off my wit, my charm?

531
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,233
Mm. I thought you'd know by now
when a woman was faking it.

532
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:57,934
Damn.
That's cold.

533
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,770
You know
I love you Price,

534
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:03,372
like a brother.

535
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:05,841
Like a much younger,
slower brother

536
00:33:05,976 --> 00:33:07,743
who needs my help
just to tie his shoes.

537
00:33:07,877 --> 00:33:10,113
Okay.
Let the man settle in.

538
00:33:14,683 --> 00:33:16,685
Chief Woodman,
you can bunk up over there.

539
00:33:41,912 --> 00:33:43,313
Where are we headed?

540
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:44,580
Straight to the river.

541
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,782
How much time
do we even have?

542
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,550
Wait, wait.
He gave me a watch.

543
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,419
Okay, we'll stop and check.

544
00:33:52,055 --> 00:33:53,023
What time you got?

545
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,556
49 minutes left.

546
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,226
No, we need
to pick it up.

547
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,028
No, we need to be smart.

548
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,331
She's gonna kill us.
All right? She's moving slow.

549
00:34:01,463 --> 00:34:02,831
She should
give me the watch.

550
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:04,700
I have the best chance
to get out there.

551
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,635
No, we have the best chance
if we stick together.

552
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:08,570
Yeah. For the last time
I'm not giving you this watch.

553
00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:10,739
You think what you want.
I'm making it to the river.

554
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:12,574
Look, if you don't have
anything good to say

555
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,543
then just shut up.

556
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,946
What's that?

557
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,049
What?

558
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:22,085
That.

559
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:24,020
Oh, my--

560
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,922
Careful.

561
00:34:26,655 --> 00:34:28,391
Where are its arms and legs?

562
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,093
What are you doing?

563
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:31,627
Being of use.

564
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:37,133
I think
we should keep moving.

565
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:38,801
Yeah.
What the fuck?

566
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,274
Did you find anything?

567
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,010
No.

568
00:34:47,143 --> 00:34:50,180
No, we should, uh, do like
she says and keep moving.

569
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,985
Come on.

570
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,796
Excuse me.

571
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,201
Woodman's looking
a little weak.

572
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:12,768
Especially socially.

573
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,536
You wanna
explain that to me

574
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,474
considering he spent so much
time at your research facility?

575
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:19,009
He did.

576
00:35:19,142 --> 00:35:20,944
But we are talking about
a man who is considered

577
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,445
to have been one
of our deadliest Seals

578
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,980
in the last five years.

579
00:35:24,114 --> 00:35:26,349
So you okay sending him
out there with my men?

580
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:29,585
Of course.
Colonel, let's be clear.

581
00:35:29,718 --> 00:35:31,787
Nothing we do
will ever fully get these men

582
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,390
and women back
to where they once were.

583
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:35,992
But we can see to it
that they're useful again.

584
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:39,695
Useful people is
what makes society tick.

585
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,632
Thanks for the education.

586
00:35:46,136 --> 00:35:48,138
If Woodman
doesn't shoot, you do.

587
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,571
Yes, ma'am.

588
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:53,476
43 minutes left.
Can we stop for a second?

589
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,978
No.

590
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,612
It's okay.
You just gotta stay positive.

591
00:35:56,745 --> 00:35:58,680
-Thanks.
-You know.

592
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:05,121
Hey, hey!

593
00:36:05,255 --> 00:36:06,688
Guys, come quick.

594
00:36:06,822 --> 00:36:08,624
What the fuck?
Give it a minute, man.

595
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,827
I thought
we cleaned up all the traps.

596
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,729
We must have
missed one, sir.

597
00:36:14,497 --> 00:36:16,232
It's a waste
is what it is.

598
00:36:16,366 --> 00:36:17,800
Waste of a good resource.

599
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:19,768
It won't happen again, sir.

600
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:22,604
It better not.

601
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,611
Be careful guys.

602
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,781
Oh, my God.

603
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,317
What the hell
is that?

604
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:37,320
Out here, a wolf trap
or something like that?

605
00:36:37,454 --> 00:36:38,654
How bad is it?

606
00:36:38,787 --> 00:36:40,223
How do you know
it's a wolf trap?

607
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:41,723
Slowly.

608
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:43,226
What? You've never seen
a wolf trap before?

609
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,793
We don't have time
for this, we gotta go.

610
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,964
Fuck you, Lance.
No seriously. Fuck you.

611
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:50,967
-How do I get this thing off?
-Usually, that is uncinched.

612
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:54,237
Let me try.

613
00:36:55,939 --> 00:36:58,041
-Please. It hurts.
-God, it's not moving.

614
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,076
Stop whining.

615
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,912
Either I'm not
strong enough or it's stuck.

616
00:37:04,147 --> 00:37:07,584
Fine. Fine. I'll fucking help
if it gets her out quicker.

617
00:37:07,716 --> 00:37:08,918
Hey.
You got it.

618
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:10,920
All right, you ready?

619
00:37:13,323 --> 00:37:14,924
One, two, three.

620
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:16,292
Pull.

621
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:17,826
It's not moving.

622
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:19,429
Pull harder motherfucker.

623
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:23,233
It's not.

624
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,633
Fuck!

625
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,370
Uh, maybe we can
cut it with something.

626
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:28,737
-Yeah.
-With what?

627
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,406
Uh, let's see. Uh.

628
00:37:31,107 --> 00:37:32,575
The chain goes
all the way around the log

629
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,077
there's no way
we're gonna move it.

630
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,246
Or we could break it
with something somehow.

631
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,948
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, a rock or anything sharp.

632
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:40,782
- Oh, my God.
- Here, here, here.

633
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,886
Oh, okay, okay, here.

634
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,159
The shit's not working.

635
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,394
Time?

636
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:52,929
I don't know,
she has the watch.

637
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:01,337
Can we have it?
Just in case?

638
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:03,306
Wait.

639
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,920
Okay.

640
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:23,226
Thirty-eight minutes.

641
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,061
Which just means
we gotta be faster.

642
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:27,063
No, it means we're
literally running out of time.

643
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:29,032
We can't sit here
and play MacGyver forever.

644
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:31,501
Seriously,
what is wrong with you?

645
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:32,801
Look, we've got
about an hour.

646
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,337
We can still do this.

647
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,039
I would want you to do
the same if it were me.

648
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:38,041
I'm just being realistic.

649
00:38:38,174 --> 00:38:40,476
Oh, really? So you'd want us to
just leave you here for dead?

650
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,011
Abso-fucking-lutely.

651
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:43,613
You are a real
piece of work, man.

652
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:45,814
I'm not dying for
some stranger. I-- I'm sorry.

653
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,883
Oh, but you can kill
one with your car?

654
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:50,752
Fucking know
what you're talking about.

655
00:38:50,886 --> 00:38:52,721
Stop!

656
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:54,691
-You don't fucking know.
-Stop.

657
00:38:54,823 --> 00:38:56,492
It's not helping
at all. Okay?

658
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,995
Hey, hey, hey.
What's that?

659
00:39:05,867 --> 00:39:08,737
Look, put pressure
right here.

660
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,473
Quit the shit.

661
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:13,943
A hunting vehicle.

662
00:39:14,077 --> 00:39:15,178
This shit is not gonna run.

663
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,845
- Glove box.
- Right?

664
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,348
Maybe there's something
we can use.

665
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:38,234
Woodman takes
out the band,

666
00:39:38,368 --> 00:39:41,037
it's with our support
and support only.

667
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:47,043
Stay loose
and have some fun.

668
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:49,512
All right?

669
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,982
Let's have a go.

670
00:40:16,272 --> 00:40:21,210
Fuck. Fuck.
Where's the fucking gun?

671
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:27,150
I found something.

672
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:30,787
-Jesus.
-Fuck!

673
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,088
Sorry.

674
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:40,296
This is stupid, but--

675
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,464
What?

676
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:44,567
I didn't do anything
that I wanted to do.

677
00:40:45,802 --> 00:40:47,103
What do you mean?

678
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:51,474
I just--

679
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:55,411
I was just
too stupid.

680
00:40:55,545 --> 00:40:57,313
I don't know,
I was selfish.

681
00:40:57,447 --> 00:40:58,815
-Please don't talk like that.
-I'm gonna die here--

682
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:00,216
Don't talk like that.

683
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,051
I'm so sorry.
I did it all wrong.

684
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:03,453
Don't be sorry.
Okay. Don't. Don't.

685
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,121
-I did it all wrong.
-I promise you

686
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,622
that we are gonna
get you out of here.

687
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,224
It's okay.

688
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:11,260
I'm sorry.

689
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:14,731
Please, no.
Stay awake.

690
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,633
Stay awake.
Rachel, just breathe.

691
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,802
Okay. Just breathe.
We're gonna get outta here.

692
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,003
We're gonna
get outta here.

693
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:25,942
Yeah. Hey, this looks like
the area we're in right now.

694
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,010
-Right?
-Wait. Hold-- hold on.

695
00:41:28,144 --> 00:41:29,579
We don't even know
if that shit is real.

696
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:30,980
What are you
talking about?

697
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,648
Well, the map.

698
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,217
I mean, it's a perfect
fucking map placed here for us.

699
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,085
-We don't know.
-Come on.

700
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:37,620
You can't be serious.
I mean, look at this thing.

701
00:41:37,754 --> 00:41:39,088
Looks like hasn't been
touched in forever.

702
00:41:39,222 --> 00:41:40,757
They probably
forgot about it.

703
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:42,558
And who gives a fuck?
It's the only thing we got.

704
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:44,927
Feels like you're
working against us, it's crazy.

705
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:47,163
Who me? You fuck face!
I'm trying to be smart.

706
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,998
Who knows what
they set up for us?

707
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,867
Holy shit.
Hey, hey. Guys.

708
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,702
Holy shit.
This could be the river.

709
00:41:52,835 --> 00:41:55,405
And this looks like a clearing
not too far from here, right?

710
00:41:55,538 --> 00:41:56,906
Between us
and the river.

711
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:58,474
Yeah. Yeah.
I-- I say--

712
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:00,109
I say we go there
and try and find something

713
00:42:00,243 --> 00:42:01,611
to help us
get the hell outta here.

714
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:03,079
Guys, she passed out.

715
00:42:03,212 --> 00:42:05,148
Shit.

716
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:07,483
It's not good, guys.

717
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,457
What-- what is that?

718
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,994
Kyle, what--
what time do you have?

719
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:21,197
30 minutes. It might be
a warning or something.

720
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,799
Yeah, unless
that lead was bullshitting

721
00:42:22,932 --> 00:42:24,267
and they're coming right now.

722
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,668
Either way,
we probably shouldn't stay

723
00:42:25,802 --> 00:42:26,803
in one spot
too long.

724
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:28,371
What about helping Rachel?

725
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,455
Eagle one,
this is Red Dog one.

726
00:42:45,588 --> 00:42:46,823
Do you copy?

727
00:42:46,956 --> 00:42:48,090
<i>Red Dog, this is Eagle.</i>

728
00:42:48,224 --> 00:42:49,927
<i>We got you loud.</i>

729
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:52,462
<i>Be advised that designated</i>
<i>call signs are in effect.</i>

730
00:42:52,595 --> 00:42:53,830
Copy Eagle one.

731
00:42:53,963 --> 00:42:55,998
Red Dog, two,
three, four, five,

732
00:42:56,132 --> 00:42:58,000
this is Red Dog one,
mic check.

733
00:42:58,968 --> 00:43:00,369
Three here.

734
00:43:00,503 --> 00:43:01,471
Four here.

735
00:43:01,604 --> 00:43:03,306
-Five here.
-Copy that.

736
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:05,775
Eagle one, Red Dog one, two
and five will branch off

737
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:08,878
to the southwest and head
down to the clearing, break.

738
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:12,348
<i>Red Dog three and four will</i>
<i>team up and head southbound</i>

739
00:43:12,482 --> 00:43:14,083
<i>to flank them</i>
<i>as we flush them out.</i>

740
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,986
<i>Red Dog one out.</i>

741
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,588
<i>Great. Copy.</i>

742
00:43:26,596 --> 00:43:29,765
We already did this. All right?
We obviously have to leave her.

743
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,167
We can't.

744
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,035
If it weren't
for that map and watch,

745
00:43:33,169 --> 00:43:34,537
I wouldn't be standing here.

746
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,539
Her leg is fucked
even if she wakes up.

747
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:38,207
No, no, no, no.
Okay. Just wait.

748
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:40,309
- For what?
- I can get her up.

749
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:44,180
Okay? Come on, Rachel.
Wake up.

750
00:43:44,313 --> 00:43:46,015
Guys, I hate to say
but we have to go.

751
00:43:46,148 --> 00:43:47,550
- No.
- Now!

752
00:43:47,683 --> 00:43:49,185
Time?

753
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:50,988
23 minutes.

754
00:43:51,721 --> 00:43:55,959
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You wanna live, right?

755
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,527
-Right?
-Yes.

756
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,295
This is something
we have to do.

757
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,163
There is no choice here.

758
00:44:06,402 --> 00:44:08,704
-Okay, fine.
-Thank you. Thank you.

759
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:31,861
Oh, my God.
The map is real.

760
00:44:32,595 --> 00:44:34,597
You know,
I don't see anybody.

761
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:37,266
I can go down there.

762
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:39,201
Yeah, why don't--
why don't you give me the map?

763
00:44:39,335 --> 00:44:40,703
I'll check out over here.

764
00:44:40,836 --> 00:44:42,204
No, fuck that.
We'll never see you again.

765
00:44:42,338 --> 00:44:43,941
Are you sure?

766
00:44:44,073 --> 00:44:46,910
Yeah. I can go down there
and I'll-- I'll scope it out

767
00:44:47,044 --> 00:44:48,377
and I'll wave
you guys down.

768
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,379
All right,
you better hurry

769
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:52,148
'cause we only got
13 minutes left.

770
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,610
What's your deal?

771
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:23,646
You're not
your usual jackass self today.

772
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,148
-What do you mean?
-You know what I mean.

773
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:28,217
I heard you
talking to Rawlings.

774
00:45:29,285 --> 00:45:31,153
You know that mission
at the ISO prison

775
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:32,488
with the CIA dude?

776
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,558
The one where one of ours
killed over 200 of theirs?

777
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:37,660
Yeah, of course.

778
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:39,629
Well.

779
00:45:43,132 --> 00:45:44,400
Woodman?

780
00:45:46,502 --> 00:45:48,170
-Oh.
-Yeah.

781
00:45:50,907 --> 00:45:52,642
Okay.

782
00:45:52,775 --> 00:45:54,176
All right,
I say we look for anything

783
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,678
we can use
to defend ourselves.

784
00:45:55,811 --> 00:45:57,513
I bet we could find
something that would

785
00:45:57,647 --> 00:45:59,248
-cut that chain on Rachel.
-No, she's dead, Sara!

786
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,550
She's dead!
And we are too if we go back.

787
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,287
Yeah.
We-- weapons. Yeah. Okay.

788
00:46:05,421 --> 00:46:07,857
Uh, uh, I'll check
that big stuff over there.

789
00:46:07,991 --> 00:46:09,191
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

790
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:10,626
Let's split up.
I'll go with you.

791
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,963
Fine. We'll look over here.

792
00:46:21,104 --> 00:46:22,271
Check around the corner.

793
00:46:22,705 --> 00:46:23,974
That's one
of the most savage things

794
00:46:24,107 --> 00:46:25,341
I've ever heard of.

795
00:46:26,076 --> 00:46:27,743
I know.

796
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,180
So, you afraid that there's
gonna be a bigger swinging

797
00:46:31,313 --> 00:46:32,682
dick around here?

798
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:34,216
-Ha-ha.
-Mm-hmm.

799
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,318
My dick is just
perfectly average, so fuck you.

800
00:46:36,452 --> 00:46:37,653
I'm just saying.

801
00:46:37,954 --> 00:46:39,522
Well,
I'm saying there's some

802
00:46:39,689 --> 00:46:41,457
pretty fucked up details
said about that mission.

803
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,259
- So?
- So?

804
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:46,096
Stupid, my point being
that he wasn't actually

805
00:46:46,228 --> 00:46:47,563
too wounded to be moved.

806
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:49,598
That woman executed him.

807
00:46:50,499 --> 00:46:52,568
See, that doesn't make
any fucking sense,

808
00:46:52,702 --> 00:46:55,138
because why would you
go through all of that effort

809
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:56,539
just to kill the guy?

810
00:46:57,007 --> 00:46:58,207
That's what I'm saying.

811
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:00,876
What if you weren't through
all that just to kill him?

812
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,748
Fuck!

813
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:08,551
Fuck! Fuck!

814
00:47:08,684 --> 00:47:12,221
I had to. I had to.
I had to. I had to.

815
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:14,724
Even if it was
for a good reason,

816
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:17,493
kill your own guy like that,
it had to fuck you up.

817
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:20,696
He was in pretreatment
longer than us.

818
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:22,465
Yeah, I know.
Like three months.

819
00:47:22,598 --> 00:47:23,766
What the fuck
were they doing with the guy?

820
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,968
That place is hell.

821
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:28,071
I don't know, I mean,
look what it did for us.

822
00:47:28,871 --> 00:47:30,740
I've got
almost a year sober now.

823
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,408
-Congrats.
-Thank you.

824
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:34,144
You're fucking nuts.

825
00:47:34,276 --> 00:47:35,745
Chris. Chris.

826
00:47:35,878 --> 00:47:38,048
Oh, fuck,
he fucking killed me that--

827
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:42,284
Kyle. Kyle.
Kyle come here.

828
00:47:42,418 --> 00:47:44,087
- Please help me.
- I can't stand up.

829
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:45,788
-I can't stand up.
-Kyle!

830
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:52,294
Kyle and Lance just both left.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

831
00:47:52,428 --> 00:47:54,296
Oh God.

832
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,932
Another one?

833
00:48:00,402 --> 00:48:02,438
You're slipping, Colonel.

834
00:48:03,106 --> 00:48:04,174
Show me.

835
00:48:04,941 --> 00:48:06,243
I said show me!

836
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:15,518
Hey.

837
00:48:40,977 --> 00:48:42,045
Lance!

838
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:49,286
Lance!

839
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:52,956
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
it wasn't personal, man.

840
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:55,457
- We gotta stop the bleeding.
- Okay. Okay.

841
00:49:01,664 --> 00:49:05,268
Oh fuck!

842
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:06,669
Hey, cutie.

843
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:11,041
Wait. Wait.
Wait. Hold on.

844
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:15,078
I just wanna go home.

845
00:49:15,212 --> 00:49:16,745
Hey, don't do this.
Don't do this.

846
00:49:16,879 --> 00:49:18,315
- Hey, hey.
- I wanna go home.

847
00:49:18,447 --> 00:49:19,582
Let's go back
for Chris and Sara.

848
00:49:19,715 --> 00:49:20,917
No. Do you wanna live?

849
00:49:21,952 --> 00:49:23,086
I wanna live.

850
00:49:26,957 --> 00:49:28,291
Oh, fuck.

851
00:49:34,563 --> 00:49:36,632
We can't have much time left.

852
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:40,237
You know that motherfucker
took the watch.

853
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:41,704
Okay.

854
00:49:41,837 --> 00:49:44,274
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go find anything

855
00:49:44,406 --> 00:49:45,741
that can help you
get outta here.

856
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:46,775
All right?

857
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,945
I didn't do anything.
Please, please, please.

858
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:51,081
I didn't do anything.
You can take me away, okay?

859
00:49:51,214 --> 00:49:53,482
Red Dog one
this is Red Dog four.

860
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:54,918
We got a live one, over.

861
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:57,087
<i>Copy Red Dog four.</i>

862
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,687
<i>How alive are we talking?</i>

863
00:50:00,156 --> 00:50:01,724
Red one this is Red four.

864
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:04,860
She's got
a little kick in her left.

865
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,468
Yeah, I wanna go home.

866
00:50:15,771 --> 00:50:18,774
- No, I am not leaving you here.
- Sara. Sara.

867
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:19,976
Chris.

868
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,778
What do you think
is gonna happen out there...

869
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,048
realistically?

870
00:50:25,181 --> 00:50:28,318
No, no, no.
I am not leaving you.

871
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,420
- Sara.
- I'm not, no, Chris.

872
00:50:31,553 --> 00:50:33,422
The best thing
you can do is go.

873
00:50:33,555 --> 00:50:36,960
Lance, don't do that.

874
00:50:37,093 --> 00:50:40,829
Come on man.
Look, this is the river.

875
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:44,433
You wanna go home?

876
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:52,441
Shit! They are coming.

877
00:50:52,574 --> 00:50:53,876
Just fucking go.

878
00:50:54,476 --> 00:50:57,080
-Just fucking go.
-I'm sorry.

879
00:50:57,948 --> 00:51:00,951
I dunno how useful she'll be
for the program, over.

880
00:51:01,084 --> 00:51:02,919
I don't wanna die.
Please guys, please.

881
00:51:03,053 --> 00:51:04,787
<i>Woodman is priority one.</i>

882
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:06,957
<i>Grab that target</i>
<i>move on to rally point Bravo.</i>

883
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:08,457
Copy that.

884
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,626
-Wait, wait, no, wait.
-Ah?

885
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:12,395
Please, hey, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

886
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:23,772
No, please. Please. Please.

887
00:51:23,907 --> 00:51:25,507
Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

888
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:28,178
-No, no, come on.
-Lively one today.

889
00:51:28,311 --> 00:51:30,180
We're gonna work better
if we put our heads together.

890
00:51:30,313 --> 00:51:32,648
Let's just come up
with a different plan, Lance.

891
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,651
You're crazy.

892
00:51:38,854 --> 00:51:40,957
Please, please. No. No. No!

893
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,660
Whoo!

894
00:52:21,064 --> 00:52:23,766
<i>Remember, if Woodman</i>
<i>doesn't kill, you do.</i>

895
00:52:25,435 --> 00:52:26,668
I found one. I found one.

896
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,080
Shitheels
must have deserted him.

897
00:52:40,582 --> 00:52:42,118
That what happen, boy?

898
00:52:42,252 --> 00:52:43,219
They leave ya?

899
00:52:43,353 --> 00:52:44,421
Fuck.

900
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:47,257
Someone severed
your Achilles tendon.

901
00:52:48,557 --> 00:52:49,825
That's no fun.

902
00:52:56,366 --> 00:52:58,101
It's your show,
what do you wanna do?

903
00:53:00,836 --> 00:53:02,738
Hey, Junior,
can you give us a moment?

904
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:07,576
You okay?

905
00:53:10,914 --> 00:53:12,748
<i>Blue Jay one, sitrep, over.</i>

906
00:53:16,186 --> 00:53:18,388
I just need
a private moment with him.

907
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:20,290
Please, please, please.

908
00:53:21,191 --> 00:53:22,225
Attaboy.

909
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:30,599
Please, don't.
Please, don't. Please, don't.

910
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:40,176
Please, please.
You don't have to do it.

911
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,378
Please let me go.
Please, please.

912
00:53:42,912 --> 00:53:44,746
Don't. Stop.

913
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:49,818
Yes.

914
00:53:52,555 --> 00:53:54,157
Please.

915
00:54:00,063 --> 00:54:01,131
Stop!

916
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:23,886
Excellent.

917
00:54:27,823 --> 00:54:29,092
Good work, soldier.

918
00:55:13,303 --> 00:55:15,171
<i>Red one, it's Red three.</i>

919
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:17,440
<i>It's done, over.</i>

920
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,277
Copy that.

921
00:55:23,513 --> 00:55:24,780
Come on.

922
00:55:28,051 --> 00:55:30,286
We'll push him back down
towards Price and Lipson.

923
00:55:30,819 --> 00:55:32,322
There you can
continue your work.

924
00:55:49,038 --> 00:55:50,506
Sara. Sara.

925
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,376
Get off me.
What the hell? Get off me.

926
00:55:53,509 --> 00:55:54,843
-Get off me.
-Stop!

927
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:55,844
-I'm saving you right now.
-Get off me!

928
00:55:55,979 --> 00:55:57,146
Why did you leave?

929
00:55:57,879 --> 00:56:01,351
Why didn't you come back?
Did you know that Chris died?

930
00:56:02,185 --> 00:56:03,253
Why?

931
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:05,955
-Why?
-I came down here

932
00:56:06,089 --> 00:56:07,657
because Lance
took the map, okay?

933
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:10,260
I was not leaving you.
I was coming back for you.

934
00:56:13,196 --> 00:56:16,499
And when I got down here,
I saw that.

935
00:56:21,938 --> 00:56:23,239
Oh, my God.

936
00:56:23,373 --> 00:56:25,675
-What happened to his--
-I don't know.

937
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:27,210
My best guess
is that that charge

938
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:29,479
detonated as soon
as he crossed the river.

939
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:33,416
Must be
some sort of fail-safe.

940
00:56:36,085 --> 00:56:37,920
They were
never gonna let us outta here.

941
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:41,357
At least
not across the river.

942
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,927
So, what now?

943
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:49,332
We stick together
and we survive.

944
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:09,385
All right.

945
00:57:09,986 --> 00:57:11,721
Remember, we're here
to support Woodman.

946
00:57:11,853 --> 00:57:14,223
So let's try to make
the best of what we have left.

947
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:16,659
Lipson, we're gonna need
your pathfinder skills.

948
00:57:16,793 --> 00:57:18,194
Try and track 'em
along the river,

949
00:57:18,328 --> 00:57:19,962
see if they diverted somewhere,
take Woodman.

950
00:57:20,096 --> 00:57:21,597
Price and I will
head to the high ground

951
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:23,299
try to flush 'em
down to you.

952
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:26,135
Junior, go with Lipson.

953
00:57:27,036 --> 00:57:28,338
All right,
let's move out.

954
00:57:33,509 --> 00:57:35,411
You sure we can fix
what's wrong with this guy?

955
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:39,515
What did I tell you?
Don't worry about Woodman.

956
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,285
Keep your head in the game.

957
00:57:51,694 --> 00:57:54,497
Hey, how long do you think
until we get to that mountain?

958
00:57:55,064 --> 00:57:56,666
I don't know,
about two trail miles

959
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,302
before we clear the forest
and hit some foothills.

960
00:57:59,802 --> 00:58:01,437
Meaning?

961
00:58:01,571 --> 00:58:04,240
Sorry, uh, three more miles
till we reach higher ground.

962
00:58:06,342 --> 00:58:08,478
Do you think we could
get to the other side of it?

963
00:58:09,379 --> 00:58:11,147
Maybe there's
a town or something.

964
00:58:12,115 --> 00:58:14,951
I don't know.
But we gotta try, right?

965
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:17,520
Right.

966
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:20,356
Come on.

967
00:58:40,109 --> 00:58:41,711
Is all that shit
they said you did true?

968
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:44,680
Depends what was said.

969
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:47,083
Bet it was hard
to kill one of your own guys.

970
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:49,152
Yeah,
I could do it if I had to.

971
00:58:49,285 --> 00:58:50,553
You weren't there.

972
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,288
Don't believe
everything you hear.

973
00:58:52,422 --> 00:58:54,223
-What happened?
-That's enough.

974
00:58:54,357 --> 00:58:56,392
Have some fucking respect.

975
00:58:56,759 --> 00:58:59,262
The trail's fresh here,
so we're about to engage.

976
00:59:01,297 --> 00:59:03,533
-There she is.
-Stop it.

977
00:59:03,901 --> 00:59:05,468
It's Woodman's shot.

978
00:59:05,601 --> 00:59:07,036
Practicing my aim.

979
00:59:24,086 --> 00:59:25,221
That's a mess.

980
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:27,457
I prefer
close quarters anyways.

981
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:28,891
Fuck this!

982
00:59:55,651 --> 00:59:57,955
He's killing his own people.

983
00:59:58,454 --> 01:00:00,423
Motherfucker has gone crazy.

984
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:04,527
Move.

985
01:00:07,463 --> 01:00:09,632
Somebody want to tell me
what the holy fuck

986
01:00:09,765 --> 01:00:11,000
is going on around here?

987
01:00:11,467 --> 01:00:13,769
Woodman is
going after everyone, sir.

988
01:00:15,939 --> 01:00:17,006
My program.

989
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:18,407
Damn it!

990
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:21,410
Come in, Woodman, over.

991
01:00:21,544 --> 01:00:23,012
He's removed
his tracking device, sir.

992
01:00:23,145 --> 01:00:24,747
Obviously.

993
01:00:27,483 --> 01:00:29,285
<i>Woodman, come in, over.</i>

994
01:00:31,787 --> 01:00:33,189
<i>Come in, Woodman, over.</i>

995
01:00:36,025 --> 01:00:39,095
<i>Woodman.</i>
<i>Come in, Woodman, over.</i>

996
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:47,737
The fuck was that?

997
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,038
-What?
-I don't know.

998
01:00:49,171 --> 01:00:50,606
I don't know.

999
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,375
He's just--
he-- he just-- I got back--

1000
01:00:52,508 --> 01:00:54,143
I gotta get outta here.
You don't understand.

1001
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:55,811
Look, look, look, I know--

1002
01:00:55,946 --> 01:00:57,813
I know it's a lot to take in,
but we gotta stay calm.

1003
01:00:57,948 --> 01:00:59,682
He's going after everybody.
I-- I-- gotta get outta here.

1004
01:00:59,815 --> 01:01:01,250
I gotta-- I gotta get back.
You don't understand.

1005
01:01:01,384 --> 01:01:02,752
-Like, you don't understand.
-I know.

1006
01:01:02,885 --> 01:01:04,287
Kyle, you just gotta--
you gotta breathe.

1007
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,189
Just stop.
Breathe, breathe, okay?

1008
01:01:07,323 --> 01:01:08,891
Okay. Okay, okay.

1009
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:11,127
Okay? Okay?

1010
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,528
Yeah. Fuck!

1011
01:01:15,899 --> 01:01:17,166
Okay.

1012
01:01:22,405 --> 01:01:24,373
I don't recognize
any of this.

1013
01:01:25,207 --> 01:01:26,576
I don't know where we are.

1014
01:01:27,777 --> 01:01:29,378
I don't know.
Lance had the map.

1015
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:37,620
We should go back to the place
they were holding us in.

1016
01:01:40,389 --> 01:01:42,525
You want to go back
to those psychopaths?

1017
01:01:42,926 --> 01:01:44,293
Yeah. Yeah.

1018
01:01:44,427 --> 01:01:45,828
I mean, it's the only thing
I can think of.

1019
01:01:45,963 --> 01:01:47,196
If they
brought us in that way,

1020
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,131
then I bet
we can go out that way.

1021
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:53,436
That actually
fucking makes sense.

1022
01:01:54,537 --> 01:01:56,539
And we just gotta
figure out how to get there.

1023
01:02:03,879 --> 01:02:04,847
Oh, God.

1024
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:25,534
You lying down on duty, boy?

1025
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:31,407
You answer
when I talk to you.

1026
01:02:34,243 --> 01:02:35,511
God!

1027
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:42,184
You're a mess son.

1028
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:46,355
Look at these
zips are undone.

1029
01:02:50,826 --> 01:02:51,895
At ease, son.

1030
01:03:14,383 --> 01:03:15,751
Hey, man.

1031
01:03:16,285 --> 01:03:17,954
Stop! Top, Top.

1032
01:03:18,088 --> 01:03:19,923
Jason! Jason!

1033
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:22,324
It's me.

1034
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:28,397
You with me?

1035
01:03:29,832 --> 01:03:30,901
Are you with me?

1036
01:03:36,772 --> 01:03:37,740
Let's go.

1037
01:03:48,284 --> 01:03:49,518
Whose radio was that?

1038
01:03:49,652 --> 01:03:50,653
Price.

1039
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:52,655
- Is he still on?
- Yes, sir.

1040
01:03:53,355 --> 01:03:54,724
Why isn't he saying anything?

1041
01:03:58,694 --> 01:03:59,762
Oh, God.

1042
01:04:01,864 --> 01:04:04,600
Price.
Price come in, over.

1043
01:04:06,502 --> 01:04:08,337
<i>Price.</i>
<i>Come in, Price.</i>

1044
01:04:13,576 --> 01:04:15,745
Sir, Junior
and Lipson are dead.

1045
01:04:15,878 --> 01:04:18,215
<i>It's Woodman. He's gone rogue.</i>

1046
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,749
<i>Fall back to command.</i>

1047
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:23,586
We'll find him.

1048
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:25,721
<i>Negative. Negative.</i>

1049
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:28,925
<i>Fall back to command</i>
<i>and wait for QRF.</i>

1050
01:04:30,526 --> 01:04:32,428
I'm sorry sir,
but fuck that.

1051
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:36,265
We got it covered.
We want this one, over and out.

1052
01:04:36,398 --> 01:04:38,101
<i>Negative.</i>

1053
01:04:38,235 --> 01:04:42,205
<i>Rawlings respond. Rawlings,</i>
<i>the program is at stake.</i>

1054
01:04:58,955 --> 01:05:01,124
I say we split up and we
flush this motherfucker out.

1055
01:05:01,258 --> 01:05:02,525
Yeah.

1056
01:05:07,763 --> 01:05:09,398
We need to get them
outta there right now.

1057
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:12,535
No, they stay.

1058
01:05:13,402 --> 01:05:14,570
What did you
just say to me?

1059
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:16,239
Those are my men out there.

1060
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:18,774
My program, my data.
They stay.

1061
01:05:19,608 --> 01:05:21,178
They know
what they signed up for.

1062
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:24,014
You think because some
politician owes you a favor

1063
01:05:24,147 --> 01:05:25,949
that you know
what's coming our direction?

1064
01:05:26,082 --> 01:05:28,751
Because you don't.
You need to think again.

1065
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:30,187
Colonel...

1066
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:32,155
If the military wasn't
such a little boys' club,

1067
01:05:32,289 --> 01:05:34,991
I doubt you would've ever been
let in in the first place.

1068
01:05:36,259 --> 01:05:37,626
So, get back to work.

1069
01:05:52,242 --> 01:05:53,609
I don't know where we are.

1070
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:55,411
I don't know
how I got so turned around.

1071
01:05:55,544 --> 01:05:56,913
This is not working.

1072
01:05:57,047 --> 01:05:58,614
It's okay.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1073
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:01,084
-We'll get there.
-This is hopeless, Sara.

1074
01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:02,451
Do you understand that?

1075
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:04,120
He is gonna
find us and kill us.

1076
01:06:04,254 --> 01:06:06,388
No, no, no, no. Stop, okay?
This is not hopeless.

1077
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:09,159
I didn't come this far to just
give up right now, okay?

1078
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:11,360
I am getting back to my son.

1079
01:06:12,394 --> 01:06:13,362
You have a son?

1080
01:06:21,737 --> 01:06:23,907
Woodman is still in the area,
sir, he's moving.

1081
01:06:25,008 --> 01:06:28,111
-Get Zimieski in here.
-Zimieski, back to base.

1082
01:06:55,305 --> 01:06:57,640
One. You go that way.

1083
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:00,076
I go the other way.

1084
01:07:12,055 --> 01:07:13,789
No!

1085
01:07:15,424 --> 01:07:16,960
-No!
-Thank you.

1086
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:50,759
This won't erase
what you did.

1087
01:09:06,102 --> 01:09:07,770
Eyes on Gravedigger.

1088
01:09:09,305 --> 01:09:12,775
Stop. Stop.
I'm not going anywhere.

1089
01:09:12,909 --> 01:09:14,444
It's time
to get you home, cowboy.

1090
01:09:14,576 --> 01:09:15,811
-Let's do this.
-Stop!

1091
01:09:15,945 --> 01:09:17,981
I am set to blow.

1092
01:09:19,182 --> 01:09:21,117
You need to
get your boys outta here.

1093
01:09:21,251 --> 01:09:22,452
I'm not leaving you.

1094
01:09:22,584 --> 01:09:24,120
Listen, you fucking moron.

1095
01:09:24,254 --> 01:09:28,158
If you try to move me,
you and your boys are dead.

1096
01:09:30,692 --> 01:09:32,728
Look, we don't have time.

1097
01:09:34,464 --> 01:09:36,132
I need you to finish me.

1098
01:09:36,266 --> 01:09:37,766
I'm not doing that.

1099
01:09:37,901 --> 01:09:41,071
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you I am fucked.

1100
01:09:42,638 --> 01:09:44,673
They've cut me in places.

1101
01:09:45,641 --> 01:09:47,944
I can't even feel my legs.

1102
01:09:50,646 --> 01:09:53,849
I need you to finish me.

1103
01:09:55,884 --> 01:09:58,754
They don't win. I win.

1104
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:05,661
Are you a killer? Huh?

1105
01:10:05,794 --> 01:10:08,164
Then do your goddamn job.

1106
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,969
No, we're not out yet.

1107
01:10:16,339 --> 01:10:17,606
Look at me.

1108
01:10:19,142 --> 01:10:20,343
It's okay.

1109
01:10:25,348 --> 01:10:26,615
That's it.

1110
01:10:27,383 --> 01:10:28,952
That's my boy.

1111
01:10:30,819 --> 01:10:34,124
Thank you, son. Thank you.

1112
01:10:54,177 --> 01:10:55,545
Sir,
inclement weather approaching.

1113
01:10:55,677 --> 01:10:56,980
Possible rainfall.

1114
01:10:57,113 --> 01:11:00,483
Rawlings, fall back, over.

1115
01:11:00,617 --> 01:11:03,419
<i>Fall back.</i>
<i>Rawlings, fall back, over.</i>

1116
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,376
What the fuck is wrong
with Rawlings' equipment?

1117
01:11:26,509 --> 01:11:29,112
It seems fine. It's stationary.
It must have come off.

1118
01:11:29,245 --> 01:11:30,213
Fuck!

1119
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:58,074
Fuck you. Fuck AMACORP.

1120
01:11:58,208 --> 01:12:00,677
You and your psycho
babble bullshit.

1121
01:12:01,244 --> 01:12:03,213
The program was just mine
before you showed up.

1122
01:12:03,346 --> 01:12:05,048
We could have saved
so many lives.

1123
01:12:06,416 --> 01:12:10,186
This blood is on your hands,
not mine.

1124
01:12:36,145 --> 01:12:37,647
- Abort the mission.
- No.

1125
01:12:37,779 --> 01:12:39,082
Stay on task.

1126
01:12:40,717 --> 01:12:41,985
Did I stutter?

1127
01:12:42,952 --> 01:12:45,188
Abort the goddamn mission.

1128
01:12:47,223 --> 01:12:49,225
Hey!

1129
01:12:51,661 --> 01:12:54,763
We have not finished yet.

1130
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,289
You're out.

1131
01:13:19,422 --> 01:13:20,523
I know.

1132
01:13:26,095 --> 01:13:27,430
Yeah, me too.

1133
01:13:35,505 --> 01:13:36,572
You bitch!

1134
01:13:37,507 --> 01:13:39,509
You shot me.

1135
01:13:41,411 --> 01:13:42,979
You're a coward.

1136
01:13:46,115 --> 01:13:47,784
If you're gonna shoot a man...

1137
01:13:48,685 --> 01:13:51,321
you shoot him face to face.

1138
01:13:54,157 --> 01:13:57,226
Like I said,
we're not finished yet.

1139
01:14:51,981 --> 01:14:53,116
He was my son.

1140
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:37,220
<i>Clear everything.</i>

1141
01:16:37,353 --> 01:16:39,589
<i>Clear it all. You, with me?</i>

1142
01:16:39,722 --> 01:16:40,790
Hurry up.

1143
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,658
How much time?

1144
01:16:42,792 --> 01:16:44,193
It's almost done, ma'am.

1145
01:16:47,096 --> 01:16:48,631
QRF in 45 mikes.

1146
01:16:49,232 --> 01:16:50,733
What is it?

1147
01:17:37,847 --> 01:17:39,115
Sara?

1148
01:17:40,483 --> 01:17:43,753
You-- you left me again.

1149
01:17:43,886 --> 01:17:45,755
I'm sorry, I freaked out.

1150
01:17:45,888 --> 01:17:49,058
I thought they got you.
But you made it. You're here.

1151
01:17:49,191 --> 01:17:50,693
Get away from me.
Get away from me.

1152
01:17:50,826 --> 01:17:52,428
No, no, no, no.
We need each other.

1153
01:17:52,562 --> 01:17:54,230
Woodman is still out there.

1154
01:17:56,465 --> 01:17:58,035
- Who are you talking about?
- The guy.

1155
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,835
The guy who was
killing everybody.

1156
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:02,438
I heard somebody say his name
when he was in here earlier.

1157
01:18:06,542 --> 01:18:09,345
Look, I'm really sorry, okay?

1158
01:18:09,478 --> 01:18:11,080
I am a coward. A piece of shit.

1159
01:18:11,213 --> 01:18:14,417
There is no denying that.
We need to get out of here.

1160
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:23,593
Whoa!

1161
01:18:23,726 --> 01:18:26,128
Look, I can explain.
I can explain.

1162
01:18:26,262 --> 01:18:27,563
Explain what?

1163
01:18:27,697 --> 01:18:29,532
I was just
doing my duty, all right?

1164
01:18:29,665 --> 01:18:31,001
I was ordered.

1165
01:18:31,133 --> 01:18:33,169
You don't understand.
It's a program to help vets.

1166
01:18:33,302 --> 01:18:34,670
It is a good thing.

1167
01:18:34,804 --> 01:18:36,205
You were with them...

1168
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:38,641
the whole time?

1169
01:18:39,508 --> 01:18:42,345
I was just doing my job.

1170
01:18:42,478 --> 01:18:44,014
Sara, look at me.

1171
01:18:44,146 --> 01:18:45,916
Look at me, Sara.

1172
01:18:46,049 --> 01:18:48,651
Sara, look at me. Look.

1173
01:18:50,753 --> 01:18:52,121
No.

1174
01:18:52,254 --> 01:18:53,723
Don't do it, please.
Don't do it, please.

1175
01:18:54,624 --> 01:18:56,559
My job is
to be the fail-safe.

1176
01:18:57,526 --> 01:18:59,829
Make sure you stay
on the hunting grounds.

1177
01:19:01,898 --> 01:19:05,134
Make sure these veterans
get the help that they need.

1178
01:19:05,267 --> 01:19:06,903
Please don't do this.
Please.

1179
01:19:09,472 --> 01:19:11,074
The program helps.

1180
01:19:12,009 --> 01:19:14,543
Why couldn't you just
die like the rest of them?

1181
01:20:10,266 --> 01:20:11,567
Sara.

1182
01:20:12,234 --> 01:20:14,137
Sara, come on.

1183
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:16,672
Sara, Sara, Sara.

1184
01:20:18,607 --> 01:20:20,077
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.
It's okay. You're fine.

1185
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:21,310
You're fine. It's okay.

1186
01:20:21,711 --> 01:20:24,480
Chris, I heard you dying.

1187
01:20:24,613 --> 01:20:25,982
-I know.
-No, no, no.

1188
01:20:26,116 --> 01:20:28,317
- I heard you dying.
- I know. I know.

1189
01:20:28,451 --> 01:20:29,920
What happened?

1190
01:20:30,553 --> 01:20:31,821
He saved my life.

1191
01:20:33,355 --> 01:20:34,690
Who?

1192
01:20:35,758 --> 01:20:36,826
Him.

1193
01:20:38,494 --> 01:20:40,596
-Woodman.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

1194
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,865
He's the only reason
why I'm still alive.

1195
01:20:42,999 --> 01:20:44,067
No, no, your face.

1196
01:20:44,201 --> 01:20:45,501
He's not a good man.

1197
01:20:45,634 --> 01:20:47,236
He had to make it
look real or else

1198
01:20:47,369 --> 01:20:48,404
he would've
had to really kill me.

1199
01:20:48,537 --> 01:20:50,140
I don't believe you.

1200
01:20:50,272 --> 01:20:51,607
That piece of shit,
he hunted us.

1201
01:20:51,741 --> 01:20:53,242
He hunted us.

1202
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:55,212
He had to make it
seem that way.

1203
01:20:55,344 --> 01:20:57,480
He's here to shut
down the program, okay?

1204
01:20:57,613 --> 01:20:59,216
- What?
- Yeah.

1205
01:20:59,749 --> 01:21:01,417
What?

1206
01:21:02,451 --> 01:21:04,553
Okay, what is this
program exactly?

1207
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:11,327
This program is meant
to get us back to killing.

1208
01:21:12,195 --> 01:21:13,662
Plain and simple.

1209
01:21:13,796 --> 01:21:16,032
Military can't lose
their investments.

1210
01:21:17,299 --> 01:21:18,701
So then,
why did you help us?

1211
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:23,506
I did something
I could never take back.

1212
01:21:28,644 --> 01:21:29,845
You remind me of her.

1213
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:49,331
<i>I must</i>
<i>congratulate you, Marcus.</i>

1214
01:21:49,465 --> 01:21:52,668
<i>You are far more dangerous</i>
<i>than even I expected.</i>

1215
01:21:52,802 --> 01:21:55,005
You know, one thing
I learned many years ago

1216
01:21:55,138 --> 01:21:56,872
is there are no accidents.

1217
01:21:57,007 --> 01:21:59,642
It was no accident
that you were selected

1218
01:21:59,775 --> 01:22:01,877
for that mission
all those years ago.

1219
01:22:04,014 --> 01:22:07,616
<i>It was no accident</i>
<i>that my colleague was tortured</i>

1220
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:09,785
<i>so close to death.</i>

1221
01:22:11,288 --> 01:22:12,788
And it was no accident

1222
01:22:12,923 --> 01:22:16,792
that you were forced
to make an impossible decision.

1223
01:22:16,927 --> 01:22:19,461
<i>I suppose</i>
<i>you saved us all in the end.</i>

1224
01:22:19,595 --> 01:22:21,430
It's okay.

1225
01:22:25,068 --> 01:22:28,004
<i>You see, I never</i>
<i>wanted to cure PTSD.</i>

1226
01:22:28,138 --> 01:22:32,708
I wanted to harness it,
turn it into a weapon.

1227
01:22:32,842 --> 01:22:36,012
<i>That old man</i>
<i>tried to stop my program.</i>

1228
01:22:36,645 --> 01:22:37,914
He had to go.

1229
01:22:38,547 --> 01:22:40,516
And I saw an opportunity.

1230
01:22:42,052 --> 01:22:45,721
<i>Marcus,</i>
<i>I have been in your head</i>

1231
01:22:45,855 --> 01:22:48,225
since before
you even you knew my name.

1232
01:22:48,357 --> 01:22:50,459
Breaking you down.

1233
01:22:50,593 --> 01:22:51,760
Mind if hang out over here?

1234
01:22:51,895 --> 01:22:53,462
Clearing the field.

1235
01:22:55,031 --> 01:22:58,969
You were the key to the true
Stalking Fields Program.

1236
01:22:59,102 --> 01:23:01,037
The one I designed.

1237
01:23:01,171 --> 01:23:03,839
And now, thanks to you,
I have everything I need

1238
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:07,877
to show those bureaucrats
how effective it is.

1239
01:23:08,011 --> 01:23:12,115
<i>Give a man a purpose he'll</i>
<i>turn into a ferocious dog.</i>

1240
01:23:12,249 --> 01:23:14,683
<i>just like I gave you when--</i>

1241
01:23:14,817 --> 01:23:16,987
<i>when I killed</i>
<i>your wife and child.</i>

1242
01:23:18,487 --> 01:23:20,957
<i>Claver said they died slowly.</i>

1243
01:23:25,929 --> 01:23:27,063
Car trouble?

1244
01:23:35,437 --> 01:23:36,973
I'll drive next time.

1245
01:23:38,841 --> 01:23:42,678
<i>You see,</i>
<i>there are no accidents.</i>

1246
01:23:42,811 --> 01:23:45,514
<i>Your rage</i>
<i>gave me my life's work.</i>

1247
01:23:45,648 --> 01:23:48,884
<i>And in exchange</i>
<i>I give you your life.</i>

1248
01:23:50,452 --> 01:23:53,123
<i>You just</i>
<i>remember that, Marcus.</i>

1249
01:23:53,256 --> 01:23:54,623
<i>if you ever get the itch</i>

1250
01:23:54,757 --> 01:23:57,593
<i>to come back</i>
<i>to the stalking fields.</i>

1251
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:04,733
I'm so sorry.

1253

- Come on. Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey man.

1254
01:24:20,683 --> 01:24:23,186
Come on.
Hey man. Snap out of it.

1255
01:24:24,687 --> 01:24:25,956
Look, I know you're hurt,

1256
01:24:26,089 --> 01:24:27,690
but we can't do anything
if you're dead.

1257
01:24:27,823 --> 01:24:29,426
We-- we need your help
to get out of this.

1258
01:24:29,558 --> 01:24:30,927
Come on.

1259
01:24:35,231 --> 01:24:37,466

You got this.

1264
01:25:07,097 --> 01:25:08,564
You need to go.
