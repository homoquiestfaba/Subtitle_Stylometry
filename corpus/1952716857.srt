00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:32,034
(Man breathing)

2
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:53,830
Man #2:
Have you thought about it?

3
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:57,159
- (Clicks)
- (reggae music playing)

4
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,736
Man #2:
l think you should.

5
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:10,315
(Clears throat)

6
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,711
What does she do there?

7
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:18,316
She's the assistant to the embalmer.

8
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:20,758
Oh no.

9
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,887
Something with the fluids.

10
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:25,557
No. (Chuckles)

11
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,999
- Ugh.
- No, man.

12
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:31,993
Lucy's training her
to sell seminars with Dr. Bob.

13
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,370
She calls the funeral directors--
phone sales.

14
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:35,773
Cool.

15
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:39,102
- What's her name?
- Connie.

16
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,740
- So l'll tell Lucy it's on.
- (Car approaches)

17
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:46,617
That's my uncle.
Don't mention it.

18
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:47,677
- Man #2: Hey.
- (Car door closes)

19
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:49,382
That it's-- you know.

20
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:51,687
- Man #2: l won't. L won't.
- Because he won't let it rest.

21
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,454
- Man #2: Not a word.
- That's how he is.

22
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:59,258
- You two talking about me?
- (Man laughs) No.

23
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,062
Only about the money we make you.

24
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:02,728
Uncle:
From your lips to God's ears.

25
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:04,566
Gentlemen.

26
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:08,404
- ¶ How can we sing King Alpha song... ¶
- (volume increases)

27
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:12,503
¶ ln a strange land? ¶

28
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:15,174
¶ Sing it out loud... ¶

29
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:21,345
Jack, would you

30
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:23,515
call yourself a Rastaman?

31
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,125
- No.
- You thinking of becoming one?

32
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:30,655
- No.
- (Both laugh)

33
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:33,131
l just wanted to ask.

34
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,432
You like the song?
Reggae's mainly positive.

35
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:41,839
Some of the words, you know,
l don't get, so it's hard to commit.

36
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,244
"Over l" is a hard one.

37
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:47,872
- "Over l"?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:51,373
We'll just order something
and hang out.

39
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:55,348
- Yeah.
- No biggie.

40
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:59,757
- (Car starts)
- ¶ And the meditation of our heart ¶

00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:03,524

43
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:08,566
- ¶ Over l ¶
- ¶ Sing it out, oh! ¶

44
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:13,131
¶ We've got to sing it together... ¶

45
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:18,238
- (car starts)
- ¶ We've got to shout it together... ¶

46
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:26,253
Hi, l'm Bob Thomas.

47
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:28,813
Hi, l'm Bob Thomas.

48
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:33,383
My great-grandfather started
as a cabinetmaker and undertaker

49
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:35,223
in the small town
of Pacerville, Oregon--

50
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:38,288
Lucy: Jack's a sweetheart.
My husband's known him a long time.

51
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:41,596
- Do you like Chinese?
- Yeah, l think.

52
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:44,126
We'll just order some.

53
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,662
Bob:
...a tradition for 125 years,

54
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:49,334
offering a supporting hand

55
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,469
into life's final transition.

56
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:54,844
Bob Thomas Mortuaries
is a humble partner...

57
00:03:57,784 --> 00:03:59,775
(car honks)

58
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,754
(ltalian accent)
You drive long time?

59
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,521
Yeah.

60
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,722
You married?

61
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:11,094
No.

62
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:16,493
L practice my English.

63
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:18,367
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

64
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:22,298
(Acoustic guitar music playing)

65
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:41,456
Dressing for success.

66
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:44,327
- That's right?
- Yes, ma'am. Dress for success.

67
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,559
Dress for success.

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,898
- Maybe shoes now.
- Yes, ma'am.

69
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:53,770
¶ Stood by ¶

70
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:59,473

75
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:30,806
- ¶ Calling us ¶
- ¶ Home... ¶

76
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,271
Dress for success.

77
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:47,092
L'm sorry. You know,
to see your dad like that...

78
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:50,753
after not seeing him for a while.

79
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:55,661
The coma nurse said
when he gasped for air

80
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:58,330
his body did it in a reactive mode.

81
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,396
- (Cork pops)
- Oh.

82
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,431
That's... right?

83
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:05,501
- Yeah.
- "Like a dry pump"--

84
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,069
that's how he put it.

85
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,672
L was glad when he left
and l was alone with my dad.

86
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,117
(Men clear throats)

87
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,415
lt's good that he left because--

88
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:19,220
- Yeah.
- Yeah, l was glad he left.

89
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,490
- Yup.
- He was coming on to me.

90
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,727
The coma nurse?

91
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,528
- Right there?
- Yup.

92
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,559
- Right there in the coma room?
- That's not right.

93
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,663
He let his hand stay on my arm
without saying anything,

94
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:35,538
until my dad gasped

95
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:37,065
and then he left the coma room.

96
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,442
And my dad was right there--

97
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,174
in a coma, but still--

98
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:44,149
- lt's not right.
- No, that's-- no.

99
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:46,914
Ln a coma room
with your dad there...

100
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:51,588
in a coma, yeah, but still.

101
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:58,492
L'm fine.

102
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:03,099
- Just getting your head around that--
- Oh yeah.

103
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:04,933
(Clears throat)

104
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:08,872
My dad would gasp
and twist his body, you know.

105
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:13,606
L thought, "He wants
to get out of there," you know?

106
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:16,672
So when l was alone with my dad,
l told him, "lt's okay to go.

107
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:18,741
- You don't have to stick around."
- Yeah.

108
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:21,083
And l told him l loved him,
he was a great dad

109
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:23,919
and he was free to go to heaven.

110
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,084
- Yeah.
- Two days later

111
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,787
he woke up out of the coma.

112
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:31,695
- Man: Fuck.
- Oh, that's-- oh God.

113
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:34,165
(Chuckles)
Just woke up.

114
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:38,136
- After three months.
- Man: Fuck.

115
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:41,368
Yeah. He talked
in a softer voice, you know?

116
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:44,137
And l thought,
"Oh, well, he's in a zombie state

117
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:47,237
where you stay around because
there's some unfinished business

118
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,340
you're responsible for"--
like taking care of my mom.

119
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:52,851
Yeah, your mom. Of course.

120
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:56,481
He went back to be with her
at Village Care Facility.

121
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,150
Well, that's--

122
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:02,117
God. Lt's--

123
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:03,959
he got up from a coma, went home.

124
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:12,403
And then he fell down and hit his head
in the hallway and then he died.

125
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,041
Jack: God.

126
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,647
Lt's, uh--

127
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:30,485
- it's kind of a--
- A miracle.

128
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:31,922
Coming from a coma and then--

129
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,426
'Cause he wanted
to take care of your mom.

130
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,452
(Sighs)
She was blind.

131
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:40,329
She couldn't walk, really.

132
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:44,332
She saw things
in the air near the end.

133
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,862
She was blind, but she'd look up
in the air like she was seeing them.

134
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,776
L don't know what.
(Sniffles)

135
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:01,710
- ls the bathroom back there?
- Yeah.

136
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:14,623
(Panicked breathing)

137
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,203
She needed to talk about it, l guess.

138
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:22,140
- Yeah.
- Lucy's gone awhile, right?

139
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,076
- Yeah.
- Probably didn't have Chunky Monkey,

140
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:27,579
- so she's on a search.
- Yeah.

141
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,275
- (Doorbell buzzing)
- Huh?

142
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:31,010
(Chuckles) Huh?

143
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,383
How many times do you think,
"Hey, they've been gone a long time,"

144
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,944
and then buzz?
You know, they're there.

145
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:37,149
- (Buzzing repeatedly)
- Jack: Yeah.

146
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:40,449
Man over intercom:
Yo, who is it?

147
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:44,589
- Yo, me!
- Me, l-never-forget-my-keys me?

148
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,792
No, buzz-me-fucking-in me.

149
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,469
(Lock clicks)

150
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,530
- What?
- Nothing.

151
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:57,372
- (Panting)
- (door opens)

152
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:01,939
Lucy:
Are you ready

153
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,506
- for Chunky Monkey?
- (Door closes)

154
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,514
Three delis. Where's Connie?

155
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:12,352
L'm here.
(Coughs)

156
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:23,559
- lt'll have to be warmer though.
- Yeah.

157
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:28,271
- Boating weather.
- Yeah.

158
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:36,973
Are you sure you don't
want me to drive you?

159
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:39,416
Uh, no, it's really-- it's all right.

160
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:41,010
This is plenty.

161
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:03,533
Boating.

162
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:07,470
Yeah.

163
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:13,679
(Door opens)

164
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,254
(kisses)

165
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:19,015
(door closes)

166
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,528
(engine revs)

167
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:24,257
Lucy:
You like Connie?

168
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:27,164
We got along pretty well outside.

169
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,394
Man: Yeah?

170
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:34,134
Well, she said she'd like--
(clears throat)

171
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,075
- she'd like to go boating.
- Man: Boating?

172
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,807
Yeah, rowing in a boat
she said, you know?

173
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,180
To go boating...
(clears throat)

174
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:48,085
you know, sometime when--
(clears throat) fuck.

175
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:52,086
- (Faucet runs)
- So what did you say?

176
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,117
- Maybe when it's warmer.
- You made a date for summer?

177
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:57,755
Uh, no. L'm not, you know,

178
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:00,994
that bad to say "Let's do something
six months from now."

179
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,400
- Lucy: He knows.
- No, it-- it--

180
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:05,529
it started snowing
and it came up, you know?

181
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,562
The warm weather and summer.

182
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:09,905
Lf you're afraid, it's not a good idea.

183
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:13,434
L, uh, can't swim.

184
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,243
- Man: l told you l'd teach you.
- Lucy: He taught me.

185
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:19,740
You said it caused problems,
teaching someone you're close to,

186
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:21,754
so l thought--

187
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:23,881
(chuckles)
l don't think so.

188
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,289
Lt was something else.
L just said it was the swimming lessons.

189
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:30,288
Lt wasn't the swimming lessons?

190
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,456
Man:
No. Come summer,

191
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:34,022
you'll go boating at night...

192
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,035
in the moonlight.

193
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:39,061
Huh? Huh?

194
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:41,005
Under the stars.

195
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,203
Yeah, l should learn, l guess.

196
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,609
We'll go uptown--
a pool in Harlem.

197
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:49,547
- Beautiful pool.
- Lt's heated?

198
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,377
- L'm serious.
- L'm serious.

199
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:54,045
Man:
lt'll get me back going.

200
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,055
L used to go three, four times a week.

201
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,182
- Yeah.
- (Kisses)

202
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:02,158
Thanks for everything. Yeah.

203
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,356
- (Clicks)
- (reggae music playing)

204
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:11,893
(door opens)

205
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:15,570
(door closes)

206
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,611
(acoustic guitar music playing)

207
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:33,521
Connie: Hi, l'm calling
from Dr. Bob's Grief Seminars.

208
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,824
The new seminar experience
offers techniques--

209
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,657
that's right.

210
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,329
(Lucy whispers)
Credit card.

211
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,859
--Violent acts,

212
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:46,394
the pain of sudden death--

213
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,566
- l did?
- Lucy: Credit card.

214
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,872
Mr. Pendecker.

215
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:55,613
He said to call back tomorrow.

216
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:58,879
Remember, it's "Hello,"
the opening,

217
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,510
"Give me the credit card."

218
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,180
The pitch,
"Give me the credit card."

219
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,882
- Lt's a mantra.
- Dr. Bob: Maybe another peek

220
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:05,288
at the website will help
with the calls, hmm?

221
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,292
Get you more familiar
with what we do here.

222
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:09,317
- Okay.
- Call me.

223
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:14,199
(Mutters) Credit card.
Give me the credit card.

224
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,037
- Let's go a little deeper.
- Deeper?

225
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,630
You'll still touch.
A little deeper.

226
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:29,004
Lt's getting deep.

227
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,039
A little more.

228
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:40,121
- Lt's pretty deep.
- Okay, try it now.

229
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,324
(Inhales)

230
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,264
Ugh.
(Coughs)

231
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:57,538
That's good, but--
Jack, that's good, but go under.

232
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:59,408
Make the bubbles under the water,

233
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:01,879
then come up.
Take a breath, then go under.

234
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:03,848
Bubbles, come up.
Get a rhythm going.

235
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,475
We'll do it together.
Are you ready?

236
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:07,611
But it's good. Are you ready?

237
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,644
- Breath.
- (Both inhale deeply)

238
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:10,849
Under.

239
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,286
You can keep your eyes open.

240
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,060
My goggles leak.

241
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:22,090
They should suck around
your eyes a little bit.

242
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,666
- How do they feel?
- Okay.

243
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,539
L want you to visualize.

244
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:32,976
- Visualize?
- Lt's a technique.

245
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:35,845
- Close your eyes.
- L thought you said open them?

246
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:37,405
When you do it, yeah.
But now

247
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,816
it's something you can do at home--
visualization--

248
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,719
when you're not actually in the water.
L want you to close your eyes.

249
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:45,019
- Okay.
- See yourself going under,

250
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:46,752
blowing bubbles, coming up.

251
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,817
- Okay.
- Try it. See yourself do it.

252
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,829
Okay.

253
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,157
(Breathing slows)

254
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:01,733
Man: Jack.

255
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,399
- Jack.
- Yeah?

256
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:07,344
- You visualized?
- Yeah.

257
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,178
- Your eyes were open?
- You said close them.

258
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:11,979
No, to visualize.

259
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,451
Yeah, when we do it, yeah.

260
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:16,353
But when you visualized you went under,
your eyes were open?

261
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,380
(Both laugh)

262
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:20,619
Yeah, l think.

263
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:23,290
Try it again.

264
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:37,232
Yeah, open.

265
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:38,709
Good. Okay.

266
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:40,006
Look at me when we do it.

267
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:41,911
We'll do it now, together.
Are you ready?

268
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:44,040
- Yeah.
- (Both inhale deeply)

269
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:57,757
You're doing good.

270
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,526
L can do better.

271
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,726
- You're doing good.
- L can do better.

272
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:14,612
(Both laugh)

273
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,376
This fucking guy.

274
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:36,558
- L just need the application.
- We're closed.

275
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:39,630
Just the application.

276
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:47,269
Fuck you.

277
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:49,645
Lucy: lt's a sales job.
That's the bottom line.

278
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:52,810
- Lf you don't close, you don't last.
- L was on the phone with Jack.

279
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:54,444
- L was talking to you.
- L was listening.

280
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:57,547
- What did l say?
- You have to fire Connie.

281
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:01,219
- When do you go in?
- Tonight. Why?

282
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,958
So what's up with Jack?

283
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:07,830
He was upset
about a guy at the MTA office.

284
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:10,665
Wouldn't give him an application
because he was a minute late.

285
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:15,606
He needs to hook up. Lt's time.

286
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,109
Shit. L'm running late.

287
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:22,006
Jack's got me,
you and the limo job-- that's it.

288
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:25,073
That's it for me. L've got you...

289
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:28,518
- (door closes)
- ...Jack's a friend and l drive a limo.

290
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:31,785
- You take business classes at City.
- He's talking about the MTA.

291
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:34,759
Look, l love Jack, but Jack's--
l don't know what it is to call it.

292
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:36,659
- What would you say?
- L don't know what it is

293
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:39,755
- you don't know what to call.
- Lt's something.

294
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:42,063
- Maybe it's nothing.
- Connie might be good for him.

295
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:44,535
Lt'd be easier to help it along
if she were working there,

296
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,128
but l don't know.

297
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:48,163
L'll call.

298
00:18:57,082 --> 00:18:59,073
(Jazz music playing)

299
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:46,754
(Lucy coughing)

300
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,003
Connie:
lf he's there, we can conference.

301
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,735
No, l'll hold.

302
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,675
Lucy:
You're early.

303
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,542
L want to talk to you
when you're done.

304
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,638
- Dr. Bob wanted to be here.
- (Connie coughs)

305
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:05,479
- Jesus! Fuck. What happened to you?
- L was attacked.

306
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,008
- No.
- Yeah, on the subway, a man.

307
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:08,417
- L'm fine. L'm all right.
- Give me the phone.

308
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:10,854
- L'm gonna close Curtis-Lopez!
- Get off the phone!

309
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,120
- Please! L'm gonna close!
- Get off!

310
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:16,127
Mr. Curtis? Hi, Mr. Lopez.

311
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:17,890
Let's start by getting
your credit card reservation.

312
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,488
- L need an ambulance.
- AmEx, sure. The number?

313
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,523
A woman was attacked.
She's coughing up blood.

314
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,195
- (Coughs)
- Blood. Coughing.

315
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:26,830
- 3-- yes-- 9-6-9--
- She was attacked on the subway.

316
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:28,601
--Okay-- 1-1-1.
And the expiration date, please.

317
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:29,801
- Hurry.
- 4/12.

318
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:34,608
- Ls she all right?
- Thanks for coming.

319
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:36,672
Lucky l caught some time.
The roads are no picnic.

320
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,444
Hi, Mr. Kendal.
Thanks for calling back.

321
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:41,146
No, l'll wait. Sure, l'll wait.

322
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:42,619
Are you okay?
You sounded pretty worried.

323
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,145
L thought it was internal bleeding,

324
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:46,123
but it was blood from her nose
that bled backward.

325
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:48,888
- Backward? That's weird.
- Yeah, backward into your stomach,

326
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:51,419
like a lot-- a ruptured dorsal
or something.

327
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:53,488
- She has a couple of fractured ribs.
- (Cell phone vibrates)

328
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:54,999
Are you there?

329
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:58,263
- Third floor?
- (Car alarm beeps)

330
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:16,548
- What do you have?
- A koala bear.

331
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:19,319
- Authentic koala bear.
- But she's okay?

332
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:20,916
- Lt's terrible, huh?
- She's okay though?

333
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,121
- They said she'll be fine.
- He got her a koala.

334
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:25,255
- Think she'll like it?
- Sure, it's cute.

335
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:28,494
- (Cell phone rings)
- l'll go see if l can learn anything.

336
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:31,230
Classic Limousine Service.

337
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,932
- The hospital.
- So how's the gal?

338
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,202
She's okay.

339
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:39,904
Dorsal something broke.

340
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:42,277
So what did you get her?
You got her something, right?

341
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:44,942
Uh, l got her a koala bear.

342
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:47,847
A stuffed bear.

343
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:50,817
Koala.
They live in Australia.

344
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:53,882
Okay. Yeah, roger that.

345
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:55,018
(Clears throat)

346
00:21:57,363 --> 00:22:00,127
- Just-- you know.
- Yeah.

347
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:02,030
- Lucy: We can say hello now.
- Okay.

348
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,932
- (Cell phone rings)
- Hang on.

349
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:05,630
Dr. Bob, you got my message.

350
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:07,639
No, before l could tell her.

351
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,506
- L've gotta take this. 10 minutes.
- (Cell phone vibrates)

352
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,942
- She closed Lopez.
- Clyde: Classic Limousine Service.

353
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:15,742
Okay. No, l can. L'm on my way.

354
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:19,477
Plaza client wants
to take his kid to Serendipity

355
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:22,043
- for the hot-chocolate sundae.
- L hear they're good there.

356
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,146
Yeah. Where's Lucy?

357
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:43,170
- She said to go in.
- We can go in?

358
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,369
She's on the phone with her boss.
L gotta go.

359
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:47,072
Down the hall, room 302.

360
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:06,250
L brought a friend.

361
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,952
(Connie chuckles)

362
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:14,725
- Oh, this is so sweet.
- Koala bear from Australia.

363
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,826
Connie: Oh.

364
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,970
Shouldn't you be working?

365
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:22,565
Uh, air-- airport's closed--

366
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:26,510
you know,
blizzard conditions, so--

367
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:28,672
You've got to be careful driving.

368
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:30,306
Yeah.

369
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:35,513
L look forward
to when winter's over.

370
00:24:35,554 --> 00:24:37,078
Lt's not summer for a while.

371
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,620
We could do something
before summer,

372
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:49,065
you know, when you feel better.

373
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,393
Okay.

374
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:55,497
Maybe--
l don't know-- dinner.

375
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:58,436
You know, when you feel up to it.

376
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:00,978
You know, a big feast.

377
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:04,073
Just-- just have too much
of everything.

378
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:07,085
No one has ever
done that for me before.

379
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,886
- L hope you're a good eater.
- No one has ever cooked for me before.

380
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:16,420
- Cooked?
- No one has before.

381
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,055
Well...

382
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:21,725
cooking.

383
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:25,965
- That'd be nice.
- Yeah, no one's ever cooked for you?

384
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:28,632
My mom, yeah.

385
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:32,132
Your ma. L only have
a basement at my uncle's.

386
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:34,202
Kind of a--

387
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,770
a hotplate.

388
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:39,215
Oh. Oh no, it's-- it's okay.

389
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:40,718
No no.

390
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:43,550
You know,
Clyde and Lucy have a kitchen,

391
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:47,025
so l'm gonna cook for you.

392
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,617
A dinner party?

393
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,150
No.

394
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:52,727
Yeah.

395
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:55,192
Small.

396
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:08,202
So do you feel okay?

397
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:11,216
- L think l'm on drugs.
- Yeah, probably.

398
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,375
(Clears throat)

399
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:17,544
Someone was

400
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,558
pressing up against me.

401
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,651
L could feel he was--

402
00:26:23,695 --> 00:26:25,390
you know?

403
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,762
He was rubbing against me.

404
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:33,168
Oh shit.

405
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,901
- No, that's--
- lt wasn't out.

406
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:42,009
L shouldn't have told you.

407
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:44,913
You'll think of it
when you look at me.

408
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:48,385
No. Lt's not your fault.

409
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:52,651
(Clears throat)

410
00:26:52,691 --> 00:26:54,989
Do you--

411
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:57,655
do you think you might wanna--

412
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:02,066
listen to this song?

413
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,661
Lt's a positive vibe.

414
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:07,433
(Chuckles)

415
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:12,599
There.

416
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:18,542
Some of the words are
hard to get at first so...

417
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:21,776
you have to listen a few times.

418
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:26,380
(Reggae music playing)

419
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,642
Clyde:
You wanna cook for Connie?

420
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:19,610
- Yeah.
- This is something you want to do?

421
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:20,906
Yeah.

422
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:22,208
The problem is
you don't know how to cook.

423
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:24,681
- Yeah.
- (Both laugh)

424
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:26,707
l don't know how to cook.
Lucy doesn't cook.

425
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,913
- Plenty of people don't know.
- Yeah, and l don't know.

426
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:32,554
- Thanks.
- So what's the solution?

427
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:35,219
- L need another beer.
- Mmm.

428
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:39,826
The solution is to have the Cannoli
teach you how to cook a meal.

429
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:42,891
- Who?
- Someone Lucy knows.

430
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:46,370
He's the head pastry cook
at the Waldorf-Astoria--

431
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:48,635
desserts,
but he can cook food too.

432
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:53,007
He can write out a recipe
and teach you how to cook it.

433
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:55,411
- He'll do it?
- He'll do it for Lucy.

434
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:57,244
What do you think
you want to make?

435
00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:02,6 -> 01:02:28,455
lt's French-- French Bordeaux.

435
01:02:32,095 --> 01:02:36,429
- L saw Clyde.
- Yeah, he's out working up an appetite.

436
01:02:36,466 --> 01:02:39,128
Yeah, he wants
to out-eat everyone, l think.

437
01:02:39,169 --> 01:02:43,299
- He's okay, right?
- Yeah. He's...

438
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:47,936
Yeah, he smiled
and said "Hot to trot."

439
01:02:50,246 --> 01:02:52,908
Yeah, he went for a walk.

440
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:56,977
(Clears throat)
"Hot to trot"?

441
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,854
Um, like a compliment, you know?

442
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,585
But he seemed--

443
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:05,116
l don't know--
a little upset first, maybe.

444
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:09,325
Yeah, he went to get out, l think,

445
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:11,925
you know,
get in a more positive vibe.

446
01:03:11,968 --> 01:03:14,459
Yeah yeah yeah.
He gave me a hug even.

447
01:03:14,504 --> 01:03:17,803
A regular hug, right?
L mean you're not saying--

448
01:03:17,841 --> 01:03:20,366
Oh yeah, regular.

449
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,742
He's had a little wine l think so--

450
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:24,110
Connie: Oh.

451
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:28,641
Yeah, he just said,
"Nice cha-chas,"

452
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:30,585
gave me a hug
and said he'd see me in a minute.

453
01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:35,122
Yeah.

454
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:41,054
Yeah, he's okay.

455
01:03:41,097 --> 01:03:43,531
- Wine coming up.
- (Connie whispers) Okay.

456
01:03:43,566 --> 01:03:45,557
(Wine sloshing)

457
01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:58,771
- Here.
- Okay.

458
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:00,806
- (Both chuckle)
- (folk music playing)

459
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:06,118
¶ See what l have. ¶

460
01:04:08,424 --> 01:04:11,416
Yeah. Wow.

461
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:14,521
- A hookah.
- Connie: l've never tried a hookah.

462
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:17,192
First time for everything,
right, Jack?

463
01:04:18,234 --> 01:04:19,758
A special night for special people.

464
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:22,930
Connie's having wine.
Would you like a glass?

465
01:04:22,972 --> 01:04:24,337
Not yet.

466
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:28,170
You look really pretty.
Doesn't she, Jack?

467
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:29,872
Sexy.

468
01:04:29,913 --> 01:04:31,608
Yeah.

469
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:34,406
Wow.

470
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:38,716
¶ You will lift his body
from the shore... ¶

471
01:04:38,755 --> 01:04:40,450
ls it time to take a check on things?

472
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:45,855
¶ Oliver James washed in the rain ¶

473
01:04:46,896 --> 01:04:49,091
¶ No longer... ¶

474
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:52,898
Black hashish.

475
01:04:54,404 --> 01:04:57,305
¶ Oliver James washed
in the rain... ¶

476
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:00,935
l used to get high
with a bagpipe player from Scotland.

477
01:05:00,977 --> 01:05:04,276
He could really take a puff.

478
01:05:06,316 --> 01:05:09,717
¶ On the kitchen table ¶

479
01:05:09,752 --> 01:05:13,950
¶ That your grandfather did make ¶

480
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:17,824

¶ Oliver James washed
in the rain... ¶

483
01:05:25,935 --> 01:05:27,800
The au gratin is turning

484
01:05:27,837 --> 01:05:29,702
the required amber hue--

485
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:33,975
- the critical juncture.
- (Door opens)

486
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,035
- Clyde: Hey hey!

487
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,513
Yo yo.
(Laughs)

488
01:05:38,548 --> 01:05:41,813
- Whoa! Look at my foxy lady.
- Jack: Everything's almost ready so--

489
01:05:41,851 --> 01:05:45,548
- (folk music playing)
- Some after-dinner brandy

490
01:05:45,588 --> 01:05:48,614
that l had to sample to make sure
it was worthy of your fine cuisine.

491
01:05:48,658 --> 01:05:50,489
Okay. Great. Yeah.

492
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:53,154

You're my best friend.

For you and for Connie.
Let me say something.
