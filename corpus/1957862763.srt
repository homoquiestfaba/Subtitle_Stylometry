00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:31,266
Jacob Marley would roll.

185
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:35,058
He was as keen a businessman
as I. A matter of fact, Colin,

186
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:38,308
you used to be a pretty
keen businessman yourself.

187
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:39,641
You did well.

188
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:42,808
All this charity has got to
be eating into your capital.

189
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,350
My business continues to
thrive so I can do good.

190
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:49,266
Business isn't life.

191
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,058
You should come visit
the center, at least

192
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:51,934
see what we're doing.

193
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:53,266
Yeah, I see all right.

194
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:56,933
Loafers, miscreants,
society's outcasts.

195
00:09:56,934 --> 00:10:00,058
I watch out for my
businesses and pay huge taxes

196
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,975
for the privilege of doing so.

197
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,266
Let them look out
for themselves!

198
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:06,766
I believe, gentlemen,
we are finished here.

199
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,516
So I will wish you a
season's greetings.

200
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:13,558
Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah,
Kwanzaa, and druid drivel!

201
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,433
And seasons greetings to you.

202
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:19,308
Sad, pathetic queen!

203
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:20,600
Don't worry, Kyle.

204
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:23,683
Haven't you heard every
time my cash register rings,

205
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:25,683
an angel gets its wings?

206
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:28,976
Now fly on home,
alone, as usual!

207
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,600
We brought cupcakes!

208
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:44,766
[cheering]

209
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,475
Dykes in the house!

210
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:48,308
Hello, suckers!

211
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,850
Hello, lesbos!

212
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,016
Oh, yes!

213
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,975
Don't you homos
have anything better

214
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:54,766
to do this Christmas
Eve than to listen

215
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:56,808
to these two rank amateurs?

216
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,100
Oh, thank you.

217
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,516
My darling Freda,
fashionably dressed as usual

218
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:05,850
in one of your own
little homemade frogs.

219
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:07,100
Oh, you're just jealous.

220
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:08,808
You want to wear this
to midnight mass.

221
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,891
[gasps] My secret's out.

222
00:11:10,892 --> 00:11:12,308
Damn, this is good.

223
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:12,934
Isn't it?

224
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:14,016
Who frosted these?

225
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:14,892
They're amazing.

226
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:17,350
Freda did, but I helped.

227
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,766
Frost this, Freda.

228
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,975
Victor, honey.

229
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:21,976
Put it away.

230
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:22,767
You're scaring the children.

231
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:23,392
My eyes.

232
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:24,017
My eyes!

233
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,391
Wait, where is it?

234
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:25,892
Where is it?

235
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,225
[laughter]

236
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:31,350
It's a small world after all.

237
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:33,975
All right, you two
pieces of trailer trash,

238
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:35,558
it's time to silent the night.

239
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,016
Here Freda, to you come join me.

240
00:11:37,017 --> 00:11:38,017
Everybody sing along.

241
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:39,891
Hit it, Liberace.

242
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:40,892
Here we go!

243
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,475
You all swing in the audience.

244
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:46,184
Very serious.

245
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:47,517
It makes it more fun.

246
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:55,975
Silent night, holy night.

247
00:11:55,976 --> 00:12:01,225
All is calm, all this bright.

248
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:09,226
Sleep in heavenly peace
with the heavenly peace.

249
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:15,642
[applause]

250
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,600
All right, everyone.

251
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:21,476
Good night!

252
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:22,683
Last call, everyone.

253
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:24,766
Drink up, zip up, and meet
me under the mistletoe

254
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,766
before you go.

255
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,184
Mary, you come with me.

256
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:32,725
Merry Christmas, everybody!

257
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:33,975
Merry Christmas, everyone.

258
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:36,516
Happy Hanukkah.

259
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:39,266
[laughter]

260
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,475
Mary, I'll be just
a minute, OK, honey?

261
00:12:41,476 --> 00:12:42,516
Hey, hey, hey.

262
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:45,641
Take your time, honey.

263
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:46,933
Thank you.

264
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:47,851
I'll just hang here
with Randy and Terry.

265
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,559
OK.

266
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,101
I got her.

267
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:49,976
Oh, thank you.

268
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,266
Don't worry, honey.

269
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:52,433
I'll have my Silent
Night Special for you

270
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:53,516
when you're done.

271
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:54,392
Make it two, honey.

272
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:55,059
You got it.

273
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,433
All right, sweetie.

274
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:57,516
Oh, Robert.

275
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:58,641
Freda.

276
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,225
Sweetie!

277
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:02,183
My little cutie pie.

278
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:03,766
How are Drew and the kids?

279
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,683
Oh, they are just fantastic.

280
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,391
I'm sure they're anxiously
awaiting my arrival right now.

281
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:09,683
Yeah.

282
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:10,476
But I didn't dare try and
get out of here any earlier

283
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:11,434
tonight.

284
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:13,141
He is in a
particularly foul mood.

285
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:14,975
Why should tonight
be any different?

286
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:16,016
Oh, that's right.

287
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:17,225
It's Christmas Eve.

288
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:17,767
Huh.

289
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:18,975
Yeah, right.

290
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:20,016
What can I say?

291
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:21,475
He's a jerk, but he's family.

292
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:24,141
And besides, Mary's
on this Buddhist

293
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:26,641
thing about tolerance
and compassion

294
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,100
and love and all that.

295
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:32,016
And maybe one day.

296
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:33,141
I think so.

297
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:34,475
Wish me luck.

298
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:35,059
Good luck.

299
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:35,684
Thank you.

300
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:36,309
Bye.

301
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:36,934
Bye.

302
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:38,600
[knock on door]

303
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,100
Be gone.

304
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,308
Merry Christmas, Uncle Ben.

305
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:45,558
I just popped in to say hello.

306
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,516
I'm still breathing.

307
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:49,975
The ink on my will has
been dry for years.

308
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:53,100
The name Freda is still
resoundingly absent.

309
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:54,141
You may go.

310
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:55,391
No worries.

311
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:58,683
I'm pretty sure you'll
outlive me anyhow.

312
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:03,016
Look, I know you like to keep
Christmas in your own way.

313
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:05,850
But Mary has this
thing about family

314
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:07,350
and a weird soft spot for you.

315
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:10,975
So you're invited
for dinner tomorrow

316
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,016
if you have no other plans.

317
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:15,683
The name Mary is also
in absentia with regards

318
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:17,016
to my estate.

319
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:19,600
Look, I don't expect
anything from you.

320
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:25,350
Mary, on the other hand, only
wants to give you a good meal.

321
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:28,641
What'd you see in her?

322
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:32,725
She is going to be the
mother of my child.

323
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:35,475
My sister had that desire.

324
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:40,016
And lucky you, got to be
born on the day she died.

325
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:43,392
Isn't the symmetry
wonderful for you?

326
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:50,433
Getting senile, Uncle Ben?

327
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:56,391
You seem to get that one out
every single time I see you.

328
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:59,391
Well, if you want to come
tomorrow, dinner is at 4:00.

329
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:00,808
Mary sends her regards.

330
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,683
Send her back her regard anyway.

331
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,475
[inaudible]

332
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:05,476
Get out!

333
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,766
May I take a rain check there?

334
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:14,559
Thanks.

335
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,891
Thanks, Randy.

336
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:16,809
Have a good night.

337
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:17,684
Good night, Terry.

338
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:18,766
[interposing voices]

339
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:21,266
Merry Christmas.

340
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,516
Closing early.

341
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:24,933
And the whole day
tomorrow, Cratchit?

342
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:27,975
That's what you said.

343
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:30,183
You expect me to pay you?

344
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:31,516
Well, it's kind of norm.

345
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:38,100
And actually, I'd
rather if you could...

346
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:40,225
Spit it out.

347
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:42,308
Have you thought about
implementing the health care

348
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,641
plan that I proposed?

349
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,350
It wouldn't cost a
lot for the staff,

350
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:49,475
and my family could really
use the coverage right now.

351
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:52,933
Your family is no concern
of mine, you and your United

352
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:54,641
Nations cast asides.

353
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,975
Take a Christmas Day
and think about how

354
00:15:56,976 --> 00:16:00,141
you would eat without this job.

355
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:03,391
Merry Christmas to
you, Mr. Scrooge.

356
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:06,975
Mock up the drinks another
20% on New Year's Eve.

357
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:09,517
[sighs]

358
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,475
Here you go.

359
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:20,101
Sorry.

360
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:21,683
There's no bonus.

361
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:25,141
The bonus is you get to do your
little music thing for money.

362
00:16:25,142 --> 00:16:25,809
Yeah.

363
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:26,809
Thanks.

364
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,600
Oh, that would be his dinner.

365
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,516
Randy, can you take
it up to him please?

366
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:34,975
Let me guess, hot and sour soup,
one egg roll, small fried rice,

367
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:37,600
no MSG?

368
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:38,434
Yeah.

369
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:39,933
Heaven forbid he should explode.

370
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:42,683
You got to have a heart in
order to have a heart attack.

371
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:43,684
Amen.

372
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:48,891
Here's your dinner.

373
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:51,016
Did you tip the delivery man?

374
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:52,141
Of course.

375
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:53,266
Fool.

376
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:55,391
I gave you exact change.

377
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:56,683
I use my own money.

378
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:57,975
I can spare it.

379
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,641
Well, since you have so much
extra money lying around,

380
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:03,558
this would be a perfect
time to decrease your wages.

381
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,351
Hey!

382
00:17:04,352 --> 00:17:05,516
I'll cut you all together.

383
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,975
I've seen you giving
out free drinks.

384
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,183
I can get another job.

385
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:10,600
I have a following
you wouldn't miss.

386
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,891
Oh, I hope they enjoy
the drive to Paducah.

387
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,725
I can make sure you won't
find any place closer.

388
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:17,725
And the way you've been
showing your age lately,

389
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:22,016
I doubt you could get employment
in a leather bar, in Paducah.

390
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:23,642
You better start packing.

391
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:27,101
Paducah?

392
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:31,683
Apparently I'm fired.

393
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,725
And old.

394
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,391
I'll fix it.

395
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:35,975
Maybe this time I don't care.

396
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:37,766
Maybe I'm tired of this fool.

397
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:38,726
I'll fix it.

398
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:39,808
Just finish closing
up, all right?

399
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,933
It's going to be OK.

400
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,933
Hey Bob, do you want
to hear the new song?

401
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:44,183
I can't.

402
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:45,142
I got to get home to
Drew and the kids.

403
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:46,725
We're waiting for Santa.

404
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:47,351
Merry Christmas.

405
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:48,101
Merry Christmas.

406
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:49,350
Merry Christmas.

407
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:50,516
You know what?

408
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:52,016
Randy, get one
more for everybody.

409
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,225
On the house?

410
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:55,516
On me.

411
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:57,975
Hey Randy, do you want to
hear the new Christmas song?

412
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,933
I'd love to.

413
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:02,851
[music playing]

414
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:12,266
Christmas Eve is coming soon.

415
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:15,641
Candles flicker blue.

416
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:22,558
Carolers in red and green
singing neath the moon.

417
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:29,391
Dreams are dreamed by young
and old, memories come to life.

418
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:35,433
Peace on Earth seems possible
round the world tonight.

419
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:41,808
Noel, can you hear
the angel's call.

420
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:48,975
Noel, calling out
to one and all.

421
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:56,976
The world of make-believe
comes true on Christmas Eve.

422
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:10,600
Christmas night is here at last.

423
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:13,975
Let your hopes run high.

424
00:19:13,976 --> 00:19:19,975
Open minds and open hearts
need not question why.

425
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:26,391
Noel, can you hear
the angel's call?

426
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:33,808
Noel, coming out to one and all.

427
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:41,809
The world of make-believe
comes true on Christmas Eve.

428
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:54,934
The world of make-believe
comes true on Christmas Eve.

429
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:06,892
God rest ye merry gentlemen.

430
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,726
[wind blows]

431
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:23,684
Ridiculous.

432
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:56,934
[footsteps approaching]

433
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:26,933
Ben Scrooge!

434
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:27,934
Let me in!

435
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:35,809
[gasps]

436
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:41,808
Go away.

437
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:43,433
Get out.

438
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:44,516
Ben.

439
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:46,100
How'd you get in?

440
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:47,600
I have an alarm system.

441
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:50,641
Ben, look at me.

442
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,600
You can't be who you look like.

443
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:54,141
He's been dead for 10 years.

444
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:55,266
Do... do... don't.

445
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:57,266
Don't come any closer.

446
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:58,600
The police are on their way.

447
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,600
They are not.

448
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:03,100
I'm a ghost, Ebenezer!

449
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:04,475
Nobody calls me Ebenezer.

450
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:06,391
I did.

451
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,600
Jacob?

452
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:10,641
Jacob Marley?

453
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:12,391
Impossible.

454
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:13,933
I don't believe in ghosts.

455
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:16,391
You don't believe
in love either,

456
00:22:16,392 --> 00:22:18,058
even though you once felt it.

457
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:22,933
You're only an
illusion, a nightmare,

458
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:27,266
a jolting of my neurons
exacerbated by a bad meal.

459
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:29,266
I specified no MSG.

460
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:30,600
OK.

461
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,183
It's a nightmare.

462
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:37,683
So in this nightmare, which
in reality, is reality,

463
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:41,725
you are being visited by moi.

464
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:44,100
I'll indulge you for the moment.

465
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:48,016
I'll concede that you are
the ghost of Jacob Marley.

466
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:49,766
Why haunt me?

467
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:52,266
I'm here to warn you.

468
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:57,266
These are the chains I have
to bear through all eternity!

469
00:22:57,267 --> 00:23:02,225
Each link forged by an
evil deed or thought.

470
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:03,059
Look at me.

471
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,600
Weighted down.

472
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:08,100
You're no better than me.

473
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:09,600
Than I.

474
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:13,391
Grammatically
correct, as always.

475
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:18,766
Oh, Ebenezer, I've been dragging
through the ether for 10 years,

476
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,350
reliving all the
awful things I did.

477
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:23,350
We did.

478
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:26,808
And you've had 10 more years
to add to your baggage.

479
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,600
What awful things?

480
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,100
We did business.

481
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:33,766
Doing business is
not doing living.

482
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,975
I want you to see that
you still have time

483
00:23:35,976 --> 00:23:38,600
to save yourself from this.

484
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:40,975
I'm not concerned
with any savings

485
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:42,433
that don't accrue interest.

486
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:46,558
Now be gone.

487
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,725
You have no power here.

488
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:50,475
That's what you think.

489
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:53,391
There's always a loophole.

490
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:54,392
Scrooge!

491
00:23:56,934 --> 00:24:00,933
Ebenezer Scrooge, before
this night is over,

492
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:05,058
you will be visited
by three spirits.

493
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:08,516
Each of them will reveal
certain truths to you.

494
00:24:08,517 --> 00:24:12,059
Heed them before it is too late.

495
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:02,059
Ben Scrooge!

496
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:07,100
Ben Scrooge!

497
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:11,183
Get your tiresome self out
of that godawful sleeper sofa

498
00:25:11,184 --> 00:25:14,516
and acknowledge the
presence of a divinity.

499
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:16,058
Marley?

500
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:19,350
I told you to get out of my
apartment and out of my dreams.

501
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,225
Now go.

502
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:22,226
Randy.

503
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,391
I fired you.

504
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,600
Get out.

505
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:30,766
No can do.

506
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,141
Let me explain.

507
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:35,891
On my off hours, I'm the
ghost of Christmas Past.

508
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:38,766
Sometimes just the
ghost of the past.

509
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:40,600
You're a ghost?

510
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:43,516
How much MSG was
in that egg roll?

511
00:25:43,517 --> 00:25:44,975
How is that possible?

512
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,225
How is it possible that you're
such a miserable example

513
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:48,226
of humanity?

514
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:49,475
Who knows.

515
00:25:49,476 --> 00:25:50,933
Oh, wait.

516
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:52,891
We're actually going to
answer that question tonight.

517
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:56,058
So let's get started, shall we?

518
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:59,683
Ben Scrooge, I've been
sent here to guide you

519
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:04,100
to some meaningful
times of your past.

520
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:05,766
So let's get this
show on the road.

521
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,434
I have an evangelical I
need to see in two hours.

522
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:14,226
How?

523
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:15,101
What...

524
00:26:15,102 --> 00:26:16,266
Time travel.

525
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,225
It's all the rage.

526
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:19,350
Poppers?

527
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:20,766
It's the '70s.

528
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,350
What else did you expect?

529
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:23,933
Now hush up.

530
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:27,975
Not that anyone here
can see or hear us.

531
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:31,516
Oh, you were so cute.

532
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:32,434
Queer.

533
00:26:32,434 --> 00:26:33,434
Tinkerbell.

534
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,558
You staying at school for
Christmas again this year?

535
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,101
[chatter]

536
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,601
Oh, look.

537
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,517
Here's your first crush.

538
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:45,517
Quiet.

539
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,725
Still no sign of the old man?

540
00:26:53,726 --> 00:26:54,517
He won't come.

541
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:56,391
He hates me.

542
00:26:56,392 --> 00:26:57,808
So it's two weeks.

543
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:00,308
I'll be back before you know it.

544
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:01,142
Ben!

545
00:27:01,142 --> 00:27:01,809
Franny!

546
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:02,434
God.

547
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:03,101
Hi.

548
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:05,558
Hi.

549
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,933
Fred, this is my sister, Franny.

550
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:07,809
I told you about her.

551
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:08,434
Hi.

552
00:27:08,435 --> 00:27:09,475
Hi.

553
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:10,683
It's nice to meet you.

554
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:11,975
Nice to meet you.

555
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:13,475
Ben, dad says you can
come home this year.

556
00:27:13,476 --> 00:27:15,516
He let me take the car
to come and get you.

557
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:16,267
Yeah, really?

558
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:16,976
Yes.

559
00:27:16,977 --> 00:27:18,141
Only Ben, please behave.

560
00:27:18,142 --> 00:27:20,475
You do some things
that irritate him.

561
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:22,808
That's my ride.

562
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,100
Listen, maybe I'll stop
by over the holidays.

563
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:27,226
We'd love to see you.

564
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:32,516
Oh, Ben, we're
really going to have

565
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,809
a good Christmas this year.

[music - "silent night"]

567
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:52,059
(SINGING) Silent
night, holy night.

568
00:27:53,976 --> 00:28:00,017
All is calm, all is bright.

569
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,016
Father, this is Brent
Hartford, a friend from school.

570
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:07,642
Hey, Franny.

571
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:08,476
Hey.

572
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:09,683
Hartford.

573
00:28:09,684 --> 00:28:10,891
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

574
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:12,100
You might know my father.

575
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:14,391
He has a couple of
car dealerships.

576
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,016
Yes, of course.

577
00:28:16,017 --> 00:28:18,100
I've seen his commercials.

578
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:19,475
I'll bet you work
hard for him too.

579
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:21,183
It's about time you
had a friend that

580
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:24,475
understands the importance
of business and making money.

581
00:28:24,476 --> 00:28:28,891
Maybe you can teach my son,
the dreamer, a thing or two.

582
00:28:28,892 --> 00:28:30,058
I'll try.

583
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,391
I came over to see
if Ben would like

584
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:33,558
to come to a dance at
my folks' country club.

585
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,433
There's a girl that I
dig, but her parents

586
00:28:36,434 --> 00:28:39,391
say that we can't go unless we
double date with her cousin.

587
00:28:39,392 --> 00:28:40,641
Well.

588
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:43,725
Well, I think Ben could
help you out with your date.

589
00:28:43,726 --> 00:28:44,850
Great.

590
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:49,141
My girl's cousin
is really groovy.

591
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:53,516
I have some pictures
I'd like to show Ben.

592
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:59,225
Pictures of other girls that
he might want to look at, sir.

593
00:28:59,226 --> 00:29:01,975
Run along upstairs then, boys.

594
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:02,726
See you, Franny.

595
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:04,308
Uh-huh.

Pictures of girls?

00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:18,434
I had to tell him
something, didn't I?

599
00:29:22,476 --> 00:29:27,308
If the lie makes him
happy, then all the better.

Thank God your mother
didn't live to see this!

get back in this house.

Do you hear me?

616
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:16,308
I will never see you again.

Stop, dad!

He's a freak!

00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:43,225
Sure.

You're new.

I've been around.

Yeah, around the playground.

Is that around enough for you?

I'm just saying you look fresh.

646

And fresh doesn't
last long in here.

I can manage.

This is Ben, Fezziwig.

the waters and thought

00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:15,891
he'd be a better swimmer here.

00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:29,391
Also not a safe place.

And this is where we do
all our entertainment.

are lots of rooms

tasteful pictures

cannot overemphasize physical

open up your pores.

gentlemen will meet... oh,

No services, mind you.

00:35:25,434 --> 00:35:28,641
Discretion is the
better part of allure.

Use it all the time.

Use your vocabulary.

00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:40,183
Words, Ben.

736
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:42,642
Words will be your
tools, your weapons.

737
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:49,308
I am in the arts and
entertainment business, Ben.

738
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:52,266
And all of my babies
have been taken off

739
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:54,350
of those nasty streets.

740
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:59,975
All of my babies are
safe and warm and hot.

741
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:03,600
See Ben, you can make a lot more
in a place like this than you

742
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:06,766
can down at the park, making
macaroni and cheese money with

743
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:07,351
you're...

744
00:36:07,352 --> 00:36:08,475
Language, Jacob.

745
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:13,683
Use vocabulary, never language.

746
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:15,350
Well, we need a
little Christmas.

747
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:17,767
[laughter]

748
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:23,975
One for him, one for us.

749
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:25,808
Partners.

750
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:26,351
He knows.

751
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,891
He doesn't care.

752
00:36:27,892 --> 00:36:30,683
We can run blind as long as
you give him what he wants.

753
00:36:30,684 --> 00:36:33,975
Well, that is a joyous noel.

754
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:35,100
Look at this piece.

755
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:36,600
I never knew I had it.

756
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:38,475
We must show it to the assembly.

757
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:40,100
Come along, Ben.

758
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:42,141
I'll catch up.

759
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:44,183
[laughter]

760
00:36:44,184 --> 00:36:47,142
[cheering]

761
00:36:57,517 --> 00:37:00,058
So you want to work here?

762
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,933
Yes, please.

763
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:04,308
[laughs] Dance.

764
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:05,017
Oh, wait.

765
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:06,225
Come back.

766
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:08,600
Got to give you a little
something to fluff you up

767
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,641
because you look naked.

768
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:12,808
All right, Isadora, go for it.

769
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:15,934
And don't stick your head out
the car window like last time.

770
00:37:27,726 --> 00:37:28,726
Bill.

771
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:34,433
I'm Bill.

772
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:35,558
I'm Ben.

773
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,101
[laughter]

774
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:46,517
I feel like Christmas morning!

775
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:57,434
[sighs]

776
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:02,642
My first Christmas together.

777
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:08,391
Play it again, darling.

778
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:09,309
It's OK.

779
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,475
I'm getting used to it.

780
00:38:10,476 --> 00:38:11,891
Christmas.

781
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:13,975
Extra money for idiotic
decorations that are more

782
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:17,141
work putting up then taking
down than they're worth.

783
00:38:17,142 --> 00:38:18,391
Flimsy breakable...

784
00:38:18,392 --> 00:38:21,183
Ben, what's the matter?

785
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:25,183
You can't be upset about
$20 worth of ornaments.

786
00:38:25,184 --> 00:38:26,516
My sister, Franny.

787
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:28,933
She died.

788
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:29,726
Oh, my God.

789
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:31,433
She died during childbirth.

790
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,142
Apparently I now have
a niece named Freda.

791
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:38,141
If it hadn't been for
that baby, she would...

792
00:38:38,142 --> 00:38:42,266
Ben, you can't blame a baby.

793
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:46,308
She was the only person who
loved me no matter what.

794
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:47,975
No matter what, she loved me.

795
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:50,058
I love you.

796
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:52,600
You know I do.

797
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:54,975
No matter what?

798
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,016
No matter what.

799
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:57,017
Of course I do.

800
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:03,933
Let's see what we can do
about that niece of yours.

801
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:04,726
I would.

802
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:06,308
For Franny's sake, I would.

803
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:10,766
But according to this letter
from my father, the first one

804
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:14,683
he's written me since
he threw me out,

805
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:21,808
I am specifically instructed
to stay away and not

806
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:29,809
stain the family's honor with
the stench of my depravity.

807
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:34,517
And then he goes on to add a
few more equally paternal words.

808
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:47,058
No matter what.

809
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:48,100
No matter what.

810
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:51,059
[music playing]

811
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,141
No matter what.

812
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:10,100
Hi, honey.

813
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:12,266
Dinner's ruined.

814
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:14,766
Oh, I'm sure it's good enough.

815
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:16,933
Waste not, want not.

816
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:18,391
Have a good meeting with Marley?

817
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:19,392
Pretty and smart.

818
00:40:24,684 --> 00:40:28,058
Ben, I worry about
you and Marley.

819
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,641
He's... he's...

820
00:40:30,642 --> 00:40:32,808
He's what?

821
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:35,600
Well, you've always known
that I always thought

822
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:38,391
he was a little too sly.

823
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:39,933
And you want me to be careful.

824
00:40:39,934 --> 00:40:40,767
I know.

825
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:43,183
Yes, I'm dancing with the devil.

826
00:40:43,184 --> 00:40:47,391
But I'm sleeping with
an angel, aren't I?

827
00:40:47,392 --> 00:40:48,808
It all evens out in the end.

828
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:50,516
Besides, making him
my business partner

829
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:51,850
is the smartest
thing I could do.

830
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:54,725
Bill, my love, we're
going to be rich,

831
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:57,808
if you don't keep
burning grocery, man.

832
00:40:57,809 --> 00:41:02,100
Well, if you're going to
be getting more money,

833
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:03,808
maybe we move to a nicer place.

834
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:04,933
Why'd we leave here?

835
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:06,766
It's rent free,
as long as I keep

836
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,600
an eye on Fezziwig's business.

837
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:12,141
And believe me,
got my eye on it.

838
00:41:12,142 --> 00:41:15,684
[music playing]

839
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,976
[interposing voices]

840
00:41:29,684 --> 00:41:31,308
For me?

841
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:32,725
Oh, you shouldn't have.

842
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:35,059
But I hate a family [inaudible].

843
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:41,516
There you are.

844
00:41:41,517 --> 00:41:44,684
[chatter]

845
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:55,934
[music playing]

846
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:19,267
[chatter]

847
00:43:58,434 --> 00:44:00,808
I don't understand, boys.

848
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:02,725
I don't understand at all.

849
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:03,850
It's simple.

850
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:05,100
You followed my
investment advice.

851
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,808
You sign the papers
I ask you to sign.

852
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:09,558
And now we own you.

853
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:10,850
How is that possible?

854
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:13,141
Well, there's always a loophole.

855
00:44:13,142 --> 00:44:15,516
Don't you just love loopholes?

856
00:44:15,517 --> 00:44:17,641
And now we are retiring you.

857
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:20,975
But you leave me with nothing.

858
00:44:20,976 --> 00:44:24,683
Ben, I was so good to you.

859
00:44:24,684 --> 00:44:25,850
You're educated.

860
00:44:25,851 --> 00:44:27,975
I took you in,
you're successful.

861
00:44:27,976 --> 00:44:30,058
It's all because of me.

862
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:32,350
Look how well you taught me.

863
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:37,141
It's time to prune back the
dying branches of shriveled,

864
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:40,183
old dying branches.

865
00:44:40,184 --> 00:44:42,225
This is everything I have.

866
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:43,226
Had.

867
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,766
Where shall I go?

868
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,683
How can you be so heartless?

869
00:44:51,684 --> 00:44:54,600
I was so good to both of you.

870
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:56,016
I don't know.

871
00:44:56,017 --> 00:44:57,808
Don't you have an old troll
friend down in the Keys?

872
00:44:57,809 --> 00:45:00,391
[laughter]

873
00:45:00,392 --> 00:45:01,558
OK.

874
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:02,559
Out you go.

875
00:45:07,476 --> 00:45:10,476
[sobs]

876
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:24,141
It was purely business.

877
00:45:24,142 --> 00:45:27,391
It wasn't purely business
when he took you in.

878
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,975
For his own profit.

879
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:33,225
He was using me, using
Jake, using us for our looks

880
00:45:33,226 --> 00:45:35,766
and a lot of other things
I'd rather not remember.

881
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:39,600
He was paying you a fair wage
and teaching you the business.

882
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:41,141
He was caring for you.

883
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:42,891
So he could care.

884
00:45:42,892 --> 00:45:45,516
Caring doesn't pay the bills.

885
00:45:45,517 --> 00:45:47,016
No, it doesn't.

886
00:45:47,017 --> 00:45:50,017
But it might just
be what saves you.

887
00:45:58,601 --> 00:46:00,933
We don't need to go here.

888
00:46:00,934 --> 00:46:02,641
I don't.

889
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:03,642
But you do.

890
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:14,600
Sorry I'm late.

891
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:15,850
Yep.

892
00:46:15,851 --> 00:46:17,100
You're late, again.

893
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:18,850
You'll never believe
what happened today.

894
00:46:18,851 --> 00:46:20,433
I know what happened today.

895
00:46:20,434 --> 00:46:21,475
I have a telephone.

896
00:46:21,476 --> 00:46:24,100
You killed what was
left of Fezziwig.

897
00:46:24,101 --> 00:46:25,766
That's a little over the top.

898
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:26,975
Jake and I leveraged some cash.

899
00:46:26,976 --> 00:46:28,725
We bought the old man out.

900
00:46:28,726 --> 00:46:29,975
You sold out.

901
00:46:29,976 --> 00:46:32,850
You sold out your friendship!

902
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:35,975
You sold out your soul!

903
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:36,976
What's all this?

904
00:46:40,101 --> 00:46:41,101
I'm leaving.

905
00:46:44,642 --> 00:46:45,309
No.

906
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:46,101
You can't.

907
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:47,226
You said, no matter what.

908
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:55,641
I said that to a
man, a different man.

909
00:46:55,642 --> 00:46:56,725
No matter what.

910
00:46:56,726 --> 00:46:59,475
I said that to a
man who I loved,

911
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:02,141
a man who still had the decency
to cry over his sister's

912
00:47:02,142 --> 00:47:05,141
death, who gave a crap.

913
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:11,058
But now, you're an automaton
for money, a steamroller.

914
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:13,433
Fezziwig... did you
have to do it that way?

915
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:15,058
That's business.

916
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:16,141
That's Marley.

917
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:18,183
Are you actually
jealous of Jake?

918
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:20,308
You know that with
Marley, it's all business.

919
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:21,059
Right.

920
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,475
Business, money, Marley.

921
00:47:23,476 --> 00:47:24,267
You promised me.

922
00:47:24,268 --> 00:47:26,516
You made promises too.

923
00:47:26,517 --> 00:47:29,683
But for months, years,
I look into your eyes,

924
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:32,141
and I see are dollar signs.

925
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:33,683
I want something more.

926
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,350
What more is there?

927
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:38,933
Can you stop what you're doing?

928
00:47:38,934 --> 00:47:40,683
Can you stop the
wheeling and dealing?

929
00:47:40,684 --> 00:47:43,225
Can you stop what you
and Marley have started?

930
00:47:43,226 --> 00:47:44,683
What is there to stop?

931
00:47:44,684 --> 00:47:48,100
Stop making money, stop
providing you a home,

932
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:50,641
stop doing what I do
better than anyone?

933
00:47:50,642 --> 00:47:52,225
I don't care about money.

934
00:47:52,226 --> 00:47:53,850
Everyone cares about money.

935
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:56,975
Well, not the way you do!

936
00:47:56,976 --> 00:47:59,016
And you certainly
don't care about me

937
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:00,392
the way you care about money.

938
00:48:02,892 --> 00:48:03,892
So I'm leaving you.

939
00:48:03,892 --> 00:48:04,851
I've made up my mind.

940
00:48:04,851 --> 00:48:05,559
I'm leaving.

941
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,558

Change?

943
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:13,683
Do you know what
change is to you?

944
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:17,558
Change is little pieces
of metal that you pick up

945
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:22,225
off the ground, kiss,
and put in your pocket.

946
00:48:22,226 --> 00:48:25,725
I want a home.

I want a family.

You want a family?

To hell with family.

to by blood that

can't stand the sight of you.

952

I don't even know.

but it's too much.

I did love him,
more than anything.

960
00:49:58,934 --> 00:50:04,558
Then why didn't you see him when
he was sick, before he died?

961
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,100
I didn't know he was sick.

00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,766
There's a woman on the phone
that says she's Bill's sister?

So?

967
00:50:24,184 --> 00:50:27,141
She says that Bill is ill, very
ill, and he's asking for you.

00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:36,642
Ready?

1097
00:57:38,976 --> 00:57:39,559
Oh, God.

1098
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:40,434
There she goes.

1099
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:41,683
She's prepping.

1100
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:44,058
"Hunchback of Notre-Dame."

1101
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:44,642
Quasimodo.

1102
00:57:44,642 --> 00:57:45,434
Is it Quasimodo?

1103
00:57:45,434 --> 00:57:46,142
One word.

1104
00:57:46,142 --> 00:57:46,642
One word.

1105
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:49,308
One word.

1106
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:50,059
Poker?

1107
00:57:50,059 --> 00:57:50,767
What is that?

1108
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:52,141
Ugly sad poker player.

1109
00:57:52,142 --> 00:57:52,642
Aquaman.

1110
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:53,725
Filing her nail.

1111
00:57:53,726 --> 00:57:55,308
Is she a...

1112
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:57,308
Psycho!

1113
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:58,309
Oh.

1114
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:00,266
Oh, that's something different.

1115
00:58:00,267 --> 00:58:00,684
Dracula.

1116
00:58:00,684 --> 00:58:01,559
Dracula.

1117
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:02,434
No, it's Cher.

1118
00:58:02,434 --> 00:58:03,059
Gigi!

1119
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:03,476
Cher!

1120
00:58:03,477 --> 00:58:04,891
Cher!

1121
00:58:04,892 --> 00:58:06,891
Oh, you're terrible.

1122
00:58:06,892 --> 00:58:08,308
It's my Uncle Scrooge.

1123
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:12,100
You got it [inaudible]
Mr. Sparkling Personality.

1124
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:13,892
Oh, that's Scrooge, all right.

1125
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:19,183
I knew if I just looked
sour, you'd never get it.

1126
00:58:19,184 --> 00:58:24,391
But if I pantomime that
holier than thou way he talks,

1127
00:58:24,392 --> 00:58:26,016
you'd get it in 10 seconds flat.

1128
00:58:26,017 --> 00:58:28,100
Why does he do that, Freda?

1129
00:58:28,101 --> 00:58:29,308
Oh, honey.

1130
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:31,350
Who can figure everybody's
favorite sour puss out?

1131
00:58:31,351 --> 00:58:34,308
Everybody's favorite sour
puss just fired Randy.

1132
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:35,184
What?

1133
00:58:35,184 --> 00:58:35,684
Seriously.

1134
00:58:35,684 --> 00:58:36,392
Today?

1135
00:58:36,392 --> 00:58:37,184
I was there.

1136
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:38,017
I witnessed.

1137
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:39,350
I think he meant it this time.

1138
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:40,891
On Christmas Eve?

1139
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,308
Why would Christmas Eve be
different than any other night?

1140
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:46,516
Bob says he can fix it,
but I don't think he can.

1141
00:58:46,517 --> 00:58:48,183
I feel bad for Randy though.

1142
00:58:48,184 --> 00:58:51,016
I do too, but I also
feel bad for Scrooge.

1143
00:58:51,017 --> 00:58:52,433
Oh, you don't mean that.

1144
00:58:52,434 --> 00:58:53,975
You can't.

1145
00:58:53,976 --> 00:58:56,016
I've worked for that cheap
jerk for the last three years.

1146
00:58:56,017 --> 00:58:59,141
And believe me, the minute
I find another steady gig,

1147
00:58:59,142 --> 00:58:59,767
I'm history.

1148
00:58:59,768 --> 00:59:01,266
He can't help it.

1149
00:59:01,267 --> 00:59:03,308
The guy needs something other
than his cold hard cash.

1150
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:04,391
And buy him a cat.

1151
00:59:04,392 --> 00:59:06,558
But be prepared to
pay for the food too.

1152
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,850
When I look at Scrooge, I
see a terribly lonely man

1153
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:11,933
in desperate need of compassion.

1154
00:59:11,934 --> 00:59:14,433
You've had too much
eggnog, methinks.

1155
00:59:14,434 --> 00:59:15,434
It's her Buddhist thing.

1156
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:16,475
No, I mean it.

1157
00:59:16,476 --> 00:59:18,100
I really do.

1158
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:21,391
It's the season of peace.

1159
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:22,725
So...

1160
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,891
Oh, honey.

1161
00:59:24,892 --> 00:59:28,558
...a toast to Scrooge.

1162
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,391
A toast to that
bitter old queen?

1163
00:59:30,392 --> 00:59:32,016
Hey!

1164
00:59:32,017 --> 00:59:35,225
Mary is requesting,
and I am commanding.

1165
00:59:35,226 --> 00:59:38,475
Raise those glasses
high and listen up.

1166
00:59:38,476 --> 00:59:39,975
Thank you, dear.

1167
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,600
You're forcefulness was part
of my initial attraction,

1168
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:42,392
you know.

1169
00:59:42,393 --> 00:59:43,600
And my eyes?

1170
00:59:43,601 --> 00:59:44,766
And your eyes.

1171
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,601
Of course.

1172
00:59:45,602 --> 00:59:47,266
[laughter]

1173
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:49,600
A toast to Scrooge.

1174
00:59:49,601 --> 00:59:50,476
Yes.

1175
00:59:50,477 --> 00:59:52,266
To Uncle Scrooge.

1176
00:59:52,267 --> 00:59:55,016
He wouldn't take a
Merry Christmas from us

1177
00:59:55,017 --> 00:59:56,308
unless we paid him.

1178
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:59,225
And since Christmas
joy is free of charge,

1179
00:59:59,226 --> 01:00:02,100
we're going to give it to him
anyway whether he likes it

1180
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:03,600
or not.

1181
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:04,641
To Scrooge.

1182
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,767
To Scrooge.

1183
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:10,350
Why would she
deign to defend me?

1184
01:00:10,351 --> 01:00:11,766
You heard her.

1185
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:12,767
You're family.

1186
01:00:12,768 --> 01:00:15,100
She wants you in her life.

1187
01:00:15,101 --> 01:00:19,100
I thought she just
coveted my portfolio.

1188
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:21,766
You know, someday he'll
come around, and maybe

1189
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:22,933
after the baby's born.

1190
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:24,641
Yes, maybe then.

1191
01:00:24,642 --> 01:00:25,517
Yeah.

1192
01:00:25,518 --> 01:00:26,641
OK.

1193
01:00:26,642 --> 01:00:29,266
Now let's hear Freda do a song.

1194
01:00:29,267 --> 01:00:31,225
[applause]

1195
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:32,475
Fine.

1196
01:00:32,476 --> 01:00:33,476
Fine.

1197
01:00:33,477 --> 01:00:35,141
Twist my pinkie.

1198
01:00:35,142 --> 01:00:36,475
[laughter]

1199
01:00:36,476 --> 01:00:39,100
OK.

[MUSIC - "I'M A CHRISTMAS KIND
OF BABY"]

1201
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:47,142
Where is Christmas?

1202
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:55,183
Where is Christmas?

1203
01:00:55,184 --> 01:01:00,934
Sure don't feel
like Christmas time.

1204
01:01:08,392 --> 01:01:14,808
I'm a Christmas kind of baby,
need my baby at Christmas time.

1205
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:17,600
I said that I'm a
Christmas kind of baby,

1206
01:01:17,601 --> 01:01:20,101
need my baby at Christmas time.

1207
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:24,850
If my baby ain't
around, it's going

1208
01:01:24,851 --> 01:01:27,142
to be a Santa kind of crime.

1209
01:01:30,017 --> 01:01:33,058
What good is all this?

1210
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:35,891
Why do these fools fill up
their sorry little souls

1211
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,683
with frivolous...

1212
01:01:38,684 --> 01:01:40,017
Because they have heart.

1213
01:01:43,851 --> 01:01:50,016
I said if my baby's
not around, it

1214
01:01:50,017 --> 01:01:54,267
don't feel like Christmas time.

1215
01:01:57,434 --> 01:01:58,434
Oh, yeah.

1216
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:14,683
Maybe... OK, I see.

1217
01:02:14,684 --> 01:02:16,558
You want me to hire Randy back.

1218
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,058
Fine.

1219
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:20,558
And I need to be nicer to
Mary and Freda and everyone

1220
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,267
that Scrooge.

1221
01:02:21,267 --> 01:02:21,976
Got it.

1222
01:02:21,976 --> 01:02:22,892
Checked off the list.

1223
01:02:22,893 --> 01:02:24,475
Now take me back home.

1224
01:02:24,476 --> 01:02:29,600
All this kindness and good
cheer's working my last nerve.

learned the spirit of Christmas

You know, we got to
hurry this along.

They don't give me
much time, you know.

1229
01:02:40,601 --> 01:02:41,975
I heard you were a fast learner.

1230
01:02:41,976 --> 01:02:44,766

the pace, bucko.

We've been waiting for you.

01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:22,017
Hold on.

1278
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:22,976
I know.

1279
01:05:22,977 --> 01:05:24,516
It's arts and crafts, yes.

1280
01:05:24,517 --> 01:05:26,475
We're doing some daddy
timeout right now.

1281
01:05:26,476 --> 01:05:28,308
So Ruby, you're in charge.

1282
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:30,434
Tim, don't burn anything.

1283
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:36,475
You look beat.

1284
01:05:36,476 --> 01:05:38,141
Scrooge is in a
rare form tonight.

1285
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:39,600
No, no, no.

1286
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:40,933
I don't want to hear a
single syllable about that...

1287
01:05:40,934 --> 01:05:42,308
Language.

1288
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:46,933
...very difficult human being.

1289
01:05:46,934 --> 01:05:48,266
Thank you.

1290
01:05:48,267 --> 01:05:49,391
I always have to work
in a place that toxic.

1291
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:51,141
It's only toxic because of him.

1292
01:05:51,142 --> 01:05:52,725
I can manage.

1293
01:05:52,726 --> 01:05:54,266
In case you haven't noticed,
we have a few mouths to feed.

1294
01:05:54,267 --> 01:05:55,725
I can go full time.

1295
01:05:55,726 --> 01:05:56,517
No.

1296
01:05:56,518 --> 01:05:58,308
Tim needs you here at home.

1297
01:05:58,309 --> 01:05:59,808
You shouldn't have
to work at all.

1298
01:05:59,809 --> 01:06:01,308
The kids need you.

1299
01:06:01,309 --> 01:06:04,975
Well, we're going to have
a conversation about this.

1300
01:06:04,976 --> 01:06:05,976
One more?

1301
01:06:08,142 --> 01:06:10,725
But... but not now.

1302
01:06:10,726 --> 01:06:11,309
Right.

1303
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:12,309
Not tonight.

1304
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:15,976
It's Christmas Eve.

1305
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:16,767
Wow!

1306
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:19,517
[laughter]

1307
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:22,266
Wow.

1308
01:06:22,267 --> 01:06:24,933
I thought I threw
all of those out.

1309
01:06:24,934 --> 01:06:25,642
You missed one.

1310
01:06:25,643 --> 01:06:26,850
I did.

1311
01:06:26,851 --> 01:06:28,516
And I'm glad you found it.

1312
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:29,808
Wow.

1313
01:06:29,809 --> 01:06:30,642
Ta-daa.

1314
01:06:30,643 --> 01:06:31,725
Wow.

1315
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:33,808
I don't even want to
know where you got that.

1316
01:06:33,809 --> 01:06:37,016
Aren't we supposed to
don now our gay apparel?

1317
01:06:37,017 --> 01:06:41,933
You have donned off
our gay apparel.

1318
01:06:41,934 --> 01:06:45,183
That's how he spends my money.

1319
01:06:45,184 --> 01:06:48,141
He certainly doesn't
spend it on his home.

1320
01:06:48,142 --> 01:06:50,641
I pay him a living wage.

1321
01:06:50,642 --> 01:06:54,016
Of course, if he has to
adopt every orphan that

1322
01:06:54,017 --> 01:06:57,266
looks at him sideways, well,
that's no business of mine.

1323
01:06:57,267 --> 01:07:01,016
Yes, I'm sure the state
orphanages are so much more

1324
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,517
homey than Drew and Bob's.

1325
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:07,016
So we might have a development.

1326
01:07:07,017 --> 01:07:08,183
What's that?

1327
01:07:08,184 --> 01:07:09,475
Scrooge is not
going to implement

1328
01:07:09,476 --> 01:07:11,016
the health plan I proposed.

1329
01:07:11,017 --> 01:07:11,976
[laughs]

1330
01:07:11,977 --> 01:07:13,266
It's OK.

1331
01:07:13,267 --> 01:07:14,641
We'll manage.

1332
01:07:14,642 --> 01:07:15,392
Yeah.

1333
01:07:15,393 --> 01:07:20,225
But how... you're too kind.

1334
01:07:20,226 --> 01:07:22,766
You're just too kind.

1335
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:23,767
I'll show you kind.

1336
01:07:23,767 --> 01:07:24,767
OK.

1337
01:07:27,226 --> 01:07:28,184
What?

1338
01:07:28,184 --> 01:07:29,059
[laughs]

1339
01:07:29,059 --> 01:07:29,726
Oh, no.

1340
01:07:29,726 --> 01:07:30,226
Oh, yes.

1341
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:30,851
Oh, no.

1342
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:31,267
Oh, yes.

1343
01:07:31,267 --> 01:07:31,892
Oh, no.

1344
01:07:31,892 --> 01:07:32,559
No, no.

1345
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:33,059
Oh, yes.

1346
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,100
No, no, no.

1347
01:07:34,101 --> 01:07:35,101
Oh...

1348
01:07:35,101 --> 01:07:35,851
No.

1349
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:37,516
...yes, yes.

1350
01:07:37,517 --> 01:07:37,934
No.

1351
01:07:37,934 --> 01:07:38,851
Mm-hmm.

1352
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:39,267
You're bad.

1353
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:40,267
Mm-hmm.

1354
01:07:40,267 --> 01:07:41,017
You're on the naughty list.

1355
01:07:41,017 --> 01:07:42,017
Mm-hmm.

1356
01:07:45,226 --> 01:07:47,933
Who's ready for our
Christmas feast?

1357
01:07:47,934 --> 01:07:48,892
Me.

1358
01:07:48,893 --> 01:07:50,391
Nice sweaters, guys.

1359
01:07:50,392 --> 01:07:53,225
Christmas spirit, Simon.

1360
01:07:53,226 --> 01:07:56,225
Hi, gorgeous.

1361
01:07:56,226 --> 01:07:57,266
Happy Christmas, dad.

1362
01:07:57,267 --> 01:07:58,600
Happy Christmas to you.

1363
01:07:58,601 --> 01:08:00,350
I didn't have to take a
nap because this year,

1364
01:08:00,351 --> 01:08:02,600
I'm in charge of the
Christmas Eve breakfast.

1365
01:08:02,601 --> 01:08:04,892
Well, aren't you a big girl now.

1366
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:10,933
Daddy, we missed you so much.

1367
01:08:10,934 --> 01:08:13,266
I missed you so much.

1368
01:08:13,267 --> 01:08:16,933
Holly's daddy had
the day off today.

1369
01:08:16,934 --> 01:08:18,141
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1370
01:08:18,142 --> 01:08:20,141
I'll have the day
off too some day.

1371
01:08:20,142 --> 01:08:21,725
I promise.

1372
01:08:21,726 --> 01:08:24,100
And someday, we'll have a house.

1373
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:27,766
With a yard, and
you'll run around.

1374
01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:29,976
Oh, yes, you will.

1375
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:34,391
[inaudible] taught us a song.

1376
01:08:34,392 --> 01:08:35,766
A Christmas song.

1377
01:08:35,767 --> 01:08:36,559
I want to hear it.

1378
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:37,559
Yeah.

1379
01:08:41,392 --> 01:08:43,891
1, 2, 3, go.

1380
01:08:43,892 --> 01:08:46,600
(SINGING) Good King
Wenceslas threw up

1381
01:08:46,601 --> 01:08:49,058
on the feet of Stephen.

1382
01:08:49,059 --> 01:08:53,808
And the presents and about
all had thoughts of leaving.

1383
01:08:53,809 --> 01:08:58,475
[inaudible] in fact,
they were quite groggy.

1384
01:08:58,476 --> 01:09:02,850
In the morning, Steve woke
up and his shoes was soggy.

1385
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:05,225
[laughter]

1386
01:09:05,226 --> 01:09:06,641
Bravo!

1387
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:07,808
Bravo!

1388
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:09,808
That was amazing!

1389
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:11,308
That was amazing!

1390
01:09:11,309 --> 01:09:12,184
No!

1391
01:09:12,185 --> 01:09:13,308
Not until we eat first.

1392
01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:17,183
Let's get this show on the road!

1393
01:09:17,184 --> 01:09:18,225
Get over there...

1394
01:09:18,226 --> 01:09:19,391
Guys, help me with the tables.

1395
01:09:19,392 --> 01:09:20,309
Let's move them
back to the couches.

1396
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:21,184
And 1, 2, 3.

1397
01:09:21,184 --> 01:09:21,976
Easy, easy.

1398
01:09:21,976 --> 01:09:22,809
There we go.

1399
01:09:22,809 --> 01:09:23,309
There we go.

1400
01:09:23,309 --> 01:09:24,309
All right.

1401
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:27,516
Now everybody hold hands.

1402
01:09:27,517 --> 01:09:33,600
Now who gets to say the
Christmas prayer tonight?

1403
01:09:33,601 --> 01:09:35,766
Rafael, how about you do it?

1404
01:09:35,767 --> 01:09:37,016
Let Tim.

1405
01:09:37,017 --> 01:09:38,183
All right.

1406
01:09:38,184 --> 01:09:40,183
Tim, why don't
you do it tonight?

1407
01:09:40,184 --> 01:09:42,766
God bless us everyone.

1408
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:43,642
Let's eat!

1409
01:09:43,642 --> 01:09:44,059
[laughs]

1410
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,266
[coughs]

1411
01:09:45,267 --> 01:09:46,017
Tim?

1412
01:09:46,017 --> 01:09:46,684
Honey?

1413
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:47,891
Oh, God.

1414
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,475
Drew, grab his oxygen.
It's going to be OK, buddy.

1415
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:50,766
Just relax.

1416
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:52,058
Breathe slow, just like
the doctor said, OK?

1417
01:09:52,059 --> 01:09:53,725
Just relax and breathe slow.

1418
01:09:53,726 --> 01:09:55,766
Thank you.

1419
01:09:55,767 --> 01:09:56,309
It's OK.

1420
01:09:56,309 --> 01:09:57,101
Here we go.

1421
01:09:57,102 --> 01:09:58,266
Deep breaths.

1422
01:09:58,267 --> 01:09:59,808
Deep breaths.

1423
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:00,392
Relax, buddy.

1424
01:10:00,392 --> 01:10:01,226
Relax, relax.

1425
01:10:01,227 --> 01:10:02,475
It's OK.

1426
01:10:02,476 --> 01:10:04,641
Just relax.

1427
01:10:04,642 --> 01:10:07,266
Tell me the child
is going to be OK.

1428
01:10:07,267 --> 01:10:09,725
Just tell me he'll be OK.

1429
01:10:09,726 --> 01:10:10,975
Tell me!

1430
01:10:10,976 --> 01:10:16,391
Whatever happened to decreasing
the surplus population?

1431
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:18,100
Home, James.

1432
01:10:18,101 --> 01:10:19,101
Home.

1433
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:29,891
Ah, you see my children,
ignorance and want.

1434
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:33,558
Neither is the natural
state of mankind.

1435
01:10:33,559 --> 01:10:40,391
Ignorance can grow to be
wise, want can become plenty.

1436
01:10:40,392 --> 01:10:44,726
But nothing can be done
without assistance.

1437
01:10:48,934 --> 01:10:50,975
Will the boy die?

1438
01:10:50,976 --> 01:10:53,850
We all will die.

1439
01:10:53,851 --> 01:10:57,434
Nothing can be done
without assistance.

1440
01:11:00,142 --> 01:11:02,891
You know where to go.

1441
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:04,142
Yes, I do.

1442
01:11:18,309 --> 01:11:19,683
Survival of the fittest.

1443
01:11:19,684 --> 01:11:24,851
Not survival of the
warmest, fuzziest, fezziest.

1444
01:11:29,059 --> 01:11:30,059
Fezziwig.

1445
01:11:36,976 --> 01:11:39,558
OK, I see.

1446
01:11:39,559 --> 01:11:41,350
I get it.

1447
01:11:41,351 --> 01:11:44,808
I'll... I'll do better.

1448
01:11:44,809 --> 01:11:48,225
But I don't see why Bob's
kid is my responsibility.

1449
01:11:48,226 --> 01:11:53,016
But I'll give him a raise.

1450
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,975
A small raise.

1451
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:57,475
A reasonable raise.

1452
01:11:57,476 --> 01:12:00,017
That should keep the
child from dying.

1453
01:12:03,267 --> 01:12:06,476
[door buzzes]

1454
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:25,184
[music playing]

1455
01:12:46,517 --> 01:12:48,142
Christmas future, I presume?

1456
01:12:51,184 --> 01:12:54,475
Maybe they didn't tell
you, but I've seen enough

1457
01:12:54,476 --> 01:12:57,350
from the other spirits.

1458
01:12:57,351 --> 01:12:58,391
Tell Marley.

1459
01:12:58,392 --> 01:13:02,475
Tell him I'll be better to Bob.

1460
01:13:02,476 --> 01:13:04,725
I really don't need
to see anymore.

1461
01:13:04,726 --> 01:13:07,391
So good night.

1462
01:13:07,392 --> 01:13:08,433
Season's greetings.

1463
01:13:08,434 --> 01:13:09,392
No.

1464
01:13:09,393 --> 01:13:10,891
[music playing]

1465
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:14,641
Let's rejoice and dance like
thunder, that old skinflint

1466
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:16,225
is 6 feet under.

1467
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:18,308
The man who hated Christmas

1468
01:13:18,309 --> 01:13:20,891
Dead, you know.

1469
01:13:20,892 --> 01:13:25,100
So Toutle Loo, you heartless
rotter, you mean old grinch.

1470
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:26,225
You, Mr. Potter.

1471
01:13:26,226 --> 01:13:31,100
Let's have three cheers
and a jolly ho, ho, ho!

1472
01:13:31,101 --> 01:13:34,725
Oh, Ebenezer Scrooge was
to Christmas what meatless

1473
01:13:34,726 --> 01:13:36,683
vegans are to Turkey day.

1474
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:38,100
He frouned at love.

1475
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:39,183
He lived to scorn.

1476
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:41,725
He frazzled folks
and he left to mourn.

1477
01:13:41,726 --> 01:13:45,309
He was a man who had a
life no one will mourn!

1478
01:13:47,892 --> 01:13:49,766
Ebenezer Scrooge
was to Christmas...

1479
01:13:49,767 --> 01:13:50,767
That's it then.

1480
01:13:50,768 --> 01:13:52,475
We'll have to close the doors.

1481
01:13:52,476 --> 01:13:53,933
Well, what else can we do?

1482
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:55,308
Nothing.

1483
01:13:55,309 --> 01:13:57,641
We can only hope some of the
other shelters take our boys.

1484
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:58,891
Well, they're no better off.

1485
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:00,308
I mean, this is
effectively going

1486
01:14:00,309 --> 01:14:02,183
to put those boys right back
out on the street again.

1487
01:14:02,184 --> 01:14:03,017
You'll never guess!

1488
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:07,808
[panting] You'll never guess.

1489
01:14:07,809 --> 01:14:10,308
Give me your hand.

1490
01:14:10,309 --> 01:14:13,725
That's good.

1491
01:14:13,726 --> 01:14:16,100
Now what happened?

1492
01:14:16,101 --> 01:14:18,891
The bastard is dead.

1493
01:14:18,892 --> 01:14:20,558
Really?

1494
01:14:20,559 --> 01:14:22,141
It's about time.

1495
01:14:22,142 --> 01:14:24,100
That's unkind.

1496
01:14:24,101 --> 01:14:25,808
But true.

1497
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:29,808
They say he was lying
alone for four days.

1498
01:14:29,809 --> 01:14:32,558
Nobody missed him.

1499
01:14:32,559 --> 01:14:33,975
And no one will.

1500
01:14:33,976 --> 01:14:36,100
And after all the money he
made from the community,

1501
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:38,141
and he never gave
back a dime, even when

1502
01:14:38,142 --> 01:14:41,641
he turned twigs into a
condo and made a fortune.

1503
01:14:41,642 --> 01:14:44,183
I hate to say it, but
I'm glad he's dead.

1504
01:14:44,184 --> 01:14:46,141
I mean, if it weren't
for the shelter closing,

1505
01:14:46,142 --> 01:14:48,141
I'd probably be strapping
on my tap shoes.

1506
01:14:48,142 --> 01:14:50,641
[laughter]

1507
01:14:50,642 --> 01:14:56,475
Oh, I wonder who will
inherit everything?

1508
01:14:56,476 --> 01:14:59,558
I wonder where
it'll all wind up.

1509
01:14:59,559 --> 01:15:00,559
Won't be here.

1510
01:15:03,017 --> 01:15:04,017
Why not?

1511
01:15:09,684 --> 01:15:11,726
What have my beauties
got for me today?

1512
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:15,808
All vintage.

1513
01:15:15,809 --> 01:15:19,016
All owned by some
fastidious old queen who

1514
01:15:19,017 --> 01:15:20,808
never went to church on Sunday.

1515
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:22,808
Where did you get these?

1516
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:24,891
They haven't even
moved the carcass yet?

1517
01:15:24,892 --> 01:15:27,350
Oh, we can get into
spaces if we need to.

1518
01:15:27,351 --> 01:15:29,766
And it ain't illegal
if the owner's dead.

1519
01:15:29,767 --> 01:15:32,558
Believe me, we looked
for those money bags.

1520
01:15:32,559 --> 01:15:34,350
The old bag's money bags.

1521
01:15:34,351 --> 01:15:36,516
[laughter]

1522
01:15:36,517 --> 01:15:39,433
So what do you say?

1523
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:40,434
Yeah.

1524
01:15:40,434 --> 01:15:41,434
You'll get your money.

1525
01:15:41,434 --> 01:15:42,351
Stay calm.

1526
01:15:42,351 --> 01:15:43,226
You'll get your money.

1527
01:15:43,227 --> 01:15:45,558
Let me take a look.

1528
01:15:45,559 --> 01:15:46,766
Oh, nice.

1529
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:51,641
[inaudible]

1530
01:15:51,642 --> 01:15:53,059
Everybody, let's hold hands.

1531
01:15:56,309 --> 01:15:57,309
No.

1532
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:00,559
Not the boy.

1533
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,391
Our Tim is gone, guys.

1534
01:16:06,392 --> 01:16:09,392
[sobbing]

1535
01:16:23,684 --> 01:16:25,683
No.

1536
01:16:25,684 --> 01:16:28,350
No.

1537
01:16:28,351 --> 01:16:29,351
No!

1538
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,683
Please.

1539
01:16:39,684 --> 01:16:41,808
Please, spirit, please, please.

1540
01:16:41,809 --> 01:16:43,558
Don't let it be too late.

1541
01:16:43,559 --> 01:16:44,517
There's time to change.

1542
01:16:44,518 --> 01:16:46,058
I know that there's time.

1543
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:51,766
Please, I've learned so
much from you spirits.

1544
01:16:51,767 --> 01:16:54,683
Don't show me.

1545
01:16:54,684 --> 01:16:56,016
Don't show me.

1546
01:16:56,017 --> 01:16:57,892
If you don't show me,
then it won't be true.

1547
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:06,225
No.

1548
01:17:06,226 --> 01:17:09,641
[music playing]

1549
01:17:09,642 --> 01:17:11,183
No.

1550
01:17:11,184 --> 01:17:14,183
[sobs] No!

1551
01:17:14,184 --> 01:17:14,601
No!

1552
01:17:14,602 --> 01:17:16,058
No!

1553
01:17:16,059 --> 01:17:18,308
No!

1554
01:17:18,309 --> 01:17:20,308
Please!

1555
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:22,308
Please!

1556
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:23,683
No!

1557
01:17:23,684 --> 01:17:26,141
No!

1558
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:27,142
No!

1559
01:18:18,809 --> 01:18:24,308
Ben, one day you
will understand.

1560
01:18:24,309 --> 01:18:27,850
One day, you will find grace.

1561
01:18:27,851 --> 01:18:32,600
And on that day, you'll
know that I forgive you,

1562
01:18:32,601 --> 01:18:37,558
and I love you no matter what.

1563
01:18:37,559 --> 01:18:38,559
No matter what.

1564
01:18:43,309 --> 01:18:45,683

1565
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:46,559

1567
01:19:04,392 --> 01:19:08,309
Home, awake, alive.

[laughs]

1569
01:19:15,726 --> 01:19:21,558
Home, awake, alive.

1570
01:19:21,559 --> 01:19:22,933
Oh, what day?

1571
01:19:22,934 --> 01:19:25,766
What day is it?

1572
01:19:25,767 --> 01:19:27,808
I'm still alive.

1573
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:30,350
It's not too late.

1574
01:19:30,351 --> 01:19:31,933
Jake.

1575
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:32,975
Jake.

1576
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:35,766
I'm going to unforge my chains.

1577
01:19:35,767 --> 01:19:36,434
Thank you.

1578
01:19:36,434 --> 01:19:36,934
Thank you.

1579
01:19:36,935 --> 01:19:38,933
Thank you.

1580
01:19:38,934 --> 01:19:42,308
But what day is it?

1581
01:19:42,309 --> 01:19:44,766
And it's 8:43 on
Christmas morning...

1582
01:19:44,767 --> 01:19:46,933
[gasps] Thank you.

1583
01:19:46,934 --> 01:19:48,808
Thank you.

1584
01:19:48,809 --> 01:19:50,183
Oh, you intelligent reporter.

1585
01:19:50,184 --> 01:19:51,766
Brilliant investigation.

1586
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:52,850
Oh, I love TV.

1587
01:19:52,851 --> 01:19:54,475
Oh, I'm not too late.

1588
01:19:54,476 --> 01:19:56,058
I'm not too late.

1589
01:19:56,059 --> 01:19:58,933
It's not too late.

1590
01:19:58,934 --> 01:20:02,600
[laughs] I'm awake.

1591
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:03,641
I'm alive.

1592
01:20:03,642 --> 01:20:04,642
I'm awake.

1593
01:20:07,226 --> 01:20:08,683
And I can do better.

1594
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:10,933
I can do better.

1595
01:20:10,934 --> 01:20:12,183
I will.

1596
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:15,516
I will do better.

1597
01:20:15,517 --> 01:20:16,641
Watch me.

1598
01:20:16,642 --> 01:20:19,808
[laughs]

1599
01:20:19,809 --> 01:20:21,141
Yes.

1600
01:20:21,142 --> 01:20:22,641
And the name on the
door is Cratchit.

1601
01:20:22,642 --> 01:20:28,391
C-R-A-T-C-H-I-T. Yes, it
is a funny name, isn't it?

1602
01:20:28,392 --> 01:20:29,184
Thank you.

1603
01:20:29,185 --> 01:20:32,142
Oh, Merry Christmas.

1604
01:20:35,642 --> 01:20:36,642
It's a start.

1605
01:20:39,517 --> 01:20:41,433
Bob, did you order a
26 pound roast turkey

1606
01:20:41,434 --> 01:20:43,266
with all the trimmings
and a pie big enough

1607
01:20:43,267 --> 01:20:44,850
to feed the entire North Pole?

1608
01:20:44,851 --> 01:20:46,141
No.

1609
01:20:46,142 --> 01:20:47,017
But if I don't have
to cook it, let it in.

1610
01:20:47,017 --> 01:20:48,017
All right.

1611
01:20:48,018 --> 01:20:49,101
What is he talking about?

1612
01:20:52,601 --> 01:20:53,933
I know.

1613
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:55,475
I want the potatoes!

1614
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:57,726
[chatter]

1615
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:01,891
Here are Christmas sunshine.

1616
01:21:01,892 --> 01:21:02,809
Merry Christmas.

1617
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:04,808
Merry Christmas to you.

1618
01:21:04,809 --> 01:21:06,891
Take that.

1619
01:21:06,892 --> 01:21:08,016
We'll talk tomorrow.

1620
01:21:08,017 --> 01:21:09,516
Christmas is no
day for business.

1621
01:21:09,517 --> 01:21:12,142
[laughs]

1622
01:21:15,934 --> 01:21:18,558
[gasps]

1623
01:21:18,559 --> 01:21:20,559
[door bell dings]

1624
01:21:22,559 --> 01:21:24,725
Uncle Ben.

1625
01:21:24,726 --> 01:21:28,808
Can a contrite old man have
a little Christmas cheer?

1626
01:21:28,809 --> 01:21:29,809
Of course.

1627
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:31,058
Freda!

1628
01:21:31,059 --> 01:21:33,058
She is going to be so excited.

1629
01:21:33,059 --> 01:21:34,392
Mary, who is it, honey?

1630
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,641
Uncle Ben.

1631
01:21:39,642 --> 01:21:41,975
I'm astonished.

1632
01:21:41,976 --> 01:21:45,225
Happy, but astonished.

1633
01:21:45,226 --> 01:21:48,391
Well, I did a little
meditating last night.

1634
01:21:48,392 --> 01:21:51,475
OK, a lot.

1635
01:21:51,476 --> 01:21:59,476
And I woke up hoping to join
my family if they'll have me.

1636
01:22:02,059 --> 01:22:04,600
It's a Christmas miracle.

1637
01:22:04,601 --> 01:22:05,226
Get in here.

1638
01:22:05,227 --> 01:22:07,767
[laughter]

1639
01:22:13,726 --> 01:22:15,183
You're late.

1640
01:22:15,184 --> 01:22:16,433
I'm sorry.
