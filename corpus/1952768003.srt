1
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:55,339
The word "deviant" comes
from the Latin roots...

2
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,175
de, meaning "from"...

3
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,636
and via, "the road”.

4
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:02,180
One who wanders
from the road or gets lost.

5
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,308
One who separates from the crowd.

6
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:09,021
Of course nowadays it refers to someone
whose sexual practices are abnormal.

7
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:14,402
This is the story
of Stuart, Alex and me...

8
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:17,824
and how, for a while,
we became deviants...

9
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:19,867
in both senses of the word.

10
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:44,088
Don't do it!
It's a trap! Run away!

11
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:53,098
It's been said that anyone
who wants to live in a dormitory...

12
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:56,143
must either be a mental defective
or a freshman.

13
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,730
I was neither.
I was a junior transfer student...

14
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:01,483
and I thought living in a dorm
couldn't be that bad.

15
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:05,404
I've never been quite that wrong
before or since.

16
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:08,074
- Hi.
- Hi. Eddy Howe.

17
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:10,743
I think I'm supposed
to sign something.

18
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:12,663
Yeah, here you go.

19
00:03:13,956 --> 00:03:15,916
- Here.
- Thank you.

20
00:03:18,795 --> 00:03:22,549
- Here's your key, and there you go.
- Where do I go?

21
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:24,133
- Upstairs.
- Thank you.

22
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:26,011
You're welcome.

23
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:30,266
- Fresh meat.
- I saw him first.

24
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,003
Who are you?

25
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:59,007
I guess I'm your new roommate Eddy.

26
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:03,304
I thought they were gonna let me
keep the twin as a single.

27
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:04,638
Fuck!

28
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,354
It's nice to meet you too.

29
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:20,781
What I quickly realized
about Stuart...

30
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:23,577
was that he lacked that part
of the brain which would stop him...

31
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,497
from saying things that might be
offensive to other people.

32
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:34,797
I also realized that we couldn't
have been less suited as roommates.

33
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:43,224
- Fore!
- But we managed to get along.

34
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,188
In fact, there developed a bizarre
equanimity in the relationship.

35
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,856
A balance.

36
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:53,152
I showed Stuart how to make his bed
with hospital corners...

37
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:55,738
Lick the salt, drink the drink,
suck the lime. One, two, three.

38
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:58,575
and in return
Stuart taught me how to drink.

39
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:07,418
I wrote Stuart's
English papers for him...

40
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,716
and he bought me dinner.

41
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:15,469
I cleaned the bathroom...

42
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:18,389
and he took care of the laundry.

43
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:22,811
Sometimes he borrowed
things of mine...

44
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:26,107
and sometimes I borrowed
things back.

45
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,318
You think it's real funny, don't you?
How's this? Ready?

46
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:32,446
Stuart would be quiet
so that I could study...

47
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,291
and I gave him time alone
to socialize with friends.

48
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:49,091
This delicate equilibrium
in the relationship...

49
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,385
was soon upset by an arrival.

50
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:55,265
The other room in the suite,
a single, had remained empty...

51
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:57,142
until one day.

52
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:00,812
Whoever he is,
he isn't very friendly.

53
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,940
But we soon met.

54
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:05,943
Stuart, did you go to class or just
stay in bed and masturbate all day?

55
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,951
You know, I've been...

56
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,251
Would you please get outta here?

57
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:36,102
It's a coed dorm.
What's the problem?

58
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:39,732
It's coed within the building.
It's not within the rooms.

59
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,651
So?

60
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,405
So the polite thing for you to do
is go down to the housing office...

61
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,867
tell them there's been a mistake, and
they need to get you boys new rooms.

62
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,704
No, we were here first.
Besides, it's your fault.

63
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:54,457
Why didn't you use Alexandria
or whatever your full name is?

64
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,626
Alex is my full name.

65
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,421
- It sounds like a man's name to me.
- I think it's lovely.

66
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:06,930
Wow, she's amazing.

67
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:09,307
Truly amazing.

68
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:14,814
Amazing grace

69
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,817
It's not Grace. It's Alex.

70
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:22,906
Amazing Alex

71
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,034
”Hendrickson, Alex. Male”.

72
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:29,080
I'm a female. Trust me.

73
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:31,708
According to our files,
you're male.

74
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,964
Okay...

75
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,219
let's just suppose for a second...

76
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,096
that I'm a female.

77
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:44,806
What would happen then?

78
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:47,809
I'd have to put you
on the transfer waiting list...

79
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:50,062
and your name would probably
come up in eight to twelve weeks.

80
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:53,774
There's a severe housing shortage
in the area.

81
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:57,404
- Would you consider living off-campus?
- I can't afford it.

82
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:59,656
I can put you on the transfer
waiting list...

83
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,619
but I'll need official verification
that you are indeed a female.

84
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:06,915
Next.

85
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:10,461
It's only temporary.
I mean, till I can find something.

86
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,798
I just... I'm not asking anyone
to do anything silly...

87
00:08:14,882 --> 00:08:17,093
like put down the toilet seat.

88
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:20,847
I'm just asking that when you're done
voiding your bowels, you flush.

89
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:23,601
After we're done
"whating" our "what"?

90
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:26,771
She means flush after you take
one of those big dumps, moron.

91
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:29,232
Is that what you mean?

92
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,693
That's a shame.
I'm so proud of those.

93
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,072
You know, in some countries,
the size of a man's crap...

94
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:37,784
is a sign of his masculinity.

95
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,833
She avoided us.

96
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,877
What was it
that kept her away?

97
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:15,869
I just love the smell
of her dirty panties.

98
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:27,841
For some unknown reason,
Stuart was confident she'd come around.

99
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:29,885
I need to talk to you.

100
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:31,887
Yes, Alex?

101
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:34,640
If you don't stop
eating my yogurt...

102
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,893
I know it was you...

103
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,146
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

104
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,194
You make murder sound
so sexual, Alex.

105
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:20,234
Get that crap to go.
I wanna work on her.

106
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:23,612
She doesn't like you, all right?
When's it gonna penetrate?

107
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:25,949
As soon as you go away, maybe.

108
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:29,702
Now wrap it up and get it
to go quickly. Go now.

109
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:31,747
Eat shit now.

110
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,293
- One, two, three.
- Don't do that.

111
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:39,631
- Go. Get out of here.
- You're a neanderthal. You know that?

112
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,175
- I know that.
- No, you're really growing.

113
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,261
You're growing as a person.
That's important.

114
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,347
- You should show Alex that.
- Will you get outta here?

115
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,432
No, I have to order
another slice of pizza.

116
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:51,477
I think there's a danger
in our being overfriendly.

117
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:55,941
How can we be overfriendly
if we aren't even friendly?

118
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:57,943
He's got a point.

119
00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:09,081
That's a great book.
You're gonna love it.

120
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:11,000
I've read it four times.

121
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:17,299
You know, I've often felt like
the main character, Holden Caulfield.

122
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,137
No, you're not Holden Caulfield.

123
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,389
He's Stradlater,
the obnoxious roommate.

124
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:26,100
The one that thinks he's a stud and
borrows Holden's coat without asking...

125
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:29,438
and stretches it out
and doesn't apologize.

126
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,231
It's a good book.

127
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,401
I always felt like
the little sister.

128
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:36,779
- Phoebe?
- Yeah.

129
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,240
Have you read Franny and Zooey
or Nine Stories?

130
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,826
Yeah. They're not as good, though.

131
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,164
You know, one time my mom...
She actually metJ D Salinger.

132
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:48,125
- Really?
- She threw up on his front lawn.

133
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,251
Really?

134
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:53,340
Yeah, she was on vacation
in Maine with her best friend...

135
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:56,009
and they met these two sailors
who were in port for the night.

136
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:58,387
They got really drunk
and these sailors took them out.

137
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:01,974
Before long, Alex and I were
wrapped in conversation...

138
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:04,686
and Stuart was not.

139
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:08,398
Look, I wasn't trying to horn in
on your situation, okay?

140
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:10,484
I'm not interested in her anyway.

141
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:14,113
Whatever.
I don't want to talk about it.

142
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:20,871
Sorry.

143
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:28,088
Gimme your toothbrush.

144
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:31,968
- Why?
- Give me your toothbrush.

145
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:38,808
- I don't want to.
- Gimme the goddamn toothbrush!

146
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:46,150
I would not have spilled
my father's blood...

147
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:49,737
or listened to those
who called me my mother's wife.

148
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:52,156
And now I am God-shunned...

149
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,035
the daughter of a mother defiled...

150
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:58,205
and I have taken my turn
in my mother's bed.

151
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:01,334
If there is any tragedy
greater than all others...

152
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,379
it belongs to me.

153
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:08,718
Pretty awful, huh?

154
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:11,053
I just don't understand
why anybody would do...

155
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:13,222
a lesbian version of Oedipus Rex.

156
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,183
I thought it was good.

157
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:19,646
- You did?
- Yeah. I really liked it.

158
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:22,901
Stuart, you don't have to worry
about hurting my feelings.

159
00:13:22,984 --> 00:13:25,403
I know it was a piece of crap.

160
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:28,323
I thought you were good.
I thought everybody was really good.

161
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:30,951
- I liked it.
- What'd you think?

162
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,663
The translation was bad.

163
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,499
Direction was nonexistent.

164
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:40,295
Somebody should call the acting police
on a couple of those actresses.

165
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:42,672
Costumes looked like
a bad night at Caesar's Palace.

166
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,759
Other than that,
I thought it was great.

167
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:47,678
You were wonderful.
You made the best out of your part.

168
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:50,349
I agree with all that.

169
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:52,476
I think you guys are being
too hard on it.

170
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:58,024
You're a business major. This is art.
The work is what's important here.

171
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:00,652
It's better to be honest
than to be nice, okay?

172
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:03,696
Fuck me for being nice.

173
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:11,248
- Wait, Stuart.
- Just let him go.

174
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:13,333
It's better just the two of us.

175
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:18,965
A toast to bigger and better things.

176
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:20,925
A toast to bigger and better things.

177
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,396
Professionally or personally?

178
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,276
I was speaking professionally...

179
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:41,323
but as the big dude says, a man is happy
when he has both work and love.

180
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,241
The big dude?

181
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:46,495
Yeah, unfashionable
though he may be, Freud.

182
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:50,709
I love Freud,
unfashionable though he may be.

183
00:14:52,877 --> 00:14:55,172
- I should go.
- No.

184
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:57,883
Come on. Just sit down for one second.
You mind if I change?

185
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,427
No.

186
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:04,266
I just really want everything
to be perfect for this moment.

187
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:06,351
Are we having a moment?

188
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,855
How about this?

189
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:10,899
That's perfect.

190
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:11,983
This?

191
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:14,068
Great.
They're both excellent choices.

192
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,738
I hate them.

193
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:26,333
It's kinda pointless.
Don't you think?

194
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,793
What is?

195
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,131
Putting on clothes.

196
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:37,054
When I just want to take 'em off.

197
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,850
Well, some people say it's pointless
to make your bed every morning...

198
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,937
just 'cause you're gonna
unmake it every night...

199
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:46,314
but I still think
it's nice to make your bed.

200
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:50,653
- My bed's made.
- Yeah. You did a really good job too.

201
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:55,491
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- I should...

202
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:01,039
- What are you doing?
- Guess.

203
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:03,708
- Let's talk about this first.
- Let's not.

204
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:06,963
- Am I hurting you?
- No. Could you get off me now?

205
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:10,049
- You want me to get you off?
- No, I...

206
00:16:10,132 --> 00:16:12,177
What are you doing?

207
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,933
- You smell good.
- Alex, I...

208
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:23,523
Alex, I don't know.

209
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:27,444
- I don't know if this...
- I think you're at a loss for words.

210
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,706
Eddy, come back!

211
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,210
- Then what did you do?
- I didn't know what to do, all right?

212
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:43,838
She kissed me,
and it snowballed into this insanity.

213
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,090
You didn't get anything?
You didn't look down her dress?

214
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:50,137
- Cop a little feel? Goose her? Nothing?
- No. I told her to stop touching me.

215
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,681
- Why didn't you just fuck her?
- Yeah, right.

216
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:55,935
The girl was on her knees,
undoing your fly with her teeth.

217
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,063
She's in the perfect position
to at least get a blow job.

218
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,987
- You wouldn't understand.
- You're right. I wouldn't understand.

219
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,906
The girl wants you to fuck her,
you fuck her.

220
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,410
Unless you're doing
the asexual thing.

221
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:14,831
- The what?
- It's a classic.

222
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:17,376
What are you talking about?

223
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,129
You act like you're a fag,
the two of you become good friends...

224
00:17:20,212 --> 00:17:22,757
you start to share clothes,
she starts to confide in you...

225
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,218
and then, "boom”,
you go for her tits.

226
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,763
It's brilliant,
if you can pull it off.

227
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,725
Yeah, maybe that's what I'm doing.

228
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:55,211
Hi.

229
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:10,812
I think there's something
you should know.

230
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:19,948
I find libraries very erotic.

231
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:25,870
The smell of old books.

232
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,792
The silence.

233
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,466
The long aisles.

234
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,473
To be lost in the stacks.

235
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:48,147
That's very interesting.

236
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:53,986
- What are you reading?
- Hawthorne.

237
00:18:57,699 --> 00:19:01,870
- Will you read to me?
- Alex, I've got to study for this.

238
00:19:01,911 --> 00:19:04,749
Please, please, please.

239
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:13,342
"Soon there emerged
from under a sculpted portal...

240
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:15,385
the figure of a young girl...

241
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:18,932
arrayed with as much richness of taste
as the most splendid of the flowers.

242
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:21,017
Beautiful as the...

243
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,854
day...

244
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,775
and with a bloom
so deep and vivid that...

245
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:29,318
Oh, my!

246
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:33,365
one shade more
would have been too much.

247
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,037
She looked redundant with life,
health and energy...

248
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,582
all of which attributes were bound
down and compressed, as it were...

249
00:19:41,624 --> 00:19:44,710
and girdled tensely
in their luxuriance...

250
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:47,130
by her virgin zone”.

251
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,055
Are you all right?

252
00:19:57,225 --> 00:19:58,559
Golly...

253
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:01,355
I love big words.

254
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:07,237
Right there?

255
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,281
She came right there?

256
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:11,866
I think so. I don't know.
Don't tell her I told you, all right?

257
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,912
What do you think I am,
some kind of a sleazebag?

258
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:16,497
Then what happened?

259
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:19,875
- Nothing. I was reading.
- What were you reading?

260
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:22,587
Hawthorne.
Nathaniel Hawthorne.

261
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:24,923
Moby Dick.
That's good.

262
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,967
That's Herman Melville.

263
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,761
Whatever.

264
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:29,846
So?

265
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:34,100
So, Eddy, this is a major discovery.

266
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:37,354
This girl... She is a live wire
of sexual energy.

267
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:39,440
You're telling me.

268
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:41,358
Doesn't that excite you?

269
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:44,529
I mean, don't you want to just
take this girl and, like...

270
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:47,699
grab her and just fuck her?

271
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:51,037
Maybe.

272
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,997
There's no maybes about it.

273
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,917
The next time you're in that situation,
you slide her off that table...

274
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:57,961
and you pull up her skirt.

275
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,005
Rip her panties off
with your teeth.

276
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:03,384
With your teeth. That's good.
And then take your fingers... No.

277
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:07,180
At that moment, I was indeed
becoming sexually excited...

278
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:09,891
but not over Alex.

279
00:21:09,974 --> 00:21:12,936
Then all of a sudden you just
shove it right in.

280
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,397
As Stuart went on and on,
I realized finally...

281
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,109
that it was he I lusted after.

282
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:21,529
Right when you're about to come,
just squeeze it at the end and...

283
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,960
You know what I mean?

284
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,378
Yeah.

285
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,301
Stuart went on to say he had never
felt as strongly for any girl...

286
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:43,846
as he did for Alex, and since
I was indifferent, he had to have her.

287
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,933
He would stop at nothing.

288
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,560
Even if it meant being...

289
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:51,438
an intellectual.

290
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:54,818
What are you doing here?

291
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:57,278
Reading.

292
00:21:57,362 --> 00:22:00,157
Stuart, have you ever set foot
in this library before?

293
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:02,076
In any library, for that matter?

294
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,625
Well, last time I checked,
the purpose for college...

295
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:10,877
was educational advancement.

296
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,880
Eddy told you what happened
yesterday, didn't he?

297
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,552
What are you talking about?

298
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,223
It's not gonna happen.

299
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:24,685
It's nothing personal.
There's just no magic.

300
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,315
So just cool it, okay?

301
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:53,092
You don't need magic.

302
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:55,261
Really? What do I need?

303
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,807
What you need...

304
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:02,603
is a long...

305
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:05,231
hard...

306
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:08,985
phantasmagoric...

307
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:12,990
fuck.

308
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:17,620
- I don't like you, Stuart.
- That's okay.

309
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,419
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

310
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,386
You know, you really shouldn't
deprive the body of what it needs.

311
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:41,398
"Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov...

312
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:45,110
was the third son
of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov..."

313
00:23:45,193 --> 00:23:47,154
What are you doing?

314
00:23:49,657 --> 00:23:51,534
Dostoevsky.

315
00:23:53,537 --> 00:23:55,872
You try too hard.

316
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:58,417
That's your whole problem.

317
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,586
You were just about ready
to tap into something...

318
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,547
completely savage and emotional...

319
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:04,882
and you ruin it by trying to be
something you're not.

320
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:07,970
I'm sorry.

321
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:13,559
You're not an intellectual.
Accept it.

322
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:18,231
I accept it.
Now can we try this again? Please?

323
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:19,858
No!

324
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:23,821
Shit.

325
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:31,997
- I've been looking for you.
- You have?

326
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,416
- We need to talk.
- We do?

327
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,878
- Why are you backing away from me?
- I'm not backing away from you.

328
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:39,047
I'm just walking backwards
while you're walking forwards.

329
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,508
I forgive you for telling Stuart
about what happened in the library.

330
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,304
I apologize for my exuberance.

331
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:47,598
I don't apologize
for my exuberance!

332
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:51,061
I revel in it! And I wanna know
what the story is with you!

333
00:24:51,102 --> 00:24:53,563
Why are you so standoffish with me?

334
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:56,191
Why won't you kiss me?
Why?

335
00:24:56,274 --> 00:25:00,071
- Look, you see, it's...
- What?

336
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:02,615
- Never mind.
- What?

337
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:05,202
- I can't tell you!
- Tell me.

338
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,678
I'm sexually ambivalent.

339
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:29,354
Ambivalent about sex in general,
or ambivalent about sex with me?

340
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:35,903
Ambivalent about sex with girls.

341
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:50,545
You don't like girls.

342
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:54,633
I like them.
I just don't wanna have sex with them.

343
00:26:00,514 --> 00:26:02,308
You know...

344
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:07,439
I suspected it.

345
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:08,858
You did?

346
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:10,985
Oh, yeah.

347
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,747
Come on.
Let's go get a drink.

348
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,090
How many men have you been with?

349
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:32,843
- Alex, come on.
- Just tell me.

350
00:26:37,057 --> 00:26:38,767
All right.

351
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,894
The truth is...

352
00:26:40,977 --> 00:26:43,731
except for a few
botched attempts with girls...

353
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:46,692
I'm a...

354
00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:50,571
You know.

355
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,160
Oh, God.
I haven't slept with anyone.

356
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:58,706
- You haven't been with a man yet?
- No, not with anyone.

357
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,958
Then you're not gay!

358
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:03,044
You're a blank slate!

359
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:06,715
I'll mold you into a heterosexual
with my bare hands.

360
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:10,260
Drama major.
Okay, fine. Just do me a favor.

361
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:13,181
Don't tell Stuart, all right?

362
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,100
- Sure.
- You promise?

363
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:16,393
Yeah.

364
00:27:24,318 --> 00:27:26,613
What are you doing?

365
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:28,407
Nothing.

366
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,019
Were you just looking
at my butt?

367
00:27:55,312 --> 00:27:56,647
No.

368
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:59,025
You weren't just looking
at my butt?

369
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:04,239
Don't know
what you're talking about.

370
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,340
Eddy, I've been thinking
about something.

371
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,799
That's good.

372
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:23,970
I think you were checking out
my butt the other day.

373
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:26,639
I was not.

374
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:28,725
I think you were.

375
00:28:30,394 --> 00:28:32,563
I don't care what you think.

376
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:35,274
Are you a homo?

377
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:37,611
Fuck off.

378
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,239
It's okay if you are.
Doesn't bother me.

379
00:28:41,323 --> 00:28:44,744
I'm secure enough in my own sexuality
to not feel threatened by it.

380
00:28:45,912 --> 00:28:48,873
I have a very hip attitude
about this sort of thing.

381
00:28:48,956 --> 00:28:51,752
My mom had a lot of gay friends.

382
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:55,297
You know, it's not a good time to be
a sexually promiscuous homo.

383
00:28:58,593 --> 00:29:00,387
You ever butt-fucked anybody?

384
00:29:00,428 --> 00:29:01,763
Jesus!

385
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:03,723
No? You ever been butt-fucked?

386
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:06,268
Please, Stuart. Please shut up.
All right?

387
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:09,730
I'm not gonna finish writing
this paper for you unless you shut up.

388
00:29:11,774 --> 00:29:14,569
Look, I don't have anything
against homos.

389
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:17,364
I mean, you are what you are, right?

390
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:20,243
And it's okay
if you look at my butt.

391
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:22,745
It's a nice butt.
I know that.

392
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:24,580
Will you stop saying
the word "butt"?

393
00:29:24,622 --> 00:29:26,833
- But...
- That's it.

394
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:33,257
Hey, Eddy, this paper's due tomorrow.
What am I gonna do?

395
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:47,356
Guess what?

396
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,859
What?

397
00:29:48,942 --> 00:29:53,405
- Eddy is a proud home owner.
- A what?

398
00:29:54,614 --> 00:29:57,827
A homeboy.
Homo erectus.

399
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,538
- A fag.
- I didn't say that.

400
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:02,206
You didn't deny it.

401
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,834
I don't believe it.

402
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:06,086
You can't say "fag”.

403
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,172
It's like when one black guy
calls another "nigger”.

404
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:09,758
You can't say it
unless you are one.

405
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,927
You just said "nigger”,
and you're not a black guy.

406
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:15,013
It's okay, though,
'cause I'm a fag.

407
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:17,099
You see?
What'd I tell you?

408
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:20,644
- Stop saying that word.
- He is what he is.

409
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,772
He doesn't know what he is.
He's confused.

410
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:25,192
He's not confused about my butt.

411
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:32,575
Do you like boys or girls?

412
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:35,828
The truth is,
sometimes both are attractive.

413
00:30:35,912 --> 00:30:38,332
- Of course they are.
- But if you think it through...

414
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:41,210
gay sex, by definition,
is better than straight sex.

415
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:43,504
Get the fuck outta here.

416
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:46,091
- No, I have a theory.
- I would love to hear this.

417
00:30:46,174 --> 00:30:49,386
Well, as I see it,
it all has to do with equipment...

418
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:52,055
and the correct use
of that equipment.

419
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:54,642
Now, if you have male genitalia,
as I do...

420
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:57,520
and you're sleeping with someone
who also has male genitalia...

421
00:30:57,603 --> 00:31:00,148
then you have firsthand knowledge
of how their equipment works.

422
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:02,192
You know where
the pressure-sensitive points are.

423
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:03,819
You know what buttons to push.

424
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,698
On the other hand, if you're a man
having sex with a woman or vice versa...

425
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,283
then you really never know
how they feel.

426
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,662
You don't know if they really feel great
or if they're just faking it.

427
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,999
Wow.

428
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,086
No. No.

429
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,382
Straight sex is better than gay sex.
It's written in the Bible.

430
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,884
Is that in the King James
or the New World edition?

431
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,512
Look, I just know. Okay?

432
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:30,057
How do you know, Stuart?
I mean, have you compared the two?

433
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:31,183
Have you?

434
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,811
Surely you admit
that lesbian sex...

435
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,856
is more satisfying to women
than hetero sex, right?

436
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:37,733
I mean, that's an established fact.

437
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:39,943
Everybody knows that.

438
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,447
I've grown tired.

439
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:47,660
Look, no matter what happens,
somebody's gonna get screwed.

440
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:50,664
Who's gonna get screwed?

441
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:52,708
I think you guys know
what I'm talking about.

442
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:55,252
I think it's destructive
and dangerous.

443
00:31:57,422 --> 00:31:59,132
What is?

444
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:01,092
Don't act stupid.

445
00:32:01,134 --> 00:32:02,969
He's not acting, Alex.

446
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:05,181
Okay, look.

447
00:32:05,264 --> 00:32:07,975
You have the hots for me,
I have the hots for him...

448
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,063
and sooner or later,
he's gonna have the hots for you.

449
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:13,440
Sounds pretty hot to me.

450
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:28,082
Let's make a vow.

451
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:29,875
Sacred vow.

452
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:32,253
The three of us
are gonna be friends, and that's it.

453
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:35,632
I mean, aren't you guys tired
of this whole sex thing?

454
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:38,677
How can I be tired of this whole
sex thing if I haven't had any sex?

455
00:32:40,513 --> 00:32:43,432
Well, then, have sex with someone
outside our little circle.

456
00:32:44,517 --> 00:32:48,855
Sex with strangers.
That sounds wise.

457
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:52,109
Forget about that.

458
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:56,239
But as far as the three of us go,
let's just be friends.

459
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:57,949
No sex.

460
00:32:58,616 --> 00:32:59,993
Yes, Stuart?

461
00:33:00,661 --> 00:33:02,579
Do blow jobs count as sex?

462
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:05,290
I'm not gonna blow you, man,
and that's final.

463
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:11,506
Come on!

464
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:22,728
Okay?

465
00:33:26,022 --> 00:33:27,065
Okay.

466
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:31,654
Sacred vows are all
very well and good...

467
00:33:31,738 --> 00:33:36,452
but only moments later I felt Alex
eyeing my rear end on the way home.

468
00:33:36,535 --> 00:33:39,329
And as we said good night,
Stuart allowed his gaze to linger...

469
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:42,332
on the gently sloping nape
of Alex's neck.

470
00:33:43,418 --> 00:33:45,879
And I stayed up
for reasons of my own.

471
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:50,051
But the sacred vow was observed...

472
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:52,470
at least on the surface...
and we became friends.

473
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:53,763
Hey, Stuart!

474
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:55,848
Watch out for the balloons!

475
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,434
I'm gonna kill you!

476
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,028
I'm sorry.

477
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:09,572
Alex, I'm in here.
Can you please wait?

478
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,617
How about, "Alex, you look so nice"?

479
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,496
Stuart, let's go.
Get outta here!

480
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:17,664
Get outta here.

481
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:20,085
- Alex, come on. Get out.
- Don't fucking push me!

482
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:22,629
I swear I'll hit you. I'm violent.
I'll hit you with it.

483
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:25,257
It's not funny!

484
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:43,472
The oddity of our happy little enclave
is lost on no one.

485
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,142
Especially not the lobby lizards.

486
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:50,354
All I wanna know
is who's doing who.

487
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:52,690
I heard that Eddy and Stu
are taking turns with her.

488
00:35:52,774 --> 00:35:55,943
I think the guys are gay,
and she's their fag hag.

489
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:58,614
She's not a fag hag.
You're a fag hag.

490
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:00,991
- I am not.
- Leave her alone, Stuart.

491
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,118
Leave me alone!

492
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,748
I don't like you.
Stop it.

493
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,589
You're hurting me!
Would you knock it off?

494
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,342
I bruise easily. I have 5,000
gazillion-jillion bruises from you.

495
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,887
- Where did he hurt you? Let me see.
- Look at that.

496
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,515
- Right there? Is that where it hurts?
- Don't you get like that.

497
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:24,392
Oh, my God.
It's total S&M.

498
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,491
Hi.
How are the three musketeers?

499
00:36:37,574 --> 00:36:40,703
Just one big happy family.

500
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:42,372
It sounds pretty kinky.

501
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:45,417
Incest is best.

502
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:51,382
Right there. Right there.

503
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,053
Unbelievable.

504
00:36:55,095 --> 00:36:58,557
One night, when Alex had the nerve
to go to a party without us...

505
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:00,934
Stuart and I fell asleep
in her room.

506
00:37:00,976 --> 00:37:04,772
A foul and mysterious odor having
driven us out of our own quarters.

507
00:37:14,783 --> 00:37:16,578
What are you doing in here?

508
00:37:17,662 --> 00:37:20,415
Our room has
a foul and mysterious odor.

509
00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:23,252
Why don't you clean it?
You used to be a clean person. Let's go.

510
00:37:23,294 --> 00:37:25,671
That was before
I moved in with him.

511
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:28,674
I used to make hospital corners.
Now I don't even wash my sheets.

512
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,846
- Who are you?
- That's Larry. This is Eddy and Stuart.

513
00:37:32,929 --> 00:37:34,055
Hi.

514
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:38,102
What's his name? "Scary?"

515
00:37:38,144 --> 00:37:39,979
I think he said „Larry”.

516
00:37:41,981 --> 00:37:43,901
- Get out!
- „Larry?"

517
00:37:44,568 --> 00:37:46,236
Yes, „Larry”.

518
00:37:47,488 --> 00:37:49,114
Come on. Let's go. Get out.

519
00:37:49,198 --> 00:37:51,951
Stop kicking at me.
Get out.

520
00:38:01,337 --> 00:38:04,173
- Are you hungry?
- No, thank you.

521
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:12,892
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

522
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:20,400
We should've expected it.
No oaths of exclusivity had been taken.

523
00:38:20,484 --> 00:38:22,152
Quite the opposite.

524
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:25,614
But, nonetheless, we felt supplanted
by Larry and betrayed by Alex.

525
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,868
The sanctuary
had been trespassed upon.

526
00:38:53,271 --> 00:38:55,607
You're a very special girl.

527
00:38:56,692 --> 00:38:59,862
I think I'd like to get
to know you a lot better.

528
00:39:00,946 --> 00:39:03,032
What are your dreams?

529
00:39:03,116 --> 00:39:05,410
Who is Alex?

530
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:10,082
Gosh, let's not talk.

531
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:16,590
You're right.

532
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:20,635
Let's communicate via
the international language of love.

533
00:39:26,934 --> 00:39:29,437
Twenty. Shit.

534
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:38,239
- You hungry?
- Am I ever not hungry?

535
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:41,576
Pizza?

536
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:44,830
Sounds good.

537
00:39:45,623 --> 00:39:47,124
Okay.

538
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:55,342
- You think Alex is hungry?
- Let's not forget about Scary Larry.

539
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:07,022
- Hi. You hungry?
- I hope you burn in hell!

540
00:40:12,653 --> 00:40:15,532
I don't think she's hungry.
I think she's mad.

541
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:17,117
No, you're mistaken.

542
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:19,202
You need to call her back up
and make sure you didn't...

543
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:20,955
ruffle her feathers unnecessarily.

544
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:23,332
What a good idea.

545
00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:29,464
Hi. It's me again.
Look, I was curious.

546
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:33,802
Are you angry with me because I called,
or because you're just not hungry?

547
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:36,430
Hello?

548
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:40,476
She hung up.

549
00:40:42,688 --> 00:40:45,941
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
Are you that jealous?

550
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:49,571
My dear, we're just worried about
a young man that comes a-courtin'.

551
00:40:49,654 --> 00:40:51,322
Is he a Christian?

552
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:53,700
- Leave me alone.
- Wait.

553
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:55,911
- What?
- One more question.

554
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,497
It's about his hair.

555
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,416
Is it fiberglass or steel?

556
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,045
We think that Larry...

557
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,257
is very scary.

558
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,595
- And hairy.
- Very hairy.

559
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:12,346
So be wary...

560
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:16,767
of very scary hairy Larry.

561
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,021
- Exactly. Yeah.
- Be wary.

562
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:22,858
Stop!

563
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:27,614
Stop that!

564
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:48,554
No!

565
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:10,663
What's up, bro?

566
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:18,004
- Guys, it's 3:00 in the morning.
- Shut up!

567
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,470
By the following morning,
we had forgotten about Scary Larry.

568
00:42:24,554 --> 00:42:28,809
I think I found the source
of your foul, mysterious odor.

569
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,951
My sausage and pepperoni
with extra cheese and double anchovy.

570
00:42:44,994 --> 00:42:46,996
I been looking for this.

571
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,265
We never heard from Larry
ever again...

572
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,100
but not two weeks later...

573
00:43:05,184 --> 00:43:08,061
Stuart told us about a slice of hair pie
he'd been trying to get a bite of.

574
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:10,440
Hip to the lingo,
we knew this meant he'd met a girl...

575
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:12,484
and was trying
to get her into bed.

576
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:18,949
How come you never say anything?

577
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,123
I'm shy.

578
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:32,173
How come...

579
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:36,886
How come you never introduce me
to any of your friends?

580
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:42,434
You want to meet my friends?

581
00:43:44,895 --> 00:43:46,856
So the nuns says to the mechanic...

582
00:43:46,898 --> 00:43:50,860
”No, but if you give me a lube job,
I'll throw you some Hail Marys”.

583
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,909
I went to Catholic school...

584
00:43:56,992 --> 00:43:59,203
and all my teachers were nuns.

585
00:44:00,997 --> 00:44:03,708
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- No, I...

586
00:44:04,584 --> 00:44:06,711
You didn't, like,
offend me or anything...

587
00:44:07,755 --> 00:44:11,509
but I remember something
that happened with the nuns once.

588
00:44:14,053 --> 00:44:17,474
Well, we took
this field trip once...

589
00:44:17,558 --> 00:44:22,105
and we were on this school bus
that was, like, really old.

590
00:44:22,188 --> 00:44:25,233
So all of a sudden
it just broke down...

591
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:29,738
and we all got out,
and we waited...

592
00:44:29,822 --> 00:44:33,284
and some of us
started wandering off.

593
00:44:33,325 --> 00:44:35,327
And we came to this path...

594
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:39,291
that led to this huge,
like, meadow...

595
00:44:39,374 --> 00:44:42,085
that was really pretty.

596
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,928
Then what happened?

597
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,392
Well, it was just
a really pretty meadow.

598
00:45:00,148 --> 00:45:01,816
That's neat.

599
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:07,072
Will you excuse me?

600
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:09,909
I have to go use
the ladies room.

601
00:45:14,956 --> 00:45:16,541
She's so sweet.

602
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,544
Will you kick this
into my forehead, please?

603
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:20,254
Shut up, all right?

604
00:45:21,506 --> 00:45:23,716
I like being around her.
When I'm around her I feel intellectual.

605
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:25,469
All things being relative.

606
00:45:25,511 --> 00:45:27,346
Besides that she's got
a really great set of titties.

607
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:30,474
- No, she doesn't.
- She does. I told her the other night.

608
00:45:30,557 --> 00:45:33,853
- I said, "You have great tits”.
- And good, like, grammar, like, too.

609
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:35,980
Like, great storytelling.

610
00:45:36,064 --> 00:45:39,275
- She's so sweet.
- She's so sweet.

611
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,072
I was out to dinner with her
the other night...

612
00:45:43,155 --> 00:45:45,616
and I asked her
if she liked Scorsese...

613
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:48,995
and she said,
"Well, I'm really not that hungry”.

614
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,670
We were efficient
at eliminating outsiders.

615
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,714
It seemed the whole world had been
divided into two categories:

616
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,593
those who got the joke,
and those who didn't.

617
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,139
We were the only ones
who got the joke.

618
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:07,976
I like her.

619
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:13,773
I think I was
especially stricken.

620
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:15,860
I thought that if Stuart and Alex
could have been...

621
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:18,445
genetically merged
into one person...

622
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,531
he or she would have been
the love of my life.

623
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:21,615
I think not.

624
00:46:22,576 --> 00:46:25,579
I promise you'll enjoy yourself.
Just slowly down...

625
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,873
- Just for a second.
- I don't want to!

626
00:46:30,168 --> 00:46:32,461
Please, just for a second.

627
00:46:32,545 --> 00:46:34,422
Right there.

628
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:40,929
Okay. All right, stop.
Okay. I understand.

629
00:46:41,013 --> 00:46:44,726
Okay. That's enough. Stop it.
Let go!

630
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:56,071
Come on, now. This is very serious.
Who else can we think of?

631
00:46:56,155 --> 00:46:58,783
Instead, I had to contend
with their matchmaking notions.

632
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:01,703
I got it. What about that teacher
of yours in your film class?

633
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:04,080
You said he was
giving you the evil eye, right?

634
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:06,542
Stuart, he's 47 years old.

635
00:47:06,626 --> 00:47:08,252
So?

636
00:47:08,294 --> 00:47:11,422
So I don't need to be fixed up,
all right? Let's just drop this.

637
00:47:11,464 --> 00:47:14,009
Yes, you do.
The question is with who.

638
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:15,719
"With whom”.

639
00:47:16,553 --> 00:47:19,098
I still think it's a job
for a young woman.

640
00:47:19,182 --> 00:47:21,100
He doesn't need pussy.

641
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:24,521
He needs dick.
Big, hard dick.

642
00:47:25,313 --> 00:47:26,941
Good-bye.

643
00:47:26,982 --> 00:47:30,694
If you're so hot on the idea,
why don't you have sex with him?

644
00:47:32,029 --> 00:47:33,865
Taste of semen makes me gag.

645
00:47:35,283 --> 00:47:37,869
How would you know?
Whose semen were you eating?

646
00:47:38,662 --> 00:47:40,289
My own.

647
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,469
So I see you got "leid”, Edward.

648
00:47:54,681 --> 00:47:56,140
What?

649
00:48:00,603 --> 00:48:02,189
Right. Yeah.

650
00:48:03,232 --> 00:48:06,193
That's a good one, Richard.

651
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:14,369
Front desk dick.

652
00:48:18,374 --> 00:48:19,792
What's up?

653
00:48:19,876 --> 00:48:21,544
Come in, Eddy.

654
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:27,259
I want you
to say hello to Richard.

655
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:31,097
- „Hello to Richard”.
- Hello, Edward.

656
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:35,476
Will you excuse me?

657
00:48:38,189 --> 00:48:39,982
See ya later.

658
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,041
This is really awkward for me.

659
00:48:55,124 --> 00:48:56,584
What is?

660
00:48:56,626 --> 00:49:02,132
Well, when Alex told me what you said,
I was sort of taken aback at first...

661
00:49:02,216 --> 00:49:05,428
but then I realized...

662
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:09,098
that I have always
felt similarly toward you.

663
00:49:09,182 --> 00:49:11,351
What exactly did she say?

664
00:49:12,436 --> 00:49:15,231
Well, you know,
that you like me...

665
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,526
but that you were too shy
to say anything.

666
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:23,073
It's funny, you know. I have always
been attracted to shy people.

667
00:49:25,325 --> 00:49:28,454
Maybe it's because
I'm pretty shy myself.

668
00:49:35,212 --> 00:49:37,256
You seem really nervous.

669
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:42,053
Maybe this is a mistake.

670
00:49:42,136 --> 00:49:44,722
- No, I'm rushing things. Aren't I?
- No, but...

671
00:49:44,806 --> 00:49:47,308
Look, I've thought you were cute
since you moved in, and I...

672
00:49:47,392 --> 00:49:48,769
Really?

673
00:49:52,398 --> 00:49:54,817
Maybe this'll help you relax.

674
00:49:57,779 --> 00:49:59,781
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

675
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,620
Damn it!

676
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:16,133
Wait a minute!
Where you going?

677
00:50:17,677 --> 00:50:20,638
Listen to me.
I know what I'm talking about.

678
00:50:20,722 --> 00:50:22,640
If you don't get sex pretty soon...

679
00:50:22,682 --> 00:50:27,438
what'll happen is your dick will just
get smaller and smaller and smaller...

680
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:30,274
until eventually it'll just shrivel up,
go up inside your body...

681
00:50:30,357 --> 00:50:32,068
and then what do you have?

682
00:50:32,152 --> 00:50:34,154
- A vagina.
- Shut up.

683
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:37,617
We're sorry.

684
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:43,122
We'll never meddle in your sex life,
or lack thereof, ever again.

685
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,417
What'd he do,
try to grab your nuts?

686
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,002
No.

687
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,048
He tried to kiss me.

688
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:56,012
I could see his nose hairs.

689
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:58,389
His breath was really bad too.

690
00:51:00,893 --> 00:51:02,853
Smelled like kitty litter.

691
00:51:10,403 --> 00:51:12,572
It did. I swear to God.

692
00:52:43,885 --> 00:52:45,846
Here it is.

693
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:52,479
It's great. Too bad we didn't
bring bathing suits, huh?

694
00:52:52,562 --> 00:52:54,439
Don't be an old fart.

695
00:53:25,558 --> 00:53:27,601
Feels good.

696
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:37,405
Come on in!

697
00:53:38,573 --> 00:53:40,616
Hurry up!

698
00:53:57,052 --> 00:53:58,721
Come on!

699
00:53:58,762 --> 00:54:01,056
- No.
- Come on, Eddy.

700
00:54:01,098 --> 00:54:05,228
No. It's cold.
It's very cold out here. I'm freezing.

701
00:54:05,312 --> 00:54:08,231
- How come you're sweating?
- It's cold sweat.

702
00:54:10,442 --> 00:54:12,069
Please?

703
00:54:16,449 --> 00:54:18,076
Come on!

704
00:54:22,205 --> 00:54:24,124
No one's looking.

705
00:54:28,671 --> 00:54:31,132
Come on.
It feels good on your balls.

706
00:54:31,216 --> 00:54:33,260
That's nice, Stuart.
That's very nice.

707
00:54:43,688 --> 00:54:46,525
Look, the moon's showing.

708
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:51,113
It's really cold!

709
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:53,283
I'm grabbing the rock.
I'm gonna drown.

710
00:56:03,362 --> 00:56:05,365
I want everyone to stay
with their fun buddy.

711
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:07,743
Nobody leaves
their fun buddy, okay?

712
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:09,494
Hey, look!

713
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:12,040
Oh, no.

714
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:17,712
Let's go.
Terry, Mary, let's go.

715
00:56:19,715 --> 00:56:21,175
This way.

716
00:56:22,927 --> 00:56:25,304
Alex said that the priest
symbolized God...

717
00:56:25,388 --> 00:56:27,390
the children, lost innocence...

718
00:56:27,474 --> 00:56:30,518
and the three of us,
a postmodern Eve with two Adams...

719
00:56:30,602 --> 00:56:32,521
banished from the sacred garden...

720
00:56:32,605 --> 00:56:35,441
to wander in the wilderness for eternity
because we had sinned.

721
00:56:35,483 --> 00:56:39,320
We had acknowledged our own nakedness
and partaken of the forbidden fruit.

722
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:47,330
Though it amounted to only a kiss...
a touch... it changed everything.

723
00:56:49,332 --> 00:56:52,293
Pandora's proverbial box
had been opened...

724
00:56:52,377 --> 00:56:54,463
but, more interestingly...

725
00:56:54,546 --> 00:56:57,758
I'm not sure any of us
wanted it closed again.

726
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:08,354
Want some pizza?

727
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:13,317
No. I'm fat.

728
00:57:14,652 --> 00:57:16,989
Alex, you're not fat.
You're skinny.

729
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,328
I'm so fat.

730
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:29,461
You know,
I've been giving it some thought.

731
00:57:30,546 --> 00:57:32,506
I think you are fat.

732
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:39,598
Don't toy with my emotions.

733
00:57:45,354 --> 00:57:47,523
Come here.

734
00:57:47,607 --> 00:57:49,483
Comfort me.

735
00:57:49,525 --> 00:57:51,570
I've been so depressed.

736
00:57:51,653 --> 00:57:53,280
Me too.

737
00:57:55,198 --> 00:57:57,702
We don't hang out
like we used to.

738
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:03,541
Let's comfort each other.

739
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:06,629
Put your head on my breast.

740
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:12,552
Is this a sex thing?

741
00:58:14,137 --> 00:58:17,807
Will you just be human for once?
Put your arms around me.

742
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:19,518
And relax.

743
00:58:26,151 --> 00:58:28,070
What are you doing, Alex?

744
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:30,989
I'm lovingly stroking your hair.

745
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,552
You can't stand to be
alone with me, can you?

746
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,057
You always want to have
Stuart along for the ride.

747
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:02,734
- It's true, isn't it?
- Yeah, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

748
00:59:05,404 --> 00:59:07,572
You're afraid of women.

749
00:59:07,614 --> 00:59:09,284
You hate women.

750
00:59:09,367 --> 00:59:11,244
Why do you hate women?

751
00:59:11,286 --> 00:59:12,578
Just stop it.

752
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:15,623
Stop it, all right?
I don't hate women.

753
00:59:15,707 --> 00:59:18,377
I don't understand why we can't just
sit here without touching each other.

754
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,045
What's wrong with touching?

755
00:59:20,129 --> 00:59:22,548
You don't try to touch
Stuart all the time, do you?

756
00:59:22,631 --> 00:59:25,260
The only reason you touch me is because
you know I don't like to be touched.

757
00:59:25,302 --> 00:59:26,261
What?

758
00:59:26,303 --> 00:59:29,431
The only reason you're attracted to me
is you know I'm not attracted back.

759
00:59:29,472 --> 00:59:31,601
- That's not true!
- It is true.

760
00:59:31,642 --> 00:59:33,936
You're looking
for a self-destructive situation.

761
00:59:33,978 --> 00:59:36,230
You are a rejection junky,
plain and simple.

762
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:39,943
What about you? You're the one who's
always drooling all over your roommate!

763
00:59:40,027 --> 00:59:43,280
- Talk about self-destructive!
- I don't drool over him!

764
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:45,325
Liar!
You know what your problem is?

765
00:59:45,408 --> 00:59:48,286
You're secretly attracted to women,
and you're afraid to admit it!

766
00:59:48,328 --> 00:59:50,121
You're a closet heterosexual!

767
00:59:50,872 --> 00:59:52,708
- I am not.
- Are too.

768
00:59:55,836 --> 00:59:58,965
- Bitch.
- Heterosexual!

769
01:00:01,635 --> 01:00:03,511
Haagen Dazs and brewskies.

770
01:00:03,553 --> 01:00:05,848
Come on, man, we can
make beer floats again.

771
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,658
What the hell was
going on in here?

772
01:00:21,741 --> 01:00:23,242
I hate him!

773
01:00:23,326 --> 01:00:25,161
I do too. So what?

774
01:00:25,203 --> 01:00:29,291
Oh, I'm so sick of this shit!

775
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,378
I'm so sick of it!
It's not normal!

776
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:36,675
It's not normal,
the three of us living together!

777
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:41,806
I'm sick of falling in love with guys
who don't give a fuck about me!

778
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:44,892
I'm not normal!
I need help!

779
01:00:44,976 --> 01:00:47,728
I need medication!

780
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:50,732
I need money!
Oh, God!

781
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:55,446
I need a facial!
I need to go on a diet!

782
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:57,907
I need new shoes!

783
01:01:00,535 --> 01:01:04,206
Oh, God!
Just do something.

784
01:01:27,399 --> 01:01:29,318
Wait, wait, wait!

785
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:36,367
Here, put it on.

786
01:01:37,786 --> 01:01:39,788
Okay. Okay.

787
01:02:14,244 --> 01:02:16,163
Don't tell Eddy.

788
01:02:32,306 --> 01:02:34,475
It's me. Are you asleep?

789
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:39,147
Just want to say I'm sorry.

790
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:40,148
It's okay.

791
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,193
I shouldn't have said any of it.

792
01:02:45,071 --> 01:02:47,031
I'm glad you called.

793
01:02:48,533 --> 01:02:51,036
I was dreaming about you.

794
01:02:52,663 --> 01:02:54,581
You were my mailman.

795
01:02:56,501 --> 01:03:00,255
And you wore those
cute little mailman shorts.

796
01:03:02,757 --> 01:03:06,304
Kept delivering me things
from the Home Shopping Network.

797
01:03:06,387 --> 01:03:09,932
Yeah, yeah. We'll have to
analyze that someday.

798
01:03:13,437 --> 01:03:14,688
Where are you?

799
01:03:14,771 --> 01:03:17,483
I'm just waiting for
my French Cinema class to start.

800
01:03:19,902 --> 01:03:22,113
I was just thinking
about women and men.

801
01:03:23,281 --> 01:03:24,742
Oh, yeah?

802
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:29,496
I think you were right
about me being afraid of women.

803
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:35,420
All men are afraid of women because
they're inherently better creatures.

804
01:03:37,339 --> 01:03:40,384
They can bear children,
they can nurse them.

805
01:03:40,426 --> 01:03:44,513
They have an infinitely higher capacity
to be compassionate.

806
01:03:44,597 --> 01:03:47,643
It's like they're
a different species.

807
01:03:47,726 --> 01:03:50,812
You were just sitting there
thinking about this?

808
01:03:50,896 --> 01:03:52,564
Yeah. It's dumb, I know.

809
01:03:55,526 --> 01:03:57,570
No, it's not.

810
01:03:57,654 --> 01:04:02,117
I feel like I understand women more.
They're more inclusive and open.

811
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:05,079
With men, there's always a feeling
that everything's a competition.

812
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,288
They're so guarded.

813
01:04:06,372 --> 01:04:07,791
Defensive.

814
01:04:10,961 --> 01:04:13,923
Well, I just never feel
competitive with you.

815
01:04:14,966 --> 01:04:16,133
I feel collaborative.

816
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,095
That's the wrong word.

817
01:04:21,473 --> 01:04:22,599
Symbiotic.

818
01:04:22,641 --> 01:04:26,520
Symbiotic.
That's a good word.

819
01:04:26,603 --> 01:04:28,690
That's a really good word.

820
01:04:29,649 --> 01:04:31,985
Listen.
I gotta get to my class.

821
01:04:32,026 --> 01:04:35,154
Wait, Eddy.
Before you go...

822
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:39,284
will you say some other words,
some really, really big words?

823
01:04:42,288 --> 01:04:44,332
Symbiotic.

824
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:47,961
Symbiosis.

825
01:04:48,003 --> 01:04:49,630
Profligate.

826
01:04:51,048 --> 01:04:54,051
Sepulchre.

827
01:04:54,135 --> 01:04:56,471
Prevaricate.
Oh, wait, wait.

828
01:04:56,513 --> 01:04:59,641
I got a good one,
I got a good one. Concupiscence.

829
01:04:59,683 --> 01:05:01,810
Concupiscence?

830
01:05:01,852 --> 01:05:05,231
That's a good one!
That's a really good one!

831
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:08,943
I gotta go.
I'm really glad we had this talk.

832
01:05:09,027 --> 01:05:10,445
Bye.

833
01:05:17,453 --> 01:05:20,623
Oh, God!
What does "concupiscence" mean?

834
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,217
Beats the shit outta me.

835
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,642
Get out.

836
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:40,271
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out.

837
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:55,955
I was beginning to realize that
I had something special in Alex.

838
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:59,042
Here was a woman who was willing
to do anything to have sex with me.

839
01:06:00,586 --> 01:06:04,048
Suddenly something
very interesting happened.

840
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:07,218
I seemed to actually
will myself into action.

841
01:06:17,689 --> 01:06:20,274
Was a whole new world
opening up to me?

842
01:06:27,032 --> 01:06:29,285
I was having another dream.

843
01:06:31,746 --> 01:06:33,873
I was in a desert...

844
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:37,753
and I had on this fur bikini...

845
01:06:38,963 --> 01:06:40,840
like Raquel Welch.

846
01:06:40,923 --> 01:06:43,844
And you were there...

847
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:53,604
as a butcher,
and you had all these sausages.

848
01:06:53,688 --> 01:06:56,566
I must still be dreaming.

849
01:06:56,649 --> 01:06:58,485
No?

850
01:06:58,569 --> 01:07:00,446
This is happening?

851
01:07:00,487 --> 01:07:02,281
This is happening.

852
01:07:13,878 --> 01:07:15,838
Is that how it's supposed to go?

853
01:07:17,089 --> 01:07:19,551
- It was perfect.
- Good.

854
01:07:20,635 --> 01:07:22,804
I'm really glad we did this.

855
01:07:22,888 --> 01:07:24,348
Me too.

856
01:07:26,017 --> 01:07:28,728
That part when my, you know...

857
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:31,481
was in with your thing and...

858
01:07:31,522 --> 01:07:34,276
- That was good?
- It was great.

859
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,778
Good.

860
01:07:41,076 --> 01:07:44,663
Maybe this should just be
our little secret.

861
01:07:49,794 --> 01:07:52,380
- So?
- So? So what?

862
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:55,926
So I had sex with a woman.

863
01:07:56,968 --> 01:07:59,930
- What?
- But it wasn't very good, though.

864
01:08:01,224 --> 01:08:05,144
- What woman did you have sex with?
- This girl in my French Cinema class.

865
01:08:05,228 --> 01:08:07,230
Well, fuckin' a, bro!

866
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:09,441
Yeah, but I didn't
really enjoy it.

867
01:08:10,317 --> 01:08:13,278
You have to change your whole outlook
on this subject matter.

868
01:08:13,362 --> 01:08:17,242
For me, sex, it's like pizza. Even
if it's bad, it's still pretty good.

869
01:08:17,325 --> 01:08:20,495
Okay, fine, whatever.
Just do me a favor. Don't tell Alex.

870
01:08:20,578 --> 01:08:22,915
- Why?
- If she finds out I had sex...

871
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:25,835
albeit mediocre sex with someone
other than her, she'll get jealous.

872
01:08:25,918 --> 01:08:29,046
Don't worry about that.
This is beautiful!

873
01:08:29,088 --> 01:08:30,716
All you need is a couple more tries.

874
01:08:30,757 --> 01:08:33,593
Before you know it,
you'll be rockin' and rollin'.

875
01:08:33,677 --> 01:08:36,764
The first time you have sex, you're so
flipped out you're actually doing it...

876
01:08:36,848 --> 01:08:39,559
you can't tell whether
you're enjoying it or not.

877
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,187
Come on, man!
God has given you a penis...

878
01:08:43,271 --> 01:08:46,900
and that penis
is meant for fucking.

879
01:08:46,942 --> 01:08:49,737
Ever hear the expression, "The little
head thinking for the big head?"

880
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:52,699
I live by that. Trust me.
It's a beautiful way to live.

881
01:08:52,782 --> 01:08:56,119
Don't worry about practicing
with somebody alive. I'll get you...

882
01:08:56,161 --> 01:08:58,581
"a blow me up, suck me off,
fuck me" doll.

883
01:08:58,622 --> 01:09:00,416
It'll suck your dick.

884
01:09:00,499 --> 01:09:02,960
You can fuck the shit out of it.
It'll be a beautiful thing.

885
01:09:03,002 --> 01:09:06,965
As Stuart ranted and raved,
something very shocking occurred to me.

886
01:09:07,007 --> 01:09:09,593
I'd always sensed something
strange about Stuart's behavior...

887
01:09:09,634 --> 01:09:12,764
something that set him apart
from your average straight guy.

888
01:09:12,805 --> 01:09:16,768
Could it be that what I'd been looking
for was right under my nose all along?

889
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:19,103
Could Stuart be a homo?

890
01:09:20,314 --> 01:09:23,108
- Are you with me on this or what?
- Absolutely.

891
01:09:25,778 --> 01:09:28,323
- I know something that you don't.
- What?

892
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:32,327
I'm not supposed to say...

893
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:34,455
but I think that Eddy
slept with a girl.

894
01:09:36,499 --> 01:09:39,460
- Who?
- He won't say...

895
01:09:40,504 --> 01:09:43,048
but I think it's some chick
from his French Cinema class.

896
01:09:44,132 --> 01:09:45,550
That's nice.

897
01:09:45,634 --> 01:09:48,262
- You want me to come scrub your back?
- Sure.

898
01:09:55,062 --> 01:09:57,022
He thought you'd be jealous.

899
01:09:57,064 --> 01:09:58,524
I can handle it.

900
01:10:00,275 --> 01:10:03,947
There's really nothing to be jealous
about because he said it was lousy.

901
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:07,992
- What was?
- The sex.

902
01:10:10,663 --> 01:10:12,998
He said that she was
a lousy lay.

903
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,167
There's nothing worse
than a lousy lay.

904
01:10:15,251 --> 01:10:18,839
I remember this girl
from high school, Monica Bryson.

905
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:22,759
She was like...

906
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:25,013
like a piece of fish loaf.

907
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:27,849
I mean she was really
un-fuckin'-believably bad.

908
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:32,354
I think that I'd rather have a dog fart
in my face than be with her again.

909
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:35,941
Ow! You're hurting me.

910
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:39,529
- With this?
- Yes!

911
01:10:39,571 --> 01:10:43,033
I think you're upset because
I called her a piece of fish loaf.

912
01:10:43,074 --> 01:10:44,535
I apologize.

913
01:10:45,578 --> 01:10:48,289
Perhaps I should've said
she was a skanky, fishy bitch wad.

914
01:10:48,372 --> 01:10:51,877
Just get out!
Just get out! Get out!

915
01:11:00,261 --> 01:11:02,555
So I was a lousy lay, huh?

916
01:11:04,057 --> 01:11:06,101
What did you say?

917
01:11:06,185 --> 01:11:09,897
Never mind! You weren't supposed
to say anything. It was a secret!

918
01:11:12,191 --> 01:11:16,154
I didn't tell him it was you.
Besides, it wasn't lousy.

919
01:11:16,237 --> 01:11:17,655
It was pretty good, considering...

920
01:11:17,739 --> 01:11:20,242
- Considering what?
- Considering that you're a girl!

921
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,955
I shouldn't have.

922
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:26,958
I mean, I don't know.

923
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:29,127
I don't know what the hell I know.

924
01:11:30,212 --> 01:11:32,130
I felt like an impostor.

925
01:11:37,512 --> 01:11:39,472
I am so confused.

926
01:11:44,478 --> 01:11:47,564
It's okay. It was fine.

927
01:11:47,648 --> 01:11:49,442
We just need to practice.

928
01:11:49,526 --> 01:11:53,613
I don't think I can. Anyway,
I think I figured out something.

929
01:11:53,697 --> 01:11:55,031
What?

930
01:11:55,115 --> 01:11:56,367
Come on now.

931
01:11:57,451 --> 01:11:59,370
I think Stu is...

932
01:11:59,453 --> 01:12:01,497
What?

933
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:05,293
I think he likes boys more than he likes
girls. He's just afraid to admit it.

934
01:12:08,338 --> 01:12:10,550
Think about it.
It makes total sense.

935
01:12:10,633 --> 01:12:14,679
He's obsessed with male genitalia. All
he does is talk about cocks and fucking.

936
01:12:14,762 --> 01:12:17,850
He's a complete misogynist.
Women are just objects to him.

937
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:20,644
He's a total narcissist.
He has intense self-body worship.

938
01:12:20,728 --> 01:12:23,272
He has an absent father, a domineering
mother. And if that's not enough...

939
01:12:23,355 --> 01:12:25,775
he knows all the lyrics
to Oklahoma and The Music Man.

940
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:28,820
He's a classic closet case.
I know, it's crazy, right?

941
01:12:28,903 --> 01:12:32,700
We don't see what we don't want to see,
but I don't think he knows.

942
01:12:32,783 --> 01:12:35,703
- I'm going to help him find out.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

943
01:12:40,584 --> 01:12:42,794
How much did that bottle cost you?

944
01:12:42,878 --> 01:12:44,171
Money is no object...

945
01:12:44,212 --> 01:12:47,759
when it comes to getting
totally shit-faced.

946
01:13:01,733 --> 01:13:04,027
- Shh. Shh.
- What?

947
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,196
- Wait a minute.
- What do you hear?

948
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:08,574
What?

949
01:13:08,657 --> 01:13:11,160
How did we get on the ceiling?

950
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:14,164
- Uh-oh.
- How did we get on the ceiling?

951
01:13:14,247 --> 01:13:16,708
Did you pay
the gravity bill this morning?

952
01:13:21,047 --> 01:13:23,091
I forgot!

953
01:13:25,676 --> 01:13:27,303
I'm sorry.

954
01:13:29,223 --> 01:13:31,225
It's okay.

955
01:13:31,266 --> 01:13:36,106
It's no problem. I forgive you. Let's
just get back on the floor 'cause...

956
01:13:40,276 --> 01:13:43,197
- What?
- We're going back on the floor.

957
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,950
- Fasten your seat belt.
- Look out, floor!

958
01:13:46,033 --> 01:13:47,743
Back on the floor.

959
01:13:47,785 --> 01:13:49,913
Are you seeing anything?

960
01:13:52,249 --> 01:13:53,959
I told you so.

961
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:57,547
- Don't. You're gonna ruin everything.
- Look at that.

962
01:13:58,965 --> 01:14:00,299
He's wrong for you!

963
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:05,723
What are they doing?
Oh, my God!

964
01:14:06,932 --> 01:14:09,727
It's like a devil worship thing.

965
01:14:11,604 --> 01:14:13,189
It's not working.

966
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:20,448
I don't feel so good.

967
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:27,122
God!

968
01:14:27,164 --> 01:14:29,124
I'm going to be sick.

969
01:14:33,963 --> 01:14:35,882
Just breathe easy.

970
01:14:52,025 --> 01:14:54,487
That feels good.

971
01:14:54,528 --> 01:14:56,489
- You okay?
- Yeah.

972
01:15:05,957 --> 01:15:07,543
Whoa, Eddy.

973
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,261
You'll spoil it.

974
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:20,140
Spoil what?

975
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:21,810
The intimacy.

976
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:26,773
Intimacy?

977
01:15:34,824 --> 01:15:37,702
Eddy, there's not
gonna be any intimacy.

978
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:42,374
Okay. Just empty sex is fine.

979
01:15:45,378 --> 01:15:48,881
Eddy, are you okay?
Because you're pretty drunk.

980
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:50,551
And so are you.

981
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:55,597
I don't like guys, okay?

982
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:57,892
Yes, you do.

983
01:15:57,934 --> 01:16:00,645
No, I don't.

984
01:16:04,275 --> 01:16:06,569
Stuart, you're
a classic closet case.

985
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:09,405
Eddy, listen to me.

986
01:16:09,447 --> 01:16:13,368
You got all the telltale signs.
You got absent Oklahoma...

987
01:16:13,452 --> 01:16:15,412
Music Mother, the...

988
01:16:16,246 --> 01:16:17,831
I like girls.

989
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,461
I like them a lot.

990
01:16:24,005 --> 01:16:25,340
I fuck them.

991
01:16:27,634 --> 01:16:31,096
No, see, you don't. You talk about
doin' it, but you don't do it.

992
01:16:31,138 --> 01:16:33,266
It's called denial. Right?

993
01:16:33,308 --> 01:16:36,519
I'm an expert at denial.
I can see that a mile away.

994
01:16:37,896 --> 01:16:40,191
So then how come
I'm fuckin' one right now?

995
01:16:42,526 --> 01:16:46,406
I see, you're fucking an imaginary girl,
right now. Is that it?

996
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:48,992
You've got an imaginary girl?

997
01:16:52,162 --> 01:16:55,041
He's got an imaginary...

998
01:16:55,124 --> 01:16:58,127
It's just me and you here.

999
01:17:00,672 --> 01:17:03,592
Oh, no, she's not imaginary.

1000
01:17:05,302 --> 01:17:08,515
She's somebody
that you know quite well.

1001
01:17:08,598 --> 01:17:13,144
And every day that you skip off to your
little fuckin' French Cinema class...

1002
01:17:13,186 --> 01:17:15,189
we fuck like dogs...

1003
01:17:15,272 --> 01:17:18,025
and her name is Alex.

1004
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:39,550
I see.

1005
01:17:43,053 --> 01:17:45,932
"I see”, said the blind man.

1006
01:17:58,989 --> 01:18:00,532
Oh, shit.

1007
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:11,127
Look out!

1008
01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:14,882
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Shit, he's bleeding.

1009
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:16,508
Oh, my God.

1010
01:18:38,241 --> 01:18:41,746
And then I said that I didn't
like guys. He didn't believe me.

1011
01:18:41,829 --> 01:18:44,832
He said I was in denial.
I said, "I like girls”.

1012
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:47,252
He still didn't believe me.
That's when it just came out.

1013
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:48,921
What?

1014
01:18:49,838 --> 01:18:51,090
That you and I...

1015
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:52,925
- You know.
- What?

1016
01:18:52,966 --> 01:18:54,803
That we're fucking, okay?

1017
01:18:54,886 --> 01:18:56,304
You idiot!

1018
01:18:56,346 --> 01:18:57,972
- God!
- I was drunk.

1019
01:18:58,056 --> 01:18:59,766
He was touching me.
I freaked out.

1020
01:18:59,849 --> 01:19:03,437
- That's all I can do from here.
- I don't need any stitches?

1021
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:05,481
Stitches are next semester.

1022
01:19:33,555 --> 01:19:36,641
In the morning, I went
to my film class as usual.

1023
01:19:36,684 --> 01:19:39,019
Prophetically enough,
they showed an old French film...

1024
01:19:39,103 --> 01:19:41,897
about two men and a woman
in a love triangle.

1025
01:19:41,981 --> 01:19:45,318
Both the men loved the same woman,
and it slowly made her go insane.

1026
01:19:46,528 --> 01:19:48,238
In the end, she killed herself
and one of the men...

1027
01:19:48,321 --> 01:19:50,490
by driving her car off
of a bridge.

1028
01:19:52,201 --> 01:19:54,287
I understood
the moral of the story...

1029
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:57,081
two's company,
three's pathetic.

1030
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:00,169
I knew what I had to do.

1031
01:20:11,347 --> 01:20:13,267
Still not funny.

1032
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:17,688
He's moving out.

1033
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:20,233
I don't want you to move out.

1034
01:20:20,317 --> 01:20:23,361
- Why not?
- I don't wanna be alone with him.

1035
01:20:29,744 --> 01:20:31,704
I'll move out then.

1036
01:20:33,372 --> 01:20:35,250
Okay.

1037
01:20:35,334 --> 01:20:37,127
Fuck you.

1038
01:20:37,211 --> 01:20:38,545
You wish.

1039
01:20:42,425 --> 01:20:44,052
Fuck both of you.

1040
01:20:46,554 --> 01:20:47,973
You wish.

1041
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:55,232
Don't you?

1042
01:23:36,623 --> 01:23:38,251
I'm pregnant.

1043
01:23:44,257 --> 01:23:45,676
I think.

1044
01:23:46,969 --> 01:23:51,098
"Within two minutes, the white tab
on the plastic stick may change color.

1045
01:23:51,182 --> 01:23:55,437
If the white tab remains white,
the test is negative.

1046
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,982
If the tab turns pale blue,
the test is positive”.

1047
01:23:59,065 --> 01:24:02,570
If the tab turns pink, you
have been impregnated by a homosexual.

1048
01:24:08,994 --> 01:24:10,621
Nothing's happening.

1049
01:24:13,165 --> 01:24:16,169
- What do we do if it's positive?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1050
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:17,962
I mean...

1051
01:24:23,928 --> 01:24:25,513
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1052
01:24:34,773 --> 01:24:38,820
If I can just get through this part,
everything's gonna be fine.

1053
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:41,864
I just want to get on
to the next part of my life.

1054
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:45,786
This part sucks.

1055
01:24:45,869 --> 01:24:47,454
This part sucks?

1056
01:24:49,707 --> 01:24:51,167
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

1057
01:24:52,001 --> 01:24:54,838
Oh, Eddy, I'm nervous, okay?

1058
01:24:55,964 --> 01:24:58,050
I don't think that's it.

1059
01:24:58,134 --> 01:25:01,679
You two wanna get the hell out of here
and forget this ever happened!

1060
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,807
Why haven't we been
hanging out lately?

1061
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:07,519
How come we haven't talked
in the past couple of weeks, huh?

1062
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:11,023
Maybe you guys can just walk away
and look for something else...

1063
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:13,025
but it's not that easy for me.

1064
01:25:14,402 --> 01:25:17,948
Eddy, nobody's gettin' out easy.

1065
01:25:19,533 --> 01:25:20,450
Nobody.

1066
01:25:20,534 --> 01:25:22,327
You understand that?

1067
01:25:46,272 --> 01:25:47,857
Oh, my God.

1068
01:25:50,902 --> 01:25:53,071
Just prop your head up.
Stuart, come on.

1069
01:25:53,113 --> 01:25:55,282
Oh, Jesus.

1070
01:25:55,365 --> 01:25:57,409
What made this happen?

1071
01:25:57,493 --> 01:25:59,578
I was...

1072
01:25:59,661 --> 01:26:03,166
talking toJesus.

1073
01:26:03,249 --> 01:26:04,918
Did he sayJesus or Elvis?

1074
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:06,377
Jesus.

1075
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:08,797
He said I should cut my penis off...

1076
01:26:08,881 --> 01:26:10,925
Oh, God.

1077
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:14,387
because it was the cause
of all my problems.

1078
01:26:14,471 --> 01:26:18,892
Stuart, you don't have
to cut your pee-pee off.

1079
01:26:20,936 --> 01:26:23,314
You just can't let it
run your life.

1080
01:26:41,668 --> 01:26:44,171
Home free. No baby.

1081
01:26:55,892 --> 01:26:58,729
The semester and the year
would be over in three weeks...

1082
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:00,940
whereupon Alex would move
to an apartment.

1083
01:27:06,864 --> 01:27:08,824
I'll call you guys later.

1084
01:27:20,421 --> 01:27:23,841
Stuart went home for the summer
and moved to another dorm in the fall.

1085
01:27:24,884 --> 01:27:28,680
I noticed that he never seemed quite the
same after that episode in the bathroom.

1086
01:27:49,496 --> 01:27:52,540
We all tried to keep in touch,
but you know how it is.

1087
01:27:53,792 --> 01:27:55,836
The next semester
I got a single...

1088
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,047
a room all to myself.

1089
01:27:58,130 --> 01:28:01,176
Solitude brought out
the worst in me.

1090
01:28:01,259 --> 01:28:04,054
It gave me time to brood over
the nature of things.

1091
01:28:05,263 --> 01:28:10,061
I wondered how some people can be such a
necessary part of one's life one day...

1092
01:28:10,102 --> 01:28:12,230
and simply vanish the next.

1093
01:28:23,409 --> 01:28:25,662
Isn't it supposed to last?

1094
01:28:27,831 --> 01:28:30,084
We ran into each other
at graduation.

1095
01:28:32,127 --> 01:28:35,339
And we had lunch
about a year after that.

1096
01:28:35,422 --> 01:28:38,927
It was nice to see them,
but it wasn't like the old days.

1097
01:28:41,054 --> 01:28:45,768
Stuart ended up becoming monogamous
to a girl, if you can believe that.

1098
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:48,271
In fact, I heard
they even got married.

1099
01:28:50,314 --> 01:28:53,151
Alex, on the other hand, enjoyed
staying single for a long time...

1100
01:28:53,235 --> 01:28:57,239
though she admitted to sometimes missing
the rejection from doomed relationships.

1101
01:28:57,322 --> 01:29:00,493
Whenever I talk to her, she always
manages to refer to my boyfriend as...

1102
01:29:00,577 --> 01:29:02,495
"the other woman”.

1103
01:29:04,455 --> 01:29:07,293
My college experience
wasn't what I'd planned.

1104
01:29:07,334 --> 01:29:11,882
It bore no resemblance
to the pictures in the brochure.

1105
01:29:11,965 --> 01:29:14,426
But I'm not unhappy.

1106
01:29:14,509 --> 01:29:16,595
I don't think any of us are.

1107
01:29:17,345 --> 01:29:19,307
We got what we needed out of it.

1108
01:29:20,683 --> 01:29:24,604
It's kind of like when you go
on vacation. You plan everything out.

1109
01:29:26,899 --> 01:29:30,819
But then one day you make
a wrong turn or take a detour...

1110
01:29:30,861 --> 01:29:34,949
and you end up in some crazy place
you can't even find on the map...

1111
01:29:35,033 --> 01:29:37,327
doing something you never
thought you'd do.

1112
01:29:39,037 --> 01:29:42,082
Maybe you feel a little lost
while it's happening.

1113
01:29:43,584 --> 01:29:46,629
But later you realize it was
the best part of the whole trip.
