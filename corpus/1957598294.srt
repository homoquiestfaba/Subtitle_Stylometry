00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,895
AND RUSH, I RECKON YOU DID.

192
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,031
SEEMS YOU PASSED A COUPLE OF

193
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,232
FEDERAL AGENTS ON THE WAY DOWN

194
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,800
LAST NIGHT.

195
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,136
HEH. THEY WERE MORE THAN

196
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,171
A LITTLE PISSED THIS MORNING.

197
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,840
SEEMS THEY WAS IN THE PROCESS

198
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:41,907
OF DRIVING INTO A DITCH

199
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,242
AS YOU FLEW BY.

200
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,477
THEY RECKONED YOU COULD'VE

201
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,745
HELPED THEM.

202
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,313
 WHAT, TO GET IN THE DITCH?

203
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,715
 ( chuckles )

204
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,050
THEY SUSPECT YOU WAS CARRYIN'

205
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,785
A TANK FULL OF MOON.

206
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,220
 THAT'S ILLEGAL, AIN'T IT?

207
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,821
 YEAH.

208
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,724
SO IS SPEEDING.

209
00:10:58,758 --> 00:10:59,859
WHAT'S OLD HOOCH GOT THE

210
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,093
LINCOLN PULLIN' THESE DAYS?

211
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,096
ABOUT 500 HORSES?

212
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,164
I HEAR IT'LL DO

213
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,832
MORE THAN A BUCK-SEVENTY.

214
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,170
 YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

215
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,172
THE COFFEE AIN'T THAT SPECIAL.

216
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,042
I'D BEST BE GETTIN'

217
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,244
BACK UP THE MOUNTAIN.

218
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,181
ETHYL.

219
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,852
SHERIFF.

220
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,525
 IF I'D KNOW HE WAS BUYING,

221
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,826
I'D HAVE ORDERED BREAKFAST.

222
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,828
( chuckles )

223
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,130
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HANG AROUND

224
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,866
A DUMB HILLBILLY LIKE THAT FOR?

225
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,334
HE'S JUST PLAYIN' WITH YOU.

226
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,103
LET ME OUT, WENDAL.

227
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,171
 WAIT A MINUTE.

228
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,806
SIT DOWN HERE.

229
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,973
DON'T RUSH OFF.

230
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,209
WE NEVER TALK ANYMORE.

231
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,377
 WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

232
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,878
TO TALK ABOUT, WENDAL.

233
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,180
IT'S OVER BETWEEN US.

234
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,848
 OH, WE HAD A LOT OF GOOD

235
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,849
TIMES, DIDN'T WE?

236
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,084
 AND A LOT OF BAD TIMES.

237
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,118
DON'T MAKE THIS MORE DIFFICULT

238
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,152
FOR ME OR FOR YOU.

239
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,854
PLEASE JUST SIGN THE PAPERS.

240
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,255
 I AIN'T SIGNING SHIT.

241
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,290
 IT'S FINISHED BETWEEN US,

242
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,891
WENDAL!

243
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,830
 DON'T YOU EVER RAISE YOUR

244
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,332
VOICE TO ME, YOU UNDERSTAND?

245
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,403
 PLEASE JUST LET ME GO,

246
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,838
WENDAL.

247
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,773
I'VE GOT TO GO.

248
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,177
 GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE.

249
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,790
LORNA?

250
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,961
GOIN' COLD ON ME.

251
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,064
 IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING

252
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,432
GOIN' COLD.

253
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,001
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GIVE UP?

254
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,170
 HEH. SHE KEEPS WANTING

255
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,906
TO COME BACK.

256
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,375
 YOU GONNA BE AROUND TONIGHT?

257
00:12:56,408 --> 00:13:00,079
 YEAH. I GOTTA WORK.

258
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,014
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

259
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,171
 McCULLOUGH!

260
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,850
COME ON, DOG.

261
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,912
 GO OKAY?

262
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,247
 FINE.

263
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,381
 SEE ETHYL?

264
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,383
 YEAH, I DID.

265
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,053
YOU GOT A LOAD FOR ME TONIGHT?

266
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,021
 THERE'S A MEETING TONIGHT.

267
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,389
 ABOUT RUNNIN' CONVOYS?

268
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,092
 YEP. AND DECOYS.

269
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,160
 WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK

270
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,394
OF THAT.

271
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,530
 WELL, YOU MAY NOT NEED ONE.

272
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,965
BUT YOU COULD DECOY

273
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,132
FOR OTHER DRIVERS.

274
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,068
BE LESS RISK OF GETTIN' KILLED.

275
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,169
 WOULD THEM OTHER DRIVERS

276
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,337
BE THE CLAYTONS?

277
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,005
 CLEM'S A GOOD DRIVER.

278
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,473
A GOOD FELLA.

279
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,242
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR YOU

280
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,509
WHEN YOU NEEDED HELP.

281
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,044
CLEM'S FINE.

282
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,313
HIS COUSINS ARE LOOSE CANNONS.

283
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,448
 IF CLAYTON WANTS TO STAY

284
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,016
IN THE LIQUOR BUSINESS, ALL HIS

285
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,150
BOYS ARE GONNA HAVE TO DRIVE.

286
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,218
THERE'S NO SENSE

287
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,153
IN YOU DOING EVERY RUN.

288
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,555
YOU'LL GET FINISHED BURNIN' UP

289
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,990
ON THAT DAMN HIGHWAY,

290
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,424
IS WHAT YOU'LL DO.

291
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,426
 HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

292
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,561
 IT'S ABOUT TIME A FELLA

293
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,263
OF YOUR AGE GAVE HIS OLD MAN

294
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,098
SOME GRANDKIDS.

295
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,165
WELL, THERE'S MORE TO LIFE

296
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,300
THAN JUST RUNNIN' UP AND DOWN

297
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,402
THAT DAMN MOUNTAIN AT 140.

298
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,436
YOU CAN LEAVE THAT TO GUYS

299
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,038
LIKE THE CLAYTON BOYS.

300
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,039
AT LEAST THERE'S TWO MORE

301
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,340
OF THEM IF CLEM GETS

302
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,109
WRECKED UP SOME DAMN TREE.

303
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,310
 THOSE BOYS AIN'T SAFE.

304
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,278
THEY DRINK MORE MOON

305
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,979
THAN I HAUL.

306
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,547
 IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE?

307
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,049
SAFE?

308
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,150
 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

309
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,418
BETWEEN FAST AND DANGEROUS.

310
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,255
I'M FAST, THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

311
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,524
 NOW, AS YOU ALL KNOW,

312
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,092
THE FEDS HAVE SENT UP

313
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,194
A NEW TEAM FROM MEMPHIS.

314
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,397
SINGLE CARS ARE GONNA BE

315
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,232
TOO RISKY FOR A WHILE.

316
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,266
I BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

317
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,201
START RUNNING CONVOYS.

318
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,070
WHAT WE GOTTA DECIDE IS,

319
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,438
WHO'S GONNA BE RUNNIN' DECOY,

320
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,007
AND WHO'S GONNA LEAD.

321
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,084
 GOOD EVENING, BOYS.

322
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,988
DON'T MIND ME.

323
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,107
NOW, PARKER...

324
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,109
YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT YOUR

325
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,445
BOY MADE FOUR RUNS LAST WEEK.

326
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,446
 ONE OF YOUR DEPUTIES

327
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,214
CHASED HIM FOR 20 MILES.

328
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,349
 GOTTA MAKE A SHOW OF IT

329
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,817
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

330
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,452
KEEPS YOU BOYS ON YOUR TOES.

331
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,372
GENTLEMEN, THERE'S GONNA BE

332
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,108
SOME CHANGES AROUND HERE.

333
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,642
THESE SPECIAL AGENTS HAVE BEEN

334
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,144
SENT UP HERE TO PUT AN END

335
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,545
TO YOUR OPERATION.

336
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,115
I THINK THEY'RE ON TO OUR

337
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,516
LITTLE ARRANGEMENT.

338
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,852
WE RUB THEIR NOSES IN IT,

339
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,653
WE'RE ALL GONNA GO DOWN.

340
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,122
SO, YOU'RE GONNA STOP

341
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,656
RUNNIN' FOR A WHILE.

342
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,691
 STOP RUNNIN'?

343
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:06,692
 JUST FOR A COUPLE OF

344
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,627
MONTHS--THREE OR FOUR, TOPS.

345
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,262
 A COUPLE OF MONTHS?

346
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,530
YOU'VE BEEN PAID.

347
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,265
TAKE CARE OF IT!

348
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,400
 IT PAYS FOR WHAT'S GONE ON

349
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,401
BEFORE, NOT FOR WHAT'S

350
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,435
GONNA GO ON.

351
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,436
 I AIN'T GONNA WAIT.

352
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,570
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS.

353
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,639
MY BOYS WILL RUN AS USUAL.

354
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,307
( indistinct muttering )

355
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,409
 YOU'RE ALL RICHER THAN GOD.

356
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,676
WHY DO YOU WANT TO PUSH IT?

357
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,145
 'CAUSE IT'S OUR RIGHT.

358
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,179
 IT'S AGAINST THE LAW.

359
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,514
( all laugh )

360
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,349
 OUR KIN WERE MAKIN' MOON

361
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,450
IN THESE MOUNTAINS

362
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,585
BEFORE THERE
WAS 
 LAW.

363
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,588
 ( chuckles ) YOU OLD FARTS,

364
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,323
YOU OUGHT TO COME DOWN OFF THIS

365
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,491
HILL SOMETIMES AND TAKE

366
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,726
A LOOK AT THE REAL WORLD.

367
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,295
THE DAYS OF OUTRUNNING SOME FED

368
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,363
WHO MIGHT IMPOUND YOUR CAR,

369
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,098
THEY'RE OVER.

370
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,702
 MY BOYS ARE GOING TO RUN.

371
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,405
IF THAT MEANS RUNNIN' CONVOYS,

372
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,240
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

373
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,909
BUT WE'RE GONNA RUN.

374
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,744
 THEY CLAYTON BOYS RUN...

375
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:02,548
SO WILL JED.

376
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,622
 WELL, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

377
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,191

00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,163

THEY CALL IT STOCK CAR RACING.

629
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,437
 IT'S SLOWER, THOUGH.

630
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,571

KILLED FOR A LIVING ARE GONE.

GOIN' UP AGAINST HIM?

756
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,889
 KNOCKING HIM OFF HIS PERCH

757
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,492
WOULD BE A PLEASURE.

758
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,627

00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:22,386
YOUR FAMILY'S ALREADY LOST ONE.

878
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,988

00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:24,274
 I SAW YOU JUST NOW OUTSIDE.

IT'S A SHAME, AIN'T IT?

904
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,277
ALL THAT TAXPAYERS' MONEY

905
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,513
WENT INTO TRAINING YOU, ENDS UP

906
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,115
BEING USED IN A STREET BRAWL.

907
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,383
 I DONE MORE THAN MY SHARE

908
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,384
FOR THIS COUNTRY

909
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,986
AND ITS TAXPAYERS.

910
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,120
 I KNOW, I READ YOUR

911
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,322
WAR RECORD.

912
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,957
YOU'RE VERY IMPRESSIVE.

913
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,325
DECORATED BY THE PRESIDENT.

914
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,492
HEH.

915
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,493
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO

916
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,528
TO JAIL NOW, DO YOU?

917
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,296
NOT AFTER ALL THAT.

00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,397
 LAST I HEARD, YOU GOTTA GET

00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,932

THEY SEND YOU TO JAIL.

921
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,968
NOW, HAS THAT CHANGED?

922
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:51,969
 NO, NO, THAT'S STILL

923
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,103
THE WAY IT GOES.

924
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,972
THE THING IS, SOMEONE ELSE

925
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,940
CAN GET CAUGHT AND THEN TAKE

926
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,408
ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE DOWN

927
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,210
WITH HIM.

928
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,445
 THERE'S NO SENSE WORRYING

929
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,946
ABOUT WHAT ANOTHER FELLA

930
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,915
MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT DO.

931
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,453
 WHY THE HELL'S A GUY LIKE

00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,025
FOR WHAT?

936
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,294
IS IT THE DANGER, EXCITEMENT?

937
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,329
WHAT? IT SURE AS HELL CAN'T BE

938
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:20,530
JUST MONEY.

939
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,132
WHAT IS IT?

940
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,101
 WELL, SOME PEOPLE DO THINGS

941

00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:01,017
 AGENT RICKMAN, REVENUE.

1127
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,688
 WHO THE HELL'S THAT GUY?

1128
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:08,091
IS THAT DWAYNE DAYTON?

1129
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,059

WHAT THE HELL YOU WANT FROM ME?

1132
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,099
I AIN'T GOT NO HOOCH ON BOARD!

1133
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,768
I'M ONLY CARRYIN' SUGAR!

1134
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:19,969
 WELL, THAT'S A HELL OF

1135
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,272
A LOT OF SUGAR.

1136
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,040
MAYBE IF I CRUISED UP THAT DIRT

1137
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,508
ROAD BACK THERE, I WONDER

1138
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,709
WHAT I'D FIND--MAYBE A STILL?

1139
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:27,844
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1140
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,512
 ( crying )

1141
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,613
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1142
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:31,915
 JUST SOME INFORMATION.

1143
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,716
NAMES, DATES, THAT SORT

1144
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,585
OF THING.

1145
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,554
WHAT ARE YOU?!

1146
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,489

1147
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,026

1152
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,732

1153
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:50,733
SHIT, YOU'LL GO DOWN FOR

1154
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:51,901
THREE YEARS ANYWAY, UNLESS YOU

1155
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,136
GET YOUR GODDAMN HEAD

1156
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,838
BLOWN OFF FIRST.

1157
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:03,580
YOU GIVE ME NAMES, DATES,

1158
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:04,714
DESTINATIONS, I'LL KEEP YOU

1159
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,816
OUT OF IT.

1160
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,018
IT'S YOUR CALL, BOY.

1161
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:21,631
 YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH,

1162
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,932
BILLY BOB, HOW ABOUT A COFFEE?

1163
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,142
THAT'S WHAT GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU

1164
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,644
IF YOU STAY AROUND HERE.

1165
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,080
END UP DRUNK AND ALONE.

1166
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:39,182
I HEARD ABOUT YOUR FIGHT.

1167
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,117
 JUST A COUPLE OF

1168
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,952
MOUNTAIN BOYS.

1169
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,053
 YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL AROUND

1170
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,054

1171
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,657
THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

1172
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,125
YOU DON'T GET ME OUT OF HERE,

1173
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,094
I'M GONNA DO IT MYSELF.

1174
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,095
I'M GONNA GO,

1175
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:53,129
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

1176
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:54,831
 PAPPY AIN'T READY YET.

1177
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,766
 NO, JED. IT'S YOU,

1178
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,668
NOT HIM, THAT AIN'T READY.

1179
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,637
 ETHYL.

1180
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,171
 HOOCH.

1181
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,373
 IT'S DONE.

1182
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:04,674
PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

1183
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,942
 EVERYTHING?

1184
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:07,010
 YEAH, PAINT'S DRYING NOW.

1185
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,711
 GREAT! WELL, YOU GOT

1186
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:09,779
THREE DAYS.

1187
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:10,813
YOU'RE STILL RUNNIN' LIQUOR

1188
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,081
DOWN THAT MOUNTAIN AFTER THAT,

1189
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:15,018
YOU'RE GONNA FIND ME GONE.

1190
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,153
 GIVE ME A SMOKE, WOULD YOU?

1191
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,389
HMM. I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS

1192
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,090
GONNA TAKE A FEW DAYS.

1193
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:22,859
 WELL, HOW THE HELL ELSE

1194
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,027
WAS I GONNA GET YOU DOWN

1195
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,161
TO THE TRACK?

1196
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:28,965
WHOO-WHEE!

1197
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:30,967
LOOK AT YOU, LORNA!

1198
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,402
NEED A DATE?

1199
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,736
YOU LOOK GREAT.

1200
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:34,871
 SHE'S WAITIN' FOR WENDAL,

1201
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,639
NOT YOU, HOOCH.

1202
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,975
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN--

1203
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,011
 DID JED TELL YOU...

1204
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:43,780
I FINALLY GOT HIM DOWN TO

1205
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,415
THE TRACK TODAY?

1206
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:47,050
 I'M IMPRESSED.

1207
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,818
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

1208
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:50,853
 BY PROMISING TO SHUT UP.

1209
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,723
 ( laughs )

1210
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,991
HE WAS IMPRESSED.

1211
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:55,992
WASN'T YOU, JED?

1212
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:56,993
 OH, THE HELL I WAS.

1213
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:57,994
 WAS?

1214
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,195
 ON A REAL ROAD, THOSE BOYS

1215
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:00,229
COULDN'T RUN FAST ENOUGH

1216
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,731
TO KEEP WARM.

1217
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,868
( telephone rings )

1218
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,136
 YEAH, HELLO?

1219
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,871
WHO?

1220
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:10,873
IS THERE A RICKMAN HERE?

1221
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,009
 YEAH!

1222
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,051
 SCOOT OVER, HOOCH.

1223
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:25,254
ANOTHER BEER.

1224
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,756
 IS THERE ANYWHERE ELSE

1225
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,690
MORE PRIVATE?

1226
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:28,791
 YOU WANT PRIVATE, DON'T TAKE

1227
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:31,761
YOUR CALLS IN A BAR.

1228
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,162
 GOOD-LOOKIN' GUY FOR YOU.

1229
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:34,897
 HONEY, YOU JUST REMEMBER

1230
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,265
SOMETHING--NO MATTER HOW

1231
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,300
GOOD-LOOKIN' OR HANDSOME

1232
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,968
THEY SEEM, SOMEWHERE,

1233
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,036
TO SOME WOMAN,

1234
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,204
THEY'RE A PAIN IN THE ASS.

1235
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,272
 ROSE, DO I DETECT A HINT

1236
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,941
OF BITTERNESS THERE?

1237
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,209
 OH, YOU JUST GO WASH UP

1238
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,910
YOUR HANDS BEFORE YOU GREASE UP

1239
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,278
MY BAR.

1240
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,882
 WHEN?

1241
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:54,484
WHERE'S IT GOIN'?

1242
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:55,818
 DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.

1243
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:57,487
 THAT AIN'T VERY SPECIFIC.

1244
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,789
WHO?

1245
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,190
 A FED.

1246
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,259
REVENUE MAN.

1247
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,961
 REALLY?

1248
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,295
LOOKS TOO NICE.

1249
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,197
THOUGHT THEY WERE ALL SCUMBAGS

1250
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:09,866
LIKE WENDAL.

1251
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:11,200
 YOU MARRIED HIM.

1252
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:13,136
 AND I LEFT HIM.

1253
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,203
AT LEAST
I
 DIDN'T RUN OUT

1254
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,305
WITHOUT TELLIN' YOU.

1255
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,778
HE CAME AROUND AGAIN, JED.

1256
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:23,179
WELL...

1257
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,750
 WHAT KIND OF TIME?

1258
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:29,919
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1259
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:31,187
SHIT, NOT TILL I SAY SO,

1260
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,989
THAT'S WHEN.

1261
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:41,998
I'LL SETTLE UP.

1262
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,743
SHERIFF.

1263
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,026
 HI, WENDAL.

1264
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,060
 LORNA.

1265
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,128
 I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BE

1266
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,096
A LITTLE EARLIER.

1267
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:14,797
 I GOT TIED UP.

1268
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:16,833
 DO YOU LIKE THE DRESS?

1269
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:17,934
I WAS GONNA WEAR THE TAFFETA,

1270
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,135
BUT I KNOW HOW MUCH

1271
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:20,870
YOU LIKE LACE.

1272
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,338
I GOT IT OVER AT EDNA'S

1273
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:24,373
BOUTIQUE AFTER WORK ONE DAY.

1274
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,942
 GO AND GET THE CAR.

1275
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,276
I OUGHT TO GO HOME.

1276
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,011
 MM-HMM.

1277
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:30,146
 STAY.

1278
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,814
 THAT'S JUST WHAT WE NEED--

1279
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:32,882
HAVE HIM COME AROUND

1280
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,050
AND SHOOT US BOTH.

1281
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,252
 STAY AT THE HOTEL, THEN.

1282
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:38,087
 OHH, WORK.

1283
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:39,822
YOU KNOW, NORMA BROUGHT IN

1284
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,891
HER WHOLE BROOD OF EIGHT KIDS.

1285
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,893
THEY WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE,

1286
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,294
THROWIN' FOOD...

1287
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:46,596
( echoing ) PEAS AND CARROTS

1288
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:47,997
AND POTATOES ON THE FLOOR

1289
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,298
AND ON THE WINDOWS.

1290
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,100
AND WHAT DOES SHE KNOW--

1291
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:52,935
 YOU WANT ANOTHER BEER?

1292
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:56,172
 OH. NO, I'M FINE.

1293
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,150
 WHOO-WHEE, SHE'S

1294
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,317
A GOOD ONE, JED.

1295
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:10,419
YOU OUGHT NOT TO LOSE HER.

1296
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,189
 YEAH.

1297
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:16,159
UNTIL SHE'S DIVORCED,

1298
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:18,327
AIN'T SAFE HER BEING WITH ME.

1299
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:21,130
SHERIFF SHOOTS HIS CHEATIN'

1300
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,032
WIFE DEAD, HELL, IN THIS

1301
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,333
COUNTY, HE'D GET AWAY EASY.

1302
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,935
 HE KNOWS THAT, THAT'S WHY

1303
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,336
HE DON'T SIGN THOSE PAPERS.

1304
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:30,039
 YEAH, WELL, IN A FEW MONTHS,

1305
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:32,108
PAPPY WILL BE READY TO RETIRE.

1306
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,342
 IT AIN'T GOT NOTHIN'

1307
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:34,944
TO DO WITH PAPPY.

1308
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,146
AND YOU AIN'T GOT MONTHS, JED.

1309
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,447
