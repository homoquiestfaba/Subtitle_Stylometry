1
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,035
Help, that man just stole my purse!

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,662
That man just stole my purse!

3
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,183
Oh, my purse!

4
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,477
Oh, why thank you!

5
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,267
Give me high fives, boys.

6
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,469
Hey, we have to start packing.

7
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,724
Let's just cancel.

8
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,978
We can't cancel.

9
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,600
It's the senate, honey.

10
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,977
And I'm the star withess.

11
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,024
Believe me, if it was
judge Judy I'd cancel,

12
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,989
but we're talking grand
jury here, I have to go.

13
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,485
I just hope that Charlie's
gonna be okay here with Maria.

14
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,703
He's stayed with Maria dozens of times.

15
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,831
Yeah, but he's worried.

16
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,451
He knows that something's wrong.

17
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,043
It'll be fine.

18
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,068
So what you're telling me is

19
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,174
despite the millions
that we're paying you,

20
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,792
we can't beat this new lawsuit?

21
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,294
The lawsuit has gone too far,

22
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,386
it's before the senate committee now.

23
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,481
We can't bribe or talk
our way out of this one.

24
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,243
The crusade against tobacco is nailing

25
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,515
every one of us to the wall.

26
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,806
And skinning us alive.

27
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,104
We've taken steps to
ensure that the prosecution's

28
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,973
star witness shall not testify.

29
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,021
Then we would have a chance.

30
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,859
But his identity is a secret.

31
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,605
I want this operation
run like clockwork.

32
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,948
All we need is the witness's cooperation.

33
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,319
No violence, no guns, no blood.

34
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,445
We have two men already in position.

35
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,449
That's him.

36
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,996
That's our Mark.

37
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,378
This is gonna be a piece of cake.

38
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,444
There's other witnesses that
work for the tobacco company,

39
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,468
why can't they testify?

40
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,751
I was an executive.

41
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,628
I'm the best witness the prosecution has.

42
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,972
It's the senate, it's now or never.

43
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,593
I would never put you in danger,
or Charlie, you know that.

44
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,430
Honey, they lied to everybody.

45
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,092
They knew cigarettes were addictive

46
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,859
and they hid the evidence.

47
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,480
I saw them shred documents
and conceal them.

48
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,362
I have a chance to fix my mistake.

49
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,115
Nothing's gonna happen.

50
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,488
We have to go.

51
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,251
Charlie.

52
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,288
We're going now.

53
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,546
Charlie, hey.

54
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,880
Sweetie, we're gonna go now.

55
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,134
Okay.

56
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,334
You be good now, listen to Maria.

57
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,596
Yeah, okay.

58
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,055
Hey, buddy, no, I mean
it now, you be good.

59
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,300
And you watch the dogs, okay?

60
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,561
All right, bye.

61
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,851
We love you.

62
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,940
Maria, we're going now!

63
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,110
Sorry guys, it's not walkie time.

64
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,768
They hate it when we go on trips.

65
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,989
Oh, I know, life is rough, isn't it?

66
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,613
Mr. Burton, Mr.
Burton, your briefcase!

67
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,875
Oh, thank you, Maria.

68
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,286
- Thanks Maria.
- You're welcome.

69
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,158
Take care, Maria.

70
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,910
Okay, thanks, have a nice trip, eh?

71
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:57,877
We'll see you on Monday.

72
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,541
Bye, good luck!

73
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:06,991
Excuse me.

74
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,861
Give me that.

75
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,578
Come on, get her in the closet.

76
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,290
Come on, quick, quick, quick.

77
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,017
Okay, we're gonna do the
same thing with the kid.

78
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,434
Grab him, tie him up, gag
him, and get him out of here.

79
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,212
I got his feet, come on,
I got his legs, come on.

80
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,603
Honey, what's wrong?

81
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,303
Somebody's following us.

82
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,270
No.

83
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,524
Yes

84
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,696
Harry, who are they?

85
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,958
I don't know.

86
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,333
They can't know who I am, it's impossible.

87
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,747
Don't open the door.

88
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,370
No, don't open it!

89
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,212
Let me do the talking, all right?

90
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,674
Everything's gonna be fine.

91
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,803
Mr. Burton, come with me please.

92
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,093
I will, if you leave my wife alone.

93
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,432
Of course, she can stay in the car.

94
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,766
We don't have much time, Mr. Burton,

95
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,452
so I need you to listen
to me very closely.

96
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,041
Please, Mr. Burton,
watch the video for me.

97
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,174
Charlie!

98
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,342
Charlie!

99
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,256
Mom and dad, what's
going on, what's happening?

100
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,034
Charlie, can you hear me?

101
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,265
Charlie!

102
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,643
Charlie?

103
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,804
Charlie?

104
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,136
What are you doing with my son?

105
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,014
At this point in time
he's perfectly safe.

106
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,937
We're merely transporting
him to a secure location.

107
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,520
He's a fine young man,
and quite intelligent

108
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,147
from what I've been told.

109
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,319
It would be a shame if he had an accident.

110
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,034
As long as you do exactly
as I tell you to do,

111
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,448
he'll be perfectly fine.

112
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,660
Do we have an understanding, Mr. Burton?

113
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,918
Yes sir.

114
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,162
You will not go to the
police, this is very important.

115
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,414
You will take your wife to Washington.

116
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,529
You will appear in front
of the senate committee

117
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,214
and give your testimony.

118
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,883
You will tell them the
tobacco company is clean,

119
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,723
and you've never seen any
evidence of any wrongdoing.

120
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,893
Very simple, that's all you have to do.

121
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,516
I have to lie.

122
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,106
Call it what you will,
but what it boils down to

123
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
is survival.

124
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,274
For us, and your son.

125
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,969
And I'm sure you wouldn't
want to do anything

126
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,824
to jeopardize your son, would you?

127
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,446
You better get to the airport.

128
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,745
You wouldn't want to miss that plane.

129
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,600
What did they want?

130
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,687
We have to go to Washington

131
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,474
and I have to lie to the senate.

132
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,565
Or what, what are they gonna do?

133
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,698
They have Charlie.

134
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,155
No.

135
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,410
No!

136
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,078
It's all right.

137
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,994
No, no, we can't call the police.

138
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,248
No, Shelly.

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,560
Listen, they have no reason to hurt him

140
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,538
if we do exactly what they say.

141
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,838
It's okay.

142
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,832
All right, now we have to go.

143
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,740
Come on, come on, let's go, let's go.

144
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,344
Watch his head, will ya?

145
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,259
Just watch his head.
I'm watching it!

146
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,533
So much for the perfect plan, huh?

147
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,057
Don't worry about it, just a couple

148
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,116
of harmless house pets.

149
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,374
Nice doggies.

150
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,976
Yeah, stop your barking, you rugrats.

151
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,332
Nice doggies.

152
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,462
Okay.

153
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,710
Nice doggies.

154
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,609
Just go past 'em,
they ain't gonna hurt you.

155
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,633
Come on.

156
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:42,883
You know I don't like dogs.

157
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,970
Get 'em off me!

158
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:46,804
Drop the kid.

159
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,673
Drop the kid!

160
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,564
You all right, you all right?

161
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:05,906
They're gone, they're gone.

162
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,692
Come on, let's get outta here.

163
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,160
Come on, come on, let's go.

164
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,073
Take a look back there,
is there anything missing?

165
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,684
It's just a nibble, shake it off.

166
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,288
Come on, get out of here.

167
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,542
You shake it off.

168
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,540
Ah, shut up, stop your whining.

169
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,512
Watch his head, will ya?

170
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,184
Let me go!

171
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:32,808
All right kid, be real quiet,
you don't cause any trouble,

172
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,347
everything will be all right.

173
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,677
All right, good, come on, let's go.

174
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,315
Give me the keys.

175
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,568
- Keys, yeah.
- Give me the keys, man!

176
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,694
- Uh-oh.
- What's uh-oh?

177
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,163
Uh-oh, the keys, the keys are gone.

178
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,728
What do you mean the keys are gone?

179
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,937
I had 'em hooked right here,

180
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,792
they must've fallen off inside in there.

181
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,082
Oh.

182
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:04,968
I ook!

183
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,346
The dogs, they got my keys!

184
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,803
We gotta go back inside and get 'em.

185
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,062
Let's go.

186
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,607
Darn, it's locked!

187
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,198
Well what about the skeleton key, man?

188
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,888
The skeleton key is on the key chain

189
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,389
with the truck key in the dog's mouth.

190
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,308
Well why'd you lock the door
in the first place, slick?

191
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,851
I didn't lock it, it
must've locked by itself

192
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,035
when we came out here.

193
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,293
Oh, man!

194
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,270
We can handle this.

195
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,230
Just listen to me.

196
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,815
We're trained for this.

197
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,309
We do this for a living, right?

198
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,774
I gotta think, gotta think.

199
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,125
Come on, slick,
let's just bust a window, man.

200
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,715
I told you, we
can't damage the house.

201
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,381
You all right?

202
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:55,595
I don't have a good
feeling about this, Harry.

203
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:53,882
Come on, come on.

204
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,256
Let me help.

205
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,215
Look, if you just,

206
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,426
look, if you just force it a little bit.

207
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,920
Let go, let go!

208
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,677
Well, we're in.

209
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,353
I'm gonna kill you.

210
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:27,996
There they are.

211
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,250
Move slow.

212
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,577
I'm gonna stuff the little
one down the big one's throat.

213
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,838
Just get the keys.

214
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,960
See, you wanna talk in
soft, slow, gentle tones,

215
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,300
sorta motherly, then you grab the keys.

216
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,466
Nice doggie, nice doggie, nice doggies!

217
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:48,725
I got him, slick!

218
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,935
I got you, you little runt!

219
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,558
I got you, you bad little...

220
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,528
You dummy.

221
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,320
I'm sorry, your hair
looks like a dog, slick!

222
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,859
All right, you get the big one,

223
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,184
I'm gonna get the little one.

224
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,328
Why do I get the big one
and you get the little one?

225
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,830
Okay, I'll get the little
one, you get the big one.

226
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,088
Good.

227
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,558
That's it, that's it!

228
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,688
I'll kill 'em-_

229
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,137
Look, the dogs, the little
one, he's got the keys!

230
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,232
Well, well, dead meat, hairball.

231
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,774
Hey, party's over.

232
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,115
Oh!

233
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,372
Oh!

234
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,248
Carny, carny, help me
out of this, will ya?

235
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,047
Come on, it's stuck!

236
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,711
No no...

237
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,970
Oh, ooh!

238
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,519
Come on, carny, can't you
come up with some idea

239
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,599
how to catch these dogs?

240
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,300
I can't think right now,
I'm too hungry to think.

241
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,603
That's it, the pepperoni
pizza, that's it!

242
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,217
Great idea, let's go get a bite.

243
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,233
No no no, not for us,
for the dogs, for the dogs.

244
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,351
We use the pizza to lure the dogs to us,

245
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,774
and then we'll catch 'em, yeah!

246
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,488
You're a genius!

247
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,322
I'm a genius?

248
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,862
You're a genius.

249
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,530
I'm a genius.

250
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,467
My pizza.

251
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,801
You know what, kid?

252
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,138
You got the luckiest dogs in the world.

253
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:18,310
Now you stay still and I
promise ya, I won't kill her!

254
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,204
Dogs.

255
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,532
What's that?

256
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,271
I'm knitting you a sweater,
what does it look like?

257
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,295
It's a tablecloth.

258
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,463
Oh.

259
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,307
All right, look, the
dogs went back upstairs.

260
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:46,755
So this is what we're gonna do.

261
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,570
You're gonna go up there
with that piece of bait

262
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,154
and lure the little runt one out, okay?

263
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:50,884
Yeah.

264
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:51,718
Now when he comes out and
he smells that pepperoni

265
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,158
and he goes to bite that pizza,

266
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,462
you grab him and choke him, huh?

267
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,096
But if he gets by ya, I'm gonna
nab him with this, you see?

268
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,059
It's just a matter of showing him

269
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,519
who's got a bigger cerebellum,

270
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,792
and we gotta prove who's higher
on the ladder of evolution,

271
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,816
you got it?!

272
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,436
I et's do it.

273
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,483
Eaty, beefy, chewy, kitty flavored!

274
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,373
Ah

275
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,209
Come on.

276
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:22,961
Huh?

277
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,168
Come on.

278
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,422
Come on.

279
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,010
Come on.

280
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:35,932
Mmm.

281
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,272
Huh?

282
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,015
Oh!

283
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,943
Why'd you get in the way, slick?

284
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,958
I had him, man!

285
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,388
What just fell?

286
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,646
Me!

287
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,833
No, not that sound.

288
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,848
That sound, what is that?

289
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,766
Sir, I'm calling form
the airport, we lost 'em,

290
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,187
I don't know where they went.

291
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,565
Did they get on the plane?

292
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,237
No sir, I'm certain they
didn't board the plane.

293
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,071
What do you want us to do?

294
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,485
What if they call the police?

295
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,130
We stay calm, they
won't go to the police,

296
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,152
they're not stupid, we have their son.

297
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,610
If Burton didn't get on the plane

298
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,749
then he won't make the
hearing and he won't testify.

299
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,743
We're still in control of the situation.

300
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,005
Yes sir.

301
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:42,472
Wow!

302
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,967
That bowling ball totally reminded me

303
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,789
of when I used to work in the carnival.

304
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,138
They used to shoot me out
of a Cannon feet first.

305
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,639
Boom!

306
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,734
No helmet, no net, crowd loved it.

307
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,280
Ah, you ever get a memory come
back to you like that, slick?

308
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,614
Slick?

309
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,233
Slick?

310
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,826
Come on, buddy.

311
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,557
Couple more shots to the head like that

312
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,196
and you'll even out just like me.

313
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,325
Trust me.

314
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,916
There he is!

315
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,344
Hurry up, go!

316
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,601
Slick!

317
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,606
Get outta there.

318
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,659
Get out.

319
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,582
I been calling you.

320
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,744
You've been taking a bath?

321
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,129
No, I been doing a water ballet.

322
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,175
Tell me you brought a gun.

323
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,139
No, they said no guns.

324
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,600
Big one goes in the oven.

325
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,643
Little one in the microwave.

326
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,780
Let's go.

327
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,991
Look, the keys!

328
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,294
He took the keys!

329
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,431
No, I think the little dog exploded.

330
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,850
Go to the sink and clean up.

331
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,713
Can you take us to Malibu?

332
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,135
We have to get home now.

333
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,688
When I was 10 years old, my
dad got me a dog, it bit me.

334
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,483
When I was 25 years old
and I quit high school,

335
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,448
my mom gave me a dog, it bit me.

336
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:32,320
When I was 30 years old I
met my first girlfriend.

337
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,414
Don't tell me, she was
a dog and she bit you.

338
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,453
Have I told this story before?

339
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,541
Come on, let's go!

340
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,597
Slick, you lost your head, man!

341
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,818
What?

342
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,986
Oh!

343
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,101
Your head went through the wall.

344
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,394
Harder?

345
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,936
No, that's not working, man.

346
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,061
I can't understand a word you're saying.

347
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:50,238
What?

348
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,732
For a second there I thought
the moose was talking to me.

349
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,651
Slick, are you in there?

350
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,915
Oh.

351
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,838
Slick, how did you get inside of a moose?

352
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,252
Get me outta here!

353
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,548
Come on, come on, come on!

354
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:13,806
Ow, ow, ow!

355
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,857
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

356
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,855
You're stuck, dude.

357
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,982
Tell me something I don't know.

358
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,084
I don't think I know
anything you don't know.

359
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,099
Go to the truck and see
if you can find something

360
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,363
to get me outta here, will ya?

361
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,364
That's a good idea.

362
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,002
Why'd I even bring him?

363
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,334
Harry, do you think
we did the right thing?

364
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,302
He's gonna be fine, okay?

365
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,636
What if they find out that
we're not on that plane?

366
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,465
What if they hurt Charlie?

367
00:32:58,727 --> 00:32:59,967
Hey, just trust me.

368
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,640
Can you go faster, please?

369
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,934
I'm already speeding, mister.

370
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,192
What, you want me to fly?

371
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,443
What am I, a Mallard?

372
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,903
Listen, I said can't you go faster?

373
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,321
Oh, you want me to go faster.

374
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,034
Woo!

375
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,862
You know what?

376
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,790
The keys!

377
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,386
The keys.

378
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,648
The keys.

379
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,073
Slick is gonna be so happy.

380
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:43,570
Slick, I need to get slick.

381
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,456
What are you looking at?

382
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,504
I'm not scared of you.

383
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:04,762
Peeing on me!

384
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,105
Cut him out.

385
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,108
Dig him out!

386
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,617
Oh no, oh no, oh, there's a spider.

387
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,283
Go away, go away!

388
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,036
Ooh, I hate spiders!

389
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,517
Mommy, mommy!

390
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,654
Hey slick.

391
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,740
I got the keys, man.

392
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,911
Speechless, huh?

393
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,826
I was pretty excited to.

394
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,129
Whoa, you know you have a
huge spider on your head?

395
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,711
The size of those fangs!

396
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,797
Did that spider pee on you?

397
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:29,677
Get this spider off
of me and get me outta here!

398
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,437
Hurry up.

399
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,692
Hold still.

400
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,267
What are you doing?

401
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,171
Get the kid.

402
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,550
Hey!

403
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,173
I'm gonna kill him!

404
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,446
Forget it, for get it, forget it.

405
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,470
Come on, let's just get
outta here, forget the dog.

406
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:06,804
Yeah.

407
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:07,717
All right, come on.

408
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:08,510
Let's go, let's get outta here.

409
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,768
And lock the doors.

410
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:10,811
Come on.

411
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,589
Hey kid, you
wanna listen to some music?

412
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,293
I wasn't sure what you
wanted, so I brought

413
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,490
Hungarian waltzes and show tunes.

414
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,325
Just put the keys in the ignition,

415
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,240
just drive, will ya?

416
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,953
Show tunes.

417
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,226
Don't even listen to him, kid.

418
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,706
You just stay under the blanket.

419
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,201
Yeah, and keep your mouth shut.

420
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,043
Keep his mouth shut,

421
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:37,877
how's he gonna open his mouth?

422
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,692
He has tape on his mouth,
what's wrong with you?

423
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:40,296
Oh, yeah, right.

424
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,819
Yeah, should've
put tape on your mouth

425
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:42,903
so I didn't listen to you all day.

426
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,632
Just drive, will ya?

427
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,072
Try putting your foot on the right pedal.

428
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,882
Oh I'm driving defensively, man,

429
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,100
'cause it's very safe, and
I don't have a license.

430
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,828
Defense, I'm
gonna give you a defense,

431
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:55,767
a fist right in your nose.

432
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,219
Oh god.

433
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,891
Charlie? - Charlie?!

434
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:38,854
Oh, Charlie?

435
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,188
Charlie!

436
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,853
Charlie?!

437
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,193
Charlie?

438
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,941
Oh god! - Charlie!

439
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,738
Charlie?

440
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,528
Charlie?

441
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,117
Maria.

442
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,539
Are you all right?

443
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:05,801
Mhmm, mhmm.

444
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,465
What happened?

445
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,719
Where's Charlie?

446
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,510
Where's Charlie?

447
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,755
Charlie, I don't know,
there were some men,

448
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,347
they came in, they tied me up,

449
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,182
and then they threw me in there.

450
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,596
Charlie.

451
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,688
Do you hear something?

452
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:21,977
Sounds funny.

453
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,939
Funny, what do you mean funny?

454
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,653
The truck sounds funny.

455
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,482
Sounds like a truck to me.

456
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,539
I hear something.

457
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,164
What?

458
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,423
What, what?

459
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,539
I told you, I told you.

460
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,416
What'd you do, flood it?

461
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,318
My foot wasn't even on the gas!

462
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:51,657
Restart it, will ya?

463
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,261
It's not my fault!

464
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,355
Stop your crying
and just restart it.

465
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:09,983
What did you do?

466
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,114
What's wrong with you?

467
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,968
Put your foot on, what are ya,.

468
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,791
What are you doing?

469
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,749
It keeps cutting out!

470
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,119
Carny, did you put gas in the truck?

471
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,291
I filled it up, slick!

472
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,380
Get out, let me drive.

473
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,321
I can handle it, it's
the truck that's got

474
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:30,925
the problem, man.

475
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,619
No you got the problem, all right?

476
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,055
Listen go out there and check
under the hood, will ya?

477
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,174
Go ahead, I got the hood release.

478
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,932
Sorry about the bumpy ride, kid.

479
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,066
Hurry up!

480
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,726
Oh great, it looks like an
alien star ship or something.

481
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:49,988
Come on!

482
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:51,695
What?

483
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,065
What's wrong?

484
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,692
I don't know, it looks okay to me.

485
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,444
Did you check the carburetor?

486
00:40:58,915 --> 00:40:59,915
Which one?

487
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,124
(Set.

488
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,600
Too many tubes, too many
pipes, too many wires,

489
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:21,433
what is this?

490
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:22,973
I can't figure it out.

491
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:23,811
Slick?

492
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,065
What?

493
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:25,930
You wanna take a look at this.

494
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,003
No no, quiet, quiet,
I'm trying to concentrate,

495
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,254
'cause I can't figure these engines out,

496
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,478
they're just too complicated,
it's just too much for me,

497
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,633
I don't know what's going on.

498
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:33,988
What do you want from...

499
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,983
Afternoon, officer.

500
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,725
Having a problem with your vehicle?

501
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:39,572
- No.
- Yeah

502
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:40,911
a small one.

503
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,326
Not a big one, nothing
we can't take care of.

504
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:45,999
Can you fix it?

505
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,087
Yeah, oh yeah, we can fix
it, no problem, we got it.

506
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:49,920
You sure”?

507
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,337
Oh yeah, yeah, we're okay,
we're fine, you can go, thanks.

508
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,594
What happened to you?

509
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,047
- What do you mean?
- What?

510
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,136
Oh, well look at you, you're a mess.

511
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,800
Oh, hey, we're plumbers, see?

512
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,061
Smart plumbers.

513
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,352
We just had an emergency
job, you should've seen it,

514
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:05,932
what a mess.

515
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,190
The washing machine blew
up, detergent all over us,

516
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,597
I had to rewire the whole house.

517
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,732
I see.

518
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,608
This vehicle registered, insured?

519
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:15,571
I don't know.

520
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:16,484
This one?

521
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,324
Oh yeah, we have the papers for this.

522
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:19,158
Oh, this one.

523
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:19,992
Yeah, yeah.

524
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,282
Oh god. - We got everything.

525
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,120
- Yeah.
- Everything's fine.

526
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,831

00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,165

No no no, we're fine, we'll

00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,862
Appreciate your help, though.

530
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,585
All right, well.

Good luck.

Okay, drive safe, officer.

You all right?

545
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,950
Yeah, strange dogs.

546
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,935
I know they're strange,
we saw them earlier today,

547
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,165
they were trying to attack us.

548
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,438
Yeah, well I'll call animal control

549
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,231
and have somebody come
out and pick 'em up later.

550
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,836
That's a good idea, do that.

551
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,611
Man, you know though,
seemed like they were

552
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,171
trying to tell me something.

553
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,947
Thanks again for your help, gentlemen.

554
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:19,551
All right, all right.

555
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:20,806
- Take care.
- All right.

556
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Come on.

557
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,105
Try it again.

558
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,241
No good.

559
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,482
My luck, my luck.

560
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,402
Let's call a cab.

561
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:42,241
Oh, yeah yeah yeah,

562
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,200
and what do we tell the cab driver

563
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,973
about the kid that's all
tied and gagged, huh?

564
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,658
You got any better ideas?

565
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:50,616
Oh no.

566
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,272
Oh, no, the cop's walking
up behind the truck.

567
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,191
He ran the plates, I told
you he was gonna do it,

568
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,581
I knew it, he's looking
right at the license plate.

569
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,656
What's he doing,
does he have his gun out yet?

570
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,636
Okay look, look, just don't act scared,

571
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,881
just look normal, all right?

572
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,092
All right, that's it.

573
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:07,887
I'm playing this out till the last card.

574
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,261
I'm not gonna be scared.

575
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,855
Just be cool, be cool, be
cool, roll down the window,

576
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,189
roll it down.

577
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,315
Yes, officer?

578
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,484
I found the source of your problem.

579
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,356
Somebody stuck this in your tailpipe

580
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,279
and backed up your exhaust system.

581
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,038
Those darn kids!

582
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,496
Oh, those kids, huh?

583
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,784
Try your engine now.

584
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,815
Thanks officer,
you've been a great help.

585
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,439
Yeah, I'm glad I could help.

586
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,379
You guys have a good day.

587
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,748
Okay, thank you.

588
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,306
You ever see a dog again.

589
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:52,564
Yeah?

590
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,648
Run it over.

591
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,143
Yeah.

592
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,608
When are we getting paid for this again?

593
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,604
At the end of the job, as usual.

594
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,730
I hope it's soon, I'm broke.

595
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:03,992
How much is my cut again?

596
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,032
Well, you know, I've
been thinking about that.

597
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,243
I was gonna split the
money down the middle.

598
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,987
But since you've gone through so much

599
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,560
and I've been yelling at you blaming you

600
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,784
even though it was those dogs,

601
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:14,839
what I'm gonna do this
time is I'm gonna give you

602
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,998
three packs of 5000
and I'm only gonna keep

603
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,336
two packs of 10,000.

604
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,547
Aww, you don't
have to do that, slick,

605
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,008
ah, don't worry about it.

606
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,844
Oh, man, I think the kid peed himself.

607
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,759
It's dog pee.

608
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,224
The dog peed on the kid?

609
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:31,684
No, the dog peed on me.

610
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,644
I thought the spider peed on you.

611
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,854
What a mess, look at me, look at me.

612
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,818
When we get to the
hideout, I gotta clean up.

613
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,950
Look where you're going,
look where you're driving!

614
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,029
You told me to look at you.

615
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,152
Not you look at me.

616
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,904
Me look at me.

617
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,088
The matter with you?

618
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,342
Nothing, nothing.

619
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,793
Those dogs, they got to me,
they're kinda messing me up,

620
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,949
they're messing me up
physiologically or something.

621
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,093
I'm starting to hallucinate.

622
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,093
Hallucinating, what's that?

623
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,703
Well you know, that's
when you see things

624
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,727
that aren't there.

625
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,557
That's a bad tick, slick.

626
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,921
It's not a tick, it's not a tick,

627
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,385
I keep thinking I'm seeing the dogs,

628
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,147
and every time I look up there,

629
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,766
it's like I see 'em, and they're
not there and I look and...

630
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,239
I ook!

631
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,528
They are there!

632
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,026
The dogs, they're here!

633
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,074
Carny, the dogs are in the back!

634
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:33,912
You're losing it.

635
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,202
Carny, look, look in the back!

636
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,503
Stop the truck stop the truck!

637
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,419
Stop the truck!

638
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,539
I'm gonna get 'em this time!

639
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:56,268
Forget about it, forget about it.

640
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,791
You get in the back of the truck,

641
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:58,875
they try to jump in,
throw something at 'em.

642
00:46:58,899 --> 00:46:59,479
I'm gonna drive, come on.

643
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:00,961
We're close to the ranch,
we can get him there

644
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:01,985
before they catch us.

645
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,572
I hope a mountain lion eats ya!

646
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,836
Okay, open the door.

647
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,300
Come on.

648
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,242
Let me go!

649
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:07,084
- You got him?
- Yeah.

650
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,978
All right, come on, put him over there.

651
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:10,496
I love sleeping in barns.

652
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:11,338
We're not sleeping in the barn,

653
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,331
we're staying in the cabin.

654
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,862
He's staying in the
barn, now put him down.

655
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:14,466
Really?

656
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,300
All right, sit him up, sit him up.

657
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,615
We gotta tighten these ropes.

658
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,799
Look, look at this mess here.

659
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,326
Why do you keep giving me orders, man?

660
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,760
Oh okay, you wanna give orders?

661
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,384
All right, tell me, what
do you want me to do?

662
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:25,598
What do you want me to do?

663
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:27,187
Um.

664
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,561
Um, that's what I thought.

665
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,609
Fix the knots.

666
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,637
And here, help me with the blanket.

667
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:36,689
Okay, good.

668
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:37,656
All right, let's get outta here.

669
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,525
All right.

670
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,534
Wow, look at this place,
it's real expensive.

671
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,377
Yeah, the people we're working for,

672
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:53,122
they got some serious bucks,
must be some big corporation.

673
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,320
Oh, it must be, you
don't know who they are?

674
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,988
No no, we're five times removed from me,

675
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,343
I'm not allowed to know.

676
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,204
I have some concerns
about the men we've hired

677
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,684
to do this job.

678
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,374
We don't seem to know anything about them.

679
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,292
Don't worry, sir, I can assure
you they're professionals.

680
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,396
Do you know who they are?

681
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,183
Well, not directly.

682
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,025
Well then who does, who hired them?

683
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
Francois.

684
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,069
Who?

685
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,968
Francois, he's one of
our people in Quebec.

686
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:18,572
Canada?

687
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,817
He's worked with them
before, he knows them?

688
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,194
Well, actually, he didn't say.

689
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,696
Does anybody know
anything about these guys?

690
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,251
Look, francois, this
is extremely important.

691
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,119
I need you to tell me everything you can

692
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:34,918
about those two guys you
hired to do the job for us.

693
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,415
- I don't know them.
- What?

694
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,697
You asked me to find
somebody completely anonymous,

695
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:39,380
and I did it.

696
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,758
Well who hired them, then?

697
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:41,511
- Evan.
- Who?

698
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,345
Fvan.

699
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,952
Well what did he tell you about them?

700
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:44,976
Nothing.

701
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,513
I'm kinda hungry.

702
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,682
Where's that phone, I'm starving.

703
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,940
Oh, here it is.

704
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,586
You order that pizza,
make sure you don't get

705
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,226
any anchovies, and no
peppers, and no pepperoni

706
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,287
and no sausage, no black
olives, no mushrooms,

707
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,821
and definitely no pineapple,
no fruit on my pizza.

708
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,407
Why don't you just eat cardboard, slick?

709
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,777
Why don't you just order the pie, okay?

710
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,202
Aww, do we have to
spring for the kid too?

711
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,937
You should've checked
his pockets for loose cash.

712
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,701
I et me see what I have here.

713
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,126
You know what, I got enough
loose change in my pocket.

714
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,736
Just get him a small
pie with nothing on it,

715
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,876
I'm gonna go clean up.

716
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,002
Four-one-one.

717
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,435
Here you go, slick.

718
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,693
What's this?

719
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,601
What is all this stuff on my pizza?

720
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,277
The dog!

721
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,646
Look at it, carny!

722
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,193
He's got my wallet!

723
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,065
Get him!

724
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:50,739
He gets outta here, the cops
find the wallet, we're fried!

725
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,156
I think I'm in a nightmare!

726
00:54:58,462 --> 00:54:59,042
Wait, wait, wait.

727
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,127
You take the back
staircase, I'll go this way.

728
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,701
And watch out for that big dog,
he's around here somewhere,

729
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,423
he'll sneak up on us.

730
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,292
Come here you, give me my wallet!

731
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,888
Trapped.

732
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:12,847
Come here, you!

733
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:13,760
Get over here!

734
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:14,678
Where you going?

735
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:17,178
Come here, you porcupine
face, get it, get it!

736
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,059
Oh!

737
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,106
I can't believe he just did that.

738
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,855
He must be part squirrel or something.

739
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,087
All right, carny.

740
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,743
Reach out there and
get my wallet, will ya?

741
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,052
Oh no, I'm scared of heights.

742
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,266
Oh come on, it's not that far.

743
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,012
All right, hold me and I'll
reach out there and get it.

744
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:00,854
Well what if, you know...

745
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:01,722
What if I fall and die?

746
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,440
I'll kill ya, that's what.

747
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:10,155
I don't like this, slick.

748
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:10,989
Just come on, let's go.

749
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,653
I got a bad feeling.

750
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:13,911
Whoa!

751
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,569
Easy, easy, easy.

752
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:16,536
All right.

753
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,326
I don't know, slick.

754
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,865
I can't reach it, you gotta
get me out further, come on.

755
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,250
Okay.

756
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,504
Okay.

757
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,628
Now I can get him.

758
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,623
Come to daddy.

759
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,595
Slick?

760
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,019
I'm sorry.

761
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,223
You wanna just rest there for a while?

762
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,850
Uh huh.

763
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,795
Are you breathing?

764
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:24,815
Ah!

765
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,229
Good boy, Samson.

766
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,647
Good boy.

767
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,093
911 emergency.

768
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,152
Hello, 9117?

769
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,775
My name is Charlie.

770
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,243
Some guys kidnapped me.

771
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:48,086
No, I don't know where it
is, but it's in a barn.

772
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,079
They'll come back any second.

773
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,081
You've gotta help me, please help me.

774
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:52,654
Calm down, Charlie, calm down.

775
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,589
Just try to stay calm, okay?

776
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,087
Just stay on the line and
we can trace your location.

777
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,851
Give me my wallet!

778
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,894
Come here!

779
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,855
Get him, carny, get him, come on!

780
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,357
Get him, carny!

781
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,606
Come on, get him, get him, get him.

782
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,202
I got him.

783
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,039
I got him.

784
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,437
Give me that wallet, fuzzball.

785
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,041
You're dead, you know that? You're dead!

786
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:27,875
How should I do it, huh?

787
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:28,710
One down, huh slick? One down.

788
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:30,604
Wait wait wait, something's wrong here.

789
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,712
He's not trying to bite us!

790
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:32,463
No.

791
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:33,298
Yeah, you know what that means?

792
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:34,086
- What?
- He's a decoy.

793
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,130
No, he's a Norfolk terrier mix.

794
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,504
No no no, he's a decoy,
he's trying to distract us

795
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,085
from something that the big
dog's probably doing right now!

796
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,309
What?

797
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:43,850
The kid!

798
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,560
Try to stay calm, okay?

799
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:46,934
We're gonna trace your call.

800
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:48,149
I'm

801
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:49,772
I'm scared.

802
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,813
Charlie, Charlie, are you okay?

803
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,510
Charlie?
Hey, what's going on here?

804
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:54,903
What are you doing?!

805
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,157
Hey!

806
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:57,950
Give me that phone!

807
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:58,690
What are you crazy?

808
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,692
This was a dumb thing to do, kid.

809
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,394
It's time for a lesson in respect.

810
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,112
Say bye bye to your little friend.

811
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,251
Ow!

812
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,375
Good boy, Hercules.

813
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,227
Slick, the kid's gone!

814
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,115
Wait for me!

815
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,797
Hurry up, get him, carny!

816
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:30,912
Samson!

817
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:37,967
Come here!

818
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,877
On the ground, on the ground!

819
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,795
On the ground, huh?!

820
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:50,620
Hey!

821
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:51,488
Carny, carny.

822
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,865
Shh, shh, shh.

823
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,412
Quiet, you having those
nightmares about the dogs again?

824
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,670
Okay, shh.

825
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,995
This time they were the guards.

826
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,257
Doggies in uniform.

827
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,794
Oh man, what am I gonna do?

828
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,158
They're after me every night.

829
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,922
I can't sleep, slick.

830
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:09,923
I can't sleep!

831
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,345
Hey, shut up, carny!

832
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:14,436
Carny, this is the last time, you hear?

833
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,600
Yeah, ya freak.

834
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,348
This is unbelievable!

835
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,004
One night of sleep,
that's all I ask for carny,

836
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:21,268
is just one night.

837
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,089
I usually count sheep to go to sleep,

838
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:24,779
problem is they always turn into dogs.

839
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:27,053
Yeah, you oughta stop with
those stupid doggie nightmares,

840
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,429
you know, you think those dogs are up,

841
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,639
wait till these animals get ahold of you.

842
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,983
I don't think you're gonna
have to wait very long, slick,

843
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,207
look. - Oh no.

844
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,936
You remember when you said
you were gonna watch my back?

845
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,540
Yeah.

846
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,396
I think you're gonna
have to watch my front too.

847
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,190
Okay, okay, okay, just
keep your crazy mouth shut

848
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:39,794
and I'll handle it.

849
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:40,787
Hey, guys, how are ya?

850
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:41,629
How's it going?

851
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:42,883
Hey slick.

852
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,279
Why don't you bring your little dog leash

853
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,715
when you take carny for a
little walk in the park, okay?

854
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:48,507
Okay, okay.

855
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,881
Hey carny, say goodbye
to life as you know it.

856
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,037
Yeah, we had our last night
of no sleep because of you.

857
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:55,061
Okay, okay guys, listen,
I completely understand,

858
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,873
I'm not getting any sleep either, so...

859
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,605
Hey, step aside, Napoleon,
we just want dog boy.

860
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,902
Run, carny, run!

861
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,450
He's the one with the problems, I'm not!

862
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,696
I'm not nuts, he's nuts!

863
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,744
I'm not nuts!

864
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,437
I didn't know you could
get the electric chair

865
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,076
for having nightmares!

866
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,874
I want a phone call!

867
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,252
Who you gonna call, carny?

868
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,797
I'm the only person you know.

869
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,838
Electric shock therapy
is only precautionary.

870
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,456
Please remain calm and there'll be

871
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:31,421
no reason for us to use it.

872
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,219
What's with the mini king Kong, doc?

873
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,058
Kato is here as my
assistant in your therapy.

874
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,083
Are you feeling fear of the beast, carny?

875
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,598
No no no, he's carny, I'm slick.

876
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,500
It's obvious that you're suffering from

877
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,356
acute hostility syndrome.

878
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,359
He thinks you're cute?

879
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:49,731
Carny, carny!

880
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:53,448
You see, slick, carny,

881
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,492
the solution to your fear of animals...

882
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,750
Dogs.

883
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,699
Wonderful, wonderful, excellent.

884
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,247
Let us be a little bit more specific.

885
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:06,669
The solution to your fear
of dogs is quite simple.

886
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:07,506
Simple?

887
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:08,761
I can handle that.

888
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,507
What we have here is a need for closure.

889
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:12,470
Closure?

890
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:13,724
Yes, closure.

891
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,013
Close your what?

892
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,388
Close your mouth, will ya?

893
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,594
Gentlemen, please, listen to me.

894
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,097
Both of you need to confront
the dogs on equal terms.

895
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,066
This will allow you to have
the closure that you need.

896
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,858
Confrontation equals closure.

897
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,475
How are we gonna confront the
dogs if we're stuck in here?

898
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,099
Maybe we could get a weekend pass.

899
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,597
Hey, there's a good idea, huh?

900
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:35,621
Can we go now?

901
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,822
Obviously that's going to be impossible.

902
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:43,123
However, we may obtain
closure through hypnosis.

903
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,460
Hypnosis?

904
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:49,378
Watch the ball, watch the ball.

905
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,843
What sort of weak-brained no-mind

906
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,803
would possibly fall for this?

907
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,388
Can you believe this, carny?

908
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,178
There's just no way.

909
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,435
Carny?

910
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:00,552
Carny?

911
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,814
Yo carny?

912
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,648
All right, well, scratch one
weak-brained no-mind, doc.

913
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,688
But as far as I go, there is no way

914
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:09,607
I could possibly fall for the...

915
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:15,158
Now carny, the dogs
in your hallucinations,

916
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:18,575
your nightmares, have
you ever met them before?

917
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:19,832
Yeah.

918
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,156
Tell me about it.

919
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:24,034
We were gonna kidnap this kid.

920
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,035
We weren't gonna hurt him,

921
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,504
but then everything got screwed up...

922
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,069
Hey, wait right there.

923
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,093
These two dogs.

924
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,172
Slick said it would be easy.

925
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,591
We could play tie up the kid,

926
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:38,173
and get paid lots of money.

927
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,042
Mom?

928
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,459
I can't hear you, I can't hear you.

929
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:11,001
Hold on a second.

930
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:12,795
Hey.

931
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,542
Could you keep it down, please?

932
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,309
And the TV.

933
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:23,931
Go by the pool.

934
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,929
Charlie and Harry and
aunt Karen are there.

935
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:27,681
Go on, good boys.

936
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:29,985
Sorry mom.

937
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:34,566
As I was saying, Harry's gone
to Washington, to testify.

938
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,247
Captain Hercules, hard to port!

939
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,290
Affirmative!

940
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,629
Mission accomplished, captain!

941
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:55,988
Charlie, if you don't get
out of that pool right now,

942
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,843
you're gonna turn into a prune.

943
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,712
Just five more minutes, dad.

944
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,076
Don't you think you
should be getting ready

945
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,011
for your trip tomorrow with aunt Karen?

946
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:05,017
That's a negative!

947
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,636
I packed already!

948
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:07,603
You did?

949
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,017
You're kidding.

950
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,731
No really, I did.

951
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,145
Oh, I'm impressed.

952
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,984
Oh, not now, Samson.

953
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:17,147
We're gonna have a great
time on our trip, Charlie.

954
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,113
Awesome!

955
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,983
Come on, Samson.

956
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,435
You know Harry, I may be biased,

957
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,120
but I think I have the most wonderfully

958
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:29,578
energetic nephew in the world.

959
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,870
Oh, thanks sis, yeah,
I'm thinking of sending him

960
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:35,123
to naval academy very far, far away.

961
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:36,625
Very funny.

962
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,820
What are you doing, what are you doing?

963
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,138
You trying to wash the whole world?

964
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,122
You're using too much
detergent there, be careful!

965
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,571
This stuff stinks, slick!

966
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,448
It's not the clothes, it's you!

967
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,747
Did you separate those clothes

968
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,319
that gotta go in the dry cleaning chute?

969
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:17,923
Yeah.

970
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,337
Yeah, you better have.

971
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,221
What, what's the matter?

972
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,079
What'd you stick your
hand in there for, slick?!

973
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,372
I didn't put my hand in there,

974
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:29,932
you closed the door on my hand.

975
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,189
Open it!

976
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,436
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.

977
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:35,694
Ow!

978
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,147
Will you be careful?

979
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:39,145
I think that shock therapy just ruined

980
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:41,443
whatever brain cells you had left.

981
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,032
What?

982
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,823
Nevermind, just start
the machine, will ya?

983
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:57,501
Oh look, slick, the guys
came to help fold the laundry.

984
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:58,339
Hi guys.

985
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,129
Aww, isn't that nice?

986
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,502
I bet their mommies will be real proud.

987
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:03,991
Yo, don't talk about my mama.

988
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:04,595
Sorry.

989
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,049
Shut your pipes, eagle beak.

990
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,183
Hey, how'd you like the shock treatment?

991
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,302
Did you get to see the monkey?

992
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:14,037
Fellas, I don't think that this is going

993
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,773
in a very positive direction.

994
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,233
Oh guard! - Guard, oh guard!

995
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:18,067
A little help!

996
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:19,321
- Look, look!
- What?

997
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,610
- Don't see no guards.
- No.

998
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:22,522
- Do you see any guards?
- No.

999
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:23,364
Yeah!

1000
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:25,178
What are you gonna do now, huh dog boy?

1001
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,117
Yeah, dog boy!

1002
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,737
That's a very good question.

1003
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,239
Slick, what are we gonna do now?

1004
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,332
What are we gonna do?

1005
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:35,754
The usual.

1006
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,880
Run!

1007
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:51,676
Put me down!

1008
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:56,858
Carny!

1009
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,024
Carny! - Yeah?

1010
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,742
- Slick!
- Carny.

1011
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,835
The laundry chute, let's go!

1012
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,090
Quick!

1013
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,832
Come on, come on.

1014
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:28,679
Slick, that looks awful far.

1015
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:08,552
Slick.

1016
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,546
Slick, the prison's moving.

1017
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:12,556
Slick!

1018
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,391
I think we're having an earthquake!

1019
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,261
(Murmuri rn - shh! 9

1020
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,763
we're not having an earthquake.

1021
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,647
We're in the back of a truck!

1022
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,171
No wonder I feel like heaving.

1023
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,589
How'd we get in the back of a truck?

1024
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,194
Because we're out, carny!

1025
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:26,779
- Out of what?
- Out of prison!

1026
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,427
When we jumped down that chute we must've

1027
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:29,811
landed in this bin and got shipped

1028
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,196
on the truck by accident!

1029
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,891
We better get back, we
don't finish all that laundry

1030
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:35,225
we're gonna get in serious trouble!

1031
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,285
Carny, forget about the laundry.

1032
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:38,543
We escaped, you get it?

1033
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,334
No more shock therapy, no more monkey,

1034
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:42,874
no more smelly inmates, we escaped!

1035
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,175
Hurry up!

1036
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,469
Aunt Karen, Samson, Hercules!

1037
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:54,434
Let's go!

1038
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:57,139
We're shipping out!

1039
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,722
Hey, dad ever show you the
zoo that they have at the Navy?

1040
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:14,326
What zoo?

1041
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,933
Where they keep the
tomcats and the prowlers

1042
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:16,957
and the hornets.

1043
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,246
Those are planes.

1044
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:19,501
Oh really?

1045
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:20,585
- Yeah.
- Hmm

1046
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,501
aunt Karen.

1047
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:23,755
I. Ook at those two.

1048
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,318
They're always filling
my car up with toys.

1049
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,081
Unbelievable, huh?

1050
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,503
Last time they tried to stuff

1051
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:29,833
their whole doghouse in the car.

1052
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,211
Hey, watch your head, kid.

1053
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:40,765
Okay, okay.

1054
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,668
Let's get out of these
prison rags, hurry up.

1055
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:44,012
I'm not gonna run around naked.

1056
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:45,628
Oh no no, we'll put on other clothes!

1057
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,481
Where are we gonna get other clothes?

1058
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:49,694
Take a look around, what do you see?

1059
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,439
- Clothes.
- Yeah.

1060
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,066
- Duh!
- Duh.

1061
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:54,988
- Slick, sometimes.
- Sometimes.

1062
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,371
Okay, let's grab something off the rack.

1063
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:00,205
Quick.

1064
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,245
Good, because this is really slimy.

1065
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,503
Oh, you know what?

1066
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:04,126
Don't worry about it.

1067
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:04,960
We don't have time.

1068
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:05,919
Just put something on over that,

1069
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:07,401
because when this truck
stops, we're outta here.

1070
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,131
- Okay.
- Here, put this on.

1071
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,055
You guys about ready to go?

1072
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:21,104
Almost.

1073
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,562
Oh, I see Samson and
Hercules over-packed as usual.

1074
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,807
Those dogs and their toys.

1075
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,480
Now, you be nice to
aunt Karen, all right?

1076
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,603
And don't take advantage of her.

1077
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,230
- But...
- No buts.

1078
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:35,028
And don't let her give you any money.

1079
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:40,246
And you, buster, you have
to be on your best behavior.

1080
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:41,455
All right?

1081
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:42,323
No sweat, dad.

1082
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:43,585
All right.

1083
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:46,118
Okay, everybody in?

1084
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:51,590
All right.

1085
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:52,959
Watch your feet.

1086
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:16,493
Car.

1087
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:19,579
Okay.

1088
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,119
Let's go, let's go.

1089
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:29,499
Down here, down here.

1090
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:30,496
It's a sewer.

1091
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:33,044
Shut up, come on, come on.

1092
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,088
We did it, we did it!

1093
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:41,638
I can't believe we're out.

1094
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,427
Fresh air! - Yeah.

1095
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,098
At least we got freedom.

1096
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,814
Wow, look at those ships!

1097
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:09,418
I'm so glad you work for
the Navy, aunt Karen.

1098
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,378
Yeah, I'm glad too.

1099
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,918
I've got a little surprise
cooked up for you, young man.

1100
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,176
Cool!

1101
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,085
Check that ship out,
Charlie, isn't it great?

1102
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,462
Yeah, it's awesome!

1103
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,424
Wow, thanks for taking me, aunt Karen.

1104
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,890
Now, I'm gonna take
you on your own personal tour.

1105
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:29,389
Can I see the
radar and the O2 deck?

1106
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:30,981
Okay, you must be Charlie!

1107
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,254
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi Charlie.

1108
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,838
Hey Karen, how are you?
Hey Don, good.

1109
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:34,610
This is ensign lamping.

1110
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,195
Charlie, nice to meet you.

1111
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:37,108
- Hi.
- Karen, how you doing?

1112
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,197
Welcome aboard the USS sides.

1113
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:43,320
Now Charlie, the sides is
an Oliver hazard Perry class

1114
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,071
guided missile frigate.

1115
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,539
Now she's capable of speeds up to 30 knots

1116
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,158
and can carry two helicopters.

1117
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,500
Wow, that's cool!

1118
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:51,369
You like helicopters?

1119
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,369
Yeah, I love 'em!

1120
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,838
Our primary mission
is to track submarines,

1121
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,424
but we're also capable
of surface-to-air combat.

1122
01:15:58,637 --> 01:15:59,672
This is our O2 level.

1123
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,012
This is where we keep
the radar and weaponry.

1124
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:04,161
All right, let's go take a
look at some helicopters.

1125
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:05,185
Okay.

1126
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:08,832
I think you'll like this, Charlie.

1127
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:10,256
I reserved this one for you to fly.

1128
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,719
Do you have your pilot's license?

1129
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:12,859
Soon, right?

1130
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,108
This is our armored cockpit.

1131
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:14,941
Cool!

1132
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:17,278
And this over here is
our forward-mounted Cannon.

1133
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:18,531
Wanna sit in the cockpit?

1134
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:19,699
Sure!

1135
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:21,156
Be careful, Charlie.

1136
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,024
Okay, ready?

1137
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,286
Here we go.

1138
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:31,920
Hey.

1139
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:38,215
Hey.

1140
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,043
Oh, come on.

1141
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:43,807
Whoa!

1142
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,644
Somebody please!

1143
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:01,939
Help!

1144
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,201
Somebody!

1145
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,331
Hey!

1146
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:14,710
My back!

1147
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:06,090
Man overboard.

1148
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:48,595
Here you go.

1149
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:49,868
Hey, thanks for the jacket, boy.

1150
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:50,892
- Got it?
- All righty.

1151
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:57,918
Bill, I'm gonna call down to sick bay

1152
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,432
and get a corpsman for you.

1153
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:02,901
No, no, I'm fine thanks to
you guys and these two dogs.

1154
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:06,323
You know, this
place is beautiful, carny.

1155
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,024
Hey slick, wait.

1156
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:09,285
This looks familiar.

1157
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,447
You're right, you're right.

1158
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,077
What dumb luck.

1159
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:13,558
We jump out of a truck, we end up about

1160
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,743
five miles from pat's on
the other side of the creek.

1161
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:16,581
Which way?

1162
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:17,415
- That way.
- That way?

1163
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:18,730
- Yeah, that way.
- I'm going this way.

1164
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:19,368
Wait, wait.

1165
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,710
Hey!

1166
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,567
Oh, sorry, you didn't need that anyway.

1167
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,236
Hey listen, we gotta get across the border

1168
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:24,840
into Mexico, right?

1169
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,988
Pat's the only person that
could possibly help us

1170
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,877
with some money and some wheels.

1171
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:29,753
So let's go.

1172
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,506
But you already owe pat a ton of money!

1173
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:33,348
Fh

1174
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,182
I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed,

1175
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,348
but I think asking pat for
more favors is a bad idea.

1176
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,686
You got any good ideas?

1177
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:40,301
- Uh...
- You got any ideas at all?

1178
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,557
- No.
- I didn't think so.

1179
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,059
Let's go, we're going to pat's.

1180
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:44,506
And don't worry about it, pat loves me.

1181
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,690
Pat hates your guts!

1182
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:47,028
Oh, don't worry about it.

1183
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:49,402
Pat is one of the most giving,
loving, gentlest people

1184
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:50,399
I ever met in my life.

1185
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:52,401
- Bad idea.
- No, it's a good idea.

1186
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,146
Why are the dogs out of the car?

1187
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,455
He's the early warning dog.

1188
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:08,738
Let's see what's wrong, come on Charlie.

1189
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,877
And this guy is such a swimmer.

1190
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:14,761
Oh, Hercules!

1191
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:16,019
These are your dogs?

1192
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:16,808
Yes!

1193
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:17,801
That rescued
a man from drowning.

1194
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,374
Let's see if we can get a statement...

1195
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:20,667
What are you
two doing out of the car?

1196
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:22,411
From these amazing little dogs.

1197
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:34,701
Maybe we should come back
when pat's in a better mood.

1198
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:36,161
That is a better mood.

1199
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:43,498
Hunk of junk!

1200
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:49,594
She went inside.

1201
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,072
I'll go look for some keys or something,

1202
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,490
maybe we can take that piece of junk

1203
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,596
before she comes back out, look around.

1204
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,307
This is Stan
maisley, channel 32 news,

1205
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,768
and I'm back live with two amazing dogs,

1206
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:01,387
Samson and Hercules.

1207
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,934
If you're just tuning in,
these two little heroes

1208
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:05,979
have just won the heart of America.

1209
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:06,816
Slick.

1210
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:07,651
Slick!

1211
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:08,485
Come here.

1212
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:09,841
Yes, we're
live at the naval base

1213
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,176
where we have just withessed
an incredible act of courage

1214
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,510
by Charlie Burton...
You're watching TV?

1215
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,054
Are you seeing what I'm
seeing or am I hallucinating?

1216
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,443
Risk their own lives

1217
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,195
to save an elderly gentleman
from drowning in the ocean.

1218
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,097
Although he seems perfectly fine after...

1219
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,706
The dogs!

1220
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,951
Good, I thought I was losing it.

1221
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:26,642
First thing I see
when I get out of prison

1222
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:28,199
is the thing that put me in prison.

1223
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:30,195
We've also
learned that universal studios

1224
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,380
will bring the dog by
limousine to the theme park

1225
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:35,471
for an awards ceremony, and
give it a special civic medal

1226
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:36,724
for animal bravery.

1227
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,578
Wow, they saved that
old guy from drowning.

1228
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:40,012
I hate those dogs.

1229
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,931
They're always saving somebody.

1230
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:45,352
They're gonna get a free
universal studios tour.

1231
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:46,940
I wanna go!

1232
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:48,505
We ain't got time to go on no tour.

1233
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:49,188
We gotta get to Mexico.

1234
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:50,924
Now look around for some keys or something

1235
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:52,592
to hot wire that car,
and will you hurry up

1236
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:53,616
before she comes out?

1237
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,775
Slick, slick!

1238
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:58,277
Wait, this is fate!

1239
01:21:58,539 --> 01:21:59,699
What are you talking about?

1240
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:01,829
Now we can do what the shrink said!

1241
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,870
We can go to the universal studios tour,

1242
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,743
confront the dogs and get closure!

1243
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,084
Are you crazy?

1244
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,330
Yeah, but listen, we fall down a chute,

1245
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,456
we fall into a bin, it goes onto a truck,

1246
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:13,549
we end up five miles away from pat's,

1247
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,011
we come here, and boom, the
dogs we have to confront

1248
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,802
are right there on the
TV, it's meant to be!

1249
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,620
No, no, the only
thing that's meant to be

1250
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:22,163
is for us to be sitting
on a beach in Tijuana

1251
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,677
and to never see those mutts again.

1252
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,299
Please slick, I have to do this!

1253
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:26,104
No, n-o, that's it.

1254
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:27,678
- You promised.
- I promised what?

1255
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,437
You promised mom on her deathbed

1256
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:30,855
that you'd watch after me,

1257
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:32,673
even though I wasn't your real brother!

1258
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,689
Okay, okay, okay carny,

1259
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,870
you really think this
closure thing's gonna work?

1260
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,734
Definitely, I think.

1261
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:40,031
Okay.

1262
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,289
I owe you, you know why?

1263
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,476
Because if you hadn't put all
the detergent in the machines

1264
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,957
at the laundry room prison,
we woulda never got out alive.

1265
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:46,825
See?

1266
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,452
I'm not as dumb as we think I am.

1267
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:49,328
Fine.

1268
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:50,170
We're gonna go to the universal tour,

1269
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:51,526
we're gonna confront the dogs,

1270
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,069
we're gonna get your closure your way,

1271
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:55,084
and I'm gonna get my closure my way.

1272
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,180
Deal?

1273
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:58,796
Deal, and then we go to Tijuana.

1274
01:22:59,057 --> 01:22:59,637
You got it.

1275
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:02,212
Look for something to hot wire
one of these pieces of junk.

1276
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,649
You kidnapped a kid?!

1277
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:09,974
You kidnapped a kid?!

1278
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,268
We weren't gonna hurt him!

1279
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:17,651
If that were my kid, I
would break both of your legs!

1280
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:19,971
Okay, okay you're right,
if I had it to do over again,

1281
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,115
I wouldn't do it over again.

1282
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:22,027
Look, I just want to get my money

1283
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:23,779
'cause I owe you money.

1284
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:31,082
Asking for more money and a set of wheels?

1285
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,705
I'm not crazy, Franklin!

1286
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,797
Don't call me Franklin!

1287
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:42,180
I will call you whatever I
want, you got it Franklin?!

1288
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:43,536
Okay, okay, okay, but listen,

1289
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,920
how was I supposed to pay you
back if I was stuck in prison?

1290
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,770
Always an excuse with you.

1291
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,877
Okay, okay, listen pat, we
gotta get out of the country,

1292
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:51,936
we gotta get to Mexico!

1293
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:55,561
Yeah, but first we gotta go
to universal to get closure.

1294
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:56,402
You wanna go?

1295
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:58,017
You gotta go where and get what?

1296
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,260
Don't listen to him, he's crazy.

1297
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:00,553
Oh, and I should listen to everything

1298
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:02,158
that you say, Franklin?

1299
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:03,848
Whatever happened to us getting married

1300
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,988
and starting a legit
business together, huh?

1301
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,010
Exactly, that's exactly
what I was thinking

1302
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:09,521
when I thought about carny and I

1303
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,501
going down to enchinada, Mexico.

1304
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:14,667
Wait a minute, I thought you
said we're going to Tijuana.

1305
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:16,444
Wait, yeah, we gotta stop at Tijuana

1306
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:17,048
on the way down to enchinada.

1307
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,542
And you never said anything...

1308
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,085
Carny, you mind while pat and I

1309
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:21,086
have a private conversation?

1310
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:22,383
Thank you, goodbye.

1311
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:25,383
Oh, you guys wanna talk
about lovey dovey stuff.

1312
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:27,976
Okay.

1313
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,990
This is kinda cool, can
we take this instead?

1314
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:31,688
Don't touch that!

1315
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:33,686
You know what, pat?

1316
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:35,421
There was this guy in a cell next to us

1317
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,527
that reminded me a lot of you.

1318
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:38,861
Except he didn't shave.

1319
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:39,696
Carny!

1320
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:43,408
You, stay there, shut up.

1321
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:44,662
What I do, what I do?

1322
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:45,830
What I do!

1323
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:48,624
I didn't do it!

1324
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,171
Is this one of those new
cures for a headache?

1325
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,833
Now, talk, this better be good.

1326
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,095
Okay, okay.

1327
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,503
Remember your dream about
opening a taco stand in Mexico?

1328
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:05,047
- In entinada”?
- Yeah

1329
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,425
I think my headache's gone now!

1330
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:08,266
Keep going.

1331
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,456
Okay, well this is our
chance, see, I'll go down

1332
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,060
and I'll get everything set up,

1333
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:12,930
we got a place to live, a taco stand.

1334
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:14,397
Fresh fish tacos?

1335
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:15,651
- Yeah.
- On the beach?

1336
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:18,234
Oh yeah, the waves rolling
in, beautiful sunsets

1337
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,649
and your own mariachi band.

1338
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:23,865
I love mariachi music, it's so romantic!

1339
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,119
Aww, yeah.

1340
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:27,997
Pat's fresh fish tacos.

1341
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:29,829
You promise me?

1342
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,443
Oh yeah, of course, I'll call ya

1343
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:32,081
as soon as I get everything set up.

1344
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,336
Oh boy, oh boy!

1345
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:35,832
I'll start selling all
this junk right away,

1346
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:37,875
and oh, and get my baby in tip-top shape

1347
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,133
and meet you down there!

1348
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,260
Attagirl.

1349
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:44,781
Why do you smell like soap detergent?

1350
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,505
Oh, we take a lot of baths in prison.

1351
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:47,767
Oh.

1352
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:48,389
Okay.

1353
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,564
Here you go, this should
be enough to set you up,

1354
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:52,261
and take that clunker over there,

1355
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:54,558
that should get you down there no problem.

1356
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,851
You're the best, pat!

1357
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:59,731
I think my headache's coming back!

1358
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:02,108
One thing, can you get
carny's head out of the vice?

1359
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,240
Do I have to?

1360
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:06,654
Just kidding!

1361
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:08,899
But by the time I get down there,

1362
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:10,654
carny better have his own place.

1363
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:11,916
Yeah, of course.

1364
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,164
I think you squeezed my eyes together.

1365
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:24,595
Thanks!

1366
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,547
If you don't call me,
I'll come down to encinada

1367
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:31,175
and tear that place apart
till I find ya, you hear me?

1368
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:32,767
- But we're not...
- Carny.

1369
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:33,601
We're set.

1370
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,345
The Van, over there, go.

1371
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:36,607
Thanks, pat.

1372
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:39,895
Shame we can't take this instead.

1373
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,197
Don't!

1374
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:45,950
Sorry!

1375
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:48,991
Run, carny!

1376
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,536
Get in the Van!

1377
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:02,174
Charlie!

1378
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:03,259
Samson!

1379
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:04,048
Hercules!

1380
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:04,882
Come on, hurry up!

1381
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,968
Your dad's gonna be on TV!

1382
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:10,395
I've just
received a news bulletin.

1383
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,214
This is live breaking news.

1384
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:12,876
The jury has just reached a verdict

1385
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:14,419
on the truth in advertising lawsuit

1386
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:15,806
against the tobacco company.

1387
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,976
The da's lead prosecutor
handled the criminal trial.

1388
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,974
Senate star witness Harry Burton

1389
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,568
deserves credit for standing
up to the tobacco company

1390
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:25,153
and doing the right thing.

1391
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,489
Harry Burton is an American hero.

1392
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:29,011
His testimony... - Give me five!

1393
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:30,304
Helped find the defendants

1394
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:30,908
guilty of criminal misconduct.

1395
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,432
They face possible prison terms.

1396
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:33,036
Give me five!

1397
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,997
Next up, the weather.
