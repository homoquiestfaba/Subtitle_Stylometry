1
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,108
Oh, my God.

2
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:14,523
Jess told me that he is,
like, way into Ella.

3
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:17,380
Ugh, can you say "slut"?

4
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:20,164
- I heard she gave him a blumpie.
- Ew.

5
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:21,692
Boys are disgusting.

6
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:24,482
And that guy, Nick,
he thinks he's all, like,

7
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,721
"Look at me; I'm so beautiful."

8
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:28,844
- I think he's kind of cute.
- No, no.

9
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:33,342
I mean, he's kind of hot,
but he's not God's gift. No.

10
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:34,908
I heard he hooked up with Michelle.

11
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:37,021
No, he did not!

12
00:00:37,126 --> 00:00:40,541
He totally did, like, for real.

13
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:41,987
Funny.

14
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:43,744
School night. Bedtime.

15
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:45,668
But I'm studying with Lisa.

16
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:47,675
Hey.

17
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,683
Hey, Lis, where's that big party
this weekend?

18
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:51,901
Looks like she signed off.

19
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:53,892
Ooh, shocker.

20
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:56,574
Hey, isn't it past your bedtime?

21
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:57,757
Night, sweetie.

22
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,071
- I love you, sweetie.
- Love you.

23
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:00,066
- Good night.
- Mwah.

24
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:02,237
- Night, honey.
- Night.

25
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:10,626
Hi.

26
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:13,594
Shh.

27
00:01:22,788 --> 00:01:24,194
Oh, my gosh, that's so cool!

28
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:35,066
I was standing next to Chris
in science class today,

29
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,829
and he turned, and he looked at me

30
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,141
out of the corner of his eye,

31
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:41,788
but I knew, I knew he was
looking right at me.

32
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:47,706
So then we start talking
about something.

33
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:49,566
I don't know. It was really silly.

34
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,935
And then we just, like,

35
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,889
started talking about lunch and stuff.

36
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:55,001
But it was really nice.

37
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:56,283
And then he asked me,

38
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:57,596
"Did you do the homework?"

39
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:58,559
And I said, "Yeah."

40
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:00,087
And he said, "Can I copy it?"

41
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:01,536
And I said, "Yeah."

42
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:04,022
I almost died.

43
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,219
I'm gonna have to call you back.

44
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:14,263
Bye.

45
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,168
Jake?

46
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:31,132
Jake?

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,669
Dad?

48
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:47,605
Mom?

49
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,392
Do what I say, and you live.

50
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:03,416
I'm going to kill your mother
or your father.

51
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:07,163
You have 60 seconds to decide.

52
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:08,123
No!

53
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,044
Choose,

54
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:12,892
or I kill them both.

55
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,583
I can't! I can't!

56
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:18,297
Then that is your choice,

57
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,860
and they both die.

58
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,079
No, no, no, no!

59
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:22,043
No!

60
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:23,418
Choose!

61
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:25,144
Me, me, me, me, me!

62
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:27,350
Kill me!

63
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:31,867
Something to add, Dad?

64
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:32,826
Please!

65
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:34,354
Please calm down!

66
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:35,770
I will give you whatever you want.

67
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:38,073
Please don't hurt my family!

68
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:40,245
Come here, Jake.

69
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:51,763
All right, look.

70
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:53,395
Okay, okay.

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,361
You can do it. Choose me.

72
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,573
Just choose me.

73
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:57,815
Otherwise he's gonna kill
our whole family.

74
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,088
Please, just be brave and choose me.

75
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:01,977
Please, no.

76
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,024
I can't, Daddy.

77
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:04,080
Yes, you can.

78
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:05,049
Yes, you can.

79
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:07,963
Choose!

80
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,394
He's gonna kill us all if you don't.

81
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:11,604
You can do it!

82
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,457
All right, my father.

83
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,482
My father!

84
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:16,921
What?

85
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,743
Please. Come on, now.

86
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:21,363
That a girl. That a girl.

87
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:22,449
My father!

88
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:26,384
Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry!

89
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:27,952
Okay, that's okay.

90
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:28,920
All right.

91
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,888
I love you, Daddy!

92
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:42,613
And you will have to do the dirty work.

93
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:52,047
Pick it up!

94
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:01,104
You can do it.

95
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,802
Be brave. Come on, sweetie.

96
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:05,616
I can't.

97
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:11,829
Your choices have ramifications, Daddy.

98
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,816
Now!

99
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:14,993
I can't! I can't!

100
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,103
You can do it. You can do it.

101
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,069
Now!

102
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,175
- I can't!
- Do it.

103
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,319
Yes, you can, please!

104
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:23,318
Daddy!

105
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:24,495
Do it now!

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,193
Come on. That a girl.

107
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:27,604
- Daddy!
- Damn it, do it now!

108
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:30,257
Yes, Sara!

109
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,886
Do it!

110
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:33,966
Now, God damn it!

111
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:36,077
Do it now!

112
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:40,277
Daddy!

113
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:08,447
CHOOSE

114
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,797
Sheriff's deputies began
a search this morning

115
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:33,350
for two men who went missing
on the lake yesterday.

116
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:34,698
The sheriff says a family member

117
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,937
reported the 19-year-old and 20-year-old

118
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,631
missing early this morning.

119
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:41,288
The two men whose names
are not being released yet

120
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,976
were last seen camping
in the area of the lake.

121
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:46,948
Investigators said a canoe
was missing from the shoreline.

122
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:49,159
The Sheriff's Department
and New York State Police

123
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,439
are helping in the search.

124
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:51,786
We have a crew headed to the scene,

125
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,260
and we'll bring you more information

126
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,372
as it becomes available.

127
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:56,004
Thank you, Sandy.

128
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,651
The victim was 57-year-old

129
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,610
defense attorney Elliot Vincent.

130
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,162
Police sources say the suspect
bound and gagged

131
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,674
Vincent and his wife.

132
00:09:45,771 --> 00:09:48,259
Then they say the suspect made
Vincent's teenage daughter

133
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:50,402
choose which parent should die,

134
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,936
threatening to kill the entire family

135
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:53,450
if she didn't.

136
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:55,816
Police describe the alleged
killer as a Caucasian male,

137
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:57,191
approximately six feet tall,

138
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,738
wearing a dark hooded
sweatshirt and knit cap.

139
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:02,630
Vincent was best known for his role

140
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,705
in the highly publicized
Wilshire Barrett case.

141
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,566
That case involved alleged sexual abuse

142
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,389
in several state-run
correctional facilities

143
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,312
throughout the county.

144
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:20,667
- Oh, God!
- Jesus!

145
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:22,332
What the hell's the matter with you?

146
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:23,646
You scared the shit out of me!

147
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:27,392
Well, you left your door open.
Are you okay?

148
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:31,103
And you're certain
that the door was locked?

149
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:33,112
Positive. I had just checked it.

150
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:35,520
Okay, 'cause there's no sign
of forced entry.

151
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,888
So you don't believe me?

152
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:38,969
I'm not saying that.

153
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,220
The door was locked.

154
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:43,040
Ever since this article came out,

155
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,204
I've had, like, 50 phone calls
down at the station,

156
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:48,695
everybody in varying degrees
of hysteria.

157
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,941
Oh, Dad.

158
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:53,246
I know what you're thinking.

159
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:54,939
Little Fiona living all alone

160
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,409
with a overactive
reporter's imagination.

161
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:58,716
Easy, easy, okay?

162
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:00,345
We'll dust for prints.
We'll investigate.

163
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,694
It's just-- you want my gut on this?

164
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,255
I think it's one of your stupid friends.

165
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:06,045
I don't have friends that
will pull a prank like that.

166
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:07,258
Okay, what about Paul?

167
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:08,703
He's harmless.

168
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:11,354
Okay, I give up.

169
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,694
I'm sorry. I'll take it more seriously.

170
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,996
In fact, why don't you sleep
at home tonight?

171
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:19,196
For security reasons:
popcorn, old movies.

172
00:13:20,993 --> 00:13:24,505
Dad, I lost the pigtails years ago:

173
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:25,623
Mm-hmm.

174
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:26,906
I'm getting my masters in June.

175
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:28,219
Not if I talk to your professors

176
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,749
and they agree to flunk you.

177
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:32,703
Just dust for prints.

178
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,748
Please?

179
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,066
Okay.

180
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:36,728
Let's talk about this
for a moment, though,

181
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:38,293
the scanner you're not supposed to have.

182
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,447
I know.

183
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,046
I just like to keep track of you.

184
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:42,134
Of me?

185
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,094
Not of your next story, big headlines?

186
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:45,718
All you, all the time.

187
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:47,132
All right.

188
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:49,119
Then clearly you won't mind
that I dusted for prints,

189
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:50,709
because as you mentioned--

190
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:52,757
Oh, jeez. Hold on.

191
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,152
Go for Wagner.

192
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:57,684
Yeah.

193
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,660
Uh-huh.

194
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,839
Ouch.

195
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:03,837
Okay.

196
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:05,822
Yeah.

197
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,806
I have to go.

198
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:10,106
I'll take this for prints.

199
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:12,377
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

200
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,267
Just a domestic disturbance
kind of thing.

201
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:15,414
I'll see you soon.

202
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:18,453
My mom would get the axe.

203
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,598
She spends every dime of my inheritance

204
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:23,123
without my old man keeping tabs on her.

205
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,750
I don't know. I guess my dad?

206
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:27,097
Or shit, maybe my mom.

207
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,310
You know what? Forget this.

208
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:29,689
I don't even want to think about it.

209
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:31,829
What about you, Fiona?
Which one would you choose?

210
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,072
You are such a dumb-ass.

211
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,121
Hello?

212
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:37,018
Shit, I-I spaced. I'm sorry, Fi.

213
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:38,164
I'm sorry.

214
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:39,250
Oh, look at that.

215
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:42,291
Not having a mom has its advantages.

216
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:43,706
How about this one?

217
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:45,398
You have to sleep with that guy or me?

218
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,507
- Choose.
- Ooh, tough one.

219
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:49,205
- I feel your pain, Fi.
- You have to choose.

220
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:50,901
You have a gun to your head.

221
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:52,378
I don't, and I won't.

222
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,654
Choose.

223
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,895
Jesus, Paul, back off, why don't you?

224
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,490
I'm just kidding. God.

225
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,123
Look, guys, I got to go.

226
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:00,406
Well, South Bat tonight?

227
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:02,711
No, I don't know.
I got to finish my paper.

228
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:05,332
Blah, blah, blah.
Just get your ass there, okay?

229
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:06,777
Idiot.

230
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:12,308
Go by Jefferson Hall.

231
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,528
A little less staccato
in that last measure.

232
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,386
Otherwise, very nice.

233
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:03,762
Bravo.

234
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:06,098
I will see you all one hour
before the performance tomorrow.

235
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:08,784
David, would it be all right
if I hang back for a while

236
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:10,347
and run through it on my own?

237
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:11,860
By all means.

238
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,845
You're coming along nicely, by the way.

239
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:15,981
Late bloomer, I guess.

240
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:20,490
Mind the house lights when you leave.

241
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:58,761
Hello?

242
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:01,452
Who--who's there?

243
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:02,503
Thank you.

244
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:07,182
Um, I was just leaving.

245
00:18:07,282 --> 00:18:08,143
Sorry.

246
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:09,103
Oh.

247
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,227
Hello?

248
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:15,752
I just wanted to practice the end,

249
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:18,892
but I'm done, so it's fine.

250
00:18:22,162 --> 00:18:23,110
David?

251
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:27,374
Is that you?

252
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,586
Hello?

253
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:35,017
Hey!

254
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,903
Stop screwing around!

255
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,501
Hey!

256
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,582
I'm still in here.

257
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:06,443
Come on, open up.

258
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:22,756
Who is that?

259
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,667
slam!

260
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:42,251
Oh, God.

261
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:50,339
Who's that? Who are you?

262
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:52,650
I'm a member of the orchestra.
It's okay for me to be here.

263
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:55,116
I mean, I'm just David's friend.

264
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:03,622
Just take-- take my money.

265
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:05,830
I don't want your money, Simon.

266
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:11,464
I am going to take something
much more dear to you than that.

267
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:13,834
Either you lose the ability to hear

268
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:18,056
or your lose the ability to play.

269
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:25,961
Shut up! This way!

270
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,402
Hurry up! Get on your knees!

271
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,923
Okay!

272
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:33,505
Choose.

273
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:37,960
Your hearing...

274
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:42,085
or your fingers.

275
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:43,594
Why is this happening?

276
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:46,473
You have 60 seconds to decide.

277
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:49,254
What's it gonna be?

278
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:51,242
Fine.

279
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:53,989
Fingers.

280
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:57,222
But you have one more choice to make.

281
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,624
All at once

282
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:04,326
or one at a time?

283
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:07,295
Choose!

284
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:18,951
crunch!

285
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:46,717
ISO_17?

286
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:48,133
ISO_17.

287
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:13,185
Hey, hey, no sleeping in here!

288
00:23:13,284 --> 00:23:14,211
God damn it.

289
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:16,031
How'd you even get--

290
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,177
Shit.

291
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,431
So the janitor found
the poor bastard passed out

292
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:27,459
in the staircase.

293
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:29,343
No witnesses, no security cameras.

294
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:30,784
Great. What else?

295
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:34,680
Looks like we got a pattern.

296
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:36,793
That's blood.

297
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:40,161
From the crime scene last night.

298
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:41,306
That's a match.

299
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,588
Where's the victim?

300
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,316
Covenant Hospital.

301
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:47,037
Show me where they found him.

302
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:47,999
How bad is it?

303
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:49,276
He'll live.

304
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:50,807
I'm not sure how much
he's gonna want to.

305
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:52,059
Snipped off all his fingers

306
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,885
and made sure they
couldn't be sewn back on.

307
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,130
Oh, shit.

308
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:01,240
Yeah, that's the symbol
I told you about.

309
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,964
I already got Jamie on it.

310
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:06,935
Christ almighty.

311
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,594
The aforementioned fingers.

312
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:15,452
Sheriff Wagner. Follow me.

313
00:24:15,552 --> 00:24:17,886
Sheriff Wagner, any comments
for the evening news?

314
00:24:17,984 --> 00:24:19,129
- No.
- Come on, Tom.

315
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:20,313
Throw me a bone here.

316
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,009
Your kid wants to join their ranks?

317
00:24:22,113 --> 00:24:23,258
Good times.

318
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,230
Sheriff Wagner has no comment.

319
00:24:26,336 --> 00:24:27,765
"Sources close to the investigation

320
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:29,247
"say the attacker forced the victim

321
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,067
"to choose between losing his hearing

322
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:32,662
or losing his fingers."

323
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,328
How does a person
do something like that?

324
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,057
You know, personally, I think I'd rather

325
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,916
lose my hearing and be deaf
than lose my fingers,

326
00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:39,030
but the guy was a pianist,

327
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:41,143
so a pretty raw deal either way, right?

328
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,735
Hello? What is with you?

329
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,662
You're acting all weird. Are you okay?

330
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,003
If I tell you something,

331
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:49,045
do you promise not to think I'm crazy?

332
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,966
- Forget about it.
- No, tell me.

333
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,372
No, really, let's just drop it.

334
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:54,747
Fi!

335
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:01,213
In her note,
my mom talked about choices,

336
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:02,456
and it never made sense.

337
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:04,347
But what if someone made her choose,

338
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:06,334
choose between doing what she did

339
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,528
or--or something else
that was even more horrible?

340
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,386
That would explain it, right?

341
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:13,493
Then it would make sense.

342
00:25:13,598 --> 00:25:15,573
Have you spoken
to your father about this?

343
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:17,619
God, I can't talk to him
about this stuff.

344
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,514
Last time I tried,
he totally freaked out on me.

345
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:21,021
Maybe you should just try, Fi.

346
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:22,776
You know, maybe you should just try.

347
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:30,641
You're right.

348
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:31,894
It's silly.

349
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,128
I'm just being silly.

350
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:05,425
Mr. Campbell?

351
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:08,531
Not another one of you.

352
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,457
I just...

353
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:12,016
I just want to get some sleep.

354
00:26:12,123 --> 00:26:15,090
Of course.

355
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:17,016
I understand.

356
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:20,849
Get on with it already.

357
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,572
Come on, come on.

358
00:26:25,914 --> 00:26:31,577
Um, is there anything else
you can think of that might help

359
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,528
identify the guy who did this to you?

360
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:35,993
How many times
do I have to go over this?

361
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,715
It was dark.

362
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:40,469
He had a flashlight
in my eyes the whole time.

363
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:43,384
I don't know who he was
or how he knew my name--

364
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:45,587
He knew your name?

365
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:50,065
What else did he know about you?

366
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:52,590
Nothing, I guess.

367
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:54,257
Did he say anything to you
that stuck out

368
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,303
or anything that you could
think of that might have--

369
00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:00,915
Something about choices
and, uh, ramifications

370
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:02,096
or something like that.

371
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,622
I don't know.

372
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:09,748
There must be a reason
why he picked you.

373
00:27:09,848 --> 00:27:12,052
There must be a reason
why he chose you.

374
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:13,134
Can you think of anything?

375
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,451
Do you know him?

376
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:16,723
Have you ever met somebody
that might do this to you

377
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:17,937
or anything?

378
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,796
Please, there must be a reason.

379
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:24,052
I just--

380
00:27:24,152 --> 00:27:26,835
I just want to get some sleep.

381
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:36,079
Okay, next.

382
00:29:36,177 --> 00:29:37,038
Okay, okay.

383
00:29:37,137 --> 00:29:38,249
Do you have the camera?

384
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:42,826
Try a little less smile.

385
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:44,074
You got five frames.

386
00:29:44,176 --> 00:29:45,551
Great, but it's not been the five best

387
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:46,542
we've had so far, okay?

388
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,589
Come on, give me a nice smile.

389
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:49,354
Just give me your eyes. There you go.

390
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:50,951
You know what? I'm over this.

391
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,926
I'm done. I'm done.

392
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,608
Asshole.

393
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,238
All right, you know,
let me see everything

394
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:04,620
from the first camera right away.

395
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,378
Just forget about the other one
for now, okay?

396
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:09,770
No, I just wrapped.

397
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:11,814
A bullshit day, as always.

398
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:12,934
I don't feel well.

399
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,217
Listen, I need to eat.

400
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,069
So if you don't mind
putting in an order for me,

401
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:18,890
that would be great.

402
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:19,852
Yeah, I know.

403
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,227
Baby, I know, but listen--

404
00:30:21,327 --> 00:30:22,505
I-- okay.

405
00:30:22,606 --> 00:30:23,621
Fine.

406
00:30:23,726 --> 00:30:24,839
Hey, sorry. I'm sorry.

407
00:30:24,942 --> 00:30:26,153
We're just--we're wrapped up.

408
00:30:26,254 --> 00:30:27,661
Can you see that I'm on the phone here?

409
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,003
- Yeah, seriously.
- Okay.

410
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:30,248
Not a conversation for you.

411
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,008
Get the fuck out of here.

412
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,157
No, just some idiot.

413
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:35,466
I'm sorry.

414
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:37,126
No, don't be such a fucking asshole.

415
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,310
No, I don't care.

416
00:30:38,414 --> 00:30:40,007
He just walked in here
and was eavesdropping

417
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,637
on my whole conversation.

418
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:42,822
All right.

419
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,452
Yeah, well,
you better start thinking of me

420
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:45,419
for a change, all right?

421
00:30:45,518 --> 00:30:47,460
Yeah, okay.

422
00:30:47,565 --> 00:30:49,420
Yeah, well, that's your opinion.

423
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:51,557
I'll see you later.

424
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:52,871
If you want to get laid tonight,

425
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:54,947
you better drop the fucking attitude.

426
00:30:58,893 --> 00:31:00,038
What?

427
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:03,043
No, go away.

428
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:06,467
Listen, I'll be done when I'm done.

429
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:07,652
Just give me a minute.

430
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,915
Are you fucking kidding me?

431
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,191
What the-- listen, you little shit,

432
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:14,666
whatever the fuck your name is,

433
00:31:14,764 --> 00:31:16,171
if you expect to come back here tomorrow

434
00:31:16,268 --> 00:31:17,129
and have a job--

435
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:18,886
Hey, not funny!

436
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:20,549
I thought you loved the camera, Jenna.

437
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:22,213
Who the fuck are you, you creepy fuck?

438
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:25,251
Sticks and stones will break your bones.

439
00:31:25,356 --> 00:31:27,145
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

440
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:28,454
Vain to the very end.

441
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:31,589
Not afraid for your life,
just for your face.

442
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,601
Help!

443
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,871
I want to offer you a choice.

444
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:39,076
You have 60 seconds to decide.

445
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,862
What is more dear to you, bitch?

446
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:45,258
Your eyesight or your beauty?

447
00:31:45,355 --> 00:31:48,290
You'll either never be able
to see yourself again,

448
00:31:48,395 --> 00:31:53,959
or the world will see what
a miserable hag you really are.

449
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,890
No, please!

450
00:32:01,994 --> 00:32:05,638
Now let me see
those big, beautiful lips.

451
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:08,126
No, please!

452
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,460
The hourglass is handmade.

453
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:27,493
And I've timed it.

454
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,767
It's exactly one minute.

455
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,244
Down to the frickin' second.

456
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,709
Perfection is certainly
keeping with the profile.

457
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,871
Hey, Alice. My dad here?

458
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:37,249
Yeah, his office.

459
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:40,669
So that's now two handmade hourglasses.

460
00:33:40,773 --> 00:33:41,820
They match perfectly.

461
00:33:41,925 --> 00:33:43,386
The last crime scene and now this one.

462
00:33:43,493 --> 00:33:46,591
We got zero fingerprints, zero hair.

463
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,449
This guy's good, really good.

464
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:50,752
We've never seen this level
of expertise before.

465
00:33:50,853 --> 00:33:53,570
I'm just waiting on
the DNA report from Forensics,

466
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:55,741
see if we can get anything on the blood.

467
00:33:55,844 --> 00:33:57,251
I just heard the vic, Simon Campbell,

468
00:33:57,348 --> 00:33:59,420
has regained consciousness
up at Covenant Hospital,

469
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:01,564
so I'm gonna head over there
and question him, all right?

470
00:34:01,668 --> 00:34:03,970
And let me know if anything
clicks with our piano man.

471
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:07,231
Hey, Ms. Pulitzer herself.

472
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:08,958
- Hmm.
- How you doing?

473
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:10,652
Good. You?

474
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:12,894
Oh, you know, been worse.

475
00:34:12,995 --> 00:34:14,489
Been better.

476
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:19,932
Hey.

477
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,420
- Bad time?
- No, no.

478
00:34:23,523 --> 00:34:24,864
Just promise me you'll never become

479
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,425
one of these bottom-feeders.

480
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,993
No comment.

481
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,954
That's my line.

482
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:31,131
Whole town's in a tizzy

483
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:33,471
because there might be
a madman on the loose.

484
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,959
Well, isn't there?

485
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:37,081
It's a little early

486
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:39,041
to be broadcasting
that kind of hysteria.

487
00:34:39,138 --> 00:34:41,888
So the crimes actually aren't connected?

488
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:43,393
I'm not saying that.

489
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,279
Then there's a maniac on the loose.

490
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:47,069
Are we really having this discussion?

491
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,315
You taking notes?

492
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:50,490
God help the cops on your beat.

493
00:34:50,593 --> 00:34:51,771
Please, come in.

494
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:54,045
Sit down.

495
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:02,718
I got a pop-up message
this morning on my computer.

496
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:05,784
Photographs of this woman
tortured, burned.

497
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:07,166
I think she might be dead.

498
00:35:07,265 --> 00:35:09,752
Uh-huh.

499
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,369
You know, that's terrible.

500
00:35:13,472 --> 00:35:14,846
I'm not saying it isn't,

501
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:17,333
and I don't mean to downplay
what you're going through here.

502
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,709
It's just that it could be spam.

503
00:35:19,808 --> 00:35:21,401
It could be one of your stupid friends.

504
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:25,530
It had the same symbol
right there from that musician!

505
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:28,572
Why didn't you tell me?

506
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:29,817
Why didn't I tell you?

507
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,229
That's classified information.

508
00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:33,694
Listen, I can't tell you everything,
all right?

509
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:35,220
There's this crazy little fuzzy line

510
00:35:35,328 --> 00:35:36,407
between being your father

511
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,551
and being in charge of an investigation,

512
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:40,695
not to mention your
soon-to-be chosen prof--

513
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,709
Don't give me that look.

514
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:44,124
Your mother gave me that look.

515
00:35:44,223 --> 00:35:45,270
You piss her off too?

516
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,317
Quite regularly.

517
00:35:52,255 --> 00:35:55,833
What I wouldn't give
for one of her looks right now.

518
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:57,974
Oh, Fi.

519
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,348
She would be so proud of you,
all this nosing around.

520
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:10,519
Coming up on the anniversary.

521
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:11,515
Is that right?

522
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:14,035
It comes up so quick every year.

523
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:16,149
Oh, come on, Dad.

524
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:17,660
There's a lot of stress in the office,

525
00:36:17,757 --> 00:36:20,724
in case you hadn't noticed.

526
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:22,389
Get your team to look at this, please.

527
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:24,020
I will. I promise.

528
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:26,427
Just promise me you're gonna
stay away from this case.

529
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:28,019
- Promise.
- Okay, go.

530
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:30,361
Go, go, go already.

531
00:36:36,604 --> 00:36:38,230
I told you she'd be a heartbreaker.

532
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,340
Yeah, you did say something about that.

533
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:42,746
Imagine if it was yours.

534
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:46,390
Have forensics examine this
hard drive, will you, please?

535
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:47,801
We, uh, we just got a call.

536
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,362
Looks like we got another one.

537
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:50,711
Photo studio downtown.

538
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:53,332
Young woman, tortured, burned?

539
00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:55,672
Jesus, you're good.

540
00:36:55,772 --> 00:36:57,179
How the fuck did you get that?

541
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:55,344
Hello! Are you coming out
with us tonight?

542
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:57,456
God!

543
00:37:57,561 --> 00:37:58,837
You know, your door was open again.

544
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:00,562
You got to get that fixed.

545
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:04,079
Yeah, I know.

546
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:05,940
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

547
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,950
Okay, fun

548
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:09,398
or whatever the hell you're doing:

549
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,511
it's your choice.

550
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:12,590
Oh, God, it's gone viral already.

551
00:38:12,696 --> 00:38:13,808
Look, I'm sorry.

552
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:16,432
I'm in tonight, but thanks anyway.

553
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:19,153
All right, okay. Suit yourself.

554
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,710
But will you just promise me
you'll lock your door this time?

555
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:23,572
Yes, I'll lock the door.

556
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:24,948
Bye.

557
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:26,356
Okay.

558
00:38:26,455 --> 00:38:28,016
Bye.

559
00:39:10,229 --> 00:39:12,083
Hello?

560
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:14,898
Hello?

561
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,697
Anybody there?

562
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:24,678
Can I help you?

563
00:41:26,127 --> 00:41:27,141
I'm sorry.

564
00:41:27,247 --> 00:41:28,654
I tried the office, but no one answered.

565
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,612
I was just leaving.

566
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,638
Wait.

567
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:32,424
You're trespassing.

568
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:34,053
I could call the cops, you know.

569
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:38,217
But you, uh...

570
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:40,357
you look like maybe you like to party.

571
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:44,131
Excuse me.

572
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:54,115
You smell good.

573
00:41:57,485 --> 00:42:01,096
Like apples.

574
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:03,750
I like apples.

575
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:06,754
Yeah?

576
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,675
Yeah.

577
00:42:10,732 --> 00:42:11,877
How do you like them apples?

578
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:19,526
346...

579
00:43:25,513 --> 00:43:27,782
Huh.

580
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:29,790
The Barometer of Morality.

581
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,905
Hmm.

582
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,734
I see 6941.704.

583
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:51,134
69...694...

584
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,581
Oh, God.

585
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,134
Oh, Paul, God damn it!

586
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:56,483
A little on edge?

587
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:57,925
God, a little.

588
00:43:58,023 --> 00:44:00,389
Hey, so are you going
to South Bat tonight or what?

589
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:02,690
I can't. I'm buried.

590
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:04,252
Bummer.

591
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:07,806
All right, I got to go find
my Environmental Economy texts.

592
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:08,772
Okay.

593
00:44:08,871 --> 00:44:09,819
Don't study too much, okay?

594
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:12,065
Do you need to unwind a little?

595
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,475
You want to make out?

596
00:44:13,574 --> 00:44:14,435
No!

597
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:27,191
Hey, I would like to check these out.

598
00:45:27,298 --> 00:45:30,876
Hmm, Free Choice Psychology,

599
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,294
Pathology of lrrational Choices,

600
00:45:34,403 --> 00:45:37,250
and Choices: The Barometer of Morality.

601
00:45:37,346 --> 00:45:40,215
All right.

602
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:43,067
Hmm.

603
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:46,366
These aren't ours.

604
00:45:46,466 --> 00:45:47,643
Excuse me?

605
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:50,681
Yeah, they're not showing up
in the system.

606
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:57,759
Next.

607
00:46:09,921 --> 00:46:12,474
Sorry, guys.

608
00:46:12,576 --> 00:46:14,070
I'd prefer more of a tropical landscape,

609
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:15,037
to be honest with you.

610
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,288
I'm not really sure.

611
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:23,868
Brian.

612
00:46:23,968 --> 00:46:27,067
Fi, what's up?

613
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:29,272
Can you check this out for me?

614
00:46:29,376 --> 00:46:31,263
Yeah, sure. Just give me a second.

615
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,603
Sorry, guys. Closing time.

616
00:46:32,704 --> 00:46:34,230
Got to go. Sorry.

617
00:46:34,335 --> 00:46:35,545
- Sorry, guys.
- Sorry.

618
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:36,629
- Thank you.
- See you.

619
00:46:36,735 --> 00:46:39,157
I'll help you with the next one.

620
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,238
Peace. See you, man.

621
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:42,717
Yeah, come on in.

622
00:46:42,815 --> 00:46:45,368
Take a seat.

623
00:46:45,471 --> 00:46:46,551
Well, what I can tell you is,

624
00:46:46,655 --> 00:46:48,313
is that we have
seven binary identifiers,

625
00:46:48,415 --> 00:46:50,455
a constant width module,
and an interweaving matrix.

626
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,282
- English.
- It's barcode.

627
00:46:52,382 --> 00:46:53,811
Yeah, I kind of got that far myself.

628
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:55,413
Can you look it up?

629
00:46:56,766 --> 00:46:58,653
Yes, I can look it up.

630
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,019
Just give me one second here.

631
00:47:05,278 --> 00:47:08,791
That's weird.

632
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:15,127
No.

633
00:47:15,229 --> 00:47:18,873
Um...

634
00:47:18,973 --> 00:47:21,275
It's Codabar.

635
00:47:21,373 --> 00:47:22,583
This isn't current barcode.

636
00:47:22,685 --> 00:47:24,059
Meaning?

637
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:26,164
Meaning it's, like,
old linear code used in libraries

638
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:27,830
way before the digital age.

639
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:29,427
Nobody uses this anymore.

640
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:32,053
Where did you get these books?

641
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:33,945
Can you trace it?

642
00:47:34,045 --> 00:47:35,092
I can try.

643
00:47:35,197 --> 00:47:36,625
Really don't have
much to work with here.

644
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,212
Got nothing here.

645
00:47:44,316 --> 00:47:45,177
Are you sure?

646
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:46,355
Yep.

647
00:48:03,835 --> 00:48:04,850
The last four numbers

648
00:48:04,955 --> 00:48:07,289
look like the Dewey decimal numbers.

649
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:08,849
Holy shit.

650
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:11,027
Who doesn't love a girl who
knows the Dewey decimal system?

651
00:48:11,131 --> 00:48:13,946
Do you think the other numbers
are a branch code, a city,

652
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:15,253
a state, or something?

653
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:16,434
Maybe.

654
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:17,815
That's not a bad idea.

655
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:24,367
What's that number?

656
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,246
Milburn.

657
00:48:28,346 --> 00:48:30,353
That's, like, a half hour from here.

658
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:32,050
Yeah. Let's see.

659
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:42,770
The only problem is, there are
no libraries in Milburn.

660
00:48:42,873 --> 00:48:45,491
Well, maybe it's a private school,

661
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:46,574
an old folks' home,

662
00:48:46,681 --> 00:48:48,023
or something else that has a library.

663
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,364
I mean, it's a possibility.

664
00:48:49,465 --> 00:48:50,512
But I'm telling you,

665
00:48:50,617 --> 00:48:52,307
the only public institution I see here

666
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:54,830
is Milburn Juvenile Detention,
and that's about it.

667
00:48:54,937 --> 00:48:56,082
And it closed in 2000.

668
00:48:56,185 --> 00:48:58,007
Where the hell did you get
these books from again?

669
00:48:58,104 --> 00:48:59,959
Look up why they closed.

670
00:49:04,216 --> 00:49:05,329
Whoa, holy shit.

671
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:06,676
"After extensive inquiries,

672
00:49:06,776 --> 00:49:08,947
"charges were never filed
as the evidence was considered

673
00:49:09,048 --> 00:49:10,640
purely circumstantial."

674
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,350
Jesus.

675
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:16,397
Does that look circumstantial to you?

676
00:49:16,504 --> 00:49:17,486
Absolutely not.

677
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:19,053
The official story: "The Milburn guards

678
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:20,174
were cleared of all charges."

679
00:49:20,279 --> 00:49:22,167
But they closed the place anyway.

680
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:23,572
Yep.

681
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:27,758
These books are from there.

682
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:28,878
He's from there.

683
00:49:28,983 --> 00:49:30,412
Are you talking about Mr. Choose-it?

684
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:31,893
How the hell do you know that, Fi?

685
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:36,246
I just know.

686
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:40,882
Brian, thank you.

687
00:49:43,862 --> 00:49:45,902
So far, the pattern is no pattern.

688
00:49:46,006 --> 00:49:47,828
Hundred miles apart, male, female,

689
00:49:47,926 --> 00:49:49,933
different jobs, lifestyles.

690
00:49:50,038 --> 00:49:52,656
The latest DNA check on
the blood tells us what, Alice?

691
00:49:52,758 --> 00:49:54,797
Nothing matches the database so far.

692
00:49:54,902 --> 00:49:57,203
But the maze for Jenna Marlowe

693
00:49:57,301 --> 00:49:59,374
was drawn in Simon Campbell's blood.

694
00:49:59,477 --> 00:50:00,721
He appeared to know all of them,

695
00:50:00,822 --> 00:50:02,066
or at least knew facts about them.

696
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,758
That simply tells us
that he stalked them.

697
00:50:03,861 --> 00:50:06,894
Well, we got to start thinking
about this in a whole new light,

698
00:50:06,997 --> 00:50:08,753
a different angle,
different possibilities.

699
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:11,341
Maybe the victim isn't the target.

700
00:50:11,444 --> 00:50:13,037
Case in point, young Sara.

701
00:50:13,141 --> 00:50:16,490
What if she's the target
instead of her father?

702
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,938
She brings the killer to the family.

703
00:50:18,037 --> 00:50:18,985
She feels responsible.

704
00:50:19,092 --> 00:50:20,467
She was forced to kill her own father

705
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:22,059
in front of her mother and brother.

706
00:50:22,164 --> 00:50:24,073
I'm simply suggesting
that we examine this from--

707
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,035
and by the way, when I say "we,"

708
00:50:26,132 --> 00:50:27,594
I'm of course referring to those of us

709
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,424
involved in official police business.

710
00:50:29,523 --> 00:50:30,505
It is my business.

711
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:33,263
He keeps making it my business.

712
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:37,640
He just dropped these off
while I was in the library.

713
00:50:37,748 --> 00:50:39,438
We just tracked the same thing
a few hours ago,

714
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:40,881
the same book, in fact.

715
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,867
Yeah, but the real clue
is more where they came from,

716
00:50:42,963 --> 00:50:43,824
not what's in them.

717
00:50:43,923 --> 00:50:45,646
Fi, this is dangerous.

718
00:50:45,747 --> 00:50:47,437
What are you doing
holding on to this stuff?

719
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:50,855
If he wanted to hurt me,
he would have already.

720
00:50:50,963 --> 00:50:52,850
Can't you see that he wants me
personally involved?

721
00:50:52,947 --> 00:50:54,223
He wants me to find out about him,

722
00:50:54,323 --> 00:50:55,468
probably to publicize his story.

723
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:56,519
Okay, hold it a second.

724
00:50:56,627 --> 00:50:57,936
If he wants a story on the front page,

725
00:50:58,034 --> 00:50:59,889
he's got a dozen or so
working writers here in town.

726
00:50:59,986 --> 00:51:01,774
Hell, the Times is less
than a hundred miles away.

727
00:51:01,874 --> 00:51:02,921
No offense, but why you?

728
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,928
Look, whatever the reason is,
he chose me.

729
00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:08,878
What have you got?

730
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,551
These books are from Milburn
Juvenile Detention Center.

731
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:14,959
These barcodes here prove that.

732
00:51:15,057 --> 00:51:16,235
They're actually Codabar,

733
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:19,021
an old system that they used
back in the '70s.

734
00:51:19,122 --> 00:51:21,227
Milburn closed down
more than eight years ago.

735
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,624
These books came from there,
so he came from there.

736
00:51:26,129 --> 00:51:27,144
Okay, good work.

737
00:51:27,249 --> 00:51:28,972
We'll check it out.

738
00:51:29,073 --> 00:51:30,283
But for now, everybody goes home,

739
00:51:30,385 --> 00:51:31,978
gets some sleep.

740
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:33,990
Everybody.

741
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:54,381
You look so very at home sitting there.

742
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,527
I am at home, Dad.

743
00:51:55,632 --> 00:51:57,038
But you know I can't stay here forever.

744
00:51:57,135 --> 00:51:58,793
Classes and a life, you know.

745
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:00,325
Yes, I know.

746
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:01,642
I made some eggs and bacon for you

747
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,637
over there on the counter.

748
00:52:02,736 --> 00:52:04,143
Thank you. I saw that.

749
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:06,181
I'm just saying it's nice
to see you here; that's all.

750
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:07,497
And I'm sure you feel safer here.

751
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:08,646
Yes, I feel safe.

752
00:52:10,863 --> 00:52:11,943
More coffee?

753
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:13,192
Mm-hmm.

754
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:20,040
Whoa.

755
00:52:21,327 --> 00:52:22,603
- Check this out.
- Well, I would.

756
00:52:22,702 --> 00:52:24,295
You have to make the screen
a little larger.

757
00:52:24,398 --> 00:52:25,609
I'm 107.

758
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,815
All right, let me zoom in.

759
00:52:27,918 --> 00:52:28,965
Holy shit.

760
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,596
Choice therapy?

761
00:52:30,702 --> 00:52:34,444
- Milburn.
- Milburn.

762
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:36,614
You just kicked the police's ass
with your laptop.

763
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:37,666
Is that how it works?

764
00:52:37,774 --> 00:52:39,813
Guess where I get it from.

765
00:52:39,918 --> 00:52:42,307
Well, everyone knows that.

766
00:52:46,733 --> 00:52:48,228
Come on. Let's go.

767
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:49,260
I'm gonna be late.

768
00:52:49,357 --> 00:52:50,601
Wait a minute. What?

769
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,359
I emailed Benson.
He's digging up an address.

770
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,508
He's gonna call us on the cell.

771
00:52:53,613 --> 00:52:56,199
You said "we." There can be no "we."

772
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,089
Well, you can leave me here

773
00:52:58,189 --> 00:53:00,196
and keep guessing what I'm up to,

774
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,115
or you can take me with you
and know for yourself.

775
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:04,161
Yeah, fine. Go ahead.

776
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:06,091
Get in the shower.

777
00:53:56,265 --> 00:53:57,759
Just for now, okay?

778
00:53:57,866 --> 00:53:58,848
Stay in the car.

779
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:01,860
Seriously?

780
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:06,568
Hi-dee-ho.

781
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:08,705
Come on out.

782
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:09,824
Scared me.

783
00:54:09,929 --> 00:54:11,238
Oh, sorry.

784
00:54:11,337 --> 00:54:12,351
That's okay.

785
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,984
Dr. Ronald Pendleton.

786
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:15,682
You already knew that.

787
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,246
Nice to meet you, sir.

788
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:18,879
You too.

789
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:22,694
This-a-way we go.

790
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,701
- Just try not to--
- Okay.

791
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:28,929
Of course, this is in regards
to your work at Milburn.

792
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,112
We've drawn a connection

793
00:54:30,216 --> 00:54:33,990
and hoping that someone
might come to mind,

794
00:54:34,088 --> 00:54:35,779
which is why we've come here,

795
00:54:35,879 --> 00:54:38,727
hoping you could narrow the field.

796
00:54:42,663 --> 00:54:45,511
Could be any one of these candidates.

797
00:54:45,607 --> 00:54:50,429
So the rumors, the abuse, was true.

798
00:54:50,535 --> 00:54:55,139
The facts say yes, but the state?

799
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:56,897
No, ma'am.

800
00:54:56,998 --> 00:54:59,715
Right, sir, but if you
could answer the question--

801
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:05,117
Oh, I propose that even if
you left here today with a name,

802
00:55:05,223 --> 00:55:06,532
you're no better off.

803
00:55:06,631 --> 00:55:08,769
And I propose you underestimate me.

804
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:14,084
I'm water. You're the horse.

805
00:55:14,182 --> 00:55:15,359
He brought you to me.

806
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:18,723
The books? Milburn?

807
00:55:18,821 --> 00:55:19,966
He knows you're here.

808
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,917
He wants you to be here.

809
00:55:23,013 --> 00:55:26,362
Under his terms, not yours.

810
00:55:26,469 --> 00:55:27,996
And it's safe to say your choice therapy

811
00:55:28,101 --> 00:55:30,109
wasn't exactly a cure-all
for one particular boy.

812
00:55:30,213 --> 00:55:34,075
Hey, I never said it was therapy.

813
00:55:34,181 --> 00:55:38,785
And I never, ever said that
it was any kind of a cure-all.

814
00:55:38,884 --> 00:55:40,892
It was more like a barometer

815
00:55:40,997 --> 00:55:44,739
about how the choices
that we make define us.

816
00:55:45,381 --> 00:55:50,202
What better way to understand
how the mind works

817
00:55:50,308 --> 00:55:55,774
than by analyzing
the most difficult choices

818
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:59,650
we have to make?

819
00:55:59,747 --> 00:56:01,657
He chose you.

820
00:56:01,764 --> 00:56:03,903
That's interesting.

821
00:56:04,003 --> 00:56:05,247
So far that I can see,

822
00:56:05,348 --> 00:56:09,210
you're holding up
your part of the bargain.

823
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:10,657
That's also interesting.

824
00:56:10,756 --> 00:56:13,538
Most people would have cut tail
and run by now.

825
00:56:13,635 --> 00:56:16,221
But not you.

826
00:56:16,323 --> 00:56:20,578
And he knows that.

827
00:56:20,674 --> 00:56:23,991
And I'll tell you something, detective.

828
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:27,229
He's gonna catch you,

829
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:31,607
and he's gonna catch you
way before you ever catch him.

830
00:56:43,009 --> 00:56:45,114
You believe this guy?

831
00:56:51,649 --> 00:56:54,496
There you are.

832
00:56:54,593 --> 00:57:01,368
All you have to do is very
carefully look at the tapes.

833
00:57:01,473 --> 00:57:03,033
And you know what?

834
00:57:03,137 --> 00:57:08,636
He's gonna jump off that tape
and tell you exactly who he is.

835
00:57:08,736 --> 00:57:14,006
And there is no way
that you will ever stop him.

836
00:57:14,113 --> 00:57:16,982
Thank you, sir.

837
00:57:20,448 --> 00:57:21,691
Take care.

838
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:23,101
Be careful.

839
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,115
And you, sir?

840
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:32,030
Be warned.

841
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,109
The choice is now

842
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:40,760
snap her neck and leave immediately,

843
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:45,881
or stay here for another ten years.

844
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,284
What's your answer now?

845
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,756
I'd kill you before I'd kill this dog,

846
00:57:49,854 --> 00:57:53,432
you sick old fuck.

847
00:57:53,534 --> 00:57:55,356
I'm gonna reach over
and break your neck.

848
00:57:55,454 --> 00:57:57,843
Do I get the money then
or just another ten years?

849
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,095
- That'll be all.
- Fuck you.

850
00:57:59,198 --> 00:58:01,270
See, this kid I like.

851
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:03,227
That's done.

852
00:58:03,325 --> 00:58:06,140
Here's the last one.

853
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:09,044
Yeah, I like her.

854
00:58:09,149 --> 00:58:11,418
Let me ask you a question.

855
00:58:11,517 --> 00:58:17,016
If I were to offer you $1,000
to snap her neck, would you?

856
00:58:17,117 --> 00:58:19,125
No.

857
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,171
Are you sure?

858
00:58:21,277 --> 00:58:23,698
I wouldn't hurt Molly. Would I, girl?

859
00:58:23,805 --> 00:58:27,547
Just 'cause I'm in here doesn't
make me what you think I am.

860
00:58:27,644 --> 00:58:31,670
Let's make it $10,000.

861
00:58:31,772 --> 00:58:33,081
You're playing a game.

862
00:58:33,181 --> 00:58:34,195
I get it.

863
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,689
A simple choice. Yes or no?

864
00:58:39,612 --> 00:58:41,499
No, I wouldn't.

865
00:58:41,596 --> 00:58:43,221
What if I informed you

866
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:46,106
that she was scheduled
to be put down anyway

867
00:58:46,204 --> 00:58:48,146
later this afternoon at the pound?

868
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:50,161
Nothing you can do to stop it.

869
00:58:50,267 --> 00:58:53,169
Then would you take the $10,000?

870
00:58:53,275 --> 00:58:54,934
No, I'm not a monster.

871
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:57,369
$100,000?

872
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,606
I said no. Now leave me alone.

873
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:02,871
The choice is now.

874
00:59:02,971 --> 00:59:06,713
Snap her neck and leave immediately,

875
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:11,350
or stay here for another ten years.

876
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,101
Please choose.

877
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,075
What have you done?

878
00:59:21,178 --> 00:59:22,836
My God! Jesus, stop the tape!

879
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:23,985
So I guess I'm free to go.

880
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:27,668
Stop the tape!

881
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:29,362
Holy shit. What's that kid's name?

882
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:32,215
Yeah, what is that kid's name?

883
00:59:32,313 --> 00:59:35,629
Uh, Nathan Jones.

884
00:59:35,737 --> 00:59:37,777
Nathan Jones?

885
00:59:40,569 --> 00:59:42,903
All right, adopted when he was
two months old.

886
00:59:43,001 --> 00:59:45,456
The adopted parents returned
the kid to child services

887
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:46,706
when he was three years old.

888
00:59:46,808 --> 00:59:49,263
Mentally unstable. Destructive.

889
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:50,896
How destructive can you be at three?

890
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,389
I guess destructive enough
for the state to take him back.

891
00:59:53,496 --> 00:59:55,351
It's pretty goddamn destructive
for that to happen,

892
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:56,463
don't you think, boss?

893
00:59:56,568 --> 00:59:57,997
Yeah, I never heard of that happening.

894
00:59:58,104 --> 01:00:00,243
Does it say anything else about
what happens to the kid next?

895
01:00:00,344 --> 01:00:01,718
Yeah, let me see.

896
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:03,190
After several years in an orphanage,

897
01:00:03,288 --> 01:00:04,946
he was finally placed in foster care.

898
01:00:05,047 --> 01:00:06,258
And get this.

899
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:09,010
His foster dad was
Simon Campbell, the musician.

900
01:00:09,112 --> 01:00:11,665
It says here that there are
allegations of sexual abuse.

901
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:14,614
It was five months before he was
moved out of Campbell's care.

902
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:16,205
Oh, Jesus.

903
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:17,555
And then he was placed in the home

904
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,924
of Martin and Melinda Marlow.

905
01:00:20,023 --> 01:00:21,998
He lived with the Marlows
for only two years

906
01:00:22,103 --> 01:00:25,300
before their daughter Jenna
accused him of rape.

907
01:00:25,398 --> 01:00:26,827
Charges were never proven.

908
01:00:26,935 --> 01:00:29,684
And Nathan was removed from their home.

909
01:00:29,783 --> 01:00:31,244
Shit.

910
01:00:31,351 --> 01:00:32,299
Then he entered Milburn.

911
01:00:32,407 --> 01:00:34,992
That's when the real shit started.

912
01:00:35,095 --> 01:00:36,688
Hey, boss. We got an address.

913
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,637
Let's go right now.

914
01:00:39,734 --> 01:00:41,196
No, no, no, not you.
Where are you going?

915
01:00:41,302 --> 01:00:42,644
You stay here, okay?

916
01:00:42,742 --> 01:00:44,367
You've done good work,
so keep following it.

917
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:45,779
Alice can help you.

918
01:00:45,878 --> 01:00:47,121
Alice, you'll make sure she stays?

919
01:00:47,222 --> 01:00:48,913
For my peace of mind.

920
01:00:49,014 --> 01:00:50,028
Okay.

921
01:00:50,134 --> 01:00:52,686
Just stay.

922
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:12,653
Oh, my God. What took you so long?

923
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:14,317
Ever since the power
went out last night,

924
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,046
it stinks to high heaven in there.

925
01:01:16,148 --> 01:01:17,839
It's absolutely disgusting, right?

926
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,347
It's disgusting in there.

927
01:01:19,444 --> 01:01:20,753
- Please.
- We got it.

928
01:01:20,852 --> 01:01:23,562
- Did you call the power company?
- Stay back.

929
01:01:23,668 --> 01:01:26,285
- Everybody's disgusted with the smell.
- Stay back.

930
01:01:37,299 --> 01:01:40,233
Okay, boys, break it down.

931
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:41,419
Ready?

932
01:01:45,267 --> 01:01:46,282
Police, open up!

933
01:01:46,387 --> 01:01:49,235
Hey, police!

934
01:02:07,794 --> 01:02:08,688
All right.

935
01:02:08,786 --> 01:02:12,397
Uniforms, I want you to file through.

936
01:02:12,498 --> 01:02:14,156
- Watch your step.
- Yes, sir.

937
01:02:16,082 --> 01:02:17,096
It smells like shit in here.

938
01:02:17,202 --> 01:02:19,722
Quiet, quiet, shh.

939
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:28,331
Jesus, I can't take the stench.

940
01:02:32,337 --> 01:02:33,547
Ugh.

941
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:34,793
Oh, fuck me.

942
01:02:34,896 --> 01:02:37,711
I don't even want to know
what that shit is.

943
01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:39,369
Fuck me.

944
01:02:46,511 --> 01:02:49,381
Ken, check the back.

945
01:02:56,175 --> 01:02:59,404
Holy Christ.

946
01:02:59,503 --> 01:03:01,804
Get forensics here right away.

947
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,910
Jesus.

948
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:04,963
Find Wagner.

949
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:06,019
Get him down here.

950
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:08,909
He's got to see this.

951
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:19,723
Chief?

952
01:03:19,822 --> 01:03:20,804
Yeah.

953
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:23,398
You better come take a look at this.

954
01:03:23,502 --> 01:03:24,778
Worse than in here?

955
01:03:24,878 --> 01:03:27,245
A little bit.

956
01:03:29,646 --> 01:03:31,468
You all right?

957
01:03:31,566 --> 01:03:32,514
No.

958
01:04:37,355 --> 01:04:39,143
ISO_17.

959
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:41,315
Isolation room 17?

960
01:04:56,298 --> 01:04:57,705
This thing caused the fuse

961
01:04:57,802 --> 01:04:59,656
to blow the mains
on the entire building.

962
01:04:59,753 --> 01:05:00,963
Mm-hmm.

963
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,658
Which in turn shut off
these air fresheners

964
01:05:02,761 --> 01:05:04,103
designed to mask the stench.

965
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:06,175
We found his dog locked up
in his bathroom over there.

966
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:08,168
Dog by the name of Molly?

967
01:05:08,265 --> 01:05:09,378
Yeah.

968
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:13,278
I can't even describe that next part.

969
01:05:13,384 --> 01:05:14,945
Jesus, who the fuck is that?

970
01:05:15,049 --> 01:05:17,700
That is who we believe
is Dr. Ronald Pendleton.

971
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,207
We found his ID under the tub.

972
01:05:19,304 --> 01:05:21,060
Forensics is running a check on it.

973
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:22,884
I think you're gonna find
the next revelation

974
01:05:22,984 --> 01:05:24,228
a little more disturbing.

975
01:05:24,328 --> 01:05:25,189
Yeah? Why's that?

976
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,263
I'll show you.

977
01:05:30,216 --> 01:05:33,990
From the looks of it, you were next.

978
01:05:52,711 --> 01:05:53,954
Jesus.

979
01:06:02,822 --> 01:06:04,284
Hey, you've reached Fiona.

980
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:05,601
Please leave a message.

981
01:06:05,702 --> 01:06:06,684
Fiona, Dad.

982
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,895
Listen, I have some news.

983
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,176
I need to talk to you.

984
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:12,033
You got to call me back
as soon as you get this.

985
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,403
All right, bye.

986
01:06:14,502 --> 01:06:15,582
Yeah, I still can't reach her.

987
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:19,646
So, boss, listen.

988
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,611
What if this guy--

989
01:06:21,861 --> 01:06:22,810
Hey, boss.

990
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:58,109
Hello?

991
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:01,078
Anybody here?

992
01:08:27,648 --> 01:08:29,174
Hello?

993
01:09:23,644 --> 01:09:25,532
Oh.

994
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,378
Open the door!

995
01:10:04,474 --> 01:10:05,456
Hello, Fiona.

996
01:10:05,563 --> 01:10:07,286
Let me out of here!

997
01:10:07,386 --> 01:10:11,128
Welcome to a special place
for bad little children.

998
01:10:11,226 --> 01:10:15,416
Don't be overly concerned
with Milburn's date rape drug.

999
01:10:15,514 --> 01:10:16,976
Open this door!

1000
01:10:17,082 --> 01:10:20,399
It's a harmless little gas
that will knock you right out.

1001
01:10:20,506 --> 01:10:22,808
See you when you wake up.

1002
01:11:21,943 --> 01:11:23,918
Look who's awake.

1003
01:11:30,422 --> 01:11:35,921
Your father made our mother choose.

1004
01:11:36,022 --> 01:11:38,804
Your father, our mother.

1005
01:11:38,902 --> 01:11:40,309
Do you get it?

1006
01:11:40,406 --> 01:11:42,129
I don't understand.

1007
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:45,841
When your father Tom
was away at the academy,

1008
01:11:45,942 --> 01:11:47,829
she met my dad.

1009
01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:49,965
I was conceived right here in this room.

1010
01:11:51,702 --> 01:11:56,208
Tom said he wouldn't raise
another man's child.

1011
01:11:56,309 --> 01:12:00,270
He made her choose.

1012
01:12:00,373 --> 01:12:05,009
You weren't even born yet,
and she chose you over me.

1013
01:12:05,108 --> 01:12:07,410
She told me it was the hardest choice

1014
01:12:07,509 --> 01:12:10,323
she ever had to make.

1015
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,875
But I gave her one that was even harder,

1016
01:12:12,981 --> 01:12:16,242
and she made the ultimate sacrifice

1017
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,445
for you, Fiona.

1018
01:12:18,548 --> 01:12:21,646
She chose to die so you could live.

1019
01:12:21,748 --> 01:12:23,471
You killed her.

1020
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:25,426
You killed her and made it
look like a suicide.

1021
01:12:25,523 --> 01:12:26,384
No.

1022
01:12:26,483 --> 01:12:28,044
I gave her a choice.

1023
01:12:28,147 --> 01:12:29,838
She killed herself.

1024
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:33,420
It can't be.

1025
01:12:33,523 --> 01:12:35,498
You should feel special, Fiona.

1026
01:12:35,603 --> 01:12:37,610
No one ever did that for me.

1027
01:12:37,715 --> 01:12:41,609
Why are you doing this to me, Nathan?

1028
01:12:41,715 --> 01:12:43,373
Look, I understand why you're angry.

1029
01:12:43,475 --> 01:12:44,489
You have every right to be.

1030
01:12:44,595 --> 01:12:46,122
But why am I here?

1031
01:12:56,498 --> 01:13:00,524
You think I'm ugly, don't you?

1032
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,081
I'm not as pretty as you.

1033
01:13:03,186 --> 01:13:06,633
It's no wonder she chose you.

1034
01:13:06,738 --> 01:13:09,159
Three years ago,

1035
01:13:09,266 --> 01:13:11,273
after our mother died,

1036
01:13:11,378 --> 01:13:16,199
I put a gun in my mouth,
and I pulled the trigger.

1037
01:13:16,305 --> 01:13:21,094
When I woke up, I looked like this.

1038
01:13:21,201 --> 01:13:23,273
Pendleton was right.

1039
01:13:23,377 --> 01:13:25,798
Our choices define us.

1040
01:13:34,736 --> 01:13:35,848
Dad.

1041
01:13:35,952 --> 01:13:37,512
Didn't you ever wonder
why he was so quick

1042
01:13:37,616 --> 01:13:39,623
to put her in the grave
and forget the whole thing?

1043
01:13:39,728 --> 01:13:40,677
Dad, can you hear me?

1044
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:41,962
It must have been pretty painful

1045
01:13:42,064 --> 01:13:43,492
that this is where she had
to end her life.

1046
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,582
Dad, Dad!

1047
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:45,931
I wanted you to know the truth.

1048
01:13:46,032 --> 01:13:48,104
I wanted you to hear it from him.

1049
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:49,637
Dad, can you hear me?

1050
01:13:49,743 --> 01:13:51,565
Go ahead and ask him.

1051
01:13:51,663 --> 01:13:53,518
Ask him, Fiona.

1052
01:13:53,616 --> 01:13:55,503
Go ahead, ask him!

1053
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:57,093
Ask him!

1054
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,021
Ask him what he did!

1055
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:08,869
Is it true?

1056
01:14:08,975 --> 01:14:12,652
Was there a baby before I was born?

1057
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:16,838
You know I love you more than anything.

1058
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,379
Nathan, stop!

1059
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:30,570
Nathan, I'm begging you, please!

1060
01:14:30,669 --> 01:14:34,597
Look at me, Nathan!

1061
01:14:34,702 --> 01:14:36,109
Nathan!

1062
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:40,618
Nathan, please!

1063
01:14:40,717 --> 01:14:41,610
Nathan, stop!

1064
01:14:45,997 --> 01:14:48,331
Nathan, please!

1065
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,035
No, no, no, no!

1066
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,752
No, no, no, Dad.

1067
01:14:59,852 --> 01:15:00,900
Come on, it's okay.

1068
01:15:01,004 --> 01:15:02,313
Breathe.

1069
01:15:02,412 --> 01:15:03,906
No, no.

1070
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:06,183
No, no, no.

1071
01:15:06,283 --> 01:15:09,317
No, no.

1072
01:15:13,196 --> 01:15:15,203
No, come on, no!

1073
01:15:15,307 --> 01:15:18,209
No!

1074
01:15:41,386 --> 01:15:44,452
thud!

1075
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:26,880
Hey, lady, you okay?

1076
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:29,534
You need some help?

1077
01:17:36,421 --> 01:17:38,111
I forgot to tell you

1078
01:17:38,212 --> 01:17:40,994
how much you remind me of your mother.

1079
01:17:48,692 --> 01:17:57,754
