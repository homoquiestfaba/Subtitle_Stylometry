1
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:05,020
Open the register.

2
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,900
Shut up, open the fucking register!

3
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:12,872
Shut up.

4
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,979
Hey you. Get over here.

5
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,900
Your wallet. Throw it on the floor.

6
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:30,266
- Come on!
- Come on, come on!

904
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,780
- Here!

7
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:37,988
In the bag! Put it in a fucking bag! 

8
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:42,048
- Paper or plastic?
- Plastic.

9
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:46,659
Hey hey you, get back here.

10
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,415
Look, lady, I don't give a shit what you're doing here, okay

11
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:54,332
Do what you got ta do, just leave me out of it.

12
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,054
What'd you say?

13
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,604
You think I'm a lady?

14
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:03,097
- Aren't you?
- You think i won't shoot you in the face, huh?

15
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:04,812
I hope not.

16
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,846
Drop that stuff.

17
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,566
- What?
- That shit in your hand - drop it.

18
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,184
Look, this is the last bottle, I need this.

19
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:17,079
Drop it.

20
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:21,648
- I've got a bleeding foot.
- I've got a fucking gun.

21
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:26,692
Whoo - Who's gonna pay for that?

22
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,497
Give me my wallet.

23
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,846
<i> ... assault and robbery, </i>

24
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:50,922
33 year old caucasian, broke the window
behind me during his exit.

25
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,700
Police are releasing security camera footages from..

26
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:55,051
Hold it asshole!

27
00:04:57,594 --> 00:05:00,442
Drop the gun.
Drop the gun!

28
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:02,999
- Drop it right now!
- Okay.

29
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,437
You wanna fuck with me, huh? 
You want to fuck with me!

30
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:08,088
Get out of my store!
Get out!

31
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:16,926
- Hey - Get off my car!
- What car?

32
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,560
The one you're sitting on.

33
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,420
I thought this was a toilet.

34
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:33,817
At this stage, police estimated
a take of $300,000.

35
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:38,508
Taylor, a 33 years old caucasian, is said to be driving
an maroon 1980's model Buick

00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:41,646
license plate K-R-S-4-2-7.

37
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:44,836
Police asks anyone who identify
Taylor or his vehicle..

38
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:47,186
To contact their local authorities.

THE PERFECT HOST
Subtitle by: green_towel

42
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,311
Hello?

43
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:59,004
Hi, I'm so sorry to disturb you.

44
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:01,119
I'm new to LA, and I..

45
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,649
..was on my way to see a buddy of mine 
whom I'll be staying with..

46
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:11,583
..and I was just mugged. They took my
phone, my wallet, and I was actually injured in the process.

47
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:17,223
I saw your sign of Jehova in your window 
and I was just wondering if I could possibly come in..

48
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:23,211
..and use your phone and just kind of collect myself.
I know what this must look like.

49
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,568
You follow Jehova then?

50
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:30,786
Yes yes, and you can imagine how pleased I was
when I saw an insignia in your window.

51
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:33,478
But you don't wear the cross?

52
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:38,307
No, unfortunately it was ripped from my neck
during the mugging.

53
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,357
Perhaps you'll receive another next Christmas.

54
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:45,454
I don't understand, I'm a Christian?

55
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:49,295
You may well be, 
but you certainly don't follow Jehovah.

56
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:53,263
We don't celebrate Christmas and we certainly 
don't acknowledge the cross. Wolf.

57
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:26,096
Dear Warwick, Here in sunny
Sidney, loving it..

58
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,118
Love, JuliaXX.

59
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:08,711
Yes?

60
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,092
Ah yes, is this Warwick?

61
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:13,165 
Warwick, yes.
Who is this?

62
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,773
Hi Warwick, It's John,
I'm a friend of Julia.

63
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:18,632
She's not here right now.

64
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:21,958
Yeah, I know, I actually just left her in Sydney.

65
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:24,436
Oh, really?

66
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,022
Wha.. What I can do for you?

67
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,268
Well, I'm in a bit of a bide actually, erk..

68
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,992
I just arrived back in the country, 
and the airport lost my luggage

69
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,224
and on top of everything else I was mugged.

70
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,937
Oh my God.

71
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:45,265
Yeah yeah and I planned on staying with
my cousin and now nobody's home.

72
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:47,299
Yes...?

73
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,826
Well, look, I wouldn't normally do
something like this, but ...

74
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,300
... you know, but Julia just kept on and on 
about what a great person you are,

75
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:59,372
and I was gonna call you anyway, so
I just sort of thought that ...

76
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:09,000
Umm.. I just thought that maybe I could come in
and make some other arrangements.

77
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,303
You, you're sort of my last resort.

78
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:18,316
Look, I.. I like to help you out, but ...
I'm expecting people for dinner.

79
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:22,640
You, you'd really.. You'd going to do me
a big favor.

80
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:24,903
I'm sorry.

81
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:28,300
Okay, no hard feelings.
Maybe another time.

82
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:43,621
- John?
- Yes.

83
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,986
I'm sorry, Julia would never forgive me.
Of course you can come in.

84
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:52,455
- You must be exhausted. Hi, I'm Warwick.
- John.

85
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:02,559
Can I get you something to drink?
Mineral water? Wine?

86
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:05,283
Yeah, some wine would be great.

87
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:08,380
- Red or white?
- Red.

88
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,181
Thank you.

89
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:43,248
Here you go.

90
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,578
Thank you.

91
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,273
- Great place.
- Thank you.

92
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:50,577
Please have a seat.

93
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:51,978
Okay, thanks.

94
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:60,294
- So how was Australia.
- Oh, it's great, yeah.

95
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:06,642
It's really beautiful you know. Beaches were amazing,
I wish I could've stayed longer.

96
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,238
Travel. One of life real pleasures.

907
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,238
Yeah it is, isn't it, yeah.

97
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:17,000
So,what do you do when you're
not traveling?

98
00:12:17 ,190 --> 00:12:20,689
Ah, I double this and that, you know.

99
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:23,806
I don't feel like I really value much you calling it.

100
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,967
We all have so many choices
these days, don't we?

101
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:34,966
So? How's Julia?

102
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:38,803
She's good. Yeah. Really really good.

103
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:40,600
How's she feeling about going back to
to work?

104
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:44,396
- Fine, fine.
- That's surprising.

105
00:12:45,115 --> 00:12:47,312
Last time we talk, she was thinking
about leaving.

106
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:50,778
You know, she isn't really talk about it
that much, so I don't know.

107
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,039
Well, who can blame her, I couldn't do
that kind of work. Could you?

108
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,290
No, no I couldn't.

109
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:01,517
Listen, I need to keep an eye on dinner.
Do you wanna ...?

110
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:02,668
Oh, yeah sure.

111
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:13,820
- So, have you lived here long?
- A while.

112
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:26,385
Do you live alone?

113
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:31,723
I do.

114
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,367
Guess you'll be needing the phone.

115
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,602
You said you had to make arrangements.

116
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,664
Thank you.

117
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,959
It's me.
I'll call you back.

118
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,408
- No luck?
- No.

119
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:11,730
- Carrot?
- Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

120
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:16,695
I hate to ask this, is there any way i could hang out
another half hour or so..

121
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:18,778
..I think my cousin should be home by then.

122
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,988
I know I'm putting you out, I'm so sorry.
It's just been one of those days.

123
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:26,861
Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. Just sit down, relax,
We'll sort this out.

124
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:32,370
Tell you what, I'll call the airport.
We'll see if we can locate your luggage.

125
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,681
Oh, I wou..I wouldn't worry about that .

126
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:38,430
I left the airport all my cousin's information.
and they said they would call him, so..

127
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:42,230
- Your cousin isn't home, is he?
- She.

128
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:43,394
She's not home.

129
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:47,287
Listen, if you don't stand on top of these people,
you'll be the last one to receive anything.

130
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,603
- What airline were you on?
- Qantas.

131
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,265
Can you give me Qantas lost luggage at LAX, please.

132
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:04,911
Yes, hello. I'm checking on some luggage.
Hang on.

133
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:12,005
- Do you have the baggage's receipt?
- No, it was in my wallet - stolen.

134
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:14,753
No, he doesn't.
What's your last name?

135
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:16,042
Jones.

136
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,649
John Jones?

137
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,197
My parents..

138
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:23,645
- It's Jones.
- Not very creative.

139
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:25,906
Yes, from Sydney.

140
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:29,741
Sure.

141
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:37,223
I see.
They don't have anything out of Jones.

142
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:39,675
What's it look like?

143
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:42,120
- What?
- Your luggage, describe it for me.

144
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:43,298
Hang on a second.

145
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:47,466
A black bag, mid size, had a little red ribbon
tied on the handle.

146
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:50,202
Okay, if I describe the luggage, will that ...

147
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:55,834
And when will he be back?

148
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,398
- This person obviously doesn't want to deal with me.
- Don't worry about it, just hang up.

149
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,399
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

150
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,106
He says his supervisor will be back in
an hour, you sure your cousin will be home?

151
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,239
I don't, I don't even know, she's not expecting me,
I was gonna surprise her.

152
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:12,062
This is becoming far too difficult.

153
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,920
What if you stay for dinner?

154
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,545
We can call the supervisor
in an hour or so. What do you think?

155
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,020
I think that's a great idea. Thank you.

156
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:26,380
Okay, look, I'll call you back.
Okay. Thank you. Yes.

157
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,685
Well, that's all settled.

158
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,509
Now, I need to get ready,
You make yourself at home.

159
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:36,092
There's more wine in the kitchen if you like.
And, I won't be a moment.

160
00:17:15,674 --> 00:17:18,374
- John?
- Yeah.

161
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:23,687
Tell me, I have to know everything that you and
Julia did in Sydney.

162
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:25,219
Don't leave out any details.

163
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,102
Ah, we just sorta hung out.

164
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:30,033
How did you meet?

165
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:32,232
Through a mutual friend.

166
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,271
I met her at a birthday party.

167
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:41,636
- But you've spent some time together.
- Yeah, it was just.. It's more toward the end of the trip.

168
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:45,269
Look, I wished I could've hung out with her longer, you know.
She's such a sweet girl.

169
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,109
And, she suggested you visit me?

170
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,966
- Yeah, she actually thought we'd get along.
- That is so Julia.

171
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:57,260
- But strange too.
- What is?

172
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:59,692
I spoke to her few days ago, she didn't mention you.

173
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:04,354
Very strange, maybe she's just forgot.

174
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:08,781
Oh, that unlikely, she used to
tell me everything. It's just odd she didn't..

175
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:11,381
..mention you at all.

176
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,801
I hope she mention me
the next time you guys talk.

177
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:19,987
You know, you're right, let's give her a call.

178
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:22,228
I'll get the phone.

179
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:25,651
I'm sure Julia would love to know 
we're both here together.

180
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:36,655
I think it's about 9 o'clock in the morning, Sydney time.
She should be up.

181
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,523
You know what? I think she's been doing
yoga on Wednesdays.

182
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:44,485
I don't.. I don't even know if she'll be there.

183
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:49,852
But it's not Wednesday. It's Wednesday here, 
but it's Thursday morning over there, right?

184
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:54,120
You're right. Of course it is, they're 
a day ahead of us.

185
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,221
It's Thursday.

186
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:01,851
It's ringing.

187
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,351
Answering machine.

188
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:16,240
Hi Jule, It's me, I'm here with John.

189
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:19,301
Who waves hello. Yes. He had a nightmare journey.

190
00:19:19,302 --> 00:19:23,798
I wish you had told me he was coming.
I could've prepare it. Anyway..

191
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:26,739
..I hope you're well, give me a call
when you can. Bye.

192
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:31,570
She must still be asleep.
Listen, I've gotta keep cooking.

193
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:34,862
Make yourself comfortable.
My guests should be here soon.

194
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:36,486
- You okay?
- I'm good.

195
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,589
- Where's your restroom?
- Oh, it's down here, come here.

196
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,815
It's right down the hall, second door
on the left.

197
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,966
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

198
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:49,809
What's wrong? You're limping.

199
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:53,447
Ah, I sprained my ankle. And, it's still
look kinda healing.

200
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh no, sprained ankle.
That's no good, John.

201
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:59,949
You weren't drunk, were you, John?

202
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,490
Come on, admit it.

203
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:07,155
I've been watching you (?) into the
red tonight.

204
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:10,838
I'm one of the white man myself.

205
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:16,305
Red a bit heavy for my constitution.
A bit too rustic.

206
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:17,933
Plus, it stained the teeth.

207
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,312
Have you ever been to Romania?

208
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:27,331
Romania drink a lot of red wine. They all
have red teeth. 

209
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,820
Or maybe they eat a lot of red meat,
I don't know, but got red teeth

210
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:35,510
That's the Romanians.

211
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:45,652
Magnificent.

212
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,791
So, who else coming tonight?

213
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,917
Some old friends.

214
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,644
What do they do?

215
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:17,015
Well, one is an artist, a journalist,
a lawyer.

216
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:18,266
A lawyer?

217
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,265
Yes. Roman.
Brilliant.

218
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:24,216
I keep telling him, he should change
sides, start his own practice..

219
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:27,627
..it'll make more money, but he won't do it.
He's got principles.

220
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:34,087
So what is he? A tax attorney?

221
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:38,683
God, no. He's a prosecutor. He works for
the District Attorney's Office.

222
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,640
Very talented.

223
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,480
You've planned a really nice dinner.

224
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:51,152
And, I.. I'm exhausted.
I think I'm gonna go.

225
00:21:51,494 --> 00:21:53,168
I'm just, I'm so tired.

226
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,922
Yeah, and I think my cousin should be
home now.

227
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:59,410
No, no. Don't be ridiculous.
I can't send you out there homeless.

228
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:01,718
Oh, there's somebody at home. I just don't want to ruin your dinner.

229
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:05,380
I'm exhausted. I'm tired. Look, I'm no way near interesting
as the guests you're gonna be having.

906
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:05,779
I'm gonna go.

230
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:09,859
No, sit down, sit down. Listen.
This is an informal dinner.

231
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,229
Little wine, relax conversation,
you don't have to do a thing.

232
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:15,578
My guests are very amusing.

233
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:18,533
Trust me.
You'll be captivated.

234
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:19,684
Really.

235
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:27,367
So, what time.. what time everything getting started.

236
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:31,092
Well, it suppose to be at 8, but as
usual, they're probably be late.

237
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:33,499
<i> ...an arm robbery took place including a
$300,000..</i>

238
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:,36,501
That's not really difficult to be punctual.

238
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,001
Set your watch towards it, make lists.

241
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,404
It's not that difficult.

242
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,246
Warwick, could you be quiet
for just one second, please?

243
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:45,516
It's planning. Plain and simple.

244
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,403
Time management.

245
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:50,024
-It's..
-Shut the fuck up!

246
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:52,838
I beg your pardon?

247
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:58,096
Look, you might be a friend of Julia,
but I won't be spoken to that way.

248
00:22:58,097 --> 00:22:59,506
I think maybe you better leave.

249
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,366
There's your fucking Julia.

250
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:05,434
..still searching for a man probably responsible
for a daring bank robbery this afternoon..

251
00:23:05,435 --> 00:23:09,854
One of the bank employee identified the man as
Los Angeles resident, John Taylor.

252
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,877
Taylor walked into a suburban branch
of the first National,

253
00:23:12,878 --> 00:23:17,383
hold up the teller and walked away
with an estimated take of $300,000.

254
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:20,942
Taylor has prior convictions for both
assault and armed robbery.

255
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:24,052
He was last seen exiting
a convenient store in Silver Lake.

256
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:28,766
Police advices that Taylor is extremely
dangerous and should not be approached.

257
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,846
In other news, the Commissioner of police
corruption availed his plan..

258
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:37,914
Sit down.

259
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:41,364
Sit down!

260
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:16,239
I don't mind if you smoke.

261
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:25,158
Do you mind if I smoke?

262
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:38,356
You can't kill me, I'm having a dinner party.

263
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:48,446
I will cut your throat, put you
in the bathtub, I'll eat all your food..

264
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,709
and I'll sleep in your bed.

265
00:24:52,263 --> 00:24:53,469
Do you understand that?

266
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:01,201
I want you to get on the phone. I want you to
call your homo friends and tell them to fuck off.

267
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,177
Okay.

268
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:21,245
Hello Rupert, it's me. Yes, i know you're late but..

269
00:25:21,3  46 --> 00:25:23,907
It doesn't matter now, I have to cancel.

270
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,778
I have a.. I have a terrible migraine.

271
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,433
Yeah, could you call the
others and apologize for me?

272
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,456
Thanks. No, no. That's okay.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

273
00:25:48,326 --> 00:25:49,550
Good boy.

274
00:26:21,692 --> 00:26:22,915
Oh my God.

275
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:26,120
You.. You're bleeding.

276
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:33,890
I can take care of it .. No, no please please.
Let me just.. And some water.

277
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:45,028
Ohh, good.

278
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,840
What the fuck are you doing?

279
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,170
Cleaning up your nasty mess.

280
00:26:55,005 --> 00:26:57,196
I'm not fucking around, do you 
understand me?

281
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,590
Do you understand me?

282
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:21,180
- Any up-to-date?
- Oh, yeah.

283
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:25,246
You must be devastated.

284
00:27:27,257 --> 00:27:28,799
Yeah, but I'll get over it.

285
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,533
- Man, it was brutal.
- We're 5 games in those season.

286
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:35,795
I hope you didn't have any money on it.

287
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:38,832
That would be illegal.

288
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:41,222
Right.

289
00:27:41,738 --> 00:27:43,734
- What is that?
- Witness statements.

290
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:46,377
We have a lead witness, already?

291
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:49,455
Yeah, the bank teller. She's the one who ID'ed Taylor.

292
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:52,339
Says Taylor, come around those other occasions.

293
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:53,687
Really?

294
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:58,177
Taylor doesn't has an account, he just like the look
of her apparently.

295
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:01,685
He asked her out at least 3 times.

296
00:28:01,872 --> 00:28:05,439
He took her number and never called.
John stop coming around.

297
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,232
Until today.

298
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:10,222
It's his home phone number.

299
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:13,520
My feeling is, either he's an idiot or.. 

300
00:28:14,372 --> 00:28:17,964
the romantic angle was a cover to
case the bank.

301
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,707
Well, he's an idiot either way.

302
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,085
You don't give somebody your number
and then robbed them.

303
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,750
He did wear a wig and sunglasses.

304
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:32,337
That was cunning.

305
00:28:47,668 --> 00:28:48,904
Why'd you do it?

306
00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:52,961
Do what?

307
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:54,312
Steal.

308
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:58,173
Why not earn it honestly?

309
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,589
I doesn't matter to me. I.. I'm  just curios.

310
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:05,641
There's always a way to earn money.

311
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:07,647
Yeah?

312
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:13,023
What fuck do you know about everything?

313
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:15,424
I'm just saying, you know.

314
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,209
Stealing is not the answer.

315
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,757
Okay, here's how this gonna go.

316
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,547
I'm gonna kill you.

317
00:29:41,578 --> 00:29:43,287
That's the decison I've already made.

318
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:50,852
But if you're smart,
you might be able to change my mind.

319
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:55,912
For starters, you can keep your
ignore-ass opinions to yourself.

320
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:58,065
Because you don't fucking know me.

321
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:04,848
And also, you can follow my instructions,
and stay out of my way until morning.

322
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:06,654
You won't get hurt.

323
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:13,667
You just be my accommodations for the evening.

324
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:15,733
Okay?

325
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:26,515
Got it?

326
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:14,818
I told them I was preparing duck.

327
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:16,638
They knew tonigh was special.

328
00:31:16,986 --> 00:31:18,457
They should be here.

329
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:23,785
They're so unreliable.
I'm always on time for them.

330
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:25,045
I'm always on time.

331
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:30,174
I was start having extreme phone call.
Don't worry. We're running late.

332
00:31:30,174 --> 00:31:34,268
I'm so sorry, Warwick,
we're feeling tired, we can't make it.

333
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:44,869
It's a cheeky little drop, isn't it?

334
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:05,181
Well, Rupert and I have seen it twice.
I can't wait for them to be on DVD.

335
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,665
Why don't you see them?
Really, you have to go.

336
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:18,048
That's very good Rupert. You're quite the mimic.

337
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,313
John.

338
00:32:25,468 --> 00:32:27,976
- Excuse me.

339
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:38,725
Monica, how are doing there?
Excuse me, Rupert.

340
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,484
Sorry about that.

341
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:57,645
Everybody. Everybody.

342
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:02,487
This is our new friend, John.
Everybody say hello to John.

343
00:33:02,488 --> 00:33:03,732
Hello John.

344
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:07,519
You drifted off there for a moment.

345
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,371
- Are you alright?
- We were worried about you.

346
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:12,100
Yes, we were.

347
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:16,531
- Were what?
- Were worried about you.

348
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,358
Just fuck your hand off me, you freak!

349
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:21,717
Fuck you!

350
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:26,164
Manners.

351
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,805
You were hungry, Rupert.
Shovel it down you little piggy.

352
00:33:39,874 --> 00:33:41,105
So, Roman.

353
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,293
Frying any good cases recently?

354
00:33:43,294 --> 00:33:45,591
I'm sure John wil be interested in the judicial process.

355
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:47,309
You know I can't discuss that, Warwick.

356
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:48,941
It not ethical.

357
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:52,282
Oh, come on. It just us.
And these 4 walls.

358
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:55,461
Yes, now, that's very boring, Roman.

359
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:58,295
After all we have a
real criminal right here at our own table.

360
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:02,196
So, you're new to LA, are you John?

361
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:11,617
Yes, he just flying from Sydney, Australia.

362
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:15,747
- Good day, mate.
- Hey, Chelsea, Chelsea please.

363
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:16,873
Please control yourself.

364
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,419
Monica and I went to that Caravaggio 
exhibition, last week?

365
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,742
Oh, yes, how was it?

366
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,453
Amazing.

367
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:31,472
They only had a few pieces, but they fixed two
separate light sources to each painting.

369
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:35,092
One would fade, the other would come up.

370
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:39,094
Yes, it illuminated the paintings surreal - details, staggering.

371
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:40,759
I don't think I know Caravaggio.

372
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:42,452
You're kidding.

373
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:45,445
- When did he painted?
- Well, around 1600.

374
00:34:45,926 --> 00:34:47,611
It's quite an interesting character, actually.

375
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:50,129
He was legitimate and a murderer.

376
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:54,003
- Was he?
- Well, yes, yes. But fascinating, besides that ...

377
00:34:54,003 --> 00:34:56,629
He put most of today criminals a shame.

378
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,693
Sounds frightening.

379
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:01,602
I'm sure I have a book on him somewhere. Hang on.

380
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:02,803
I'll see if I can find it.

382
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:14,570
Here it is.

383
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:27,848
Oh, my god. Chelsea.

385
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:37,731
John. John!

386
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,764
Yes, I know, poor kitten. Here.

387
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:01,785
Are you going to apologize to Chelsea?

388
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,649
Excuse me?

389
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:07,326
You knocked her down and then you trampled her.

390
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:16,135
Well?

391
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:25,311
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

392
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:35,790
So John, what's new and interesting?

393
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:42,344
What's new is that I'm sitting here 
with a fucking lunatic.

394
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,963
Nothing interesting about that.

395
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:03,257
I've had darker days than this, Warwick.

396
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:31,369
Look at this.
You'll like this.

397
00:37:54,735 --> 00:37:56,330
This is midnight.

398
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,452
You know, Roman, I think I'm finally starting 
to capture your alikeness.

399
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:24,952
And the finale.

400
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:43,581
Don't be threat.
The place for you on every page.

401
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,485
Where's the history of this stuff?

402
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:11,430
- What do you mean? Like..
- For the month. Tapes from the whole month.

403
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:13,490
Whatever they had, we've got downstairs.

404
00:39:13,491 --> 00:39:17,500
Okay. Call the property room. Tell them to come in down.

406
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:41,716
You are the most beautiful creature I've ever laid eyes on.
You're exquisite.

407
00:39:41,717 --> 00:39:43,954
I'm sure you told all the girls that.

408
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:45,672
You're such a lady's man.

409
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:48,609
It's different with you. You're special.

410
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,849
How can I believe that?

411
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:58,297
That's true. There've been many women
traveled the road to Warwick,

412
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,446
Interesting road indeed.

413
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:04,552
I can't be blame.
For the love I've shared.

414
00:40:04,553 --> 00:40:08,113
I know, but what about Julia?

415
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:12,256
- She's in Australia.
- But you're with her, she is..

416
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:13,657
She is..

417
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,572
She is the ship of the night
A child of the loving universe,

418
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:23,938
My heart (?) pointed at you.

419
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,183
This time it's bridle. Come to Warwick.

420
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:33,631
Warwick.

421
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:37,466
This is extremely boring, Warwick,
there are other people here you know.

422
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,053
Oh, I forgotten myself.

423
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:43,141
Is everyone not enjoying themeselves?

424
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:48,247
I can't speak for everyone here, but
I'm having a great time.

425
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:52,218
Warwick, don't we have the
last party on Super 8?

426
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:56,212
You're right, we do.
I'll show it to you. I'll show it to you.

427
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,686
Oh, Roman, come here. Give me a hand with John.

428
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:04,056
Right, ready?
1, 2, 3.

429
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:16,072
I wish you'd been here for this, you missed
the kicking party.

430
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:36,383
I did my own hair
and makeup.

431
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:15,959
It's so beautiful.
It's so beautiful.

433
00:42:55,478 --> 00:42:56,668
Hey you.

434
00:42:57,223 --> 00:43:00,702
Everybody's here. Everybody's here.

435
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:03,768
Rupert, keep these people occupied.
Or I'll keep you occupied.

436
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,463
Hello, Chelsea.

437
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:12,676
Isn't this great?

438
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:15,671
I was worried they was gonna get going
but this is fucking great.

439
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:17,225
You're having a good time?

440
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:21,920
Oh, lighten up, John, it's a party.

441
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,967
Well, he doesn't look very happy.

442
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:27,772
Oh, he just need to get into the festive spirit.

443
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:30,296
Hey, Chelsea, Rupert, come here. Come here.

444
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,027
Ready?
1, 2, 3. Champagne!

445
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:03,598
Hey, John.

446
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:07,915
Oh, yeah.
Almost time, isn't it?

447
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:09,705
Hope you feeling photogenic.

448
00:44:12,413 --> 00:44:14,202
Warwick, can I join the conga line?

449
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:15,353
What?

450
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:20,044
Can I join the conga line?

451
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,959
I suppose we got a few more minutes.

452
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:29,716
But you have to drink a
cocktail if you want to be on time.

453
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:34,618
- What's in it?
- You want it, don't you?

454
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:39,093
Look, toughen you, I've gotta go
prepare for the photo in a second.

455
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:41,508
I'll drink it.

456
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:46,555
Hey Rupert, make a Midway for John.

457
00:45:14,564 --> 00:45:19,216
Looks to me like you're pretty ripe, John. 
Conga!

458
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:35,779
John, look what you've done.
You've cause such a ruckus.

459
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,565
Hey you, I didn't even see you..
coming.

460
00:46:50,566 --> 00:46:54,425
Yeah. I'm fantastic!
What? Yes, I love you.

461
00:46:54,426 --> 00:46:57,965
Yes, I love you!
Say it again. Thank you.

462
00:46:57,966 --> 00:47:00,197
You are been waiting for, huh?
Shake it.

463
00:47:00,198 --> 00:47:02,734
Come on, shake it. Shake it.
Give it to me.

464
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:10,042
How much did you had a drink?
Get away from me! You're a whore.

465
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,684
Hey, how's it going?

466
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:24,116
Yeah. No, no.. it's more than I
expected, really. Yeah, It's a good turnout.

467
00:47:33,248 --> 00:47:35,400
No, it's been great.
It's a great party.

468
00:47:40,633 --> 00:47:43,288
Oh, yes, yes. Of course. Hold on.

469
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:46,461
Everyone, everyone.

470
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:32,050
- So did you enjoy yourself?
- Yes I did.

471
00:48:35,085 --> 00:48:40,703
Sorry about Kelly and Adam, they sorta always
bring a possy with them whenever they come over.

472
00:48:40,972 --> 00:48:42,128
Oh, it's fine.

473
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:50,727
- So, am I staying here tonight?
- Well, I always thought that you would.

474
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,622
Yeah?

475
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:54,846
So, you're not sick of me yet?

476
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:01,051
- No. Not yet.
- Good.

477
00:49:03,093 --> 00:49:04,737
Oh, that reminds me..

478
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:16,926
It's okay, it's okay.

479
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:32,048
It's okay.

480
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:13,983
Hello?

481
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:16,096
Hello?

482
00:51:21,547 --> 00:51:22,712
Hello?

483
00:51:31,013 --> 00:51:32,188
Yes.

484
00:51:32,915 --> 00:51:37,123
Hello, Mr.Wilson, I'm sorry
I wasn't sure if you were here.

485
00:51:38,778 --> 00:51:43,338
Your friend.. Are you alright?

486
00:51:43,339 --> 00:51:46,428
He's fine. He's fine.
He's so little drunk.

487
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:48,545
He's been in character all evening.

488
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:52,159
- What do you mean 'in character'?
- We've just come from a costume party.

490
00:51:53,792 --> 00:51:56,755
He just staying in character by
jumping into the pool.

491
00:51:58,274 --> 00:52:00,260
You can see, it's.. becoming very tiresome.

492
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:04,707
I thought he may have be in pain from the sound he was making.

493
00:52:06,088 --> 00:52:08,505
Well, I did tell him not to mix his liquors.

494
00:52:09,662 --> 00:52:12,416
I'm so sorry we disturbed you.

495
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:15,520
But I think we're winding down now.
I promise you there won't be anymore noise.

496
00:52:15,521 --> 00:52:19,652
- Well, if you're sure everything's alright.
- Yes, thank you, I'm so sorry.

497
00:52:20,577 --> 00:52:23,207
- You'll have to excuse me.
- Okay. I'll let you go.

498
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,343
Okay. Take care.

499
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:53,586
- It's okay, you just had too much to drink.
- I'm sorry, is there something else?

500
00:52:53,714 --> 00:52:56,419
Are you sure he's alright?

501
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,602
He seems to be trying to pull his mask off.

502
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:03,044
Thank God! I've been trying to get him to
do that all night.

503
00:53:03,445 --> 00:53:07,959
He's really very drunk, I think maybe it's time
for him to go to bed, and me too.

504
00:53:08,036 --> 00:53:10,357
So. if there nothing else..

505
00:53:12,347 --> 00:53:14,193
- I guess not.
- Okay. Alright. Well then..

506
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,593
- Good night.
- Good night.

507
00:53:17,686 --> 00:53:18,804
Good night.

508
00:53:21,182 --> 00:53:22,455
Good night.

509
00:53:23,844 --> 00:53:26,082
Off to bed with you, young man.

510
00:53:46,029 --> 00:53:51,040
What if she goes and calls the police now, Warwick?
What you're going to do?

511
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:52,949
Warwick probably just breakdown.

512
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,332
He's not the most
masculin man in the world.

513
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,483
Shut up!

514
00:53:57,966 --> 00:54:02,257
-We really got to thinking about this now..
-The next time someone come in..

515
00:54:04,693 --> 00:54:05,806
Shut up!

516
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:11,869
You know what you really should be concern about Warwick - it's his foot.

517
00:54:13,847 --> 00:54:15,583
I think it needs some attention.

518
00:54:21,612 --> 00:54:23,765
Attention? Yes.

519
00:54:24,566 --> 00:54:29,084
I'll stop your mangle and bleeding foot from
dripping on my floor..

520
00:54:29,085 --> 00:54:30,808
once and for all.

521
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:50,039
It's not covered.

522
00:54:50,506 --> 00:54:51,977
I told you that already.

523
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:56,816
- There isn't an elective procedure?
- Baby, it's gonna be okay.

524
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:01,706
It's not okay. It's a fucking joke.

525
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,659
Can you even go to work tomorrow?

526
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,087
Yeah, I'll be fine.

527
00:55:05,688 --> 00:55:07,880
You can't keep taking those.

528
00:55:08,227 --> 00:55:11,327
Those painkiller if you keep putting those in your body
your liver gonna shut down.

529
00:55:11,328 --> 00:55:12,793
Okay, doctor.

530
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,003
This is fucking miserable.

531
00:55:23,693 --> 00:55:25,262
We've gotta get some money.

532
00:55:26,092 --> 00:55:27,195
No.

533
00:55:29,297 --> 00:55:32,329
Alright, come here.
Please, baby, just come here.

534
00:55:39,386 --> 00:55:41,113
You're not gonna steal any money.

535
00:55:41,807 --> 00:55:43,478
It's just not gonna happen.

536
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:45,860
I've tried it before.

537
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:48,292
Yeah, you went to prison for it.

538
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,387
I'm not going back.

539
00:55:54,932 --> 00:55:56,791
It's gonna be okay.

540
00:56:10,754 --> 00:56:12,704
These are both are pretty good.

541
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,896
I can't decide.
Which do you prefer?

542
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:25,728
I've to decide later.

543
00:56:27,395 --> 00:56:28,849
Why'd you do it to me?

544
00:56:34,268 --> 00:56:36,179
Nice move, Roman.

545
00:56:36,954 --> 00:56:41,075
- Warwick. Warwick please listen to me.
- I'm listening.

546
00:56:43,273 --> 00:56:45,141
Please don't do this, Warwick.

547
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:47,787
Okay?

548
00:56:49,525 --> 00:56:51,252
Please just let me go.

549
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:53,849
Warwick, I'll do anything.

550
00:56:55,801 --> 00:56:57,904
- Warwick.
- I wouldn't do that, Roman.

551
00:57:00,873 --> 00:57:04,764
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, John.

552
00:57:05,664 --> 00:57:06,904
What?

553
00:57:07,205 --> 00:57:08,788
That's physics.

554
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,142
It's nature's law.

555
00:57:14,716 --> 00:57:17,765
Oh, sweetheart.
No tears.

556
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,986
What I can do
to make it better?

557
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,218
Please let me go.

558
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:26,196
Just please don't kill me.

559
00:57:29,172 --> 00:57:33,356
You are my guest,
and I'm glad you're here.

560
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,832
But you've only got yourself to blame.

561
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:39,967
So, where is she now?

562
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:43,133
Who?

563
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,304
Julia.

564
00:58:49,606 --> 00:58:51,114
She's in Bangkok.

565
00:58:51,215 --> 00:58:53,802
She might be going to Hanoi, she
hasn't decided yet.

566
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:57,876
Who hasn't decided?

567
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:01,049
Julia.

568
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:03,564
Who's that?

569
00:59:05,493 --> 00:59:08,645
That's the girl you met in Australia, silly.

570
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,984
I've never been to Australia, Warwick.

571
00:59:14,693 --> 00:59:16,796
You mean you lied?

572
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:21,143
Yeah. Yeah, I lied.

573
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,847
Doesn't say much for your character.

574
00:59:26,683 --> 00:59:28,480
And you're Julia, Warwick.

575
00:59:31,436 --> 00:59:32,721
What?

576
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:35,554
You're Julia.

577
00:59:36,998 --> 00:59:40,030
Roman, Rupert, and Monica..

578
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:42,845
It's all you, Warwick.

579
00:59:47,747 --> 00:59:51,499
As fascinating as this is John, I do have others to attend to.

580
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,400
I can't be an ungracious host.

581
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:01,827
Anyone for a final cocktail?

582
01:00:03,911 --> 01:00:08,306
Monica? Oh, right I forgot.
Which you prefer? Dessert wine? Coffee?

583
01:00:08,878 --> 01:00:10,345
Suit yourself.
Rupert?

584
01:00:12,879 --> 01:00:14,575
Save the bottle for Roman.

585
01:00:18,685 --> 01:00:19,947
So what now?

586
01:00:21,854 --> 01:00:25,309
Now it's quite time, John.
That means..

587
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:29,757
Time to reflect. That means being quite, alright?

588
01:00:31,219 --> 01:00:35,039
It sound very entertaining.
I mean, I'm still your guest, aren't I?

589
01:00:35,274 --> 01:00:36,525
Of course you are.

590
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,094
Well?

591
01:00:42,525 --> 01:00:44,140
What do you have in mind?

592
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,136
Wait..

593
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:52,826
If you win, I'll grant you your freedom.

594
01:00:53,227 --> 01:00:55,580
But what do I get when you lose?

595
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:58,532
You've got my life, isn't that enough?

596
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:01,711
- Can't give you much more than that, Warwick.
- Yes, that's true.

597
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:04,128
But I already have that.

598
01:01:04,913 --> 01:01:06,581
Have you ever play chess before?

599
01:01:06,582 --> 01:01:09,122
- Yeah, once or twice.
- Okay.

600
01:01:10,617 --> 01:01:14,028
When you wanna move, you've need tell me which letter and..

601
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:15,448
corresponding number.

602
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:18,207
For example if you wanna move your bishop, you'll say..

603
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:21,351
Bishop to king 3.

604
01:01:22,828 --> 01:01:26,516
Now if have to move my rook, I'll go to knight 7.

605
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:28,775
Okay, so what's the best
strategy?

606
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:33,660
Well, that's the thing. I mean, we don't control your
opponent's pieces, you only control your own.

607
01:01:33,961 --> 01:01:36,799
But if you know your opponent, and you know
his weaknesses..

608
01:01:38,098 --> 01:01:41,761
and you planned right, then you can influence
your opponent behavior.

609
01:01:43,138 --> 01:01:47,920
I see. So, if I listen to you and
I pretend to be fascinated..

610
01:01:47,921 --> 01:01:51,660
and you think that you're teaching me chess,
then you would you make love to me?

611
01:01:52,064 --> 01:01:54,708
Yeah, nice try. You can get that anytime.

612
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:57,214
You don't have to pretend to be interested.

613
01:01:58,643 --> 01:02:01,194
What can you do for me?

614
01:02:01,495 --> 01:02:02,958
What can you do?

615
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:07,805
Surely the satisfaction of winning should
be enough for a man like you.

616
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:12,827
No.
"To the victor goes the spoils."

617
01:02:14,891 --> 01:02:20,104
- How would you spoil me, John?
- I don't know, Warwick How would you like me to spoil you?

618
01:02:24,746 --> 01:02:26,182
Let me think.

619
01:02:26,627 --> 01:02:28,729
- King.
- Yes.

620
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:31,553
Although the entire game revolves around
the king..

621
01:02:31,554 --> 01:02:33,619
It's the least powerful piece on the board.

622
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:38,003
See, it's movements are limited. It can only 
go to here.. Do this.. One at a time.

623
01:02:39,578 --> 01:02:42,695
Sometimes, the pawn is more important.

624
01:02:42,983 --> 01:02:44,991
It's the most ordinary piece on the board.

625
01:02:44,992 --> 01:02:49,080
It's simplest in function,
but if you use it properly..

626
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:51,008
can be absolutely devastating.

627
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:54,047
It may look like you have the upper hand.

628
01:02:54,448 --> 01:02:58,909
but if you're not paying attention,
then your opponent can blindside you ...

629
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:03,035
And one move..

630
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,112
That's the beauty of this game.

631
01:03:07,194 --> 01:03:09,458
I know what you can do for me
when you lose.

632
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:12,408
- Yes.
- My move, isn't it?

633
01:03:12,409 --> 01:03:16,073
- Yes, but listen.
- Queen to G6.

634
01:03:16,628 --> 01:03:19,885
- Okay, so. When I win..
- Checkmate.

635
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:23,528
What?

636
01:03:24,993 --> 01:03:26,383
Checkmate.

637
01:03:26,884 --> 01:03:28,122
How did that happen?

638
01:03:29,245 --> 01:03:31,023
How did you manage to do that?

639
01:03:31,124 --> 01:03:34,435
- Come on Warwick, untie me.
- But I had the perfect prize.

640
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:38,449
You said you would untie me
if I won, Warwick. Let's go.

641
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:44,156
You've played this before.
You cheated.

642
01:03:49,055 --> 01:03:51,139
You're a fucking liar, Warwick.

643
01:04:07,473 --> 01:04:11,577
I may be many things, John.
But one thing I'm not is a liar.

644
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,880
You're free to go.

645
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:27,889
You really are a worthless little man, aren't you, John?

646
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:31,301
You show no conviction, or fight at all.

647
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:35,764
You let me do whatever I
wanted to you. That's exactly what I did.

648
01:04:35,765 --> 01:04:38,458
In fact, I even think you enjoyed it.

649
01:04:39,597 --> 01:04:41,082
You're nothing.

650
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:47,084
John, you're disposable, forgettable..
A supporting player.

651
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:48,922
And nothing.

652
01:04:49,608 --> 01:04:51,150
It's like you don't even existed.

653
01:04:56,164 --> 01:04:59,624
Where are you going? John,
What are you doing?

654
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:04,207
John, put that down, John.
John, stop, please.

655
01:05:04,308 --> 01:05:06,001
You treated me like an animal.

656
01:05:07,344 --> 01:05:09,655
You've involved me in your
fuck up world.

657
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:13,363
You take away my dignity.

658
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,174
And you have the gall to say that
I'm nothing?

659
01:05:17,926 --> 01:05:19,267
But it's true.

660
01:06:10,874 --> 01:06:12,486
Hey, John.

661
01:06:14,633 --> 01:06:16,403
Check out this piece of ass, huh?

662
01:06:26,513 --> 01:06:27,676
Love me!

663
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:35,308
Love me!

664
01:09:19,164 --> 01:09:23,186
Warwick, you know you need to take
two of those.

665
01:09:23,423 --> 01:09:24,655
No, he doesn't.

666
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:28,357
- He knows what he's doing.
- Does he?

667
01:09:28,855 --> 01:09:31,589
I know you like it,
you never know when to leave, Monica

668
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,705
but he needs to function
at work.

669
01:10:26,924 --> 01:10:28,468
Morton, what are you doing?

670
01:10:28,469 --> 01:10:30,848
- Lieutenant, did I wake you?
- No, I'm up.

671
01:10:30,849 --> 01:10:33,727
- You're early.
- Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

672
01:10:34,124 --> 01:10:35,613
You've gotta want to see this.

673
01:10:36,014 --> 01:10:37,305
Alright, come on.

674
01:10:40,124 --> 01:10:41,974
Yeah, go on. Sit down.
I'll be right there..

675
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,260
Yeah, I'm positive now.

676
01:10:45,461 --> 01:10:47,164
John Taylor had help with this.

677
01:10:51,724 --> 01:10:53,609
One of the bank teller was in it with him.

678
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:55,000
Really?

679
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,545
- Can I use your TV?
- I don't have one.

680
01:10:58,276 --> 01:10:59,626
Ah, I forgot.

681
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:05,811
Alright.

682
01:11:06,773 --> 01:11:08,691
This is 3 weeks before the robbery.

683
01:11:09,272 --> 01:11:12,427
Taylor comes in, fills up the deposit slips.

684
01:11:13,408 --> 01:11:15,909
And cases the bank.
That's it.

685
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,674
How do you know that's Taylor?

686
01:11:18,753 --> 01:11:20,759
The.. the tattoo.

687
01:11:22,848 --> 01:11:24,048
It's him.

688
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:27,208
According to the teller, Simone De Marchi..

689
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,918
This woman.

690
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:33,650
according to Simone, John comes in
and asks her out.

691
01:11:34,195 --> 01:11:38,446
But as you can see, 
he doesn't going anywhere near her for counsel.

692
01:11:39,509 --> 01:11:43,151
Here's the robbery itself.
That's John waiting in line.

693
01:11:44,052 --> 01:11:49,459
The teller asks him to come over.
He doesn't go. He let the customer behind him through.

694
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,929
- He waits. Now, why did he do that?
- Because he want Simone to serve him.

695
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:55,080
Exactly.

696
01:11:55,828 --> 01:11:57,935
Now, she doesn't trip the sound of the alarm.

697
01:11:59,018 --> 01:12:01,908
She isn't put the dypack in. She's getting more bills.

698
01:12:03,603 --> 01:12:05,659
Well, she's in the back room. She could've done
anyone of this thing..

699
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,531
or let someone know.

700
01:12:08,085 --> 01:12:10,865
She had every opportunity.
She does nothing.

701
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:14,972
And there's this. A couple month back,
She put in for 2 weeks vacation.

702
01:12:14,973 --> 01:12:16,903
- Guess when it start?
- Today.

703
01:12:18,392 --> 01:12:20,925
She lied about John coming on to her..

704
01:12:20,926 --> 01:12:24,225
because she needs reason
to ID'ed him to us.

705
01:12:25,393 --> 01:12:28,580
They're in it together.
Or if they were.

706
01:12:28,815 --> 01:12:31,131
She keeps the money.
He gets caught.

707
01:12:31,332 --> 01:12:33,108
Nice girl.

708
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,349
Got any lead on Taylor?

709
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:38,001
Well, if we follow Simone, we find Taylor.

710
01:12:39,241 --> 01:12:42,818
- You think he's gonna go after her?
- When he find out what she did to him, yeah.

711
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:44,642
She's under surveillance?

712
01:12:45,077 --> 01:12:47,843
Yeah, Valdez is taking out her place.

713
01:12:58,637 --> 01:13:02,870
One of the bank employee identified the man as
Los Angeles resident, John Taylor.

715
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:33,853
I'm here to check on a reservation.
I'm meeting my wife at 9.

716
01:13:33,854 --> 01:13:35,923
Just want to make sure
everything's booked.

717
01:13:18,024 --> 01:13:19,824
 AMERICAN CAR RENTAL

718
01:13:37,398 --> 01:13:40,111
- Name?
- Simone Pryer.

719
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:52,555
Yeah, It's booked. Ford Sedan.
9 am.

720
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,747
Thank you, have a good day.

721
01:14:02,044 --> 01:14:05,679
If I listen to you and you and I
pretend to be fascinated..

722
01:14:08,774 --> 01:14:11,007
You don't have to pretend to be interested.

723
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:34,277
Ah, yes. I'm conforming a reservation,
for this morning.

724
01:14:35,506 --> 01:14:36,804
Sure, Los Angeles.

725
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:39,985
First name, Simone.

726
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:42,859
Nothing?

727
01:14:43,915 --> 01:14:45,652
Okay. Thank you.

728
01:14:48,511 --> 01:14:50,525
Simone Pryer.

729
01:14:53,176 --> 01:14:55,947
No?
Okay, thank you.

730
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:06,034
You do? What location is this?

731
01:15:08,894 --> 01:15:10,689
It's a 9 am pickup, correct?

732
01:15:13,785 --> 01:15:15,028
8 o'clock?

733
01:15:15,956 --> 01:15:17,456
It's gonna be okay.

734
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:39,786
- What's happening?
- Nothing, sir.

735
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:42,043
A light went on about
20 minutes ago.

736
01:15:42,444 --> 01:15:43,599
That's something.

737
01:15:48,078 --> 01:15:50,691
- It still amazes me.
- What's that?

738
01:15:51,334 --> 01:15:55,592
These people. They've gotta know, there's no chance
they gonna get away with this.

739
01:15:56,036 --> 01:15:59,083
If there is a way, someone will always gonna
try it. It's human nature.

740
01:15:59,084 --> 01:16:03,134
That's not it. Something's wrong with their wiring. 
It's fucking their head.

741
01:16:03,535 --> 01:16:07,031
Why can't they just get it together?

742
01:16:07,132 --> 01:16:09,137
You'd be out of job
if they did.

743
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:14,080
Law enforcement is more than
a job, detective.

744
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:17,489
Okay, here she comes.

745
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,818
Do you know the real problem?
There's no deterrence.

746
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,514
Look at southeast Asia,

747
01:16:32,658 --> 01:16:35,878
You spit in public in Singapore,
that's ground for arrest.

748
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:37,597
You get caught with drugs, that's death.

749
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:39,862
I mean, that's pretty extreme, isn't it?

750
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:41,830
Is it?

751
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,128
You check Singapore crime statistics.

752
01:16:45,094 --> 01:16:47,935
People need to understand that
government is fucking serious.

753
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:51,064
The US is a liberal playground,
am I right?

754
01:16:52,598 --> 01:16:54,933
Hey, she's turning.

755
01:17:15,684 --> 01:17:17,088
Come on!

756
01:17:24,376 --> 01:17:26,974
- Move your car!
- Shut up!

757
01:17:27,824 --> 01:17:29,030
Move it!

758
01:17:43,364 --> 01:17:45,091
Now she could be anywhere.

759
01:17:45,092 --> 01:17:46,521
Should we keep going on?

760
01:17:47,806 --> 01:17:50,076
You go up. I'll search the lower levels.

761
01:17:50,677 --> 01:17:52,027
Okay.

762
01:17:52,817 --> 01:17:54,513
Keep your radios on.

763
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,080
Unexpected?

764
01:18:11,081 --> 01:18:14,030
Baby? I was so worried about you.

765
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:16,506
- Don't.
- What happened to your face?

766
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:20,967
Hey listen, I don't even know how'd you found me.

767
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:24,730
I mean, you don't have a cell.
I've been crazy, going out of my mind.

768
01:18:24,831 --> 01:18:27,413
I've been freaked out. The cops are 
all over you.

769
01:18:27,448 --> 01:18:30,980
I don't know what to do, I swapped cars.
I was gonna come pick you up, baby.

770
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,739
I'm so happy to see..

771
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:35,055
Looks like you're feeling better.

772
01:18:36,756 --> 01:18:38,174
No pain this morning?

773
01:18:38,816 --> 01:18:40,733
- No, I still.. I mean..
- Just stop.

774
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:42,384
Okay, Simone?

775
01:18:46,726 --> 01:18:47,980
Why'd you do this?

776
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:53,562
Because you.. do it.

777
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,175
I do what?

778
01:18:56,176 --> 01:18:59,529
It's the bank job. I don't even
have to persuade you.

779
01:19:00,364 --> 01:19:05,291
What did you think? You're a
career criminal.

780
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,181
What'd you think was gonna happen?

781
01:19:16,153 --> 01:19:17,954
I wanted to trust you.

782
01:19:19,442 --> 01:19:25,946
Well, maybe we can still do.. I mean.. 
You know the truth now. We're not so different.

783
01:19:26,047 --> 01:19:29,354
But what they do is they give the team a half.. a half ago.

784
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:35,789
..actually gonna make money on that.

785
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:40,470
You need me. You can't get across
the border. You can't do this without me.

786
01:19:40,471 --> 01:19:44,899
..If you want to get joint with me on this,
I can get.. I know I can get us some better points out of it..

787
01:19:57,431 --> 01:20:01,353
..You can join now. But the thing is
if you put our money on one of the team there..

788
01:20:28,126 --> 01:20:29,375
Hello?

789
01:20:31,164 --> 01:20:32,728
That's not enough to exit.

790
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:34,829
Give me the keys.

791
01:20:43,608 --> 01:20:45,243
Morton, what's happening?

792
01:20:45,527 --> 01:20:49,549
Lieutenant, we've got Simone. We
checked the car, she doesn't has the money.

793
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:51,121
No sign of Taylor.

794
01:20:51,422 --> 01:20:54,034
- Right.
- We gonna take it down to the station.

795
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,870
Have you seen Taylor?

796
01:20:56,329 --> 01:21:01,081
Not yet. You check the roof and
stairwells, and then you go on back.

797
01:21:01,549 --> 01:21:04,313
I'll meet you there, I got some stuffs to attend to locally.

798
01:21:05,283 --> 01:21:08,287
- But you don't have a right, sir.
- Like I said, it's local.

799
01:21:08,288 --> 01:21:09,740
I'll call you if I need you.

800
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:11,684
Okay.

801
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,409
You didn't really think you're gonna 
get away with it, did you?

802
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:20,257
I swear to god if I get arrested,
I'm taking you down with me.

803
01:21:20,606 --> 01:21:22,865
I can describe every single details
of your house.

804
01:21:22,866 --> 01:21:26,023
I'm a police officer. You really think
anybody gonna believe you?

805
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:27,858
Yeah, I do.

806
01:21:30,071 --> 01:21:35,296
You've got penance. I'll give you that.
Or you don't know how to hold your liquor.

807
01:21:36,452 --> 01:21:38,026
So what now, Warwick?

808
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:41,566
Well, assuming you have the money,
I think we can come to an understanding.

809
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:44,070
Or I can simply shoot you
while you're trying to escape.

810
01:21:44,678 --> 01:21:47,158
The thing is, you never shot anybody, haven't you?

811
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:48,760
Haven't I?

812
01:21:48,761 --> 01:21:51,992
It's up to you. My detectives
will be down any minute.

813
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:21,691
The custom will be tough.
This will come in handy at the border.

814
01:22:24,986 --> 01:22:26,146
Thanks.

815
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:31,822
No need to thank me, John.
You make things very entertaining.

816
01:22:33,123 --> 01:22:34,420
Bon voyage.

817
01:23:39,805 --> 01:23:41,552
Watch out!

818
01:24:02,648 --> 01:24:04,546
I've been thinking about
John Taylor.

819
01:24:05,847 --> 01:24:08,171
Oh yeah?
What about him?

820
01:24:08,272 --> 01:24:13,628
At the parking garage. You were down there.
I'm amazed he got passed you.

821
01:24:14,129 --> 01:24:17,127
Yeah, well. I guess I'm getting old.

822
01:24:18,092 --> 01:24:20,179
I wonder where he went.

823
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:23,699
It's been a couple of months, he probably
crossed the country by now.

824
01:24:24,663 --> 01:24:27,986
Or.. Or out of the country.

825
01:24:28,087 --> 01:24:29,237
Could be.

826
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:33,821
Don't feel bad about this.
There's worse guy out there than Taylor.

827
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:37,512
And Simone De Marchi's trial coming up, right?

828
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,938
You did great work there.

829
01:24:41,542 --> 01:24:44,650
- You never met him before, right?
- Taylor?

830
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:45,751
No.

831
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:46,902
Never?

832
01:24:47,709 --> 01:24:49,590
Of course not, why?

833
01:24:49,591 --> 01:24:54,199
I just thought your past might've crossed.
He's had conviction..

834
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:56,842
Maybe you've met him at the station.

835
01:24:58,123 --> 01:25:00,561
And you never met him socially, right?

836
01:25:02,118 --> 01:25:05,337
He's not exactly my crowd, detective.

837
01:25:05,638 --> 01:25:06,973
Then..

838
01:25:10,586 --> 01:25:12,544
This might come a little bit of a shock.

839
01:25:18,015 --> 01:25:19,707
My God.

840
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:26,030
It's quite disturbing, isn't it?

841
01:25:27,931 --> 01:25:30,220
I think technology's getting out of control.

842
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:32,495
- What?
- If a guy like Taylor..

843
01:25:32,496 --> 01:25:34,100
can make something as professional
as this..

844
01:25:34,107 --> 01:25:37,538
Wait. Are you suggesting that
Taylor manufactured this?

845
01:25:37,805 --> 01:25:38,811
Of course.

846
01:25:38,812 --> 01:25:43,932
This is a Polaroid. A positive
exposure. This isn't sound Photoshop markup.

847
01:25:43,933 --> 01:25:46,355
It has to be, what other explanation
is there?

848
01:25:46,456 --> 01:25:48,509
Besides the obvious one?

849
01:25:48,904 --> 01:25:52,020
Ben, you've know for what?
10 years.

850
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:54,249
- Six.
- Six years.

851
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:57,409
Do you really think I would've associate
with this man?

852
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,992
I can't ignore it.

853
01:26:01,581 --> 01:26:04,255
I'm sorry, Warwick. I have to has
this analyze.

854
01:26:04,256 --> 01:26:08,041
Good. I like to know how he did it too.

855
01:26:10,689 --> 01:26:13,057
- The other thing is..
- Yeah.

856
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:19,095
A witness came forward who said that Taylor
tried to break into a house on another robbery.

857
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:25,231
She said she saw him again the next
morning. Outside her neighbor's house.

858
01:26:25,869 --> 01:26:27,366
That is your house.

859
01:26:32,607 --> 01:26:34,511
Is this the lady who lives behind me?

860
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:35,850
Yeah.

861
01:26:36,131 --> 01:26:41,330
Morton, do you know how many times that
woman called to this station?

862
01:26:41,952 --> 01:26:43,840
The lady is bad-shit

863
01:26:44,523 --> 01:26:46,647
Yeah. I know about her.

864
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:51,275
That's why we didn't take this
seriously. Until now.

865
01:26:52,322 --> 01:26:54,055
Looks like it's been taken at your place.

866
01:26:55,258 --> 01:26:58,532
It's a white couch. A white couch.

867
01:26:59,266 --> 01:27:04,214
Why you? If this a fake, why
put you in the photograph?

868
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:05,796
He's mocking us.

869
01:27:06,246 --> 01:27:07,820
So, where did he get your picture?

870
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:11,294
The paper. Last year Christmas party.

871
01:27:12,214 --> 01:27:15,574
You are the one who showed me his file
is resourceful, right?

872
01:27:16,821 --> 01:27:19,416
Tomorrow we'll be probably be looking on
a Polaroid of you and him

873
01:27:19,417 --> 01:27:21,512
sitting together in a
fucking hottub.

874
01:27:26,162 --> 01:27:27,305
Yeah.

875
01:27:32,384 --> 01:27:33,593
Except..

876
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:39,553
Except what, Ben.

877
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:42,704
I've been fall if I didn't investigate this thoroughly.

878
01:27:43,567 --> 01:27:46,273
And so you should.
You're a fine detective.

879
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,875
Now you'll have to excuse me.

880
01:27:51,472 --> 01:27:53,724
I need to take a look
around your home.

881
01:27:59,647 --> 01:28:01,166
Okay.

882
01:28:01,488 --> 01:28:02,861
Okay, good.

883
01:28:06,073 --> 01:28:07,212
You know.

884
01:28:07,513 --> 01:28:12,228
Ben, I can appreciate your diligence.
Coming here to talk to me must've been tough.

885
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:15,514
but are you really gonna bring a sea
of cops over to my house?

886
01:28:16,918 --> 01:28:19,653
- Ignoring this is not the solution.
- I agree.

887
01:28:20,189 --> 01:28:21,426
So?

888
01:28:21,938 --> 01:28:24,146
What do you have in mind?

889
01:28:25,337 --> 01:28:27,143
How about dinner?

890
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:30,172
When?

891
01:28:30,173 --> 01:28:34,554
You can come tonight. I already have some friends
coming over. I'm cooking.

892
01:28:34,822 --> 01:28:37,711
It'll be fun. You can scour the place.

893
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:40,978
I already have something more official in mind.

894
01:28:41,468 --> 01:28:44,274
I'm being civil, Ben.
I don't have to be.

895
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:47,807
I'd like to maintain our friendship.

896
01:28:49,269 --> 01:28:50,555
Alright.

897
01:28:50,756 --> 01:28:52,605
- Dinner sounds good.
- Great.

898
01:28:53,226 --> 01:28:55,171
- 8 o'clock?
- Sure.

899
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:01,193
Oh, and Ben..

900
01:29:02,122 --> 01:29:03,764
You drink red or white wine?

901
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:06,335
Oh, red.

902
01:29:07,324 --> 01:29:08,824
Fantastic.

903
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:33,000
