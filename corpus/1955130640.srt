1
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:23,943
Just once.

2
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,979
That one for signature ?

3
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,851
Let's discuss that next time
when we're in the office.

4
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,685
Now is the time to mourn

5
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,431
Have you seen Chino ?

6
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,566
I saw him talking to a woman
a while ago.

7
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:47,908
Excuse me.

8
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:48,908
Okay.

9
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,048
Chino.

10
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,551
Chino.

11
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,959
Chino.

12
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,795
Chino ?

13
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,307
Chino.

14
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:28,581
Chino !

15
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:43,896
Sorry to interrupt.

16
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,297
Chino.

17
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:49,635
Bro ...

18
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:50,997
Miss,
get dressed.

19
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,072
Chino,
we need you at the dining room.

20
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,097
Now.

21
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,610
Hey ...

22
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,777
sorry, Ka .

23
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,674
It's Cassey.

24
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,211
Look, I got to go,
okay.

25
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,447
Are we still going to see
each other ?

26
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,147
Ya,
I'll call you.

27
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,552
To my esteemed children ...

28
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,122

And all personal effects properties

34
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:40,753

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,123
- What do you need ?
- 1000 shares ...

38
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,822
I'm also part of this family.

39
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,263
But you're not needed here.

40
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,595
Come on, bro,
she's still part of the family

41
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,872
Chino,
I know that.

42
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,206
But this is just between siblings.

43
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,574
We'll talk later,
Ella.

44
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,478
Okay,
continue attorney ...

45
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,515
1000 shares from the
First Modern Group of Companies.

46
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,186
And 500 shares from Distiller a Cimpaoco.

47
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,620
- It's okay.

48
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,885
I hereby designate,
Samuel Lee,

49
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,060
the executor and the administrator
of this last will and testament,

50
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:31,260
and in his incapacity,
I name ad designate Roberto Peñafrancia

51
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,069
as his substitute.

52
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Bro,

53
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,836
cheers ...

54
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,972
Dad's funeral has just been done,

55
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,682
yet you've been fooling around with a girl.

56
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,950
What can I do ?,
She likes me.

57
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,624
And it's a shame
if you'll reject such, right ?

58
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,293
When will you fix life ?

59
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,995
You need to get involve with the business
that Dad left us.

60
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,823
There's an end with our inheritance,
Chino.

61
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,994
Bro,
you gotta learn how to relax.

62
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,772
I'm not yet ready,
I still want to enjoy.

63
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,967
You should try it some time.

64
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,207
150,000 a month including
your credit card expenses,

65
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,271
if you won't work with the company.

66
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,250
How will I manage 150,000 ?

67
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,186
You're not paying for the house,
electricity and maid.

68
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,880
It's not even enough for gas.

69
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,787
Then don't go out of the house.

70
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,624
I shouldn't go out of the house.

71
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,032
Is that possible ?

72
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,863
Chino, I'm the one left as guardian
of your in heretance.

73
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,402
I should protect it.

74
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,103
It's for your own good.

75
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,736
How would I live with that ?

76
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,677
If you'll learn how to be thrifty.

77
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,574
Or you'll work.

78
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,245
Are you serious about me ?

79
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,692
You love me ?

80
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,959
I do.

81
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,463
You look lovely.
I'll come to the Philippines and meet you

82
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,697
Really ?

83
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,262
When you ...
going here ?

84
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,865
Someday soon.

85
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:19,008
And then ...
what's going to happen ?

86
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,108
I will work at a way
to bring you to the UK with me.

87
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,644
promise.

88
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,252
Swear ?
Hope u you die ?

89
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,581
Let's meet first.

90
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,154
Let's meet !
Let's meet. Let's Meet.

91
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:36,788
Ma !

92
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,466
You've been spending hours here,

93
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,697
instead of helping me sell barbecued chicken
intestines.

94
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:47,564
Ma,
I can see better future in this computer.

95
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:51,075
You might be talking to a killer or a sadist.

96
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,505
Ma, I'm okay.
Don't worry.

97
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,647
That's enough.

98
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,075
Ma !

99
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,150
Just got a few minutes left.

100
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,413
- The money I paid will just get wasted.
- What do you mean just a second ?

101
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:06,549
You've been there for hours.
Help me sell, please.

102
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Thank you.

103
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,395
Come on.

104
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,396
We've got customers.

105
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,700
What's yours ?

106
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,225
Our sale gets bigger when your here.

107
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,403
Yeah! I love this, ma !

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,309
More chicks with my favor Te
guys in the world.

109
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,278
More chicks for us,
not for you.

110
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,414
I'll be the one who'll get the most,
dude.

111
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,717
You wanna bet,
I'll get 3.

112
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,845
Dude, it seems like you're
the only gorgeous guy here.

113
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:34,987
You ?

114
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,155
My skills ...

115
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,086
You're blocking the way !

I'll take care of this.

00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,996
Watch this.

120
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,505
Get yourself together !

121
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,107
For the devil !

122
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,148
For our brother chino.

123
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,221
I'll be the one to pay all of these,
you fool.

124
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,222
Good to know,
good to know.

125
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,226
Bro,

126
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,119
Hot chick !
Hot chick !

127
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,723
Send her a shot.

128
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,232
That's better,
okay.

129
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,336
- Come on, let's talk to her. Come with me.
- Gotta get up.

130
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,337
- Bro Later.
- Nong !

131
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,806
It's 11 :30.
Australia ?

132
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,133
Canada.

133
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,246
It would be better,
if you were chatting with a British.

134
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,712
Don't mind it, 'Nong.
Whoever he is.

135
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,474
I just need to get out of the country.

136
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,719
Okay,
go on and have a drink.

137
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,815
Thanks, 'Nong

138
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,485
5 shots he doesn't do it.

139
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,925
Dude,
don't challenge me.

140
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,121
You're just a poser.

141
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,191
Come on.

142
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I'll show you.

143
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,067
10 shots on me.

144
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,375
Hi !

145
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:05,911
Hi.

146
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,571
You I've around here ?

147
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,174
How about you ?
From Manila, right ?

148
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,509
How did you know ?

149
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,581
Co'z guys from Manila are loud.

150
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:22,057
It’s like they have a license to do that
in other territories.

151
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,764
Sorry,
they're just enjoying.

152
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,261
By the way I'm Chino.

153
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,737
Lani.

154
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,539
Don't move !

155
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,543
- Who are you ?
- We're arresting you for using illegal drugs.

156
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,544
- And for selling illegal drugs.
- I didn't do it.

157
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,417
- Sammy ! Sammy, help me !
- You have the right to remain silent.

158
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,382
That' not true.

159
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,978
- Everything you say can be used in court.
- Sammy !

160
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,490
Sammy !

161
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:52,658
Sammy !

162
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,557
Sammy,
help me.

163
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,627
Don't do this to me.

164
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,664
You know the truth.
Help me !

165
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,200
Tell them the truth !

166
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,535
Sammy !

167
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,570
Sammy !

168
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,369
I was born and grew up here Angeles.

169
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,331
The story of my I Fe,

170
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,799
is usual story of the GI babies.

171
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,905
My mom's a prostitute,

172
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,768
my dad's a pilot.

173
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,670
But when the US base pulled out in 1992,
my mom was just pregnant at that time,

174
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,749
that's why I didn't get to see my dad.

175
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,021
You know,
whenever I see an airplane,

176
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,617
I thought of my dad flying with it.

177
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,254
Maybe he's a good pilot.

178
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,122
It's just sad that I didn't get to try
flying with him.

179
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:10,061
You know, Lani. You don't need
your dad to fulfill your dream.

180
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,663
I don't have a visa,
not even a passport.

181
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,637
I don't even have money to buy a ticket.

182
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,001
You can get it for free.

183
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,209
Is there such Thing as free nowadays ?

184
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,384
There is.

185
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,927
(Speaks I kapampangan)

186
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,763
Can you see how small my house is ?

187
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:54,997
Mal

188
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:57,676
What's that ?

189
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,243
What do you mean,
"What's that" ?

190
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,905
You should be the one who answer your quest on.
What's that ?

191
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,379
There,
look at the card.

192
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,315
What happened to you ?

193
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,318
Mal

194
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,959
I have a boyfriend,
now.

195
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:23,397
You know that girls in Manila
are one cent for 10

196
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,831
Especially for the rich ones.

197
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,433
Ma,
that's the point.

198
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,664
There are a lot of girls in Manila

199
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,209
but he chose me.

200
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,579
I just don't want you to get hurt.

201
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,043
Ma,
don't worry about me.

202
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,825
Lani,
you have visitor.

203
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,596
Good afternoon.

204
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,336
Lunch ?

205
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:04,708
You thought we're eating in an
air-conditioned restaurant, right ?

206
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,710
You're wearing a jacket.

207
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:09,814
Why,
don't you like it ?

208
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,916
I wore this for you.

209
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,017
So you'd find me gorgeous.

210
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,255
So what did you order ?

211
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,523
This is obviously a frog.

212
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,524
But ...

213
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,555
We call it "betute".

214
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,425
Frog stuff with meat.

215
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,331
Okay.

216
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,866
I eat frog legs so I'm okay with this.

217
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,206
That one.
It looks scary.

218
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,374
What's that ?

219
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,603
This one,
we call it "kamaru".

220
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,479
It's Delicious.

221
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,675
It looks like a cockroach.

222
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,684
These are insects
living in the rice fields' mud.

223
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,922
How does it become delicious ?

224
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,619
Insects living in mud ?

225
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,563
They feed on leaves.

226
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,660
Pigs eat swill.

227
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,495
Which one do you think is better ?

228
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,739
You're right.

229
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
This ?

230
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,105
This one s delicious.

231
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,837
It tastes like fried chicken.

232
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:13,409
Eat it.

233
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,246
We call it "dagis".

234
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:21,017
A lot of people say that exotic food tastes
like fr ed chicken.

235
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,852
I'm scared ...
What's this ?

236
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:26,725
Rat.

237
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,326
Okay ...

238
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,694
There's no way I'm eating Mickey Mouse.

239
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,574
Sir here are your keys and your room number.

240
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:47,812
This way please.

241
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:48,847
Thank you.

242
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,018
Thaks, guys.

243
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,085
Welcome Sir.

244
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,819
Sammy,
please get me out of here.

245
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,254
I'll clean up.

246
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,031
When you're well already Ella.

247
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,123
I'm okay already.

248
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Come on.

249
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,001
I'll do everything.

250
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,128
Sammy, please.

251
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:22,400
Ella, when you get out of here, I'll
give you your own condominium unit.

252
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:23,975
Monthly allowance.

253
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,870
You'll live comfortably.

254
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,040
But with one condition.

255
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,472
What condition ?

256
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,483
You won't fight me with the annulment case
that I'll file.

257
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,252
Sammy ...

258
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,250
Psychological in capacity for using illegal drugs.

259
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,555
Sammy,
I just did it because I love you.

260
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,224
Ella,
if you resist,

261
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,696
you'll rot here in rehabilitation center.

262
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,992
What kind of offer is that ?

263
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,094
Whichever I pick makes me a loser.

264
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,871
I know.

265
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,239
Go now,
take her.

266
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
You're an animal.

267
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,976
Guys,
Cheers for the friendship and ladies ...

268
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,036
Boys, boys, boys !

269
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,008
Chino, you gotta introduce us to
this fine lady you're with, man

270
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,111
Fine lady, huh.

271
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:08,779
Lani,
these are my friend.

272
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:09,753
Daniel,

273
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,122
Hi !

274
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,790
- We're all single. You might have friends ...
- This is Mon, Albert

275
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:14,817
Not this one.

276
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:15,994
He's a playboy.

277
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,289
Dude,
you were with another ...

278
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,225
Hey morons.
These are on me

279
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,192
I'll take care of it !
For free.

280
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
There !

281
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,535
Thank you.

282
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,237
I'm single.

283
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,169
One more round.

284
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:29,475
Party time.

285
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,136
Boss,
can you lessen your loudness.

286
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,675
Why,
do we have a problem ?

287
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,143
Yes,
we have a problem.

288
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,217
You're too loud.

289
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,785
We're loud.

290
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,748
This one is stupid.

291
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:42,478
This is a club, right ?

292
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,555
- Are we loud ?
- Of course, co'z this is a club.

293
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:45,848
I don't care who he is.

294
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,856
Dude, if you can't take the noise
then go find some other place.

295
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,027
Did you here that ?

296
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,557
Let's go to another place.

297
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,043
Hey,
get your hands off my date.

298
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:52,687
Chino,
that's enough.

299
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,431
Dude,
you're in no place.

300
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,699
You're in no place.

301
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:55,767
Chino,
that's enough.

302
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:00,572
Chino, that's enough.

303
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,964
It's not his fault.

304
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,567
He just protected me
from the Mayor's son.

305
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,074
Come on.

306
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,213
Attorney Litaua.

307
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,794
You were informed about this already.

308
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,454
Bautista.

309
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,021
Sir ?

310
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,229
Those who are from Manila.

311
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,861
Chino, are you okay ?

312
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:26,965
Were you hurt ?

313
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,860
Attorney, thank you.

314
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:30,235
Sorry, I came a bit late.

315
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,042
We had a hard time dealing with this one.

316
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,771
Attorney, what did my brother say ?

317
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,439
Well, he had to pull some strings.

318
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,574
He's really mad.

319
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,375
You should go back to Manila immediately.

320
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,479
Let's go.

321
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,245
Let's go.

322
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,681
Chino.
Hold it.

323
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,849
Where are you going ?

324
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,644
- I'll come back for you. Wait for me.
- I'll come with you.

325
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:47,886
Wait for me.

326
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,487
Chino.

327
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,890
Okay, book it.

328
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,424
Then e-mail me,
the itinerary immediately.

329
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,262
Okay, thank you.

330
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Bro, I'm sorry.

331
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,229
Take a bath.

332
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,130
Your flight is at 5:30am.

333
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,508
It's 2am.

334
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,044
You have to be in the airport in 30 minutes.

335
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,579
Where am I going ?

336
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,947
To America.

337
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,215
Stay there.

338
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,677
I don't want to go there.

339
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:20,932
What will I do in America ?

340
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,312
Chino, you had a fight
with the Mayor's son.

341
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,291
Do you think your fight
with him ends there ?

342
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,155
They wouldn't stop
until they get back at you.

343
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,087
Now, if you still love your life,

344
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,699
cool down in America.

345
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,594
Put these in the car.

346
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,169
Tell Edwin to take Chino to the airport.

347
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,409
Let's eat ?

348
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,006
No one dies by being broken hearted.

349
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,044
But with an ulcer, there is.

350
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,521
Ma,

351
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:00,953
I'm pregnant.

352
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,230
Why didn't you listen to me ?

353
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,334
You're really hard-headed.

354
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,164
Didn't I tell you ?

355
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,935
That men will just use you and hurt you.

356
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,338
Ma, what do you know about love ?

357
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,146
Men's worth is just an amount of money for you,
right ?

358
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,952
Oh yes.

359
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,820
I once loved.

360
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,524
To your dad.

361
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,024
Weren't you the fruit of our love ?

362
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,568
He promised to come back for me.

363
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,006
And like you ...

364
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,240
I believed him.

365
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,472
I was once like you.

366
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:02,347
My heart leaps whenever a car
stops in front of our house.

367
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,288
But days passed,

368
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:08,893
weeks,

369
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,029
months,

370
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,522
years.

371
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,699
Now tell me.

372
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,930
Am I the one that you should question
if I know anything about love ?

373
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,375
Sir chino isn't here.
He's in America.

374
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,009
Ha ?
When will he come back ?

375
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,286
I don't know.

376
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,894
Go now, ma'am.
Sir Ginno is not here.

377
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:37,683
Wait a second.

378
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,220
Sir !

379
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,986
Please don't close the gate.

380
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,859
Sir.

381
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,497
Chino !

382
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,234
Wait a second.

383
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,997
Chino.
Chino.

384
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,442
Who are you ?

385
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,268
I'm sorry.
I thought you're Chino.

386
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,304
I'm his girlfriend from Angeles.

387
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,749
Someone came here yesterday.
His girlfriend from Cebu,

388
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,384
from Bacolod, from Palawan, from Boracay

389
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:12,182
So you see,
you're not his only girlfriend.

390
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,322
But he said that he'll come back.

391
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:15,991
Chino is in America now.

392
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,022
He's not coming back.

393
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,594
So please,
don't come and bother us here.

394
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,624
Wait a second.

395
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,359
But he said ...

396
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,260
Wait a second ...

397
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,396
Hold it.

398
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,572
Please bring out Chino if you don't
want me to create trouble here.

399
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,572
I'm pregnant and he's the father.

400
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,569
Sir, what now ?

401
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,818
- Sir, please let Chino show up.
- She doesn't want to move over. I'll go on.

402
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,709
Sir !
Bring out Chino.

403
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,941
Ma ...

404
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,243
It isn't God's will.

405
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,055
Maybe what happened is better,

406
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,223
than you being a single mom.

407
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,555
You'll find a man,
who's really for you.

408
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,132
Forget him.

409
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,909
Bro,
why do all my credit cards were declined ?

410
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,153
Because you're spending
beyond your allowance.

411
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,282
Bro, I'm spending dollars.

412
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:55,084
Chino, if you weren't shopping
at designer outlets,

413
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,087
dinng in expensive restaurants,

414
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,928
you can manage your budget.

415
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,331
But bro ...

416
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,124
Okay, I get it.

417
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,791
You wanna punish me, alright ?

418
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,068
But be reasonable.

419
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:06,161
No.
You be reasonable.

420
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,271
All the money
that you're spending there,

421
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,462
shall be deducted to your inheritance.

422
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,240
It's not like a deep well
that doesn't ran out.

423
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,670
With your kind of lifestyle,

424
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,312
your money will be gone that soon.

425
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:17,708
And if it's gone,

426
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,310
you're on your own.

427
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:21,886
You'll be left sorry.

428
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,215
Bro, how am I gonna live decently
with 150,000

429
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:24,912
Tell me.

430
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,290
It's easy.

431
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,485
Just learn to be thrifty

432
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,219
or work.

433
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:30,995
This is BS !

434
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,567
Adobo ?
Pancit ?

435
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,444
You are Filipino, right ?

436
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,013
Yes.

437
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,146
I thought you're Japanese.

438
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,180
Ah no.
I'm pure-blooded Filipino.

439
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,853
And you ?

440
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,085
Chinese, Filipino ...

441
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:07,758
A combination.

442
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,393
Do you like ?

443
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:10,528
Really ?

444
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,662
Yeah.

445
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:13,632
Here.

446
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,632
Wow.

447
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,432
Before that,
I'm Chino. You are ?

448
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,405
I'm Gwen.
Nice to meet you.

449
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,165
Nice to meet you.

450
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,741
Here.
It's Po son-free.

451
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,012
Wow, I haven't eaten something like this.

452
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:30,805
Delicious ?

453
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:31,413
There.

454
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,583
Delicious.

455
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,984
Did you cook this ?

456
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,516
Oh, no,
My grandmother.

457
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:36,945
My grandmother cooks.

458
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,820
When she cooks,
it's as if like there's feast.

459
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,126
Then there are left overs
that she wants me to bring in school.

460
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,427
She expects me to eat all of it.

461
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:46,864
Obviously, I can't.

462
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,760
So I look for Filipino here in Minnesota.

463
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,125
Which ending ...
none.

464
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,561
So I just throw it ...

465
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,465
- Dont
- If she's that I haven't eaten all of it,

466
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,606
she'd feel bad.

467
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,475
Throw it to me.

468
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,005
So how long have you been staying here ?

469
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:02,813
Sorry.

470
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:03,605
Sorry.

471
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:04,882
Do I talk too much ?

472
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,317
Okay, just eat.

473
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,256
Thank you.

474
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,127
Still have more ?

475
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:16,389
I still have spring rolls.

476
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,599
Thank you.

477
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Good.

478
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:28,367
Are the B and the V sounds like ballpen

479
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,174
Say it with me.

480
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,375
Ballpen.

481
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:31,999
Good.

482
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,175
And vaity.

483
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:37,515
Vanity.

484
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,049
Pencil.

485
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:40,785
Pencil.

486
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,280
And Feather.

487
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:44,516
Feather.

488
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,590
This year's Miss Body Valentio is ...

489
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,820
Miss Lailanie Dizo.

490
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,299
Peter Piper ...

491
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:56,634
Peter Piper,

492
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,735
Picked a peck ...

493
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,564
picked a peck,

494
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,737
of pickled pepper ...

495
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:00,971
of pickled pepper,

496
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,106
where's the peck ...

497
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,174
where's the peck,

498
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,408
of pickled pepper ...

499
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,509
of pickled pepper,

500
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:06,777
Peter Piper picked.

501
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,003
Peter Piper picked.

502
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,399
Alright, ladies.

503
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,593
One lemonade and cheese sticks.

504
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,270
Would that be all ?

505
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,304
- Thank you.
- Alright, thanks.

506
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,867
Chino, I think she's ready to order.

507
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:40,211
I got it.

508
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,739
Hi, I'm Chino.
I'll be ...

509
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:47,852
Still working ?

510
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
Yes.

511
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:50,921
Would you take long ?

512
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,248
About 30 minutes, why ?

513
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,491
Do you miss me already ?

514
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,415
Midnight snack ?

515
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,118
All for food, yes.

516
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,064
You're cheap.

517
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,725
Well, you had me in adobo.

518
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,395
Wait 't I you try
my grandma's kare-kare.

519
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:08,932
You know your grandma,
is she single ?

520
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,198
Can I marry her ?

521
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,145
My dad will kill you.

522
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,176
Well in that case,
I'll settle for you.

523
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,311
You'll marry me ?

524
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,880
This restaurant might have
hit you big time.

525
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,014
You're fluent in Tagalog.

526
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:30,126
But you speak like
those on the out skirts.

527
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,827
Ah Okay, Oh really ?

528
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,222
Hey, don't get irritated.

529
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,056
It's okay.

530
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:35,958
Really okay.

531
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:37,368
If you want,

532
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,331
You can have midnight snack
on your own ...

533
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:40,102
Hold it ...

534
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:40,863
Come on, stay.

535
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:41,662
10 minutes.

536
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:42,362
I'm just kidding.

537
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:43,807
I'll get you a drink.

538
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:44,942
Okay.

539
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,146
So my mom,
died when I was 10.

540
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,683
My dad he died
3 months ago.

541
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,884
When he was alive,

542
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,424
he was never around anyway.

543
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,123
So my brother Sammy,

544
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,731
he's been father figure ko.

545
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:08,900
He attended all the meetings,

546
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,067
PTA,

547
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:11,936
Graduation.

548
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,095
And Dad, wasn't there.

549
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,864
So he was my father figure.

550
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,175
But then,

551
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,210
He got into our family business.

552
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,744
And he was no longer around.

553
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,441
They didn't care about me anymore.

554
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,784
And that's when I became
this spoiled Iittle rich kid.

555
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,920
I started all these vices,

556
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,581
became kind of a playboy.

557
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,759
And now I'm here.

558
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,826
So why are you here ?

559
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,459
You really wanna know ?

560
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,427
I had a fight with a Mayor's son.

561
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,797
But it's not my fault.

562
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:52,101
If you have a lot of money
then why did you take the waiter job ?

563
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:54,979
I guess,

564
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,247
My brother is guilty,

565
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,980
he wants to show me
that he loves me.

566
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,486
Pathetic, right ?

567
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,618
Aren't you a bit old enough
to be rehabilitated ?

568
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,989
Okay so what do you suggest
Miss Psyche major ?

569
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,889
I don't know ...
Psycho-therapy ...

570
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,759
Substitution therapy,

571
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,266
Regression ...

572
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,392
Lobotomy maybe.

573
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,433
I'm scared of your suggestions.

574
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:23,402
Can't you just be my medicine ?

575
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:25,809
I don't know.

576
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,270
You might go more insane
because of me.

577
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,037
Maybe I'm going insane.

578
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,498
Hey, sweetie.

579
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:48,131
Yes ?

580
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,299
How are you ?

581
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,391
I'll join you later.

582
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:51,261
Have a seat, please.

583
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,436
Have a seat,

584
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,528
- Please ?
- Okay.

585
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,205
What's your name ?

586
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,567
Whatever you like.

587
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:57,571
Whatever I like ?

588
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:58,742
Ya.

589
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,138
Well,
I like "Beautiful ... "

590
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,210
This place will do.

591
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,347
Let's grabinside.

592
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:06,548
I'll be back, okay ?

593
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:07,685
Where are you going ?

594
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:08,784
CR ...

595
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,284
What's the ?,
what's the CR ?.

596
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:11,746
Jingle.

597
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,157
Jingle ?.

598
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,191
Pee.

599
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,293
I'm sorry.

600
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,428
I'm sorry.

601
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:18,629
Please.

602
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,426
Ya, over there.

603
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,007
Is this your home address already ?

604
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,809
Am I going to send
Christmas cards here,

605
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,319
and my birthday cards for you ?

606
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,527
The house is too quiet.

607
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,458
I feel so alone.

608
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:02,364
The company isn't going to be broke
for you to become too workaholic.

609
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,307
You need a life, man.

610
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,708
You need to enjoy life.

611
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:10,240
You need a woman in your life.

612
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,780
Women can cause you headache.

613
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,148
After what I experienced with Ella,

614
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:19,983
I don't want them anymore.

615
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,949
You need a good decent woman.

616
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:27,320
Don't shut the possibility
of marrying again.

617
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,093
You'll never know.

618
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:32,228
Sit down.

619
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,437
Join me, come on.

620
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,365
Don't mind if I do.

621
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,547
Hi !

622
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:44,974
Hey, how are you ?

623
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,216
My cousin Rache.

624
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:46,975
Hi, Nice to meet you.

625
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,185
Chino.

626
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
Hi, Gwen.

627
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,121
This is my dad.

628
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,119
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you ?

629
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,748
This is my aunt, my uncle.

630
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:56,727
Fe ...

631
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:58,328
Fe, Come here ...
Help me.

632
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,566
This is Aunt Fe.

633
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:09,799
Hi aunt Fe.

634
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:10,938
How about you ?
Have you eaten ?

635
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,209
My mommy's bestfriend.

636
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,368
My two cousins,
Andrew and Anna.

637
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,878
And wait,
this is my grandma.

638
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:18,882
Your grandma ?

639
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,507
Yes.

640
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,046
Nice to finally meet you.

641
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:24,355
Go ahead and eat.

642
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,353
You know,
you should eat well.

643
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,600
Get everything
and eat all of it.

644
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,668
Because I cooked it.
Okay ?

645
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,466
Your adobo is my favorite, grandma.

646
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
That's good, that's good.

647
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,700
I'll do it.
It's okay.

648
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,403
Thank you very much.

649
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,441
It wouldn't light up
if you'll just stare at t.

650
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,577
I don't usually operate this ...

651
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,214
Ya.

652
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:26,848
Ya.

653
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,985
Chino, you see,
there are dots, right ?

654
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,712
This dot is for this.

655
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,455
This one is for that.

656
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,382
And this one is for ...

657
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,387
That one.

658
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,788
There.
Amazing, right ?

659
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:38,519
I know it hat.

660
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,755
See ?
Good.

661
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,759
Next time I know.

662
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,034
Okay.

663
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,503
Now,

664
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,697
Ask for hot water
from your Neighbor.

665
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,542
From my neighbor ?

666
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,570
You just taught me how.

667
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,611
You just turned it on, right ?

668
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,781
You're teas ng me.

669
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,120
How could I live without you ?

670
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,373
You shouldn't even be
in a place like that.

671
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,298
You know,
I actually mistook you for a joiner.

672
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,575
I'm actually do ng a research.

673
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:30,981
What do you mean ?

674
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,009
I plan to put up a bar like that

675
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,584
and I want to check out the menu,
the bar I st.

676
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,582
And the mechanics of those
who're called joiners.

677
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,687
Yeah, Bring business to that place.

678
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,786
Ya.
Iced tea and they're good to go.

679
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,699
A little ced tea goes a long way.

680
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,435
I know.

681
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:56,197
What do you. Where are you thinking
opening this kind of restaurant ?

682
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,107
I'm thinking back in my hometown, Angeles.

683
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,140
But I'm planning to put up a restaurant
here n Manila.

684
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:07,784
Wow.

685
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,559
When do you think you are starting ?

686
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,551
I'm actually short on funds right now ...

687
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,954
And I need a bit more time to raise it.

688
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,630
You know what ?

689
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:24,632
I've been thinking about some business
that I can get into

690
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:25,836
here in the Philippines.

691
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,866
And I like your idea.

692
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,907
I can't own the business myself.

693
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,836
But why don't I help raise funds for you.

694
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,944
Then you and I could be business partners.

695
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,117
That sounds like a good plan.

696
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,095
In the mean time,

697
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,924
may I invite you
to our charity ball this weekend ?

698
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:15,419
You alright ?

699
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:16,586
Ya,

700
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,654
Can I get you a drink ?

701
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,052
Sure.

702
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,456
Alright.

703
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,370
Sorry, Excuse me for a while.

704
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Excuse me.

705
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,316
Excuse me.

706
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:49,286
Are you alone ?

707
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,154
I'm with someone.

708
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,456
I can see that you don't
enjoy this e ther.

709
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,329
Never did.

710
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,266
I'm Sammy Lee.

711
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,902
Lani.

712
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,104
Hi.

713
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:11,203
So I assumed,
your with the consul ...

714
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,343
He's a friend.

715
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:18,407
Would he mind,
if we have coffee at the lobby and talk.

716
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:22,819
I don't think so.

717
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,558
You don't think
we can talk and have coffee ?

718
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,991
I don't think the Consul would mind.

719
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:48,972
Ma'am this s from Mr. Sammy Lee.

720
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:50,147

00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,346
Please return that to your boss.

722
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,284
What ?

723
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,353
I don't need what he has sent me.

724
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,385
Ma'am, my boss might get mad at me.

725
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,289
Please tell him,
I can't accept this.

726
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,254
I'd like you to meet Pat and Brenda.

727
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,351

Obviously she owns the place.

730
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,769
everything's going splendid.

731
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,964
Thank you for coming guys.

732
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,071
Thank you for coming.

00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,259
Hi.

744
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,922
Why don't you want
to accept my gifts for you ?

745
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,493
I've got a lot of customers,

746
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,700
don't create trouble here

747
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,242
Wait, I'm not creat ng trouble.

748
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,896
Actually,
you bring trouble in my mind.

749
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,632
I want to know you.

750
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,076
Like what I said,

751
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:54,571
I don't need your gifts.

752
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,244
I don't have a bad intention.

753
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,429
I just want to make friends with you.

754
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,647
I don't need friends.

755
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,850
Hold t, I don't understand.

756
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,891
I thought we were having
a good conversat on last n ght.

757
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,427
I thought were okay.

758
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:12,429
We're okay.

759
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:14,489
You don't need gifts.

760
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,397
You don't need a friend.

761
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:18,602
What do you want ?

762
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,163
I want a serious relationship.

763
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,670
Now if you can't givel that to me,

764
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:25,842
don't bother anymore.

765
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:27,177
Excuse me.

766
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,112
Ma'am Lani, somebody called,

767
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,843
they're interested
to get our catering services.

768
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,054
What's the problem ?

769
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,914
It's a bit big time.

770
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,885
They want some foods that are not
included in our menu.

771
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:44,760
What k nd of food do they want ?

772
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,223
I can't understand.

773
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:49,031
I don't know half of the menu

774
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,460
I can't pronounce the other half.

775
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:52,931
Let me see.

776
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,170
Here, ma'am.

777
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,466
Just turn them down.

778
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,507
I only know Kapampangan dishes.

779
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,392
Ma'am, it'll be a waster opportunity.

780
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:04,481
100,000

781
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,081
100,000 ?

782
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:10,413
Yes, ma'am 100,000 for 10 pax.

783
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,513
Call them now.

784
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,688
Tell them that we're accepting the order.

785
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,326
Yes, ma'am.

786
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:29,906
Good morning.

787
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,176
What ?

788
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,012
You know what ?

789
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,615
I used to hate my brother
for send ng me here.

790
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,944
Co'z here you're not the boss.

791
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:46,256
True.

792
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:50,427
But now,

793
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,523
I thank him.

794
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:55,865
Because ?

795
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,167
Because,

796
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,126
if he hasn't sent me here,

797
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,294
I wouldn't have met you.

798
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,407
You got me already,

799
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,635
you don't have to flatter me.

800
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,870
It goes to show
that it isn't what I'm after for.

801
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,638
Are you saying you're in love with me ?

802
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:12,482
Maybe.

803
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,918
Co'z in-love is different
from being home s ck.

804
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,317
Gwen, if I feel like home sicked,

805
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,757
I would probably wish to be home.

806
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:26,463
But now,

807
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:31,697
I can see a life with you here.

808
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,178
Morning bad breath.

809
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:48,549
No.

810
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,326
You know, you're so beautiful but ...

811
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:51,955
damn !

812
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,164
Take care of it.

813
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,499
Yes, ma'am.

814
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,697
Here's the billing
for the remaining balance.

815
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,704
Just wait for our boss.

816
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,502
He'll be the one to givel the payment.

817
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:32,762
Beaut ful.

818
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,036
You ?

819
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,305
I'm beaut ful ?

820
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,168
You are beautiful.

821
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,942
You're playing tricks on me.

822
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,415
Playing tricks ?.

823
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,217
Why ?

824
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,115
I paid my down payment.

825
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,322
I'll be paying the balance.

826
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,587
Why didn't you tell me
that you're my client ?

827
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:08,130
If I have told you that
I'm you're cl ent,

828
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,091
would you reject me ?

829
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:11,968
Yes.

830
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:13,937
Why ?

831
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,438
Because ...

832
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,764
You told that you want someone ser ous.

833
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:19,467
I am ser ous.

834
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,213
Where are the guests ?

835
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,051
If I have told you that that 100,000
is for just one person

836
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:31,852
you'd probably wonder.

837
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,886
You are buying me.

838
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:37,587
I'm not buy ng you,

839
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,330
it's your food.

840
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,125
What do you need from me ?

841
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:49,439
One dance.

842
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,041
Are you going to give me a chance ?

843
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,545
Bro, it's 3 am here.

844
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,439
Come home, bro.

845
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:34,575
I Just got married.

846
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:37,053
What ?

847
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,731
What did your brother say ?

848
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:56,906
He's excited.

849
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,710
Really ?

850
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,111
He wasn't surprised ?

851
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:04,581
Not really.

852
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,182
He was shocked, though.

853
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:09,543
He never thought I'd marry again.

854
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,358
What would be his mpression on me ?

855
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,892
Chino s happy for me.

856
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,904
And because you make me happy,

857
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,568
you're okay with him.

858
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,581

00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,307
Does he know what happened between us ?

913
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,182
He wouldn't know if you won't tell him ?

914
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:56,411

00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,143

00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,292
Why don't you ask him ?

921
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:11,892
And why are you mad ?

922
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,262
What am I do ng to you ?

923
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:16,232
You have an intent on.

924
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,207
I'll find it out.

925
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:25,540
You know what ?
You are conceited.

926
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:28,110
The world isn't just about you.

927
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,811
What if I tell you
that I love your brother ?

928
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:32,981
Wouldn't you believe ?

929
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:36,726
Let's pray for that.

930
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,927
Are you guilty ?

931
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:41,425
Or maybe you're just skeptic because
I married your brother

932
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,032
and not you.

933
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,933
Maybe I have such low standards with women,

934
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:54,241
but my brother is a decent person.

935
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,442
He deserves a good woman.

936
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,047
So whatever you plan is,

937
00:51:58,348 --> 00:51:59,440
don't do it.

938
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,051
If you need money,
I've got lots of it.

939
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,486
Just stay away from my brother.

940
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,058
Eat it.

941
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:13,930
Here you go.

942
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,471
Excuse me.

943
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,100
Ya.
So I'm also excited to go.

944
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,269
I really wanna go there for a break.

945
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,150
What are you doing ?

946
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,647
You told me that
he accepted me already.

947
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,316
Yes, what happened ?

948
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,327
He insulted me.

949
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,496
He questioned my intention.

950
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,502
Sammy, I never ran after your money.

951
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,334
I, myself, even told you.

952
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,766
That we should sign
a pre-nuptial agreement, right ?

953
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:02,278
And you refused.

954
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,048
Honey, I'm sorry.

955
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:08,983
I don't know why Chino
said those things to you.

956
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:10,979
But don't worry about it.

957
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,712
I'll talk to him.

958
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,390
You are brothers.

959
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,545
I don't want to be in the middle.

960
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,427
Honey, you are my w fe.

961
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,322
He has to respect that.

962
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,065
If he can't do it,

963
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:26,799
then he should forget that we're brothers.

964
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,447
Chino.

965
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:42,949
Why are you being rude to my wife ?

966
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,180
Because she's not right for you.

967
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,722
Why ?
Do you know her to speak of her like that ?

968
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:53,622
Bro, you shouldn't marry the likes of Lani.

969
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,763
Why ? What kind of person's Lani
for you to judge her like that ?

970
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,668
Bro, there are a lot of women out there.

971
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:00,703
Why her ?

972
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:02,438
Why not her ?

973
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,230
Because you deserve better.

974
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:10,542
Chino, for years,
I put up with your cheap women

975
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,812
Women who bring trouble,
who chases you,

976
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:15,914
who mad for be ng fooled by you.

977
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,983
I am happy now.

978
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,149
I didn't feel this with Ella.

979
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,786
Can't you be happy for me ?

980
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,230
I love her.

981
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:31,834
You love her.

982
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:36,028
Bro, I hope you'd be happy
and that you won't get hurt.

983
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,433
I'm outt'a here.

984
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,242
I'd be hands off.

985
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:09,937
Hey.

986
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,140
What's wrong ?

987
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:15,701
Noth ng.

988
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,046
Just ...

989
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:21,274
thinking of my new sister in-law.

990
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,449
I was wonder ng about that.

991
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:27,523
Why ?

992
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,755
Co'z when you saw her earlier,

993
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:31,992
it's like as if you've seen a ghost.

994
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:37,925
No, I'm just really concerned for my brother.

995
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,637
I feel like,
marrying that g rl is a b g mistake

996
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,805
Why did you say that ?

997
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,501
That woman has a bad intention.

998
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,347
I can feel t.

999
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,648
You're making assumpt ons ?

1000
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,553
Unless ...

1001
00:55:58,488 --> 00:55:59,488
Unless ?

1002
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,991
Unless what you're saying has basis.

1003
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,193
Of course.

1004
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,590
My basis is she's a slut.

1005
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:09,765
You know that, right ?

1006
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,599
Since when did you become
d scriminating with sluts ?

1007
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:16,065
I mean,
you still love them right ?

1008
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,309
Where did that come from ?

1009
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,706
You know,
I don't understand.

1010
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,348
What's happening with people here ?

1011
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,550
I don't know what's happen ng to you.

1012
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:39,295
Let's just sleep.

1013
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,689
The weather is hot.

1014
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,559
It feels good to swim.

1015
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:16,398
Come on.

1016
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,026
Have you forgotten ?

1017
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,918
Lift the arm ad lift the leg

1018
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:44,651
That's it.
Go.

1019
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:48,423
Up and down.
And up and down.

1020
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,327
And up that's it.
Go dow, and up.

1021
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,093
Add your arm ladies, ad lift.

1022
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,267
Lower the arm,
lift the arm.

1023
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:00,699
2, 3 one more, very nice.

1024
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:05,444
And 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

1025
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:07,313
Hold.
Arms up.

1026
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,052
Hi.

1027
00:58:11,555 --> 00:58:13,113
So you enrolled here, too.

1028
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:14,823
Ya.

1029
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,186
Are you going somewhere after this ?

1030
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:22,298
No.

1031
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,419
You're not going out with Chino ?

1032
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:26,936
He's going somewhere.

1033
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:29,471
Let's have lunch ?

1034
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:32,875
I have errands to do.

1035
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,804
I thought you're not going
anywhere after this.

1036
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:41,348
Well, I just realized there is.

1037
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,251
Do we have a problem here, sis ?

1038
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:56,254
So ?
How's your sex with Chino ?

1039
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:03,763
You know, first love never dies.

1040
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,805
But for me,

1041
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:11,005
first sex is the best.

1042
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:16,042
Sammy loves you so much.

1043
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,518
Your life now s great.

1044
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:20,687
Why do you still have to do this ?

1045
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:22,791
Don't tell me,
that you're chang ng your mind.

1046
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,960
No.

1047
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,521
As for me,
I believe they're not ord nary people.

1048
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,992
I'm afra d that what we're doing
m ght bounce back at us.

1049
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:32,526
Don't be such a coward.

1050
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,001
We planned his for a year, right ?

1051
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,406
Why would you feel nervous now ?

1052
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,510
Don't tell me

1053
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:44,239
you're falling in-love with Chino.

1054
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,311
Lani, everyone falls n love.

1055
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,483
Everyone gets hurt.

1056
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,652
Don't you think t's time to move on ?

1057
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,522
You don't know what you're saying.

1058
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:58,453
You don't knowithe hardships
I've been through.

1059
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:00,653
Except for ...

1060
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:07,068
I've been thinking
that everything's okay now.

1061
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:08,771
We're okay.

1062
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,501
We might fail on this.

1063
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:15,872
Do you love him ?

1064
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,282
No.

1065
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,713
How much pesticide

1066
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:32,190
do you need
to get poisoned with that salad ?

1067
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:33,429
What do you mean ?

1068
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,491
Just make sure
that you're not ly ng.

1069
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:41,964
Co'z if not,

1070
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,540
your mouth might just get fizzy
with what you're eating.

1071
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,075
We're sisters.

1072
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,006
Allies.

1073
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,140
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

1074
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,550
I'll support you.

1075
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,188
Good.

1076
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:01,714
Eat more.

1077
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,856
Okay, this will really be the last.

1078
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:06,595
Taste this.

1079
01:01:08,565 --> 01:01:09,224
That's good babe.

1080
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,332
Ya.

1081
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,967
Wait, I'll do it.

1082
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:17,164
Check f it tastes good.

1083
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,139
Passed ?

1084
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,730
You know honey, the reason why
I end all my meetings early

1085
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,752
is because I go home with this goodness.

1086
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,792
Please ?
Let's not ru n other people's appetite.

1087
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,561
You know, Gwen ...

1088
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,159
Please attend to my brother's needs.

1089
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:45,157
He's too envious with me.

1090
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,931
I am not envious, bro.

1091
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,265
We were just raised up
to respect our food.

1092
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,972
Am I disrespecting your food ?

1093
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,236
What do you know ?

1094
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:58,427
You don't have breeding, right ?

1095
01:01:58,815 --> 01:01:59,815
Chino.

1096
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:00,916
Stop t.

1097
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,812
You look upon me so degradingly.

1098
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,520
Why ?
Are you clean ?

1099
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:05,788
Hon, it's okay.

1100
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:15,157
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

1101
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,463
Let's eat.
It's alright.

1102
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,573
Chino.

1103
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,005
I'm sorry, babe.

1104
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:31,426
I just can't stand be ng in the same room
with that woman.

1105
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,582
Chino, I need to tell you something.

1106
01:02:34,017 --> 01:02:35,882
I mean who the hell
does she think she is ?

1107
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,253
Chino please.

1108
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:40,523
Must unknowingly mess
with the Lee brothers

1109
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:44,233
What do you mean by that ?

1110
01:02:46,396 --> 01:02:50,127
Women in our lives either end up on cloud 9,
the basement

1111
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,433
or 6 feet under.

1112
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,301
Aren't you over-reacting ?

1113
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,573
I mean she seems okay.

1114
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,348
Okay ?
What do you mean by okay ?

1115
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,080
I had lunch with her.

1116
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:10,243
We were talking this afternoon.

1117
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,200
And what did she tell you ?

1118
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,489
Well, she loves your brother

1119
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:15,885
so give her a break.

1120
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,793
Gwen, I'm going to say this once, okay ?

1121
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,061
I don't want you see ng that woman.

1122
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,363
Stay away from her.

1123
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:36,378
Chino.

1124
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:41,517
Chino.

1125
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,121
What are you plann ng ?

1126
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:49,620
What am I do ng to you ?

1127
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:51,126
I rema n s lent,

1128
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,627
and you're like a faggot
who comes up here and talk a lot.

1129
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,996
You even dare to talk with Gwen.

1130
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:00,068
Why ?
Is it forbidden

1131
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,037
Don't you want her to know

1132
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,468
that you enjoyed more with me
than with her.

1133
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,175
You've got boring sex I fe with her, right ?

1134
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,279
I love Gwen.

1135
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:12,873
Stay away from her,
understand ?

1136
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,050
Understand ?

1137
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,418
Okay, you said it.

1138
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:19,655
Chino.

1139
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,488
What will Gwen do,

1140
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:28,560
if she sees us like this ?

1141
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,098
Ma'am, you're looking for Sir chino ?

1142
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:35,702
Yes.

1143
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:37,736
He went to the sauna room.

1144
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:39,474
Okay.

1145
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:43,312
Chino.

1146
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,181
Chino.

1147
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:50,519
I'm done.

1148
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:52,454
Now you can use t.

1149
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:06,328
I don't know what to do now.

1150
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:08,904
That's new.

1151
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:11,097
The br ll ant chairman of the board,

1152
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:12,671
doesn't know what to do ?

1153
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,002
Ian and Chino
don't seem to get along well.

1154
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:18,614
I feel like,

1155
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,449
I need to choose between them.

1156
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:24,548
Why do you have to choose ?

1157
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:26,752
If you can make both of them happy.

1158
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,415
How do I do that ?

1159
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:32,951
Just give them what they want.

1160
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,495
Like n video game,

1161
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,196
You should handle the joystick.

1162
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,230
How do I make
the two of them happy ?

1163
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,033
What are their guilty pleasures ?

1164
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,276
What are we doing here, bro ?

1165
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,085
Choose.

1166
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:00,022
Are yous serious ?

1167
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:02,391
Whichever ?

1168
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,458
Whichever.

1169
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,660
Whatever the price s ?

1170
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:06,728
Your choice.

1171
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:10,530
I know what's happening here.

1172
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,873
You're gonna take this out of my trust fund,
aren't you ?

1173
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:15,494
Just consider this as bonus.

1174
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,108
Okay.

1175
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,210
Miss, what's this ?

1176
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:25,145
It's the Volvo XC60

1177
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:26,341
XC60 ?

1178
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:27,549
Yes sir.

1179
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,818
- Wow !
- Hurry up, before I change my mind.

1180
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:30,910
I choose this one.

1181
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,740
And here's the key, Sir
so you could try it.

1182
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,521
Alright.
All yours.

1183
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,578
What's this ?

1184
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,542
Just a show of love.

1185
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:03,819
Beaut ful.

1186
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:05,754
You're still lovelier.

1187
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,482
Did you like it ?

1188
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,331
Nice car.

1189
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:52,134
Sorry, Lani.

1190
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,127
My taste changes.

1191
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,599
Oh come on, Chino.

1192
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,502
The first time you saw me,

1193
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:03,541
you got harder down there.

1194
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,182
Lani ...

1195
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:09,675
once I put spittle on it,

1196
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:12,754
I don't like t anymore.

1197
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,323
No, once you got your saliva on it

1198
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:17,851
you don't givel it away ?

1199
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:21,090
You are the first one

1200
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:23,554
So you have the right.

1201
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:29,432
Promise,
I'll make you happy just like before.

1202
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,042
You know, Lani,

1203
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:36,244
women like you,

1204
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:38,513
will just bring disease to me.

1205
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:04,940
Hon,

1206
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:12,540
You know I love you, right ?

1207
01:09:15,418 --> 01:09:17,818
I wanna spend the rest
of my I fe with you.

1208
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,021
Are you proposing to me ?

1209
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:44,779
Gwen ...

1210
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:50,945
will you marry me ?

1211
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:58,526
Hey, what's wrong ?

1212
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:02,410
Are you hav ng second thoughts ?

1213
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,137
I just need to do something, Chino.

1214
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:18,847
What s t ?

1215
01:10:21,284 --> 01:10:22,284
Chino ...

1216
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,221
It's okay.

1217
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,091
Of course, I'll marry you.

1218
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:34,490
I just playing hard to get.

1219
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,164
Yes.

1220
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:39,868
Yes, you'll marry me ?

1221
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,069
Yes.

1222
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,290
You're gonna givel me a heart attack,
you know that ?.

1223
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:48,944
I love you.

1224
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,480
I love you, too.

1225
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,572
Hold it,

1226
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:26,321
I'll just lower down the heater

1227
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:27,349
maybe it's too hot.

1228
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,418
It's not the water that you feel.

1229
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:33,720
But my heated up blood.

1230
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:37,917
Lani ...

1231
01:11:38,094 --> 01:11:39,174
Do you love Chino already ?

1232
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:41,529
You're getting married ?

1233
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,458
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

1234
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:48,994
You mean t's an accident ?

1235
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,399
A person doesn't fall n love by acc dent.

1236
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,245
Lani, Chino is a good person.

1237
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,179
Whatever happened between
the two of you before

1238
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:01,007
Forget about it.

1239
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:02,309
Forgive him.

1240
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:03,312
It happened already.

1241
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:04,619
You had everything.

1242
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,685
You were the one who got
a good like in America.

1243
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,690
What about me ?
What ?

1244
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,158
I got rotten in Angeles.

1245
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:15,160
You left me there.

1246
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,123
You owe me this one.

1247
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:19,527
I didn't mean to leave you there.

1248
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:21,698
I didn't wish to go to America

1249
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:22,971
and leave you and Ma.

1250
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,105
You're my sister.

1251
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,333
I'm just doing this
because I want to help you.

1252
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:27,649
But this is wrong already.

1253
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:28,673
This is too much.

1254
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:29,878
It isn't right.

1255
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,877
We're sisters.

1256
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:35,874
We're both stupid
when it comes to love.

1257
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,181
But do you know our difference ?

1258
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:39,421
I am just stupid.

1259
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,649
You're a traitor.

1260
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,216
If you'll continue your plan on Chino.

1261
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,460
That plan,

1262
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:46,895
I'm telling you,

1263
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:48,463
I'll tell everything to him.

1264
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:50,659
Are you threatening me ?

1265
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:55,600
If you're telling me that you accidentally
fell in-love with Chino,

1266
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:59,307
What if I tell you
that you acc dentally slipped

1267
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,339
and drown in jacuzzi.

1268
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:04,677
Be careful, sis.

1269
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:22,964
This is my last.

1270
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:27,802
You okay ?.

1271
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:30,738
How's the wine ?

1272
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:39,581
Bro.

1273
01:13:40,483 --> 01:13:41,711
I know who's you are with.

1274
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,252
She's familiar.

1275
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,987
Hold it.
Aren't you Chino's friend ?

1276
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:49,557
Yes, sir.

1277
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,259
Mon.

1278
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,560
Mon.

1279
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:55,558
I've seen her before.

1280
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:57,231
I just can't remember when ...

1281
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:58,967
When was that ?

1282
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,035
Seems like ...

1283
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,362
Let him be co'z he's drunk

1284
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,606
Hold it, bro.

1285
01:14:04,874 --> 01:14:05,874
She's my friend.

1286
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:07,008
Sam, let's go ...

1287
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:07,809
Sammy.

1288
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:08,805
Ya, it's okay.

1289
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:10,044
He's drunk.

1290
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,253
- You're brother, dude.
- He's drunk.

1291
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:14,114
He's Drunk,
Let him be.

1292
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:15,374
I felt hum I ated.

1293
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:17,152
Let me go.

1294
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,453
That's Chino's girl.

1295
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,752
Your brother has tasted her.

1296
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:34,402
Mon !

1297
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:38,907
Chino.

1298
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,766
Let's just talk outs de, bro.

1299
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:45,505
Hold t, what happened ?

1300
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:48,917
Mon was killed.

1301
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,579
And they were told that your brother
was the one who killed him ...

1302
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:52,687
What ?

1303
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,535
What does my brother has to do with this ?

1304
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:57,049
Mon was last seen drunk

1305
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:58,259
in an event.

1306
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:03,461
They were gossiping
that your brother had him killed.

1307
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:04,599
What ?

1308
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,325
Daniel, you know
that my brother won't do it.

1309
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:09,103
I'll talk to Mon's loved ones.

1310
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,736
Dude, maybe next time.

1311
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,532
They're still sensitive right now.

1312
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:16,941
Come on, I'll go with you.

1313
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,377
Let's go out guys.

1314
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:29,624
Bro ...

1315
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:32,691
What do you know about Mon's death ?

1316
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:35,263
What ?

1317
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:38,158
Mon's family believes

1318
01:15:38,434 --> 01:15:39,834
that you asked someone to kill him.

1319
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,236
Why would I do that ?

1320
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:46,766
Because of Ian ?

1321
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,703
Yes, I got mad ...

1322
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:53,171
He showed rudeness to my wife.

1323
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,380
But that's not a reason
to kill a person.

1324
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:01,115
Can't you see it, bro ?

1325
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:03,356
That woman brings bad luck to you.

1326
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:04,550
People are dying.

1327
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,786
And now you're a suspect ?

1328
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:09,864
Chino,

1329
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:12,600
people can talk all they want.

1330
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,563
But my conscience is clean.

1331
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:18,272
And Lani isn't a jinx to me.

1332
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:21,306
She's the best thing
that happened to me.

1333
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:23,711
And no one can tear us apart.

1334
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,247
Not even you.

1335
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:28,716
Lani, let's talk.

1336
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,681
We don't have anything to talk about.

1337
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,213
Lani, be careful with sammy.

1338
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:35,615
If he finds out everything,
it's going to be dangerous.

1339
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:38,353
You're interested even with sammy ?

1340
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,626
Yes, that's right, isn't it ?

1341
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,097
You're greedy.

1342
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:44,631
You want everything to be yours.

1343
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,993
If Sammy finds out about your
plan of revenge against Chino,

1344
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,370
you'll be damned.

1345
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:51,569
He should be scared of me.

1346
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,207
Even you.

1347
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:57,041
Co'z I wouldn't let you
take away Chino.

1348
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,173
I'll find a way

1349
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,012
to get him from you.

1350
01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:05,253
Hi, Gwen.

1351
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:06,554
We're going somewhere.

1352
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:08,790
I'll follow you.

1353
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:22,893
He's crazy over me.

1354
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:26,468
Like how Chino
got crazy over me before.

1355
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:28,934
Just wait.

1356
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:31,239
I'll take him away from you.

1357
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:46,751
What are we doing here ?

1358
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,165
I think it's time.

1359
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:56,838
Time ?

1360
01:17:58,207 --> 01:18:00,141
That we start a new family.

1361
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,343
You mean, baby ?

1362
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:08,379
We weren't thinking of a puppy.

1363
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:12,282
Don't you want to enjoy
our company first ?

1364
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:14,687
Just the two of us.

1365
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,560
Lani,

1366
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:21,729
honey ...

1367
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:24,332
you're still young.

1368
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:25,967
I'm not.

1369
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:29,264
I want to somehow

1370
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:31,801
be capable of chasing our kids.

1371
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:35,273
Not like I'm be ng assisted up walking.

1372
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,806
I don't want to have one for now.

1373
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:46,988
Why ?

1374
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:48,656
I'm not yet ready.

1375
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:52,526
What do you need to be ready ?

1376
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:56,864
Time.

1377
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,067
We're okay.

1378
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,460
All we need is a child.

1379
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:05,700
You're not the one
who's going to give birth ?

1380
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:08,006
You're not the one
who'll get pregnant.

1381
01:19:09,545 --> 01:19:10,545
Hi, Sir.
Hi, Ma'am.

1382
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:11,953
What are you looking for ?

1383
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:15,082
We're talking,
don't butt in.

1384
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:16,451
I'm sorry, sir.

1385
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:30,190
What's up, man ?

1386
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,865
Chino, how's it going ?

1387
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,398
Hey, bro.

1388
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:33,065
Hi.

1389
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:34,335
Hi, Gwen.

1390
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:37,266
Dude, haven't you heard ?

1391
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,301
There's already a suspect
in Mon's murder.

1392
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:42,476
You're brother is off the hook.

1393
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,772
Who killed Mon ?

1394
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,380
It's a senseless killing.

1395
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,306
An addict who picked on Mon.

1396
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:49,637
He was a target for robbery.

1397
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:50,685
Then he got into it.

1398
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:52,519
Oh, babe.

1399
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:54,568
I feel bad,
for assum ng that it was my brother.

1400
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,855
You were so doubtful about him.

1401
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:58,226
He's thinking too much.

1402
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,118
That people has bad intentions.

1403
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:03,462
That's why I don't know what s t
that you like about my friend.

1404
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:05,726
I don't know, too.

1405
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:08,002
Really ?

1406
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:08,568
Ya,

1407
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:10,529
You're the one who's crazy about me.

1408
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:11,706
What ?

1409
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,131
It's you who's saying a lot of things.

1410
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:17,646
Have you been here that long ?

1411
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:18,738
Yes.
We've been dancing

1412
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:20,847
- Now we're just relaxig
"Chino, help me. Your brother will kill me."

1413
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,083
Oh my god.

1414
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:26,812
We should've been here early. We'll actually,
we got caught in heavy traffic going here ...

1415
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:27,989
And then had to put some ...

1416
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,990
Excuse me, babe.

1417
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:30,718
You don't mind if I step out a bit ?

1418
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:31,615
Why ?

1419
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:33,207
My friend has an emergency.

1420
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:34,896
I'll just go there.

1421
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:35,997
Where ?

1422
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:37,912
Bro, I'll take care of her.

1423
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,524
I'll bring Gwen home.

1424
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:40,661
- Are you sure ?
- I'll come back for you.

1425
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:41,501
I'll take care of her.

1426
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:42,703
I'll just go back.

1427
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:43,304
Okay.

1428
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:43,936
Okay.

1429
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,039
It's okay.

1430
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:49,576
Gwen, don't worry.
I'll take care of you.

1431
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:51,245
Let's have one drink and then ...

1432
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:54,482
Guys, cheers !

1433
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,192
What are you doing there ?

1434
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,534
What happened to you ?

1435
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:16,560
Your brother hurt me.

1436
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:20,875
Why ?

1437
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,767
He wants to have a baby.

1438
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,475
I told him that I'm not ready yet.

1439
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,349
He got pissed off on me.

1440
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:32,820
We argued.

1441
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:34,488
He hurt me.

1442
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:36,157
Hurt ?

1443
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:40,418
You don't seem like you got hurt.

1444
01:21:41,797 --> 01:21:42,797
What's your drama ?

1445
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:57,411
Oh my god.

1446
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:58,946
Come on.

1447
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:01,508
Get up, Lani.
Come on.

1448
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:05,553
Slowly.

1449
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:15,055
"Do you know what Chino's
doing with me right ow ?"

1450
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:16,697
O, Gwen.

1451
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:19,766
Can you drive me home ?

1452
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,069
Come on.
Let's have some fun and dance.

1453
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,498
Sorry, I have an emergency.

1454
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:25,139
One drink, please.

1455
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:26,587
Never mind,
I'll just take a cab.

1456
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:28,435
Gwen, Chino told me
to take care of you.

1457
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:30,539
He told me to bring you home.

1458
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,332
Gwen.

1459
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:12,405
"Chino, if you truly love lani,
I will not get in the way."

1460
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:22,356
Hey, listen up.

1461
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:28,856
I would like to propose a toast.

1462
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:31,298
Okay ?

1463
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:34,301
Baby, stand up.

1464
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:42,141
To the best woman n the world ...

1465
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:46,274
To the love of my life ...

1466
01:24:46,982 --> 01:24:47,982
Best cook ...

1467
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:50,551
Best lover ...

1468
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:51,685
Enough.

1469
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:56,957
Hey.

1470
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,052
My little brother !

1471
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,495
You know my brother, ya ?

1472
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:04,632
Chino.

1473
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:06,530
I love him so much, too.

1474
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:13,196
I stood up as your parent
since you were a kid.

1475
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:16,609
I'll do anything for you brother.

1476
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:20,746
You're late.

1477
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:22,440
Come on, p ck up, pick up.

1478
01:25:22,918 --> 01:25:23,918
Join us.

1479
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,219
Bobby.

1480
01:25:26,822 --> 01:25:27,822
Bobby ...

1481
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:29,417
Good friend Bobby.

1482
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,721
Chino, Lani.
Take him upstairs.

1483
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:32,526
Come on.

1484
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:33,158
Come on.

1485
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:34,495
Come on, bro.

1486
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:35,127
No, wait.

1487
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:35,820
- Sammy let's go.
- That's enough

1488
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,431
- Come on.
- Let's go Bro ...

1489
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:38,732
Come on.

1490
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:50,611
Where's Gwen ?

1491
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:54,615
She's gone.

1492
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:56,183
Why ?

1493
01:25:57,853 --> 01:25:59,047
She found out about us.

1494
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,018
Mom ...

1495
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:00,780
Since your new family
brought you to America,

1496
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,280
Lani didn't stop finding some ways

1497
01:27:04,486 --> 01:27:05,486
to follow you there.

1498
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,087
She sought the help of foundations

1499
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:11,517
that might help locate your father.

1500
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:14,058
But everything failed.

1501
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:19,064
I was forb dden by the social worker
to communicate with you.

1502
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:22,264
They told me that ...

1503
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:27,000
it'll be better to focus on my new family

1504
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,869
so I could easily adjust.

1505
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:32,980
I'm sorry.

1506
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,216
I understand you, dear.

1507
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,857
I should be the one
who should ask for forgiveness.

1508
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:48,091
I was forced to have you adopted.

1509
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:52,291
I can't raise two kids at that time.

1510
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:56,070
But Lani,

1511
01:27:57,339 --> 01:28:00,308
she didn't stop to reach her dream.

1512
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:04,070
Spent her whole time
on the Internet.

1513
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:06,872
Hoping to find a man

1514
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:08,573
who will take her abroad.

1515
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:11,982
I don't know with your sister.

1516
01:28:13,254 --> 01:28:14,585
Her weakness is a man.

1517
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:22,857
Mom, I'm nervous for Lani.

1518
01:28:24,566 --> 01:28:28,627
She might get into deep trouble
wh le doing her revenge on Chino.

1519
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:32,603
She lost her baby
because of Chino's brother.

1520
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:35,375
Those rich people are animals.

1521
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:38,045
They hit your sister like a cat.

1522
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:39,947
Mom, hold it.

1523
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:43,914
You mean Lani got pregnant.

1524
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:46,681
Didn't she tell you ?

1525
01:28:59,768 --> 01:29:00,768
Chino.

1526
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,277
Babe.

1527
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:14,381
I'm sorry.

1528
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,420
I'm sorry.

1529
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:25,559
Gwen,

1530
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:26,593
Gwen, I messed up.

1531
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:27,728
I messed up big.

1532
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:31,799
Look. I ...

1533
01:29:34,436 --> 01:29:35,767
I don't know where to start.

1534
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:38,937
I don't know how to tell you

1535
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:40,507
in a way that you
wouldn't get hurt.

1536
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,903
I'll admit that Ian
and I has history.

1537
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:47,143
And the reason why I know

1538
01:29:47,282 --> 01:29:48,806
she's one of them girls because

1539
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,081
I used to mess around with her

1540
01:29:56,091 --> 01:29:57,581
a long, long time ago.

1541
01:29:59,828 --> 01:30:00,692
But I promise you,

1542
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:02,353
It didn't mean anything, Gwen.

1543
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:08,362
Babe, I'm really, really sorry
for my ndiscretion with her

1544
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:11,027
I know and you witness it.

1545
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,134
If you have done
something wrong,

1546
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:16,476
I've got a b gger
m stake than you.

1547
01:30:16,678 --> 01:30:17,770
No, babe,
you didn't do anything wrong.

1548
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:18,435
This is all me.

1549
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,047
I know what you're talking about.

1550
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:29,650
I know it because she's my sister.

1551
01:30:31,059 --> 01:30:32,059
Sister ?

1552
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:35,362
Hold on.

1553
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:37,362
Gwen, what are you saying ?

1554
01:30:46,975 --> 01:30:48,704
Chino, we're not just sisters.

1555
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:52,172
We're the best of friends.

1556
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:59,284
We lost touch until a year ago.

1557
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:02,556
A year ago.

1558
01:31:06,728 --> 01:31:07,786
I got a call from her,

1559
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:09,029
she told me,

1560
01:31:10,265 --> 01:31:12,756
she wants to get back to the man
who cheated on her.

1561
01:31:15,737 --> 01:31:16,897
I felt bad for her.

1562
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:22,135
I thought that maybe
it's the only way to make it up to her.

1563
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:29,283
So I looked for you.

1564
01:31:32,554 --> 01:31:33,554
The plan is ...

1565
01:31:36,191 --> 01:31:38,022
to make you fall n love with me.

1566
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:42,156
And then after that,
I'll hurt you.

1567
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:50,137
But ...

1568
01:31:50,905 --> 01:31:52,839
But I fell in love with you.

1569
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:57,611
Gwen,

1570
01:32:00,148 --> 01:32:01,911
Your sister s mad at me.

1571
01:32:03,151 --> 01:32:05,085
Why did she marry my brother ?

1572
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:09,753
Because she got pregnant before,
didn't you know that ?

1573
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:11,391
You are the father,

1574
01:32:12,727 --> 01:32:14,167
And your brother is the reason why ...

1575
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:18,490
I got Lani pregnant ?

1576
01:32:20,068 --> 01:32:21,068
You didn't know ?

1577
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:23,764
Your brother was the reason
why she lost the baby.

1578
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,542
Rise and shine.

1579
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:35,682
What time is it ?

1580
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:37,851
Pack up your things.

1581
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:40,687
Why ?

1582
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,248
We're hav ng our second honeymoon

1583
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:52,999
You, me,
just the trees and cr ckets.

1584
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:59,098
No cellphone, no internet,
no one will disturb us.

1585
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:02,406
Why do we have to go far ?

1586
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:05,452
For us not to be stressed.

1587
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:08,308
So we could have a good vacation.

1588
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:14,179
Sammy started with foul words.

1589
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:18,215
He would call me all sorts of names.

1590
01:33:19,861 --> 01:33:22,523
Until he slaps me sometimes.

1591
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:26,193
It depends on his moods.

1592
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,831
If he has good mood,
it would be rough sex.

1593
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:33,071
If he's in bad mood,

1594
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:37,237
he becomes a sadist.

1595
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:42,047
He taught me how to use coca ne.

1596
01:33:43,418 --> 01:33:45,784
He sells me to his friends.

1597
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:47,948
I got hooked up with drugs.

1598
01:33:48,156 --> 01:33:49,156
Because.

1599
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:53,790
That's my only way to escape
with what I'm going through.

1600
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,896
I want to d e a couple of times.

1601
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:06,263
He would chain me.

1602
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,246
Piss on my face.

1603
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:19,543
That's why when Papa died,

1604
01:34:20,455 --> 01:34:24,118
I know he was the one
who called PDEA to arrest me.

1605
01:34:25,526 --> 01:34:27,960
Because he doesn't want anyone
to partake the inher tance.

1606
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:33,629
Lani is with sammy right now.

1607
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:34,835
I'm worried.

1608
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:41,571
He takes me to an isolated place.

1609
01:34:41,943 --> 01:34:44,207
Along with other girls
who taste his sadism.

1610
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:46,545
A hidden place where ...

1611
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:48,343
No one can hear us.

1612
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:50,611
And no one will witness.

1613
01:35:07,969 --> 01:35:09,061
This is nice, right ?

1614
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,196
It's just that it's too hidden.

1615
01:35:15,576 --> 01:35:17,271
Even if we scream here,

1616
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:18,872
no one will hear us.

1617
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:33,493
What if we're too late ?

1618
01:35:52,947 --> 01:35:53,947
Honey ?

1619
01:36:01,823 --> 01:36:03,017
Let's go downstairs.

1620
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:06,488
Okay, I'll follow.

1621
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:08,929
Okay.

1622
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:38,581
You really think I didn't know that you and your
sister are making fool of me and my brother.

1623
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:48,931
Do you think I'm stupid ?

1624
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,717
I refused to accept
what I saw.

1625
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:11,958
But I started ...

1626
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:17,429
To open
my eyes and ears.

1627
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:20,466
He should be scared of me.
You should, too.

1628
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:24,803
Co'z I wouldn't let you
take Chino away from me.

1629
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:27,731
I'll do everything to get him from you.

1630
01:37:31,646 --> 01:37:34,342
Until I saw with my very own eyes.

1631
01:37:43,257 --> 01:37:44,257
Damn you.

1632
01:37:45,293 --> 01:37:47,261
You are the only woman I loved.

1633
01:37:49,497 --> 01:37:50,725
Do you know that ?

1634
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,903
How does my brother
make out with you ?

1635
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:07,239
Like this ?

1636
01:38:11,953 --> 01:38:13,113
Like this ?

1637
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:17,821
Who's better ?

1638
01:38:19,327 --> 01:38:20,351
Him or me ?

1639
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:27,567
Who ?

1640
01:38:34,942 --> 01:38:36,807
Sammy, that's enough.

1641
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,970
How does he kiss you ?

1642
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:44,375
How does he kiss you ?

1643
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:46,649

1646
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:12,737
Your brother !

1647
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:13,880
He's hurting me !

1648
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:14,505
Where is he ?

1649
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:15,943
He's inside the house.

1650
01:39:33,701 --> 01:39:34,701
Bro !

1651
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:37,637
Bro, I know now everything.

1652
01:39:38,072 --> 01:39:39,096
Bro, let's talk.

1653
01:39:40,675 --> 01:39:41,675
Bro !

1654
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:42,835
Bro don't do this.

1655
01:39:43,511 --> 01:39:44,808
This is all my fault.

1656
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:48,406
Don't ruin your life
because of me.

1657
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:51,317
Bro !

1658
01:39:51,519 --> 01:39:52,519
Chino !

1659
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:57,490
What are you doing ?

1660
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:59,922
I'm glad you came, bro.

1661
01:40:00,428 --> 01:40:03,864
Did you know that these sisters
have been making a fool out of us ?

1662
01:40:04,198 --> 01:40:05,665
Don't tell me you came here for her.

1663
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:07,727
To save this whore.

1664
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:09,535
I came for you.

1665
01:40:10,638 --> 01:40:11,969
Why are you doing this ?

1666
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:13,299
This is enough.
This is wrong.

1667
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:14,068
Don't do this.

1668
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:16,536
You know,
since you were a kid

1669
01:40:17,078 --> 01:40:19,706
I promised mom,
that I'd take care of you.

1670
01:40:20,281 --> 01:40:21,908
That's why I'm tell ng you.

1671
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:24,577
No one can get
between the two of us.

1672
01:40:24,752 --> 01:40:25,446
I know that, bro.

1673
01:40:25,586 --> 01:40:26,416
But what you're doing sn't right ...

1674
01:40:26,554 --> 01:40:27,646
It isn't really right !

1675
01:40:28,222 --> 01:40:29,222
Co'z I wouldn't let

1676
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:32,823
that these two will get between us.

1677
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,851
That's why they should get out of our way.

1678
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:36,686
