1
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,553
Greetings, Your Majesty

2
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,550
Yesterday, I proposed a decree

3
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,115
for war against Liu Bei and Sun Quan

4
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,834
Has Your Majesty approved the decree?

5
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,993
The Prime Minister has just beaten back the Northern Wu Wan

6
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,551
Our troops and people need respite

7
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,113
The insurgents Sun and Liu

8
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,231
are ruling their own regimes down South

9
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,755
They plot against Your Majesty's Court

10
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,678
If they are not eliminated in time,

11
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,351
Your Majesty's Han Court, might well be theirs

12
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,874
Prime Minister,

13
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,031
please let me consider this further

14
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,839
How much further must Your Majesty consider?

15
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,592
I have waged wars across the land

16
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,711
Tens of thousands of soldiers have perished on the battlefields,

17
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,633
all for the sake of The Great Han Empire

18
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,630
Does Your Majesty still remember your exile?

19
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,274
Which, if any, among your Royal relatives rescued You?

20
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,790
I wonder, to this day,

21
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,958
if I had not eliminated the traitors,

22
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,111
how many more would claim the throne for themselves?

23
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,470
I hereby decree that

24
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,878
Prime Minister Cao Cao

25
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,116
be commissioned as the Commander of the Imperial Army

26
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,033
and go forth to pacify the South

27
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,152
Thank you, Your Majesty

28
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,630
Senator Kong Rong wishes to speak

29
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,309
Liu Bei is Your Majesty's uncle,

30
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,119
and Sun Quan is the third-generation heir to the Dukedom of Wu

31
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,396
They have no intent to rebel

32
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,513
Whereas you, Prime Minister,

33
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,755
are not only seizing all the powers of state,

34
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,638
but also intend to mobilize the entire army

35
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,957
There is no justifiable reason for your war!

36
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,117
Though you have solemnly vowed yourself

37
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,510
loyal to His Majesty's Court,

38
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,559
you will not be able to convince everyone!

39
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,315
The next one to put down a rebellion,
may not be you, Prime Minister,

40
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,999
but Liu Bei

41
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,679
and Sun Quan!

42
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,119
He is the first sacrifice

43
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,954
I thank the Prime Minister for this wine

44
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,429
Begin

45
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,233
Form up!

46
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,838
Watch it

47
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,155
My Lord

48
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,349
Zilong!

49
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,277
My Lord

50
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,350
You have returned

51
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,393
Our men made all possible efforts to hold our ground

52
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,790
until the last minute before abandoning the town

53
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,790
Luckily, most of the peasants have already fled

54
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,995
through the valley

55
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,349
My Lord!

56
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,318
The two ladies and the Young Master

57
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,232
are still trapped in the village

58
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,271
My ladies, please be careful

59
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,871
Don't cry

60
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,030
General Zhang

61
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,708
Chief Strategist, how does the situation look?

62
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,517
Cao Cao's pursuing forces are greater than anticipated

63
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,592
The cavalry vanguard will arrive at any moment

64
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,434
The Cao cavalry will use

65
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,391
a wedge formation to attack

66
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,312
We will reflect the light into their eyes to hold them off

67
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,550
Remember, the refugees need

68
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,796
at least an hour to retreat

69
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,479
We need a thousand more soldiers

70
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,073
for the second line of defense!

71
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,673
Leave it to me

72
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,869
Alright

73
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,588
Forward

74
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,790
My Lord

75
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,030
Zhu-ge Liang,

76
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,355
the peasants are moving slowly

77
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,268
It looks like they will need at least another four hours

78
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,599
We urgently need a thousand soldiers from here

79
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,153
Go aid General Zhang

80
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,436
That way Cao Cao cannot chase them

81
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,234
The peasants can be left to themselves

82
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,913
Cao Cao intends to make us surrender

83
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,950
He will not kill them

84
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,993
No! As you can see,

85
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,596
the elderly, the women, and the children all need our help

86
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,351
My Lord,

87
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,869
these peasants are dragging us down

88
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,198
To succeed, you have to set aside these trivial matters

89
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,352
These are Han people

90
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,433
They followed us only to escape from Cao Cao's regime

91
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,512
If we cannot offer protection to the civilians

92
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,359
then what is the meaning of this war?

93
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,196
I will find Guan Yu

94
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,594
Go and help my Lord

95
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,477
Sister!

96
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,237
Quickly! Bring the horse for My Lady

97
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,436
That looks like Liu Bei's family

98
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,352
Go get the baby!

99
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,395
My Lady!

100
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,359
General Zhao,

101
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,918
he is my Lord's only flesh and blood

102
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,277
He must not fall into enemy hands!

103
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,436
Rest assured, My Lady

104
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,632
I will take you and the young Master to my Lord

105
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,193
Let's go! Get on the horse!

106
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,796
My Lady, quickly!

107
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,554
My Lady!

108
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,755
General!

109
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,874
My Lady!

110
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,949
Step apart!

111
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,677
Flip the shields!

112
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,510
Attack!

113
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,589
Let's go!

114
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,119
Bailong!

115
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,311
Chief Strategist,

116
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,119
Where are our reinforcements?

117
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,390
Who is that man?

118
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,155
Zhao Zilong of Changshan

119
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,313
Why is there no such brave warrior under my command?

120
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,189
General Zhao

121
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,869
Zilong

122
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,476
Retreat!

123
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,073
We can still fight!

124
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,919
Why are we giving up so easily?!

125
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,710
We are greatly outnumbered by the enemy

126
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,279
If we can't protect the refugees,

127
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,475
our losses will be worse

128
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,430
Attention!

129
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,959
Protect the refugees!

130
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,712
It's an order!

131
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,910
Brother,

132
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,275
go quickly!

133
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,359
Leave! Protect the refugees!

134
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,870
Zilong, take the Young Master!

135
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,633
Retreat!

136
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,073
Attention, Third Battalion! Hold the line!

137
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,397
Protect the retreating refugees!

138
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,837
Quick!

139
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,751
Charge!

140
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,079
Second battalion, go!

141
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,828
Third battalion, get ready!

142
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,355
My lord

143
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,112
I brought the Young Master back

144
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,399
but the two ladies already...

145
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,030
Zilong

146
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,237
Get up...

147
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,269
Prime Minister!

148
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,630
Liu Bei is vulnerable

149
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,229
Look, the cowards have all fled

150
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,272
Dead bodies lie everywhere

151
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,034
The rest ran for their lives!

152
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,791
There is only one man still fighting

153
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,553
Surrender, and your life will be spared!

154
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,113
Kneel down!

155
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,637
Do not be so rude!

156
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,029
General Guan Yu,

157
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,955
a wise man chooses his Lord carefully

158
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,271
Why do you continue to serve Liu Bei?

159
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,394
You still won't kneel!

160
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,549
Protect the Prime Minster! Kill him!

161
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,711
Nobody move!

162
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,518
Prime Minister, why?

163
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,636
If he wanted to kill me, he already would have

164
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,873
Guan Yu cannot stab a man from behind

165
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,315
Liu Bei has lost many battles,

166
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,835
yet so many talented men remain loyal to him

167
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,959
One day, they will all serve under my command

168
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,790
I have suffered a lifetime of failures

169
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,555
This isn't the worst one

170
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,679
Cao Cao thinks he holds the Dynasty's fate in his hands

171
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,757
So long as I live and breathe

172
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,872
I will fight to end his crimes

173
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,639
against the Han Court

174
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,314
My Lord, I will go to the state of Wu tonight,

175
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,118
to ask for Sun Quan's support

176
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,595
Sun Quan?

177
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,755
Against Cao Cao? I wonder if he is strong enough

178
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,952
to fight an enemy as fierce as Cao Cao

179
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,952
Though Sun Quan is young,

180
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,555
he bears great ambitions within

181
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,030
For generations, the Sun Clan has ruled the South

182
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,875
They have the wealth and strength to fight Cao Cao

183
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,636
Wu needs us just as much as we need Wu

184
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,469
If our alliance succeeds, and we defeat Cao Cao,

185
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,358
then Cao Cao will definitely retreat back North

186
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,597
We can then go West and rebuild our forces

187
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,398
Once we are in control of the West,

188
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,670
Cao Cao will control the North, and Sun Quan, the South

189
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,075
We will form a power triangle

190
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,874
This division of power is the only way to stop Cao Cao

191
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,359
My Lord, please rest assured

192
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,314
Are you confident you can convince him?

193
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,318
Eat some more

194
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,790
The road to Wu is long, and you will need energy

195
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,195
Prime Minister, the surrendered generals,

196
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,436
Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, are here

197
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,589
These two men are untrustworthy

198
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,872
Please be cautious

199
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,552
I trust those who are of use to me

200
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,949
Greetings, Your Highness!

201
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,834
Rise

202
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,270
How many ships and men have you brought with you?

203
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,039
We have with us three hundred thousand naval troops

204
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,713
and more than two thousand

205
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,438
battleships and boats of various sizes

206
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,755
Great!

207
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,030
Now we can be

208
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,068
tigers that swim!

209
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,472
Your Highness,

210
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,592
here is our letter of surrender

211
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,115
General Cai,

212
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,950
I see many grammatical errors here

213
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,792
I hope your military strategies

214
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,395
are not as poor as your command of literature

215
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,951
I hear you have frequent exchanges

216
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,111
with the State of Wu

217
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,115
Your Highness,

218
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,391
I have declared war on Wu many times

219
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,710
These so called exchanges are limited to only this

220
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,473
No need to explain

221
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,875
What is this?

222
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,638
This is a map of Wu that I drew

223
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,268
taking great pains to be precise

224
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,474
General Cai,

225
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,877
you took great pains indeed

226
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,676
Your Highness,

227
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,916
Liu Bei has fled to Xiakou in defeat

228
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,071
If he eventually joins forces

229
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,474
with Sun Quan's Wu clan,

230
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,550
then I fear that...

231
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,631
Then isn't that in our best interest?

232
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,796
If Sun Quan forms an alliance with Liu Bei,

233
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,149
then he is harbouring a traitor

234
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,918
and rebelling against the Royal Court,

235
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,118
which justifies our war

236
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,115
Liu Bei, a shoe weaving Royal uncle,

237
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,834
His whole life is a failure

238
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,195
Sun Quan

239
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,115
is a young upstart with no achievements

240
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,159
When a loser join forces with a coward...

241
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,233
what can they accomplish?

242
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,268
Though my Lord is young,

243
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,714
he shows wisdom beyond his years

244
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,836
Speak frankly and don't hold back

245
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,316
The senior advisors will be your biggest obstacle

246
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,270
You say we can fight this war? We can't!

247
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,109
Hopefully,

248
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,312
he has some good strategies to use against Cao Cao

249
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,950
This time around, Cao Cao is determined to fight

250
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,157
We are gravely outnumbered

251
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,556
How could we ever hope to fight this war?

252
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,111
We cannot fight!

253
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,430
Greetings, Your Highness

254
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,708
Mr. Zhu-ge,

255
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,518
I hear that Cao Cao

256
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,195
beat Liu Bei into the mud at Xinye?

257
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,118
The defeat at Xinye was due to my Lord's noble heart

258
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,271
He did not abandon the thousands of refugees

259
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,118
who followed our troops and slowed down our retreat

260
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,032
How large is Cao Cao's army?

261
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,719
A ruthless army of eight hundred thousand

262
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,389
is invading from both land and water

263
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,591
Cao Cao's real target is not to defeat Liu Bei

264
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,599
but to conquer Wu!

265
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,038
Your Highness governs the vast Southland,

266
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,548
and has many extraordinary gentlemen in your court

267
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,870
If you are determined to oppose Cao Cao's invasion,

268
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,155
then please prepare for war!

269
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,991
My Lord!

270
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,474
Do not fight!

271
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,999
When the late Duke was still alive,

272
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,991
he always told me

273
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,872
that nothing is more important

274
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,032
than the peace of Wu's people!

275
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,832
We cannot fight, my Lord.

276
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,630
That's right. To surrender is not so bad

277
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,599
For the cowardly, in fact, the earlier the better

278
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,115
That way everyone can stop worrying

279
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,629
If that is the case,

280
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,548
then why didn't Liu Bei surrender?

281
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,594
Confucius spoke of giving oneself to justice,

282
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,994
and Mencius spoke of sacrificing for righteousness

283
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,276
Surrendering is not a matter of victory or defeat,

284
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,078
but rather one of virtue!

285
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,112
Cao Cao, the self-proclaimed Prime Minister,

286
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,471
controls the Han Emperor, and
fabricates His Majesty's commands

287
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,593
If he conquers the Southland, he will surely usurp the throne

288
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,112
If we surrender to Cao Cao, then we would be aiding a tyrant

289
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,118
Lord Mayor Liu Bei is of His Majesty's Royal Family

290
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,878
His wisdom is known to the world and respected by the people

291
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,519
If a noble man, who has been loyal to the Han court all his life,

292
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,432
fails to succeed, then that is fate

293
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,432
But, how could he surrender to Cao Cao?

294
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,755
That would be

295
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,599
an unbearable shame!

296
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,080
However, it is fine for Your Highness to surrender

297
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,711
At least, you will be able to keep your life and possessions

298
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,030
At Cao Cao's mercy,

299
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,674
he may let you remain as the ruler of the Southland

300
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,071
So why not?

301
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,877
You are saying I am nothing compared to Liu Bei?

302
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,870
No,

303
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,639
Your Highness shows an outstanding brilliance

304
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,190
greater than that of most and akin to that of Lord Liu

305
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,909
Your Highness is capable of ruling the vast Southland

306
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,436
This alone, is a major advantage over Lord Liu

307
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,636
My Lord,

308
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,716
Mister Zhu-ge has come before you

309
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,836
with a plan for fighting Cao Cao

310
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,873
It would not hurt to hear him out

311
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,353
Though my Lord suffered a recent defeat,

312
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,671
we still have Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun,

313
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,354
as well as the Navy that they command
with at least ten thousand men

314
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,194
If we join forces with the elite generals and troops of Wu,

315
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,960
the alliance will strengthen us both

316
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,993
Although Cao Cao's military outnumbers ours,

317
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,071
more than half of his troops only just surrendered to him

318
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,559
and are not entirely trustworthy

319
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,473
They have traveled over one hundred miles every day

320
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,715
They are exhausted

321
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,117
As the saying goes, a worn spear
cannot even penetrate a thin cloth

322
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,351
Moreover, Northerners are not used to the Southern terrain,

323
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,669
and they have no naval experience

324
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,190
Their abrupt invasion is destined to result in failure

325
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,792
You make well reasoned points

326
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,509
My Lord,

327
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,555
please do not fall into Zhu-ge's traps!

328
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,795
We cannot justify fighting

329
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,076
against Prime Minister Cao, My Lord!

330
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,072
Our alliance with Liu Bei

331
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,753
will only justify Cao Cao's war

332
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,478
It is better to take Liu Bei captive

333
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,113
and turn him over as a gift to Cao Cao!

334
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,998
No! We shall first fight, then surrender

335
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,555
So that we leave Cao Cao with a bitter taste

336
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,032
One hundred thousand against eight hundred thousand!

337
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,873
What kind of a war is this!?

338
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,428
Cowards!

339
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,075
All of you are shameless cowards!

340
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,998
How dare you!

341
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,072
We cannot fight

342
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,310
Your Highness,

343
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,714
I know you have been concealing your abilities

344
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,638
The sword had been hidden away for too long

345
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,269
Now is the time to draw the blade

346
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,871
My Lord, this Zhu-ge Liang

347
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,315
is determined to drag us into trouble!

348
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,118
Don't! My Lord!

349
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,031
Speak no more!

350
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,153
I have heard this far too many times!

351
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,152
Let me think it through

352
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,631
Let me think...

353
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,076
How beautiful!

354
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,550
This really is heaven on earth!

355
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,274
Unfortunately, with the arrival of Cao's regime,

356
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,590
all of this beauty will soon turn to ash

357
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,190
Your words had almost persuaded his Lordship

358
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,875
For the alliance to happen,

359
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,270
I only need to persuade one other person

360
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,028
Zhou Yu. Viceroy Zhou

361
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,877
Exactly!

362
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,197
The Duke regards him as his own older brother

363
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,829
The Late Duke had also said,

364
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,678
for internal affairs, seek Zhang Zhao

365
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,319
For foreign affairs, seek Zhou Yu

366
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,833
He is now encamped at Red Cliff

367
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,194
He is the right one to seek

368
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,189
Stop!

369
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,070
Give it to me!

370
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,873
Are you not capable of holding a spear?

371
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,278
There must be power within every stroke!

372
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,468
One more time!

373
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,349
Stab!

374
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,471
Slash!

375
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,675
Strike!

376
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,910
Swing!

377
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,076
Stab!

378
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,036
Slash!

379
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,196
Strike!

380
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,197
Swing!

381
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,752
Mister Zhu-ge, the Viceroy is over there

382
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,278
Form up!

383
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,790
One other wing

384
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,714
The Goose Formation

385
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,074
Not bad

386
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,112
A pity that it is outdated

387
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,316
Give it to me

388
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,029
Your Honor!

389
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,079
You try

390
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,114
Thank you

391
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,952
Your Honor!

392
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,029
My family's water buffalo

393
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,033
was stolen from the fields near the barracks

394
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,430
Some people saw...

395
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,758
Your Honor, this is Mr. Zhu-ge Liang

396
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,229
Greetings, Viceroy Zhou

397
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,635
Greetings

398
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,348
Why carry a fan on a cold day like this?

399
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,398
It helps me remain calm

400
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,950
It's the one old habit I cannot give up

401
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,358
You do not look like an anxious person

402
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,074
This way

403
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,077
What are you laughing at?

404
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,555
I am not laughing, but appreciating

405
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,108
I am appreciating that these soldiers

406
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,198
know not only how to fight, but also how to appreciate music

407
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,353
You are knowledgeable in the art of war

408
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,431
Just a little

409
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,274
Yet you say my formations are outdated

410
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,429
No man but you

411
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,471
can hear me from that far away

412
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,793
I have sharp hearing

413
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,269
This way

414
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,031
General Gan, Mister Zhu-ge said

415
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,713
that your formation is outdated

416
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,832
Are you aware that a bad formation can kill our brothers?

417
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,634
I have never thought of killing my own brothers

418
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,519
The power of the formations comes from the heart

419
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,314
There is no such thing as outdated!

420
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,195
This is...?

421
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,396
This is General Gan Xing

422
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,199
Pardon me, General Gan

423
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,874
General Gan and his army,

424
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,553
used to be the most notorious pirates in the South

425
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,749
You cannot joke around with him

426
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,235
No problem

427
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,555
I am impressed by everyone's performance today!

428
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,118
But this elderly gentleman had his buffalo stolen

429
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,517
in the rice fields near the barracks

430
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,719
Was this done by one of my brothers?

431
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,709
He who did it gave all our brothers a bad name!

432
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,557
Find him!

433
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,188
Who did this despicable thing?

434
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,952
Lu Su, tell me,

435
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,758
what is the penalty according to law?

436
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,149
By law,

437
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,879
the penalty is death!

438
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,952
Step forward. Reveal yourselves

439
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,839
Step forward

440
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,278
I have a way to find them

441
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,518
Since the buffalo was stolen in the rice fields,

442
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,553
then there must be mud on the shoes of the looters

443
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,476
Am I correct?

444
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,356
Yes!

445
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,517
Attention, Gan Xing Company!

446
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,836
Everyone,

447
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,473
run to that tree,

448
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,352
around and back

449
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,755
Go!

450
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,358
Quickly! Follow up!

451
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,869
I did not drag those people out today

452
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,997
because I want to give them a second chance

453
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,238
The Wu army does not tolerate looting!

454
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,392
What we really need

455
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,955
is to stick together

456
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,108
I have failed

457
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,431
to train my soldiers

458
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,712
I beg your forgiveness

459
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,872
I dare not!

460
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,993
I dare not!

461
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,791
These soldiers are difficult to train

462
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,995
Yet, these soldiers, have great potential

463
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,119
Things like this happen because of our shortage of supplies

464
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,953
You gave us half of your wealth to help build this army

465
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,109
Now, supplies are short again

466
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,630
So how about giving up the other half?

467
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,471
Whatever you say is fine by me

468
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,949
Then it's settled

469
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,910
Your Honor!

470
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:12,712
Your Honor!

471
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,836
Bad news!

472
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,235
I told you

473
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,630
this friend is difficult to deal with

474
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,310
It's a breech birth!

475
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,313
It's a breech birth!

476
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,598
Hold this

477
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,759
Luoyue,

478
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,955
hang in there

479
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,948
My Lady! The pony still hasn't...

480
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,109
Be quiet

481
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,272
She can't give birth with you being so loud

482
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,198
It's coming

483
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,911
Xiao Qiao, what's happening?

484
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,231
A breech birth

485
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,833
It will come out soon

486
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,433
Your Honor, for horses...

487
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,191
Be quiet!

488
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,713
Breech births are very rare

489
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,753
The pony has not come out for two days

490
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,753
What is happening?

491
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,315
Why is there only one leg?

492
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,198
He can't come out

493
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,834
What should we do?

494
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,077
The other leg is stuck

495
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,191
Simply dragging it out will not work

496
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,709
He is...?

497
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,149
He is Zhu...

498
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,670
He is Zhu-ge Liang, a friend of mine

499
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,393
Step back a little

500
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,153
You are knowledgeable in this too?

501
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,469
A little

502
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,432
I helped cows giving birth

503
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,478
Horses should be much the same

504
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,149
Excuse me, let me try

505
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,310
The two front hooves need to come out together

506
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,790
for a natural birth

507
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,949
The pony does not have a name yet

508
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,879
He was born in the Southland,

509
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,078
so he should have a Southern name

510
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,394
How about Meng Meng?

511
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,233
Meng Meng?

512
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,279
Meng Meng, stand up!

513
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,954
He can't stand up!

514
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,393
Stand up!

515
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,789
Come on!

516
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,311
Stand up!

517
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,277
I hope we can watch him grow each day

518
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,437
I want you to promise me,

519
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,392
when he is grown,

520
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,552
not to make him a warhorse

521
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,790
Viceroy,

522
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,394
Xiao Qiao looks like

523
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,235
she's the proud new mother herself

524
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,234
Viceroy, time is of the essence

525
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,913
War or surrender?

526
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,149
Lu Su,

527
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,960
today we are celebrating. Let' s not discuss affairs of state

528
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,474
Alright,

529
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,552
Since Mr Zhu-ge is learned in music,

530
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,070
why don' t we play a tune together?

531
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,192
I know only...a little

532
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,549
You know a great deal

533
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,189
You are only hiding it

534
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,390
If you two gentlemen can work together,

535
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,438
then that will be a perfect match

536
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,111
Please

537
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,633
Thank you, madam

538
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,470
Thank you, Mr. Zhu-ge

539
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,677
My husband has not played his qin for a long time

540
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,714
I, too, have not been so enervated for a long time

541
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,549
We still haven't discussed the war

542
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,835
How can we leave?

543
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,230
His answer is within his music

544
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,711
He will fight this war

545
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,630
I think you two can be great partners

546
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,399
His music tells me,

547
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,591
that he needs friends

548
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,113
Your music tells me

549
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,314
that you need to fight this war

550
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,833
Prime Minister,

551
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,555
desire and obsession

552
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,029
can also cause of headaches

553
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,076
Have you not heard that desire makes one young!

554
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,553
This painting must be by Your Highness

555
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,831
Her name is Xiao Qiao

556
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,269
When I was young,

557
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,278
her father thought very highly of me

558
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,352
I saw her only once

559
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,316
Now, she is the most beautiful woman in the world

560
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,949
and married to Zhou Yu

561
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,395
After I pacify Wu,

562
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,951
she will be mine

563
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,474
Gentlemen, you are all here

564
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,516
Yes, Your Highness!

565
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,399
General Cai, your ships are well built!

566
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,834
Thank you, Your Highness

567
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,316
I have guarded Jingzhou for many years

568
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,476
With the strength and power of our current navy,

569
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,868
we will surely defeat Wu

570
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:24,517
Great!

571
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,511
What? The two generals are saying,

572
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,114
that our ground troops are just for show?

573
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,437
General Xia-hou, while we Northerners are great on horseback,

574
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,870
the Southerners are experts on the water

575
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,479
To destroy Wu,

576
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,950
we will need the hard work of General Cai and his navy!

577
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,388
Thank you, Your Highness!

578
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,589
General Cai,

579
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,829
What...

580
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,873
is the best food in the South?

581
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,235
River fish is the best food in the South

582
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,590
Then...

583
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,798
what is the worst thing about the South?

584
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,752
The weather is the worst

585
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,069
This is the windy season

586
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,715
The wind can often be unpredictable

587
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,793
Victory

588
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,478
Six dragons lead my chariot

589
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,872
I will ride the wind with the greatest speed

590
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,435
With all of the feudal lords under my command,

591
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,157
to rule the world with one name

592
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,192
On land and sea, with forces numbering eight hundred thousand,

593
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,111
I wish to meet Your Highness at the hunt for Wu

594
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,074
This Cao Cao

595
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,071
really has some nerve

596
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,710
What does he mean by a hunt for Wu?

597
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,870
Brother

598
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,993
Smile!

599
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,271
We will get through this

600
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,837
They all want you to smile too

601
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,996
When father was nineteen,

602
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,751
he was known as the Tiger of the Southland

603
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,951
When my late brother was twenty-six,
he conquered the Southland

604
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,111
I am now twenty-six,

605
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,034
yet I have done nothing!

606
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,718
It seems that my achievements

607
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,879
will never be able to be compared to theirs

608
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,472
No matter how hard I try,

609
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,796
those old advisors call me worthless

610
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,794
Brother?

611
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,151
You came at the right time...

612
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,516
He will not listen or even smile

613
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,436
My Lord,

614
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:51,751
what is it?

615
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,677
Cao Cao requests our surrender. See for yourself

616
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,470
You have not used this for a long time

617
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,594
Let's go

618
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,311
He is cunning

619
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,076
Do you see him?

620
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,270
This beast is watching us

621
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,555
He is sinister, playing with his prey

622
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,718
Is he not like Cao Cao?

623
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,956
Though Cao Cao is Prime Minister, he is the real traitor,

624
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,277
always ambushing from the darkness

625
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,518
In the entire world, not one person likes him

626
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,350
Brother, what are you afraid of?

627
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,113
There!

628
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,390
To be honest,

629
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,676
I was prepared for war with Cao Cao three years ago

630
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,791
Cao Cao claims to have an army of eight hundred thousand,

631
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,520
yet many are surrendered troops he cannot trust

632
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,712
He can actually use only one hundred thousand of them at most

633
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,308
Our troops have high morale

634
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,349
We have knowledge of the Yangtze and greater naval expertise

635
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,791
Moreover, Cao Cao has no justifiable reason for his war

636
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,070
But those senior advisors!

637
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,475
They are only concerned about protecting themselves

638
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,591
You need not listen to them

639
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,596
Your late brother once told you

640
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,268
that you are a better administrator,

641
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,916
but that he is a better commander

642
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,235
That made you lose confidence

643
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,551
But he only said that to make you strive to surpass him

644
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,111
Tiger!

645
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,555
Help them!

646
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,475
Go quickly

647
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,075
Get out of here

648
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,152
Can you walk?

649
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,753
Are you alright?

650
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,589
The beast is over there!

651
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,070
Go

652
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,070
Do not hesitate anymore
