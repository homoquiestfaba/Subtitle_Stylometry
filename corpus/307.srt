He's not keeping them.
He's eating them.

No, listen.
We were at Molly's
parents for New Year's,

51
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,100
and Molly's dad was
showing my son, Josh,
how to carve a roasted chicken.

52
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,800
Yeah?
He said, "The tenderest
part of the chicken...

53
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,700
is the oysters
here on either side
of the back."

that expression
before..."oysters."

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,300

I had a flash
of the third victim.

she was missing
flesh from her back.

57

And then it hit me...
liver, kidney, tongue,
thymus.

58
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,300

lost some body part
used in cooking.

- Very interesting,

- There are things

even computer access. I'd
speak to the chief of staff.

No. I know I'm not

- You had... disadvantages.

- You're insane.

Just like old times,
hey, Will?

378
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,300
This is a very shy boy,
Will.

379
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,900
I'd love to meet him.

380
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,300
Have you considered
the possibility
that he is disfigured...

381
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,400
or that he may believe
he is disfigured?

382
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
The mirrors.

383
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,600
Yes. You notice he smashes
all the mirrors
in the houses...

384
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,900
and not just enough
to get the pieces he wants.

385
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,600
Of course, those shards
in their eyes... so he can
see himself there.

386
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,900
That's interesting.
No, it's not interesting.
You thought of that before.

387
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,700
I had considered it.
What about the women?
Uh-huh.

388
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,600
Dead... mere puppets.
You need to see them living,

389
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,400
the way they caught his eye.

390
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,500
- That's impossible.
- Almost, not quite.

391
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,100
What were the yards like?

392
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Big back yards.
Fenced, some hedges.
Why?

393
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,200
Because if this pilgrim
feels a special relationship
with the moon,

394
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,200
he might like to go outside
and look at it.

395
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,400
You ever seen blood
in the moonlight, Will?
It appears quite black.

396
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,100
If one were nude, say, it would
be better to have outdoor
privacy for that sort of thing.

397
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,300
You think the yards
might be a factor
when he selects victims?

398
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,300
Oh, yes, and there will be
more of them of course...

399
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,700
victims.

400
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,900

lots of these little

- I do. I have oodles.

Don't you understand, Will?

408
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,700
You caught me because
we are very much alike.

But I don't think that's
what he brought it for.

484
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,100
Too heavy, too awkward
and he had to carry it
a long way.

And what do we make
of that symbol?

486

Asian Studies at Langley
identified it
as a Chinese character.

00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,600

on a mah-jongg piece.

Instead, he broke in
through the patio doors.

Diaries, letters.
Do you have those things,
Mr. Metcalf?

643
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:23,000
Oh, I sure do. I mean,
other than one or two little
keepsakes Niles Jacobi got.

644
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,700
That would be Mr. Jacobi's
surviving son by his first wife?

645
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,000
Yeah, that's right.
As their executor, I keep all
that stuff here in the office,

646
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,100
along with some
of the smaller valuables,
till after probate.

647
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,900
But, uh, Birmingham P.D. 's
been all through it.

648
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,200
Could you pack those things
and ship 'em up to me?

649
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,400
I hate to ask.
I know it's a pain in the ass.

650
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Ah, hell.

651
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:57,000
Probate judge is
an old golfin' buddy of mine.

652
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,300
Son,

653
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,800
just tell me you're gonna
nail that son of a bitch.

654
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,500
<i>We're doing our best.
[Crawford]
Will? </i>

655
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,700
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.
Thanks.

656
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:11,100
A note hidden in Lecter's cell.
Sounds like a fan letter
mailed by the Tooth Fairy.

657
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:15,200
He wants Lecter's approval.
He's curious about you.
He's asking questions.

658
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,300
I've scrambled a chopper.
Does Lecter know
we have the note?

659
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,200
<i>[Crawford]
Not yet. It was found
during a routine cleanup. </i>

660
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,600
<i>They don't open his mail? 
Can't. Need a warrant. 
X rays only. </i>

661
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,700
<i>Where's Lecter now? 
Still in the holding cage. </i>

662
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,200
<i>Can he see his cell
from there? 
No. </i>

663
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,800
<i>He's been there almost half
an hour. Soon he'll start
to wonder what's wrong. </i>

664
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,600
We gotta buy time, Jack.

665
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,300
Dr. Chilton?
Yes?

666
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,300
Call your building
superintendent or engineer...
whoever's in charge.

667
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,400
Tell them to pull the circuit
breakers on Lecter's hall.

668
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,700
Have the super walk down
the hall past the holding cell
carrying tools.

669
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:54,100
He'll be in a hurry,
pissed off, too busy to answer
any questions. Got it?

670
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,600
And don't forget.
Don't touch the note. Okay?

671
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,700
Graham's on his way.

672
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:03,800
Listen up! We've got a note
coming in on the fly,

673
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,300
possibly from the Tooth Fairy.

674
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:10,100
Number one priority.
It has to go back
to Lecter's cell...

675
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,600
within the hour unmarked.

676
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,300
We'll need Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints,
then Documents.

677
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,700
I'll walk it through myself.
Let's go, people.

678
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,500
<i>[Dolarhyde's Voice]
My dear Dr. Lecter... </i>

679
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,500
<i>I wanted to tell you
I'm delighted that
you've taken an interest in me. </i>

680
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,000
<i>And when I learned
of your vast correspondence, </i>

681
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
<i>I thought, "Dare I?"</i>

682
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,900
<i>Of course I do. </i>

683
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,800
<i>I don't believe
you'll tell them who I am. </i>

684
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,500
<i>Besides, what particular body
I currently occupy is trivial. </i>

685
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,000
<i>The important thing
is what I am becoming. </i>

686
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,100
<i>I know that you alone can
understand this transformation. </i>

687
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,100
<i>I have some things
I'd love to show you, </i>

688
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,600
<i>if circumstances permit. </i>

689
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,400
<i>I hope we can correspond. </i>

690
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,300
<i>I have admired you for years
and have a complete collection
of your press notices. </i>

691
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:12,100
<i>Actually, I think of them
as unfair reviews. 
As unfair as mine. </i>

692
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,400
<i>They do like to sling
demeaning nicknames, 
don't they? </i>

693
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,400
<i>"The Tooth Fairy. "
What could be
more inappropriate? </i>

694
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,200
<i>It would shame me
for you to read that... </i>

695
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,200
<i>if I didn't know you had
suffered the same distortions
in the press. </i>

696
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,800
I'm fed up with this bloody
stupid building. Every day,
something breaking.

697
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,500
<i>I swear they ought to tear
the whole fuckin' place down. </i>

698
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,800
How much longer
do we have?
Ten minutes max.

699
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,800
<i>Instructions for answering
are probably in the section
Lecter tore out. </i>

700
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,300
But I don't get it.
Why not just throw
the whole note away?

701
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,200
It was full of compliments.
Couldn't bear to part with them.

702
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:54,400
Now we can mash just a little.

703
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,400
You're so sly.

704
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,300
<i>But so am I. </i>

705
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,400
<i>Aniline dyes and colored inks
are transparent to infrared. </i>

706
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,300
These could be the tips
of "T's" here and here.

707
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:11,000
On the end, that's a "P"
or possibly an "R."

708
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,300
<i>Maybe this is where
he's telling Lecter
how to answer him. </i>

709
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,600
Jack, there's only one safe way
to carry on a conversation
that's one-way blind.

710
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:20,800
<i>Publication. Wait a minute.
We know this sweetheart
reads the Tattler. </i>

711
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,800
That's in his note, right?
"The Tooth Fairy..."
they made that up.

712
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,500
<i>Three "T's" and an "R"
in Tattler. </i>

713
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,700
So how do you communicate
through a tabloid?
You got what? News stories.

714
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,500
- Personals. Personals.
- Damn it.

715
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,000
What if the killer wants
Lecter to answer him
through the personal columns?

716
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
<i>That could be it.
We're gonna need proofs of those pages
before the Tattler's published.</i>

717
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
<i>I'm on it. </i>

718
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,900
<i>[Dolarhyde's Voice]
Investigator Graham
interests me. </i>

719
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,900
<i>Not your standard gumshoe, 
is he? </i>

720
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,300
<i>More alert, 
purposeful looking. </i>

721
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,000
<i>You should have taught him
not to meddle. </i>

722
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,500
<i>Forgive the stationary. 
I chose it because it will
dissolve very quickly... </i>

723
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,600
<i>if you should have to
swallow it. </i>

724
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,100
<i>If I hear from you next time, 
I might send you something wet. </i>

725
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,500
<i>Until then, dear Doctor, </i>

726
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,900
<i>I remain your most... 
avid fan. </i>

727
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,500
<i>[Crawford]
The Tattler got an ad order
signed 666.</i>

728
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,800
Baltimore postmark
on the envelope.

729
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,900
It's set to run
this afternoon.

730
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:42,100
Chicago field office is
sending the text through now.
