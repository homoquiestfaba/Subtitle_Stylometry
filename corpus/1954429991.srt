1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,520
AGE OF
TOMORROW

2
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,470
No, I didn't leave
Lindsey home by herself.

3
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,185
No, the dog is there.

4
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,532
Sue, come on, don't you think
you're overreacting here?

5
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:55,417
Lindsey is almost 17,
I think she'll be fine.

6
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:59,420
I know it's my weekend with her.

7
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:01,217
Look I'll make it up to her okay?

8
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:05,877
Hello?  Sue?
Damn it!

9
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:31,276
<i>Hi, you've reached
Lindsey Meyers phone.</i>

10
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:33,304
<i>If you're important,
please leave a message,</i>

11
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,068
<i>unless you're Jerry, then you
can go fuck yourself.  Thanks.</i>

12
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:41,108
Hi Linds, it's dad.
Please change your voice-mail.

13
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:44,978
Anyway look.  I want to make
it up to you for working today.

14
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:49,579
So why don't we go to the movies tonight?
I'll see if I can get off early, okay?

15
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,369
Oh, and please remember to feed the dog.
And why don't you just stay home tonight?

16
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,754
The last time you went out,
your phone battery died

17
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:59,647
long enough for you to
come home stumbling drunk.

18
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,281
Next time your mum's gonna kill me.

19
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:06,345
Okay, gotta go.
I love you.  Bye.

20
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:14,125
Want to tell me what's so important
you couldn't tell me over the phone?

21
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:15,226
Last night's  meteor shower

22
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,037
caused a lot of damage
all over the country.

23
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:18,347
Nothing we can't handle.

24
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:19,491
- But Colonel.
- But what?

25
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,393
We've got bigger problems.

26
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:24,170
General Magowan.
How bad is the situation?

27
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:27,800
Mac, the president is so concerned,
my phone's been ringing off the hook.

28
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,553
The Pentagon is running scenarios.

29
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:32,659
Their expert, some physicist,
is coming in any minute.

30
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:37,080
<i>I told you my name is Dr. Gordon.  I
need to speak with the General right away.</i>

31
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,380
Ahh Dr. Gordon.
Make it through security okay?

32
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,818
Yes, you can go, soldiers.
I'm sorry I'm late.

33
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,844
Gentlemen, for the last 10 years

34
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:48,551
I have been liaison between
NASA and the US military.

35
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:52,140
Keeping them appraised of all
potential near earth objects.

36
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,810
And by the look of this, we've
got a big one headed right for us.

37
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,061
Oh my God,
how big is it?

38
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,399
Well, with all due respect, sir,

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,942
if this was the size of a
satellite, I wouldn't be here.

40
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:06,460
This is a quarter of our moon.
We are talking end of days here.

41
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,858
End of life as we know it.

42
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:14,365
- And judging by its speed, I'd say...
- We are looking at a 48 hour window

43
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:16,247
before it collides with earth, Mac.

44
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,398
- Get the Colonel a cup of coffee.
- Yes, right away, sir.

45
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:23,881
- Get the gravity of the situation?
- Yes, sir.

46
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:27,780
I need to keep monitoring this
thing.  I will keep you informed.

47
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:28,759
Good.

48
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,551
Mac, you've trained the best.
Now we need the best.

49
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:37,972
We need to fly some of our own onto that
rock and blast it out of earth's path.

50
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:39,749
We have a Captain
James Wheeler coming in.

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,759
Are you familiar with this mission?

52
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:44,112
Sir, he's a liability.  He lost
a man on his last mission.

53
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:47,322
Well, I'll let you decide
that once he arrives.

54
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:49,496
Right now, we need to
issue a nation wide alert.

55
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:52,083
Start moving people into
bunkers and bomb shelters.

56
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:54,702
- God help us.
- Yes.

57
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:07,725
It had to happen on my day off, huh?

58
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:10,705
I'm sorry, Chris.  Five guys didn't
come in today.  Not even a call.

59
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:16,410
- Oh!
- Man.

60
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:18,014
The meteor shower did
really a number on us,

61
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:19,839
we got fires popping
up all over the city.

62
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:22,282
I want hoses in those
windows up there now!

63
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:24,089
Come on!
Come on!

64
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:29,034
- Anybody left inside?
- No, LAPD said everybody made it out.

65
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:32,102
I don't think so.

66
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:43,253
- Ready, kid?
- Yeah, how about you, pop?

67
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,795
Let's bring the heat.

68
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:49,538
- Got it?
- Oh man, we gonna need backup.

69
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,794
- There's no backup, it's just us.
- Great.

70
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,515
Come on, pal!  We're running
out of time!  Let's go!

71
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:58,537
I heard those screams,
she's up here.

72
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:07,894
LA Fire Department.
Is anybody in here?

73
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:09,136
They are clear.

74
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:13,960
Jesus, it's coming down on us, Chris.

75
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:15,501
We got to find this lady and
get the hell out of here.

76
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:18,574
I know.  I know!
Is anybody in here?

77
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:21,568
There's a room.

78
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:25,897
Clear.

79
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:37,009
- Where is she?
- She's not here.

80
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:40,546
Going up.

81
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:44,729
Come on, it's coming from up here.
Let's go.

82
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,351
There... there she is!

83
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:57,789
Stay where you are,
we're coming to get you.

84
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:01,380
Sully!

85
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:10,698
- You okay?
- I don't know, I think it's broken.

86
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:16,016
- Yup, yeah, it's broken.
- We gotta get you out of here. Come on.

87
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:19,038
Well, what are you gonna do?  Go
after her by yourself?  Come on!  Go!

88
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,691
What you gonna do?
Stop me?  Come on.  Let's go!

89
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:26,610
You're gonna be okay.

90
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,897
Come on.  We are almost
there... almost there.

91
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:35,728
Come on, get him.
His leg's broken.

92
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:38,188
- I'm going back in.
- What?  Chris!

93
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,676
Chris, what are you doing?
Come on!

94
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:43,247
Is he crazy?  That roof
top's going to give way.

95
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:49,625
- And what's taking so long?
- Come on, Chris.  Come on.

96
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,273
Well, I think I got him.  Look!

97
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:12,592
- Jesus Christ, Chris what are you doing?
- The elevator was broken.

98
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:16,403
- How's your leg.
- It's been better.

99
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:18,673
Glad we didn't take
the short way down.

100
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,738
Excuse me, General... Colonel.

101
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:28,828
Captain Wheeler, thank you for coming.
Do you know Colonel McCanless?

102
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:33,878
Only by reputation.  I heard he
was the best pilot in the Air Force.

103
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,812
We're glad you decided to
come in on such short notice.

104
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:40,300
Well, I don't think I had much of a choice.
Your goons are very pushy.

105
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:46,849
But at least now I can make myself
clear.  Whatever it is, it's no.

106
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:50,580
- I'm done.
- Done?

107
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:53,907
Then how come you're still
wearing those tags, Captain.

108
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:03,540
- I said I'm done.
- He is very reassuring.

109
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,445
How much longer are you
gonna torture yourself?

110
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:11,531
It's been two years.

111
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:16,749
You lost one man, and
saved several others.

112
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:21,840
It doesn't mean anything.  Now
there's nothing I can do to change it.

113
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,211
How about saving lives of billions?

114
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,300
Why exactly am I here?

115
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,628
The meteor shower that's
been sweeping the world.

116
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:35,275
Right now, going the path of a
mass of asteroid heading for Earth.

117
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,891
We're being told from the sheer size
of it, on impact, nothing will live.

118
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,097
Do we have your attention now?

119
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,920
What do you want from me?

120
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,288
We want you to go up
there, dig, plant charges

121
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,941
and blow this thing to
hell before it reaches earth.

122
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:59,598
- How much time do we have?
- Impact in 46 hours.

123
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:05,277
I am afraid this is a
time sensitive situation.

124
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,124
So we're going to need
an immediate response.

125
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:11,764
- If I do this...
- Captain, it won't be like before.

126
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,554
We're not sending you
behind enemy lines.

127
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,525
It sounds like you're
sending me to hell.

128
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:21,046
Jim, please.

129
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,656
We need you.

130
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:28,346
You can watch the world burn, or
you can do something to change it.

131
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:34,744
My mission, my team.
No exceptions.

132
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:44,448
Are you sure about this man, General?

133
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:47,350
Sometimes, Colonel, you
just have to act on faith.

134
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,942
At ease.

135
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:04,293
General Magowan.
Sergeant Clayton, Reconnaissance.

136
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,323
Sir.

137
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:10,217
- Corporal Cabrera, Demolitions.
- Sir.

138
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:14,383
- Lieutenant Southard, Communications.
- Sir.

139
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:18,663
- Fitzpatrick and Sanchez, Pilots.
- Sir.

140
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:23,833
General, meet the roughnecks.

141
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:28,222
- Relieved yet?
- I will be, once you get back.

142
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,629
Captain Wheeler.

143
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:41,223
Allow me to introduce Dr. Gordon.

144
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:44,710
- The Pentagon's most brilliant physicist.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

145
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:49,024
Very nice to meet you,
Captain Wheeler.

146
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:51,404
May I introduce you to your shuttle?

147
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,968
The SI-22 Astraeus.

148
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:10,257
The Astraeus was
designed as an interceptor

149
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:12,755
for satellite and
base station emergencies.

150
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:15,325
We filled her up for
exactly one round trip,

151
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:18,283
so don't take her sightseeing
in between or anything.

152
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:20,765
We've loaded the
equipment and schematics

153
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:24,681
as to exactly where to dig
and bury the explosives.

154
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,855
- We're not getting weapons?
- For the asteroid?  No.

155
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:32,415
But for security reasons there
is a locked case with firearm.

156
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:35,775
We wouldn't want you guys
getting all... trigger-happy.

157
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:38,206
Great, so we've got tickets
to the end of the world,

158
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:39,738
and we don't have any damn guns.

159
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:44,075
Don't worry, the US government
will be rewarding you all handsomely.

160
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:46,255
- How handsome?
- Three.

161
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:49,405
- Hundred thousand?
- Million.

162
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,337
Get this mother started,
I'm ready to go!

163
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:57,559
- Alright, let's do this.
- Suit up.

164
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:03,021
- Well, I guess we'll see you up there.
- We?

165
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,106
Uh yeah.  Unless you've got...

166
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:07,821
someone who knows interstellar
rock formations better than I do.

167
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:11,356
- I mean, if you do, that's cool.
- We it is.

168
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:15,406
You didn't think I was gonna
let you have all the fun, did you?

169
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:18,342
So, take her out easy.
I've just waxed her.

170
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:28,031
<i>Launch.  Minus five minutes.</i>

171
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:31,507
- Think you got this?
- Oh sure.

172
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:34,058
I've got a 30-minute
crash course in piloting

173
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,520
a billion dollar government
funded space shuttle.

174
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,717
- It's not to get.
- Thought so.

175
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,097
<i>- Well, hold tight back there.
- Take-off is in 30 seconds.</i>

176
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:47,097
<i>Once you're on the rock you may
have difficulty with radio transmission.</i>

177
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:53,237
Well, that's why we've got this
satellite beacon, to amplify our signal.

178
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:59,940
Better stay tight.

179
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:05,538
- You ready?
- You know I'm ready.

180
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,190
You were born ready.

181
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:17,567
Jesus!

182
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:23,438
Whoo... oooo.

183
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:29,768
- They serve refreshments on this flight?
- Shut up.

184
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,731
We made it.

185
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,089
Not yet.
Still a way to go.

186
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,090
How's the ride?

187
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,753
Okay, that can't be good.

188
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:08,484
What the hell...

189
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,012
What the hell is that?
Talk to me.

190
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:16,610
Our planned course is incorrect.  We're
on collision course with the asteroid.

191
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,463
What?
That doesn't make sense.

192
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:20,873
Based on its speed, we knew
how much to compensate

193
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:22,663
for that travel time
for it to be much easier.

194
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:25,132
- It seems to be slowing down.
- What?

195
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,837
If we check the distance from
earth we're faster than that

196
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:30,241
- instead we're slowing down.
- Well, that can't be good.

197
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,510
To say the least.  Oh no,
everyone back in your seats.

198
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:35,529
- Why?
- We're going in too fast.

199
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,644
This is going to be rough.

200
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,983
Hang on!

201
00:14:58,111 --> 00:14:59,767
Fire the front boosters.

202
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:04,696
Oh, my God!

203
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,017
Come on!

204
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:43,862
- Crap yourself?
- Get real.

205
00:15:45,072 --> 00:15:48,742
Wow, what is this, Gonzo rock?

206
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:51,045
Watch ***.

207
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,628
Now you all have your coordinates.

208
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:59,449
Locate your targets and
mark them with a tracking rod.

209
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,723
Got it, sir!

210
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:03,323
Clayton, you make your
way cutting and drilling.

211
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:06,951
Cabrera and Southard, you hustle back
to the ship and prep the explosives.

212
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:08,215
Stick together.

213
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:11,524
Fitzpatrick and Sanchez,
you'll prep the shuttle for take-off.

214
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:13,101
Read you, Captain.

215
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:18,202
- The clock is ticking! Squad move out!
- Sir, sir.

216
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:20,969
Okay!  Let's go.

217
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,482
Don't look at me.
She's your tourist.

218
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,837
I'll start here.

219
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,226
One asteroid root
canal coming up now.

220
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:03,065
- That's odd.
- What is it?

221
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,575
I'm drilling, but I'm only 50 feet in.

222
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:08,912
Just having a hard time
getting any deeper.

223
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:11,735
- That's not deep enough.
- Keep at it.

224
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:13,903
Yes, sir.

225
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:19,744
- Come on, get more locations marked.
- It's got a chamber.

226
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:22,301
What?

227
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:26,450
There, you see that?

228
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:28,965
A cave.

229
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:31,592
If there are passages, then maybe

230
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,825
there's a cavern that leads
to this asteroid's epicenter.

231
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,077
We could plant the charges there,

232
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:39,131
and then we won't have to dig in
order to completely destroy this thing.

233
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:48,598
Squad, we're going to scout a nearby
cave as a potential detonation point.

234
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:52,316
- Stay the course.
- Whoa!  What!  A cave?

235
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:57,906
<i> Just be careful, I mean, we're only
near them craters.  Watch yourself, sir.</i>

236
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:24,856
- Come on, this way.
- Easy, Doctor.

237
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:43,677
Captain James?

238
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,457
What do you got?

239
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:50,532
Look!

240
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:56,592
Well, this doesn't make sense.

241
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:01,557
<i> - Captain, come in!
- Go ahead, Southard.</i>

242
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:03,728
<i>- There's something out here.
- What?</i>

243
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,152
<i> Cabrera and I were marking
our coordinates and...</i>

244
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,778
And what?

245
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,918
<i> Something moved about here.
I saw it went right by us.</i>

246
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,586
<i>- Debris?
- Captain, where are you?</i>

247
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:19,083
Stand by guys.

248
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:34,006
What the hell is this?

249
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:37,311
This is weird.

250
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,483
I don't like this.

251
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:49,400
I've never seen anything like this.

252
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,514
What's that?

253
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,377
Don't.

254
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,853
Okay, this is not an asteroid.

255
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,012
Everyone, back to the ship.
Now!

256
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,005
Whoa, the whole
damn thing is shaking.

257
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,717
Hey, jump!
Come on!

258
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,778
Jump!

259
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,446
You got this.

260
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,823
- Good jump, girl.
- What the hell is going on?

261
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:32,803
I don't know.

262
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,811
Oh my God.
Go!

263
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,620
What is that?

264
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,206
Control!  We have hundreds of bogeys
about to enter Earth's atmosphere.

265
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:45,831
<i>Say it again, I'm afraid.</i>

266
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,431
Enemy aircrafts. Can you read?
Alert everyone.

267
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,751
30 kilometers outside of
Saint-Guilhem-le-Desert, France.

268
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,849
Jesus...

269
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:23,623
What the...

270
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:42,768
Oh my God.

271
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:24,829
Fuck!

272
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:31,600
Please, not now.

273
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:35,251
No! Come on!

274
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:37,837
Come on!

275
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:57,285
No!

276
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:11,666
You think that was enough
excitement for one day.

277
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,580
Yeah, relax would you?

278
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:29,244
- Have you ever seen anything like this?
- What is that?

279
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,048
Station 2-4-9, this is Hansen.
Do you copy?  Are you seeing this?

280
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:40,854
- Coming in too fast there.
- Halt.

281
00:23:40,915 --> 00:23:41,967
Look out!

282
00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:48,304
- Turn off your engine.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

283
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:51,523
- Turn off your engine.
- I'll call you back.

284
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:56,522
What the hell is going on out here?

285
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:59,392
- This is a restricted area!
- What are you talking about?

286
00:23:59,393 --> 00:24:00,813
Our department is only a block away.

287
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:03,341
We have direct orders
to start relocating

288
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:06,087
everybody from downtown
to a safe military bunker.

289
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:08,319
Relocating?
Under whose authority?

290
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,612
That's on a need to know basis
which you don't have to.

291
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:12,684
- So get back in your truck,
I'll have my men...

292
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:13,892
Incoming!

293
00:24:22,956 --> 00:24:25,140
- Captain, what's going on?
- It's an invasion!

294
00:24:25,141 --> 00:24:26,879
What?
What the hell's going on?

295
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:29,291
- This isn't what we think it is.
- Yeah, no kidding.

296
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:31,186
We need to get the hell out of here!

297
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:41,117
Oh, God.

298
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:46,839
Sanchez... Fitzpatrick...

299
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,566
Hostiles.
Get back!

300
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:15,882
- Alright everybody!  Into the cave!
- What?  I'm not going in there.

301
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:17,795
Cabrera, get down!

302
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:28,881
- Cabrera!
- No!

303
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:31,582
Come on!
I don't think she's actually dead.

304
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,766
Come on!

305
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:53,627
- This isn't positive.
- We're trapped. What are you doing?

306
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,433
- There's got to be some way.
- Take cover!

307
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,273
How the hell did you do that?

308
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:03,919
I think this is the same
thing that happened to Cabrera.

309
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:07,391
I think they've discovered some
sort of teleportation technology

310
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:09,615
or wormhole or something.

311
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,111
Earth to Wheeler!
They're not giving up here.

312
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,247
It's our only way out.
I'll see you on the other side.

313
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,546
- Where did she go?
- She's crazy!

314
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,490
- Maybe not!  Go!
- What? I was wrong, you're crazy!

315
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,925
- I said go!
- Yes, sir.  Let's go, Clayton.

316
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,840
- You guys alright?
- Ah, I think so.

317
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:49,363
I'm alright.
Where are my men?

318
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:57,266
- Don't shoot.
- I'm not going to shoot you.

319
00:26:58,131 --> 00:26:59,622
Whoa ssh...

320
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:01,423
That thing is coming around.

321
00:28:05,763 --> 00:28:07,232
Where did it go?

322
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:15,206
Ssh, get down.

323
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:29,457
Shit, it's on the truck.

324
00:28:33,794 --> 00:28:36,374
- What the hell were those things?
- I don't know.

325
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,825
I didn't get a good enough look.

326
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,101
They destroyed the
radio and killed my men.

327
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:48,514
Whatever they are, they're patrolling,
eliminating any hostile threat.

328
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:52,020
- I can't see anything.
- It's because we are under a truck.

329
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:54,429
Wait, wait.
Hold on.

330
00:28:55,314 --> 00:28:58,144
It is Lindsey.
Lindsey.

331
00:28:58,224 --> 00:29:01,768
Dad!  I'm so sorry.
Dad, please  come and get me.

332
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:05,255
They came out of nowhere,
and we're trapped.  Dad?

333
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,615
<i>Where are you?
Are you all right?</i>

334
00:29:06,616 --> 00:29:09,480
Yeah I'm okay, there are some
other people here with me.

335
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:12,679
What do you mean?  You're
not at home?  Where are you?

336
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:16,020
I'm downtown.
Dad, what's going on?

337
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:20,465
I'm scared.  We keep hearing
noises and screams, and I just...

338
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:24,975
Okay baby, I know.  Listen, wherever
you are, just lock yourself in tight.

339
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,304
Don't go anywhere near the
doors or the windows, okay?

340
00:29:27,405 --> 00:29:28,392
Okay.

341
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:30,330
Now tell me exactly where you are.

342
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:34,385
They chased us into some old
office building near Union Station.

343
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:37,356
Dad, what are these things?

344
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:43,145
They are dead because I'm coming
to get you.  You just sit tight, okay?

345
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:46,217
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too.

346
00:29:54,246 --> 00:29:55,231
What's the plan?

347
00:29:57,246 --> 00:29:58,950
- Major?
- Blake.

348
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:01,520
- Chris Meyer.
- Nice to meet you.

349
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:04,416
Okay, look.

350
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:09,964
They got us surrounded, but I think they
starting to leave away from our position.

351
00:30:10,506 --> 00:30:12,843
I think we can sneak out
if we go out that way.

352
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,350
And I could salvage
any weapons I still have.

353
00:30:16,426 --> 00:30:17,572
What's the plan, boss?

354
00:30:18,306 --> 00:30:19,649
I'm going to get my daughter.

355
00:30:21,227 --> 00:30:25,028
- His daughter is not worth it.
- She's not that cute.

356
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:39,946
Dad, where are you?

357
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:51,087
No! No! Get away!

358
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:58,079
Let's go.

359
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,316
- Glad you could joined the party.
- Where are we?

360
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,030
I thought we were history.

361
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,864
Look at that.

362
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,158
- We're not in South Central.
- What did I tell you?

363
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,830
These things have mastered
technology far greater than ours.

364
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,493
They are traveling to
earth through wormholes.

365
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,762
That's great, but how do we get back?

366
00:32:47,371 --> 00:32:48,444
Good question.

367
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:50,275
It's not like we
could just call for help.

368
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,345
Our radios are crap out here.

369
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:58,763
Sure, we can.

370
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:04,678
We can use this beacon to
increase our signal and send an SOS.

371
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:07,705
But it's only good
for one transmission.

372
00:33:08,231 --> 00:33:11,000
Alright, fine.  Do it.

373
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:16,401
It's gonna take some time to charge.
Give it an hour.

374
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:18,367
Fine.  Do it.

375
00:33:26,412 --> 00:33:29,525
Nobody leaves here without
my say so, understood?

376
00:33:49,972 --> 00:33:53,852
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
What are you doing, genius?

377
00:33:53,942 --> 00:33:58,773
We're on an alien planet, you
don't even know if there is air here.

378
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:05,956
Don't worry, it's breathable.

379
00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:08,953
As you are.

380
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:23,338
Well, that smells good.

381
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:29,893
- I miss LA.
- Hey Captain?

382
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:31,881
I think you better
take a look at this.

383
00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:37,136
I think we're in their backyard.

384
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:46,483
Son of a...

385
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:54,249
That's not all.
We're not the only ones out here.

386
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:06,261
They're herding humans.

387
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:12,905
- Doc, that absolutely needs an hour?
- Unfortunately, yes.

388
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:19,615
Alright.  Now we send out an SOS
and just hope help will arrive?

389
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:20,780
A whole lot of waiting.

390
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:23,701
Yeah, in time for
those things to find us.

391
00:35:23,736 --> 00:35:25,585
Wait wait wait.
What about all those people?

392
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:27,462
What about them?
We have to get out of here!

393
00:35:27,497 --> 00:35:28,855
Ah yeah!
And go where?

394
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:46,506
Alright.
Saddle up, we're moving out.

395
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:48,289
What?  Where to?

396
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,402
We're going down there,
we're going to save those people.

397
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:53,848
- Are you crazy, what about us?
- Stand down, Lieutenant!

398
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,684
Those are innocent
people who need our help.

399
00:35:59,016 --> 00:36:04,816
The rest of you can either follow me
or sit here with your thumbs up your ass.

400
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:09,579
- I said saddle up!
- Yes, sir.

401
00:36:12,246 --> 00:36:14,564
May I bother one of you for a weapon?

402
00:36:19,537 --> 00:36:20,803
Thank you.

403
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,628
Let's move out.

404
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:41,652
Try this. The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

405
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,098
Hey, right here.
Come over here!

406
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:51,005
Yeah, over here.  Over here.
That's right, come and get it!

407
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:53,197
That's right!
Get him Mike!

408
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:04,045
That's right!  Over here!

409
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:18,273
- I'm glad I stayed under here.
- Come on!

410
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:27,609
Deb, Deb, where is Shawn?

411
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:33,083
Where did you see him last?
He couldn't have just disappeared.

412
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:38,156
I can't come home till they get back.
There are fires all over the city.

413
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:43,129
Call the police.
Then try them again, Deb.

414
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:48,489
Deb, baby, Deb, Deb stop crying,
stop crying, we'll find him, okay?

415
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:50,870
I promise.
Okay?

416
00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:55,837
Deb?
Hello?

417
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,690
Deb?

418
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,061
I hope you know where we're going.
We can't keep running like this.

419
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,043
Don't worry, we're close.

420
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,820
Okay, come on.

421
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,480
- Holy Mother Mary. Are you all right?
- Not exactly.

422
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,575
- Samon, thank Christ you're alive.
- What the hell is going on out there?

423
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,510
Well, it's the end of the world.

424
00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:38,701
Must be.  I haven't
seen anybody else all day.

425
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,358
The others took all
the working engine.

426
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,073
That one's transmission is busted.

427
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:46,566
- Well, let's take my truck.
- It's payback time.

428
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:51,861
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Nice.

429
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:56,691
- Whoa!  Where's the fire?
- I'm going after my daughter.

430
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:58,220
And there are some out
of towners out there.

431
00:38:58,221 --> 00:39:01,541
They aren't too friendly.
If I were you, I'd arm myself.

432
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:05,535
You're serious?

433
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:10,508
Oh my God! My family, man!
I got to get to my family.

434
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:11,920
I got to see my family!
I got to...

435
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:13,881
Tim! Come with us.

436
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:18,262
Here, sorry.  But if it as bad as you say
it is then I need to collect my family.

437
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:20,342
If the power lines are down...
I need to go, man. I...

438
00:39:20,343 --> 00:39:23,891
Alright.  Just stay focused.
Be careful out there.

439
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:28,642
- Good luck, Chris.
- Take care of yourself, Tim.

440
00:39:28,732 --> 00:39:33,732
Chris, I can't thank you enough.
I got to get back to base.

441
00:39:33,812 --> 00:39:36,258
- This is war.
- So give 'em hell!

442
00:39:38,482 --> 00:39:40,775
Well, you drive.

443
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:43,103
Sully...

444
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:50,792
- Why don't we back seat this one.
- Game on, boss.

445
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:52,530
Captain, what is it?

446
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:54,771
There.

447
00:40:58,694 --> 00:40:59,880
Where?

448
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,620
What is it doing?

449
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:12,370
What's going on?

450
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:15,165
Something's not right.

451
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,575
How do you know?

452
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:20,037
They're hunting us.

453
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:27,115
And that one is a decoy.  They rest
are going to flank us from all sides.

454
00:41:32,225 --> 00:41:35,725
- Orders, Captain?
- Run!

455
00:41:35,815 --> 00:41:37,733
As fast as you can.

456
00:41:51,286 --> 00:41:52,632
Hurry, this way.

457
00:42:40,787 --> 00:42:44,547
- It's gone.
- Oh Jesus.

458
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:48,398
My heart can't stop pounding.

459
00:42:50,077 --> 00:42:53,460
It's war.
Get used to it.

460
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:13,528
Hey.

461
00:43:13,618 --> 00:43:16,498
You okay?

462
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:21,958
- I should never have left her alone.
- Hey, Chris, come on.

463
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:25,758
Well, if she's anything at
all like you, she's doing fine.

464
00:43:26,048 --> 00:43:29,929
She doesn't want to
be anything like me.

465
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:33,460
I break every promise,
I'm never there.

466
00:43:36,429 --> 00:43:38,060
Don't worry, we're gonna find her.

467
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:41,729
Hey!  Hey!

468
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:44,994
We're gonna find her, okay?

469
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:53,739
- Guys guys, we got company!
- Oh crap!

470
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:56,569
- Come on, let's go.  Faster, faster!
- Hang on!

471
00:43:56,649 --> 00:43:58,125
Lose him man!
Lose him!

472
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,920
- Put some lead into it!
- This thing can't go any faster!

473
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,829
Oh God Chris, when you last
time you got a tune-up?

474
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,560
- Will, get us out of here! Now!
- Hang on, hang on.

475
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,520
Chris, look out!

476
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,884
- Thanks.
- Now we're even.

477
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,990
- Sully!
- Oh Jesus Christ, they got Sullivan!

478
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,639
- That thing is still following us.
- Eyes on the road!

479
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,988
- What what...?
- The brakes are...

480
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:45,576
What do you mean?
What?

481
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:58,779
- Guys, get ready to jump.
- We gotta jump.

482
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,294
- What do you mean?
- We gotta jump, we gotta jump!

483
00:45:22,282 --> 00:45:25,485
- We gotta jump... you ready?
- Jump!  I'm sure not jumping...

484
00:45:27,272 --> 00:45:28,621
Wait?  What?

485
00:45:49,132 --> 00:45:51,762
It's cool guys.  We got it.
Don't worry about it.

486
00:45:51,763 --> 00:45:53,997
- One more crap you'll stop.
- Mm hm.

487
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:18,283
This is incredible.

488
00:46:19,263 --> 00:46:21,133
Ssh!

489
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:22,497
You go where we go,
or get left behind.

490
00:47:23,365 --> 00:47:26,505
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.  Be smart.

491
00:47:57,216 --> 00:48:00,613
- What are you doing?
- We're bringing them back.

492
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:03,153
He was already dead.
There's nothing you could do for him.

493
00:48:03,254 --> 00:48:05,527
Plus we don't know how
many more there are.

494
00:48:07,236 --> 00:48:10,067
- We got to be smart.
- Guys, will you shut the hell up?

495
00:48:20,707 --> 00:48:22,707
Take that, bitch!

496
00:48:26,217 --> 00:48:27,573
Southard!

497
00:48:33,937 --> 00:48:35,455
Cabrera!

498
00:48:38,727 --> 00:48:40,480
Get back, get back, get back!

499
00:49:01,698 --> 00:49:05,394
- You see anything?
- No, it's clear.  Come on. Let's go.

500
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:09,753
- Where is your daughter, Chris?
- One block up.

501
00:49:09,754 --> 00:49:11,313
Well, let's get you there.

502
00:49:12,258 --> 00:49:14,558
- No no!
- Should we double back?

503
00:49:14,638 --> 00:49:17,359
No, into there!
Go go!

504
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:29,683
Come on.
Go go go go go!

505
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:35,659
Whoa whoa.
Wait! Wait!

506
00:49:35,749 --> 00:49:38,078
Hide hide hide.
Cover yourselves.

507
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:43,828
Do you think it will come in here?

508
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:56,084
I'm thinking yes.

509
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,662
- Hey Chris, what are we gonna do?
- We got to get rid of that thing.

510
00:50:09,663 --> 00:50:10,666
How?

511
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,038
Doing...
Come on!

512
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,310
SCREW YOU

513
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:48,943
Look out!

514
00:51:11,712 --> 00:51:14,875
Go, go find your daughter.

515
00:51:37,072 --> 00:51:38,639
<i>Why exactly am I here?</i>

516
00:51:40,322 --> 00:51:43,542
<i>The Meteor Shower that's
been sweeping the world</i>

517
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:47,333
<i>Nothing will live.</i>

518
00:51:47,413 --> 00:51:51,920
<i>- We're not sending you behind enemy lines.
- Sounds like sending me to hell.</i>

519
00:51:53,003 --> 00:51:54,863
<i>Wait wait wait.
What about all those people?</i>

520
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:56,949
<i>What about them?
We have to get out of here.</i>

521
00:51:56,984 --> 00:51:58,874
<i>We going down there,
we're gonna save those people.</i>

522
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:00,095
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

523
00:52:00,883 --> 00:52:02,159
<i>Southard!</i>

524
00:52:03,313 --> 00:52:06,433
<i>Cabrera!
Get back! Get back! Get back!</i>

525
00:52:06,683 --> 00:52:09,459
<i>Mankind needs you.</i>

526
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:19,704
Who's there?

527
00:52:26,454 --> 00:52:27,792
Who's there?

528
00:52:33,004 --> 00:52:34,324
What are you doing?

529
00:52:35,794 --> 00:52:37,496
I'm getting out of here.

530
00:52:38,594 --> 00:52:39,954
Why?

531
00:52:41,884 --> 00:52:45,071
So, I can get you to safety.

532
00:52:45,094 --> 00:52:47,785
From this side?
From them?

533
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:51,338
Come on, I'm gonna get you out of
here.  You're gonna be alright.

534
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:54,944
Please.  You don't understand.

535
00:52:55,024 --> 00:52:58,324
They've already taken my children.

536
00:52:58,404 --> 00:53:00,579
Please...

537
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:04,405
- They've already killed me.
- Stop.

538
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:07,909
- But I'm still alive.
- Stop, stop.  I can't do that!

539
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:12,085
Please, please.

540
00:53:12,165 --> 00:53:16,965
I can't do that.
I'm not going to do that.

541
00:53:17,045 --> 00:53:19,925
Do you have any children?

542
00:53:20,005 --> 00:53:21,675
Do you?

543
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:29,975
If you did, you'd understand.  They
become your life, your reason for living.

544
00:53:30,055 --> 00:53:32,287
- Please.
- Sorry.

545
00:53:32,288 --> 00:53:33,386
Please...

546
00:53:37,196 --> 00:53:45,144
If not for me, do it for my
Ashley, Annie and George.

547
00:53:45,696 --> 00:53:47,858
You remind me of him.

548
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:54,246
Please.

549
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:02,386
Please...

550
00:54:03,256 --> 00:54:05,676
Please...

551
00:55:28,299 --> 00:55:31,849
- Gordon!
- Hurry, they're holding us captive.

552
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:34,662
- Quick, get me out of here!
- It's locked.

553
00:55:36,979 --> 00:55:37,993
Hang on.

554
00:55:46,399 --> 00:55:48,602
Oh, God, Clayton.

555
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:09,590
Just focus Captain.
There's still hope for you.

556
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:17,181
You and the doctor
can bust out of here.

557
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,230
Summon the beacon.

558
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,330
There is still hope for all of us.

559
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,272
Captain, they can't find you here.

560
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:36,101
You have to get out of here,
they'll kill you in the worst ways.

561
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:44,921
- You have to.
- I'm sorry, soldier.

562
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,041
The heck!

563
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:06,392
Hey! Hey!
You stay away from him!

564
00:57:09,032 --> 00:57:10,686
You leave him alone!

565
00:57:20,582 --> 00:57:22,265
Can you understand me?

566
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:26,435
You can't, right?

567
00:57:28,372 --> 00:57:29,600
Can you?

568
00:57:31,462 --> 00:57:33,273
You aren't going to do it, are you?

569
00:57:35,882 --> 00:57:38,923
You oughta make a run for the
beacon and get the hell out of here.

570
00:57:41,722 --> 00:57:45,270
Just do it!
And get out of here.

571
00:57:50,773 --> 00:57:52,065
Come on!

572
00:57:52,983 --> 00:57:55,428
Bring it! Come on!

573
00:57:55,783 --> 00:57:58,395
No, don't!
Don't!  Please!

574
00:58:40,204 --> 00:58:43,937
No, no, no! No!
Look out, look out!

575
00:58:48,664 --> 00:58:50,059
How long has it been?

576
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,305
Nearly six hours since Captain
Wheeler's last transmission.

577
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,345
Just over eight since he
confirmed the loss of SI 22.

578
00:58:56,425 --> 00:58:59,634
Stay on it.  Keep scanning
for the distress beacon.

579
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:00,511
Sir.

580
00:59:00,925 --> 00:59:05,395
We're assembling men for the assault but
we need more.  You think Wheeler's team?

581
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,355
We lost radio contact hours ago.

582
00:59:07,435 --> 00:59:09,291
Any more civilian survivors?

583
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:12,134
Not many.  There's no
telling how many more left.

584
00:59:12,275 --> 00:59:15,099
With your permission, sir,
I would like to start rounding up

585
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,928
anyone with military training
to prep for the assault.

586
00:59:17,963 --> 00:59:23,285
Permission?  We are talking about the
last effort to save our civilization.

587
00:59:23,365 --> 00:59:29,455
Our lives, our world.
This isn't war, this is survival.

588
00:59:29,535 --> 00:59:32,305
- Get as many as you can.
- Yes, sir.

589
01:00:03,056 --> 01:00:04,164
Damn it!

590
01:00:20,507 --> 01:00:23,010
Quick, get us something to block...

591
01:00:24,307 --> 01:00:25,820
Run!

592
01:00:27,927 --> 01:00:29,578
Come on, Lindsey!

593
01:00:35,357 --> 01:00:38,734
Lindsey, Lindsey!

594
01:00:40,107 --> 01:00:41,092
Dad?

595
01:00:43,488 --> 01:00:44,834
Dad!

596
01:00:50,368 --> 01:00:52,121
Lindsey!

597
01:00:59,378 --> 01:01:02,421
No!

598
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:08,205
No! No! No!

599
01:01:08,808 --> 01:01:10,885
Damn you!
No!

600
01:01:21,229 --> 01:01:23,489
No!

601
01:01:24,609 --> 01:01:26,111
Lindsey...

602
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,164
Lindsey!

603
01:01:32,399 --> 01:01:36,169
We've cleared the area,
come with us, you'll be safe.

604
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:47,151
<i>Stop!</i>

605
01:04:43,894 --> 01:04:45,647
Chris!
Hey Meyer!

606
01:04:47,274 --> 01:04:50,854
You got through, I don't believe it.

607
01:04:50,944 --> 01:04:54,315
As for my team though...

608
01:04:54,405 --> 01:04:55,999
they weren't so lucky.

609
01:04:56,235 --> 01:04:57,346
Your daughter?

610
01:04:59,745 --> 01:05:03,996
Gone.  Taken.

611
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:10,035
Well, you're here now.
If anyone can keep you safe, it's us.

612
01:05:12,635 --> 01:05:15,246
I don't think there
is a safe place anymore.

613
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:38,856
You're still alive.

614
01:05:39,826 --> 01:05:41,048
I thought they'd killed you.

615
01:05:43,786 --> 01:05:45,212
What did they do to you?

616
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:47,461
I know their plan.

617
01:05:48,286 --> 01:05:49,406
They showed you?

618
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:52,272
She told me.

619
01:05:53,756 --> 01:05:56,910
- She?
- Your queen.

620
01:05:59,546 --> 01:06:04,047
She got into my head.
And she told me.

621
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:11,197
They are a dying race.

622
01:06:12,577 --> 01:06:16,334
Going planet to planet
harvesting for her.

623
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,577
Their last queen.

624
01:06:20,697 --> 01:06:23,827
And they're keeping her alive.

625
01:06:24,207 --> 01:06:25,588
Oh my God.

626
01:06:26,697 --> 01:06:29,627
I have seen their plan.

627
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:33,271
And we're all going to die.

628
01:06:33,627 --> 01:06:36,377
No no no!
Don't lose hope.

629
01:06:36,457 --> 01:06:39,105
Look, I need you.
Look look look.

630
01:06:39,106 --> 01:06:41,203
We still have the beacon.
It should be charged now.

631
01:06:41,238 --> 01:06:44,728
We can contact Control.
Tell them to bring the fight here.

632
01:06:45,888 --> 01:06:48,041
Get these bastards where they live.

633
01:06:48,888 --> 01:06:50,162
How?

634
01:06:51,148 --> 01:06:53,507
Just stay strong with me.

635
01:07:05,278 --> 01:07:08,254
- Southard.
- Ah, Captain.

636
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:13,555
- Are you all right?
- No, please tell me there's a plan.

637
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:15,656
We're working on it.

638
01:07:16,088 --> 01:07:17,344
Oh!

639
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:20,710
Oh!

640
01:08:27,641 --> 01:08:29,658
Kill good, you bastard!

641
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:37,415
- James!
- Hang on!

642
01:08:37,421 --> 01:08:40,534
- Oh, it hurts!
- Gonna get you out of here.

643
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:45,341
Oh, no, get out of here!

644
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,659
Go! Get out of here!  Go!

645
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,142
Oh God!

646
01:09:54,993 --> 01:09:59,107
Mission Control, this is Captain
James Wheeler, do you copy?  Over.

647
01:10:00,623 --> 01:10:04,500
Mission Control, this is Captain Wheeler.
Do you copy?

648
01:10:10,003 --> 01:10:15,604
I hope you're reading this.
We have encountered...

649
01:10:16,394 --> 01:10:19,664
...alien hostiles.

650
01:10:20,144 --> 01:10:26,404
And found that they are abducting humans
and bringing in to their home planet.

651
01:10:27,154 --> 01:10:32,164
There are several...
hundreds more in captivity.

652
01:10:34,694 --> 01:10:37,802
We found a way to travel through
one of their orb transports

653
01:10:37,803 --> 01:10:39,947
and I suggest you do the same.

654
01:10:41,784 --> 01:10:47,904
They are a dying, desperate race.

655
01:10:48,214 --> 01:10:50,585
There is still hope for
us to wipe them out.

656
01:10:52,135 --> 01:10:56,305
The asteroid is a launching dock.

657
01:10:57,135 --> 01:11:01,435
Fly to it and fire a nuke into the cave
near the tracking rods that we've marked.

658
01:11:01,515 --> 01:11:05,105
That will blast it from its core.

659
01:11:05,185 --> 01:11:07,105
My...

660
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:12,515
My entire team, they died as heroes.

661
01:11:12,905 --> 01:11:15,409
Please, don't let
their deaths be in vain.

662
01:11:17,385 --> 01:11:19,325
You give 'em power

663
01:11:20,495 --> 01:11:22,866
and the best of luck to you all.

664
01:11:26,746 --> 01:11:32,346
If you are listening to this,
you are the resistance.

665
01:11:33,136 --> 01:11:35,210
Mankind’s final hope.

666
01:11:37,716 --> 01:11:39,256
Over and out.

667
01:12:25,187 --> 01:12:26,661
They're coming.

668
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:30,967
And they're gonna
wipe out your entire race!

669
01:12:35,277 --> 01:12:37,514
Chris! Chris!

670
01:12:37,777 --> 01:12:39,349
You gonna want to hear this.

671
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:56,548
Soon, we'll be deploying the
greatest assault in our world's history.

672
01:12:56,628 --> 01:12:59,338
Against a threat like never before.

673
01:12:59,428 --> 01:13:01,737
Early this morning we
received a transmission

674
01:13:01,738 --> 01:13:04,423
from United States Marine
Captain James Wheeler.

675
01:13:04,468 --> 01:13:09,386
In it, he told us that they are
holding several civilians captive.

676
01:13:09,387 --> 01:13:10,830
Lindsey.

677
01:13:10,838 --> 01:13:13,729
But he also told us
how to fight them.

678
01:13:13,809 --> 01:13:15,861
Where we can take this
battle to their doorstep

679
01:13:15,862 --> 01:13:18,975
and make them wish that they
never stepped on to our planet.

680
01:13:19,069 --> 01:13:24,165
Captain Wheeler and his squad
gave their lives for this information.

681
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:27,909
And now it's our turn
to honor their sacrifice.

682
01:13:27,999 --> 01:13:34,332
This isn't about politics, or national
interests or protecting resources.

683
01:13:34,367 --> 01:13:39,629
This is a struggle for
all mankind to survive.

684
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:42,169
And we will!

685
01:13:42,259 --> 01:13:45,139
We will survive.

686
01:13:45,219 --> 01:13:47,969
Now and forever.

687
01:13:48,059 --> 01:13:54,610
And the universe will know
that this... this is our world!

688
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:06,370
Two teams will fight simultaneously.
Assault and Rescue.

689
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:10,290
Assault will be travelling to the
alien rock outside of our atmosphere.

690
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:13,940
We will focus our attack on
the designated marked target.

691
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:17,130
A clean shot should
blow it from its core.

692
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:22,010
- As for Rescue... Colonel.
- We capture one of the alien craft.

693
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:24,449
We'll take the civilians
via weaponized portal,

694
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:27,632
immediately transporting them
back to their home planet.

695
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:32,521
Rescue, you'll move heavily armed,
eliminating any hostiles on site...

696
01:14:32,611 --> 01:14:36,374
retrieve any civilians
back to the portal.

697
01:14:37,651 --> 01:14:42,281
Let's teach this brave new
world the meaning of fear.

698
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:53,201
I'm trying, baby.

699
01:15:22,772 --> 01:15:23,752
Are you ready?

700
01:15:30,242 --> 01:15:32,262
Let's do this.

701
01:15:37,203 --> 01:15:40,242
Dad, will you help me?

702
01:15:40,543 --> 01:15:42,808
The SI 22's are fueled up and ready.

703
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:45,463
Space.  It will be a new
part of experience for me.

704
01:15:45,543 --> 01:15:48,072
Don't get lost up there, Colonel.
We're counting on you.

705
01:15:48,073 --> 01:15:49,029
Yes, sir.

706
01:15:58,103 --> 01:16:03,153
Okay, I almost got it.
You might feel a tingling sensation.

707
01:16:16,914 --> 01:16:19,948
Eagle Star 1.  Fighters all in.
Locked on **.

708
01:16:20,049 --> 01:16:21,455
Roger!

709
01:16:27,694 --> 01:16:29,119
What the hell?

710
01:16:33,924 --> 01:16:36,576
- Anyone else coming?
- More coming.

711
01:16:37,344 --> 01:16:40,101
Let's get our bearings and
keep pushing forward.

712
01:17:04,165 --> 01:17:05,841
Looks like it up there.

713
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:15,425
Okay, listen up.
We're heading to their compound.

714
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:17,470
We're going in loud.
Heavy gunners,

715
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:21,505
I want you blasting the living hell
out of everything that is inhuman.

716
01:17:21,515 --> 01:17:24,360
Ready?
Let's move up!

717
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:37,311
They know we're coming.

718
01:18:40,678 --> 01:18:42,147
Come on.
Let's keep moving.

719
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,352
Look out turning the left.
Go to the main entry.

720
01:22:06,263 --> 01:22:09,194
Enemy craft.  Enemy craft.
Fighters engage!

721
01:22:14,344 --> 01:22:17,764
Is that all you got?

722
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,894
Lindsey! Lindsey!

723
01:22:21,984 --> 01:22:23,265
Dad!

724
01:22:24,484 --> 01:22:30,551
Oh, I found you, I found you!
Are you okay? Let me see you.

725
01:22:31,034 --> 01:22:33,784
- Dad, it was terrible.
- Oh I know, I'm so sorry.

726
01:22:34,664 --> 01:22:37,467
- Come on, we gotta go! Come on!
- Let's get you out of here. Come on.

727
01:22:47,835 --> 01:22:50,715
No!

728
01:23:02,065 --> 01:23:04,275
Lindsey!

729
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,615
- Dad...
- Oh, God.

730
01:23:08,695 --> 01:23:10,049
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

731
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:18,035
- Dad.
- You gonna be okay.

732
01:23:18,115 --> 01:23:21,546
- Take me home, Dad.
- Okay.

733
01:23:21,626 --> 01:23:24,623
Okay baby. Stay with me.
Let's go home now.

734
01:23:30,716 --> 01:23:33,483
- I'm out!
- We're out of missiles!

735
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:34,937
Damn!

736
01:23:37,556 --> 01:23:40,486
- Am I late?
- General Magowan?

737
01:23:40,636 --> 01:23:41,665
That's right.

738
01:23:42,746 --> 01:23:45,527
Get these guys off so
I can get a clean shot.

739
01:23:45,528 --> 01:23:48,480
You heard the General.
Evasive maneuvers, let's go.

740
01:23:55,036 --> 01:23:59,417
Target locked.
Welcome to oblivion.

741
01:24:01,577 --> 01:24:03,189
Fighters, pull back!

742
01:24:08,047 --> 01:24:11,390
- Excellent job, sir.
- My pleasure.

743
01:24:19,217 --> 01:24:22,687
Lindsey no!  Stay with me.
Open your eyes, baby. Open your eyes.

744
01:24:22,967 --> 01:24:26,017
No Lindsey, open your eyes,
Lindsey.  Stay with me!

745
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:28,959
Dad.

746
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:31,959
Please, it's over.

747
01:25:41,389 --> 01:25:44,100
Please...

748
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,682
It's not.

749
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:54,070
It's not over.

750
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,755
Not yet.
