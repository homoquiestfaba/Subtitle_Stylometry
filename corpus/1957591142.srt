1
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,818
[toilet flushing]

2
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,428
[blowing nose]

3
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,662
Are you serious?

4
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:04,864
It's haraam.

5
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,366
It's not mine.

6
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,368
It was in our bathroom.

7
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,602
It's probably Mom and Dad's.

8
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,604
You can't be having sex.

9
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,373
You can't be having sex.

10
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,874
Bitch, why are you
still holding it?

11
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,476
Don't call me that!

12
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,610
I said it's not mine.

13
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,312
[scoffs]
Oh, okay.

14
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,254
-Give me twenty-five dollars.
-Why?

15
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,656
Then I won't tell Mom and Dad.

16
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,494
[grunts]

17
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:37,864
I need to tell you something.

18
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,932
What?

19
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,300
It's about time
for you to grow up.

20
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,502
How about you grow up, bitch?

21
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,903
[sighs]

22
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,173
Who was it with?

23
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,408
[sighs]

24
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,844
[door slams]

25
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,783
Shit.

26
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,331
Hey, man.

27
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,234
Hey.

28
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,270
Come on, let's go.

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,343
Hey, you want to come to my
mom's birthday dinner tonight?

30
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,578
Not really.

31
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,714
If I would go to your
mother's birthday party dinner,

32
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,949
what would I bring?

33
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,618
Well, she eats halal.

34
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,585
She loves chicken.

35
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,588
I told I'd make her
a roast chicken, so--

36
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,891
Okay, so we need
a halal butcher.

37
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,626
[chuckles]

38
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,427
I was thinking
we could do that ourselves.

39
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,829
A live chicken?

40
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,863
Dude, that's disgusting.

41
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:44,931
What are you talkin' about?

42
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,766
That's the proper thing to do.

43
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,736
Like we always do the
proper Muslim thing to do.

44
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,844
Ready to sell like
a thousand dollars today?

45
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,646
Yeah.

46
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,714
[chuckles]
Must be like a tiger, man.

47
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,917
You ready, huh? Huh?

48
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,553
Know what?

49
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,722
Birthday parties
are so oppressive.

50
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,524
First, you gotta go.

51
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,561
Then they expect a gift,
as if bein' there ain't enough.

52
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,497
You listen to books on tape?

53
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,532
Yeah.

54
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,741
Everything good at your house?

55
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,643
Yeah.
Yeah, it's all good.

56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,925
No, actually, I've never
really read books on tape.

57
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,032
I listened to
Pride and Prejudice
one time.

58
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,535
[chuckles]
Never went to that class.

59
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,638
Hey.

60
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,639
Hey, yo!

61
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,974
Hey, yo, what's up?

62
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:01,874
[chuckles]
What's up, man?

63
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,875
What's up?

64
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,910
Hey.

65
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:04,877
You wanna buy a gun?

66
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,979
No.

67
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:06,980
Smith and Wesson.

68
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,348
Yo, is that real?

69
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,482
Yeah.

70
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,817
Is it hot?

71
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,651
No.

72
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,419
It's got no serial numbers,
either.

73
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,490
How much?

74
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,791
I could do two hundred.

75
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,428
How about seventy-five?

76
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,430
No, man.
I can't go that low.

77
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,065
One fifty.

78
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,867
It's the best I can do.

79
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,374
[scoffs]
Get the fuck outta here.

80
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,842
Ain't nobody
trying to get no gun.

81
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,512
Were you fucking serious?

82
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,947
[laughs]
No.

83
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,049
You think he's selling guns
to anybody who walks by?

84
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,418
It's a hell of a lot
better than being robbed.

85
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,053
[laughs]

86
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,030
Excuse me.

87
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:57,964
You sell soda?

88
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,766
No, no sodas.

89
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,502
Uh, twenty
Powerball tickets, please.

90
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,703
Twenty for me, too, please.

91
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,572
Okay, that'll be
forty-seven dollars.

92
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,807
BOTH: What?

93
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,643
Isn't there like a price break
if you buy more than twenty?

94
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,880
So there's no discount
if we buy in bulk at all?

95
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,848
No, New York State Lotto, man.

96
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:16,749
-What do you think?
-Man, ain't nobody

97
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,618
trying to hear all that.

98
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,759
What is this?

99
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,866
Hey, I can try some of this?

100
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,470
Ain't gonna
gimme no discount either,

101
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,372
let me use nothin', man.

102
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,942
Smell good, though.

103
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,695
Alright, man.

104
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,930
Ten each.

105
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,667
-Gonna be twenty-three fifty.
-Can I get these, too?

106
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,036
-That'll be five dollars.
-What?

107
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,838
Christians?

108
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,541
I'ma stick to these
lotions and potions.

109
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,610
Can I get that
Escape
right there?

110
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,580
And then the
Juicy Couture.

111
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,683
That green
Bob Marley
over there.

112
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,917
Chocolate.

113
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,786
Let me get that
Lick Me All Over.

114
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,455
And then uh,
can I get the
Grape Crush?

115
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,126
One more.
I'll go with the
Escada.

116
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,093
I need ten each, man.

117
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,028
Five small five big.

118
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,767
-That'll be eighty dollars.
-Eighty dollars.

119
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,935
Comin' out my pockets.

120
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,639
These are amazing.

121
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,040
Think I'm gonna sell these.

122
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,709
Man, that's an appropriation.

123
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,943
But they're beautiful.

124
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,111
You're not even Catholic.

125
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,514
What do you know?

126
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,582
These are art.

127
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,985
Besides, what does religion
have to do with selling?

128
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,554
Excuse me, ma'am.

129
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,488
Hey.

130
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,990
You look like you
could use a Lotto card.

131
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,591
I do?

132
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,260
Yeah, and I happen
to have a very lucky one

133
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,761
right here in my hand for you.

134
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,663
You like a saint card, Sir?

135
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:11,864
Saint card, Miss?

136
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,699
Lotto, saint, you put 'em
together, you get a explosion.

137
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,001
[laughs]
Big money.

138
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,702
I mean, it's perfect for...

139
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,604
a lady such as yourself.

140
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:19,872
[laughs]
Very nice.

141
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,508
Please.

142
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,242
Lady, I don't know.

143
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,177
You're blushin'.
You're blushin'.

144
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,011
I see it.

145
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,546
They're only
five dollars, that's it.

146
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,480
That's all.

147
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,016
Oh, thank you. No.
No, I don't want one.

148
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,284
Hey, hey.
Want to buy a Lotto ticket?

149
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,219
These are lucky tickets, plus it
helps benefit my college fund.

150
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,821
No.
No, thank you.

151
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,788
Shit.

152
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,790
It would really help
with our college fund.

153
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,892
Okay.

154
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,093
Okay, I'll take it.

155
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,261
That's what talkin' about.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

156
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,963
I hope it's a winning ticket.

157
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:44,964
I hope so, too.

158
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:45,832
I hope so, too.

159
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,099
I really wish you
the best of luck.

160
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,669
Can I interest you in a Lotto
ticket or a saint card, Miss?

161
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:50,303
Big win.

162
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,604
They're lucky.

163
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,943
Ooh!

164
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,686
Couple Muslim kids
tried to buy a gun.

165
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,289
How'd you know
they were Muslim?

166
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,624
The hat thing.

167
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,826
Were they serious?

168
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,594
That was the feeling that I got.

169
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,029
Well, did they buy it?

170
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,298
Well, no, but they
haggled with me.

171
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,733
Hmm.

172
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,836
Well, that doesn't
sound like a lead.

173
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,841
Right there.

174
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,943
Huh.

175
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,218
You like a Lotto ticket, Miss?
Saint card?

176
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,853
Saint Anthony, Saint Paul.

177
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,021
Miracle workers.

178
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,622
Sir, would you
like a Lotto ticket?

179
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,723
Saint card?

180
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,728
[CHANTING]

181
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,797
You hear that?

182
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,833
Yeah, it's Asr.

183
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,101
Yeah, we should go.

184
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,670
Yeah.

185

than it does on you.

223
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,167
Uh, it's has to do with,
like, the person's chemistry.

224
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,303
I think somehow like
personality comes in some way,

more about synergy
and stuff like that.

227
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,073
It might have to do with,
like, blood flow

to match it up with people.

I think that's totally wrong.

235
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,452
I think it has something to do
with like the skin texture,

236
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,387
how soft the skin is, you know?

237

Dead ass?

363
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,175
Yeah.

364
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,280
Alright.
We'll just steer clear.

365
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,082
Yeah, I'll meet you out there.

366
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,820
Yo, could I see
that hat right there?

367
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,296
How much?

368
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,398
One dollar, please.

369
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,534
Why you wastin' all your
college tuition on mangoes?

370
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,770
Gotta spend money
to make money, right?

371
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,439
So messy.

372
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,508
Muhammad ate mangoes.

373
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,675
How do you know that?

374
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,778
Always read about
him eating mangoes.

375
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,713
You enjoying that mango?

376
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,148
[chuckles]

377
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,482
Yes, I am.

378
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,353
Yeah.

379
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,121
It is terrific.

380
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,461
Hey, what'd you
dream about last night?

381
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,597
I can't remember.

382
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,233
I always have these dreams
where I'm paralyzed.

383
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,207
You gonna ask me
what I dreamt about?

384
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,508
What did you dream about?

385
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,745
I dreamt I was pregnant.

386
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,313
[laughs]

387
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,381
Amazing.

388
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,715
[chuckles]
No, it wasn't amazing.

389
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,783
It freaking hurt.

390
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,718
How does it hurt in your dream?

391
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,834
Man, look at all these condos.

392
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,868
This one has a pool.

393
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,169
They're makin' this place
look like Manhattan.

394
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,704
This is Brooklyn.

395
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,573
Everybody wants
to live in Manhattan.

396
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,209
That's why they make
Brooklyn look like Manhattan.

397
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,448
Hey, how you doin'?

398
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,421
Man, fuck all these
homes and condos.

399
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,733
What is that?

400
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,802
I made it for you.

401
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,272
-For me?
-For you.

402
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,641
-For me?
-For you.

403
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:06,678
What?

404
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:07,846
Made it for you.

405
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,847
Gimme this.
Gimme the rock.

406
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:09,882
I will keep it.

407
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,517
I will put it up
in my dresser...

408
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,417
Thank you, brah.

409
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,485
-for you.
-Yes.

410
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,420
-'Cause you--
-Yes.

411
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,823
"The unmarried woman
or unmarried man

412
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,325
"found guilty
of sexual intercourse,

413
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,861
"lash each one of them
with a hundred lashes

414
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,863
"and do not be

00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,465

"if you should believe

417
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,836
Alright.

418
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,841
On your mark, get set, go!

419
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,776
What are you--
[grunts]

420
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,545
[breathing heavily]
Boy, you better run it.

421
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,646
Boy, you better run it!

422
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,415
[grunts]

423
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,554
[laughs]

424
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,256
Only Allah can judge me.

425
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,624
I'm sure of that.

426
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,792
You know,
all these people are---

427
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,427
What are they?
They perfect now?

428
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,628
No.

429
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,729
We'll see.

430
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,432
We'll see when we meet Muhammad.
I'll pray for them.

431
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,567
We'll see.

432
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,303
You think the
world's getting better?

433
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,704
Yeah.

434
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,506
Mmm.

435
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,942
I don't think so.

436
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,946
Change gets too much credit.

437
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,348
People confuse it with progress.

438
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,917
They don't even
realize the truth.

439
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,852
Change happens all the time.

440
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,621
Bad change.

441
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,293
What are you talking about?

442
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,463
Things are improving
all the time.

443
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,398
They mostly regress.

444
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,300
No one respects anyone anymore.

445
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,402
More inmates
than there were slaves.

446
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,871
Education's for shit
unless you're loaded.

447
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,708
You can't get rich
unless you were born rich.

448
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,845
I mean, yeah.

449
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,617
I don't know, man.

450
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,486
Bad times, real bad.

451
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,931
You want a Lotto card?

452
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,036
Some--
Want some smell goods?

453
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,472
[sighs]

454
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,440
Want a saint card?

455
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,570
Man, I don't
totally disagree with you,

456
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,973
but it's really not as bad
as you're makin' this out.

457
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:51,877
You're only
focusing on the negative.

458
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,744
I mean, look.

459
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,146
There's bike lanes
all over the city.

460
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,049
-Bike lanes?
-Yeah, bike lanes.

461
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,583
People in America
were getting too fat,

462
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,452
so now there's bike lanes.

463
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,753
Terrorism.

464
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,922
That has definitely made
the world a worser place.

465
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,658
I mean, they take
away people's rights.

466
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,094
Wiretaps, full body scans.

467
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,063
So, you want bombs on planes?

468
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,465
No, I'm saying that
everybody shouldn't suffer

469
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,633
for what a few do.

470
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,434
-Alright, I understand.
-That's all.

471
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,702
If it only happens
to one person,

472
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,003
that's called profiling,

473
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,938
but if it happens to everybody,

474
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,174
that's what
makes it fair, right?

475
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,010
How is it fair when you can
barely go through the airport

476
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,578
without being
considered a terrorist

477
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,879
because of the way you look?

478
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,481
It's how airports
have always been.

479
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,817
Goin' through the fucking
security checks,

480
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,553
everyone hated that
since the beginning of time.

481
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,620
That's nothin' new.

482
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:36,855
Whatever.

483
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,157
[grunts]

484
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,025
Huh?

485
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:40,759
Almost fell.

486
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,127
[chuckles]

487
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,064
[sighs]

488
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,572
There's nothing convenient
about that thing.

489
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,173
I don't see why use it.

490
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,811
Sometimes you get on
my nerves, you know that?

491
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,223
-When did you get so tense?
-Don't do that.

492
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,157
Why?

493
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,160
-Nobody's lookin'.
-You don't know that.

494
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,140
You think it's wrong
to sell these?

495
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,676
They're like prophets.

496
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,955
Uh-- Uh,

497
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,058
"We have believed in Allah
and in what was revealed to us

498
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:51,196
"and what was revealed to
Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob

499
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,864
"and the descendants,

500
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,767
"and in what was given
to Moses and Jesus

501
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,270
"and to the prophets
from their Lord.

502
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:02,574
"We make no distinction
between any of them."

503
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,042
Mmm.

504
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,611
Well, now.

505
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,749
I mean, I guess it's really
not haraam to be sellin' 'em.

506
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,685
"God will pay those who
believe and do good deeds

507
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,086
"their reward in full.

508
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,889
"God does not love evildoers."

509
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,960
Guess that means you.

510
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,929
Shut up.

511
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,064
Mmm.

512
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,883
Hey, I had a really
good time last night.

513
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,686
Me, too.

514
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,854
Yeah.

515
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,943
Were you really
gonna buy that gun?

516
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:13,612
What gun you talkin' about?

517
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,914
Gun the guy
was trying to sell us.

518
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,716
Oh, yeah.

519
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,783
That gun.

520
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,051
[laughs]

521
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:20,919
[scoffs]
No.

522
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,621
I was just trying
to make you laugh.

523
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,957
You are a real comedian.

524
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,225
[laughs]

525
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,293
Alright.

526
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,062
"Health care has gotten
better in past ten years.

527
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,665
"New hospital intake methods
result in fewer deaths

528
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,934
"and war, too."

529
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,102
So?

530
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:42,140
"Crime has gone down and so
has deaths when crimes happen."

531
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,776
It took forty stab wounds
to kill Caesar.

532
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,111
It would have took way more
with today's medicine.

533
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,646
Really.

534
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,893
No, but seriously.

535
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,195
Why don't you agree with me?

536
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,897
The world's starting
to become a worse place.

537
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,299
Because you're wrong.

538
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,366
Whatever.

539
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,302
I want to sell more.

540
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,637
I'm selling these now.
You want some candy?

541
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,141
Yo, these are not candy,
and the truth ain't as sweet.

542
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,314
Hold on.

543
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,648

to lie to an FBI agent.

727
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,847
Okay.

728
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,285
Okay.

729
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,620
Great.

730
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,790
Well, thanks so much
for helping me out.

731
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,794
Aren't you going in?

732
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,429
I need to get a soda.

733
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,779
Thank you.

734
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,802
[sighs]

735
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,471
[grunts]

736
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,347
Who let you in?

737
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,815
Cala.

738
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,385
But she's at the movies now.

739
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,086
What the fuck was that?

740
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,421
What do you mean?

741
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,990
What the hell
is wrong wit'chyou?

742
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,692
A few things.

743
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,730
Special Agent Sarah Mickell,
the FBI lady,

744
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,099
you didn't want to text me
she was comin' by?

745
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,067
I did.

746
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,002
I called you.
You didn't answer my calls.

747
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,804
You didn't say
what it was about.

748
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,739
Call me back then.

749
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,141
This is about earlier, isn't it?

750
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,877
I called you earlier.

751
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,745
You could say whatever you
want, but you're lying to me.

752
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,347
You screwed me over on purpose.

753
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,549
What?

754
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,383
I didn't.

755
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:39,850
I wouldn't.

756
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:40,718
I love you, man.

757
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,153
I'm not so sure
about that right now.

758
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,721
[clicks tongue]
Alright.

759
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,826
[grunting/chuckling]

760
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,862
Ew,
you're wearing potion shit.

761
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,031
Oh, that's some
Baby Mama Drama .

762
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,399
[chuckles]
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

763
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,868
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

764
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:58,669
[laughs]

765
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,037
Hello.

766
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,809
Hi, Mom.

767
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,977
Are you stealing stuff
from your sister again?

768
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,912
No.

769
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,080
Don't do that.

770
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,981
What were you doing?

771
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,051
We needed her
calculator, for sales.

772
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,854
You're doing that again?

773
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,856
Yeah, we sold a lot today.

774
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,692
Oh, great.

775
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,762
I'm gonna say hi to your dad.

776
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,063
As-salaam alaykum, Maalik.

777
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,665
Alaykum as-salaam.

778
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,922
I got you a hat.

779
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,200
Thanks.

780
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,177
We gotta go.
I'm having dinner at Maalik's.

781
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,218
You know it's
gonna be fine, right?

782
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,319
She's not onto us

783
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,656
for the Lotto cards
and the saint cards and candy.

784
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,558
-She could be.
-She's not.

785
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,494
She's just checkin' us out.
That's it.

786
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,730
Well, we're not terrorists.

787
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,430
Fuck that.

788
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,999
What if she tells our parents?

789
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,801
Why would she tell our parents?

790
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,105
Well, you could
at least say you're sorry.

791
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,074
Hey, did she
molest you or somethin'?

792
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,709
No.

793
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,912
-My goodness.
-What are you smilin' about?

794
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,781
You're so sensitive about this.

795
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,882
Come on.

796
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,651
You could at least
say you're sorry.

797
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:54,919
About what?

798
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,787
Earlier.

799
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,656
I'm sorry, I'm never sorry.

800
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,292
So, you're sorry
you're never sorry?

801
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,092
Not really.

802
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,061
-So you never felt guilt?
-Nope.

803
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:04,495
Remorse?

804
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,030
Absolutely not.

805
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:13,037
[clanging on bars]

806
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,397
[grunting]

807
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,167
Hit, hit, hit,
hit, hit, hit, hit.

808
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,768
Die, you evildoer, die.

809
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,303
Die, you evildoer.
[grunts]

810
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,038
What happened with
the guy I left you with?

811
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,273
Who?

812
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,808
The guy.

813
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,209
What'cha talkin' about?

814
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,111
I think you do.

815
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,946
The hot yuppie guy, man.

816
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,580
Oh.

817
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,648
He was cool.

818
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,085
Did he get anything?

819
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,087
A ticket.

820
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,622
And he gave me these.

821
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,094
Little beanies?

822
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,695
What are you
gonna do with those?

823
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,164
Mark 'em up for the subway.

824
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,134
[scoffs] I really question
the intelligence of that move.

825
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:20,237
Yo, I question the intelligence
of your intelligence constantly.

826
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:20,971
What?

827
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,340
No, you don't.
I'm a genius.

828
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,880
Alright, let's go get
these bikes and this chicken.

829
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,181
Grab that.

830
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,950
[scoffs]

831
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,029
Excuse me.

832
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,297
Sorry to bother you.

833
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,967
Will you help my family pay for
my brother's cancer treatment?

834
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:56,807
Here.

835
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,342
Thank you.

836
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,129
[grunts]

837
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,141
I give away money once a day.

838
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,142
To bums?

839
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,344
Those were kids.

840
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,979
The other had cancer.

841
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,947
That's dumb.

842
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,248
Wow.

843
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,384
That money's not
gonna amount to shit.

844
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,087
Plus, you're only supposed
to give away to Muslims.

845
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,827
Hello, Sir.

846
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,096
Can I interest you in a
saint card or a Lotto ticket?

847
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,331
Seventy million dollar jackpot.

848
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,966
-Alright.
-Here you go, Sir.

849
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,202
Seventy million dollar jackpot.

850
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,070
-Big money.
-Who's not employed?

851
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,338
Sir, you want to look at it?

852
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,973
Yo.

853
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,074
Yo.

854
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,843
Fifty cent, my man.

855
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,278
Uh-huh.

856
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,880
Got your bag.
We thank you.

857
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,782
Look at these right here.

858
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,350
A Lotto ticket.

859
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,386
Got a lot more of those.

860
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,887
Lotto tickets.

861
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,288
Thank you, Sir.

862
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,492
Where's your hat at?

863
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,827
I gave it
to the kid with cancer.

864
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,095
Why?

865
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,864
They need it more than I did.

866
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:27,931
Need it more?

867
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,868
Why would you give away
somethin' I just gave you?

868
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:31,869
I'll give you your money back.

869
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:32,936
It's not about the money.

870
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,005
Why would you give
something that I gave to you?

871
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,775
Why would you just give away
a forty dollar hat like that?

872
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,415
That's some
stupid ass shit, Naz.

873
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,383
Now some kids with
cancer got a brand new hat.

874
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,484
Wow, good for them.

875
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,520
I was tryin' to do this nice,
sweet thing for you,

876
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:50,454
and you're just gonna

877
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:51,422
give my shit
away to some little thieves?

878
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,056
-Fuck you, man.
-Don't do me that way again.

879
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,324
Gonna hit you in the face.

880
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,094
Jesus.

881
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,162
Let's just try again.

882
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,763
Fuck off.

883
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,231
We're done for the day.

884
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,770
Are you an asshole?

885
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,172
Remember when
I sold that homeless lady

886
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,239
the Lotto card for two dollars?

887
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,074
Yeah.

888
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,208
That was me
givin' alms to the poor.

889
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,242
That was you hustling the poor.

890
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,111
I sold her something
of value at a fair price.

891
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,846
Lotto cards have zero value.

892
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,515
So, then, why do you sell 'em?
Why does anybody buy them?

893
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,351
[automated voice announcement]

894
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,932
So, what happened again
with the yuppie?

895
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,335
Literally, nothin'.

896
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,604
Alright, later on then.

897
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,239
I said nothing!

898
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,342
Oh, so you guys we're just
talkin' about Beanie Babies

899
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,310
and shit like that,
and that's it?

900
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,513
I'm just tryin
to sell things.

901
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:23,413
What?

902
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,083
I'm trying to raise
money for college.

903
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,317
You're trying to raise money
for college

904
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,418
by going into strangers' houses

905
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,287
and selling 'em Beanie Babies
and the saint cards

906
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:30,921
or whatever the fuck else?

907
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,556
Why are being so paranoid?

908
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:33,524
I'm being paranoid?

909
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,326
I called you twice.
I fuckin' texted you.

910
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,127
I'm not hearing anything back.

911
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,328
What am I supposed
to think, Naz?

912
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,463
What, are you jealous?

913
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:40,464
Yes.

914
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:41,965
Maybe I am.

915
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:45,102
You need to show me
some more respect.

916
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,403
[sighs]

917
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:51,208
You know, uh, Deshawn
from science class?

918
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,409
Right?

919
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:53,510
The one's who's been flirtin'
with me for a few months?

920
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:54,144
He wants to invite me
over to the house tomorrow.

921
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,379
His mom said it's alright.

922
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,347
She's not gonna be home, but
she's totally cool with that.

923
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:58,482
-Are you cool with that?
-Okay.

924
00:46:58,515 --> 00:46:59,716
As long as you don't fuck him.

925
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,919
Well, at least I'll fuckin'
text you back and let you know!

926
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,087
I'll let you know
everything that's happening.

927
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,190
You're the fuckin' asshole, Naz.

928
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,927
Yeah!

929
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,565
I'm not a fuckin' asshole.

930
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:38,021
Kid at home got
a two foot long dick!

931
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,990
I know he's my son!

932
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:45,128
[laughs]
Oh, boy, I tell ya.

933
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,263
Crazy.
[chuckles]
Oh, crazy.

934
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,298
Oh, you don't feel like talking!

935
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,500
Well, excuse me!

936
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:56,039
I was just making what's
called polite conversation!

937
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,110
White niggers!

938
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:02,145
Steve Jobs!

939
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,947
Mitch Romney!

940
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:07,117
Cary Grant and Donald Crumbs.

941
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,151
Trumps!

942
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:11,288
A category of people I dislike.

943
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,195
Come on, train!

944
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,301
I hate these trains!

945
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,043
Waiting for the G train.

946
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,311
Come on!

947
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,217
I hate the G train!

948
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,454
Give it up.

949
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:44,855
Give it up.

950
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:45,555
Give it up.

951
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,224
Give it up!

952
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,060
When is it gonna come?

953
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:51,995
[P.A. Walla]

954
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,664
Aw, man!

955
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,683
Surprise!

956
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,385
I'm here!

957
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,554
[laughs]

958
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,756
[laughs]
Excuse me.

959
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,191
Excuse me.

960
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,025
Don't touch this bag.

961
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,393
I got
millions of dollars in here.

962
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,228
This is worth millions
[laughs]

963
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,496
Excuse me.

964
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,165
Excuse me.

965
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,170
[laughs]

966
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,705
Iran!

967
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,107
What's the deal with Iran?

968
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,277
Iran is run by a
crazy motherfucker called

969
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,179
Achamadimejad.

970
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:47,250
For a guy who claims he
hates the gays and the Jews,

971
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:51,588
Abamedoomadoobie
always in New York!

972
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,023
[laughs]

973
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,424
I gotta go.

974
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,428
You've all been
a great audience.

975
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,297
[laughs]

976
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,064
Yeah.

977
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,133
[laughs]

978
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,234
Here.

979
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,236
Thank you.
Oh, love your nails.

980
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,804
[laughs]

981
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,644
What?

982
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,314
He did the train
a good service, man.

983
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,323
[laughs]

984
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,598
Hey.

985
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,133
Hey.

986
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,836
What'd you say to the
FBI lady about last night?

987
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,605
She asked where I was,
things like that.

988
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,173
What'd you say?

989
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,808
Just what I said
to my parents,

990
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,844
that we were at Dan's.

991
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:58,782
What?

992
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,550
I told her the truth.

993
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,590
Why did you tell her the truth?

994
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,624
Listen to yourself.

995
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:08,825
She's not our parents.

996
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:12,262
We agreed that was our line
to our parents, to whoever.

997
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,698
What the hell?
You don't lie to an FBI agent.

998
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,566
I could go to jail for this.

999
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,269
Yeah.

1000
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,871
But don't say that.

1001
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,406
You mean don't
drag you into this.

1002
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,208
Well, it kinda
sucks for me, too.

1003
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,977
It'll come out
real fast why you lied.

1004
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,779
You deserve this
just as much as I do.

1005
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,414
Say you're sorry.

1006
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:32,649
No.

1007
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,453
We need to go to Dan's
and talk to him or somethin'.

1008
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,655
She'll probably go there too.

1009
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:39,956
Fuck you.

1010
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,726
I tried to warn you.

1011
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,861
Take out your phone.

1012
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,696
-Take out your phone!
-No.

1013
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,797
You see where it says,
"Call me?"

1014
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,199
Did you call me?

1015
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,939
Allah's punishing us.

1016
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,608
This is Allah punishing me
for trusting you.

1017
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,658
[cell phone vibrates]

1018
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,961
Fuck.

1019
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,062
Now your sister knows, too?

1020
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:22,966
Yeah, we got into a big
fight at home this morning.

1021
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,034
I thought you said

1022
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,635
everything was good
at your house this mornin'.

1023
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:26,436
Yeah.

1024
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,805
And that was a lie.

1025
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,275
I always wished
my brother would find out

1026
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,843
and tell my parents for me.

1027
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,313
I'll tell my
father at his grave.

1028
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:37,914
-What are we gonna say to Dan?
-I don't know,

1029
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,382
but if it's gonna work,
we gotta get in there now,

1030
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,417
because she can't
see us walk in,

1031
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,953
and I'm pretty sure
she's on her fuckin' way.

1032
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,590
[intercom ringing]

1033
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:49,526
Hey.

1034
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,433
As-salaam alaykum.

1035
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,935
-Alaykum as-salaam.
-Alaykum salaam.

1036
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,604
What you think, man?

1037
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,474
-Oh, he's a'ight.
-Yeah, alright.

1038
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,476
You know, I don't care to meet
your little ugly nephew either.

1039
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,444
Not bad.

1040
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,678
Not bad?

1041
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:10,714
This right here is the next
president of the United States.

1042
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,616
-A young Barack Obama.
-Whatever.

1043
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:13,984
-Look at him.
-You drop him yet?

1044
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:14,918
Ain't nobody around here
droppin' no baby, man.

1045
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,853
How much you clowns
make today, anyways?

1046
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,388
-We sold all sorts of stuff.
-Shh.

1047
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,724
Potions, peanuts, oils.

1048
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,058
-Oils?
-These crazy prayer cards.

1049
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,827
And some--

1050
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,029
Like two hundred dollars
in two hours.

1051
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,564
Then let me in on five.

1052
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,833
Ah, yeah.
What the hell?

1053
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,335
"Blessed Catherine,
Child of God."

1054
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,904
Man, this is some haraam trash.

1055
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,107
I made sixty,
but I picked up something

1056
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,908
I think is gonna
be worth a lot more.

1057
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,579
Oh, Lord.
What did you pick up?

1058
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,014
What the fuck?

1059
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:49,085
That's what- that's what you--
Really? Seriously?

1060
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:49,953
You know, that stuff stinks.

1061
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,821
Watch me profit it
on the flip side.

1062
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:52,889
Profit?

1063
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,724
On stuffed snake?

1064
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:57,861
[chuckles]
That's a horrible investment.

1065
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:58,695
Whatever.

1066
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,130
They were a gift.

1067
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:02,132
I'd re-gift that one ASAP.

1068
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,867
Can I have some water?

1069
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,636
Uh, I'm a little occupied
with my little soldier.

1070
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,539
You can, uh, go over
there and get you some.

1071
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,942
Alright.
[mock growl]

1072
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,444
Hmm.

1073
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,245
[mock growl]

1074
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,347
Good baby, man.
I love the kid.

1075
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:21,951
Come on, baby.

1076
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,687
Good little baby.

1077
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,623
Listen.

1078
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:32,062
Do you think
it's wrong to be gay?

1079
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,396
[sighs]

1080
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,698
Yeah, man.

1081
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,499
Islam is a poem.

1082
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,568
It's not complicated like that.

1083
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,170
Yeah, but a lot of things
are a lot more haraam

1084
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,471
clearly in the Qur'an.

1085
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,772
Sodom, Gomorrah.

1086
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,674
That was about rape,
that wasn't about being gay.

Yeah.

1446
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:31,967
Are you in trouble?

1447
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,770
No.

1448
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,310
You guys get home safe, okay?

Yeah.

1450
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:49,885
It's haraam.

1451
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:52,621
Why were you even there?

1452
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,089
Were you following me?

1453
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:59,161
Are you always gonna be gay?

1454
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,934

1455
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,570

1456
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,572

No.

1463
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:51,313
About, you know, being gay.

1464
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,656
I can't do this anymore.

1465
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,190
It's not good.

1466
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,626
With you.

1467
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,168
Why?

1468
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:15,837
Because we're gay?

1469
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:18,073
Or because I'm an asshole?

1470
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:24,012
[sighs]

1471
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,183
I gotta go.

1472
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:30,085

1473
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:38,660

Can't ride your bike
on the platform.

1479
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:06,274

Come on, man.
Don't do this to me, please.

Gonna write you a ticket.

you can take it up

1483
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:12,848
in a court of law
in downtown Brooklyn.

1484
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:16,017
Yo, I lost a lot of money today.
