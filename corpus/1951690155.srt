00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:12,773
<i>Last week on Wild Palms:</i>

2
00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:15,569
I want you to set up an exchange.

3
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:17,439
The chip for Deirdre.

4
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:21,279
He killed Grace.
He's got my daughter.

5
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:24,084
You've got to tell the senator
about the Go-chip.

6
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,152
One day, I'll put out the sun...

7
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:30,223
...and make bare
every womb there ever was.

8
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:31,882
You wanna be a samurai, Harry?

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,220
Now's your chance.

10
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:35,056
I want you to put this on live feed.

11
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,894
Turn it off!

12
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:59,172
This is for Grace Wyckoff!

13
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:09,549
Come on! Move it!

14
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:26,902
<i>Our fearful trip is done</i>

15
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,101
<i>The ship has weather'd every rack</i>

16
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:33,543
<i>The prize we sought is won</i>

17
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:40,550
I'd like to acknowledge the efforts
of one among us.

18
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:43,390
Harry Wyckoff.

19
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,158
How does it feel
to be a leader, Harry?

20
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:55,161
<i>Viva Zapata.</i>

21
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:59,670
You wanna know how I really feel?

22
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:02,167
Sick.

23
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:04,807
Violated.

24
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:09,316
Like I killed Grace a second time
on television.

25
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:11,884
It got results.

26
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:18,582
<i>Eli, they should have moved you right
from the Perceptory to Channel 3.</i>

27
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,661
You would've made a hell
of a programmer, you know that?

28
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:24,763
It was a terrible thing, Harry,
but it opened people's eyes.

29
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,298
Grace would have demanded that.

30
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:28,197
Don't tell me what Grace
would've demanded.

31
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:29,927
You don't know anything about her.

32
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:32,903
- What do you want from me?
- Deirdre.

33
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:37,934
Kreutzer said he would give her back
if we gave him the Go-chip.

34
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:40,911
- I can't do that, Harry.
- Why?

35
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:43,550
Because with the chip,
he'll be immortal.

36
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:47,119
A holographic vampire,
unstoppable from some unspeakable...

37
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:50,155
...unreachable place.
He'll organize the death of the world.

38
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:51,622
You're as crazy as he is!

39
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:54,956
- Oh, listen to me Harry.
- No, listen to me!

40
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,257
I'm gonna have my family back...

41
00:03:57,432 --> 00:04:01,232
...one way or the other.
Do you understand that, Eli?

42
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:06,566
And those are my politics!

43
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:10,171
And you can go to hell.

44
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:15,405
<i>And then, now I'd like
to say a few words.</i>

45
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,982
<i>Hello</i>

46
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:18,449
<i>I must be going</i>

47
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,589
<i>I cannot stay
I came to say, I must be going</i>

48
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:26,216
<i>I'm glad I came, but just the same
I must be going</i>

49
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:31,062
What is it, doc?
A heart attack or indigestion?

50
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:33,962
Stress of the last few days.

51
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:36,160
You're acutely hypertensive.

52
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:38,100
- I'd like to put you in Cedars.
- No.

53
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:40,537
- No hospitals.
- I can't force you.

54
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,936
I'm gonna medicate you.

55
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,079
I want you to stay in bed.
No alcohol or Mimezine.

56
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:49,273
You're no fun. Grindrod.
What about the Go-chip?

57
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,546
If I can get your pressure under control
you've got maybe a week or so.

58
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:56,451
After that, I can't say
what your body will tolerate.

59
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:58,182
A week, huh?

60
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,156
Grindrod!

61
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:05,693
Why haven't you bailed Josie?

62
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:07,529
We're trying.

63
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:10,102
My sister? In jail?

64
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,034
What's the matter with you?

65
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:15,608
Get her out if you have
to break her out!

66
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:22,479
We'll never contain this, Papa.
It's a fiasco.

67
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:24,049
Where's the murder tape?

68
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:25,914
Being treated at the lab.

69
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:29,056
Even the die-hard New Realists
think Josie's guilty.

70
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:30,521
They're running scared.

71
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:34,184
Then straighten them out.

72
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:50,971
<i>You knew Harry was going to bust
into Channel 3, didn't you?</i>

73
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:52,813
No.

74
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:57,979
You knew he was going
to use that tape.

75
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:00,987
Why, Paige?

76
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:07,160
Am I a handsome man?

77
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:13,565
Am I a virile man?

78
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,596
- Answer me.
- Tony, please.

79
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,033
Am I...

80
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:24,008
...a decrepit cuckold?

81
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:25,611
Stop it.

82
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,840
You were supposed to come back
with the Go-chip.

83
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:30,882
Instead you brought
a plague to my house.

84
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:32,986
You're hurting me.

85
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:35,111
<i>Hello</i>

86
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,520
<i>I must be going</i>

87
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:42,922
<i>I cannot stay
I came to say I must be going</i>

88
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:46,498
I'll go back.
I'll get Harry to hand it over.

89
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:51,261
I assure you...

90
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,773
...I did not come all this way
to die like a trapped wolf!

91
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:58,538
Like a circus dog!

92
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:02,605
I am a soldier!

93
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:06,777
I am mustering my troops...

94
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:10,948
...and we are storming heaven!

95
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:14,488
- Why'd you kill her, Josie?
- How'd you make bail?

96
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:16,926
- I didn't kill anyone.
- There was a doctored tape.

97
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:19,362
A fabrication.
In a few days we'll prove it.

98
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:21,161
Is your brother gonna choose
a new running mate?

99
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:24,271
- Will he drop out of the campaign?
- Absolutely not. Why should he?

100
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,100
- What's your defense?
- Not guilty.

101
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:28,765
But the whole country saw
you murdered you daughter.

102
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:30,843
Seeing is believing.

103
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:32,479
You must be kidding.

104
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:35,673
- One more question, Josie.
- Will there be a statement from you?

105
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,649
When will the tape be ready?

106
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:40,083
- Tonight.
- And the Go-chip?

107
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:42,916
I'm assuming Harry Wyckoff has it
in his possession.

108
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:44,581
Get word out in the Wilderzone.

109
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,784
If he doesn't turn it over
within 48 hours...

110
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:48,659
...we'll kill the little girl.

111
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:17,456
Honey? I'm home!

112
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:42,675
Coty's room.

113
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:46,412
I always wanted to see
what his room looked like.

114
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:48,483
It would have been mine.

115
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:51,984
Help me out, Peter.

116
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:58,027
Why did the Fathers take you
from Grace and me?

117
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
- What do you know?
- They steal children...

118
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:04,203
...dreams, memories.

119
00:09:04,372 --> 00:09:07,034
A regular fire sale.

120
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:10,674
When they say, "Everything must go,"
they aren't kidding.

121
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:13,341
Why me?

122
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:15,345
Why my family?

123
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:17,711
You really don't know, do you?

124
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:21,718
Let's talk to the source.

125
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:24,181
Wild Palms?

126
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:26,622
Should we take the car or the pool?

127
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:37,330
Schenkl. How could I have been
so stupid?

128
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:40,235
How did they get Josie out?

129
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:46,242
When are we releasing the tape?

130
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:49,414
Tomorrow morning.
CNN, all the networks.

131
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:51,552
<i>Channel 3 will run it
round the clock.</i>

132
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:55,454
Do you think I should do
a feature during hiatus?

133
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:01,289
- Deirdre.
- No, wait. Wait.

134
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:04,763
Hi, sweetie.

135
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:07,831
Hey, Dad, can we see the tape?

136
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:11,399
Tabba, take Deirdre to the house.

137
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:15,440
Come on, little darling.
Tabba is gonna read you a story.

138
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:27,818
My God.

139
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,984
Please don't hit me, Harry!

140
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:36,794
You're just like your mother.

141
00:10:36,964 --> 00:10:38,693
Don't look.

142
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,528
Don't look.

143
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:42,601
Get up!

144
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:44,828
What are you gonna do with me?

145
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:46,268
The Fathers must be stopped.

146
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,964
- And you're one of them.
- No!

147
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:51,634
I'm just a woman.
But the Fathers are good, Harry.

148
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,542
They want to bring freedom
of images to the people.

149
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:57,650
As leader of the Friends,
I must set an example.

150
00:10:57,818 --> 00:11:01,276
- You must die.
- No, please, Harry. Don't hurt me.

151
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,547
Long live the Friends.

152
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:06,488
Death to New Realism.

153
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:09,819
Long live the revolution.

154
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:25,774
- The images are no-good.
- Get out of here.

155
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:28,939
The images don't hold.
You're diluting the images.

156
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:31,778
- Help you out today?
- No, thanks.

157
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:34,649
Got some kung fu,
some Johnny Carson.

158
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:36,790
<i>Some bloopers
from Church Windows.</i>

159
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,550
How about some holotropics?

160
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:41,160
Fugu just flown in.

161
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:44,492
- I got some Mimezine, Imagithol-
- Not today.

162
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:47,964
Say, you're the painter, right?

163
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:51,300
Sorry to hear about your friend.

164
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:53,201
Awful what happened.

165
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:56,104
We're seeing more
and more of that these days.

166
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:59,804
They call it image sickness.

167
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:03,382
I don't approve of drug dealers.

168
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,418
I don't even like the way you smell.

169
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:10,614
- Save your condolences.
- You know, I've been looking for you.

170
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:15,251
- Get the hell out of my face.
- You've got friends in high places.

171
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:21,000
They heard about your loss.

172
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:24,069
They made something for you.

173
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:27,367
To get you through the night.

174
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:29,633
It's your friend Tommy.

175
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:35,110
Come inside. I'll play it for you.

176
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:41,779
Come on, Twenty-Twenty,
you're gonna like what you see.

177
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,820
Continuing violence
in the wake of today's...

178
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:53,432
...allegations of doctored holotapes
and conspiracy.

179
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,468
<i>A Channel 3 engineer has been
arrested in the bizarre case...</i>

180
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:59,663
...and Harry Wyckoff, the disgruntled
head of business affairs...

181
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,105
...turned revolutionary, is now being
sought in the murder of his wife.

182
00:13:03,277 --> 00:13:05,541
Only one week ago,
the nation was shocked...

183
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:08,307
<i>...when Church Windows
was interrupted by a-</i>

184
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:13,081
- Get up!
- Please don't hit me, Harry.

185
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:15,946
You're just like your mother.

186
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:20,792
I'm worried about my brother.

187
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:23,226
- Emotionally?
- Physically.

188
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:25,961
I talked to the doctors.

189
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:29,830
What if his body
rejects the Go-chip, Tobias?

190
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:32,063
What if it kills him?

191
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,341
It's all been
the emperor's new mind?

192
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:38,643
Never gonna happen.

193
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:40,678
You know your brother, Josie.

194
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:43,180
He hasn't come this far
just to let a little thing...

195
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:45,410
...like the body get in his way.

196
00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:51,022
What will the senator be like
after the transference?

197
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,454
Ghostly.

198
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:54,753
He'll look like himself?

199
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:57,657
Like a hologram.

200
00:13:57,832 --> 00:14:01,165
He'll be able to reach
into our dreams.

201
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,396
By then, half the world
will be on Mimezine.

202
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:06,972
He'll be like Christ.

203
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:11,735
This better be good.

204
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:27,220
It's Mr. Wyckoff on the holophone.

205
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:44,235
Well, well.
If it isn't America's most wanted.

206
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:47,279
Well, I hope I didn't catch you
at a bad time.

207
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:49,144
I wanted to tell you...

208
00:14:49,316 --> 00:14:52,149
...you did a hell of a job
on that tape of Grace and me.

209
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:54,644
I knew you'd appreciate it.

210
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:56,983
The television programmer in me
was screaming:

211
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:58,386
"This could be a hit!"

212
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,254
Kill a mystery guest off every week.

213
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:01,690
Start historically.

214
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:04,831
One week, kill Caesar.
The next, Hoffa.

215
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:09,095
"Death to New Realism.
Long live the revolution. "

216
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:12,772
Who wrote that dialogue? Did you
think someone would believe it?

217
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,305
Does it matter?

218
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:17,376
We're already climbing again
in the polls.

219
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:19,012
Don't you get it?

220
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,909
No one gives a damn.

221
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:25,216
I want my daughter back, Josie.

222
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:29,381
Does the senator still
wanna make a deal?

223
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:31,218
- You have it?
- The Go-chip?

224
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:34,117
- Tell me where to bring it.
- Japantown.

225
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:36,490
Sunday, 4:00.

226
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:39,126
The Festival of the Ghosts.

227
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,863
Schenkl, you sick animal.

228
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:45,838
Don't project on me, Harry.

229
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:47,769
All those years...

230
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:51,309
You used everything I told you.
How many died?

231
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:53,443
If I ever get my hands on you,
Schenkl...

232
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:55,206
...I'm gonna just rip your neck out!

233
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:58,818
Oh, please, Harry,
stop the adolescent posturing.

234
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:03,047
Four o'clock, Sunday. Ciao.

235
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:15,829
What's this?

236
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,465
The Go-chip.

237
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,302
When they took it from your hand,
we embedded it in the coating.

238
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:26,546
The wedding band
that Josie gave me.

239
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:30,312
- I like the irony.
- Why now, Eli?

240
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:31,781
The word on the street is...

241
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:35,319
...that someone's gonna hit
the senator. Soon.

242
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,752
Tell them I don't want anything
to happen to him until I get Deirdre.

243
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:42,453
- I can't control that.
- Well, you've got to try.

244
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:46,131
What's the matter?

245
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,395
- What?
- It's the Mimezine.

246
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,905
Schenkl must have overdosed you
at the Perceptory.

247
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:58,943
Choko! Now, come on,
I still have some of the antigen.

248
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,744
Who is that sitting on my bed?

249
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:16,460
It feels like you.

250
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:19,795
Smells like you.

251
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:25,634
Is it a horror?

252
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:29,772
To be gotten through the night
by something made at Mimecom?

253
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:33,704
Is it a horror?

254
00:17:35,683 --> 00:17:36,911
Hey, Tully, come on.

255
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:39,075
Stop painting, will you?
We're gonna be late.

256
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:42,381
It's the Fourth of July. They're making
bonfires on the beach.

257
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,786
If there is a God, forgive me.

258
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,724
For I am lonely, and I am blind.

259
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,797
Hold me.

260
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,192
Tommy?

261
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:56,398
Tully, come on.
Stop painting, will you?

262
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,403
- We're gonna be late.
- Tommy, don't leave me.

263
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:01,839
They're making bonfires
on the beach.

264
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,453
Tommy.

265
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,892
Tommy.

266
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:30,165
I need more tapes.
I need more tapes.

267
00:18:30,337 --> 00:18:32,737
Hey, Twenty-Twenty, back so soon?

268
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:34,168
I need more tapes.

269
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:36,741
You gonna start paying
for these, Twenty-Twenty?

270
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,310
I'm strapped today, maybe next time.

271
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,641
I'm out of Tommy tapes.

272
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:43,908
Don't cut me off!

273
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:47,451
- You'll get your money today.
- I said, I'm out.

274
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:52,489
Look, a friend of yours
came by today.

275
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,424
I think she might be able
to help you.

276
00:18:55,596 --> 00:18:57,063
Who?

277
00:18:57,598 --> 00:19:00,829
A lady, said she'd be over
at the Mimoplex.

278
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:04,129
I think she got some tapes.

279
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,707
She'll fix you up, Twenty-Twenty.

280
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,841
Fix you up real good.

281
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:22,879
Sarah, it's Rauch.

282
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,388
You need help.

283
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:26,355
You can't hide
in the Wilderzone forever.

284
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:27,824
Leave me alone!

285
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:29,428
Let me in, Sarah.

286
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:30,961
They're looking for you.

287
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:33,224
- They' re gonna kill you.
- Liar.

288
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,129
- I don't believe you.
- Hello, Tully.

289
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:38,465
- Don't panic, I'm not going to hurt you.
- You...

290
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:42,006
You really see with those things.

291
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:44,144
Yes.

292
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:47,176
- And with the Mimezine.
- Phenomenal.

293
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:49,713
I'm so glad.

294
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:53,816
I brought some
Tommy tapes for you.

295
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:56,251
Very high quality.

296
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:59,586
I thought it would be better
I gave them to you myself.

297
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,662
That disgusting girl in the Wilderzone
keeps diluting the images.

298
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:07,096
That's why you can only
watch them once.

299
00:20:09,203 --> 00:20:11,694
Why are you doing this?

300
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:16,141
I'm making amends.

301
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:22,572
There is something
you could do for me.

302
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:25,716
I've been looking for Eli Levitt.

303
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:27,251
No.

304
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:30,788
I understand he's preparing
to assassinate my brother.

305
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,289
Don't make me.

306
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:35,758
I love my brother very much.

307
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:39,159
As much as you love Tommy.

308
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:43,029
He's in the Wilderzone.

309
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:44,795
That's where you'll find Eli Levitt.

310
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:46,530
I'm giving you one more chance.

311
00:20:50,177 --> 00:20:54,580
I'm gonna give you
all the tapes that you need.

312
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:02,422
Don't do it, Harry.

313
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:04,184
Give me a reason, Tobias.

314
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:06,952
There are still things you need
to know. Don't do it.

315
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:09,925
Everything I need to know
is in my right hand.

316
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:14,500
If you kill me,
you'll never see Deirdre again.

317
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:26,677
It's not safe for you
to be out and about.

318
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:30,180
Nothing's gonna happen to me
as long as I have the Go-chip.

319
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:33,709
Why don't you lay down
on the couch, Harry.

320
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:36,519
- Just like old times.
- Shut up.

321
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:40,219
Tell me what you know
about the Go-chip.

322
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:42,791
What will happen
when I give it to the senator?

323
00:21:42,963 --> 00:21:45,625
- He will become immortal.
- Impossible.

324
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,596
Do you know what paradise is,
Harry?

325
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:51,433
No longer encumbered by the body.

326
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:55,674
Whatever you imagine
is made real before you.

327
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:57,834
That's the Go-chip.

328
00:21:58,178 --> 00:22:00,408
What your father, Dex,
only dreamed about.

329
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:03,981
You're insane. All of you!

330
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:06,946
Too many of us now, Harry.

331
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,883
Synthiotics is worldwide.

332
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:10,819
When the election is over...

333
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:14,449
...we will enslave
those who aren't with us.

334
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:17,322
In a thousand Manzanars.

335
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,626
What's the matter, Harry?
Cat got your mind?

336
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:53,162
Are you okay?

337
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:56,232
What happened?

338
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:59,467
They found you in the 'Vette
on the street.

339
00:22:59,973 --> 00:23:01,998
What happened to you?

340
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:06,571
Oh, just a heavy session
with my shrink.

341
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:11,149
- Choko's been working on you.
- That's comforting.

342
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:14,777
She says you have the sickness,
but you're not gonna die.

343
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:16,817
Terrific.

344
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,958
Does the senator know you're here?

345
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:23,990
I couldn't stay with him anymore.

346
00:23:28,435 --> 00:23:32,531
You know, I can go for a major martini
right about now.

347
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:35,998
Do you have any green olives?

348
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,637
No alcohol.

349
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,047
Okay. Okay.

350
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,649
Yes.

351
00:23:49,423 --> 00:23:52,790
Oh, she's a scary thing, isn't she?

352
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:03,800
It's good to see you.

353
00:24:05,872 --> 00:24:07,863
Why the double ring?

354
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:10,666
It's a long story.

355
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:13,045
Let's get out of here.

356
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:15,240
Where?

357
00:24:17,017 --> 00:24:19,212
Need to see some blue sky.

358
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:24,651
I open my eyes in the morning...

359
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:29,257
...and I think,
"Is what I'm seeing real?"

360
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,160
That's my first thought of the day.

361
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:38,330
What's real, Paige?
Can you tell me?

362
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:40,805
Deirdre's real.

363
00:24:40,974 --> 00:24:42,703
Peter's real.

364
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:46,438
We are.

365
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:52,410
- Do you feel like traveling?
- Yes.

366
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:54,577
You know, we could fly away
somewhere.

367
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:58,088
Or live in a big old house
up in the mountains.

368
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:01,594
That's what Grace
always wanted to do.

369
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:05,356
I wanna find a Norman Rockwell-type
town, you know.

370
00:25:05,532 --> 00:25:11,630
With maple trees and park benches
and shiny red fire engines.

371
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:13,934
A decent place.

372
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:17,505
Where people respect reality.

373
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:29,714
Ask her if this can also be used
for image sickness.

374
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:48,772
Get in there!

375
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:50,671
Come on! Move it!

376
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:03,886
I've been searching for you.

377
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:06,389
Shotgun wedding, Josie?

378
00:26:07,427 --> 00:26:09,418
More a baptism.

379
00:26:10,964 --> 00:26:13,125
Know who told me
where to find you?

380
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,633
Your old artist-in-arms,
Tully Woiwode.

381
00:26:16,803 --> 00:26:19,738
- I don't believe that.
- Scout's honor.

382
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:22,466
Called me up, all by himself.

383
00:26:22,642 --> 00:26:25,406
Even told me about the Go-chip.

384
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:28,104
Hidden in the wedding ring
I gave you.

385
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:31,176
Is nothing sacred, Eli?

386
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:35,187
- You won't win, Josie.
- Hungry, Eli?

387
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:37,649
You'll love the food here.

388
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:41,191
Soup's a little watery.

389
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:42,589
You're sick.

390
00:26:42,996 --> 00:26:46,022
You didn't think I'd let you
kill my brother, did you?

391
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:49,331
Show Mr. Levitt to his table.

392
00:26:49,503 --> 00:26:51,437
Get up.

393
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,380
I'll see you in hell, Josie.

394
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:06,349
I was going to suggest some wine,
but I don't think it's a good idea.

395
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,045
One should never drink and drown.

396
00:27:09,222 --> 00:27:12,487
And you are
the designated drowner.

397
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:20,930
Goodbye, Eli.

398
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:24,128
It could have been so good with us.

399
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:30,869
So good.

400
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:34,878
They went up overnight.
Thousands of them.

401
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:36,606
Start the revolution without me.

402
00:27:36,783 --> 00:27:38,774
- What time is the rendezvous?
- Four o'clock.

403
00:27:38,952 --> 00:27:40,544
Harry, I wanna come.

404
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,813
- No.
- I'm still the senator's wife.

405
00:27:42,989 --> 00:27:45,321
They'll be less likely
to pull anything if I'm there.

406
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:53,954
Schenkl.

407
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:07,139
Where's my daughter?

408
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:20,143
Let's go!

409
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,385
Let's go! Let's go!

410
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:28,618
- Do we leave the girl?
- No! Change of plans.

411
00:29:28,795 --> 00:29:30,763
Move! Move!

412
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,464
Deirdre!

413
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,471
Deirdre!

414
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:46,705
Are you okay?

415
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,475
- Yeah.
- You're bleeding.

416
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:52,049
- The ring.
- What?

417
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:54,812
Eli's ring. And the Go-chip.

418
00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:57,115
They got the Go-chip.

419
00:29:57,557 --> 00:29:59,081
Damn it!

420
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:05,527
<i>The whole world is watching!
The whole world is dreaming!</i>

421
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:09,032
<i>The whole world is watching!
The whole world is dreaming!</i>

422
00:30:09,202 --> 00:30:12,228
<i>The whole world is watching!
The whole world is dreaming!</i>

423
00:30:12,405 --> 00:30:16,307
<i>The whole world is watching!
The whole world is dreaming!</i>

424
00:30:16,476 --> 00:30:20,003
<i>The whole world is watching!
The whole world is dreaming!</i>

425
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,081
<i>The whole world is watching!
The whole world...</i>

426
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:31,421
Harry, Eli's dead.

427
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,684
They've called a war meeting
at MacArthur Park.

428
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:39,354
<i>They're going to attack Channel 3
and the lab at Mimecom.</i>

429
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,329
Where's the senator?

430
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:46,632
There's a surgical suite at Wild Palms.
That's where they did the procedure.

431
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:53,409
I'm going to get Deirdre.

432
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,945
I'll come back for you and Peter.

433
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:57,981
I've come all this way for you.

434
00:30:58,151 --> 00:30:59,880
I'm not gonna be left behind.

435
00:31:00,053 --> 00:31:01,850
Not now.

436
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:05,690
- Where's Tully?
- No one knows.

437
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:08,191
We're afraid he's been picked up.

438
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:17,732
- Come on.
- Come on!

439
00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:37,145
Hello, Tully. Been a long time.

440
00:31:37,557 --> 00:31:39,548
Probably not feeling too good
about yourself.

441
00:31:39,893 --> 00:31:41,986
After what they did to Eli.

442
00:31:42,162 --> 00:31:44,528
I am asking you to kill me.

443
00:31:45,665 --> 00:31:48,600
I saved your father's life once...

444
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:50,235
...now you can cash me out.

445
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:54,370
This isn't Vegas, Tully.

446
00:32:01,214 --> 00:32:03,682
Eli Levitt was my friend.

447
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,848
I am lower
than the lowest of animals.

448
00:32:12,692 --> 00:32:15,320
You want redemption
for what you did, don't you?

449
00:32:17,096 --> 00:32:18,586
There is a way...

450
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:21,962
...to pay back the woman
who did this to you.

451
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:25,303
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Tully?

452
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:31,071
You know what to do.

453
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:33,974
Now get me to the chopper
and take me to Wild Palms.

454
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:36,672
My sister's waiting for me.

455
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:41,012
- signs the campaign of
Senator Kreutzer is crumbling...

456
00:32:41,187 --> 00:32:43,747
...as support grows for the fugitive
Harry Wyckoff.

457
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:47,723
Wyckoff released copies of his late
wife's diary to the media earlier today.

458
00:32:47,894 --> 00:32:51,057
Diaries which support growing
allegations of murder, torture...

459
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:54,325
...and New Realist mind control
in the corridors of Mimecom.

460
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:59,200
- Sporadic violence continues-
- Yes, we'll come. Right away.

461
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:02,196
What is it?

462
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,808
Your brother underwent
the procedure.

463
00:33:04,177 --> 00:33:05,644
He was supposed to wait for me.

464
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:07,905
- I wanted to be there.
- Something went wrong.

465
00:33:08,081 --> 00:33:10,811
It seems Harry got the chip
to the boy, Peter.

466
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:13,009
He tampered with it.

467
00:33:13,686 --> 00:33:15,085
Chickie taught him some tricks.

468
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:16,752
I have to go to him.

469
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:49,117
You blind fool.
What do you think you're doing?

470
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:02,630
Tully, please.

471
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,738
What a strange world.

472
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:10,705
So dramatic.

473
00:34:10,877 --> 00:34:14,711
So predatory.

474
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:16,548
Don't kill me.

475
00:34:16,716 --> 00:34:18,047
Not now.

476
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:21,277
Just when everything
was going so well.

477
00:34:21,454 --> 00:34:23,479
Tully...

478
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:27,489
...we're like two old generals.

479
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:30,991
Yin and yang.

480
00:34:31,831 --> 00:34:34,459
Jewel and the lotus.

481
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:36,602
I respect you.

482
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:38,794
Please, Tully.

483
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:41,566
Tell me what you want.

484
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:48,745
Once, I was a painter.

485
00:34:49,282 --> 00:34:53,878
Mixing colors together was an ecstasy.
I lived for light.

486
00:34:54,053 --> 00:34:55,850
Then one day...

487
00:34:56,022 --> 00:35:00,652
...a woman tore the eyes
from my skull.

488
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:04,126
I can give you things.

489
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:08,358
With new technology,
things you can't imagine.

490
00:35:08,534 --> 00:35:10,798
Beyond seeing.

491
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,498
Once, I was a painter.

492
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,737
Then one day,
my beloved Maisie was dead.

493
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:23,847
Isn't it strange?

494
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:29,219
Everything you could dream of...

495
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:32,614
...right in your grasp.

496
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:37,963
- It's over.
- No.

497
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:40,424
Who would have thought?

498
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:51,868
Do it.

499
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:40,183
I don't like this, Harry.

500
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:42,122
It's too quiet. I don't trust him.

501
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:46,026
It's all right.
Kreutzer has gotta be weak.

502
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,724
That's if he's alive at all.

503
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:55,339
Harry?

504
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:57,006
Is that you?

505
00:36:58,644 --> 00:37:00,009
Yes, senator, it's me.

506
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,475
I knew you were coming.

507
00:37:02,648 --> 00:37:05,913
That's why I sent them all away.

508
00:37:06,886 --> 00:37:09,252
This is Mount Olympus now.

509
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:11,390
Mortals will not be tolerated.

510
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:15,821
- I've made an exception for you.
- There's something wrong with him.

511
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,424
Some hours ago...

512
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,228
...I received the Go-chip implant.

513
00:37:30,276 --> 00:37:34,303
- How do you feel?
- They said it couldn't be done.

514
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:39,175
"Do not pass go," they said.
"Do not collect $200."

515
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:45,950
I wanna talk to you.

516
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,320
We never talked enough.

517
00:37:49,295 --> 00:37:51,422
That was my fault.

518
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:55,158
Now we have all the time
in the world.

519
00:37:56,903 --> 00:37:58,336
How well did you know my mother?

520
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:07,403
We enjoyed each other's company.

521
00:38:07,847 --> 00:38:09,781
Bernice and I.

522
00:38:09,949 --> 00:38:12,747
Dex wasn't too thrilled.

523
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:16,015
We had a child together,
did you know?

524
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,052
Dex thought it was his.

525
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:23,519
Named the boy "Harry. "

526
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:29,562
He found out. Dex did.

527
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,070
He tried to kill me.

528
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,131
I had to defend myself.

529
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:43,672
Why didn't you tell me
instead of this insane charade? Why?

530
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:48,148
The garden is filled with lies, Harry.

531
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:50,445
Little lies.

532
00:38:50,623 --> 00:38:55,959
Thousands over a lifetime,
like lilies of the field.

533
00:38:56,896 --> 00:39:01,299
My lies are Mimecom's.

534
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:04,334
State-of-the-art, for the masses.

535
00:39:05,938 --> 00:39:08,168
You took Peter...

536
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:11,441
...my son, away from me.

537
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:15,840
You took everything from me
that I loved.

538
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:17,848
Tell me why.

539
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:23,584
Do you know what the unicorn does
when it's surrounded by hunters?

540
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:25,849
Tell me why,
you psychotic son of a bitch.

541
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:30,189
It somersaults into the nearest abyss,
breaking the fall with its horn.

542
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:32,123
You destroyed Coty.

543
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:33,993
Your brother, Coty.

544
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:36,930
It's rather like an Arabian tale,
isn't it, Harry?

545
00:39:37,103 --> 00:39:39,571
You made a monster out of that boy!

546
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,003
What's happening?

547
00:39:48,948 --> 00:39:50,210
Oh, my God.

548
00:39:53,886 --> 00:39:56,218
We altered the chip.

549
00:39:56,789 --> 00:39:58,814
Peter and I.

550
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:00,390
My son.

551
00:40:01,394 --> 00:40:03,692
If there was time...

552
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:08,129
...I would tell you all
about your mother and me.

553
00:40:08,301 --> 00:40:12,635
I would tell you things
only the wild palms know.

554
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,632
Can't feel my legs.

555
00:40:15,808 --> 00:40:18,436
Ain't that the craziest thing?

556
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:21,307
<i>Hello
I must be going</i>

557
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,109
<i>I cannot stay
I came to say, I must be going</i>

558
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:27,912
Don't you leave. Not yet!

559
00:40:30,323 --> 00:40:33,315
<i>I'm glad I came, but just the same</i>

560
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:36,655
<i>- I must be going
- You ruined everything.</i>

561
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:39,662
You ruined everything
that you touched.

562
00:40:39,832 --> 00:40:42,266
What's the matter?
Wasn't this world enough for you?

563
00:40:42,768 --> 00:40:45,202
<i>I'll stay a week or two</i>

564
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:47,464
You didn't have to run to paradise...

565
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:50,032
...Father!

566
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,635
Paradise is here!

567
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:56,779
Here, damn it! Here!

568
00:40:56,949 --> 00:40:59,042
Paradise is right here!

569
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:01,118
<i>I'll stay the summer through</i>

570
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:03,482
<i>But I am telling you</i>

571
00:41:03,656 --> 00:41:07,752
<i>I must be going</i>

572
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:09,723
Coward.

573
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:11,896
I could have loved you.

574
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:16,166
This is the way the world ends.

575
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:19,236
Not with a bang...

576
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:23,105
...but a whimper.

577
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,743
Harry, look!

578
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:48,389
Did you speak to Father?

579
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:50,802
- In the living room.
- Living room?

580
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,734
Funny, his body's
in the guesthouse.

581
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,404
You know,
I talked to him a while too.

582
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:59,772
Then he floated over the roof
like a Chagall.

583
00:41:59,945 --> 00:42:01,310
It's over now.

584
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,846
Easy for you to say.

585
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,450
- Hello, Mother.
- Coty, let us go.

586
00:42:07,153 --> 00:42:09,713
You're very James Bond today,
Mother.

587
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:11,982
She was always
in awe of Pussy Galore.

588
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:14,851
Hey, stay away!

589
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:18,554
All this time...

590
00:42:18,731 --> 00:42:21,928
- ... I find out we're brothers.
- Harry Wyckoff, this is your life.

591
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:25,332
Look, our father is dead.

592
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:26,971
I'm taking Deirdre.

593
00:42:27,173 --> 00:42:30,609
Why don't you come with us
and leave all this behind.

594
00:42:30,976 --> 00:42:32,238
That's what Daddy wanted.

595
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:34,538
To leave everything behind.

596
00:42:34,747 --> 00:42:36,806
And look what happened.

597
00:42:37,817 --> 00:42:40,684
- It's Little Boy Blue.
- Peter, stay back!

598
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:43,083
I wanted to be here
with you and Deirdre.

599
00:42:43,255 --> 00:42:44,813
That's where I belong.

600
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,083
How poignant.

601
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,257
What are you gonna do, Coty?
Kill us all?

602
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:52,488
Deirdre's watching.
What do you think she sees?

603
00:42:52,832 --> 00:42:54,459
You think she wants to
stay with you?

604
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:55,998
Hey, she loves me.

605
00:42:56,168 --> 00:42:59,433
The great child guru of Synthiotics,
a monster.

606
00:42:59,605 --> 00:43:00,970
How can she love a monster?

607
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,165
Hey, don't you talk to me that way.

608
00:43:03,676 --> 00:43:05,769
Deirdre, come to Daddy.

609
00:43:06,445 --> 00:43:07,707
Leave her alone.

610
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,077
If you love Deirdre so much...

611
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:12,149
...let her make up her own mind.

612
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:13,751
She wants to stay with me!

613
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:16,149
She loves me. I know she does.

614
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:18,847
- Dierdre, come to me.
- I'll shoot.

615
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:22,551
In front of your baby sister? You're
gonna make a hell of a role model.

616
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:24,559
I'm sorry, baby.

617
00:43:25,631 --> 00:43:27,690
For letting them destroy you,
I'm so sorry.

618
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,499
I'll kill you dead, Mama.

619
00:43:30,136 --> 00:43:32,161
You wouldn't hurt me.

620
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:34,829
Give me the gun.

621
00:43:38,177 --> 00:43:39,735
Mother...

622
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,272
- ... who am I?
- Give me.

623
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:50,646
Watch it!

624
00:43:57,863 --> 00:43:59,558
Daddy!

625
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:01,427
Come here, baby.

626
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,295
Come here.

627
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:08,167
- Oh, are you all right?
- Yeah.

628
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,773
It's over.

629
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:11,569
Let's go.

630
00:44:27,526 --> 00:44:31,257
<i>Poor men have grown to be rich men
And rich men grown to be poor again</i>

631
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,558
<i>For I am running to Paradise</i>

632
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:38,567
<i>The wind is old and still at play
While I must hurry upon my way</i>

633
00:44:38,737 --> 00:44:41,831
<i>And I am running to Paradise</i>

634
00:44:52,918 --> 00:44:56,615
<i>My Captain!
Our fearful trip is done</i>

635
00:44:56,789 --> 00:45:01,783
<i>The ship has weather'd every rack
The prize we sought is won</i>

636
00:45:01,961 --> 00:45:06,864
<i>O Captain! My Captain!
Our fearful trip is done</i>

637
00:45:07,032 --> 00:45:11,901
<i>The ship has weather'd every rack
The prize we sought is won</i>

638
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:15,199
<i>O Captain! My Captain!
Our fearful...</i>

639
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:17,274
Where will we go?

640
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:22,471
I'm gonna take you to the tunnels
at the beach, where Chickie lived.

641
00:45:22,648 --> 00:45:24,013
You'll be safe there.

642
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:26,174
I want you to be with the children.

643
00:45:26,352 --> 00:45:27,979
What will you do?

644
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:29,586
I'll have to go back.

645
00:45:29,755 --> 00:45:31,484
They need me.

646
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:35,453
Remember when you told me, Paige,
about a thousand years ago...

647
00:45:35,628 --> 00:45:36,856
...that you wanted
a world...

648
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:39,520
...where you can keep
your dreams open at night?

649
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,171
<i>O Captain! My Captain!</i>

650
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:59,715
<i>Rise up and hear the bells</i>

651
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:02,820
The Fathers have fallen!
The Fathers have fallen!

652
00:46:02,988 --> 00:46:05,980
The Fathers have fallen!

653
00:46:07,993 --> 00:46:09,927
She talked back there.

654
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:12,063
Did you hear her?

655
00:46:14,366 --> 00:46:16,266
You're safe now.

656
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:18,262
Daddy?

657
00:46:19,238 --> 00:46:21,672
Yeah, baby? What is it?

658
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:25,440
There's so much I want to tell you.

659
00:46:29,148 --> 00:46:31,616
There'll be lots of time, honey.

660
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:34,185
Lots of time.
