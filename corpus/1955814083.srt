1
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:22,189
<i>A survey was taken
a few years ago</i>

2
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:24,971
<i>that asked 300 professionals
one question:</i>

3
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:27,495
<i>"What's the worst thing
that can happen in sports?"</i>

4
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:33,377
<i>Some people answered
losing a Game 7.</i>

5
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:35,959
<i>He scores! Bruins
win in seven games!</i>

6
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:40,353
<i>And other people said
getting swept in four.</i>

7
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:45,346
<i>Some people said it was
missing the World Cup.</i>

8
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:47,929
<i>Guatemala is eliminated!</i>

9
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:52,035
<i>And some Brazilians said
it was losing to Argentina.</i>

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,261
<i>Not just in the World Cup--
anytime, ever, in any contest.</i>

11
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:58,566
<i>But one person answered
that the worst thing</i>

12
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,621
<i>that can happen in sports</i>

13
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:01,957
<i>was fourth place
at the Olympics.</i>

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,861
<i>This is a true story,
but except for my own,</i>

15
00:01:04,886 --> 00:01:06,243
<i>I've changed all the names</i>

16
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:07,876
<i>and I've done my best
to obscure identities</i>

17
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:09,533
<i>for reasons that'll
become clear.</i>

18
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:11,827
<i>I'm Molly Bloom</i>

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,218
<i>and right now, I'm ranked third in
North America in Women's Moguls.</i>

20
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,646
<i>I grew up in Loveland, Colorado
about two hours north of Denver.</i>

21
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:22,066
<i>I have a BA in Political Science
from the University of Colorado</i>

22
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:25,661
<i>where I graduated Summa
Cum Laude with a 3.9 GPA.</i>

23
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:29,395
<i>The median L-SAT score at
Harvard Law School is 169.</i>

24
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:31,489
<i>My score: 173.</i>

25
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,692
Number 87 up.
56 on deck.

26
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:35,911
<i>I've spent 16 years
chasing winter</i>

27
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,841
<i>and being coached
by the best in the world.</i>

28
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,537
<i>Sundays were for
working out with my father.</i>

29
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,209
Something's really wrong.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,185
<i>When I was 12 years old,
for no particular reason,</i>

31
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,630
<i>my back exploded.</i>

32
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:46,888
Tough it out.

33
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:48,681
Good advice.

34
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:49,673
And lose the attitude.

35
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:52,486
<i>Less than ten minutes later,
I was in the back of an ambulance.</i>

36
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:55,627
<i>I had what's called
rapid onset scoliosis.</i>

37
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,689
<i>My spine was curved
at 63 degrees</i>

38
00:01:57,714 --> 00:02:00,091
<i>and I'd need a 7-hour surgical
procedure that involved</i>

39
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:02,896
<i>straightening my spine,
extracting bone from my hip,</i>

40
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,467
<i>fusing 11 vertebrae together</i>

41
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,670
<i>and fastening steel rods
to the fused segments.</i>

42
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,644
She's gonna be fine.

43
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:11,425
I wouldn't let her ski anymore.
Definitely not moguls.

44
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:14,883
And obviously, skiing competitively
is out of the question.

45
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:17,064
Oh, I know.

46
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:20,635
<i>I was on skis again in a year,</i>

47
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:22,144
<i>running moguls in 18 months</i>

48
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:25,012
<i>and by my 20th birthday,
I'd made the U.S. Ski Team.</i>

49
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:27,857
<i>It's the last round of qualifying
for the Salt Lake City Olympics.</i>

50
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:29,857
<i>This is the Champion Run
at Deer Valley.</i>

51
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:33,013
<i>The altitude's 8,100 feet
and the pitch is 52 degrees</i>

52
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:35,182
<i>which is the same as the
sides of the Great Pyramids.</i>

53
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,455
<i>The wind's 20-25 miles an hour
blowing left to right.</i>

54
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:40,965
<i>It's three-below zero
at the top of the slope</i>

55
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,169
<i>and with 17 skiers
in front of me,</i>

56
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:46,420
<i>it's gonna be like trying to stick a
landing on a frozen infinity pool.</i>

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,922
Kiki blew out of her line.

58
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:50,031
Shannon was off-balance
on her second landing.

59
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:52,390
<i>He's talking about Kiki Bandy
and Shannon Keebler,</i>

60
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:53,911
<i>my two toughest competitors</i>

61
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:56,614
<i>who had significant point
deductions on their final runs.</i>

62
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:59,272
<i>I can make the Olympic
team right now.</i>

63
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:00,311
Go get it.

64
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,053
<i>And if I had three perfect
runs in Salt Lake...</i>

65
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,053
<i>the best runs of my life...</i>

66
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:06,451
<i>I can beat the Austrians
and the Swiss</i>

67
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:08,537
<i>and have a realistic
shot at the podium.</i>

68
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:10,717
<i>Then law school
and then a start-up.</i>

69
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,845
<i>A foundation that seeds
entrepreneurial women.</i>

70
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,745
<i>My father's at the
bottom of the slope</i>

71
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,534
<i>telepathically telling me
to check my line.</i>

72
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:18,840
Check your line.

73
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,199
<i>I check my line.</i>

74
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:21,832
Competitor ready.

75
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:29,208
<i>Good snow contact,
calm upper-body,</i>

76
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:31,873
<i>legs together, good shape,
no line deviation,</i>

77
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:34,107
<i>set up for the D-Spin, and...</i>

78
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:37,198
<i>stick the landing.</i>

79
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:38,628
<i>Now two things
you need to know</i>

80
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,824
<i>before the second trick
which'll be a 720.</i>

81
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:44,143
<i>The first is that when visibility
is bad the way it is now,</i>

82
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:46,393
<i>race officials toss pine
boughs on the course</i>

83
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:48,620
<i>so the skiers have some
foreground depth reference.</i>

84
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,941
<i>The second is that the
tightness of your bindings</i>

85
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:53,340
<i>is determined by what's called
a DIN setting.</i>

86
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,926
<i>If you're a beginner, your DIN
setting is probably a two or three.</i>

87
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:58,645
<i>If you're an experienced weekend
skier, it's probably seven or eight.</i>

88
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,050
<i>Mine's 15.</i>

89
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:02,416
<i>My boots are basically
welded to my skis.</i>

90
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:04,596
<i>Right...so how does this happen?</i>

91
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,307
<i>It happened because
I hit a pine bough</i>

92
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,955
<i>that had become
frozen in the snow.</i>

93
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:12,149
<i>And I hit it so precisely</i>

94
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:14,595
<i>that it simply snapped the
release of my bindings.</i>

95
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:16,024
<i>Right in that moment,
I didn't have time</i>

96
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,822
<i>to calculate the odds
of that happening</i>

97
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:19,370
<i>because I was about
to land pretty hard</i>

98
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:21,385
<i>on my digitally
remastered spinal cord</i>

99
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:24,596
<i>which is being held together by
spare parts from an Erector Set.</i>

100
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:30,053
Back up! Back up! Move!

101
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:31,342
-Watch out!
-Give her room!

102
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,529
That way, move!

103
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:40,945
<i>None of this has anything
to do with poker.</i>

104
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:42,905
<i>I'm only mentioning it because
I wanted to say to whoever</i>

105
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,797
<i>answered that the worst thing
that could happen in sports</i>

106
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:46,774
<i>was fourth place
at the Olympics...</i>

107
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:48,930
<i>seriously, fuck you.</i>

108
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,807
-Hello?
<i>-Molly Bloom?</i>

109
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,627
<i>-Is this Molly Bloom?</i>
-Yes.

110
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,323
<i>This is Special Agent
Tomasino at the FBI.</i>

111
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,151
<i>We have a warrant
for your arrest.</i>

112
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:52,878
-Sorry?
<i>-We're outside your door,</i>

113
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:54,941
<i>we want you to come
out here, okay?</i>

114
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:56,854
<i>Listen to me now.</i>

115
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,995
<i>-Make sure we can see your hands.</i>
-Who is this?

116
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,267
<i>This is Special Agent Tomasino
of the FBI, Miss Bloom.</i>

117
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,557
<i>You've got 30 seconds
to open your door</i>

118
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:05,128
<i>or we're breaking it down.</i>

119
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:07,280
<i>Do you understand
what I just said?</i>

120
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:15,526
Hands in the air.

121
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:18,050
Put your hands in the air.

122
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,685
-There's been a mistake.
-Are you Molly Bloom?

123
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:21,451
Yes, but there's--

124
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:24,037
I want you to walk
toward me very slowly.

125
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:25,507
Okay. Go ahead.

126
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:26,679
-I'm...
-Slower.

127
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,179
Slower. Slow down.

128
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,943
Come on. Come on.

129
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,389
-I'm having a hard time seeing--
-Walk slower.

130
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:34,795
-the flashlights in my eyes--
-Walk slower.

131
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:35,837
Yes, sir.

132
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:38,048
Hands on the wall.

133
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,556
Spread your arms and legs.

134
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,509
Is there anyone in your
apartment right now?

135
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,564
Uh, no, sir.

136
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,009
Are there any firearms
in your apartment right now?

137
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,972
No, sir.

138
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:46,988
Go.

139
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:49,536
You're under arrest for running
an illegal gambling operation.

140
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:50,746
Do you understand?

141
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:51,911
Uh...yes.

142
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:53,301
Say you understand.

143
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,618
I understand.

144
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:57,509
There's been--a mistake because
I haven't run a game in two years.

145
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,212
I want you to take a look at
this piece of paper right here.

146
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:01,801
Can you see what it
says at the top?

147
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:04,879
Yes.

148
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:06,606
Read to me what
it says at the top.

149
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:10,731
United States of America
vs. Molly Bloom.

150
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,954
I'd bet heavy on the favorite.

151
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:21,041
<i>What do you um, think about
the following concepts?</i>

152
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,791
<i>Just gonna run 'em by you.</i>

153
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:23,895
<i>Marriage.</i>

154
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:25,582
<i>It is a trap.</i>

155
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:28,043
<i>Society.</i>

156
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:29,785
<i>It is a joke.</i>

157
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:31,991
<i>People.</i>

158
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,444
<i>I...think there's good and bad.</i>

159
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:39,749
<i>But I don't trust them.</i>

160
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,343
<i>I don't trust people.</i>

161
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:44,785
<i>Every year on our birthdays,</i>

162
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:47,340
<i>my father would interview
my younger brothers and me.</i>

163
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,555
<i>Who are the heroes or
heroines in your life?</i>

164
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:52,407
<i>Who uh,
who do you really respect?</i>

165
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,771
<i>I don't have any heroes.</i>

166
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:56,615
<i>You don't have any heroes.</i>

167
00:07:56,912 --> 00:07:58,271
<i>How's this for hubris?</i>

168
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,755
<i>I don't.</i>

169
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,911
<i>Because if I reach the goals
I'd set out for myself,</i>

170
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,732
<i>then the person I become,</i>

171
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:07,518
<i>that'll be my hero.</i>

172
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,650
<i>Even by teenage girl standards,</i>

173
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,275
<i>I would appear to be irrationally
angry at nothing in particular.</i>

174
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:16,369
<i>It would be another 22 years
before I'd find out why.</i>

175
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:19,277
<i>After my colossal
wipeout at Deer Valley,</i>

176
00:08:19,302 --> 00:08:22,035
<i>I decided to take a year
off before law school.</i>

177
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:23,518
<i>I needed to go away,</i>

178
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:26,331
<i>sever myself from reality and
come up with a new plan.</i>

179
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,643
<i>So, I chose Los Angeles.</i>

180
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,594
<i>A friend of mine
from the ski team</i>

181
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:33,176
<i>had agreed to let me crash
on her couch for a while.</i>

182
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:35,494
<i>My father had disapproved
of postponing law school</i>

183
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,531
<i>and so declined to help out.</i>

184
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:41,127
<i>But I had $1700 I'd saved from
babysitting money and</i>

185
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:43,932
<i>that would support me until
I found a waitressing job.</i>

186
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:47,554
<i>I'd already had a career
and retired from it.</i>

187
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:50,171
<i>I wanted to be young
for a while in warm weather.</i>

188
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,897
<i>I think that's what
I wanted at first.</i>

189
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,085
<i>It's hard to remember.</i>

190
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:57,546
<i>I got a job working
bottle service</i>

191
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,304
<i>at a club in Hollywood called
Nacional Nightclub.</i>

192
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:02,483
<i>It was Cuban-themed.</i>

193
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:05,944
<i>So my uniform was camouflage
short-shorts and a wife-beater.</i>

194
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,370
<i>The promoter would go over</i>

195
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:10,246
<i>which record producer
was sitting where...</i>

196
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:11,856
<i>which hot designers,
which Lakers,</i>

197
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:14,052
<i>and Boris Lava, the
Bulgarian billionaire,</i>

198
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:16,630
<i>who didn't drink but
who ran $100,000 bar tab.</i>

199
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,945
<i>My job was to get people to spend
more money than they needed to.</i>

200
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:21,836
Could we get a bottle of Sky?

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,469
You guys look like
you deserve Grey Goose.

202
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:25,952
What do guys who deserve
Grey Goose look like?

203
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:28,108
To begin with, they got a bottle
of Grey Goose in front of 'em.

204
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:30,344
You're quick. Very clever.

205
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:32,701
Uh, all right, yeah. Grey Goose.

206
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:34,912
<i>They just spent an
additional $300,</i>

207
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:36,810
<i>bringing their total to $900</i>

208
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:38,951
<i>for $8.50 worth or vodka.</i>

209
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,328
<i>But the club doesn't need
you to buy a bottle.</i>

210
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:42,946
<i>They need you to
buy five bottles.</i>

211
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,172
<i>So these girls over here,</i>

212
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:45,875
<i>they let you buy them
shots for a living.</i>

213
00:09:46,282 --> 00:09:48,672
<i>It would be like waiting in a
long line to get into the Gap</i>

214
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:50,688
<i>so you can pay a 1,000
percent mark-up</i>

215
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:52,969
<i>to buy all the employees
a pair of pants.</i>

216
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:56,592
<i>I only had one shift a week.</i>

217
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,881
<i>I didn't want to tell my parents
I was a cocktail waitress.</i>

218
00:09:58,906 --> 00:10:00,468
<i>And back then, I
never turned down</i>

219
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:01,975
<i>an opportunity to
make more money.</i>

220
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,320
<i>So I found a second job
as an office assistant</i>

221
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:07,031
<i>and that's how I ended up
working for Dean Keith.</i>

222
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:10,847
<i>Dean was a partner in
Blackhues Investments.</i>

223
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:13,508
<i>He was a regular at the club
and one night, he said,</i>

224
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:15,524
People seem to take to you.

225
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:18,255
Hey, how'd you like to get
paid to go to grad school

226
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:20,435
and get an MBA in
how life works?

227
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:22,446
What makes you think
you know and I don't?

228
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:25,268
I'm a regular here
and you're a waitress here.

229
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:27,010
Look at the fuckin' scoreboard.

230
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:29,323
<i>Dean explained what
my job was by saying,</i>

231
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,620
Me. I'm your job.

232
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:35,149
<i>I answered the phone, made
coffee runs, set appointments,</i>

233
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,875
<i>-made spreadsheets.</i>
-What is that?

234
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,327
<i>and showed Dean what
a spreadsheet was.</i>

235
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:39,499
Spreadsheet.

236
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:42,079
<i>But I made $450
a week on top of</i>

237
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:44,158
<i>the $300 I was
making at the club,</i>

238
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:46,220
<i>which would be enough to
get off my friend's couch.</i>

239
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,636
<i>I remember the day started
by being about bagels.</i>

240
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,106
-This is Molly.
<i>-Get to the office. Pick up bagels.</i>

241
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,707
Do you mean now?

242
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,496
<i>Dean was a Hollywood staple.</i>

243
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:02,217
<i>Over-leveraged, going broke,
trying to prove he wasn't broke</i>

244
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:05,178
<i>and making a true effort
to be as vulgar as possible.</i>

245
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,281
<i>Honestly making an effort.</i>

246
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,445
<i>I hadn't told anyone
I was a skier</i>

247
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,227
<i>and it was hard not to
laugh when Dean said...</i>

248
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,583
Anyone ever teach you
how to fuckin' hurry?

249
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:13,856
No.

250
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,977
-What are those?
-Bagels.

251
00:11:16,797 --> 00:11:18,102
-Are these from Bluebell?
-Yeah.

252
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:19,821
-It's on the way from my house.
-Seriously?

253
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:22,702
You might as well have stopped
at a fuckin' homeless shelter.

254
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:24,959
You might as well
have walked into

255
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:26,967
a motherfucking homeless
shelter and said,

256
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:30,405
"I'd like a dozen bagels from
this homeless shelter, please!"

257
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:34,991
I do not eat bagels from
Blue fucking bell, Molly,

258
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:37,976
because these are
poor people bagels!

259
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,420
From where would you like me to
get your bagels in the future?

260
00:11:40,445 --> 00:11:41,507
Forget about the fuckin' bagels.

261
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:43,013
-Done.
-Except smarten up.

262
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:44,241
-Got it.
-Hang on.

263
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:47,618
<i>Like I said, the day started
by being about bagels.</i>

264
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:49,032
<i>But that would abruptly change.</i>

265
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:51,196
My weekly poker game's
moved to the Cobra Lounge.

266
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,797
Tomorrow night and then
every Tuesday night.

267
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:54,095
You'll help run it.

268
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:55,845
Take these names
and numbers.

269
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:58,517
Tell 'em to bring 10 grand in
cash for the first buy-in,

270
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,165
the blinds are 50-100.

271
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:02,612
-And Molly.
-Yeah?

272
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:04,401
Don't fuckin' tell anybody.

273
00:12:11,827 --> 00:12:15,046
<i>I'd regarded Dean as a nitwit
when I regarded him at all.</i>

274
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:17,773
<i>But on that pad were nine names
along with phone numbers</i>

275
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:20,947
<i>of some of the most wealthiest and
most famous people in the world.</i>

276
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:24,045
<i>I put the numbers in my phone
and composed a simple message.</i>

277
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:26,615
<i>There'd be a game tomorrow
night at the Cobra Lounge,</i>

278
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:28,495
<i>there was a $10,000 buy-in.</i>

279
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,579
<i>All nine players confirmed
that they'd be there.</i>

280
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:38,967
<i>All withing 90 seconds
of my sending the text.</i>

281
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:42,974
<i>The Cobra Lounge sits on the
edge of the Sunset Strip.</i>

282
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:46,071
<i>And in its heyday was famous
for introducing unknown bands</i>

283
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:48,533
<i>like The Doors
and The Beach Boys.</i>

284
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:51,391
<i>All I knew was
schoolwork and skiing.</i>

285
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,276
<i>I'd always figured
sophistication</i>

286
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:55,339
<i>would be easy to learn
if I ever needed it.</i>

287
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:57,401
<i>My cheese platter had
a sticker that read,</i>

288
00:12:57,494 --> 00:12:59,862
<i>"Cheese: From the Great
State of Michigan."</i>

289
00:13:00,924 --> 00:13:03,151
<i>Diego, a professional dealer,</i>

290
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:05,276
<i>was setting up the table
when I got there.</i>

291
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:07,057
<i>I Googled,</i>

292
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:10,034
<i>"What type of music do poker
players like to listen to?"</i>

293
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,994
<i>And then tried to figure
out how to make a playlist</i>

294
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,745
<i>out one Kenny Rogers song.</i>

295
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,535
<i>I set up the bar,</i>

296
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:18,453
<i>put out my cheese platter</i>

297
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:19,640
<i>and positioned
myself at the door</i>

298
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:22,430
<i>where I'd been instructed to only
let in the names on the list.</i>

299
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:24,227
<i>I was wearing my best dress,</i>

300
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:27,548
<i>which I'd bought two years
earlier at JC Penney for $88.</i>

301
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:29,837
<i>The players started to arrive.</i>

302
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:31,792
<i>I introduced myself as Molly,</i>

303
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:33,495
<i>-Dean's assistant.</i>
-For you.

304
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:36,878
<i>Asked if I could
get them a drink,</i>

305
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:43,723
<i>and took from each
of them $10,000 in cash.</i>

306
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:47,738
-Hi.
-Hi.

307
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:49,621
I'm...

308
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:53,365
I know.

309
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,982
-Everybody here?
-Yeah.

310
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:57,052
Hey, buddy.

311
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:58,810
Fuck off.
I'm gonna own your shit.

312
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:02,134
Ugly dress. Ugly shoes.

313
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:03,806
Let's play!

314
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,327
<i>Diego fanned nine cards
out on the table</i>

315
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,328
<i>and the players chose for seats.</i>

316
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,555
-11 and 11.
-22.

317
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,544
<i>I'd just finished counting
out $90,000 in cash.</i>

318
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:30,761
<i>I was in a room

<i>rappers,</i>

<i>-boxers,

00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,195
<i>and business titans.</i>

324
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:41,654
<i>They were going
all-in all the time,</i>

325
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,053
<i>burning through their
buy-ins over and over.</i>

326
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:46,380
-There you go, good luck.
-Thank you so much.

327

-Yeah.
-Where? Where's the paper?

333
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:07,551
Spreadsheet.

334
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:10,811

00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:19,482
All in.

337
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,754
<i>The game ended at 3:30.</i>

338
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:25,919
<i>And when it did,
that's when Dean shouted out--</i>

339
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:29,270
Hey! Tip Molly if you want to
get invited back next week.

340
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:31,863
<i>"Tip Molly."</i>

341
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:34,262
<i>Deep down I didn't like
the sound of that.</i>

342
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,129
Thank you so much.

343
00:15:36,154 --> 00:15:37,691
<i>Deep down I knew that
when your boss says,</i>

344
00:15:37,716 --> 00:15:39,301
-And Molly.
-Yeah.

345
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:40,668
Don't fuckin' tell anybody.

346
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:42,793
<i>that's usually not the beginning
of a promising law career.</i>

347
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:43,998
See you next week.

348
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,302
<i>But that was deep down.</i>

349
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:51,255
<i>I'd just made $3,000.</i>

350
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:17,790
What are you reading?

351
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:19,650
<i>The Crucible.</i>

352
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:21,095
For school?

353
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:23,056
My father assigned it.

354
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:28,575
Do you know how many witches
were burned in Salem?

355
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:30,496
-How many?
-None.

356
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:33,215
They didn't burn witches,
it's a myth. They hanged them.

357
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,572
Or drowned them or crushed
them with heavy rocks.

358
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:40,787
Wait, aren't--
You're Molly Bloom, right?

359
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,193
Yeah.

360
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,255
You don't look the same
as in your photos.

361
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:45,872
None of us do.

362
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:48,841
-Molly?
-Yes.

363
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,590
Charlie Jaffey.

364
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,583
Thank you again for
seeing me so early.

365
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:54,551
-This is my daughter, Stella.
-We met.

366
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:57,598
Isabel will be here in 45 minutes
to take you to school.

367
00:16:57,653 --> 00:16:59,044
-Finish your math?
-Yeah.

368
00:16:59,184 --> 00:16:59,997
Civ?

369
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,208
-Yeah.
-Do you know it?

370
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:02,872
Could you teach it
in class today?

371
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:05,854
If I asked you to teach me
Roman law, could you do it?

372
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:07,134
Yes.

373
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:08,713
'Kay.

374
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:12,096
So, first things first,

375
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,463
when was the last time you slept?
Today's Friday.

376
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:17,268
Tuesday morning at 5 a.m.
I was arrested by the FBI,

377
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:19,370
I spent Tuesday in
L.A. County Jail.

378
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:21,023
I was assessed to be
a minimal flight risk

379
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:22,633
and bail was set at $100,000.

380
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,546
My mother signed over her house.

381
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:27,372
I was released on Wednesday and
ordered to appear in Federal Court

382
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:29,247
in New York's Southern District

383
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:30,864
at 10 a.m. today.

384
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:32,270
In here.

385
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,582
Close that will you?

386
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,156
I flew here Wednesday and met
with five attorneys yesterday.

387
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:42,664
Have a seat.

388
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:44,429
You didn't hire any of them?

389
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,242
Three of them had
already been taken.

390
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,445
Yeah, 31 people were named
in your indictment.

391
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:50,094
It's Black Friday for
criminal lawyers.

392
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:51,032
What about the other two?

393
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:53,500
One told me money was his
second favorite form of payment.

394
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:54,337
I know him.

395
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:56,547
The fifth was also taken
but he recommended I call you.

396
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,501
Why?

397
00:17:57,526 --> 00:17:59,400
I told him I wanted someone who'd
worked in the prosecutor’s office

398
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:01,658
and wasn't even a
little bit shady.

399
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:05,411
Do you know about me?

400
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:08,458
Um, I've been briefed a
little by my daughter

401
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:11,144
who knows a lot about your story
because her mother's a moron.

402
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:12,395
Her mother reads the tabloids.

403
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,591
Yeah, and I read them too.

404
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:16,561
I read your indictment after
I got your call last night

405
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,279
and I bought your book.

406
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,569
I'm only on page 112, but Molly,

407
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:22,631
did you commit a felony and
then write a book about it?

408
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:24,147
I haven't run
a game in two years.

409
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:26,016
Not to spoil the ending, but
that's when the government

410
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,743
raided my game and
took all of my money,

411
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:30,400
assuming all of it was made
illegally which it wasn't.

412
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:33,447
I've been living in my mother's
house in Telluride and...

413
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,384
I wrote the book so I could
start paying off debts.

414
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,087
I just finished a press
tour for the book

415
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:41,213
and I moved back to Los Angeles
so I could start over.

416
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:42,084
Hm.

417
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,076
You ran games in L.A. for
roughly eight years?

418
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,521
-Yeah.
-Without taking a rake?

419
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:47,397
Right.

420
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:49,178
And then you ran games in
New York for roughly two?

421
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:51,061
I took a rake
the last six months.

422
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:55,429
In the first 112 pages
you name a bunch of names.

423
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:56,902
Sorry?

424
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:58,659
Uh, you named the name
of some movie stars

425
00:18:58,691 --> 00:18:59,855
that played in your game.

426
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:01,542
Yeah.

427
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:04,566
That not against some
sort of poker code?

428
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:08,183
Am I supposed to be sitting
all the way over here?

429
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,285
Can you hear me from there?

430
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,090
Yeah.

431
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,357
Are you taking me
on as a client?

432
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:17,747
My retainer's $250,000.
Do you have $250,000?

433
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,210
No, I don't have anything.

434
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,217
What about the sales
from your book?

435
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:25,038
The book isn't jumping
off the shelves

436
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,477
but I will find a way
to pay you, Charlie.

437
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,938
Ask around about me.

438
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:32,997
Unfortunately, the people
I'd ask are going away for a while.

439
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:34,410
What happened on
Tuesday morning

440
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,526
was called a
GPS Takedown.

441
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,520
31 people were arrested
in the same instance.

442
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:41,961
Something in excess of 600 agents
were dispatched to locations in

443
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:44,008
New York, and L.A.
in coordinated strikes

444
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:45,828
with automatic
weapons and you're

445
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,245
trying to tell me
you're in my office

446
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,901
because you raked a
game of Texas Hold 'Em?

447
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:50,659
Yes.

448
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:52,479
Have you seen the other
names in your indictment?

449
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:54,589
Nicolas Koslovsky,
Peter Druzhinsky,

450
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,300
Peter Antonovich,
the Gershen brothers,

451
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:57,667
I mean, come on, Molly,
just how deep into

452
00:19:57,692 --> 00:20:00,894
the Russian mob were you?
Because your book doesn't say.

453
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,574
Why are you making your
daughter read <i>The Crucible</i>?

454
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,707
So she can see what
happens to a group

455
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:23,402
of bored teenage girls
when they gossip.

456
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:24,425
I never read the play.

457
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,340
Many consider it to be
the best play of the 20th Century.

458
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:28,028
Is that what many
consider it to be?

459
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,169
I don't defend
violent criminals.

460
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:31,591
I've never hurt
anyone in my life.

461
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:33,997
-Your friends have.
-I've never heard of 90 percent

462
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,600
-of the names in the indictment.
-And the other 10 percent?

463
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,451
I didn't know they
were connected.

464
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:37,867
I had no idea
who they really were.

465
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:39,164
Let me ask you a question.

466
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,414
The character in the
book you call Dean Keith,

467
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,890
he didn't say "Poor
people bagels," did he?

468
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,345
I think I know who he is,

469
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,970
I think I know a real estate lawyer
that worked with him and quit.

470
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:50,285
He said,

471
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:52,167
"nigger bagels," right?

472
00:20:57,906 --> 00:20:59,991
I'm not telling you his real name,
he's not involved in this.

473
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,930
But you were willing
to name some names.

474
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:10,110
Why is the FBI arresting me

475
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,665
two years after I've
stopped running games?

476
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,407
Were you paid extra in your book
deal to name the movie stars?

477
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,358
I'm not your guy, Molly.

478
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:24,350
I wish you good luck
but this just isn't for me.

479
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,913
I didn't know who
the Russians were.

480
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:38,704
I can get you the 250,000,

481
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:41,198
I left ten times that on the
street, it'll just take some time.

482
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:44,908
We regularly lend out our best
litigators like me to the ACLU,

483
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,330
Southern Poverty Law
Center, veterans groups,

484
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:49,463
but I don't think I can
convince my partners

485
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,924
to take a flyer on
the Poker Princess.

486
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:53,433
I didn't name myself
the Poker Princess.

487
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,622
Uh, "Molly Bloom, the
self-proclaimed Poker Princess..."

488
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:58,176
Is that <i>Us Weekly</i>?

489
00:21:58,201 --> 00:22:00,059
I would agree it would
be unusual for them

490
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:01,598
to print something
that wasn't true

491
00:22:01,665 --> 00:22:03,782
but it's not true and
if you think a princess

492
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:05,868
can do what I did,
you're incorrect.

493
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:07,456
I'm getting you don't
think much of me

494
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,253
but what if everyone
of your ill-informed,

495
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,432
unsophisticated opinions
about me were wrong?

496
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:12,245
I'd be amazed.

497
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,625
Yeah, you know what, bud?
You would.

498
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,250
You don't need me,
you need a publicist.

499
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,305
No, I need a fucking lawyer!

500
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:25,773
You didn't answer my question.

501
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:30,120
When was the last
time you slept?

502
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:34,604
It was a while ago.

503
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,111
All right.

504
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:46,876
I'm gonna walk you through
the arraignment this morning

505
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,611
'cause you shouldn't
do that alone.

506
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:51,036
I'm gonna put some bodies on you,
walk you through the side door.

507
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:53,411
'Cause I don't know what
you got on the Russians

508
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:54,802
but neither do they

509
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,519
and the Russians
take care of shit.

510
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:58,263
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

511
00:23:00,582 --> 00:23:01,426
Yes.

512
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:10,420
Almost. You gotta keep
your eyes up, okay?

513
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:11,991
Always gotta look ahead.

514
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:14,335
If you look down, that's
where you're gonna go.

515
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,720
If you look down,
that's where you'll go.

516
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:20,712
You ready?

517
00:23:25,246 --> 00:23:26,206
Let's go.

518
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,230
<i>My father's a therapist</i>

519
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:30,449
<i>and a psychology professor
at Colorado State.</i>

520
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:31,229
No!

521
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:32,207
No!

522
00:23:32,232 --> 00:23:34,483
<i>The second rule of his house
was that academic excellence</i>

523
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:36,372
<i>and athletic excellence
weren't optional.</i>

524
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:38,669
You can't be afraid of it.
All right?

525
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:40,080
Don't play defense.

526
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:41,369
<i>And the first rule</i>

527
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,486
<i>-was that he made all the rules.</i>
-Again!

528
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:45,377
Dad, I'm pretty tired.

529
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:46,830
Hon, she's tired.

530
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:49,121
We've been out here since 6:00.

531
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:50,895
Her lips are blue.

532
00:23:52,052 --> 00:23:53,880
-You tired?
-Yeah.

533
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,638
What's another word for tired?

534
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:03,543
Name a synonym for tired,
and we'll get in the car.

535
00:24:04,457 --> 00:24:05,309
Weak.

536
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:06,754
That's right.

537
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:08,692
Let's go home.

538
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:10,691
Again.

539
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:14,352
<i>I decided to postpone law
school another year.</i>

540
00:24:14,516 --> 00:24:15,688
<i>After six week of tips,</i>

541
00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:17,268
<i>I went to Barney's and
asked for a dress</i>

542
00:24:17,293 --> 00:24:19,344
<i>that made me look
nothing like myself.</i>

543
00:24:19,448 --> 00:24:22,573
<i>I'd overheard stories about games
that folded after one bad night</i>

544
00:24:22,598 --> 00:24:24,471
<i>and I needed this
one to keep going</i>

545
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,198
<i>and I needed to
bring value to it.</i>

546
00:24:26,223 --> 00:24:27,322
Good night, Molly.
Thanks very much.

547
00:24:27,347 --> 00:24:29,339
<i>I knew if I wanted
to cement my place,</i>

548
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:31,113
<i>there was one guy I
needed to team up with.</i>

549
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:31,970
-Ten thousand.
-Fold.

550
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:33,544
<i>And that was this man.</i>

551
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:35,927
<i>The game had regulars
and the game had guests.</i>

552
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:36,724
Check or bet?

553
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:38,552
<i>And four of the regulars
were famous actors.</i>

554
00:24:38,654 --> 00:24:40,927
And I'm gonna call
one of them Player X.

555
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:41,925
I'm all in.

556
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,714
<i>Player X subscribed
to the belief</i>

557
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,276
<i>that money won was twice
as good as money earned.</i>

558
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,716
<i>He lived to beat people
and take their money.</i>

559
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:50,262
<i>Here's Player X talking
to one of the guests.</i>

560
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,817
<i>into folding the winning hand.</i>

561
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:53,692
I swear on--look at me.

562
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:56,169
I swear on my mother's life
I have you.

563
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:02,390
<i>Player X was the best player
at the table and tonight</i>

564
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:03,851
<i>this guy was the worst.</i>

565
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:09,447
<i>He's staring at his cards.</i>

566
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:11,572
<i>Even a reasonably good
amateur would know it was</i>

567
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,424
<i>mathematically
the best hand</i>

568
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:15,135
<i>which in poker is
called the nuts.</i>

569
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,526
<i>There was $47,000 in the pot</i>

570
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:19,112
<i>and the guest was
holding the nuts</i>

571
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:20,604
<i>but he was starting
to get confused</i>

572
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:22,139
<i>because a movie star
was talking to him.</i>

573
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:23,763
My mother's life, man,
I'm not messing with you.

574
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:24,889
Why would you be telling me?

575
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:27,544
Either I <i>am</i> messing with you
or you're new to the game,

576
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,998
you've had bad cards all night,

577
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:30,552
you should've folded
after the flop

578
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:32,107
and I don't wanna win more
of your money this way.

579
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:33,310
I got queens under here.

580
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:35,773
Take your time.

581
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:50,403
Fold.

582
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,544
Fuck you.

583
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:52,130
No!

584
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,364
Oh!

585
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:02,951
<i>A fish is a particular
kind of player.</i>

586
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:05,154
<i>A fish has money.</i>

587
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:07,667
<i>A fish plays loose and
doesn't fold a lot.</i>

588
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,551
<i>A fish is good
but not too good.</i>

589
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:12,066
Good night, see you
up in the hall, bro.

590
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:14,230
<i>The Cobra Lounge may have
belonged do Dean Keith</i>

591
00:26:14,257 --> 00:26:16,038
<i>but the game belonged
to Player X.</i>

592
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,888
<i>People wanted to say
they played with him</i>

593
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:20,483
<i>the same way they wanted to say
they rode on Air Force One.</i>

594
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:23,724
<i>My job security was gonna depend
on bringing him his fish.</i>

595
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:25,740
<i>But where would I find
people with a lot of money</i>

596
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:27,177
<i>who didn't know
how to spend it</i>

597
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:28,747
<i>and liked to be
around celebrities?</i>

598
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:31,606
If they say they're interested in
poker you give them my number.

599
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,122
I vet them. They end
up playing in the game

600
00:26:34,617 --> 00:26:37,335
I'll give you $1,000
the first time they play,

601
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:39,335
$500 every time after that.

602
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,991
Be sure to mention... these
guys are all regulars.

603
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,655
Is this true? These guys play?

604
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,994
<i>The Commerce Casino is off
the 5 freeway in East L.A.</i>

605
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:52,307
<i>and no one's ever gonna
confuse it with Monte Carlo.</i>

606
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:54,487
<i>I'd watch the tables
for a while</i>

607
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,714
<i>before I approached
a friendly-looking pit boss.</i>

608
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:58,737
Third chair at Table 8
can't lose.

609
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:02,143
Unless there are players
at his table who can win.

610
00:27:02,651 --> 00:27:04,643
You know about the game at
the Cobra Lounge, right?

611
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,159
Sure.

612
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,346
$1,000 for every
player you send me.

613
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:10,047
You get a piece of
what they lose.

614
00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:11,461
No pros.

615
00:27:11,774 --> 00:27:13,024
I'm Molly.

616
00:27:14,344 --> 00:27:17,501
<i>Poker was my Trojan horse into
the highest level of finance,</i>

617
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,016
<i>technology, politics,
entertainment, art.</i>

618
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:21,868
<i>All I had to do was listen.</i>

619
00:27:21,968 --> 00:27:23,883
The art world is controlled
by a few major dealers.

620
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:26,320
China's telecom companies want
to partner with other providers.

621
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,539
The owners don't mind spending
30 million on an outfielder

622
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,313
who hits 320 with 110 RBI's.

623
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:32,024
They alone control the market.

624
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:34,166
They choose the artists
they want to be important.

625
00:27:34,191 --> 00:27:36,041
They mind spending
ten million on a pitcher

626
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:37,527
who is 8 and 14 this season.

627
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:38,511
It's gonna be Gephardt.

628
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:39,574
They set the prices,

629
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,496
they mark 'em up
70, 80, 90 percent.

630
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:45,246
They're all very excited about
a company called Twitter.

631
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:47,756
Unregulated money,
usually all cash...

632
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:49,346
-His days are numbered.
-His days are numbered.

633
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:50,845
I don't know how much longer
she's gonna be in the job.

634
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,955
-He's done.
-She's gone.

635
00:27:51,994 --> 00:27:53,041
All in.

636
00:27:53,126 --> 00:27:55,541
<i>People have asked me what
my goal was at that point,</i>

637
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:57,040
<i>what was my endgame.</i>

638
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:59,236
<i>Back then, I would've
laughed at the question.</i>

639
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,150
<i>I was raised to be a champion.</i>

640
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,845
<i>My goal was to win.</i>

641
00:28:02,984 --> 00:28:04,665
<i>At what and against whom?</i>

642
00:28:04,722 --> 00:28:06,261
<i>Those were just details.</i>

643
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:07,121
I'm all in.

644
00:28:07,316 --> 00:28:08,719
<i>I had my own apartment now.</i>

645
00:28:08,744 --> 00:28:09,547
I'll take it.

646
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:10,961
<i>A new car.</i>

647
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,891
<i>And $17,000 in a shoe box.</i>

648
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:15,901
<i>Law school could wait
one more year.</i>

649
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:20,159
Next please. Come on through.

650
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:22,272
Come on up please.

651
00:28:22,593 --> 00:28:24,132
Thank you. Come on through.

652
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:27,638
So, here's all that's
gonna happen today.

653
00:28:27,763 --> 00:28:29,067
The judge is gonna
ask each defendant

654
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:30,560
if they've read the indictment

655
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,599
or if they'd like the
court to read it to them.

656
00:28:32,716 --> 00:28:34,841
Then the judge is gonna
ask how you plead

657
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:36,880
and you're gonna
answer, "Not Guilty."

658
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:39,090
I'll make it clear for the record
that I'm not your counsel

659
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:41,387
but I am appearing on your
behalf at the arraignment.

660
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,309
In propria persona.

661
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:45,458
"In propria persona"
means on your behalf.

662
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,395
Yeah.

663
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:48,372
No, I'm saying it
means on your behalf.

664
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:49,573
I am appearing on your behalf.

665
00:28:49,643 --> 00:28:52,042
"In propria persona" means
you're appearing on <i>your</i> behalf,

666
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:53,651
not <i>my</i> behalf.

667
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:57,471
I'll check that out
but the point is

668
00:28:57,729 --> 00:29:00,963
I'm not your lawyer and I'll
make that clear for the record.

669
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:20,914
That's us over there.

670
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,357
You've got a good judge.
He's a good guy.

671
00:29:35,795 --> 00:29:37,240
How 'bout the prosecutor?

672
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:39,979
Good morning, Your Honor,
Harrison Wellstone,

673
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:41,885
Assistant U.S. Attorney
for the Southern District,

674
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:44,630
joined at counsel table by
Assistant U.S. Attorney

675

Eric Brennan,

676
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:48,873

00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:49,873
Thank you.

678
00:29:49,993 --> 00:29:52,228
Are there any oral
motions at this time?

679
00:29:52,431 --> 00:29:53,626
Switch with me.

680
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,269
Just in case your lawyer
doesn't mention it,

681
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:02,082
next time you appear
in front of the judge,

682
00:30:02,107 --> 00:30:04,207
you might wanna
re-think your clothes.

683
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:07,480
Okay? You look like the
Cinemax version of yourself.

684
00:30:08,796 --> 00:30:10,593
I sold my clothes when
the government seized

685
00:30:10,618 --> 00:30:12,382
all of my money
two years ago

686
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:14,867
which incidentally was
the last time I ran a game.

687
00:30:14,892 --> 00:30:16,648
But I think I already
mentioned that.

688
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,243
Okay.

689
00:30:19,773 --> 00:30:21,523
Hey, switch back.

690
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:22,922
Nicholas Siegel.

691
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:26,906
Has the defendant seen a
copy of the indictment?

692
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:28,148
Yes, Your Honor.

693
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:29,914
Have you discussed
it with your lawyer?

694
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,070
Yes.

695
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:32,851
Switch back.

696
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:35,988
-And how do you plead?
-Not guilty.

697
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:37,777
Thank you, you may have a seat.

698
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,652
Your old boss,

699
00:30:39,878 --> 00:30:42,034
the one in the book
you call Dean Keith,

700
00:30:42,085 --> 00:30:43,288
he was terrible to you.

701
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,085
Why cover up for him by changing
it to "poor people bagels"?

702
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:49,691
I promise you,
it couldn't matter less.

703
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:51,965
Has the defendant seen a
copy of the indictment?

704
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:54,004
Just making conversation.

705
00:30:55,808 --> 00:30:57,465
Hey, switch back.

706
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:00,112
And what do you plead?

707
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,026
Not guilty.

708
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:03,495
Have a seat.

709
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:06,721
Defendant number four,
Molly Bloom.

710
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:16,330
Good morning, Your Honor.
Uh, Charles Jaffey

711
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:18,854
for the defendant
just for the purposes--

712
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,879
Well, it's good to see you,
Mr. Jaffey.

713
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,113
Are you with us this morning?

714
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:34,245
Mr. Jaffey?

715
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:38,159
Uh, yes, sir.
Just uh, one moment.

716
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,030
-Switch back.
-Seriously?

717
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,397
You said you got ten times
that much on the street

718
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:46,100
in my office when I said

719
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,989
my retainer was
$250,000, you said,

720
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:50,701
"I have ten times that much."

721
00:31:50,802 --> 00:31:51,763
Yeah.

722
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:54,604
Counsel! I need to
record your appearance.

723
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:57,105
Please the court, Your Honor,
just one moment.

724
00:31:58,313 --> 00:32:00,461
You extended credit.
You're destitute

725
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:03,133
and you leave two and a half
million dollars on the street?

726
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,266
I had to.

727
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,750
Didn't anyone try to
buy your debt sheet?

728
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:08,125
Everyone tried to buy my debt
sheet, is this the right time...?

729
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:10,608
Why didn't you sell it like
you sold your clothes?

730
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:11,889
I couldn't.

731
00:32:12,225 --> 00:32:13,413
Why?

732
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:15,981
I couldn't be sure how
they were gonna collect.

733
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:21,619
I was afraid you
were gonna say that.

734
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:27,547
Counsel!

735
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:29,165
Mhmm.

736
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,219
Yes, Your Honor, uh,
Charles Jaffey for the defendant.

737
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:33,633
For the purposes
of this hearing only?

738
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,985
No, sir, I am
Molly Bloom's attorney.

739
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:38,376
Uh, she's read the indictment,
discussed it with her lawyer,

740
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:40,924
waives the right to have
it read to her and pleads

741
00:32:40,949 --> 00:32:42,182
"Not Guilty".

742
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:44,198
Thank you, you may be seated.

743
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,218
Defendant number five.
Gilyard Kirshman.

744
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:51,242
Gonna have to keep
reading your book.

745
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:57,607
<i>There was a track star in the
1930's named Matthew Robinson.</i>

746
00:32:58,091 --> 00:33:00,209
<i>Matthew Robinson shattered
the Olympic record</i>

747
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:03,550
<i>in the 200 at the
Berlin Games in 1936.</i>

748
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:06,784
<i>Absolutely shattered
the Olympic record...</i>

749
00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:08,756
<i>and came in second.</i>

750
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:11,725
<i>The man who came in first
was Jesse Owens.</i>

751
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:13,811
<i>Jesse Owens went
on to be a legend.</i>

752
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:15,782
<i>Matthew Robinson went
on to be a janitor</i>

753
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,384
<i>at a whites-only middle
school in Pasadena.</i>

754
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:21,657
<i>The difference was
four-tenths of a second.</i>

755
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:23,337
<i>As if that wasn't enough,
Matthew Robinson</i>

756
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:25,618
<i> had a little brother
who was also an athlete.</i>

757
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:27,470
<i>His name was Jackie.</i>

758
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:31,102
<i>I have two younger brothers
who were overachievers as well.</i>

759
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:33,665
<i>While I was ranked third
in North America,</i>

760
00:33:33,766 --> 00:33:36,305
<i>my brother Jeremy was
number one in the world.</i>

761
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:39,469
<i>And while I was placing into A.P.
Chemistry as a sophomore,</i>

762
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,860
<i>My brother Jordan was
doing it when he was</i>

763
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:43,758
<i>12 years old or something,
I don't know.</i>

764
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:46,362
<i>I was a hotshot student
and a hotshot skier</i>

765
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:48,136
<i>everywhere but my own house.</i>

766
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:51,721
<i>As I got older, I began to
bait my father into fights.</i>

767
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,400
<i>without really knowing
why I was doing it.</i>

768
00:33:53,425 --> 00:33:55,509
What did everyone learn
in school today?

769
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:01,654
Uh,

770
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:04,794
I learned that Sigmund Freud was
both a misogynist and an idiot

771
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:06,472
and anyone who relies
on his theories

772
00:34:06,497 --> 00:34:08,121
of human psychology
is a quack.

773
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,394
I don't know
why you'd say that.

774
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:10,951
You asked me what
I learned in school today.

775
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:13,107
-Is this Mrs. Linwood?
-Yep.

776
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:16,109
Did she happen to
mention anything about

777
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:18,227
his work on the
unconscious mind?

778
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:21,461
His dream analysis has the
credibility of a horoscope, but

779
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:22,775
what got my attention
was that he opposed

780
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,893
the women's
emancipation movement.

781
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:27,307
He believed that a woman's life is
about her reproductive function.

782
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:28,931
So you're really getting
to the nuts and bolts

783
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:30,495
of why middle-class
suburban white girls

784
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,815
have been oppressed
for centuries.

785
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,832
Mrs. Linwood was
just teaching us--

786
00:34:32,894 --> 00:34:34,722
Barbara Linwood doesn't
like men, Molly.

787
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:37,996
She doesn't like dicks, Dad,
there's a difference.

788
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:39,168
Molly.

789
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,545
Don't disrespect me
like that at the table.

790
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,264
I wasn't disrespecting you,
I was disrespecting Freud.

791
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,928
And it's the kitchen table, not the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

792
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:53,310
And I'm a professional
psychologist, not a quack.

793
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:56,075
-I never said you were a quack.
-Yeah, you did and don't do it again.

794
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:00,867
And don't ever use
language like that again.

795
00:35:01,024 --> 00:35:01,907
Okay.

796
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,446
Ignore my teachers,
watch my language

797
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:05,018
and respect the kitchen table.

798
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:06,760
What else do I need to do
before I'm allowed

799
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:07,963
to disagree with you?

800
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:09,119
Make your own money

801
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:10,964
so you can live
in your own house

802
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:13,151
and eat your own food.

803
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,192
<i>I've been running the
game for three years</i>

804
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:20,137
<i>and saved $58,000.</i>

805
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,786
<i>I was recruiting and
vetting players,</i>

806
00:35:22,918 --> 00:35:23,957
<i>-keeping the books,</i>
-Call.

807
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,645
<i>collecting and delivering checks,</i>

808
00:35:25,762 --> 00:35:27,684
<i>meeting the needs of all the
players throughout the week</i>

809
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,903
<i>and still working
full-time for Dean Keith,</i>

810
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:32,245
<i>who made it clear that
if I quit the office job,</i>

811
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,692
<i>-I'd lose the game.</i>
-Call.

812
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:34,994
Eights full of nines.

813
00:35:36,615 --> 00:35:37,459
Again.

814
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:39,569
-That's how it is.
-Every time.

815
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:46,794
I thought he had trips too.

816
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,286
He was slow-playing
into the river and

817
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:49,638
he hid the pocket
eights pretty well.

818
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:51,676
Tough beat, man.

819
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,278
-You owe the game--
-I know what I owe the game.

820
00:35:57,432 --> 00:35:58,682
I wanna talk to you a minute.

821
00:35:58,729 --> 00:35:59,995
-Okay.
-In the hall.

822
00:36:00,272 --> 00:36:02,904
♪ He came from an island ♪

823
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:07,422
♪ And he died from the streets ♪

824
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:12,128
Is he cheating?

825
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,097
No.

826
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:15,175
How would you know?

827
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,409
I'd know.

828
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:18,142
He and Diego aren't
in bed together?

829
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:19,096
No.

830
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:21,205
What about him and you?

831
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:26,076
A 52 card deck produces hundreds
of millions of random patterns

832
00:36:26,263 --> 00:36:28,233
but every time one of you
loses two weeks in a row,

833
00:36:28,258 --> 00:36:30,962
you're sure something fishy's
going on? Come on.

834
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,655
I'm gonna stop paying you.

835
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:38,403
-What do you mean?
-As my assistant.

836
00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:41,317
-You firing me?
-I'm not firing you

837
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:42,278
I'm just gonna stop paying you.

838
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:44,739
You get paid once a week from
the game, it doesn't seem fair.

839
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,716
But I also have a job
working for you

840
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:48,559
-24 hours a day.
-And if you didn't have that job

841
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,014
you wouldn't have the game.

842
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:50,936
You understand what I'm saying?

843
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,390
I understand each of the
words that you're saying,

844
00:36:52,415 --> 00:36:53,689
-but I don't understand--
-Look.

845
00:36:53,736 --> 00:36:55,478
24 hours a day
every day.

846
00:36:55,503 --> 00:36:56,798
You're gonna stop paying
me to do that job

847
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:57,923
because I'm making
too much money

848
00:36:57,948 --> 00:36:59,587
doing my second job
and if I say no

849
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:02,211
I'll lose both jobs
because "it doesn't seem fair"?

850
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:03,963
Business is bad right now.

851
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:05,752
Welcome to the real world.

852
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:08,687
All right, here it is.

853
00:37:08,788 --> 00:37:11,187
Banks are loaning you money
and they shouldn't.

854
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,179
You're a bad risk, they know it.

855
00:37:13,204 --> 00:37:15,485
So the debt service on your
loans is close to 20 percent

856
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,062
which is crazy.

857
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:20,704
20 percent is barely survivable
if it's a bridge loan

858
00:37:20,729 --> 00:37:23,920
but like, for instance,
it's taken you ten years

859
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,428
to build seven houses,

860
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:28,325
all of which are worth less than
they were before you built them

861
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,278
because the housing market
is on a downward trajectory

862
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:32,515
for the first time in
the history of houses

863
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,819
and that's why
business is doing bad,

864
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:37,772
not because you're
paying me $450 a week.

865
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,108
You're a business savant?

866
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:40,767
I've read every piece of
paper in your office.

867
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,494
You're making thousands
in tips every week,

868
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:43,284
Why do you care about

869
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:44,423
-$450 a week?
-Because I don't want to

870
00:37:44,448 --> 00:37:46,111
pick up your dry
cleaning for free.

871
00:37:46,136 --> 00:37:47,832
You don't have
bargaining power here.

872
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:51,745
You can refuse the pay cut
but you'll lose the game.

873
00:37:53,596 --> 00:37:54,979
Cash me out, please.

874
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,636
<i>I wasn't gonna wait for Dean
to take the game away from me</i>

875
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:01,292
<i>before I put a plan in place.</i>

876
00:38:01,956 --> 00:38:04,339
<i>The next morning, I made
appointments at the Four Seasons,</i>

877
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:06,886
<i>the Peninsula and the
Beverly Hills Hotel.</i>

878
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:10,234
<i>The suite was $5,200 a night.</i>

879
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:13,549
<i>I spent $17,000 on a
Shuffle Master</i>

880
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:15,542
<i>that was installed in the table.</i>

881
00:38:15,602 --> 00:38:19,016
<i>Faster, more reliable shuffles,
less downtime between hands.</i>

882
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:20,860
<i>Food was brought in
from Mr. Chow</i>

883
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:22,715
<i>and available to eat
on the side tables.</i>

884
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,317
<i>There was Macallan 18,
Belvedere, 1942,</i>

885
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:29,093
<i>Remy Martin, and an
'88 Lafite Rothschild</i>

886
00:38:29,118 --> 00:38:31,890
<i>served by a bartender who'd
already memorized your drink.</i>

887
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,709
<i>Cohibas, Monte Cristo
in the humidor</i>

888
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:37,776
<i>A professional stylist turned me
into what my defense attorney</i>

889
00:38:37,801 --> 00:38:40,565
<i>would later call the
Cinemax version of myself.</i>

890
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,733
<i>I spent almost
everything I had</i>

891
00:38:42,758 --> 00:38:45,171
<i>in preparation for the phone call
I knew was coming.</i>

892
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:51,670
Hello?

893
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:54,093
<i>I want you to listen to me.
'Cause you need to hear this.</i>

894
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:54,945
Where are you?

895
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,890
<i>I need to tell you
something in plain English</i>

896
00:38:56,915 --> 00:38:58,376
<i>and I need to know that
you understood it.</i>

897
00:38:58,401 --> 00:38:59,079
Dean.

898
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:01,884
<i>You are unimportant,
did you hear me?</i>

899
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:04,111
<i>And you are fired.</i>

900
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,780
<i>The job, the game, you're fired.</i>

901
00:39:06,874 --> 00:39:07,999
Can I ask why?

902
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:09,772
<i>How many of my friends
are you sleeping with?</i>

903
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:11,046
I'm not sleeping
with any of them.

904
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:12,221
<i>That's not what I heard.</i>

905
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:13,799
Listen to me,

906
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:14,994
with a Hazmat suit,
I wouldn't--

907
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,729
<i>Can I give you some advice?</i>

908
00:39:18,072 --> 00:39:21,462
<i>Lose the bitchy air.
Lose the superior air.</i>

909
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:23,306
<i>And go to the office
and get your stuff</i>

910
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:25,143
<i>and be out of there
before I show up.</i>

911
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:27,697
Hey, are you Molly?

912
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:29,354
Yeah.

913
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:32,455
I'm Leah. Uh, Dean asked
me to pack your personals.

914
00:39:32,947 --> 00:39:34,065
I appreciate it.

915
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:37,299
He also asked me to get the
numbers of tonight's players

916
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:38,987
so I can confirm the list.

917
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:40,620
I'm really sorry.

918
00:39:40,768 --> 00:39:41,815
Don't be.

919
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:45,815
My phone's in my car. Uh,

920
00:39:45,877 --> 00:39:47,986
I'll text you all the numbers
you need when I get downstairs.

921
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:50,634
<i>I texted my replacement
a bunch of random numbers</i>

922
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,197
<i>with 310 area codes.</i>

923
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:54,143
<i>Then I sent a text to
the players for tonight</i>

924
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:56,019
<i>and told them the
game had been moved</i>

925
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:59,152

Where's Dean?

937
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:39,140
I'll be hosting a game in this
suite every Tuesday night.

938
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,518
If you play tonight, you'll be
guaranteed a chair for a year.

939
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:45,086
If you prefer to play
at the Cobra Lounge,

940
00:40:45,672 --> 00:40:47,086
there'll be no hard feelings.

941
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:55,055
Let's play.

942
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,508
<i>The game was mine now.</i>

943
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,759
<i>I incorporated and Molly Bloom
Event Planning was born.</i>

944
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:02,563
<i>I paid taxes and
1099'd my employees.</i>

945
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:04,969
<i>I never became romantically
or sexually involved</i>

946
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:06,423
<i>with any of the players.</i>

947
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:07,890
<i>The game would've fallen apart.</i>

948
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,572
<i>This was back when I was
still making good decisions.</i>

949
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:14,119
<i>And I went to a lawyer to make
absolutely sure all this was legal.</i>

950
00:41:14,283 --> 00:41:15,212
Are you taking a rake?

951
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:16,150
No.

952
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:17,830
Then you're not
breaking the law.

953
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,773
-Can I give you some advice?
-Please.

954
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:21,232
There's a saying in my business.

955
00:41:21,317 --> 00:41:23,325
Don't break the law when
you're breaking the law.

956
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:24,792
What do you mean?

957
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,776
No drugs, no prostitutes,
no muscle to collect debts.

958
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:29,542
Oh, I don't do
anything like that.

959
00:41:29,618 --> 00:41:31,860
But you just said
I wasn't breaking the law.

960
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,492
Keep it that way, because you
don't want to break the law

961
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:34,938
when you're breaking the law.

962
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,197
Am I breaking the law?

963
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:38,767
Not really.

964
00:41:39,078 --> 00:41:41,148
We're able to find out
for sure, aren't we?

965
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:42,328
Laws are written down.

966
00:41:42,378 --> 00:41:43,925
You're not taking a
percentage of the pot?

967
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:44,902
No.

968
00:41:45,182 --> 00:41:46,534
You're running a square game.

969
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,000
<i>My game had a tricky ecosystem.</i>

970
00:41:50,102 --> 00:41:51,719
<i>These guys could buy anything</i>

971
00:41:51,852 --> 00:41:54,727
<i>but here in this room
you couldn't buy your win.</i>

972
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:57,307
<i>You couldn't buy me,
you couldn't buy the girls</i>

973
00:41:57,518 --> 00:41:59,284
<i>and you couldn't buy
a seat at the table.</i>

974
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:02,596
<i>There's nothing as sweet as
a win you have to work for.</i>

975
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:05,940
<i>And the wins and losses were
compelling and they were real.</i>

976
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:08,478
<i>Of course it helped that the
players were gambling addicts.</i>

977
00:42:08,556 --> 00:42:10,080
Can I see you for a second?

978
00:42:15,895 --> 00:42:17,348
Jay, you're famous.

979
00:42:17,473 --> 00:42:19,114
You are an international
rock star.

980
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,255
Oh, I wasn't sure you'd noticed.

981
00:42:21,699 --> 00:42:23,035
You can't send
e-mails like that.

982
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,754
Well, it's not a federal
production, okay? I just...

983
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:28,074
invited you to Cabo
for the weekend.

984
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:30,071
The next woman you send
an e-mail like that to,

985
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:32,947
it's not gonna be me. It's
gonna be someone else.

986
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,244
You're playing with fire.

987
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:36,166
I'm telling you that
I'm in love with you

988
00:42:36,191 --> 00:42:38,502
and you are worried about
me getting blackmailed.

989
00:42:38,527 --> 00:42:40,861
Oh, my--that just makes
me more into you.

990
00:42:40,947 --> 00:42:43,406
Lemon head, they won't
need to blackmail you.

991
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:45,696
They can get just as
much money from TMZ.

992
00:42:45,766 --> 00:42:48,219
And TMZ will give them
what they really want--

993
00:42:48,244 --> 00:42:49,352
Tell me the truth,
was mine the first

994
00:42:49,377 --> 00:42:50,634
love letter you've
gotten from a player?

995
00:42:50,659 --> 00:42:51,912
It was the seventh.

996
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:53,732
All digitally transmitted.

997
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:54,991
You are begging
for your life

998
00:42:55,016 --> 00:42:57,210
to be turned into a
very public hell.

999
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,913
So that's a no on Cabo?

1000
00:42:58,938 --> 00:43:00,555
Why don't you just give
your wife and kids a break

1001
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,242
and run them
over with a limo?

1002
00:43:02,305 --> 00:43:03,774
I love the way
that you talk to me.

1003
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,970
Oh, God.

1004
00:43:10,612 --> 00:43:11,546
I've had a thought.

1005
00:43:11,628 --> 00:43:13,792
-Yeah?
-Raise the stakes.

1006
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:17,453
To what?

1007
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:21,726
50K buy-in. Blinds are 250-500.

1008
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:27,821
-That's a 500 percent hike.
-Yeah.

1009
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:30,321
I don't think it's a good idea.

1010
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:31,915
You guys give me the
room for a second?

1011
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:34,738
Sure.

1012
00:43:40,214 --> 00:43:41,839
The players that are
losing 100,000 a week

1013
00:43:41,864 --> 00:43:43,183
are gonna be losing
half a million.

1014
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,604
And the players are
winning 100,000 a week--

1015
00:43:44,629 --> 00:43:46,550
Will have no one
left to play with.

1016
00:43:46,614 --> 00:43:48,708
Players are gonna get hurt,
others are gonna get killed and

1017
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:49,872
some will drop out.

1018
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:52,088
It's not sustainable.
We'll lose the game.

1019
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:54,577
Find new players.

1020
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:56,952
<i>He meant find new fish.</i>

1021
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:58,671
<i>I went recruiting again.</i>

1022
00:43:58,757 --> 00:44:00,484
<i>First up was Donnie Silverman.</i>

1023
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:02,861
<i>Donnie won the World
Series of Poker last year</i>

1024
00:44:02,924 --> 00:44:04,861
<i>and got in touch with me
through one of the players.</i>

1025
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:06,025
Are you fuckin' nuts?

1026
00:44:06,134 --> 00:44:08,174
Donnie Silverman won
the World Series of Poker.

1027
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:09,697
You can watch it online.

1028
00:44:10,142 --> 00:44:12,338
He took 11 hands
at the final table.

1029
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:14,275
But he had the nuts
on eight of them.

1030
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,174
And three of those...

1031
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:19,705
three were two-outers with
four players still in the hand.

1032
00:44:19,846 --> 00:44:22,229
He ran hot. He doesn't
lock his chips down,

1033
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:23,994
he's reckless,
he gives tons of action,

1034
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:25,863
and he's got
12 million dollars.

1035
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:34,075
You know,
I don't like playing poker.

1036
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:35,555
Why do you play?

1037
00:44:35,805 --> 00:44:37,351
I like destroying lives.

1038
00:44:37,703 --> 00:44:38,851
Give him a chair.

1039
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:42,356
<i>-The next recruit...</i>
-Good evening, gentlemen.

1040
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:45,458
<i>was Brad Marion, who
everyone called Bad Brad</i>

1041
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:49,158
<i>because he was uniquely
terrible at this game.</i>

1042
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:51,636
<i>If there was a worst
player in the world,</i>

1043
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:53,768
<i>Brad would still
find a way to lose to him.</i>

1044
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,112
Sorry, I don't have a chair,
but you're welcome to a drink.

1045
00:44:56,172 --> 00:44:58,359
No, I just came to
introduce you to uh, Brad.

1046
00:44:58,384 --> 00:44:59,257
All in.

1047
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:02,116
Sorry?

1048
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:04,451
I just wanted to introduce you to
Brad Marion, he wants to play.

1049
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:05,983
Give me his information,
I'll check him out.

1050
00:45:06,008 --> 00:45:07,328
No, Derrick's gonna
vouch for him.

1051
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,632
<i>"Derrick's gonna vouch for him"
meant Derrick would cover</i>

1052
00:45:09,657 --> 00:45:12,948
<i>any losses if Brad didn't pay.
Up to any amount.</i>

1053
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,746
-Hi, I'm Molly Bloom.
-Brad Marion.

1054
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:19,261
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

1055
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:21,025
<i>But he could pay,
and had to</i>

1056
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,417
<i>because he embraced the fallacy
of being pot-committed.</i>

1057
00:45:24,483 --> 00:45:25,600
I'm all in.

1058
00:45:25,678 --> 00:45:27,365
<i>You've invested so much,</i>

1059
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,389
<i>you might as well see
it through to the end.</i>

1060
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,869
Move it up, $2,000 to call.

1061
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:33,385
<i>Bad Brad had raised
700 million dollars</i>

1062
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,174
<i>for a fund that
traded oil futures.</i>

1063
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,534
<i>And every week,
he came to the game.</i>

1064
00:45:37,594 --> 00:45:39,749
<i>Lost $100,000 and
tipped me $5,000</i>

1065
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:41,390
<i>so he could
play the next week.</i>

1066
00:45:41,415 --> 00:45:42,250
Thank you.

1067
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:43,804
<i>He wasn't getting any better.</i>

1068
00:45:44,434 --> 00:45:46,168
<i>And the guys were
feasting on him.</i>

1069
00:45:50,176 --> 00:45:51,535
Can I get another fifty?

1070
00:45:52,571 --> 00:45:54,415
-Can we talk for a second?
-Sure.

1071
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:58,207
Brad, this game might
not be for you.

1072
00:45:58,285 --> 00:45:59,590
I know I'm no card shark.

1073
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:01,371
No, you're not.

1074
00:46:04,013 --> 00:46:06,318
Here are your losses
after ten weeks.

1075
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:07,934
And you've won...

1076
00:46:08,152 --> 00:46:09,027
never.

1077
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:11,036
It's actually a
statistical anomaly.

1078
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:12,520
Yeah, I know.

1079
00:46:13,873 --> 00:46:16,350
I like playing with the guys.
I don't have that many friends.

1080
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:18,092
Don't take my seat away.

1081
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:20,889
-I can tip you more.
-No.

1082
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:23,006
Your tips are very generous.

1083
00:46:23,185 --> 00:46:25,209
How about I-I give
you some books?

1084
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:27,428
Or even a pro to
give you some lessons.

1085
00:46:27,682 --> 00:46:29,268
Yeah, uh, maybe.

1086
00:46:30,237 --> 00:46:31,760
Let me think about it.

1087
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,117
Okay.

1088
00:46:33,203 --> 00:46:35,016
<i>Turned out Bad Brad
knew what he was doing.</i>

1089
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,727
<i>He was getting customers.</i>

1090
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:39,038
<i>He'd drop his
100K at the game</i>

1091
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,148
<i>and pick up four million
for his hedge fund.</i>

1092
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:42,983
-Tell 'em what's smart this week.
-Not me.

1093
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,561
<i>More on that later,
but first...</i>

1094
00:46:44,764 --> 00:46:45,936
<i>Harlan Eustice.</i>

1095
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,578
<i>Player X said he met Harlan
at the Commerce Casino</i>

1096
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:50,141
<i>and that he'd be
good for the game</i>

1097
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,868
<i>but I wasn't seeing
what he was seeing.</i>

1098
00:46:52,213 --> 00:46:54,533
<i>He played tight, folding
after the hole cards</i>

1099
00:46:54,558 --> 00:46:55,886
<i>64 percent of the time.</i>

1100
00:46:55,954 --> 00:46:57,993
<i>It wasn't clear where
his money came from.</i>

1101
00:46:58,298 --> 00:46:59,805
<i>He produced backyard
wrestling videos</i>

1102
00:46:59,837 --> 00:47:01,290
<i>and other low-rent
productions.</i>

1103
00:47:02,149 --> 00:47:06,040
<i>But worst of all, Harlan Eustice
was a good card player.</i>

1104
00:47:06,212 --> 00:47:08,868
<i>Why would Player X want someone
at the game who could beat him?</i>

1105
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,352
<i>I'd learn the answer to
that one the hard way.</i>

1106
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,087
-How was your flight?
-Just fine.

1107
00:47:14,149 --> 00:47:16,579
How are you paying for tickets
between L.A. and New York?

1108
00:47:16,657 --> 00:47:18,634
I had 2 million points
left on my Amex.

1109
00:47:18,696 --> 00:47:19,794
They took the card but
let me keep the points

1110
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:21,329
which I thought
was nice of them.

1111
00:47:21,354 --> 00:47:22,415
You had meetings.

1112
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:23,821
Hm?

1113
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:25,867
You had meetings in L.A. about
your book and life rights?

1114
00:47:25,892 --> 00:47:26,953
-I did.
-Was there any interest?

1115
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:29,015
A company that owns 4,000
video poker machines

1116
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,775
wants to put my face on 'em.

1117
00:47:30,943 --> 00:47:32,107
Anything else?

1118
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:34,979
Treat Magazine made
a generous offer.

1119
00:47:35,057 --> 00:47:35,744
Treat?

1120
00:47:35,775 --> 00:47:38,041
It's a new magazine for the
high-end photography enthusiast.

1121
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:40,354
-They want you to pose naked?
-I'd be the April treat.

1122
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:41,910
I meant interest in your book.

1123
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:43,074
Uh, yeah.

1124
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,004
Any offers?

1125
00:47:45,105 --> 00:47:47,550
A few I guess.
A couple.

1126
00:47:48,847 --> 00:47:50,557
-Five.
-Really?

1127
00:47:50,636 --> 00:47:52,331
-Yeah.
-And...?

1128
00:47:52,363 --> 00:47:53,166
I passed.

1129
00:47:53,214 --> 00:47:54,909
You're destitute and
you passed on five offers

1130
00:47:54,934 --> 00:47:56,607
-to turn you book into a movie?
-You will be paid, Charlie.

1131
00:47:56,669 --> 00:47:58,396
I'm just curious as to
why you passed

1132
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:00,850
on what appear to be
the only way out you have.

1133
00:48:01,057 --> 00:48:03,377
-Creative differences.
-Okay.

1134
00:48:03,424 --> 00:48:04,338
Should we start?

1135
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:06,244
You know, I am gonna
figure you out.

1136
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:07,592
Well, let me know what you find.

1137
00:48:07,662 --> 00:48:08,553
You see this?

1138
00:48:08,724 --> 00:48:12,177
This is discovery.
Let's see what we discovered.

1139
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:16,045
Over here, we have
Peter Druzhinsky,

1140
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:19,961
Peter Antonovich and
Peter Slobo. The three Petes.

1141
00:48:20,015 --> 00:48:22,663
Now the three Petes run a chain
of corrupt medical clinics

1142
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:25,023
and have been committing
insurance fraud,

1143
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,937
wire fraud and mail
fraud on an epic scale.

1144
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:31,778
Now over here, we have the
Rachniana-Gershen Organization.

1145
00:48:32,486 --> 00:48:34,392
They're a worldwide
bookmaking operation

1146
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:36,822
handling hundreds of
millions of dollars a year

1147
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,672
in illegal sports betting.

1148
00:48:38,743 --> 00:48:41,813
And over here, we have the
Alexander Habib organization.

1149
00:48:42,477 --> 00:48:44,935
This is also an illegal
sports betting organization

1150
00:48:44,975 --> 00:48:49,998
but this one, financed by an art
gallery owned by Shillel Habib

1151
00:48:50,065 --> 00:48:52,588
-who everyone calls--
-Shelly.

1152
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,590
This is the Russian mafia.

1153
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:03,419
And the three are tied together
in the indictment through...

1154
00:49:03,575 --> 00:49:05,067
A poker game.

1155
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:07,555
Were they tapping my phones?

1156
00:49:07,633 --> 00:49:09,243
-No.
-Thank God.

1157
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:11,721
They were tapping the phones
of everyone you talked to.

1158
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:12,762
Okay.

1159
00:49:12,848 --> 00:49:14,785
They've got you confirming
that you ran rake games

1160
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:17,457
at the Plaza Hotel and
various locations in New York.

1161
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:20,050
They've also got a confidential
informant confirming

1162
00:49:20,075 --> 00:49:22,246
that you ran raked games
at the Plaza Hotel

1163
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:23,877
and various locations
in New York.

1164
00:49:23,901 --> 00:49:28,041
You were in violation of 1955,
which is the part of the U.S. Code

1165
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:31,127
that makes it illegal to run
an illegal gambling business.

1166
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,340
You know what you did?

1167
00:49:32,496 --> 00:49:34,988
You finished writing a book
before the good part happened.

1168
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,238
You really get a kick out
of yourself, don't you?

1169
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:38,520
You know,

1170
00:49:38,754 --> 00:49:40,598
-I don't like this picture.
-Thank you.

1171
00:49:40,623 --> 00:49:41,919
You look like the cat
that ate the canary

1172
00:49:41,944 --> 00:49:43,761
and then told the canary's
parents about it.

1173
00:49:43,786 --> 00:49:46,084
It's the picture the publisher
wanted and I didn't get a vote.

1174
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,208
I like the book.
Good story, well told.

1175
00:49:48,273 --> 00:49:50,109
-Thank you.
-I need you to tell it again, though.

1176
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,601
From the beginning
and this time

1177
00:49:51,626 --> 00:49:53,359
without skipping
over the Russians.

1178
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:55,577
-Would you like a glass of water?
-I'd like a glass of bourbon.

1179
00:49:58,956 --> 00:50:00,503
-One more thing.
-Yeah.

1180
00:50:01,105 --> 00:50:02,276
I need your hard drives.

1181
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:04,245
-Going back how far?
-What do you mean?

1182
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:06,323
Well, I kept my hard drives
when I'd buy a new laptop.

1183
00:50:06,698 --> 00:50:07,581
You're kidding.

1184
00:50:07,612 --> 00:50:09,143
No, it had a record
of who owed what

1185
00:50:09,168 --> 00:50:10,300
and spreadsheets
on the players.

1186
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:11,527
It has more than that.

1187
00:50:11,552 --> 00:50:13,527
Every time you charge
your phone by plugging it

1188
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,573
into the computer,
the computer takes a record

1189
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:17,630
of all your text
messages and e-mails.

1190
00:50:17,655 --> 00:50:19,412
My laptop has a record
of all text messages

1191
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:21,491
and e-mails received
years ago on phones

1192
00:50:21,516 --> 00:50:23,405
that have been smashed
with an aluminum bat?

1193
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,484
I want to run forensic imaging
on your hard drives.

1194
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:28,797
Oh, no, thanks anyway, but I'll
be destroying those hard drives.

1195
00:50:28,836 --> 00:50:30,211
Well, you can't do that,
they're evidence.

1196
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,422
Well, I'm gonna blow 'em up, I am
literally gonna use explosives

1197
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:33,705
and scatter the
remains in the sea.

1198
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,182
Except you told me they exist.

1199
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:36,455
You're gonna have to
pretend I didn't tell you.

1200
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,580
-Can't do that.
-Yes, you can.

1201
00:50:37,605 --> 00:50:38,574
You were the one who
wanted a lawyer

1202
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:39,917
that wasn't even a
little bit shady.

1203
00:50:39,942 --> 00:50:41,058
New information has
come to light,

1204
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,152
now I see that that was stupid.

1205
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:43,222
-Molly.
-There are no hard drives.

1206
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:45,011
If you destroy evidence
and obstruct justice

1207
00:50:45,036 --> 00:50:47,628
on top of the charges already
brought against you in this case,

1208
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:50,121
you will be, I promise,
incarcerated.

1209
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:51,817
You don't understand what's
in those text messages.

1210
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:53,606
I understand you've
had boyfriends

1211
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:54,826
and there'll be some exchanges

1212
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:56,373
that are a little bit,
you know, embarrassing.

1213
00:50:56,419 --> 00:50:59,005
I don't care about embarrassing
text messages from boyfriends

1214
00:50:59,043 --> 00:51:01,824
as there's not left a small
corner of my private life

1215
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:04,379
that isn't available
for public scrutiny.

1216
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:07,432
There are messages that
would destroy other lives.

1217
00:51:07,457 --> 00:51:09,299
There are messages
that would end careers

1218
00:51:09,324 --> 00:51:10,784
and obliterate families.

1219
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:13,449
If those text messages
were to be made public,

1220
00:51:13,474 --> 00:51:15,044
-They won't be.
-If they were,

1221
00:51:15,069 --> 00:51:16,482
-They won't be.
-it would be catastrophic

1222
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:18,185
-for many people.
-I'm a lawyer. I'm legally--

1223
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,123
-No.
-Listen to me,

1224
00:51:19,148 --> 00:51:21,739
I am legally prohibited
from disclosing anything--

1225
00:51:21,764 --> 00:51:24,826
Someone leaked my last deposition
to the <i>National Enquirer</i>, Charlie.

1226
00:51:24,896 --> 00:51:25,607
Butterball?

1227
00:51:25,632 --> 00:51:27,248
My last lawyer's
name was Butterman

1228
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,163
and he was one of five people
in the room besides me.

1229
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:32,007
But the information
in that deposition

1230
00:51:32,032 --> 00:51:34,361
would be nothing compared
to the consequences

1231
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:35,627
of those text messages--

1232
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:38,158
Ah! I just got it.

1233
00:51:38,351 --> 00:51:39,578
showing up everywhere.

1234
00:51:39,603 --> 00:51:42,992
I couldn't figure out why you
named some people but not others.

1235
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,103
I thought that maybe
some people paid you.

1236
00:51:45,128 --> 00:51:46,798
You were wrong but
it doesn't matter.

1237
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,474
No, the only people you
named in that book

1238
00:51:48,499 --> 00:51:50,153
were the ones that
were already named

1239
00:51:50,178 --> 00:51:52,073
in the Bad Brad
Marion deposition

1240
00:51:52,098 --> 00:51:53,630
-which you think
-I know.

1241
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:55,045
-somebody leaked it
-Sold it.

1242
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,194
-to the tabloids,
-Yes.

1243
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:57,952
-maybe even Butterbean.
-Butterman, but...

1244
00:51:57,977 --> 00:51:58,922
I don't know who it was.

1245
00:51:58,947 --> 00:52:01,604
I watched Jenny McCarthy beat
you up for naming the players.

1246
00:52:01,629 --> 00:52:02,394
Why don't you just say,

1247
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,480
"Hey, those names are
already public record."

1248
00:52:04,505 --> 00:52:05,388
I don't know.

1249
00:52:05,434 --> 00:52:07,067
'Cause it wasn't on The View
under subpoena.

1250
00:52:07,092 --> 00:52:09,161
Can we please get back
to the e-mails and texts?

1251
00:52:09,266 --> 00:52:10,703
Is that why you have
creative differences

1252
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:11,828
with the Hollywood office?

1253
00:52:11,853 --> 00:52:14,352
Because they want information
you won't give them?

1254
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:15,510
I don't owe you.

1255
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,674
If what happened last time
were to happen this time,

1256
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:19,572
it would make what
happened last time--

1257
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,385
What is this for?

1258
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,959
It's got every text message and
e-mail I sent in the last year

1259
00:52:23,984 --> 00:52:26,600
as well as a variety of
incriminating evidence

1260
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:27,623
about my clients.

1261
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:29,148
Now, if anything of
yours gets leaked,

1262
00:52:29,173 --> 00:52:31,070
you can sell my phone
to the highest bidder

1263
00:52:31,095 --> 00:52:33,562
and I'll lose my job
and get disbarred.

1264
00:52:33,892 --> 00:52:36,712
So, in order to demonstrate the
sanctity of your attorney/client

1265
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,174
confidentiality,

1266
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:40,048
you're betraying
the confidentiality

1267
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:41,533
of all your other clients.

1268
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,088
I know you're
not gonna look at it.

1269
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:45,776
How do you know?

1270
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:47,627
I don't know.

1271
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,552
I'll fly home to Colorado

1272
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:57,802
and be back the next day
with the hard drives.

1273
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:03,443
<i>Harlan Eustice was excited about
the surprise 40th birthday party</i>

1274
00:53:03,468 --> 00:53:06,014
<i>he was throwing for
his wife in 24 hours.</i>

1275
00:53:06,048 --> 00:53:08,313
Rented out the whole courtyard
at the Buffalo Club.

1276
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:10,134
Gonna be about
a hundred people.

1277
00:53:10,181 --> 00:53:12,829
Kumamoto oysters,
snow crab, lobsters,

1278
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:15,150
<i>He wasn't ticking off
menu items to show off.</i>

1279
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:18,178
<i>He was genuinely excited about
the party he was giving his wife.</i>

1280
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:19,639
She doesn't know
anything about it.

1281
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:22,319
She thinks we're having dinner
with her brother and his wife.

1282
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:24,781
<i>I liked Harlan.</i>

1283
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,055
<i>But nobody else like
him except Player X.</i>

1284
00:53:27,523 --> 00:53:30,234
<i>He played tight,
didn't give a lot of action</i>

1285
00:53:30,594 --> 00:53:32,328
<i>and always got his
money in good</i>

1286
00:53:32,555 --> 00:53:34,273
<i>which means he was
running the odds.</i>

1287
00:53:34,395 --> 00:53:36,239
-Five thousand to call.
-Nope.

1288
00:53:36,372 --> 00:53:38,528
<i>In other words,
he was playing poker</i>

1289
00:53:38,553 --> 00:53:40,317
<i>and the others were gambling.</i>

1290
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:44,031
<i>And he won.</i>

1291
00:53:45,435 --> 00:53:49,349
<i>By midnight, Harlan had tripled
his original $50,000 buy-in</i>

1292
00:53:49,937 --> 00:53:52,413
<i>but everything came off
the rails with one hand.</i>

1293
00:53:52,843 --> 00:53:54,226
<i>And that's how it happens.</i>

1294
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,007
<i>That's how you go full tilt.</i>

1295
00:53:56,508 --> 00:53:58,804
<i>Harlan, the best
player at the table,</i>

1296
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:00,609
<i>the best player at most tables,</i>

1297
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:04,008
<i>was about to get bluffed off
the win by, of all people,</i>

1298
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:05,719
<i>Bad Brad.</i>

1299
00:54:06,132 --> 00:54:07,156
<i>How?</i>

1300
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:09,866
<i>Because Harlan had never
played with Brad before</i>

1301
00:54:09,984 --> 00:54:13,140
<i>and didn't know yet
that Brad was bad.</i>

1302
00:54:13,538 --> 00:54:16,202
<i>Harlan's got a boat, nine's full.</i>

1303
00:54:16,902 --> 00:54:18,160
<i>Brad's got nothing</i>

1304
00:54:18,363 --> 00:54:20,167
<i>but his pre-flop
betting made it look,</i>

1305
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:22,246
<i>entirely accidentally,</i>

1306
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:24,106
<i>like there was a chance
he had pocket kings,</i>

1307
00:54:24,146 --> 00:54:25,115
20 thousand.

1308
00:54:25,185 --> 00:54:27,920
<i>which, if true, would give
him the better full house.</i>

1309
00:54:29,154 --> 00:54:32,052
<i>Brad's counting off 20 thousand
which means he's gonna call</i>

1310
00:54:32,107 --> 00:54:34,997
<i>and Harlan knows that if Brad's
gonna call and not raise</i>

1311
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,622
<i>it means he didn't have the boat</i>

1312
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:39,677
<i>and he's betting a high two-pair,
probably kings and queens.</i>

1313
00:54:40,466 --> 00:54:42,216
<i>But then instead of
calling the bet,</i>

1314
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:44,505
<i>Brad pushes 72 thousand
dollars into the pot.</i>

1315
00:54:44,568 --> 00:54:45,763
I'm all in.

1316
00:54:47,122 --> 00:54:48,567
<i>Harlan looks a Brad.</i>

1317
00:54:48,812 --> 00:54:50,694
<i>Every tell Harlan knows about,</i>

1318
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:53,327
<i>carotid artery pumping,
stiff hands,</i>

1319
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:54,960
<i>Brad's doing the opposite.</i>

1320
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:57,405
<i>Brad's betting had
represented a huge hand</i>

1321
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,492
<i>by calling on the flop,</i>

1322
00:54:58,517 --> 00:55:01,156
<i>check-raising the turn
and bombing the river.</i>

1323
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:03,749
<i>Of course, Harlan didn't
know that Brad didn't know</i>

1324
00:55:03,789 --> 00:55:05,140
<i>what any of that meant.</i>

1325
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,778
<i>So Harlan, always
a good sport, said,</i>

1326
00:55:07,855 --> 00:55:10,254
Nice bet. I'm laying this down.

1327
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:12,502
<i>as he tossed in what
he didn't realize</i>

1328
00:55:12,527 --> 00:55:14,284
<i>was the winning hand.</i>

1329
00:55:14,415 --> 00:55:16,197
<i>Brad tosses in his cards too</i>

1330
00:55:16,283 --> 00:55:18,501
<i>and one of them flips
over and Harlan sees...</i>

1331
00:55:18,564 --> 00:55:20,345
You didn't have pocket kings?

1332
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:23,587
I didn't have any kings.
Except the one in the middle.

1333
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,791
You had two pair?

1334
00:55:25,846 --> 00:55:27,236
I had one pair,

1335
00:55:27,674 --> 00:55:29,228
the nines in the middle.

1336
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:35,979
Harlan, what are
you thinking, man?

1337
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,557
Thank you.

1338
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:43,214
<i>It wasn't even that
it that much money.</i>

1339
00:55:43,392 --> 00:55:45,970
<i>Harlan only lost about
$40,000 on the hand.</i>

1340
00:55:46,314 --> 00:55:49,595
<i>But a circuit breaker blew and
Harlan was out for blood now.</i>

1341
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:51,157
<i>Everyone's.</i>

1342
00:55:52,275 --> 00:55:55,579
You have 112,000 on the table,
you want another 50?

1343
00:55:56,056 --> 00:55:57,525
Give me another hundred, please.

1344
00:56:00,722 --> 00:56:02,370
Sign here for 100,000.

1345
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:05,366
<i>By 5 a.m. Harlan was
down half a million.</i>

1346
00:56:05,444 --> 00:56:07,155
<i>He'd abandoned everything
he knew about poker</i>

1347
00:56:07,265 --> 00:56:08,975
<i>and was playing like a frat kid,</i>

1348
00:56:09,147 --> 00:56:11,257
<i>swinging for a home run
on every hand.</i>

1349
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:14,936
Another hundred, please.

1350
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,421
-Hey, bud--
-Molly.

1351
00:56:16,452 --> 00:56:17,897
Please. Let's go.

1352
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:20,905
Sign here for a hundred.

1353
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:30,785
Six a.m.

1354
00:56:30,818 --> 00:56:31,753
<i>Text messages
were going out</i>

1355
00:56:31,778 --> 00:56:34,177
<i>letting everyone know
Harlan was bleeding.</i>

1356
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:37,308
<i>Guys were coming by to play for
a couple of hours before work.</i>

1357
00:56:37,426 --> 00:56:39,239
<i>They'd been losing
to him for months.</i>

1358
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,518
<i>Everyone wanted a check
from Harlan Eustice.</i>

1359
00:56:41,806 --> 00:56:42,806
If you go home now,
you can have

1360
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:45,063
a few hours of sleep
before Sheila's party.

1361
00:56:45,088 --> 00:56:46,127
Soon.

1362
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:48,908
Come talk to me.

1363
00:56:49,445 --> 00:56:51,406
Hi, guys, help yourselves
to some coffee.

1364
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:57,330
You're on tilt.

1365
00:56:57,924 --> 00:56:59,260
Everybody knows it.

1366
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,487
You're playing without the
weapons you need to win.

1367
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:03,443
You're right.

1368
00:57:04,662 --> 00:57:06,365
All right, thank you.

1369
00:57:06,693 --> 00:57:08,311
Just give me 500,000.

1370
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,959
I just gotta get back to even.

1371
00:57:11,984 --> 00:57:14,561
<i>That should be the second
line of every gambler's obit.</i>

1372
00:57:14,802 --> 00:57:17,864
<i>"Mr. Feldstein died while
trying to get back to even."</i>

1373
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,739
<i>Harlan never did.</i>

1374
00:57:19,764 --> 00:57:22,243
<i>And he never got to his
wife's birthday party.</i>

1375
00:57:22,384 --> 00:57:24,275
<i>She filed for divorce
two days later.</i>

1376
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:26,772
<i>There was one last punch coming</i>

1377
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,366
<i>that would put Harlan
on the floor for good.</i>

1378
00:57:30,771 --> 00:57:32,802
<i>Harlan was heads-up against
a guy named Frederick</i>

1379
00:57:32,842 --> 00:57:34,623
<i>who was Austrian royalty.</i>

1380
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:37,705
Go.

1381
00:57:37,736 --> 00:57:39,205
<i>Harlan had pocket queens.</i>

1382
00:57:39,517 --> 00:57:41,783
<i>His Excellency had ace-king.</i>

1383
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,338
<i>They were both in 65K pre-flop.</i>

1384
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:46,487
<i>Flop's queen-seven-seven.</i>

1385
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,237
<i>Harlan has a full-house again,</i>

1386
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:49,432
<i>queens full of sevens,</i>

1387
00:57:49,457 --> 00:57:51,362
<i>with three rounds of
betting in front of him.</i>

1388
00:57:52,266 --> 00:57:54,023
<i>The Count has nothing.</i>

1389
00:57:57,251 --> 00:57:57,970
All in.

1390
00:57:57,995 --> 00:57:59,595
<i>And the Count goes all in.</i>

1391
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,576
<i>He wants Harlan to think he's got
two more sevens under there.</i>

1392
00:58:02,601 --> 00:58:03,099
Call.

1393
00:58:03,124 --> 00:58:05,467
<i>Nope, says Harlan, he's not
falling for this again</i>

1394
00:58:05,492 --> 00:58:07,342
<i>and he snap calls all in.</i>

1395
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:10,407
<i>There's $750,000 on the table.</i>

1396
00:58:11,615 --> 00:58:13,552
<i>Diego burns a card
and deals the turn.</i>

1397
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:16,122
<i>A king.</i>

1398
00:58:16,365 --> 00:58:18,654
<i>Otto von Bismarck
now has two pair,</i>

1399
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,568
kings and sevens,

1400
00:58:20,683 --> 00:58:22,918
<i>but two-pair's nothing
next to a full house.</i>

1401
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:24,246
<i>And at this point,</i>

1402
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:27,183
<i>the only hand left that can
beat a queen full house,</i>

1403
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,285
<i>is a king full house.</i>

1404
00:58:32,085 --> 00:58:33,788
<i>Captain Von Trapp</i>
-All right.

1405
00:58:33,813 --> 00:58:35,156
<i>bluffed two pair</i>

1406
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:37,515
<i>and rivered into kings full.</i>

1407
00:58:38,472 --> 00:58:39,707
Motherfucker!

1408
00:58:40,074 --> 00:58:41,471
Motherfucker!

1409
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:43,128
Fuck you,
you fucking mechanic!

1410
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:43,768
Hey!

1411
00:58:43,793 --> 00:58:46,104
Fuck you! You bottom-dealing
party magician!

1412
00:58:46,129 --> 00:58:46,783
Hey!

1413
00:58:46,808 --> 00:58:47,456
Get out on the terrace.

1414
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:48,987
You've been pullin' this
shit on me for two days!

1415
00:58:49,043 --> 00:58:50,082
Come on! Come on!

1416
00:58:50,107 --> 00:58:51,342
Party magician.

1417
00:58:53,423 --> 00:58:55,118
-You good?
-I'm good, thanks.

1418
00:59:00,931 --> 00:59:02,040
What the hell?

1419
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:04,790
I'll apologize to Diego.

1420
00:59:05,267 --> 00:59:06,025
Yeah.

1421
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:08,939
And you're gonna go home.
I'm making a floor call, that's it.

1422
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:11,902
Did you hear me?

1423
00:59:13,058 --> 00:59:14,191
I don't have it.

1424
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,785
A million two.

1425
00:59:20,878 --> 00:59:21,917
I don't have it.

1426
00:59:25,617 --> 00:59:26,797
I'm sorry.

1427
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:35,806
Go home.

1428
00:59:38,384 --> 00:59:39,454
I'm very sorry.

1429
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:44,790
You gotta tell Sheila
the truth, okay?

1430
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:49,013
Tell her the truth.
Tell her what happened.

1431
00:59:49,895 --> 00:59:51,895
I'm gonna help you,
I'm gonna get you to a meeting.

1432
00:59:53,501 --> 00:59:54,954
We'll meet tomorrow and

1433
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:57,423
figure out what to
do about the money.

1434
01:00:11,506 --> 01:00:13,412
<i>Harlan and I didn't
meet the next day.</i>

1435
01:00:13,498 --> 01:00:15,338
<i>He just called me and
said everything was okay</i>

1436
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:17,103
<i>and showed up the next
week with a bank check</i>

1437
01:00:17,128 --> 01:00:19,049
<i>for a million two hundred
thousand dollars.</i>

1438
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:21,120
Where'd he get the money from?

1439
01:00:21,704 --> 01:00:22,915
I loaned it to him.

1440
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:23,868
Loaned it?

1441
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:25,789
I get 50% of his wins
until the debt's paid off

1442
01:00:25,814 --> 01:00:28,766
and then 50% for the next
two years with no exposure.

1443
01:00:29,299 --> 01:00:32,965
You're getting 50% of the wins
and no exposure on the losses?

1444
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:34,199
Yeah.

1445
01:00:34,224 --> 01:00:35,466
First of all, he'll never
climb out of that,

1446
01:00:35,497 --> 01:00:37,004
that's sharecropper math.

1447
01:00:37,652 --> 01:00:40,331
It's also usury,
it's racketeering.

1448
01:00:40,418 --> 01:00:42,292
Second, you can't
stake a player

1449
01:00:42,317 --> 01:00:43,996
and play in a game
at the same time.

1450
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:45,605
I've been doing it for two years.

1451
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:48,941
-You've been staking Harlan?
-Yeah.

1452
01:00:50,457 --> 01:00:52,629
-Jesus Christ.
-It's not cheating.

1453
01:00:53,074 --> 01:00:54,558
It creates the opportunity for it.

1454
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:55,558
Tell me how.

1455
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:56,660
-Are you kidding me?
-Tell me how.

1456
01:00:56,685 --> 01:00:58,052
If you have an interest in
another player winning?

1457
01:00:58,077 --> 01:00:59,269
You think I'm gonna
take a dive?

1458
01:00:59,294 --> 01:01:00,762
And if I did,
who would care?

1459
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:04,060
You fold your hole cards,
five of clubs, jack of hearts,

1460
01:01:04,085 --> 01:01:05,089
he's still in the game.

1461
01:01:05,114 --> 01:01:06,473
It would benefit him to know

1462
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:08,475
-that the five of clubs--
-You think I'm signaling him?

1463
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,717
I'm saying it can't
fucking happen again.

1464
01:01:17,178 --> 01:01:19,100
You disapprove of me.

1465
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:21,803
It's not personal.

1466
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:22,826
It feels personal
when you chat up

1467
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:24,654
every other guy at
the game except me.

1468
01:01:24,772 --> 01:01:27,038
When you stay late for a
drink with JT but never--

1469
01:01:27,132 --> 01:01:28,593
Have you visited his Oscar?

1470
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,382
I think it's bolted on
the hood of his car.

1471
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:31,989
It's noticeable

1472
01:01:32,278 --> 01:01:33,832
when you go out of your
way to demonstrate

1473
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:34,880
that you have
no interest in me.

1474
01:01:34,944 --> 01:01:36,497
You did the
same thing to Dean.

1475
01:01:36,778 --> 01:01:39,044
These guys wanna play
cards with me, not you.

1476
01:01:39,114 --> 01:01:40,333
Be that as it may--

1477
01:01:40,358 --> 01:01:41,873
You know who the biggest
winner in this game is?

1478
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:42,795
It's you.

1479
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,131
You know who he second
biggest winner is?

1480
01:01:44,156 --> 01:01:45,683
-Look--
-It's you.

1481
01:01:47,035 --> 01:01:49,301
What are you taking home,
ten thousand a night now?

1482
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,324
That is my business, literally.

1483
01:01:51,402 --> 01:01:53,425
Between you, the dealers,
and the servers,

1484
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,160
you're taking a lot of money
out of this game.

1485
01:01:55,185 --> 01:01:56,664
Not as much as
I'm bringing to it.

1486
01:01:56,689 --> 01:01:59,335
That 10,000 is 10,000 that
doesn't go in my pocket.

1487
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,113
Again, my money--

1488
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:02,714
Your money is my money.

1489
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,691
Is it?

1490
01:02:05,636 --> 01:02:07,508
I think we should talk
about capping your tips.

1491
01:02:11,204 --> 01:02:12,532
You want to get together
with the other players,

1492
01:02:12,557 --> 01:02:16,071
who on my tax return
are called clients,

1493
01:02:16,303 --> 01:02:18,240
and discuss putting a
ceiling on my wages?

1494
01:02:18,373 --> 01:02:19,631
That's right.

1495
01:02:20,545 --> 01:02:23,608
It'll be America's most
closely-watched anti-trust case.

1496
01:02:25,611 --> 01:02:28,424
<i>Right there, right then,
that fast,</i>

1497
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:29,939
<i>I lost the game.</i>

1498
01:02:30,424 --> 01:02:32,799
<i>It was the next Tuesday,
game night.</i>

1499
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:35,366
<i>He waited until he knew I'd
be on the way to the hotel</i>

1500
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:37,164
<i>and then sent me a text.</i>

1501
01:02:42,281 --> 01:02:44,429
<i>It said, "We're playing
at Dave's tonight."</i>

1502
01:02:44,454 --> 01:02:45,813
<i>"No need to show up."</i>

1503
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:46,901
<i>And I knew the truth
even before</i>

1504
01:02:46,926 --> 01:02:48,729
<i>I answered the call
that came next.</i>

1505
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:57,159
<i>You are so fucked.</i>

1506
01:03:11,481 --> 01:03:13,356
There's no such word
as verticality.

1507
01:03:13,512 --> 01:03:14,325
Hmm?

1508
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,512
In the book, on page 152,
when you lose the game in L.A.

1509
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:20,778
and you come to New York,
you admire the city's verticality.

1510
01:03:20,803 --> 01:03:21,693
It's a word.

1511
01:03:21,749 --> 01:03:23,061
Once you're in New York,

1512
01:03:23,086 --> 01:03:26,091
you talk about games
lasting all night, two nights,

1513
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:28,966
being up for days, but
you don't mention drugs.

1514
01:03:29,787 --> 01:03:31,287
There were drugs.
I'm two years clean.

1515
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,666
You left the drugs
out of the book.

1516
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:34,901
You know what, I'm not
paying you $250,000

1517
01:03:34,926 --> 01:03:36,339
for your Amazon
customer review.

1518
01:03:36,364 --> 01:03:38,215
So far, you're not
paying me for anything.

1519
01:03:38,308 --> 01:03:41,731
I just e-mailed you verticality from
Merriam-Webster's Dictionary.

1520
01:03:42,543 --> 01:03:44,309
What's an advance
on a book like this?

1521
01:03:46,074 --> 01:03:47,035
The advance?

1522
01:03:50,153 --> 01:03:51,293
It depends.

1523
01:03:51,434 --> 01:03:53,848
If you guarantee the
publishers certain elements,

1524
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:55,606
then I can get you a
million and a half

1525
01:03:55,895 --> 01:03:58,457
which you'll probably double in
sales plus ancillary rights.

1526
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:59,910
What kind of elements?

1527
01:04:00,074 --> 01:04:01,629
You have to use real names.

1528
01:04:02,483 --> 01:04:03,358
Eli.

1529
01:04:03,383 --> 01:04:06,467
There's a guy who sits outside
my Starbucks with a uh

1530
01:04:06,662 --> 01:04:09,326
with a cardboard sign that says,
"Vietnam Vet"

1531
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,209
and every morning
I give him a quarter

1532
01:04:11,272 --> 01:04:14,194
and right now the only
difference between you and him

1533
01:04:14,219 --> 01:04:15,944
is that you have a story.

1534
01:04:15,994 --> 01:04:17,384
I'm one thousand percent sure

1535
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:19,572
that the homeless Vietnam
vet has a better one.

1536
01:04:19,668 --> 01:04:21,105
You have one asset.

1537
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:22,909
Write your story
and I can get you

1538
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,074
a million and a half
and-and that's the floor.

1539
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,254
Go big or go home and
live with your mother.

1540
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:29,715
For the rest of your life.

1541
01:04:33,406 --> 01:04:34,640
What if I...

1542
01:04:37,601 --> 01:04:40,194
What if I told the
publishers that I would...

1543
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:42,975
name the players who are
already named

1544
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,718
in the Brad Marion
deposition?

1545
01:04:44,843 --> 01:04:45,890
All four?

1546
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:50,281
I'll use the real names of the
players who are already named

1547
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,914
by Bad Brad, what if
I told them that?

1548
01:04:51,939 --> 01:04:53,048
You spent eight years
in Hollywood

1549
01:04:53,072 --> 01:04:54,617
and two years in New York
running the world's

1550
01:04:54,651 --> 01:04:57,997
most exclusive, glamorous,
and decadent man-cave.

1551
01:04:58,022 --> 01:04:59,200
So what do the publishers
get from you

1552
01:04:59,225 --> 01:05:00,889
about people with real names?

1553
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,755
My advance was $35,000.

1554
01:05:07,364 --> 01:05:10,419
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do
is get you a minor role reduction,

1555
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:12,036
get the 12 points
knocked down to 10.

1556
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:13,403
What's a minor role reduction?

1557
01:05:13,428 --> 01:05:15,382
I'm gonna argue to the
prosecutor that you were uh,

1558
01:05:15,414 --> 01:05:18,091
an employee that was hired
and fired by the players.

1559
01:05:18,154 --> 01:05:19,193
Not a chance.

1560
01:05:19,342 --> 01:05:20,444
I think we got a good chance.

1561
01:05:20,469 --> 01:05:21,991
No, not a chance I'm letting
make that argument.

1562
01:05:22,016 --> 01:05:23,725
-Why not?
-It's not true.

1563
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,971
Let me explain how the
point system works.

1564
01:05:25,996 --> 01:05:27,119
I know how it works.

1565
01:05:27,198 --> 01:05:29,047
Points correspond
with the prosecutor's

1566
01:05:29,072 --> 01:05:30,735
sentencing recommendation.

1567
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:33,164
You try to get a point reduction
based on a variety of factors

1568
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:35,117
including, say, prior
criminal history

1569
01:05:35,142 --> 01:05:36,485
which I don't have,

1570
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,375
or whether the defendant
played a minor role

1571
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,445
which I certainly did not.

1572
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:41,148
You really think this is a
good time to hog credit?

1573
01:05:41,173 --> 01:05:42,055
I built it from scratch.

1574
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,353
No, there was already a
game at the Cobra Lounge

1575
01:05:43,378 --> 01:05:44,549
when you came along.

1576
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:47,627
The New York game is what I'm talking
about, I built from scratch.

1577
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,878
I wasn't fireable,
I made sure of that. So no.

1578
01:05:52,429 --> 01:05:53,507
I wasn't really listening.

1579
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,971
I'm refusing you permission

1580
01:05:54,996 --> 01:05:56,549
to seek a minor role reduction.

1581
01:05:56,574 --> 01:05:59,440
I'm refusing you permission to
invalidate my entire career.

1582
01:05:59,465 --> 01:06:00,331
And I'm not caring.

1583
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:01,476
I built a successful--

1584
01:06:01,531 --> 01:06:02,835
Hey, do you want kids?

1585
01:06:05,052 --> 01:06:06,700
You interested in
having a family?

1586
01:06:07,783 --> 01:06:08,580
Very much.

1587
01:06:08,627 --> 01:06:09,931
I don't get you some
point reductions

1588
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,587
and the sentencing
recommendation guidelines

1589
01:06:11,628 --> 01:06:13,672
say 8 to 12 years
and that's before

1590
01:06:13,697 --> 01:06:15,947
they try to jam you up
more for money laundering.

1591
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,762
-Money laundering? Are you--
-The moment you changed...

1592
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:18,723
the Russians' money for chips.

1593
01:06:18,748 --> 01:06:19,943
I would've had to
have been aware

1594
01:06:19,968 --> 01:06:21,591
-where the money was--
-Find me 12 men and women

1595
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:23,806
who'll believe that you
weren't aware of exactly

1596
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:26,042
who was sitting at your table and
where their money came from.

1597
01:06:26,089 --> 01:06:27,690
So, that's it.

1598
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:29,870
You were a cocktail waitress.

1599
01:06:34,934 --> 01:06:38,309
<i>When I lost the L.A. game,
I told myself it was no big deal.</i>

1600
01:06:39,277 --> 01:06:41,254
<i>It was just supposed
to be an adventure</i>

1601
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,272
<i>and a way to meet
influential people.</i>

1602
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,675
<i>And I'd saved over $200,000.</i>

1603
01:06:50,056 --> 01:06:52,626
<i>But that was just a weak
firewall I'd hastily built</i>

1604
01:06:52,681 --> 01:06:54,868
<i>to keep out the humiliation
and depression</i>

1605
01:06:54,954 --> 01:06:56,236
<i>I knew was coming.</i>

1606
01:07:00,332 --> 01:07:01,817
<i>It had to end sometime.</i>

1607
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,477
<i>I just thought it
would be on my time.</i>

1608
01:07:07,102 --> 01:07:09,329
<i>The game had given
me an identity,</i>

1609
01:07:09,594 --> 01:07:10,657
<i>respect,</i>

1610
01:07:10,953 --> 01:07:12,460
<i>and a defined place</i>

1611
01:07:12,586 --> 01:07:14,820
<i>in a world that was inaccessible</i>

1612
01:07:15,354 --> 01:07:18,447
<i>and in one irrational heartbeat
it was taken away.</i>

1613
01:07:20,943 --> 01:07:22,349
<i>I was irrelevant</i>

1614
01:07:23,091 --> 01:07:25,216
<i>and forgotten overnight.</i>

1615
01:07:28,765 --> 01:07:31,125
<i>It'd been two weeks
since I lost the game</i>

1616
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,773
<i>and I made an appointment
to see someone</i>

1617
01:07:33,844 --> 01:07:36,093
<i>because now the humiliation
and depression</i>

1618
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:39,824
<i>had given way to blinding
anger at my powerlessness</i>

1619
01:07:39,864 --> 01:07:42,379
<i>over the unfair whims of men.</i>

1620
01:07:44,619 --> 01:07:46,666
<i>It was that there
weren't any rules.</i>

1621
01:07:47,002 --> 01:07:50,135
<i>These power moves weren't
framed by right and wrong,</i>

1622
01:07:50,252 --> 01:07:52,213
<i>just ego and vanity.</i>

1623
01:07:52,517 --> 01:07:55,017
<i>Selfish whims with no
regard for consequence.</i>

1624
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:56,978
<i>No fairness, no justice.</i>

1625
01:07:57,037 --> 01:08:00,084
<i>And that giggling, cackling
call from Player X.</i>

1626
01:08:00,154 --> 01:08:01,365
<i>You are so fucked.</i>

1627
01:08:01,436 --> 01:08:03,498
<i>I couldn't lose to that
green-screened little shit</i>

1628
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:06,514
<i>and I didn't want a therapist
to make me feel okay about it.</i>

1629
01:08:07,285 --> 01:08:09,503
<i>You know what makes me
feel okay about losing?</i>

1630
01:08:10,324 --> 01:08:11,582
<i>Winning.</i>

1631
01:08:12,077 --> 01:08:13,725
<i>I got on a plane to New York.</i>

1632
01:08:16,537 --> 01:08:18,701
<i>Wall Street, Madison Avenue,</i>

1633
01:08:18,874 --> 01:08:22,366
<i>Fifth Avenue, the Dakota,
the San Remo...</i>

1634
01:08:22,491 --> 01:08:25,390
<i>the players were here,
I just had to bait the hook.</i>

1635
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,283
<i>This time, I didn't
have movie stars.</i>

1636
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,869
<i>This time, I used
Playboy Playmates.</i>

1637
01:08:31,996 --> 01:08:34,238
<i>These weren't just any Playmates.</i>

1638
01:08:34,554 --> 01:08:36,421
<i>Jesse was a
Puerto Rican knockout</i>

1639
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,031
<i>who grew up working
in card rooms</i>

1640
01:08:38,056 --> 01:08:39,742
<i>and was a
good player herself.</i>

1641
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:42,554
<i>I could stake her,
infiltrate other games</i>

1642
01:08:42,579 --> 01:08:43,780
<i>and poach their
big-ticket players.</i>

1643
01:08:43,805 --> 01:08:45,098
You ready to make some money?

1644
01:08:45,123 --> 01:08:46,570
<i>Shelby could write code</i>

1645
01:08:46,608 --> 01:08:49,247
<i>and run more thorough
background checks than the TSA.</i>

1646
01:08:49,288 --> 01:08:50,858
Here's your account
at Citibank.

1647
01:08:50,952 --> 01:08:53,663
<i>Winston was the daughter
of an American diplomat.</i>

1648
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:55,324
<i>She's lived in nine
different countries</i>

1649
01:08:55,349 --> 01:08:58,801
<i>and had the e-mail addresses
of half the Saudi royal family.</i>

1650
01:08:59,592 --> 01:09:01,397
Who's the biggest
game in Manhattan?

1651
01:09:01,445 --> 01:09:04,840
On any given night, it's either
Teddy Chin or Tooty Tiscano.

1652
01:09:04,865 --> 01:09:07,083
-But that's Manhattan.
-What do you mean?

1653
01:09:07,108 --> 01:09:09,141
The biggest game in New
York is in Brooklyn.

1654
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:11,500
Russian Jews.
Buy-in's 100K.

1655
01:09:11,525 --> 01:09:14,165
No one runs the game,
they just play and pay.

1656
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,611
<i>We couldn't promise anyone they'd
rub elbows with movie stars.</i>

1657
01:09:17,775 --> 01:09:20,197
<i>But New York has one thing
Hollywood doesn't.</i>

1658
01:09:20,345 --> 01:09:21,583
<i>The Yankees.</i>

1659
01:09:21,698 --> 01:09:23,169
<i>And there was one
Yankee in particular</i>

1660
01:09:23,194 --> 01:09:25,834
<i>that every man in America
would line up to lose to.</i>

1661
01:09:25,909 --> 01:09:27,214
Don't say his name out loud.

1662
01:09:27,308 --> 01:09:30,277
Write it on a cocktail napkin,
crumple the napkin up,

1663
01:09:30,323 --> 01:09:33,354
put it in a glass of water
so they can see the ink dissolve.

1664
01:09:33,418 --> 01:09:35,707
-That's really necessary?
-No, it's not at all necessary.

1665
01:09:35,864 --> 01:09:37,981
When do we tell them
the game's gonna start?

1666
01:09:38,264 --> 01:09:40,810
Tell them it's been
happening once a week for

1667
01:09:40,835 --> 01:09:43,857
about six months at a location
you won't disclose right now.

1668
01:09:43,996 --> 01:09:46,246
There's a pretty long waiting
list for a chair but

1669
01:09:46,339 --> 01:09:48,628
Molly's... here somewhere and

1670
01:09:48,653 --> 01:09:49,917
I'll introduce you to her.

1671
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:52,328
50K buy-in,
blinds are five and one?

1672
01:09:52,422 --> 01:09:54,539
Yeah, fifty...

1673
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:58,679
Mol?

1674
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:00,102
50K buy-in?

1675
01:10:00,258 --> 01:10:00,992
No.

1676
01:10:01,109 --> 01:10:03,117
Two hundred and fifty.

1677
01:10:03,529 --> 01:10:04,998
That's gonna make noise.

1678
01:10:05,123 --> 01:10:07,505
Enough to be heard
on Rodeo Drive.

1679
01:10:11,869 --> 01:10:14,955
<i>The Gold Coast of Long Island
has been home to the Vanderbilts,</i>

1680
01:10:15,025 --> 01:10:19,150
<i>Roosevelts, Whitneys,
J.P. Morgan, and F.W. Woolworth.</i>

1681
01:10:19,175 --> 01:10:20,718
It's an impossible
ticket to get,

1682
01:10:21,421 --> 01:10:22,675
but I can talk to Molly.

1683
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:24,949
<i>Tonight was a ten-thousand
per person fundraiser</i>

1684
01:10:24,974 --> 01:10:28,128
<i>to pay for major renovations
at the East Hampton Yacht Club.</i>

1685
01:10:28,231 --> 01:10:29,512
Molly's around here somewhere.

1686
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:31,638
I can introduce you but
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

1687
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:32,699
<i>That's for real.</i>

1688
01:10:32,724 --> 01:10:35,184
<i>If there was a charity event
for residents of the Hamptons</i>

1689
01:10:35,209 --> 01:10:36,192
<i>who own yachts,</i>

1690
01:10:36,262 --> 01:10:38,825
<i>in my business, that's called
a target rich environment.</i>

1691
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,556
I have to tell you the
initial buy-in is 250,000.

1692
01:10:41,629 --> 01:10:45,143
250,000, that's almost as
much as my second car.

1693
01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:47,998
Your friends
come to the games?

1694
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:49,310
Mm-hmm.

1695
01:10:49,357 --> 01:10:50,919
<i>It took only seven
weeks of recruiting</i>

1696
01:10:50,944 --> 01:10:53,444
<i>to get ten players and
seven on a waiting list.</i>

1697
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,921
<i>And in these circles,</i>

1698
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:57,718
<i>that was more than enough
to start the mythology.</i>

1699
01:10:58,134 --> 01:11:00,501
<i>By morning, gamblers would
be telling and hearing</i>

1700
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:02,447
<i>stories about this
game in London,</i>

1701
01:11:02,472 --> 01:11:04,115
<i>Tokyo, and Dubai.</i>

1702
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,092
All in.

1703
01:11:05,124 --> 01:11:07,460
<i>At the end of that year,
I reported an income of</i>

1704
01:11:07,485 --> 01:11:11,117
{\an8}<i>four million, seven hundred and
seventy-three thousand dollars.</i>

1705
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:14,306
<i>Every square inch of it legal
and on the books.</i>

1706
01:11:14,384 --> 01:11:16,853
<i>I was the biggest
game runner in the world</i>

1707
01:11:17,275 --> 01:11:18,439
<i>All tips.</i>

1708
01:11:18,634 --> 01:11:20,200
<i>I still hadn't taken a rake.</i>

1709
01:11:20,294 --> 01:11:22,004
<i>And I still hadn't
accidentally recruited</i>

1710
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:24,036
<i>members of a
Russian crime syndicate.</i>

1711
01:11:24,485 --> 01:11:27,188
<i>In the beginning, I was
using drugs to stay awake.</i>

1712
01:11:27,353 --> 01:11:28,438
<i>First Adderall.</i>

1713
01:11:28,603 --> 01:11:31,188
<i>Then Adderall crushed up
to defeat the time release.</i>

1714
01:11:31,483 --> 01:11:35,193
<i>Then coke, Valium, Vicodin,
Percocet, and more Adderall.</i>

1715
01:11:35,345 --> 01:11:36,916
<i>I rented a penthouse apartment</i>

1716
01:11:37,009 --> 01:11:39,470
<i>and installed plasma screens
for the sports bettors.</i>

1717
01:11:39,923 --> 01:11:41,915
<i>I had the lower-stakes
games on Wednesdays,</i>

1718
01:11:41,954 --> 01:11:44,017
<i>Thursdays and Sundays
at my place,</i>

1719
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,478
<i>with Tuesday night at
The Plaza being the big game.</i>

1720
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,743
<i>At seven, the dealers came,
the table was set up and polished</i>

1721
01:11:49,768 --> 01:11:53,267
<i>and ten chairs were placed around it
exactly twelve inches apart.</i>

1722
01:11:53,951 --> 01:11:57,178
<i>I used custom chips and two
dealers who worked an hour on,</i>

1723
01:11:57,233 --> 01:12:00,389
<i>an hour off, with a new crew
coming in after 12 hours.</i>

1724
01:12:01,059 --> 01:12:03,676
<i>Casinos had discovered that
certain scents make people</i>

1725
01:12:03,701 --> 01:12:05,536
<i>more likely to place big bets.</i>

1726
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:08,354
<i>The casinos pump those scents
in through the ventilation.</i>

1727
01:12:08,379 --> 01:12:10,487
<i>I had custom candles made.</i>

1728
01:12:11,646 --> 01:12:14,091
<i>I had been working with
a new dealer named B.</i>

1729
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,310
<i>Not like Beatrice, just the initial.</i>

1730
01:12:17,065 --> 01:12:19,370
<i>She'd been working on trashy
card rooms on the East Side</i>

1731
01:12:19,395 --> 01:12:20,948
<i>and we became friends.</i>

1732
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,214
Tone it down.

1733
01:12:23,527 --> 01:12:25,394
The big players
don't like fast hands.

1734
01:12:28,733 --> 01:12:31,014
Sarcastic dealing.
Cool.

1735
01:12:31,686 --> 01:12:34,577
You've gotta do it.
Not doing it is insanity.

1736
01:12:34,602 --> 01:12:36,358
You must be able to see that.

1737
01:12:36,617 --> 01:12:38,875
You've been stiffed
four or five times.

1738
01:12:38,969 --> 01:12:41,524
You've got hundreds of
thousands on the street,

1739
01:12:41,549 --> 01:12:43,602
That's money you're
never gonna see again.

1740
01:12:44,053 --> 01:12:46,412
<i>B have been suggesting
it for a long time.</i>

1741
01:12:47,343 --> 01:12:48,741
<i>She was suggesting it again</i>

1742
01:12:48,766 --> 01:12:50,413
<i>because of an incident
the week before.</i>

1743
01:12:50,507 --> 01:12:51,741
-Hey, Cole.
-Hey.

1744
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:53,835
-Come on in.
-Thanks. You got my check?

1745
01:12:54,132 --> 01:12:55,335
I do.

1746
01:12:56,187 --> 01:12:57,444
-It's right here.
-Thank you.

1747
01:12:57,546 --> 01:12:59,358
Hey, can I show you
something on TV?

1748
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:01,694
Uh, actually I'm...
kind of a hurry.

1749
01:13:01,757 --> 01:13:03,780
It'll just take a second,
have a seat.

1750
01:13:06,771 --> 01:13:09,037
This is last Tuesday's game.

1751
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,199
Shit, Molly, if the
guys find out that

1752
01:13:11,224 --> 01:13:13,668
you've got cameras on 'em,
they're gonna go nuts.

1753
01:13:14,002 --> 01:13:16,096
Yeah. That's you in
the seventh chair.

1754
01:13:16,121 --> 01:13:17,253
Look at your stack of chips.

1755
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:18,659
I got a cab downstairs, just--

1756
01:13:18,784 --> 01:13:21,861
Look at the time stamp.
1:06 a.m.

1757
01:13:22,221 --> 01:13:23,870
Let's fast forward to 1:07.

1758
01:13:24,018 --> 01:13:26,206
1:07 you lose the hand to Boosty.

1759
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:28,229
-What is this?
-1:08.

1760
01:13:28,379 --> 01:13:31,715
Our sheets say that you didn't
buy in again between 1:06 and 1:08

1761
01:13:31,746 --> 01:13:34,059
but look at that...
your stack's bigger.

1762
01:13:34,098 --> 01:13:36,582
-I can explain, this is just a--
-Okay, let's rewind.

1763
01:13:36,607 --> 01:13:38,365
This screen's got the
dealer changeover

1764
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:40,654
while the same time
on this screen...

1765
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:42,599
aaaand...

1766
01:13:43,358 --> 01:13:44,616
there we are.

1767
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:48,367
This is why I can't reconcile
$57,000 from Tuesday's game.

1768
01:13:48,406 --> 01:13:50,773
A 7-11's got security cameras
on their Slushy machine,

1769
01:13:50,798 --> 01:13:54,687
I've got a million dollars changing
hands every two minutes, imbecile,

1770
01:13:54,712 --> 01:13:56,681
you don't think I've
got eyes on the table?

1771
01:13:59,233 --> 01:14:00,374
Relax.

1772
01:14:03,726 --> 01:14:06,562
-I, uh, I owe people money.
-I know.

1773
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:08,337
Why isn't it coming
from the trust fund?

1774
01:14:08,362 --> 01:14:10,618
I need my parents'
permission to get that much.

1775
01:14:11,301 --> 01:14:13,395
And they'd kill me. You don't
even understand what it's like.

1776
01:14:13,463 --> 01:14:15,286
People just don't realize
trust fund kids are

1777
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,812
suffering in this economy too.

1778
01:14:16,837 --> 01:14:18,172
I realize what I did was wrong.

1779
01:14:18,197 --> 01:14:20,070
Did it take a lot of soul
searching to get you there?

1780
01:14:20,102 --> 01:14:22,151
-I meant that--
-Okay, first of all,

1781
01:14:22,223 --> 01:14:23,496
the guys that are making
the counterfeit chips

1782
01:14:23,521 --> 01:14:24,832
are taking you for a ride.

1783
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:26,980
They know that there are
signatures built in the chips,

1784
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:29,637
exact weight, infrared markings--

1785
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,746
Breathe. Second,

1786
01:14:31,819 --> 01:14:33,576
don't try this at
anyone else's game

1787
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:35,522
because if you do, they're
gonna express their anger

1788
01:14:35,547 --> 01:14:37,570
in a much different
way than I am.

1789
01:14:37,617 --> 01:14:40,281
You owe me $57,000,
when I get it

1790
01:14:40,336 --> 01:14:42,172
you get the tape,
but until then

1791
01:14:42,234 --> 01:14:44,461
you don't play in
anyone's game.

1792
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:47,281
<i>So when Tuesday night came,
B was at it again.</i>

1793
01:14:47,342 --> 01:14:51,014
Your exposure's crazy.
It's not if, it's when.

1794
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,814
You're gonna get blown up.

1795
01:14:53,314 --> 01:14:55,181
Your risk is nuts.

1796
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:58,239
If I took a rake, this game
would no longer be legal.

1797
01:14:58,281 --> 01:15:01,656
And if you can't cover,
this game will no longer exist.

1798
01:15:01,992 --> 01:15:03,391
You're the bank now.

1799
01:15:03,953 --> 01:15:05,836
You're guaranteeing the game.

1800
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,788
If you see a hand
you don't want to carry,

1801
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:13,475
just look at me,

1802
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,069
flash me a number,

1803
01:15:15,358 --> 01:15:16,967
and I'll take it off the table.

1804
01:15:18,704 --> 01:15:21,149
Most runners cap it
at five percent.

1805
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:25,079
-I'll see you out there.
-See you out there.

1806
01:15:43,631 --> 01:15:45,310
<i>Two weeks later around 2 a.m.</i>

1807
01:15:45,335 --> 01:15:48,217
<i>there was a pot that was
up to 1.3 million pre-flop</i>

1808
01:15:48,242 --> 01:15:48,725
Call.

1809
01:15:48,787 --> 01:15:50,389
<i>with five players still in.</i>

1810
01:15:51,778 --> 01:15:54,403
<i>My hope was that the flop
would chase four of them off</i>

1811
01:15:55,606 --> 01:15:56,692
200,000.

1812
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,763
Raise 100,000.

1813
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,316
300,000 to you, sir.

1814
01:16:03,341 --> 01:16:04,293
Call.

1815
01:16:05,177 --> 01:16:08,115
<i>There was now
2.1 million on the table.</i>

1816
01:16:10,633 --> 01:16:12,453
300,000 to you, sir.

1817
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,719
Plus 200.

1818
01:16:15,984 --> 01:16:17,594
<i>2.6 million.</i>

1819
01:16:24,305 --> 01:16:25,711
<i>Three million.</i>

1820
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,786
<i>She was right,</i>

1821
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:30,169
<i>I was extending credit,
big numbers.</i>

1822
01:16:30,194 --> 01:16:33,505
<i>And it's not like Harlan Eustice hadn't
already put the fear of God into me.</i>

1823
01:16:33,987 --> 01:16:37,439
<i>If I couldn't pay, one time,
that'd be the end of the game.</i>

1824
01:16:38,204 --> 01:16:39,603
<i>I was the house.</i>

1825
01:16:43,447 --> 01:16:45,806
<i>That's how quickly
I made the decision.</i>

1826
01:16:45,881 --> 01:16:48,670
<i>And just as quickly, B calculated
two percent of the pot</i>

1827
01:16:48,695 --> 01:16:50,224
<i>and took it off the table.</i>

1828
01:16:52,918 --> 01:16:53,980
<i>That was it.</i>

1829
01:16:54,113 --> 01:16:57,550
<i>I'd just taken a rake,
in violation of U.S. Criminal Code</i>

1830
01:16:57,691 --> 01:16:59,246
<i>1955.</i>

1831
01:17:04,648 --> 01:17:06,773
<i>It's time to introduce
Douglas Downey</i>

1832
01:17:06,812 --> 01:17:08,969
<i>'cause Downey's gonna take us
all the way home.</i>

1833
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:11,410
<i>Downey was a drunk and he'd stay
after the game and hang out</i>

1834
01:17:11,435 --> 01:17:12,832
<i>while I did the books.</i>

1835
01:17:13,699 --> 01:17:15,449
<i>He was hard to understand
when he was drunk</i>

1836
01:17:15,474 --> 01:17:17,075
<i>and his conversation openers
would always sound</i>

1837
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,216
<i>like the title of a
detective novel.</i>

1838
01:17:19,241 --> 01:17:21,326
Victim of circumstance.

1839
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:22,927
Yeah.

1840
01:17:25,864 --> 01:17:27,622
Story of, you know...

1841
01:17:28,653 --> 01:17:31,747
story of my proverbial...
you know...

1842
01:17:36,454 --> 01:17:38,040
-Life?
-life.

1843
01:17:39,356 --> 01:17:41,036
<i>He'd talk about his marriage.</i>

1844
01:17:41,513 --> 01:17:43,755
I married young, Mol.

1845
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:47,274
I married young
and I married dull.

1846
01:17:47,433 --> 01:17:49,901
If I'd been born in Greenwich

1847
01:17:50,519 --> 01:17:51,542
instead of Flushing?

1848
01:17:51,612 --> 01:17:53,214
<i>He talked about wanting
a better life.</i>

1849
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:54,347
New Canaan?

1850
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:55,745
Gone to...

1851
01:17:56,316 --> 01:17:59,073
Rye Country Day, Princeton.

1852
01:18:01,182 --> 01:18:02,487
The life I'd have.

1853
01:18:03,432 --> 01:18:05,049
The wife I'd have.

1854
01:18:05,135 --> 01:18:07,705
-I'd be a playuuuh.
-Hm.

1855
01:18:10,346 --> 01:18:12,018
Victim of circumstance.

1856
01:18:15,651 --> 01:18:18,307
Mol, these are things
I only say to you.

1857
01:18:19,174 --> 01:18:20,190
Good call.

1858
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:22,799
<i>And he'd talk about another
game he played in.</i>

1859
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,653
<i>It was the Brooklyn game.</i>

1860
01:18:24,857 --> 01:18:28,013
<i>The Brighton Beach game where
they played all night and all day.</i>

1861
01:18:28,346 --> 01:18:30,541
<i>The game that was
populated by Russians.</i>

1862
01:18:30,698 --> 01:18:32,893
I'm the only Irish
guy they let play.

1863
01:18:33,896 --> 01:18:37,256
Mol, these are the nicest guys
I've ever met.

1864
01:18:37,631 --> 01:18:40,912
<i>Then one night, Douglas Downey
lost 80,000 at my game</i>

1865
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:42,099
<i>and didn't have it.</i>

1866
01:18:42,256 --> 01:18:43,974
Winston, could I have
the room, please?

1867
01:18:44,084 --> 01:18:44,833
Sure.

1868
01:18:45,381 --> 01:18:47,122
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Mm.

1869
01:18:51,274 --> 01:18:53,360
You won 190,000 last week.

1870
01:18:53,449 --> 01:18:56,261
I owe Teddy Chin and Tooty.

1871
01:18:56,425 --> 01:18:57,238
All right.

1872
01:18:57,315 --> 01:18:59,662
And some sports bets.
I'm a winner.

1873
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,487
Trapped inside the body of a--

1874
01:19:01,515 --> 01:19:02,495
-Stop.
-Yeah.

1875
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:04,831
The Brooklyn game.

1876
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,417
Is everything I've heard true?

1877
01:19:07,638 --> 01:19:08,755
What have you heard?

1878
01:19:09,075 --> 01:19:10,607
The Russians have
deep pockets,

1879
01:19:10,661 --> 01:19:12,528
bad at poker, give action
and pay instantly

1880
01:19:12,615 --> 01:19:13,693
and wear a coat and tie.

1881
01:19:13,795 --> 01:19:15,107
That's all true

1882
01:19:19,871 --> 01:19:21,339
Bring me some of those
players and I'll give you

1883
01:19:21,386 --> 01:19:23,910
a piece of the game until
your 80K's paid down.

1884
01:19:24,265 --> 01:19:26,241
Loser, is what I was gonna say

1885
01:19:26,312 --> 01:19:27,578
Winner trapped inside

1886
01:19:27,603 --> 01:19:29,001
-the body of a
-I know.

1887
01:19:29,026 --> 01:19:29,967
-loser.
-Got it.

1888
01:19:29,992 --> 01:19:31,194
Can you bring me some players?

1889
01:19:31,219 --> 01:19:33,267
I'm the only
Irish guy they let play.

1890
01:19:33,821 --> 01:19:35,774
Do you understand
the deal I'm offering you?

1891
01:19:35,852 --> 01:19:38,508
No, I'm saying this
because you're Irish

1892
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:40,391
and they may not want to
play in your game.

1893
01:19:40,423 --> 01:19:42,633
I'm the only
Irish guy they let play.

1894
01:19:42,718 --> 01:19:43,851
I'm not Irish.

1895
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:48,729
-You're not?
-No.

1896
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:51,594
Molly Bloom?

1897
01:19:51,695 --> 01:19:53,570
You're thinking of the
James Joyce character.

1898
01:19:55,434 --> 01:19:57,286
I always thought you were Irish.

1899
01:19:57,809 --> 01:19:58,473
I'm not.

1900
01:19:58,543 --> 01:19:59,856
Can you bring me some players?

1901
01:19:59,881 --> 01:20:02,200
-Isn't there a famous book?
-Okay, Douglas.

1902
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,231
Focus up. Yes, there's
a book by James Joyce

1903
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:06,482
called <i>Ulysses</i> and there's
a character named Molly Bloom

1904
01:20:06,529 --> 01:20:07,974
and that is why
you think I'm Irish

1905
01:20:07,999 --> 01:20:09,701
but now it's time
to move past that.

1906
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:12,090
Can you bring me some
Brighton Beach players?

1907
01:20:14,797 --> 01:20:16,516
If you're not Irish,
what are you?

1908
01:20:17,305 --> 01:20:18,789
I'm a Russian Jew.

1909
01:20:19,211 --> 01:20:21,437
<i>The next week,
I had some new players.</i>

1910
01:20:21,898 --> 01:20:23,482
<i>Mike was the first
one to arrive.</i>

1911
01:20:23,507 --> 01:20:24,445
Good evening. I'm Jesse.

1912
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:25,280
I'm Mike Davidov.

1913
01:20:25,305 --> 01:20:27,085
<i>Mike owned a chain
of medical clinics</i>

1914
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:29,187
<i>and had already posted
with a wire transfer.</i>

1915
01:20:29,513 --> 01:20:31,052
<i>Next were the Gershen brothers.</i>

1916
01:20:31,365 --> 01:20:32,771
<i>Illya and Alexey.</i>

1917
01:20:32,818 --> 01:20:35,130
<i>They were in the business
of exporting steel to China.</i>

1918
01:20:35,233 --> 01:20:38,780
<i>Alexey brought a quarter of a
million dollars in a backpack.</i>

1919
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:42,871
Mr. Habib, good evening.
I'm Shelby.

1920
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:45,833
I'm Shelly, only one
letter's different.

1921
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,743
Also, I'm a billionaire, I think
I may have seen you naked.

1922
01:20:48,813 --> 01:20:49,727
No.

1923
01:20:49,884 --> 01:20:51,009
You'd remember.

1924
01:20:51,126 --> 01:20:52,727
<i>And then Shelly Habib.</i>

1925
01:20:52,888 --> 01:20:54,692
<i>The Habib family owns
the largest collection</i>

1926
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:56,444
<i>of classical art in the world,</i>

1927
01:20:56,513 --> 01:20:58,193
<i>valued at three billion dollars,</i>

1928
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:00,791
<i>and Shelly runs the Helly
Gallery on Madison Avenue.</i>

1929
01:21:00,816 --> 01:21:03,957
As for tonight, I was not able
to put my hands on cash today

1930
01:21:03,982 --> 01:21:06,506
because I woke up this morning
after the banks have closed.

1931
01:21:06,623 --> 01:21:09,881
So, I'm hoping you'll accept
this as temporary collateral.

1932
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:16,044
That is...
an authentic Monet.

1933
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:17,685
Grabbed it right off the wall.

1934
01:21:18,756 --> 01:21:20,818
You came over here
carrying a Monet.

1935
01:21:21,028 --> 01:21:24,020
I was driven. And I have
security outside the door.

1936
01:21:24,332 --> 01:21:25,176
Okay.

1937
01:21:25,293 --> 01:21:26,926
Shelly, here's what
I need you to do.

1938
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,668
I need you to get this,
what, four--?

1939
01:21:29,693 --> 01:21:30,247
Seven.

1940
01:21:30,325 --> 01:21:32,418
Seven million dollar painting
out of here right now.

1941
01:21:32,443 --> 01:21:34,058
And your, I assume,

1942
01:21:34,094 --> 01:21:35,836
-armed security--
-Sure.

1943
01:21:35,861 --> 01:21:37,153
can't stand
in front of the door.

1944
01:21:37,247 --> 01:21:38,793
Fix this up, come on back

1945
01:21:38,818 --> 01:21:41,278
and I'll extend your credit
tonight up one and a half.

1946
01:21:41,786 --> 01:21:43,528
You're a very beautiful woman.

1947
01:21:43,749 --> 01:21:45,179
Pleas be careful
with the painting.

1948
01:21:45,289 --> 01:21:46,218
Always.

1949
01:21:46,757 --> 01:21:49,632
<i>Mike, Illya, Alexey and Shelly.</i>

1950
01:21:49,657 --> 01:21:51,609
<i>Those were the players
Doug Downey brought me.</i>

1951
01:21:51,717 --> 01:21:53,505
<i>As advertised,
they played loose,</i>

1952
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:55,693
<i>gave action,
lost to the regulars,</i>

1953
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:57,224
<i>and settled right away.</i>

1954
01:21:57,285 --> 01:21:58,449
<i>People have asked,</i>

1955
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,442
<i>"Wasn't there any way to tell
that some of the players</i>

1956
01:22:00,503 --> 01:22:02,880
<i>"at your game are connected
to one of the darkest, deadliest,</i>

1957
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:06,008
<i>and far-reaching organized
crime syndicates in the world?"</i>

1958
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:07,161
<i>No.</i>

1959
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:08,552
<i>There wasn't.</i>

1960
01:22:08,935 --> 01:22:11,279
-I'm gonna go all in.
-Ah!

1961
01:23:08,098 --> 01:23:09,769
I wish I had better news.

1962
01:23:10,621 --> 01:23:13,379
Harrison Wellstone didn't go
for the minor role reduction?

1963
01:23:13,434 --> 01:23:14,230
No.

1964
01:23:14,762 --> 01:23:16,410
He didn't buy that I was
a cocktail waitress?

1965
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:17,894
-No.
-Aw.

1966
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:19,457
Was it because I wasn't?

1967
01:23:19,544 --> 01:23:22,349
Hey, I tried, which is what
you're not paying me to do.

1968
01:23:22,435 --> 01:23:23,364
So what now?

1969
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:24,989
The government is expressing
an interest in you

1970
01:23:25,014 --> 01:23:26,427
being a cooperating witness.

1971
01:23:26,466 --> 01:23:27,850
-You don't say.
-Molly.

1972
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:29,287
Who could have possibly
seen that coming?

1973
01:23:29,312 --> 01:23:30,334
Let's have the conversation.

1974
01:23:30,366 --> 01:23:31,990
It'll be short because
I don't know anything

1975
01:23:32,069 --> 01:23:33,428
-at all that can help them.
-You don't know anything

1976
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:34,537
that can help them
convict the Russians

1977
01:23:34,562 --> 01:23:36,038
but you know things
that can help them.

1978
01:23:36,063 --> 01:23:37,476
Did you know
that 97 percent

1979
01:23:37,556 --> 01:23:39,509
of federal cases
never make it to trial?

1980
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:41,195
Even though the chances
of being convicted

1981
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,071
at trial is a little more
than one in a hundred.

1982
01:23:43,096 --> 01:23:44,564
If you want to go to trial,
that's fine

1983
01:23:44,589 --> 01:23:45,816
but it's gonna cost
you in the area of

1984
01:23:45,841 --> 01:23:47,261
three and a half
million dollars.

1985
01:23:47,286 --> 01:23:48,939
Which the Justice Department
knows I don't have

1986
01:23:48,964 --> 01:23:51,128
because they took all of my
money in a civil forfeiture

1987
01:23:51,153 --> 01:23:52,644
which they can do
without a warrant

1988
01:23:52,675 --> 01:23:55,535
because my property doesn't have
a presumption of innocence.

1989
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,113
Then after I'm
arrested by 17 agents

1990
01:23:58,138 --> 01:24:00,158
holding automatic weapons,
totally necessary

1991
01:24:00,183 --> 01:24:01,920
and not at all meant
to intimidate me,

1992
01:24:01,945 --> 01:24:03,865
I'm given two days
to hire a lawyer

1993
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,849
and appear in a courtroom on
the other side of the country.

1994
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,348
If you are saying that
everything that happens

1995
01:24:07,411 --> 01:24:09,341
from the moment you are
arrested is designed

1996
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:11,755
to persuade you to plead
guilty, you are correct.

1997
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,005
So tell me all the
ways I can help

1998
01:24:13,076 --> 01:24:14,647
'cause I really feel
I owe it to them.

1999
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:16,243
Oh, speaking of owing,

2000
01:24:16,321 --> 01:24:18,704
the IRS put a tax lien on the
money they took from me.

2001
01:24:18,729 --> 01:24:19,735
Are you ki--

2002
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:21,642
All right. None of that matters.

2003
01:24:21,667 --> 01:24:22,989
Taking my money wasn't a tax,

2004
01:24:23,014 --> 01:24:25,020
I also need to
give them my money

2005
01:24:25,045 --> 01:24:26,123
Or they'll take it again.

2006
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,724
-None of that matters.
-It needed to be said.

2007
01:24:27,749 --> 01:24:28,428
Not really.

2008
01:24:28,453 --> 01:24:30,202
So, to be clear, you're not
interested in entering

2009
01:24:30,227 --> 01:24:31,957
a cooperation agreement
with the prosecutors.

2010
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:35,250
If I had testimony that would lead
to the conviction of a bad guy,

2011
01:24:35,275 --> 01:24:37,841
no one would have to coerce
me into cooperating.

2012
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:40,071
But I don't. I have dirt.

2013
01:24:40,151 --> 01:24:41,861
I have dish. I have gossip.

2014
01:24:41,939 --> 01:24:44,689
So my value to the prosecution
is exactly the same

2015
01:24:44,714 --> 01:24:46,017
as it is to Hollywood.

2016
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:49,142
I'm here to ensure the New
York Post covers the trial.

2017
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,409
I'm here to sell tickets.

2018
01:24:50,472 --> 01:24:52,557
Which is nonetheless
value to the prosecution

2019
01:24:52,646 --> 01:24:54,646
so what we do is leverage it

2020
01:24:54,693 --> 01:24:56,630
to get you a favorable
sentencing recommendation

2021
01:24:56,670 --> 01:24:58,287
or, better yet,
complete immunity.

2022
01:24:58,312 --> 01:24:59,037
What?!

2023
01:25:00,013 --> 01:25:01,396
Oh, hey, honey.

2024
01:25:01,521 --> 01:25:03,310
-Hey, Stella.
-Hey.

2025
01:25:04,793 --> 01:25:06,504
What does he have you
doing now?

2026
01:25:06,589 --> 01:25:09,370
An essay on three poems with what
he believes are a common theme.

2027
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,448
Not an essay.
Two paragraphs.

2028
01:25:11,854 --> 01:25:12,963
Which three poems?

2029
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:14,518
"Close", "Rush" and "Walls".

2030
01:25:14,587 --> 01:25:17,399
Oh, I know those.
What's the common theme?

2031
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:18,830
Things with one-word titles.

2032
01:25:18,855 --> 01:25:20,908
Are you sure you’re qualified
to be teaching her poetry?

2033
01:25:20,933 --> 01:25:22,651
Hang on.
And yes.

2034
01:25:22,986 --> 01:25:24,509
Anytime you want to
run away form home,

2035
01:25:24,534 --> 01:25:25,634
you can come live with me.

2036
01:25:25,659 --> 01:25:27,462
Then you discover she
doesn't have a home

2037
01:25:27,487 --> 01:25:29,408
and you come back to me.

2038
01:25:29,628 --> 01:25:31,401
This is good. Great.

2039
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:32,464
Why don't you grab a snack,

2040
01:25:32,489 --> 01:25:34,136
start your homework in
one of the conference rooms.

2041
01:25:34,161 --> 01:25:35,584
Okay, see ya.

2042
01:25:35,623 --> 01:25:37,677
There's no law that says you
can't just hit him in the head.

2043
01:25:37,731 --> 01:25:38,887
There is a law
that says that,

2044
01:25:38,912 --> 01:25:40,286
it's the first thing
I taught her to read.

2045
01:25:40,325 --> 01:25:41,200
Go.

2046
01:25:47,592 --> 01:25:49,553
My father used to
give us extra work.

2047
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:51,751
Can I ask you a question?

2048
01:25:52,509 --> 01:25:53,993
You think I'm too hard on her?

2049
01:25:54,825 --> 01:25:57,786
I met a girl when I first
moved to L.A. she was 22.

2050
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:59,966
Someone arranged
through a third party

2051
01:26:00,005 --> 01:26:01,521
to spend a weekend
with her in London.

2052
01:26:01,546 --> 01:26:02,505
You know what she got?

2053
01:26:02,701 --> 01:26:04,982
For the weekend?
Five grand.

2054
01:26:05,177 --> 01:26:06,052
A bag.

2055
01:26:06,573 --> 01:26:08,174
A Chanel bag she wanted.

2056
01:26:08,362 --> 01:26:10,049
Whatever you're
doing with Stella,

2057
01:26:10,948 --> 01:26:12,104
double it.

2058
01:26:19,745 --> 01:26:21,260
Where's your father in all this?

2059
01:26:23,873 --> 01:26:25,326
You mean physically?

2060
01:26:25,724 --> 01:26:28,442
He's in... Colorado.

2061
01:26:30,872 --> 01:26:32,169
Your parents still together?

2062
01:26:32,483 --> 01:26:33,327
No.

2063
01:26:34,194 --> 01:26:35,554
You and your father close?

2064
01:26:36,535 --> 01:26:37,296
No.

2065
01:26:37,754 --> 01:26:38,941
Was he tough on you?

2066
01:26:40,738 --> 01:26:43,652
You know how many girls at the
Olympics have demanding fathers?

2067
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:44,894
All of them?

2068
01:26:45,105 --> 01:26:46,379
That's right.

2069
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:51,035
I was tough on him.

2070
01:26:51,996 --> 01:26:53,027
What do you mean?

2071
01:26:53,512 --> 01:26:55,340
Mmmmmm...

2072
01:26:56,285 --> 01:26:57,793
I was a brat.

2073
01:27:01,409 --> 01:27:02,714
Fathers don't care.

2074
01:27:05,323 --> 01:27:06,691
I'd start fights with him.

2075
01:27:07,292 --> 01:27:08,292
Why?

2076
01:27:08,581 --> 01:27:10,019
You were lying!

2077
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:12,644
Why would I start
fights with him?

2078
01:27:13,191 --> 01:27:13,964
Yeah.

2079
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,105
I put you through grad school.

2080
01:27:17,501 --> 01:27:19,040
I raised the kids.

2081
01:27:19,212 --> 01:27:21,548
I did every God--everything.

2082
01:27:23,305 --> 01:27:24,009
No.

2083
01:27:24,634 --> 01:27:26,071
No, you listen to me.

2084
01:27:26,204 --> 01:27:27,735
All you do is cheat on me.

2085
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,071
And lie to me.
And lie to the kids.

2086
01:27:31,985 --> 01:27:34,180
You lie to your wife
and you lie to your kids.

2087
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,673
I don't know.

2088
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:42,604
For the record,

2089
01:27:42,969 --> 01:27:44,945
the law, 1955, that I'm
accused of breaking,

2090
01:27:45,065 --> 01:27:48,169
it defines gambling as
betting on games of chance.

2091
01:27:48,466 --> 01:27:49,880
-Yes.
-Poker isn't a game of chance.

2092
01:27:49,935 --> 01:27:51,677
Roulette's a game of chance.

2093
01:27:52,512 --> 01:27:54,191
Poker's a game of skill.

2094
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,410
Still, if I were you--

2095
01:27:56,435 --> 01:27:58,769
I'll tell them anything
they want to know about me.

2096
01:28:00,995 --> 01:28:02,105
About me.

2097
01:28:03,714 --> 01:28:04,605
That's it.

2098
01:28:09,527 --> 01:28:11,417
<i>Remember Bad Brad Marion?</i>

2099
01:28:11,464 --> 01:28:14,307
<i>It turns out his
700 million dollar hedge fund</i>

2100
01:28:14,332 --> 01:28:16,815
<i>wasn't what you would call...
real.</i>

2101
01:28:16,926 --> 01:28:18,363
<i>It was a Ponzi scheme.</i>

2102
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,645
<i>He'd been falsely reporting
profits for years.</i>

2103
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:22,858
<i>He wasn't even
registered with the SEC.</i>

2104
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:25,123
<i>With the money given to him
by friends and family</i>

2105
01:28:25,148 --> 01:28:26,248
<i>and players of the game,</i>

2106
01:28:26,338 --> 01:28:28,322
<i>he bought several
Malibu beach houses,</i>

2107
01:28:28,361 --> 01:28:30,220
<i>an airplane hangar
full of cars,</i>

2108
01:28:30,245 --> 01:28:31,650
<i>another one
with an airplane,</i>

2109
01:28:31,721 --> 01:28:33,041
<i>and the life he wanted.</i>

2110
01:28:33,134 --> 01:28:36,111
<i>When he was arrested,
he had $740 in the bank.</i>

2111
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:39,384
<i>Brad cooperated with the FBI
and gave them hours of testimony</i>

2112
01:28:39,409 --> 01:28:40,908
<i>on a range of subjects,</i>

2113
01:28:40,933 --> 01:28:44,356
<i>including how three years earlier,
he'd lost 5.2 million dollars</i>

2114
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:46,778
<i>in an underground
celebrity poker game</i>

2115
01:28:46,803 --> 01:28:49,073
<i>that was run by a girl
named Molly Bloom.</i>

2116
01:28:49,646 --> 01:28:52,450
<i>His story was that I'd induced him
to play in a high-stakes game.</i>

2117
01:28:52,475 --> 01:28:53,669
I just wanted to introduce
you to Brad Marion.

2118
01:28:53,694 --> 01:28:56,342
<i>And that due to my enabling,
he'd become a gambling addict.</i>

2119
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,999
who made me become
a gambling addict.

2120
01:28:59,024 --> 01:29:00,428
Brad, this game
might not be for you.

2121
01:29:00,474 --> 01:29:02,504
<i>Federal bankruptcy lawyers
were brought in to recover</i>

2122
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:04,825
<i>as much of the boosted
money as they could.</i>

2123
01:29:05,114 --> 01:29:08,153
<i>I was sent a subpoena and
flew out to L.A. to be deposed.</i>

2124
01:29:08,466 --> 01:29:10,207
Can you confirm the
names on the list

2125
01:29:10,232 --> 01:29:12,122
all played poker
with Brad Marion?

2126
01:29:12,286 --> 01:29:14,364
This list was provided
to you by Brad Marion?

2127
01:29:14,389 --> 01:29:16,076
I just need you to
confirm for the record

2128
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:18,381
that your game included but was
not limited to the players on this list.

2129
01:29:18,406 --> 01:29:20,179
I understand. What I'm
trying to get on the record

2130
01:29:20,204 --> 01:29:22,586
is that I'm not the one
who provided the list.

2131
01:29:23,523 --> 01:29:25,773
These names were
provided by Brad Marion.

2132
01:29:27,617 --> 01:29:29,429
So under oath--

2133
01:29:29,929 --> 01:29:30,921
Yes.

2134
01:29:31,046 --> 01:29:33,413
I can confirm
the list is accurate.

2135
01:29:33,531 --> 01:29:35,812
<i>The L.A. players and I
were given a choice.</i>

2136
01:29:35,921 --> 01:29:38,210
<i>Testify against each
other in open court</i>

2137
01:29:38,235 --> 01:29:41,735
<i>or help make restitution to the
victims of Brad's Ponzi scheme.</i>

2138
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:44,572
I wrote the government
a check for $500,000.

2139
01:29:45,236 --> 01:29:47,994
<i>And somewhere in an FBI
field office in New York,</i>

2140
01:29:48,431 --> 01:29:50,627
<i>someone was pinning
my picture to a wall.</i>

2141
01:29:52,549 --> 01:29:54,205
<i>I was running six games a week,</i>

2142
01:29:54,315 --> 01:29:56,541
<i>sometimes at two different
locations in a night.</i>

2143
01:29:56,636 --> 01:29:59,222
<i>And by this point,
I was addicted to drugs.</i>

2144
01:29:59,917 --> 01:30:02,253
<i>Adderall, Ambien, Xanax, coke,</i>

2145
01:30:02,448 --> 01:30:05,518
<i>alcohol, Valium, Ativan, Trazadone--</i>

2146
01:30:05,675 --> 01:30:08,214
<i>anything that could keep
me up for a few days</i>

2147
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:10,743
<i>and knock me out
for a few hours.</i>

2148
01:30:13,985 --> 01:30:16,344
<i>But I wasn't just taking them
to stay awake anymore.</i>

2149
01:30:17,016 --> 01:30:19,258
<i>It was dark and
friendless where I was.</i>

2150
01:30:21,475 --> 01:30:24,537
<i>I felt like I was in a hole so deep,
I could go fracking.</i>

2151
01:30:24,795 --> 01:30:27,873
<i>It didn't feel like depression,
it felt more violent.</i>

2152
01:30:29,608 --> 01:30:32,850
<i>I was tired of living in the frat
house I'd built for degenerates.</i>

2153
01:30:33,077 --> 01:30:34,670
<i>I was tired of the greed--</i>

2154
01:30:35,006 --> 01:30:36,655
<i>mine, not theirs.</i>

2155
01:30:37,069 --> 01:30:38,178
<i>Everybody's.</i>

2156
01:30:38,311 --> 01:30:40,233
<i>I was sick of being
high all the time.</i>

2157
01:30:40,327 --> 01:30:42,366
<i>I was sick of living
in the gray area.</i>

2158
01:30:42,436 --> 01:30:45,249
<i>I couldn't recognize myself
and what I recognized,</i>

2159
01:30:45,274 --> 01:30:46,663
<i>I couldn't stand.</i>

2160
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,427
<i>After a game one night,</i>

2161
01:30:49,452 --> 01:30:51,677
<i>Douglas Downey surprised
me with a confession</i>

2162
01:30:51,702 --> 01:30:54,286
<i>after opening with another
detective story title.</i>

2163
01:30:54,398 --> 01:30:56,062
Gut shot on the river.

2164
01:30:56,508 --> 01:30:58,187
I want to say something.

2165
01:30:58,295 --> 01:30:59,100
Okay.

2166
01:30:59,131 --> 01:31:01,897
I want to say um... something.

2167
01:31:02,358 --> 01:31:03,162
Okay.

2168
01:31:03,193 --> 01:31:04,303
I'm just gonna say it.

2169
01:31:04,365 --> 01:31:05,108
Cool.

2170
01:31:05,195 --> 01:31:08,710
'Cause there's a poem...
a famous uh...

2171
01:31:09,873 --> 01:31:11,271
a poem about...

2172
01:31:12,334 --> 01:31:14,678
thoughts left unexpressed.

2173
01:31:15,308 --> 01:31:18,198
Two roads emerged
from the woods.

2174
01:31:19,863 --> 01:31:21,629
Do they explode?

2175
01:31:23,121 --> 01:31:24,308
I don't know.

2176
01:31:24,754 --> 01:31:26,019
You like poetry?

2177
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:28,195
I did until a second ago.
I'm gonna call you a--

2178
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,758
I'm in love with you.

2179
01:31:32,336 --> 01:31:33,485
This isn't happening.

2180
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:34,946
Plain and simple.

2181
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:37,633
You're the woman I've
always dreamed of

2182
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:38,593
and I've been dreaming--

2183
01:31:38,664 --> 01:31:39,906
Shhh stop it.

2184
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:41,344
Listen to me, Douglas?

2185
01:31:41,369 --> 01:31:43,391
I'm the woman all of you
have always dreamed of.

2186
01:31:43,461 --> 01:31:44,938
I'm the anti-wife.

2187
01:31:45,326 --> 01:31:46,552
I encourage your gambling.

2188
01:31:46,599 --> 01:31:48,161
I have drinks served
to you by models

2189
01:31:48,186 --> 01:31:50,263
who simultaneously
create the impression

2190
01:31:50,288 --> 01:31:51,702
that you're the
kind of guy who can

2191
01:31:51,727 --> 01:31:53,608
score a dime piece
anytime you want.

2192
01:31:53,803 --> 01:31:55,374
It's nice for you in here.

2193
01:31:56,124 --> 01:31:57,538
Do you know who Circe was?

2194
01:31:58,375 --> 01:31:59,289
Um...

2195
01:31:59,953 --> 01:32:00,898
Circe.

2196
01:32:02,349 --> 01:32:03,653
Used to play in
Teddy Chin's game?

2197
01:32:03,678 --> 01:32:04,615
Nope.

2198
01:32:05,114 --> 01:32:07,193
Circe did not play
in Teddy's game.

2199
01:32:07,218 --> 01:32:09,104
She was the Greek
goddess of magic

2200
01:32:09,167 --> 01:32:11,752
and she gave men feasts
with wine and honey

2201
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:13,987
and then turned
them into swine.

2202
01:32:14,012 --> 01:32:15,073
Why?

2203
01:32:15,546 --> 01:32:17,070
Fantastic question.

2204
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,687
I would never do that to you.

2205
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:22,689
Missed the point by miles,
but that's okay.

2206
01:32:22,752 --> 01:32:23,580
Oh.

2207
01:32:24,236 --> 01:32:26,470
Um, Molly...

2208
01:32:26,746 --> 01:32:28,621
Shelby and Winston
will close up.

2209
01:32:29,942 --> 01:32:31,442
I'll see you next week.

2210
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:38,410
Here you go.

2211
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:40,543
-Thanks a lot, Randy.
-Thanks, Molly.

2212
01:32:40,981 --> 01:32:42,879
-Good morning.
-Morning, Pat.

2213
01:32:43,942 --> 01:32:46,137
<i>Pat was my driver and security.</i>

2214
01:32:47,332 --> 01:32:48,543
Straight home?

2215
01:32:48,809 --> 01:32:49,519
Yeah.

2216
01:32:49,581 --> 01:32:50,800
<i>We didn't know much
more about each other</i>

2217
01:32:50,825 --> 01:32:52,964
<i>than we needed to know
but I liked him.</i>

2218
01:32:53,051 --> 01:32:54,293
<i>We were friends.</i>

2219
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:02,980
I used to be
a competitive athlete.

2220
01:33:04,943 --> 01:33:07,372
-I didn't know if you knew that.
-What sport?

2221
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,270
Skiing.

2222
01:33:10,419 --> 01:33:11,404
Freestyle.

2223
01:33:12,536 --> 01:33:13,645
Were you good?

2224
01:33:16,656 --> 01:33:17,797
I don't know.

2225
01:33:26,337 --> 01:33:28,181
<i>Pat asked me a favor.</i>

2226
01:33:28,267 --> 01:33:29,688
<i>He said there were a
couple of hedge fund guys</i>

2227
01:33:29,713 --> 01:33:31,485
<i>in New Jersey who
wanted to play and</i>

2228
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:32,642
<i>he could score points
with them</i>

2229
01:33:32,667 --> 01:33:34,721
<i>if he was able to get them
a meeting with me.</i>

2230
01:33:34,807 --> 01:33:38,025
<i>I said sure and set the meeting
for 5 p.m. on a Thursday</i>

2231
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:40,978
<i>at the Four Seasons bar,
knowing that if they were legit,</i>

2232
01:33:41,124 --> 01:33:43,256
<i>they'd recognize someone
in the crowd at Happy Hour</i>

2233
01:33:43,281 --> 01:33:45,631
<i>at the Four Seasons right
after the closing bell.</i>

2234
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,799
<i>It turns out I didn't
need to be that clever.</i>

2235
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:49,611
<i>These weren't finance guys,</i>

2236
01:33:49,643 --> 01:33:51,557
<i>they were from
the cast of</i> Jersey Boys.

2237
01:33:51,682 --> 01:33:53,830
<i>They looked around
the bar self-consciously,</i>

2238
01:33:53,892 --> 01:33:55,091
<i>they were out of their element.</i>

2239
01:33:55,138 --> 01:33:57,685
<i>And tough guys try to look
tougher when they're insecure.</i>

2240
01:33:57,943 --> 01:33:59,669
<i>I had a good hunch
what they wanted</i>

2241
01:33:59,694 --> 01:34:01,615
<i>and I was gonna have to shut
down this meeting quickly</i>

2242
01:34:01,726 --> 01:34:03,983
<i>but without being rude to
Joey Bag-a-Donuts</i>

2243
01:34:04,108 --> 01:34:05,265
<i>and Secaucus Sal.</i>

2244
01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:06,857
I'm Molly Bloom,
nice to meet you.

2245
01:34:07,005 --> 01:34:07,951
John G.

2246
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,388
-And you are?
-Paul.

2247
01:34:11,295 --> 01:34:12,717
How do we get a drink?

2248
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:15,779
<i>I don't remember what
the other guy ordered</i>

2249
01:34:15,804 --> 01:34:17,607
<i>but I'll never forget
what John G. had.</i>

2250
01:34:17,845 --> 01:34:19,877
<i>He looked at the waiter as if to
say that he could handle himself</i>

2251
01:34:19,902 --> 01:34:22,276
<i>just fine among the
Manhattan elite and said,</i>

2252
01:34:22,331 --> 01:34:23,596
I'll have an appletini.

2253
01:34:25,966 --> 01:34:26,638
Okay.

2254
01:34:26,724 --> 01:34:28,208
So, how was your week?

2255
01:34:28,356 --> 01:34:30,903
My week? Uh, it was fine,
thank you.

2256
01:34:31,661 --> 01:34:34,505
Pat said you guys might
be interested in a game.

2257
01:34:35,802 --> 01:34:37,481
We want to partner with you.

2258
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:41,075
-We've talked to Tooty, Will--
-Teddy Chin.

2259
01:34:41,122 --> 01:34:42,207
Teddy Chin.

2260
01:34:42,544 --> 01:34:44,458
We do a little work
with them too.

2261
01:34:44,731 --> 01:34:46,403
We can make your life easier.

2262
01:34:48,989 --> 01:34:50,364
Nobody'll fuck with you.

2263
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:52,309
Nobody'll stiff you.

2264
01:34:56,289 --> 01:34:57,742
I appreciate...

2265
01:34:58,438 --> 01:35:00,281
the offer but really...

2266
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:02,344
I'm fine. I don't carry a

2267
01:35:02,477 --> 01:35:03,977
big debt sheet.
I feel safe--

2268
01:35:04,002 --> 01:35:04,789
Ahh.

2269
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,164
You lied just then.

2270
01:35:06,964 --> 01:35:09,300
When you said you don't
carry a big debt sheet.

2271
01:35:09,463 --> 01:35:11,752
You've got 2.8 million on
the street right now,

2272
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,658
right as we're sitting here,
we do our research.

2273
01:35:15,066 --> 01:35:16,777
That money should
be in your hands

2274
01:35:16,839 --> 01:35:18,018
'cause it's yours.

2275
01:35:18,644 --> 01:35:19,902
It's yours.

2276
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:21,802
And if you don't have it,

2277
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:24,154
you gotta go into your pocket
to pay the wins.

2278
01:35:25,763 --> 01:35:27,395
Fellas, I'm sorry,

2279
01:35:28,005 --> 01:35:30,622
it's just a friendly
game with higher stakes.

2280
01:35:31,106 --> 01:35:32,684
It was really nice
to meet you though.

2281
01:35:32,809 --> 01:35:35,106
Let me know if there's
anything I can do for you.

2282
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:36,700
I like to do favors.

2283
01:35:37,317 --> 01:35:38,770
They'll put your
drinks on my card.

2284
01:35:39,925 --> 01:35:41,378
<i>There are some
gaps in my memory,</i>

2285
01:35:41,403 --> 01:35:44,394
<i>which they say is common when
you've had what's called an event.</i>

2286
01:35:44,628 --> 01:35:46,728
<i>For instance, I don't remember
where I was coming from</i>

2287
01:35:46,753 --> 01:35:48,324
<i>when I calked into my building.</i>

2288
01:35:48,417 --> 01:35:51,488
<i>Just that my doorman, Reggie,
said he had packages for me.</i>

2289
01:35:51,527 --> 01:35:53,066
I think I've got some things
for you in the package room,

2290
01:35:53,091 --> 01:35:54,305
-I'll bring them on up.
-Thanks.

2291
01:35:54,337 --> 01:35:55,914
<i>It was the first night
of two weeks off</i>

2292
01:35:55,962 --> 01:35:57,446
<i>for Christmas and New Year's.</i>

2293
01:35:58,001 --> 01:35:59,837
<i>And my plan was
to take a bath</i>

2294
01:35:59,862 --> 01:36:01,618
<i>and try not to take drugs.</i>

2295
01:36:01,868 --> 01:36:03,759
<i>Reggie came up with my packages.</i>

2296
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:09,838
Uh, sorry, you're in the wrong--

2297
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:13,182
Wait! Okay, hold on a second,
I have--

2298
01:36:17,788 --> 01:36:18,952
Not a sound.

2299
01:36:23,033 --> 01:36:24,111
Do you get me?

2300
01:36:24,533 --> 01:36:25,440
I have money.

2301
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:26,619
It's all cash.

2302
01:36:26,776 --> 01:36:27,580
Where?

2303
01:36:28,018 --> 01:36:28,885
Safe.

2304
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:29,885
Where is it?

2305
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,112
It's in the closet.

2306
01:36:31,229 --> 01:36:31,908
Show me.

2307
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:52,110
Put the money and
jewelry in a bag.

2308
01:37:01,678 --> 01:37:02,710
Gold bars too.

2309
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:13,608
Come on.

2310
01:37:13,905 --> 01:37:14,772
Open your mouth.

2311
01:37:15,585 --> 01:37:16,522
Open your mouth.

2312
01:37:17,557 --> 01:37:18,900
It wasn't an offer they made.

2313
01:37:19,291 --> 01:37:20,447
It wasn't a suggestion.

2314
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:22,994
This'll be your only reminder.

2315
01:37:24,197 --> 01:37:26,924
Your mother lives alone
in Telluride, Colorado.

2316
01:37:28,021 --> 01:37:28,834
Right?

2317
01:37:31,498 --> 01:37:32,224
Right?

2318
01:37:33,349 --> 01:37:34,412
Right, Molly?

2319
01:37:35,849 --> 01:37:37,294
She doesn't live there anymore.

2320
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:38,404
Yes, she does.

2321
01:38:41,113 --> 01:38:42,527
<i>I couldn't call a doctor</i>

2322
01:38:42,722 --> 01:38:44,050
<i>or go to an E.R.</i>

2323
01:38:44,894 --> 01:38:47,004
<i>They'd take one look at
me and call the police.</i>

2324
01:38:54,397 --> 01:38:56,522
<i>My eyes were swollen and black.</i>

2325
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:59,186
<i>my lips were cut and bloody.</i>

2326
01:38:59,986 --> 01:39:01,580
<i>I couldn't feel my face.</i>

2327
01:39:40,412 --> 01:39:42,013
<i>Pat had set up the meeting.</i>

2328
01:39:42,365 --> 01:39:44,193
<i>And he was how they
knew where I lived.</i>

2329
01:39:48,029 --> 01:39:50,115
<i>I stayed in my apartment
for two weeks</i>

2330
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:51,841
<i>waiting for my face to heal.</i>

2331
01:39:52,459 --> 01:39:54,530
<i>and waiting for the phone
call I knew was coming.</i>

2332
01:39:56,492 --> 01:39:57,875
<i>But the call didn't come.</i>

2333
01:39:58,563 --> 01:40:00,446
<i>Where was the call from John G.</i>

2334
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:03,055
<i>"So maybe you've had
a change of heart?"</i>

2335
01:40:06,662 --> 01:40:09,514
<i>After ten days I opened my
front door for the first time.</i>

2336
01:40:12,743 --> 01:40:14,243
<i>People were coming
back into town</i>

2337
01:40:14,299 --> 01:40:17,267
<i>after New Year's in Cabo and
St. Bart's and South Beach.</i>

2338
01:40:19,926 --> 01:40:22,567
<i>My phone was blowing up with
"When's the next game?"</i>

2339
01:40:23,395 --> 01:40:25,012
<i>But nothing from John G.</i>

2340
01:40:27,378 --> 01:40:29,495
<i>And then right there
on the front page</i>

2341
01:40:29,558 --> 01:40:32,121
<i>of the</i> New York Times
<i>from eight days ago--</i>

2342
01:40:32,998 --> 01:40:36,521
<i>"Nearly 125 Arrested in
Sweeping Mob Roundup."</i>

2343
01:40:37,764 --> 01:40:39,693
<i>Those guys were
either laying low</i>

2344
01:40:40,021 --> 01:40:41,389
<i>or they were in custody.</i>

2345
01:40:42,217 --> 01:40:44,092
<i>Sometimes God happens fast.</i>

2346
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:49,240
<i>My face had healed enough
so that a little make-up</i>

2347
01:40:49,265 --> 01:40:51,037
<i>would hide the bruises
that were left.</i>

2348
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:54,412
<i>I put together a week of games.</i>

2349
01:40:55,068 --> 01:40:56,357
<i>One week of games</i>

2350
01:40:56,382 --> 01:40:58,295
<i>to get the 2.8
million I was owed</i>

2351
01:40:58,389 --> 01:41:00,787
<i>and then I was out,
I was done.</i>

2352
01:41:01,169 --> 01:41:03,442
<i>One week of epic games.</i>

2353
01:41:04,161 --> 01:41:06,255
<i>I had some of my
London players in town</i>

2354
01:41:06,341 --> 01:41:08,646
<i>and the Russians had visiting
friends form Moscow.</i>

2355
01:41:08,975 --> 01:41:11,647
<i>Jesse and Shelby had already
started the game at the Plaza</i>

2356
01:41:11,693 --> 01:41:13,764
<i>and reporting heavy
early action.</i>

2357
01:41:14,264 --> 01:41:15,936
<i>I was on my way when
the phone rang.</i>

2358
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:18,115
<i>It was Douglas Downey.</i>

2359
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,561
I'm on my way, Doug.

2360
01:41:21,865 --> 01:41:26,287
<i>Wait. Molly, wait.
I'm hiding in the bathroom.</i>

2361
01:41:26,412 --> 01:41:28,537
<i>I just, I-I need you
to believe me, okay?</i>

2362
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:29,490
Who's bathroom?

2363
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:32,843
<i>believe me because--
at the suite, at the Plaza.</i>

2364
01:41:33,313 --> 01:41:34,696
Why are you hiding
in the bathroom?

2365
01:41:34,735 --> 01:41:37,501
<i>I would never tell them
anything about you.</i>

2366
01:41:37,526 --> 01:41:39,790
<i>I said, "Guys, you
want me to go further,</i>

2367
01:41:39,815 --> 01:41:42,742
<i>"you want me to go other
places, I'll do it.</i>

2368
01:41:42,767 --> 01:41:46,402
<i>"But nothing about Molly,
she can't be touched.</i>

2369
01:41:46,427 --> 01:41:47,599
<i>"Just the Russians."</i>

2370
01:41:47,649 --> 01:41:50,711
'Kay, you're drunk and a
little difficult to understand

2371
01:41:50,736 --> 01:41:52,774
so I'll see you in a few
minutes when I get there.

2372
01:41:52,799 --> 01:41:55,479
<i>I was, uh, I was...</i>

2373
01:41:56,299 --> 01:41:57,299
<i>uh...</i>

2374
01:41:59,093 --> 01:42:01,686
<i>I was cited for securities fraud.</i>

2375
01:42:02,054 --> 01:42:04,874
<i>It was scrubbed from my record,
that's why you don't know.</i>

2376
01:42:04,913 --> 01:42:06,358
Did you say securities fraud?

2377
01:42:06,383 --> 01:42:08,688
<i>I would never help them
build a case against you.</i>

2378
01:42:08,716 --> 01:42:11,989
<i>I would never give them
anything against you.</i>

2379
01:42:12,014 --> 01:42:14,177
<i>I'd commit perjury
before I did that.</i>

2380
01:42:14,588 --> 01:42:17,174
<i>It was such bullshit,
it was 2006.</i>

2381
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:19,173
If you had an arrest,
I'd have known.

2382
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:20,908
<i>-It was bullshit.</i>
-Doug.

2383
01:42:20,933 --> 01:42:24,392
<i>I told them, I'll go further,
I'll go other places.</i>

2384
01:42:24,839 --> 01:42:27,042
<i>But not you. I love you.</i>

2385
01:42:27,253 --> 01:42:28,292
<i>I-- I love you--</i>

2386
01:42:28,323 --> 01:42:30,746
Doug, listen, I need you to pull
it together for a second.

2387
01:42:30,771 --> 01:42:33,019
Did they scrub your record
because you've been informing?

2388
01:42:33,097 --> 01:42:34,878
<i>Should I... should
I have told you?</i>

2389
01:42:35,644 --> 01:42:39,026
<i>That's a question that'll-
that'll haunt me for all my days--</i>

2390
01:42:39,051 --> 01:42:40,464
Why are you hiding
in the bathroom?

2391
01:42:40,489 --> 01:42:42,120
<i>for my days, Molly.</i>

2392
01:42:43,208 --> 01:42:45,466
<i>Always know that I was
trying to protect you.</i>

2393
01:42:46,615 --> 01:42:49,678
<i>Five blocks away,
the FBI had raided my game.</i>

2394
01:43:08,514 --> 01:43:10,630
<i>I fully expected the lobby
to be filled with guys</i>

2395
01:43:10,655 --> 01:43:12,201
<i>wearing windbreakers,
but it wasn't.</i>

2396
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:13,901
Ms. Bloom. Haven't
seen you for a while.

2397
01:43:13,926 --> 01:43:14,666
Yeah.

2398
01:43:14,776 --> 01:43:15,839
You need a cab?

2399
01:43:22,339 --> 01:43:24,448
I guess you never made it
upstairs with the packages.

2400
01:43:25,377 --> 01:43:27,182
Maybe I didn't tip you
enough before Christmas.

2401
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:33,940
Then you got into a cab,
took the cab to JFK

2402
01:43:33,979 --> 01:43:35,511
and flew to your mother's
house in Denver.

2403
01:43:35,582 --> 01:43:36,596
Telluride.

2404
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:38,675
My mother lives in Telluride.

2405
01:43:38,787 --> 01:43:39,935
That was two years ago.

2406
01:43:40,287 --> 01:43:40,959
Mm-hmm.

2407
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:42,443
In the cab on the
way to the airport,

2408
01:43:42,468 --> 01:43:44,521
I checked my bank
account balance.

2409
01:43:44,546 --> 01:43:47,232
There should have been a little
over 4 million dollars, but instead

2410
01:43:47,541 --> 01:43:49,487
it said the balance was
zero and there was a note

2411
01:43:49,512 --> 01:43:51,705
telling me to contact
the Justice Department.

2412
01:43:51,751 --> 01:43:53,595
I just want to mention
that she also voluntarily

2413
01:43:53,635 --> 01:43:55,455
checked herself into
28-day rehab

2414
01:43:55,511 --> 01:43:57,728
and has been sober
and clean for two years.

2415
01:43:57,761 --> 01:44:00,455
I don't care. Were the women
that worked for you call girls?

2416
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:01,784
No, sir.

2417
01:44:01,886 --> 01:44:03,511
They never exchanged
sex for money?

2418
01:44:03,613 --> 01:44:04,300
No.

2419
01:44:04,386 --> 01:44:05,776
Have you ever exchanged
sex for money?

2420
01:44:05,847 --> 01:44:06,683
No.

2421
01:44:06,785 --> 01:44:08,066
I think he was talking to me.

2422
01:44:08,105 --> 01:44:10,355
I meant, no, she's not
answering that question.

2423
01:44:10,402 --> 01:44:11,956
-The purpose of this meeting--
-I know.

2424
01:44:11,988 --> 01:44:13,659
-The purpose of this meeting--
-We're off the record.

2425
01:44:13,731 --> 01:44:14,511
We're not off the record.

2426
01:44:14,536 --> 01:44:15,667
Do you see a
stenographer in here?

2427
01:44:15,692 --> 01:44:16,980
We're off the record
inasmuch as

2428
01:44:17,005 --> 01:44:18,364
there is no record,
but you're free to use

2429
01:44:18,389 --> 01:44:19,427
the information you're given

2430
01:44:19,452 --> 01:44:21,638
and we're not giving the
information for free.

2431
01:44:21,872 --> 01:44:24,005
I've been sitting at this
table for five hours,

2432
01:44:24,029 --> 01:44:27,771
waiting for the opportunity to
implore you to do the right thing

2433
01:44:27,803 --> 01:44:30,083
while begging my client
for the last three weeks

2434
01:44:30,108 --> 01:44:31,888
to act in her own best interest.

2435
01:44:31,913 --> 01:44:33,982
And neither of those
things should be hard.

2436
01:44:34,063 --> 01:44:36,383
The purpose of this meeting is
for you to meet Molly Bloom

2437
01:44:36,408 --> 01:44:38,720
and discover, as I have,
that she is not the person

2438
01:44:38,745 --> 01:44:39,947
the press has invented.

2439
01:44:39,972 --> 01:44:42,728
She's not under federal indictment
for getting bad press, Charlie.

2440
01:44:42,753 --> 01:44:44,486
And the purpose of
the meeting, for me,

2441
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:46,510
is to discover if your client
is willing to cooperate

2442
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:49,503
with the government in
putting away some bad people.

2443
01:44:49,635 --> 01:44:50,480
No.

2444
01:44:50,691 --> 01:44:52,019
You're not willing to cooperate?

2445
01:44:52,044 --> 01:44:55,074
Uh, no, I never
traded sex for money.

2446
01:44:55,997 --> 01:44:58,606
I'm still not sure if there's
a record but if there is

2447
01:44:58,631 --> 01:45:01,630
I wanted to be certain
that was in it.

2448
01:45:02,007 --> 01:45:04,124
It appears to me throughout
your career as a game runner

2449
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:06,471
you're extremely diligent
about vetting players?

2450
01:45:06,496 --> 01:45:07,096
I was.

2451
01:45:07,128 --> 01:45:08,259
But you let four guys
play in the game

2452
01:45:08,284 --> 01:45:09,674
without knowing they
were connected?

2453
01:45:09,699 --> 01:45:12,534
Yeah, plus an FBI informant,
it's embarrassing.

2454
01:45:19,683 --> 01:45:22,105
I was high at the end and...

2455
01:45:23,106 --> 01:45:24,497
doing my job badly.

2456
01:45:25,505 --> 01:45:27,880
I'll also add that in
my limited experience

2457
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:29,935
with the Russian mob,
they don't immediately

2458
01:45:30,006 --> 01:45:32,451
present themselves
as mobsters.

2459
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:35,468
My experience with
the Italian mob--

2460
01:45:35,493 --> 01:45:36,233
Help us.

2461
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:39,838
I don't know anything
that can help you.

2462
01:45:39,892 --> 01:45:40,493
Yes.

2463
01:45:40,518 --> 01:45:41,650
-If I did,
-Yes, you do.

2464
01:45:41,744 --> 01:45:43,736
You can provide color.
You can paint a picture.

2465
01:45:43,814 --> 01:45:46,384
You can tell us Druzhinsky
wore a $100,000 Patek Philippe

2466
01:45:46,409 --> 01:45:47,627
and drove a Phantom.

2467
01:45:47,667 --> 01:45:49,096
You can tell us
Illya Gershen showed up

2468
01:45:49,121 --> 01:45:50,948
with a quarter million
dollars cash in a backpack

2469
01:45:50,973 --> 01:45:52,051
and you can tell us
how much action

2470
01:45:52,076 --> 01:45:53,582
Shelly was taking
on a sports bet.

2471
01:45:53,607 --> 01:45:56,950
No one was allowed to place
sports bets inside the room.

2472
01:45:56,975 --> 01:45:58,279
They would have to go outside.

2473
01:45:58,304 --> 01:46:01,361
So I had no idea how
much anyone was taking or--

2474
01:46:01,446 --> 01:46:02,947
So now you're saying
you knew

2475
01:46:03,002 --> 01:46:04,901
they were making and
taking sports bets?

2476
01:46:04,926 --> 01:46:06,566
That's the point of
them going outside

2477
01:46:06,591 --> 01:46:08,606
they could have been calling
their mother for all I knew.

2478
01:46:08,631 --> 01:46:10,231
-Molly?
-Yes, sir.

2479
01:46:10,785 --> 01:46:12,020
I don't believe you.

2480
01:46:13,398 --> 01:46:15,695
In Mike Davidov's phone
intercepts alone,

2481
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:18,523
just Davidov, your name
comes up 19 times.

2482
01:46:18,767 --> 01:46:20,884
"We need Molly," "Get Molly,"
"Bring Molly"

2483
01:46:20,927 --> 01:46:23,333
It strongly suggests you're
important to his business

2484
01:46:23,358 --> 01:46:24,505
so it's hard for
me to believe that

2485
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:26,802
someone with your savvy
and obvious intellect--

2486
01:46:26,827 --> 01:46:28,202
They're talking about the drug.

2487
01:46:29,812 --> 01:46:33,148
"Get molly", "Bring molly",
"We need molly", its...

2488
01:46:33,851 --> 01:46:35,875
They're talking about
the drug, ecstasy.

2489
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:41,491
Shit, my office was next
to yours for two years and

2490
01:46:41,516 --> 01:46:43,492
I've seen you make
some bone-headed moves

2491
01:46:43,517 --> 01:46:46,186
but I've never seen any
prosecutor step in it

2492
01:46:46,211 --> 01:46:48,140
the way you just did.

2493
01:46:48,295 --> 01:46:50,935
You should thank all of the gods
that there is no physical evidence

2494
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,202
-of that exchange.
-Hey, look--

2495
01:46:52,227 --> 01:46:53,209
No, you look, Harry--

2496
01:46:53,234 --> 01:46:54,974
What, are you gonna implore
me to do the right thing?

2497
01:46:54,999 --> 01:46:58,029
This woman does not belong
in a RICO indictment.

2498
01:46:58,054 --> 01:47:00,062
Are you out of your minds?!

2499
01:47:00,232 --> 01:47:03,240
She does not belong
in a mob indictment,

2500
01:47:03,265 --> 01:47:06,747
she raked a game, that's it,
for seven months two years ago!

2501
01:47:06,772 --> 01:47:09,666
And why? Because she was
giving credit in the millions

2502
01:47:09,691 --> 01:47:12,057
and she didn't want to
use muscle to collect.

2503
01:47:12,194 --> 01:47:15,123
She has had opportunity
after opportunity

2504
01:47:15,177 --> 01:47:16,849
to greatly benefit herself

2505
01:47:16,975 --> 01:47:19,545
by just telling the real
stories that she knows.

2506
01:47:19,617 --> 01:47:23,382
Okay? I have the forensic
imaging going back to 2007.

2507
01:47:23,421 --> 01:47:25,343
And I'm talking about
text messages,

2508
01:47:25,392 --> 01:47:27,968
e-mails, movie stars,
rock stars, athletes,

2509
01:47:27,993 --> 01:47:30,882
billionaires, all explicit,
some married with kids,

2510
01:47:30,907 --> 01:47:32,773
and that's just the
tip of the iceberg.

2511
01:47:32,852 --> 01:47:34,539
What about the guy
who comes this close

2512
01:47:34,564 --> 01:47:36,618
to being the U.S.
Ambassador to Monaco?

2513
01:47:36,643 --> 01:47:39,087
He's withdrawn from consideration
at the last minute.

2514
01:47:39,112 --> 01:47:40,705
No one knows why.

2515
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:41,893
She does.

2516
01:47:42,065 --> 01:47:44,526
CEOs with college-age
mistresses,

2517
01:47:44,551 --> 01:47:47,392
an SVP of an investment bank
who wanted Molly to put

2518
01:47:47,425 --> 01:47:49,057
a marked deck in a game,

2519
01:47:49,082 --> 01:47:50,711
the head of a movie
studio who texted her

2520
01:47:50,736 --> 01:47:53,422
that a particular star was
too black for his liking,

2521
01:47:53,447 --> 01:47:57,429
I mean, J. Edgar Hoover didn't
have this much shit on Bobby!

2522
01:47:57,758 --> 01:48:01,204
You know, she could've written a
bestseller and been set for life,

2523
01:48:01,321 --> 01:48:03,766
easy, she's got the-she's got
the winning lottery ticket

2524
01:48:03,791 --> 01:48:06,039
and she won't cash it.

2525
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:10,490
Your office took
every dollar she has

2526
01:48:10,515 --> 01:48:12,826
in a constitutionally
fucked up seizure

2527
01:48:12,858 --> 01:48:15,435
and then put the IRS on her
to tax what you seized?

2528
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:16,428
I mean,

2529
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:18,112
I've been in those
strategy meetings.

2530
01:48:18,176 --> 01:48:22,123
You broke her back so she couldn't
possibly afford to defend herself.

2531
01:48:22,148 --> 01:48:24,711
And now she has an opportunity
to guarantee her freedom

2532
01:48:24,774 --> 01:48:27,828
by "providing color" and
she still won't do it.

2533
01:48:27,907 --> 01:48:30,306
This woman doesn't belong
in a RICO indictment,

2534
01:48:30,338 --> 01:48:32,337
she belongs in a box of Wheaties.

2535
01:48:32,368 --> 01:48:33,837
So, yes, Harrison,

2536
01:48:33,862 --> 01:48:37,113
I am imploring you to
do the right thing.

2537
01:48:37,138 --> 01:48:39,051
She knows nothing about
the three Petes.

2538
01:48:39,081 --> 01:48:40,487
Nothing about Rachniana.

2539
01:48:40,512 --> 01:48:42,559
Nothing about RGO
or insurance fraud.

2540
01:48:42,893 --> 01:48:45,729
Between the two of us, we've
appeared in front of this judge

2541
01:48:45,754 --> 01:48:48,096
28 times as prosecutors
and not once

2542
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:50,588
has he deviated from our
sentencing recommendations,

2543
01:48:50,613 --> 01:48:52,658
he's not gonna start now.

2544
01:48:55,115 --> 01:48:57,646
I know you've been putting this
bust together for three years

2545
01:48:57,695 --> 01:49:00,935
and there's no one who doesn't
want to see mobsters go to jail

2546
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,810
including and especially
the one person in the room

2547
01:49:03,888 --> 01:49:06,693
who's had one of them
put a gun in her mouth.

2548
01:49:07,646 --> 01:49:09,474
Probation. Community service.

2549
01:49:09,499 --> 01:49:12,309
Or better yet, just consider that
all she did is run a poker game

2550
01:49:12,334 --> 01:49:15,122
exactly the same way every
casino in America does

2551
01:49:15,147 --> 01:49:17,857
and drop the goddamn charges.

2552
01:49:31,286 --> 01:49:33,083
Anything else you'd like to add?

2553
01:49:35,301 --> 01:49:36,214
No.

2554
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:38,965
There's nothing else
she'd like to add.

2555
01:49:41,113 --> 01:49:43,324
Uh, I'd like to talk
to Charlie in private

2556
01:49:43,349 --> 01:49:44,988
if that'd be okay with you.

2557
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:47,714
Yeah.

2558
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:50,002
Why don't you just grab
some dinner for an hour

2559
01:49:50,027 --> 01:49:51,393
and meet me back in the office?

2560
01:50:08,492 --> 01:50:10,008
Huh? I'm sorry?

2561
01:50:10,344 --> 01:50:11,468
Did you want a hotdog?

2562
01:50:19,312 --> 01:50:20,664
I'll have a pretzel, please.

Hi.

2569
01:50:58,711 --> 01:51:02,148
I would like to rent a pair
of skates, size seven.

2570
01:51:02,312 --> 01:51:03,750
But I don't have any money.

2571
01:51:05,023 --> 01:51:07,812
These are $800 leather
Chanel gloves.

2572
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:08,872
I'll trade you.

2573
01:51:09,223 --> 01:51:10,551
$800 gloves?

2574
01:51:10,645 --> 01:51:12,989
And they keep your hands just
as warm as the $10 kind.

2575
01:51:15,198 --> 01:51:16,651
Miss, are you all right?

2576
01:51:16,698 --> 01:51:17,682

Hey! Slow down!

01:52:00,141 --> 01:52:01,742
Hey, miss, slow down!

01:52:02,516 --> 01:52:03,383

01:52:12,156 --> 01:52:13,633
Hey, slow down!

2588
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:21,707
Bend your knees.

2589
01:52:21,856 --> 01:52:22,715
Dad?

2590
01:52:27,004 --> 01:52:27,957
You all right?

2591
01:52:29,145 --> 01:52:30,340
Sorry about that.

2592
01:52:32,042 --> 01:52:32,980
Sorry.

2593
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:34,885
Taking you off the ice right now.

2594
01:52:39,347 --> 01:52:40,417
How's it going?

2595
01:52:55,542 --> 01:52:56,948
What are you doing in New York?

2596
01:52:58,198 --> 01:52:59,472
How'd you know I was
at the skating rink?

2597
01:52:59,497 --> 01:53:00,878
I'm a doctor of the mind.

2598
01:53:00,903 --> 01:53:02,308
Oh, Dad.

2599
01:53:03,222 --> 01:53:05,495
I'm here in New York because
that's where you are.

2600
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:09,292
I called your mom at the hotel
and she said you were here.

2601
01:53:10,076 --> 01:53:12,480
Listen, it's not a big deal,
but from what I saw out there,

2602
01:53:12,505 --> 01:53:14,246
I think you're having
a small breakdown.

2603
01:53:14,562 --> 01:53:16,562
That's weird. I can't think of why.

2604
01:53:16,695 --> 01:53:17,913
Probably because of the arrest

2605
01:53:17,938 --> 01:53:20,007
and not knowing what's
going to happen next.

2606
01:53:20,206 --> 01:53:22,651
Old man, do you really
not recognize sarcasm?

2607
01:53:24,206 --> 01:53:25,120
Do you?

2608
01:53:27,088 --> 01:53:28,276
Here, drink this.

2609
01:53:29,206 --> 01:53:30,971
I'm an alcoholic, I can't drink
but thanks for remembering.

2610
01:53:30,996 --> 01:53:32,221
It's hot chocolate.

2611
01:53:34,117 --> 01:53:34,961
Okay.

2612
01:53:35,752 --> 01:53:37,096
And for diagnostic purposes,

2613
01:53:37,128 --> 01:53:39,478
do you think that we're on a
cocktail lounge right now?

2614
01:53:39,581 --> 01:53:41,854
You seeing waiters with
trays of champagne?

2615
01:53:41,932 --> 01:53:43,112
I want to check your pulse.

2616
01:53:49,612 --> 01:53:50,745
Have you found a pulse?

2617
01:53:50,839 --> 01:53:53,393
Yeah, just admiring my watch.

2618
01:53:54,167 --> 01:53:55,612
I can see you're
getting warmed up

2619
01:53:55,637 --> 01:53:57,345
but I really don't have
the emotional bandwidth

2620
01:53:57,370 --> 01:54:00,120
to defend my "as usual
irresponsible behavior."

2621
01:54:00,145 --> 01:54:01,724
I know, I got your e-mail.

2622
01:54:01,748 --> 01:54:04,216
I get that I'm not welcome in your
life right now as your father

2623
01:54:04,241 --> 01:54:07,037
though you should know I could
give a shit if I'm welcome or not.

2624
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:10,346
But I'm not here in my
capacity as your father.

2625
01:54:11,107 --> 01:54:14,052
I'm indifferent to whether
your father lives or dies.

2626
01:54:14,221 --> 01:54:15,736
I'm a very expensive therapist

2627
01:54:15,791 --> 01:54:17,642
and I'm here to give
you one free session.

2628
01:54:18,367 --> 01:54:20,516
You think what I need
right now is a therapist?

2629
01:54:22,515 --> 01:54:23,436
Yeah.

2630
01:54:25,617 --> 01:54:27,852
I have to be back at my
lawyer's office soon.

2631
01:54:29,492 --> 01:54:30,656
Do you like your lawyer?

2632
01:54:31,742 --> 01:54:33,992
I wasn't asking for money
when I called you, Dad.

2633
01:54:34,017 --> 01:54:35,406
I just needed my dad.

2634
01:54:35,711 --> 01:54:37,602
God forbid you part with a nickel.

2635
01:54:38,102 --> 01:54:40,070
Yeah, Tiny Tim, you
grew up on a lake

2636
01:54:40,164 --> 01:54:41,687
and you've skied all
over the world,

2637
01:54:41,758 --> 01:54:43,078
were those work houses tough?

2638
01:54:43,103 --> 01:54:43,922
I gotta go.

2639
01:54:43,996 --> 01:54:44,863
-Molly.
-I gotta go.

2640
01:54:44,888 --> 01:54:47,980
Molly, sit the fuck down!

2641
01:54:58,195 --> 01:55:00,898
All right, we're gonna do three
years of therapy in three minutes.

2642
01:55:01,773 --> 01:55:02,632
How?

2643
01:55:02,905 --> 01:55:04,655
I'm gonna do what patients
have been begging

2644
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:06,039
therapists to do for
a hundred years,

2645
01:55:06,064 --> 01:55:07,710
I'm just gonna
give you the answers.

2646
01:55:08,664 --> 01:55:09,430
To what?

2647
01:55:09,603 --> 01:55:12,110
Well, let's start with this
Why does a young woman who,

2648
01:55:12,135 --> 01:55:14,425
at 22, has a gold-plated resume,

2649
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:16,738
why does she run
poker games?

2650
01:55:16,888 --> 01:55:18,896
Why did I choose to
make a ton of money?

2651
01:55:18,921 --> 01:55:19,817
That's a head scratcher.

2652
01:55:19,842 --> 01:55:21,529
You were gonna be a success
at anything you wanted,

2653
01:55:21,554 --> 01:55:22,576
you know it.

2654
01:55:22,631 --> 01:55:24,311
If you'd gone to law school
you'd have

2655
01:55:24,569 --> 01:55:26,569
you'd have owned the
law firm right now.

2656
01:55:26,628 --> 01:55:29,589
Why did you do...
the other thing instead?

2657
01:55:30,152 --> 01:55:31,027
I don't know.

2658
01:55:32,573 --> 01:55:33,299
Drugs.

2659
01:55:34,823 --> 01:55:36,737
You didn't start with
the drugs until the end.

2660
01:55:36,762 --> 01:55:38,941
They weren't the problem,
they were the medicine.

2661
01:55:40,004 --> 01:55:42,910
It was so you could
control powerful men.

2662
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:47,385
Your addiction

2663
01:55:47,503 --> 01:55:50,073
was having power
over powerful men.

2664
01:55:54,436 --> 01:55:55,749
Is that what you really think?

2665
01:55:55,944 --> 01:55:56,647
No.

2666
01:55:57,093 --> 01:55:58,249
I know it for sure.

2667
01:55:58,608 --> 01:56:00,904
You've now completed
your first year of therapy.

2668
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:03,694
I saw an opportunity,
it wasn't about you.

2669
01:56:03,719 --> 01:56:05,264
Nah, it wasn't just about me.

2670
01:56:05,406 --> 01:56:07,750
-It wasn't at all about you.
-It was.

2671
01:56:09,125 --> 01:56:11,563
Second year, second question.

2672
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:16,516
Do you think you
were a good husband?

2673
01:56:17,055 --> 01:56:17,954
What do you care?

2674
01:56:18,094 --> 01:56:19,954
I care because you were
married to my mother.

2675
01:56:19,985 --> 01:56:22,009
I care because
my father's an asshole.

2676
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:25,227
Congratulations,
you've completed Year Two.

2677
01:56:25,563 --> 01:56:27,133
And for the record,
your father raised

2678
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:29,485
three kids on a college
professor's salary.

2679
01:56:29,563 --> 01:56:31,516
One of them
is a two-time Olympian,

2680
01:56:31,922 --> 01:56:34,148
a sixth round draft pick of
the Philadelphia Eagles

2681
01:56:34,274 --> 01:56:36,024
and a leading philanthropist.

2682
01:56:36,944 --> 01:56:39,623
The other is a cardiothorasic
surgeon at Mass General

2683
01:56:39,655 --> 01:56:40,994
and the third

2684
01:56:41,111 --> 01:56:43,209
managed to build a
multi-million dollar business

2685
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:45,956
using not much more
than her wits.

2686
01:56:48,317 --> 01:56:50,253
I'm about to plead
guilty in federal court.

2687
01:56:50,278 --> 01:56:51,848
Well, nobody's perfect.

2688
01:56:52,161 --> 01:56:54,200
The point is
I did a few things right.

2689
01:56:55,012 --> 01:56:56,145
Last question.

2690
01:56:56,622 --> 01:56:58,106
No, I have to go.

2691
01:56:58,161 --> 01:56:59,911
Last question, Mol.
I'll answer it

2692
01:56:59,936 --> 01:57:01,442
but you have to ask it.

2693
01:57:04,780 --> 01:57:07,702
You have... to ask it.

2694
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:20,404
Why didn't you like me
as much as my brothers?

2695
01:57:21,053 --> 01:57:22,115
There it is.

2696
01:57:25,222 --> 01:57:26,152
I did.

2697
01:57:28,113 --> 01:57:31,160
It only from time to time
appeared that I didn't.

2698
01:57:32,099 --> 01:57:33,904
It only <i>appeared</i> that you didn't?

2699
01:57:34,076 --> 01:57:34,786
Yeah.

2700
01:57:34,943 --> 01:57:36,943
That is some Schedule 1 bullshit.

2701
01:57:38,291 --> 01:57:41,166
Why would--it only appeared--
Why would--

2702
01:57:41,486 --> 01:57:43,448
Okay, I had an attitude problem.

2703
01:57:43,651 --> 01:57:45,010
I talked back.

2704
01:57:45,127 --> 01:57:48,463
I broke some normal
adolescent rules.

2705
01:57:48,488 --> 01:57:50,907
I snuck phone time after curfew,

2706
01:57:50,932 --> 01:57:52,517
I took your car when I
wasn't allowed to--

2707
01:57:52,542 --> 01:57:53,915
And drove it into a McDonald's.

2708
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:55,289
And kids get punished for
that, but they don't--

2709
01:57:55,314 --> 01:57:56,367
Did I not say the McDonald's?

2710
01:57:56,392 --> 01:57:58,899
I mean, did you misunderstand
what drive-thru meant?

2711
01:57:58,924 --> 01:58:00,360
You turned into
a different person,

2712
01:58:00,385 --> 01:58:02,994
-your voice, your face.
-It's because I knew you knew.

2713
01:58:05,166 --> 01:58:06,354
I didn't hear what you said.

2714
01:58:07,114 --> 01:58:08,168
I said

2715
01:58:08,849 --> 01:58:10,200
I knew you knew.

2716
01:58:10,825 --> 01:58:12,075
You knew I knew what?

2717
01:58:12,505 --> 01:58:15,091
<i>What do you uh,
think about the following concepts?</i>

2718
01:58:15,583 --> 01:58:17,450
<i>Just gonna run 'em by you.
Marriage.</i>

2719
01:58:17,786 --> 01:58:18,919
<i>It is a trap.</i>

2720
01:58:19,927 --> 01:58:21,684
That I was cheating on Mom.

2721
01:58:23,044 --> 01:58:24,184
I knew you knew.

2722
01:58:24,934 --> 01:58:27,013
<i>-Society.
-It is a joke.</i>

2723
01:58:27,327 --> 01:58:30,077
No, I didn't know unt--
until I was 20.

2724
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:32,335
<i>-People.
-I don't trust people.</i>

2725
01:58:32,859 --> 01:58:34,796
No, you'd known since
you were five.

2726
01:58:35,259 --> 01:58:36,525
You saw me in my car

2727
01:58:36,588 --> 01:58:38,533
and you really didn't
know what you saw.

2728
01:58:41,426 --> 01:58:42,706
<i>I don't have any heroes.</i>

2729
01:58:46,072 --> 01:58:47,158
You knew, honey.

2730
01:58:47,923 --> 01:58:49,619
And I knew you knew,
and that's...

2731
01:58:51,439 --> 01:58:53,494
That's how I reacted
to the shame.

2732
01:58:54,996 --> 01:58:57,434
And you reacted by showing

2733
01:58:57,459 --> 01:58:59,598
seething contempt for me,

2734
01:59:01,574 --> 01:59:03,941
by driving my car
into a McDonald's

2735
01:59:04,536 --> 01:59:06,856
And wanting to have power
over powerful men?

2736
01:59:06,942 --> 01:59:07,895
No.

2737
01:59:08,606 --> 01:59:10,950
That was a red herring
just to make you mad.

2738
01:59:11,411 --> 01:59:13,301
-You're such an--
-You tripped over a stick.

2739
01:59:15,294 --> 01:59:16,153
Okay?

2740
01:59:17,088 --> 01:59:19,017
Twelve years ago
you tripped over a stick.

2741
01:59:19,042 --> 01:59:22,806
It was a one-in-a-million thing.
You tripped over a stick.

2742
01:59:22,963 --> 01:59:24,244
That's what you did wrong.

2743
01:59:25,149 --> 01:59:26,633
There's your session.

2744
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:35,012
It's funny how much
faster you can go

2745
01:59:35,037 --> 01:59:36,927
when you're not
charging by the hour.

2746
01:59:37,669 --> 01:59:38,966
I'm your father.

2747
01:59:40,244 --> 01:59:42,216
Trying to comprehend

2748
01:59:42,278 --> 01:59:43,989
how much I love
you would be like

2749
01:59:44,044 --> 01:59:48,275
trying to visualize the size
of the universe.

2750
01:59:49,469 --> 01:59:50,828
I didn't know

2751
01:59:52,156 --> 01:59:55,049
you got beaten up until I
read it in your book.

2752
01:59:56,721 --> 01:59:58,440
It was a hell of a way
to learn about it.

2753
01:59:58,465 --> 01:59:59,714
You should know

2754
01:59:59,784 --> 02:00:01,947
that I'm hiring someone to
find the guy who did it

2755
02:00:01,972 --> 02:00:04,034
then I'm hiring
someone to kill him.

2756
02:00:04,303 --> 02:00:05,631
Don't even joke about that.

2757
02:00:05,656 --> 02:00:06,881
I'm not.

2758
02:00:08,795 --> 02:00:11,124
It wasn't a purse snatcher,
Dad, it was the mafia.

2759
02:00:11,149 --> 02:00:12,876
I don't care if it's
the leader of Hamas.

2760
02:00:12,939 --> 02:00:16,493
Someone put their hands on you.
They're gonna suffer.

2761
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:23,212
-Dad, I'm fine.
-No, they're gonna suffer.

2762
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:26,993
Dad, I'm all right.

2763
02:00:27,051 --> 02:00:28,785
No. They're gonna suf--

2764
02:00:34,205 --> 02:00:36,033
Really, I'm fine.

2765
02:01:02,188 --> 02:01:03,391
-Did you know--
-Oh!

2766
02:01:03,982 --> 02:01:05,193
I didn't see you.

2767
02:01:05,607 --> 02:01:06,482
Did you know that we know

2768
02:01:06,507 --> 02:01:08,724
what the center of our
galaxy smells like?

2769
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:12,607
Smells like rum and raspberries.

2770
02:01:13,105 --> 02:01:15,018
The center of the galaxy
is ethyl formate,

2771
02:01:15,050 --> 02:01:16,815
which is the same gas
that gives rum its smell

2772
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:18,855
and raspberries their taste.

2773
02:01:20,122 --> 02:01:21,435
How do you know these things?

2774
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:23,702
To stay busy during games,
I surfed the internet.

2775
02:01:23,757 --> 02:01:25,975
Then I started taking
online courses.

2776
02:01:26,521 --> 02:01:28,707
I'm 12 credits away from
a degree in astronomy,

2777
02:01:28,732 --> 02:01:30,599
I didn't even know
I was enrolled.

2778
02:01:33,942 --> 02:01:34,677
Hey.

2779
02:01:36,137 --> 02:01:38,255
I want to thank you
for what you said tonight.

2780
02:01:42,635 --> 02:01:43,619
It was Stella

2781
02:01:47,564 --> 02:01:49,150
who asked me to be your lawyer.

2782
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:51,057
She read the book,

2783
02:01:51,150 --> 02:01:53,931
I accused her of
reading trash but she

2784
02:01:54,653 --> 02:01:56,583
defended the book impressively.

2785
02:01:57,965 --> 02:01:59,458
And then defended you.

2786
02:02:01,204 --> 02:02:02,642
You're her role model.

2787
02:02:04,899 --> 02:02:06,250
I'm gonna give her that.

2788
02:02:10,864 --> 02:02:12,590
There's a new offer on the table.

2789
02:02:14,082 --> 02:02:15,161
What is it?

2790
02:02:15,551 --> 02:02:17,012
We hand over the hard drives.

2791
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:19,821
I don't get it.

2792
02:02:19,846 --> 02:02:22,343
We hand over the forensic imaging
of the e-mails and texts

2793
02:02:22,368 --> 02:02:23,430
in exchange for uh--

2794
02:02:23,455 --> 02:02:26,196
Exchange--What could they
possibly offer for me to do that?

2795
02:02:35,056 --> 02:02:37,275
I wrote it all down, it's um...

2796
02:02:45,267 --> 02:02:46,478
Your money back.

2797
02:02:47,915 --> 02:02:50,681
They'll give you all your
money back plus interest.

2798
02:02:51,712 --> 02:02:53,345
It's over 5 million dollars.

2799
02:02:54,634 --> 02:02:56,845
Is that why they took
it in the first place?

2800
02:02:57,939 --> 02:02:59,509
So they could offer it back to me?

2801
02:02:59,635 --> 02:03:00,368
Yeah.

2802
02:03:00,418 --> 02:03:01,832
For what it's worth,
if we went to trial

2803
02:03:01,857 --> 02:03:04,950
you'd have to hand over the
forensic imaging in discovery.

2804
02:03:05,027 --> 02:03:07,027
But that's different from
voluntarily handing it over.

2805
02:03:07,075 --> 02:03:09,294
Sure, but it's not
really voluntary anymore

2806
02:03:09,349 --> 02:03:11,286
when the alternative is prison.

2807
02:03:11,513 --> 02:03:13,810
And that's what they're
gonna recommend, 42 months.

2808
02:03:17,691 --> 02:03:19,580
Why do you keep breaking
eye contact with me?

2809
02:03:19,605 --> 02:03:21,160
I-I'm looking right at you.

2810
02:03:21,644 --> 02:03:23,105
You think I should do it.

2811
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:25,203
You gotta let me keep
you out of prison.

2812
02:03:25,228 --> 02:03:26,383
You've seen what's on
those hard drives.

2813
02:03:26,408 --> 02:03:26,945
Yeah.

2814
02:03:27,344 --> 02:03:27,805
Yeah.

2815
02:03:27,838 --> 02:03:29,031
It's a lot more than
a little color.

2816
02:03:29,056 --> 02:03:30,728
Yeah, but complete immunity.

2817
02:03:30,875 --> 02:03:32,102
All right? You get
all your money back.

2818
02:03:32,127 --> 02:03:34,141
You'll be the first defendant
to walk out of a courtroom

2819
02:03:34,172 --> 02:03:35,570
better off than
when you walked in.

2820
02:03:35,625 --> 02:03:37,282
Careers will be ruined.

2821
02:03:37,524 --> 02:03:38,633
Families.

2822
02:03:38,813 --> 02:03:40,414
Wives, lives on both coasts--

2823
02:03:40,439 --> 02:03:42,563
Hey, when a rich
guy goes to jail

2824
02:03:42,588 --> 02:03:43,734
he spreads his money around.

2825
02:03:43,759 --> 02:03:45,993
His-his lawyer knows how
to take care of that.

2826
02:03:46,018 --> 02:03:47,805
He spreads his money around.

2827
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:49,164
You don't have any!

2828
02:03:49,201 --> 02:03:52,084
The composition of female
inmates in federal prison--

2829
02:03:52,109 --> 02:03:54,224
they did not commit
financial crimes.

2830
02:03:54,249 --> 02:03:55,107
They're drug dealers.

2831
02:03:55,132 --> 02:03:56,967
They get raped
by prison guards.

2832
02:03:57,046 --> 02:04:00,022
You...you will not
be anonymous, Molly.

2833
02:04:00,047 --> 02:04:01,652
You will be a target!

2834
02:04:01,746 --> 02:04:03,308
Children will read their
father's text messages

2835
02:04:03,333 --> 02:04:06,324
saying he wished
he'd never had kids.

2836
02:04:06,521 --> 02:04:07,435
These guys--

2837
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:08,942
These guys, where are they?

2838
02:04:08,966 --> 02:04:11,357
Why are you in this alone?
Where are your friends?

2839
02:04:11,382 --> 02:04:13,076
Where is the one guy saying,

2840
02:04:13,101 --> 02:04:15,912
"Hey, you know, Molly, I know you're
doing everything to save my life,

2841
02:04:15,944 --> 02:04:17,815
what can I do for you?
Let me buy you a sandwich.

2842
02:04:17,855 --> 02:04:19,050
Where are they, Molly?

2843
02:04:19,075 --> 02:04:20,507
You kept their secrets.

2844
02:04:20,585 --> 02:04:21,561
Where are the people
you're protecting

2845
02:04:21,586 --> 02:04:23,772
by not telling the whole
story in the book,

2846
02:04:23,797 --> 02:04:25,499
by settling the
Brad Marion suit,

2847
02:04:25,524 --> 02:04:28,288
by not taking five million
dollars of your own money,

2848
02:04:28,313 --> 02:04:29,429
by going to jail?

2849
02:04:29,454 --> 02:04:30,749
Where did everybody go?!

2850
02:04:30,774 --> 02:04:33,719
It's not their names I'm
protecting, Charlie, it's mine.

2851
02:04:33,751 --> 02:04:36,025
Oh, that's great. Well,
we don't have the luxury

2852
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:38,619
of integrity. You have
to take the deal.

2853
02:04:38,694 --> 02:04:39,475
No.

2854
02:04:39,507 --> 02:04:41,076
You stay out of jail,
you get your money back,

2855
02:04:41,101 --> 02:04:42,796
you pay your debts,
you start a new life.

2856
02:04:42,821 --> 02:04:43,404
No.

2857
02:04:43,429 --> 02:04:46,921
Is this self-imposed punishment
for naming four guys in a book?

2858
02:04:46,946 --> 02:04:47,796
It's not.

2859
02:04:47,821 --> 02:04:48,764
You didn't do anything wrong.

2860
02:04:48,789 --> 02:04:51,803
I threw four people under
the bus for $35,000, Charlie.

2861
02:04:51,828 --> 02:04:53,905
I noticed you kept that out of
your speech to the prosecutor.

2862
02:04:53,930 --> 02:04:55,211
-No, don't do that to me.
-I took advantage

2863
02:04:55,236 --> 02:04:56,522
of gambling addicts.

2864
02:04:56,547 --> 02:04:59,690
Donnie Silverman, my
brilliant find, he lost

2865
02:04:59,715 --> 02:05:01,885
-six million dollars on my table,
-Molly, stop, stop.

2866
02:05:01,977 --> 02:05:03,453
-moved to Florida,
-Uh-huh.

2867
02:05:03,478 --> 02:05:05,125
got a job as a
substitute teacher,

2868
02:05:05,150 --> 02:05:06,273
-and the hanged himself
-Oh!

2869
02:05:06,298 --> 02:05:07,390
-in the shower.
-and that's your fault?

2870
02:05:07,415 --> 02:05:08,922
-Donnie Silverman's dead.
-That's not your fault!

2871
02:05:08,947 --> 02:05:11,961
Harlan Eustice is in jail
in Nevada wishing he was.

2872
02:05:11,986 --> 02:05:13,774
But that's not why
I'm saying no.

2873
02:05:13,799 --> 02:05:14,656
You're not saying no.

2874
02:05:14,681 --> 02:05:16,164
I was named after
my great-grandmother.

2875
02:05:16,189 --> 02:05:16,750
I don't care.

2876
02:05:16,775 --> 02:05:18,258
-Molly Dubin Bloom
-We will stay here all night

2877
02:05:18,283 --> 02:05:19,836
-is my name.
-until you understand--

2878
02:05:19,861 --> 02:05:21,025
until you understand

2879
02:05:21,050 --> 02:05:23,548
nobody gives a shit
about your good name.

2880
02:05:23,626 --> 02:05:24,321
I do.

2881
02:05:24,346 --> 02:05:25,088
Why?

2882
02:05:25,113 --> 02:05:26,487
-Because!
-Why?

2883
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:28,190
-Because!
-Tell me why!

2884
02:05:28,215 --> 02:05:30,471
Because it's all I have left.

2885
02:05:31,714 --> 02:05:33,995
Because it's my name.

2886
02:05:37,550 --> 02:05:41,081
"And I'll never have another."

2887
02:05:45,597 --> 02:05:48,042
Now you read <i>The Crucible?</i>

2888
02:05:48,597 --> 02:05:51,308
Yeah, everyone's right, it's great.

2889
02:05:51,395 --> 02:05:52,378
It is great.

2890
02:06:00,270 --> 02:06:01,871
I want to go into the courtroom

2891
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:05,129
and plead guilty.

2892
02:06:06,082 --> 02:06:07,192
No deals.

2893
02:06:07,781 --> 02:06:08,945
No trades.

2894
02:06:14,031 --> 02:06:15,390
And you're very sure?

2895
02:06:16,859 --> 02:06:17,853
Yes.

2896
02:06:20,439 --> 02:06:21,783
All rise.

2897
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:24,182
<i>The business of the court began.</i>

2898
02:06:25,029 --> 02:06:28,358
<i>We stood for the Honorable
Judge Dustin Foxman</i>

2899
02:06:28,615 --> 02:06:30,561
<i>and counsel entered their
names for the record.</i>

2900
02:06:30,647 --> 02:06:32,686
Assistant U.S. Attorney
Harrison Wellstone

2901
02:06:33,342 --> 02:06:34,428
<i>The docket was called</i>

2902
02:06:35,597 --> 02:06:38,652
<i>and some pro forma instructions
were given to counsel.</i>

2903
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:40,542
<i>And I was asked a series
of questions from a script</i>

2904
02:06:40,567 --> 02:06:42,199
<i> the judge had in front of him.</i>
-What is your full name?

2905
02:06:42,224 --> 02:06:43,550
Molly Dubin Bloom.

2906
02:06:43,575 --> 02:06:44,664
How old are you?

2907
02:06:44,735 --> 02:06:47,180
Have you taken any drugs,
medicine or pills

2908
02:06:47,205 --> 02:06:50,149
or had any alcoholic beverages
in the past 48 hours?

2909
02:06:50,183 --> 02:06:51,049
Sudafed.

2910
02:06:51,105 --> 02:06:53,855
Is there anything about the
reasons for you taking Sudafed

2911
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:55,254
that would interfere with
what's going on here today?

2912
02:06:55,279 --> 02:06:57,519
<i>87 questions he was
required to ask</i>

2913
02:06:57,544 --> 02:06:59,300
<i>before he'd permit
me to plead guilty.</i>

2914
02:06:59,325 --> 02:07:00,544
Is your mind clear
today, Ms. Bloom?

2915
02:07:00,569 --> 02:07:01,255
It is.

2916
02:07:01,302 --> 02:07:02,979
Do you understand
what's going on here today?

2917
02:07:03,041 --> 02:07:03,667
I do.

2918
02:07:03,692 --> 02:07:06,193
Under the Constitution and
laws of the United States

2919
02:07:06,218 --> 02:07:08,646
you have a right to plead to
the charges in the indictment,

2920
02:07:08,865 --> 02:07:10,060
do you understand that?

2921
02:07:10,085 --> 02:07:10,732
Yes, Your Honor.

2922
02:07:10,757 --> 02:07:12,896
-And do you understand that?
-Yes, sir.

2923
02:07:12,925 --> 02:07:15,932
At that trial you would be
presumed to be innocent

2924
02:07:15,957 --> 02:07:17,940
and would not have to prove
that you were innocent,

2925
02:07:17,965 --> 02:07:19,909
-do you understand that?
-Yes, sir.

2926
02:07:19,934 --> 02:07:21,965
Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, sir.

2927
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:24,488
If you plead guilty
and I accept your plea,

2928
02:07:24,693 --> 02:07:26,607
you will give up
your right to appeal

2929
02:07:26,632 --> 02:07:29,107
along with all other
rights I've enumerated,

2930
02:07:29,506 --> 02:07:30,803
do you understand?

2931
02:07:30,858 --> 02:07:31,670
Yes, sir.

2932
02:07:31,703 --> 02:07:34,530
Do you understand that you
are charged in count 20

2933
02:07:34,555 --> 02:07:36,780
with operating an illegal
gambling business

2934
02:07:36,805 --> 02:07:39,554
in violation of Title 18
United States

2935
02:07:39,579 --> 02:07:42,795
Code Sections 1955 and 2?

2936
02:07:42,820 --> 02:07:43,920
Yes, I understand.

2937
02:07:43,989 --> 02:07:46,372
Understanding everything
you've been told,

2938
02:07:46,551 --> 02:07:48,317
do you now wish to enter a plea?

2939
02:07:48,624 --> 02:07:49,656
Yes, sir.

2940
02:07:50,008 --> 02:07:51,617
How do you plead to the charge?

2941
02:07:52,047 --> 02:07:53,414
Guilty, Your Honor.

2942
02:07:54,617 --> 02:07:56,937
Your plea has been so recorded

2943
02:07:57,687 --> 02:07:59,211
and you may take your seat.

2944
02:07:59,633 --> 02:08:01,898
Before we move to the
sentencing phase,

2945
02:08:01,923 --> 02:08:03,828
I would like a word
with counsel, please.

2946
02:08:07,207 --> 02:08:08,965
<i>And then something happened.</i>

2947
02:08:08,990 --> 02:08:11,558
Pardon me, Mr. Jaffey,
just government counsel.

2948
02:08:14,267 --> 02:08:15,212
Yes, sir.

2949
02:08:20,197 --> 02:08:21,212
What's going on?

2950
02:08:23,512 --> 02:08:24,504
What are they doing?

2951
02:08:30,932 --> 02:08:32,160
Wait for it.

2952
02:08:33,223 --> 02:08:34,216
What?

2953
02:08:38,489 --> 02:08:40,927
Would the defendant please
rise for sentencing.

2954
02:08:45,607 --> 02:08:47,717
Based on all available
information,

2955
02:08:47,857 --> 02:08:49,842
this court manifestly disagrees

2956
02:08:49,867 --> 02:08:52,193
with the government's
sentencing recommendation.

2957
02:08:54,075 --> 02:08:55,669
This courthouse is located

2958
02:08:55,694 --> 02:08:58,006
within spitting distance
of Wall Street.

2959
02:08:58,287 --> 02:09:00,083
I know this from my
personal experience

2960
02:09:00,108 --> 02:09:01,294
trying to spit at it.

2961
02:09:01,529 --> 02:09:03,146
The men and women who
work there will commit

2962
02:09:03,216 --> 02:09:05,247
more serious crimes
by lunchtime today

2963
02:09:05,333 --> 02:09:08,170
than the defendant has
committed in this indictment.

2964
02:09:08,195 --> 02:09:10,770
I simply don't see how
either the people

2965
02:09:10,795 --> 02:09:12,451
or the cause of
justice are served

2966
02:09:12,476 --> 02:09:14,029
by locking Molly Bloom
in prison.

2967
02:09:14,054 --> 02:09:16,928
<i>It was as casual as if he was
ordering lunch off a menu.</i>

2968
02:09:16,953 --> 02:09:17,962
Ms. Bloom,

2969
02:09:18,039 --> 02:09:19,415
this court sentences you

2970
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,611
to two hundred hours
of community service,

2971
02:09:21,927 --> 02:09:25,458
one year of supervised
probation, drug testing

2972
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:27,903
and a two hundred
thousand dollar fine.

2973
02:09:28,450 --> 02:09:29,982
This case is adjourned.

2974
02:09:30,653 --> 02:09:31,903
<i>And that was that.</i>

2975
02:09:34,313 --> 02:09:36,282
<i>It was crying and hugging,</i>

2976
02:09:36,492 --> 02:09:38,078
<i>jokes from my brothers.</i>

2977
02:09:38,241 --> 02:09:40,788
<i>Tough talk about how no one
messes with the Blooms</i>

2978
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:44,311
<i>and level-headed talk about
Christmas miracles.</i>

2979
02:09:45,548 --> 02:09:48,033
<i>Steaks and beer
bought by my father</i>

2980
02:09:48,212 --> 02:09:49,822
<i>and full reenactments.</i>

2981
02:09:50,110 --> 02:09:53,829
<i>And in the middle of it all,
as grateful as you are,</i>

2982
02:09:54,415 --> 02:09:57,235
<i>the reality starts creeping
toward you like the tide.</i>

2983
02:09:59,609 --> 02:10:01,851
<i>And that's the first time
you have the thought...</i>

2984
02:10:03,218 --> 02:10:04,820
<i>"What do I do now?"</i>

2985
02:10:06,212 --> 02:10:07,407
We're gonna race her down.

2986
02:10:07,673 --> 02:10:08,891
We need a tobogan
or a backboard.

2987
02:10:09,142 --> 02:10:10,361
<i>I'm a felon.</i>

2988
02:10:10,523 --> 02:10:13,242
<i>I'm 35 years old, unemployed,</i>

2989
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,672
<i>and pled guilty
in a mob indictment.</i>

2990
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:16,798
People, make way!

2991
02:10:17,352 --> 02:10:18,868
Move away, move away!

2992
02:10:19,201 --> 02:10:21,208
<i>I owe the government close
to two million dollars</i>

2993
02:10:21,233 --> 02:10:24,068
<i>in taxes assessed on
the civil forfeiture</i>

2994
02:10:24,381 --> 02:10:26,373
<i>plus the two hundred
thousand dollar fine.</i>

2995
02:10:26,484 --> 02:10:28,140
<i>And you better believe
they're gonna come get it.</i>

2996
02:10:28,165 --> 02:10:29,054
Is there a pass?

2997
02:10:29,079 --> 02:10:30,078
Come on back, please.

2998
02:10:30,703 --> 02:10:33,187
<i>I have a quarter of a million
dollars in legal bills.</i>

2999
02:10:33,381 --> 02:10:35,413
<i>I don't know what
I'd say in a job interview,</i>

3000
02:10:35,710 --> 02:10:38,436
<i>or if I'll ever be given
a job interview.</i>

3001
02:10:39,267 --> 02:10:41,104
<i>I'll never be allowed
to vote again.</i>

3002
02:10:41,198 --> 02:10:42,651
Gonna need a set of vitals.

3003
02:10:42,924 --> 02:10:44,526
<i>And for some reason,</i>

3004
02:10:44,551 --> 02:10:45,941
<i>I'm not allowed to go to Canada.</i>

3005
02:10:47,401 --> 02:10:48,682
Molly, can you hear us?

3006
02:10:51,283 --> 02:10:52,721
Pelvis is stable.

3007
02:10:54,706 --> 02:10:55,675
Her dad's here.

3008
02:10:55,925 --> 02:10:57,018
What's her LOA?

3009
02:10:57,081 --> 02:10:57,848
Uh, she's comin' around now.

3010
02:10:57,873 --> 02:10:59,168
Open your eyes
if you can hear us.

3011
02:10:59,193 --> 02:10:59,927
She's conscious.

3012
02:10:59,952 --> 02:11:00,825
Molly, what day is it?

3013
02:11:00,850 --> 02:11:02,856
You need to stay down, okay?
You need to go to a hospital.

3014
02:11:03,169 --> 02:11:04,208
What day?

3015
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:06,298
Dad, I'm fine.

3016
02:11:06,378 --> 02:11:07,290
Caution you
not to move, Molly.

3017
02:11:07,315 --> 02:11:08,237
Let go of my arm.

3018
02:11:08,370 --> 02:11:09,792
-Trying to get up, hon?
-Yeah.

3019
02:11:09,824 --> 02:11:10,705
She wants to get up.

3020
02:11:10,730 --> 02:11:13,471
Our cameras can't get in
there, so we don't know--

3021
02:11:13,496 --> 02:11:15,278
I wonder if Tracy's got an
update for us on the ground?

3022
02:11:15,303 --> 02:11:17,169
-She's moving, guys.
-She's moving!

3023
02:11:18,567 --> 02:11:20,309
-You sure you're good?
-Yeah.

3024
02:11:20,334 --> 02:11:21,646
Okay, here we go.

3025
02:11:23,467 --> 02:11:26,029
We can see that she's being
helped to her feet now.

3026
02:11:26,346 --> 02:11:29,041
Molly Bloom is of course
the sister of Jeremy Bloom

3027
02:11:29,066 --> 02:11:31,604
who holds the world's
number one ranking.

3028
02:11:31,706 --> 02:11:34,112
That's her long-time
coach there, Ted Keene

3029
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:35,776
and her father.

3030
02:11:36,492 --> 02:11:39,226
She came back from an injury
when she was just 13.

3031
02:11:40,047 --> 02:11:42,773
You know, you have to wonder
about the psychological toll

3032
02:11:43,008 --> 02:11:45,953
coming that close
only to lose it like that.

3033
02:11:47,060 --> 02:11:48,841
<i>Did anything good come of this?</i>

3034
02:11:49,701 --> 02:11:50,889
<i>Not really.</i>

3035
02:11:54,807 --> 02:11:56,706
<i>But I learned something encouraging.</i>
