I just want a quiet week

- Alone?
When you could be home.

72
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,634
- Yeah, but it's not the same.

73
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,435
Mom's still dealing
with the divorce,

74
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,404
and it's so heartbreaking
watching her go through it.

75

- It has.

starting a new life.

My sister and I, we're not on
the same wavelength.

00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:04,116
- It's hard. I get it.
Families are complicated.

79
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,218
Do you at least have time for
a drink before you head home?

80
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,653
A toast to the holidays?

81
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,255
- Don't have to ask me twice.
- [chuckles]

if that's what you really want.

86
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:25,571

it's all I've asked for.

87
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:26,772
Did he get your list this year?

88
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,006
- Mm.

89
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,141
Who's had time
to think about it?

90
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,543
I'll take my chances.

91
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,680
Although, I wouldn't mind
finding him under my tree.

92
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,381
- Tyler?
- Tyler grant.

93
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,684
Sports commentator on TV.

94
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,152
- Since when do you
like sports?

95
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,355
- Since never.
But I love hearing him talk.

96
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,958
- Tyler loves his fans.
- Wait, do you know him?

97
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,260
- Yeah, no, years ago.

98
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,895
You know that
catchphrase of his?

99
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,564
- "when you can't get
enough sports, I've got more."

100
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,732
- I gave that to him.

101
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,334
- This, I gotta hear.

102
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,436
- Well, it was when
I was interning at mt. Sinai.

103
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,704
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,905
- And I guess
he'd playing hockey.

105
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,373
Came in with a concussion,
needed a doctor.

106
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,642
- I've seen that movie.
Sandra bullock and somebody.

107
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:04,943
- Right?

108
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,745
Yeah, we dated
for a few months.

109
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,215
And then he asked to meet
my parents one Christmas.

110
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,884
- And?
- And I didn't realize it.

111
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,088
But it was so he could get
their blessing and propose.

112
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,157
- Tell me you said yes.
- Nope, don't think so.

113
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,661
- [laughs] so what?
He never popped the question?

114
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,097
- Oh, no, he did.
I turned him down.

115
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,598
- You what?
- I know.

116
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,734
- You're the one
who needed the doctor.

117
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,069
I mean, look at the guy.

118
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,404
- Gosh, you know,

119
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,706
that was, like, the last
really good Christmas.

120
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,074
Before everything changed.

121
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,010
My mom and dad were
still together,

122
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,411
and my sister and I were
inseparable.

123
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,879
It was great.

124
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,515
We were like a real,
bonded family.

125
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,951
- Mm. That's so sweet.

126
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:49,621
Okay, but back to Mr. Sports.
Why did you say no?

127
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,590
- I don't know,
the timing wasn't right.

128
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,860
I was in med school, and he
was breaking into network news.

129
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,461
We took a break for a while,

130
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,264
and then we just decided
the moment had passed.

131
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,633
- Huh. We'll see about that.
- What are you doing?

132
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:02,901
- I'm checking his status.

133
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,703
Maybe there's still time
for you to find him

134
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,139
and plead temporary insanity.

135
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,540
Okay, you're in luck.
He's not married.

136
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,810
But he's in
a "serious relationship."

137
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,245
look.

138
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,813
- Oh, they're still together.
That's nice.

139
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,715
- You knew about this?

140
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,051
Well, whoever she is, she's not
nearly good enough for him.

141
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,419
- [clears throat]
Sabrina.

142
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,720
She speaks five languages,

143
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:22,888
has two master's degrees,

144
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,723
and a book
in the top ten last year.

145
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:27,326
I think she's doing just fine.

146
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,996
I mean, I'm...I'm just guessing.
- Hmm.

147
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,931
So you have been keeping tabs.
- I don't have to!

148
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,766
He's everywhere.
He's hosting the world series,

149
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,469
the bowl games,
cohosting the next Olympics.

he's stalking me.

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,740
- What if he's still
in love with you?

153
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:45,711
- That was a long time ago,
in a galaxy far, far away.

154
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,279
I can't turn back time.

155
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,880
- He even got a new puppy.

156
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,349
Look at this guy.
- What?

157
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,751
Okay, Tyler did not even
like dogs before he met mine.

158
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:56,088
Oh, boomer.
I miss that dog.

159
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,523
- Angie?

160
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,691
- Ben!
- Hey!

161
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,526
- Hi! What are you doing here?

162
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,862
- Oh, my firm's
just up the street.

163
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,330
- What?
I thought you were in Boston.

164
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,799
- No, my company moved me
to Manhattan.

165
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,468
Yeah, last summer.

166
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,270
- Wait, last summer?
You've been here all this time?

167
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,874
- Yes. You know, I've been
meaning to give you a call.

168
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,077
- Hi. I'm Sabrina.

169
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,213
I'm introducing myself because
as soon as you showed up,

170
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,814
she forgot I existed.

171
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,351
- Sorry, I'm just surprised

I want us to find
the perfect tree,

515
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,870

and cover more territory.

516

I'll head over this way.

00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,244
Wait, am I supposed
to say yes this time?

683
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,746
'cause, you know,
last time I said no,

684
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:29,780
which just felt right,
given where we were

685
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,783
in our lives,
but now I don't know.

686
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,119
Is that it? That's it.

687
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,721
- Shepard's ferry!

688
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,625
Next stop.

689
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,127
Shepard's...

690
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,862
- Okay, so I'm gonna do that.

691
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,096
- Ferry.

The sun's barely up.
What are you doing here?

700
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,910
- If I knew,
I would tell you, honestly.

Friend of yours?

back from the repair shop.

Freak walnut-cracking accident.

00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,317
You do not want to know.

a tree impressive enough

708
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,156
- Uh-huh.
- Nothing yet.

709
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:47,324
But there's
another shipment coming,

710
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,759
so we'll see.

711
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:49,827
Is there something
on your mind?

712
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,562
- Oh, so much.

713
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:54,531
- Okay, well, if you need
a friendly ear, we got time.

714
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,534
- It's gonna sound
absolutely crazy.

715
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,937
Totally insane.
[gasps]

716
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,539
maybe that's what's happening.
I've lost my mind.

717
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,075
- Okay, now you have
my attention.

718
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,643
- You know what?
We're not even close anymore,

719
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,045
because you moved
from Boston to Manhattan,

720
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,280
and you didn't even call me.
- What?

721
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,449
- Ugh, but I have to tell
somebody.

722
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:15,319
I have to tell somebody,
because...wait a second.

723
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,954
The train dropped me off here.

724
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,856
Maybe that's a sign.

725
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,390
I'm supposed to tell you!

726
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,725
- Angie, you can
tell me anything!

727
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,060
Remember when you parked
the principal's motorcycle

728
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,394
in his office?

729
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,697
How did you do that anyway?

730
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,165
- The car club did it.

731
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,666
It was just my idea
to take the handlebars off

732
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:31,502
and then roll it in and put it
back together in there.

733
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,837
- That is genius.
- I know. So great.

734
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:36,140
- My point is, who didn't
turn you into school police?

735
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,941
Huh? This guy.

736
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,443
Also, who didn't rat you out
when you skipped class

737
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:40,677
to go see "spider-man"?

738
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:42,212
- That's because you
came with me.

739
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,747
- Right. That's true.

740
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,549
Well, 'cause we had
the same taste in movies.

741
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,117
- Yeah. And music.
And ice cream.

742
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:49,286
- Yep. Oh, well, except for
your weird sprinkle obsession.

743
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,454
I will never understand that...
- what's your point?

744
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,622
Don't talk about sprinkles.

745
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,825
- My...my point is
you can trust me.

746
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:58,762
So whatever you want to say,
just blurt it out.

747
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,230
- I'm from the future!

748
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,065
- And you're here
to terminate me?

749
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,934
- Ben, be serious.
- What? You started it!

750
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,636
- Listen to the words that are
coming out of my mouth.

751
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,071
It's totally true!

752
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,774
I am from the future!

753
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:15,245
- And that's, like,
a metaphor for...

754
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,747
- No, Ben, stay with me!

755
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,782
Okay, I got on a train
to Yonkers last night,

756
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,517
and the year was 2021.

757
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:24,087
Instead of Yonkers,
it dropped me off here and now.

758
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,056
- [quietly] okay, I don't...
I mean...

759
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,991
- this was a mistake.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

760
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,693
Wait, wait, hold on.

761
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:32,796
Tell me again.
Slowly. And over food.

762
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,833
- You always think about food!
- Well, are you not hungry?

763
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:43,540
- Morning.
- Hey, Tyler. How'd you sleep?

764
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:44,608
- Oh, just fine.

765
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,947
Boomer keeps
following me around everywhere.

766
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:54,484
- He likes you. French toast?
- I hear it's world-famous.

767
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,154
Sure, yeah, hook me up.
Haven't seen Angie yet.

768
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,089
- She's up and out
already this morning.

769
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:00,657
Always the early bird.

770
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,426
- Actually, that gives me
a chance to ask you something.

771
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,627
- Oh, yeah?

772
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,062
- About me and your daughter.

773
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:08,031
- And what might that be?

774
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:09,499
- Okay. Wait. Hold on.

775
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,068
Can we go back to the part

776
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,637
where I'm the incredibly
successful corporate lawyer

777
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,105
in new york?

778
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,107
I thought I was gonna
go into family law.

779
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,943
- I know, but somewhere along
the way, that changes,

780
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,211
and I don't know how.

781
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:23,180
- That's all I ever
wanted to do!

782
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,514
You know how important
family is to me.

783
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,884
I can't imagine
changing my mind about that.

784
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,485
- Ben, I know how this sounds.

785
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,520
God, I wish...I wish there
was a way I could prove it.

786
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,823
I mean...

787
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:35,259
- Show me
your driver's license.

788
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:36,827
Is it a holograph?

789
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:40,230
Are you about to pop up in 3d,
like princess Leia?

790
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:43,066
Come on, say,
"help me, Ben lee."

791
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,701
- you're enjoying this,
aren't you?

792
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:47,437
It's ten years, Ben,
not ten-hundred.

793
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,473
And no, I don't have it,
because when I woke up here,

794
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,974
everything was as it was.

795
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,175
Like, look at this phone.

796
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:53,443
I mean,
it's practically an antique.

797
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,312
- An antique?
That's the latest model.

798
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,147
That's newer than mine.

799
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,316
Oh, wait. Yeah.

800
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,051
Okay, there probably
are a couple upgrades.

801
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,320
- Yeah. They get bigger.
- That doesn't...

802
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,055
oh, thank you.

803
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,857
- Thanks.
- Well, let's get some food.

804
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,359
Ooh, tell me
what I'm gonna order.

805
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:11,094
- Ben, I don't remember
everything.

806
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:12,829
Do you remember what you had
for breakfast ten years ago?

807
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:15,365
- Pancakes, bacon,
orange juice.

808
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,833
- Okay.

809
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:18,435
- It's 'cause I have that
every morning.

810
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,836
- Oh, geez.

811
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,438
- The old you used to love
that about me.

812
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,710
- Ooh, the new york giants
win the super bowl.

813
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,011
- No!
- Yep.

814
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,013
- No!
Against Brady and the pats?

815
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,381
No! They're undefeated.

816
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,849
- No. But it's not pretty.
Trust me.

817
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:33,984
- Oh, so I'm supposed
to wait around

818
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,719
until then to see
if you're right?

819
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,821
- Okay. We make gingerbread
houses tonight.

820
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,256
- Yep.
Your mom invited me over.

821
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,124
- But I knew that.

822
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,059
- Well, she always
invites me over.

823
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,226
That's no mystery.

824
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:44,861
- Wait a second.

825
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:46,964
You choke on a gumdrop today,
and I save your life.

826
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,332
- Well, I would hope so.
You're in med school.

827
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,766
That's, like, the job.

828
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,369
- Ben, it's not that
I save your life,

829
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,004
it's that I know
that you choke.

830
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,539
- Oh, okay!

831
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:56,873
Wait, well, what if I don't now
that you told me?

832
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,375
- You will.
- Or will I?

833
00:32:58,444 --> 00:32:59,643
- Yeah.
- You sure?

834
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:00,978
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

835
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,579
I think I have the power
to change the future.

836
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,114
- Use it wisely.

837
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,952
- I put a lot of work into it,
but, you know,

838
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,822
I finally sent in my audition
tape, and now I wait.

839
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:15,158
It's national news, so even
an interview would be amazing.

840
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,960
- I don't understand
any of that,

841
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,930
but I would certainly hire you
if I had a network.

842
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,498
- Maybe you'll get one
for Christmas, mom.

843
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,500
It's never too late.
- Perhaps.

844
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,235
- Eventually I'm gonna need
a catchphrase, you know,

845
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,204
something memorable, like...

846
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,840
- "when you can't get
enough sports, I've got more."

847
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,742
- hey, that's good.

848
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:34,711
- No. It's close. But...

849
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:36,713
- Why don't you think about it?
It might grow on you.

850
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,348
Hey, where's dad?

851
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,816
- I don't know.
He's around here somewhere.

852
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,952
He's probably
shoveling the sidewalk

853
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,487
or cleaning the attic
of something.

854
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,456
He needs his alone time
right now.

855
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:49,526
- And missing this?
That's not like him.

856
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:52,729
- Your father's his own man.
Don't ask me to explain him.

857
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:55,665
- Hey.
Does anyone want gumdrops?

858
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,368
Gumdrop, anyone?
They are delicious.

859
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,604
- No, we're good.
Why don't you have one?

860
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:03,907
- Oh, maybe I will.
No.

861
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:07,611
- No?
- Or yes. No. Maybe later.

862
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:10,380
- What is up with you two?
- That's just Ben being Ben.

863
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:11,548
He thinks he's funny.

864
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,016
- You always thought
I was funny.

865
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,318
The senior play?
I can still hear you laughing.

866
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:16,253
- That's because your pants
fell down

867
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,687
during your big speech.

868
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,290
Who knew George Washington
had spongebob boxers?

869
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:23,493
- Okay. Okay.
It was laundry day.

870
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:27,064
- Honestly, you guys,
they've been like this forever.

871
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,565
- Yeah, please ignore him.

872
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,566
- Yes.
- Hey, how's it going, Henrik?

873
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:30,734
- Good.
- Yeah?

874
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,736
- He's a one-kid
construction crew.

875
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:33,937
- Imagine what
he could accomplish

876
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:35,205
with a brother or sister.

877
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,974
We all heard him ask Santa.

878
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,043
- Hey, bud, how about
a candy cane fence?

879
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:41,711
[clears throat]

880
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,779
- Ben, are you okay?

881
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,384
- I think he's choking.
- What are you choking on, Ben?

882
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,319
- What do we do?
Hit him on the back?

883
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:50,454
- He's definitely choking.
- What do we do?

884
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,721
- The gumdrops.
It's the gumdrops.

885
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,223
- Oh, is it the gumdrops?

886
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,691
- What do...we hit him
on the back.

887
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:55,859
- He can't breathe.
- Hit him on the back?

888
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,861
No. I think you have to...
- Angie, Angie.

889
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,329
- He can't breathe.
- Are you choking?

890
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,269
- [coughs]

891
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,672
[gasping]

892
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,773
thank you.

893
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,108
- That's a relief.

894
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,776
- Who could have seen
that coming?

895
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,911
- Right? It's like you'd have
to be from the future.

896
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,515
- Gross.

897
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,151
- I told you!
- Okay.

898
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:23,320
So you have until
Christmas day,

899
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,321
or what, you're stuck here?

900
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,622
- Well, he said Christmas eve,

901
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:26,690
but I think all
I have to do to fix it

902
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:27,691
is say yes tonight.

903
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:28,725
- Say yes to what?

904
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,759
- To Tyler's proposal.

905
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,862
Last time I said no.

906
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:33,897
- Wait, wait, you're saying...
- Oh, you don't know that yet.

907
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,332
- You're gonna marry Tyler?

908
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,900
I mean, are you sure
that's what you want?

909
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,735
- What, is that
such a wild idea?

910
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,303
- Well, I
kind of thought that...

911
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,305
- what? What'd you think?

912
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:45,609
- I thought that...
- oh, oh, you and me. Oh, Ben.

913
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,277
If everyone who loved
Coldplay and lasagna

914
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,278
wound up together...

915
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,313
Besides, we tried dating.

916
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,616
- Well, you didn't really
take it seriously.

917
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,851
- Are you joking me?
You didn't take it seriously!

918
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:57,854
Plus, we're friends now, Ben,
and that feels right.

919
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,989
Right?

920
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:04,661
Now that works for us,
right, Ben?

921
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:12,469
- If you're worried, don't be.
- Oh. I...oh. Not worried.

922
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:15,939
- Okay. But if you are.
[phone rings]

923
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,741
- sorry.

924
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,543
Tyler grant.

925
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,077
Hey! Yeah, I've been hoping
to hear from you.

926
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,647
- So you think the entire
Christmas universe

927
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,649
arranged all of this...
- Mm-hmm.

928
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,684
- So you can come back
and marry Tyler?

929
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,152
- Well, nothing else
makes sense!

930
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:30,620
- And you think
that makes sense?

931
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,656
- Yes!
Tonight, he took me to Donovan.

932
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,258
Well, no, sorry,
he takes me to Donovan...

933
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:37,093
you know what I mean.
- Yeah. Expensive.

934
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:39,429
I'm impressed.
Or, like, I will be impressed.

935
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:41,831
Or I have...bugh. Bugh!
Now you have me doing it.

936
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,200
- So he's gonna take me there,

937
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:44,734
and he puts a ring
in my champagne glass.

938
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,537
- Cliché. But...sorry.

939
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,739
- I think it's sweet.
So I'm gonna say yes,

940
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:52,309
and then I think everything
should just go back to normal.

941
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:55,212
- Sure. As if anything with you
is ever normal.

942
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:57,080
- You see, this is why
we never worked out.

943
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:04,087
Whew.

944
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:07,891
- So how was your meal?

945
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,793
- I mean, amazing.
All seven courses.

946
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,262
Gosh, I forgot how good
the food was here.

947
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:13,763
- Have you been here before?

948
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,865
- No,
I just mean from the reviews.

949
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,701
You know what,
I can honestly say

950
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,269
I've only ever been here
with you.

951
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,404
- Good. Because I want
tonight to be special.

952
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,406
- Oh?

953
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,976
- I told you there was a reason
for this dinner tonight.

954
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,277
A surprise.

955
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,779
- Oh?
I wonder what it could be.

956
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:32,115
- Thank you.

957
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,783
- No, but seriously,
what is it,

958
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:34,818
'cause this is just champagne.

959
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:38,722
- Yeah. To celebrate...

960
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,523
My new job!

961
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,858
- Your what?

962
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,260
- Angie, they called me
this afternoon,

963
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:44,661
while you were out
in the snow with Santa.

964
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:47,063
They loved my audition tapes.
My interviews.

965
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,966
My catchphrase.
Well, your catchphrase.

966
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:51,368
- Yeah, no, I'm sure they did.

967
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,103
You'll develop a whole show

968
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,739
around it someday
in the future.

969
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,574
- I'm going from local
to national.

970
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,177
I mean, can you believe that?
- I cannot.

971
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:04,047
I'm very happy for you, Tyler.
That's wonderful.

972
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,749
- There's only one catch.
I do have to go to the city

973
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,984
first thing tomorrow
to seal the deal.

974
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,352
- Wait, you're leaving?
- Just for the day.

975
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:13,523
But what a reason
to celebrate, right? [chuckles]

976
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:15,325
I mean, bet you didn't see
that one coming tonight, huh?

977
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,761
- I did not. At all.

978
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:21,931
- Ooh, that's good.

979
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:31,675

981
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,079
- hey, honey.

982
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,981
Tyler's packing upstairs.
Is everything okay?

983
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,417
- Yeah, he got that job.
The promotion that he wanted?

984
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,118
He's gotta go sign contracts.

985
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,887
But he'll be back
for aunt Myrt's party.

986
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,555
- He wouldn't want
to miss that!

987
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,857
And the sing-along.
And the lighting of the star.

988
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:53,863
Did you two have
a nice time tonight?

989
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,765
- It wasn't exactly
what I expected,

990
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:58,435
but yeah, it was nice.
I need your finger.

991
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,136
- Oh. Good.

992
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,005
Your sister
just put Henrik to bed.

993
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,774
That boy has so much energy.

994
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,876
If there were two of them...

995
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:10,280
- She's not...she can't be...
- no.

996
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:13,683
- Right. Yeah.

997
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,152
- They've been trying
for a long time.

998
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,955
In vitro.
She didn't tell you?

999
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,557
- No.

1000
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:23,393
- Well, between you and me,
it's not going so well.

1001
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,728
I'm sure
she's just trying to find

1002
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,964
the right time to tell you.
- Yeah.

1003
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:31,801
How about you, mom?

1004
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:33,036
Everything okay
with you and dad?

1005
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:34,537
- Why do you ask?

1006
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,139
- I don't know,
he's very distant this year.

1007
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,941
He's always off
doing something.

1008
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:41,611
- Yeah.
That's just him right now.

1009
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,947
You know, we'll be fine.

1010
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:47,217
The season brings up
a lot of things in people.

1011
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,461
Look at that.

1012
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:01,765
Dreams we have when we're young
just sometimes don't turn out

1013
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,168
the way we'd hoped.

1014
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,669
- That's the dress
in my closet.

1015
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,271
- Yeah, I put some of
my old things in there.

1016
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,406
I hope you don't mind.

1017
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:11,408
- You look the same, mom.

1018
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:14,878
- Wouldn't it be nice

1019
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,747
if something things stayed
the same?

1020
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:19,282
- I love you, mom.

1021
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:22,719
- Love you.

1022
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:31,227
- Where's Henrik?
- He's out like a light.

1023
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,797
- Oh.

1024
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:36,966
I spoke to the doctor.

1025
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,235
- You're only telling me
this now?

1026
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:40,437
- He called right
before dinner.

1027
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:41,805
This is the first chance
we've had to talk.

1028
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,473
- Okay, and?

1029
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:49,646
- The two remaining embryos
didn't make it to day five.

1030
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:54,851
- And those were all we had.
So that's it?

1031
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,319
- He wants us to come in
after the holidays

1032
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:59,422
to discuss next steps.

1033
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:03,126
- Peter, it feels like
the end of the road.

1034
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:06,696
- It's not the end.
Not necessarily.

1035
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:10,333
- It was so easy with Henrik.
Why is it so hard now?

1036
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,381
- You heard.

1037
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:28,384
- Did not mean to eavesdrop.
Kristen, I'm so sorry.

1038
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,854
- So are we.
- I could have helped!

1039
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,889
I'm a doctor
at a major Manhattan hospital

1040
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,491
with connections
and relationships.

1041
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,693
- You're only a med student.

1042
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,863
- Right, my point is,

1043
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:43,766
why didn't you tell me
what you were going through?

1044
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,768
- We've never had
that kind of relationship.

1045
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:48,905
The sister thing.
Where we do each other's hair,

1046
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,642
talk about boys,
heartaches, all that.

1047
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,744
- But that's not us?

1048
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:58,014
- Come on, Angie,
you've never taken the time

1049
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,516
to ask about my life.

1050
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,818
It's always been about yours,
which, I admit,

1051
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,087
is more interesting.

1052
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:07,524
- Wow.
That's really how you see me?

1053
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,226
I mean, if I was busy during
med school and interning...

1054
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:13,263
- there's a disconnect.
Like with Tyler.

1055
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:15,131
If it hadn't been for mom,

1056
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:18,468
I wouldn't have known
till you showed up with him.

1057
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:19,769
- Right.

1058
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:25,174
- Is he the one, you think?

1059
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,744
- He was gonna propose tonight.
At least I thought he was.

1060
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:31,214
- But he didn't?
- No, he didn't.

1061
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,851
Anyway, no,
we're talking about you.

1062
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:39,522
I am gonna try really hard,
promise, to be a better sister.

1063
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:48,064
- Maybe it's because of Ben,
why he didn't propose.

1064
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,034
He sees how you two are
with each other.

1065
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,437
- You think Tyler's jealous?
- It's pretty obvious.

1066
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:57,707
Ben's good-looking,
funny, single.

1067
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:01,544
- Eh, he's fine.
- You've been friends forever.

1068
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:02,979
It wouldn't be a problem
if he had a girlfriend.

1069
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,181
But he doesn't.

1070
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,886
- But he could.

1071
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,889
- Okay, hopefully this tree
will do.

1072
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,825
- Ooh, it's absolutely perfect!
- Ben, you remember Chloe

1073
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,794
- of course! Hi.

1074
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:20,663
- Hey. So I hear we're dating.

1075
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,833
- That is what Angie tells me.

1076
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,935
If that's okay with you.
- Oh, absolutely.

1077
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,071
Now I have a cute date
for the Christmas party,

1078
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,939
plus Angie said I could stay
in her at the moment for a week

1079
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:31,474
while she's away
for the summer.

1080
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:33,610
So honestly,
a couple of days pretending

1081
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:36,245
is totally worth it for me.
- Okay.

1082
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,513
- Sorry, I know this
is really strange, you guys,

1083
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:38,748
but it's really
gonna help me out a lot.

1084
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,650
- Yeah.
Are you sure that the reason

1085
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:42,652
Tyler didn't propose
the other night is me?

1086
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,120
- Yeah. It's crazy, right?

1087
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:45,254
I mean,
I think he's just...you know,

1088
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,856
we've always been friends.

1089
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:48,291
We'll always be friends.
Till you move to Manhattan

1090
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:49,759
and you don't call me
for six months.

1091
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,594
- I would never do that!
- But you do.

1092
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,396
Anyway, I think that
if you had a girlfriend

1093
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:55,031
he'd be less threatened.
Enter...

1094
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,566
- Chloe!

1095
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,434
Okay, so I'm feeling like,
for the Christmas party,

1096
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,570
we could do a little
matchy-matchy cute

1097
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,839
little color coordination,
and then for new year's eve...

1098
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,440
- Okay.
- Maybe we could go metallic.

1099
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,409
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.
No, sorry.

1100
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:08,911
I kind of thought this
was, like, only for the week?

1101
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:11,314
- Oh, we'll see about that.

1102
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:12,582
- Uh...
- Oh.

1103
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:14,851
- What?
Show me where this goes.

1104
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:17,654
- Okay.
Right this way, boyfriend.

1105
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:18,921
Can I call you that?

1106
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,323
Should I just stick with Ben?
Benny?

1107
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:21,958
- Ben's fine.
Benji!

1108
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,527
Ah, good thing I took that
improv class last semester!

1109
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:25,862
Right?

1110
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,263
- You are getting a kick
out of this, aren't you?

1111
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:29,666
- So very much.

1112
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:32,068
I can't carry this by myself!

1113
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:33,069
- Ooh.
- All right.

1114
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,771
- Okay, I'm gonna let you...

1115
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:35,872
- Oh, this looks like
an important one.

1116
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,740
- Front and center.
- Up, like, here?

1117
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,008
- Yeah.

1118
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:40,176
- I didn't even know
they were dating.

1119
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:41,577
- Oh, it's a...it's a new thing.

1120
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:43,546
I don't think it's serious,
aunt Myrt.

1121
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:45,648
- Oh. Funny.

1122
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:48,184
I always thought you and Ben
would wind up together.

1123
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:49,852
- You too.

1124
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,888
Maybe I need to get us t-shirts
that say "just friends."

1125
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,389
- [laughs]

1126
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:56,459
the very best relationships
start out that way.

1127
00:44:56,528 --> 00:45:00,496
My late husband was my best
friend before we were married.

1128
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:01,864
- What's in this guy?

1129
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,001
- Oh, be careful with that box.

1130
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,470
Those ornaments are from
my honeymoon in Austria.

1131
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:10,006
Absolutely irreplaceable.

1132
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:13,409
- Okay. I didn't...kid gloves,
aunt Myrt.

1133
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:17,780
- Oh, you're kidding, right?

1134
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:18,748
She's kidding, right?

1135
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,555
- Gosh, mom really needs
all this stuff?

1136
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,623
- I know.

1137
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:28,925
We could probably gift-wrap
the whole town, couldn't we?

1138
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,526
- Yeah, seriously.

1139
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:31,627
- You know your mom.
She loves this stuff.

1140
00:45:31,663 --> 00:45:33,463
Better too much
than not enough.

1141
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:34,597
- But I thought she was gonna
come with us

1142
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:37,633
so that we could go
to lunch after.

1143
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:39,235
- We tend to split up
the errands these days.

1144
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,504
- Well, yeah, I noticed.
What's up with that?

1145
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,206
You two were connected
at the hip all the time.

1146
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,174
- You know, ang,
when you been together

1147
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,843
as long as
your mother and I have,

1148
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:48,144
things change.

1149
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,012
Small stuff starts to matter.

1150
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,949
She likes romantic comedies,
I like mysteries.

1151
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:54,784
I like going out,
she likes staying in.

1152
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:56,319
It's to be expected.

1153
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:59,422
So you bend, bargain,
you adjust.

1154
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,324
Did think things would be
a little different, though,

1155
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,826
once you two kids
left the house.

1156
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,695
Get back to being
just us again.

1157
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:08,798
Nothing for you
to worry about, though.

1158
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:09,866
Boop!

1159
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:13,069
- Are you sure, dad?

1160
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,874
- You know what, I think
I left my wallet at the store.

1161
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,475
I'll be right back, honey.

1162
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:23,546
- How did I not see
this before?

1163
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:26,582
<i> [soft music]</i>

1164
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:27,884
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

1165
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,886
- hey, there.

1166
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,955
- God, you have got
to stop doing that.

1167
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:35,091
- What's going on
with your ticket?

1168
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:39,195
- Ugh.
- Still no?

1169
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,030
- Please, you have to help me.

1170
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:45,434
Look, I admit, it was wonderful
at first, a Christmas miracle.

1171
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,336
But nothing's what I remember.

1172
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:49,839
I mean,
Kristen and I aren't close,

1173
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:51,374
and mom and dad,
they're drifting apart,

1174
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:55,344
and Tyler hasn't proposed,
Ben is being Ben.

1175
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:57,213
Please, you have to help me!

1176
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:01,384
- Well, I'm so sorry,
but it's not up to me.

1177
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,554
Well, will you look at that?

1178
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:07,023
Shepard's ferry.

1179
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:08,057
- Again?

1180
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:10,893
- This is Christmastime.

1181
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:12,929
Give it a go.

1182
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:19,936
- Tyler, I'm so glad
you made it back

1183
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,070
in time for the white elephant.

1184
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:22,538
- I'm so happy to be
back for it.

1185
00:47:22,574 --> 00:47:23,840
Can someone explain
how this works?

1186
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:26,909
- Yeah, it's
a white elephant gift exchange.

1187
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:29,512
- A Reynolds family tradition.
- Yeah, we all bought gifts.

1188
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,280
Silly things, or something
someone's given us,

1189
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:32,615
and we all open them in turn,

1190
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,350
and then...so, we can either
keep what we got,

1191
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:35,818
or we can trade it
with someone else.

1192
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,587
- Right, until
absolutely no one is happy

1193
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:39,589
with what they have.
[laughter]

1194
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:41,190
- you'll get the hang of it.

1195
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:43,092
But until then, you guys have
to eat some cookies,

1196
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:44,360
because I've been baking
all day.

1197
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:46,062
- Nobody bakes like you,
Evelyn.

1198
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,664
- Thank you.

1199
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,336
- Here you go.
- Oh, such a provider.

1200
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,304
Oh, isn't my boyfriend
just the sweetest?

1201
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,639
Any day now he's probably

1202
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:59,609
gonna pop the question,
right, sweetie?

1203
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:02,612
- I'm learning that pretty much
anything is possible.

1204
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,547
- How about that?

1205
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,415
- This is my contribution.
Angie.

1206
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,351
- Thank you, sis.

1207
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,318
Mm.

1208
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:14,323
- Isn't it funny?
- Oh, my gosh.

1209
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:17,026
Ben, it's the frosty
the snowman jewelry box.

1210
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:18,261
- I thought it was
from Kristen.

1211
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:20,296
- Oh, I found it in the attic

1212
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:22,632
when I was pulling down
the ornaments.

1213
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,700
Sorry if...
- oh, no, no, it's...I mean,

1214
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:27,436
I gave that to Angie,
like, way back when.

1215
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:29,005
- How long ago?

1216
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,542
- Well, here's a hint.
Used to hold my candy jewelry.

1217
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,445
- Is that all that's in there?
- Yeah, just the bracelet. Why?

1218
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:39,115
- Okay, who's next?

1219
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:43,552
- We win.
- We won.

1220
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:46,389
- You know what?
- All right.

1221
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,257
- Almost beat you.
[laughter]

1222
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:51,227
- oh! You ladies picked
a bad day for a snowball fight.

1223
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:53,896
The old flamethrower's
feeling pretty good today.

1224
00:48:53,965 --> 00:48:55,197
- All right, well,
we'll see about that.

1225
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,801
- We will.

1226
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:01,270
- This is your last chance
to back out, ladies.

1227
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:03,906
- Feel like there should be
some penalty for trash-talking.

1228
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:05,274
- Yeah.

1229
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,842
- Hey, if it's all right
with you guys,

1230
00:49:06,878 --> 00:49:08,377
I'd like to throw
the first pitch.

1231
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:09,745
- Ooh, a sports reference.
I love it.

1232
00:49:09,814 --> 00:49:15,451
- Here we go. Angie.

1233
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:17,186
- What is this?

1234
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:18,988
- Playing that hockey game
was the best thing I ever did.

1235
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:20,990
- You got a concussion.
- Yeah, I did.

1236
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:23,592
And it brought me right to you.
- Uh-huh.

1237
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:28,230
- Ang, we make a great team.
- Yeah?

1238
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:29,532
- We're like the Miami dolphins
in '72.

1239
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,434
- That great, huh?
- That great!

1240
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:34,704
And I want us to go on forever,
like the patriots in '07.

1241
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:38,874
- No, I get it. Me too!
- So?

1242
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:40,910
- Oh. So...so I think you're
supposed to ask a question.

1243
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:43,980
- Oh, yeah, right, of course.
- It's happening!

1244
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:45,214
- I spoke to your dad
the other day.

1245
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:48,184
- Aww.
- He's cool with it.

1246
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:50,519
- And?
- And...

1247
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:52,722
Angie, will you marry me?

1248
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:55,057
- Yes! Yes, I will!
I thought you'd never ask!

1249
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:58,594
[cheers, laughter]

1250
00:49:58,629 --> 00:49:59,996
- we're getting married!
- Married!

1251
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:02,131
- Oh, my god!

1252
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,766
All right, hey,
drinks on me, you guys!

1253
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:11,073
- Hey.

1254
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:13,576
Um, I just want to say

1255
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:15,745
all I want
is for you to be happy.

1256
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:19,949
And if that's with Tyler
or whoever, I am there for you.

1257
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:22,418
I mean, I'll always
be there for you.

1258
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:25,488
- Thanks, Ben.

1259
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:28,357
- How's your ticket?
No return date?

1260
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:29,592
- I don't understand.

1261
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:32,561
Tyler proposed,
but it's still blank.

1262
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:34,430
- Maybe...
- you guys, it's cold out here!

1263
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:36,632
Come on, let's go celebrate!

1264
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:42,972
- These newfangled lights.

1265
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:45,307
Keep burning out faster
than I can keep up with them.

1266
00:50:45,343 --> 00:50:46,776
- You sure you don't want me
to do that for you?

1267
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:48,544
- Yeah, I'm good.
I'm an old hand at this.

1268
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:54,483
- Hey, mom.
Should dad be doing that?

1269
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:57,987
- Have you tried talking
to your father lately?

1270
00:50:58,022 --> 00:50:59,355
- I'm worried about you two.

1271
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,590
- Angie, leave it alone.
We're fine, or we will be.

1272
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:04,360
Let's talk about you.
You just got engaged!

1273
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:05,494
- No, don't change the subject!

1274
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,396
I'm serious.
When did this start?

1275
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:09,799
- [sighs] I don't know.

1276
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:11,200
With you girls grown and gone,

1277
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,836
we...we had to talk
to each other.

1278
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:17,306
And I guess,
after all this time,

1279
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,842
we're discovering there isn't
really that much more to say.

1280
00:51:19,877 --> 00:51:22,511
- Well, you'd never know it
from this picture.

1281
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:28,150
You guys are so happy here.
Where was this?

1282
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:30,286
- Aunt Myrt's first
Christmas party.

1283
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,787
It's where I met your father.

1284
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:33,622
- How did I not know that?
That's where you guys met?

1285
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,858
- Was such a romantic evening.

1286
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:38,294
Myrt had hired
these Victorian carolers,

1287
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,663
and your father
was so handsome.

1288
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:43,599
It wasn't just that,
it was the way he looked at me.

1289
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:47,470
- That's cute.
- Yeah.

1290
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:50,272
We danced by the light
of the Christmas tree,

1291
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:51,440
all those colors.

1292
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:57,146
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could turn back the clock

1293
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:59,849
and do it all over again?

1294
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:02,451
- Yes. It would.

1295
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,724
Hey.

1296
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:10,292
Where's my father?
- Oh, he's up there somewhere.

1297
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:11,894
Said he needed
to check something

1298
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:13,395
on the other side of the house.

1299
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,097
- Well, he's gonna break
his neck one Christmas!

1300
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,566
Oh, wait, no, he's not.
Thank goodness.

1301
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:20,636
- Hey, you know
who needs a break? We do.

1302
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:21,871
You know, this is all fun,

1303
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:24,440
but we need some alone time,
you know?

1304
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,977
Just the two of us?
Away from everything?

1305
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:29,845
- Oh.

1306
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:31,614
- I didn't want to bring this
up in front of everyone, but...

1307
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:37,520
- What's that?
- Two tickets to Barcelona.

1308
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:39,088
- Like, Spain, Barcelona?

1309
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:40,856
- Say yes and we leave
in the morning.

1310
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:42,458
- But aunt Myrt's party
is tomorrow,

1311
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,193
and I have been
traveling a lot.

1312
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:45,761
- That's an annual thing,
you said, right?

1313
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:47,663
So, you know, does it really
matter if you miss one year?

1314
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:49,131
- Let me explain.

1315
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,433
So this is, like,
an important family thing.

1316
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,702
- Okay.

1317
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:55,037
Let me see if I can change
the tickets for the next day,

1318
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,272
if that works?

1319
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,840
We just have to be there
on Christmas.

1320
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:00,476
There's this big soccer match.
- In December?

1321
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,844
- It's a charity thing,
indoors.

1322
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:03,979
Teams from all over the world.

1323
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:05,514
The network asked me
to cover it.

1324
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,517
And I said yes,
if they would let me take you.

1325
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:10,920
- Okay, so this is about work?

1326
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:13,222
- No. No, no.
This is about us.

1327
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:14,790
Yes, with some work tossed in,

1328
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:17,927
but this is a chance for us
to celebrate our engagement.

1329
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:21,897
And for me to prove
what I can do.

1330
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:23,899
Look, Angie,
when we're married,

1331
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:25,868
this is something
we're gonna have to do a lot.

1332
00:53:25,937 --> 00:53:28,003
You know, I'm gonna
have to cover the stories

1333
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,572
wherever they take me.

1334
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:31,907
- Right.
- And I want you with me.

1335
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:33,642
- What about my career?

1336
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:34,977
- Yeah, yeah, of course,
there's your career,

1337
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:36,445
but, you know,
we'll make it work.

1338
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,014
Compromise is both ways.

1339
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,218
So? Huh? What do you say?

1340
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,186
- Um...

1341
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:46,555
- Hey, guys! Somebody grab
that ladder for me?

1342
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:47,957
- Yep!

1343
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,663
- Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Yep.

1344
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,732
Yes, sir, we are flying out
tomorrow, on Christmas eve,

1345
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:58,167
and I've got
the whole crew standing by

1346
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:00,369
in Barcelona right now.

1347
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,639
- He's very good-looking,
your fiancé.

1348
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,509
But is he always so busy?

1349
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,078
- Yeah, work is his passion.

1350
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:12,114
- Ah. And where do you fit in?

1351
00:54:12,183 --> 00:54:13,549
- I know how it looks,
aunt myrt,

1352
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:14,950
but you know I'm gonna be
just as busy

1353
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:17,853
at the hosp...I mean,
in medical...medical school.

1354
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,388
So, you know,
we'll both be busy.

1355
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:21,490
- And yet, knowing you,

1356
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:25,694
you will always find the time
for personal life, yes?

1357
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,998
Life is more than work.

1358
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:32,201
- Yeah, it should be.
- But does he feel that way?

1359
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,040
- I am so sorry about that.
- No problem.

1360
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:40,342
Angie's been telling me
all that you've been up to.

1361
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:42,278
- Oh, yeah.
Well, there's this...

1362
00:54:42,313 --> 00:54:44,980
there's a showcase for the top
European soccer leagues.

1363
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:46,682
Premier league in England,
of course,

1364
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:49,018
germany's bundesliga,
la liga in Spain.

1365
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:50,419
- Oh.

1366
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,022
- We've got teams from Italy
and from France.

1367
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,256
And there I go again.

1368
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,392
[laughter]

1369
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:57,760
- so where were we?

1370
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,728
- You were about to tell me
why we're meeting.

1371
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,163
- Yes.

1372
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:02,531
- I still have
so many gifts to wrap

1373
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:05,601
and so much to get done
before the party tonight.

1374
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:08,103
Or, rather, my staff does.

1375
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,172
- Well, from what I understand,

1376
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:12,875
my parents actually met at your
very first Christmas party.

1377
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,445
- Yes.
Oh, what a story that was.

1378
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:19,415
I think it was fate.
You know how some people

1379
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,217
just naturally belong together,

1380
00:55:22,253 --> 00:55:23,986
and some people...
[phone rings]

1381
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,924
- no, I'm just
gonna ignore this. Sorry.

1382
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:31,593
- Some people, you have to kind
of make it work,

1383
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:32,961
you know?
[phone rings]

1384
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:34,930
- yeah. Yeah.
Okay, there it goes again.

1385
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:36,899
- You know what,
I just...I'm just gonna

1386
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:38,901
very quickly...
I'm so...I'm so sorry.

1387
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:42,137
Tyler grant. Yes.

1388
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:45,708
- Um, I wanted to give them
that night again

1389
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,142
as a Christmas present,

1390
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:49,144
just, like, recreate it
as closely as I can.

1391
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,648
- Oh, what a lovely idea!
How can I help?

1392
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,650
- Well, I made a list of all
the songs that mom remembers.

1393
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,419
By the way, mom and dad have
no idea that I'm doing this.

1394
00:55:57,455 --> 00:56:00,189
And I was hoping you could get
those Victorian carolers

1395
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:01,490
that mom loved so much?

1396
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,659
- After 30 years?

1397
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,561
[laughs]

1398
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:07,363
I'll see what I can do.

1399
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:10,299
But they were not young
when your parents met.

1400
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:11,500
They're filing
for medicare now.

1401
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:14,303
- Oh, gosh.
[laughs]

1402
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:16,438
- is there a reason for this?

1403
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:20,576
- I think they could use
a reminder.

1404
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:22,811
- Of what's special
about Christmas?

1405
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:25,481
- What's special about
their relationship.

1406
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:27,816
- Angie, you are
a wonderful girl.

1407
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:29,918
- Thanks, aunt myrt.

1408
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:33,322
- Older than your years.

1409
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:34,957
- What do you mean?

1410
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:37,025
- There's something different
about you this holiday.

1411
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,527
- Oh, yeah?

1412
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,730
- I can't quite
put my finger on it, but...

1413
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:43,665
It's a confidence.

1414
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:47,736
- It's probably the cake.

1415
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:49,271
- [laughs]

1416
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:51,940
Tyler, you're such a dear

1417
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:53,976
for carrying those
to the car for me.

1418
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:57,780
- It's no problem at all.
- Good. Good. Here's the keys.

1419
00:56:57,815 --> 00:56:59,014
- Oh, thank you.

1420
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:00,115
- It's the white one
right down there.

1421
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:01,917
- Got it.
- And if you wouldn't mind?

1422
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,353
Thank you so much.
- Oh, not at all.

1423
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:06,355
It's no problem. Okay.

1424
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,523
- Thank you so much
for doing this, aunt myrt.

1425
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:09,625
- Oh, aunt myrt.

1426
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,761
Oh, my god, I love that so
much. I always have.

1427
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:15,597
You know,
family means everything.

1428
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,266
Even if it's this town.

1429
00:57:17,301 --> 00:57:19,968
The family you choose, right?
- Yeah.

1430
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:22,004
- See you tonight.
- Yeah, okay, tonight.

1431
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:26,208
Hey.

1432
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,810
- Hey.
- You going to lunch?

1433
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:29,445
- I'm getting sandwiches
for the elves.

1434
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,147
Apparently, they can't live
on candy canes alone.

1435
00:57:32,183 --> 00:57:33,482
- No, I don't
suppose they could.

1436
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:35,451
- Are you alone?
The boyfriend desert you?

1437
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:36,418
- No.
- No?

1438
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:38,620
Don't tell me you broke up.

1439
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:40,789
- He's helping aunt myrt
with some packages, okay?

1440
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:43,559
- What a regular boy scout.

1441
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,360
Do you have any plans
to go back?

1442
00:57:45,396 --> 00:57:48,297
And by "go back," I mean,
like, you know...

1443
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:49,364
Really go back?

1444
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,501
- I'm working on it.
- Okay.

1445
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:53,969
Well, hey,
if you happen to remember

1446
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:56,104
any winning lottery numbers
before you go...

1447
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,774
- That's a great idea.

1448
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,243
Hey, Ben,
if you could go back in time,

1449
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:02,945
is there anything
that you would change?

1450
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:08,851
- Yeah, maybe one thing.
- Really? What is it?

1451
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:10,686
- It's personal.
- Oh.

1452
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:13,622
- Yeah. Between me and frosty.
So...

1453
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:14,523
I'll see you around.

1454
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:20,762
- Frosty?
No wonder he's single.

1455
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:23,899
<i> [quirky music]</i>

1456
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,534
- you really think
your plan will work?

1457
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:26,768
Will they even remember?

1458
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:28,237
- It has to,
or in eight years...

1459
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:30,072
- What's gonna happen
in eight years?

1460
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,374
That's freakily specific.

1461
00:58:32,443 --> 00:58:34,710
- It's statistics,
because once you see the cracks

1462
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:37,946
in a marriage,
bad things happen.

1463
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:40,048
- You've been acting very odd
this whole trip.

1464
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:42,718
- Oh, have I?

1465
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:44,119
- Oh, I see what's happening.

1466
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,854
- You do?

1467
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,657
- You're working too hard.
It's the stress of med school.

1468
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,860
- Yep. Yep. You figured it out.
You're so good.

1469
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:55,764
- Okay, sport. You're ready.
My turn.

1470
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:58,500
- Oh!
- Oh.

1471
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:00,502
- Who's ready for somewhere
holiday cheer?

1472
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:03,939
- Looking like that, I'd guess
every woman in Shepard's ferry.

1473
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:05,741
- I've never felt
more underdressed in my life.

1474
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:07,242
- Oh, no rush.

1475
00:59:07,278 --> 00:59:09,711
I always like to be
camera-ready just in case.

1476
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:11,380
So what's the plan?

1477
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:12,648
- I'm gonna finish
getting ready.

1478
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:13,682
You're gonna go ahead
with everyone else,

1479
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,717
and I'll come later with mom.

1480
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:16,952
- She won't be suspicious
we're going separately?

1481
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:19,588
- Nope.
Not the way I have it planned.

1482
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:22,291
- Oh!
- How you doing, mom?

1483
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:24,793
- I cannot find the dress
I was supposed to wear tonight.

1484
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:27,529
- Oh, maybe you sent it
to the cleaners.

1485
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,398
- I did, but I am sure
I got it back,

1486
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:32,968
and I have no idea
what happened to it!

1487
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:35,971
- Yeah. That is very odd.

1488
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:37,940
Why don't you wear
something else?

1489
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:40,809
- I have nothing that's
appropriate or fancy enough.

1490
00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:42,578
- I have an idea.

1491
00:59:44,315 --> 00:59:47,082
Huh?
- Angie, that's 35 years old.

1492
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:48,183
- It's perfect.

1493
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:53,255
You're gonna
look stunning in it.

1494
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:56,058
You wear that tonight, you will
be the hit of the party.

1495
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:00,629
All: ♪ 'tis the season
to be jolly ♪

1496
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:03,465

1499
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:08,804
- thank you.

1500
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:12,007
Isn't this incredible?
She always outdoes herself.

1501
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,509
- Merry Christmas, one and all!

1502
01:00:14,545 --> 01:00:16,979
Oh, I'm so happy to see you!

1503
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:18,847
- Hi, myrt.
- Oh.

1504
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:21,550
George, you look as young
and as handsome

1505
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:23,518
as the first time we met.

1506
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:25,887
- You are too kind.

1507
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:27,623
Wait a minute, are these the
carolers, the same ones from...

1508
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:31,193
- Some of them, yes!
From the very first party.

1509
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:36,398
And you remembered?
Oh, they're just wonderful.

1510
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:38,800
Tyler, it's so good
to see you again.

1511
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:40,702
- Oh, it's good to see you too.
Thank you for including me.

1512
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,104
- And without your phone.

1513
01:00:44,842 --> 01:00:46,274
- I got dressed!

1514
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,477
- You most certainly did!

1515
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:53,548
And I have a surprise
for you, young man.

1516
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:55,217
Why don't you go
and have a look

1517
01:00:55,252 --> 01:01:00,155
at the very special centerpiece
in the dining room?

1518
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,625
- We don't run in
the house, Henrik.

1519
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,327
- Where are Evelyn and Angie?

1520

Hey, is everything okay?

I don't think so.

with the hospital.
