1
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,900
There he is!

2
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,774
Superman! Superman! Can
we ask you some questions?

3
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,214
- It's for our podcast.
- Well, in that case...

4
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:34,244
How many people that you
saved... have you saved?

5
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,801
- I...
- Never mind.

6
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:37,902
Does your thing really
stand for hope?

7
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:38,747
Yes. It does.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,403
But it looks like an "S".

9
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:44,897
Yes, it's meant to. It's
meant to wind, like a river.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,659
It comes and goes.

11
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:47,991
My fa...

12
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:51,298
A man I knew,
used to say...

13
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:52,531
that hope is
like a car keys.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,607
Easy to lose, but
if you dig around...

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,266
...it's usually close by.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,486
Did you ever
fight a hippo?

17
00:00:58,925 --> 00:00:59,794
That's dumb!

18
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,380
But hippos are
the most deadly!

19
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:05,440
What is... What's the best
thing about planet Earth?

20
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,004
What are you doing?

21
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:39,263
Wait! No, wait!
Wait! Wait!

22
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,767
Please! Please,
man! Please!

23
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,064
What do you
want from me?

24
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:48,904
Fear.

25
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:51,110
They could smell it.

26
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:53,459
What the hell?

27
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,770
- What was that?
- A scout.

28
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:09,538
From space?
Like an alien army?

29
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:11,638
Alfred, are you
seeing this?

30
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:14,580
I am. Matches the
other sightings.

31
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,870
And that pattern is
all over Luthor's notes.

32
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:20,238
Prep the jet. I'm
going north tonight.

33
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:23,062
Good. It's
time, then.

34
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,835
It's 'cause they
know he's dead, right?

35
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:32,283
Superman. He's gone.

36
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:35,180
Where does
that leave us?

37
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,072
Drop your
guns now!

38
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:40,150
Excuse me?

39
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:51,346
- Move it. Move!
- Don't shoot!

40
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:56,093
Get down.

41
00:07:56,921 --> 00:08:00,617
Line them up along the
wall. Keep them quiet.

42
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:34,084
Who are you?

43
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,512
The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

44
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,007
Now, who are you?

45
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:43,115
We're a small group of
reactionary terrorists.

46
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:44,337
We know that
sinners brought

47
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,902
- on this plague of...
- Why the hostages?

48
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:51,549
You're too late. The
countdown's already begun.

49
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:56,215
In a few minutes,
4 city blocks...

50
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:58,295
While the world watches.

51
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:03,415
Shut up!

52
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:05,602
This is man's
best hope.

53
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,993
Down with the
modern world.

54
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,238
Back to the
Dark Ages.

55
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:12,662
And the safety
of holy fear.

56
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:56,058
This would've been
over quickly, but...

57
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,671
No! Don't!

58
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:21,741
I don't believe it.

59
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:24,504
- What are you?
- A believer.

60
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:03,616
I'm asking
for your help.

61
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:08,752
I believe there's a stranger, comes
to this village from the sea.

62
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:11,470
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry...

63
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,042
and brings fish.

64
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:16,107
He comes on
the king tide...

65
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,796
That was last night.

66
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:24,902
Icebergs in
the harbour.

67
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:27,269
Four months since the
last ship got through.

68
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,287
Well, this stranger...

69
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:31,710
Doesn't come by ship.

70
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:36,429
There are enemies
coming, from far away.

71
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:39,564
I need warriors.

72
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,905
I'm building an alliance,
to defend ourselves.

73
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:45,523
Look, I'll give
you $25,000 to...

74
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:47,223
talk to this
man right now...

75
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:48,340
outside.

76
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:51,688
Something tells me that of
all he will give them to me.

77
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:13,631
Tell me what those 3 boxes
are and I'll make it 30.

78
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:18,166
You should get out.

79
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,837
Can you at least
point me to Atlantis?

80
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:24,679
Arthur Curry.

81
00:12:31,194 --> 00:12:33,478
Also known as the
Protector of the Oceans.

82
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,262
The Aquaman.

83
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,621
I hear you can
talk to fish.

84
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,044
So let me get
this straight...

85
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:47,386
You do it dressed like a
bat? Like an actual bat?

86
00:12:47,856 --> 00:12:49,700
It's worked for 20
years in Gotham.

87
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:51,224
Oh, that shithole.

88
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:53,460
The fight comes,
we'll need you.

89
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:55,575
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

90
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,840
Because I don't like
you coming here...

91
00:12:56,873 --> 00:12:58,793
digging into my business,
getting into my life.

92
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,518
People from Atlantis
tell me, "Do this."

93
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:01,822
Now, you say,
"Do that."

94
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,140
I want to be
left alone.

95
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:05,730
That why you help these people
out here in the middle of nowhere?

96
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:07,180
Because you
can just leave?

97
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:09,586
I help them 'cause
no one else does.

98
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:12,048
You wanna protect them,
you need to work with me.

99
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,049
A strong man is
strongest alone.

100
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:15,561
You ever heard that?

101
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:19,062
That's not a saying. That's the
opposite of what the saying is.

102
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:22,406
Yep. Doesn't
mean I'm wrong.

103
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,781
You ever hear
of Superman?

104
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:28,240
- He died fighting next to me.
- My point exactly.

105
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,187
What's in
the 3 boxes?

106
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,987
It's ancient history.

107
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,775
Mankind's melting
the polar ice caps...

108
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:39,189
Destroying the ecosystem,
they got it coming?

109
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:42,280
Hey, I don't mind
if the ocean rise.

110
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:44,179
How about
if they boil?

111
00:13:44,886 --> 00:13:46,847
Dressed like a bat.

112
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,575
You're out of your
mind, Bruce Wayne.

113
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,691
Doesn't mean
I'm wrong.

114
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,758
So, you say you have no way
of reconnecting with this...

115
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,858
Aquaman.

116
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,980
I put a tracking
device in his coat...

117
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:13,411
He left without it.

118
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:16,971
It may, in fact, not
have been his coat.

119
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,202
Those squares,
from Luthor's notes...

120
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,532
I think they must be
containers of some kind.

121
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:25,449
- Of what?
- I don't know.

122
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:28,907
Money, power. Something
worth starting a war over.

123
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,607
Well, we had luck
with one person...

124
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:34,197
on the team list.

125
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:37,314
Barry Allen,
of Central City.

126
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:40,124
He's completely
off the grid.

127
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:41,232
Squatting, I think.

128
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,394
Moves suddenly
and often.

129
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,296
- Disappearing act?
- But he does visit his father...

130
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,532
...in prison.

131
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,087
- For murdering his mother.
- Jesus!

132
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,635
Young Barry always protested
his father's innocence...

133
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,767
But he was 9 and
nobody listened to him.

134
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,333
We have somebody
at the prison?

135
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:59,490
Oh, yeah. We'll
find the address.

136
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:04,491
- What about, Diana?
- Well, you have her number.

137
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:06,776
You could've
called her.

138
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:09,803
Perhaps I should
fly to Paris

139
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:11,055
with a handwritten
note?

140
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:13,052
"Will you be
Bruce' teammate?"

141
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,535
"Check: Yes or No"

142
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:16,823
I'm only interested
in her skill set.

143
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:19,321
- I'm sure you are.
- Can we?

144
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:23,458
Well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

145
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:25,415
But it's got a
partial match.

146
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:27,025
A Victor Stone.

147
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:30,876
Genius I.Q., football
scholarship to GCU...

148
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,471
And deceased.

149
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:35,383
Figures. Fairy tales
and ghost stories.

150
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,102
One misses the days
when one's biggest

151
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:40,340
concerns were exploding
wind-up penguins?

152
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,790
The simple life.

153
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:45,277
I don't recognize
this world.

154
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,127
I don't have
to recognize it.

155
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:51,164
I just have to save it.

156
00:15:58,147 --> 00:15:59,647
Here to see
Henry Allen.

157
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:00,806
Sign.

158
00:16:05,827 --> 00:16:07,443
Hurry it up, will you?

159
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,204
What, you
got a problem?

160
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:14,671
No. There's
no problem.

161
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:16,571
Better not be.

162
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:23,084
You know
where to go.

163
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,657
Are those
prescription...

164
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:37,270
Or you just trying
to look brainy?

165
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,464
Because you're holding yourself
back. You're going in circles.

166
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:47,130
You're working 3 dead-
end jobs. Going on four.

167
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:48,691
Where do you even
have the time?

168
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:49,424
I make the time.

169
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:51,924
And this is all to pay for a
criminal justice degree, huh?

170
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,157
Okay. I really don't want
to talk about this again...

171
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,019
The investigation
was botched.

172
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:57,599
Give me your hand.

173
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:05,368
I want you to
listen to me, Barry...

174
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:07,475
Because
I mean this.

175
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,459
I want you to
give all of that up.

176
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:16,652
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

177
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:21,670
I am a drag
on your life.

178
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:26,079
Please don't ever
say that to me again.

179
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:27,873
Please?

180
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:30,736
You can be whatever you
wanna be. You're a brilliant man.

181
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:35,212
Absolute best
of the best.

182
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,363
I can't sit here...

183
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:41,506
and watch you run
in place in Central City...

184
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:43,031
for some old dude...

185
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:46,841
- who's not going anywhere.
- Dad...

186
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:48,048
- That's not true.
- It's time.

187
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:49,766
- That's not true.
- Let's go, Allen.

188
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,794
Allen!

189
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:52,226
I want you to make
your own future.

190
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,193
Living in the past...
Make your own future.

191
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,391
Open gate!

192
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:20,801
Lab's all yours,
Howard.

193
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:24,488
11:30. Early night
for you, Silas.

194
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,277
Yes. Early.

195
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,557
I never
got to say...

196
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,811
I'm very sorry about
what happened.

197
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:36,358
Victor was a
wonderful kid.

198
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:39,889
Thank you.

199
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,210
Victor.

200
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:55,693
Victor, you're not
stuck up here.

201
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,547
You can have a life.
You can have more than...

202
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:06,763
- If you stay up here brooding...
- I'm processing.

203
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,864
I can access
everything.

204
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:11,780
- But I can't put it all together.
- Not yet.

205
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:14,490
But if you work with me, if
we had the change engines...

206
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,460
So you did to someone else.
What you did to me.

207
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:22,099
No. The box
stays hidden.

208
00:19:22,132 --> 00:19:24,930
If you could see what we're learning
from the Kryptonian ship...

209
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,534
I think the change engine
can integrate with its energy...

210
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:29,842
- get it powered up...
- Does anybody know?

211
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:31,360
What?

212
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:34,413
At the lab... Does
anybody know I'm alive?

213
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:36,581
I...
I...

214
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,542
- I didn't think you were ready for them to...
- For what?

215
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:41,644
For them to
see the monster?

216
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,995
You are not
a monster.

217
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:47,813
It's weird that you
thought I meant me.

218
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:52,560
What I did...

219
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,963
I lost your mother
in that accident.

220
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:58,824
I wasn't about to...

221
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:02,403
I couldn't bear
to lose my son.

222
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:03,856
But you did.

223
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:08,108
I got a language in my
head that I don't speak.

224
00:20:08,987 --> 00:20:11,821
It's not just
digital... It's alien.

225
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,819
Everyday, I wake
up, different...

226
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:18,197
Modified.

227
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,761
How do you...?

228
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:29,043
Couldn't do
that last night.

229
00:20:29,636 --> 00:20:32,128
Ever since we got
visitors from Krypton,

230
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:34,758
people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

231
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,304
Now I got to
wonder if I'm it?

232
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:58,623
- Any changes today?
- No, my Queen.

233
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:02,101
The Mother Box
has awoken...

234
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:03,879
Yet, nothing
has happened.

235
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:07,560
It has slept for thousands
of years, since the first age.

236
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:10,122
Why did it
wake at all?

237
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,574
Amazons,
on your mark!

238
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:46,325
Steppenwolf.

239
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:50,923
Mother...

240
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,795
Millenia in exile...
Searching.

241
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:58,698
At last, you
call me home.

242
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:01,259
You will not like
your welcome.

243
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,814
Oh, I think I will.

244
00:23:27,064 --> 00:23:30,142
- Gather the legions.
- Seal the cage!

245
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,175
Go!

246
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:33,483
Flank right!

247
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,727
Yes...

248
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:42,404
Run.

249
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,043
Seal the gates!

250
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,135
Keep it moving.

251
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:14,043
Got it! Go!

252
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:36,338
Noble Queen,
why do you fight?

253
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:41,241
After the Unity, you
will join my Legion...

254
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:45,090
and you will know the
righteousness of power.

255
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:51,625
You will love me.

256
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:02,302
You all will.

257
00:26:27,632 --> 00:26:29,906
We have to light the
ancient warning fire.

258
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:33,158
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

259
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:35,868
Men won't know
what it means.

260
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:37,875
Men won't...

261
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:41,192
But she will.

262
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,363
Listen to me, Diana.

263
00:27:15,642 --> 00:27:18,124
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

264
00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:19,592
Me?

265
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,718
Nothing very
interesting.

266
00:27:22,832 --> 00:27:24,562
That's all you
ever tell us.

267
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:27,352
Whay can I say?
I'm not that exciting.

268
00:27:27,385 --> 00:27:29,546
...Shrine of the Amazons...

269
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:33,458
an enormous bonfire
burned right behind me...

270
00:27:33,491 --> 00:27:35,574
baffling absolutely
everyone...

271
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:38,616
from locals, to government
authorities alike.

272
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:42,638
- The fire could be seen for miles on end...
- Invasion.

273
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:45,347
On the local scene...

274
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,743
This janitor's wife
had some strong words...

275
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,940
for the aliens
she says,

276
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:51,356
stole her man.

277
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:55,157
My Howard is a good
man. He's a provider.

278
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,887
And these aliens are gonna
(beep) probe him?

279
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,176
Come down to
the Lakeview...

280
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:04,796
And I'll stick a (beep) probe
up your alien (beep) ass, you...

281
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:07,928
I found a little place.
By the diner.

282
00:28:08,078 --> 00:28:09,600
Suits me just fine.

283
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:11,264
I wish you'd
said something.

284
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:13,556
Oh, no. I got behind
in the payments.

285
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:17,272
And you know the banks. Jump
like a cougar if you miss by a dime.

286
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:20,322
Place was too
big for me anyway.

287
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:22,352
Shuffling around
like an old ghost.

288
00:28:22,385 --> 00:28:25,752
Well, I might have been
able to, talk to someone, or...

289
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:27,314
You had enough
to deal with.

290
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:29,148
Don't need to add
mother-in-law to the list.

291
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:32,508
- Not that I was ever...
- Hey, Lane...

292
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:37,920
Who is your source? The
activist in that university...

293
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:39,898
Look, it's my source.

294
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,088
I got tapped for
the kidnapping story.

295
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,936
There were all those
student protests. Anyway...

296
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:47,390
I'm thinking it's political,
so... Who's your guy?

297
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,629
Well let's see if
she'll take your call.

298
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:52,107
So, it's a she.

299
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:56,311
It's not a she.

300
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:59,453
Sounds like you should
be working that story.

301
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:03,957
I'm... I'm
not ready yet.

302
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:08,389
I'm perfectly happy, doing fluff
pieces about kitten grooming.

303
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:10,613
For a while...

304
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,636
It was hard coming
back here at all.

305
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:19,067
Well. I can hardly read
the news anyway.

306
00:29:19,101 --> 00:29:20,444
So much bitterness.

307
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:23,368
'Course, I think it's all
because he's gone.

308
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:27,123
But I suppose a
mother does.

309
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,852
But it's not like there's any
less that needs reporting.

310
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:35,184
And Clark promised me, you were
gonna bring home another Pulitzer.

311
00:29:35,217 --> 00:29:37,387
- Oh, did he?
- Oh, yes. He did.

312
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,899
He said you were the thirstiest
young woman he'd ever met.

313
00:29:43,318 --> 00:29:45,995
- Hungriest.
- Hungry. Yeah.

314
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,311
He said you...

315
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:52,400
could smell a story. Further
away than he could hear.

316
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:58,100
Well stories, made sense.

317
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:02,373
It was more than just a puzzle.
It was about the truth.

318
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:07,129
It was about seeing the
engine of the world...

319
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:09,677
While it still ran.

320
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,667
<i>Victor Stone...</i>

321
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,022
<i>Deceased.</i>

322
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:04,281
That one...

323
00:31:04,714 --> 00:31:07,082
Pretty sure that's what
made the alien go crazy.

324
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,561
I'll see about weaving
something to the suit.

325
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:10,806
Won't be quick.

326
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,059
Anything to give
me an edge.

327
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:26,356
You know, I paid
millions of dollars...

328
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,056
for this building's security.

329
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:29,631
Yeah. It looked
expensive.

330
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,109
Hi.

331
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:37,847
A new toy?

332
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,630
Prototype
troop carrier.

333
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,504
I once knew a man who
would've loved to fly it.

334
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:47,361
Yeah, well we're gonna
need more than a pilot.

335
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,343
I think there's
an attack coming.

336
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,820
Not coming, Bruce.
It's already here.

337
00:31:57,469 --> 00:31:59,536
They called him
Steppenwolf.

338
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:01,205
The End of Worlds.

339
00:32:02,024 --> 00:32:04,047
He lived only
to conquer.

340
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:07,969
Millions fell
before his blade...

341
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,644
And rose again as
his Parademons.

342
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,674
Nightmare creatures,
who feed on fear.

343
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:19,328
Yeah, I think I've met one.
We didn't hit it off.

344
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:20,670
Here in Gotham?

345
00:32:20,703 --> 00:32:21,913
They're all over.

346
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:24,341
They're looking for
his... Boxes?

347
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,471
- The Mother Boxes.
- Mother Boxes?

348
00:32:27,932 --> 00:32:29,910
I guess Steppenwolf
sent the winged people

349
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:31,254
that leaves two more.

350
00:32:31,584 --> 00:32:33,799
- I'm impressed.
- Don't be.

351
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:35,410
I have no idea
what's in them.

352
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:36,988
A weapon? Some
kind of power?

353
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,656
They don't contain power.

354
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:42,108
They are power.

355
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:45,391
Carried from
planet to planet...

356
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:48,754
The Mother Boxes combined
to form the Unity.

357
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:52,844
An apocalyptic power that
not only destroys worlds...

358
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:56,298
...but transforms them into
the primordial hell's gate...

359
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:58,359
... of Steppenwolf's birthworld.

360
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:01,271
We should have died...

361
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,330
But we formed
our own Unity.

362
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:07,121
Amazons, Atlanteans...

363
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:10,782
All the tribes of man
fought side by side.

364
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:15,349
Warriors of legend.

365
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,562
Allies from other worlds.

366
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:25,773
Even the gods themselves
all acted as one.

367
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:29,729
Laying down their lives to
drive Steppenwolf away.

368
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:43,539
Some say it
drove him mad...

369
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:46,143
.. the disgrace of
his first retreat.

370
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:49,034
He swore our alliance
would crumble.

371
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:52,465
That darkness would
cover the Earth...

372
00:33:55,672 --> 00:33:58,380
And that he would
return when it did.

373
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:03,950
Left behind...

374
00:34:03,983 --> 00:34:05,769
The Mother Boxes
were too dangerous

375
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,284
to be kept
together.

376
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:12,040
One was entrusted
to the Amazons.

377
00:34:13,323 --> 00:34:15,058
One, to the Atlanteans.

378
00:34:15,491 --> 00:34:19,471
Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.

379
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:24,026
The Box of Man
was buried in secret.

380
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:28,939
So that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.

381
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,661
Such harmony out
of such horror.

382
00:34:35,694 --> 00:34:37,958
It was truly an
age of heroes.

383
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:41,476
Something tells me we're not
getting the band back together.

384
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,349
The Atlanteans were
a force under sea...

385
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,282
And the Amazons, to an
island they can never leave.

386
00:34:47,315 --> 00:34:49,983
I wouldn't count on
the tribes of men.

387
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:53,252
We tend to act like the doomsday
clock has a snooze button.

388
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:55,640
- How long until we...
- Days.

389
00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:57,859
At most.

390
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:01,737
Steppenwolf's mistake last
time was attacking us.

391
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,573
He wanted to make the Earth
kneel before he destroyed us.

392
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:07,520
This time he'll just
go after the Boxes.

393
00:35:07,953 --> 00:35:10,494
I got a location for
one of our recruits.

394
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,559
- Barry Allen.
- What about the other one?

395
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:13,876
Victor Stone?

396
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:15,352
I was hoping you
would dig him up.

397
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:21,053
We're asking people we
don't know to risk their lives.

398
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,189
I know.

399
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:25,003
That's how this works.

400
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,073
Barry Allen.

401
00:35:58,846 --> 00:35:59,909
Bruce Wayne.

402
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,444
You say that
like it explains...

403
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:04,793
why there's a total
stranger in my place...

404
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:07,304
sitting in the dark, in
my second favorite chair.

405
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,471
Tell me about this.

406
00:36:14,073 --> 00:36:16,878
This is a person who
looks exactly like me...

407
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:18,471
but who is definitely not me.

408
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,693
Very attractive
Jewish boy.

409
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:25,636
Somebody who, I don't know,
stole your pocketwatch?

410
00:36:25,669 --> 00:36:27,723
Or railroads?

411
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:31,177
I know you have abilities. I just
don't know what they are.

412
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,714
My special skills include...

413
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:37,236
Viola, web design,
fluent in sign language...

414
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:38,981
gorilla sign language...

415
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:41,278
Silica-based
quartz sand fabric,

416
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:43,616
Abrasion resistant.
Heat resistant.

417
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:44,636
Yeah, I do...

418
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,452
- Competitive ice dancing.
- That's what they use...

419
00:36:46,476 --> 00:36:47,787
on the space
shuttle, to

420
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:49,077
prevent it from burning
up on re-entry.

421
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:52,031
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

422
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:56,218
Whoever you're looking
for, it's not me...

423
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,585
You're the Batman?

424
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:23,391
So you're fast.

425
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:25,647
That feels like an
oversimplification.

426
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:27,296
I'm putting together a team.

427
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,175
People with special abilities.

428
00:37:29,308 --> 00:37:31,210
You see, I believe
enemies are coming.

429
00:37:31,243 --> 00:37:33,312
Stop right there. I'm in.

430
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:34,632
You are?

431
00:37:34,665 --> 00:37:37,533
Yeah. I need... friends.

432
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:42,662
People are difficult. They
require a lot of focus.

433
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:46,651
They have like a rhythm that
I haven't quite been able to...

434
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:48,426
Like, Brunch?

435
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:50,246
Like... What is Brunch?

436
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:52,155
You wait in line
for an hour...

437
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,017
for, essentially, lunch.

438
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,047
I mean, I don't know.

439
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:01,065
People are...
a little slow.

440
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:03,549
I'll try to keep up.

441
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,332
Can I keep this?

442
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:08,833
It's like this layer of
dimensional reality...

443
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:10,251
that seems to
manipulate space-time.

444
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:11,537
I call it the
Speed Force.

445
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:13,609
Causes me to burn tremendous
amount of calories...

446
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:16,269
So I am just a black
hole of snacks.

447
00:38:16,302 --> 00:38:18,072
I am a "snack hole."

448
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,068
How many people are
on this special fight team?

449
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:23,604
Three. Including you.

450
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,398
Three? Against what?

451
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:27,696
I'll tell you
on the plane.

452
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,516
Plane?

453
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:32,133
What are your
superpowers again?

454
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:33,949
I'm rich.

455
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,618
The program always gets
twitchy with this footage.

456
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:11,201
Why are you and Bruce
Wayne looking for me?

457
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:13,489
You know who we are?

458
00:39:14,181 --> 00:39:18,143
And I also know
where you are.

459
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:20,026
Are you Victor Stone?

460
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:23,342
Was.

461
00:39:25,456 --> 00:39:27,124
I need to speak to you.

462
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,973
You are.

463
00:39:29,006 --> 00:39:30,435
No, face to face.

464
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,336
I'm old-fashioned that way.

465
00:39:32,894 --> 00:39:35,541
Why would I trust you?

466
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:39,335
If I was going to attack you,
I would've done it by the lake.

467
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:44,715
Looks like you have
a date, Ms. Prince.

468
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:48,509
About time somebody here did.

469
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:22,954
Face to face.

470
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:25,500
I've been doing
some tracking.

471
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:30,743
What you're looking for is
sticking to the dead zones.

472
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,970
It gets in front of a
camera, causes a surge.

473
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:37,360
- I'll let you know.
- That's not good enough.

474
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,566
Not good enough?

475
00:40:39,024 --> 00:40:40,388
For you.

476
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,523
Look, I don't
know you...

477
00:40:42,602 --> 00:40:45,178
And I don't know how
you got these gifts.

478
00:40:45,211 --> 00:40:46,129
Gifts?

479
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:48,082
No one else can
do what you do.

480
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:51,480
No, if these are gifts...

481
00:40:51,713 --> 00:40:53,504
then why am I the
one paying for them?

482
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,077
We need you, Victor.

483
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:58,436
And maybe you need us.

484
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:00,274
I'll be fine alone.

485
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:03,118
I told myself the
same for a long time.

486
00:41:08,194 --> 00:41:10,967
I lost someone
I loved once.

487
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:18,294
I shut myself off
from... From everyone.

488
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:21,759
But I had to learn to
open back up again.

489
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:26,546
The truth is I'm
still working on it.

490
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:29,633
And if you agreed
to meet me...

491
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,822
... you're working on it, too.

492
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:37,021
Trust me, Victor.

493
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,184
Mayday! Mayday!

494
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:51,093
Something came
down from the sky.

495
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,697
Please, help me!

496
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,118
Whisky.

497
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:19,361
And one for Ahab there.

498
00:42:19,597 --> 00:42:21,370
...from the sky...

499
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:23,997
I heard a cannon.

500
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,072
- It's ocean's rage.
- Then they came...

501
00:42:27,017 --> 00:42:28,297
Monsters.

502
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:30,586
... from the sky.

503
00:42:31,754 --> 00:42:33,484
Tore right through my boat.

504
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,259
Monsters...

505
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:39,550
It's on him.

506
00:45:04,631 --> 00:45:06,188
You took a
hell of a hit.

507
00:45:06,463 --> 00:45:07,686
You all right?

508
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:09,495
At last...

509
00:45:09,528 --> 00:45:12,373
The firstborn of beloved
Queen Atlanna.

510
00:45:14,102 --> 00:45:15,296
Wait.

511
00:45:17,335 --> 00:45:18,442
Please.

512
00:45:21,362 --> 00:45:22,555
I knew her.

513
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:25,812
That makes one of us.

514
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:27,846
When my parents
fought in the wars...

515
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:31,356
- She took me in.
- What a saint.

516
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:33,291
You dare speak of Queen
Atlanna that way?

517
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:35,373
Your Queen left me
on my father's doorstep

518
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:36,562
and never gave
me another thought...

519
00:45:36,595 --> 00:45:38,771
Your mother left
you to save your life.

520
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:41,167
You can't imagine
how it hurt her.

521
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,119
What it cost her.

522
00:45:45,053 --> 00:45:47,169
But you're not a
defenseless child now.

523
00:45:48,448 --> 00:45:50,171
It would've been
her responsibility...

524
00:45:50,204 --> 00:45:53,326
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

525
00:45:54,757 --> 00:45:58,139
Now, it's yours.

526
00:46:00,264 --> 00:46:02,028
Then I'm gonna need
something from you.

527
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,225
Leave that.

528
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:24,195
Leave it. It will never work.

529
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:04,870
I see, Mother.

530
00:47:05,203 --> 00:47:08,907
I see why you
waited to summon me.

531
00:47:09,629 --> 00:47:13,278
That Kryptonian's death
plunged this timid world...

532
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:15,008
into such terror.

533
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:21,365
Amazons. Atlanteans. Each
stands, and falls, alone.

534
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:28,932
I know Mother. You've waited
too long for the Unity.

535
00:47:29,171 --> 00:47:31,902
I know. But
you will feed.

536
00:47:35,116 --> 00:47:38,166
And my exile will
come to an end.

537
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:42,390
I will take my place
among the New Gods.

538
00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:46,094
Find the last one.

539
00:47:47,313 --> 00:47:50,492
Its power will
cleanse this world.

540
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,105
For the Unity!

541
00:47:55,644 --> 00:47:57,272
For Darkseid.

542
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,065
Victor.

543
00:48:18,573 --> 00:48:19,652
Asshole!

544
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:23,089
Eight kidnappings. 6
in Metropolis, 2 here.

545
00:48:23,122 --> 00:48:25,246
All the vics worked
for STAR Labs.

546
00:48:27,562 --> 00:48:30,179
Attacked by a
flying vampire.

547
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:32,850
Suspect was
a giant bat...

548
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:34,347
with huge fangs.

549
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,606
One of them was
a little kid, scared.

550
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:38,261
Won't say a word
but drew this.

551
00:48:38,494 --> 00:48:40,304
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like.

552
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:43,507
Come on. You think he fights
criminals for 20 years here...

553
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,327
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

554
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,999
I'll talk to him tonight.

555
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:53,334
The world's gone crazy,
Jim. Maybe he did, too.

556
00:48:57,783 --> 00:48:59,169
You find the Cyborg?

557
00:49:00,477 --> 00:49:01,668
We spoke.

558
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:03,573
Give him time.

559
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,836
You must be
Barry. I'm Diana.

560
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:08,393
Hi Barry, I'm Diana...

561
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:10,456
That's not right. Great.

562
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,934
So this is us?

563
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:13,115
Yeah. This is us.

564
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:15,112
Oh! Awesome!

565
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:17,002
That's the Bat-signal.
That's your...

566
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:18,609
Oh. Sorry.

567
00:49:18,642 --> 00:49:20,698
That's your signal. That
means we have to go now.

568
00:49:20,722 --> 00:49:23,535
- Yeah. That's what that means.
- That's so cool.

569
00:49:59,398 --> 00:50:01,059
How many of
you are there?

570
00:50:01,442 --> 00:50:02,960
Not enough.

571
00:50:04,058 --> 00:50:07,202
Eight people abducted
from or near STAR Labs.

572
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:08,595
Here's the potential perp.

573
00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:10,859
Parademons.

574
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:12,183
Okay...

575
00:50:12,216 --> 00:50:14,668
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

576
00:50:14,701 --> 00:50:17,138
They carried people away to
find out what they know.

577
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:19,349
- So the eight might still be alive.
- Nine.

578
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,863
The head of STAR Labs
was taken as well.

579
00:50:26,051 --> 00:50:27,138
You made it.

580
00:50:28,847 --> 00:50:31,727
So then. There must
be a nest nearby.

581
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,072
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham...

582
00:50:35,105 --> 00:50:36,778
No pattern I can see.

583
00:50:36,811 --> 00:50:38,533
The lines on the
map don't converge.

584
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:39,627
On land.

585
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,587
These lead back to Braxton Island,
between the two cities.

586
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,929
Gotham Harbor.
These are air vents...

587
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:47,372
they all lead down to the
tunnel from Metropolis...

588
00:50:47,405 --> 00:50:49,089
project that was
abandoned in '29.

589
00:50:51,777 --> 00:50:53,096
Do you really
think that...

590
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:57,477
Wow. They just... They
really just vanished.

591
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,493
That's rude.

592
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:30,152
- Where are we, Alfred?
- Braxton Island.

593
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:31,185
You should be...

594
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,292
directly under the venting
tower for the tunnel.

595
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,714
Now, look to your left,
you should see a staircase.

596
00:51:37,747 --> 00:51:39,713
It will give you access
to the machine room.

597
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:47,869
Define access.

598
00:51:48,378 --> 00:51:49,702
One at a time.

599
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:50,884
The bridge may not...

600
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:52,909
... hold.

601
00:51:57,886 --> 00:52:02,344
- Just tell me the truth.
- Please, just let us go.

602
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:04,597
- I have a family!
- Wrong answer.

603
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,363
Humans...

604
00:52:07,396 --> 00:52:11,264
The stench of your fear is
making my soldiers hungry.

605
00:52:11,497 --> 00:52:14,146
Shall I feed them?

606
00:52:15,263 --> 00:52:17,400
You've been near
the Mother Box.

607
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:19,553
- The scent is on you...
- Please.

608
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:21,108
We have families.

609
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:23,763
Why does everyone
keep telling me that?

610
00:52:28,515 --> 00:52:30,567
Okay. Here's the thing...

611
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:33,605
See, I'm afraid
of bugs, and...

612
00:52:33,993 --> 00:52:36,536
Guns. And obnoxiously tall people.

613
00:52:36,569 --> 00:52:38,336
And murder.
I can't be here.

614
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:42,130
It's really cool, you guys seem
ready to do battle and stuff, but...

615
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:44,874
Full transparency,
I've never done battle.

616
00:52:45,007 --> 00:52:47,427
I just push some
people and run away.

617
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,229
Save one.

618
00:52:49,553 --> 00:52:50,472
One?

619
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:51,900
Save one person.

620
00:52:53,321 --> 00:52:54,641
Wait, which one?

621
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:58,051
Don't talk. Don't fight.
Get in. Get one out.

622
00:52:58,284 --> 00:52:59,543
And then?

623
00:52:59,929 --> 00:53:00,969
You go.

624
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:04,348
Okay.

625
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,348
Useless!

626
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:10,522
You then.

627
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,904
Where is my Mother Box?

628
00:53:17,124 --> 00:53:19,141
I'll die before I tell you.

629
00:53:19,174 --> 00:53:22,763
At last, one that
doesn't whine.

630
00:53:25,353 --> 00:53:27,680
But you will scream.

631
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:33,333
Dad.

632
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:34,911
Victor.

633
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:39,064
You were born of her.

634
00:53:39,576 --> 00:53:42,036
A creature of chaos.

635
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:43,459
Not how I see it.

636
00:53:43,492 --> 00:53:45,091
Give it time.

637
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,210
Amazon!

638
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:09,946
Okay.

639
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,886
Save one.

640
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,156
This one is mine.

641
00:54:26,758 --> 00:54:28,864
You overestimate yourself.

642
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:30,337
Child...

643
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:34,848
My axe is still slick with
the blood of your sisters.

644
00:54:49,311 --> 00:54:50,941
Alfred, I need the
Nightcrawler.

645
00:54:50,974 --> 00:54:52,535
I thought you'd never ask.

646
00:54:53,169 --> 00:54:55,536
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

647
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:10,562
You good?

648
00:55:10,595 --> 00:55:12,321
At the end of the hall
there should be stairs.

649
00:55:12,355 --> 00:55:12,915
Okay.

650
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:13,517
Go!

651
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,576
He's after the change engine.
His Mother Box.

652
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:17,768
- You have to keep him from it.
- Help people get to safety.

653
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:18,858
- Promise me.
- Go!

654
00:55:55,254 --> 00:55:56,428
Finish her!

655
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:02,319
Sorry guys,

656
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,228
I didn't bring
a sword.

657
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,120
Jesus. He is tall.

658
00:57:31,129 --> 00:57:32,182
So...

659
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,357
You have the blood
of the Old Gods in you.

660
00:57:40,923 --> 00:57:43,004
The Old Gods died.

661
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:53,683
No!

662
00:58:11,828 --> 00:58:13,105
Heads up!

663
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:26,520
Thanks, Alfred. But
I'll take it from here.

664
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,803
Do I know you?

665
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:48,080
Primitive beings.

666
00:58:53,553 --> 00:58:54,913
What are we
under right now?

667
00:58:57,775 --> 00:58:59,185
Gotham Harbor.

668
00:59:02,774 --> 00:59:03,972
You all need
to move.

669
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:06,166
- You get him out...
- Diana, there's no time.

670
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:08,195
Also among my
fears is drowning.

671
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:10,571
You are a
distraction.

672
00:59:11,346 --> 00:59:13,096
Mother is calling.

673
00:59:17,117 --> 00:59:18,839
Diana, come on!

674
00:59:49,303 --> 00:59:50,751
Come on.

675
01:00:10,758 --> 01:00:12,053
The change engine.

676
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:19,038
Did he just bail?

677
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,829
Millions in structural damage.
You haven't lost your touch.

678
01:00:23,941 --> 01:00:26,447
But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

679
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:33,499
Dressed like
a bat? I dig it.

680
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,113
It may be
temporary.

681
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:37,639
So...

682
01:00:37,722 --> 01:00:39,372
What made you
change your mind?

683
01:00:39,405 --> 01:00:40,766
Steppenwolf.

684
01:00:41,657 --> 01:00:43,371
He took the Mother
Box from Atlantis.

685
01:00:43,404 --> 01:00:46,242
All he needs now is
the last box of man.

686
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,683
If he doesn't
already have it.

687
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:52,164
He doesn't have it.

688
01:01:05,304 --> 01:01:06,509
We need to get away.

689
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,715
No. We are
safer here.

690
01:01:09,148 --> 01:01:12,134
What happens when
we run out of food?

691
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,149
Someone will come.

692
01:01:14,182 --> 01:01:15,730
Who will
come for us?

693
01:01:40,362 --> 01:01:42,007
Wow. It's
like a cave.

694
01:01:44,745 --> 01:01:46,818
Like a Batcave.

695
01:01:50,883 --> 01:01:51,934
Barry!

696
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:55,738
My father called it
the change engine.

697
01:01:55,771 --> 01:01:57,916
It was found by the British
during World War I.

698
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:58,940
They studied it...

699
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,806
but they couldn't
even date it. It's so old.

700
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:05,627
It was shelved, until the
night Superman died.

701
01:02:05,874 --> 01:02:07,914
Then she lit up
like Christmas.

702
01:02:08,047 --> 01:02:09,464
They brought it
to STAR Labs...

703
01:02:09,488 --> 01:02:11,056
where my father
recognized it...

704
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:12,826
as a perpetual
energy matrix.

705
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:14,040
That sounds cool.

706
01:02:14,073 --> 01:02:15,850
I thought it was
like a nuclear bomb.

707
01:02:15,883 --> 01:02:18,223
A Mother Box destroys
as it creates.

708
01:02:19,343 --> 01:02:22,122
It's a cycle of life, but
a million times faster.

709
01:02:22,555 --> 01:02:25,194
My father thought it was the
key to unlimited energy.

710
01:02:25,984 --> 01:02:28,870
New formulas,
cellular regeneration...

711
01:02:29,403 --> 01:02:31,543
But it's too
volatile to control.

712
01:02:31,576 --> 01:02:32,864
He used it on you.

713
01:02:33,859 --> 01:02:35,420
I was in
an accident.

714
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,214
I should've died.

715
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,786
My father thought that he
could use the Mother Box to

716
01:02:40,819 --> 01:02:43,982
rebuild the broken parts of me with
a few cybernetic enhancements.

717
01:02:44,015 --> 01:02:45,919
Instead, he built
a living machine.

718
01:02:45,952 --> 01:02:47,783
I may be stronger
than its host.

719
01:02:48,116 --> 01:02:51,289
Too much.
Too much life.

720
01:02:52,379 --> 01:02:53,980
What's on your
weird mind?

721
01:02:54,013 --> 01:02:56,271
Muscles. Coordination.

722
01:02:56,304 --> 01:02:58,793
Basic cellular integrity.

723
01:02:58,826 --> 01:03:01,493
A human being can
only absorb so much.

724
01:03:02,384 --> 01:03:05,648
The Mother Box was
designed to reshape a planet.

725
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:06,981
So?

726
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:07,907
So...

727
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,069
What if you were
stronger than a planet?

728
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:14,681
Your cells lying dormant,
but incapable of decay.

729
01:03:15,014 --> 01:03:17,314
If you were in a
conductive field...

730
01:03:17,853 --> 01:03:19,213
A boost from
the Mother Box...

731
01:03:19,237 --> 01:03:21,788
... could bring "him"
back to life.

732
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,750
The Kryptonian ship has
an amniotic chamber...

733
01:03:26,783 --> 01:03:28,348
- Which would be a perfect...
- No.

734
01:03:28,381 --> 01:03:30,110
- Diana.
- Bruce, no!

735
01:03:30,343 --> 01:03:32,763
You have no idea what kind
of power you're dealing with.

736
01:03:32,787 --> 01:03:34,480
Even if there was a
fraction of a chance...

737
01:03:34,504 --> 01:03:36,484
That what? That we
could raise a monster?

738
01:03:36,517 --> 01:03:37,331
Like Luthor did?

739
01:03:37,364 --> 01:03:38,506
We have tech Luthor's
never even seen...

740
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,242
Superman is dead.

741
01:03:41,425 --> 01:03:42,846
We all wish
he weren't.

742
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:44,440
We don't know
what state he's in.

743
01:03:44,673 --> 01:03:46,513
We know we can't
bring him back.

744
01:03:46,546 --> 01:03:49,076
But this is science
beyond our limits.

745
01:03:49,571 --> 01:03:50,764
And that's what
science is for.

746
01:03:50,797 --> 01:03:51,954
To do what's
never been done.

747
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:54,146
- To make life better.
- Or to end it.

748
01:03:54,346 --> 01:03:56,537
Technology is like
any other power...

749
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:59,381
Without reason, without
heart... It destroys us.

750
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,640
You're risking lives.

751
01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:05,063
Theirs and maybe
countless more.

752
01:04:05,096 --> 01:04:07,284
We don't have time
for a control group.

753
01:04:07,317 --> 01:04:09,353
Is it a risk? Yes.
But it's necessary.

754
01:04:09,386 --> 01:04:10,919
Why? Because
of your guilt?

755
01:04:13,151 --> 01:04:17,182
Bruce, I was there.
You didn't kill Superman.

756
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:19,690
At some point,
even you...

757
01:04:19,724 --> 01:04:21,327
have to learn
to move on.

758
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,677
Did Steve Trevor
tell you that?

759
01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:39,311
Superman, was a
beacon to the world.

760
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:41,981
Why aren't you?

761
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:45,748
You're an inspiration,
Diana.

762
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:47,275
You don't just
save people.

763
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:50,256
You make them see
their better selves.

764
01:04:50,589 --> 01:04:52,431
And yet, I never
heard of you...

765
01:04:52,464 --> 01:04:54,795
Until Luthor
lured you out

766
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:57,125
by stealing a picture of
your dead boyfriend.

767
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:02,434
You shut yourself
down for a century.

768
01:05:02,548 --> 01:05:04,735
So let's not talk
about me moving on.

769
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:06,985
You know...

770
01:05:07,018 --> 01:05:09,241
That if she kills you,
we'll cover for her.

771
01:05:09,357 --> 01:05:10,891
We are not enough.

772
01:05:11,743 --> 01:05:13,445
Each of us in our own
way has held back.

773
01:05:13,469 --> 01:05:15,834
And I promise you, Steppenwolf is
not out there talking about ethics.

774
01:05:15,952 --> 01:05:17,823
He's trying to burn
down the world.

775
01:05:18,924 --> 01:05:20,445
The way we're
gonna stop him...

776
01:05:20,478 --> 01:05:22,271
... is by using
his power.

777
01:05:22,304 --> 01:05:23,434
This power,

778
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:24,542
against him.

779
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,207
I agree.

780
01:05:28,934 --> 01:05:31,824
I don't like the idea of reintegrating
with the Mother Box...

781
01:05:32,115 --> 01:05:34,586
But I was running the numbers
while you're being an asshole,

782
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:36,972
and there's a high probability
that we can bring him back.

783
01:05:37,005 --> 01:05:39,205
Right, but we mean
bring him back, in like a...

784
01:05:39,238 --> 01:05:41,422
"Yay! He's back!"
way. Not in like a...

785
01:05:42,152 --> 01:05:43,373
Like a Pet Sematary

786
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,816
scenario?

787
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:48,275
You lose something when
you die. Even Superman.

788
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:51,827
Maybe not his mind.
Maybe his soul.

789
01:05:52,626 --> 01:05:54,501
I'll have a contingency
plan for that.

790
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:58,111
If he wakes up and you're
the first thing he sees...

791
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:00,026
You'll need one.

792
01:06:11,489 --> 01:06:13,835
Well that was fun
while it didn't last.

793
01:06:13,868 --> 01:06:16,100
She could've stopped me.
I practically dared her to.

794
01:06:16,133 --> 01:06:18,047
I don't see why
you're pushing her.

795
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:21,664
We'll have to
boost the signal.

796
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:23,301
Put it through the
Batmobile's speakers.

797
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:24,801
Now you're changing
the subject.

798
01:06:24,834 --> 01:06:25,989
I have a contingency.

799
01:06:26,013 --> 01:06:28,215
Diana was right
about the risk.

800
01:06:28,248 --> 01:06:30,884
If the plan goes south, we're
gonna bring in the big guns.

801
01:06:31,312 --> 01:06:32,359
But that's not...

802
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:34,989
Those are
very big guns.

803
01:06:35,022 --> 01:06:36,362
You got a
team here.

804
01:06:36,395 --> 01:06:39,268
Superman could bring this team
together better than I ever could.

805
01:06:39,301 --> 01:06:41,829
- His strength...
- It doesn't matter how strong you are.

806
01:06:41,862 --> 01:06:43,238
Or what abilities
you might have.

807
01:06:43,271 --> 01:06:44,927
He was more
human than I am.

808
01:06:49,434 --> 01:06:50,764
He lived in
this world.

809
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,664
Fell in love,
had a job.

810
01:06:54,586 --> 01:06:56,635
In spite of all
that power.

811
01:06:58,234 --> 01:06:59,930
The world needs
Superman.

812
01:07:03,206 --> 01:07:04,896
And the team
needs Clark.

813
01:07:05,638 --> 01:07:07,439
And what does
Clark need?

814
01:07:08,356 --> 01:07:10,201
Maybe he's
at peace.

815
01:07:11,018 --> 01:07:12,399
He'll get over it.

816
01:07:23,063 --> 01:07:25,893
You know, I can do
this a lot faster. I just...

817
01:07:26,322 --> 01:07:28,530
Is it weird that it
feels disrespectful?

818
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:29,634
Yep.

819
01:07:31,607 --> 01:07:33,060
Do you feel a
sense of confidence

820
01:07:33,445 --> 01:07:36,024
that we're not doing something
horribly wrong

821
01:07:36,057 --> 01:07:37,246
and macabre here?

822
01:07:38,092 --> 01:07:39,092
Not really.

823
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:42,322
- Okay then why are...
- Because I saw Steppenwolf up close.

824
01:07:42,326 --> 01:07:44,148
The stories
Diana told us?

825
01:07:44,381 --> 01:07:45,928
And I believe them.

826
01:07:47,204 --> 01:07:48,204
But we're gonna
stop him.

827
01:07:48,628 --> 01:07:50,051
That's the plan.

828
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:52,158
That's the plan!

829
01:07:55,469 --> 01:08:00,076
Okay, we're not ready
for... Racially charged...

830
01:08:01,898 --> 01:08:03,568
You got struck
by lightning, huh?

831
01:08:04,201 --> 01:08:06,203
Yeah... That's the
abridged version.

832
01:08:07,103 --> 01:08:08,948
- And you...?
- Explosion.

833
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:10,768
Woke up in a lab.

834
01:08:10,801 --> 01:08:12,444
We're, we're
the accidents.

835
01:08:13,831 --> 01:08:15,079
Yeah, that's us.

836
01:08:16,142 --> 01:08:18,162
Hey!

837
01:08:30,255 --> 01:08:32,464
We're approaching
the Kryptonian ship.

838
01:08:32,497 --> 01:08:34,457
ETA, 30 seconds.

839
01:08:40,142 --> 01:08:41,865
I'm here for him.

840
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:44,860
- I swear, I would never...
- Save it.

841
01:09:06,003 --> 01:09:07,433
- Okay.
- Okay!

842
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,834
Okay.

843
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:32,614
This is amazing.

844
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:34,719
This is crazy.

845
01:09:34,752 --> 01:09:36,291
What, now it's crazy?

846
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,139
You lunatics better
know what you're doing.

847
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:35,064
Lex Luthor fried the circuits
bringing his creature to life.

848
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,981
There's not enough charge
to wake the Box.

849
01:10:38,728 --> 01:10:40,218
I might be
able to do it.

850
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:42,238
I might be able to
jumpstart it, I...

851
01:10:42,262 --> 01:10:43,637
If I can get
enough distance...

852
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:45,690
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.

853
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:46,954
I might be able to
wake the Box,

854
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:49,909
if that's still
what we want?

855
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:51,433
We have to try.

856
01:10:56,435 --> 01:10:58,260
This must be the
end of the line, so...

857
01:10:58,293 --> 01:10:59,447
I'm in position.

858
01:11:03,156 --> 01:11:04,337
The Mother
Box is ready.

859
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:06,575
You have to charge it the
moment it touches the fluid.

860
01:11:06,908 --> 01:11:08,589
- Five.
- Five...

861
01:11:08,622 --> 01:11:11,391
Diana's right. This
is a bad idea.

862
01:11:11,903 --> 01:11:13,964
Four.

863
01:11:14,908 --> 01:11:15,774
Three.

864
01:11:15,907 --> 01:11:17,037
Three...

865
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:18,313
Two.

866
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:19,992
Two.

867
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,610
One.

868
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:03,252
Give us an ETA on
all additional units...

869
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,465
He's back.

870
01:13:30,805 --> 01:13:32,251
He's not all right.

871
01:13:35,788 --> 01:13:37,326
He's scanning us.

872
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:38,137
What?

873
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:40,496
Arthur, you need to relax.
Your adrenaline's spiking.

874
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:41,677
Because he's
not all right.

875
01:13:41,711 --> 01:13:42,657
Oh, no.

876
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,531
Should we bow?
Or show our bellies?

877
01:13:48,455 --> 01:13:49,241
Victor...

878
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:50,493
Victor, stop.

879
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,385
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

880
01:13:52,508 --> 01:13:53,070
Victor.

881
01:13:53,082 --> 01:13:54,677
- It's my armor's defense system...
- No.

882
01:13:54,766 --> 01:13:55,816
It's stronger since
the interface...

883
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,669
- I can't control it.
- Victor, no!

884
01:13:57,702 --> 01:14:00,162
- Shut it off!
- Think of happy thoughts, Victor!

885
01:14:13,384 --> 01:14:14,839
Kal-El, no!

886
01:14:22,889 --> 01:14:25,286
He's confused, he
doesn't know who he is.

887
01:14:25,521 --> 01:14:26,913
Pet Sematary.

888
01:14:32,402 --> 01:14:34,860
Arthur, we need
to restrain him.

889
01:14:40,366 --> 01:14:41,527
I got him.

890
01:14:59,168 --> 01:15:02,377
Kal-El, the last
son of Krypton...

891
01:15:03,796 --> 01:15:05,894
Remember
who you are.

892
01:15:07,709 --> 01:15:08,841
Tell me who you...

893
01:16:06,547 --> 01:16:07,768
Clark...

894
01:16:11,839 --> 01:16:13,392
I know you.

895
01:16:19,823 --> 01:16:21,833
Please don't
make me do this.

896
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:44,618
Alfred, I need
the big gun...

897
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:53,564
- You did this...
- I had to.

898
01:16:54,273 --> 01:16:55,880
You won't let me live.

899
01:16:57,163 --> 01:16:58,714
You won't let me die.

900
01:16:59,628 --> 01:17:01,229
The world needs you.

901
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,409
But does it need you?

902
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:10,714
Tell me...

903
01:17:12,746 --> 01:17:14,506
Do you bleed?

904
01:17:16,222 --> 01:17:17,438
Clark.

905
01:17:26,038 --> 01:17:27,153
Clark.

906
01:17:28,595 --> 01:17:29,914
Please...

907
01:17:48,778 --> 01:17:50,317
Please.

908
01:17:57,571 --> 01:17:58,621
Please,

909
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,114
just go.

910
01:18:01,773 --> 01:18:02,933
Yeah?

911
01:18:03,672 --> 01:18:06,556
Let's go. Yeah...

912
01:18:16,346 --> 01:18:20,228
Yeah. Something's
definitely bleeding.

913
01:18:40,244 --> 01:18:41,420
The Mother Box.

914
01:18:43,072 --> 01:18:44,556
He has the last one.

915
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:00,986
You brought us here.

916
01:19:02,526 --> 01:19:03,942
You remembered.

917
01:19:06,548 --> 01:19:07,817
This is home.

918
01:19:10,154 --> 01:19:11,706
You smell good.

919
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,049
Did I not before?

920
01:19:32,884 --> 01:19:33,930
Don't do that.

921
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,244
We just got our
asses handed to us

922
01:19:36,277 --> 01:19:37,952
and Steppenwolf
has got the third Box.

923
01:19:37,985 --> 01:19:39,359
So we find them.

924
01:19:40,604 --> 01:19:42,566
If the Boxes are even
close to each other

925
01:19:42,641 --> 01:19:44,218
there's going to
be some kind

926
01:19:44,241 --> 01:19:45,520
of energy surge.

927
01:19:45,553 --> 01:19:47,748
And Steppenwolf's gonna be keeping
them somewhere where they don't read.

928
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:49,910
No internet, no
satellite coverage.

929
01:19:49,912 --> 01:19:51,175
That narrows it down.

930
01:19:51,408 --> 01:19:52,670
Not enough.

931
01:19:52,703 --> 01:19:54,272
See, you can't
find them...

932
01:19:54,505 --> 01:19:56,244
... or maybe you
don't want to.

933
01:19:59,486 --> 01:20:00,068
Arthur.

934
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,005
Yeah, that was a great way
to get rid of Superman.

935
01:20:02,029 --> 01:20:04,267
Man, I'm not doing
this on purpose.

936
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,601
Right. Because you can't
control the machine.

937
01:20:07,268 --> 01:20:09,073
Right, so is this
a bad time

938
01:20:09,107 --> 01:20:10,878
to bring up
my blood sugar?

939
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:14,568
Very hungry....

940
01:20:16,281 --> 01:20:17,281
Victor...

941
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:19,978
You can find the Boxes.

942
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:21,575
You share their energy.

943
01:20:21,908 --> 01:20:24,330
I know it's frightening.
But if you go under...

944
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:27,177
I promise, we will
pull you back out.

945
01:20:30,599 --> 01:20:33,056
Just keep the Little Merman
away from me while I work.

946
01:20:36,914 --> 01:20:39,249
Barry, go find Alfred
in the pantry.

947
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:40,793
Then come back,
get online.

948
01:20:40,817 --> 01:20:42,500
Everybody check
everybody else's work.

949
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:44,881
Listen,

950
01:20:45,044 --> 01:20:48,015
just wanted if you
could, put out a,

951
01:20:48,048 --> 01:20:51,287
if you were,
an aquatic...

952
01:20:51,619 --> 01:20:52,802
You know...

953
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:55,076
Do you, talk to fish?

954
01:20:56,864 --> 01:20:59,535
The water does
the talking.

955
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:01,335
Of course.

956
01:21:01,368 --> 01:21:03,797
If the current comes in strange,
I'm gonna point the way.

957
01:21:04,797 --> 01:21:05,974
Okay.

958
01:21:29,357 --> 01:21:30,480
Wait.

959
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:32,574
Let me.

960
01:21:33,538 --> 01:21:35,200
Isn't this a little
out of place.

961
01:21:38,289 --> 01:21:40,922
So, Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

962
01:21:40,955 --> 01:21:42,136
He could've killed you.

963
01:21:42,646 --> 01:21:44,439
I was willing to
make the trade.

964
01:21:46,545 --> 01:21:48,395
And bringing in
Lois Lane?

965
01:21:48,649 --> 01:21:51,063
Remember what you told me
about heart, in the hangar?

966
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:52,110
I bet you...

967
01:21:52,195 --> 01:21:53,763
... thought I
wasn't listening.

968
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:55,980
Thank you.

969
01:21:59,634 --> 01:22:01,593
You know you can't
do this forever.

970
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:03,481
I can barely
do it now.

971
01:22:04,318 --> 01:22:05,578
Steppenwolf...

972
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:07,173
This is the job.

973
01:22:07,207 --> 01:22:08,434
It's my job.

974
01:22:09,739 --> 01:22:11,032
And I haven't
been doing it.

975
01:22:11,065 --> 01:22:12,319
I've been reacting.

976
01:22:13,091 --> 01:22:14,373
Not leading.

977
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,137
You know, what you said
about Steve Trevor...

978
01:22:19,181 --> 01:22:20,792
That wasn't my
business. I'm sorry.

979
01:22:22,847 --> 01:22:25,056
You were pushing
me to lead the team.

980
01:22:25,821 --> 01:22:28,089
But leaders get
people killed.

981
01:22:29,391 --> 01:22:30,499
I fought...

982
01:22:30,632 --> 01:22:31,812
Always...

983
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,822
When I was needed.

984
01:22:34,755 --> 01:22:36,771
But to lead, to
step into the light...

985
01:22:36,804 --> 01:22:38,204
And to say
to people:

986
01:22:38,597 --> 01:22:40,867
"This is worth your life?"

987
01:22:42,603 --> 01:22:44,383
When it's your fault...

988
01:22:46,405 --> 01:22:48,269
They're all Steve Trevor.

989
01:22:50,805 --> 01:22:52,458
We make it
through tonight...

990
01:22:52,491 --> 01:22:54,652
You can stay in
the shadows forever.

991
01:22:55,985 --> 01:22:57,318
Dressed up
like a bat.

992
01:22:57,351 --> 01:22:58,623
I won't even sue.

993
01:22:59,838 --> 01:23:02,291
If... we get
through the night.

994
01:23:23,087 --> 01:23:24,388
Are you okay?

995
01:23:26,924 --> 01:23:29,615
You brought us here, but you've
hardly spent a minute in the house.

996
01:23:30,117 --> 01:23:32,077
I know... I...

997
01:23:34,299 --> 01:23:36,175
Just got out of
a wooden box.

998
01:23:38,732 --> 01:23:40,220
What was it like...

999
01:23:42,028 --> 01:23:43,374
Coming back?

1000
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:48,426
Itchy.

1001
01:23:50,413 --> 01:23:52,026
I mean, honestly...

1002
01:23:52,624 --> 01:23:53,544
Weird,

1003
01:23:53,572 --> 01:23:55,510
in so many ways.

1004
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:59,220
- But, mostly just...
- I wasn't strong.

1005
01:24:02,566 --> 01:24:03,848
I didn't...

1006
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:07,273
You would've been
very disappointed in me.

1007
01:24:07,306 --> 01:24:08,478
I wasn't...

1008
01:24:09,446 --> 01:24:11,771
Lois Lane, dedicated
reporter. I...

1009
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:13,508
I just...

1010
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:15,449
It's okay.

1011
01:24:18,295 --> 01:24:19,931
I'm the idiot who left.

1012
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:22,344
But I'm back now...

1013
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:25,166
And I'm gonna
make things right.

1014
01:24:45,953 --> 01:24:47,324
You called mom?

1015
01:24:48,637 --> 01:24:49,940
Of course.

1016
01:24:50,422 --> 01:24:51,574
Thank you.

1017
01:24:54,152 --> 01:24:55,930
I was hoping it was
gonna take you longer to...

1018
01:24:55,963 --> 01:24:57,643
... recover.

1019
01:24:59,147 --> 01:25:00,147
Why?

1020
01:25:01,357 --> 01:25:03,597
Because now, I have
to send you away.

1021
01:25:06,453 --> 01:25:07,486
Bruce.

1022
01:25:07,819 --> 01:25:09,293
He needs you.

1023
01:25:09,659 --> 01:25:11,843
Fate of the world. I think
that's the deal. He was...

1024
01:25:11,876 --> 01:25:13,152
Pretty tense.

1025
01:25:13,315 --> 01:25:15,241
Well, I guess I
do owe him one.

1026
01:25:16,755 --> 01:25:17,796
Right.

1027
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,419
But no dying.

1028
01:25:21,226 --> 01:25:23,002
And I get
the exclusive.

1029
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:25,084
Yes, ma'am.

1030
01:26:01,511 --> 01:26:04,086
- You're really you?
- I'm really me, ma.

1031
01:26:16,427 --> 01:26:17,762
At last.

1032
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:22,046
Praise to the Unity.

1033
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:26,300
The three is one.

1034
01:26:54,286 --> 01:26:57,674
Praise to the
Mother of Horrors.

1035
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,638
Is Steppenwolf there?

1036
01:27:11,539 --> 01:27:12,539
Sorry.

1037
01:27:13,177 --> 01:27:15,144
It's Porzenov.
In Northern Russia.

1038
01:27:15,177 --> 01:27:16,549
The Nuclear Plant.

1039
01:27:16,608 --> 01:27:18,502
Had a meltdown
30 years ago.

1040
01:27:18,735 --> 01:27:20,697
There have been some
attempts to resettle nearby...

1041
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:22,844
... but it looks like
really rough sledding.

1042
01:27:23,242 --> 01:27:25,610
Who picks this place
to put down roots?

1043
01:27:25,783 --> 01:27:27,955
People that are making
it count everywhere else.

1044
01:27:28,323 --> 01:27:30,175
The Earth starts
changing...

1045
01:27:30,293 --> 01:27:31,706
... it'll hit them first.

1046
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:33,115
How long
have we got?

1047
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:34,293
A few hours.

1048
01:27:34,817 --> 01:27:36,777
Transport won't
fly that fast.

1049
01:27:37,854 --> 01:27:39,416
It will for me.

1050
01:28:20,602 --> 01:28:23,872
The Unity brings all three
boxes together in perfect sync.

1051
01:28:25,089 --> 01:28:26,140
Its power builds

1052
01:28:26,212 --> 01:28:27,805
until it can't
be contained.

1053
01:28:28,543 --> 01:28:30,689
But if I can cause a
delay between each box,

1054
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:32,112
even for a
nanosecond...

1055
01:28:32,145 --> 01:28:34,804
Its energy will cascade.
Form a loop.

1056
01:28:34,837 --> 01:28:36,002
And they'll feed
on each other.

1057
01:28:36,026 --> 01:28:37,969
And that's it? We
just pull them apart?

1058
01:28:38,054 --> 01:28:39,469
No fuss, no muss?

1059
01:28:39,502 --> 01:28:42,405
Separating the boxes is still
gonna cause a massive surge.

1060
01:28:42,438 --> 01:28:43,495
I have to
be there.

1061
01:28:43,849 --> 01:28:45,556
But you guys should
think about getting clear.

1062
01:28:45,589 --> 01:28:47,021
We're with you
'till it's done.

1063
01:28:47,054 --> 01:28:47,619
Honestly...

1064
01:28:47,652 --> 01:28:49,612
I think we're gonna be
dead way before that.

1065
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:51,093
And you know what?

1066
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:54,018
I don't mind. It's
an honorable end.

1067
01:28:54,697 --> 01:28:56,712
But we've gotta shut
Steppenwolf down.

1068
01:28:57,445 --> 01:28:58,939
Superman's
a no-show.

1069
01:28:59,072 --> 01:29:00,276
You've got
no powers.

1070
01:29:00,309 --> 01:29:01,202
No offense.

1071
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:03,595
This guy might be working
for the enemy. We don't know.

1072
01:29:03,696 --> 01:29:06,019
You're tripping over
your feet, and mine...

1073
01:29:08,337 --> 01:29:09,750
You're gorgeous.

1074
01:29:09,783 --> 01:29:10,702
And fierce...

1075
01:29:10,735 --> 01:29:11,886
And strong. And...

1076
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:13,846
I know we went to war
with the Amazons, but...

1077
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:15,095
but that was
before my time.

1078
01:29:15,128 --> 01:29:17,247
You know what?
I don't wanna die.

1079
01:29:17,371 --> 01:29:19,544
I'm young. There's
shit that I wanna do.

1080
01:29:20,473 --> 01:29:21,398
I just feel like...

1081
01:29:21,431 --> 01:29:23,974
I didn't really embrace
the sea or the land.

1082
01:29:24,298 --> 01:29:25,741
I've been a loner
my whole life.

1083
01:29:25,774 --> 01:29:27,038
But being part of
something bigger,

1084
01:29:27,288 --> 01:29:28,775
like this...

1085
01:29:29,765 --> 01:29:31,502
Maybe I'm
scared because...

1086
01:29:32,526 --> 01:29:33,526
I'm meant to...

1087
01:29:45,189 --> 01:29:47,238
I think that
was beautiful.

1088
01:29:50,605 --> 01:29:53,592
You say a word about this,
and I'll meet every prawn I know.

1089
01:29:56,410 --> 01:29:59,430
I honestly didn't hear anything
after "We're all gonna die."

1090
01:30:21,146 --> 01:30:23,131
Let them come.

1091
01:30:30,982 --> 01:30:33,812
I'm gonna take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

1092
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,246
You get to
Steppenwolf.

1093
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:37,419
Don't wait for me.
Just do the job.

1094
01:31:41,446 --> 01:31:43,915
Alright, Alfred. Are we
set to broadcast?

1095
01:31:43,948 --> 01:31:46,440
Playing all
your favorite hits.

1096
01:31:56,764 --> 01:31:59,075
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.

1097
01:32:10,075 --> 01:32:14,440
They're coming.
They're all coming.

1098
01:32:18,662 --> 01:32:21,255
We might not have
thought this through.

1099
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:26,523
He's clearing the field.

1100
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:28,740
He won't last
three minutes.

1101
01:32:28,773 --> 01:32:30,067
Then let's use them.

1102
01:32:33,793 --> 01:32:34,918
On my lead.

1103
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,780
They're leaving.

1104
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:55,969
<i>Papa.</i>

1105
01:32:56,411 --> 01:32:57,829
Everyone, get out!

1106
01:33:51,418 --> 01:33:52,841
Son of a bitch.

1107
01:34:06,253 --> 01:34:07,549
This isn't the plan.

1108
01:34:07,582 --> 01:34:08,748
No, Master Wayne...

1109
01:34:09,547 --> 01:34:11,078
... this is the team.

1110
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:13,131
Hey, blame the lady.

1111
01:34:13,164 --> 01:34:14,071
We would've left you

1112
01:34:14,104 --> 01:34:15,273
but she didn't
ask for our vote.

1113
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:20,685
So your genius
move is dying?

1114
01:34:21,149 --> 01:34:22,780
You really are
out of your mind.

1115
01:34:22,813 --> 01:34:24,895
I'm not the one who
brought a pitchfork.

1116
01:34:48,264 --> 01:34:50,466
- Ride ain't over yet.
- My man.

1117
01:35:36,148 --> 01:35:37,978
Is this what
conquering is?

1118
01:35:38,181 --> 01:35:39,776
Hiding from the fight?

1119
01:35:40,482 --> 01:35:42,243
Oh, no...

1120
01:35:42,667 --> 01:35:44,730
You're all mine.

1121
01:35:50,284 --> 01:35:52,055
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

1122
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:53,130
You got this?

1123
01:35:55,212 --> 01:35:56,650
These things are
gonna keep coming.

1124
01:35:56,683 --> 01:35:58,612
You get technical.
I'm on bug duty.

1125
01:35:58,745 --> 01:35:59,903
Let's do it.

1126
01:36:04,713 --> 01:36:06,467
Yes! That's gross.

1127
01:36:27,525 --> 01:36:28,652
Thank you.

1128
01:36:33,304 --> 01:36:34,630
This is not...

1129
01:36:54,791 --> 01:36:55,510
Now,

1130
01:36:55,543 --> 01:36:56,933
do you see it?

1131
01:37:17,371 --> 01:37:18,778
Whatever you're
in the middle of...

1132
01:37:18,811 --> 01:37:20,382
It's spreading
for miles.

1133
01:37:20,695 --> 01:37:23,066
Satellites show
civilians moving east.

1134
01:37:23,987 --> 01:37:25,296
They're not
gonna make it.

1135
01:37:25,429 --> 01:37:26,490
Barry...

1136
01:37:26,694 --> 01:37:28,276
I need you to
take a walk.

1137
01:37:35,238 --> 01:37:36,826
God, I hope
this is east.

1138
01:37:48,224 --> 01:37:49,319
Diana.

1139
01:38:22,968 --> 01:38:25,375
You're not worthy,
to touch

1140
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,642
Mother.

1141
01:38:26,775 --> 01:38:28,393
She's power.

1142
01:38:28,426 --> 01:38:29,736
And power,

1143
01:38:29,769 --> 01:38:31,883
is the only law.

1144
01:38:37,819 --> 01:38:41,011
They're all too weak
to see the truth.

1145
01:38:41,144 --> 01:38:42,427
Well...

1146
01:38:43,888 --> 01:38:45,459
I believe in truth.

1147
01:38:46,846 --> 01:38:48,904
But I'm also a
big fan of justice.

1148
01:38:57,369 --> 01:38:58,733
All right!

1149
01:39:02,829 --> 01:39:04,399
Kryptonian.

1150
01:39:21,886 --> 01:39:23,171
So. How
do I help?

1151
01:39:23,204 --> 01:39:24,294
We buy him
some time,

1152
01:39:24,327 --> 01:39:27,004
he can stop that box from
destroying all life on Earth.

1153
01:39:27,996 --> 01:39:29,179
We hope.

1154
01:39:29,212 --> 01:39:31,878
Well, I knew you didn't bring
me back 'cause you like me.

1155
01:39:32,211 --> 01:39:34,553
I don't... not...

1156
01:39:40,494 --> 01:39:41,294
Civilians...

1157
01:39:41,404 --> 01:39:43,193
- Barry is headed...
- There's too many of them.

1158
01:40:07,142 --> 01:40:10,459
Oh, yeah. This is
definitely east.

1159
01:40:16,534 --> 01:40:17,534
Slowpoke.

1160
01:40:18,123 --> 01:40:19,184
Oh, it's on.

1161
01:40:19,317 --> 01:40:20,901
I'll take the ones
on the right.

1162
01:40:24,056 --> 01:40:25,056
It's okay.

1163
01:40:25,699 --> 01:40:27,367
Hold on. Hold on.

1164
01:40:45,899 --> 01:40:47,344
Dostoyevski!

1165
01:41:04,435 --> 01:41:06,131
Is this guy still
bothering you?

1166
01:41:20,404 --> 01:41:21,468
Superman!

1167
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,421
We gotta pull
these things apart.

1168
01:41:23,454 --> 01:41:24,670
A couple of
more seconds...

1169
01:41:24,769 --> 01:41:26,221
you'll see
her opening.

1170
01:41:26,684 --> 01:41:27,887
Any blow-back?

1171
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:28,920
Big-time.

1172
01:41:29,294 --> 01:41:30,608
But I think we
can take it.

1173
01:41:30,632 --> 01:41:31,722
Good...

1174
01:41:32,549 --> 01:41:34,279
Because I really
like being alive.

1175
01:41:35,147 --> 01:41:36,399
So do I.

1176
01:41:59,866 --> 01:42:01,161
Clark.

1177
01:42:07,106 --> 01:42:08,365
I take it back...

1178
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:10,451
I wanna die.

1179
01:42:14,565 --> 01:42:16,877
Man, my toes hurt.

1180
01:42:17,521 --> 01:42:20,391
I don't even understand the
physics of how my toes hurt.

1181
01:42:21,948 --> 01:42:23,345
Children.

1182
01:42:23,594 --> 01:42:25,207
I work with children.

1183
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:30,720
Have you guys seen
what's going on outside?

1184
01:42:40,024 --> 01:42:43,256
I am the end
of worlds.

1185
01:42:44,577 --> 01:42:46,191
Who are you,

1186
01:42:46,224 --> 01:42:47,626
to defy me?

1187
01:42:49,599 --> 01:42:51,216
This world...

1188
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:52,940
... is my right!

1189
01:42:53,073 --> 01:42:54,914
You will never...

1190
01:43:14,347 --> 01:43:15,908
No!

1191
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:17,389
This cannot be...

1192
01:43:17,551 --> 01:43:19,480
Recognize that smell?

1193
01:43:21,225 --> 01:43:22,427
Fear.

1194
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:27,983
No! Leave me!

1195
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:32,864
Get off me!

1196
01:43:32,897 --> 01:43:34,284
I command you!

1197
01:43:35,366 --> 01:43:36,629
No!

1198
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:40,887
No...

1199
01:43:41,742 --> 01:43:43,791
I'll kill you!

1200
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:45,930
I'll kill you all!

1201
01:44:11,098 --> 01:44:12,459
Booyah!

1202
01:44:37,502 --> 01:44:39,150
Glad I didn't
miss this.

1203
01:44:40,432 --> 01:44:41,889
So am I.

1204
01:44:42,408 --> 01:44:43,468
Yeah.

1205
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,039
Now she's glad.

1206
01:45:15,628 --> 01:45:17,169
Thank you, Bruce.

1207
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:18,969
Not enough for
what you did.

1208
01:45:18,993 --> 01:45:20,935
I did a mistake.

1209
01:45:20,968 --> 01:45:22,213
That's all.

1210
01:45:31,389 --> 01:45:33,109
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

1211
01:45:34,342 --> 01:45:35,837
I bought the bank.

1212
01:45:38,415 --> 01:45:39,430
The whole bank?

1213
01:45:39,463 --> 01:45:40,876
Slow your
reflex with me.

1214
01:45:40,911 --> 01:45:42,096
I'm old.

1215
01:45:45,942 --> 01:45:47,031
What?

1216
01:45:47,128 --> 01:45:48,098
It's actually the,

1217
01:45:48,139 --> 01:45:50,262
worst job you can
get in a crime lab.

1218
01:45:50,295 --> 01:45:51,102
But, uh...

1219
01:45:51,135 --> 01:45:52,535
My foot's
in the door.

1220
01:45:52,912 --> 01:45:55,864
Yeah. I got a recommendation
from a friend.

1221
01:45:55,897 --> 01:45:57,547
This is like a "job" job?

1222
01:45:58,170 --> 01:45:59,394
"Job" job.

1223
01:46:03,151 --> 01:46:04,502
Look at you go!

1224
01:46:22,647 --> 01:46:23,756
Darkness.

1225
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,643
The truest
darkness...

1226
01:46:25,676 --> 01:46:27,811
... is not the
absence of light.

1227
01:46:29,722 --> 01:46:31,404
It is the conviction
that the light...

1228
01:46:31,437 --> 01:46:32,929
... will never return.

1229
01:46:33,801 --> 01:46:36,159
Must be 150 feet.

1230
01:46:36,292 --> 01:46:37,370
Must be.

1231
01:46:39,006 --> 01:46:40,447
Big round table.

1232
01:46:40,782 --> 01:46:41,998
Six chairs.

1233
01:46:42,031 --> 01:46:43,031
Right there.

1234
01:46:44,129 --> 01:46:45,344
With room for more.

1235
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:49,512
With room for more.

1236
01:46:51,304 --> 01:46:53,747
But the light
always returns...

1237
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:55,825
... to show us
things familiar.

1238
01:46:57,326 --> 01:46:58,473
Home.

1239
01:46:58,928 --> 01:47:00,094
Family.

1240
01:47:01,855 --> 01:47:04,025
And things
entirely new.

1241
01:47:04,672 --> 01:47:06,565
Or long overlooked.

1242
01:47:11,713 --> 01:47:14,366
It shows us
new possibilities...

1243
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:16,772
And challenges us
to pursue them.

1244
01:47:18,176 --> 01:47:20,323
Yeah. And Johnny Menasco
runs the whole thing.

1245
01:47:20,358 --> 01:47:22,281
I mean, he did the
Bilbao job 2 years ago.

1246
01:47:22,315 --> 01:47:24,056
As are all the
storage in Croydon.

1247
01:47:24,091 --> 01:47:25,819
- The Belgian.
- Right, yeah. The Belgian.

1248
01:47:25,853 --> 01:47:29,247
This time, the light
shone on the heroes.

1249
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:30,542
Coming out of
the shadows

1250
01:47:30,575 --> 01:47:33,026
to tell us we won't
be alone again.

1251
01:47:35,337 --> 01:47:37,434
Our darkness was deep...

1252
01:47:37,467 --> 01:47:39,746
... and seemed to
swallow all hope.

1253
01:47:40,348 --> 01:47:43,210
But these heroes were
here the whole time.

1254
01:47:43,798 --> 01:47:46,507
To remind us
that hope is real.

1255
01:47:47,191 --> 01:47:48,976
That you can see it.

1256
01:47:53,682 --> 01:47:55,879
All you have
to do is look....

1257
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:00,192
Up in the sky...

1258
01:48:09,477 --> 01:48:17,477
<i>Justice League (2017)
Creados por
TaMaBin</i>

1259
01:48:58,538 --> 01:49:00,924
I can't tell you how much I
appreciate you doing this.

1260
01:49:01,328 --> 01:49:02,946
I don't know, Barry.

1261
01:49:03,379 --> 01:49:04,514
I'm curious myself.

1262
01:49:04,547 --> 01:49:06,609
Yeah. And it's not like a
competition, you know?

1263
01:49:06,642 --> 01:49:07,752
Well, it...

1264
01:49:07,785 --> 01:49:08,755
It is a
competition.

1265
01:49:08,788 --> 01:49:12,184
But it's not like a macho-
measuring thing.

1266
01:49:12,217 --> 01:49:13,606
But if I win, you're
off the team.

1267
01:49:19,687 --> 01:49:21,083
No...

1268
01:49:22,533 --> 01:49:23,777
If I win...

1269
01:49:24,245 --> 01:49:27,547
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to "brunch"...?

1270
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:29,858
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1271
01:49:30,291 --> 01:49:31,781
I feel stung by that.

1272
01:49:33,481 --> 01:49:35,262
Okay. But if I win, I
get to tell everyone.

1273
01:49:35,286 --> 01:49:36,370
Deal.

1274
01:49:37,282 --> 01:49:38,520
Which coast?

1275
01:49:39,248 --> 01:49:40,938
You know, I've never
seen the pacific.

1276
01:49:42,153 --> 01:49:44,615
Which is that
way, because...

1277
01:49:45,362 --> 01:49:47,029
The sun, and it's...
