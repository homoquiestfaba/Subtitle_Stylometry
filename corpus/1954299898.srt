I'm sorry that I have to come drop the inevitable,

not deal on his own punishment.

she fell into a deep slumber.

around the castle to keep people out.

Did you see it?

363
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,083
- You did this!
- Shut up!

364
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,918
I told you, it wasn't safe!

365
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:22,083
Should've listen to Gruner.

366
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,042
My Lord, which way now?

367
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:28,918
My Lord!

368
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,000
Barrow?

369
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:41,001
Follow me.

370
00:28:41,918 --> 00:28:43,918
You don't lead, you follow.

371
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:50,083
Follow me.

372
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:55,959
We'll keep moving!

373
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,042
What was that thing?

374
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:05,959
You can't seriously expect us to go on.

375
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,876
Frederich's dead!

376
00:29:08,918 --> 00:29:11,083
I told you, it was part of the curse.

377
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:15,959
What do you say, Gruner?

378
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:18,043
How do you know of this curse?

379
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,083
Why don't you say anything sooner?

380
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,918
My grandfather was a night.

381
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:29,042
He tell my father the story and he told me.

382
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:32,876
That within the walls of that castle,
the dead walk of a living snake.

383
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:36,000
The whole kingdom is berserk with a curse.

384
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,083
- Why did you not say anything sooner?
- I never thought to pay much attention!

385
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:46,042
What does he mean?

386
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:50,000
It means we are all walking towards our own death.

387
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,918
Alright men, let's search for a way in.

388
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:09,918
I wouldn't much want a kingdom like this.

389
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:11,001
Quiet!

390
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,125
No one asked you.

391
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:15,125
Ah!

392
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:17,083
My Lord..

393
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:21,042
There's some kind of force.

394
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:23,042
Surrounding the castle.

395
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:25,042
We can't get in any of the doors.

396
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,083
Or windows.

397
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:28,083
I've never seen anything like this.

398
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,125
No one has.

399
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:31,918
This is Tambria's magic.

400
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,083
Another warning.

401
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,042
We should rest here, my Lord.

402
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,042
Nonsense..

403
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:42,001
We'll rest once I am inside my castle.

404
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:45,918
Look, there's something there on the walls.

405
00:30:49,918 --> 00:30:50,876
What is that?

406
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:54,918
Something unholly..

407
00:30:55,001 --> 00:31:00,918
From time to time, many sons of kings,
came and try to force their way through.

408
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,125
But they were hold,

409
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,042
in there they died a,

410
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,042
an lamentable death.

411
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,918
Look, up there.

412
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:11,918
An open window.

413
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:14,083
Well, my Lord?

414
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,000
Are we going up?

415
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,083
I think it would be wise to let the men rest.

416
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:24,959
We'll make a camp over here, tonight.

417
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:27,001
Very well, we'll keep watch.

418
00:31:29,043 --> 00:31:30,083
Before that..

419
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:33,042
We should have Barrow tested it out for us.

420
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,000
See if he can go up and down,

421
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,000
without facing, what was it you said?

422
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:40,918
Oh, yes..

423
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,876
A lamentable death.

424
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,083

Hey..

00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,000
This is a bad, bad place.

428
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:13,042
Maybe we should go back.

429
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:14,918
Go back?

430
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,918
Through the lake?

431
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,918
Then we camp.

432
00:32:21,918 --> 00:32:23,083
I want to stay here.

433
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,876
There's been no way out.

434
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:28,042
Look, hear me, brother.

435
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:30,000
We'll be alright.

436
00:32:31,043 --> 00:32:32,918
The worst part is over.

437
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:38,043
Inside that castle, we will be rich, treasure.

438
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,083
And once we're inside,

439
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:44,001
it'll all be ours.

440
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:46,918
Or we die.

441
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:52,959
What of this lady of yours said?

442
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:55,083
The wall is high, you're sure to die.

00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:00,876
It doesn't look too bad.

445
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:04,001
It'll just be like, climbing the wall back home.

447
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,918
A little bit further, Barrow.

00:33:31,918 --> 00:33:33,001
What can you see?

449
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,918
This is an empty roof.

450
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:38,125
Go inside..

451
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:42,834
Secure the rope.

452
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:45,876
We're all are going in tomorrow.

453
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,083

What are you a girl or a boy?

I don't know what you think you are,

Look, this men are thiefs and rapists.

461
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:38,083
You shouldn't be here.

462
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:40,000
And I could say the same for you.

463
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:44,043
This is no place for a heavy man,
who rather jink and lay down women.

464
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,083
This is a dangerous place.

465
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:49,001
So we've seen.

466
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,918
What are you doing here?

467
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:55,043
What are you a fugitive or thief in your own mind?

468
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,001
We saw the terrible thing
that happened to the king,

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,918
starved, kicked, and ends up with the dogs.

470

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,083
And how did you get in there?

472
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:08,125
I climbed for two days and I can't get out.

What was that noise?

It was the kingdom saying we're not welcome.

I'll have no such insolence in my ranks.

Now go and get the men some food.

And at first light, the prince wants
to see if there's another way in.
