163
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,488
You'd run away.

164
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,392
<i>I would live to fight</i>
<i>another day.</i>

165
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,226
And paint many,
many more.

166
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,163
<i>(Trish)</i>
<i>We're out.</i>
<i>Shay, you coming?</i>

167
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,292
No, I think
I'm gonna stay
and finish this.

168
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,098
<i>Whatever.</i>

169
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,703
What's your name?

170
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,798
Jordan Wells.

171
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,802
Shay Bettencourt.

172
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,746
What are you doing
after school today?

173
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,009
Do you have
a car?

174
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,699
It's right here.

175
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,231
Thanks.

176
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,741
Thanks?

177
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,837
That's all I get?
Thought we were
going get to hang out.

178
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,142
I'm sorry.
I have work.

179
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,706
Can you get someone
to cover your shift?

180
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,049
My boss doesn't like it
when we do that.

181
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,178
Where's that?

182
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,722
Oak Valley.

183
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,418
<i>The country club?</i>
<i>My father's</i>
<i>a member.</i>

184
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,791
I've done your brunches.
It's not really my scene.

185
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,853
You don't like
the food?

186
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,694
I don't like
the cigar smoke.

187
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,200
Guess you haven't
been in a while.

188
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,033
There's a new
no smoking policy
in the main dining room.

189
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,596
It's not the smoke
that bothers me.

190
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,665
Thanks for the ride.

191
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,710
<i>(Desiree)</i>
<i>Good afternoon</i>
<i>and welcome to MoKA.</i>

192
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,715
<i>This is some</i>
<i>useful information</i>

193
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,752
<i>you guys are gonna</i>
<i>need tomorrow for</i>
<i>the press release.</i>

194
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,754
You're welcome.
Here you go.

195
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,255
Thank you, dear.

196
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,185
<i>Okay. Well,</i>
<i>let's begin.</i>

197
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,699
<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Desiree Thomas.</i>

198
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,038
<i>She fit perfectly</i>
<i>in the scripted world.</i>

199
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,943
<i>Did everything</i>
<i>with a natural grace.</i>

200
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,845
<i>Comfortable</i>
<i>wherever she was.</i>

201
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,712
<i>Effortless.</i>

202
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:38,417
<i>Seems everything I did</i>
<i>was calculated to get me</i>
<i>somewhere else.</i>

203
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,517
<i>Took me twice as</i>
<i>much energy for</i>
<i>half the result.</i>

204
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,357
<i>We dated a few times</i>
<i>but there was</i>
<i>no mystery.</i>

205
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,500
<i>A good relationship</i>
<i>needs mystery.</i>

206
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,375
<i>[Ding-dong]</i>

207
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,109
(woman)
Yes?

208
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,775
H i. Is Shay home?

209
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,011
I'm sorry?

210
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,452
Shay? We go
to Edgerton together.

211
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,990
I think you have
the wrong house.

212
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,992
Is this
the Bettencourts?

213
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,391
No.

214
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,472
I dropped
my lipstick.

215
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,235
I noticed.

216
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,345
<i>Aren't you</i>
<i>gonna ask?</i>

217
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,040
What?
Your real address?

218
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,413
<i>Nice fake.</i>
<i>You trying to</i>
<i>throw me off balance?</i>

219
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,112
<i>No, not really.</i>
<i>I just didn't wanna</i>
<i>tell you where I live.</i>

220
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,347
Why is that?

221
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,356
Because it's not
Ambassador Heights.

222
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,392
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,257
<i>You think I'm so shallow</i>
<i>that I would judge you</i>
<i>by where you live?</i>

224
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,856
We can talk about
my class inferiority
complex later.

225
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,570
Wouldn't you prefer
to discuss my
favorite shade?

226
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,405
I asked around.

227
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,678
I heard all about you
and your little
lipstick fetish.

228
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,719
You wanna add me
to your collection.

229
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,220
Oh, come on.

230
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,315
Those other ones
were like

231
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,257
homework assignments.

232
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,488
And I'm like
the final exam?

233
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,224
<i>Yeah. And that's</i>
<i>a good thing</i>

234
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,993
'cause I always
ace my finals.

235
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,728
So what exactly
do I get if you
"ace" me?

236
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,930
Some unbelievable
pictures of yourself?

237
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,203
Yeah, but those
are for you.

238
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,574
<i>I guess I'm just</i>
<i>cashed out then, huh?</i>

239
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,639
Maybe not.

240
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,523
<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>She learned the cello</i>
<i>taking night classes</i>

241
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,758
<i>at Rutherford</i>
<i>M usic School.</i>

242
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,731
<i>Her mom's idea.</i>

243
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,100
<i>Thought it would add</i>
<i>a little refinement</i>

244
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,639
<i>to an otherwise</i>
<i>shaky upbringing.</i>

245
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,376
<i>She told me her mom</i>
<i>died a few years back.</i>

246
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,080
<i>Now she lived</i>
<i>with her sister,</i>

247
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,242
<i>who wasn't around</i>
<i>very much.</i>

248
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,047
How's this?

249
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,316
I'll let you shoot a
roll of pictures of me

250
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,620
if you take some
pictures for me first.

251
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,285
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,660
I'm kind of slow
on the uptake here.
Can you...

253
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,289
Can you translate
that for me?

254
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,993
I'm in a bit
of a situation.

255
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,592
A situation?

256
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,261
Relationship.

257
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,363
<i>Somebody at school?</i>

258
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,600
It's complicated.

259
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,663
How so?

260
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,074
He is... older.

261
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,202
<i>Married.</i>

262
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,338
No, not married.
Not anymore.

263
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,850
But let's just say in his
position he shouldn't be
hooking up with me.

264
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,715
And what position
is that?

265
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,152
That would be in fact
that I'm still in
high school.

266
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,520
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>I'm listening.</i>

267
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,095
I'm not exactly sure
where things are
going right now,

268
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,221
<i>but it seems</i>
<i>to be getting</i>
<i>out of control.</i>

269
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,199
<i>How does my camera</i>
<i>fit in to all this?</i>

270
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,859
I'd like you
to follow us.

271
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,097
<i>Capture a few moments,</i>
<i>if you know</i>
<i>what I mean.</i>

272
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,934
<i>J ust in case</i>
<i>something happens.</i>

273
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,634
My advice,
you should
call a cop.

274
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,438
He made me a promise
and I need to make sure
that he keeps it.

275
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,479
<i>So I take pictures</i>
<i>for you</i>

276
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,309
and you let me take
pictures of you?

277
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,815
Exactly.

278
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,047
I don't know
if I'm the right
person for this.

279
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,919
I've got my
own problems
at the moment.

280
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,424
Okay.
There's the door.

281
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,863
<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>It seemed like</i>
<i>a reasonable deal.</i>

282
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,300
<i>Pictures for pictures.</i>

283
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,778
<i>But the more I shot</i>

284
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,284
<i>the more intrigued</i>
<i>I was by her.</i>

285
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,190
<i>And it made me realize</i>
<i>how bored I'd been.</i>

286
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,335
<i>Every picture I took</i>
<i>peeled away</i>
<i>another layer.</i>

287
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,707
<i>And every time</i>
<i>I peeled one away,</i>

288
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,613
<i>it seemed like</i>
<i>I discovered</i>
<i>two more.</i>

289
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,080
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in a while</i>

290
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,284
<i>I felt excited</i>
<i>by a challenge.</i>

291
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,953
<i>(Shay)</i>
<i>His name's</i>
<i>Wade Chandling.</i>

292
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,190
<i>His a member</i>
<i>at Oak Valley</i>

293
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,256
<i>and a parter</i>
<i>in a law firm</i>
<i>downtown.</i>

294
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,869
We had a recital last
winter at Rutherford

295
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,567
for supporting patrons
and he was there.

296
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,700
And, um,
he came
up to me

297
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,143
and said he
remembered me
from the club.

298
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,579
And he liked
how I played.

299
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:41,051
And he promised
to help me get into
this program at Hartley.

300
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,385
A performance scholarship
awarded to four students
every year.

301
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,754
Full ride.
All expenses.

302
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,422
Do you know
what Hartley means?

303
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,694
That's one of the best
music schools
in the country.

304
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,495
It means
freedom, Jordan.

305
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:00,334
Not being trapped.
Not having my
options limited.

306
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,863
The fast lane into
any philharmonic
in the world.

307
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:09,170
And he's just going
to set you up?

308
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,682
He has some friends
on the advisory committee.

309
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,445
H uh.

310
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,011
So, this beautiful
young cellist

311
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,492
<i>who, uh, basically</i>
<i>lives on her own,</i>

312
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,425
<i>he takes this</i>
<i>young artist</i>
<i>under his wing.</i>

313
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,622
It wasn't like that.

314
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,528
<i>It just slowly</i>
<i>developed into more.</i>

315
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,760
<i>And how many</i>
<i>other musicians</i>
<i>is he helping?</i>

316
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,062
<i>Any overweight</i>
<i>tuba players</i>

317
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,073
with club feet
and bad cases
of acne?

318
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,974
You don't do jealous well.
Has anyone ever
told you that?

319
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,705
It feels
very natural.

320
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,509
I'm glad you think
you know everything.

321
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,415
Sorry. You're the one
who's having me
take the pictures.

322
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,453
Clearly you're
having doubts.

323
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,317
Can I see
the pictures?

324
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,023
Thanks.

325
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,296
Good.

326
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,702
Okay. So, your place
after school?

327
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,604
Better make it yours.

328
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,406
<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>It's been said</i>

of the land?

You got that right.

491
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,758
The question is,

492
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,568
are you gonna speak
the language of the land

493
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,435
or are you going
to have it spoken
to you?

494
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,701

495
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:02,206

your sex.

Don't need to make it
complicated, Jordan.

I mean, he's the kind
of guy that just drives
through red lights

504
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,620
to let the world

fuck with them.

505

catch monkeys in
southeast Asia?

506

With a basket.

509
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,141
They cut a little
hole in the basket

510
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,114
that's just big enough
for the monkey to put
his hand into.

511
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,912
Then they put
fruit in it.

512
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,546
So, when the monkey
puts his hand in and
he grabs the fruit,

513
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,352
his closed fist is
too big to fit back
through the hole.

514
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,794
So, instead of just
letting the fruit go
and running free,

515
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,456
he just waits until
the trappers come.

00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,654
No, I thought
you might know
where she is.

667
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,635
Gordie, right?

668
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,033
Gordon?

669
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:21,934
Jordan.

670
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:25,133
What do you want
with her anyway?

671
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,767
Nothing.

672
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,711
We were just...
We were gonna
meet up later.

673
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:34,915
<i>[Calling by cell phone]</i>

674
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,748
<i>Hey, this is Shay.</i>

675
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,586
<i>Leave me a message</i>
<i>after the beep and</i>
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

676
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,625
Shay, it's Jordan.
I know I keep calling.

677
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,786
I'm just trying
to track you down.

678
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,887
I'm on my cell.
If you can call me.

679
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,895
<i>(Desiree)</i>
<i>So the, uh,</i>

680
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,941
donations that we got
for the action are
several paintings

681
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:01,876
and drawings from
Elliot Damien, Gary
Fine, Robert Walker.

682
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:06,279
<i>And they're all estimated</i>
<i>over a quarter of</i>
<i>a million dollars.</i>

683
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,079
<i>We got very lucky I</i>

684
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,193
Jordan.

685
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:18,387
Put the phone away.

686
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,329
What's up?

687
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,627
What do you mean?

688
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,668
You didn't say
two words in there.

689
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,569
There was not much
to say. Desiree's
got a handle on it.

690
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,472
Who's co-charing this
with me, you or her?

691
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,841
Besides, last I heard
Desiree's already been
accepted to Yale for the fall.

692
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:41,545
I swear, Jordan, sometimes
I just wanna shake you out
of your complacency.

693
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:47,119
You do your homework
before the next meeting.

694
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,658
If you sit there
with your thumb
up your ass again,

695
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:53,924
I'm gonna break it off
and leave it there
permanently.

696
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:55,157
Put the phone away.

697
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:19,017
Remember me?
Detective Griffin?

698
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:22,058
We met when you had
that little problem
at Xavier.

699
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,059
Yeah.

700
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,424
D'you take these?

701
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:27,821
Yes.

702
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,297
<i>Not bad.</i>

703
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,233
<i>You're a regular</i>
<i>Andy Warhol, huh?</i>

704
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,600
No, not really.

705
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:38,129
He was more
of a painter.

706
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,267
You know, you're just
the guy I wanna see.

707
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,074
I'm thinking
about getting
a digital camera.

708
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:47,242
Any suggestions?
All that mega
pixel stuff

709
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,444
makes my head spin.

710
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,084
How much you
looking to spend?

711
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,284
Not a lot.

712
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:00,185
Well, I'll give it
some thought.

713
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,892
I understand you're
a friend of Shay
Bettencourt's.

714
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:06,401
Yeah, that's right.

715
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,869
Any idea
where she is?

716
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,667
She's been out
the last few days.

717
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,207
You know, I think
she's sick.

718
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,707
I don't think so.

719
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:15,006
<i>I checked her place.</i>
<i>She's not there.</i>

720
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:18,138
<i>You and Shay</i>
<i>pretty tight?</i>

721
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,944
We hang out, yeah.

722
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,042
Does she like having
her picture taken?

723
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,756
What's this about?

724
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,054
<i>How much did</i>
<i>you really know</i>
<i>about her?</i>

725
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:32,987
What do you mean?

726
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,623
You know about
her mom, right?

727
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,792
Yeah.
That she's dead.

728
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,666
Who told you that?

729
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,728
Shay mentioned it.

730
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,899
Well. No!

731
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,738
Her mom's alive
and well,

732
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:51,247
and living in the Attica
State Correctional
Facility for Women.

733
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:56,209
How is that?

734
00:50:56,286 --> 00:51:00,586
She carved up Shay's step
dad with a steak knife a
couple of years back.

735
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:06,323
I think we're talking
about two totally
different people here.

736
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,729
Don't think so.
How long has she been
seeing Wade Chandling?

737
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,961
You know who
he is, right?

738
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,161
Never mentioned him.

739
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,798
I guess dating a guy
that's old enough
to be your dad,

740
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,206
that's not something
you wanna advertise.

741
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,608
How do you know this?

742
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:24,010
<i>Well, Wade</i>
<i>Chandling is a...</i>

743
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,242
was a member
of the Oak Valley
Country Club.

744
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,011
Same place
Shay works.

745
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,282
Some of the members had
a problem with their cars
being vandalized

746
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,721
in the past few months,
so they put a video camera
in the parking lot

747
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,622
to keep an eye
on things.

748
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,558
We got a look
at the tapes.

749
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:44,089
Lots of video of Shay
climbing into Chandling's
car after hours.

750
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:50,265
Yeah. That's a real
head-scratcher,
isn't it?

751
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,604
If you see Shay,

752
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,076
it's important
she contact me.

753
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,014
Take care, Warhol.

754
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,885
<i>(attorney)</i>
<i>My office is getting up</i>
<i>to speed on this case.</i>

755
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,390
<i>I've spoken to Chief Malley</i>
<i>several timer over</i>
<i>the past few hours</i>

756
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,426
and made it very clear
to him that he has
our full support.

757
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,792
I n an investigation
of this type...

758
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,330
This is Desiree.

759
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,797
<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>D, it's me.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

760
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:20,496
Watching my dad feed the
media a few sound bites.
What's up?

761
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,094
I need to see you.

762
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,835
Jordan Wells
asking me for a favor.
What are the odds?

763
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,206
Can you meet me
in an hour?

764
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,835
Are you gonna
stand me up again?

765
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,437
D, come on.

766
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,176
Yeah, okay.
Where?

767
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,502
Hey.

768
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,835
With soy milk?

769
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,068
Yeah.

770
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:03,010
H m. You must
be desperate.
Thanks.

771
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:08,481
I want to talk to you
about the other night.

772
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:14,146
And you've just gotta
trust me when I tell
you that it's okay.

773
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,692
And that I'm sorry.

774
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,055
Okay.

775
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:24,692
I wanted to get together and
thank you for everything you've
been doing for the foundation.

776
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,127
You're saving
my ass.

777
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:30,865
Right.

778
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,738
How's everything
going with you?

779
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,300
How's everything going
in your dad's office?

780
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,777
Everything's fine.

781
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,939
You guys must be on
this Chandling thing.

782
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:43,247
Not officially,
but you know, they're
moving kind of fast.

783
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,878
Do you have
any suspects?

784
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:52,156
I'm an intern, Jordan.
They don't really
tell me anything.

785
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,754
That's never
really stopped
you before, though.

786
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,290
True.

787
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:00,394
Okay. So off
the record,

788
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,906
it looks like they haven't
been able to pull that
much from the scene.

789
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,737
What do you mean?

790
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,903
<i>It means whoever did it,</i>
<i>covered the tracks</i>
<i>pretty well.</i>

791
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:12,039
They are hoping to catch
a break when the find
Chandling's car.

792
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:16,643
What about this whole audit
thing that everybody's
been talking about?

793
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,278
What about it?

794
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,949
If he was shuffling
around money for
some of his clients,

795
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,548
things could have
gone bad.

796
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,094
Yeah. Okay.

797
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,628
Okay, what's the deal?

798
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:30,154
You trade in your camera
for a pen and paper?

799
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:33,532
Does the Edgerton Bugle
have the whole staff
working on the story?

800
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,436
I'm interested
in what you do.
I'm trying to keep up.

801
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,977
Okay.
I'm gonna go.

802
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,709
<i>I don't really feel</i>
<i>like hanging out</i>
<i>with a stranger.</i>

803
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,775
<i>Especially when it's</i>
<i>a stranger I've known</i>
<i>my whole life.</i>

804
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,613
Thanks for the <i>chai.</i>

805
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,197
<i>[Door closes]</i>

806
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,173
<i>What are you</i>
<i>doing here?</i>

807
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,434
I freaked out.

808
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,571
We talked about not
doing anything out
of the ordinary.

809
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,411
Do you remember that?

810
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,280
I'm just really
confused right now.

811
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:25,884
Where have
you been?

812
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:28,981
I went to the abandoned
house on the bluffs.

813
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,526
<i>H uh.</i>

814
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:33,460
I had to sort some
things out in my
head, you know.

815
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,795
I got a visit from
the Police today.

816
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,826
They know about Wade
and me, don't they?

817
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:44,203
<i>Yeah. They have security</i>
<i>cameras installed</i>
<i>in the parking lot</i>

818
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:46,640
at the country club.

819
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,439
So yeah,
they do.

820
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,475
Why didn't you tell me
about your mother?

821
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:56,883
My mother?

822
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,477
You know
what I mean.

823
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,381
Because I was
afraid, Jordan.

824
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,892
You made it out
like she was dead.

825
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,428
As far as
I'm concerned,
she is dead.

826
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,296
You didn't have
to hide it from me.

827
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,336
<i>Not that.</i>

828
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:19,442
<i>You have to go</i>
<i>in there and you</i>
<i>have to talk to them.</i>

829
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,670
What if they put
everything together?

830
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,543
<i>I just talked to my</i>
<i>friend who interns</i>
<i>in the D A 's office.</i>

831
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,548
They don't know
anything.

832
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:29,710
<i>What if they find</i>
<i>his car and find my</i>
<i>fingerprints inside?</i>

833
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:35,747
<i>They know you were in the car.</i>
<i>They don't know you were</i>
<i>in the car that night.</i>

<i>If you keep</i>

<i>hang out there,</i>

835
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,624
<i>they're gonna get</i>
<i>really suspicious</i>
<i>about you.</i>

836
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:45,065
And then they
could become really
suspicious about me.

837
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,706
What do I tell them?

838
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:57,145
<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>This is amazing.</i>
<i>Amazing.</i>

839
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,840
I mean, in my
wildest dreams

840
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,816
when I first decided
to enter into this
with my father,

841
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,376
I did not think that
we'd get this
much support.

842
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,890
<i>So many of you</i>
<i>tonight have been</i>
<i>given so much.</i>

843
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:11,154

<i>you haven't worked</i>
<i>for what you have,</i>

844
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,787
<i>but there is some money</i>
<i>in here that is so old</i>

845
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:17,492
<i>I don't think there's</i>
<i>a carbon-dating test</i>
<i>to trace its origins.</i>

<i>[Muffled laughter]</i>

847
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,592
What we've all
been giving.

848
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,434
<i>What is worth more</i>
<i>than money, though,</i>

<i>respect for education,</i>

851
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:32,270
and belief in our
hopes and dreams.

852
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:40,185
<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Shay walked into the</i>
<i>Edgerton Police Department</i>

853
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,952
<i>and lied her way</i>
<i>out of it.</i>

854
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:49,663
<i>Later that day I put</i>

855
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:53,395

<i>to a shining crusader</i>

There we go.
Hey, awesome job.

862
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,820
Awesome job.

863
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,721
Thanks.

864
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,297
Hey.

865
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,836
You got a good
night tonight.

866
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:34,775
Probably made
enough to keep MoKA
running for years.

867
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,472
That should definitely
turn a few heads
at Cornell.

868
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:40,448
You sure know how
to throw a great
party, D.

869
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,814
What do you
want me to say?

870
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,080
I do.

871
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:45,780
It's in my blood.

872
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:49,683
The question
is, though,

873
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,522
is it in yours?

874
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,152
What does that mean?

875
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:59,292
They found Chandling's
car today.

876
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,428
It was parked
on the roof of
a city garage.

877
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:03,597
They're sure that
he didn't leave it there

878
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,302
because they found some
muddy footprints
in a size ten.

879
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,743
He's a 12.

880
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,076
The mud matches
the samples

881
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:15,015
that they took
from the woods
near the glen.

882
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:18,645
They also found
a few partial latents

883
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:23,317
that, uh, someone
didn't do a very
good job wiping off.

884
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:32,558
The Police got a tip
today, Jordan, that
a blue Audi

885
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,230
was parked at the glen
for a few hours the night
Chandling went missing.

886
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:39,673
Right about the same time
you and I were supposed
to get together.

887
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,974
You know the girl
they interviewed
today, right?

888
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,321
Yeah.

889
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,990
Jesus, Jordan!

890
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:59,358
That's what the
Chai Latte was all
about yesterday, huh?

891
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,420
Oh, come on, don't!

892
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:02,896
Don't you dare.

893
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,264
I saw you that night.
I saw the mud
all over you,

894
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:08,031
and I hoped to God
I was the only one.

895
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,505
You know something.
Let's go to my dad
right now!

896
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:17,576
I know that
she was involved
with Wade Chandling.

897
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,548
But that's...

898
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,677
That's really just
all I now, D.

899
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,769
<i>They cleared me.</i>
<i>I'm free.</i>

900
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:45,529
[Cell phone rings]

901
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,433
Hello?

01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,939
<i>(Detective Griffin)</i>
<i>Hey, Warhol.</i>

903
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,873
Griffin.

<i>We gotta talk</i>
<i>you and me.</i>

905
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,574
I'm kind of in a little
something right now.

906
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:03,517
<i>I suggest you drop it</i>
<i>and meet me at the ball</i>
<i>field in 20 minutes.</i>

907
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,302
This was
my school, too.

908
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:31,836
You might not believe it
but I was kind of a
nobody back then.

909
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,576
During football games
I'd sit on the hill
over there

910
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,512
<i>by myself.</i>

911
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:42,320

<i>it was being lived</i>
<i>without me.</i>

01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:03,004
I'll write you
an excuse.

921

Your girl's off the hook,
did she tell you?

922
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,584
Yeah.

923
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:22,028
And, um,

924
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,760
look what landed
in my lap this morning.

925
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,364
You already know
what's in there.

926
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,235
<i>But open it</i>
<i>anyway.</i>

927
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,434
<i>I wanna see</i>
<i>your reaction.</i>

928
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:44,947
<i>Now, there's two ways</i>
<i>we can play this.</i>

929
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:49,958
One, I take those pictures
to a judge and get
a subpoena

930
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,290
<i>to check your shoe size</i>
<i>and fingerprints.</i>

931
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,622
Your previous history
with photography

932
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,064
should make that
almost a lock.

933
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,960
Or two,

934
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,733
you help me conduct
a little experiment

935
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:06,070
that just might
save your ass.

936
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,906
<i>I've never seen those</i>
<i>pictures before</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

937
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:12,243
<i>Right. And your A4</i>
<i>wasn't at the glen</i>
<i>the other night.</i>

938
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,408
I've got you, Warhol.

939
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:20,421
And the thing is,
I'm pretty sure it
wasn't your idea.

940
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:23,151
It was all hers.

941
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,892
You know anything
about meta-data files?

942
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:41,766
It's the most amazing
concept in digital
photography.

943
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,074
You store a file

944
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:46,273
with a photo
on a disk.

945
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:49,648
All sorts of juicy stuff
gets encoded in there.

946
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,949
Date, time,

947
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,081
what kind of camera,
serial number.

948
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,193
It's like a digital
fingerprint.

949
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,423
It's the nail
in your coffin

950
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:04,864
if somebody decides
to crosscheck
those files

951
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,562
against the number
on your camera.

952
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:16,710
A scholarship.

953
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,942
He was gonna help her
get a scholarship.

954
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,506
A scholarship?

955
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,279
To Hartley.

956
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:28,582
Oh, man.
That's beautiful.

957
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:31,684
All for the
advancement
of art, eh?

958
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:35,595
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>that was it, Warhol.</i>

959
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,360
It's just a theory
I'm working on.

960
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,458
I don't have it
all put together, yet.

961
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,662
But it involves
Chandling

962
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,602
and a whole
pile of money

963
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,665
I think your girl
was trying to get
her hands on.

964
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:50,576
And I am not talking
tuition money.

965
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:55,806
I'm talking about
something in excess
of one million bucks.

966
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:59,677
Come on.

967
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:02,622
See, I think Shay
made you think

968
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:05,490
that it was about
the music.

969
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:09,429
But really Chandling
was sitting on
something big.

970
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,261
And she knew it.

971
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,199
So she tried
to squeeze him

972
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:15,635
to get him to pay her
to keep her mouth shut.

973
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,969
Things went bad.

974
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,634
And then you came along
and helped clean up
the mess.

975
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,803
It was supposed to be
about a scholarship.

976
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:24,436
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>it's only a theory.</i>

977
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:29,080
But we can test it.

978
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:33,521
I'm thinking, once
I run your prints,

979
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:36,149
they're gonna do
a whole lot of talking.

980
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:40,286
Maybe not enough to put
one of Ben Wells'
kids in Attica

981
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,627
for the rest
of his days,

982
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,861
but you think for
one second that your
life's gonna be the same?

983
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:50,429
<i>Which brings us back</i>
<i>to our little experiment.</i>

984
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,440
I want $1 million.

985
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,497
What?

986
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,476
One million.

987
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:58,670
I don't have that.

988
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:01,342
But she does.

989
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,817
And maybe you
already know
that, Warhol.

990
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,251
Here's my number.

991
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:16,162
I wanna hear from you
by the end of the day.

992
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,800
<i>Now, get the fuck</i>
<i>out of here.</i>

993
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,522
Jordan?

994
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,562
What happened
to my house?

995
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:56,400
You went back
for the keys, Shay.

996
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,233
<i>Why would</i>
<i>you say that?</i>

997
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:06,680
I met with that cop
Griffin earlier today.

998
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,013
What did he tell you?

999
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:14,051
That he found the box
in Wade's bedroom.

1000
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:15,784
<i>Empty.</i>

1001

I'm telling you
the truth, Jordan.

What do you want me
to do to prove that
to you?

Where's the

1007
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:43,443

We can either
get out of here
as fast as we can,

And we're not killers.

couldn't touch us.

01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:18,763
There better
not be.

1168
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,325
D, I, uh...

1169
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:48,161
I don't know
what to say.

1170
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:52,132
You know
what, Jordan?

1171
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:55,404
Neither do I.

1172
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:07,615
I just bought you
two days, maybe three.

1173
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:09,156
But this isn't
over, Jordan.

1174
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:25,666
<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>It was the final gift</i>
<i>she would ever give me.</i>

1175
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:32,002
<i>Her last favor.</i>

1176
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:39,776
<i>It's strange to think</i>
<i>of your future in</i>
<i>terms of days.</i>

1177
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:48,962
<i>But it wasn't going to</i>
<i>take those detectives</i>
<i>any longer than that.</i>

1178
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:55,502
<i>Money was her</i>
<i>only way out.</i>

1179
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:57,470
<i>And now it became mine.</i>

1180
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:04,277
<i>And that's why I</i>
<i>transferred most of</i>
<i>the money to another bag</i>

1181
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:06,405
<i>before meeting Griffin.</i>

1182
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:11,783
<i>The money was</i>
<i>the only leverage</i>
<i>I had left.</i>

1183
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:15,789
<i>There's always a moment.</i>

1184
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:17,347
<i>Sometimes more</i>
<i>than one.</i>

1185
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,362
<i>When you can walk away.</i>

1186
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:30,161
<i>Choose not to play a role</i>
<i>someone else may be</i>
<i>writing for you.</i>

1187
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,800
<i>Reality finally</i>
<i>kicked in.</i>

1188
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,245
<i>For my life,</i>

1189
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:47,553
<i>it was time I started</i>
<i>writing my own script.</i>

1190
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:04,100
<i>My name's Jordan Wells.</i>

1191
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:07,869
<i>A marketer's report</i>
<i>on me would read</i>
<i>something like this.</i>

1192
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,409
<i>Rich, privileged,</i>

1193
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:16,512
<i>future doctor,</i>

1194
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:19,810
<i>future lawyer,</i>

1195
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,753
<i>future somebody.</i>

1196
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:25,486
<i>But you wouldn't expect</i>
<i>an accessory to murder.</i>

1197
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:28,854
<i>Twice.</i>

1198
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:32,127
<i>With a million dollars</i>
<i>to decide what</i>
<i>to do next.</i>

1199
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:12,304
<i># She dances for you #</i>

1200
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:15,570
<i># I n the fading</i>
<i>Sun light #</i>

1201
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:18,373
<i># We're loosing</i>
<i>This battle #</i>

1202
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:20,914
<i># From the start #</i>

1203
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:25,075
<i># It's fatal within #</i>

1204
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:28,418
<i># If she knows</i>
<i>How to use it #</i>

1205
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:33,393
<i># She could tear</i>
<i>Your life apart #</i>

1206
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:36,521
<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

1207
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:43,034

<i># Some one you</i>

1211
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:06,754
<i># To walk away #</i>

1212
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:10,525
<i># If only you</i>
<i>Could clear</i>
<i>Your twisted vision #</i>

1213
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:13,158
<i># To see through victory #</i>

1214
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:15,896

1216
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:25,038

01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:27,946
