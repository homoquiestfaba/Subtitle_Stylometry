1
00:00:17,287 --> 00:00:18,083
Welcome.

2
00:00:18,247 --> 00:00:19,805
And thank you for
choosing to view

3
00:00:22,927 --> 00:00:24,519
We here at Forefront Films

4
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:26,359
and Sneak Preview Entertainment

5
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,755
understand that some

6
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,121
of you may have never seen
homosexuals

7
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:32,916
engaged in any sort
of positive physical contact.

8
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:34,606
So we would like
to take a moment,

9
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,997
before we start,
to acclimate you.

10
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:39,997
This is a lipstick-lesbian,

11
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:42,237
so called because
of her feminine beauty,

12
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:44,159
her rose-colored lip cosmetics,

13
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:46,841
and her homosexual predilection.

14
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:49,796
And this is another
lipstick lesbian.

15
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:52,397
You see?

16
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,523
Nothing to be frightened of.

17
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,723
In fact, many heterosexual men

18
00:00:56,887 --> 00:01:00,880
consider such images beautiful
and/or sexually arousing.

19
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,356
Now, les move onto men.

20
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:05,040
This is a gay man,

21
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:08,961
or what some in the community
might designate as a "gym queen,"

22
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:12,278
so called because of his time
spent at the local gymnasium

23
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,325
perfecting his musculature.

24
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:17,523
And here is another
homosexual man.

25
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:21,564
You see, just like two buddies
after a ball game.

26
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:24,355
Again,
nothing to be afraid of.

27
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,282
Thus ends our introduction.

28
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:32,356
We hope this has been informative
as well enlightening.

29
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,280
Enjoy the show.

30
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:57,806
Okay, so I'm going down on this guy.

31
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:01,642
I like him and is a million years
since I've been with anyone and,

32
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,877
maybe is only a month
since I've had sex,

33
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:05,526
but it seems like a million years.

34
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:08,155
Anyway, is been years since
I've been with someone I liked.

35
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:12,116
Not that I know him that well,
but he reminds me of an ex.

36
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:13,879
Anyway, he's got a great body

37
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:15,685
and there's a real
physical attraction,

38
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:16,996
so at least thas a start.

39
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:20,284
To be honest, I feel like
I could really love this guy.

40
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:23,041
Okay, so I can't remember
his name right now,

41
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:25,880
butat the time I felt like
I really, really loved him.

42
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:27,197
Or could love him.

43
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,005
It was intense, thas the point.

44
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:32,797
So I had been down on him
for like all of one second,

45
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:35,003
and all of a sudden he cums...

46
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:39,003
Okay, okay, so I'm thinking,
what should I do?

47
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:40,435
Should I spit it out
on his stomach?

48
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,882
In my hand?
On a nearby towel?

49
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:43,843
Should I swallow?

50
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,759
What would Miss Manners do
in this situation?

51
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:47,686
And suddenly I remember

52
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:50,156
what my friend Tara once told me.

53
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:52,845
So I was brought up to be a good,

54
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,124
obedient Catholic girl, who always
did what was expected.

55
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:58,243
Who knew you could spit?

56
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:00,438
Until my friends told me
I was nuts.

57
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:02,723
They ask me if I'm a spitter
or a swallower,

58
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:04,286
like there's a friggin'choice.

59
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:06,438
And then they tell me that they
spit it out all the time,

60
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:08,165
and guys don't even notice.

61
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:10,602
So, never do anythin'
you don't want to,

62
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:12,723
even if it seems rude
at the time.

63
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:14,684
Because all men, basically,
are dogs.

64
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:17,566
Some are poodles, some Dobermans,
but you're all dogs.

65
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,803
So that got me to thinkin',
what do straight guys do?

66
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:23,564
I asked Tara's man if straight guys
swallow when they go down on women,

67
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,687
and if the women notice one way
or the other.

68
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:28,846
But he was just vague.

69
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:30,483
I don't know.

70
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:32,877
Usually, they're just so stoked
that is happening,

71
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,639
they don't really want to ask
any questions.

72
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:36,559
So then I decided ask
my friend Megan

73
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:38,718
about lesbians but she was no help.

74
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:42,436
No, Vincey, we don't swallow.
We spit it out into Mason jars

75
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,917
and then examine it at our weekly
Womyn's Encounter Sessions.

76
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:50,563
Okay, so some people don't like
talking about this stuff.

77
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:53,003
But I think is important,

78
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,282
'cause to tell you the truth,
I don't mind swallowing.

79
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:55,766
It makes me feel closer to the guy.

80
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:57,519
Lsjust all this HIVstuff.

81
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:00,360
And I did want to prove my love
to whas his name here.

82
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:03,240
And then I started thinking about
this guy Ned and decided it was

83
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:04,362
all his fault.

84
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:07,200
One night I spent eight hours,

85
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,278
count 'em, 8 hours! Tryin'
to make this guy cum.

86
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:12,516
After the first hour,
it is no longer any fun.

87
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:13,961
After the second hour,
it becomes a thing of pride.

88
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:15,685
After that, is like being stuck

89
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:19,556
at an Andrew Lloyd Webber show.
You're prayin'for it to be over.

90
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:20,637
All of a sudden I just said,

91
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,160
Fuck it.
I'mjust gonna swallow.

92
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,478
This'll prove to Speedy here
that I love him

93
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:26,638
and then we'll move in together,
get a dog,

94
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,518
pick china patterns,
get Lakers season tickets

95
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,643
and live happily ever after.

96
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:34,277
So I swallowed.

97
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:37,439
And at that moment I felt love.

98
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:38,517
I really did...

99
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,238
For about twenty seconds,
it felt really great.

100
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:45,560
- And then this guy says,
- 'You really shouldn't have.

101
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:47,797
Ls really not considered safe."

102
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:52,282
"Nothing's a hundred percent
safe you fucking idiot!"

103
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,127
Thas what I wanted to scream.
Instead, I just smiled.

104
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:58,563
Thank you Dr. Jocelyn Elders
for that safe sex tidbit.

105
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:00,995
And then he says to me

106
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,557
he can't stay, but he had
a good time so he hopes I call.

107
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:06,877
Then he makes a big deal about
giving me his pager number,

108
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,482
and les get together again.

109
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,757
So then I rush into my bathroom

110
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,566
and I gargle furiously

111
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:20,321
with extra-strength
disinfectant mouthwash.

112
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,764
I even swallow.

113
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,517
Why do I always swallow?

114
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,322
And now I'm gonna die.

115
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,126
Would you stop being such
a drama queen about this?

116
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,758
"Hy? I never get to be
the drama queen.

117
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:38,122
Vincey, get this
through your thick skull.

118
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:39,925
Javi's the drama queen,

119
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:41,839
I'm the drama queen mother,

120
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,998
and you're just
a little princess.

121
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm gonna die and I never
had any of my plays produced.

122
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:50,756
- You did too!
- I mean in New York.

123
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:53,322
"Naked Busboys,"
last summer?

124
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:55,119
Poughkeepsie doesn't count.

125
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,158
Well, so you're not dead yet.

126
00:05:57,327 --> 00:06:00,000
Why don't you stop whinin'
and start writin'.

127
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:04,882
Well, at least I know now
that I am definitely over men.

128
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:07,561
This has finally made me see
that I'mjust the type of person

129
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,480
who doesn't mate for life:
A lone wolf,

130
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:12,717
a free bird, a Kennedy.

131
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:16,203
So I'm giving up
the illusion right now.

132
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:18,763
I am not going to waste
any more of my time

133
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:21,441
searching in vain for someone
to share my life with.

134
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,122
Sleeping around is dangerous.

135
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:27,006
Being in a relationship
is impossible. Men are scum.

136
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,237
And I want nothing more
to do with them.

137
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:32,807
Tara, guess what.
I just met the cutest guy.

138
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:34,515
So here's what happened.

139
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,439
- We started talking...
- Right.

140
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:38,325
One thing led to another...

141
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:41,482
- and we're having dinner Friday.
- Wait a minute.

142
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:44,844
- Friday night?
- Gym-boy's coming Friday night?

143
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:46,965
"Hat, are you nuts?
"E're going to Marix.

144
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:49,163
- Marix?
- Yeah. Javi suggested it.

145
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,602
No, Vincey!
"Hat about dinner with us?

146
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,442
- You said it was no big deal.
- No no.

147
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,997
Ls no big deal if you come.

148
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,476
If you don't come,
is a huge deal.

149
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:00,523
Why?

150
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:01,722
"Ell...

151
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:03,682
Because...

152
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,482
Robin and Sarina
are gonna be there.

153
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,080
And you know how lesbians

154
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:10,761
make Gus nervous.
Ever since he saw

155
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,360
"Basic Instinct"...

156
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:14,442
and that was years ago.

157
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:16,645
Okay, so, whas going on?

158
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:18,603
Nothin'.

159
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,440
Oh, really?

160
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,086
I'm not supposed to tell you.

161
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:26,126
But you're going to, right?

162
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,243
Okay, but you have to swear
not to tell anybody.

163
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,240
- You're a tough nut to crack.
- Vincey, you have to swear.

164
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:33,637
Just swear, Vincey,
or forget it.

165
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:35,798
I swear. There, you happy?

166
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:39,202
Okay...

167
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:44,964
Javi just found out
he's HIV positive.

168
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:46,597
What?

169
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:48,043
Yeah.

170
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:50,277
My God, I was just talkin' to him.

171
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:53,678
- What are his T-cells?
- Don't make a big deal about this.

172
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:55,883
Has he started the cocktail yet?

173
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,641
He's fine, okay?
End of discussion.

174
00:07:58,847 --> 00:07:59,962
Man.

175
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:03,563
Just let Javi tell you the way
he wants to, okay?

176
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:05,638
Just be there Friday night.

177
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:08,321
Because ill be
depressing for him

178
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,126
to be around his brother who's
in a good relationship with me,

179
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:14,324
and Dwight and Diego,
and Robin and Sarina and,

180
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:16,557
you know even Megan and Jared...

181
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,399
You have to be there to remind him

182
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:21,957
there are other Ionely,
desperate gays still around.

183
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:25,079
Well, as long
as you put it that way.

184
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:27,877
Vincey, you know
what I'm talking about.

185
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:31,239
You have a lot going for you,
but you're not in a relationship.

186
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:34,082
Yeah, well, thas all gonna
change real soon.

187
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,163
Oh, really, Vincey. Do tell.

188
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:38,203
What?

189
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:42,846
I don't want to discourage you
from gettin' involved,

190
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,043
but les be realistic.

191
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:47,959
You're a Christmas Eve type person,

192
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:51,279
you can never enjoy the presents
after they're open.

193
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,996
As soon as you find there's
a living, breathing person

194
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,635
behind the image,
you lose interest.

195
00:08:57,807 --> 00:09:01,561
Ls not my fault all the guys
I date turn out to be psychopaths.

196
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,679
- Well, is certainly not mine.
- You know what it is?

197
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:07,486
Ls this sick culture
we're living in.

198
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:09,798
Gay men are brought up
to be liars.

199
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,082
Vincey,

200
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:15,320
don't start on one of your theories
'cause I'm not buyin' it.

201
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:18,763
The point is that this guy,
Buzz, seems at least

202
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:20,042
not to be a bullshitter.

203
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,477
Vincey, baby,
I've got a newsflash for you:

204
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:25,241
All men are bullshitters,
gay or straight.

205
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:26,886
All men?

206
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,556
You got a dick, you're a liar.
Ls a simple rule.

207
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:31,365
Oh, wait, not that one.

208
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:33,643
No, is fucking ugly.
Get rid of it.

209
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:34,876
I like it. Put it back.

210
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,403
Some poor, sick, homeless,
gay man

211
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,920
needs this a lot more than you.

212
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:41,480
Selfish.

213
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:45,920
- What time's dinner?
- Wait a minute!

214
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,726
You told Javi you had a date,
so you can't come.

215
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,447
- I said I'd be by for dessert.
- All right,

216
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:54,439
then, thas what you gotta do.

217
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:57,121
- Tara it doesn't...
- No, or he'll know I told you.

218
00:09:57,287 --> 00:10:00,165
Stop being such a fag-hag
about this. I want to be there.

219
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:04,317
You stop being a fag,
I'll stop being a fag-hag.

220
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,879
Dessert. Friday night.

221
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:09,959
My house.
Ten o'clock. Period.

222
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:14,486
He knows it pisses me off
when he calls me that.

223
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,365
Fag-hag. I hate that.

224
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:19,166
But then again I had to
cut Vincey some slack,

225
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,716
'cause he'd been trapped in datin'
hell for a full year back then.

226
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,843
He was getting a little testy.

227
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,475
I don't know how two guys
ever make it work.

228
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:29,719
Ls hard enough with one penis
in a relationship, let alone two.

229
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:33,164
And then on top of that
you got all these politicians

230
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:36,000
and so-called religious rightists.

231
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:38,926
And you have those gay-bashers
on the street.

232
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:41,442
He had a lot
on his mind back then.

233
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,925
Then on top of that
you have the HIV,

234
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:47,920
AIDS, all that shit.

235
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:53,157
So if sometimes Vincey,
or any of my boys,

236
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:55,716
aren't as much fun
as they used to be, well,

237
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:57,525
who can really blame 'em?

238
00:10:57,887 --> 00:11:01,163
I see, all I have to do
is have the right attitude.

239
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,080
Concentrate hard enough,
and my virus will go away?

240
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,397
Well, it never worked
with my ex-boyfriends,

241
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:08,404
so I doubt ill work for HIV.

242
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,764
I'm not sayin' that, I'm saying
right now, you're healthy.

243
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:15,716
But I feel the disease looming
over me. I don't know where,

244
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:17,559
I don't know when,
but I know is gonna happen,

245
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:19,166
like the shark in "Jaws".

246
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:22,041
You're gonna be a barrel
of laughs tomorrow night.

247
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:25,438
Excuse me, if I'm putting
a crinkle in your social calendar.

248
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:28,196
Look,

249
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,323
Javi, I'm sorry.

250
00:11:32,847 --> 00:11:36,203
I don't pretend to know
what you're going through.

251
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:40,836
I hate the fact I can't
do anythin' to make it better.

252
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:45,236
You know I love you.

253
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,876
Why couldn't you have been
a gay man?

254
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,716
Some people suspect I am.

255
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:59,003
You know, is not getting any
easier to deal with, Tar.

256
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,923
Did I tell you?

257
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:07,155
I finally got the dirt on what
happened between Megan and Sarina.

258
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,965
Really? Do tell...

259
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,800
- Okay, but swear to tell nobody.
- I swear.

260
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:14,356
Cross your heart and
hope to... whoops.

261
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:21,197
Ljust knew something was off.

262
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,965
I could feel it in her embrace.

263
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,040
I wasn't saying anything, yet.

264
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:29,645
Because I am an African
American,

265
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:31,718
Lesbian Woman

266
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:35,485
I have strength.
I have resolve.

267
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,358
And ways of tricking two-timing
bitches into telling me the truth.

268
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:00,276
Megan?

269
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:04,481
I know you had an affair
while you were gone,

270
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:06,879
so don't deny it.

271
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,635
I want you to tell me about it,

272
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,038
and why it happened.
I promise I will not get mad.

273
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:19,880
I don't know what you're saying.

274
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:22,484
Ls very, very important for you

275
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:25,163
to tell me everything.

276
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:29,803
I...

277
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,997
Okay, how did you know?

278
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:40,640
I wasn't certain.

279
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,642
Not until you just said that.

280
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:45,918
Damn, worse than my mother.

281
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,605
Megan, please tell me.

282
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:54,955
- I'm so sorry, Sari. I swear...
- Don't swear, please.

283
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,480
Just tell me.

284
00:13:57,687 --> 00:14:00,884
Is it someone I know?
Someone from the company?

285
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,996
- I don't know what to tell you.
- Try the truth.

286
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:06,317
- Sari...
- Please,

287
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:08,281
just tell me.

288
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:13,076
Okay.

289
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:15,761
Then, yes,

290
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:18,879
is someone that you know,

291
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,438
and yes, is someone
from the company.

292
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,325
Younger or older?

293
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,606
Older.

294
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,245
Is she pretty?

295
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:36,836
Well, no.

296
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,725
But thas because...

297
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,162
well...

298
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:44,561
ls a guy.

299
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:46,762
Awhat?

300
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,164
A man?
"Ith a penis?

301
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:52,316
You want the truth?
I'm telling you.

302
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:53,843
Ls Jared.

303
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,276
Jared?

304
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:58,401
- Jared my cousin?
- Your second cousin by marriage.

305
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:00,605
You mean the same Jared
that moved in

306
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,281
with us because
he lost his job?

307
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:07,396
"Ho I got a job? Who I got
an interview at your company?

308
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:08,716
Is this the same Jared?

309
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,006
Sort of ironic, really, isn't it?

310
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:14,807
Oh my God, this has to be
some kind of sick joke.

311
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,559
He feels really bad about it.

312
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:20,160
He's gonna feel really bad,
I get my hands on him.

313
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:22,443
Come on, Sari, les face it.

314
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:24,643
The spark went out
between us long ago.

315
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,277
I can't believe you're saying this.

316
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:29,836
I can't believe you're sleeping
with my cousin.

317
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:33,565
Sarina, we haven't had good sex
since Martina won "imbledon.

318
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:37,356
The passion is gone, Sari.

319
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,601
"E're going through a dry stretch,
thas all.

320
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,486
The tide'll come back
if you just give it a chance.

321
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:45,717
Sari, there is no tide.

322
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:47,479
The lake has dried up.

323
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:49,645
That is a lesbian death bed.

324
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:52,078
Oh, no is not!

325
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,887
Because that would mean
both of us are lesbians.

326
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,005
And you, apparently,
are no lesbian!

327
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,442
I'm as much a lesbian as...

328
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:01,518
As who? As Jared?

329
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,395
So how do you feel?

330
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:04,841
Feel like a real woman now?

331
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,317
Stop it! Please!
You promised you wouldn't get mad.

332
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:12,521
And you promised you'd love
and be faithful to me!

333
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:16,036
I know.

334
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,523
And I do love you, Sarina.

335
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,757
But I don't have anything inside
for you anymore.

336
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,406
Not sexual, anyway.

337
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:26,441
- Les cut our losses now, while...
- Great idea.

338
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,443
Good idea. Move onto
the next business transaction!

339
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,438
The next deal!
The next client!

340
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:35,644
Les not be drama queens.
We're dykes, not fags.

341
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:39,320
Why keep referring to yourself
as a lesbian?

342
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:42,604
Did Jared have a sex change
and not tell anyone about it?

343
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,965
You can have Mr. Mittens.
I don't want him.

344
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:50,685
I never liked that cat.

345
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:53,879
- Now the truth comes out.
- I love that cat! He's my cat!

346
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,875
Oh, baby girl.

347
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:02,279
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:08,483
You want me to go over and beat
the crap out of her? I'll do it.

349
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:10,956
I want you to go beat
the crap out of him.

350
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:12,879
Nah, he'd probably like it
too much.

351
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,163
You know how perverted them
straight guys are.

352
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:16,403
In fact, he probably

353
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:19,480
lured her, using drugs
or something.

354
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:23,602
They always recruit people into
their sicko straight lifestyle.

355
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:27,006
You're right.
Maybe he tricked her, I...

356
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:30,118
Hello. I'm kidding.

357
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:33,917
Nobody lures Ms. Megan into
something she doesn't want to do.

358
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,319
Besides, I gotta tell you,
I always had my doubts

359
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:37,920
- about that lady.
- What?

360
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:41,286
You suspected Megan was straight
and never said anything to me?

361
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:45,042
And say "Sarina, I think your
girlfriend wishes you had a dick."?

362
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:46,401
You just never liked her.

363
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,001
Ever since she dropped out of your
stupid Friday night poker game.

364
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:49,883
No,

365
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:52,322
don't get defensive with me, girl.
I'm on your side.

366
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:55,638
Megan tipped out on you to sit on
some guy's overgrown clit.

367
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:58,043
So don't even try.

368
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,246
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:05,366
Babe I'm sorry.

370
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,876
"Ant to go rollerblading?

371
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,766
Want to go on the
new Superman ride?

372
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:17,245
Want to rent bad porno movies
and see if we recognise anyone?

373
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:17,998
Shut up!

374
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:20,243
Now, what I wanted to say was,

375
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:24,321
"Drop the bitch like a bad piece
of meat and jump in my bed!"

376
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:29,036
As you probably guessed,
I had a huge crush on Sarina

377
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,960
ever since the first moment
I looked at that pretty face.

378
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:34,085
But she was with Megan

379
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,317
and they were in love and had been
together for like a hundred years.

380
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,239
So I just kept
a little half step back.

381
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:43,085
Besides, girlie-girls like Sarina
don't go for sporty gals like me,

382
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:46,280
despite what they tell you
in the dykey-dyke press.

383
00:18:46,447 --> 00:18:48,756
Ls all scandalous lies.

384
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:52,478
So I just tried to hug her
like an older brother

385
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,804
and tried not to get my hard-on.

386
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:09,078
I feel so guilty.

387
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:11,238
I know. So do I.

388
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:15,238
Les call Sarina up and ask her
to join us in a three-way.

389
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,682
She's your cousin.

390
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:19,156
Second cousin, by marriage.

391
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:22,086
We owe her a lot. Both of us.

392
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:25,724
You don't have to sleep with her.
You were leaving her anyway,

393
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,639
so what difference does it
make who you're screwing?

394
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:32,117
Let me put it this way, if things
didn't work out between us,

395
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:34,562
would you mind if I fucked
your cute younger brother?

396
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,600
Why would I mind?
I'djust have both of you killed.

397
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,516
See if we had any other relatives
I could fuck.

398
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:42,484
People say I'm blunt and sarcastic.

399
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,717
Come on, Meg.
There's nothing you can do.

400
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:46,242
I'm sorry,

401
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:49,917
but I just can't help thinking
about her lying in bed, crying.

402
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:58,919
But I'm fertile right now.

403
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:02,238
Thas why I came home for lunch
and we did it for two hours.

404
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:04,637
But we've gotta do it
as much as possible.

405
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:06,445
These eggs aren't gettin'
any fresher.

406
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:08,837
Tara, you've got plenty
of years to have babies.

407
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:12,079
No, you've got years of sperm left.
I'm on a schedule.

408
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:16,479
Atime's-running-out-get-your-sperm
- while-the-eggs're-fresh schedule.

409
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:20,242
Tara, at this particular moment,
I'm spermless. Gun isn't loaded.

410
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,637
The well is dry.
The cupboard is bare.

411
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:25,275
- Goddammit, Gus, you're Latino!
- I'm American.

412
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:27,403
"Hat good is it being a Mexican

413
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:30,365
if I can't get the sperm
I need to make my baby?

414
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:33,002
Do I ask you for much, Gus? No!

415
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,635
Do I ask you for jewels?
Do I ask you for furs?

416
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:38,162
Do I ask you to take me out
to a fancy restaurant?

417
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:40,124
No!
Not even to Burger King!

418
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:43,160
All I ask for is your honesty
and your sperm.

419
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:45,045
I don't even ask for your love.

420
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:48,119
If I gotta ask for that,
I don't even want it.

421
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,118
But I gotta have your sperm.

422
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:53,636
Especially now if you're gonna
be running off to China,

423
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,605
or God knows where...

424
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:58,363
- It always comes to that.
- Yeah.

425
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,995
How many times will we have this
argument? 10 times? A hundred?

426
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:03,806
I say, les get 'em all right
now, and get 'em over with.

427
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:06,037
"Hat are you saying?
You want to talk?

428
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,285
No, Tara, I want to sleep.

429
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,758
But I need your sperm!

430
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:21,036
Maybe I should get it from Diego
and Dwight like I planned.

431
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:25,560
If it means me gettin' sleep,

432
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:28,605
I'll help you with the
turkey baster myself.

433
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:33,322
- Did you remember to get the...
- Milk?

434
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:35,717
They only had the 2%, not the 1%.

435
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,923
But I got some Chardonnay to bring
over to Tara's tomorrow night.

436
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,043
- Will it go with...
- The calamari?

437
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:42,641
- Yeah. She's doing it in...
- Her fresh tomato pasta?

438
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:44,963
I like the way she does that.

439
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:47,518
- She uses...
- Fresh parsley.

440
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:50,565
But I think is also the market
she gets it at on Fairfax.

441
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:52,638
Everything's so fresh there.

442
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,321
On the way home from church
Thursday, we'll get some salmon.

443
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:58,000
For Friday's barbecue?

444
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:00,800
Perfect.

445
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,964
Oh wait, I'm...

446
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,036
There.

447
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:06,442
Jesus!

448
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:08,279
Thank you, Lord!

449
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:23,799
What are you doing?

450
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:27,200
- You need as much sperm as possible.
- What? Now?

451
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,358
Company's coming
in ten fucking minutes!

452
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:31,995
- They're never on time for nothing.
- No, no, no, sweety.

453
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:35,443
I'll get all messy. I don't have
time to freshen up. Stop.

454
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:38,636
Hold on a second.

455
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:41,685
Let me get horizontal so the sperm
don't all come spillin' out.

456
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,602
Oh, goddamn!
Thas the doorbell!

457
00:24:04,807 --> 00:24:07,367
Hold your fucking horses!
We're coming!

458
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:15,119
Get off! Get off!

459
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,324
Hold on! Hold on!

460
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:18,926
Coming!

461
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:26,404
In the kitchen?

462
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:32,320
Very Jack Nicholson,
Jessica Lange of you two.

463
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:47,803
I knew this was gonna happen.

464
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,043
Hey, Sarina.

465
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,923
You did not just say, "Hi, Sarina."

466
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:57,681
He said, "Hello, Sarina.
How you doing?"

467
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,395
Hello.

468
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:05,759
You've been doing well, I hear.

469
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:12,919
- You look nice tonight, Sari.
- Oh, Megan, please.

470
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:15,879
I was saying it as a friend.

471
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,722
If we're friends, shouldn't we be
able to say friendly things?

472
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:22,036
Moi?

473
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:25,606
No. You don't want
to know what I think.

474
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:29,077
The only reason I came tonight
was because, you know why.

475
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:32,364
I want to remain friendly,
but I don't want to be friends.

476
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:34,279
So les not get carried away.

477
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:38,003
Look, I know I wasn't as honest
as I coulïve been, but...

478
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,840
Megan, please, les not turn
tonight into the Oprah show.

479
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,567
- Hey, you guys.
- Oh, they're here. Some friends!

480
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,517
Food! Food! I hear food!

481
00:25:48,687 --> 00:25:50,166
Hey, everyone!

482
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:52,682
You look great!

483
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:54,762
Looking terribly buff there.

484
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:57,316
- Have you been working out?
- Yeah, you're bulking up there.

485
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:01,199
God, you're all here at once!
What did y'all do, van-pool?

486
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:02,880
"E decided to try to be
on time for a change.

487
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:06,722
Well, come on in, girlfriends.
'Cause the first course is mud pie.

488
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:08,843
The dirt will be flung tonight.

489
00:26:10,607 --> 00:26:12,802
Tara, a gay man trapped
in a woman's body.

490
00:26:14,647 --> 00:26:16,126
I am so sorry about Marix.

491
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:18,198
I always forget how crowded
that place gets.

492
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:21,279
Not that I go there all
that much, or anything like that,

493
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,559
is just that since
I don't get out much,

494
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:28,005
- I forget people go out Fridays.
- Vincey, is okay, man.

495
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:30,239
- You think?
- Sure...

496
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,524
So, you don't go out
that much, man?

497
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:39,157
- Good-Iooking guy like you?
- I go out. Just not with men.

498
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,166
On dates.

499
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:45,126
So, is been a while since
your last serious boyfriend, huh?

500
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,197
Yeah, the last time
was in college.

501
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:52,482
That didn't count 'cause he
didn't know he was my boyfriend.

502
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:56,200
One of them, huh?

503
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:58,845
Yeah, we've all been there.

504
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:00,397
Hello, thank you.

505
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,525
How come you're still single?

506
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:06,198
Me, now, I've got a real excuse.

507
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,362
Oh, yeah?
And just what might that be?

508
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:12,521
Dead boyfriend.

509
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:15,326
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

510
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,039
Ls cool, man.

511
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:21,885
Ls been a while,
so I'm just getting back

512
00:27:22,047 --> 00:27:23,958
into this whole
dating thing again.

513
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:27,876
Yeah, well, welcome to hell.

514
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,122
- Tell me about it, man.
- You know, my friend Tara,

515
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:35,563
says she can't see how two guys
ever figure out the dating thing.

516
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:39,475
'Cause, like, with straights,
everything's much clearer.

517
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:41,524
Like with sex, did you know that

518
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:43,882
unless there's vaginal intercourse,

519
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:46,402
- is not considered real sex?
- Really?

520
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:50,355
Handjob, not sex.
Blowjob, not sex.

521
00:27:50,727 --> 00:27:52,638
If a guy goes down on a woman,

522
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:54,399
a miracle, not sex...

523
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:58,443
Now, you see, I say, if I cum
and I'm not alone in the room,

524
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,081
then is sex.

525
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,559
It all gets kind of complicated.

526
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:08,162
Yeah, and then you got AIDS
on top of everything else.

527
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:12,278
Yeah, but AIDS doesn't really exist,
so that doesn't count.

528
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:14,836
Excuse me?

529
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:17,965
AIDS doesn't really exist, man.
Come on, not really.

530
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:19,801
Ls just a construct.

531
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:24,046
Ls another way of labelling
sexuality as a disease.

532
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:33,318
Look,

533
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:36,519
I don't know why Vincey brought him
but I'll just ask him to leave.

534
00:28:36,687 --> 00:28:40,043
You don't have to reveal your HIV
status to some shmo off the street.

535
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:43,517
Screw it. I'm tired of
this whole psycho-drama anyway.

536
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:45,878
Javi?

537
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:55,767
Listen, everyone.

538
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,525
Listen, everyone.

539
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:03,076
Since there's no gracious way of
saying this, I'll just say it.

540
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:07,122
I recently found out that
I'm HIV positive.

541
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:09,483
And, well, I wanted you
to hear it from me

542
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:13,003
instead of whispers behind my back
like Bette Davis in Dark Victory.

543
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,803
Does anyone want dessert?

544
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:19,442
You already knew. Didn't you?

545
00:29:19,807 --> 00:29:22,116
We also have ice cream
if anyone would like it.

546
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,198
You told them. Didn't you?

547
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,920
How am I gonna keep something
like that private, Javi?

548
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:32,362
- You didn't tell me.
- I told you guys to act surprised.

549
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:34,480
Look, the important

550
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,320
- thing is that we're here for you.
- Lf you ever need anything...

551
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:39,159
I'm not sick yet.

552
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,523
- You didn't tell me.
- He's telling you now.

553
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,996
- You haven't told Mommy and Daddy?
- And what if I did?

554
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:45,839
They're gonna find out sooner
or later.

555
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:49,406
If I'd gotten a "respectable"
disease like cancer,

556
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:51,321
I would have told them,
wouldn't you?

557
00:29:51,487 --> 00:29:54,206
Excuse me, but AIDS isn't
a disease. Ls a syndrome.

558
00:29:56,887 --> 00:29:59,355
You know, acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

559
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,477
Javi, if we're not saying the
things we should be saying

560
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,558
is because
we don't know what to say.

561
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:06,445
No, don't feel bad for me.

562
00:30:07,127 --> 00:30:09,163
I knew this was eventually
gonna happen,

563
00:30:09,327 --> 00:30:10,726
and in a sense, I'm relieved.

564
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:12,605
I don't have to dodge
the bullets anymore.

565
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:15,880
I'm one of the walking wounded,
like Vanessa Redgrave in "Julia".

566
00:30:17,287 --> 00:30:20,438
I mean, I'm not dying.
At least not yet.

567
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:24,526
Look, we don't have to harp on
the subject all evening long.

568
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:26,200
Look, let me tell you something.

569
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:28,199
When I went for my test results,

570
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:32,645
in the lobby there was this
really gross Ozzie and Harriet,

571
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:34,923
West Hollywood type couple
that we all hate.

572
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:38,877
Like you two, but without your
charm or grace or intelligence

573
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,083
or genuine human warmth.

574
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:42,436
I smiled at them, you know,

575
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:44,399
to wish them luck,

576
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:47,366
but they looked back at me

577
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:49,518
as if just glimpsing
my way would infect them.

578
00:30:50,527 --> 00:30:52,677
And I didn't even know
I was HIVpositive yet.

579
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:55,679
I took it as a bad omen.

580
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:02,436
When they came out, of course they
turned out to be HIVnegative.

581
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:05,480
As they ran to live
an AIDS-free life together,

582
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:08,684
I thought...
Anne Rice is so right:

583
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:11,236
God does kill indiscriminately.

584
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,958
Life is so unfair.

585
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:21,001
And thas when it happened.

586
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,405
Believe it or not, they both got
hit by a Metro bus.

587
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,877
Not hard to believe if you'vee
seen the way they drive.

588
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:32,639
Those two beautiful,
HIVnegative bodies lay

589
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:34,758
bloodied and mangled
in the middle of the street.

590
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,085
And I thought, how wonderful!

591
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:40,159
Life is unfair for everyone.
And even if is not,

592
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,926
who cares?

593
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:43,920
Your time is up
when your time is up.

594
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:46,396
- HIVor no HIV.
- Exactly.

595
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:50,526
Besides, is not like HIV has
anything to do with AIDS.

596
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:56,200
Look, Javi,

597
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,245
I don't know you, but I suggest
you seriously look into

598
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:02,365
what we know about HIV
before you start taking

599
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:04,677
- any so-called medical treatments.
- Are you saying

600
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:06,839
that HIV doesn't cause AIDS?

601
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:09,999
- Have you seen conclusive evidence?
- Excuse me,

602
00:32:10,287 --> 00:32:13,279
but every medical expert,
the CDC, the NIH...

603
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:16,399
We carry around dozens of
harmless little retroviruses

604
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,365
in our system,
and HIV is no different,

605
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:21,438
not in its makeup,
not in its RNA...

606
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:24,436
Don't go there. This lunatic theory
is so old and so disproven...

607
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:27,405
Drugs, unchecked syphilis,
hepatitis.

608
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:30,998
Cancer, malnutrition, hell, AZT.

609
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,806
All these things cause the
immune system to break down.

610
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:37,277
How can you say that? People were
not this sick in the seventies.

611
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:41,158
Remember those first cases were
guys who took ten drugs a night?

612
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:44,246
- Poppers, screwed anything.
- I have a good idea, Buzz,

613
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:45,840
just blame the victims.

614
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,999
When you mess with your body,
you get sick from a thousand things.

615
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,398
But the medical community lumps
them together and calls it AIDS.

616
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:56,517
Now they're all saying you have to
have a co-agent with the HIV.

617
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:58,086
Now tell me,
thas sort of like admitting

618
00:32:58,247 --> 00:33:00,556
that HIV doesn't cause AIDS.

619
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:03,400
"Rong. It just means things
aren't so simplistic.

620
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:07,606
Look at the common cold. No cure
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

621
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:11,316
We're not sure is appropriate
to have this conversation now.

622
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:13,683
No, I disagree.
Right now is the time

623
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:15,519
you should have this conversation,
before your friend does

624
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:17,484
something stupid
like taking AZT

625
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:20,320
or one of these protease cocktails,
and winds up killing himself.

626
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:22,603
Now, wait just
one darn moment there, Buzz.

627
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:26,080
Protease inhibitors have performed
miracles in combination therapies.

628
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:27,202
Yeah,

629
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:30,200
on white, A-list homosexuals
who can afford the medication.

630
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:34,157
We know nothing about the
side effects, the long-term...

631
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:35,806
Buzz, honey,

632
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:40,763
You don't get the point so let me
state it clearly and succinctly.

633
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:42,076
Shut the fuck up!

634
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:43,680
- We're not interested!
- Tara!

635
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,200
Don't you "Tara" me.

636
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:48,757
I can't believe you bring this
wackadoodle to ruin my dinner party.

637
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:52,245
AIDS is the biggest tragedy
of the twentieth century.

638
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:53,965
Even Madonna said so.

639
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:55,003
Wait,

640
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,282
wait.

641
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:57,482
I'm sorry.

642
00:33:57,647 --> 00:34:01,276
All I'm saying is that gay men
are being used as guinea pigs.

643
00:34:01,847 --> 00:34:03,405
Both Dwight and I know
what you're saying.

644
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:07,276
Fact: HIV has not been proven
to cause AIDS.

645
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:10,564
- Only a correlation has-
- ls not fair to offer false hope.

646
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:12,399
- Javi is very vulnerable right now...
- Diego,

647
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:13,443
please.

648
00:34:13,607 --> 00:34:15,563
I am not Marlee Matlin
from "Children of a Lesser God."

649
00:34:15,727 --> 00:34:16,876
And I can speak for myself,

650
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,682
- and I want to hear this.
- You neglect to mention the

651
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:20,962
University of Pennsylvania...

652
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:23,516
study that shows how HIV
does cause its damage.

653
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:27,037
Could we maybe talk
about something else,

654
00:34:27,207 --> 00:34:28,276
please?

655
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:33,516
Hear about those two gay guys
who got the crap beat out of 'em

656
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:35,446
just five blocks from here?

657
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,207
Vincey tells me you're
an ex-artist, Buzz.

658
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:46,040
Your last name isn't "agner, is it?

659
00:34:46,207 --> 00:34:47,276
Yes.

660
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:50,007
Oh my God! You're Buzz "agner!
This man's a genius!

661
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:53,115
Just encourage him.
Maybe he'll talk more.

662
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:57,206
No, I saw one of your shows
at the Fergimont Station.

663
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,525
Why did you stop painting?

664
00:34:59,687 --> 00:35:03,396
Ls a long and not very
interesting story.

665
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:08,996
So what is this,

666
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:11,283
payback for me tellin'
you not to come for dinner?

667
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:13,802
Look, I know it sounds crazy
at first,

668
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:17,039
but we had this great,
long conversation over dinner.

669
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:18,919
Let me ask a favour of you.

670
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:21,806
The next time I go to my doctor's
office, would you come with me?

671
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:25,926
I want to find out what I can
about this and I get intimidated.

672
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:29,045
Especially when I start to bring up
alternative theories or treatments,

673
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:33,086
he turns into Nurse Ratched from
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".

674
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:36,760
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

675
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,442
You model for some paintings,
and I'll go to the doctor with you.

676
00:35:40,927 --> 00:35:42,724
But if you just listen to him,
he makes a lot of sense.

677
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:46,039
And he hasn't even gotten
into his whole adjacent theory

678
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:48,437
about how AIDS
is just like Vietnam

679
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:50,962
in the sense that some early
mistakes were made,

680
00:35:51,127 --> 00:35:55,200
but we sacrifice blood 'cause we
can't admit the young died in vain.

681
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:59,246
Just what the world needs.
Another theory freak like yourself.

682
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:07,406
- I thought you and Vincey were...
- Wait, Javi, time.

683
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:10,604
Look, I'm just asking you
to model thas all.

684
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:13,839
Besides, I think Vincey and I
know that this is not a date.

685
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,680
- Why would he bring me here?
- To ruin Tara's party?

686
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:20,040
You don't really think
I ruined her...?

687
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:22,721
Oh, man, I really get adamant
in my beliefs and...

688
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:24,525
You really care about this guy,
don't you?

689
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:28,646
And is great to be out
with somebody whose that sexy

690
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:31,003
and also has ideas about things.

691
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:33,405
He is a cutie-pie.

692
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:39,361
I think everything I'm saying
has a certain amount of merit.

693
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:41,085
- Don't you?
- Sure.

694
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:43,920
- Vincey thinks there's more...
- Wait, wait.

695
00:36:44,687 --> 00:36:47,565
I'm sure Vincey's
a real nice guy, right?

696
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:49,720
But there is absolutely no

697
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:51,639
romantic spark between us.

698
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:57,598
But I tell you what.
I'd love to paint you.

699
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:01,323
Even if you decide you don't want
to do that, I'll go to the doctor

700
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:03,205
with you anyway, all right?

701
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:05,196
Okay.

702
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,599
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

703
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:12,082
Oh, Vincey, man, thank you.

704
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:14,238
Thank you for hooking me up
with Javi, man.

705
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:17,638
And I'm gonna wind up painting him.
Thanks again.

706
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:22,157
What?

707
00:37:24,407 --> 00:37:25,556
Fuck him.

708
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:33,276
Yeah,

709
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:35,199
I wish.

710
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,277
Buzz,

711
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:40,325
you got Javi a little excited
about this whole HIV business.

712
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:42,125
So I'd like to ask you something.

713
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:45,120
- I normally wouldn't ask, but...
- But what?

714
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:49,646
You want to know if I'm
HIV positive, right?

715
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:51,756
Yeah, I'd like to know.

716
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:54,363
As a matter of fact, no.
I don't have it. I'm negative.

717
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:55,798
Bye.

718
00:37:56,487 --> 00:38:00,400
Don't you think is unfair for
you to be talking all this talk?

719
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,365
Because ultimately, is not
your life on the line, Buzz.

720
00:38:04,527 --> 00:38:06,677
You could be wrong,
and go on living your life.

721
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:09,520
- Misinformation could cost his life.
- Yes.

722
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:12,400
You're absolutely right.
It is a big ass responsibility,

723
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:14,046
and I could be wrong.

724
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:17,717
But let me ask you a question...
what if I'm right?

725
00:38:18,327 --> 00:38:20,363
What if HIV doesn't kill

726
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:23,837
T-cells and your friend starts
taking protease inhibitors

727
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:24,957
and dies?

728
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:27,682
Who's gonna be responsible then?

729
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:28,956
You?

730
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:31,559
I think there's been
enough death

731
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,843
and suffering for everybody to take
a little piece of blame, don't you?

732
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:37,124
And on that cheery note,
I want to remind y'all,

733
00:38:37,287 --> 00:38:41,121
regarding Javi's condition you
have to swear not to say anythin'.

734
00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:44,646
Good night, Spalding Gray,

735
00:38:44,807 --> 00:38:46,638
is been really nice
having a conversation with you.

736
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,883
My God, where does Vincey
find these guys?

737
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:07,240
Okay, sugar-dumpling,

738
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:10,046
tell Auntie Miriam
what the problem is.

739
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:11,957
Oh, I know.

740
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:16,086
I bet is that, I'm not in
a relationship thing again, huh?

741
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,484
Look, here it is again.

742
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,279
These gay-bashers

743
00:39:21,447 --> 00:39:24,883
are all whining about how they
in fact are the real victims.

744
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:27,477
That the only reason
they killed those gay guys

745
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:30,684
is because the gay guys put the
moves on them. Give me a break.

746
00:39:30,847 --> 00:39:34,635
What makes every straight guy think
all these queers are after them?

747
00:39:35,687 --> 00:39:37,564
Well darling,
you may not know this,

748
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:40,400
but I'm often mistaken
for being straight.

749
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:43,206
You don't know what is
like being pursued

750
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,164
by all those gorgeous homos
all over town.

751
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:47,716
I mean is like a living hell.

752
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:49,725
You couldn't begin to imagine.

753
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,240
Ls not funny, Mike.

754
00:39:51,887 --> 00:39:52,717
Yes it is.

755
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:55,447
No, is not.
Nothing ever changes.

756
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:59,601
The cops never even looked for the
fuckers who beat me up in college.

757
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:01,878
It seems like is
still all the same.

758
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:05,087
You know, darling, that kind
of violence

759
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:08,239
has been around since time began.

760
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:11,201
I was there.
I really am that old.

761
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:17,083
Okay, now tell Aunt Miriam
what the problem is.

762
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:19,877
I mean, I don't mean this
as a put down,

763
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:23,438
but you've come this far
without a boyfriend,

764
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:26,123
Maybe you should
examine that.

765
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:27,720
I've just been unlucky.

766
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:30,321
I mean there's nothing wrong
with a person going

767
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:31,806
through life single.

768
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:35,480
Lots of people do it,
and they love it.

769
00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:38,965
It doesn't mean they're Ionely

770
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:41,436
or damaged goods
or anything like that.

771
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:43,200
Please, we don't have to mimic

772
00:40:43,647 --> 00:40:46,036
heterosexual coupling patterns.

773
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:49,438
"Hat radical homo group
are you with this week?

774
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:53,806
Now don't take that tone
of voice with me, young lady.

775
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,640
Where's it say that two men have to
settle down and register.

776
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:58,160
I just don't understand, Mike.

777
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:14,121
I'm sorry.

778
00:41:15,927 --> 00:41:18,441
I'm tired of kissing strangers.

779
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:21,162
I don't know
if I can do it anymore.

780
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,635
I know where you're coming
from with that.

781
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:26,801
I really do.

782
00:41:28,607 --> 00:41:30,916
So what are you saying?

783
00:41:31,087 --> 00:41:33,396
I'm saying that I'm sick tired
of hanging out with your fiends.

784
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:34,761
- What?
- Of hanging out with your friends.

785
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,839
- You mean, like your brother?
- We're together because of him.

786
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:39,201
Thas not what I mean.

787
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:42,120
You mean you're tired of hangin'
out with faggots and dykes.

788
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:45,484
- That sounds too fucked up.
- Gus, is a fucked up world, okay?

789
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:48,400
- We just gotta live in it.
- We don't have to live here.

790
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:51,127
I have to live here.
My job is here.

791
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:55,166
My life is here. My friends.
And your brother who has HIV.

792
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,921
Weren't you listening to Buzz?
HIV's got nothing to do with AIDS.

793
00:41:58,087 --> 00:42:00,362
- Everyone knows that.
- He could be right.

794
00:42:00,527 --> 00:42:03,678
Or a lunatic. Thas my point.
I can't friggin' tell anymore.

795
00:42:04,007 --> 00:42:06,999
So, why don't you just run off
to China then?

796
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:09,044
"Hy don't you run off
to Mongolia or Russia?

797
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:11,357
I'm sure life is simpler
anywhere but here.

798
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:13,917
- Why do you treat me this way?
- Oh, fuck off!

799
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,717
She's pissed 'cause if I do go,
she won't get that baby.

800
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:19,400
You see, thas
what I like about Megan.

801
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:23,003
- She's not into that baby crap.
- Newsflash, hombre: All chicks

802
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,519
want babies. And they'll say
or do anything to get 'em.

803
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:31,438
- All chicks?
- Yeah, you got a uterus,

804
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:34,436
you're a fucking liar, man.
Ls a simple rule.

805
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,676
Sojust go on your trip.
Who's stopping you?

806
00:42:41,887 --> 00:42:43,605
Tara. My brother.

807
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:46,959
Tara's a good thing.
I'd be stupid to walk away.

808
00:42:47,287 --> 00:42:48,606
She is a total pop'n fresh.

809
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:54,200
Not that I'd ever,
that she'd ever...

810
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:55,523
Besides,

811
00:42:55,687 --> 00:42:57,484
me and Megan are strong.
Real strong.

812
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:00,238
I just meant, you know...

813
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,602
Tara, she's a nice-Iooking lady.
There's a lot to be said for that.

814
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:05,925
And then there's
that shit with my brother.

815
00:43:06,087 --> 00:43:09,636
How could he let himself get
fucked up like that, man?

816
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:11,843
"Ith that HIVand shit? You know
how my parents are gonna react?

817
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:14,556
They're gonna get heartburn?

818
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:16,925
No, they're gonna fuckin' die.

819
00:43:21,607 --> 00:43:23,165
Everybody fucking dies, man.

820
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:26,444
Your parents don't have to live
with the shit Javi's gonna get.

821
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,756
And neither do you.

822
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,006
So, what are you sayin'?

823
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:33,603
If it were my brother, I'd make
sure he knew I was there for him.

824
00:43:34,287 --> 00:43:35,879
Yeah, well, Javi already
knows that shit.

825
00:43:36,207 --> 00:43:38,562
Oh, he does? All right, then.

826
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:40,919
Just take your fucking shot, man.

827
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:44,200
- So, you think is bullshit?
- I don't know. Javi's

828
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:45,641
at the doctor's right now.

829
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:48,401
My question is,
how are you about all this?

830
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:50,558
Dwight, be careful, baby,
thas heavy...

831
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:54,756
I know you were really hopeful
about the relation.

832
00:43:55,207 --> 00:43:57,357
Look, Sarina, I talked to Javi.

833
00:43:57,527 --> 00:44:00,883
And I told him, "Go for it."
I still don't see it.

834
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:04,636
I know the world has been
populated by strange couples,

835
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:07,002
Sonny and Cher, Fred and Ethel,
Bert and Ernie...

836
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:12,877
But if is going okay for them,
then I say go for it, you know...

837
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:16,078
But what is up with you
and Robin?

838
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:18,317
- Yeah, whas up with that?
- We're great.

839
00:44:18,487 --> 00:44:20,000
And thas why you're moving out?

840
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:23,637
I need my own apartment.
I've cluttered up this place.

841
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:27,516
Why not get a two bedroom?
Robin's wanted to move for years.

842
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:29,246
I've never lived on my own.

843
00:44:29,407 --> 00:44:32,001
I went from home
to college to Megan.

844
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:33,282
I need to try this.

845
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:35,837
Living alone's not that great,
Sarina.

846
00:44:36,247 --> 00:44:38,522
There's no one to blame
if the bathroom's dirty.

847
00:44:38,687 --> 00:44:40,245
Thas it,
you work on her, Vincey.

848
00:44:40,407 --> 00:44:43,365
- Think of the money you'd save.
- You would save money.

849
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:48,961
Can I have this?

850
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:50,446
Can I have it?

851
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:51,764
No.

852
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,438
I don't want to rush into anything

853
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:55,437
this time.

854
00:44:55,647 --> 00:44:56,682
You think you love her?

855
00:44:57,847 --> 00:44:58,677
I don't know.

856
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:00,605
She's great.

857
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:03,879
She's supportive.
She gives me my space,

858
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:06,762
though she'd prefer that space
to be in the same apartment.

859
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,435
- We have good times. I just...
- But?

860
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,040
But I don't know.

861
00:45:12,207 --> 00:45:13,481
I don't know anymore.

862
00:45:14,247 --> 00:45:15,646
Yeah, I know. I hear you.

863
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:18,844
But believe me,
love is hard for everyone.

864
00:45:22,247 --> 00:45:23,600
I hate them.

865
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:31,766
Thas my ex, David.

866
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:44,681
Is that gonna be me soon?

867
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:48,045
Don't have to be.

868
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:51,085
You got that right.

869
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:55,845
So, are you going
to want me naked or what?

870
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:00,957
For... for what exactly?

871
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:04,116
Anything.

872
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:09,002
Anything?

873
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:10,676
Anything.

874
00:46:12,007 --> 00:46:13,076
What do you say,

875
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,882
that we just start
with the painting?

876
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,281
Right...

877
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,405
Sounds good to me.

878
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:32,156
So why did you really
stop painting?

879
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:37,243
You know, same old shit, man.

880
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:40,238
I had a great lover.

881
00:46:40,807 --> 00:46:42,923
He was positive.
I'm negative.

882
00:46:43,127 --> 00:46:45,687
We thought AZT
was a good idea.

883
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,162
He gets sick.
I take care of him.

884
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:49,800
And he dies.

885
00:46:50,847 --> 00:46:53,645
And I try to get back
into art scene again.

886
00:46:53,807 --> 00:46:57,436
But by then nobody's interested
in my shit anymore.

887
00:46:57,767 --> 00:47:00,281
So I say fuck it.
I'll go into teaching.

888
00:47:00,847 --> 00:47:02,724
You know, less hassle.
Less stress.

889
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:05,084
And now you're ready
to take up the cause again.

890
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:07,158
This time with me.

891
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,082
Look,

892
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,203
I thought we just agreed

893
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:17,483
that we were going
to take this slowly.

894
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:19,403
Okay.

895
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:21,236
Yes.

896
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,403
- It starts 8 o'clock tomorrow.
- We don't want you to pray.

897
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:25,841
Just Kool-Aid.

898
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:27,122
I'm busy!

899
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:29,482
There're gonna be a lot of single,
interesting guys there.

900
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:33,163
- Right, guys we know from church.
- I'm so not interested.

901
00:47:33,847 --> 00:47:36,361
We both feel awful
about Javi and Buzz

902
00:47:36,527 --> 00:47:39,564
- and you and what happened...
- Why? I'm got dumped.

903
00:47:39,727 --> 00:47:41,240
You shouldn't be so
self-defeatist about it.

904
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:42,886
You have to have a better attitude.

905
00:47:45,807 --> 00:47:48,799
Would you just relax,
I'm just cleaning crevices.

906
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,366
But if you keep annoying me...

907
00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:56,803
We just know a few guys
you might get along with.

908
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:00,127
You know what, you guys,
I know you mean well,

909
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:03,916
but the worlïs different for me
than for people who look like you.

910
00:48:05,527 --> 00:48:08,200
Things come so easily to you guys,
you just have no idea.

911
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:12,046
That is just so not true.

912
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:16,526
First of all, you are just
as good-Iooking as Diego or I.

913
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:17,881
To some people.

914
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:22,317
- To others you're better looking.
- Yeah, you got the whole writer,

915
00:48:22,487 --> 00:48:25,604
artsy, goatee thing happening.
Very attractive.

916
00:48:25,767 --> 00:48:26,961
Exactly. Mechanic. Everything.

917
00:48:27,127 --> 00:48:28,606
On top of that, you have
to remember that Diego and I

918
00:48:29,327 --> 00:48:31,283
have our ups and downs
just like anybody else.

919
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:34,802
The difference is we work
at our relationship, Vincey.

920
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:37,281
Oh, really?

921
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:39,086
When was the last time you two
had a fight?

922
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:42,442
- This morning.
- Right, it was just this morning.

923
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:45,559
I wanted to make pancakes
for breakfast.

924
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:47,922
I hadn't cooked in a while,
so I wanted to cook.

925
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,558
Except, I cannot make pancakes,

926
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:53,479
so I figured
I'd make omelets instead.

927
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:56,798
In the end, we compromised
and we went out for breakfast.

928
00:48:58,567 --> 00:48:59,602
We went out for breakfast.

929
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:01,725
Rooty-tooty-fresh-and-fruity.

930
00:49:01,887 --> 00:49:03,718
- I can still taste it.
- Oh, it was so good.

931
00:49:04,927 --> 00:49:05,882
Vincey?

932
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,117
- Come on now, stop.
- Come on.

933
00:49:08,807 --> 00:49:11,116
No, I did not meet anybody,

934
00:49:11,287 --> 00:49:13,926
because I was stuck talking to your
church friend the whole night.

935
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:16,920
You know, the one who dresses
Barbie dolls like the Virgin Mary,

936
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:21,042
and puts them in his window to guard
the apartment against evil spirits.

937
00:49:21,487 --> 00:49:24,001
No, no, no this is not funny,
you guys,

938
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:27,205
because now I am horny
and I'm depressed,

939
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:29,244
and I might just kill somebody,

940
00:49:29,407 --> 00:49:31,682
and it may be just one
of you two.

941
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:34,839
Look, I'm sorry that none
of my friends came to see you.

942
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:37,475
- Where'd they go?
- I had a good time.

943
00:49:37,647 --> 00:49:38,875
I'm sure you did.

944
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:41,163
With all the girls
throwing themselves at you.

945
00:49:41,327 --> 00:49:43,716
I was ready
to smack the shit out of

946
00:49:43,887 --> 00:49:45,445
that green-eyed bitch
hanging all over you.

947
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:50,078
- Sister Elizabeth was friendly.
- Oh yeah, sure, right, sister.

948
00:49:50,247 --> 00:49:52,397
- Is she a stripper?
- I gotta go pee.

949
00:49:52,567 --> 00:49:53,966
- Vincey, now?
- Come on.

950
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:57,164
- Pee?
- What is it with you men?

951
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:02,039
Look, I want to apologize.

952
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,198
Sarina told me
how you felt about Buzz.

953
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:05,686
Oh, please, is no big deal.

954
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:08,600
I just got my signals crossed.
It happens all the time.

955
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:10,680
Are you sure?

956
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:14,039
Are you gonna break up with him?
What good would that do me?

957
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:17,076
If you guys are happy,
then great.

958
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,878
There's so much shit in this world,
if you can find something good,

959
00:50:21,087 --> 00:50:22,805
I want you to have it.

960
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,441
Now don't pee on my leg.

961
00:50:30,047 --> 00:50:31,639
Look at these cocksuckers.

962
00:50:34,127 --> 00:50:36,516
Rise and shine boys!

963
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:42,641
Where you going', baby?

964
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:44,163
Hey, faggot,

965
00:50:44,327 --> 00:50:46,522
ever get a bat shoved
up your ass?

966
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,003
Fore!

967
00:50:55,607 --> 00:50:57,438
Oh, thas gonna leave a mark.

968
00:50:58,247 --> 00:50:59,566
You gonna take out your wallet,

969
00:51:00,687 --> 00:51:03,121
or are we gonna have to knock
your fuckin' teeth out first?

970
00:51:03,287 --> 00:51:05,084
- Suck us off better.
- Yes!

971
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:13,202
Hey, I bet you take it up
the ass real nice, fag-boy.

972
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:14,597
Yeah,

973
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:15,483
yeah, like that.

974
00:51:15,647 --> 00:51:17,160
- Dude, beer bottle.
- On it.

975
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:20,520
Hold still, baby.

976
00:51:21,607 --> 00:51:22,517
Honors?

977
00:51:24,407 --> 00:51:25,157
Help!

978
00:51:26,967 --> 00:51:30,676
Help me! Help me!
Help me!

979
00:51:31,647 --> 00:51:33,717
Now baby, you gotta relax.

980
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:35,760
Or this isn't gonna be pleasant
for you.

981
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:38,682
You get away from him!

982
00:51:39,447 --> 00:51:40,766
Get away from him!

983
00:51:43,047 --> 00:51:44,560
Motherfuckers!

984
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,126
Motherfucker!

985
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:04,125
You want to fight?

986
00:52:06,087 --> 00:52:06,917
You want to fight?

987
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:09,042
Vincey!

988
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,957
"Hat about you, huh?

989
00:52:28,207 --> 00:52:30,118
Don't fucking come near me.

990
00:52:30,927 --> 00:52:32,360
Stay the fuck away from me.

991
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:35,445
This fucker was about to shove
a beer bottle up my ass.

992
00:52:35,607 --> 00:52:37,006
All right man,
just fucking let him go, okay.

993
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,158
- Where are your buddies now?
- His friends might come back.

994
00:52:39,327 --> 00:52:40,840
I don't see 'em anywhere.

995
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:44,198
Tell me you guys feel sorry
for this little shit!

996
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:46,046
Fucking let him go!

997
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,323
- His friends might come back!
- You gotta stay away because,

998
00:52:48,487 --> 00:52:50,443
otherwise I'm gonna have
to cut his neck.

999
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:51,357
Vincey!

1000
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:54,246
- Put that goddamn knife away!
- I'll cut his throat.

1001
00:52:54,407 --> 00:52:56,079
And then I'll be a murderer,
and you'll all be accomplices.

1002
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,245
Tell me one court in this world
that wouldn't put us all to death.

1003
00:52:59,887 --> 00:53:02,003
Don't think I won't do it!

1004
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:02,758
I'm sorry.

1005
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:06,437
- Oh, yeah?
- What are you sorry for exactly?

1006
00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:08,086
Are you sorry for getting caught?

1007
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:10,882
Are you sorry for taking
my wallet?

1008
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:14,437
Stop it right now.

1009
00:53:15,047 --> 00:53:17,481
- Let him go, Vincey.
- Sorry for getting it up the ass

1010
00:53:17,647 --> 00:53:18,966
while total strangers watched?

1011
00:53:20,607 --> 00:53:22,518
But you're the one got me
all heated up, baby.

1012
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:26,004
Cute little straight boy like you,
You gotta let me get my rocks off.

1013
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:32,162
Leave me alone, man!

1014
00:53:32,327 --> 00:53:33,043
Relax,

1015
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:35,681
this is not gonna be pleasant
for you at all if you don't.

1016
00:53:35,847 --> 00:53:38,441
Stop it, Vincey. Stop it.
Remember who you are.

1017
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:41,167
Vincey, put the knife away.

1018
00:53:45,887 --> 00:53:46,876
Relax!

1019
00:53:49,847 --> 00:53:51,041
Relax.

1020
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:54,122
Ls just sex.

1021
00:53:54,287 --> 00:53:56,562
You see, gay boys have learned
how to relax,

1022
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:01,719
so we can enjoy the secret pleasure
of being fucked over all the time.

1023
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:05,882
Get the hell out of here!

1024
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:07,400
Now!

1025
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:11,002
Man, don't you even want
my pager number?

1026
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:12,995
Don't I even get a kiss?

1027
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:16,237
You're just like all the others!
You motherfucker!

1028
00:54:16,527 --> 00:54:18,279
Let go of me you fucking assholes!

1029
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,120
Les get out of here, Diego.

1030
00:57:31,487 --> 00:57:34,524
We're sorry, Vincey. We didn't know
what they were doing.

1031
00:57:45,487 --> 00:57:46,283
What?

1032
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:53,678
Maybe we should go to the police,
and report the whole thing.

1033
00:57:57,527 --> 00:57:59,006
I ain't saying shit.

1034
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:02,242
Dwight, hello. I'm a fag...

1035
00:58:02,447 --> 00:58:06,076
who was drunk in an alleyway
and raped a straight man.

1036
00:58:06,247 --> 00:58:07,999
They'd put me away for life.

1037
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:11,682
They got cute boys in prison.
You could finally get a boyfriend.

1038
00:58:12,047 --> 00:58:14,083
Vincey, what if the guy goes
and reports it?

1039
00:58:14,727 --> 00:58:16,922
Somehow I doubt that dickhead is
gonna go to the cops and tell them

1040
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:19,243
he got it up the ass by a faggot.

1041
00:58:19,407 --> 00:58:20,635
Vincey's right,

1042
00:58:20,807 --> 00:58:22,479
- we should just drop it.
- Thank you.

1043
00:58:22,647 --> 00:58:25,480
Reverend Nelgood said harboring
secrets causes horrible nightmares.

1044
00:58:25,647 --> 00:58:28,798
You told your pastor?
"Hat are you, nuts?

1045
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:30,525
Doesn't he have to report it
now or somethin'?

1046
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:34,403
No, is priests who can't mention
what they hear in confession.

1047
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:37,604
You guys shouldn't be
tellin' anyone.

1048
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:39,041
Coming from Miss Tight Lips.

1049
00:58:39,207 --> 00:58:40,196
Hey, look who's talking.

1050
00:58:41,287 --> 00:58:42,879
We didn't do anything wrong.

1051
00:58:43,047 --> 00:58:45,561
- But you think I did?
- We didn't say that, okay.

1052
00:58:45,727 --> 00:58:46,842
Vincey, you did kind
of rape a guy.

1053
00:58:47,007 --> 00:58:49,202
I think the motherfucker got
off easy, personally.

1054
00:58:49,367 --> 00:58:52,757
If that were me, not only would I
have fucked up the motherfucker,

1055
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:56,522
but I'd have shoved the bat up
his ass till it bust his skull.

1056
00:58:57,087 --> 00:59:00,841
- Thas what I'm saying.
- Then kick him down the street.

1057
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:03,805
- This is pretty, very pretty.
- You guys aren't saying this.

1058
00:59:03,967 --> 00:59:06,003
Believe it. You guys are Christians.

1059
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,886
- You believe in things, right?
- Yeah, like forgiveness.

1060
00:59:09,367 --> 00:59:12,564
And what exactly am I supposed
to be forgiven for?

1061
00:59:12,727 --> 00:59:13,842
I didn't mean that, Vincey.

1062
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:16,475
Vincey, you really didn't have
to humiliate the guy like that.

1063
00:59:16,647 --> 00:59:18,046
Maybe you took the whole thing
a little too far.

1064
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:21,564
You think maybe, what?
I shoulda let him fuck me?

1065
00:59:22,047 --> 00:59:24,436
- I mean, he was cute, but...
- You don't have to makejokes.

1066
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:26,484
Then what do I gotta do?

1067
00:59:27,247 --> 00:59:28,680
Cry all day?

1068
00:59:29,127 --> 00:59:31,277
Go to the cops
and have them lock me up?

1069
00:59:31,647 --> 00:59:33,205
Go kill myself?

1070
00:59:36,127 --> 00:59:38,846
Look, you guys, I don't know
why I didn't run away

1071
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:41,278
or how I got a hard-on,

1072
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:44,877
or what I coulïve done differently,
except that what happened, happened,

1073
00:59:45,487 --> 00:59:48,206
and I'm glad that at least
this time, I fought back.

1074
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:50,280
All right, I should shut up but,

1075
00:59:50,647 --> 00:59:52,842
maybe you need to talk
to a counsellor.

1076
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:56,082
No, no, I can't do this anymore,
you guys.

1077
00:59:56,967 --> 00:59:57,717
I'm sorry.

1078
00:59:57,887 --> 01:00:00,640
In the last seven days,
we have talked about nothing else.

1079
01:00:02,887 --> 01:00:04,559
I gotta get away from you all.

1080
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:06,639
Ls nothing against any of you,
isjust...

1081
01:00:07,527 --> 01:00:09,643
- Vincey, wait we didn't mean...
- Stop it!

1082
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,480
I'm sorry! I know. I know.

1083
01:00:16,007 --> 01:00:17,725
But I have got to get away.

1084
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:23,081
I will be fine. Don't worry
about me. Okay?

1085
01:00:25,407 --> 01:00:26,237
Just...

1086
01:00:31,847 --> 01:00:34,441
Honey, give the man some room.
He'll be fine.

1087
01:00:36,607 --> 01:00:38,359
You know, Megan told me,

1088
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:43,157
when he was in college, some guys
beat the shit out of him on campus,

1089
01:00:43,327 --> 01:00:44,919
and then he disappeared for weeks.

1090
01:00:45,087 --> 01:00:46,122
"Here is she, anyway?

1091
01:00:46,287 --> 01:00:48,243
Megan?
Her parents are in town.

1092
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,327
You wanted to tell them what
happened with Megan's parents.

1093
01:00:53,087 --> 01:00:54,406
Nah, don't feel like it.

1094
01:00:55,247 --> 01:00:56,441
But you hafta swear

1095
01:00:56,927 --> 01:00:59,236
- not to say anythin'.
- I don't sound like that.

1096
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:02,240
- You sound exactly like that.
- No I don't...

1097
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:07,565
Anybody want to hear about her?

1098
01:01:08,047 --> 01:01:09,526
A new story?

1099
01:01:10,407 --> 01:01:11,681
Okay.

1100
01:01:13,847 --> 01:01:15,838
I hope you like the salmon,
father. Ls the best in town.

1101
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,366
Sarina used to cook us

1102
01:01:17,527 --> 01:01:19,677
the most exotic dishes every time
we came into town.

1103
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,200
- Didn't she darling?
- Yes.

1104
01:01:21,367 --> 01:01:22,880
Absolutely divine.

1105
01:01:23,127 --> 01:01:25,243
It was a new taste thrill
every time.

1106
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:26,840
Not that this isn't lovely, dear.

1107
01:01:27,007 --> 01:01:29,362
It really is.
Megan can't cook.

1108
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:31,046
But you must know that now.

1109
01:01:32,407 --> 01:01:33,362
But that Sarina...

1110
01:01:33,527 --> 01:01:35,518
Did we tell you Sarina
sent us flowers?

1111
01:01:35,687 --> 01:01:38,247
My God, exquisite!
Absolutely gorgeous!

1112
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:40,363
You know, Jared just got
a promotion at work.

1113
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:41,920
He's our new Vice President
of Video Planning.

1114
01:01:42,087 --> 01:01:42,963
Well, thas terrific, Jared.

1115
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:44,958
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, darling.

1116
01:01:45,127 --> 01:01:45,718
Thank you.

1117
01:01:45,927 --> 01:01:50,079
Where Sarina got you the interview?
And they gave you the job?

1118
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:51,961
Extraordinary. Really?

1119
01:01:52,127 --> 01:01:54,721
"Ith that long hair.
How progressive of them!

1120
01:01:54,887 --> 01:01:57,117
- He knows Sarina?
- They're cousins, darling.

1121
01:01:57,287 --> 01:02:00,245
- Second cousins. By marriage.
- Really? You don't look like her.

1122
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:02,796
She is such a pretty, pretty girl.
"Here is she living now?

1123
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:05,920
Could we not talk about Sarina
for five minutes, please?

1124
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:07,884
You don't have to be testy, dear.

1125
01:02:08,247 --> 01:02:10,158
After all, you did live together
for a very long time.

1126
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:13,478
God, Mother, anyone else's
parents would be thrilled their

1127
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,115
daughter was out of a lesbian
relationship and seeing a man.

1128
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:19,638
A handsome, successful, good man
at that, but you two just carry on.

1129
01:02:20,687 --> 01:02:22,439
She always was a testy one!

1130
01:02:22,927 --> 01:02:24,360
Alicia, I think thas enough.

1131
01:02:24,527 --> 01:02:28,042
No! Ls time for honesty.
Here, at this table, honesty.

1132
01:02:28,647 --> 01:02:29,602
You,

1133
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:34,282
at a very young age,
you came to the two of us

1134
01:02:34,527 --> 01:02:38,076
and you said to us
that you were a lesbian.

1135
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:40,045
And that we should
just get used to it.

1136
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:42,084
And now you bring in this.

1137
01:02:42,647 --> 01:02:45,639
- Sarina was like a daughter.
- Enough.

1138
01:02:46,607 --> 01:02:49,405
"Hat do we say at P-FLAG?
That is what I'd like to know.

1139
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:52,365
- P-FLAG? - Parents and Friends
of Lesbians And Gays.

1140
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:56,164
Emile and I have been very active
in the organisation.

1141
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:59,245
I'd also like you to know that
your father has written a book,

1142
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:01,597
about our experiences which
was just

1143
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:04,565
about to get a rave in
the New York Times Book Review.

1144
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:06,362
They love it.

1145
01:03:06,687 --> 01:03:09,247
And now this.
This is really,

1146
01:03:09,527 --> 01:03:11,438
a little bit embarrassing.

1147
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:13,646
You bring in...

1148
01:03:13,847 --> 01:03:17,522
You've changed everything now.
All right, thas it.

1149
01:03:19,127 --> 01:03:21,357
I'm not going to mention
another word about this.

1150
01:03:22,207 --> 01:03:24,357
I've said my piece, and darling,

1151
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:26,399
I would love a drink.

1152
01:03:30,127 --> 01:03:32,243
Thank you so much.

1153
01:03:32,407 --> 01:03:33,157
All right.

1154
01:03:33,607 --> 01:03:34,926
To Sarina.

1155
01:03:35,527 --> 01:03:37,085
To such a lovely girl.

1156
01:03:41,287 --> 01:03:42,402
You see,

1157
01:03:42,647 --> 01:03:45,286
despite the hugeness of what
happened with Vincey,

1158
01:03:45,567 --> 01:03:47,319
our own lives still went on.

1159
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:49,405
And we still all had
our same old problems.

1160
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:51,444
And what was weighing down
on my brain was...

1161
01:03:52,727 --> 01:03:55,116
I wanted a wedding.
A full-scale ceremony.

1162
01:03:55,287 --> 01:03:57,960
I wanted bridesmaids,
freaked-out relatives,

1163
01:03:58,127 --> 01:04:00,243
flower girl, ring-bearer girl,
the whole she-bang.

1164
01:04:01,847 --> 01:04:02,882
And,

1165
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:04,640
if not that,

1166
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:07,363
I wanted us to move in together.

1167
01:04:08,047 --> 01:04:11,244
If not that then a commitment
to more nights together.

1168
01:04:11,407 --> 01:04:13,204
And if not that, just more.

1169
01:04:13,367 --> 01:04:15,039
I wanted more.

1170
01:04:16,447 --> 01:04:18,244
More, what? I don't know.

1171
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:20,796
But just lately,

1172
01:04:21,127 --> 01:04:22,685
I'd had the sneaky suspicion

1173
01:04:23,487 --> 01:04:25,079
that Megan,
that greedy little bitch,

1174
01:04:25,247 --> 01:04:28,080
was using the Vincey Incident
to wiggle back into Sarina's life.

1175
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:32,002
He'd introduced them, so they're
on the phone all the time.

1176
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:36,001
I didn't want to deny Sarina
her friendships or anything.

1177
01:04:39,247 --> 01:04:40,157
I...

1178
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:42,121
just felt that...

1179
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:46,406
Megan still had some kind
of control over Sarina's heart.

1180
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:52,998
Robbie, are you okay?

1181
01:05:01,847 --> 01:05:03,519
Baby, I need more time.

1182
01:05:04,687 --> 01:05:06,245
For what?

1183
01:05:07,847 --> 01:05:09,485
Everything's great.

1184
01:05:11,567 --> 01:05:13,717
Ljust don't understand.
I don't understand

1185
01:05:14,087 --> 01:05:15,566
why we can't just get
a place together?

1186
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:17,800
I just moved in here.

1187
01:05:18,087 --> 01:05:19,759
Yeah, and you hate it here, baby.

1188
01:05:21,007 --> 01:05:22,918
I know, honey,

1189
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:25,726
but I can't make
a commitment right now.

1190
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:32,639
I don't want that.

1191
01:05:33,447 --> 01:05:35,483
Not until you're ready to take it
to the next level.

1192
01:05:37,007 --> 01:05:39,805
You talk like we're trapped
in a video game.

1193
01:05:40,887 --> 01:05:44,482
No, you talk like you're trapped in
a sick relationship game with me.

1194
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:45,284
Look,

1195
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:47,600
I told you on the first night,

1196
01:05:49,327 --> 01:05:50,646
that I cannot

1197
01:05:50,807 --> 01:05:52,160
make a commit.

1198
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:53,436
Not yet.

1199
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:56,246
I mean, I was
in a nine year relationship

1200
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:57,556
with the same woman.

1201
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,243
What?

1202
01:06:01,727 --> 01:06:04,480
You want to sleep around?
You want to try men?

1203
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:06,485
You want to get back with Megan?

1204
01:06:06,647 --> 01:06:09,525
Is there something specific you
want to do besides torture me?

1205
01:06:16,007 --> 01:06:17,759
- Bobby-bear...
- No!

1206
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:25,678
Ls because I'm too butch.

1207
01:06:27,327 --> 01:06:28,237
What?

1208
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:32,238
I know I'm not girlie-girlie
like Megan.

1209
01:06:32,407 --> 01:06:34,921
I'm not even girlie-girlie
like Ru Paul.

1210
01:06:35,087 --> 01:06:36,645
Shit, next to me,
Janet Reno looks fem.

1211
01:06:36,807 --> 01:06:38,399
But at least with me you know
what you're getting.

1212
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:42,355
I'm not some confused straight
girl playing games with you.

1213
01:06:43,647 --> 01:06:46,480
You know that butchlfem stuff
means nothing to me.

1214
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,759
Yeah, on a theoretical level.

1215
01:06:48,927 --> 01:06:50,724
But when it comes to taking me
to the teachers' picnic,

1216
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:52,923
and everybody's wondering
if thas your little brother,

1217
01:06:53,087 --> 01:06:55,078
well thas just
a whole other story, isn't it?

1218
01:06:57,927 --> 01:07:00,122
I want to ask you a question.

1219
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,957
Why is it that everyone

1220
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:07,603
can have problems,
except for me?

1221
01:07:09,647 --> 01:07:11,239
Why is it that I always

1222
01:07:11,407 --> 01:07:13,875
have to be the understanding one?

1223
01:07:14,527 --> 01:07:17,246
Who do I turn to when I need it?

1224
01:07:17,407 --> 01:07:18,157
You turn to me.

1225
01:07:18,527 --> 01:07:20,279
Thas what I'm here for.

1226
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,642
Yeah, thas what I thought.
But you can't even

1227
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:26,358
allow me the "privilege" of
getting over a 9 year relationship.

1228
01:07:26,527 --> 01:07:27,721
No, no, no.

1229
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:30,280
Sari, I'm sorry.

1230
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:32,282
I love you.

1231
01:07:35,527 --> 01:07:37,597
I love you so much.
I don't want to see you sad.

1232
01:07:37,767 --> 01:07:39,405
I don't want to see you cry.

1233
01:07:41,247 --> 01:07:43,283
I'll wait, okay?

1234
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:45,282
I'll wait.

1235
01:07:46,007 --> 01:07:47,759
I'll wait a whole lifetime
if you want me to.

1236
01:07:49,087 --> 01:07:51,317
And then I think: You idiot!

1237
01:07:51,487 --> 01:07:52,966
Whad you tell her that for?

1238
01:07:53,647 --> 01:07:55,842
You have trouble waiting
for microwave popcorn.

1239
01:07:56,647 --> 01:07:58,399
So are they going
to stay together or not?

1240
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:00,558
I don't know.
But you know lesbians are like

1241
01:08:01,247 --> 01:08:04,796
Catholics or Saturday Night Live,
going on no matter how bad it gets.

1242
01:08:05,367 --> 01:08:06,595
Speaking of mates for life,

1243
01:08:06,927 --> 01:08:09,964
- guess who I just saw?
- Vincey and Mr. Beer Bottle?

1244
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:11,196
Tara...

1245
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:12,356
Don't tell me Diego and Dwight?

1246
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:14,159
EXactly! Now get this.

1247
01:08:14,367 --> 01:08:17,279
Buzz and I finished work-out and
ran into them in the parking lot.

1248
01:08:17,967 --> 01:08:19,878
I swear, it was
like they were avoiding us.

1249
01:08:20,047 --> 01:08:22,845
They came up with some lame
excuse about being in a rush.

1250
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,646
Well, maybe they were.

1251
01:08:24,807 --> 01:08:26,763
When have they ever been
in a rush to get anywhere,

1252
01:08:26,927 --> 01:08:28,883
except an Amy Grant concert?

1253
01:08:29,127 --> 01:08:31,800
Besides, it was the way
they looked at us.

1254
01:08:31,967 --> 01:08:35,403
They can't possibly be mad at us
for not reportin' Vincey, can they?

1255
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,162
My guess is that they're still
wigged over the whole thing.

1256
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:40,887
Thas why we should
all get together again.

1257
01:08:41,047 --> 01:08:42,844
- And nobody's heard from Vincey?
- Nope.

1258
01:08:43,007 --> 01:08:44,235
Not since the barbecue.

1259
01:08:44,407 --> 01:08:46,045
And thas been five weeks.

1260
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,925
I don't know what to do anymore,
Javi.

1261
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:49,964
I've gone over there ten times.
He's never home.

1262
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:53,005
I call every day.
I only get his answering machine.

1263
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:54,919
I mean, I don't even know
what I'd say anymore.

1264
01:08:55,247 --> 01:08:57,602
"Hi, Vincey,
I know you're probably out

1265
01:08:57,767 --> 01:09:00,679
keepin' West Hollywood safe by
beatin' up gay-bashers right now,

1266
01:09:00,847 --> 01:09:02,724
but when you get a minute,
can you give me a call?"

1267
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:04,878
Hey, you better watch out,
or he might come after you next.

1268
01:09:05,047 --> 01:09:07,766
Javi, I'm serious.
I am really worried about Vincey.

1269
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:11,119
You want to worry about something,
worry about my shoulder.

1270
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:14,166
All right, I saw your shoulder,
there's nothin' there.

1271
01:09:15,087 --> 01:09:15,837
Where?

1272
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:18,120
Right here.

1273
01:09:20,247 --> 01:09:21,600
I don't see anything.

1274
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:23,042
Right there.

1275
01:09:24,087 --> 01:09:25,440
There's nothing.

1276
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:28,804
There's nothing there. Come on.

1277
01:09:29,007 --> 01:09:29,803
Ls a blotch.

1278
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:37,679
It a freckle, man.
The tiniest freckle in the world.

1279
01:09:37,847 --> 01:09:40,156
I think I would know it if I had
a freckle on my shoulder, Buzz.

1280
01:09:41,207 --> 01:09:43,880
People get freckles
all the time, man.

1281
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:46,880
You went riding last week without
your shirt in the park, remember?

1282
01:09:47,047 --> 01:09:48,321
Could have happened then.

1283
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:51,440
Ls cancer.
Ls starting.

1284
01:09:53,807 --> 01:09:56,367
Nothing is starting, Javi.
Come on, man.

1285
01:09:56,527 --> 01:10:00,406
Besides, we both agreed if you
came down with any real illnesses,

1286
01:10:00,567 --> 01:10:02,364
- we'd investigate them.
- Okay then, feel my glands.

1287
01:10:02,527 --> 01:10:03,676
They're swollen.

1288
01:10:03,847 --> 01:10:05,803
Your glands are not swollen.

1289
01:10:06,007 --> 01:10:07,486
You didn't feel them.

1290
01:10:21,007 --> 01:10:22,486
They're not swollen.

1291
01:10:24,607 --> 01:10:25,278
I can feel them.

1292
01:10:27,687 --> 01:10:29,484
If you could not feel them,

1293
01:10:30,007 --> 01:10:31,156
they would not be there.

1294
01:10:32,287 --> 01:10:35,324
I'm calling Dr. Mellgard.
And this time you're not invited.

1295
01:10:35,487 --> 01:10:37,478
Not after that last episode.

1296
01:10:37,727 --> 01:10:38,876
It was just too Norma Rae for me.

1297
01:10:39,047 --> 01:10:40,560
- But Javi, man, look...
- But nothing, Buzz.

1298
01:10:40,727 --> 01:10:43,525
He is still my doctor.
And he's a respected doctor.

1299
01:10:43,687 --> 01:10:45,564
Besides, I don't want him pissed
off at me.

1300
01:10:45,727 --> 01:10:48,366
Especially when my pants are down
and his fingers are up my butt.

1301
01:10:49,007 --> 01:10:50,804
Fingers?
Ls only supposed to be one.

1302
01:11:03,647 --> 01:11:04,557
Sweetie?

1303
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:06,242
I'll be right out.

1304
01:11:06,847 --> 01:11:08,121
You got a moment?

1305
01:11:09,327 --> 01:11:11,761
Honey, I'm really late for work.

1306
01:11:11,927 --> 01:11:13,565
This won't take long.

1307
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:17,207
- Fuck!
- Exactly. "hat the fuck is this?

1308
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:21,242
- Are you going through my things?
- Don't even try that approach.

1309
01:11:21,847 --> 01:11:23,803
Let me dry off, okay?

1310
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,002
What, so you were gonna
just leave without tellin' me?

1311
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:31,160
"Honey, I'm goin' to the store for
ex-lax," and then never come back?

1312
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,204
We've talked about this before,
Tara.

1313
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:36,120
This isn't something new.
Ls a ticket to the Middle East!

1314
01:11:36,287 --> 01:11:37,606
I can't stay here!

1315
01:11:37,767 --> 01:11:39,803
- What about yourjob?
- The one you're making me late for?

1316
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:43,562
Right, is my fault.
I'm making you late for work.

1317
01:11:43,727 --> 01:11:45,763
You can't just wander off.

1318
01:11:46,607 --> 01:11:49,519
- You're not a kid anymore.
- Don't tell me what I cannot do.

1319
01:11:49,687 --> 01:11:52,565
You want to settle down, I don't.
I've said that from the start.

1320
01:11:52,967 --> 01:11:55,322
Yeah, well talk is one thing,
but this,

1321
01:11:55,887 --> 01:11:57,445
this is sayin' you'd rather

1322
01:11:57,607 --> 01:12:00,679
wander around the war capitals
of the world than stay with me.

1323
01:12:00,967 --> 01:12:03,083
Like there's no violence in L.A.

1324
01:12:03,247 --> 01:12:04,646
Can't you just stop for a second

1325
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:07,517
and think what you're givin' up?

1326
01:12:07,927 --> 01:12:09,246
You think I haven't?

1327
01:12:09,447 --> 01:12:10,926
No, I don't think you have.

1328
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,755
'Cause I'll tell you one thing
you're not gonna find out there,

1329
01:12:15,047 --> 01:12:17,641
in Cairo or anywhere else,
and thas me.

1330
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:20,477
It would be different
if you were a scientist

1331
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,203
and wanted to explore
the rainforests,

1332
01:12:23,367 --> 01:12:24,595
or you were a businessman

1333
01:12:24,767 --> 01:12:26,997
and wanted to open an office
in Beijing.

1334
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:29,283
That would be something
totally different.

1335
01:12:29,607 --> 01:12:31,325
But you're so vague about it.

1336
01:12:31,687 --> 01:12:35,316
Ls not like you're running
towards something but runnin' away.

1337
01:12:35,967 --> 01:12:37,559
I think by the time
you realise that

1338
01:12:37,847 --> 01:12:41,681
and come back to get what you
left behind, ill be too late.

1339
01:12:45,287 --> 01:12:48,006
I know you don't want to hear this,
but I love you, Gus.

1340
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:50,358
And don't you think
I love you too?

1341
01:12:52,607 --> 01:12:53,801
I don't know.

1342
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:55,157
Do you?

1343
01:12:55,327 --> 01:12:58,683
Yeah, of course I love you, Tara.
But I can't stay.

1344
01:12:59,247 --> 01:13:01,841
If what we've gos not strong
enough to last till I come back,

1345
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:03,520
then thas something
I just gotta risk.

1346
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:05,805
But I've never left California.

1347
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,965
I only did community college.
I can't say why I gotta do this.

1348
01:13:09,247 --> 01:13:11,966
But that night when Vincey
did that shit,

1349
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:15,240
I kept thinking I've lived such
a totally sheltered life.

1350
01:13:15,647 --> 01:13:17,638
That all this shis happening
to all these people,

1351
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:20,196
but everything that happens to me
is through you and people I know.

1352
01:13:20,367 --> 01:13:24,076
I was having this totally
fucking bizarre experience,

1353
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:26,842
but then I realised that
I wasn't having any experience.

1354
01:13:27,087 --> 01:13:29,157
That I was just watching.

1355
01:13:30,047 --> 01:13:32,515
Not that I want to be doing
what Vincey did,

1356
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:34,759
but I gotta start
doing something on my own.

1357
01:13:35,007 --> 01:13:36,599
But is gotta be out there.

1358
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,565
And is gotta be on my own.
Thas the best way I can put it.

1359
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,563
Baby, youjust gotta let him go.

1360
01:13:43,647 --> 01:13:46,320
- What else can you do?
- I could break both his legs,

1361
01:13:46,487 --> 01:13:48,478
so he'd have to cancel
his stupid trip.

1362
01:13:48,807 --> 01:13:50,206
Got any brandy to go in this?

1363
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:53,365
- Tara, is 9 in the morning.
- Yeah, so? Whas your point?

1364
01:13:54,047 --> 01:13:55,719
We should be drinking
Bloody Marys.

1365
01:13:57,007 --> 01:14:00,397
Ls hard for me to believe
Gus would pull this crap on me,

1366
01:14:00,567 --> 01:14:02,444
but is even harder to believe

1367
01:14:02,607 --> 01:14:04,404
that Sarina hasn't called you yet.

1368
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,199
Thas gonna happen sooner
or later.

1369
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:10,841
You don't know anything for sure,
so les not jump to conclusions.

1370
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:13,805
Tell me what happened.
And start from the beginning...

1371
01:14:22,447 --> 01:14:24,642
- Robin?
- Darling?

1372
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:29,556
Sorry to bother you at this hour,
but I have to talk to Sarina.

1373
01:14:30,367 --> 01:14:32,039
Baby, is telephone...

1374
01:14:32,487 --> 01:14:33,397
telephone.

1375
01:14:37,007 --> 01:14:37,757
Hello? 0

1376
01:14:38,247 --> 01:14:39,839
Thank God you're there!

1377
01:14:40,207 --> 01:14:41,640
You have to come over right away.

1378
01:14:42,207 --> 01:14:43,560
Megan, whas wrong?

1379
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:46,361
Just, please, just come.
I need you.

1380
01:14:47,127 --> 01:14:48,196
What is it?

1381
01:14:51,927 --> 01:14:53,758
Ls... is... Mr. Mittens.

1382
01:14:54,607 --> 01:14:55,756
Whas happened?

1383
01:14:56,407 --> 01:14:58,045
He's... he's not moving!

1384
01:14:58,567 --> 01:15:03,482
Megan probably poisoned the cat
to get Sarina over there.

1385
01:15:06,607 --> 01:15:07,835
Did you take him to the vet?

1386
01:15:08,207 --> 01:15:09,799
You're the first one I called.

1387
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:11,002
Here.

1388
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,036
Thank you.

1389
01:15:15,847 --> 01:15:16,836
I'll be right there.

1390
01:15:17,007 --> 01:15:18,122
You did what?

1391
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:21,285
Her car's in the shop,
so I told her to take my truck.

1392
01:15:21,567 --> 01:15:22,841
"Hat are you, nuts?

1393
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:27,399
Since when is Megan so helpless?
She's acting like a little girl.

1394
01:15:27,567 --> 01:15:29,000
If I can't trust Sarina,
then I don't...

1395
01:15:29,167 --> 01:15:32,398
ls not a matter of trusting Sarina.

1396
01:15:32,927 --> 01:15:36,476
Ls a matter of separating
the sheep from the wolf.

1397
01:15:36,887 --> 01:15:39,560
Speaking of wolves, where the hell
is that stupid Jared?

1398
01:15:39,727 --> 01:15:41,683
How come he couldn't drive her
over there?

1399
01:15:42,127 --> 01:15:44,482
He's out of town on business.

1400
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:46,645
But he'll be back on Monday.

1401
01:15:46,847 --> 01:15:49,042
So what happened?
You broke a finger?

1402
01:15:49,207 --> 01:15:51,516
You can't pick up a phone
and call poor Robin here?

1403
01:15:51,687 --> 01:15:54,042
I been puttin' all kinds
of sick ideas in her head.

1404
01:15:55,687 --> 01:15:57,279
I'm sorry.

1405
01:15:57,647 --> 01:15:58,796
One kiss.

1406
01:15:59,567 --> 01:16:00,602
Okay, look.

1407
01:16:00,767 --> 01:16:03,406
"E were driving around all night,
trying to find a stupid vet.

1408
01:16:03,567 --> 01:16:06,843
And then when we did, they had
to pump Mr. Mittens' stomach,

1409
01:16:07,447 --> 01:16:08,880
and then hook him up to an I.V.

1410
01:16:09,047 --> 01:16:11,686
And then we couldn't find
a pay phone.

1411
01:16:12,207 --> 01:16:14,880
- In L.A.?
- No, a pay phone that worked.

1412
01:16:15,047 --> 01:16:18,084
We lost track of time...
I'm sorry, baby.

1413
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:20,682
- How sorry?
- Really sorry.

1414
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:22,161
Really sorry?

1415
01:16:23,447 --> 01:16:25,438
I guess I'm not needed
around here anymore.

1416
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:28,362
I'll just go somewhere else
to be miserable.

1417
01:16:29,527 --> 01:16:30,118
Bye.

1418
01:16:30,287 --> 01:16:31,959
I'm glad you didn't get
your stomach pumped.

1419
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,877
Bye.

1420
01:16:36,087 --> 01:16:37,884
- Bye.
- Bye!

1421
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:48,446
Hello, Vincey, is me, Tara.
Guess what.

1422
01:16:48,847 --> 01:16:51,998
Javi and Buzz just had
a huge fight.

1423
01:16:52,167 --> 01:16:55,284
According to Javi, it was more
dramatic than "Gone With The Wind."

1424
01:16:55,447 --> 01:16:57,563
So, let me tell you exactly
how he told me,

1425
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,321
but you have to swear
not to tell anybody.

1426
01:17:00,487 --> 01:17:03,126
Get ready for this.
Ls gonna be a real shocker.

1427
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:06,836
They are arguing about H-l-V.

1428
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,719
Big surprise, right?

1429
01:17:09,887 --> 01:17:12,481
Buzz pulled another Larry Kramer
with Javi's doctor.

1430
01:17:12,647 --> 01:17:13,477
So Javi's all...

1431
01:17:13,647 --> 01:17:16,366
I won't bet my life on it.
There are too many big brains

1432
01:17:16,607 --> 01:17:18,438
that say that HIV does matter.

1433
01:17:18,607 --> 01:17:19,562
And then Buzz is all...

1434
01:17:19,727 --> 01:17:23,242
I know this shit scares you.

1435
01:17:23,407 --> 01:17:24,920
And thas when Javi goes...

1436
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:26,805
I can't live on that kind of
rollercoaster.

1437
01:17:26,967 --> 01:17:29,800
And they are going back and forth,
back and forth.

1438
01:17:29,967 --> 01:17:31,320
And finally Javi says...

1439
01:17:31,487 --> 01:17:32,886
HIV is killing me!

1440
01:17:33,047 --> 01:17:34,765
Of course,
he's as healthy as a horse.

1441
01:17:34,927 --> 01:17:38,363
He's got more T-cells than
bad outfits and thas a lot.

1442
01:17:38,647 --> 01:17:40,922
But he was pushed over
the edge, poor dear.

1443
01:17:41,087 --> 01:17:45,046
Like Faye Dunaway in "Mommy
Dearest" without the lipstick.

1444
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:46,606
And then not to be outdone,

1445
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:49,998
Buzz is Elizabeth Taylor in
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"

1446
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:52,476
Only his hair was
little bit different.

1447
01:17:52,807 --> 01:17:56,356
You know how Javi loves
being the drama queen.

1448
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,996
So, he's all, "I'm leaving.
Goodbye."

1449
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:02,523
And then Buzz is all, "No, no,
you're not. I'm leaving."

1450
01:18:02,687 --> 01:18:04,962
Of course neither one of them
is going anywhere

1451
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:08,039
because they just thrive
on this kind of interaction.

1452
01:18:08,207 --> 01:18:10,880
But finally Javi does leave.
He storms right out the door.

1453
01:18:11,047 --> 01:18:13,800
- And Buzz says...
- Where you going? Ls your house.

1454
01:18:14,727 --> 01:18:16,797
I do hope they make up because,

1455
01:18:16,967 --> 01:18:18,764
well, they are kind of
cute together.

1456
01:18:19,207 --> 01:18:22,244
Anyhow, take care, honey,
I'll talk to you later.

1457
01:18:33,927 --> 01:18:35,042
You okay?

1458
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:44,956
Ls Buzz.

1459
01:18:46,487 --> 01:18:47,522
Yeah, what about him?

1460
01:18:47,687 --> 01:18:48,756
I left him just now.

1461
01:18:51,847 --> 01:18:52,962
You asked.

1462
01:18:53,847 --> 01:18:56,281
- I didn't say anything.
- You didn't have to.

1463
01:18:57,647 --> 01:18:59,000
I think Buzz is okay.

1464
01:18:59,847 --> 01:19:00,836
What happened?

1465
01:19:01,727 --> 01:19:04,639
I don't want Buzz sticking around
out of sympathy for me.

1466
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:07,916
Well, Buzz seems like
he's really into you.

1467
01:19:08,127 --> 01:19:10,277
And you seem like
you're really into Tara.

1468
01:19:10,927 --> 01:19:13,282
But you're leaving anyway.

1469
01:19:15,527 --> 01:19:17,085
Thas fucked up, isn't it?

1470
01:19:18,447 --> 01:19:19,482
Ahh, yeah...

1471
01:19:20,727 --> 01:19:22,922
but you're gonna pull a Terminator.
You'll be back.

1472
01:19:23,087 --> 01:19:25,476
Yeah, sure, eventually.
Question is will she take me back?

1473
01:19:26,647 --> 01:19:28,285
Thas something I gotta risk.

1474
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,883
Something you should think about
before you fuck up a good thing.

1475
01:19:31,727 --> 01:19:33,445
So she's still not talking
to you, huh?

1476
01:19:35,087 --> 01:19:37,396
- You know how she is.
- Yeah.

1477
01:19:37,567 --> 01:19:38,841
Better watch yourself.

1478
01:19:40,007 --> 01:19:42,475
I think you should do something
to make it up to her.

1479
01:19:42,647 --> 01:19:44,160
I didn't do nothing wrong.

1480
01:19:44,967 --> 01:19:47,640
I've been telling her for months
that I'm going, and now I am.

1481
01:19:49,887 --> 01:19:52,720
Now see, thas the difference
between you and me.

1482
01:19:53,407 --> 01:19:55,045
When I screw something up
with someone...

1483
01:19:55,367 --> 01:19:57,198
I try to make it up to them
in some way.

1484
01:19:57,367 --> 01:19:59,927
You know, like, bake 'em
a good dessert,

1485
01:20:00,407 --> 01:20:02,398
buy some flowers.
You know, something.

1486
01:20:20,407 --> 01:20:22,398
And at that moment,
I knew,

1487
01:20:22,927 --> 01:20:25,964
I knew that that was gonna be
the best fuckin'breakfast ever.

1488
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:30,000
Hi, Vincey, this is Tara.
I know you're still...

1489
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:33,682
workin' through things but I thought
I'd give you the weekly update on

1490
01:20:33,847 --> 01:20:35,519
whas going on.

1491
01:20:35,687 --> 01:20:38,884
You have to swear not to
tell anybody. Of course,

1492
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:41,720
you're not talkin'to anyone,
so who you gonna tell?

1493
01:20:42,327 --> 01:20:45,842
Dwight and Diego, they broke up!
No, I'm just kidding.

1494
01:20:47,247 --> 01:20:49,966
And me and Gus are having
lots and lots of sex.

1495
01:20:50,207 --> 01:20:52,482
Though I don't have to tell you
that because we always do.

1496
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,603
But he's shooting good ones.

1497
01:20:55,207 --> 01:20:56,606
Anyhow, enough about me.

1498
01:20:56,767 --> 01:20:59,918
You're dying to hear about
Megan and Sarina and Robin, so...

1499
01:21:01,367 --> 01:21:04,404
So there I was,
outside of Sarina's,

1500
01:21:04,567 --> 01:21:06,398
dressed in my best Norma Kamali.

1501
01:21:06,567 --> 01:21:09,445
I usually wore a blouse
underneath, but not that night.

1502
01:21:09,607 --> 01:21:12,644
I had on my newest, sexiest bra
which kept slipping down.

1503
01:21:12,807 --> 01:21:15,446
If I was going to be stalk,
I ought to look my best.

1504
01:21:18,767 --> 01:21:19,995
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1505
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:23,397
- Could we talk a minute?
- Sure.

1506
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:26,361
Do I get a hug hello?

1507
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:35,085
You look... good.

1508
01:21:35,447 --> 01:21:37,483
You think so?
I'mjust coming from work, and...

1509
01:21:38,567 --> 01:21:39,556
But you,

1510
01:21:40,407 --> 01:21:41,396
you look great.

1511
01:21:43,687 --> 01:21:44,676
So, whas up?

1512
01:21:46,127 --> 01:21:47,685
Do you think we could go
somewhere to talk?

1513
01:21:48,967 --> 01:21:50,525
No. I can't.

1514
01:21:50,687 --> 01:21:53,645
I'm meeting Robin here in
a few minutes to go out to dinner.

1515
01:21:53,807 --> 01:21:55,923
Right. Of course.
How is she?

1516
01:21:57,207 --> 01:21:58,435
She's fine.

1517
01:21:59,487 --> 01:22:00,556
And the two of you?

1518
01:22:01,447 --> 01:22:02,436
"Ell...

1519
01:22:03,407 --> 01:22:05,796
as you've probably heard,

1520
01:22:06,527 --> 01:22:07,642
Jared and I,

1521
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:09,486
well, it just didn't work out.

1522
01:22:10,567 --> 01:22:12,603
Yeah, I was sorry to hear that.

1523
01:22:15,207 --> 01:22:17,402
So, you know, well,

1524
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:19,683
I was just thinking, I mean,

1525
01:22:20,527 --> 01:22:23,246
I just wanted you to know that,
I think we,

1526
01:22:24,047 --> 01:22:25,275
you and me,

1527
01:22:25,727 --> 01:22:26,955
had some really,

1528
01:22:27,287 --> 01:22:29,482
had something really good.

1529
01:22:29,807 --> 01:22:31,160
And I just wanted to
tell you that,

1530
01:22:31,727 --> 01:22:33,957
because life goes on
and sometimes you don't,

1531
01:22:34,127 --> 01:22:36,925
or I don't say thank you,
when I had something good.

1532
01:22:38,047 --> 01:22:41,164
It was good.
It was a big part of our lives.

1533
01:22:42,847 --> 01:22:44,166
It was, right?

1534
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:46,085
So, any chance of, I mean,

1535
01:22:46,247 --> 01:22:48,522
God, I can't believe I'm coming
right out and saying this,

1536
01:22:49,847 --> 01:22:51,360
but, do you really love Robin?

1537
01:22:51,807 --> 01:22:53,445
Because if not,

1538
01:22:53,607 --> 01:22:56,280
I really think we could still
salvage what,

1539
01:22:56,447 --> 01:22:57,675
maybe something.

1540
01:22:58,127 --> 01:22:59,765
I never stopped loving you, Sari.

1541
01:23:00,087 --> 01:23:03,363
We had our problems. Who doesn't?
We were so good together.

1542
01:23:04,127 --> 01:23:05,242
And my parents...

1543
01:23:06,527 --> 01:23:09,087
think we should buy that house,
like we used to talk about.

1544
01:23:09,247 --> 01:23:11,078
They even want to give us
the down-payment.

1545
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,284
Anyway, I know I'm getting
ahead of myself.

1546
01:23:14,567 --> 01:23:16,683
And I know Robin
is a terrific person,

1547
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:20,321
but honestly,

1548
01:23:20,887 --> 01:23:23,037
Sari, could you ever love her
like you loved me?

1549
01:23:25,247 --> 01:23:26,316
Honestly?

1550
01:23:29,167 --> 01:23:30,282
Honestly.

1551
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:34,723
I never stopped loving you
either, Meg.

1552
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:39,479
But I see now,

1553
01:23:40,127 --> 01:23:43,119
we never had a relationship
kind of love.

1554
01:23:46,607 --> 01:23:48,404
Ls not at all like
what I have with Robin.

1555
01:23:49,807 --> 01:23:52,162
No one can turn heads like you,
Megan. You are beautiful,

1556
01:23:52,887 --> 01:23:55,401
charming, successful, witty.

1557
01:23:56,367 --> 01:23:58,278
All the things we all want to be.

1558
01:23:59,847 --> 01:24:01,439
But it has nothing to do with love.

1559
01:24:04,407 --> 01:24:06,557
"Hen I'm in Robin's arms at night,

1560
01:24:06,847 --> 01:24:08,724
I feel, I feel something

1561
01:24:10,247 --> 01:24:11,999
I never felt with you.

1562
01:24:13,887 --> 01:24:15,878
I can't explain it.
But I feel

1563
01:24:17,447 --> 01:24:19,039
more real and stronger

1564
01:24:19,207 --> 01:24:21,721
than anything I've ever known.

1565
01:24:26,487 --> 01:24:27,715
I know you're going to find

1566
01:24:27,887 --> 01:24:29,240
someone,

1567
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:31,922
because you have so much to offer.

1568
01:24:35,647 --> 01:24:36,841
I have to go now.

1569
01:24:43,327 --> 01:24:44,396
Sarina,

1570
01:24:47,807 --> 01:24:49,081
if it doesn't work out.

1571
01:24:49,607 --> 01:24:51,040
Just remember,
I'm always here for you, okay?

1572
01:25:05,927 --> 01:25:07,042
I love you.

1573
01:25:19,127 --> 01:25:20,799
Fuckin' lesbians.

1574
01:25:30,527 --> 01:25:31,516
Well,

1575
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:34,156
okay,

1576
01:25:34,407 --> 01:25:37,877
Buzz bought me this camera and
suggested I keep a journal

1577
01:25:38,287 --> 01:25:39,845
as a way of expressing

1578
01:25:40,007 --> 01:25:42,077
how I feel about HIV...

1579
01:25:42,567 --> 01:25:43,761
So, so...

1580
01:25:46,367 --> 01:25:47,402
les see...

1581
01:26:00,807 --> 01:26:01,922
Okay,

1582
01:26:03,407 --> 01:26:05,284
thas enough about HIV.

1583
01:26:06,647 --> 01:26:10,640
At home, things have never been
better between Buzz and I.

1584
01:26:11,607 --> 01:26:15,282
Ls scary how we slid from
dating right into domestic bliss.

1585
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:18,641
When I used to dream about
a relationship with someone,

1586
01:26:19,127 --> 01:26:20,719
it was never quite like this.

1587
01:26:27,887 --> 01:26:29,115
And yet,

1588
01:26:29,287 --> 01:26:32,563
now I can't imagine my life with
anyone else or in another way.

1589
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:42,156
Although we try to do something
positive for the community.

1590
01:26:42,567 --> 01:26:44,364
Like Dwight and Diego do.

1591
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:50,727
Well, maybe not exactly
like they do.

1592
01:26:51,887 --> 01:26:54,606
We all went over to Tara's
for Gus's good-bye dinner.

1593
01:26:54,847 --> 01:26:57,077
Megan brought this new boyfriend.

1594
01:26:57,927 --> 01:26:59,679
And, as it turned out,

1595
01:27:00,207 --> 01:27:02,516
Dwight and Diego weren't
mad at anyone.

1596
01:27:02,687 --> 01:27:05,121
They'd gone on some fabulous
gay Christian retreat

1597
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:06,925
to re-evaluate their lives,

1598
01:27:09,247 --> 01:27:10,885
then got really busy with work
when they got back.

1599
01:27:11,047 --> 01:27:13,766
In fact, they were in a hurry
that day I saw them.

1600
01:27:14,087 --> 01:27:16,681
Ls funny how we misinterpret
looks and actions.

1601
01:27:17,247 --> 01:27:18,839
When I did bring up Vincey,

1602
01:27:19,007 --> 01:27:21,316
things got uncomfortable.

1603
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:23,518
But then, Dwight spoke up.

1604
01:27:23,687 --> 01:27:24,961
Guys. Guys.

1605
01:27:26,127 --> 01:27:27,401
Okay, guys.

1606
01:27:28,847 --> 01:27:30,678
Diego and I talked
about this at length,

1607
01:27:30,847 --> 01:27:32,883
and you know we don't like to
force our beliefs onto anyone,

1608
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:35,766
but we were wondering if maybe
it would help the healing process

1609
01:27:35,927 --> 01:27:37,280
for Vincey as well as for us,

1610
01:27:37,447 --> 01:27:39,119
if we all took a moment
and said a prayer.

1611
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:41,198
- Non-denominational, of course.
- For him.

1612
01:27:41,367 --> 01:27:42,686
Now before you say no,

1613
01:27:42,847 --> 01:27:45,645
because we know how this makes
some of you feel uncomfortable,

1614
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:48,321
we just want you to
consider the fact that

1615
01:27:48,647 --> 01:27:51,798
- though we understand his anger...
- We do not condone his actions.

1616
01:27:52,127 --> 01:27:54,516
"E thought this might be a way
to acknowledge what happened...

1617
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,917
- as a group...
- And move on from there.

1618
01:27:57,527 --> 01:27:59,518
So, can we give it a shot?
Maybe?

1619
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:04,087
Nobody could think of a reason
fast enough why we shouldn't,

1620
01:28:05,887 --> 01:28:07,161
but as weird as it was,

1621
01:28:07,767 --> 01:28:10,235
it did offer a sort of closure
to the whole deal.

1622
01:28:10,407 --> 01:28:12,204
Pray God in heaven,

1623
01:28:13,047 --> 01:28:14,526
looking down upon us...

1624
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:17,076
- Great, white bird...
- We'd like to talk about Vincey.

1625
01:28:17,247 --> 01:28:20,045
We want you to take him
under your wing.

1626
01:28:21,767 --> 01:28:23,883
We'd love it.
"Ith all our hearts.

1627
01:28:24,047 --> 01:28:27,005
"Hatever you can do
to keep him safe and dry,

1628
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:29,078
I hope he's wearing shoes.

1629
01:28:29,727 --> 01:28:32,321
Okay, that was great.
Can I open my presents now?

1630
01:28:33,567 --> 01:28:36,400
I think it was
a very lovely prayer-thingy.

1631
01:28:36,727 --> 01:28:38,080
And I think we should all toast

1632
01:28:38,247 --> 01:28:40,044
Dwight and Diego

1633
01:28:40,207 --> 01:28:43,199
because they are not only
fabulously good-Iooking,

1634
01:28:43,607 --> 01:28:45,677
but they're amazingly spiritual
at the same time.

1635
01:29:24,607 --> 01:29:26,279
That night at Tara's

1636
01:29:26,447 --> 01:29:29,245
was the last time I saw my brother
before he went on his trip.

1637
01:29:32,327 --> 01:29:35,080
And then, about six months later,
I'm watching TV.

1638
01:29:35,727 --> 01:29:38,924
Thank you for being on my show
"Fags On Line", Vincent.

1639
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:40,481
Oh, my God.

1640
01:29:40,647 --> 01:29:42,319
- Call me Vincey.
- How could we not know this?

1641
01:29:42,487 --> 01:29:43,806
Everyone else does.

1642
01:29:43,967 --> 01:29:46,959
And you can call me Mar-shaw.
Accent on the "shaw."

1643
01:29:52,127 --> 01:29:55,961
Now, a lot of queers have
criticised your on-line series

1644
01:29:56,967 --> 01:29:59,606
as being too political.
Too preachy.

1645
01:30:00,327 --> 01:30:03,683
As co-creator and head writer,
how do you respond to this?

1646
01:30:04,087 --> 01:30:06,920
I can take that criticism.
I'm a big man.

1647
01:30:07,087 --> 01:30:08,156
I go to the gym.

1648
01:30:11,047 --> 01:30:12,639
- Hello?
- Turn on channel 3 right now!

1649
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:14,559
- What?
- Channel 3! Right now!

1650
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:20,040
To give that new prospective...

1651
01:30:22,647 --> 01:30:23,921
Oh my God!

1652
01:30:24,567 --> 01:30:26,444
...we did a story line
about the gay-basher

1653
01:30:26,807 --> 01:30:29,367
who winds up getting raped

1654
01:30:30,367 --> 01:30:32,198
and beaten by his intended victim.

1655
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:35,002
- I gotta call Diego and Dwight.
- Okay, bye.

1656
01:30:35,247 --> 01:30:38,444
And you really have to wonder
why politicians get upset...

1657
01:30:38,687 --> 01:30:41,076
- Turn it up.
- When all that gay people want

1658
01:30:41,247 --> 01:30:44,637
are the same rights as
everybody else, not special ones.

1659
01:30:44,807 --> 01:30:45,683
Yes, we're watching it.

1660
01:30:46,047 --> 01:30:48,561
I think that we're all brought up
with such stupid

1661
01:30:48,727 --> 01:30:51,002
- myths about sex and love.
- Megan just called us.

1662
01:30:51,167 --> 01:30:54,477
- We were about to call you.
- These lies cause a ton of damage.

1663
01:30:54,647 --> 01:30:56,842
Some people are meant to be
in relationships,

1664
01:30:57,007 --> 01:31:00,158
some are meant to be single.
Ls not a big deal.

1665
01:31:00,327 --> 01:31:02,966
So now, what about you?
Where do you fit into all this?

1666
01:31:03,127 --> 01:31:04,799
Relationship?
Not relationship?

1667
01:31:04,967 --> 01:31:06,764
Love's a tricky thing, Marcia.

1668
01:31:07,967 --> 01:31:09,002
Ls like, no one knows

1669
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:11,158
when or even if is ever
gonna show up.

1670
01:31:11,327 --> 01:31:13,397
- Amen.
- But I tell you what.

1671
01:31:13,727 --> 01:31:15,479
I think that I'm finally
at a time in my life.

1672
01:31:15,727 --> 01:31:16,955
- You go boy.
- Lf it does come my way,

1673
01:31:17,327 --> 01:31:18,965
I'll be able to recognise it.

1674
01:31:19,247 --> 01:31:23,240
3 years ago, I never woulïvee
dreamed I'd sit at my computer

1675
01:31:23,607 --> 01:31:24,801
writing stories

1676
01:31:24,967 --> 01:31:28,004
and sending them over the phone
lines into other people's houses.

1677
01:31:28,367 --> 01:31:32,280
So maybe love now will look
differently.

1678
01:31:32,447 --> 01:31:33,641
Who knows?

1679
01:31:34,567 --> 01:31:36,717
How enlightened
Shaka Buto of you.

1680
01:31:36,887 --> 01:31:38,445
- That is so clear.
- Shaka Buto?

1681
01:31:38,607 --> 01:31:40,484
Vincent,
you've just been a pleasure.

1682
01:31:40,647 --> 01:31:41,921
God bless cable.

1683
01:31:42,087 --> 01:31:43,725
Thanks for being on "Fags On Line."

1684
01:31:43,967 --> 01:31:45,320
We'll see you all later.

1685
01:31:47,607 --> 01:31:50,201
As dramatic as I know I am,
I promised myself

1686
01:31:50,567 --> 01:31:53,400
I wasn't going to make a
big deal about this baby.

1687
01:31:53,607 --> 01:31:55,882
In fact, I haven't even
told Gus about it. Not yet.

1688
01:31:56,207 --> 01:31:58,038
I'm gonna wait until
after the baby is born.

1689
01:31:58,207 --> 01:32:00,846
Even then, is gotta be
handled very carefully.

1690
01:32:01,007 --> 01:32:04,761
I don't it to seem like a
desperate ploy to lure him back.

1691
01:32:06,047 --> 01:32:07,685
I'm gonna wait until later.

1692
01:32:07,847 --> 01:32:11,283
I haven't told my mother, brother
or anybody yet.

1693
01:32:11,447 --> 01:32:14,245
I'm gonna wait until
after the baby's born.

1694
01:32:15,527 --> 01:32:18,599
'Cause I know how
people in general

1695
01:32:18,927 --> 01:32:21,521
have a much easier time lovin'
cute little babies

1696
01:32:21,687 --> 01:32:23,996
than they do lovin'
unwed pregnant women.

1697
01:32:24,647 --> 01:32:25,921
So we're just gonna wait.

1698
01:32:26,287 --> 01:32:28,676
But in the meantime,
I'vee had all my tests.

1699
01:32:28,847 --> 01:32:31,645
I've had my ultrasound test,
my APPtest,

1700
01:32:32,007 --> 01:32:35,238
my blood test, my urine test.
All the tests.

1701
01:32:35,407 --> 01:32:36,999
I've had them all and
everything's normal.

1702
01:32:38,287 --> 01:32:41,359
So there's really nothin'
extraordinary about this baby.

1703
01:32:41,527 --> 01:32:43,199
EXcept that, is mine.

1704
01:32:43,607 --> 01:32:44,801
Ls my baby.

1705
01:32:44,967 --> 01:32:47,322
And this baby's gonna have
all the love in the world.

1706
01:33:02,607 --> 01:33:04,962
Isn't it rude when people don't
return other people's calls?

1707
01:33:05,927 --> 01:33:08,885
Don't you think is rude
to sneak up on me like that?

1708
01:33:09,047 --> 01:33:12,005
I almost killed you, you moron.
Yeah, is a gun.

1709
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:13,998
- Ls loaded.
- My God.

1710
01:33:14,167 --> 01:33:16,158
Not that I'm not happy to see you.

1711
01:33:17,327 --> 01:33:18,362
Hey, baby.

1712
01:33:18,527 --> 01:33:21,166
How come you didn't tell me
you were gonna be on TV?

1713
01:33:21,327 --> 01:33:23,124
'Cause I didn't think
public access counted.

1714
01:33:24,007 --> 01:33:26,567
You're Mr. Big Shot now,
are you?

1715
01:33:27,087 --> 01:33:29,442
No, I've been working hard on this.
I'm flying to New York tonight.

1716
01:33:29,607 --> 01:33:32,280
The backers are excited. They can't
believe is going so well.

1717
01:33:32,447 --> 01:33:34,483
- Backers? You have backers?
- Yeah.

1718
01:33:34,647 --> 01:33:37,161
"The backers can't believe
is going so well."

1719
01:33:37,327 --> 01:33:40,160
"I'm leaving for New York."
"Public Access doesn't count."

1720
01:33:40,327 --> 01:33:43,160
What about your friends?
We're going to miss you.

1721
01:33:43,327 --> 01:33:45,522
- Have you talked to anyone else?
- No, not yet.

1722
01:33:45,687 --> 01:33:47,678
- Why not?
- Well, when I come back...

1723
01:33:48,247 --> 01:33:50,044
I just wanted to see you
before I left.

1724
01:33:51,567 --> 01:33:52,716
Oh, sweety.

1725
01:33:54,207 --> 01:33:57,119
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

1726
01:33:59,447 --> 01:34:02,120
He wanted to see
how huge I'd gotten.

1727
01:34:04,367 --> 01:34:07,006
- Tara, are you all right?
- Yeah. No, I'm okay.

1728
01:34:07,847 --> 01:34:09,565
I'm fine.
I'm...

1729
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:10,876
just tired.

1730
01:34:11,967 --> 01:34:13,082
You look pale.

1731
01:34:14,247 --> 01:34:16,522
- Ok, where does it hurt.
- Somethin' s wrong.

1732
01:34:18,247 --> 01:34:20,203
Take a deep breath now.
Take a deep breath.

1733
01:34:20,407 --> 01:34:23,319
Everything's fine. Because we're
all here and thas a good thing.

1734
01:34:23,967 --> 01:34:25,958
- Oh God!
- No, I'm gonna go get my truck!

1735
01:34:26,407 --> 01:34:27,681
Oh, no... my water broke!

1736
01:34:27,847 --> 01:34:29,246
I'll call the hospital.

1737
01:34:30,807 --> 01:34:31,796
"E'll help you up.

1738
01:34:31,967 --> 01:34:33,036
I'm gonna pack.

1739
01:34:33,407 --> 01:34:35,523
Ls only seven months.

1740
01:34:35,807 --> 01:34:38,844
So he's early? It just means
he's not gay. We'll still love him.

1741
01:34:43,367 --> 01:34:44,846
Hold on, little baby.
"E're almost there.

1742
01:34:47,367 --> 01:34:49,756
Somethin's wrong.
Somethin's wrong.

1743
01:34:49,927 --> 01:34:51,758
No, no. You're going to be fine.

1744
01:34:52,287 --> 01:34:54,357
Healthy premature babies
are born every day. All right?

1745
01:34:55,007 --> 01:34:57,316
- You change your mind about Gus?
- No, don't tell him.

1746
01:34:57,487 --> 01:35:00,524
- He should be here for you, Tar.
- No, I'll tell him.

1747
01:35:29,007 --> 01:35:30,520
I lost the baby.

1748
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:32,805
I lost the baby.

1749
01:35:34,767 --> 01:35:36,644
Thas what they told me.

1750
01:35:37,927 --> 01:35:39,883
Like it was an umbrella

1751
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:43,320
or a ball game or somethin'.

1752
01:35:46,047 --> 01:35:49,756
I didn't allow the doctors
to put me under.

1753
01:35:50,007 --> 01:35:51,884
I was gonna do everythin'
within my power

1754
01:35:52,047 --> 01:35:54,436
to make sure this child lived.

1755
01:35:56,327 --> 01:35:58,443
But his lungs

1756
01:36:00,047 --> 01:36:02,197
just weren't fully developed yet.

1757
01:36:03,767 --> 01:36:06,884
There was nothin'in the tests
that coulïvee told us that.

1758
01:36:07,047 --> 01:36:10,357
It was just, you know,
one of those things.

1759
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:17,400
The doctors all said
that they were surprised

1760
01:36:17,567 --> 01:36:20,081
the pregnancy lasted
as long as it had.

1761
01:36:24,167 --> 01:36:25,805
They let me hold him,

1762
01:36:26,967 --> 01:36:28,764
my little son.

1763
01:36:30,047 --> 01:36:32,083
He was really tiny!

1764
01:36:33,527 --> 01:36:36,166
And when I was holding him,

1765
01:36:36,767 --> 01:36:40,077
he gasped like a tiny whimper.

1766
01:36:43,967 --> 01:36:46,561
I heard a nurse in the hall say

1767
01:36:47,047 --> 01:36:49,641
that was nature's way of
weeding out the weak.

1768
01:36:50,047 --> 01:36:51,639
That it was Goïs will.

1769
01:36:53,087 --> 01:36:57,444
I wished I had one ounce
of strength left in my body

1770
01:36:57,967 --> 01:37:00,765
so I could get out of bed,
slap that nurse silly,

1771
01:37:00,927 --> 01:37:03,361
and tell her it was Goïs will.

1772
01:37:32,367 --> 01:37:33,800
Look who's here.

1773
01:39:23,007 --> 01:39:26,556
I was in New York when I got the
call about the memorial service.

1774
01:39:27,287 --> 01:39:29,437
I took the next flight home.

1775
01:39:31,847 --> 01:39:34,281
When those ashes flew back
into our faces,

1776
01:39:34,447 --> 01:39:36,836
I was certain it meant something,

1777
01:39:37,007 --> 01:39:39,885
but just what, I still haven't
figured out yet.

1778
01:39:42,327 --> 01:39:44,761
And so our lives go on.

1779
01:39:45,207 --> 01:39:47,926
Although I know they can never

1780
01:39:48,087 --> 01:39:49,884
be exactly the same.

1781
01:39:50,047 --> 01:39:51,844
Javi still has HIV.

1782
01:39:52,687 --> 01:39:55,042
I still... did what I did.

1783
01:39:56,087 --> 01:39:58,396
And Tara and Gus still
lost the baby.

1784
01:39:59,487 --> 01:40:02,285
But just thinking about
that baby's life

1785
01:40:02,447 --> 01:40:04,438
and how it never even got started,

1786
01:40:04,607 --> 01:40:06,120
the strangest thought
occurred to me.

1787
01:40:06,447 --> 01:40:09,484
I thought about how
that life began with sex,

1788
01:40:10,007 --> 01:40:12,601
and how sex
sometimes leads to life,

1789
01:40:12,767 --> 01:40:15,440
sometimes to death,
sometimes to love.

1790
01:40:15,607 --> 01:40:17,484
And then I thought
about my friends.

1791
01:40:18,487 --> 01:40:21,957
'Cause every day,
people are born and people die.

1792
01:40:22,407 --> 01:40:25,365
And in between we find ridiculous
and important things

1793
01:40:25,527 --> 01:40:27,483
to keep us busy.

1794
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:29,399
Like love and sex,

1795
01:40:30,087 --> 01:40:32,647
although not necessarily
in that order.

1796
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:36,603
Those people who can find them
both with the same person

1797
01:40:36,767 --> 01:40:39,042
should count ourselves among
the lucky ones.

1798
01:40:39,567 --> 01:40:42,127
As for the others,
like me,

1799
01:40:43,447 --> 01:40:46,041
I've got plenty of love.
I'vee got my friends.

1800
01:40:46,247 --> 01:40:47,726
And you know what?

1801
01:40:48,047 --> 01:40:49,958
That is something to cherish

1802
01:40:50,167 --> 01:40:52,203
in this amazingly brutal,

1803
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:56,476
crazy, but totally
wonderful world.
