1
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,429
My name is Nash Olsen.

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,804
I am a PMC... a private
military contractor.

3
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,770
At least, that's what
they call us now.

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,272
People used to call us mercenaries,

5
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,567
guns for hire, soldiers of fortune.

6
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,319
Whatever they call us,

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,322
the job always stays the same.

8
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:34,325
When shit really hits the fan

9
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:37,662
and the military can't touch it,

10
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,456
they give us a call.

11
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,917
The commando team of four,

12
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,253
been together for about eight years

13
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,339
with dozens of missions
all over the world,

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,341
never lost a man.

15
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,927
We live and die by our motto...

16
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,721
no one left behind.

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,308
These words are really
important to us.

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,103
Just like any soldiers,

19
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,147
we know the risk of each mission.

20
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,067
But we also know and
trust each other

21
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,771
with our lives every single day.

22
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,157
That is until the day you wake up

23
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,285
and you realize

24
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,913
that you are in way over your head

25
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,537
and there is no one who can help.

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,253
This is our story.

27
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,016
Have a seat, Nash.

28
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,352
Let's get down to business.

29
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,939
I'd like to introduce
you to Mohamed Asan,

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,144
or T3, as the boys in DC call him.

31
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,280
Number three on the
Al-Qaeda most-wanted list.

32
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,575
Very well-trained,
very difficult to track.

33
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,161
CIA's been following
this guy for two years.

34
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,871
Every time they think
they have him...

35
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,081
poof, he just disappears.

36
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,626
The man's a fucking ghost.

37
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:10,880
He travels in small groups, often with
women and children to avoid air strikes.

38
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,008
We've currently got intel that
he's leading a small force

39
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,637
operating out of the lower
quadrant of Sector 4.

40
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,681
Sector 4, sir?

41
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,020
Why?

42
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,438
That a problem?

43
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,149
It's a mess down there, sir.
It's the red zone.

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,069
That's why they called us.

45
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,070
When do we leave?

46
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:38,199
ASAP. Get your team together.

47
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,902
Copy that.

48
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,214
Commander Reynolds on deck.

49
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,520
Confirming two souls on
board, dark-colored pickup,

50
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,355
traveling west-bound
towards village.

51
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,729
Keep your eyes on the target.

52
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,163
Do we have confirmation
Tango 3 is in the vehicle?

53
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,366
It's now confirmed
Tango 3 is on board.

54
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,890
We have visual on the target.

55
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,844
- Scramble the jets.
- Sir.

56
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,358
Countdown 55, space checker
at transponder setting

57
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,403
03 Alpha, 4750.

58
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,546
All right, target one

59
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,257
by the entrance.

60
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,718
- Three plus...
- I'm picking up a signal.

61
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,095
It looks like we've got some
friendlies in Sector 4.

62
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,640
Sector 4? We don't have
anybody in Sector 4.

63
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,060
We have guys over in Sector 5.
4 should be clear.

64
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,973
All right, what do you have for me?

65
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,108
Target one,

66
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,903
by the entrance.

67
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,531
Three plus down.

68
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,530
Target one.

69
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,661
Three plus down.

70
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,081
I am showing something
from that area, sir.

71
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,172
Those are our GPS signals.

72
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,508
A team of four?

73
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,758
- All right, let me contact I-Corps.
- Sir.

74
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:54,436
All right then. Wind,
three knots east-west.

75
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,772
The wind...

76
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,101
three knots east-west.

77
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,441
There's no way we could be
positive it's our guys.

78
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,452
All right, and target two...

79
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:15,284
four feet left to target one.

80
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,043
Target two acquired.

81
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,337
We have degree coordinates
on that target.

82
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,173
Confirming the grid, 68-niner 517.

83
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,634
This could be Al-Qaeda
trying to throw us off.

84
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,634
Understood, sir.
Proceeding with the strike.

85
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,230
All right, boss,
ready fur your call.

86
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,603
Fire.

87
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,211
We've got heavy contact!

88
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,974
Shit!

89
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,677
Ahh!

90
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,482
Oh shit! What was that?!

91
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,684
Air strike!

92
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,031
What the fuck was that?

93
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,200
Where the hell did all
these people come from?

94
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,873
- I'm on red! Cover me, Scott!
- I got it, I got it!

95
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,711
On the ground! I'm green. Clear!

96
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,755
- Ah!
- Copy that!

97
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:48,051
- Cover me!
- Watch out!

98
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,303
Ah!

99
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,757
- Move into the cave!
- Go! Moving!

100
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,935
Go!

101
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,568
Go, let's get to the cave!

102
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,771
Roger that! Moving.

103
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,283
Let's go.

104
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,328
- Shit! Ahhh!
- Shit.

105
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,623
- We've got one man down!
- Nash, I'm hit.

106
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,250
- Nash, Nash...
- I got you, I got you.

107
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,204
Okay! Ahh!

108
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,842
Oh, shit!

109
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,590
Son of a...

110
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,596
- Put pressure.
- Shit!

111
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,141
I got you.

112
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,638
- Put pressure on that!
- Yeah, I can make it. Yeah.

113
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,152
We got heavy contact! Green 745.

114
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,902
- All right, let's go! Move move move!
- My leg!

115
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,625
Oh, Nash!

116
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,335
What the fuck was that?

117
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,962
Fuck Al-Qaeda.

118
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,631
Guys, what's your status?

119
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,089
What's your status?

120
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,129
I got contact left!

121
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,799
Contact right, contact right!

122
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,268
Allahu akbar!

123
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,482
They're everywhere!

124
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,481
Nash, what's your location?

125
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,579
Steve, what's your location?

126
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,991
What's your location?

127
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,338
Hold on, I'm coming for you.

128
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,311
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

129
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,480
No running in the house.

130
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,780
I like what you did with the house.

131
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,532
Thanks! I know I shouldn't

132
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,367
spend the money, but I get lonely.

133
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,369
He's gone for months at a time.

134
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,955
I have to find some way to
keep myself from going crazy.

135
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,249
Think you're going crazy?

136
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,377
It's been over three
months since Scott left.

137
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,463
That's how long it's
been since I've had sex.

138
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,466
Try living in the same house
as your ex-husband and his son

139
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,469
- and see how great your sex life is.
- Oh, no way.

140
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,182
I don't know. After
this mission's over,

141
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,559
I only want three things...

142
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,479
peace, love...

143
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,023
and sex.

144
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,234
Yeah, I want more sex.

145
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,945
- Pizza pizza!
- This is so good, guys.

146
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,069
Thanks, Mom!

147
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,164
It's 20 individuals.

148
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,959
Roger tally. Right door.

149
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,624
American.

150
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,853
clear, anytime, come
in on that road.

151
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,056
I got individuals everywhere.

152
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,526
Alpha 4, we've got confirmation

153
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,105
of friendly in the area, running
north away from the village.

154
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,235
I love you, Dad.

155
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,585
Your son needs you.

156
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,847
Keep eyes on target.

157
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,100
Roger. What's your location.

158
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,977
Charlie 5, Charlie 6 has gut bingo.

159
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,814
Charlie 1 through
6, return to base.

160
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,984
7-India-53, one length to location.

161
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,984
You have the call.
They're on their way, sir.

162
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,739
All right, let's pump him up.

163
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,307
I have an update on
Operation Mikaela, sir.

164
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,017
- Let's have it!
- The enemy focused

165
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,227
most of their strength on
this area during the attack.

166
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,021
Much higher numbers
than we anticipated.

167
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,439
Okay, what about the target?

168
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,566
Unfortunately, the
target escaped, sir.

169
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,359
What's the status
of the contractors?

170
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,486
We received a friendly
GPS signal in the area.

171
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,488
We had no way of knowing
it was the contractors,

172
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,575
so we proceeded with the air strike.
We lost all of them but one.

173
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,536
- What the fuck just happened?!
- I just heard it myself.

174
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,121
I don't know all the details yet.

175
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,332
The details are simple...
you're in charge

176
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,916
of the private fucking contractors,

177
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,877
and they got in the
middle of a fire zone

178
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,462
when we launched an air strike!

179
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,172
We may have just
killed our own men.

180
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,257
It'll be taken care of.

181
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,085
Son of a bitch.

182
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,519
I'm hit!

183
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,518
Nash, I'm hit!

184
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,808
A knock would be more appropriate,

185
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,307
if you don't mind.

186
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,818
Roger that.

187
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,069
Where's Max?

188
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,529
He's out back playing.

189
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,657
You know, he asks about you a lot.

190
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,035
I'm running out of excuses.

191
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:50,081
When are you going to stop
blaming yourself for the past

192
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,081
and start being a better
father to your son?

193
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,251
It's not too late
for that, you know?

194
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,504
I'm working on it, okay?

195
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,350
Dad!

196
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,495
- Dad?
- Buddy?

197
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,498
Do you know that the Grand
Canyon's over 6,000 feet deep,

198
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,541
and over 20 football fields

199
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,002
and 277 miles long?

200
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,754
No, I didn't know that.

201
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,673
- You didn't?
- No.

202
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,511
But you said we can go to
the Grand Canyon one day.

203
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,262
You know what?

204
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,307
I know I promised you we'd
go to the Grand Canyon.

205
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,560
You know? But I'm telling you...

206
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,938
I promise, okay?

207
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,561
Okay.

208
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,650
Oh, I love you, buddy. Come here.

209
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,571
I love you, Dad.

210
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,580
You have a phone call, boss.

211
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,249
Thank you, Jacob.

212
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,751
Nash?

213
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,671
Sir, I just received an
email, I don't know from who.

214
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,840
It's a video, sir.

215
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,836
Excuse me?

216
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,556
They're alive, sir.

217
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,600
I see.

218
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,520
And what exactly would you
like us to do about it?

219
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,356
We need to get them out, sir.
We don't have much time.

220
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,857
Mikaela was classified.

221
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,692
There's no way we can go back now.

222
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,861
Sir, you're telling me you
know my men are alive

223
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,073
and you're not going to do
anything about it, right?

224
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,201
You know what you're getting into
every time you accept a mission.

225
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,911
That's the life you chose.

226
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,455
That's why you're making
the big bucks, pal.

227
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,960
No one gets left behind, sir.

228
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,212
You're not soldiers,
you're mercenaries.

229
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,131
No one cares about a
team of hired guns

230
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,550
getting stuck behind enemy lines.

231
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,635
You know what?

232
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,887
The more I think back
to that mission...

233
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,056
the air strikes,

234
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,476
the men that were not
supposed to be there...

235
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:29,230
the more I think you're
covering up something, sir.

236
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,809
I'm sorry, Nash. There's
nothing I can do.

237
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,655
He going back.

238
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,036
This is Aisha Nasser,

239
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,415
reporting live from the
Afghanistan/Pakistan border,

240
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,084
a region now referred
to as Sector 4.

241
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,837
It is believed that many of
the top Al-Qaeda leaders

242
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,839
are operating out of this area.

243
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,009
Recently, the government deemed
Sector 4 to be a red zone...

244
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,180
an area too unsafe to orchestrate
ground assaults by US troops,

245
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,432
making many of the
top Al-Qaeda leaders

246
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:07,185
seemingly untouchable
by the US troops.

247
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:11,562
This is Aisha Nasser reporting
live from Sector 4. Back to you.

248
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,716
Come on!

249
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,252
Come on!

250
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,891
Come on!

251
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,811
Do it!

252
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,188
Do it, you fucking pig!

253
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,187
Do it!

254
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,363
Chickenshit! Fuck!

255
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,575
You don't have the guts! Come on!

256
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,746
Come on! Gaaaah!

257
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,101
What the fuck are you looking at?

258
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,813
Are you all right?

259
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,565
- Buddy.
- Come on.

260
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,268
You doin' all right?

261
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,328
I can't take this anymore.

262
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,740
We're getting out of here.

263
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,493
We're not going to get out of here.

264
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,961
Yeah.

265
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,210
We're gonna wait.

266
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,134
I'm done waiting.

267
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,803
Nash will be here.

268
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,506
You'll see.

269
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,767
You know, in the war days...

270
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,820
I was in the same situation.

271
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,155
I lost some...

272
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,324
I lost some of my nearest friends.

273
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,495
They were left behind,
but I was told to stand down.

274
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,498
I did.

275
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,418
Not a day goes by I don't
think about those faces

276
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,168
or see them.

277
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,340
If you're going to go
to one of the craziest

278
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,552
parts of the world...
the most dangerous...

279
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,138
you're going to have
to fight the people,

280
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,056
the elements, the weather,

281
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,975
the desert,

282
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,269
the snow, skydive...

283
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,938
by yourself.

284
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,110
You need to get mentally strong

285
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,734
so you can survive
and see your kid.

286
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,410
Make sure you say
good night to him.

287
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,838
Let's do it.

288
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,349
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

289
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,678
How do you suppose we're gonna
get the fuck out of here?

290
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,566
We've been a team for
how long? How long?

291
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,776
Our wives hang out together...

292
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,737
we're a team.

293
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,072
Yeah, he's not going to
leave anybody behind.

294
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,117
I feel pretty fucking abandoned.

295
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,746
Been, what? 70-some
fuckin' days in here?

296
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,081
Ain't no one coming for us.

297
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,584
He's gonna come for us.

298
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,336
He's gonna be here.

299
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,463
Just trust him.

300
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,258
Trust him... he'll be here.

301
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,641
Dude, that's gonna get you killed.

302
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,476
We're gonna get killed anyway.

303
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:44,313
At least this is
going to be my way.

304
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,690
My kids are not going
to watch their dad

305
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,776
have his head cut off

306
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,275
and watch it on TV.

307
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,036
Nash will be here.

308
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,872
He'll be here. You'll see.

309
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,334
He'll be here.

310
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,629
You just gotta stand down

311
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,832
and be a little stronger.

312
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,576
He'll be back.

313
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,512
You're going back, aren't you?

314
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,008
Yep.

315
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,525
You know,

316
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,855
I actually thought this time
was going to be different.

317
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,741
For the first time I believed

318
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,368
that you were going
to change things

319
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,371
and be a better father to Max.

320
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,874
I can't leave them behind.

321
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,543
What about Max?

322
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,042
You're leaving him behind.

323
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,344
All this week he's been
talking about the trip

324
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,219
that you two were supposed
to take to the Grand Canyon.

325
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,432
That should be your priority.

326
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,774
Jesus, Nash.

327
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,529
I know you could care less
what happened between us.

328
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,233
Lord knows I'm over it.

329
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,288
I really love those guys too.

330
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,957
But a real man,

331
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:13,128
a good father, knows
when to turn his back

332
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,256
and let somebody else
take care of the problem.

333
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,092
There is nobody else.

334
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,760
You're just trying to play hero

335
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,762
so you can feel better
about yourself.

336
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,555
Meanwhile I'm taking care of Max,

337
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,009
not knowing if you're coming back.

338
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,268
Which is why I divorced you.

339
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,275
We live in the same house,

340
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,529
and I am okay with that,

341
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,654
but don't go out and
get yourself killed.

342
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,204
Your son needs you

343
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,331
more than anyone.

344
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,785
I promise I'll be back.

345
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,497
I promise.

346
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,642
"Dear Max,

347
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,353
I want you to remember
how much I love you.

348
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,022
I promise that when I return

349
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,732
we'll go to the Grand Canyon

350
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,777
and visit all the places
that you can imagine.

351
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,904
I miss you already

352
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,406
and I love you.

353
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,951
Love, Dad."

354
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,719
Shalom.

355
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,430
- You ready?
- Shalom.

356
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,225
You know I can't teach
you how to fight.

357
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,602
But I can teach you how to survive

358
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,396
so you can come back.

359
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,565
Let's go.

360
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,107
- Hello?
- Hey, Kristoff.

361
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,276
This is Charlie.
How you doin', man?

362
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,195
Charlie!

363
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,364
Oh, my friend. How are you?

364
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,868
Very very very busy. Very busy.

365
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,870
Haven't spoke to you in ages.

366
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:23,165
Last time I heard you
were dead. Mm-hmm.

367
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,958
Sorry, buddy, I'm not dead yet.

368
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,670
Listen, I'm gonna go on a
little vacation pretty soon.

369
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,632
- I'm gonna need a couple things.
- Vacation, huh?

370
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,758
Are you going to visit your old
friends from last trip, hmm?

371
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,973
How do you know about that?

372
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,726
Facebook! What do you think?

373
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,812
So when are you planning
this trip of yours?

374
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,981
Very soon.

375
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,817
No problem, no problem.

376
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,194
Anything you want.

377
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,987
Make sure you take
care of me, okay?

378
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,490
Not like last time, okay?
Don't screw it up.

379
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,659
Charlie, come on, really?

380
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,328
Of course, no no.

381
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,163
Make sure you say hi to the wives.

382
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,999
I am honest Russian man.

383
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,334
Yes, boy.

384
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,003
Yak yak yak yak!

385
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,006
All right, just take
care of me, all right?

386
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,008
No problem, no problem.

387
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,635
All right, thanks,
I appreciate that.

388
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:17,844
All right, see you soon, okay?

389
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,388
Bye, ciao.

390
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,648

425
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,702
Spasibo.

426
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,507
So you want to buy
some firearms, right?

427
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,843
I have amazing guns
for you, my friend.

428
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,972
Love Americans so much,
especially your money.

429
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,599
So, um, you ready?

00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,318
Mwah! Yeah.

434
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,405
Brand-new weapon.
Very good in combat.

435
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,408
Quite pricey, though.
Very expensive model.

436
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,994
What about that one?
How much for that one?

437
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:24,497
Oh, my friend, that one.

438
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:28,043
This one... a very good gun.

439
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,299
I'll cut you amazing deal...
500 Americans.

440
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,677
Great price for amazing gun.

441
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,053
Hmm!

442
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,639
What about I give you
$200 for the rifle,

443
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,350
I give you $200 for the handgun

444
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:48,021
and $100 for the...
for the ammo? How's that?

445
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,898
- Mmm.
- Good?

446
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,192
You son of a bitch, my friend.

447
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:57,071
I'll cut your throat
when you sleep.

448
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,650
Ahhh!

449
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,161
Sounds good!

450
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:05,204
- We got a deal?
- We got a deal.

451
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,040
All right.

452
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,375
Euros or pound sterling?

453
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,544
Hmm?

454
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,421
Do you take credit cards?

455
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,965
Credit cards? Are you kidding me?

456
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,718
Credit cards! You most secret

457
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,387

want credit cards?

458
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,556
Cash, my friend. Only cash.

459
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:31,939
Military caches are buried
all along this area.

460
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,067
Come here, come here,
I'll show you.

461
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:35,943
There's numbers.

462
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,904
Mm-hmm-hmm.

463
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:41,783

464
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,910
and you can get whatever
you want there.

465
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,788
So many explosives... wow.

466
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,866
That's for you.

467
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:53,628
How do I get there though?
I need a car, so...

468
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,380
Ah.

469
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,507
Oh boy, I have no cars.

470
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:01,427
No... no cars. No no no.

471
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:06,432

473
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,105
He has amazing cars. So good cars.

00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,305
- Sure.
- My best friend!

489
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,383
My best friend.

490
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,223
English.

491
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:13,226
My cousins do nut speak English.

492
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,186
But I do.

493
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,063
They never let me
hang out with them

494
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,856
when they're doing their business.

495
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,650
They say I'm too young.

496
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:25,404
But they let me come today because
I learn English in school.

497
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,406
Hmm.

498
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,075
How nice of them.

499
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,789
So, listen, I have a long drive.

500
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,958
Do you think this car
is going to take me

501
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,457
to where I want to go?

502
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:48,094
He says it works like clockwork.

503
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,389
Hmm! Okay.

504
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,070
Clockwork?

505
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,081
Yes, clockwork.

506
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,417
Good.

507
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,792
Listen, Kristoff told me $200.

508
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,980
He says, uh...

509
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,809
they want to know how much
you have in your wallet.

510
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,445
How much I have in my wallet?

511
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,740
Yes.

512
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:54,866
Oh boy, I guess a
deal is not a deal.

513
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,874
The man who sent you... Kristoff...

514
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:03,836
they tell me he owes
them a lot of money.

515
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,130
Since you're his friend,

516
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,757
they want to take it from you.

517
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,300
Hmm.

518
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:12,095
Well, first of all
I'm not his friend.

519
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,266
And secondly,

520
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:21,142
I just have $200.

521
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,870
They have little time.

522
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,247
Huh.

523
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,916
Yup.

524
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,998
Opa! America...

525
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:54,839
Whoa whoa...

526
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,694
Check the safety, asshole.

527
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:10,987
Get in the car.

528
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,822
Get in the car!

529
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:15,025
Get the fuck out of
here, you bitch.

530
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,401
Allahu akbar!

531
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,165
Salaam alaikum.

532
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,000
This is Aisha Nasser,
reporting live

533
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,086
from the Afghanistan
Pakistan border.

534
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,171
Information regarding
the recent attack

535
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,756
on the Afghanistan Pakistan border

536
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,674
has just been released
earlier today.

537
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,676
It is believed that
following the attack,

538
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,845
three private US
military contractors

539
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,306
have been held hostage
by an Al-Qaeda group

540
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,392
operating in the area
led by Mohamed Asan,

541
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,895
number three on the
most-wanted list.

542
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,147
No demands have been
issued at this time.

543
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,317
This marks the fourth instance
in which several contractors

544
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,070
have been involved in the
red-zone area in Afghanistan.

545
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:19,865
Previous instances left
several contractors dead.

546
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,364
Reporting back to you.

547
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,194
I have some intel for
you regarding Sector 4.

548
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,612
About your captive men?

549
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,238
Nut exactly.

550
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,116
It's about the one that
got out. He's going back.

551
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,410
After what happened
with that last mission,

552
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,454
you're going to send someone back?

553
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,247
And on government funds, no less?

554
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:40,292
No, we didn't orchestrate this
at all. He's doing it on his own.

555
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,252
And why would he do that?

556
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:45,339
Yeah, "no one left behind."
I think that's the phrase he used.

557
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:48,133
A mercenary that
gives a fuck. Great.

558
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,719
If your intel on bin
Laden is correct,

559
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,846
you may be privy to his location.

560
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,681
So what are you telling me for?

561
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,309
I'm just waiting for the right
moment to strike... a diversion,

562
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,312
a hole in their security.
Oh, I can personally guarantee

563
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,231
that once Nash is in the area,

564
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,233
a real shitstorm is going to start.

565
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:07,820
I want you to keep me informed
on every move Nash makes...

566
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:10,155
every move he makes,
you keep me posted.

567
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,983
Understood.

568
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,381
Don't move.

569
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,960
Shit.

570
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,052
Whoa whoa whoa,
don't think about it.

571
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,060
Whoa whoa, okay, easy.

572
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,480
You won't find
anything there anyway.

573
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,899
Who the fuck are you?!

574
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,567
- Daniels.
- Jones.

575
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:30,736
- Paulson.
- Fuck, you guys.

576
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,654
You scared the shit out of me.

577
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,072
Reynolds gave us intel
you'd be coming out here.

578
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,574
Didn't expect to see you so soon.

579
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:38,410
Got out here pretty quick for a
private military contractor.

580
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,079
Three of us have been out here the
past four months tracking Number 3.

581
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,749
We hear you created quite the
shitstorm a few months back

582
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,917
going after Number 3.

583
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,878
There were four. One
of us was compromised.

584
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:50,081
Heard the screams, but
we never found the body.

585
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,677
If you're looking for
weapons and explosives,

586
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,926
this is where you'll find 'em.

587
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,975
I hope you like to swim.

588
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:04,269
We hear you're going
back after your boys.

589
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,271
It's a suicide mission.
You know that.

590
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:09,483
- Any intel?
- Yeah, about 15-20 strong.

591
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,443
Packed up the village
a couple hours ago.

592
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:14,196
Heading to the hideout.
It's marked on your map.

593
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,444
Good luck.

594
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:29,962
Let's have it.

595
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:32,548
Sir, Nash has just made
contact with Delta

596
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:34,132
and the map's been delivered.

597
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,802
He's on track, just as
we were anticipating,

598
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,804
heading straight fur the cache.

599
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:42,140
His ETA to final
destination is 48 hours,

600
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,389
if he survives.

601
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:21,680
Shalom.

602
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:25,511
Don't forget... come
back alive to your son.

603
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:16,296
Yeah, sat work has it by 30 miles.

604
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,472
Keep your eye on the target.

605
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,742
Hey!

606
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:58,582
American!

607
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,990
Guys, it's me.

608
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:15,201
Let's move. Get the guns.

609
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,380
Pick up the weapons.

610
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:23,008
Get the weapons.

611
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:36,271
Get down!

612
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,520
Brad, watch the door!
Watch the door!

613
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,069
Brad, what's your status?!

614
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:51,700
Ahhh!

615
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:55,699
For Scott.

616
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:00,253
Ahh!

617
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,040
Shit, let's go! Come on!

618
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,468
Nash, he's gone,
he's gone, come on!

619
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,846
He's not gone! Brad, Brad!

620
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,264
Let's go!

621
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,646
- Nash, come on!
- No, you're not dead. Stay with me!

622
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,648
- He is dead!
- Come on, Brad, stay with me!

623
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,109
- He is dead. He got hit! Let's go!
- He's not gone!

624
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,278
I won't leave anybody
behind, you understand?

625
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:28,406
God, look at him,
center mass! Let's go!

626
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,908
Come on! Get in the truck!
We gotta move now!

627
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,285
Stay with me, you understand?

628
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,037
- Stay with me!
- Get in the truck!

629
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,832
Nash, come on, get in the truck.
Get in the truck!

630
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:03,983
Are you okay, man?

631
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,027
I don't know.

632
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:09,148
What happened to Scott?

633
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:16,288
They killed him.

634
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:20,208
Salaam alaikum.

635
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,835
This is Aisha Nasser
reporting live once again

636
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,504
from the Afghanistan
Pakistan border.

637
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:27,256
As conflict continues to
rise in the Middle East,

638
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:30,218
the whereabouts of Osama
bin Laden are still unknown.

639
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,929
However, drone surveillance
has shown heavy activity

640
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:36,140
near the the Afghanistan!
Pakistan border,

641
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,309
AKA: Sector 4,

642
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,520
which the government
has recently deemed

643
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:42,688
too dangerous to engage in combat,

644
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,650
causing a stalemate in
the war on Al-Qaeda.

645
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,980
This is Aisha Nasser,
reporting back to you.

646
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,452
Hey, thank you.

647
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:58,663
From me and my family,

648
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,706
thank you.

649
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:05,461
You're welcome, buddy. You would
have done the same thing for me.

650
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,755
Yeah. I would have tried.

651
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,549
Okay.

652
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:23,563
Raven, this is Echo 1.

653
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:25,516
DO you got the grid?

654
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,740
Did you copy that?

655
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:38,195
Yeah, sat work has it by 30 miles.

656
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,873
Roger that.

657
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,547
"Against our recommendation,

658
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:52,216
Nash traveled to Sector
4 via civilian means

659
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,218
and began a large ground assault

660
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:57,597
on Al-Qaeda forces in the area.

661
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,808
We intercepted contact
leading us to believe

662
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,269
that both Nash and the hostages

663
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:07,566
are unfortunately D-E-A-D."

664
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,688
- Hold on, Nash.
- Morning, sir.

665
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:18,951
Go on with your report. I can't
wait to hear what happened next.

666
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:21,120
Go on.

667
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:24,749
It is good to see you, Nash.

668
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,959
Is it?

669
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,754
So how are the men?

670
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:32,882
I got Steven out. Brad
and Scott are dead,

671
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:35,468
but I'm sure you already
know that, don't you, sir?

672
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:37,386
I'm sorry about that, Nash.
Really, I am.

673
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:41,057
But like I said, that's why you
guys make the big bucks, right?

674
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:43,768
You risk it all.

675
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:46,771
You are the one who
sent me that video.

676
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:49,106
You knew bin Laden's location,

677
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:51,567
knowing that I would
go back in Sector 4,

678
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,694
create enough chaos

679
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:56,906
so it would open the window for the
military to move in on bin Laden.

680
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,157
Am I correct, sir?

681
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:00,910
With less forces
protecting bin Laden,

682
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,954
the better chance we
had to take him out

683
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:06,707
- with safety to our men.
- What about my men?

684
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:10,044
You used them as bait.

685
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,047
You sent us on a
suicide mission, sir.

686
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:16,548
The only problem is
I am still alive.

687
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:23,057
Men like us don't operate
on nobility and honor,

688
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:26,102
so don't... so don't bullshit
with some hero act.

689
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,479
War has become a very
lucrative business

690
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,690
and made me a very rich man.

691
01:24:30,691 --> 01:24:33,064
So how much will it take?

692
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,901
Hmph!

693
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:40,157
Nothing is going to change anyway.

694
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,327
So I want a proper military
service for my two men.

695
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:44,704
That's number one.

696
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:47,875
Number two, I want a big
check and I mean a big one.

697
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:53,835
And number three,
I want out for good, sir.

698
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:00,511
I'll miss you.

699
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,931
Okay, here we go.

700
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:18,904
That'll buy your kid a
nice shiny new bike.

701
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:21,407
Hmm. It's not only for me, sir.

702
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:24,368
I'm sorry to hear that, Nash.

703
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:28,372
I had a job lined up you'd
be the perfect man for.

704
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:30,750
I'm sure you did.

705
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:34,546
I already got a job, sir.
Thank you.

706
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:39,047
Damn, I thought he was dead.

707
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:37,692
No one left behind.

708
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:40,111
We lived and died by those words.

709
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:43,280
Turns out, maybe we did not
understand what that meant,

710
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:46,200
who was actually being left behind.

711
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:51,622
Many soldiers lose their
lives to save others.

712
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:54,417
Not everyone understands
why they do it,

713
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:58,045
sometimes not even
their own family,

714
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,715
because they are the
ones left behind,

715
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:03,886
the ones that have to deal
with the loss and the pain.

716
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:09,765
But now I'm making the same
promise to you and Max...

717
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:12,594
to never leave you behind again.
