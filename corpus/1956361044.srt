00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,132
Dirk Drake, huh?

369
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:30,134
<i>Passion crest!</i>

370
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:33,138
$3,600 a week!

371
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:37,277
And what is wrong
with people, you know?

372
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:39,279
Every day
it seems like everybody

373
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,282
is just getting stupider
and stupider.

374
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:46,287
You seem rather agitated
today, Mary.

375
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:48,288
I am agitated, I am.

376
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,791
You know, every morning
I pass this guy on the street,

377
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,293
and he always makes some
disgusting comment to me.

378
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:56,296
Why don't you take
a different route?

379
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:58,298
Because I don't want
to take a different route.

380
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:02,302
Why should I let that scumbag
dictate how I live my life?

381
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:04,805
What I feel like doing
is taking him by the hair

382
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:07,307
and smashing his face
right into the sidewalk.

383
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:10,310
Perhaps we could find
a more productive outlet

384
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:11,812
for your anger.

385
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:13,313
Another female patient of mine

386
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:16,316
is taking a self-defense class

387
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:17,317
that is quite unique.

388
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:19,820
I don't need self-defense.

389
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:20,821
Hear me out, Mary.

390
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:21,822
OK.

391
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:23,824
The instructor
has apparently devised

392
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:25,826
a series of exercises

393
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:27,328
designed to help women cope

394
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:29,830
with the more
ordinary rudenesses

395
00:19:29,831 --> 00:19:32,833
they encounter
on a day-to-day basis.

396
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,334
I'm going to get

397
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:36,803
his telephone number for you,

398
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:39,256
and you call him
when you feel like it.

399
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:40,757
A physical activity like this

400
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:43,760
might alleviate
some of that hostility

401
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,262
you have for men.

402
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:48,765
Am I hostile towards men?

403
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:52,769
We'll talk about that next week.

404
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,770
Oh, OK.

405
00:19:53,771 --> 00:19:56,740
And might I add that
blouse you are wearing

406
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,775
is especially becoming.

407
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:00,778
Thank you, Dr. Leuter.

408
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,752
You know, biff…

409
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:13,256
Sometimes I want to just
rip my clothes off

410
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:15,258
in the middle
of that store and outbox

411
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:17,761
that goddamn
sales merchandise manager.

412
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:18,763
I mean…

413
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:21,264
Aah!

414
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:24,268
I'm sorry.
I forgot my line.

415
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:25,269
Oh, that's all right.

416
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,270
Really, really it is.

417
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:29,272
Joe.

418
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:32,275
We have a little problem
with your credits here.

419
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:33,777
There's no TV,

420
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,278
no commercials, no soaps.

421
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:37,731
I'm not that interested
in doing soap operas.

422
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:39,282
Really?

423
00:20:39,283 --> 00:20:40,784
Why is that?

424
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,786
It's not even acting, is it?

425
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:45,289
I mean, not the kind of acting
that I want to do.

426
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,290
It's fake, it's stupid.

427
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,792
Well, it's clear that you and I

428
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:51,294
have absolutely nothing
to talk about.

429
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:52,295
Good-bye.

430
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:53,296
Excuse me, miss Taylor,

431
00:20:53,297 --> 00:20:54,297
what did I say?

432
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:55,716
Oh, Christ.

433
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:58,301
What every other no-name,
no-credit actor says

434
00:20:58,302 --> 00:20:59,803
when he comes through that door.

435
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:01,805
I mean, who the hell
do you think you are?

436
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:03,807
Tom Cruise?

437
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:05,308
Well, you're not,
and believe me,

438
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:06,810
you're stupid if you think

439
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:07,811
that I would hire any actor

440
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:09,763
who wasn't damn willing to work.

441
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:10,815
You misunderstood. I'm…

442
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:11,815
This is a business.

443
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:13,800
If you don't understand that,

444
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:15,268
then you don't belong in it.

445
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:16,269
Go away.

446
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,272
You're right, miss Taylor,
this is a business.

447
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:20,774
I understand that.

448
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:22,776
I'm beginning
to understand that.

449
00:21:22,777 --> 00:21:26,780
I didn't mean that I wouldn't
work on a soap.

450
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:28,782
If there was something
that you thought I could do,

451
00:21:28,783 --> 00:21:29,783
of course I would do it.

452
00:21:29,784 --> 00:21:32,753
Really, I would love
to work on a soap.

453
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:34,254
How old are you?

454
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:35,756
35.

455
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:39,760
35.

456
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:41,762
No credits.

457
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:43,263
No agent.

458
00:21:43,264 --> 00:21:47,267
All right, let's get real, Joe.

459
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:50,721
Have you got a bathing suit?

460
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:52,272
I could get one.

461
00:21:52,273 --> 00:21:53,273
Good.

462
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:55,275
There's a Madonna video
coming up.

463
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:56,276
Kind of a beach theme.

464
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:58,278
You might be right for it.

465
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,280
Unless, of course,

466
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:02,232
you don't do music videos.

467
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,785
Of course I do.

468
00:22:04,786 --> 00:22:06,787
That would be great,
miss Taylor…

469
00:22:06,788 --> 00:22:08,288
Or is it Dee Dee?

470
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:09,790
Thanks, Joe.

471
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,792
I'll be in touch.

472
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:20,301
WOMAN ON P.A.: Hey, guys,
come on back and see Chavonne,

473
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:22,302
New York's hottest blonde.

474
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:26,807
She's a college girl
majoring in sexy, sexy, sexy.

475
00:22:26,808 --> 00:22:28,809
That's right,
you there in the overcoat,

476
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,311
this college chick,

477
00:22:31,312 --> 00:22:32,813
is she a real blonde?

478
00:22:32,814 --> 00:22:34,815
Oh, yeah. Beautiful.

479
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:36,817
Sexy, sexy chick, man.

480
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:39,319
Like Madonna, but blond.

481
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Very blond.

482
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:43,824
All right.
I'll take a buck's worth.

483
00:22:43,825 --> 00:22:45,325
WOMAN ON P.A.:
Here he comes.

484
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:46,326
He knows the real thing.

485
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:47,828
How about you other guys, huh?

486
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:48,829
Don't you want to see Chavonne?

487
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,332
New York's hottest blonde.

488
00:23:02,343 --> 00:23:04,345
Ohh.

489
00:23:17,358 --> 00:23:19,360
Thank you.

490
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:22,362
I love this little puppy.

491
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:23,864
I love her, I love her,

492
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:26,366
we love her, too,
don't we, Cassiopeia?

493
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:28,869
Hey, there, little Cassie.

494
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,871
Oh, we don't call her
Cassie, Joe.

495
00:23:30,872 --> 00:23:32,372
We have a strict rule.

496
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:34,374
Her whole name
or no name at all.

497
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,877
I'm sorry.
That's a good rule.

498
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:38,879
It's so great to see you guys.

499
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,380
It's been too long.

500
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:41,882
We've been absolutely crazed

501
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:43,383
since Alex's show.

502
00:23:43,384 --> 00:23:45,886
Absolutely crazed.

503
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:47,387
I'm in 3 galleries now.

504
00:23:47,388 --> 00:23:49,840
The paintings
are selling so fast,

505
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:51,391
I don't even have time
to stretch a canvas.

506
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:54,394
If you need a job, Joe,

507
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:55,896
I could put you
to work tomorrow.

508
00:23:55,897 --> 00:23:57,898
Oh, thanks.
I got a job.

509
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:01,902
I don't think we've seen
you since <i>Il Piano.</i>

510
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:03,904
Oh, my god, I loved that movie.

511
00:24:03,905 --> 00:24:05,405
Wasn't that a great movie?

512
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:08,909
A great, great flick.

513
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,912
One of the best, really.

514
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:13,414
That movie was a piece of shit.

515
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,918
Are you kidding?

516
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,419
No, I'm not kidding.

517
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,420
Come on, it was nothing

518
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:21,922
but a glorified romance novel.

519
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:24,925
Spirited sensuous young woman

520
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:25,926
leaves her uptight husband

521
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:26,928
for the man of her dreams:

522
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:29,930
A masculine but sensitive native

523
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:31,932
with earrings and tattoos.

524
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,433
I'm sorry, Joe,

525
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:35,435
but I think
you completely missed

526
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:36,937
what this film was about.

527
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:38,939
Oh. What
was it about?

528
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,942
Well, it was about
a lot of things.

529
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:44,444
It was about courage, freedom.

530
00:24:44,445 --> 00:24:48,949
It was about unrestricted,
unconditional primal love.

531
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,902
Yeah, you're way off
on this, man.

532
00:24:51,903 --> 00:24:52,953
I'm just curious.

533
00:24:52,954 --> 00:24:54,955
Has anyone seen
<i>the little mermaid?</i>

534
00:24:54,956 --> 00:24:59,459
Besides, it was only on every
top 10 list in the country.

535
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,327
So, what?

536
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:01,461
What are those two gonna do

537
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:02,463
for the rest of their lives?

538
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:03,914
Stand around
and stare at each other

539
00:25:03,915 --> 00:25:05,916
all loving and unconditional?

540
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:07,417
Do you think that
they'll ever have

541
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:08,418
a real argument

542
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:09,419
the way that real people do?

543
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,888
Do you think that she
would ever say to him,

544
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:13,423
"hey, Kimba,
you know I really love

545
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:14,925
"your masculine sensitivity,

546
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:16,426
but do you think that just once

547
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:17,928
you could remember
to lift the toilet seat

548
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:19,429

00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:57,572
You can take the bus up to it.

907
00:40:57,573 --> 00:40:59,073
[WOMAN LAUGHING]

908
00:40:59,074 --> 00:41:00,542
RAINA: Joe!

909
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,544
Alex, look. It's Joe.

910
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,078
ALEX: You're right.
It is Joe.

911
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,580
Hey there, buddy.

912
00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:07,582
What are you guys doing here?

913
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:08,583
I'm on the board

914
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:11,085
because the met bought
6 of my paintings.

915
00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:14,088
Oh. You're getting them
stretched all right, huh?

916
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:17,091
This is so funny, Joe.
You're working.

917
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:19,093
Yeah. I got to
pay the bills.

918
00:41:19,094 --> 00:41:20,595
Great tuxedo, man.

919
00:41:20,596 --> 00:41:22,096
Thanks. It's secondhand.

920
00:41:22,097 --> 00:41:24,098
Hey, you know what? I'm doing
a Madonna video tomorrow.

921
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:26,601
I love Madonna.

922
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:28,069
You know, we know her.

923
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,604
Yeah, she called me.
She wants me to do

924
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:31,606
a special featured cameo
or something.

925
00:41:31,607 --> 00:41:35,610
That is just like her.
Tell her I said hi.

926
00:41:35,611 --> 00:41:37,111
I will.

927
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:40,615
And tell Mary we should
get together real soon.

928
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:41,617
OK.

929
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Excuse me, sir.

930
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:48,623
Is there anything else
I can get you?

931
00:41:48,624 --> 00:41:50,124
Perhaps some more whipped cream?

932
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:51,593
No, thank you, captain.

933
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:52,627
Got to keep ship-shape

934
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:54,128
for all these fillies
around here.

935
00:41:54,129 --> 00:41:55,130
You know what I mean?

936
00:41:55,631 --> 00:41:56,598
Aye, aye, captain.

937
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:01,135
What are you doing?

938
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:03,137
He asked me about
the strawberries,

939
00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:04,639
how they got so big.

940
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,641
Never, ever
touch a guest. Never!

941
00:42:06,642 --> 00:42:08,643
I'm sorry, Ernst.
Nobody told me.

942
00:42:08,644 --> 00:42:10,645
OK, OK, OK. Just go,
go, go, go, go, go.

943
00:42:10,646 --> 00:42:12,648
God damn, you fucking whores.

944
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,008
Let's begin today by
reviewing a few facts.

945
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:22,011
Men are physically stronger
than women.

946
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:24,014
This is not a criticism
of your gender, ladies.

947
00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:25,514
It is a fact.

948
00:42:25,515 --> 00:42:29,518
Fact… you as women
are vulnerable.

949
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,487
Vulnerable, but not helpless.

950
00:42:31,488 --> 00:42:33,522
This class will provide
each and every one of you

951
00:42:33,523 --> 00:42:37,026
with a simple and effective
means of self-defense

952
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:40,029
in the event
of a physical assault.

953
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:44,033
Fact… there are other
types of assault.

954
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:46,035
Verbal harassment
on the streets,

955
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:49,038
blatant groping and fondling
in public places…

956
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,041
All the behavioral ticks
that make men…

957
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:53,542
So irresistible.

958
00:42:53,543 --> 00:42:56,045
Now, my research has shown
that these assaults

959
00:42:56,046 --> 00:42:57,546
could be equally damaging

960
00:42:57,547 --> 00:43:02,051
if the rage and the frustration
that they arouse

961
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:04,053
are not released.

962
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:05,554
And to that end,

963
00:43:05,555 --> 00:43:07,556
I have developed a series
of patented exercises

964
00:43:07,557 --> 00:43:11,060
designed to increase your rrq.

965
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:12,528
Class.

966
00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:14,063
Rage release quotient!

967
00:43:14,064 --> 00:43:15,064
DOUG: Good.

968
00:43:15,065 --> 00:43:16,566
Uh, Sheila, why don't you

969
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:19,569
come up to the front
of the class, please?

970
00:43:21,571 --> 00:43:22,571
Thank you.

971
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:25,074
Now…

972
00:43:25,075 --> 00:43:28,577
Remember, you can respond
however you feel, OK?

973
00:43:28,578 --> 00:43:31,080
If you wish to scream,
scream away.

974
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:33,082
If you feel like striking me,

975
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,084
go ahead and do so.
Understand?

976
00:43:35,085 --> 00:43:36,085
I think so.

977
00:43:36,086 --> 00:43:39,088
All right. Let's begin.

978
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:41,091
Looking good, sweet meat.

979
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:44,593
Sweet meat.

980
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:46,595
Did you hear what I said?

981
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:48,597
Yes.

982
00:43:48,598 --> 00:43:50,599
Do you like being
called sweet meat?

983
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,601
No.

984
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:54,103
Does it make you angry?

985
00:43:54,104 --> 00:43:55,104
Yes.

986
00:43:55,105 --> 00:43:56,605
How angry?

987
00:43:56,606 --> 00:43:59,608
Very angry.

988
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:01,110
OK.

989
00:44:01,111 --> 00:44:02,611
How do you feel?

990
00:44:02,612 --> 00:44:04,613
Better.

991
00:44:04,614 --> 00:44:06,115
Good.

992
00:44:06,116 --> 00:44:08,618
OK, Mary?

993
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,120
Come to the front, please.

994
00:44:13,123 --> 00:44:15,624
OK. Let's begin.

995
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:19,628
Man, you got some sweet
little ass on you, cupcake.

996
00:44:19,629 --> 00:44:21,130
Shut the fuck up!

997
00:44:21,131 --> 00:44:23,632
I'd take a nice little bite

998
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:26,602
out of that sweet little ass,
cupcake.

999
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,651
You OK?

1000
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:42,652
Yeah.

1001
00:44:43,153 --> 00:44:43,653
That was great.

1002
00:44:43,654 --> 00:44:46,155
It was.

1003
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:48,157
He brought me up to the class,

1004
00:44:48,158 --> 00:44:49,658
and he was telling me, you know,

1005
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:51,660
"just go ahead and do whatever
you feel like doing."

1006
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:53,162
I mean, it was just incredible.

1007
00:44:53,163 --> 00:44:55,164
I started punching
and swinging at him.

1008
00:44:55,165 --> 00:44:57,166
I mean, I never knew
it would feel this good

1009
00:44:57,167 --> 00:44:58,668
to hit somebody, you know?

1010
00:44:59,135 --> 00:45:00,669
That's great.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1011
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,670
I did, I did.

1012
00:45:01,671 --> 00:45:03,672
And this teacher
is so fantastic.

1013
00:45:03,673 --> 00:45:05,675
He said I have
a really high rrq.

1014
00:45:06,176 --> 00:45:07,176
Rrq?

1015
00:45:07,177 --> 00:45:09,178
Rage release quotient!

1016
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:12,681
He said I have the highest
in the class. Ha ha.

1017
00:45:12,682 --> 00:45:13,682
Brrrr!

1018
00:45:13,683 --> 00:45:16,185
99.3!

1019
00:45:18,188 --> 00:45:20,189
Maybe I should take that class.

1020
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,192
You know, Alex and Raina
were at that dinner tonight.

1021
00:45:23,193 --> 00:45:24,693
He made a comment
about my tuxedo,

1022
00:45:24,694 --> 00:45:26,195
and I wanted to kill him.

1023
00:45:26,696 --> 00:45:27,696
I felt like such an idiot
standing there,

1024
00:45:27,697 --> 00:45:30,699
having them seeing me
working as a waiter.

1025
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,701
Come on, Joe.
It's what you do.

1026
00:45:32,702 --> 00:45:33,702
It's not what I do.

1027
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:35,204
OK.
It's not what you do,

1028
00:45:35,205 --> 00:45:37,206
but it's how you pay the rent.

1029
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:38,708
Huh? And there's
nothing wrong with it.

1030
00:45:39,209 --> 00:45:40,210
I mean, everybody has to work.

1031
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,710
Well, I'm sick of this shit.

1032
00:45:41,711 --> 00:45:44,213
I feel like my life's
going nowhere.

1033
00:45:44,214 --> 00:45:46,716
Joe, your life
is going somewhere.

1034
00:45:47,217 --> 00:45:50,219
I mean, you did this great
audition for Dee Dee Taylor,

1035
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,722
and she immediately
got you a job with pay.

1036
00:45:53,223 --> 00:45:54,723
Did you ever get
through to Madonna?

1037
00:45:54,724 --> 00:45:56,725
No. No, I've been
calling all day.

1038
00:45:56,726 --> 00:45:59,228
It's the story of my life…
Nobody's home.

1039
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,731
Come on, Joe.

1040
00:46:02,732 --> 00:46:06,735
You just got to stick
with it, you know?

1041
00:46:06,736 --> 00:46:09,739
I mean, you're a great actor.

1042
00:46:12,242 --> 00:46:14,243
I know you're gonna make it.

1043
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:15,245
Do you really think so?

1044
00:46:15,745 --> 00:46:17,747
Mm-hmm. I have no doubt.

1045
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,753
Mary. I don't know what
I'd do without you.

1046
00:46:24,254 --> 00:46:25,255
Me, too, Joe.

1047
00:46:32,762 --> 00:46:35,764
Hey, you feel like
fooling around?

1048
00:46:35,765 --> 00:46:38,267
I don't know.
I'm not really in the mood.

1049
00:46:38,268 --> 00:46:39,768
Come on, let's do it.

1050
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:41,771
I've got kind of
a big day tomorrow.

1051
00:46:42,272 --> 00:46:44,273
I don't want to go in
looking too tired.

1052
00:46:44,274 --> 00:46:46,275
Come on.

1053
00:46:46,276 --> 00:46:48,777
We're not building
the pyramids here.

1054
00:46:48,778 --> 00:46:50,279
Ha.

1055
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Come on, Mary.

1056
00:46:51,281 --> 00:46:53,282
I won't wear you out, I promise.

1057
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:55,284
Come on.
I'm serious.

1058
00:46:55,285 --> 00:46:57,287
Come on. Stop!

1059
00:46:58,288 --> 00:47:01,290
Jesus, you don't have
to get all pissy.

1060
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:03,792
I'm not getting all pissy.
I'm just…

1061
00:47:03,793 --> 00:47:05,794
Not in the mood.

1062
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:08,297
OK, fine.

1063
00:47:08,298 --> 00:47:10,299
Men aren't machines
that you can turn off and on

1064
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,301
by the flick of a switch,
you know?

1065
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:14,304
I get the point, Joe.

1066
00:47:17,307 --> 00:47:19,309
Now you're angry?

1067
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:20,809
I'm not angry.

1068
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,312
Just next time
<i>I'm</i> not in the mood,

1069
00:47:23,313 --> 00:47:26,316
don't give me any shit, OK?

1070
00:48:07,824 --> 00:48:10,326
More champagne, dirk?

1071
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:15,831
I'm leaving, Deanna.

1072
00:48:15,832 --> 00:48:17,834
Oh, please.
Please don't leave me.

1073
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:20,836
I love you, dirk.
I love you.

1074
00:48:20,837 --> 00:48:22,337
That means nothing to me now.

1075
00:48:22,338 --> 00:48:25,340
But you said you loved me.

1076
00:48:25,341 --> 00:48:27,843
I don't love you, Deanna.

1077
00:48:27,844 --> 00:48:30,345
You're weak.
You're helpless.

1078
00:48:30,346 --> 00:48:32,848
And frankly, you bore me.

1079
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:34,349
Please, dirk,

1080
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,802
what do you want me to do?

1081
00:48:36,803 --> 00:48:39,355
I want you to
get out of my life.

1082
00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:45,861
DIRECTOR: Cut!

No, class went

See how it's all sleek and Lacy?

01:12:12,609 --> 01:12:14,611
How it accentuates
every part of her body

01:12:15,112 --> 01:12:16,612
and presents it like
a beautiful piece of candy?

1601
01:12:16,613 --> 01:12:18,114
What's the matter?

1602
01:12:18,115 --> 01:12:19,615
Nothing.
I'm just listening.

I'm just waiting for you
to make your point.

1605

Oh, Rubio, I love you.

1784
01:19:48,202 --> 01:19:51,204
Rubio, no care.
Do you understand?

1785
01:19:51,205 --> 01:19:53,707
No care. No care, baby.

1786
01:19:53,708 --> 01:19:55,709

[WHISPERING]
Clear. Clear.

01:20:18,353 --> 01:20:20,805
Mr. Bob…

1789
01:20:20,806 --> 01:20:23,808
Clean, press, hang, no box.

1790
01:20:23,809 --> 01:20:25,276
Ah, you're the best, Chang.

1791
01:20:25,277 --> 01:20:26,811
I know it.

1792
01:20:26,812 --> 01:20:29,815
Here, I've got
something for you.

1793

Oh, no…

1794
01:20:32,818 --> 01:20:35,820
Mr. Bob!
My old tuxedo.

1795
01:20:35,821 --> 01:20:38,322
Come on. I told you I was
going to give it to you.

1796
01:20:38,323 --> 01:20:39,324
Just take it, will you?

1797

What?

1799
01:20:42,828 --> 01:20:44,829
Your name.
Sign your name here.

I'm great.
You get my message?

01:21:06,351 --> 01:21:08,352
You never fucking
called me, you bastard.

1811
01:21:08,353 --> 01:21:09,854
Yes. I was gonna call you,

1812
01:21:09,855 --> 01:21:11,356
but I've been so busy
with this goddamn soap.

Oh, yeah. It's going
pretty well, huh?

Can't complain, yeah.

a 5-year contract today.

What about you?
Still doing the catering?

01:21:21,867 --> 01:21:23,868
Yeah. I'm picking up
my tux right now,

1819
01:21:23,869 --> 01:21:26,371
and, uh…

1820
01:21:26,872 --> 01:21:29,373
Check it out.

1821
01:21:29,374 --> 01:21:30,374
What's that?

1822
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:32,376
I did a Madonna video.

1823
01:21:32,377 --> 01:21:34,879
She called me at home.

1824
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,380
I've been trying
to call her back,

1825

able to get through.

Come over to my house.
Right now. Come on.

Let's go. I'll play

Hey, that was this chick I know.

1833
01:21:51,396 --> 01:21:53,898
She does a great
Madonna imitation.

1834
01:21:53,899 --> 01:21:55,900
I said, "hey, call my buddy Joe.

1835
01:21:55,901 --> 01:21:58,402
Say you're Madonna,
leave a fake number."

1836
01:21:58,403 --> 01:22:01,906
I didn't think
she was going to do it.

1837
01:22:02,908 --> 01:22:04,408
That was you?

1838
01:22:04,409 --> 01:22:07,411
Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry.

1839
01:22:07,412 --> 01:22:08,913
I thought you'd get
a kick out of it.

1840
01:22:08,914 --> 01:22:09,914
I'm really sorry.

1841
01:22:09,915 --> 01:22:10,915
No.

01:22:10,916 --> 01:22:13,417
We should get together sometime.

1843
01:22:13,418 --> 01:22:14,919
Yeah, definitely,
let's get together.

1844
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,420
Right.
I'll give you a call.

Hey, likewise.

01:22:26,431 --> 01:22:28,933
Have you been back
to class since then?

1850
01:22:28,934 --> 01:22:31,936
Well, yeah, but I can
barely look at him.

1851
01:22:31,937 --> 01:22:34,438
I'm still so furious.

1852
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:37,442
Mary, I'm wondering if…

1853
01:22:37,943 --> 01:22:39,944
This enormous anger
you have toward Doug

1854
01:22:39,945 --> 01:22:41,445
is not somewhat misplaced.

1855
01:22:41,446 --> 01:22:42,914
What do you mean?

1856
01:22:43,415 --> 01:22:45,917
Well, should he be
so harshly condemned

1857
01:22:45,918 --> 01:22:49,420
simply for finding you
sexually desirable?

1858
01:22:49,421 --> 01:22:52,373
Well, should I
be grateful to him

1859
01:22:52,374 --> 01:22:54,876
for wanting to kiss me,
is that what you're saying?

1860
01:22:54,877 --> 01:22:58,847
Mary, I know this is
a sensitive subject for you,

1861
01:22:59,348 --> 01:23:03,301
but please try to remember
I'm on your side.

1862
01:23:03,302 --> 01:23:07,855
I do believe that you do
indeed have some difficulty

1863
01:23:07,856 --> 01:23:09,857
in accepting yourself

1864
01:23:09,858 --> 01:23:13,361
as a beautiful, sexually
desirable young woman.

1865
01:23:13,362 --> 01:23:15,813
Dr. Leuter, would you
please stop saying that?

1866
01:23:15,814 --> 01:23:17,315
Why?

1867
01:23:17,316 --> 01:23:20,818
Well… honestly,
it's just a little weird

1868
01:23:20,819 --> 01:23:22,320
hearing it from
my therapist, that's all.

1869
01:23:22,321 --> 01:23:24,822
Yes, I am your therapist, Mary,

1870
01:23:24,823 --> 01:23:28,793
but I am also a man, and
I would be lying to you

1871
01:23:28,794 --> 01:23:31,245
if I said that I didn't
have impulses as both.

1872
01:23:31,246 --> 01:23:32,747
Do you think my lying to you

1873
01:23:32,748 --> 01:23:34,248
would be beneficial?

1874
01:23:34,249 --> 01:23:35,716
No.

1875
01:23:35,717 --> 01:23:38,719
In truth, I've entertained
sexual thoughts about you

1876
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,221

and professionally engaged

in what you were saying,

1883
01:23:53,735 --> 01:23:56,687
part of me was imagining
what your breasts

1884
01:23:56,688 --> 01:24:00,692
would feel like
naked in my hands.

1885
01:24:04,196 --> 01:24:05,696

confront this issue!

2134
01:36:56,725 --> 01:36:57,726
Joe…

2135
01:36:58,227 --> 01:37:00,228
Do I have a sexual problem?

2136
01:37:00,229 --> 01:37:02,230
Are you crazy?

2137
01:37:02,231 --> 01:37:03,731
Dr. Leuter said
I had a sexual problem

2138
01:37:03,732 --> 01:37:05,233
because I didn't want to hear

2139
01:37:05,234 --> 01:37:06,734
his fantasies about me.

2140
01:37:06,735 --> 01:37:08,236
What fantasies?

2141
01:37:08,237 --> 01:37:09,737
He said he was a man

2142
01:37:09,738 --> 01:37:11,739
and he wondered what my
breasts would feel like

2143
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:13,741
naked in his hands.

2144
01:37:13,742 --> 01:37:15,743
Well, I'm a man,
and he's gonna wonder

2145
01:37:15,744 --> 01:37:17,745
what my fist feels like
naked in his face.

2146
01:37:17,746 --> 01:37:19,747
Joe…

2147
01:37:19,748 --> 01:37:21,749
You don't think I have
a sexual problem?

2148
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:23,752
Hell, no.

2149
01:37:24,253 --> 01:37:26,755
But even you said
I wasn't spontaneous.

2150
01:37:29,258 --> 01:37:31,260
Well, did I?

2151
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:35,263
Oh, come on, Mary,

2152
01:37:35,264 --> 01:37:37,765
I meant both of us.

2153
01:37:37,766 --> 01:37:39,767
You're still attracted to me?

2154
01:37:39,768 --> 01:37:41,269
Of course I am.

2155
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:43,771
We haven't made love
in over 2 months.

2156
01:37:43,772 --> 01:37:46,774
I know that.
You kidding?

2157
01:37:46,775 --> 01:37:49,277
I'm very aware of that.

2158
01:37:49,278 --> 01:37:51,746
Maybe you're
not attracted to me.

2159
01:37:51,747 --> 01:37:53,247
How can you say that?

2160
01:37:53,248 --> 01:37:56,751
Maybe you're attracted to guys
like your self-defense teacher

2161
01:37:56,752 --> 01:37:58,753
and his big, fancy BMW.

2162
01:37:58,754 --> 01:38:03,175
Joe, I am very attracted to you.

2163
01:38:05,177 --> 01:38:10,181
I am very, very, <i>very</i>
attracted to you, Mary.

2164
01:38:10,182 --> 01:38:16,188
I am very, very, very
attracted to you, Joe.

2165
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:28,199
[SHIRT TEARS]

2166
01:38:33,205 --> 01:38:34,706
Oh, Mary!

2167
01:38:40,379 --> 01:38:41,712
MARY:
What are you doing?

2168
01:38:41,713 --> 01:38:44,215
[LAUGHS] Oh, god!

2169
01:38:55,227 --> 01:38:57,228
Jesus…
Christ.

2170
01:38:57,229 --> 01:38:59,730
Joe, you were incredible.

2171
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:02,233
Me? What about you?

2172
01:39:02,234 --> 01:39:03,734
Little rabbit.

2173
01:39:03,735 --> 01:39:06,237
Little sex rabbit.

2174
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:08,739
Carrot boy.

2175
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:10,241
Whoo.

2176
01:39:10,242 --> 01:39:11,742
Whoo.

2177
01:39:11,743 --> 01:39:12,743
Wow.

2178
01:39:12,744 --> 01:39:15,746
Hey, how did you know
my teacher had a BMW?

2179
01:39:15,747 --> 01:39:17,248
Does he?

2180
01:39:17,249 --> 01:39:18,750
Yeah.

2181
01:39:22,254 --> 01:39:24,255
Lucky guess.

2182
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:26,257
Sorry about the rubber.

2183
01:39:26,258 --> 01:39:27,759
Think we'll be OK?

2184
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:31,762
I don't know.

2185
01:39:31,763 --> 01:39:32,764
I hope so.

2186
01:40:12,137 --> 01:40:14,639
Good morning.

2187
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,642
How do you like your eggs, baby?

2188
01:40:18,143 --> 01:40:19,143
Over easy.

2189
01:40:19,144 --> 01:40:22,146
All righty.
Over easy it is.

2190
01:40:22,147 --> 01:40:25,149
Everything's going to be
easy from here on out.

2191
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:26,651
And you know what I've decided?

2192
01:40:26,652 --> 01:40:28,152
For the wedding,

2193
01:40:28,153 --> 01:40:30,655
I'm going to go back
to my real color.

2194
01:40:30,656 --> 01:40:32,157
Brunette, again.

2195
01:40:32,658 --> 01:40:35,159
I haven't been
a brunette in years.

2196
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,662
Besides…

2197
01:40:37,663 --> 01:40:40,665
It's the real me, anyway.

2198
01:40:40,666 --> 01:40:43,668
And who more would you
want than the real me?

2199
01:40:43,669 --> 01:40:46,170
Nothing more than
just absolutely me.

2200
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:48,172
I feel so comfortable with you

2201
01:40:48,173 --> 01:40:50,174
I just cannot believe it.

2202
01:40:50,175 --> 01:40:53,178
I'm just so excited
about this wedding…

2203
01:41:21,657 --> 01:41:22,658
Buddy.
