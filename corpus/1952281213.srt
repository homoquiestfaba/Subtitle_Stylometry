You dialed 911, what is your emergency?

Please...

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,800
Send help, they killed her,
they killed...

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,100
...My family is dead!

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,100
Can you tell me what is happening?

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,700
Please...

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,300
Just send help...

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,300
They killed my mother...

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,200
They are dead! My sister is dead!

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,300
Possible 217, we need all
units.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Killed! My sister is dead!

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,200
s is my wonderful family.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,300
My wonderful mother, Ellen.

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Mother, say hello to the camera.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,700
- Hello.
- Smile. And here we have

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,600
my beautiful sister, Samantha.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,500
Samantha,
smile for the camera.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,300
- Smile.
- Is not she beautiful?!

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
You two... ah...

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,100
You matched the colors tonight?

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
I must have forgotten
read the memo.

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,100
Yes, indeed,
let you out of the memo.

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,200
Yeah, you left out
because we hate you.

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Mom, this is weird.

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,500
This is not for you
help wash the dishes, Thomas?

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,500
Ah ... not ...

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,000
- Why do not you come help us?
- Of course not.

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,100
Mom, thank you for dinner.

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,100
Your welcome.

32
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,100
It was a wonderful dinner.

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,100
Thomas ... I just want to ask ...

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
I understand that Dr. Lauren 
wants us to do this whole thing ... 

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,600
But ... that only has cameras 
in our rooms and not on yours? 

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,400
Because ... you would not like 
see what happens in my room. 

37
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,200
Someone would like to ... 
say something ... 

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,700
on our experiment here? 

39
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,100
How you will 
make money with the fact that ... 

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,600
I will not make money from nothing! 

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,200
Mr. Medium said to document everything, 

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,200
then, what better way to do this 
than with a camera? 

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,500
- And why do not you write? 
- I will not write it. 

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,200
Last fall, Thomas Finley was arrested by 
rape and murder of his sister aged 19, Samantha Finley. 

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,100
He also was convicted of murder 
Lauren Edgar, a paranormal investigator. 

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,100
Thomas says that the victims were attacked 
by a demonic entity of unknown origin. 

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,700
He committed suicide soon after, 
while in prison. 

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,800
The recording below was found a year later, 
hidden in the attic of the family. 

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,500
Is being shown to the public 
the first time. 

50
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,300
We are running ... Testing, testing, 
one, two, three. 

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,300
Camera focus. 

52
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
And here we are. 

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,700
Thomas Finley ... 

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,900
This is my fourth. 

55
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,400
Here is where I sleep. 

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,300
Today is the day off the employee. 

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,500
We're walking down the aisle ... 

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,300
to the living room. 

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,100
We have a camera ... corner ... 

60
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,800
Filming in night vision ... 

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
with a battery of 8 hours ... 

62
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,800
to shoot all night and 
pra that we can see ... 

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,700
whatever happens ... this room. 

64
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,400
This is the fourth of Samantha. 

65
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,100
We have a ... 

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
camera on the tripod, 

67
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
recording in night vision 

68
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,800
battery with 8 hours 

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,500
to film whatever happens 

70
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,600
or not happen.

71
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,300
And then ... if we go down the hall ...

72
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,100
Sorry.

73
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,300
Shit ...

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,200
And the mother's room, we have a camera in the corner ...

75
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,100
Mother

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,100
Mother

77
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,600
This is the daddy?

78
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,300
First night
October 3
2:06

79
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,800
Hi, you've reached the Finleys.
We can not answer now,

80
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,700
But if you leave a message;
we will return. Thank you.

81
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,500
Good morning.

82
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,800
Someone is wonderful
this morning.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,800
Great.

84
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,500
What we are doing pro coffee?

85
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
You will make me ...

86
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,600
I will not do anything for you.

87
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,800
I'm doing this to myself.

88
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,600
This seems to vomit.

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,300
Is, do something for you.

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I see that someone is
a great mood this morning.

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
I know.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
Especially when they call
my food vomiting.

93
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,100
It makes me really happy.

94
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,900
It makes me great.

95
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,100
You do not have a job
or something to do?

96
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,800
Today I am officially unemployed.

97
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,500
Oh, I'm shocked.

98
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Really shocked.

99
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,200
See, this is my surprise face.

100
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Ah, that's good. 

101
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Yes it is recording? 

102
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,000
Is that I'm surprised 
for you being unemployed. 

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
I think I'll win 
an award for it. 

104
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,100
It is a real loser. 

105
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,300
So ... um ... 

106
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,600
Some dad's visit 
tonight? 

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,600
Not funny. 

108
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,700
Let your sister in peace, Tommy. 

109
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
Ok? 

110
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Just stop. 

111
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,800
What about you, mother? 

112
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,600
Something happened that night? 

113
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,600
He made coffee, Sam? 

114
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,400
No. 

115
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Mother

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,600
- Yes, Tommy. 
- Something happened? 

117
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
- I do not want to talk about it. 
- I think we should talk. 

118
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,700
I think it is important to discuss 
about what is happening in this house. 

119
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,400
- Turn off the camera. 
- And what is happening. 

120
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,300
Turn off the camera. 

121
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,600
I think if you say 
who is talking to Dad ... 

122
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,500
Turn that damn camera! 

123
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,600
About a year 
my husband David ... 

124
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,600
died in a car accident. 

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,600
And I'm sorry to miss him. 

126
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,800
There is even a day 
I do not think it ... 

127
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,800
A couple of months ... 

128
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,100
I just started talking to him. 

129
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,100
Know ... I just ... 

130
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,800
Just got a. .. 
talk, pretending 

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,800
store very strange ... weird ... 

132
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,000
And there was a lady there, 
and she was telling us that ... 

133
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,500
You can actually ... 
can speak with the dead ... 

134
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,000
writing for them. 

135
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,700
So I said, "Okay." 

136
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,900
So I went home e. .. 

137
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,800
I picked up a pen and 
a pad of paper ... 

138
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,600
I started writing one night. 

139
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,900
I wrote e. .. 
just wrote ... 

140
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,100
E. .. 

141
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,300
I felt that something was me ... 
was taking care of me. 

142
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,800
I just ... 

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,200
I felt I was really 
talking with David 

144
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,000
and that he was 
really responding, you know? 

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,500
I mean ... 
each ... every word I wrote ... 

146
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,500
it was as if he were there with me. 

147
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:11,000
And then every night I went to my room 
and wrote to him and he answered me. 

148
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I really think 
I was talking to David. 

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,700
But then these ... 

150
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Then some strange things 
started happening e. .. 

151
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,100
I do not know, it's like ... 

152
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,500
I do not know ... bad things ... 

153
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,000
Things happening riuns 
with Samantha. 

154
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,800
Bad things happening. 

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,500
That is not David, OK? 
David does not ... 

156
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,600
not do these things. 

157
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
What do you think that is? 

158
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,200
I do not know. 

159
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,300
I do not know. 

160
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,900
I do not know what the hell is this. 

161
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Whatever it is, 
not his father. 

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,700
What was that? 

163
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Oh shit! 

164
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,400
He left. 

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Christ. 

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,400
And the camera is ... 

167
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,200
on. 

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,800
'm In the next room. 

169
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,900
Monday night 
October 4 
3:43 

170
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,900
Tommy! 

171
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
What? 

172
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,100
I found this on the floor. 

173
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,200
Give me that. 

174
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What I am saying to Sam is that it is 
possible that the cross has fallen from the wall. 

175
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
And ended up in the corner ...? 

176
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,900
Things do not fall from the walls, 
hit the ground and move to the corners. 

177
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,000
No, they do not fly diagonal e. .. 

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,400
- Who said that? 
- Things do not square roll. 

179
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,700
I did not say rolled, 
but what if the wall fell diagonally ... 

180
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,400
I was far away. 

181
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,200
So you can have kicked ... 

182
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
And if she kicked? 

183
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,100
What if ... 

184
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,100
No, if the cross fell from the wall, that does not mean 
she kicked, that's what I'm saying. 

185
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,100
I do not like the fact that you 
suggest that your sister is lying. 

186
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,500
- I'm not suggesting that. 
- You are. 

187
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,500
I even said that she 
lying. 

188
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, these things may have happened. 

189
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,500
If the cross fell from the wall, it does not 
means that the ghost dropped. 

190
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,200
- No, no, you're right. 
- Not to say that the ghost did it. 

191
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,400
You're right ... 
Did not mean it. 

192
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Yes, I am sure, Sam. 

193
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,100
Yeah, you're totally right. 
Not mean anything. 

194
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,300
There is nothing happening here, Mom. 
I just say that this does not mean anything. 

195
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Yeah, he's trying to say that this gives 
a good scene pra a fucking movie, that's all. 

196
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Shut up, damn it, really. 
I'm tired of hearing you say that.

197
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,100
- I do not give a damn. 
- Stop with the words, OK. 

198
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Stop! Stop! 

199
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
I want you to stop! 
Stop! 

200
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,300
Christ! 

201
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,400
Hallo. 

202
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,100
He has to keep shit 
camera on?! 

203
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,000
In fact, he does not live here anymore. 

204
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,300
No. 

205
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,200
Okay. 

206
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,600
Bye. 

207
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,700
Great. 

208
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,100
Very well done ... 

209
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,600
fucking asshole. 

210
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Mother 

211
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Hallo. 

212
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,000
Hallo. 

213
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,300
Aloo. 

214
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,000
Sam. 

215
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,600
Last night, my cross fell from the wall. 
Only I'm sure it was played there. 

216
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,500
Thomas refuses to believe me. 
Or he does not want. 'm Very scared. 

217
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,000
Please God, help me! 
Where are You?? 

218
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,500
Why am I seeing this? 

219
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,300
Hein. 

220
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,600
Hi 

221
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,800
Sorry for yelling. 

222
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,000
Why do you say that now 
I'm ready to sleep? 

223
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Why an apology and 
I thought I would go on record. 

224
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,000
But you still think I 
do not believe in you. 

225
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
- You do not believe. 
- I believe. 

226
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,400
Everything is confusing, you know. 

227
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,700
So sorry, I do not 
wanted to scream. 

228
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,600
Legal? 

229
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes 

230
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,300
Cool. 

231
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,100
Cool. 

232
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
See you tomorrow. 

233
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,500
Thursday Night 
7 October 
1:02 

234
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,300
David? 

235
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,900
David? 

236
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,500
Tommy! 

237
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
Tommy! 

238
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,200
Tom! 

239
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,300
What? 

240
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,300
You did that? 

241
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
I did what? 

242
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,900
Wrote on the table. 

243
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,000
- What the fuck? 
- Not funny, man. 

244
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,200
Look, I did not. 

245
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,500
Mother! 

246
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,200
- What the hell does that mean? 
- Mom 

247
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,900
- What? 
- U C. 

248
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Come here! 

249
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
U C. .. 

250
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Mom, you did it? 

251
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,400
No. 

252
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,000
No! 

253
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,500
I did not write it. 

254
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,300
Someone wrote! 

255
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,300
What does it mean? 

256
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,000
Do not you remember doing that? 

257
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,300
No. 

258
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,500
No. 

259
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,900
I do not remember any of it. 

260
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,400
Well, you did. 

261
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,700
I do not remember getting off the bed. 

262
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,300
3:30 in the morning. 

263
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,200
You think I was sleepwalking? 

264
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,800
I mean, never heard of anyone 
sleepwalker and writing at a desk ... 

265
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,000
I do not know, Thomas, not 
I have no idea. 

266
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,100
And you do not know what to write? 

267
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,100
- You do not know what it means? 
- I do not remember being lifted. 

268
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,500
So you do not know what 
the letters on the table mean? 

269
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
No. 

270
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,900
And you took the paper to somewhere. 
You were with the paper in hand. 

271
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,900
Oh, God. 

272
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,600
And that's all. 

273
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,100
It's very bizarre mother. 

274
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,000
Thomas ... 

275
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,400
What's wrong with me? 

276
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,000
There is something wrong with me. 
I do not remember any of it. 

277
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,800
What the hell is happening? 

278
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,400
I'm going crazy! 

279
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Mom, I think it has something 
happening in this house. 

280
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Do not know if there is something wrong with you. 
There is something wrong with this house. 

281
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,700
Where is this doctor? 

282
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,400
Dr. Lauren, I called him several times, 
he is still on vacation. 

283
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,900
And he goes on to say that when you return 
he will come back here as soon as possible. 

284
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,700
He knows what's going on? 
He know what is happening with Samantha? 

285
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,200
Because ... um ... mother ... 

286
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,400
I think she is going crazy with it. 

287
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,900
I increasingly I think all 
has something to do with it. 

288
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,500
I know, of course ... ... I i know. 

289
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,100
- I think you're right. 
- Well, let's ... 

290
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Tomorrow, I think ... 

291
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,100
So let's call this new Dr. Lauren 

292
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,700
and say that he needs to come here 
as soon as possible. 

293
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,500
I'll call him tomorrow morning again. 

294
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Sure. 

295
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,100
Or I'll find someone else. 

296
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,500
OK.

297
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
You okay? 

298
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,900
I'll think of something. 

299
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,200
I'll think of something. 

300
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,600
So I ... 

301
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,500
There is a time, I began to feel like ... 

302
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,000
if something was in the room ... 

303
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,800
me while I slept. 

304
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,500
When I was trying to sleep ... 

305
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,300
And then ... 

306
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,600
a week ago ... 

307
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,400
I woke up for something ... 
I do not know what woke me up ... 

308
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,600
I could not ... 

309
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,900
out of bed. 

310
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,300
I was just ... 

311
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,000
lying there ... 

312
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,600
and I could not sit, 
... I could not 

313
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,000
turn my head to see 
what woke me up ... 

314
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,000
I just ... 

315
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,400
And then it was as if ... 

316
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,300
something came ... 

317
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,900
and pressed ... my chest, very strong. 

318
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,100
It was as if ... 

319
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,500
was holding me, as if ... 
did not want me to move. 

320
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,100
It was very strange, it took everything ... 

321
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,600
I ... 

322
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,200
All energy that I could check for ... 

323
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,900
to sit ... 

324
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,700
and look around the room ... 

325
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,700
It was as if someone was me 
squeezing with one hand ... 

326
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,200
But then ... I got up e. .. 

327
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,800
turned on the lights e. .. 

328
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,300
there was nothing ... 

329
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,800
... I thought I mean ... 
the time I thought I was crazy ... 

330
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,700
and then these other things 
started happening ... 

331
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,200
I just do not understand why 
this is happening to me. 

332
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,200
So this was the first time that happened? 

333
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,500
Yes 

334
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,300
Do you think it will happen again? 

335
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,500
I do not know. 

336
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,300
I do not know, it's like every time I 
go to sleep, I was lying there e. .. 

337
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,900
wanting to sleep, but if I ... 

338
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,900
if I sleep, I'm afraid 
wake up and happen. 

339
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,100
and if I stay up, nothing happens, then ... 

340
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,000
So I did not even sleep e. .. 

341
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,600
I do not know. 

342
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,500
And no one comes out winning. 

343
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,800
Nobody wins. 

344
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,800
Friday Night 
8 October 
2:34 

345
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,900
Tommy! 

346
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,700
Tommy! 

347
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,100
Open the door! 

348
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,000
- Tommy ... stop! 
- Open the door! 

349
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,400
It's okay, I'm here! 

350
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Okay! 

351
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,500
I'm here. 

352
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,700
Ok 

353
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,000
You okay? 

354
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,100
Oh, yes. Hello, Dr. Lauren, here is Ellen Finley e. ..

Probably you are still on vacation 

357
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,900
But I need to talk to you. 

358
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,600
So ... you could call them to hear this message? 

359
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,800
It is very important that I talk to you, OK? 

360
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,200

I'll take your sister for a walk. 

366
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,800
Need something? 

367
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,200
No, okay. 

368
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,700
What? 

369
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,600
Tommy! 

370
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,700
Yes? 

371
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,200
What! 

372
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,600
What you ... 

373
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,600

374
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,900
Sam? 

375
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,900
Tommy! 

376
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,900
Maron. 

377
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,000
Seventh Night 
9 October 
1:22 

378
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,300
Hi, you've reached the Finleys. We can not answer now, 
but if you leave a message, will return. Thank you. 

379
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,900
Ohh mother ... 

380
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,900
What is this?! 

381
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,900
It seems that someone is ... 

382
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
I do not know, I do not know. 

383
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,700
- Come on, all is well. 
- What was that? 

384
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,500
I do not know. 

385
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Hear, hear! 

386
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,800
Go, go! 

387
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,700
Stay behind me. 

388
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,300
We are here, here. 

389
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,600
Oh, my God! Damn! 

390
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,100
Listen! Listen! 

391
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,500
- There is something in the room with us! 
- Oh, my God. 

392
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,100
I can feel, I ... 

393
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,600
- I can feel as if he were standing here! 
- Stop! Stop! 

394
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Listen! 

395
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,600
What the fuck ...?

396
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,400
Listen! 

397
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,000
Guys, what is it? 

398
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,900
You hear it?! 

399
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,000
What the hell is that? 

400
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,300
Look at it ... 

401
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,800
Wait, wait. 

402
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,300
My God! 

403
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,100
Look at it, is a footprint! 

404
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,000
I want to see where he is going. 

405
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
- No! 
- Come on! Okay! 

406
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,000
Thomas, no! No! 

407
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,600
- Stay here, I want to see where he is going! 
- Stop it! 

408
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,900
No! Stop! 

409
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Let me go! 

410
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,700
I just want to see where he is going. 

411
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,400
Stay with me, it's okay! 

412
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,200
All right. 

413
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,500
They are everywhere! 

414
00:38:59,700 --> 00:38:59,800
Come! 

415
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Mother! 

416
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,100
What the fuck ...? 

417
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
Why ... is going to my room?! 

418
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,900
Oh, Jesus! Stop! 

419
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,500
Stop! 

420
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,600
Alright! Okay! 

421
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,100
Sam, come here, come here! 

422
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,100
All right. 

423
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,500
All right, come. 

424
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,700
Ash. 

425
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,600
Oh, Christ. 

426
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,100
Where does it come from? 

427
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,600
Oh, shit! 

428
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,700
Oh, no! 

429
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Fuck! 

430
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,500
Oh, mother ... 

431
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,000
What the fuck? 

432
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,900
Oh, mother ... 

433
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,600
Who was it? 

434
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
Nobody. 

435
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,300
Mother 

436
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,100
Yes 

437
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,500
How are you? 

438
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,500
All right? 

439
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,900
Sam, you okay? 

440
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,300
See ... 

441
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,000
I think it's time to ... think of leaving. 

442
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,900
- And where do we go? 
- I do not know, to a motel for a few nights. 

443
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,500
- This is our home ... 
- I know, Mom, but I do not think ... 

444
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,800
- Where do we go? 
- It's getting ... 

445
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,100
This thing just goes ... us out of our house? 

446
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,700
Mom, I do not know, but I think ... 

447
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,700
I can not ... 

448
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,200
Damn! 

449
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,300
- Mom, I know, but ... 
- By Dr. Lauren not called yet?! 

450
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,100
Do not know! Do not know where he is, 

451
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,400
But until he calls and 
people think of something ... 

452
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,400
I think you should stay 
in a motel for a few nights. 

453
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,400
So? That solves everything? 
The thing will just go away?! 

454
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,600
No, I'm saying this, Mom. 

455
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,300
But until Dr. Lauren comes, you go, 
I stay and take care of everything ... 

456
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,300
I see what happens. 

457
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,200
You'll see what happens? 

458
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,200
I will record what happens. 

459
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,200
I'll keep shooting and see what 
happens while you are away. 

460
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,900
Ok and you'll stay here alone with this thing? 

461
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,500
I want you to be cautelozo, Thomas. 
You know where you're getting into? 

462
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,600
I know, Mom, but ... 

463
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,200
Whatever this thing is, 
it does not seem interested in me. 

464
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,900
And that seems to be interested in it, 
which is another reason for you leave here. 

465
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,300
I know, I'll take it. We will. 

466
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,300
Sam? 

467
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,100
- Sam, you do not want to leave? 
- Ok? 

468
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,100
Sure! 

469
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,500
- Prepare to pack. 
- We go now, but I want you to promise ... 

470
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,900
- That if something bad happens ... 
- Mom, believe me, I promise, trust me. 

471
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,600
I do not want you just film 
I want you to leave here. 

472
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,500
I will. 

473
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,400
Right? Come! Prepare to pack. 

474
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,400
And I want you to call us, 
if anything happens. 

475
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,400
- You'll be okay? Are you sure? 
- I'll be fine. 

476
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,200
- Just go, call me when they arrive. 
- Ok 

477
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,700
I love you. 

478
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,700
I love you too. 

479
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,900
Call me when they arrive. 

480
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,900
Ok 

481
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,500
Be careful, dear. 

482
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,500
You too. 

483
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,700
Camera on. 

484
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,900
And then, asshole! 

485
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,000
Appear. 

486
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,800
Oitva Night 
October 10 
2:28 

487
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,700
Jesus! 

488
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,400
Crap! 

489
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,800
Christ! 

490
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,500
Jesus! 

491
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,500
Crap! 

492
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,000
Oh, shit! 

493
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,700
Hallo. 

494
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,700
Mother? 

495
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,600
Mother, calm down. As well 
they followed you?

496
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,100
Wait, Mom, listen! Just come home, right? 

497
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,700
Just come as fast as you can! 

498
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,200
Just come home. 

499
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,100
Jesus! What the hell happened? 

500
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,200
What happened?!?! 

501
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,800
Oh, Christ! You all right? 

502
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,900
What happened to you? 

503
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,500
- They have followed us to the motel. 
- What do you follow? 

504
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,000
Sam? 

505
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,000
They followed us to the motel, Thomas. 

506
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,500
How could they follow you? 

507
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,400
I do not know. I do not know how they could. 

508
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,100
But it was in the room with the 
people and attacked his sister. 

509
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,000
As well, was in the room with you? 

510
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
- I was in bed with us, Thomas. 
- How it attacked ...? 

511
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,000
Talk to me, you're scaring me ... 

512
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,800
As they attacked? 

513
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,000
Mother? 

514
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
What happened? 

515
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,900
I do not know what happened, Thomas. 

516
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,300
We were just sleeping ... 

517
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,400
I thought everything was ... 
He felt that all was well. 

518
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:39,800
And then ... 

519
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,000
Suddenly I felt that ... 

520
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,600
something was sighing in my ear. 

521
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:54,300
And I woke up and looked at her sister ... 

522
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,300
And she was still asleep. 

523
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,600
But I looked down e. .. 

524
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,300
It seemed that something was ... 

525
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:07,700
holding, pressing her arms. 

526
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,200
So ... 

527
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,700
That threw me off the bed. 

528
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,900
This thing ... 

529
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,400
threw the bed. 

530
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:28,700
I cried ... ... I I could not do anything. 

531
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,200
There was nothing I could do. 

532
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,800
This thing ... we have to do this thing 
go. We must stop this! 

533
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,800
I could not do anything. 

534
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,500
Will be alright. 

535
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,100
There was nothing I could do. 

536
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,400
I'm sorry, honey, I'm sorry. 

537
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:54,600
Thirteenth Night 
October 15 
3:01 

538
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,100
You'll be okay here alone? 

539
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,900
You okay? 

540
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,700
Call me if you need anything. 

541
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,400
Tommy. 

542
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,400
Sam? 

543
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,600
Sam? 

544
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,000
Sam?! 

545
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,800
Samantha! 

546
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,200
What is it? 

547
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,300
Sam? 

548
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:35,900
Sam? 

549
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,300
Sam? 

550
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,300
Samantha! 

551
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,300
Sam. 

552
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,700
Sam! 

553
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,200
Samantha! 

554
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,400
Jesus Christ! Samantha! 

555
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,500
Samantha! 

556
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:45,400
Sam. 

557
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,800
Can you hear me? 

558
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,800
Yes 

559
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,700
I came here. 

560
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,200
How so? 

561
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,000
C'mon, Sam, is freezing here, 
we go down. 

562
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,700
Watch your walk. 

563
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,500
Come on, it's all legal, 
we go down. 

564
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,100
Watch your walk. 

565
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,300
Come on, Sam, is freezing, 
we go down. 

566
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,600
You okay? 

567
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,400
Sam? 

568
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,400
Sam? 

569
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,600
You okay? 

570
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,500
Really? 

571
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,300
Will be alright. 

572
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,000
Hi, I want to talk to Mrs. Mackenzie. 

573
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,300
Mrs. Mackenzie hello, here is Thomas Finley. 

574
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,900
My parents bought their house a few years. 

575
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,000
Sure. Hmm ... 

576
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:22,300
Listen, sorry for taking your time, 
but I wonder if I can help. 

577
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,100
You know, by chance, if someone ... ah ... 

578
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,700
If someone died in this house? 

579
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,900
Someone named Maron? 

580
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,600
Or Marón? 

581
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:39,100
Nobody? Spells as M-A-R-O-N. 
No one with that name? 

582
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,800
Ah ... No, do not worry. 

583
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,600
Thank you. 

584
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,600
Sorry for taking your time. 

585
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:03,800
Sam?! 

586
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,000
Sam! 

587
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,500
Sam! 

588
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,200
What is this thing doing? 

589
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,500
Come here, come here. 

590
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,800
Come here! 

591
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,200
Sam, all right! 

592
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,400
Sam, me, come with me. 

593
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,100
Jesus Christ! 

594
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,100
What the fuck, come here. 

595
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,700
It's all right, right!

596
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:32,700
All right. 

597
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,400
Come, come. 

598
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,500
Sam, I got you. 

599
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,500
I got you, everything is fine. 

600
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,200
Okay, I got you. 

601
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:42,500
Okay. 

602
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,500
Come on, Sam. 

603
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,000
Yes 

604
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,300
Yes, yes. 

605
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,800
She's in bed now. 

606
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,000
Yes 

607
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,500
No, I'm sure. 
This never happened before. 

608
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,700
No, I have no idea. 

609
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,500
He just found it that way. 

610
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,400
Yes 

611
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,100
Well, I mean ... 
Is there something I can do? 

612
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,800
I mean ... should I ... 

613
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,800
You can ... can find someone 
to find out what's going on? 

614
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,900
You can prescribe a remedy 
when I see you tomorrow? 

615
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,700
Sure. 

616
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:44,600
Ok 

617
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,200
I then ... so I hope. 

618
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:53,800
Ok 

619
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,100
Thank you. 

620
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,000
Sam? 

621
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,700
Oh, Jesus Christ. 

622
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:27,600
Mother? 

623
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,700
Oh, Jesus. 

624
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,900
Jesus! Mother! 

625
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,700
Mom, come here. Jesus Christ! 

626
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,700
What a bummer. 

627
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,900
Mom, come on! Come on, Mom, get up. 

628
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,700
Mother, get up. 

629
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,700
Come on, you have to get up. 

630
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,700
Come! 

631
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,300
- It's my fault! 
- Nothing is your fault, Mom. 

632
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,700
Come, it's all right. 

633
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
- I killed her! 
- Mother, you did not kill anyone. 

634
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,700
It will kill her. 

635
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,600
Mother! Nothing will kill her mother. 

636
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,900
Seventeenth Night 
18 October 
4:29 

637
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,200
Jesus Christ! 

638
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,100
What did you do, mother?! 

639
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,600
Oh, my God, what have you done to yourself?! 

640
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,000
Samantha! 

641
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,600
Oh, mother, what did you do? 

642
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,400
Oh, my God. 

643
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,300
Jesus! Mother! 

644
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,300
Samantha! 

645
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,800
Help me Somebody help me! 

646
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,600
Oh, mother, what you did!?!? 

647
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,800
Oh, my God! 

648
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:05,600
Twenty-Third Night 
25 October 
2:51 

649
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,800
Mother 

650
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,700
If you see this ... ah ... 

651
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,300
They said you'll be fine. 

652
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,800
They just need ... 

653
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,600
Heard you for a few days ... 

654
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,700
But ... 

655
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,300
I just like to say I'm sorry. 

656
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,300
I should have listened to you. 

657
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,000
I should be there for you. 

658
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:02,900
And Samantha. 

659
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,200
And I was not. 

660
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,600
I just like to say I'm sorry, Mom. 

661
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,100
I want us to be a family again. 

662
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,100
What's happening? 

663
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,800
Dr. Lauren, hello. 

664
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:03,900
Between. 

665
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,400
This is my sister, Samantha. 

666
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,100
- Hello, Samantha, nice to meet you. 
- Also. 

667
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,400
Thanks for coming. 

668
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,300
If I could come here 
earlier, I would ... 

669
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,600
I want to say how I feel 
from what I heard about your mother. 

670
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,100
How is she? 

671
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,900
She is ... okay. 

672
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,800
She has to stay under observation, but ... 
She'll be fine. 

673
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:28,000
- Well, if I could I would be here before. 
- You can make it stop? 

674
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,700
I'll try. 

675
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,900
Samantha, I understand 
all events here ... 

676
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,000
acontedendo are in your room. 

677
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,300
- Yes 
- Take me there. 

678
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,000
Here. 

679
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,300
Ok 

680
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:04,800
Ok 

681
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,200
First, I want to thank 
the two did not go away. 

682
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,800
Because that would follow. 

683
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:19,000
And probably leave this thing more angry. 

684
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,800
So I think you acted right 
for calling me. 

685
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,300
We just want to make it stop. 

686
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,100
I understand, Sam. 

687
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,100
Same. 

688
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:34,200
But I want to assure them that 
There is an incredible presence in this house. 

689
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,600
It is a very negative presence. 

690
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,700
And it's very attracted to you, Sam. 

691
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:49,400
Now, as I understand it, his mother 
tried to make contact, or believes he made contact ... 

692
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,300
with his father. Is this true? 

693
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,300
Yes 

694
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,300
Ok, now ... 

695
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:00,000
What made her think that she was exposed?

696
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,000
Ah, she was writing him ... 

697
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,800
She was writing to him and then ... 

698
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,500
she thought he was responding. 

699
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,000
Ok Well, that ... 
This is quite common, because when ... 

700
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,300
when someone loses a loved one ... 

701
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,600
and try to make contact with this person ... 

702
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,400
They sometimes do not know ... 

703
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,300
Invite an obscure entity. 

704
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:30,300
It's like an open door, so to speak. 

705
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,100
A free pass. 

706
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,300
And most of the time is that this entity 

707
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:44,000
personifies ... and takes the place of that loved one ... 

708
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,700
to enter our world. 

709
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,300
For some reason. Ok? 

710
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,300
And in this case ... 

711
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,400
I believe ... 

712
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,300
Sam is the reason. 

713
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,800
Ok Then ... 

714
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:11,000
Before we begin, I want you to know ... 
I want you to think ... 

715
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:15,900
Is there anything I have forgotten. 
Anything that can tell me. 

716
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,500
I just wanted ... 
show it. 

717
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:21,900
We do not know what it means. 

718
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,100
Ok 

719
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,400
Maron ... 

720
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,800
is Germanic for "nightmare". 

721
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:39,300
Ok? In Germanic folklore ... 

722
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,900
a nightmare is an evil spirit ... 

723
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,100
attacking women while they sleep. 

724
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,600
Much like the Christian Incubus ... 

725
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,400
that violent women. 

726
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:56,700
Ok? 

727
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Now, before you start, I just want to ... 

728
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,200
are extremely, extremly clean. 

729
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:14,800
And I have 100% of your attention 
and its concentration. 

730
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,000
Yes 

731
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:19,000
Sam? 

732
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:20,200
Ok 

733
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,300
Samantha! 

734
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,700
Samantha! 

735
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,400
Oh, my God, damn! 

736
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,800
Oh, Samantha! 

737
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,300
Samantha! 

738
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,600
Samantha! 

739
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:53,900
Samantha! 

740
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,200
Samantha! 

741
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,700
Oh, my God! 

742
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,100
Oh, my God! 

743
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,300
Samantha, oh my God! 

744
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,800
Samantha! 

745
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,000
Oh, my ... Oh, my God! 

746
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,500
Oh, my God! 

747
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:55,400
On October 25, the bodies were 
removed from the residence of Finleys. 

748
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:01,000
The body of Samantha Finley was found 
dead in the arms of his brother. 

749
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:07,400
With the news of the death of their children, 
Ellen Finley took his own life in hospital. 

750
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:13,800
It is the opinion of the people closest 
Finley family that this video is shown to the public 

751
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:20,000
as a final testimony of 
inexplicable and terrible events 
occurred in their Finleys.
