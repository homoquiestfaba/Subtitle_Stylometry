1
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:53,289
Okay, ladies.

2
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,697
God, this place
gives me the creeps.

3
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,598
Where is the freakin' thing?

4
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,566
There.

5
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:07,702
You've got twenty minutes.

6
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:08,703
Whatever.

7
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,984
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

8
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:27,820
Shit.

9
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:30,222
Everything okay?

10
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:35,661
All good.
We're coming.

11
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,617
Okay.

12
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:04,487
Yeah, towards me.
Good, got it.

13
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:07,055
Hold it.
Great.

14
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,356
Got it?

15
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:14,496
All right, I got it.

16
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:16,830
Easy.
Gently.

17
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:34,781
GRAND PIANO

18
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:43,955
Please remain in your seats and
keep your seatbelts fastened.

19
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,357
Jesus!

20
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:48,192
I feel you, kid.
Flying?

21
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,529
Flying used to scare the
bejesus out of me too.

22
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,297
Come on. Come on.

23
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:57,867
I travel a lot and let me tell you,
a beat-up Civic on a bunch of back roads,

24
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:00,670
it just doesn't cut it anymore.
You know what I mean, right?

25
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:04,274
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be landing

26
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:06,442
as scheduled in Chicago O'Hare
after all.

27
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,044
- Are we landing?
- Of course we're landing.

28
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:10,846
These things are built to last.

29
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:12,614
I'm screwed.

30
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,417
Excuse me?

31
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,286
Well, what did you expect, Tom?

32
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:20,087
I don't know. Chicago things.

33
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:25,026
Rain, wind, one of the wings falling off.
Everyone else got diverted.

34
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,460
I know, life just isn't fair.

35
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,465
- Well, your limo could crash.
- You're right. There's still hope.

36
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:36,570
After all these years maybe the piano's
so out of tune they have to reschedule.

37
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:39,104
Or I could just take a blowtorch
to the damn thing.

38
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:41,173
Or you could just cancel.

39
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:44,910
Wait.
What do you mean, the limo?

40
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:46,278
I thought you were picking me up.

41
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,815
No. I'm at the hotel. I still have
the press conference. Remember?

42
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:54,752
Don't you see a guy with your name
on a thing? I left you a voicemail.

43
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:57,721
You mean some stranger's picking me up?
What happened to...?

44
00:06:57,723 --> 00:07:00,691
Ashley and Wayne
are meeting me here.

45
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:03,060
Actually, they're just downstairs.
Are you going to want to say hi?

46
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:06,830
They probably don't even know
what a classical concert is.

47
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:10,266
You can explain it to them
yourself when you see them.

48
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:11,534
Ah, shoot me.

49
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:15,271
Tell them I said hi,
thanks for coming, all that.

50
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:19,074
Christ, I doubt they'll be able to
make it through the whole show.

51
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:20,275
- Come on.
- What?

52
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:24,613
My agency didn't get them balcony seats.
Ashley's going to flip.

53
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,982
I have to go right now, so just...

54
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:29,183
No, it's okay.
Thanks.

55
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:31,051
Hold on one second, okay?

56
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:31,886
Hi!

57
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,321
He wants to talk to you.

58
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,890
Hey!
Emma!

59
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:37,690
Hi.
Emma!

60
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,327
Holy crap, girl.
You look hot!

61
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:43,396
Thank you.
You look beautiful, too.

62
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,332
Do not put me on
the phone with her.

63
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:49,301
- It's just for work.
- Oh, fancy.

64
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,970
So what's the deal?
Is he coming here?

65
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:56,875
Because I know the bartender at Fridos
and it's 50% off top shots.

66
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,977
Tom needs to go straight
to the theater.

67
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:03,681
- What happened to pre-gaming?
- It's a classical concert, Ash.

68
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,384
So that means
it's better if Tom is not drunk.

69
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:10,620
We can just post-game. Yeah?

70
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:12,055
Hang on, just one more second.

71
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:14,524
I got you something.
I packed it in your carry-on.

72
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:15,659
What?

73
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,695
It's just a little gift. Welcome
to the twenty-first century.

74
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:21,635
Tell me again,
why you did all this?

75
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,199
Because it's about time
you got back onstage.

76
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:25,301
Hold on a sec.

77
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,812
- Hey, are you still there?
- Yeah.

78
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:41,648
- Are you wearing the tuxedo?
- Should I be?

79
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,583
You're late, Tom.

80
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:47,154
Just skip the hotel and go
straight to the auditorium, okay?

81
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:50,222
Are you biting your nails?

82
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:52,191
No.

83
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:54,493
I love you.

84
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:56,028
Love you, too.

85
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:17,481
Where are we heading to, sir?

86
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,900
- Twenty-first century...
- Sorry, sir?

87
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:41,802
No...

88
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:43,337
Sorry.

89
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,721
- Hello?
- Tom Selznick?

90
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,723
- Mark from A&V.
- Hi, Mark.

91
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:09,027
When Marjorie says: "Tom, what's on
your mind right now?", that's your cue.

92
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,028
- You got it?
- Yeah, I think so.

93
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:12,330
Good. Okay, stay there.

94
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:15,767
Three, two, one...

95
00:10:16,568 --> 00:10:20,203
So you're not confirming
any rumors tonight?

96
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:23,373
Well, I did audition.
I can't say more than that.

97
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:26,209
Emma Selznick still auditions?

98
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:28,444
When it comes to musicals,
I guess.

99
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:32,448
So we're going to hear you
sing for the first time, then?

100
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,117
Come on, I've said
too much already.

101
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:39,020
I sing all the time. At home,
in the shower... Ask my husband!

102
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:42,724
Well, in fact, we do have your
wonder boy on the other side.

103
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:46,528
Thanks for your time. It's always a
pleasure to speak with you, Emma.

104
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:48,002
My pleasure.

105
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:51,565
Tom Selznick, brightest
piano player of his generation

106
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,335
married to the brightest movie
star of her generation, is back.

107
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:58,137
It's been five years
since he retired from the stage,

108
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:01,974
but in a matter of minutes, this
long hiatus will be history.

109
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:05,945
I must admit I would not like
to be in Tom's shoes tonight.

110
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:07,847
- Tom, how are you doing?
- Hello?

111
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:11,983
Tom, what's going
through your head right now?

112
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:14,186
- Are you nervous?
- What?

113
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:17,055
Well, you're reuniting
with the F.C.O Philharmonic

114
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:20,624
to play several
notoriously difficult pieces.

115
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,761
You must have had a couple
of bad nights lately.

116
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:24,795
No.

117
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:30,667
Right. And what is the significance
of the piano you'll be playing tonight?

118
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,469
- It's Patrick's piano.
- Right.

119
00:11:32,703 --> 00:11:36,039
I spent months, years,
practicing with him, so...

120
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:38,340
- Yes.
- It's in his memory that I...

121
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:41,043
Patrick Godureaux.
Our listeners probably know him

122
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:45,681
as the eccentric music magnate
with the missing family fortune, but...

123
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:48,950
Well, to me he was more than that.
He was also a mentor.

124
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:53,121
What I mean is, what is
the piano's significance to you?

125
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:56,457
- What do you mean?
- "La Cinquette".

126
00:11:56,892 --> 00:11:59,126
The unplayable piece, right?

127
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,929
"La Cinquette".
Am I mispronouncing it?

128
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:06,233
I mean, you have a history
with this piece.

129
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:08,068
Five years ago,
at the Flannery...

130
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:10,569
- That didn't really work out.
- Right.

131
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:11,937
So my question is this.

132
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:15,674
You return to the stage after
all these years of silence.

133
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:18,244
Are you nervous
about playing the same piano?

134
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:21,279
- Are you nervous about
choking again? - Choking?

135
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,016
Do you see this as your last
chance at glorious redemption,

136
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:27,852
- your one shot to forever...?
- Stop!

137
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,321
Sorry. Look...

138
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,657
I play piano.

139
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,927
This is just another gig,
nothing else.

140
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:40,930
Ha-ha. Alright, Mr. Selznick.
That's about all we have time for.

141
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:42,632
You break a leg!

142
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,201
Oh, shoot me.

143
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,690
Sir, do you think you could
pull it around to the back door?

144
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,592
- Sir.
- Thanks.

145
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,549
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

146
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:41,551
Excuse me, are you Tom Selznick?

147
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,053
Yeah.

148
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,521
Break a leg!

149
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,589
Thanks.

150
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:02,403
Selznick!

151
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:03,938
Welcome back.

152
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:10,410
Hey, Tommy. Big show.

153
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:12,679
Thanks. You're looking well.

154
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,615
Yeah. Got divorced!

155
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:17,284
Tom! You're alive!

156
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,885
What, you miss the cold sweat?

157
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,121
Hey, do you know
where Norman is?

158
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:26,425
Yeah, just head down here, turn left.
He's stuck to the catering.

159
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:28,594
He quit smoking again?

160
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:32,097
Kind of. But don't talk to him
about it, trust me.

161
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:34,432
Hey! Break a leg!

162
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,145
Sir!

163
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:50,246
Your chart.

164
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:54,651
And may I just add how exciting
it is to have you back on-stage.

165
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:55,551
Tommy!

166
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:56,519
Thank you.

167
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:58,187
Come here!

168
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:00,822
- How's the great Tom Selznick?
- Hey, Norman.

169
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,125
Are you okay?
How was your flight?

170
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:05,127
Oh, my God, who dressed you?

171
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:08,163
- Thank god you landed on time.
- Yeah, thank God.

172
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:12,500
- Oh, is it...? - No. Not a scratch.
It's perfect.

173
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:15,069
Well, that's a relief.
Did you check it out?

174
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,072
- Lower C natural is a little sharp.
- It always was.

175
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:20,540
Other than that, she's beautiful.
It's a shame we can't keep her.

176
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:25,111
Frank, you've gotta take first part tonight,
Carl's sick. Not a problem, right?

177
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:31,216
Who are those guys? CIA?

178
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:34,219
Nothing that interesting.
Insurance guys. Very serious.

179
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:37,089
Patrick loved that piano more
than he loved his own family.

180
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:38,057
Clearly.

181
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:39,290
Assholes!

182
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,694
Very funny.

183
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:45,029
Seriously. Assholes.

184
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:47,832
Even in five years,
haven't you forgot?

185
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,873
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

186
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:55,205
Because that kind of put me in
the mood to make some heads roll.

187
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,807
Really.
I'm fine.

188
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,644
Jesus, look at Patrick!

189
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:05,247
Jesus, Patrick,
you're terrifying.

190
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:06,682
He still scares me.

191
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:08,984
Did you hear about
the whole fortune thing?

192
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:12,554
I swear to God he thought
he was Charles Foster Kane.

193
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,858
Do you really think he'd want me
playing his precious piano again?

194
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:19,593
The great screw-up?

195
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:21,295
What?

196
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:24,965
Patrick. He'd be embarrassed.

197
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:29,203
- Tom... - Come on,
I always flubbed notes.

198
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:33,473
Tom Selznick, the new Rachmaninoff...
if only he didn't choke.

199
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:36,275
Tommy, listen to me.

200
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,644
- Patrick would be proud of you.
- No.

201
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:41,313
I'm gonna screw up, Norman.
I know it.

202
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:46,051
You can't play charts like these without
fudging a note here and there. So what?

203
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:49,387
If you're going to start playing carefully,
I'll just go get the wine and cheese.

204
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:52,857
Do you want to be the thousandth
guy to give me a respectable Bach?

205
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:55,626
Because you can keep that.
I don't need respectable.

206
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:59,196
If you're going to play music this dense,
you're going to hit a wrong note.

207
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:00,830
And they won't know.

208
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:03,066
They never do.

209
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:08,638
And you know what? I've never
seen so many people this excited.

210
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,406
They've waited for this
for five years.

211
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:11,907
I could have
waited another five.

212
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:12,841
Really?

213
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:17,079
I have never in my life met another
human being so perfectly shaped

214
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:19,081
for one purpose.

215
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:24,018
Do what you do.

216
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:26,754
And try and have some fun.

217
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:29,357
And remember...

218
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:33,293
It's just music.

219
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,862
Ladies and gentlemen,

220
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:40,166
the main entrance doors
are about to be closed.

221
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,537
Ashley!
Wayne!

222
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,240
Hey, you guys!
I thought I'd lost you.

223
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:51,609
I'm sorry, honey. We were at the bar.
It was Happy Hour.

224
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:53,978
I called you six times.

225
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,882
- Oh my God. Wayne, where is my phone?
- Yeah, it's right here.

226
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,451
- We should get going.
- Yeah, 6 missed calls.

227
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:02,119
Yeah? Yeah, you think?

228
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:03,854
Pay more attention.
Okay, honey?

229
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:05,589
We really should get in there.

230
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:08,091
Emma, calm down.
Just can just slip in.

231
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:11,027
What a guy doesn't know
doesn't hurt him.

232
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:14,230
Here are your tickets.
I'll meet you guys right after, okay?

233
00:18:14,498 --> 00:18:17,400
Wait.
Are we not sitting with you?

234
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:19,335
Oh, God... No.

235
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:22,404
They really need me to sit
in this one particular place.

236
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:24,973
But I got you really good seats,
they're in the orchestra.

237
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:27,375
So we're not sitting with you?

238
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:32,513
But I'm going to meet you right after.
Ashley, I'm so glad you could come.

239
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:36,884
It's our pleasure. I mean, you're the
closest Wayne gets to a celebrity.

240
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:38,619
Let's go.

241
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:41,821
Okay. Enjoy the show.
I'll see you guys after.

242
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:44,824
Well, that was embarrassing.

243
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:45,892
Come on, doofus.

244
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:50,429
I don't know what all the rushing is about.
Don't they have an opening act?

245
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:20,322
Ladies and gentlemen,

246
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:22,925
the show will start
in five minutes.

247
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:25,494
Please, silence your phones.

248
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:27,630
Mission accomplished.

249
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:35,303
I knew it! Look, there are
plenty of seats up there.

250
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:39,574
Hey, boys and girls, come on!
It's five minutes!

251
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:43,243
Get your weapons ready.
Let's go! Yeah, yeah, come on!

252
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,713
Lynn, sorry!

253
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:09,901
Can you hear me?

254
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:12,836
Okay, yeah...

255
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:14,705
One second...

256
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:17,641
And... we're in.

257
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:05,150
Ladies and gentlemen,

258
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:09,521
introducing tonight's conductor,
Mr. Norman Reisinger.

259
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,609
Sir.

260
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:36,045
- Your score.
- What?

261
00:21:36,813 --> 00:21:39,015
You left it
in the dressing room.

262
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,917
Thanks. You just saved my life.

263
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:44,486
Anything you need.

264
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:47,422
Congratulations.

265
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,858
The whole place is packed.

266
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,697
Thought you would like
to hear that.

267
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:30,760
Ladies and gentlemen...

268
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:32,062
Shit.

269
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:34,030
Tom Selznick.

270
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:47,304
Assholes.

271
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:02,317
I think he's looking at you.

272
00:27:26,027 --> 00:27:27,227
No, I have to go.

273
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:26,234
What?

274
00:29:30,873 --> 00:29:31,940
No!

275
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:53,025
Get back on-stage.

276
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:54,226
Who is this?

277
00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:56,862
I'm Patrick Godureaux.

278
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,265
Got your attention?
Good.

279
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:04,035
Now get back on stage,
your audience is getting antsy.

280
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,238
- You think I don't know what you're up to?
- What am I up to?

281
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,374
- Did Norman put you up to this?
- Norman? I don't follow.

282
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,043
Look, I get it. It's funny.

283
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,080
The stage-fright guy. You send him messages
because you think he's wetting his pants.

284
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,448
- Are you?
- No.

285
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,684
Would you like me
to change that?

286
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,919
- Listen to me!
- Are you sure this is a prank?

287
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:27,389
Let's have a bet. I'll bet
it's not a prank. You bet it is.

288
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:32,228
If I win, I get to spray Emma Selznick's
brains all over her Gucci purse.

289
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:34,696
If you win,
you get to tell me off.

290
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:37,031
Come on, this'll be a fun bet.
Let's do it.

291
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,801
- I'm calling the cops.
- My friend is outside the theater.

292
00:30:40,102 --> 00:30:42,536
He sees so much
as one cop car pull into the lot

293
00:30:42,837 --> 00:30:46,406
and the ushers will have a corpse
to clean up in box seat five.

294
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:49,977
Now head to the left side
of the stage. Now.

295
00:31:08,728 --> 00:31:10,428
In front of you.

296
00:31:11,197 --> 00:31:12,663
The top step.

297
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:14,665
I see it.

298
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:16,534
Look closely.

299
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:21,438
Keep looking.

300
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:25,408
That's the entry wound
of a Rochester .47

301
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,645
automatic with scope laser aim
and silencer.

302
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:32,748
The most precise weapon
on the market. And the quietest.

303
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,284
Now you know the meaning
of "stage-fright".

304
00:31:35,552 --> 00:31:38,020
Get on-stage
or it's Emma's head.

305
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,959
Does this mean we have
an understanding? Say it.

306
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:47,795
Quietly. They'll just think
you're talking to yourself.

307
00:31:48,063 --> 00:31:51,532
Another 'tee-ta-taa',
or whatever the hell you do.

308
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:57,837
Okay. Here are the rules. I can
see and hear everything you do.

309
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:00,340
Call for help
and I will hear it.

310
00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:03,075
Leave the stage
and I will see it.

311
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,078
Get a cop or a guard involved,
I will know it.

312
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,281
If you do any of these things,
your wife will die.

313
00:32:09,783 --> 00:32:13,918
If you play a wrong note, you will no
longer be of any use to me and you will die.

314
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:17,755
That's two people I can kill
when and if I feel like it.

315
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:21,826
So I'm hoping that's double
the chance you'll do what I say.

316
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,061
Do you see me?

317
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:32,302
- How are you talking to me?
- Look at the keys.

318
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:34,870
Your entrance is in two bars.

319
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:39,208
Come in late and it'll be
the last downbeat you ever play.

320
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,818
- Now you can talk.
- Where are you?

321
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,887
In a solo box seat. I have
privacy here. A great view, too.

322
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:54,622
- How are you talking to me?
- I'm high up.

323
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:58,459
Not only can I see everything you
do, I can see everything Emma does.

324
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,594
Right now she's yawning.
I think she's bored.

325
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:02,796
This isn't really
her type of music, is it?

326
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:05,031
- Does that upset you?
- What do you want from me?

327
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,667
I want you to keep
your voice down.

328
00:33:08,702 --> 00:33:11,571
We wouldn't want the audience
getting the wrong idea.

329
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:14,940
But something tells me
this time you won't.

330
00:33:15,508 --> 00:33:18,443
- I'll give you all the money I have.
- I don't want your money.

331
00:33:18,445 --> 00:33:19,911
Then what?

332
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:24,649
I want you to play the most
flawless concert of your life.

333
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:29,520
Consider me the voice in your head telling
you that good is not good enough tonight.

334
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:32,556
Okay. Fine. We can do this.

335
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:34,724
But you don't need Emma.

336
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:36,459
There, it's done.

337
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:38,928
- What's done?
- What you asked.

338
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:44,967
You made a good point, she was
muddling things, so I shot her.

339
00:33:47,337 --> 00:33:51,106
Not sure if you believe me
or you saw how quiet I can be.

340
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:53,008
And your lovely wife
could've just slumped over

341
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:56,577
and fallen asleep,
she was so goddamned bored.

342
00:33:57,813 --> 00:34:00,548
Isn't it amazing what you can
get away with in a crowded theater

343
00:34:00,783 --> 00:34:03,283
when all eyes are on the stage?

344
00:34:05,987 --> 00:34:08,789
Sit down or I
really will shoot her.

345
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:13,526
Come on.
Isn't this what you wanted?

346
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:18,164
You said yourself she was a muddler.
Muddling your whole life, it seems.

347
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:21,334
- You don't know anything.
- But I do, Tom.

348
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:26,771
She might get more magazine covers
than you, but you are a person of note.

349
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,409
She won't be in the
history books. You will.

350
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:36,714
Because you're a person of note.

351
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:38,782
I know everything
I need to know about you.

352
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:43,187
I know where you leave your phone.
I know you mutter when you play.

353
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,724
I know you have the fastest, most
agile fingers of any pianist alive.

354
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:51,761
And you know what's funny? She'd throw
it all away, the fame and the money,

355
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:54,429
for just a tenth of your talent.

356
00:34:54,864 --> 00:34:58,200
Please, let her go.
I'll do what you want.

357
00:34:58,468 --> 00:35:02,637
You think you can bargain with
me? You're not in control, Tom.

358
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,872
The audience is in control.

359
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,943
And right now,
I'm your audience.

360
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,626
Thank you.

361
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:29,762
Thank you.

362
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:31,163
Thank you.

363
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:34,766
Thank you.

364
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:39,871
I know that it's not customary
to speak between movements,

365
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:43,074
but please understand
that, as a conductor,

366
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:47,077
I sometimes just need to hear
the sound of my own voice.

367
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,449
Tonight we're offering you one of
Patrick Godureaux's favorite pieces:

368
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,284
Stephan Yeranosian's
Piano Concerto No. 4,

369
00:35:55,552 --> 00:35:58,387
which is the perfect vehicle
for reuniting all of us

370
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:01,524
with one of the world's greatest
living pianists...

371
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,291
Wake up, Tom.

372
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,692
...whose genius
wowed Godureaux himself.

373
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:08,363
The one and only Tom Selznick.

374
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:17,805
I almost forgot! I'm sorry, Tom,
I'll get back to you in a second.

375
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:20,207
As if this venue
weren't unique enough,

376
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:24,143
let me tell you something about
the piano that Tom is playing.

377
00:36:24,445 --> 00:36:26,746
This customized
Imperial Boesenndorfer

378
00:36:27,214 --> 00:36:31,017
with eight full octaves
belonged to Patrick himself.

379
00:36:31,752 --> 00:36:36,087
This is the first time this piano
has been on a stage anywhere.

380
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:37,722
Sadly, we don't get to keep it.

381
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:42,294
Tonight when we're finished, this piano
is on an 11 PM plane to Switzerland,

382
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:44,628
which is probably not what the
board of directors thought I meant

383
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:48,933
when I assured them that tonight they
would see this instrument take flight.

384
00:36:52,103 --> 00:36:56,739
Patrick's passing this last year
was a blow to all of us.

385
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:02,178
I would therefore like to dedicate this
evening's performance to his memory.

386
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:05,614
I would also like to thank
the lovely Emma Selznick...

387
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,484
...for helping bring
everything together.

388
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,123
I'm sure they could have
had room for us up there.

389
00:37:16,391 --> 00:37:18,459
And to really showcase
what this instrument can do,

390
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:22,797
tonight Tom will be finishing the
evening, sans orchestra, with...

391
00:37:23,232 --> 00:37:27,934
No, not that infamous piece. I think
we've all heard enough about that.

392
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:31,538
With Beethoven's
"Tempest" Sonata.

393
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:34,273
One of Patrick's favorites

394
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:35,808
But first things first.

395
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:41,714
Ladies and gentleman, the second movement
of Yeranosian's Piano Concerto No. 4.

396
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:48,319
What are you waiting for?

397
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:41,668
Are you there? I want to talk.

398
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:44,403
I'd rather you play
than talk, Tom.

399
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:09,125
Are you freaking kidding me?

400
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,727
I'm looking for it, Ash...

401
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:13,863
Everyone is looking at us.
Turn it off.

402
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:15,731
Hurry up.

403
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,634
Hello?

404
00:39:19,636 --> 00:39:20,803
What?

405
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:23,138
Wayne, I swear to God...

406
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:29,210
Tom?

407
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:31,546
Turn the damn thing off!

408
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:33,047
Tom?

409
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:34,082
Can you hear me, Tom?

410
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:37,217
I wanna know why you've got
a gun pointed at Emma.

411
00:39:39,153 --> 00:39:40,287
Let me see who called.

412
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:44,458
I apologize. I know you'd rather
have everything only pointed at you.

413
00:40:03,242 --> 00:40:07,011
You're doing an excellent job.
Soon you'll be ready for what's next.

414
00:40:07,545 --> 00:40:11,949
- What? What's next?
- You'll find out. Be patient.

415
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,283
It's obviously Emma.

416
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,051
Probably by mistake.

417
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:19,689
No, it was a man's voice.

418
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:24,060
Tom is on the stage playing the
piano. There is no way he called you.

419
00:40:24,062 --> 00:40:25,560
He's saying something.
He's talking.

420
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:29,031
He is not talking,
he's counting.

421
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:30,899
It's what musicians do.

422
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,935
Shush! I'm trying to listen
to the music.

423
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,604
Excuse me!

424
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:39,774
You do not shush me.

425
00:40:40,075 --> 00:40:42,309
- I've got to go to the bathroom.
- Wayne!

426
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,199
What was that, Tom?

427
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,735
- What the hell was that?
- My watch.

428
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:14,005
Your watch? What about it?

429
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,006
An alarm.

430
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:23,346
An alarm? You expect me to believe you'd
let your alarm go off during a show?

431
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,915
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake?

432
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:27,450
It's been 5 years.
I forgot to turn it off.

433
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:28,784
I hope you're telling the truth.

434
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,152
Tom? Hello?

435
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,122
Don't open your mouth again
unless it's to count.

436
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,056
Hi, Tom.

437
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,826
I just got a call from
you and... I mean...

438
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:39,594
Aren't you on stage right now?

439
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:41,296
Stop fidgeting, Tom.

440
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:46,700
Anyway, I heard something
kind of odd and I...

441
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:49,937
I'm going to try you again.

442
00:42:04,718 --> 00:42:06,051
What are you doing?

443
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:09,254
Stop playing with your music.

444
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:18,529
Wayne!

445
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:19,797
Come back here!

446
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:21,031
Wayne!

447
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:29,139
Oh, my God.

448
00:43:22,822 --> 00:43:24,155
Excuse me!

449
00:43:24,423 --> 00:43:25,722
May I help you?

450
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,491
- Do you work here?
- Yeah.

451
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,962
- There's a situation.
- A situation?

452
00:43:34,632 --> 00:43:37,333
I got this from
the man on stage.

453
00:43:39,503 --> 00:43:44,207
- If this is a joke, it's not funny.
- I swear it's not. Not from me.

454
00:43:45,275 --> 00:43:48,109
Come with me now.
We'll talk to security.

455
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:51,947
It's probably a prank.
But you never know.

456
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:16,735
Tom, I have a surprise for you.
Look above your head.

457
00:44:17,337 --> 00:44:18,403
Watch carefully.

458
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:25,776
I want you to see this.

459
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,886
No!

460
00:44:35,187 --> 00:44:37,254
Keep it together.
Keep playing, Tom.

461
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:40,156
If you don't pull it together
in one second, you'll be shot.

462
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:42,626
Keep your fingers on the piano
and your mind on the music.

463
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,794
This will teach you
how to focus. Steady!

464
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:49,965
Good.

465
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:55,371
Now make your conductor think
everything's okay or he'll be next.

466
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,810
Tom? Feeling better?

467
00:45:02,812 --> 00:45:05,079
Why? Why did you kill him?

468
00:45:05,347 --> 00:45:07,180
You've never seen a dead body
before, have you?

469
00:45:07,649 --> 00:45:10,918
How did you think you could be a great
artist with so little life experience?

470
00:45:11,386 --> 00:45:15,422
I've taught you in a way Patrick
never could, which means you're ready.

471
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:16,589
What?

472
00:45:16,857 --> 00:45:18,724
"La Cinquette".

473
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:21,160
Remember it?

474
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:22,228
What about it?

475
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:28,099
"The Unplayable Piece". Except there's
a few people who can play it. Am I right?

476
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,670
Who can move their fingers that
fast and spread them that wide.

477
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:34,406
One of them died last summer.
The other is you.

478
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:36,840
No. I can't play it.
It's been five years.

479
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:39,443
Well, here's your chance
to put the meltdown behind you.

480
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:43,180
Here's your chance to show all of those
who laughed at you, who pitied you,

481
00:45:43,182 --> 00:45:44,148
what you're really capable of.

482
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,983
Listen to me. You don't
understand. I can't play it.

483
00:45:47,151 --> 00:45:48,952
Why? Because you froze?

484
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,322
Because you've never been as terrified
as you were that night on stage?

485
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:56,158
Because those last four bars have
haunted you every day of your life since?

486
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:57,492
I don't know it by heart.

487
00:45:57,494 --> 00:46:00,629
Which is why I had my assistant
put it in your folder.

488
00:46:00,863 --> 00:46:04,633
I've planned this well, Tom.
I have faith in you.

489
00:46:06,268 --> 00:46:09,837
More than it seems
Emma ever did.

490
00:46:10,272 --> 00:46:12,840
Holding your hand, orchestrating
your return to the stage

491
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:16,609
just so she doesn't feel so bad
about hogging the spotlight from you.

492
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:20,213
Admit it. You're bitter
she's become a success.

493
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:25,719
and all I'm doing is offering you a
chance to become your own man again.

494
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:31,490
In time, you'll learn to be
grateful. But for now, focus on this.

495
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:33,759
The final four bars
of "La Cinquette".

496
00:46:34,027 --> 00:46:36,961
Play them to perfection
for the first time in your life

497
00:46:36,963 --> 00:46:39,063
and you walk out of here alive.

498
00:46:39,065 --> 00:46:40,398
"La Cinquette".

499
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,869
- I threw it out before the show.
- That was a stupid thing to do.

500
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:47,904
- Play it by memory then.
- You know I can't.

501
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:51,441
That's why you stuck it in there. That's
why you needed me to have sheet music.

502
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:54,077
Too bad for Emma. You'll be
better off without her anyway.

503
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,179
No! You don't have another copy?

504
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,415
Why should I?
That's why I've got you.

505
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,751
Wait! I remember, the janitor...

506
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,986
He saw me throw it to
the ground. He must have it.

507
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:07,355
In that case, he's about to throw
"La Cinquette" into the trash.

508
00:47:07,623 --> 00:47:10,925
- Can't you pick it up?
- Trust me, you want me up here.

509
00:47:11,694 --> 00:47:14,195
What about someone else?
Maybe your assistant?

510
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:16,031
I believe he's busy.

511
00:47:34,248 --> 00:47:38,150
When it's intermission, get the score.
And try not to get any more people killed.

512
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:53,697
Wayne?

513
00:48:02,773 --> 00:48:03,940
Wayne?

514
00:48:08,945 --> 00:48:10,279
Oh, my God!

515
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:11,380
I'm sorry.

516
00:48:11,382 --> 00:48:14,783
It's okay. I get confused
all the time around here.

517
00:48:14,785 --> 00:48:16,151
- I'll get it.
- Don't worry.

518
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:07,363
What are you waiting for?

519
00:49:12,836 --> 00:49:15,204
- Where am I going?
- The stairs.

520
00:49:15,206 --> 00:49:17,005
Turn left at the bottom.

521
00:49:18,407 --> 00:49:20,876
Tom, the stairs.

522
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:26,448
Three doors down.

523
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:29,216
What? Where?

524
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,652
Left and left.

525
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:46,633
Excuse me! Sir! Wait!

526
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,701
Wait! No, don't! No! No! No!

527
00:49:52,372 --> 00:49:54,406
Hey, what is wrong?

528
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,774
What is wrong?

529
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:58,442
- He threw the score out.
- That's a shame.

530
00:49:58,444 --> 00:50:00,645
Wait! I have a copy at home.

531
00:50:00,913 --> 00:50:02,914
I could get someone
to go get it.

532
00:50:03,215 --> 00:50:05,750
- I think you know what this means.
- Wait!

533
00:50:09,287 --> 00:50:11,054
Wait. I have an idea.

534
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:24,667
- Is there a problem?
- It's fine, I'll be right back, I promise.

535
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:26,302
Back him up.

536
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:32,440
Can you hear me?
Where the hell are you?

537
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:34,609
Are you speaking with me
or to the kid?

538
00:50:34,877 --> 00:50:36,878
- Go straight to his dressing room.
- What?

539
00:50:37,178 --> 00:50:40,547
Go to his dressing room and
don't let him out of your sight.

540
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:41,815
On my way.

541
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,056
I love your dress.
You're shiny.

542
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:53,426
Emma? Over here.

543
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,332
Excuse me. Thank you.

544
00:51:02,902 --> 00:51:04,903
I hope you're enjoying it.

545
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:08,372
Emma, a picture of
you and me, please.

546
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:51,745
Do you have him?
Don't tell me you've lost him.

547
00:51:52,046 --> 00:51:54,047
No. I've got him.

548
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:57,349
- Careful. Emma's leaving the theater.
- And?

549
00:51:57,617 --> 00:52:00,252
- Follow her.
- I can't be in two places at once.

550
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:21,438
So, what do you want me to do?

551
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,739
Go for her.

552
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,175
"Go for her. "

553
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:30,246
Your wish is my command...
Asshole.

554
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,285
Mrs. Selznick! Mrs. Selznick...

555
00:52:38,587 --> 00:52:40,088
Go ask her.

556
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:43,658
Can I take a picture with you?

557
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:55,169
Ladies and gentlemen,

558
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:58,471
please do make sure
your cell phones are on silent.

559
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:05,011
Ladies and gentlemen, please
do make sure your cell phones

560
00:53:05,279 --> 00:53:06,813
are on silent.

561
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:12,651
Honey?

562
00:53:13,853 --> 00:53:14,786
Emma!

563
00:53:14,788 --> 00:53:18,356
I hope we're not interrupting,
Mr. Selznick. She insisted.

564
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:20,358
- I don't mean to be a problem.
- Oh, no.

565
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,027
Not every day I've got
two celebrities to take care of.

566
00:53:23,762 --> 00:53:25,996
He's such a lifesaver
for bringing me down here.

567
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:27,688
She's something.

568
00:53:27,723 --> 00:53:31,134
I just wanted to come and say
what a great job you're doing.

569
00:53:31,136 --> 00:53:33,636
Really,
you're playing so beautifully.

570
00:53:43,546 --> 00:53:45,614
Ladies and gentlemen...

571
00:53:46,082 --> 00:53:47,416
We should go.

572
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:50,685
We should probably
leave you alone.

573
00:53:52,654 --> 00:53:54,489
I love you, honey.

574
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,825
See you on-stage, Mr. Selznick.

575
00:53:59,761 --> 00:54:00,994
Let me get that for you.

576
00:54:00,996 --> 00:54:04,865
...tonight's performance
will resume in five minutes.

577
00:54:06,225 --> 00:54:11,837
We kindly ask you to make your way
back to your seats at this time.

578
00:54:16,977 --> 00:54:18,843
Thank you so much.

579
00:54:21,247 --> 00:54:23,281
That was close.

580
00:54:24,984 --> 00:54:26,251
You're welcome.

581
00:54:26,786 --> 00:54:28,218
Anyway, it's going to shit.

582
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:32,222
Calm down. That's what they always
say during any creative endeavor:

583
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,324
it's all going to shit.

584
00:54:34,592 --> 00:54:36,160
All the people of note.

585
00:54:36,428 --> 00:54:39,529
Look, I'm tired
of the "people of note" crap.

586
00:54:39,797 --> 00:54:42,899
- You want to know what I think?
- Enlighten me, please.

587
00:54:44,568 --> 00:54:46,335
- Hello?
- Yes?

588
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,872
- Are you even there, man?
- I'm listening, avidly.

589
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:53,809
What I'm saying is
you could've made this easy.

590
00:54:54,076 --> 00:54:57,512
Blackmail the movers. Have
them take a detour somewhere

591
00:54:57,814 --> 00:54:59,513
and have the piano
all to yourself.

592
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:03,317
But no, instead we got a night
of fucking Goodereks.

593
00:55:03,919 --> 00:55:05,152
And what would
you have suggested,

594
00:55:05,154 --> 00:55:08,788
kidnap the wonder-boy and drag him
to a warehouse with a gun to his head?

595
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,723
No, not necessarily. I mean...

596
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:15,495
Or build a robot that can play "La
Cinquette" like Rockafire Explosion?

597
00:55:15,796 --> 00:55:18,030
Your ideas are brilliant.
Keep 'em coming.

598
00:55:18,032 --> 00:55:19,765
Look, man, all I'm saying is...

599
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:22,568
Nobody in his right mind would
try pulling off a heist like this.

600
00:55:22,869 --> 00:55:25,871
That's what you're saying,
am I right?

601
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:27,331
Because...

602
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:30,641
that is how you make history. That's
how you get into the record books.

603
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:33,778
Four bars of "La Cinquette", you won't
have to answer to anybody ever again.

604
00:55:35,247 --> 00:55:37,148
Just do your job!

605
00:56:04,173 --> 00:56:06,107
Were you eavesdropping, Tom?

606
00:56:13,548 --> 00:56:15,048
Fair enough.

607
00:56:16,017 --> 00:56:20,052
Tell me something. What did
Patrick love more than anything?

608
00:56:20,054 --> 00:56:20,853
His body of work?

609
00:56:20,855 --> 00:56:25,658
His body of work, yeah, that's
funny. Certainly not his family.

610
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:28,127
- But you're missing something.
- What do you mean?

611
00:56:28,129 --> 00:56:30,996
How many keys
does Patrick's piano have?

612
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:32,063
What?

613
00:56:32,065 --> 00:56:34,132
Answer the question.

614
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:36,201
- Ninety-seven.
- Wrong.

615
00:56:38,271 --> 00:56:39,670
No, it's right.

616
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,340
Full eight octaves, seven
white keys and five black keys.

617
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,277
Plus the extra lower keys.
It's ninety-seven.

618
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:50,380
You're missing a key. And you know
what happens when you miss a key.

619
00:56:50,614 --> 00:56:52,715
- I know I'm right. Do the math.
- I did.

620
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:56,352
I know that piano better than
anyone who's ever played it.

621
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:01,223
The last four bars of "The
Unplayable Piece", that's your key.

622
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:03,926
- Who the hell are you? - No-one
compared to you and Patrick.

623
00:57:04,193 --> 00:57:08,763
The only thing Emma would find more
boring than your music is what I do.

624
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:13,401
It's not the Berlin
Philharmonic, but it's a job.

625
00:57:13,869 --> 00:57:17,071
Say an old man sends a fortune
to a Swiss bank, stashes it

626
00:57:17,372 --> 00:57:20,874
in a safe and hides a key
somewhere only he could ever access.

627
00:57:21,142 --> 00:57:25,445
The kind of lock that only someone
with his skills could ever open.

628
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:27,614
I helped Patrick build that lock

629
00:57:27,882 --> 00:57:30,616
and those fingers of yours
are going to get it open.

630
00:57:30,884 --> 00:57:33,385
Now's when you ask me:
"How much?"

631
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:35,187
- I don't care.
- You sure?

632
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:39,424
Aren't you curious
as to the price of your life?

633
00:57:39,426 --> 00:57:42,193
How much money
justifies all this?

634
00:57:42,928 --> 00:57:43,895
Nothing.

635
00:57:43,897 --> 00:57:47,265
I wouldn't do what you're doing
for all the money in the world.

636
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:51,768
Stravinsky beat his own
children, Mozart was a drunk,

637
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,071
but you're better than them.
Is that it?

638
00:57:54,339 --> 00:57:56,773
No, I don't care.
It wouldn't matter.

639
00:57:57,075 --> 00:57:59,342
I think the mark of a
great artist is curiosity.

640
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,679
You're striking me as a mediocre artist.
Don't you know everybody has a price?

641
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,881
- What's yours?
- Imagine it.

642
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:07,717
Imagine a value.

643
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:12,721
- Now double it.
- I can't.

644
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:17,492
Exactly. You can't, because
you don't have imagination.

645
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,563
Because you make your living
playing stuff other people write.

646
00:58:23,198 --> 00:58:25,032
That's what you're good at.
That's your talent.

647
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,569
Leave the imagination to the
real authors, the real artists.

648
00:58:28,836 --> 00:58:30,903
You're just a petty thief.

649
00:58:32,606 --> 00:58:34,407
And you're just a puppet.

650
00:58:34,942 --> 00:58:38,344
A genius puppet,
but just a puppet.

651
00:58:38,712 --> 00:58:41,513
Every time you take that stage,
you know it too.

652
00:58:41,748 --> 00:58:43,882
You have a great gift, Tom.

653
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,418
But I've got a vision.

654
00:58:48,655 --> 00:58:51,856
So do as you're told.
Play "La Cinquette".

655
00:58:53,091 --> 00:58:55,726
- And don't freeze this time.
- Go to hell.

656
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:57,495
Excuse me?

657
00:58:59,664 --> 00:59:01,564
Why would you let me go?

658
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:02,666
Tom...

659
00:59:03,668 --> 00:59:07,837
Don't make me upset.
You know where that leads.

660
00:59:29,057 --> 00:59:31,358
I see you, you son of a bitch.

661
00:59:32,093 --> 00:59:33,860
You see what?

662
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,362
Tom, what did you say?

663
00:59:37,265 --> 00:59:38,598
I said...

664
00:59:40,801 --> 00:59:42,435
I'll play it.

665
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,715
Thank you so much.

666
00:59:57,516 --> 01:00:00,317
Take the front end
of the piece easy.

667
01:00:00,785 --> 01:00:03,854
Don't tire your fingers. Save
it just for the last four bars.

668
01:00:04,122 --> 01:00:04,988
And now, to cap off the evening,

669
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:07,524
I'm going to yield the stage
to Mr. Selznick...

670
01:00:07,526 --> 01:00:08,258
Not one wrong note.

671
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,460
- ... who will play...
- Now. Interrupt him.

672
01:00:10,462 --> 01:00:11,694
- ... a solo piece...
- Do it!

673
01:00:12,162 --> 01:00:14,464
- ... that Patrick Godureaux dearly loved.
- Do it now!

674
01:00:14,732 --> 01:00:17,433
- Ladies and gentlemen, "The Tempest".
- No!

675
01:00:22,638 --> 01:00:24,306
"La Cinquette".

676
01:00:26,609 --> 01:00:30,311
Excuse me.
Would you please repeat that?

677
01:00:31,213 --> 01:00:33,748
I'm playing "La Cinquette".

678
01:00:37,018 --> 01:00:38,819
The Unplayable Piece.

679
01:00:39,087 --> 01:00:42,122
- Did you know?
- I had no idea.

680
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,891
...played by his greatest pupil

681
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:47,761
as a surprise change
to the program.

682
01:00:48,662 --> 01:00:53,098
Ladies and gentlemen,
history in the making.

683
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:57,870
Tom Selznick plays
"La Cinquette".

684
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:11,248
Don't disappoint me, Tom.

685
01:01:12,717 --> 01:01:15,352
I won't disappoint my audience.

686
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:17,528
Tom, you hear me?

687
01:03:19,498 --> 01:03:20,631
Tom?

688
01:03:23,668 --> 01:03:27,137
You're playing beautifully, Tom.
You're playing great.

689
01:03:27,572 --> 01:03:29,640
But you need to ease up, Tom.

690
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,111
You hear me? Ease up.

691
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:37,847
You're going to
tire out your fingers.

692
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,517
Careful, Tom.
Don't push the tempo,

693
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:45,420
make sure you hit
those last four bars.

694
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:52,159
Tom, if you don't ease up,
you're going to freeze it.

695
01:03:53,428 --> 01:03:55,195
You're going to burn out.

696
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:57,865
You hear me talking to you,
you piece of shit?

697
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:01,868
If you don't ease up, you're going to find
bits of your wife's skull in box seat five.

698
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:04,137
Shut the fuck up!

699
01:05:05,326 --> 01:05:07,627
Tom, what did you do?

700
01:05:13,467 --> 01:05:15,668
You sniveling little
piece of shit.

701
01:05:16,136 --> 01:05:20,472
You think this is some kind of a game?
I'll rip your throat out, goddamn it.

702
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,440
You sniveling little
piece of shit!

703
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:23,808
Agh!

704
01:05:38,423 --> 01:05:40,556
Are you listening to me, Tom?

705
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:44,327
You knew that was the
wrong note. You knew it!

706
01:05:44,329 --> 01:05:46,763
Yes. But the audience didn't.

707
01:05:47,131 --> 01:05:49,165
What the hell do you mean?

708
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,035
They never do.

709
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:05,012
Sit back down and play it again.

710
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,248
Play the last four bars again,
play them right,

711
01:06:07,716 --> 01:06:11,451
or I swear to God, you'll be finding bits
of your wife's skull in box seat five.

712
01:06:11,453 --> 01:06:14,287
You hear me, Tom?
I swear to God!

713
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:17,290
You think about the people
whose lives you're cutting short.

714
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:18,224
Think about your wife!

715
01:06:18,226 --> 01:06:22,061
You think about the blood on your
hands because you just lost your bet.

716
01:06:22,063 --> 01:06:23,128
Please, sit down.

717
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:24,730
You just lost your bet, Tom!

718
01:06:24,732 --> 01:06:25,831
Except for you, Emma!

719
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,833
I'm talking to you, Tom!

720
01:06:29,002 --> 01:06:29,802
Tom!

721
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,502
A light for her, please!

722
01:06:31,504 --> 01:06:35,073
You think that's going to stop me?
You think I got something to lose?

723
01:06:35,707 --> 01:06:40,244
Sit back down and play it again.
Play the last four bars again.

724
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,211
Play them right.

725
01:06:41,213 --> 01:06:44,581
The lovely woman you see
sitting up there is Emma.

726
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,184
Emma Selznick, my wife,

727
01:06:47,452 --> 01:06:49,820
and, as I'm sure you know,
an incredibly gifted actress.

728
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:51,353
What are you doing?

729
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,526
- You know...
- I'm going to take her out now.

730
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:59,295
- She's...
- I'm going to do it!

731
01:06:59,529 --> 01:07:01,729
- ... the only reason I'm here tonight.
- Do you hear me, Tom?

732
01:07:01,997 --> 01:07:05,266
She's the one you should thank,
not me. Please.

733
01:07:05,534 --> 01:07:08,903
If you don't do as I say right now, I'm
gonna take the bitch out point-blank.

734
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:12,272
Are you out of your mind?
Everyone's looking at her.

735
01:07:12,274 --> 01:07:13,407
I don't give a...

736
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:17,744
The change to your programs
Mr. Reisinger mentioned...

737
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:19,480
- I'm losing you.
- ... was not just "La Cinquette".

738
01:07:19,482 --> 01:07:20,647
What do you expect me to do?

739
01:07:20,649 --> 01:07:24,283
We also have a very special
encore planned for you tonight.

740
01:07:24,285 --> 01:07:27,019
Look, man, you have
got to get a clear head.

741
01:07:27,021 --> 01:07:29,188
Norman, will you please
join me up here?

742
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,056
Are you there?

743
01:07:30,058 --> 01:07:33,525
My friend, Norman Reisinger,
ladies and gentlemen.

744
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,296
You just heard him call me his
friend, right? So I have witnesses.

745
01:07:39,432 --> 01:07:41,065
Okay, what have you got in mind?

746
01:07:41,366 --> 01:07:44,568
I want some help to encore
this extraordinary venue...

747
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:47,138
I don't know what to do!

748
01:07:47,405 --> 01:07:51,508
Please, help me accompany
Emma Selznick in performing

749
01:07:51,976 --> 01:07:55,245
a selection of her choosing, for
this incredibly generous audience.

750
01:07:55,513 --> 01:07:57,213
You've got to be kidding!

751
01:07:57,215 --> 01:07:57,947
Sing for me.

752
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:02,484
I had nothing to do
with this hijacking, Emma.

753
01:08:05,722 --> 01:08:07,422
A standard?

754
01:08:08,691 --> 01:08:09,758
A calypso.

755
01:08:12,361 --> 01:08:15,062
No, you're right,
it's too sexy for this crowd.

756
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,767
I got it.

757
01:08:22,404 --> 01:08:23,303
Is that okay?

758
01:08:25,506 --> 01:08:27,908
Right. "Motherless Child" it is.

759
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:31,443
Ladies and gentlemen,
Emma Selznick!

760
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:33,846
Listen to me. I'm packing up
and I'm out of here.

761
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:34,880
The hell you are!

762
01:08:34,882 --> 01:08:39,351
Open your eyes, open your ears.
Forget about the money, it's over!

763
01:08:44,456 --> 01:08:45,690
You're not walking out on me.

764
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:49,694
Calm down. Let's just pack up
and get out of here.

765
01:08:49,696 --> 01:08:52,062
No! I spent three years on this!

766
01:08:52,697 --> 01:08:54,431
What are you...? What?

767
01:08:54,699 --> 01:08:58,235
What? Stop! You can't!
You crazy son of a...

768
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:00,137
No!

769
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:03,339
Are you listening?

770
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:06,309
Say goodbye to your wife.

771
01:09:08,946 --> 01:09:12,814
Sometimes I feel

772
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:16,117
like a motherless child.

773
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:24,358
You listen now, you piece of shit!
Don't you dare fucking touch her!

774
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:30,130
A long, long way

775
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:32,398
from home.

776
01:09:49,682 --> 01:09:51,149
Hi, Tom.

777
01:10:07,465 --> 01:10:10,934
Sometimes I feel

778
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:14,136
like I just can't go on.

779
01:10:14,404 --> 01:10:17,873
Sometimes I feel

780
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:21,709
like I might make it through.

781
01:10:22,177 --> 01:10:27,649
Sometimes I feel
like there's no place for us.

782
01:10:30,653 --> 01:10:34,655
Alone I pray

783
01:10:35,256 --> 01:10:41,028
to my Lord.

784
01:10:41,396 --> 01:10:46,599
Where's my home,

785
01:10:48,402 --> 01:10:51,836
my home?

786
01:11:15,626 --> 01:11:19,495
I'd rather die, I'd rather die.

787
01:11:21,831 --> 01:11:27,436
Sometimes I feel, sometimes
I feel like I just can't go on.

788
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:34,308
Sometimes I feel
like I might make it through.

789
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:40,081
Sometimes I feel

790
01:11:40,382 --> 01:11:45,352
like a motherless child.

791
01:11:46,854 --> 01:11:51,124
Sometimes I feel

792
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:57,096
like a motherless child.

793
01:12:01,634 --> 01:12:05,002
A long,

794
01:12:05,471 --> 01:12:07,872
long way from home.

795
01:12:09,341 --> 01:12:13,944
A long, long way from home.

796
01:12:23,887 --> 01:12:25,421
Argh!

797
01:13:12,497 --> 01:13:14,832
Tom! Oh, my God!

798
01:13:14,834 --> 01:13:15,900
Tom!

799
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:34,683
Tom!

800
01:13:35,218 --> 01:13:38,287
Oh, my God, sweetheart,
are you okay?

801
01:13:39,255 --> 01:13:40,823
Argh!

802
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:46,727
I think I broke my leg.

803
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:20,846
Emma...

804
01:15:25,784 --> 01:15:27,485
Can we please go home?

805
01:15:48,672 --> 01:15:49,505
Honey!

806
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,948
I need to finish this.
