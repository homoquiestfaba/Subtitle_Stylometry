1
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,179
(Lighter clicks)

2
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,811
Babe.

3
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,980
Please don't smoke.
It'll kill your palate.

4
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,148
Then my palate will die happy.

5
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,858
Hey.

6
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,320
Margot, tonight is huge, okay?

7
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,823
The flavor profiles,
it's all super delicate.

8
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,551
When you smoke, you ruin your ability
to be able to appreciate them.

9
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,576
(Scoffs) Oh, come on!

10
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,704
Please. Please.

11
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,085
Fine. Jesus.

12
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,796
- Thank you.
- (Ship horn blares)

13
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,798
Oh! Thank god.

14
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,924
(Intriguing music playing)

15
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,402
Margot: Is that gonna fit everyone?

16
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,469
Tyler: Yeah, easily.
Twelve customers total.

17
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,762
Margot: A night?

18
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,264
How do they turn a profit?

19
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,224
Tyler: $1,250 a head. That's how.

20
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,226
You're fucking kidding, right?

21
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,686
What, are we eating a rolex?

22
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,956
Come on, let's not ruin this
by talking price, yeah?

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,440
Just go with the flow.

24
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,691
Let it be magical.

25
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,360
- Hey, it's your dime.
- Mmm.

26
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,029
Bryce: Not bad!
Dave: Oh, thanks, man.

27
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,256
Soren: You deserve this, baby.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,800
You know who's gonna love this? Betty!

29
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,617
It's just a "fuck you" to accounts.

30
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:58,952
It's not even a client dinner.

31
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,704
(Laughs) Fuck. We're dicks, huh?

32
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,249
(Groans) Great. A power tasting.

33
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,043
They'll be wasted by the amuse.

34
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,228
Soren: Hi, guys. Dave: By boat.

35
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,012
How did you think we were
gonna get on the...

36
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,133
Ted: Look at you on a gangplank in heels.

37
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,593
Fuck.

38
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,595
(Men grunting)

39
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,767
Holy fucking shit.

40
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,686
Lillian bloom. Oh, my god.

41
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,480
- Who's Lillian bloom?
- (Shushes)

42
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,981
Food critic for <i>saveur.</i>

43
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,359
She basically discovered slowik.

44
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,569
Okay, well, it's official.

45
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,279
Tonight will be madness.

46
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,572
(Tyler chuckles softly)

47
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,534
Boatman: All aboard for hawthorn!

48
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,746
Hawthorn! All aboard!

49
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,830
Wow.

50
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,099
Captain: (Over pa system)
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

51
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,710
<i>please make yourselves comfortable
for our short journey to hawthorn island.</i>

52
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,128
<i>- Thank you.
</i>- George: Ahoy!

53
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,838
And avast, me hearties!

54
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,548
Let's hope she's seaworthy, eh?

55
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,925
Yes, sir. Yeah.

56
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,386
Boat... boat jokes.

57
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,678
- Yeah, yeah.
- Boat, yeah.

58
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,989
- We're on a boat.
- Yeah. We're on a boat.

59
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,056
(All chuckle)

60
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,576
Soren: Hey, we got
a famous person on board, huh?

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,768
Bryce: Fp in the house.

62
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,937
Dave: Barely f anymore,
though. It's not 1998.

63
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,146
Bryce: He's a p, and he's f.

64
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,564
Oh, my god. Check it out.

65
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,876
George: Hey, aren't you supposed
to be running interference for me?

66
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,336
Make sure people don't bother me, then?

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,960
God, we both know you were not bothered.

68
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,714
Margot: I saw all his movies
when I was a kid.

69
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,739
Felicity: Hey, listen.

70
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,492
Apparently, he's a big foodie.
You know, thinks he is.

71
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,928
Waiter: Chef slowik
would like to welcome you

72
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,413
with a raw local oyster
in a mignonette emulsion,

73
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,040
with lemon caviar
and an oyster leaf. Enjoy.

74
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,524
- Beautiful. Thank you.
- Thank you.

75
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,960
It's one of his classics. Mmm-mmm.

76
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,088
The lemon pearls are made with alginate.

77
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,216
- Alginate, as in, um...
- (Camera shutter clicks)

78
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,467
As in algae. Come on.

79
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,261
Right, yeah.

80
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,762
- Pond scum.
- It's not...

81
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,888
Delicious. (Chuckles)

82
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,150
(Chuckles happily)

83
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,443
Oh, my god.

84
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,153
It's laughable.

85
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,613
It's actually fucking laughably good.

86
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,074
- It's good.
- Mmm.

87
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,952
Think I prefer just the oyster, though.
Love oysters.

88
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,163
No. No. It's the balance of the products.

89
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,956
You need the mouthfeel of the mignonette.

90
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,851
Please don't say "mouthfeel."

91
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,626
- Too late. Mouthfeel.
- (Chuckles)

92
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,211
(Ship horn blares)

93
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,297
(Intense classical music playing)

94
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,605
- (Indistinct chatter)
- Hi.

95
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,273
Lillian: Thank you.

96
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,066
Jesus, this is like prom.

97
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,319
Yeah? I never went to prom.

98
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,112
- Really? Why not?
- (Music fades)

99
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,615
'Cause none of the cool girls
like you said, "yes."

100
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,700
Aw, poor baby.

101
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,703
- Well, fuck those bitches.
- (Chuckles softly)

102
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,038
- Bryce.
- Welcome.

103
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,498
Welcome, Mr. Lorimer.

104
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,543
- Hello. Felicity Lynn.
- Elsa: Hello. Good evening.

105
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,547
- And Damien Garcia.
- Elsa: And Mr. George Diaz.

106
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,347
- Mr. Diaz. Welcome.
- You gave my real name?

107
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,441
Of course I gave them your real name.

108
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,650
- What about the paparazzi?
- It's a pleasure to have you.

109
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,735
Paparazzi? We're on an island.

110
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,861
Of course I gave them your real name.

111
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,969
Welcome to hawthorn.

112
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,097
Mr. Ledford and miss westervelt?

113
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,517
(Stutters) Oh, no. Um...

114
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,339
Sorry, yeah, no. That was, uh...

115
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,737
That's not miss...
She had a change of plans,

116
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,856
so miss westervelt couldn't...
This is miss...

117
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,942
I'm Margot.

118
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,865
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- (Tyler clears throat)

119
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,492
Margot. Welcome.

120
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,454
We'll endeavor to make your evening
as pleasant as possible.

121
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,248
- Thanks.
- Right this way.

122
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,332
Thanks.

123
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,918
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

124
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,771
That was really awkward.
I'm sorry. That was not...

125
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,588
- No, no. Fine.
- (Sighs)

126
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,673
Don't worry about it.

127
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,841
Tyler: (Clears throat) Sorry.

128
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,681
Elsa: Mr. Leibrandt.
Mrs. Leibrandt. Welcome.

129
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,951
Richard: We'll just go straight
to the restaurant, if you don't mind.

130
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,561
Anne: We've seen the tour
many, many times.

131
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,895
Elsa: Yes, yes, you have.

132
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,149
My esteemed guests
can continue their conversation this way.

133
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,360
Thank you. Please follow me.

134
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,613
So, like, what are you working on now?

135
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,032
Oh, hey, thanks for asking.
See, people still know me.

136
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,868
I'm moving into
the presenter phase of my career.

137
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,412
You know? Do me.

138
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:19,337
Elsa: Hawthorn island
comprises 12 acres of forest and pasture.

139
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,965
We have the bounty
of the sea surrounding us.

140
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,049
Oh, yeah, right.

141
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,344
Out there, right now,
we are harvesting scallops.

142
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,470
You'll eat them tonight.

143
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,514
- No, get out. Oh, shoot!
- Yes.

144
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,433
Hey! (Laughing)

145
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,852
Hey, harvest harder, me dude!

146
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,270
We're starving!

147
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,479
(All laughing)

148
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,814
Oh, my goodness.

149
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,818
I do like the sense of it
being a sort of biome of culinary ideas.

150
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,362
Right. Like, it functions like
an epicurean salon.

151
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,781
No, I like biome better I think.

152
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,384
Biome's better. Yeah, yeah.
I mean, that's... yeah.

153
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,703
Margot: We have reached
the base camp of mount bullshit.

154
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,038
This is insane. (Chuckles)

155
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,956
(Dramatic music playing)

156
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,921
Smell that.

157
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,590
Both: Mmm.

158
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,802
Soren: We're gonna be hungry.

159
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,488
George: Yeah, I'm a huge
embarrassing foodie.

160
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,597
I love this stuff.

161
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,724
And I'm close, personal
friends with the chef.

162
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,933
Soren: Okay, player.

163
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,645
Elsa: Our smokehouse
is in the nordic tradition.

164
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,773
We use the meat of dairy cows only,

165
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:26,738
which we age for an astonishing 152 days
to relax the protein strands.

166
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,074
Bryce: Ah, yes. Yes.
Ted: Can we pop in here?

167
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,761
- Dude, I read about one of these online.
- Oh, yeah? Can I check it out?

168
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,887
- Dave: Korean barbeque.
- Yes.

169
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,246
But please, do not touch our proteins.
They're immature.

170
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,166
So, what happens if
you serve it on the 153rd day?

171
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,335
Does all hell break loose, or...

172
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,004
Well, I suppose the bacteria
would introduce itself

173
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,591
to the consumer's bloodstream
and spread into their spinal membranes,

174
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,177
after which point, he or she
would become incapacitated

175
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,970
and shortly thereafter expire.

176
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,264
So, yes, all hell would break loose.

177
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,059
(All chuckle nervously)

178
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,477
Good thing we're pros, yes?

179
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,706
George: I'd like to work for her.

180
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,731
Soren: Yeah. Dave: Cool.

181
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,108
Elsa: This is where we live.

182
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:08,071
Bryce: Yeah? What, you actually live here?
All of you?

183
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,698
Elsa: All of us.

184
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,949
Except chef.

185
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,701
- Yeah, well...
- Lillian: Oof.

186
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,953
<i>Esprit de corps.</i> No?

187
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,956
Elsa: No, Mr. Feldman.
It's very much more than that.

188
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,125
Here we are family.

189
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,128
Each day starts at 6:00,
with five hours of prep work.

190
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,171
We harvest. We ferment.

191
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,549
We slaughter. We marinate.

192
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,135
We liquify. We spherify.

193
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,761
We gel.

194
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,430
- They, um... they "gel?"
- Yeah.

195
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,514
We gel.

196
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,934
Dinner is typically
four hours and 25 minutes.

197
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,936
Each day ends at well past
2:00 in the morning.

198
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,580
So yes, it's best that we all live here.

199
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,148
You guys ever get burned out, or...

200
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,651
- "Burned out?"
- Yeah, sorry, sorry.

201
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,446
Like, tired of doing the same thing?

202
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,490
Chef holds himself
to the highest standard, and so do we.

203
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,412
We never burn anything unless by design,
to make delicious.

204
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,331
Now, who's hungry?

205
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,768
Margot: There is food
at the end of this, right?

206
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,419
Ted: Boat food to dinner table.

207
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,795
Elsa.

208
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,921
Excuse me.

209
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,757
Elsa. Elsa, hi.

210
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,841
Uh, who lives there?

211
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,426
Chef.

212
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,761
Oh, can we see that?

213
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,057
Even we are not allowed
inside chef's cottage, Mr. Ledford.

214
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,937
Margot: (Shushes) Come on.

215
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,149
We mustn't disturb
the lord high emperor of sustenance.

216
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,275
Yeah, all right.

217
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,879
Isn't the goat the greatest of
all time, though?

218
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,321
No, no, no. Back in the day...

219
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,753
George: You think he'd pick that big guy?

220
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,160
(Indistinct chatter and laughter)

221
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,039
So, I think that maybe
we'll just time the post.

222
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,874
Oh, yeah? Bring you to the best spots?

223
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,393
Felicity: Yes, well,
I book the best spots.

224
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,603
- So you tell me.
- George: With my name.

225
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,669
Felicity: Well, I...

226
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,881
Hi, again.

227
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,132
Bryce: Gentlemen, parfait?

228
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,426
Felicity: Oh! Look at that view.

229
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,512
Wanna take a picture?

230
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,388
(Classical music playing)

231
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,944
(Indistinct chatter)

232
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,197
Soren: Where we going, chief?

233
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,491
Here. Switch seats with me.

234
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,077
- Miss...
- Mills.

235
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,413
Ms. Mills. You will be sitting
in miss westervelt's seat.

236
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,600
Richard: Just...
You should have the better view.

237
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,751
Anne: Well, I don't... (Stutters)

238
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,253
I don't need a better view.

239
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,396
Richard: No,
I'm gonna look at the kitchen.

240
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,756
Margot: Thank you!
Richard: The rosé, we'll get first.

241
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,841
Enjoy.

242
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,228
Elsa: Feel free to observe
the cooks as they innovate.

243
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:51,234
But please, do not photograph our dishes.

244
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,279
Chef strongly feels that
the beauty in his creations

245
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,197
lies in their ephemeral nature.

246
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,699
Here, come on. We can't miss this.

247
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,910
Margot: Oh. Um...

248
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,415
Do you make that with a pacojet?

249
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,084
- Exactly right, sir.
- Mmm.

250
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,797
You know, a pacojet can produce
a powderized, uh, snow-like texture.

251
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,174
- Cool.
- Yeah. I have one.

252
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,176
You really know your stuff, Mr. Ledford.

253
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,679
You know my name?

254
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,723
Oh, we like to know
everyone who dines with us.

255
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,327
And chef, is he around here somewhere?
I'd love to talk with him.

256
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,853
Why don't you take your seat?

257
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,522
We're about to serve.

258
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,150
Oh, right. Yeah, okay. Thank you.

259
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,545
- Tyler: Wow.
- More lambrusco, madam?

260
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,905
Tyler: Well, the attention
to detail, it's like, fuck!

261
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,072
And he knew my name, babe!

262
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,675
Yeah. I noticed you didn't ask his name.

263
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,700
Yeah, well, you know.

264
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,412
(Shushes)

265
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,496
Tyler: There he is.

266
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,761
Fuck me. Is he looking at me?

267
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,394
(Unsettling music playing)

268
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,697
(Indistinct chatter)

269
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,036
Ted: Bland? You call that bland?
Lillian: Well, it is bland.

270
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,388
Soren: You like the winter, don't you?

271
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,681
Dave: I don't actually...
Soren: Fucking freak.

272
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,059
Server: Here we have a compressed
and pickled cucumber melon,

273
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,918
milk snow, and charred lace.

274
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,044
- Soren: Thanks.
- Enjoy.

275
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,049
Oh! This ongoing obsession with snow.

276
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,718
It's officially a plague,
and no one is immune.

277
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,350
Can you taste a little goat?

278
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,435
Right at the end. A little kid.

279
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,561
She said milk.

280
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,230
I wonder.

281
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,333
- She did not say of what species.
- Ted: She did not.

282
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,668
Felicity: I want to hear
your pitch for the show,

283
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,069
but first I would like to say "thank you"

284
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,130
- for the last two years.
- (Phone camera shutter clicks)

285
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,073
Felicity: This opportunity has been, uh...

286
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,356
George: The best of your life?

287
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,909
Let's have to many, many, many more.

288
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,388
Come on. I'm trying to do a goodbye toast.
Can you please just let me do that?

289
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,014
- No, it ain't. No, it ain't.
- Yes, it is.

290
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,873
- I'm starting a new position.
- Oh, my god!

291
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,750
Felicity: My mom got me a job at Sony.

292
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,127
I told you this two weeks ago.

293
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,045
Here's my, uh, work phone.

294
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,107
Here's the production
company's credit card.

295
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,525
What are you doin'? Non-transferrable.

296
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,801
And here is the key to your house in la...

297
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,946
- I don't have pockets.
- Your apartment in New York

298
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,115
and your other apartment in New York
that your wife doesn't know about.

299
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,223
Bryce: How's Amanda?

300
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,367
Felicity: Take it because
I won't be there on Monday.

301
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,143
(Chuckles) We're doing this?

302
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,328
The "talking about our lives" thing?

303
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,330
- Is that it? We're close?
- Hey, I don't want to either.

304
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,273
- But shouldn't we?
- Dave: Well, do we have to?

305
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,609
Well, not good, Bryce. Okay?

306
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,778
Me and Amanda are not good. It's not good.

307
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,113
Bryce: Are you at fault?

308
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,966
No, it was her fault.
She made me text her coworker.

309
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,950
Yeah, fucking of course
it's my fault, bro.

310
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,243
I'm an asshole.

311
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,578
Well, at least we have work.

312
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,621
- Dave: And money.
- To work and money.

313
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,040
- Dave: Yeah, baby.
- Yeah, baby.

314
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,291
We're pathetic, aren't we?

315
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,094
Soren: Oh, my god, dude.
Somebody, shoot us.

316
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,963
(Both speaking Spanish)

317
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,899
Felicity: (In English)
No, I'm not gonna have...

318
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,484
Jesus Christ. I want to live
inside this thing.

319
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,596
Mmm. So it's okay
that I'm not as into this as you are?

320
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,722
Oh, no, no. It's good.

321
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,390
I'm sitting with the coolest girl here.

322
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,559
Okay, so what is it with this food thing?

323
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,896
I don't know. It's like,
you know how people idolize,

324
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,522
you know, athletes, and musicians,

325
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,399
- and painters, and stuff?
- Mmm-hmm.

326
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,753
Yeah, those people are idiots.
What they do, it doesn't matter.

327
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,362
They play with inflatable balls
and ukuleles and shit.

328
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,655
Chefs,

329
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,991
they play with the raw materials
of life itself.

330
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,743
And death itself. It's...

331
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,955
I mean, I've watched every fucking episode
of <i>chef's table</i> two or three times.

332
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,791
I've watched slowik's 20 times.

333
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,961
I've watched him explain the exact moment
a green strawberry is perfectly unripe.

334
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,922
I've watched him plate a raw scallop

335
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,424
during its last
dying contraction of muscle.

336
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,343
It's art on the edge of the abyss,

337
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,428
which is where god works, too.
It's the same.

338
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,263
That was beautifully put, Tyler.

339
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,224
- Stop. Don't. No.
- No! I'm being serious.

340
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,644
I think I'm, um, starting to get it.

341
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,437
- Really?
- Yeah. A little.

342
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,445
(Bell dings)

343
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,450
(Suspenseful music playing)

344
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,126
Okay.

345
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,252
Yes, chef.

346
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,587
(Classical music playing)

347
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,394
(Classical music fades)

348
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,945
Slowik: Good evening.

349
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,488
Good evening.

350
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,092
- Good evening. Hello.
- George: Hello.

351
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,492
Welcome to hawthorn.

352
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,536
I am Julian slowik,

353
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,080
and tonight it'll be
our pleasure to feed you.

354
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,415
The curtain rises.

355
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,836
Slowik: Over the next few hours
you will ingest fat,

356
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,882
salt, sugar, protein,

357
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,885
bacteria, fungi,

358
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,512
various plants and animals,

359
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,724
and, at times, entire ecosystems.

360
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,644
But I have to beg of you one thing.

361
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,729
It's just one.

362
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,481
Do not eat.

363
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,609
Is he serious?

364
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,235
Taste.

365
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,238
Savor.

366
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,323
Relish.

367
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,076
Consider every morsel
that you place inside your mouth.

368
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,246
Be mindful.

369
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,624
But do not eat.

370
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,128
Our menu is too precious
for that. (Chuckles softly)

371
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,338
And look around you.

372
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,216
Here we are on this island.

373
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,384
Accept.

374
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,137
Accept all of it.

375
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,265
And forgive.

376
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,518
And on that note,

377
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,395
food!

378
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,940
George: Yeah, yeah. Bring it, bring it.

379
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,525
Here they come.

380
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,321
Lillian: Oh, wow.
It's like a marching band.

381
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,953
Slowik: Our first course
is called "the island."

382
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,372
On your plate are plants
from around the island,

383
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,540
placed on rocks from the shore,

384
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,252
covered in barely frozen,
filtered seawater

385
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,796
which will flavor the dish as it melts.

386
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,024
You know, this is what the guy
was fishing for earlier...

387
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,049
Slowik: Sorry?

388
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,468
Tyler: Um...

389
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,262
Sorry, chef.

390
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,724
It's perfectly all right.
Yes, they are those very same scallops.

391
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,186
Now, here is what you must
remember about this dish.

392
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,190
We, the people on this island,
are not important.

393
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:51,821
The island and the nutrients it provides
exist in their most perfect state

394
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:56,909
without us gathering them
or manipulating them, or digesting them.

395
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,871
What happens inside this room
is meaningless

396
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,999
compared to what happens
outside in nature,

397
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,585
in the soil, in the water,

398
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,254
in the air.

399
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,967
We are but a frightened nanosecond.

400
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,971
Nature is timeless.

401
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,391
Enjoy.

402
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,685
(Guests clapping)

403
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,894
That's a cheery thought.

404
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,730
(Sniffles)

405
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,649
Are you crying?

406
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,737
It's just that I find it all very moving.

407
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,238
It's all so beautiful. I just...

408
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,240
It's almost too beautiful to eat.

409
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,219
- (Phone camera shutter clicking)
- Margot: You know,

410
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,203
the nicest restaurant
in my hometown was...

411
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,887
You don't think chef's mad at me, right?

412
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:44,915
For the scallop thing?

413
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,001
You don't have to call him "chef," Tyler.

414
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,420
I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know
about your existence.

415
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,880
I kind of want him to...

416
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,966
- Like you? (Chuckles)
- Yeah. Kinda.

417
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,343
Tyler, you're the customer.

418
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,303
You're paying him to serve you.

419
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,306
It doesn't really matter
whether he likes you or not.

420
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,724
Right. Wait. What does that mean?

421
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,933
Mmm. Nothing.

422
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,853
Relax. Just eat your rock.

423
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,564
And to pair, from our friends
at Caroline morey,

424
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,232
a chassagne-montrachet

425
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,902
premier cru from 2014.

426
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,154
Not just a single vineyard.

427
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,198
A single row of vines.

428
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,949
- Wow. Perfect.
- It's magical.

429
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,994
Ted: Thoughts?
I'm really feeling this is quite...

430
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,246
It's half-great. It's there in moments.

431
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,331
There in moments.

432
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,249
There's a neediness
to the plating, you know.

433
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,773
I mean, it's been tweezered to fuck.

434
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,128
But the flavors are there.
It's very clean.

435
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,339
It's very, um, thalassic.

436
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,258
- "Thalassic?"
- oceanic.

437
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,177
Thalassa was the primeval
spirit of the sea.

438
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,387
Oh, thalassa and pontus.

439
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,263
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Correct. So, we are...

440
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,558
We're eating the ocean.

441
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,852
We're eating the ocean.

442
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,312
- Yeah.
- Yes.

443
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,192
- Felicity: How is it?
- Mmm.

444
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
It's good.

445
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,381
You can't just say "good"
for the show. You have to...

446
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,614
You have to embellish.

447
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,593
Oh, my god. For crying out loud.
It's not brain surgery, okay?

448
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,887
- It's a goddamn travel-food show.
- I know. Okay, so then, do it.

449
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,414
Yeah, yeah. So pitch it to me.

450
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,617
- Okay, so we go to Italy, right?
- Felicity: Mmm-hmm.

451
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,212
We shoot me in Capri pants
on a pastel green Vespa,

452
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,590
driving around to get
to some giuseppe's farm with cheese.

453
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,051
I eat the cheese, and then...

454
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,344
There's a close-up of me.

455
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,223
And I close my eyes, and I fake an orgasm,
and then off to South Africa,

456
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,018
and then, I maybe...
I talk about how racism is not so cool,

457
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,979
and bingo bongo, Emmy time.

458
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,289
- That's it?
- Okay? Can I eat now?

459
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,583
That's what you're gonna pitch
to three streaming services on Monday?

460
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,668
Yeah. Pretty much. That's that.

461
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,652
Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ.
That's a disaster.

462
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,946
I don't think you can go
to South Africa with a dui.

463
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,740
- Soren: You like this?
- The otter food?

464
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,992
Yeah. It's solid.

465
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,511
Soren: I mean,
I've had shellfish just as good

466
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,121
with my chef at home, Ricardo.
You know Ricardo. He's amazing.

467
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,581
Bryce: Incredible.
Soren: Whatever.

468
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,344
At least we can say
we've been here, right?

469
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,710
My dad used to say
that you buy the experience.

470
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:57,173
Richard: I mean, this looks like
a suburban landscaping.

471
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,632
What the fuck?

472
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,221
I saw Perry at delaurenti's the other day.

473
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,644
Oh?

474
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:13,856
How is he?

475
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,942
You know...

476
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,486
Perry.

477
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,574
Thank you.

478
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,496
Slowik: I want plating in five!

479
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,788
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

480
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,921
(Bell dings)

481
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,801
(Claps)

482
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,012
Is he gonna keep doing that?

483
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:50,684
Bread has existed in some form
for over 12,000 years,

484
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,020
especially amongst the poor.

485
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,272
Flour and water.

486
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:56,982
What could be simpler?

487
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:02,571
Even today, grain represents
65% of all agriculture.

488
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,824
Fruits and vegetables only 6%.

489
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:12,373
Ancient Greek peasants dipped their stale,
measly bread in wine for breakfast.

490
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,709
And how did Jesus teach us to pray

491
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,420
- if not to beg for our daily bread?
- Beg for our daily bread.

492
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,967
It is, and has always been,
the food of the common man.

493
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,137
But you, my dear guests,
are not the common man.

494
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,222
And so tonight...

495
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,766
you get no bread.

496
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,017
(Bell dings)

497
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,694
Lillian: He must be joking.
Ted: He's joking.

498
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,903
(Guests laugh)

499
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,132
- This is next-level.
- Felicity: How are you not gonna...

500
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,157
Wow, he's not kidding.

501
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,886
Not gonna serve bread at a restaurant
known for their bread. That's sweet.

502
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,953
- What?
- Anne: Thank you.

503
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,747
It's not a fake-out, is it?

504
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,583
- What?
- Ted: No.

505
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,710
It's gotta be a bit.

506
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,046
Are you fuckin' serious?

507
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,631
Slowik: In this spirit,

508
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,552
please enjoy
the unaccompanied accompaniments.

509
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,072
Felicity: "The bread
you will not be eating tonight

510
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,807
"was made from a heritage wheat
called red fife,

511
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,686
"crafted with our partners
at the tehachapi grain project

512
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,521
"devoted to preserving heirloom grains."

513
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,481
- This is insane.
- George: Mmm!

514
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,402
I gotta say that the shit around
the total absence of the bread

515
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,446
is, like, really good.

516
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,073
I mean, it's a little outrageous,
isn't it?

517
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,951
It's fiendish, really.

518
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:35,122
I mean, he's always been keenly aware
of food as a history of class...

519
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,707
I mean, as have I.

520
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,791
Sure.

521
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:44,423
Though I will say that this emulsion
does look slightly split.

522
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,008
Ted: Yeah.

523
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,470
I mean, I wasn't gonna say anything.
I noticed as soon as it came down.

524
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,430
It's broken. It's broken.

525
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,391
Yeah, which is really...
I mean, you really...

526
00:23:56,477 --> 00:24:00,064
You really shouldn't see that in
a restaurant of this quality. There it is.

527
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,482
- Well, there it is.
- Yeah.

528
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,860
Oh, my god. I mean,
it's next-level badassery.

529
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,154
The way he weaves in
historical allegories.

530
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,240
I mean, the game is trying to guess
what the overarching theme

531
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,575
of the entire meal is gonna be.

532
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,910
You won't know until the end.

533
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,204
Wait. You... you like this?

534
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,413
Mmm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

535
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,082
He's basically insulting you.

536
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,501
No, no, no. You don't get it.

537
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,627
It's a concept.

538
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,504
I know what a concept is, Tyler.

539
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,963
Trust me. He's telling a story.

540
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,566
That's what makes his food so exciting.

541
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,134
He's not just a chef. He's a storyteller.

542
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,695
And he doesn't give a fuck
about the rules.

543
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,864
Call me the girl next door,
but maybe there are some rules

544
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,307
that you should give a fuck about,
like, I don't know,

545
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,142
giving food to people at a restaurant.

546
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,064
Dearest, no one would ever
call you the girl next door.

547
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,524
Lillian: I make my own bread.

548
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,192
- You do? I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

549
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,194
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's very rustic.

550
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,405
It's peasant style. Yeasty.

551
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,240
What kind of yeast are you using?

552
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,909
Oh, I make my own from apples.

553
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,370
Well, of course you make
your own yeast from apples.

554
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,081
- You wicked thing.
- (Elsa clears throat)

555
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,125
- Elsa: Ms. Bloom?
- Mmm?

556
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,293
Elsa: Here is another broken emulsion.

557
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,088
Courtesy of chef slowik.

558
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,257
(Amusing music playing)

559
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:12,862
Soren: Hello. Bryce: Excuse me.

560
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,471
Is everything to your liking, sir?

561
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,433
Well, actually, no. Thanks for asking.

562
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,518
Uh, I mean, look, the food's great

563
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,478
and we totally
get all the conceptual stuff.

564
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,397
But could we please get a little bread?

565
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,542
You know, and some gluten-free
for my friend as well?

566
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,686
- No.
- (Amusing music stops)

567
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,485
"No?"

568
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,195
No.

569
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,947
(Chuckles nervously) Okay.

570
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,033
This is all very clever,
and I didn't want to pull this card,

571
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,036
but you know who we are, right?

572
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:39,872
Yes.

573
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,124
You do? You know who we are?

574
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,459
I know who you are.

575
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,587
Mmm-hmm. Then you know
we work with Doug verrick, right?

576
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,672
No, you work for Mr. Verrick.

577
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,424
- Exactly.
- Oh, fuck it.

578
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,260
And so you know,
we all play on the same team.

579
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,054
So, just slip us a little bread.

580
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,265
- Please.
- We won't tell a soul, lady.

581
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,267
- I promise, okay?
- No.

582
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,228
- (Soren sighs)
- Did you say, "no?"

583
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,189
I said, "no." Yes.

584
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,356
- Okay.
- Okay.

585
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,691
- Wow.
- Okay.

586
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,777
That will be all, though. Thanks.

587
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,196
May I?

588
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,364
You don't have to do... okay.

589
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,078
(Whispering) You will eat
less than you desire

590
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,747
and more than you deserve.

591
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,834
It's a pleasure to serve you.

592
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,338
Ted: Well, I remain in ketosis,
so that's good news.

593
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,549
Tyler: Without the bread,
it really focuses you.

594
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,093
It's so fucking good. Embalm me in this.

595
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,014
- Are you not gonna try it?
- No.

596
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,349
- No?
- No.

597
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,433
This is great stuff.

598
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,602
- I'll take it and eat it.
- Yeah, go for it.

599
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,395
(All gasp)

600
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,258
Tyler: That was a total accident.

601
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,044
Margot: It happens to the best of us.

602
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:52,736
Tyler: I'm...

603
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,863
I'm sorry. That was...

604
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,156
No, I'm so sorry.

605
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,911
You haven't touched your food.

606
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,205
There...

607
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,665
There is no food.

608
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,917
Well, no. This is food.

609
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,296
So, um, lots more food to come.

610
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,191
- Don't wanna fill up.
- That would not be possible.

611
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,968
I've precisely designed
the portions to account for that.

612
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,136
So, (chuckles) You won't fill up.

613
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,721
Please eat.

614
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,391
The menu only makes sense if you eat.

615
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,767
But you told us not to eat.

616
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,979
That is not what I meant, madam.
And you know it.

617
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,066
Well, thank you for your concern,

618
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,361
but I am perfectly capable
of deciding when I eat and what.

619
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,200
Thank you.

620
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,328
Christ, that was humiliating.

621
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,788
Margot: "Humiliating?"
Tyler: Yeah.

622
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,498
Margot: Tyler, the guy is a prick.

623
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,624
Tyler: Please don't.

624
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,377
You shouldn't be so fucking rude.

625
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,921
Margot: What?
Tyler: He asked you to eat.

626
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,440
Margot: I don't like it.
Tyler: Just try it.

627
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,465
Please.

628
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,677
(Somber music playing)

629
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,685
Plating in three, my friends!

630
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,811
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

631
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,525
(Classical music playing)

632
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,955
(Classical music fades)

633
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,834
Sommelier: That's a 2013
Pinot noir from Ross Cobb.

634
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,295
We hyper-decanted it
with an immersion blender

635
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,172
to awaken it from its slumber.

636
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,256
(Both chuckle)

637
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,426
Slavonian oak, rich cherry
and tobacco notes,

638
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:43,388
and a faint sense of longing and regret.

639
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,224
- Yes. Enjoy.
- Margot: Longing and regret.

640
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,935
My favorite.

641
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,274
Anne: She's staring again.

642
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,525
Where do we know her from?

643
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,735
We don't.

644
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,155
Well, she really does look like Claire.

645
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,074
Why do you keep saying that? She doesn't.

646
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,076
You don't think so?

647
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,619
She's nothing like our Claire.

648
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,206
That same faraway face.

649
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,958
Can we not obsess? Please?

650
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,920
I know. Hypothetically,
if you were leaving...

651
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,522
- Felicity: Right.
- Which you're not...

652
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,757
- Felicity: Mmm-hmm.
- What would you be leaving for?

653
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,676
Associate development co-exec.

654
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,260
And what the hell is that?

655
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:27,015
It's in development, so I'd be developing
or helping to develop things...

656
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,701
Why would that be better
than working for me?

657
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,161
Well, because there's a future there.

658
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,645
- It's a corporate...
- Right. Right.

659
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,981
A different kind of future.
Does that make sense?

660
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,065
At the corporate...

661
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,584
Thank god it's all
just hypothetical anyway.

662
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,943
(Slowik claps)

663
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,070
The next course is called "memory."

664
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,239
And that is what it's meant to evoke.

665
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,740
A memory.

666
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,951
So, let me tell you a memory of mine.

667
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,246
When I was growing up,
a child in Waterloo, Iowa,

668
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,040
Tuesday was taco night.

669
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,417
George: Oh, yeah!

670
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,543
Taco Tuesday!

671
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,294
- George: Yeah!
- (Guests laugh)

672
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,714
And this, here, this lady here.

673
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,923
This is my mother.

674
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,550
(Guests exclaim)

675
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,051
As you can see, she's rather drunk.

676
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,846
- (Guests chuckle)
- This is not unusual.

677
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,973
When I was seven years old,

678
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,476
one Tuesday, my father
came home quite drunk.

679
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,062
Really drunk.

680
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,939
Also, not unusual.

681
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,609
My mother grew angry and screamed at him,

682
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,779
at which point,
he proceeded to wrap a telephone cord

683
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,531
around her neck and pull it tight.

684
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,742
I wept.

685
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,369
I screamed, I begged him to stop.

686
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,954
To make him stop,

687
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,459
I finally had to stab him in the thigh
with kitchen scissors.

688
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,506
You remember that, mother, don't you?

689
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,469
Now, I suppose I should've
stabbed him in the throat that evening.

690
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,680
But we're not so smart when we're young.

691
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,183
It was, as you can imagine,

692
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,186
as a very memorable taco night.

693
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,124
- George: Oh, thank god he didn't.
- I mean, what the fuck was that?

694
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,983
- Theatrical.
- Felicity: You liked that?

695
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:03,320
Yeah, it's a backstory to what
makes him a chef artist.

696
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,406
Dude, that guy's got some
really dark sense of humor, bro.

697
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,850
George: He's such an intense dude.

698
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,412
Slowik: So, here you have

699
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,208
house-smoked bresse
chicken thigh al pastor

700
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,002
and our own tortillas
made with heirloom masa,

701
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,922
- one of hawthorn's signature dishes.
- Thank you.

702
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,175
Slowik: We change our menu constantly,
but, as Ms. Bloom knows,

703
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,677
this has been a staple since day one.

704
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,055
It's what you once said...

705
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,723
Put you on the map.

706
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,100
Slowik: Put me on the map.

707
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,560
Precisely what map would that be...

708
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,145
I wonder.

709
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:41,274
Anyways, because we're always innovating,
and we fear irrelevance,

710
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,319
an update to a classic.

711
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,824
The images on the tortillas have been made
using a laser-engraving machine.

712
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,267
It's the first time we've used it.

713
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:55,163
We hope this taco night evokes
strong memories for us all.

714
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,248
Enjoy.

715
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,375
(Lillian chuckles softly)

716
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,920
Well, of course he had to do a taco.

717
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,755
Ted: Here you are.

718
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,050
What are they, lil?

719
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,585
Lillian: They're restaurants.

720
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,887
Um...

721
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,685
That I reviewed that all closed.

722
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,769
Ted: Oh!

723
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,104
Like a gag, then?

724
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,939
Lillian: Um, I think so.

725
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,890
Anne: Richard, what are these?

726
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,819
Taco things. For the tacos.

727
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,822
No, the pictures. They're all of us.

728
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,788
This one is after you had the melanoma
removed from your forehead.

729
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:37,998
There's the bandage.

730
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,521
Isn't that nice? They remembered us.

731
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,877
Margot: Tyler, is that you?

732
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,046
Yeah. They're all me from tonight
taking fucking photos.

733
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,966
- (Tyler sighs)
- Jesus Christ, what's with this guy?

734
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,093
I knew it. He hates me.

735
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,012
God damn it.
I didn't think he'd really mind.

736
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,598
- Should I apologize?
- Apologize for what?

737
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,641
George: Oh... (Laughs)
Felicity: What?

738
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,227
<i>Calling doctor sunshine.</i>

739
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,897
Oh, my god. I forgot
about that one. (Laughs)

740
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,732
Dumb part. Bad script.

741
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,816
Fun shoot, though.

742
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,777
Hmm. Maybe it's a joke
'cause you're friends, right?

743
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,655
Yeah, yeah, you know, friends.

744
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,450
I mean, you know, do I have any friends?

745
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,661
Soren: Wait. Um...

746
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,644
(Stammers) Hey, guys, what the fuck?

747
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,124
Dave: Are these...

748
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,960
How did they get these?

749
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,381
It's not good.

750
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,676
Bryce: Uh, excuse me.

751
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,721
(Clears throat)

752
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,283
- Can I help you, sir?
- (Clears throat)

753
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,558
Yeah. What...

754
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,644
What the hell are these?

755
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,187
These are tortillas.

756
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,272
(Speaking Spanish)

757
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,274
(In English) Yes, and what are these?

758
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,902
These are tortillas

759
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,780
which contain echobrite's tax records
and other documents,

760
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,908
showing how your company
has created invoices with fake charges.

761
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,244
How did you get these?

762
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:00,121
I'm sorry, but chef
never reveals his recipes.

763
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,290
(Scoffs) Do you know how fucked you are?

764
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,479
We'll have this place closed
by the morning. Do you understand?

765
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,088
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.

766
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,298
Enjoy.

767
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,093
Anne: And this is you and...

768
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,846
Who is that woman?

769
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,142
Uh...

770
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,563
(Scoffs)

771
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,400
Well, how the hell
should I know? It's faked.

772
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,861
It's some sort of stupid joke.

773
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,281
Soren: It's a fucking taco, okay?
It can't hurt you.

774
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,284
Yeah, a fucking taco
that might hold up in court.

775
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:40,245
We have plausible deniability,
and if they try to turn us in...

776
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,389
Soren: (Snaps fingers) Right!

777
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,581
If they turn us in,
they'd be turning verrick in.

778
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,309
And then they'd be
just as fucked as we are.

779
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,459
Right? So, we're fine.

780
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,461
Right?

781
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,607
- Yeah, we're good.
- We're fine. Yeah, fuck it.

782
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,526
They can't take your photograph
without your consent. This is insane.

783
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,010
Stop talking and let me think, okay?

784
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,178
I have to make this right somehow.
I have to.

785
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,781
Well, I'll tell you how you make it right.

786
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,765
You send this shit back. Excuse me.

787
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,226
- Excuse me! Sir, hi.
- Hey. Margot! Margot!

788
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,229
Did you just fucking snap at me?

789
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,249
Do you know how long I've been
trying to get a reservation here?

790
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,566
No, and I don't really care.

791
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,110
You do not send shit back
to this kitchen, you child.

792
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,130
You thank them for
even letting you in the door.

793
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,132
- What did you just call me?
- I called you a child

794
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:17,258
because you're fucking acting like it.

795
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,492
Tyler, you need to apologize
to me right now.

796
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,636
You cannot speak to me that way.

797
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,060
Actually, I can because,
ding dong, I'm the one who's paying.

798
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,539
So maybe, shut up and eat.

799
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,210
Mmm. Oh, my god.

800
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,839
Oh, my god.

801
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,592
This is incredible. You have to try this.

802
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,178
No, thanks. Don't let me interrupt.

803
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,061
Miss mills?

804
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,521
How can I assist you?

805
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,232
Just looking for the ladies' room.

806
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,317
Right this way.

807
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,278
Thank you.

808
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,989
What's behind that silver door?

809
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,283
Something very special.

810
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,131
(Door lock clicks)

811
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,105
(Lighter clicks)

812
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,610
(Door unlocking)

813
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,986
No, you can't...

814
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,535
(Door closes, lock clicks)

815
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,661
You shouldn't be in here.

816
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,372
I'd like to know specifically what it was

817
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,208
about the last course
that you did not enjoy.

818
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,085
You've barely eaten the food.

819
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,169
Why?

820
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,464
I need to know. Why don't you eat?

821
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,757
Why do you care?

822
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,052
I take my work very seriously,
and you're not eating.

823
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,555
And that wounds me.

824
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,780
I guess I'm just not very hungry.

825
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,533
I've told you who I am.

826
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,202
I'm Julian slowik, and I am the chef here.

827
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,662
Now, who are you?

828
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:33,418
I'll ask again. Who are you?

829
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,669
I'm Margot mills.

830
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,255
So, where are you from, Margot?

831
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,341
I'm from grand island, Nebraska.

832
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,490
Now, does that make you feel better?

833
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,613
You want the address for mom's
trailer park, you asshole?

834
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,723
No, it's not who you want me
to think you are.

835
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,058
Who are you?

836
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,519
I am Margot.

837
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,814
You shouldn't be here tonight.

838
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,442
Please get the fuck out of my way.

839
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,447
(Eerie music playing)

840
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,455
(Door opens, closes)

841
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,881
(Indistinct chatter)

842
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,972
Still very theatrical, but minimalist,

843
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,974
like the Japanese,
the "minimirasuto" style.

844
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,059
(Tense music playing)

845
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,019
Lillian: But he was being playful, right?

846
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,145
Ted: Yes.

847
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,498
Lillian: I mean,
let's talk about the tacos.

848
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,232
It's a dialogue. It's playful.

849
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,031
(Slowik claps)

850
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,451
I'm excited.

851
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,161
We're ready for our next course,

852
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,247
- which I think you'll find...
- Excuse me.

853
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,082
But what the hell is going on here?

854
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,668
Would you just let me finish, please?
That okay?

855
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,087
Thank you.

856
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,926
Ladies and gentlemen,
please meet sous-chef Jeremy louden.

857
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,554
(Clapping)

858
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,475
Jeremy created the next dish.

859
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,936
It's called "the mess."

860
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,855
Originally from sparks, Nevada,

861
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:21,401
Jeremy studied at the culinary institute
in Hyde park.

862
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,446
Jeremy's goal, as he wrote
in a heartfelt letter,

863
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,907
was to work for me here at hawthorn.

864
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,702
Isn't that right, Jeremy?

865
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,453
- Yes, chef.
- (Clicks tongue)

866
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,832
Jeremy is talented.

867
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,710
He's good.

868
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,462
He's very good. (Sniffles)

869
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,257
(Clicks tongue) But he's not great.

870
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,969
He'll never be great.

871
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,058
He desperately wants
my prestige, my job, my talent.

872
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,396
He aspires to greatness,
but he'll never achieve it.

873
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,691
Correct, Jeremy?

874
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,192
Yes, chef.

875
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,153
Like me at his age,

876
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,615
Jeremy has forsaken everything
to achieve his goals.

877
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,536
Like mine, his life is pressure.

878
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,956
Pressure to put out
the best food in the world.

879
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:21,753
And even when all goes right,
and the food is perfect,

880
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,256
and the customers are happy,
and the critics are, too,

881
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,134
there is no way to avoid the mess.

882
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,095
The mess you make of your life,

883
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:34,641
of your body, of your sanity,

884
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:41,481
by giving everything you have
to pleasing people you will never know.

885
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,150
Jeremy...

886
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,861
do you like this life?

887
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,696
This life that you dreamed about?

888
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,949
- No, chef.
- Mmm-hmm.

889
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,284
And do you want my life?

890
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,996
Not my position, nor my talent.

891
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,081
My life.

892
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,044
No, chef. (Breath trembling)

893
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,011
(Kisses)

894
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,395
Ladies and gentlemen, your fourth course,

895
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:24,107
- sous-chef Jeremy's the mess.
- (Clapping)

896
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,112
- (Gun fires)
- (Guests scream)

897
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,717
- George: Fuck!
- (Sinister music playing)

898
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,909
Anne: Oh, god!

899
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,536
Soren: What are you doing?

900
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,455
What's wrong with you?

901
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,290
Lillian: The fuck is that?

902
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,711
That was a shock.
I didn't see that comin'.

903
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,379
Soren: What the fuck, man?

904
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,922
Slowik: Please. Sit. Sit.

905
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,233
Sommelier: Everything's fine.
Slowik: Please, it's all fine.

906
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,175
- What happened?
- It's just part of the menu.

907
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,844
- It's part of the show.
- It's a show?

908
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,470
George: That's a show? That's not...

909
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,180
This is what you're paying for.

910
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,449
George: That's a stunt?
(Stutters) What was that?

911
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,726
Slowik: This is an exclusive experience.

912
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:00,994
- Please just...
- Soren: What the fuck, man?

913
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,103
Return to your seats.

914
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,230
Thank you so much.

915
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,066
Dave: Is he dead?

916
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,544
Felicity: It's definitely
a squib or a packed...

917
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,628
- Stay right there.
- Can I invite you

918
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,921
- to sit down, please?
- Felicity: I've seen them

919
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,505
- use it before.
- Dave: It's not funny.

920
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,198
What the fuck?

921
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,801
- Is this real?
- Bryce: What is happening?

922
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,035
George: It looks so damn real.
Lillian: No, no, no.

923
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,288
This is just theater, right?

924
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,765
Soren: What the fuck
are you talking about, lady?

925
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,249
He just fucking shot himself, okay?

926
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,626
Ted: It looked very real, Lillian.
Quite real.

927
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,962
This is... this is just theater.
It's stagecraft.

928
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,046
Is it really?

929
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,441
Lillian: Yeah. This is what he does.

930
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,091
It's part of the menu.

931
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,512
(Tense music playing)

932
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,154
- Eat!
- (Gasps)

933
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,035
Enjoy.

934
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,453
(Suspenseful music playing)

935
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,252
Fifth course on order.

936
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,545
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

937
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,341
Tyler, what the hell is going on?

938
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,010
Sommelier: And here we have
a biodynamic cabernet franc

939
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,305
from our friends at domaine breton.

940
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:24,227
It has no added sulfites,
a bit of barnyard funk,

941
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:28,022
and just a wonderful match
with roasted proteins. Enjoy.

942
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,525
- We're leaving. Now.
- (Stutters) But I have to get my wrap.

943
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,109
- Forget your wrap. Get up.
- But I...

944
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,194
Elsa: Mr. Leibrandt?

945
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,463
- We're leaving.
- Is something wrong?

946
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:35,530
We're leaving.

947
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,740
There is no boat to leave on.

948
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:38,991
Then I'll call a helicopter.

949
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,369
That would be very difficult
without phone service.

950
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,246
Fucking move.

951
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,089
Jesus. Just do what they say,
for god's sake!

952
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,749
I'll handle this.

953
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,502
- Just let me handle this.
- With which hand, Mr. Leibrandt?

954
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,628
What?

955
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,548
With which hand will you
handle this? Left or right?

956
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,299
What the fuck are you saying?

957
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,384
Shall we choose?

958
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,052
Richard: Choose what?

959
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,721
Very well. Left hand.

960
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,181
Ring finger.

961
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,434
Let me out! Let me out!

962
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,561
No!

963
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,913
- (Richard whimpers)
- George: Come on. Come on.

964
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,017
- Leave the guy alone.
- What the fuck are you doing?

965
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,024
Soren: Come on. Easy. Easy!
Leave him alone!

966
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:13,377
George: Leave the old guy alone!

967
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,695
Mr. Leibrandt, please hold still.

968
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,946
- (Cleaver thuds)
- (Screams)

969
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,149
- (Guests scream)
- (Screams)

970
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,532
(Guests gasp)

971
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,410
What the fuck are you doing?

972
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,873
- Anne: Richard!
- (Richard crying in pain)

973
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:27,999
Richard!

974
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,085
Please stay seated.

975
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,880
(Richard continues crying)

976
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,339
Please stay seated.

977
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,844
Felicity: What the...

978
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,447
George: What the hell's goin' on?
Get a doctor for him.

979
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,181
Do you need assistance finding your seat?

980
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,868
There's a finger. The finger.
There's a finger right there.

981
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,518
The man is screamin' in pain!

982
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,936
Slowik: Please, sit.

983
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,021
Sir?

984
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,690
Soren: It's not funny, lady! Jesus Christ!

985
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,984
- It's all part of the menu.
- (Lillian laughing)

986
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,278
Lillian: Oh, my god!

987
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,447
This is real, isn't it? I can't do it.

988
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,593
- I can't do a hostage thing. I can't.
- Then why don't you go talk to him?

989
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,303
Go talk to him!
Because you know him, right?

990
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,411
I made that up.

991
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,621
Why?

992
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,374
Because I'm a name-dropping whore.
That's why, okay?

993
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,002
(Richard crying in pain)

994
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,966
Elsa: Your husband's ring, madam.

995
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,221
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

996
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,556
Lillian: Ted. Ted!

997
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,936
I honestly think that this whole thing
is just for our benefit.

998
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,354
I mean, us.

999
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:35,149
That's why he texted me.
And this is incredible. Right?

1000
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,318
The acting is astonishing.

1001
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,841
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1002
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,490
Chef slowik would like
to see you in the kitchen.

1003
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,494
Tyler: Can I come, too?
Elsa: No.

1004
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,181
No, no, I'm sorry, but you're all wrong.

1005
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,367
- (Chuckles)
- Why are you doing this?

1006
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,725
You're just simply wrong.

1007
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,102
What are you talking about?

1008
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:12,687
Who are you?

1009
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:14,647
Margot.

1010
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,941
My name is Margot.

1011
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,777
I've served many margots.
You're not a Margot.

1012
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,488
- No.
- What the fuck does it matter?

1013
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,324
It matters because this menu,
this guest list,

1014
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,327
this entire evening
has been painstakingly planned.

1015
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,955
And you were not a part of that plan.

1016
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,749
And it's spoiling everything.

1017
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,586
In order to proceed,
I have to know where to seat you.

1018
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,214
With us, or with them?

1019
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,508
It's really... it's very important.

1020
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,136
And then you'll let me live?

1021
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,512
Let you live? No!

1022
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,264
Of course not.

1023
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,809
Can't you see that
that would ruin the menu?

1024
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,145
We're all gonna die tonight.

1025
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,230
Isn't that right?

1026
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,314
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

1027
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,984
So, the question is,

1028
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,487
do you wanna die with those who give,
or with those who take?

1029
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,740
But I die either way?

1030
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,742
It's arbitrary.

1031
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,536
No, it's not arbitrary.
Nothing in this kitchen is arbitrary.

1032
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,164
Please pick.

1033
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,250
These decisions are important, and, uh,

1034
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,961
our menu is strictly timed.

1035
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,422
In 15 minutes,

1036
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:27,261
I'll take a break between courses,
and that is how long you have to decide.

1037
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,056
It's our side or theirs.

1038
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,474
(Timer ticking)

1039
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,277
In the meantime,
please return to your seat.

1040
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,061
The next dish is exquisite.

1041
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,277
- Plating in five!
- Cooking team: Yes, chef!

1042
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,946
- I love you all.
- Cooking team: We love you, too, chef!

1043
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,281
(Ominous music playing)

1044
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,203
Tyler: Fuck!
He offer you a kitchen course?

1045
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,121
All right, what was it? Protein or veg?

1046
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,043
Protein or veg? Hmm?

1047
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,465
God damn it. It's not fucking fair.

1048
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,258
Why do you get a kitchen course?

1049
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,512
You smoke all day.
Can't even fucking taste it.

1050
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,222
(Breath trembling)

1051
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,168
Bryce: We're cornered. Let's focus.

1052
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:26,403
Wait, what's the play here?
What are our options?

1053
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:30,241
Dave: The door is guarded,
but it could be a play.

1054
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,409
Bryce: Yeah.

1055
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,537
Has anybody seen
down the hallway if we can...

1056
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,915
Hey, guys. We gotta do something,
and we can't be cowards.

1057
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,851
This worked in a movie
I did called <i>the assault.</i>

1058
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,437
When they bring their knives and forks,
we just storm their kitchen, okay?

1059
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,106
You think we have
better knife skills than them?

1060
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,440
George: What other choice do we have?

1061
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,733
Dave: I don't fuckin' know, man.

1062
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:47,925
Bryce: So what, then? We...

1063
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,219
Fuck it. I'm gonna break
this fucking window.

1064
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,346
- George: Yeah! Go for it! Go for it!
- (Yells)

1065
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,974
(Muffled yelling)

1066
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,768
(Yelling)

1067
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,982
Fuck!

1068
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,569
Please let me help you back to your table.

1069
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,653
Fuck.

1070
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,073
I'm sorry, man.

1071
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:13,909
(Claps)

1072
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,828
- God.
- Soren: Fuck.

1073
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,413
Slowik: There's a saying.

1074
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,999
"Sometimes all you need
is a good cup of tea."

1075
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,503
I learned that growing up in Bratislava.

1076
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:27,006
I've found that not only
does tea cleanse the palate,

1077
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:31,552
but it offers a soothing balm
when facing some hard home truths.

1078
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,388
But before we continue,

1079
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:38,184
are there any questions
about me or hawthorn?

1080
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,436
Any questions?

1081
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,562
(Coughs)

1082
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,024
Is this bergamot I'm getting, chef?

1083
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,193
Yes, it is.

1084
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,195
- George: (Clears throat) Chef?
- Yes?

1085
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:52,781
Uh, I think I speak for everybody here
when I say that, uh...

1086
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,618
I wanna know... I mean, we wanna know...

1087
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,411
Why the fuck is this happening, man?

1088
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,289
Slowik: Well, I'll tell you.
Think of yourselves as ingredients

1089
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,499
in a degustation concept.

1090
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:05,002
- What?
- Slowik: A tasting concept.

1091
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,588
Figuratively speaking. (Chuckles)

1092
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,391
I think that is the best way
to describe it.

1093
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,260
But none of this should be
a surprise to most of you.

1094
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,095
Ms. Bloom.

1095
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:19,725
Lillian, if I may,
my cherished early advocate

1096
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:23,312
knows the damage she has done
to so many livelihoods.

1097
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,814
No, no, no. (Stutters) Hang on, chef.

1098
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,566
Slowik: No, no, no. No, you don't talk.

1099
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,817
Ted: I'm sorry, chef.

1100
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,778
You submitted to an interview

1101
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,696
- with Lillian bloom.
- Slowik: What? What?

1102
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,257
And that interview
created this restaurant.

1103
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,825
Slowik: You enable her filth.
You enable her filth.

1104
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,744
You buttress.

1105
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,287
You coddle.

1106
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,998
Server: More broken emulsion, madam.

1107
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:46,335
Slowik: You loved that I texted you
an invitation for this evening.

1108
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,255
Me yearning for your attendance. (Scoffs)

1109
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,966
Your ego was fed.
But that is to be expected.

1110
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,968
And no, you've fed my ego as well.

1111
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,762
Ten minutes, Ms. Mills.

1112
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,224
Please. My... my husband
needs to go to the hospital.

1113
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,268
I'm fine. Just let my wife go.

1114
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,270
My loyal regulars.

1115
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:07,731
How many times have you eaten here
in the last five years?

1116
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,400
I don't know. Six or seven?

1117
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:13,737
- I think it's more than that, dick.
- Eleven. Eleven times.

1118
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:17,616
Most people consider themselves blessed
if they eat here only once.

1119
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,867
(Sighs)

1120
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,662
Mr. Leibrandt,
kindly name one dish you ate

1121
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,664
the last time you were here.

1122
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,335
(Clicks tongue)

1123
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,963
Eleven times you take the boat out here

1124
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,675
where we introduce every dish
every single time.

1125
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,011
We tell you exactly
what we're feeding you.

1126
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:40,347
Please tell me one dish you ate
the last time you were here.

1127
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,391
Or the time before.

1128
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,852
One. Please.

1129
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:49,481
- (Whispers) COD.
- What?

1130
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,234
COD.

1131
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,069
COD.

1132
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,905
It wasn't COD, you donkey.

1133
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,532
It was Halibut.

1134
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,076
Rare, fucking spotted Halibut.

1135
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,162
What does it matter?

1136
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,456
It matters to the Halibut, Mrs. Leibrandt.

1137
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:09,251
And to the artist whose work
turns to shit inside your gut.

1138
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,586
(Clicks tongue)

1139
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,880
I've allowed my work
to reach the price point

1140
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,800
where only the class of people
in this room can access it.

1141
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,969
And I've been fooled
into trying to satisfy

1142
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,722
people who could never be satisfied.

1143
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,391
Starting with her.

1144
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,727
But that's our culture, isn't it?

1145
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,104
And my restaurant is part of the problem.

1146
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,190
You say it's your restaurant.

1147
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,318
But if we're all just bein'
honest tonight, it's not.

1148
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,280
You're right.
Doug verrick is my angel investor.

1149
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:40,699
He owns this island and this restaurant.

1150
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:44,203
And since hawthorn is my entire life,

1151
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,872
I would have to say
that Doug verrick owns me.

1152
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,208
Except now things are
a little more complicated,

1153
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,710
and I own Doug verrick.

1154
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:56,048
- (Laughing)
- (Eerie choral music playing)

1155
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,883
(Groaning)

1156
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,011
Bryce: Oh, Jesus.
Margot: Oh, my god.

1157
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,055
Bryce: Holy shit.

1158
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,657
Soren: Hey, hey. How do we stop this, man?

1159
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,401
- No.
- Okay? Just please just make it stop.

1160
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,787
Just fuckin' tell us how to stop this.
We'll stop it, okay?

1161
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,955
- Slowik: You can't stop it.
- Obviously, we have money.

1162
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,940
Just say how much,
and we'll give it to you!

1163
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,359
Just say a fucking number, man!

1164
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,445
Slowik: No. I don't need your money.

1165
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,908
(Dave whimpers)

1166
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,368
(Groans)

1167
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,872
He kept you open through covid, you prick!

1168
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:32,459
Slowik: Yes, he did.
And he questioned my menu.

1169
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:37,798
He would even request substitutions
despite the fact that

1170
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:42,344
there are no substitutions at hawthorn!

1171
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,348
Fallen angel, please.

1172
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,147
Doug: No! No, no!

1173
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,649
Bryce: What the hell?

1174
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,942
Soren: No. Slowik: Listen.

1175
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,944
- This is fucking...
- I said, "listen."

1176
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,655
Doug: No! Julian!

1177
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,633
- Soren: This is fuckin' insane.
- I said, "listen."

1178
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:04,658
Felicity: No...

1179
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,805
- Slowik: (Shushes) Listen.
- Soren: No, no. This is fuckin' insane.

1180
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,038
Slowik: No, I said, "listen!"

1181
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,708
- Just listen!
- (Guests gasping)

1182
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,834
Yeah.

1183
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,544
(Muffled screaming)

1184
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,338
Do you hear?

1185
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,883
And...

1186
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,886
And...

1187
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:28,015
under he goes, and...

1188
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,101
- quiet.
- (Timer ticking)

1189
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:32,311
Do you hear it?

1190
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,355
Do you hear that silence?
Listen, can you hear it?

1191
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,026
That silence means...

1192
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,612
I'm free.

1193
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,602
- (Timer ringing)
- (Felicity gasps)

1194
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,455
Elsa: Time's up, Ms. Mills.

1195
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,082
Chef will speak with you now
in his office.

1196
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,882
(Knocking at door)

1197
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:04,593
Come in.

1198
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,980
You've made your decision?

1199
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:19,233
- I have.
- And what have you decided?

1200
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,528
That you were right.

1201
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,864
I shouldn't be here.

1202
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,283
And I say this with respect,

1203
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,911
because I'm sure
that you're quite brilliant,

1204
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:35,374
but, um, all of this is not meant for me.

1205
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,669
You're not sure I'm brilliant,
so don't say it. It's false.

1206
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,337
Fine.

1207
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:42,339
I'm not sure that you're brilliant.

1208
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,049
Oh, I was expecting more.

1209
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,634
Fuck you!

1210
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,428
I guess I'm gonna have to make
your decision for you.

1211
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,308
You belong here with your own breed.

1212
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,478
And what breed is that?

1213
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,188
With the shit shovelers.

1214
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,440
You thought I couldn't tell?

1215
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:04,611
Oh, I know a fellow
service industry worker when I see one.

1216
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,365
Mr. Leibrandt. How do you know him?

1217
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,660
You've been eyeing him all evening.

1218
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,746
- Well, I think you know.
- No, I don't.

1219
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,126
So, he paid for an experience.

1220
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:23,005
And I can tell,
as one provider of experiences to another,

1221
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,090
that you don't rattle easily.

1222
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:28,135
- So, how did he rattle you?
- (Scoffs)

1223
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,636
- He didn't rattle...
- Margot.

1224
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,057
He told me to agree
with everything he said

1225
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,827
and continue eye contact
while he jerked off.

1226
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,394
Wow. Specific.

1227
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,645
Not really.

1228
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,106
Pretty unoriginal.

1229
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,735
What rattled me

1230
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,113
is that he told me
to tell him that he was a good man,

1231
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,406
and that I was his daughter,

1232
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,742
and that he loved me,
and I loved him and...

1233
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,285
And so, he's a romantic.

1234
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,705
- (Scoffs)
- No, I don't need details.

1235
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,042
You know, I...
I know what a bad customer is.

1236
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,462
(Ominous music playing)

1237
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,588
Yeah.

1238
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,384
Do you enjoy providing your services?

1239
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,263
Yes.

1240
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,266
Or I... I used to.

1241
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,437
Do you enjoy providing yours?

1242
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,731
Oh, I used to,

1243
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,486
but I haven't desired to cook
for someone in ages.

1244
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,073
And one does miss that feeling.

1245
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,409
Come with me.

1246
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,998
Slowik: (Clapping) Everyone's so down!

1247
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:43,335
Ladies and gentlemen, for our next course,

1248
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,129
let us take the evening air!

1249
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,673
Come on! Outside!

1250
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:49,966
- Sommelier: Please, sir.
- Come on. Outside, everyone.

1251
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,778
Soren: If we can find a boat,
we can make a break for it.

1252
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:54,179
Slowik: Regulars, too. Come on.
Elsa: Please follow chef.

1253
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,849
Chef, I'd love to talk to you
very quickly, chef.

1254
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:59,535
Slowik: Come on!
Sommelier: After you, please.

1255
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,852
Guests first.

1256
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,229
(Richard groans)

1257
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,563
Anne: Richard.

1258
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,361
Slowik: Follow me.

1259
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,364
Into the tranquil night air.

1260
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:23,417
Don't be frightened.
Nothing to be frightened of.

1261
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:27,980
So, maybe there's a spare boat somewhere
and we can get out of here.

1262
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,256
To what?

1263
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,882
- What?
- Get out of here to what?

1264
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,443
What the fuck are you talking about, bro?

1265
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,593
- We're dead.
- It's okay.

1266
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:34,779
No. We're gonna die tonight.

1267
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:35,971
- Yes, we are. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1268
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:40,350
Slowik: Our next course will be presented
by sous-chef, Katherine Keller.

1269
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,065
Good evening, everyone.

1270
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,527
Three years ago,

1271
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,946
Julian slowik tried to fuck me.

1272
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,991
I refused his advances.

1273
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,326
A week later, he tried again.

1274
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,579
And again, I refused.

1275
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:03,457
But he didn't fire me.

1276
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,041
No.

1277
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,169
He kept me in his kitchen,

1278
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:12,924
and refused to look me in the eye
or speak directly to me for eight months.

1279
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,635
He can do that.

1280
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:18,054
Because he's the star.

1281
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,932
He's the man.

1282
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:25,479
Our next course is called "man's folly."

1283
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,656
- (Squelching)
- (Guests gasp)

1284
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,117
- (Slowik groans)
- (Guests groan)

1285
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,875
(Dramatic music playing)

1286
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,340
I'm sorry.

1287
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,429
- (Slowik groans)
- (Guests groan)

1288
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,264
Soren: Fuck.

1289
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:05,936
To our male diners,
we now offer you the chance to escape.

1290
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,231
You'll be given a 45-second head start,

1291
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:12,901
at which point members of my staff
will try and catch you.

1292
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,402
If they do catch...

1293
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,904
- (Soren grunting)
- Okay.

1294
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,616
Forty-five seconds starts now.

1295
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,284
(Timer ticking)

1296
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,286
- Hold this.
- What?

1297
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,372
I'm sorry. Come on. You know I'm awful.

1298
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,082
Ted: You're a wonderful critic. (Kisses)

1299
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,252
I'll... I'll send for help. First thing.

1300
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,050
(Chuckles softly)

1301
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,471
You, too.

1302
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:50,438
I'll, uh, leave you to it.

1303
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,221
Katherine: Care to join me inside?

1304
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,947
It's getting chilly.

1305
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,158
It's right this way.

1306
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:05,996
Lillian: Okay.

1307
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,622
This way.

1308
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,422
(Door closes)

1309
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,347
- (Timer ringing)
- Go!

1310
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:35,567
Felicity: Thank you.
Anne: Thank you.

1311
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,284
(Tense music playing)

1312
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,788
- (Wistful music playing)
- Mmm.

1313
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:50,832
Lillian: This is fantastic.

1314
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:55,420
The tartness of the umeboshi
and the waves of ferment.

1315
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,631
It's rich, and yet it's clean.

1316
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,007
It's delicious.

1317
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,260
Yes, well, there was a time

1318
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,304
that would have meant
a lot to me, Ms. Bloom.

1319
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,309
(Sniffles)

1320
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,230
(Sobbing)

1321
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,899
Margot: Mmm.

1322
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,025
Felicity: It's so good.

1323
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,836
Anne: Yes, it's really good.
Margot: Mmm-hmm.

1324
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,404
You know, it's the emoji for me.

1325
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,031
- Umeboshi.
- Felicity: Hmm?

1326
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,449
- Umeboshi.
- Felicity: Umeboshi.

1327
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,784
Lillian: This is so good.

1328
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,220
Felicity: You're very talented.
Katherine: Thank you.

1329
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,039
Usually don't like foam, but...

1330
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,125
Soren: Don't fucking run next to me, bro!

1331
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,436
Bryce: No, you're running next to me!

1332
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,140
Soren: It's a big fuckin' forest!
Fuck off!

1333
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,970
Bryce: Get away from me!
Soren: Fuck off, bro!

1334
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:41,967
(Tense music playing)

1335
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,051
Fuck.

1336
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,719
Soren: Oh, my god.

1337
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,138
Yeah.

1338
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,810
Anne: So...

1339
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,563
You know my husband.

1340
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,817
(Screaming)

1341
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,405
(Coughs) Um...

1342
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,574
Yeah.

1343
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,243
I do.

1344
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:10,787
Right.

1345
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,503
Felicity: You can tell us.

1346
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:20,839
Are we all really dying tonight?

1347
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,218
It doesn't work if you live.

1348
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,929
- Anne: What doesn't work?
- The menu.

1349
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,014
Felicity: Why not?

1350
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,016
It needs an ending...

1351
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,031
That ties everything together
conceptually.

1352
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,821
Otherwise, it just tastes good,
and who cares.

1353
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,097
Lillian: I mean, really,
you should have your own place.

1354
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,818
Right? And I could help you with that.

1355
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,718
- I'm sure you could, Ms. Bloom.
- Lillian: I could. I could.

1356
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,365
We would just have
to talk about... (Stutters)

1357
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,410
(Chuckles nervously) ...The dying thing.

1358
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,663
Oh, everyone dying was my pitch, actually.

1359
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,082
I'm super proud of it.

1360
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,856
- Anybody want any wine?
- Yes, please.

1361
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,964
Lillian: Fuck it.

1362
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,675
- Anne: Thank you.
- (Wine pouring)

1363
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:06,885
(Groaning loudly)

1364
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,431
I heard a pop. (Yelps)

1365
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,227
Fuck!

1366
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,229
Fuck!

1367
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,030
(Chicken clucking)

1368
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:33,661
(Gasps)

1369
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,765
Server: A special bite
for the last guest to be caught.

1370
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:39,209
A little play on the passard egg
with crème fraîche and maple.

1371
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:45,548
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1372
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:51,304
Not that you guys
give a single, flying fuck,

1373
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,556
but my name is not Margot.

1374
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,433
It's Erin.

1375
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:58,103
And I'm from brockton, Massachusetts...

1376
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,648
So there's that.

1377
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:05,401
(Door opens)

1378
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,029
Party's over.

1379
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,071
Sommelier: Come, gentlemen.

1380
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,328
- Welcome back.
- What did you get?

1381
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,412
Sommelier: Sir? Please.

1382
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,623
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'll take that. Thank you.

1383
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,166
Ms. Bloom. Please.

1384
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,253
Allow me. No, it's fine. It's fine.

1385
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,174
Here.

1386
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,176
Oh, god.

1387
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,845
(Door closes)

1388
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,543
Felicity: How'd you do out there?

1389
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,477
I did great. I killed it.

1390
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,479
I'm the only one who got away.

1391
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:44,732
I'm sorry. I'm a fuckin' failure.

1392
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,109
It's okay.

1393
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,363
I've been stealing money from you.

1394
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,615
George: I know.

1395
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:54,826
I know you know.

1396
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,954
I wrote a negative recommendation to Sony.

1397
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:00,874
I know. You cc'd me on it.

1398
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:03,585
Slowik: Folks,

1399
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:07,755
I'm afraid our menu
cannot continue as planned

1400
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,383
until we deal with an unresolved matter.

1401
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:12,594
You.

1402
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:15,638
Me?

1403
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,765
Slowik: Mmm-hmm.

1404
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:18,892
You.

1405
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:23,188
Tell me why you're here.

1406
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,567
(Grunts) You know, because I wanted to...

1407
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,651
Swallow first.

1408
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,028
(Tyler grunting, gulps)

1409
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,489
I wanted to experience your food, chef.

1410
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:34,782
And what were you told?

1411
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,620
- (Tyler stutters)
- What were you told ahead of time?

1412
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,709
You told me it'd be
the greatest menu ever created.

1413
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,544
Right. And? And?

1414
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:53,760
And that everyone would die.

1415
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,094
Slowik: "Everyone would die."

1416
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,430
- (Guests gasp)
- Slowik: You had a date.

1417
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,141
I seem to remember you had a date.

1418
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,435
Not the young woman here tonight,

1419
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:05,647
so what happened to her? Your date?

1420
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,317
She broke up with me, chef.

1421
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,985
So, you brought Margot.

1422
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,528
Tyler: Mmm-hmm. Slowik: Mmm-hmm.

1423
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:13,655
Why?

1424
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,742
'Cause you don't offer seatings for one.

1425
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,620
So, you hired her knowing she'd die.

1426
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,915
- (Tense music playing)
- (Breath trembling)

1427
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,417
- Tyler: Yes.
- You entitled piece of shit!

1428
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,128
- (Groans)
- I'm gonna kill you, Tyler!

1429
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,713
(Margot growls)

1430
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:32,590
Tyler: Calm down.

1431
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,717
(Panting)

1432
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,305
Slowik: You can't blame her, can you?

1433
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,034
For the eight months
I've corresponded with you,

1434
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:46,271
I gave you, Tyler,
access to our world, hmm.

1435
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:48,731
And I swore you to secrecy.

1436
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,067
Why do you think I'd do this?

1437
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,736
- You wanted me here because...
- Why? Why?

1438
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,780
You said I know a lot about food.

1439
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,092
Slowik: That's right.
You're not like the others, are you?

1440
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:00,118
I mean, you know what a pacojet is.

1441
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,412
- Yeah.
- Slowik: You knew what the bergamot was.

1442
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,664
- Yeah. I could taste it.
- Yeah, you could.

1443
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,332
Yeah, I know, but you identified it.

1444
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,251
- Picked it out.
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

1445
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,669
That impressed me.

1446
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,170
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

1447
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,672
- I mean, you're a cook.
- Oh!

1448
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,424
Cooks belong in the kitchen.

1449
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,426
Right?

1450
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,136
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

1451
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,220
Slowik: Yeah.

1452
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,306
- Come with me.
- Tyler: Really?

1453
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:22,807
Me? Really?

1454
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,890
Slowik: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I have something for you.

1455
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,769
Tyler: (Chuckles) Okay.

1456
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,521
Come here. Elsa has it.

1457
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,773
Ah, it's a chef's jacket.

1458
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,402
(Slowik and Tyler chuckle)

1459
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,653
Courtesy of hawthorn.

1460
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:36,988
Tyler: Wow. Slowik: Mmm-hmm.

1461
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:40,408
Ah!

1462
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,201
- Nice.
- Thank you.

1463
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,871
You look wonderful.
Doesn't he look wonderful, Margot?

1464
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,206
- Doesn't he look good?
- Cooking team: Yes, chef!

1465
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,208
Mr. Handsome boy.

1466
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:54,630
I'm gonna personalize the jacket.

1467
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,717
"T, y,

1468
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,219
"l, e,

1469
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,513
"r."

1470
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,976
Thank you. Thank you.

1471
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,270
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you, chef.

1472
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,898
Tyler, now cook.

1473
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:15,109
- What?
- Cook.

1474
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:18,529
- You're a cook. So, cook.
- Oh, I don't know if I can cook here.

1475
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:20,907
- Cook. Cook.
- Now? I don't...

1476
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,867
Cook! Go on, now.

1477
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,327
What do you need?

1478
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,096
- We have everything.
- Elsa: Please rise to observe

1479
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,264
- the demonstration.
- Don't be frightened.

1480
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:30,088
- What do you want... um...
- Please rise to observe the demonstration.

1481
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,352
Slowik: Everyone, please come around.

1482
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:34,921
Please. Tyler's gonna demonstrate
his culinary expertise.

1483
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,644
Please rise to observe the demonstration.

1484
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,317
Slowik: Everyone, please.
Come around. Come closer.

1485
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:39,467
What do you need?

1486
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,137
- Uh... leeks.
- Get the cook some leeks.

1487
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:46,057
Leeks. This is your station here.
What else?

1488
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:49,060
Um... sh... ah...

1489
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,479
Oh... shit? Would you like some shit?

1490
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:52,563
No. Uh...

1491
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,190
(Stutters) Shallots.

1492
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,025
Shallots for the great foodie!

1493
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,389
The phenomenal Mr. Food himself!

1494
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:58,545
Tyler: Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1495
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:01,072
Everyone gather around.
We must learn from Tyler.

1496
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:07,286
This is a new dicing method
of which we have been woefully ignorant.

1497
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:08,413
What next?

1498
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,415
Uh... butter.

1499
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:13,167
Butter? Butter.
Leeks and shallots sautéed in butter.

1500
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:16,045
I bear witness to a revolution in cuisine.

1501
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,005
Would you like a protein?

1502
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:20,258
- Uh... lamb.
- Lamb!

1503
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,260
(Classical music playing)

1504
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,643
Tyler: (Groans) Oh!

1505
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,022
(Tyler muttering)

1506
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,152
(Inhales deeply, exhales sharply)

1507
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,778
- (Pans clatter)
- Oh!

1508
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,572
(Pan sizzling)

1509
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:52,433
Oh, yeah. I think it's done, chef.

1510
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:53,559
You think it's done? You're sure?

1511
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,625
- Mmm-hmm.
- You wanna...

1512
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:56,309
Maybe you wanna jam it into the pacojet.

1513
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:57,879
No.

1514
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:06,345
Mmm.

1515
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:08,973
Wow.

1516
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,434
Wow.

1517
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,311
It's actually quite...

1518
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:15,313
bad.

1519
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,441
(Bell dings)

1520
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:34,916
You are why the mystery
has been drained from our art.

1521
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,503
You see that now, don't you?

1522
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,214
Sorry, chef.

1523
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,300
Come here, son. Come.

1524
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,261
Come here.

1525
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,226
(Indistinct whispering)

1526
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,160
Yes, chef.

1527
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,176
And now you're free, too.

1528
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,517
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
I wanna apologize to you all.

1529
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,062
What you just saw was not originally
part of tonight's menu.

1530
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,022
We strive for perfection,

1531
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,316
which of course does not exist,

1532
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,529
and that is a hard truth for me to accept,
so please forgive me.

1533
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:48,906
Come with me.

1534
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,224
Sommelier:
And that concludes our demonstration.

1535
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:58,583
Please return to your seats.

1536
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,126
Slowik: Listen to me.

1537
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,213
There's only one more
savory course left in our menu.

1538
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,007
That means we must prepare for dessert.

1539
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,718
- (Sighs)
- Dessert requires a large barrel

1540
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,481
that is supposed to be
there in the corner.

1541
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,722
(Chuckles softly) Do you see a barrel?

1542
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,058
Margot: No. No, I do not.
Slowik: Neither do I.

1543
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,603
That is because
my negligent colleague, Elsa,

1544
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:20,521
forgot to assign someone to bring it.

1545
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:25,818
So, Margot,
you will fetch the barrel instead.

1546
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,028
- Me?
- Slowik: Yes.

1547
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,030
You remember the smokehouse? Hmm?

1548
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,656
Margot: (Stutters) Maybe... I don't...

1549
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,283
Chef, perhaps one of us should...

1550
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,077
Slowik: Margot is now one of us, Elsa.

1551
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,245
Right, Margot?

1552
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,497
- Margot: Yes.
- Yes, what?

1553
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,417
Yes, chef.

1554
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,628
Elsa, give her the smokehouse key.

1555
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,715
Yes, chef.

1556
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,091
(Keys jingling)

1557
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:54,055
Slowik: Go.

1558
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:55,640
Go!

1559
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:56,807
Um...

1560
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:02,229
(Sinister music playing)

1561
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,233
(Dramatic music playing)

1562
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,072
(Bird squawks)

1563
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,671
(Richard breathing heavily)

1564
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,425
(Dramatic music intensifies)

1565
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,306
Excuse me. Uh...

1566
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,516
(Dramatic music fades)

1567
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,434
(Stutters) I'm sorry, chef.

1568
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,312
Sir... sir slowik. Um...

1569
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:45,940
Hi.

1570
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,024
What's up?

1571
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,069
Oh... well, look...

1572
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:54,156
What I really...
I just wanted to say because, um...

1573
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:57,094
Look, I'm not trying to sound,
like, all whatever here or anything,

1574
01:14:57,118 --> 01:15:00,496
but I just don't think it's really fair.

1575
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,706
Maybe.

1576
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:02,957
(Stutters) If...

1577
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,459
Do you wanna know
why you're being punished?

1578
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,212
(Hesitates)

1579
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,464
Sure.

1580
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:15,177
I saw the film <i>calling doctor sunshine,
</i>and I did not enjoy it.

1581
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:16,846
Wait, sorry?

1582
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,180
It was a Sunday.

1583
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,599
My one day off in months.

1584
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:22,518
The most precious day.

1585
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,353
The day where I was allowed to live.

1586
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:28,441
And I saw the film <i>calling doctor sunshine
</i>alone in the cinema.

1587
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,694
But look, I didn't direct it.
I just acted in it.

1588
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:34,321
The memory of your face in that film,

1589
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:38,743
and seeing you again now haunts me.

1590
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:39,869
Drives me.

1591
01:15:40,411 --> 01:15:44,248
What happens to an artist
when he loses his purpose?

1592
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,208
It's pitiful.

1593
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,419
No, you're right.

1594
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:53,716
And what about her?

1595
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,968
What school did you go to?

1596
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:57,845
Brown.

1597
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,096
Student loans?

1598
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,098
No.

1599
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,725
I'm sorry. You're dying.

1600
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,980
- (Switch clicks)
- (Ominous music playing)

1601
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,577
(Suspenseful music playing)

1602
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,401
- (Switch clicks)
- (Suspenseful music stops)

1603
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:08,123
Motherfucker.

1604
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,085
Really?

1605
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:26,976
(Doorknob rattling)

1606
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:31,647
Elsa: No one is allowed
inside chef's house.

1607
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,399
Do you think you're special?

1608
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:38,487
You've disobeyed this rule.

1609
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,830
I take care of the customers
so that chef can take care of the menu.

1610
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,170
You've been a nuisance
since you have arrived.

1611
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:56,463
I'm sorry.

1612
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,675
If you don't mind me asking though,

1613
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,261
why would you die for him?

1614
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,638
You will not replace me.

1615
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:08,601
Replace you?
Trust me, I have no... (Screams)

1616
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,105
- (Tense music playing)
- (Margot screaming)

1617
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,527
No, no. No!

1618
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,322
(Both grunting)

1619
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,498
(Both scream)

1620
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,252
(Both grunting and struggling)

1621
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,386
Margot: Stop! Enough!

1622
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:47,932
He didn't tell me about the barrel.

1623
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:49,850
- I didn't forget.
- (Music intensifies)

1624
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:51,685
- (Margot screams)
- (Squelching)

1625
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:53,520
Oh, my god!

1626
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:54,980
(Blood gushing)

1627
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,649
(Choking)

1628
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:04,865
(Margot groans)

1629
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,039
(Panting)

1630
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:19,505
(Tense music fades)

1631
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,555
(Suspenseful music playing)

1632
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:36,730
(Lock clicks)

1633
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:44,154
(Switch clicks)

1634
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:43,672
Oh, my god.

1635
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,174
(Gasps) Um...

1636
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,678
(Radio turns on)

1637
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:52,973
Hello?

1638
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:58,854
All: (Singing)
<i>Happy birthday, dear Bryce</i>

1639
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:04,568
<i>happy birthday to you</i>

1640
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,278
you told them it was my birthday?

1641
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,697
Seemed funny about three hours ago.

1642
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:09,948
Thank you.

1643
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:20,876
Well, leave it there and take your seat.

1644
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,505
(Panting)

1645
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:29,384
I want you to
understand something, Margot.

1646
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:37,392
I am a monster.

1647
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,229
No, was a monster.

1648
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:42,064
And a whore.

1649
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:46,276
But tonight, everything I'm doing is pure.

1650
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,444
Egoless.

1651
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:51,115
And at last, the pain is almost gone.

1652
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:53,450
Chef's hands.

1653
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,829
Asbestos hands.

1654
01:21:56,912 --> 01:22:02,126
I can carry a cast-iron from a hot oven
to your table with no protection.

1655
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,421
I can no longer be hurt, Margot.

1656
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:11,135
As Dr. King said,
"we know through painful experience

1657
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:14,805
"that freedom is never
voluntarily given by the oppressor.

1658
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:18,183
"It must be demanded by the oppressed."

1659
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,935
Did he just quote Martin Luther King?

1660
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:21,103
- Yep.
- Yes, he did.

1661
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:24,314
(Ship horn blares)

1662
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:26,066
What?

1663
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:31,530
I see you found our radio.

1664
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,740
Clear the dining room immediately!

1665
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:34,992
It's a boat!

1666
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,953
Did you call someone?

1667
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:39,121
(Sighs in relief)

1668
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,165
- It's a boat.
- It's a boat.

1669
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,545
What? What are you doing? (Groans)

1670
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:49,508
- (Richard groaning)
- George: Easy! Easy, there!

1671
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,025
Bryce: The fuck are you doing to that man?

1672
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:52,426
George: Bro, easy with that!

1673
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,054
Slowik: Tight, tight, tight.

1674
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,264
Good.

1675
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:02,895
You'll be tempted to ask him for help.

1676
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,730
- To plead, even.
- No, no, no.

1677
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:07,107
This would be unwise. He cannot help you.

1678
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:08,400
Ask yourselves two things.

1679
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:12,571
One, if you really wanna be responsible
for the death of an innocent man.

1680
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:15,949
And two, ask yourselves,
this entire evening,

1681
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,827
why didn't you all try harder
to fight back?

1682
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,537
To get out of here?

1683
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:23,123
Honestly, you probably could have.

1684
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,959
Something to think about.

1685
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:37,387
Slowik: Good evening, officer.
How can we help you?

1686
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,514
I got a report of a disturbance.

1687
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,267
Uh, here? (Scoffs)

1688
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:43,644
What kind of a disturbance?

1689
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,438
Officer: A violent one.

1690
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,821
- Are you the owner?
- I am the executive chef.

1691
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,153
Ownership changed hands recently,
but that's another story.

1692
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:55,280
Now, I don't wish to be rude,
but as you can see,

1693
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:57,032
we're right in the middle of service.

1694
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,581
Did anybody here call in a distress
over the shortwave tonight?

1695
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:08,835
(Slowik laughing softly)

1696
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:11,380
We're not in the habit
of serving our guests

1697
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:14,007
shortwave radios with their meals.

1698
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:15,509
(Cooking team laugh)

1699
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:26,603
Hey.

1700
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,355
Uh... are you...

1701
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:31,525
Yes, yes, yes. I am.

1702
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:34,152
Wow. I'm a big fan.

1703
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:35,779
Thank you.

1704
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:37,197
Would you like his autograph?

1705
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:40,993
(Hesitates) Uh...

1706
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:42,782
I don't want to bother you.

1707
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:45,497
No, no, no. It wouldn't be a bother.

1708
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,541
(Stutters) I just, I don't have a...

1709
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,960
Slowik: No, we have a pen. Let's do it.

1710
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,254
Yeah.

1711
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:53,630
Thank you.

1712
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:56,633
- What's your name?
- Dale.

1713
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:59,594
- George: Dale. What's up, Dale?
- Hi.

1714
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:02,347
- You're great.
- (Pen scribbling)

1715
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:04,683
My wife and I, we loved that, um...

1716
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,269
What's it called?
The one where you play the surgeon?

1717
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:09,980
Yeah. <i>Calling doctor sunshine.</i>

1718
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:12,691
Dale: Yeah! Yeah, great stuff.
George: Here you go.

1719
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,484
Thank you so much.

1720
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:16,278
(Chuckles)

1721
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:18,155
Okay. Um...

1722
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:23,327
Well, sorry again for bothering you folks.
Uh, I'll be leaving now.

1723
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,846
George: For all you do, man, anytime.

1724
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:26,747
Slowik: Well, thank you for your service.

1725
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:38,899
Dale: Hands on your head! Everyone! Now!

1726
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,303
- No, no. You're joking.
- (All gasp)

1727
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:42,471
You're joking.

1728
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,014
Dale: I am not joking, sir.

1729
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,725
Slowik: Come on. Clearly,
there's a misunderstanding.

1730
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:47,809
Anne: Help us!

1731
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:49,853
Felicity: Yes! Yes!
Anne: He wants to kill us all!

1732
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:52,123
Dale: Back to your seats!
Everyone! Back to your seat now!

1733
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,774
Soren: He's fucking crazy!

1734
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:55,108
Back in your chair now.

1735
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:57,652
Silence! Everyone, back to where you were.

1736
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:59,696
Sit down. Now!

1737
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:01,406
Quiet!

1738
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,075
- It's him! It's him!
- Him!

1739
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,494
- Dale: Everyone!
- He wants to kill us all!

1740
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:06,953
Dale: Do not speak!

1741
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:10,624
You.

1742
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,752
On your knees with your hands
over your head. Now.

1743
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,088
Guests: Yes! Anne: Thank you!

1744
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:20,509
- You are fucked!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1745
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:21,593
Lillian: Oh, my god!

1746
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:24,236
Soren: All these other fuckers
are with them too, sir. Watch out.

1747
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:25,972
- Dale: Calm down!
- Fuck you!

1748
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:27,391
- Dale: Stay calm.
- Fuck you!

1749
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:32,229
Nobody move until I say so. No one move!

1750
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:38,360
- No, no!
- What are you doing?

1751
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:39,486
George: Hey, hey, hey.

1752
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:40,630
Ted: Him, him, him! George: No!

1753
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:41,696
(Gun clicks)

1754
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,041
Slowik: Thank you, Dale. Thank you.

1755
01:26:58,588 --> 01:26:59,923
(Slowik grunts)

1756
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:01,049
Good job.

1757
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:06,972
So, in a kitchen we all work together,
or nothing works at all.

1758
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:09,901
- (Breathing nervously)
- We work as a team.

1759
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,188
You...

1760
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:17,941
Margot from Nebraska.

1761
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:24,865
You... you've betrayed
our sacred bond of trust.

1762
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:29,661
And you've shown your craft
to be careless.

1763
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:34,791
I was wrong.
You're an eater. You're a taker.

1764
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:37,461
Like all the rest.

1765
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:41,173
(Tense music playing)

1766
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,975
Final course! Plating in five!

1767
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:53,477
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

1768
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:58,356
(Indistinct mumbling)

1769
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,652
(Groaning)

1770
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:29,429
(Tense music fades)

1771
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:33,183
Margot: I don't like your food.

1772
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:34,351
What did you say?

1773
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:38,271
I said I don't like your food,
and I would like to send it back.

1774
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:57,165
Slowik: I'm sorry to hear that.

1775
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:00,377
What about my food is not to your liking?

1776
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:04,214
For starters,

1777
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,217
you've taken the joy out of eating.

1778
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:11,763
Every dish you served tonight
has been some intellectual exercise

1779
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:14,683
rather than something you want
to sit and enjoy.

1780
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:19,938
When I eat your food,
it tastes like it was made with no love.

1781
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:23,233
Oh, this is ridiculous.
We always cook with love.

1782
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:25,569
- Don't we?
- Cooking team: Yes, chef!

1783
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:28,446
Everyone knows love
is the most important ingredient.

1784
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,864
Then you're kidding yourself.

1785
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:34,035
Come on, chef. I thought tonight
was a night of hard home truths.

1786
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,120
This is one of them.

1787
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:37,914
You cook with obsession, not love.

1788
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:39,583
(Suspenseful music playing)

1789
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:41,376
Even your hot dishes are cold.

1790
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:43,587
You're a chef.

1791
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:47,007
Your single purpose on this earth
is to serve people food

1792
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,843
that they might actually like,
and you have failed.

1793
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:51,886
You've failed.

1794
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,346
And you've bored me.

1795
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,391
And the worst part is
I'm still fucking hungry.

1796
01:29:57,684 --> 01:29:59,686
You're... you're still hungry?

1797
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:00,770
Margot: Yes, I am.

1798
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:04,566
How hungry?

1799
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,234
Starved.

1800
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,944
Well, what are you hungry for?

1801
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:09,404
What do you have?

1802
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:10,488
Everything.

1803
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:14,659
- You know what I'd really like?
- Tell me.

1804
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:17,162
A cheeseburger.

1805
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,671
Yeah, we can do a cheeseburger.

1806
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:28,506
A real cheeseburger.

1807
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,967
Not some fancy,
deconstructed avant bullshit.

1808
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:32,886
A real cheeseburger.

1809
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:36,139
Well, I'll make you a very good,
very traditional cheeseburger.

1810
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:37,349
I don't think you can.

1811
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:41,102
I'll make you feel as if you're eating
the first cheeseburger you ever ate.

1812
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,689
The cheap one your parents
could barely afford.

1813
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,150
- Show me.
- How do you like it?

1814
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:49,069
Medium. American cheese.

1815
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:51,404
American cheese is the best cheese
for a cheeseburger,

1816
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:53,156
because it melts without splitting.

1817
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:54,479
How much will that set me back?

1818
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:55,700
$9.95.

1819
01:30:57,911 --> 01:30:59,204
That come with fries?

1820
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:01,122
- Niels.
- Yes, chef?

1821
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:03,124
- Is the fryer still on?
- Yes, chef.

1822
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:06,920
Crinkle-cut or julienne?

1823
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:08,213
(Meat sizzling)

1824
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:15,595
(Orchestral music playing)

1825
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:46,394
Hmm.

1826
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:55,278
Mmm.

1827
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:57,363
(Chuckles softly)

1828
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,116
(Music fades)

1829
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:02,285
Now that...

1830
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:06,790
is a cheeseburger.

1831
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:08,917
Yeah.

1832
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,668
That is a cheeseburger.

1833
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:18,134
Unfortunately, I think my eyes
were a little bigger than my stomach.

1834
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:22,555
Well, I understand.

1835
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:26,434
Can I get the rest to go?

1836
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:37,195
One moment, please.

1837
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:39,239
(Bell dings)

1838
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:55,964
One cheeseburger to go.

1839
01:33:58,174 --> 01:33:59,342
And a gift bag.

1840
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,640
Thank you for dining at hawthorn.

1841
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:08,685
Thank you...

1842
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,771
for, um...

1843
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,819
For everything.

1844
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:15,418
Before our final course,
there is the matter of the bill.

1845
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:19,255
We're on a no-tip system,
so gratuity is included.

1846
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,466
And please enjoy your gift bags.

1847
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:24,093
Um... some goodies in there.

1848
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,680
A booklet of our local suppliers,

1849
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:30,391
some house-made granola,

1850
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:36,397
one of Doug verrick's fingers,
and a copy of tonight's menu.

1851
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:41,694
Oh! No, no.

1852
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:43,821
It's on the magazine.

1853
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:46,449
(Eerie music playing)

1854
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:53,498
(George sighs)

1855
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:55,833
I told you you weren't leaving.

1856
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:07,637
So, once again,
thank you for dining with us tonight.

1857
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:11,933
You represent the ruin of my art

1858
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:14,560
and my life,

1859
01:36:15,478 --> 01:36:18,064
and now you get to be a part of it.

1860
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:23,528
A part of what I hope is my masterpiece.

1861
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,373
(Mellow music playing)

1862
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,016
(Guests groaning)

1863
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:17,498
Slowik: And now, our final dessert course

1864
01:37:17,582 --> 01:37:21,335
is a playful twist
on a comfort food classic.

1865
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:24,630
The s'more.

1866
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:29,844
The most offensive assault
on the human palate ever contrived.

1867
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:33,222
Unethically sourced chocolate
and gelatinized sugar water

1868
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:36,517
imprisoned by industrial-grade
Graham cracker.

1869
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:41,147
It's everything wrong with us,
and yet we associate it with innocence.

1870
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:42,440
With childhood.

1871
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:43,858
<i>Mom and dad.</i>

1872
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:50,364
But what transforms
this fucking monstrosity is fire.

1873
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:51,783
Oh, god.

1874
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,038
The purifying flame.

1875
01:37:57,622 --> 01:38:00,124
It nourishes us, warms us,

1876
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:05,630
re-invents us, forges and destroys us.

1877
01:38:06,339 --> 01:38:08,382
We must embrace the flame.

1878
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:14,514
Jesus fucking Christ! Please.

1879
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:16,224
(Engine stalling)

1880
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:19,393
(Guests gasp)

1881
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:26,067
We must be cleansed.

1882
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:28,653
Made clean.

1883
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,906
Like martyrs

1884
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:34,492
or heretics.

1885
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:37,703
- We can be subsumed...
- (Speaking indistinctly)

1886
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:40,957
and made anew.

1887
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,750
Thank you.

1888
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:44,877
- (Sighs)
- (Engine starts)

1889
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,513
I love you all!

1890
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:57,598
Cooking team: We love you, chef!

1891
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:22,206
(Engine stops)

1892
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:27,420
(Sighs)

1893
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,304
- (Distant explosion)
- (Gasps)

1894
01:40:14,967 --> 01:40:17,303
(Somber orchestral music playing)

1895
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,639
(Unsettling music playing)
