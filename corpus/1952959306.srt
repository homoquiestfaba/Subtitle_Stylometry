300
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,575
Nobody really knows.       

301
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:00,477
Probably just routine maneuvers.         

302
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,946
There's something goin'    
around, isn't there?       

303
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:06,417
They're here because       
people are gettin' sick.    

304
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,119
Everything's gonna         
be just fine.          

305
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,854
The school sent        
home a letter today        

306
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:12,489
Saying they're gonna have   
a new trial vaccine        

307
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,024
For the kids to        
try out this fall.         

308
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,826
Does that mean I've        
gotta take a shot?         

309
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,161
I ain't takin' no shot.    

310
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,262
You'll eat your supper,    

311
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,596
And you'll take a shot     
if I say you take a shot,   

312
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:21,165
Or else you'll end up like     
them boys in lake hickory.     

313
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,933
Jack!              

314
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,000
Sorry.             

315
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:26,303
Eat up.            

316
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,940
You can't even put food    
on the table anymore,      

317
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,209
And you're drinking up     
what little we do have!    

318
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,844
You're lucky what       
I do give you!         

319
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:34,911
You give me nothing,       

320
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:35,912
And you're nothing!        

321
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:36,913
You're a bum!          

322
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:38,715
And you made us all sick!   

323
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:40,717
I want you out of here!    

324
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:43,387
Get out! Get out        
     and leave us alone!        

325
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:44,788
Leave us in peace!         

326
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:47,358
Just leave us be!       

327
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,166
Look at all this candy.    

328
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,067
Want some?             

329
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,635
Your daddy gonna catch you.    

330
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,471
Not if I...            

331
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,874
See all you gotta do       
is open up the flap.       

332
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:05,642
There they are,        
ready for taking.       

333
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:07,944
Nobody will ever miss one.     

334
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:11,315
You're the luckiest kid I know.

335
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:25,061
Movie:             
Ladies and gentlemen,      

336
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:27,864
This is the third year that you
have allowed me to bring here,       

337
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:29,833
Into your theater,         
for a moment's visit,      

338
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:33,437
Some of the children you    
are helping in their fight     

339
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,406
Against that dreaded       
enemy of happy childhood,   

340
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,973
Infantile paralysis.       

341
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:40,176
I should like to show you   
that, without your help,    

342
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,946
Hundreds of children would     
be helpless cripples today.    

343
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:47,318
In the western part        
of North Carolina,         

344
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,052
Right near the great smokeys,  

345
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:51,788
 Lies the little        
town of hickory.        

346
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:53,957
Last June...           

347
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:55,125
Ladies and gentlemen...    

348
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,693
Hey, what about us?        

349
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:58,662
I'm sorry,             

350
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:00,297
But I've just been         
informed by the authorities    

351
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:03,099
That the movie theater's now   
closed until further notice.   

352
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,569
What?              

353
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,938
How come you're        
getting shut down?         

354
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,941
All I can say is        
that the authorities       

355
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,009
Have said no large         
gatherings in Thomasville...   

356
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,711
And that includes       
the movie theater.         

357
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:15,879
I'm sorry.             

358
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,382
Man, the show was       
just getting' good.        

359
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,484
I wonder what's going on.   

360
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:24,054
Maybe the guy hasn't       
paid his rent?         

361
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:25,789
Maybe the place has got rats.  

362
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,291
Hey!               

363
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,861
I bet it's got something to    
do with all that army action.  

364
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:31,995
You think so?          

365
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:34,731
I don't know, but       
something sure is going on.    

366
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:36,400
He's right.            
This ain't normal.         

367
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,968
Maybe Martians are         
about to invade us.        

368
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,736
Whoa.              

369
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:44,775
Maybe we're about to       
be invaded by commies.     

370
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,776
Commies?                        

371
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,210
Commies?

372
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,180
Only one way to find out.   

373
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,150
Man, this is great.        

374
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:55,486
Who's on my team?       

375
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,587
Not me.            

376
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,522
Ok, go on over to that tent,   

377
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:00,424
And Billy and Let       
have to go over there.     

378
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,326
Oh, man, that's way        
on the other side.         

379
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,360
Yeah.              

380
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,496
Ok, we'll take that one.    

381
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,265
What happens if we get caught? 

382
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,068
It's the army. What        
are they gonna do?         

383
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,504
Let's go.           

384
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,707
Besides, we're with the paper. 

385
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,760
Ok.                

386
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,863
All right, now meet us back    
here after you get the flag.   

387
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,097
Ok, go, go, go.        

388
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,360
Sergeant, can I get your    
signature on these papers?     

389
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:46,129
Sure, here you go.         

390
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:45,722
Whitey.            

391
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:47,724
Whitey.            

392
00:23:54,331 --> 00:23:56,232
The kid from           
the football team...       

393
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,734
The Sagersons' kid?        

394
00:23:57,835 --> 00:23:59,670
Yeah, the sick         
one, the older one.        

395
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,238
The one who's not gonna    
make it if he coughs       
again without that mask.    

396
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:03,774
We took it off         
because of the heat...     

397
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:19,349
[ gasping ]            

398
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:58,388
[ talking ]            

399
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:00,757
Now ladies and gentlemen, if I 
may have your attention please.

400
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:06,162
We are at the beginning    
stages of what might become    
a serious polio epidemic.   

401
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:08,264
Is it contagious?       

402
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:10,300
No ma'am, as far as        
we know it is not.         

403
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:11,935
As far as you know?        

404
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:13,536
Ma'am, could you        
please take a seat?        

405
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:19,109
Shouldn't you quarantine    
this camp of yours?        

406
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,276
Or the whole county?       

407
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:22,045
Please ladies, one at a time.  

408
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:24,580
This is not yet a       
quarantine situation.      

409
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:25,849
Why?               

410
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,950
Because nobody,        

411
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:29,052
Not even the best       
doctors in the country,    

412
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:31,354
Know exactly how this      
disease is spread.         

413
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:34,858
So to start a massive quarantine
right now would be futile.     

414
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,259
We'd have to           
quarantine everybody,      

415
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,162
And then, by definition, it    
would no longer be a quarantine.

416
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:43,599
Now, this camp has been    
set up to deal with this    
emergency situation,       

417
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:47,704
And to handle the overflow     
from area hospitals that    
are badly overcrowded.     

418
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:51,708
But Colonel Brandeis, if it's  
not dangerous, then why are    
you keeping it such a secret?  

419
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:54,210
Crowd jeers.           

420
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:57,280
Excuse me, we had a        
well-coordinated plan      

421
00:26:57,381 --> 00:27:00,050
To inform the community about  
exactly what was going on   

422
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,418
Until that plan was        
derailed this afternoon.    

423
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,989
Well I want to know why we     
weren't told about this earlier.

424
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,392
Because these things have to   
be handled carefully, ma'am.   

425
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:12,095
I've seen situations like   
this turn into an unnecessary  

426
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:14,597
Generalized panic, and     
that was our only concern.     

427
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,701
Concern? You don't seem very   
concerned about my family.     

428
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,771
Rose! Sit down and be quiet.   

429
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,106
Well, I will.          

430
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:24,607
But it's going to be       
far away from him.         

431
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,243
His sister's got the polio     
so bad she can't even walk.    

432
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:28,611
It's true!             

433
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,146
I don't want my        
children around it.        

434
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:31,614
We don't know anything     
about this disease.        

435
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,050
How it's spread. Come on!   

436
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:35,719
Whitey says not        
everybody can get it.      

437
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,253
You have to be         
suspecticle to it.         

438
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:39,155
[ laughing ]           

439
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:42,926
Ladies and gentlemen,      
we have informational      
pamphlets for each of you.     

440
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:44,194
If we have             
additional information,    

441
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,529
We will broadcast it over   
your local radio stations.     

442
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,630

00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,811
That's a good idea. Good.   

588
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:44,380
It hardly makes any sense.

It's Christmastime.        

590
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:48,484
You'd think at least one store 
would have an Angel doll.   

591
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,620
We looked at every shop in     
town for that dang thing,   

592
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:51,754
And I don't know        
what else we can do.

595
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:58,961
How about that weird       
little antique store       
way down on hill street?    

596
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:00,830
That's a good idea.        

597

have a sip of that?

catch it or anything.

festival Queen is gonna be in

Wait just minute.       

607

have the Holly festival Queen  
ride in our Christmas parade.

Sure it is.

regular doll and fix it up

"The Littlest Angel."      

640
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:29,612
She loves angels, and I looked 
in the sears catalog and they  
didn't have one either,    

641
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:31,314
So I figured nobody        
had one in town,        

642
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,916
And then at the parade we   
went to Belks, and they    
didn't have one either,    

643
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:37,019

her but not exactly,       

651
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:53,268
