1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,699
It was like... it was like
the end of the world, you know?

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,699
It was like...

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,700
A whole other time.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,699
A major disaster... manmade.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,699
A catastrophe!

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,699
You know what I'm saying?

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,699
I mean, that was
devastation, you know?

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,699
The violence...

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,699
The destruction...

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,699
The terror.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,699
I mean, that was something.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,699
I mean...

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,699
I have never
seen a movie like that.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,699
Crowd: No justice, no peace!

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,699
No justice, no peace!

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,699
No justice, no peace!

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,700
No justice, no peace!

18
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:21,699
No justice, no peace!

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,700
No justice, no peace!

20
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,699
Smith: You know,
the question we're asking

21
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,699
is if anything has changed
because of the riots.

22
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,700
I think
it didn't get any better.

23
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,699
Smith: All right,
now what about the riots?

24
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,699
There was attention
paid to the riots.

25
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,699
Was there enough attention
paid to the riots?

26
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,699
You... you had to pay attention.

27
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,699
No matter where you lived.

28
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,699
Smith: Do you think we need
any more social change?

29
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,699
Man: Do we need change? Yeah.

30
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,699
Oh, of course!

31
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
We only got
little bitty changes.

32
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,699
All: Justice!

33
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,699
Man: The Rodney king incident

34
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,700
had nothing to do with race.

35
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,699
They burned my place out.

36
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,699
It's on!

37
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,699
Revolution is today, money.

38
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,700
Bump all the.

39
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,699
No justice, no peace!

40
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,699
No justice, no peace!

41
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,699
Man: 13,000 square feet

42
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,699
of building, all gone.
Smith: Wow.

43
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,699
Man:
Uh, this country told the world

44
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,699
that it was the great
melting pot, and in my eyes

45
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,700
it's a boiling pot
waiting to erupt.

46
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,699
Smith: Oh, you
can repeat whatever I say.

47
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,699
I will tell you exactly.

48
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,699
Um, let's see, April the 29th...

49
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,699
Was that a Wednesday
or a Thursday?

50
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
- Did you hear what happened to me.
- Did you hear what happened to me

51
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:21,699
because of
the Beverly hills hotel?

52
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,699
I don't know if you know this,
but I do a lot of publicity.

53
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,699
I've been on television,
I do shows on real estate

54
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,699
I do shows on silicone.

55
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,699
I've been on "60 minutes,"
they called me to Washington...

56
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,699
I had 36 surgeries.

57
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,699
I had silicone injections
and 36 surgeries on my face.

58
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,699
And so, um... I'm diversing.

59
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,699
And I was married to gig young
and there was a big scandal

60
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,699
and so they wrote
a book about it

61
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,699
and they called me
to interview me for that.

62
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,699
So... when they call me
to interview me

63
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,699
I never know
what it's going to be for

64
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,699
whether it's going to be real
estate, which I love to do...

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,699
Silicone I do
to help other people.

66
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,699
I was such a victim.

67
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,699
I was paralyzed for a year.

68
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,699
My face was like this,
my eye was like that.

69
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,699
They went in

70
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,699
and removed a grapefruit-sized
silicone from my face

71
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,699
went in and drilled
a hole into my head

72
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,699
to put bone marrow in.

73
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,699
I had 15 surgeries on this eye.

74
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,699
This was an 18-hour surgery.

75
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,699
I almost died.

76
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,699
And so I said,

77
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,699
"well, what can I give back
to the world because of what?"

78
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,699
All I had
was silicone injections

79
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,699
to give me cheekbones,
nothing more.

80
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,699
You'll read the story.

81
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,699
And so I decided that I would do
interviews to keep women and men

82
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,699
from having silicone injected
into their bodies.

83
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,699
It belongs in cars.

84
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,699
And so I'd been on this crusade
in between my work

85
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,699
and so I do a lot of interviews

86
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,699
um, a lot of television...
Pretty good.

87
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,699
But when they called me
to interview me...

88
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,699
When the hotel closed,
it just didn't come out right.

89
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,699
Well, I mean, you know how
they take things out of context.

90
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,699
And so, um...

91
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,699
Maybe I should back...
Back and lead up

92
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,699
and explain why
I was so frightened

93
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700
and why I said what I said.

94
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,699
On the day of the riot

95
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,699
we were sitting here safe
and sound in Beverly hills

96
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,699
because it started slowly
and building.

97
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,699
All of a sudden
we hear people screaming.

98
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,700
Look out the window,
we see smoke!

99
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,699
Smith: I grew up

100
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,699
with all this rich stuff
at home.

101
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,699
And then when I went to school

102
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,699
they started telling me
I was inferior...

103
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,699
Because I was Mexican.

104
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,699
So I knew from an early age

105
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,699
that I had an enemy,
and that enemy

106
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,699
was those nice, white teachers.

107
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,699
And I always wondered,
why did I have this...

108
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,699
This madness in me,
that I understood this.

109
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,699
And it's not an enemy
that I hated

110
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,699
you know,
it's not a hate thing.

111
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,699
But the insanity
that I carry with me,

112
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,699
it started when I took
that beating from the police.

113
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
In 1942, when I was in my teens

114
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,699
I was running around
as a zoot-suiter

115
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,699
and the cops
beat me up bad, you know?

116
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,699
So, uh, well, I don't know.

117
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,699
One of them said something
about my mama or something,

118
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,699
and so I threw a punch
at one of them.

119
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,699
And, uh...

120
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,699
That sealed my doom,
that sealed my doom.

121
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,699
Four cops took me into a room
and locked the door.

122
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,699
They started
kicking me in the head,

123
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,699
and the kicks in the head
were so bad

124
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,699
that they fractured my eardrums.

125
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,699
I was deaf on both ears
worse than I am now.

126
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,699
And from that day...

127
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,699
I had a hate in me.

128
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,699
And even now, it's... it's...
It's... it's... it's awful.

129
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,699
It's... it's...
It's... it's awful.

130
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,699
If I would read in the newspaper

131
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,699
"cop shot down in the street,"

132
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,699
killed, dead, a human being,
a fellow human being!

133
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,699
I say, you know,
you know, you know, "so what?!

134
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,699
"So what?" You know.

135
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,699
"He's probably one of those."

136
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,699
You know?

137
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,699
But hey, I'm not a racist,
I'm not a racist.

138
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,699
I have white friends, though.

139
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,699
But you know,
I don't see them as white.

140
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,699
I don't see them
as white, those...

141
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,699
I had a lot of anxiety
about my boys.

142
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,699
I told them, you know, I...
Just, you know, I...

143
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,699
I said, you know,
"a cop stops you," you know

144
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,699
"throw your hands up,"
you know, "let them...

145
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,699
Let them tell you
what they want," you know?

146
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,699
"Be... be sure and find out
who they are," you know?

147
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,699
"Be sure and tell me
their names."

148
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,700
But they never told me,
they never told me.

149
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,699
Aw...

150
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Stephen was in Stanford.

151
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,699
Oh, came home one weekend
to sing with the band.

152
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,699
Cop pulled him over,
pulled a gun at his head!

153
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,699
How do you think a father feels?

154
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,699
Stuff that happened to me
50 years ago

155
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,699
happening to my boys, man.

156
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,699
You know,
and they just... they...

157
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,699
Aw, they didn't even tell me,
they didn't even tell me

158
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,699
because it would just
make me sick, just make me sick.

159
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,699
And even Rudy, my oldest...

160
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,699
Hey, Margaret! Margaret!

161
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,699
Margaret, tell them, tell them.
Didn't they?

162
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,699
Pull you over that time?

163
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,699
The alhambra cops insulted you
and Rudy that time?

164
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,699
Aw, man.

165
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,699
Crap.

166
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
My enemy.

167
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,699
Man: The Rodney king incident
had nothing to do with race.

168
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,699
But because he was black

169
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,699
and he was being beaten
and you saw.

170
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,699
This filmy tape...
Uh, and it brought back...

171
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,699
In the minds
of a lot of people, uh, the...

172
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,699
The, uh, terrible beatings
of the South,

173
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,699
the history of...
Of lynchings in the South

174
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,699
and suddenly it became a major,
major... uh, racial issue.

175
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,699
Gates must go!

176
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Gates must go!

177
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,699
Woman:
We have watched young men

178
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,699
lying on sidewalks...
Handcuffed.

179
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,699
Oftentimes
we've seen the police

180
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,699
put their foot on their necks.

181
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,699
We've watched men humiliated.

182
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,700
We have felt helpless
to do anything about it.

183
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,699
Who would have ever thought
this was going to happen to us?

184
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,699
We wasn't raised like this.

185
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,699
We wasn't raised
with no black-and-white thing.

186
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,699
We had all kinds of friends.

187
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,699
Black, white, Mexican, Chinese.

188
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
Most of our friends
were Spanish.

189
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,699
I guess a first time
for everything, though.

190
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,699
You wouldn't have known him
to recognize him.

191
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
It was a hell of a look.

192
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,699
That's why he has
a lot to be thankful for.

193
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,699
I told him he had a lot
to be thankful for.

194
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,699
Hell of a lot.

195
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,699
He couldn't even talk,
just, "duh, duh, duh."

196
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,699
I said,.

197
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,699
It took three plastic surgeries

198
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,700
to get Rodney to look
like Rodney again.

199
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,699
But I knew one thing...

200
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,699
My brother's son, sitting up
there in that hospital bed

201
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,699
that I saw looking like hell,
that I saw...

202
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,699
I knew I was going
to do everything

203
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,699
to fight for our justice
and fairness.

204
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,699
Because I didn't care
if it was the president.

205
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,699
Well, you know how, like,

206
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,699
the president of
the United States

207
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,699
he's, like, the top thing.

208
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,699
Anything happened to
the president, everybody'd rave.

209
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,699
Well, that's the way
I felt towards Rodney.

210
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,699
I mean, here's a nobody, right?

211
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,699
But that's the way
I felt towards him.

212
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,699
You understand what I'm saying?

213
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,699
You do?

214
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,699
All right.

215
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,699
Is this America
or South Africa?

216
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,699
Man: I am announcing today that
we have obtained indictments

217
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,699
against four Los Angeles
police officers

218
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,699
for their role in the beating
of Mr. King.

219
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,699
LAPD officer Laurence Powell...

220
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,699
Timothy wind...

221
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,699
Theodore briseno...

222
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,699
And sergeant Stacey koon

223
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,699
have been indicted for assault
with a deadly weapon

224
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,340
- and for excessive use of force under color of authority.
- And for excessive use of force under color of authority.

225
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Powell holds the Baton
like this.

226
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,699
That is not a good...

227
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
The proper way to hold the Baton
is like this.

228
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,699
Now, one of the things
that everybody is talking about

229
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,699
is why did it take
56 Baton blows?

230
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,699
And it all comes down to, Powell
had no strength and no power

231
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,699
in his Baton strikes

232
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,699
because he was
weak and inefficient

233
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,699
with the Baton training.

234
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,699
Oh, yeah, uh, I know
what I was going to do.

235
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,699
Prior to this...
We lost the choke hold...

236
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,699
The upper body control hold...
In 1982.

237
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,699
If we still had the choke hold

238
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,699
this whole videotape
would have never been on;

239
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,699
This whole incident would
have lasted about 15 seconds.

240
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,699
And the reason we lost
the upper body control hold...

241
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,699
Because in a period of about...

242
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,699
We had something
like 17 or 20 deaths

243
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,699
in a period of about
1975, '76, to 1982

244
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,699
and it was associated with...

245
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,699
It was being used on blacks,
and blacks were dying.

246
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,699
And a number of, uh... some...
The so-called community leaders

247
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,699
special-interest-group
community leaders

248
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,699
came forward and complained

249
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,699
and created the hysteria about
the upper body control hold,

250
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,699
that it was an inhumane
use-of-force treatment.

251
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,699
And Gilbert Lindsay,
who was a really neat man

252
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,699
saw a demonstration
on the Baton,

253
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,699
and he said, "you're not going
to beat my people

254
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,699
with that Baton."

255
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,699
He said, "I'd rather
you use a choke hold."

256
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,699
But a couple
of other people said

257
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,699
you could beat them
into submission

258
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,699
you could break their bones

259
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,699
but you're not choking
them anymore.

260
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,699
And so the political framework
was laid

261
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,700
for the elimination
of the upper body control hold.

262
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,699
Reporter: March 16, 1991,

263
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,699
a young black woman
is shot to death

264
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,699
by the Korean owner
of a grocery store

265
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,699
for allegedly stealing
a bottle of orange juice.

266
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,699
Reporter: Harlins' family was asked
if this will lead to violence.

267
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,699
I damn sure hope so

268
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,699
that there will be all the hell
in the black community

269
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,699
and will stand up and see this
insanity for exactly what it is.

270
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,699
Reporter:
Harlins' death occurred

271
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,699
days after
the Rodney king beating

272
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,699
and added to the racial tensions

273
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,699
in the black community.

274
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,699
Woman: I have a favorite saying

275
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,699
that probably is not going
to come off too well, either,

276
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,699
but I'm just going to be honest.

277
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,699
I feel like the Koreans
were like roaches.

278
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,699
They were burnt out
from long beach to Pasadena.

279
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,699
All their businesses
were targeted.

280
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
Latasha's name was written
on many of them.

281
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
- Smith: Barbara, could you come in here.
- Smith: Barbara, could you come in here

282
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:23,699
for a minute, please?

283
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,699
Latasha hits Mrs. Du
in the face

284
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,699
four times, very viciously.

285
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,699
She knocks her down twice.

286
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,699
I mean, this fight
was no contest.

287
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,699
I'll take the girl.

288
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,699
I'll take the girl,
this little girl.

289
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,699
Didn't you think the girl
was much smaller?

290
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,699
Misleading.

291
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,699
Miss five-six, 152 pounds,

292
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,699
and she beats the hell
out of this lady.

293
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,699
Oh, Barbara, let's take
this back from the beginning

294
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,699
because it goes so fast...

295
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,699
52 seconds and a 15-year-old
girl is dead.

296
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,699
And it's tragic,
it is so tragic.

297
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,699
The gun had a hair trigger.

298
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,699
They had been robbed before.

299
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,699
And there was racism involved.

300
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,699
I mean, the Koreans
are like I am.

301
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,699
I'm a racist.

302
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,699
How can I live in America
and not be a racist?

303
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,699
I pull for the black coach;

304
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,699
I pull for the team
with the black quarterback.

305
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,699
We all have those feelings.
Now watch this.

306
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,699
It's a nine-year-old boy...

307
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,699
A nine-year-old little boy
with his 12-year-old sister

308
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,699
had to watch this killing.

309
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,699
Isn't that sad?

310
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,699
9:00 Saturday morning,
there's the young lady coming up

311
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,699
almost like Hollywood
in a black sweater on the left.

312
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,699
Now watch this very carefully.

313
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,699
This is an enhanced tape.

314
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,699
It's been played
over and over again.

315
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,699
It's a surveillance tape,
it's very poor quality

316
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,699
but it would have
cost us $300,000

317
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,699
to get anything better than
this, so watch this, watch this.

318
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,699
Look at there,
watch very carefully.

319
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,699
Watch, look at there,
look at there.

320
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,699
Doesn't she have
a strong right hand?

321
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,699
Whoom, look at there!

322
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,699
Like a billiard ball
in the pocket!

323
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,699
Whoom, look at there
in the face!

324
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,699
Whoom, she knocks her down

325
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,699
and muhammad Ali
couldn't do better.

326
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,699
Whoom! She hits Mrs. Du
in the face.

327
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,699
The lady throws the chair.

328
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,699
Mrs. Du is reaching
under the counter.

329
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,699
She's trying to get the gun,

330
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,699
trying to get
the gun out of the holster,

331
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,699
and latasha comes back to the
counter with the orange juice.

332
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,699
She puts the orange juice back.

333
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,699
And the gun! She sees the gun.

334
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,699
She makes one step!

335
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,699
Boom! Blood, brains, right
under the cash register!

336
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,699
Now, when I first heard
about this case

337
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,699
they had the girl walking
out of the front door

338
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,699
shot in the back,
walking down the street.

339
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,699
But it didn't happen that way.

340
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,699
'Cause if you look at her head;

341
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,699
You look at the girl's head

342
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,699
in relationship to the cash
register right under there

343
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,699
36 feet from the front door.

344
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,699
That's enough, Barbara,
thank you very much.

345
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,699
Isn't that sad?
Isn't human life cheap?

346
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Let's play it again.

347
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,699
We found it very unusual

348
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,699
that Charles Lloyd

349
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,699
the top black attorney in this
city, would take this case...

350
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,699
A millionaire.

351
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,699
But for Charles Lloyd
to defend a Korean woman

352
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,700
in the death of a black child...

353
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,699
Well, I guess he
just sold his card.

354
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,699
He's no longer a card-carrying
member of our community

355
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,699
or our... nation as a people
any longer.

356
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,699
He's a sellout.

357
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,699
I guess that's just
the best way we could put it.

358
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,699
Because we all know as we sit
here today as black people

359
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,699
if either of us had killed
a Korean child...

360
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,699
Shot them in the back
of the head...

361
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
And it was recorded
on videotape

362
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,699
and it was recorded
on videotape

363
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,699
we would not be sitting
here talking today.

364
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,699
Soon ja du took the gun

365
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,699
because, uh, so nervous.

366
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,699
Maybe I understand
that situation

367
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,699
because I have a...

368
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,699
A similar
situation in my store.

369
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,699
Five, six youngster come in,
come in at one time

370
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,699
usually a black... black guys,
maybe 15, 17 years old.

371
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,699
One guy's talking with me,
one guy's asking the price

372
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,699
one guy's asking
which one is where.

373
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,699
Then that makes me look
another place.

374
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,699
Then they gonna try
steal something.

375
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,699
They have a big backpack
full of soda, whatever.

376
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,699
After that I...
I really hate this country.

377
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,699
I really hate!

378
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,699
We are not like
customer and owner,

379
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,699
but just like enemy.

380
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,699
Justice denied latasha harlins

381
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,699
is justice denied
every American citizen.

382
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:27,699
And the sentencing of soon ja du
was a $500 fine...

383
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,699
Restitution
to the funeral expenses.

384
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,699
You can't bury a dog
in Los Angeles for $500.

385
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,699
Latasha's funeral cost $7,000.

386
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,699
So $500 fine...

387
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,699
We think it's more to the tune
of $1 billion

388
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,699
it cost this city
April twenty the ninth,

389
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,699
because no matter
what people say

390
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,699
the injustice done
to Rodney king...

391
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,699
It just coincides,
as there's a parallel

392
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,700
between Rodney and latasha.

393
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,699
Smith:
We lived in apartment a-6,

394
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,699
which is right next door to a-8

395
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,699
which is where
George holliday lived.

396
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,699
And the next thing we knew
there were ten or 12 officers

397
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,699
making a circle
around Rodney king...

398
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,699
And they started to hit him.

399
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,699
And they were kicking him

400
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,699
and they were hitting him
with sticks.

401
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,699
And we were just, like,
"oh, my goodness!"

402
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,699
I thought he was really
in danger out there

403
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,699
it was such
an oppressive atmosphere.

404
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,699
I knew it was wrong.

405
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,699
Whatever he had done,

406
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,699
I just knew in my heart,
this is wrong, you know.

407
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,699
I mean, they can't do that.

408
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,699
And even my husband
was petrified.

409
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,699
He said, "let's go inside."

410
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,699
He was trying to get me
to come away from the scene.

411
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,699
But I said no.

412
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,699
I said, "we have to watch this,
because this is wrong."

413
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,699
And my husband was petrified

414
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,699
because he comes from a country
where this is prevalent;

415
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,699
Police abuse is prevalent
in Mexico.

416
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,699
So we stayed
and we watched the whole thing.

417
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,699
And I was kind of upset
at the outcome

418
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,699
because I had a lot to say.

419
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,700
I was scheduled to testify
and I was just really upset.

420
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:22,699
I was scheduled to testify
and I was just really upset.

421
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,699
And I said to the prosecutor

422
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,699
I said, "well, when
do you want me to come?"

423
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,699
Because the date said
such-and-such a time

424
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,699
and that was, um...

425
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,699
And he said, "well, I'll
call you and give you a time

426
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,699
so you don't have
to wait around."

427
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,699
Now, the time came
and the time went

428
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,699
and so I started to call him

429
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,699
and I said, "well, are you
going to call me or not?"

430
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,699
And he said, "well, I can't
really talk to you.

431
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,699
I don't think we're
going to be using you

432
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,699
because what you say contradicts
what the highway patrol said."

433
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,699
And I remember I was so upset.

434
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,699
I wrote him a letter
and I faxed it

435
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,699
and I said, "these officers
are going to be acquitted."

436
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,699
I said, "if you do not
put one resident..."

437
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,699
Terry white did not put one
resident, not one resident

438
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,699
except for George holliday.

439
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,699
I said, "if you do not put one
resident to say what they saw,

440
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,699
those officers are going
to be acquitted."

441
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,699
I said, "let the jury
hear the facts.

442
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Let them hear what
other people have to say."

443
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,699
But I think that the prosecution
was just dead set

444
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,699
that the video
was going to tell all.

445
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,699
But that video doesn't show

446
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,699
where those officers
went and assaulted Rodney king

447
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,699
in the beginning...
Do you see that?

448
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,699
And I remember I was so upset,
I said to my co-worker,

449
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,699
I said, "oh, my goodness,
I just had this terrible dream

450
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,699
that the officers
were acquitted."

451
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,699
And she said

452
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,699
"oh, you know, they're
not going to be acquitted.

453
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,699
You shouldn't think like that."

454
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,699
I said, "I wasn't thinking,
it was a dream."

455
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,699
Well, I just saw the men
in the courtroom

456
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,699
and I just felt in my heart
something's happening.

457
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,699
Because dreams are made
of this indelible substance.

458
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,699
And my co-worker said,

459
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,699
"you know, you shouldn't
think like that."

460
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,699
I said, "I wasn't thinking.

461
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,700
It was a dream, and that's all."

462
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,699
Guilty! Guilty!
We saw it, we know it!

463
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,699
Reporter: It took a year,
but the case that caused

464
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,699
a furor over police brutality

465
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,699
has finally come to trial.

466
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,699
Reporter: Because of pretrial
publicity and political fallout

467
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,699
the trial was moved
from Los Angeles

468
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,699
to nearby ventura county.

469
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,699
It took a month to find...

470
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,699
Reporter:
The jury is essentially

471
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,699
white and middle-aged.

472
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,699
There are seven men
and five women.

473
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,699
None of the jurors are black.

474
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,699
Smith:
I knew there would be people

475
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,699
unhappy with the verdict,

476
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:02,699
but I didn't expect anything
near what happened.

477
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,699
They were taking us
out of the courtroom

478
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,699
and there were a lot
of obnoxious reporters around

479
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,700
and the police were trying to...

480
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Get us into the buses
and hide our faces,

481
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:24,699
get us into the buses
and hide our faces,

482
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:32,700
and one of the obnoxious
reporters...

483
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,699
Said, "why are you hiding
your heads in shame?

484
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,699
Do you know that people
are dying...

485
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,699
And buildings are burning
in South Los Angeles

486
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,699
because of you?"

487
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,699
And to see on television
all the political leaders...

488
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:07,699
Mayor Bradley and president bush
condemning our verdict...

489
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,699
And...

490
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,699
Some of the jurors, we kind of
tossed it around that...

491
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,699
Was this some sort of a setup?

492
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,699
We felt like we were pawns
of the system...

493
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,699
And that we were
being tossed aside.

494
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,699
And even the judge...

495
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,699
When he was
reading the verdict,

496
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,699
some of the jurors said
there was a look of disdain

497
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,699
on his face.

498
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
And...

499
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,699
He had the power and the right
to withhold our names

500
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,699
for a period of time,
but he didn't do that.

501
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,699
He just released them
right away.

502
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,699
And our names and our addresses
were published in newspapers...

503
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,699
All across the country.

504
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,700
The New York times published
the value of our homes.

505
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,700
We received
threatening letters and...

506
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,699
Phone calls.

507
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,699
But worse than the letters...

508
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,699
Worse than the threats...

509
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,699
All of the jurors
got letters from the kkk

510
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,699
saying, "we support you.

511
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,699
If you need our help...

512
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,699
If you would like to join
our organization,

513
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,700
we would be happy
to welcome you into...

514
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,200
Into the fold."

515
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,699
Into the fold."

516
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,699
Reporter: It was a clean sweep
for the defendants...

517
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,699
Not guilty of assault.

518
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,699
Reporter:
The videotape wasn't enough

519
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,699
to convince a mostly white jury
the officers were guilty.

520
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,699
Within hours there was madness
in the streets.

521
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,699
Man: I took a route home that...
That kept me off the freeways

522
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,699
I went the back roads
through the orange orchards.

523
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,699
Um, about halfway through that
trip I turned on the radio

524
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,699
and listened to the...
I was listening, you know...

525
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,699
The live coverage from
the helicopter reporter

526
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,699
at Florence and normandie

527
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,699
and I was, you know...
I'm just a Kansas boy.

528
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,699
I, you know, it's just like,
"oh, my God, what is going on?"

529
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,699
And then I went home

530
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,699
and I didn't sleep for probably

531
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,699
three, three and a half days.
I ruptured my bowels.

532
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,699
I had diarrhea so bad

533
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,699
I had to have emergency surgery
at 8:30 one night.

534
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,699
Watching this,
it was just the work

535
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,699
of sinister,
diabolical predators.

536
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,699
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

537
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,699
No justice, no peace!

538
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,700
No justice, no peace!

539
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,699
Man: Tip it over!

540
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,699
Smith: What took place here...

541
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,699
Southern California was rocked.

542
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,699
The whole infrastructure,

543
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,699
the foundation, was cracked.

544
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,699
The seams of that fine fabric

545
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,699
that Los Angeles image
that we have

546
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,699
that California, that sunshine,
we showed the insides

547
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,699
you know, the core,
that which is normally bypassed

548
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,699
or overlooked, was shown;
It came forward,

549
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,699
it let it be known.

550
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,699
Smith: I went downstairs

551
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,699
with a couple of, uh,
copy messengers, uh...

552
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,699
I grabbed a pair of scissors,
uh, uh...

553
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,699
A guy looked, uh,
like he was coming in.

554
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,699
Uh, I shouted at him
with the scissors

555
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,699
and a couple of, uh, copy, uh,
copy messengers with me.

556
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,699
Uh, my wife is
an emergency room doctor

557
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,699
and she said, because she feels

558
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,699
that she's considerably more
in tune with the kinds of guys

559
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,699
who go around with scissors,
uh, and other weapons

560
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,699
"why don't you just go back
upstairs and work with the copy

561
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,700
- because, uh, you might not do very well with the crowd.
- Because, uh, you might not do very well with the crowd

562
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:21,699
you seem to want
to be running with."

563
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,699
But I wasn't about to be stopped

564
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,699
because, uh...
There was a clear sense

565
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:35,700
that clearly, big and dreadful
things, uh, were happening.

566
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,699
Smith: I think this thing about

567
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,699
the Koreans and the blacks,
you know,

568
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,699
that wasn't altogether true,
you know?

569
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,699
And the thing
that happened in, to...

570
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,699
To the... to the Korean stores,
in the black neighborhood

571
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,699
that was just due to lack of,
uh, lack of, uh

572
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,700
lack of, uh, lack of, uh...

573
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,699
Smith:
My husband came to United States

574
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,699
28 years ago

575
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,699
and he was very high educated
and very nice to all the people.

576
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,699
And he started business,
seven, ten, 20 years ago

577
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,699
and he work so hard,
he work very hard.

578
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,699
And he also donate a lot
of money to the Compton area.

579
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,699
And the city council,
they knows him,

580
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,699
and the police, they knows him.

581
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,699
Then why he has to get shot,
you know?

582
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,700
I don't know why.

583
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,699
So really angry... you know?

584
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,699
And this thing, they talk about
the blacks and the Koreans.

585
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,699
Well, we wasn't lootin'
over there in Korea town...

586
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,699
Those wasn't blacks...

587
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,699
Those wasn't blacks lootin'
over there, lootin' over there.

588
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Those was Mexicans lootin'
over there, those wasn't blacks.

589
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,699
Smith: Uh, as soon as I heard

590
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,699
about the, uh... the verdict,

591
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,699
uh, which wasn't
until about 5:30...

592
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,699
Uh, I immediately headed
downtown to Parker center.

593
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Uh, I drove into the garage.

594
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,699
There's Daryl gates,

595
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,699
getting into his car.

596
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,699
I said, "where you Goin'?"

597
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,699
"I got something I gotta do."

598
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,699
That's the only answer I got.

599
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,699
Now, as you may have heard,

600
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,699
he was on his way
to a fundraiser

601
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,699
right up there in brentwood.

602
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,699
First of all,

603
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,699
I don't think it was
a fundraiser, uh...

604
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,699
I don't think it was
a fundraiser at all.

605
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,699
I think it was
a group of people,

606
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,200
real strong supporters of mine,

607
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:15,699
real strong supporters of mine,

608
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,699
uh, and they begged me
to be there.

609
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,699
And I didn't want to go.

610
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,699
I don't like those things.

611
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,699
I don't like them at all, but...

612
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,699
Why? Why he has to be shot?

613
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,699
He was very high educated!

614
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,699
Gates: And, uh,
so I made a commitment

615
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,699
and I'm the kind of person who
likes to keep a commitment.

616
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,699
Uh, and when I thought that
I had some, uh, serious problems

617
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,699
uh, my driver said, you know,

618
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,699
"we're almost there, chief,
we're almost there."

619
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,699
Uh, and my intent
was to drop in

620
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,700
say, "hey, I think we got a, uh,
riot blossoming, I can't stay."

621
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,699
Park: He also donate a lot of
money to the Compton area,

622
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,699
and the Compton police,
they knows him,

623
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,699
and the city council,
they knows him.

624
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,699
Gates: To drop in, say,

625
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,699
"hey, I think we got
a riot blossoming.

626
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,699
I can't stay."

627
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,699
And that's basically
what I did.

628
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,699
But it's awful hard
to get away.

629
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,699
I kept walking towards the door,
walking towards the door.

630
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,699
Uh, people want to, uh,
take your picture,

631
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,699
uh, shake your hand,

632
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,699
and, uh...

633
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,699
It took longer than I thought.

634
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,699
Sheinbaum: So, after I got done
with that...

635
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,699
Trying to figure out what in
the hell

636
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,699
was going on with him...
I mean, he's the chief!

637
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,700
And this whole thing
very well may be falling apart!

638
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,699
Man: You got these
young brothers out there

639
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,699
thinking that
they're getting something

640
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,699
that they're going
to make a living with

641
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,699
and getting something
they can buy a car.

642
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,699
Like the white people have cars,
why can't I have a car?

643
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,699
They're getting something so
they can... get a piece of gold.

644
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,699
White people have gold,
why can't I have gold?

645
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,699
They're getting something
to get a house.

646
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,699
The white people have a house,
why can't I have a house?

647
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,699
And they actually think

648
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,699
that is something that's
giving resources to them

649
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,699
but they're killing themselves

650
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,699
just like the wolf
who's licking the blade

651
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,699
and they're slowing dying
without knowing it.

652
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,699
That's what's happening to
the community, you with me?

653
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,699
Smith:
Many people were just there

654
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,699
because other people were there.

655
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,699
A lot of people
didn't really know why.

656
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,699
I'm pretty sure most
of the hispanic people

657
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,699
didn't even know why

658
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,699
because, basically,
the Rodney king

659
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,699
basically came out

660
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,699
on channel two, four, five,
seven, nine, 11 and 13.

661
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,699
Basically
no hispanic news people

662
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,699
really even came out with it,
not until after the incidents

663
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,699
not until
after the riots started.

664
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,699
So... basically most
of the hispanic people

665
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,699
didn't even know why.

666
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,699
That's.

667
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,699
You know, people were
just as pissed off

668
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,699
people were just as on-edge
in the Latino community

669
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,699
as they were in South central.

670
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,699
And of course South central
is half Latino...

671
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,699
But nobody talks
about that, right?

672
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,699
I mean, you know, there's
just as much police abuse

673
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,699
in the Latino community.

674
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,699
I mean, you see, Anna...

675
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,699
You see police stopping people

676
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,699
for jaywalking all the time,
I mean, all the time.

677
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,699
This does not happen
in Beverly hills.

678
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,699
This does not happen
in the valley.

679
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,700
- Even though you are doing all the right things...
- Even though you are doing all the right things...

680
00:37:12,701 --> 00:37:13,699
I mean, it's... you're...

681
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,699
You're, you're... there's still
something wrong with you.

682
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,699
You know, maybe it's because
you speak Spanish,

683
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,699
maybe it's because
you have brown skin,

684
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,699
maybe it's because
you come from Mexico,

685
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,699
but, you know what?

686
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,100
You're just not walking right,
you're just not walking right.

687
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,699
Smith: We had an
insurrection in this city before

688
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,699
and if I remember correctly, it
was sparked by police brutality.

689
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,699
We had
the kerner commission report

690
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,699
and as I stand here today,
in 1992

691
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,699
I see that what that report
cited still exists today.

692
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,699
Mr. President,

693
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,699
we want our black men back on
America's agenda.

694
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,699
They've been dropped off of
everybody's statistics and data.

695
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,699
They're not in school,
they're not employed,

696
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,699
they don't live anywhere...

697
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,699
They go from grandmama
to mamma to girlfriend.

698
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,699
And, Mr. President,
not everybody in the street

699
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,699
is a thug or a hood!

700
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,699
Not everybody is a criminal.

701
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,699
And if they are, Mr. President,

702
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,699
then what about your
violations?

703
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,699
Oh, yes, I'm angry...
We are angry.

704
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,699
The fact of the matter is,
whether we like it or not,

705
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,700
riot was the voice
of the unheard.

706
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,699
Smith: My reaction?

707
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,699
Surely they're not
coming up here.

708
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,699
This Ridge is armed, secure.

709
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,699
I was raised
in a hunting culture.

710
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,699
So was my neighbor,
so was my son.

711
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,699
I got calls
from my liberal friends...

712
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,699
"Chuck, could you lend me a, uh,
a shotgun?"

713
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:28,699
And I said, "oh, yeah, you have
to wait two weeks to buy one."

714
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,699
But I did lend them
some protection.

715
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,699
But my friend John milius,
the screenwriter,

716
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,699
said, "nope,
they're all being used."

717
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,699
Smith: I just thinking about,

718
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,699
everybody pumped up,
talking about

719
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,699
the Koreans and the blacks,
the blacks and the Koreans

720
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,699
the blacks... the blacks
and the Koreans

721
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,699
the blacks and the Koreans...

722
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,699
I didn't see it!
I didn't see it!

723
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,699
Now, pep boys,
now see, that right there

724
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,699
see, I didn't like the idea
of them hittin' pep boys...

725
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,699
No, I didn't, I didn't,
I didn't like that.

726
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,699
Not because I think...

727
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,699
Well, the only reason I can
think they hit pep boys

728
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,699
is just that pep boys
was just too damn hot.

729
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,699
You know, people say, "well,
you know, let me get in there

730
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,700
- get me some of that... whatever the hell they got in there."
- Get me some of that... whatever the hell they got in there."

731
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:15,699
But, uh, now I didn't
loot this time, no, no I didn't.

732
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,699
Now, girl, get it out.
Get it out!

733
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,699
No, I'm not ki... get that out!

734
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,699
I didn't loot,
no, I didn't! I didn't!

735
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,699
I did in 1965, but this time

736
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,699
it was just much more
than that for me.

737
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,699
But I was praising the ones
that did it, though.

738
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,699
I was, like, "yeah," you know

739
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,699
"you need to go ahead
and burn that sucker down."

740
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,699
Crowd: Guilty! Guilty!

741
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,699
We saw it, we know it.

742
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,699
Guilty! Guilty!

743
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,699
Smith: And he worked so hard...

744
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,700
He work very hard...

745
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,699
Then why he has to be shot?
You know?

746
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,699
I don't know why.

747
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,699
So, really angry, you know?

748
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,699
I cried...

749
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,699
Most of my life...

750
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,699
This is the time, I cried...

751
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,699
A lot.

752
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:13,699
We got a call
from our stringer in beirut

753
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,699
wondering if we were all right.

754
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,699
You know you've got
some trouble in your city

755
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,699
if your stringer from beirut
calls to say,

756
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,700
"are you all right?"

757
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,699
Smith: Well, there was the fuse

758
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,699
that was still burning

759
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,699
and the uneasiness
that was growing

760
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,699
but it was basically
business as usual...

761
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,699
You know,
"such-and-so on line one,"

762
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,699
"such-and-so on line two";

763
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,699
"Traffic: Wilshire,
Santa Monica," like that.

764
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,699
Bunch of us had to go to lunch
at the grill in Beverly hills.

765
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,699
You know, again, you know,
major showbusiness, you know,

766
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,699
kind of sort of dead-center
business restaurant...

767
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,699
Kind of loud but genteel.

768
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,699
And there was
an incipient panic.

769
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,699
The tension in the restaurant
was palpable, it was tangible.

770
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,699
You could cut it with a knife.

771
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,699
All everybody was talking of:
"Did you hear, did you hear?"

772
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,699
You know, little bits
of conversation

773
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,699
little bits of information.

774
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,699
And we were basically working
ourselves up into a frenzy,

775
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,699
which had to do with guilt,
you know, just generic guilt.

776
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,699
And...

777
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,699
Uh, we're driving back
from the restaurant to here.

778
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,699
You know, it's about
a ten-minute drive.

779
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,699
People talking about the need to
buy guns to protect themselves.

780
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,699
So I mean, you know,
we've gone from there to there.

781
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,699
And I don't mean to tell you

782
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,699
that anything happened
in the restaurant

783
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,699
you know, like somebody screamed
at somebody or something.

784
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,699
No, nothing, just,
you know, Caesar salad...

785
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,699
You know, the whole bit
went like that.

786
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,699
And, uh, so, uh,

787
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,699
we're coming from
the underground garage into here

788
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,699
and we see people
running around.

789
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,699
I mean, people walk fast
in this business

790
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,699
but now they're, like, running.

791
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,699
And so we looked at each other
and we said,

792
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,699
"we got to close the office!"

793
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,699
Shut down.

794
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,699
I mean, so we've gone from,
"I'm a little nervous"

795
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,700
- to, "we got to close the office."
- To, "we got to close the office."

796
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:11,699
This is a business.
We don't shut down.

797
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,699
Memo goes out,
"office closed for the day."

798
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,699
Oh, then I remember...

799
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,699
Somebody said,

800
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,699
"did you hear they're burning
down the Beverly center?"

801
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,699
Yeah, by the way, "they."

802
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,699
You know, I mean, you know,
there's no who.

803
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,699
No, no, no...

804
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,699
It's just, you know, uh, the,
uh, they, uh, you know...

805
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,699
"Did you hear?

806
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,699
They're burning down
the Beverly center."

807
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,699
What do you mean who?
There is no who.

808
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,699
It's irrelevant.
Just, you know... just "they."

809
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,699
You know, somebody,
it's not us.

810
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,699
So, uh, you know, when I really
started to worry about,

811
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,699
you know, the... the...
You know,

812
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,699
safety of my, you know,
my family,

813
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,699
I mean, you know, because
the panic was so high...

814
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,699
You know, "where is the nanny?
Where is the kids?"

815
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,699
I actually started
to think, you know,

816
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,699
"do I, uh, you know,
do I deserve this?"

817
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,699
And, I mean, you know,
not me personally, no...

818
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,699
Me generically.

819
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,699
Maybe so, even though,

820
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,699
I mean what's provoked it
was the spark, you know,

821
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,699
which was the verdict,
which was absurd.

822
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,699
But... but... but that was
just the spark.

823
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,699
I mean, this was something
that was set, uh, years before

824
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:18,699
and, uh, you know,
I mean maybe...

825
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,699
Not maybe, you know,
the system plays unequally

826
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,699
and the people
who were the "they"

827
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,699
who were burning
down the Beverly center

828
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,699
had been victims of the set...
Uh, victims of the system,

829
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,699
whether well-intentioned or not.

830
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,699
And so I basically began
to absorb a little guilt,

831
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,699
and say, uh, you know,
"I deserve it, I deserve it."

832
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,699
And, yeah, I don't mean to say

833
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,699
I deserve to have
my house burned down.

834
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,699
But the "us" did, you know,
not in, you know, I...

835
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,699
I mean, I like to think
not intentionally

836
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,699
but, uh, you know, maybe so.

837
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,699
It's just, uh...

838
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,699
It was just so awful out there

839
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,699
to see all of the...
The... the destruction;

840
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,699
So heartbreaking to see
all of those, you know...

841
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,699
The devastation

842
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,699
and the, uh, people burning
down their own neighborhoods.

843
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,699
I mean, you know, burning down
our neighborhoods I could see

844
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,699
but... but they burnt
down their own.

845
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,700
That... that was
more dramatic to me.

846
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,699
So the second day, I had a date

847
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,699
and my date lived in the valley

848
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,699
which is about 20 minutes away.

849
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,699
And they said,
"don't drive freeways."

850
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,699
And I was just
three weeks separated

851
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,699
and I didn't want to be alone.

852
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,699
So I called him up and I said,

853
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,699
"well, are you going
to see me tonight

854
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,699
because I don't
want to be alone?"

855
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,699
He says, "yeah."

856
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,699
So he came to pick me up

857
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,699
and I said, "oh, my God,
where are we going to go?

858
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,699
"We can't eat anywhere.

859
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,699
Everything is closed."

860
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,200
And then I said, "wait a minute.

861
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:07,699
And then I said, "wait a minute.

862
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,699
A hotel wouldn't be closed.

863
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,699
They're going
to be serving food."

864
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,699
I said, "let's go see if we can
go to the Beverly hills hotel."

865
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,699
And so we did.

866
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,699
Much to my shock,

867
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,699
the whole town,
picture-business people

868
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,699
everybody was there.

869
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,699
And so for the two or three days
of heavy rioting

870
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,699
we just all went
to the Beverly hills hotel.

871
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,699
So when they called me
to interview me

872
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,699
when the hotel closed,

873
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,699
I said, "I went there
36 years for lunch."

874
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,699
I said,
"I wrote my book there."

875
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,699
When my book starts out

876
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,699
I was driving into
the Beverly hills hotel.

877
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,699
And I talked

878
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,699
about how we were all at
the polo lounge at the hotel

879
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,699
when... during the riots...

880
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,699
Because it was foremost
on my mind.

881
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,699
Some man wrote me a letter.

882
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:57,699
"To Mrs. Young:

883
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,699
I saw your interview
on television.

884
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,699
As far as I'm concerned,

885
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,699
you are an.

886
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,699
You are a dumb bimbo.

887
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,699
How stupid can you be?

888
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,699
You are talking about having
fun at the Beverly hills hotel

889
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,699
during the riot...
You are an embarrassment."

890
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,699
And I'm sitting here
reading this letter

891
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,699
and I'm thinking, "oh, my God,
if only he'd left his number

892
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,699
so I could call him up
and explain to him

893
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,699
no way in the world

894
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,699
did I mean to be flippant on
television about the riots."

895
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,699
It's just that, there we were
at the Beverly hills hotel.

896
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,699
I mean, it was like,
how far down can you go?

897
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,699
At a certain point
you just have to say

898
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,699
"let me put this
out of my mind and go on."

899
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,699
That was the mood
at the Beverly hills hotel:

900
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,699
Safety in numbers.

901
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,699
Nobody can hurt us
at the Beverly hills hotel.

902
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,699
It's like a fortress.

903
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,699
And we were just like

904
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,699
"here we are,
and we're still alive,

905
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,700
and we hope that people will
be alive when we come out."

906
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,699
Smith: It was rage, black rage.

907
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,699
The blacks were upset,
they were extremely upset.

908
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,699
And since I've been back home

909
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,740
I see all the vacant lots.

910
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,699
No wonder they
were so upset, right?!

911
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,699
You've got to realize
that the verdicts...

912
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,699
The not-guilty verdicts...

913
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,699
Was heavy on everybody's mind.

914
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,699
And I was following the trial

915
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,699
because I wanted to see
if justice worked.

916
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,699
And on that particular day,
justice did not work.

917
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,699
Yes, I was upset,
I was highly upset.

918
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,699
That could have been me out
there getting my ass whooped.

919
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,700
- And those four officers could have walked away.
- And those four officers could have walked away

920
00:49:05,703 --> 00:49:07,699
after whoopin' my ass like that?

921
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,699
I'm afraid not!

922
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,699
I'm afraid not!

923
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,699
Ha!

924
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,699
I'm afraid not!

925
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,699
Whoo!

926
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,699
Whoo!

927
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,699
Whoa! Whoo!

928
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,699
I'm afraid not!

929
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,699
George h.W. Bush: We must
respect the process of law

930
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,700
whether or not we agree
with the outcome.

931
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,699
Smith: Well, it was like

932
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,699
a carnival out there.

933
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,699
And I said to my cousin frances

934
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,699
I said, "frances, you see this?"

935
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,699
She say,
"girl, it's getting worse."

936
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,699
And so I said, "well, let...

937
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,699
You know, let me
get my butt upstairs

938
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,699
before something happen."

939
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,699
And it seemed like
as soon as I said that,

940
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,699
I heard, like,
a bottle being thrown.

941
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,699
And I felt, like,
a tingling sensation

942
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,699
and it was itching
and it was moist.

943
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,699
And I did it like this

944
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,699
and I looked down
and I saw blood.

945
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,699
And I said,
"frances, I'm bleeding!"

946
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,699
And so we went up to her house.

947
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,699
She say, "lift up your gown
and let me see."

948
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,699
She say,
"elvira, it's a bullet!"

949
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,699
I say, "what?"

950
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,699
I say,
"I didn't heard nothing."

951
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,699
She say, "well, yeah,
but it's a bullet."

952
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,699
And she say,
"you go lay down there.

953
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,699
Let me call
St. Francis hospital,

954
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,699
tell them send an ambulance,
you been shot."

955
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,699
And the neighbor
came over and said,

956
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,699
"you know, why... you know,
why they have to shot you?

957
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,699
You don't mess
with none of them people.

958
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,699
Why they have to shot you?"

959
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,699
You know, matter of fact,
after some people say to me

960
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,699
"elvira, what you doing in it?"

961
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,699
I said, "I wasn't in it."

962
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,699
I said, "I was coming
to my house...

963
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,699
Coming... to... my... house.

964
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,699
It happened right here.

965
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,699
It was kind of like a drive-by."

966
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,699
So, you know, frances say,
"well, the, uh...

967
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,699
The ambulance... they gon'
to take 15, 20 minutes."

968
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,699
I say, you know, I say,
"frances, I cannot wait that.

969
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,699
I'm going."

970
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,699
So I went upstairs
and I said to my oldest son

971
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,699
I say, "amant,
take care your brothers."

972
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,699
And he was standing
up there crying.

973
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,699
By then they was all
standing up there crying.

974
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,699
And what I did for them
not to see the blood

975
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,699
I covered it up with my gown

976
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,699
and then I didn't cry
so I wouldn't be nervous.

977
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,699
And so I went downstairs
and I was getting in the car.

978
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,699
And frances say,
"what you doing?"

979
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,699
I said, "I'm driving."

980
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,699
She say, "no, you not!"

981
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,699
And she got in and she took
all the back streets

982
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,699
because the... you know,
the streets was blocked.

983
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,699
And she was so supportive.

984
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,699
She say, "elvira,
you feel dizzy?"

985
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,699
She say, "you feel...?"

986
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,699
You know, she say...
She say, "you all right?

987
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,699
You feel cold?"

988
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,699
She say... she say,
"the baby move?"

989
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,699
She say, "you nervous?"

990
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,699
I said, "no, I'm not nervous

991
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,699
but I'm worried
about this baby."

992
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,699
I say, "I don't want
to lose this baby."

993
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,700
- She say, "elvira, everything's going to be all right.
- She say, "elvira, everything's going to be all right.

994
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:05,699
Just pray."

995
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,699
And we had to be
blowing the horn.

996
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,699
And we got to
St. Francis hospital.

997
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,699
And, uh, we went to the front
desk and... and she say

998
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,699
"she been shot!"

999
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,699
Everybody stopped
what they was doing.

1000
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,699
And they say,
"well, what she doing walking?"

1001
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,699
I said, "I'm all right."

1002
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,699
And we went upstairs to the...

1003
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,699
They put the monitor on
to see if the baby was all right

1004
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,699
and they found
the baby heartbeat.

1005
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,699
Soon as they found
the baby heartbeat...

1006
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,699
Long as I knew, whatever
it was... boy or a girl...

1007
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,699
It was all right,
then I calmed down.

1008
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,699
And, uh, uh, matter of fact,
you know,

1009
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,699
my doctor, Dr. Thomas,
he was there in emergency room.

1010
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,699
What a coincidence, right?

1011
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,699
Because everybody saying, "oh,
you the best patient, you know.

1012
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,699
All day long everybody else
been screaming and yelling."

1013
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,699
I said, "well, you know,
I was too nervous.

1014
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,699
I couldn't do nothing."

1015
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,699
And, uh, long as I saw
Dr. Thomas,

1016
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,699
to see a familiar face,
I knew...

1017
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,699
I was looking
for a familiar face.

1018
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,699
As long as I saw him

1019
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,699
I knew I would be... I thought,
you know, I'd be all right now.

1020
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,699
So Dr. Thomas came over with
another doctor, and he say,

1021
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,699
"elvira, you know, we don't
know how deep is the bullet

1022
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,699
but we going to operate on you.

1023
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,699
And when we operate on you

1024
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,699
we going to take the baby out

1025
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,699
so you don't have
to go through all that."

1026
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,699
And they say, um, "do you
understand what we saying?"

1027
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,699
I say, "yeah!"

1028
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,699
And they say, "okay, sign here."

1029
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,699
And that's the end
of what I remember.

1030
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,699
I remember them preparing me

1031
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,699
and taking me up
to the operating room, but...

1032
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,699
Nella! Nella! No!

1033
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,699
She like company.

1034
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,699
No!

1035
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,699
And then I remember I heard
Dr. Thomas in the background,

1036
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,699
and I think I remember him
scrubbing his hands

1037
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,699
but I was too drugged up.

1038
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,699
And he say,

1039
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:54,699
"elvira, you've got a six-pound,
12-ounces little girl."

1040
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,699
And he told me
her weight and, uh, her length.

1041
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:03,699
And then he say,
"when we... when she born..."

1042
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,699
Yeah, "when she born,
she had a bullet in her elbow."

1043
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,699
And he say,
"well, when we clean her up

1044
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,699
"the bullet was
between two joints.

1045
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:20,699
"But we operate on her
and we took the bullet out.

1046
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,699
But now your daughter is fine
and you are fine."

1047
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,699
[ Laughs

1048
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,699
yeah, yeah, yeah...

1049
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,699
Yeah.

1050
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,699
Oh, and the doctor say,

1051
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,699
"when the bullet went in,
it destroyed the plas...

1052
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,699
"It went...
Destroyed the placenta

1053
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,699
and it went through me.

1054
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,699
She caught it in her arm.

1055
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,699
If she didn't caught it
in her arm

1056
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,699
her and me would be dead."

1057
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,699
So, um...

1058
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,699
It's, like, open your eyes.

1059
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,700
Watch what's going on.

1060
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,700
- Smith: Well, it's all confusion,
- Smith: Well, it's all confusion,

1061
00:55:10,703 --> 00:55:12,699
and the more we talk about this

1062
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,699
the more facets
of this confusion

1063
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,699
I can understand and see.

1064
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,699
I was coming back after having
given a performance in Seattle.

1065
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,699
So I was in Los Angeles
on the day of the riots.

1066
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,699
And some friends of mine
who are very involved

1067
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,699
in things having
to do with civil rights

1068
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,699
said, "you know,
you really ought to stay."

1069
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,699
And I said, "I can't."

1070
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,699
I said, "I have to, you know...

1071
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,699
"I'm in the middle
of a tour... I can't.

1072
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,699
And who knows

1073
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,699
whether or not the verdict's
going to come down today anyway.

1074
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,699
I'm going to go, you know,
to... to New York."

1075
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,699
And so, I was
on the plane thinking,

1076
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,699
"well, gosh, I didn't have time
to stay in Los Angeles,

1077
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,699
but what could
I have done anyway

1078
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,699
besides go to somebody's church
and sing a few songs?

1079
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,699
What... what could I have done
besides to talk or to sing

1080
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,699
to somebody who would
listen to me?"

1081
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,699
I don't think people
were in the mood

1082
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:10,699
to... to... to... listen...
To sing at that time somehow.

1083
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,699
But of... of course, of course,
of course, of course, exactly.

1084
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,699
In the civil rights movement,
you'd sing first

1085
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,699
and then you would organize
whatever protest was happening

1086
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:22,699
that day or that week
or whatever.

1087
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,699
And then we'd sing
at the end of it as well.

1088
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,699
I mean, you'd sing
all through it.

1089
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,699
We as African Americans have

1090
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,699
a great tradition of singing
ourselves through troubles.

1091
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,699
This is how the spiritual
came into being...

1092
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,699
That in order to...
To... to... deal

1093
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,699
with this unbelievable situation

1094
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,699
of having been transported
from one's homeland

1095
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,699
and been brought to some
strange place and made a slave,

1096
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,699
we had to sing ourselves
through that.

1097
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,699
We didn't sing ourselves
out of it.

1098
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,699
We sang ourselves through it.

1099
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:06,699
And I think that
if I were a person...

1100
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,699
You know, sort of a...
A... a... a...

1101
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,699
You know, a teenager or
a youngster...

1102
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,699
20 or something...

1103
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:21,699
And I felt that I were being
heard for the first time

1104
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:26,699
it would not be singing
as we know it.

1105
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,699
Oh, I think it would be a roar.

1106
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,699
It would come
from the bottom of my feet.

1107
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,699
I think it would be...
It would just be like a lion

1108
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,699
just roaring.

1109
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:45,699
It wouldn't be singing,
it wouldn't be words,

1110
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,699
it would be...
Oh, I think it would be...

1111
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:52,699
It would just be like
the earth's first utterance.

1112
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,700
I really do feel so.

1113
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,700
- Reporter: Denny was pulled out of the truck, kicked and beaten,
- Reporter: Denny was pulled out of the truck, kicked and beaten,

1114
00:58:07,703 --> 00:58:11,699
all of it on live television
eventually seen coast to coast.

1115
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,699
Reporter: Police say the man
putting his foot on Denny's neck

1116
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,699
and holding him down as others
continued to attack him

1117
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,700
is 27-year-old Henry Watson.

1118
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,699
Well, I mean, you know, huh,
that's mind blowing.

1119
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,699
I mean, you know,
you're talking about history.

1120
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,699
I mean, you know, that...

1121
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,699
That's, you know,
that's a lot of pressure.

1122
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,699
You know what I'm saying?
You understand what I'm saying?

1123
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,699
I mean, you know, I mean,
you go through life, you know,

1124
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,699
you want to make your mark,
you know,

1125
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,699
you want to leave your mark,

1126
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,699
and say, you know, hey,
you know, I was here,

1127
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,699
you know, I did it, you know?

1128
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,699
I passed through this, you know,
uh, through life, you know,

1129
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,699
uh, but never
in my wildest dreams...

1130
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,699
Did I think that something
like this would have happened

1131
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,699
in order for me to make my mark,
you know, to leave my mark.

1132
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,699
I mean, you know, I mean,
to have my name uttered

1133
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,699
in the same breath
as these two gentlemen

1134
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,699
or the same sentence
as these two gentlemen,

1135
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,699
I mean
you understand what I'm saying?

1136
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,699
I've been placed
next to Martin...

1137
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,699
I'm talking about Martin Luther
king... and Malcolm X.

1138
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,699
I mean, that's, you know,
that's... that's...

1139
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,699
That's a lot of pressure,
you know what I'm saying?

1140
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,699
That's... that's heavy,
you know?

1141
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,700
You know what I mean?
You understand?

1142
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,699
Reporter: Here's the situation
from South central.

1143
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,700
The LAPD is nowhere to be found.

1144
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,699
Smith:
And I guess when I realized

1145
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,699
something was wrong

1146
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,699
was when they bashed in
the right window of my truck.

1147
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,699
And that's the end
of what I remember

1148
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,699
till about five
or six days later

1149
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,699
when I woke up
in Daniel Freeman hospital.

1150
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,699
And they say
that I was in a coma.

1151
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,699
And it was... they were
giving me morphine for pain

1152
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,699
so it was a really
interesting time.

1153
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,699
And I think when it dawned on me

1154
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,699
that something big
might have happened was

1155
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,699
when important people
wanted to come by and see me.

1156
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,699
And one of the first people
I remember coming to see me,

1157
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,699
the first person
I was really aware of

1158
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,699
who was waiting to see me,
was reverend Jesse Jackson.

1159
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,699
And I heard the name
and I'm going, "not that guy.

1160
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,699
I mean, that's the dude I seen
on TV all the time."

1161
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,699
And then arsenio hall
came by to see me,

1162
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:48,700
and then, about then,
that's when I started to get it.

1163
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,699
Reporter: Uh, someone's standing
there, taking a picture.

1164
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,699
He's taking a videotape
of the man laying on the street

1165
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,700
but nobody's helping him.

1166
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:04,701
But nobody's helping him.

1167
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,699
Unbelievable.

1168
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,699
Here's a man with a shotgun.

1169
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,699
Smith: They accused my brother
Lance of attempted murder

1170
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,699
of shooting at Reginald Denny.

1171
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,699
They said he attempted to go
and blow up some gas pumps

1172
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,699
things of this nature.

1173
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,699
Now, my dad got shot
in the streets 11 years ago

1174
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,699
over a petty robbery, and
their attitude was, you know,

1175
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,699
"we don't want
to bring your family

1176
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,699
through the drama
and the trauma."

1177
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,699
So, basically, if it's
a black-on-black crime,

1178
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,699
you know, if it's a nigger
killing a nigger,

1179
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,699
they don't have no problem
with that.

1180
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,699
But, oh, you know,
let it be a white victim,

1181
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,699
oh, they going to go...

1182
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,699
You know, they going to go
to any extremes necessary

1183
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,700
to basically convict
some black people.

1184
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,699
Reporter: Reginald Denny did not
know who saved his life

1185
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,699
until well after
he came out of his coma.

1186
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,699
Bobby green is a truck driver.

1187
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,699
He drove Denny's big rig
to the hospital.

1188
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,699
Lei yuille is a dietitian

1189
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,699
who got in the truck
to comfort Denny.

1190
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,699
Titus Murphy was on the running
board, waving traffic away.

1191
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,699
And Terry barnett
drove her own car

1192
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,699
to block intersections
to the hospital.

1193
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,699
All four testified

1194
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,699
they saw the beating of Denny
on television

1195
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,699
and said that they felt
they must go to the scene

1196
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,699
to try to help the trucker.

1197
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,699
Since my brother was in
the room, he looked over at me,

1198
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,699
and he said to me,
"we are christians.

1199
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,740
We need to go help him,"
and I said, "you're right."

1200
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,699
Smith: And lei,
lei yuille, she's a woman,

1201
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,699
and she said that she just
kind of cradled me

1202
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,699
because there's no
passenger seat in the truck,

1203
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,699
and so I was down on my knees,

1204
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:50,699
and lei was just, like,
covered in blood.

1205
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,699
And Titus was on the side,

1206
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,699
because they bashed in
the windshield so bad

1207
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,699
that Bobby couldn't see
to drive.

1208
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,699
So Titus was
on the running board

1209
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,699
telling Bobby where to drive.

1210
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,699
And Terri...
That's Titus's girlfriend...

1211
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,699
She was out in front

1212
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,699
driving through traffic,
dodging towards cars,

1213
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,699
trying to tell them
to get out of the way.

1214
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,699
And the next stop...
Daniel Freeman hospital.

1215
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:20,699
You know, one day
I'm going to have a house,

1216
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,699
and it's going to have
one of those rooms,

1217
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,699
and it's going to be
of all the riot stuff.

1218
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:29,699
And it's not going to be
a blood-and-guts memorial.

1219
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:33,699
It's not going to be a sad room;
It's going to be a happy room,

1220
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,699
where you can just go in there

1221
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,699
and have a good ole time
in there.

1222
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:41,699
And it's going to be
of all the funny notes I got

1223
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:45,699
and all the letters
from faraway places,

1224
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,699
all the love and compassion.

1225
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,699
You know, just framed,
placed, framed things.

1226
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,699
And it's just going
to be people in that room

1227
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,699
and it's going to be
a wild place.

1228
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,699
It's going to be a blast.

1229
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,699
One day it'll happen.

1230
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,700
- Lord willing, it'll happen.
- Lord willing, it'll happen.

1231
01:04:02,703 --> 01:04:05,699
They caught it on video.

1232
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,699
Some brothers beating
the out of a white man.

1233
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,699
And then they going to do
everything in their power

1234
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,699
to try to convict
those brothers.

1235
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,699
No justice, no peace.

1236
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,699
That's basically
what my motto is...

1237
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,699
You know, you know,
and it's very simple.

1238
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,699
If we don't have
no justice here,

1239
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,699
they not going to have
no peace.

1240
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:23,699
Peace of mind, peace of body,
peace of mind.

1241
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,699
You may wake up with a dent,
a dent in your head.

1242
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,699
From now on in life...
It may not be you;

1243
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,699
It may be your daughter,
someone in your family...

1244
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,699
There's just not going
to be no peace.

1245
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,699
Huh.

1246
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,699
Yeah.

1247
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,699
One day I'm going
to have a house.

1248
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,699
And when I finally have my house

1249
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,699
I'm going to have
one of those rooms set aside

1250
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,699
and it's going to be
my "no justice, no peace" room.

1251
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,699
I'm going to have "no justice"
over here on the wall,

1252
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,699
and over here, "no peace,"

1253
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,699
and it's going to be
all my articles and clippings

1254
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,699
so that my son, you know,
my children, you know,

1255
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,699
could basically see, you know,

1256
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,699
if I do happen to be alive,
God willing,

1257
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:02,699
could basically see
what daddy did...

1258
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,699
You know, what it takes to be
a strong black man, right?

1259
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,699
If God calls you,

1260
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,699
what you got to do,
you know, for your people.

1261
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,699
Either you stand or you fall.

1262
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,700
Either be black or you die.

1263
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,699
Huh.

1264
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:22,699
We didn't get to Beverly hills.

1265
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:27,699
That don't mean we not going
to get there, keep it up.

1266
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,699
And they say we burned down
our own neighborhoods.

1267
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,699
We burned down these Koreans
in this neighborhood.

1268
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:37,699
The Koreans was like the Jews
back in the day,

1269
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,700
and we put them in check.

1270
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,699
Man: That's not right!

1271
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,699
It's not right
what you all doing!

1272
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,699
Why'd ya destroy my business?!

1273
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,699
I'm trying to make it!

1274
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,699
Couldn't you understand that?

1275
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,699
Can't you all see it?

1276
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,700
I'm trying to make it!

1277
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,699
Smith:
To use the language of decline,

1278
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,699
decay and despair,

1279
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:37,699
rather than doom, gloom,
and no possibility,

1280
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:45,699
because I think any talk about
despair is not where you end,

1281
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,699
but where you start,

1282
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:51,699
and then the courage
and the sacrifice come in...

1283
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,699
But at the level of hope,
not optimism.

1284
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,699
Optimism and hope
are different.

1285
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,699
Optimism tends to be based
on the notion

1286
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,700
- that there's enough evidence out there.
- That there's enough evidence out there

1287
01:07:01,703 --> 01:07:05,700
that allows us to think that
things are going to be better.

1288
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,699
Much more rational,
deeply secular.

1289
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:13,699
Whereas hope looks
at the evidence and says,

1290
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,699
it doesn't look good at all.

1291
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,699
It doesn't look good at all.

1292
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,699
We going to go
beyond the evidence

1293
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,699
to attempt to create
new possibilities

1294
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,699
based on visions
that become contagious,

1295
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,699
to allow us to engage in heroic
actions always against the odds

1296
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,699
no guarantee whatsoever...
That's hope.

1297
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,699
I'm a prisoner of hope, though.

1298
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,699
I'm going to die
a prisoner of hope.

1299
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,700
Never believed that misery
and despair have the last word.

1300
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:49,699
But I think...

1301
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:54,699
I think...

1302
01:07:54,700 --> 01:08:00,699
If white folks were
to experience black sadness,

1303
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:05,699
it would be too overwhelming
for them.

1304
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:09,699
Very few whites could take
seriously black sadness

1305
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,699
and still live the lives
that they living,

1306
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,699
living in denial.

1307
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,699
"Oh, it couldn't be that bad."

1308
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,699
And they got their own form
of sadness.

1309
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:24,699
It tends to be linked
to the American dream.

1310
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:29,700
But it's a very, very different
kind of sadness.

1311
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,699
Smith:
Do you remember where you were

1312
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,699
when you learned that there was
going to be a second trial?

1313
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,699
Well, I knew as
I left that courthouse

1314
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,699
that there was
going to be more.

1315
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,699
Hmm.

1316
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,699
My experience from
back home told me

1317
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,699
that the U.S. government
was going to take its turn now.

1318
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,699
Reporter:
Given the level of violence

1319
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,699
following the first trial,

1320
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,699
defense attorneys say

1321
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:03,699
their questioning
of prospective jurors

1322
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,699
will be extremely focused.

1323
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:06,699
Are you afraid?

1324
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,699
That's the number-one question.

1325
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,700
Are you afraid
to sit on this jury?

1326
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,699
Smith: The thing
is, we lost our humane in there.

1327
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,699
'Cause we saw that tape
over and over again.

1328
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,699
Rodney king became like a doll,
like a little doll.

1329
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,699
You know, even me,
I lost my humane in there.

1330
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,699
You know, at first...

1331
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,699
I told you the first time
I saw the tape how I was.

1332
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,699
I was crying and everything.

1333
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,699
By the end, I could just,
you know, watch it

1334
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,699
with a... pfft! With a soda.

1335
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:40,699
So, um, anyway I'm going to tell
you how we got to this verdict.

1336
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,699
Okay.

1337
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,699
So, uh, we get in here,
right, and...

1338
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,699
All right.

1339
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,699
So, at first, everything
was going pretty good

1340
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:53,699
and it looked like
it was going to be a "guilty"

1341
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,699
on officer Powell.

1342
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:57,699
Then we come back in here
the next day

1343
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,700
- and things is going pretty good,
- And things is going pretty good,

1344
01:09:59,703 --> 01:10:01,699
and this one woman
raises her hand

1345
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,699
and she says uh, "oh," you know.

1346
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,699
"I think I'm... I think
I'm getting a headache.

1347
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,699
I think... I think...
I think I'm going brain dead.

1348
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,699
Let's just quit."

1349
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,699
I told them, I said,

1350
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:15,699
"I don't believe you
when you say you tired."

1351
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,699
I said, "I work
at the post office."

1352
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,699
I said, "I work
a eight-hour day.

1353
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,699
They come in and they tell me
I got two hours' overtime.

1354
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,699
I work two hours overtime,

1355
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,699
and I do a job good of it.

1356
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,699
And I don't say I'm tired

1357
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:27,699
because that is my job,
and I'm not tired,

1358
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,700
and this is our job,
and we are not tired!"

1359
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,699
I agree with Maria.

1360
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,699
Don't be around here.

1361
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,699
If you so tired,

1362
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,699
get your out of here.

1363
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:52,699
We got three alternates who
would love to take your places,

1364
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,700
so get your out of here
if you so tired.

1365
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:03,700
Here come the black guy.

1366
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,699
"I have not slept in two weeks.

1367
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:20,699
"In two weeks, I have not had
one bit of sleep.

1368
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:24,699
And I have broken out in hives."

1369
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,699
And he takes off his shirt,

1370
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,699
and the man is red
all over his body.

1371
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,699
He's got hives
all over his body.

1372
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,699
He's crying
and crying and crying,

1373
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,699
he goes running
out of the room...

1374
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,699
I thought the man was going
to have a heart attack.

1375
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,699
Now, we got
this high-class lady, right?

1376
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:38,699
Real good job.

1377
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,699
Excuse me.

1378
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,699
She's over in the corner
going like this.

1379
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,699
"I hate arguing.
I hate, I hate arguing.

1380
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,699
I hate arguing,
I hate arguing, I..."

1381
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,699
Now she busts out crying...

1382
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,699
"Oh, please, if anybody
writes a movie,

1383
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,699
if anybody writes a book,

1384
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:05,699
oh, please, don't say nothing
about my family."

1385
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,699
And she starts telling us
all this stuff about her family!

1386
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,699
Which we didn't know,
so why is she telling us now?

1387
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,699
After that day, right,
I broke, right?

1388
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,699
Everybody broke, right?

1389
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,699
All this stuff that...
That did not have nothing

1390
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,699
to do with the case, right?

1391
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,699
You know,
once everybody's personal guilt

1392
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:27,699
came out onto the table
and was pushed aside,

1393
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,699
then we could look at
the evidence, the testimony,

1394
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:34,699
and, uh, you know, we came to
a verdict on Powell like that.

1395
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:36,699
Guilty... nobody cried.

1396
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:37,699
Nobody argued.

1397
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,699
You know, nobody,
you know, brought up

1398
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,699
what happened to their sister
six years ago.

1399
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,699
We just went
through the evidence.

1400
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,699
Such and such said this.

1401
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,699
Such and such said that.

1402
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,699
Just like in school:
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1403
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,699
It was simple.

1404
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,699
It took us five days,
four and a half days

1405
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:52,699
to get to that a.A. Meeting.

1406
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,699
After that a.A. Meeting,
it took us two days

1407
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:59,540
- to come up with a verdict on all four of them.
- To come up with a verdict on all four of them.

1408
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,699
Reporter:
Outside the courthouse,

1409
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,699
a crowd erupted in cheers

1410
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,699
at the announcement
of the two guilty verdicts.

1411
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:07,699
Reporter: The jury found
officer Laurence Powell,

1412
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,699
who delivered most of the blows
in the king beating,

1413
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:13,699
and sergeant Stacey koon,
who supervised, guilty.

1414
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,699
Timothy wind
and Theodore briseno

1415
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,700
were found not guilty.

1416
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,699
Man: Did it help?

1417
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:26,699
Oh, yes. Most definitely.

1418
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,699
It all depends on what side
of the track you are looking at

1419
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:29,699
as far as whether it helped.

1420
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:32,699
From a black perspective,
looking at it

1421
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,699
from a black neighborhood,
it did help.

1422
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,699
First of all,
let me make something

1423
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,699
perfectly clear...
It's not a riot, all right?

1424
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,699
It's more...
It's a civil unrest...

1425
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,699
Or, as a lot of us call it,
a revolution.

1426
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:43,699
A riot is a situation

1427
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,699
where you don't have
no political overtones.

1428
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:46,699
Did you go out and riot?

1429
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,699
Well, you know,
first of all, let me say,

1430
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,699
I don't consider it
to be a riot.

1431
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:52,699
Did you go out and engage in
a civil unrest?

1432
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,699
You know what, I did not...

1433
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,699
I... I... I in...

1434
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,699
I was involved in a lot
of things that went down.

1435
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,699
And right...
Now you're sounding like...

1436
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,699
Now you're sounding
like the average, uh, European

1437
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:05,699
that... that... that kidnapped
the black folks over there.

1438
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,301
Do you steal when you're
in a revolution?

1439
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,699
Smith: Let me suggest
one possibility here.

1440
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,699
As much as we all are going
to talk,

1441
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,699
is just to make sure
that we're listening.

1442
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,699
Black and brown haven't gotten
together in this town.

1443
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,699
They are living side by side,
house to house

1444
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,699
throughout South Los Angeles,
you know,

1445
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,699
and they're no more
together today...

1446
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,699
There's no more
understanding today

1447
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,699
than there was in 1992.

1448
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,699
Woman: You know,
it's very interesting

1449
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,699
that so many
Korean people's anger

1450
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:34,699
came up against the police

1451
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,699
because I think
that many people thought

1452
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,699
they were cultivating the mayor

1453
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,699
and cultivating the police,

1454
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:41,699
and they have
an idea of America

1455
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,699
being this land of everything

1456
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:45,699
is that law and freedom
and fairness.

1457
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,699
And then they watch
the police standing by

1458
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,699
while their businesses
and livelihoods

1459
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:51,699
were being destroyed.

1460
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,699
They were shocked.

1461
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:55,699
They thought, "why are they
protecting Beverly hills

1462
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,699
and they're not going
to protect us?"

1463
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:22,699
Smith: I used to believe.

1464
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:25,699
America was the best.

1465
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,699
I still do.

1466
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:32,699
I don't deny that
because I am a victim.

1467
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,699
But...

1468
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,699
After the riots,

1469
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,699
when we were in such turmoil,

1470
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:45,699
and having
all the financial problems

1471
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,699
and all the mental problems,

1472
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,699
I began to really realize

1473
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,699
that Koreans

1474
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,200
are completely left out

1475
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:56,699
are completely left out

1476
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:00,699
of, uh, this society.

1477
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,699
And we are nothing.

1478
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,700
Nothing.

1479
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,700
What is our right?

1480
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:20,699
Why do we have to be left out?

1481
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:25,699
Is it because we are Korean?

1482
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,700
Is it because we have
no politicians?

1483
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:36,700
Is it because we don't speak
good English?

1484
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:42,700
Why?
Why do we have to be left out?

1485
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:49,699
We didn't qualify
for medical treatment.

1486
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:52,699
No food stamp.

1487
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,699
No g.R.

1488
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:59,699
No welfare.

1489
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,699
Anything!

1490
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:08,699
Many African-Americans
who never work

1491
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,699
get minimum amount of money
to survive.

1492
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:15,699
We didn't get any...

1493
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:21,699
Because we have a car
and a house.

1494
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:25,700
And, uh, we are high taxpayer.

1495
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:37,699
Where do I find the justice?

1496
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,700
Okay?

1497
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:50,699
Many African-Americans probably
think they won by the trial.

1498
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:51,699
I was sitting here watching them

1499
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,699
the morning after the verdict,

1500
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,699
and all the day,

1501
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,699
and they were having a party!

1502
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,699
They celebrated.

1503
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,699
All of South central,
all the churches.

1504
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,699
And they say, "well, finally

1505
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:14,699
justice has been done
in this society."

1506
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:17,699
Well, what
about victims' rights?

1507
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,699
They got their rights

1508
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:25,699
by destroying innocent
Korean merchants.

1509
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:32,699
And I wonder if that
is really justice

1510
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,699
for them...

1511
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:40,699
To get their rights

1512
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:44,699
in that way.

1513
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,700
I was, uh...

1514
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,700
Swallowing the bitterness,

1515
01:18:55,701 --> 01:18:58,699
swallowing the bitterness,

1516
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:02,699
sitting here alone
and watching them.

1517
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,699
Oh, they became all hilarious.

1518
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:13,699
But I was, uh, I was, I was...

1519
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,699
I was happy for them, I was...

1520
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,699
I was glad for them.

1521
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:23,699
At least that they got
something back.

1522
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:27,699
Okay?

1523
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,699
Let's just forget
about Korean victims

1524
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:36,699
and... and... and other victims
who were destroyed by them.

1525
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,699
They fought for their rights

1526
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,699
for over two centuries.

1527
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:48,699
And maybe because
of their sacrifice,

1528
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,699
other minorities...
Hispanic, Asian...

1529
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,699
We, we one that suffer more
in the mainstream.

1530
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,699
That's why I understand.

1531
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:02,699
I... I have a lot of sympathy
and understanding for them.

1532
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:09,699
That's why I have, uh,
mixed feeling about the verdict.

1533
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,699
But I, I...

1534
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:17,699
I wish that I could be part

1535
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,700
of their joyment.

1536
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:28,699
I wish that I could live
together with black people.

1537
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:33,699
But after the riots it is...
It's too much difference.

1538
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:36,699
The fire is still there.

1539
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,699
How do you say it?

1540
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,699
Uh, ig... ig... ig...
Ig... uh...

1541
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,699
Igna... ignite?

1542
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:48,699
Igniting.

1543
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:51,699
Igniting, igniting, igniting,

1544
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:55,699
igniting fire, igniting fire.

1545
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:57,699
It's still there.

1546
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:00,699
It can, um,

1547
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:03,700
burst out any time.

1548
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:32,699
Sometimes when I take my ideas
to my homeboys,

1549
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,699
they say, "well, twilight,

1550
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,699
that's an idea
that's before its time."

1551
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,699
Like in 1988,

1552
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,699
when I was talking
about the gang truce,

1553
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,699
that was an idea they said
was before its time.

1554
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,699
But then in 1992

1555
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,699
we made it realistic.

1556
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,200
And so sometimes I feel
as though I'm stuck in limbo

1557
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:56,699
and so sometimes I feel
as though I'm stuck in limbo

1558
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:59,699
the way the sun is stuck
between night and day

1559
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,699
in the twilight hours.

1560
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:07,699
I'm in an area
not many people exist.

1561
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:12,699
And nighttime to me
is like a lack of sun...

1562
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,699
Although I don't affiliate
darkness with anything negative.

1563
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,699
I affiliate darkness
with what came first

1564
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,699
because it was first.

1565
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,699
And then relative
to my complexion,

1566
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,699
I am a dark individual.

1567
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:30,699
And with me being stuck
in limbo,

1568
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,699
I see the darkness as myself.

1569
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:36,699
And I see the light

1570
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:40,699
as the knowledge and the wisdom
of the world

1571
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,699
and the understanding of others.

1572
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:48,699
And I know, in order for me
to be a true human being,

1573
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:51,699
I cannot forever dwell
in darkness.

1574
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:55,699
I cannot forever dwell
in the idea

1575
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:59,699
of identifying
with those like me

1576
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,699
and understanding
only me and mine.

1577
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:07,699
And so, twilight is that time

1578
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:11,699
between day and night.

1579
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,699
Limbo.

1580
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:16,700
I call it limbo.
