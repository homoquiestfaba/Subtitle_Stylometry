1
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,719
Railen.

2
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,030
I'm on my way.

3
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,870
Gentlemen.

4
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,837
All right. Tell me what we know.

5
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,339
Intel confirms that this morning,

6
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,676
5:15 A.M. Eastern Standard Time,
12:45 P.M. in Iran,

7
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,280
the Iranian government test detonated
a small nuclear device.

8
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,716
It was set off in an underground cavern
in a remote area,

9
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,685
350 kilometers southeast of Tehran.

10
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,221
The bang was a little bigger
than they were expecting.

11
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:40,192
Mm. So much for their
non-military nuclear agenda.

12
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,727
No coffee this morning?

13
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,695
Only the President gets coffee in here.

14
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,630
Right.

15
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,032
Well, he's going to need something
a little bit stronger than coffee

16
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,367
when he gets back.

17
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,535
If we'd had some proof earlier,

18
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,470
we could have taken out
their reactor site

19
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,071
when we had the chance.

20
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,207
The reactor wasn't the source.

21
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,809
Previous intel put the Iranians'
Weapons Program a good year

22
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,079
and a half away from being able to
produce a viable device.

23
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,882
We've since learned that
they may have acquired nuclear materials

24
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,418
through the black market in Pakistan.

25
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,720
You said materials plural.

26
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,990
Are you trying to tell me
that they may have more than one nuke?

27
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,659
The Taliban claims to have seized

28
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,495
a cache of 3 devices in Pakistan
a month ago.

29
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,665
It's likely they sold them to Iran
right under our nose.

30
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,804
And you're telling me now?

31
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,169
The President wanted
intel confirmation before

32
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,538
Well, I'd say we got that today.

33
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,441
Except now,
a tactical strike is too risky.

34
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,842
We bomb the wrong place,

35
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,445
we'll put a mushroom cloud
over the Middle East.

36
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,449
Not the best foreign policy strategy.

37
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,085
All right.
The President is in Tokyo.

38
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,854
I'll get Chief of Staff Jenkins
to brief him,

39
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,190
and get him back to D.C.
before tomorrow morning.

40
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:49,728
In the meantime, let's get
Homeland Security and DOD in the loop.

41
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,563
Director Thompson will update intel

42
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,666
and we'll meet back here
this afternoon 16:00

43
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,168
Let's go.

44
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,960
Worms, dear boy.

45
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:26,398
If you expect to lure anything
from this godforsaken mud puddle,

46
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,035
you must use that
which comes from the Earth, worms.

47
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,471
You're absolutely right, Dad.

48
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,849
Yeah, of course I'm right,
I'm your father.

49
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,252
It's quite nice here, actually.

50
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,016
Your mother would have loved it.

51
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,862
Yeah.

52
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,823
You don't really expect to
catch anything with that, will you?

53
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,226
I've got some worms in the truck
if you like.

54
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,294
No, no, no, no, no, no.

55
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,461
That's all right.

56
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,569
I'm just, just here
for the scenery anyway.

57
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,302
Oh, don't worry.

58
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,337
Got breakfast already on the stove.

59
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,571
Oh, good.

60
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,973
Well.

61
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,442
I was half expecting to
have to clean a fish

62
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,911
before you gave me something
to eat out here.

63
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,085
I thought you liked this place.

64
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,382
I said your mother would have liked it.

65
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,550
Oh.

66
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,753
I would have preferred you bought a house
in Beverly Hills.

67
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,556
Taken me to see some celebrities
and walk the red carpet.

68
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,826
Come on, Dad,
I'm not that kind of famous.

69
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,127
Just wrote a book.

70
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,301
A best seller.

71
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,031
The public loved it.

72
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,376
Yeah, those at the science
fiction conventions.

73
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,237
My peers didn't seem to
think much of it,

74
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,275
if they even read it at all, that is.

75
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,119
Eggheads. Every one of them.

76
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,086
Uh, no offense.

77
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:54,519
You are going to regret it out here
when the first snow storm strikes.

78
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,432
Unless you've made plans to fly south
for the winter.

79
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,271
Of course,
flying east is interesting too.

80
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,545
Ah, silly birds.

81
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,080
Do you think they're lost?

82
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,858
Come on, let's go.

83
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,132
Melanie?

84
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,560
Uh, Rose Cancer Clinic?

85
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,095
Knock it off!

86
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,167
Where am I supposed to go?
Jeez, Louise.

87
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,944
Hi.

88
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,548
Dr. Jenna Ward, I presume.

89
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,872
I know, I'm late.
I'm late, Joe, I know.

90
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,642
It's an accident or something.
We're all just sitting here.

91
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,054
Really? I didn't even notice.

92
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,013
I got 2 patients in the waiting room,
1 in back,

93
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,149
and Melanie's disappeared
to get coffee again.

94
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,684
We really need to get a coffee maker
for the office.

95
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,420
Nah. It wouldn't change anything.

96
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,089
Then someone would just have to
teach her how to brew coffee.

97
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,425
And, you know, hot water confuses her.

98
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,294
Well, don't blame me, I didn't hire her.

99
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,063
Well, I guess I wasn't looking at
her resume during the interview.

100
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,508
Pig.

101
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,739
Knock it off!

102
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,135
Not you, Joe. Sorry.

103
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,670
Anything pressing?

104
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,440
Yeah, yeah.
Actually we got another patient

105
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,909
reporting fatigue, dizziness,
and nausea.

106
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,911
The same symptoms
as the ones from yesterday.

107
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,345
Chemo reaction?

108
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,882
No, no. She finished
her chemo radiation therapy months ago.

109
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,918
Completely successful,
she'd been in remission ever since then.

110
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,693
This is more like,

111
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,623
well, altitude sickness.

112
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,725
We're like, 5 miles from the ocean.

113
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,627
How could it be altitude sickness?

114
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,664
Well, beats me.

115
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,531
Oh, and your buddy Alberto is back.

116
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,912
Said that he, uh, he's having
his memory erased by someone named Guy.

117
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,972
Don't you just love your job,
Dr. Bradford?

118
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,340
Oh yeah.

119
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,476
Oh, and your brother, Marty called,
he had to cancel dinner tonight

120
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,744
because, uh, something came up at work.

121
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,880
And I was gonna cook too.

122
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,588
Oh, that's perfect. I was gonna eat.

123
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,053
Come on. I know you really
wanted to invite me instead.

124
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,828
Dream on.

125
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,289
Whoa!

126
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,724
Stop it!

127
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,499
Screw you!

128
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,573
Dr. Ward.
-What's up, Kimi?

129
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,242
Levels of solar radiation.

130
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,011
Just since last night,
there's been a 40 rem spike.

131
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,046
Did you monitor for solar flares?

132
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,414
Yeah, and that's not it.

133
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,717
There's no unusual solar activity at all.

134
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,418
Gamma in the thermosphere is unchanged.

135
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,988
We're just getting more of it
down here on the surface.

136
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,690
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

137
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,034
Uh, show me the numbers, Ethan.

138
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,696
I double checked the numbers.

139
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,899
I shot them over to the WDC
for confirmation.

140
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,566
What did they say?

141
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,069
They said they'd get back to us.

142
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,872
Sorry I had to bring you in, Dr. Ward.
I know you had plans.

143
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,580
Oh, no. That's okay.

144
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:07,018
My sister was cooking,
so, you actually did me a favor.

145
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,154
This can't be good.

146
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,059
This is an internal problem.

147
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,360
It's not coming from the sun.

148
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,229
Right. The solar wind hasn't changed.

149
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,331
The Earth's rotation has.

150
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,335
From these readings, it looks like

151
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,848
we're slowing down.

152
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,840
Pull up all 200 NOAA observatories.

153
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,009
Plug the raw data into a model.

154
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,344
Let's, uh, focus.

155
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,483
See if we can figure this thing out.

156
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,308
Something's not right.

157
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,916
Ah, you look nice.

158
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,251
Where are you off to?

159
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,494
Ah, I'm just meeting an acquaintance
for dinner.

160
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,295
Ah-ha.

161
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,045
Oh, I hope you don't mind my decorating.

162
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,113
I made a few frames.
It was a little project of mine.

163
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,448
I was going to put them up.

164
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,949
No, no, that's fine.

165
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,217
They're good pictures.

166
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,186
I particularly like the one
of you and Mom.

167
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,555
Ah, yes. That was a fine day.

168
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,857
And a fancy restaurant you took us to.

169
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,269
Yeah, she was happy.

170
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,029
Yeah.

171
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,999
If only I'd known
how little time we had left.

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,867
No one knew, Dad.

173
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,936
But like you said, she was happy.

174
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,438
And you can't ask for more than that.

175
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,039
Yes.

176
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,609
Well, it is 50 miles to town.

177
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,280
I, I think I'll stay in this evening.

178
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,616
Come on, Dad, it's been 7 years.

179
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,654
Mom wouldn't want you to
spend the rest of your life alone.

180
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,257
What about you?

181
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,499
Well, I'm not alone, am I?

182
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,739
You're always here.

183
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,864
Well, you know what I mean.

184
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,641
You were happy once too, with Jenna.

185
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,845
Thanks, Dad.

186
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,205
Thanks for caring.

187
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,707
I, I really do appreciate it.

188
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,449
This isn't about caring.

189
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,451
But I do know happiness.

190
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,788
And we're all entitled to that.

191
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,420
I'm fine.

192
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,920
Good.

193
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,589
Then why don't you come along with me?

194
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,092
I'm sure you're worried
I'll drive into a ditch or something.

195
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,428
No, that's okay. You, you go ahead.

196
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,931
I, I've got everything I need.

197
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,114
Not everything, my boy.

198
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,372
You gonna bring her some flowers?

199
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,074
Of course.

200
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,646
We can't all be naturally charming.

201
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,516
Some of us need props.

202
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,829
Tallyho!

203
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,428
It's happening.

204
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,603
What are you doing now?

205
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,897
What the hell is going on?

206
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,732
It was a warning.

207
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,959
She is not finished yet.

208
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,962
Hey, Al, you still here?

209
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,269
Who are you?

210
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,335
Well, Alberto, it's, it's me.

211
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,072
Dr. Bradford.

212
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,272
I mean, I saw you this morning.

213
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,845
Did you feel it, Doctor?

214
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,307
The little tremor?
-Yeah.

215
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,575
Yeah. It's nothing
to be worried about, Al.

216
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,277
It's California. That happens.

217
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,280
It's nothing to panic over.

218
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,581
Power outage is a bigger pain
in the neck.

219
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,950
I mean, are you okay?
You want to come down from there?

220
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,488
Something new is happening.

221
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,155
And it's starting now.

222
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,523
Listen, Al.

223
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,292
You're gonna need
a new course of treatment.

224
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,127
Now we can do the follow-up test
and regimen here at the clinic,

225
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,296
but you can't just,
you know, hang out here.

226
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,504
I am waiting for the bus.

227
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,947
My daughter left on the bus.

228
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,445
She said I should stay here.

229
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,908
Well, listen, if you need help. . .

230
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,185
No, no. I am fine.

231
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,014
There is a reason for everything.

232
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,149
It is all connected.

233
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,323
But you can't see it.

234
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,855
You have to feel it.

235
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,256
Okay. Whatever.

236
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,291
I'll make a call.

237
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,493
I know a place you can go
that- that can help.

238
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,028
I ain't going anywhere.

239
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,631
Melanie, uh,
you can't take a 2 hour lunch.

240
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,236
Hi.

241
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,444
You see, Doctor.

242
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,013
You are the one who needs help.

243
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,073
Okay, the doctor will be with you soon.

244
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,746
Gracias.

245
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,220
Ah.

246
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,280
Joe, would you just ask her out already?

247
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,148
Well, I would, but I can't.
I'm her employer.

248
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,721
Exactly. Do us all a favor and fire her.

249
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,566
Yes. Thank you.

250
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,857
Yeah, but do you think
she'd actually go out with me

251
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,497
if I. . . if I fired her?

252
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,196
You know, the city was supposed
to change out these transformers

253
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,231
the last time this happened.

254
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,532
Hey, you know,
maybe we should double date.

255
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,800
You know, less pressure.

256
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,939
Mm, no. I don't think so.

257
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,038
Yeah, but weren't you dating
some scientist guy,

258
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,172
a friend of your brother's?

259
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,341
I was dating him.

260
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,085
Joe. He dumped me. Remember?

261
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,521
Yeah, but,

262
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,254
Jenna, I. . .

263
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,931
I guess that's a no.

264
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,875
The surge knocked out
almost 1/3 of the city

265
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,576
on the old power grid.

266
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,216
The new portions held up, though.

267
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,382
Ethan, what do you got for me?

268
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,485
Um, Cal Tech recorded the tremor
as a 2-point-oh.

269
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,586
Barely even felt it.

270
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,755
Just a, a minor Earth adjustment.

271
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:38,756
They don't know that.

272
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,559
Uh, well, no. I guess.

273
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,960
No guessing, Ethan.

274
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,963
Not here.
Science is about gathering facts.

275
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,740
Uh, okay.

276
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,383
Are you all right, Dr. Ward?

277
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,759
Yeah, it's just. . .

278
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:10,256
I- I look at things a certain way
based on what I know to be true.

279
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,657
I can't make the leap
from fact to theory.

280
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,967
I just don't work that way.

281
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,395
Yeah, me neither.

282
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,963
Really?

283
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,531
Well, in most things.

284
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,033
Except for dating.

285
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,569
What?

286
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:27,572
Well, facts only go so far
when you're dealing with people.

287
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:32,544
Sometimes it's all about
a leap of faith.

288
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,603
Just stick to the facts.

289
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,171
The Iranian government
is denying reports

290
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,373
that there was any sort of weapons test.

291
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,342
But as you can see
from the satellite surveillance,

292
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:08,045
this village near Tabas
was leveled by the shockwave.

293
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,215
Now we believe most of the radiation
was contained underground,

294
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,819
but elevated levels are being reported
by neighboring countries.

295
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,387
6 months ago,

296
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,589
a bombing run targeting
their nuclear facilities

297
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,291
was on the table.

298
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,794
You, General Railen, advised restraint.

299
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,197
I advised the President
that without proof

300
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,333
that their enrichment program
was weapons related,

301
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,437
an attack would be a breach
of international law.

302
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,073
Well, then he should've given you
the proof you needed.

303
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,975
All due respect, Mr. McNeil,

304
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,677
you're the Secretary of Defense.

305
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,412
You advised him too.

306
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,080
The only advice I gave him

307
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,082
was to cut out
all the bleeding heart pacifists

308
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,684
from his administration.

309
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,223
Perhaps you lack a little objectivity
in the matter.

310
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:55,059
No one here is suggesting that
we roll over for the Iranians, McNeil.

311
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,827
But if they're sitting on another nuke,

312
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:00,631
we have to factor that
into our available response options.

313
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,304
Fine.

314
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,436
Work out a full series
of recommendations.

315
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,679
I'll brief the President
when he returns in the morning.

316
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:13,778
I want multiple projections
for military engagements.

317
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,694
Consider both conventional
and nuclear options.

318
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,559
Okay, let's get to work.

319
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,336
What is it?

320
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,772
The World Data Center got a call
from some NGDC scientist

321
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:45,476
who said they've recorded a spike
in radiation levels worldwide.

322
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,422
It can't be connected.

323
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,813
Even under strong wind conditions,

324
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,749
the radiation and the fallout
would be relatively localized.

325
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,085
Yeah, but the center confirmed it.

326
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,353
They say it's everywhere.

327
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,389
Oh, hell. Who's the scientist?

328
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,359
A, um, Martin Ward
from the Los Angeles office.

329
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,860
We can have him send us the data.

330
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,996
No. No. We need to control the source,

331
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,864
keep this contained.

332
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,400
I'll have my office muzzle the WDC.

333
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,279
And then you and I
are going on a quick trip.

334
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,810
So other than the dizziness
and the fatigue,

335
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,791
is there anything else
that's bothering you?

336
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,321
Thank you.

337
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,268
I will take that as a yes.

338
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,297
Okay, now you just rest.

339
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,865
Uh, give this a couple minutes to work.

340
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,142
Okay?

341
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,807
Same symptoms?

342
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,576
Worse. And she finished treatment
2 months ago.

343
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,612
So it's not from the chemo.

344
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,213
She's disoriented and dizzy.

345
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,182
She doesn't seem to know where she is.

346
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,254
I've got 4 more just like her
in reception. Come on.

347
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,760
Okay, this is just very weird.

348
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,331
And it's presenting like, um,
altitude sickness almost, right?

349
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,403
Which doesn't make any sense.
-No. It doesn't.

350
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,712
One second. Mr. Simon?

351
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,655
How are you feeling, Mr. Simon?

352
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,754
Mr. Simon?

353
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,292
Do you know where you are?

354
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,942
Joe.

355
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,300
He is a survivor.

356
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,868
He had his chemo in January.

357
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,905
He did so well with it
that he was mobile within a month.

358
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,741
I just, I don't get it.

359
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,810
We're gonna have to pull
everybody's charts from the last year.

360
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,679
I'll give Debbie at the
Center for Disease Control a call.

361
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,592
Maybe we're dealing with
some kind of localized contagion.

362
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,422
How are you feeling?

363
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,393
I'm fine. You?

364
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,555
Nothing fazes this guy.

365
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,227
She had to go away.

366
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,229
For the baby. You understand?

367
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,597
It's not that she didn't love me.

368
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,666
Uh, uh, it's just that
sometimes we gotta leave.

369
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,269
Uh, Mexico is a good place for her.

370
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,147
How you doing, Al?

371
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,174
Ah, Dr. Jenna.

372
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,052
I know you.

373
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:36,914
Are you okay? Dr. Joe said that
some guy was stealing your memory?

374
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,349
Not some guy.

375
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,017
Gaia.

376
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,657
It is the name of Mother Earth.

377
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:46,757
I feel her. I, I hear her sometimes.

378
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,293
So you're hearing voices in your head?

379
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:53,230
Voices? No. I hear.

380
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,210
I feel her.

381
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,069
Are you, are you dizzy? Have a seat.

382
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,472
Are- are you lightheaded or- or tired?

383
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,508
Ah, I am always tired these days.

384
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,511
That is nothing new.

385
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,947
But you need answers
to bigger questions than this.

386
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,248
This is true, Al.

387
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:15,019
The answer is inside you.

388
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,153
What?

389
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,224
What does it mean?

390
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,057
I feel her.

391
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,095
The Earth is tired too, you see.

392
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,130
If we don't give Mother a rest,

393
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,168
then sometimes she can't go on.

394
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,304
Al, could all this
be about your daughter?

395
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,572
That she left?

396
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,373
Oh, no.

397
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,013
Yeah, she needed a rest too.

398
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,156
A rest from me.

399
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,755
We all need a rest.

400
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,126
Don't worry, Dr. Jenna.

401
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,687
Just because someone leaves,

402
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,395
doesn't mean they do not love you.

403
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,227
Hello?

404
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,367
Who's calling?

405
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,666
Hello?

406
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,635
Jenna. It- it's me, Marty.

407
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:08,049
Oh, hey, Marty. Hold on just a sec.

408
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,142
You okay?

409
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,310
Yep. Hang on.

410
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,413
Just, just trying to get a better signal.

411
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,949
Hold on.

412
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,819
You know what?
I am not okay, by the way.

413
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,455
You just totally blew me off.
My own brother.

414
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,858
Some lame excuse about working late.

415
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,126
Now come on, what's the real story?

416
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,061
You got a hot date?
Who's the lucky girl?

417
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,997
No, no, really. Jenna.

418
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,565
Something kind of serious
popped up in our data.

419
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,201
It's gonna take me some time
to sort it all out.

420
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,739
I just wanted to, um,

421
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,139
uh, so you're okay?

422
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,807
Yeah. I mean, you're just missing dinner.

423
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,676
It's not like it's the end of the world.

424
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,344
Are you okay?

425
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,479
Uh, yeah, yeah.

426
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,780
No, I- I- I'm fine.

427
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,316
Um, but, uh,

428
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,764
is anything out of the ordinary
happening at the clinic?

429
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,390
Yeah. Actually.

430
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,425
About half a dozen people or so
have been coming in all day

431
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,827
complaining of altitude sickness,

432
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,630
like nausea, they're disoriented.

433
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,233
And it doesn't have anything to do
with their cancer treatment.

434
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,668
They're all here for aftercare.

435
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,637
You know, they got through their chemo
and their radiation fine.

436
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,209
So, why are you asking?

437
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,411
Did you read David's book?

438
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,913
I thought you said there was
nothing in there worth reading.

439
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,449
Yeah, I know what I said.
If I could take it back I would.

440
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,918
Uh, I just figured
you might have given it a chance

441
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,456
in spite of your pigheaded brother.

442
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,890
Well, yeah. I did start reading it.

443
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,391
The night of the book signing.

444
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,371
That was a good night.

445
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,963
Yeah, it was.

446
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,665
But, you know,
after you and David had your falling out

447
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,068
and he just disappeared on me,

448
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,769
I wasn't exactly in the,

449
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,506
well, let's curl up with
a really depressing book kind of mood.

450
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,507
You thought it was depressing?

451
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,509
I mean, it was kind of thick
and technical, but--

452
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,011
Hello?

453
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,318
Uh, Jenna?

454
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,993
Marty?

455
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,993
Marty? Ugh.

456
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,626
Hello? Hello?

457
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,393
Hello? Can you hear me now?

458
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,395
Jenna, look,

459
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:16,266
things are happening that may indicate
an upcoming geophysical event.

460
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,235
In English, please?

461
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:22,274
Uh, well, I'm, uh,
I'm- I'm still working on the data.

462
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,447
Well, to hell with the data, Marty.
What's going on?

463
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,077
I- I'm not sure yet.

464
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,846
Do you think David may know something?

465
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,648
Well, David has theories and ideas,
Jenna.

466
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,288
I have the facts
right here in front of me.

467
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,788
Marty, clearly,
the two of you need to talk.

468
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,923
I mean, just because he and I
aren't together anymore,

469
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,359
doesn't mean you can't talk.

470
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,569
No. We've gone our separate ways,
in completely opposite directions.

471
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,198
Okay, look. That's silly.

472
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:51,235
This is important.
Just let him help you with this.

473
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,236
Hello?

474
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,377
Je- hey, Jenna?

475
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,978
Marty? If you can hear me,
gi- just give him another chance.

476
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,255
You're home early.

477
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,690
What happened?

478
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,258
No dessert?

479
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,227
Or dinner for that matter.

480
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,830
It seems that
her mother wasn¡¦t feeling very well.

481
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,140
She was waiting at home for her.

482
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:59,503
Well, that sounds like a,
a reasonable excuse.

483
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,608
Oh, balls to that.

484
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:06,643
Can you believe a parent would
live with their child for that long?

485
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:09,181
Into their 90s?

486
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,985
Oh, Lord, I hope not.

487
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,826
Come on. I've started dinner.

488
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,134
Los Angeles, this is Zero-One, come in.

489
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,706
Something's wrong.

490
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,804
General, we've lost GPS navigation.

491
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,506
We're getting radio interference
out of Edwards.

492
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,748
We're switching to auxiliary com.

493
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,109
Auxiliary?

494
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,879
Microwave when all else fails.

495
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,791
Puts me right at ease.

496
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,351
What's the problem, Pilot?

497
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,126
No problem, General.

498
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,703
Stay with it. Level out.

499
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,403
Panel's down.
We're sitting on visual only.

500
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,969
Well done, Pilot.

501
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,347
Patch me through to Edwards.

502
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,183
Edwards Tower, do you read?

503
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:17,080
Where are we?
Last coordinates before you lost GPS?

504
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,882
Just over Nevada.

505
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,124
All right, take us down.

506
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,059
This day just keeps getting better.

507
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,328
No more tomatoes?

508
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,198
I shall go into town tomorrow
and pick up some necessities.

509
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,332
What are you talking about?

510
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,669
You- you've just got through
griping about being stood up.

511
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,305
Now you're gonna drive
another 50 miles for her?

512
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,006
What's twisting your britches?

513
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,453
Did you have a wretched afternoon?

514
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,177
Ah, you're right. I'm sorry.

515
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,913
But, uh, it doesn't matter.

516
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:54,521
I, I suppose there's just some things
you have to accept.

517
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,663
Well, I don't know about accepting.

518
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:01,860
In my time of life,
you learn to let things slide a little.

519
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,338
Life's too short.

520
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:08,240
And second chances are priceless.

521
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,901
Dad, don't start with me, all right?

522
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,676
Why not?

523
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,305
You tell me you're fine.

524
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:19,643
But you won't explain to me
your decidedly melancholic behavior.

525
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,645
I may not be a scientist,

526
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,990
but I'm very much aware of the world
in which we live.

527
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,218
After all, I've lived in it
longer than you have.

528
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,996
You think about Jenna all the time.

529
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:37,694
Why don't you go back
and make it right?

530
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:41,142
It's, it's complicated, Dad.

531
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,201
It's just better this way.

532
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,706
You mean, it's easier for you this way?

533
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,309
You don't understand.

534
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,277
Of course not. I've told you,

535
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,746
love is a mystery to me.

536
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,481
And any person who claims to

537
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,883
fully understand what
draws 2 people together

538
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:03,297
is either a blithering fool

539
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,255
or an advertiser trying to sell jewelry.

540
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,066
But one thing I do know,

541
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:14,103
if you are fortunate enough
to meet someone,

542
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:18,302
anyone you can share time with,

543
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:24,617
for however much time
you may have left,

544
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:31,020
you are an absolute fool
if you let that time slip by.

545
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,851
Yeah, well, the fact is,
our time is up.

546
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,060
There's not a damn thing
anyone can do about it.

547
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,057
Look.

548
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,625
Don't worry about going back to town.

549
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,403
Forget the tomatoes.
I'll, I'll get some beets.

550
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,486
You want me to push everyone away,
retreat from the world,

551
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,888
and be alone like you?

552
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,557
What are you frightened of?

553
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,192
Dad, I'm not frightened.

554
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,960
I've been expecting this for a while.

555
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,997
Expecting what?

556
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,135
Answers, David.

557
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,470
You'd better fill me in
if you don't want me to go into town.

558
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,771
I presume this is not
just about my attempts

559
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,173
to pursue a romance
at the local restaurant.

560
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,347
No, of course it's not.

561
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:38,815
Well then, I must assume
this is to do with your other concern.

562
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,384
Oh, what's that?

563
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,887
Those polar bear fields, right?

564
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,697
Polar bear fields?

565
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,367
I glanced at your notebook.

566
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:52,362
Dad, those are the compass bearings

567
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:56,572
of the, of the polar magnetic fields.

568
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,970
What are you talking about?

569
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,104
All right.

570
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,846
Do you know how the dinosaurs died?

571
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,710
Yes, they got a taste of your cooking.

572
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,021
Uh, look, Dad, I'm being serious.

573
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,481
There was, uh,

574
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,418
there was some kind of
massive geophysical event, all right?

575
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,720
Uh, uh, pro- most probably
a meteor strike.

576
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,323
But, something else happened.

577
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:25,062
The Earth's magnetic fields
were weakened by up to 80%

578
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,632
That's why the dinosaurs
weren't able to re-evolve.

579
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:32,269
There was a massive die-off
of all living things.

580
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,908
Well,

581
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,012
now it's our turn.

582
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,181
My life's complicated enough.

583
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:48,220
I wouldn't wish this kind of complication
on anyone I love.

584
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,131
Then why the bloody hell
did you tell me?

585
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:02,138
What do you say we have filet mignon
for supper tonight instead, huh?

586
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,394
General.

587
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,099
General Railen?

588
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,977
Right this way, ma'am.

589
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,511
Sir.

590
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:14,871
Clinic?

591
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:15,906
Hey, Jenna.

592
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,341
This is Debbie
at the CDC returning Joe's call.

593
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,210
Hey Debbie.
Do you want to talk to him?

594
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,344
Oh no. Ooh, please.

595
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,747
There is only so much Joe
I can take in a week.

596
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:27,684
I would have called you on your cell,
but, satellite communications are down.

597
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,818
Really?

598
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,020
You didn't know?

599
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,023
Okay, Jenna, you really need to
watch the news more often.

600
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,357
Well, we had a small earthquake here

601
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,593
and the power was out
for a couple minutes, so.

602
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,361
Yeah, that's been happening everywhere.

603
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,031
No one knows why,
but it isn't pretty.

604
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,699
Well, my brother said
something happened.

605
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,602
Well, whatever it was, there's been
an overnight international rise

606
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,672
in what looks like radiation sickness.

607
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,507
You know, that fits, Debbie,

608
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,176
because, I think I found a pattern.

609
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,978
Everybody here that's
coming down with symptoms,

610
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,547
they're all successful chemo
and radiation patients.

611
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,051
It's like it's only hitting
the healthy ones.

612
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,253
The answer is inside of them, Jenna.

613
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,120
What?

614
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,990
RLIP-76.

615
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,125
It's a protein we've been looking at.

616
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,827
It acts as a barrier to stressors

617
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,663
like chemotherapeutic agents
and radiation.

618
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,405
Some people have it, some don't.

619
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,835
And the ones who don't
are more sensitive to radiation.

620
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,670
Exactly. It's great for fighting cancer,

621
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,941
but unfortunately, it leaves them
more vulnerable to other exposures.

622
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,077
Listen,
try to keep your patients inside.

623
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,312
We've just issued a global health alert.

624
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,814
Do you have Hazmat supply?

625
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:31,648
Yes.

626
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,984
Yeah, I'm sorry it's not better news.

627
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,086
But if your brother can share
any insight into this,

628
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,088
could you have him call me here?

629
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,224
And Jenna,
watch for symptoms in yourself.

630
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,060
'Cause over 1/3 of our staff
has already been hit.

631
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,666
Okay. Thanks, Debbie. Bye.

632
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,508
Kimi, did you finish
plugging all the WDC data

633
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:59,876
into the forecast model?

634
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,612
Yeah, last night. Still rendering.

635
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,148
Okay. Why is the government
coming to us?

636
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,185
We didn't do anything wrong.

637
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,519
Did we?

638
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,820
No. Of course not.

639
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:11,388
Look, uh, uh,

640
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,556
go check the battery backups
in the emergency generator.

641
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,859
Make sure they're online, set on auto.

642
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,304
Right.

643
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,731
Are we gonna lose power?

644
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,500
Uh, don't worry. We're covered.

645
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,503
We should be fine,
even if the public power grid goes down.

646
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:29,883
Again? How much this time?
The whole city?

647
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:34,220
No. The whole planet.

648
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,886
They're here.

649
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,217
Dr. Ward?
-Yes.

650
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,019
I'm General Railen.

651
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,655
This is Intel Director,
Dwight Thompson.

652
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,191
We'd like to discuss the information
you relayed to the folks

653
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,727
at the World Data Center
yesterday afternoon.

654
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,662
Absolutely. Follow me.

655
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,164
We didn't do it.
-Ethan.

656
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,266
Whatever it is.

657
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,337
Settle down, sonny.

658
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,440
Since yesterday morning,

659
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,142
there's been a steady registered increase
in radiation levels

660
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,510
on the planet's surface.

661
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,780
We are being bombarded with
gamma radiation from the sun, as usual.

662
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:15,218
But the amount getting through is,
uh, well, alarming.

663
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,854
Wait a minute.
You're talking about solar radiation?

664
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,858
I thought we had a security issue
with nuclear fallout.

665
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,227
Wha- uh, nuclear fallout?

666
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,628
Thank you, doctor.

667
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,597
Someone on staff
is going to get an earful

668
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:28,965
when we get back.

669
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,968
But, General. This isn't just
a solar radiation problem.

670
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,137
This is, it's much worse.

671
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,742
Please.

672
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,946
Nuclear gamma radiation contained
in the solar wind

673
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,881
is mostly deflected away from Earth

674
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,916
by the planet's
protective magnetic shield,

675
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,351
the magnetosphere.

676
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,920
Uh, now, that field is created
in the convection flows

677
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,756
of molten iron in the Earth's ore,

678
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,358
powered by the planet's rotation.

679
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,627
Doctor, we're not all physicists here.

680
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,363
What the hell are you talkin' about?

681
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,866
Our shield from the sun
is getting weaker

682
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:06,075
because the Earth's rotation
is getting slower.

683
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,407
We've already slowed the equivalent
of almost 6 hours.

684
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,541
How?

685
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,110
Well, we've been slowing naturally
for millennia.

686
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,912
I- just over the past century,

687
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,860
the Earth's magnetic field
has weakened by about 5%

688
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,887
But something's been triggered.
Something has put on the brakes.

689
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,924
What would cause that?

690
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,292
Uh, well, um, I don't, uh,

691
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,027
I don't have enough hard data to know.

692
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,629
Well, what's your theory?

693
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,864
You must have some idea.

694
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,633
General, I don't deal in guesswork.

695
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,102
Um, it's been suggested that

696
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,571
a disruption of the planet's
core field forces

697
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,706
could be caused
by a large magnetic incident

698
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:46,976
occurring near one of several key nodes
on the planetary grid.

699
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,115
What kind of incident?

700
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:52,615
An intense gravitational field
from a near-miss asteroid,

701
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:57,720
a massive meteor strike,
an electromagnetic pulse of some kind?

702
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,322
An EMP?

703
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,157
Like the one created
in a nuclear blast?

704
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,525
It's afar-fetched theory.

705
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,361
There is no hard evidence
to support that finding.

706
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:06,663
I don't know.

707
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:09,405
Doesn't sound too far-fetched to me.

708
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,102
All right. This office
and all of its contents

709
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:16,773
are now classified top secret
in the interest of national security.

710
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,208
The 3 of you will be given clearance

711
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,510
so you can continue
analyzing the situation.

712
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,046
But at no point will you communicate
any of your findings

713
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,747
to anyone outside of this room.

714
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,850
From now on, you report only to me.

715
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,017
Is that understood?

716
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,520
Just a minute. They don't work for you.

717
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,922
And if we're about to have
a major global crisis,

718
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,457
I- I don't want them stuck here
in the city.

719
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,693
They need to go home,
be with their families.

720
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,462
Oh, that's really sweet, doctor.
It really is.

721
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:42,065
But we don't have time
for those kind of niceties.

722
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,933
I need further analysis.

723
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:46,669
And I'm not going to spend my time
getting into a contest with you

724
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,238
to see which one of us
has got the bigger--

725
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,041
Okay. Okay, guys, that's okay.
We'll stay.

726
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,476
I don't know if you've noticed,

727
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,312
but, um,
this office kind of is our home

728
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,415
and if it all hits the fan,

729
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:03,086
there's no place
I'd rather be than here,

730
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,189
doing the work and,
and getting the facts right.

731
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,691
Yeah.

732
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,436
What she said.

733
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,299
Me too.

734
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,433
All right.

735
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,536
Finish rendering the forecast model.

736
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,574
Keep an eye
on anomalous magnetic readings.

737
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,683
We'll report to him.

738
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,414
Now Dr. Ward,

739
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,361
about this far-fetched theory,

740
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,722
where do I learn more?

741
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:54,470
Clinic?

742
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,905
Dr. Ward?

743
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,707
Kimi, is that you?
-Yeah.

744
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,375
You're going to have to speak up.
I can't hear you.

745
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,910
There's a lot of people here.

746
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,412
Um, I can't talk long.

747
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,981
I, um, your brother wanted me to call.

748
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,215
Is he all right?

749
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:07,417
Um, he's fine.

750
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,820
They, um,
they took him to find Dr. Barrett.

751
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,355
David? Well, who took him?

752
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,357
I'm not supposed to say.

753
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,225
Um, but your brother wanted me
to tell you

754
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,628
to stay indoors and not go anywhere,

755
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,496
and he will come get you
as soon as he can.

756
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,065
You need to tell me what's happening.

757
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,499
We have a lot of sick people here,

758
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,139
and I have to know
what the exposure's from.

759
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,674
Um, tu-na fish.

760
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:32,375
What?

761
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,116
Oh, okay, bye.

762
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:38,881
Okay, uh, who's next?

763
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,554
I am.

764
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,621
Who did you just call?

765
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,396
My cat.

766
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,325
Um, my friend,

767
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:50,960
who I'm gonna have feed my cat

768
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,737
because you're keeping us here.

769
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,163
Oh, this is. . .

770
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:20,632
definitely not good.

771
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,871
Gentlemen. We're currently waiting on
some satellite intel

772
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,079
due in at 03:00.

773
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,504
Sir. Stay inside.

774
00:44:58,629 --> 00:44:59,762
No, no, sir.

775
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,140
Come, come over here and just sit down.

776
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,271
Sit right there.

777
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,203
What happened?

778
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,672
We had another power outage.
Where's Melanie?

779
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:10,406
Uh, she stepped out.

780
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,542
She said, uh, her parents wired her
some money at the Corner Mart.

781
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,577
But, she came back.
She'll be here somewhere.

782
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:17,914
Okay, well, make sure they stay inside.
I'm gonna go find her.

783
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,291
Okay.

784
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,885
All right, everybody just relax.
There was a power outage.

785
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,388
Everything should be back to normal
in a minute.

786
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,973
Melanie?

787
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,476
Melanie?

788
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,250
Joe!

789
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,287
Joe, come quickly!

790
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,612
She's convulsing. Help me.

791
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,440
All right.
Let's get her to Exam Room One.

792
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,838
General.

793
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,266
Hello, David.

794
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,665
Dr. Barrett. I'm General Railen.

795
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,500
We have a situation.

796
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:45,768
Oh, I know you do.

797
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,371
We would have called first,
but you don't seem to have a phone.

798
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,941
So. Satellite communications,
cell phones, television,

799
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,876
they're the first to go,

800
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:58,247
as the radiation in the upper atmosphere
fries the satellite circuitry.

801
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,982
Eventually magnetic field fluctuations

802
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,652
will overpower the public power girds,
phone networks,

803
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,453
they'll go off-line as well.

804
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,656
We're here to figure this thing out.

805
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,625
You've published theories
on geo-magnetism.

806
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,394
Oh, you've read my book?

807
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,995
Well, no.
-Oh.

808
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,464
The point is, we need a crash course.

809
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,699
Well, why don't you ask Martin here?

810
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,267
He knows more about this stuff
than anyone.

811
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,368
More than me, even.

812
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,671
I can analyze what we know,
what's happening now.

813
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,573
They want to know
what might happen tomorrow.

814
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:26,209
Ah, ah. So, you come to see the,

815
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:31,347
the crazy geophysicist fortuneteller
with his doomsday scenario. Is that it?

816
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,816
David, your theories were
considered sensationalistic.

817
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:34,984
I mean, sure, they were popular.

818
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:37,820
But every scientist expressed doubts
about what you--

819
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:39,589
Yeah, especially you.

820
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,758
Oh, you couldn't wait to get in
your little sound bite, could you?

821
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,761
Position yourself with
the legitimate scientific community.

822
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,463
What was it?
What was it you call it again?

823
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:50,366
Uh, Geo-destiny is, uh, oh yeah.

824
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,835
Crystal ball science. Wasn't that it?

825
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:53,703
David.

826
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,371
I've got nothing to offer you here.

827
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,472
Dr. Barrett.

828
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,976
I don't give a damn what was
or wasn't said in the past.

829
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:02,511
We need your help right now.

830
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:06,048
I need to understand exactly
what you think might be happening

831
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,485
so I can advise
the President of the United States

832
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,624
how to fix it.

833
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,789
You people,
you people just don't get it, do you?

834
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,460
You can always break it,
but you can't fix it.

835
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,795
What was it this time? A nuclear blast?

836
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:21,130
Underground, right?

837
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,231
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

838
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,367
You okay? You all right?

839
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:28,213
All right, why don't you all come inside
before you cook your brains.

840
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,343
Take it easy, take it easy.

841
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:37,813
Magnetic poles, positive and negative
are like tips of a battery,

842
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:42,820
running right through
the center of this fruit, the Earth.

843
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,523
Now the charge flows between the poles,
creating the magnetosphere,

844
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:51,028
which protects us
from excess solar radiation.

845
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:54,908
By the way, that's what causes
the aurora borealis.

846
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,075
Northern lights?

847
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,769
Martin, did you explain anything
to these people?

848
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,904
Well, I did a computer simulation.

849
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:03,873
We were all out of tangerines.

850
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:09,645
But, slowed rotation weakens
the Earth's battery.

851
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,448
What happens when it gets weaker?

852
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:16,953
Well, the atmosphere gets spread out,
gets thinner, lets in more radiation.

853
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,521
Here, these, uh,
these pills will help you

854
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,189
with the nausea.
-Oh. Thanks.

855
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,826
And, the, uh,
Earth's magnetic field gets disordered.

856
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:24,794
How so?

857
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,696
Mm, magnetic anomalies start to pop up.

858
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:30,178
In theory, multiple North
and South poles.

859
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,568
What do you mean, multiple?

860
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,003
Well, 10, 20,

861
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:37,540
depends how long it goes on
before the Earth finally calls it quits.

862
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,019
What?

863
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:40,343
Well, that's your cue, Martin.

864
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,980
That's where you jump in,
tell them I'm all crazy. You know?

865
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,583
Your theory is based on a concept
that assumes that there are,

866
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:51,587
are definite nodal points
in certain global magnetic hotspots.

867
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:52,855
Completely unproven.

868
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:54,733
And yet,

869
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:57,660
magnetic anomalies have been recorded
at nodes

870
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,163
along the supposed planetary grid
for centuries.

871
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,698
Nodes?

872
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,668
Areas of marked
magnetic field fluctuations.

873
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,003
Go ahead.

874
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,574
Go on, David.

875
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,040
Tell her where these nodes are.

876
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,709
Machu Picchu, uh, the Great Pyramids,

877
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,312
Stonehenge, uh, the Bermuda Triangle.

878
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:17,646
Oh, that's right.

879
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,548
Turn away. Keep your calm.

880
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,785
You know, you didn't move out here
because the Earth was calling it quits.

881
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,020
You quit.

882
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,024
You resigned from life
and just gave up on everything.

883
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,833
And everybody.

884
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:36,267
Could someone explain to me
what this all means?

885
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,338
You really want to know what it means?

886
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,341
Yes!
-Well, I'll tell you.

887
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,014
Do you remember the dinosaurs?

888
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,657
Well, that's us.

889
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,090
There's not a bloody thing
you can do about it.

890
00:50:55,986 --> 00:51:00,122
Multiple magnetic poles would
disrupt existing electrical grids

891
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:04,326
and put intense pressure on fault lines
in the Earth's crust.

892
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:06,495
Earthquake activity would increase,

893
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,697
ion ore dust expelled
from the Earth's core

894
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:09,598
into the lower atmosphere,

895
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,201
these are, these are all indicators.

896
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,613
Indicators of what?

897
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,373
Well, go on, spit it out.

898
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,008
Don't hold it back.

899
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,386
A complete pole reversal.

900
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,179
A magnetic flip.

901
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,949
The flow inverts,
pushes the tectonic plates around,

902
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:30,431
literally turns the world
upside down.

903
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,722
Dr. Barrett, that can happen?

904
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,891
Happens all the time on the sun.

905
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:39,028
Every 11 years,
the sun reverses its magnetic field.

906
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,931
Happens less frequently here on Earth.

907
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,033
How much less frequently?

908
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:47,336
Well, the last polar flip was about

909
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,338
750,000 years ago.

910
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,876
So, we're about overdue.

911
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:19,902
Oh my God.

912
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,848
We gotta get outta here.

913
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,629
So much for North and South.

914
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,465
The weak field has knocked out
satellite communications.

915
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,667
But we should have
some short wave time left.

916
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,944
Please tell me
that was just a California earthquake.

917
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:59,009
The quake shook Tokyo
for about 30 seconds.

918
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:03,082
Emergency services will be mobilized
as soon as possible.

919
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,649
The earthquake was felt
throughout the Italian peninsula.

920
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,950
The preliminary reports from London

921
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,718
measured the quake at
7.2 on the Richter scale.

922
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,460
Well, General, not just California.

923
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,456
What's happening?

924
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,158
Chaos.

925
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,426
If the poles reverse,

926
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:19,728
the crust will separate
from the inner core.

927
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,731
The Atlantic floor will stretch
while the Pacific compresses.

928
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:26,475
Then the Earth's crust will slide.
Probably northwest.

929
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,806
I did read your book.

930
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,080
Slide.

931
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,611
How much? How far?

932
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:38,247
Well, General,
let's just say Hawaii could end up

933
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:41,388
close neighbors with the Arctic Circle.

934
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,073
Jenna.

935
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,207
I'm okay.

936
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,483
You sure?
-Yeah, check Melanie.

937
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,991
Come on.

938
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,869
Nothing.

939
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,544
I'm sorry Joe.

940
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,706
We did the best we could.

941
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,844
Oh, Melanie.

942
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,753
We gotta go check on the others.

943
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,882
Do we still have PB in Hazmat storage?

944
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,382
Prussian blue? What for?

945
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:49,985
Ah, we need to start with, 3 grams,

946
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:53,126
6 capsules orally every 8 hours.

947
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,863
We're dealing with
radiation poisoning here, Joe.

948
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,520
Put it up here.

949
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,322
Put it up here, let me see.

950
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,690
That, that's where it hurts,
right there?

951
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,258
That's a very small break.

952
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,093
Just hold it against yourself like that.

953
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,661
Try not to move it too much, all right?

954
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,862
Dr. Jenna?

955
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,831
Al. Are you all right?

956
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,034
I will be fine. I will resist this.
It's the thing.

957
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,904
That's right.
You said that you felt it inside,

958
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,039
that, that you felt it.

959
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,646
That's why your chemo
and your radiation didn't work.

960
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,922
It is what you would call ironic, huh?

961
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,516
The thing that condemns me saves me.

962
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,018
I know.

963
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,420
But there is a balance to it, huh?

964
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,456
Like nature.

965
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,191
The Earth.

966
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,294
Everything wants to be in balance.

967
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:08,139
We think we can control everything.

968
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,467
But the world does not need our help
to survive.

969
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:14,448
I think I may need a little help though.

970
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,547
I'm not going anywhere.

971
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,353
Come.

972
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,084
I need to get back to Washington.

973
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,753
To advise the President.

974
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:33,922
Flights are grounded.
There's no GPS, no air-traffic control.

975
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,591
Most communications are down.

976
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,593
We are cut off out here.

977
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,835
I have to do something.

978
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:42,200
General, nothing can be done.

979
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:45,803
With a polar reversal,
the planet will die.

980
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:49,211
Then the battery will recharge and

981
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,150
maybe life will begin again.

982
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,411
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

983
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,546
What if the pole reversal fails?

984
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:58,947
Fails?

985
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,916
Yeah, maybe, maybe I've been
looking at this all wrong.

986
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,951
Maybe I've been
making all the wrong assumptions.

987
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:04,430
How?

988
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,488
Well, what if,

989
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,924
what if all the damage
to our magnetic fields

990
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,559
has been cumulative?

991
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,061
If every nation who's ever detonated
a nuclear device or-

992
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:16,732
or created high EM fields
has brought us to this point?

993
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:20,035
And the recent detonation
was just the last straw?

994
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:20,869
Yes.

995
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,505
Now maybe the more we disrupt
the Earth's magnetic fields,

996
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,174
the more anomalies are thrown off.

997
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:28,644
Now what if those magnetic anomalies
are not in reaction to the disruption,

998
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:30,913
but in response to it?

999
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,214
What do you mean?

1000
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,248
Multiple poles.

1001
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:36,889
What, what if they're not the cause,
but the cure?

1002
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,556
Creating multiple poles
could be the Earth's way of,

1003
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:43,559
of trying to stabilize
the damaged magnetic fields.

1004
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:47,098
Like, like the Earth trying to
fix itself.

1005
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,905
Another theory.

1006
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,034
Yes.

1007
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:55,482
And one I don't have any facts
to back up.

1008
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,253
It's okay. Sometimes you just
got to go with hope.

1009
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:03,445
So you mean that this could all stop?

1010
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:04,813
Yeah, maybe.

1011
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:08,150
If, if we give the Earth a chance
to recover.

1012
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,618
But, any disruption right now,

1013
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,387
I mean, no matter how small,
could just push us over the edge.

1014
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:16,124
And, and then there's no coming back.

1015
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:19,629
You're not planning
any nuclear explosions are you?

1016
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:26,205
Oh, no.

1017
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,524
We gotta go.

1018
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,192
Pull the blocks, Corporal.

1019
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,671
Yes, sir.

1020
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,467
System check.

1021
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,499
Let's go. Move, move, move!

1022
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,172
We are clear.

1023
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,771
Okay, Connors, Jannick.
She's prepped and ready to go.

1024
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,512
Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

1025
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,152
Let's do it.

1026
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:08,377
See you on the other side.

1027
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,084
You got it, buddy.

1028
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,826
Systems are clear, sir.

1029
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,522
Let's go.

1030
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,093
Strap 'em in.

1031
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,160
Here you go, sir.

1032
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,876
Clear now.

1033
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,171
Lock 'em down. Pull those hoses.

1034
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,973
Let's move her. Roll her out.

1035
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,475
Let's go.

1036
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:40,709
Yes, sir.

1037
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,120
Clear.

1038
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:47,349
Engine power up complete.

1039
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,295
Open hanger doors.

1040
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,526
Bomber One.

1041
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,735
You are cleared for takeoff
on Runway 3.

1042
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:04,600
Roger that, Control.

1043
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,808
Proceeding to Runway 3.

1044
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:18,747
Bomber One.

1045
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:21,353
Initiate auxiliary com channels.

1046
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,657
Auxiliary com engaged.

1047
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:14,269
We should be able to
find a hard line phone in town.

1048
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,170
Will it still work?

1049
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,239
Anything short wave or higher
will be toast.

1050
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,642
The major magnetic shift
will overwhelm the circuits here.

1051
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,878
I'd say we got maybe about an hour or so

1052
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,847
before all network phone lines go down.

1053
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,382
How far to the town?

1054
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,453
Uh, about an hour or so.

1055
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:32,323
Keep up with him.
-General.

1056
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,547
Ma'am, you okay?

1057
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,981
There you go.

1058
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,426
There you go.

1059
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,536
Are you okay?

1060
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,138
I think my leg's broken.

1061
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:24,811
Give me a hand here.

1062
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,254
Ah. Don't answer that.

1063
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,015
Hey, sir.

1064
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,257
Here. Let me help you.

1065
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,423
Wait.

1066
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,024
All right, you can get it.

1067
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,596
But no more cat stories, understood?

1068
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:49,372
Okay. Here we go.

1069
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,238
Hello?

1070
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,908
There we go, sir. There we go.

1071
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:03,647
The President would like
to speak with you.

1072
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,968
Mr. President.

1073
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:22,670
General Railen is trying to
determine the cause, but. . .

1074
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,167
A nuclear strike?

1075
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,101
Mr. President,

1076
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:29,742
the intel on the uranium enrichment
hasn't changed.

1077
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:33,319
No. They- they didn't build them.
They bought them.

1078
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,620
Mr. President?

1079
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:46,998
What's it doin' now?

1080
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,131
Mr. President?

1081
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,503
What's happening here?

1082
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,375
Everything he said.

1083
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,033
Mr. President?

1084
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,501
Director Thompson.

1085
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,070
President's transferring
to the war room now.

1086
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,972
You and General Railen
get back to Washington.

1087
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:07,242
We might need your expertise
at some point in this process.

1088
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,411
McNeil, you've got to hold off.

1089
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,279
What's happening now,

1090
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,816
all of the quakes worldwide,
the radiation,

1091
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,452
it may have all been triggered
by that first blast.

1092
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,921
We need more time to figure this out.

1093
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:21,523
More time again?

1094
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:25,403
You people won't be satisfied
/til they detonate a device stateside.

1095
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,630
This isn't just about Iran, McNeil.

1096
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,932
You could be jeopardizing
the entire planet.

1097
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,834
Millions of innocent civilians.

1098
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:35,103
This is about protecting
American civilians.

1099
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,839
We're sending Iran a message
they will hear loud and clear.

1100
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,253
The bomber will be over the target
in 2 hours.

1101
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,584
McNeil, you-- McNeil!

1102
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,999
That's definitely not good.

1103
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,313
Damn it. We're too late.

1104
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,414
The phone lines are damaged.

1105
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,083
Are you sure the President
will authorize this strike?

1106
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,420
If I can't get through,
he'll go with McNeil's recommendation.

1107
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,955
Oh, McNeil.

1108
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:30,562
He's been itching for a fight
since his son was killed in Iraq.

1109
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:32,836
Well, that's it, then.

1110
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,631
I need the keys.

1111
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,266
Where are you going?

1112
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,901
When the shift starts,
the city will crumble.

1113
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,236
All these little quakes leading up to it

1114
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,081
will seem like a pat on the back
by comparison.

1115
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:46,515
I told my sister I'd come for her.

1116
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,177
I'll- I'll come with you.

1117
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:50,656
What?

1118
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,247
Good.

1119
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,516
You just said it was over.
What's the point?

1120
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,151
You can't go in there.

1121
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:57,719
Here son, take mine.

1122
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,563
Oh, thanks Dad.

1123
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,634
They can't save her.

1124
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,808
They're not gonna save her.

1125
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,712
They're gonna die with her.

1126
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:22,978
And I, Madame,
am gonna spend some time

1127
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,714
in the arms of an angel.

1128
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:31,164
And when I explain to her
the end of the world scenario,

1129
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:39,498
I expect to gain her affections
for as much time as we may have left.

1130
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,533
Cheerio.

1131
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,006
All right, where do we go now, Marty?

1132
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:25,907
Uh, just go straight ahead.

1133
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:28,888
We'll pass the office,
get Kimi and Ethan out of there.

1134
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:33,415
All hopeful theories aside,

1135
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,550
how much time do we really have
before the whole thing gives?

1136
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,885
Based on what?

1137
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,187
Radiation saturation?
Intervals between quakes?

1138
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,822
I mean, I got nothing
to compare this to, Marty.

1139
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:42,757
I- I wouldn't want to hazard a guess.

1140
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:44,760
Gut instinct. How long?

1141
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:48,167
Are you saying you want me to use
crystal ball science now?

1142
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,332
David, I'm, I'm sorry
I didn't support you

1143
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,074
when the critics started
tearing you down.

1144
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,271
I thought your theories were amazing.

1145
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:59,174
Yeah, but they were light on facts,
you're right about that.

1146
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,848
Yeah, true, but,

1147
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,156
only one fact should have mattered.

1148
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:06,948
You were my friend.

1149
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:07,982
That should have been enough for me,

1150
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:11,828
even if I couldn't wrap my mind
around all your ideas.

1151
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:15,192
But I always admired you
the way you could just

1152
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,525
sense the truth about things,

1153
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:18,960
and make a leap of faith.

1154
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:20,095
Ah, leap of faith¡¦s easy you

1155
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:23,064
when you got someone there
to catch you when you fall.

1156
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:26,876
Jenna, she was always there to catch me.

1157
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:32,551
But I gave up and ran away,
just lost hope and gave up.

1158
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,582
Just hope we're not too late.

1159
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,817
She still loves you, you know.

1160
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:41,519
I can't imagine why.

1161
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:44,124
Don't ask me.

1162
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:46,763
Whoa!

1163
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,425
Kimi? Ethan?

1164
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:25,426
Dr. Ward?

1165
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,338
There's one over here.

1166
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,400
Ah, he didn't make it.

1167
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,068
How's Kimi? Is she all right?

1168
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:34,669
You okay?

1169
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,939
The magnetic poles, they were,
they were everywhere on the model.

1170
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,408
It was like this big,
swirling magnetic field.

1171
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,977
It was like they were trying to
balance themselves.

1172
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:44,479
It was amazing.

1173
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,857
She sounds about normal.

1174
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,419
Wait, there's someone over here.

1175
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,021
I think he's still alive.

1176
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,557
Careful.

1177
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:57,692
It's all right. It's all right,
let's get you out of here.

1178
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,661
Come on.
-Oh, oh, oh, God.

1179
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:01,095
No. No, don't.

1180
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:02,870
I'm- I'm done.

1181
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:07,740
Tell General Railen that the President,

1182
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:15,280
that McNeil is planning
a nuclear strike in one hour.

1183
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:23,718
Are- are you, are you Dr. Barrett?

1184
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,186
Yes, yes, I am.

1185
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:29,857
Sorry we couldn't meet
under better circumstances.

1186
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:33,862
Maybe, maybe next time around.

1187
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:45,418
Oh my God, Ethan.

1188
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,755
Oh, God.

1189
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,356
Come on, we better go.

1190
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:57,057
Oh, God.

1191
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,719
Would you ask her
if something hit her on the head?

1192
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:24,318
We have to get out.

1193
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,014
Joe, are you all right?

1194
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,448
You look a little pale.

1195
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:29,155
Am I okay?

1196
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,019
We got no power, we got no phone.

1197
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,454
We got nothing left to do here.
We have to get out now.

1198
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,455
No.

1199
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,990
Just come on.
-No, come here, come here, come here.

1200
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:36,958
Talk to me for a second.

1201
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,293
We have to help these people.
Look at these--

1202
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,795
The hell with them, Jenna.
The hell with them.

1203
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,530
We're done.
We can't help them anymore.

1204
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:43,464
We have to start
thinking about ourselves.

1205
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,533
No. You can't leave Joe.
You can't even go outside.

1206
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,735
The- the prolonged exposure to--
-Look, we're not gonna get rescued.

1207
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:49,437
We're on our own. Nobody's coming.

1208
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:50,705
My brother is coming.

1209
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,206
Your brother's already dead.
You're coming with me.

1210
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,575
Come on. Come on.
-Hey, hey, let go.

1211
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:55,276
Let go of my arm.
-Come on.

1212
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:57,688
You're not going anywhere, Doctor.

1213
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,882
You can go if you want.

1214
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,266
All right, fine.

1215
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:09,366
But I'm afraid it won't be for long.

1216
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,409
Don't worry. Your brother will come.

1217
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:40,888
Careful. Here.

1218
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:43,027
Here ya go.

1219
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,142
Sir?

1220
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,234
Sorry for the delay, gentlemen.

1221
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:54,669
I wasn't quite myself.

1222
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,740
I blame the radiation.

1223
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,816
Ah. Well, yeah, well,
I guess that works for me.

1224
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,312
Hey, what a team, huh?

1225
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:05,980
Yeah.

1226
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,449
Listen, I'm afraid Thompson's dead.

1227
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,317
But he managed to tell us

1228
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,686
a nuclear strike
has been ordered already.

1229
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:14,088
I don't know.
We got maybe 30 minutes.

1230
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:15,957
30 minutes.

1231
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,529
All right. We have to formulate a plan.

1232
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,162
The White House War Room
has an old Telex machine.

1233
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,898
It isn't in use anymore,
but it would be monitored in the event

1234
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:27,068
that satellite and conventional
communication channels are down.

1235
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:30,171
If I could get to a telegraph station,
one with a shielded hard-line,

1236
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:32,774
I may be able to get a message
straight through to the President.

1237
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:35,376
Yeah, some place that, uh,
that wires money transfers.

1238
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:36,344
Perfect.

1239
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:39,013
There's a, there's a place
in the Corner Mart by Jenna's clinic.

1240
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:41,516
That's it, let's go. Lead the way.

1241
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,470
Let's go.

1242
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,185
Central Command,
we are leaving neutral airspace,

1243
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,825
time to target is 20 minutes.

1244
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,892
Cut the lock. Let's go.

1245
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,667
Move it, boys.

1246
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,706
Ready.

1247
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:54,048
See what kind of backup battery power
they have to tie in.

1248
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:59,521
We can, um, bypass the transformer
and wire D.C. straight through.

1249
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:01,789
Uh, get the battery out of the SUV. Go!
-Yes, Ma'am.

1250
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:04,964
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

1251
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,339
Got it.

1252
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:23,714
I would have liked to have
gone back to Mexico.

1253
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:30,252
The truth is, I'm the one that left.

1254
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:35,890
I never told my daughter
about my cancer,

1255
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,961
that I was dying.

1256
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,203
'Cause she would have never gone.

1257
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:46,040
It's hard to leave someone
you love very much.

1258
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,108
Still,

1259
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:52,647
I would have loved to
have seen her again.

1260
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,255
You will, Al.

1261
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:59,415
If we get out of this, you will.
I promise.

1262
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,150
Jenna?

1263
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,483
Jenna!
-Jenna?

1264
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:05,624
I'm here.
-J- Jenna. I'm here.

1265
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:07,555
Are you okay?
-Yeah, are you?

1266
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:09,156
Yeah. Okay.

1267
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:11,258
Oh, oh, Jenna, I'm sorry.

1268
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,127
I'm sorry it took me so long.

1269
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,595
It's good to see you.

1270
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:16,330
Of course you didn't have to
do all of this to impress me.

1271
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:18,532
Well, I'm afraid some of us
just aren't naturally charming.

1272
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:21,202
I, uh, we need props.

1273
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,204
I always knew
we'd be together in the end.

1274
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,339
I didn't think it was actually
gonna be the end.

1275
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,508
Well, let's just see
if we can't do something about that, huh?

1276
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,283
Come on, let's get out of here.

1277
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,554
Ha-ha, that's it, we're good to go!

1278
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,384
So, any luck?

1279
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,753
We only have a couple of minutes
of power for this to work.

1280
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:41,825
That's okay, we may only have
a couple minutes left anyway.

1281
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,024
All right, we're getting something.

1282
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:46,193
Authorization code accepted.
Please identify.

1283
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:47,828
General Railen.

1284
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:50,264
You a General?
I never met a General before.

1285
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:50,898
Al.

1286
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,234
We are locked down for tactical strike.

1287
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:55,236
T minus 3 minutes.
-Oh, oh. No.

1288
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:57,071
Hurry, this won't last long.

1289
01:17:57,072 --> 01:18:00,441
Must advise against strike.

1290
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:01,776
Planet at risk.

1291
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,244
She needs time to heal.

1292
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:04,311
Al.

1293
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:07,181
You said before you lost power,
the model was stabilizing?

1294
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,149
I think so.

1295
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,951
I'm, the field was chaotic
but balanced, and,

1296
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:14,055
and rotation had stopped decelerating.

1297
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:17,093
Come on, come on,
why is this taking so long?

1298
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,627
What- who are you all talking to?

1299
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:22,063
Oh, here it comes.
This is the President.

1300
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:23,264
Can I meet him too?

1301
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:23,998
Al.

1302
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,400
Proceeding on McNeil's recommendation.

1303
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:32,214
No. McNeil does not have all the facts.

1304
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:35,983
I don't think he would care
even if he did.

1305
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,146
We're losing it.

1306
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:40,247
How much time?

1307
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,227
Not enough.

1308
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,994
It's fading.
-Okay, all right.

1309
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:46,854
Here, how's that?

1310
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:47,822
Well, it's coming through.

1311
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,691
It's okay.
What, he wants to know what facts.

1312
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:52,093
What facts?

1313
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:54,361
We don't have all the facts ourselves.

1314
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:57,365
Leap of faith, David.
You know the truth.

1315
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,468
Yeah, General, may I?

1316
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:01,970
Thank you.

1317
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:34,902
Can someone read this one too?

1318
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:37,280
I- I- I lost my glasses.

1319
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,390
End target is in range.

1320
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:57,191
Negative, Bomber One,

1321
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,226
you are to abort your mission
and return to base.

1322
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:02,129
Repeat, abort your mission
and return to base.

1323
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,764
Roger that. Standing down.

1324
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:05,505
Returning to base.

1325
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:22,661
Bomber standing down.

1326
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:28,189
Congratulations General.

1327
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,291
Well done, well done.

1328
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:31,827
You okay.

1329
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:35,439
Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

1330
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,769
Hey.

1331
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,915
Come on.
-Hey, how about me?

1332
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,020
Yeah. We did it.
-I think so.

1333
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,743
Listen, I don't know
if you all have any plans,

1334
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:52,479
but I say we deserve a nice vacation.

1335
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,584
And I know just where to go.

1336
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,812
Hello.
-Hi Sweetie.

1337
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,510
Ah, hello. How are you?

1338
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:25,079
See, Ellenita.

1339
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,314
She's beautiful. Ellenita?
-Sí. Ellenita, yeah.

1340
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:31,585
Oh, she's beautiful.
-Sí. Yeah.

1341
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,690
Her daughter. My daughter.

1342
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:36,333
Bye, bye.
-Bye.

1343
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:49,270
So, I've been working on this theory

1344
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:52,473
about the multiple pole
anomaly stabilization

1345
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:53,941
of the magnetosphere.

1346
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,716
You have?

1347
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:58,913
You got all your facts together already?

1348
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,415
No.

1349
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:05,391
This is more of a, uh,
gut instinct theory.

1350
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:07,554
Really?

1351
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:11,025
Ha. Wow. In that case I can't wait.

1352
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:13,005
What do you got?

1353
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:20,404
I figure maybe somebody thought
we all deserved a second chance.

1354
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:26,300
Subtitles: Arigon

1355
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,453
Yeah, I'll buy that.

1356
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,248
Ah, it's really too bad
about your father, though.

1357
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:36,490
He would have enjoyed this trip.

1358
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:45,501
No, I rather think he's enjoying himself
right where he is.

1359
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:52,338
Yes, I have the whole place to myself.

1360
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:56,704
And when the sun set behind those trees,

1361
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:58,739
it is a sight to see.

1362
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,841
It's so beautiful.

1363
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:01,775
Well, the cabin's not much,

1364
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:04,478
but it's better than a slap in the face
with a wet kipper

1365
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:05,813
if you know what I mean.

1366
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,691
No, I don't.

1367
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:13,421
But in physics,
one law remains the same.

1368
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:17,627
Opposites do attract.
