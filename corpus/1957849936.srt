00:00:31,077 --> 00:00:33,709

♪ Gettin' lit ♪

00:05:00,964 --> 00:05:05,964
(door slams)
(quirky music)

8
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,730
- God, I had to weirdest driver.

9
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,320
He heard the bottles in my bag

10
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,477
and he was like, "You're not 21 yet!"

11
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:19,310
"You're not old enough
to be drunk in my car."

12
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,037
And so I got my passport
out, I'm like, "Look!

13
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:24,820
"1995, 23, eat it, weep."

14
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,670
- You just attract the
strangest people, don't you?

15
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,160
- [Escort] I do, and
it's always about my age,

16
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,957
I swear to you, anyways.

17
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,974
- That actually remind me,
are you, are you 23 or?

18
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:35,307
- [Escort] Yeah.

19
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,553
- You're not fuckin' with me?

20
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,273
You're disgusting.

21
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:43,563
- This is true, this is true.

22
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,037
- That's what I like about you, though.

23
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:52,474
(suspenseful music)

24
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:55,224
(sirens wailing)

25
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,183
I didn't used to feel bad about it.

26
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,960
I mean, hell, so many men do it.

27
00:06:07,795 --> 00:06:09,258
I mean, married men, single men.

28
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:12,150
It just, I didn't think anything of it.

29
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,890
It was, it was people in
position, in my field,

30
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,341
guys that I worked with talking
about, you know escorts.

31
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:21,480
(couple panting)
And just, it just,

32
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,920
it wasn't a big deal.

33
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,080
It was like going to Vegas,

34
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,130
puttin', puttin' 10 grand
down on the craps table.

35
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,283
Wasn't a big deal, it was a commodity.

36
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,683
- Adorable?

37
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,830
Like your daughter?

38
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,817
(customer sighs)

39
00:06:56,776 --> 00:07:01,101
- (sighs) God, it's funny sometimes.

40
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,184
- Then why'd you call me?

41
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,093
- Stressed. (groans)

42
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:15,316
(sighs) My work, my family,
surrounded by (scoffs)

43
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,113
mediocrity and oh, my god.

44
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,040
- Hmm, I think what's wrong

45
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,140
is staying somewhere where you're unhappy.

46
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,364
Are you happy when you come here?

47
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,197
When you see me?

48
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,419
(customer sighs)

49
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,020
(escort moans lightly)

50
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,420
What are you thinkin' about?

51
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:46,100
- Gah, just dealing with
a fucking idiot at work

52
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,990
and dealing with my kids, my (sighs)

53
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,360
my wife is up my ass and it's just...

54
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,363
How old are you?

55
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,560
I feel like after all this time,

56
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,660
I, I still don't even know your real name.

57
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,693
Wow, just shut the door on me like that.

58
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,907
(murmuring)

59
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,092
Does it matter?
- Mm-mm.

60
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:29,080
I'm sorry.

61
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:33,881
- Do you really care?

62
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:39,926
(tense music drowns out speech)

63
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:48,515
(seagulls squawking)
(water splashing)

64
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,400
- Um, then I decided to take it further

65
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,460
and meet with some of the people in person

66
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,980
and do, like sugar-babying,
the girlfriend experience,

67
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,610
so it didn't always start
off as, as putting on a wig

68
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,300
and going to meet some guy in hotel.

69
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,407
It was more having relationships
with these men and,

70
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,920
and seeing where it could go and,

71
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,580
and then a lot of weird
people, a lot of mean people,

72
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,683
I got into some hairy situations.

73
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,700
Erm, but I've met a lot of sad people too.

74
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,890
And a lot of lonely ones.

75
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,723
No, I don't think you're pathetic.

76
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,733
Maybe sad or bored.

77
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,846
(tense music)

78
00:09:44,846 --> 00:09:47,820
- (sighs) It's gone into the
level of absurd at this point.

79
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,653
It's.

80
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:51,068
- It's okay.

81
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,763
That's why I'm here to help. (giggles)

82
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,323
It's your time.

83
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:06,063
Making me sad.

84
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,919
(customer snorts)

85
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,948
I'm really sorry.

86
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:15,426
- Yeah?
- Really, really sorry.

87
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:16,843
I'm really sorry.

88
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,980
- I feel like after all this time

89
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,930
I still don't even know your real name.

90
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:39,110
- Um, I don't think he's a bad person.

91
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,030
No, I don't, I don't
think it's inherently bad

92
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,863
to pay for sex or to be paid for it.

93
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,290
But it's not something I wanna
do for the rest of my life.

94
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,453
It's not something I'm passion about.

95
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,433
Um.

96
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,900
I can see parts of what I'm
passionate about in this,

97
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,300
that I like getting dressed up,

98
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,870
that I like playing another person,

99
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,970
but I don't like taking
from another person

100
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,433
or, or feeling like I'm manipulating them.

101
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:14,960
- I mean, yeah, it's, it's,
it's shitty to, you know,

102
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,350
treat my family that way,
treat my wife that way,

103
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,400
but if I'm honest with myself, I,

104
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,180
I should never have married her anyway.

105
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,210
I mean, I, I created this whole life,

106
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,830
I created this whole rat-race lifestyle,

107
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,670
what, what I thought I had to do.

108
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,137
Everyone was telling me
"Oh, this is the girl

109
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:34,787
"you should marry, this
is where you should live,

110
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:36,457
"you should have, have two and half kids

111
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:37,820
"and the nuclear family and all that."

112
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,120
I didn't want any of that.

113
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,043
I did want any of it.

114
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,863
- Yeah.

115
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,253
Just bullshit, nothin' to
look forward to or you know?

116
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:53,997
(light, playful music)

117
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,207
Can you back it up or are you just stuck?

118
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:11,280
(unsettling music)

119
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,393
Sorry.

120
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:29,420
If you want, erm, I can
give you something else

121
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,910
to think about or you know? (giggles)

122
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,363
I don't know, er, why'd you call me then?

123
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:10,909
That's okay too, we
don't have to get to it.

124
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:12,576
We'll just hang out.

125
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,733
Okay.

126
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,620
- And so I rationalized why it was okay

127
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,470
that I was doing what I was doing.

128
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,303
It wasn't my fault.

129
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:33,303
I, I victimized myself.

130
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,493
Who the fuck am I, all right?

131
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,113
I pull in 200K a year, who the fuck am I?

132
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:48,080
(grunts)

133
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,093
It's despicable.

134
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,640
I know it's despicable, it's disgusting,

135
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,603
it's vile, it's heinous.

136
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,813
But it's what I know that I deserve.

137
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,718
(sighs)

138
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,703
I just.

139
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:10,760
Fuck, I don't even know anymore,

140
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,222
I just don't know, I
just don't know, I just.

141
00:14:14,222 --> 00:14:16,722
(tense music)

142
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:19,825
I know I'm goin' to hell.

143
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,860
I'm not a good person,
no matter what she says.

144
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,583
She doesn't know me.

145
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,483
But I know her.

146
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,743
Yeah, I know who she really is.

147
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,703
She's just scared girl,
runnin' from her past.

148
00:14:48,745 --> 00:14:51,027
- (giggles) Are we, are we praying now?

149
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:53,563
You wanna? (chuckles)

150
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:57,760
(customer groans)

151
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Now I lay me down to sleep,
if I should die before I wake,

152
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:07,003
I pray the Lord my soul to keep. (giggles)

153
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:08,086
- Oh, my God.

154
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,958
(escort giggles)
(customer sighs)

155
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,695
This is so bad.
(escort moans lightly)

156
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:17,695
- Um.
- Oh, gosh, so bad.

157
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:23,450
- We can feel bad together, I like that.

158
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,730
Your watch is broken.

159
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,183
- (sighs) Like everything else in my life.

160
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,536
- You're not broken.

161
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:35,165
- You don't even know me.

162
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:37,977
- I know you're not broken.

163
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:39,923
Broken people aren't this nice.

164
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:43,519
- Says the little porcelain doll.

165
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,352
- (moans) Uh-huh.

166
00:15:52,229 --> 00:15:56,813
(escort moans softly)
(both giggling)

167
00:15:56,813 --> 00:16:01,336
- [Customer] (grunts) What are we doin'?

168
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,586
- I don't know.

169
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:05,083
I don't wanna stop though.

170
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,423
(both sighing)

171
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:10,723
(clicks tongue) I'm bored.

172
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:14,705
(customer chuckles)

173
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:15,780
- [Customer] God, you
have the attention span

174
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,000
of a squirrel, don't you?

175
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,013
- This is true, what I do, man?

176
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,557
- Can we just (sighs) just talk?

177
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,083
- (clicks tongue) Okay.

178
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:31,241
Do have anything good?

179
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:35,223
Any fun facts, any gossip, tea to spill?

180
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:40,211
- (sighs) Uh, erm.

181
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,310
Why do I feel that I can
tell you all this stuff?

182
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,143
I just.

183
00:16:46,062 --> 00:16:47,000
- I don't know.

184
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
- Some stranger in life, you're
like this little red siren.

185
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:55,360
(escort giggles)

186
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,513
- I'm a good secret-keeper, honest.

187
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:00,853
(customer sighs)
Mm-hm.

188
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,859
Now I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored!

189
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:08,760
What are we doin'?

190
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,119
Let's so somethin'.

191
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:14,319
(customer sighs)
(tense music)

192
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,586
- [Customer] What do you care?

193
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:18,530
- I care that people
are havin' a good time

194
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,186
when I'm them or that I'm
having a good time, sometimes.

195
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:25,936
(dramatic music)

196
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:33,346
- What'd you want from your life?

197
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,179
- Hmm.

198
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,023
To be old and have a really
nice house and my cat.

199
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:43,288
- [Customer] What about all
the stuff in between, though?

200
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,640
- I don't know, if I get it, I get it.

201
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,850
Um, that's it.

202
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,863
Um, I dunno if I wanna
family, if I want all that.

203
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,300
Just know that I wanna
be comfortable and happy.

204
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,810
- Maybe be a better man.

205
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,953
Maybe.

206
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:09,770
I think I can do that.

207
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,090
- You seem like, like a really nice guy.

208
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,190
So why are you here?

209
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,340
Why are you doing this?

210
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,340
- I'm not a nice guy.
(tense music)

211
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,340
You just see me here, in this
room, for a couple of hours.

212
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,947
I've done some heinous things.

213
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:38,459
Unquestionable things and.

214
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:50,412
(groans) I think I call you

215
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:58,390
because I think that
maybe if I get involved

216
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,963
with someone else's life,
someone that needs help,

217
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,570
that I can make up for all
of the fucked-up things

218
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,403
that I've done.

219
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,693
That's just not true.

220
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,440
- You know, when you have
money, life's a little easier.

221
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,923
And, you know, I feel safe with you, I do.

222
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:23,393
(suspenseful music)

223
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,333
- You feel safe with me?

224
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,843
Why?

225
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,000
- I don't know, I just
like being with you,

226
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,660
I like it when you call me,
I like sleepin' next to you.

227
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,933
I usually don't do that.

228
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,023
Just feels, feels kinda good.

229
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,000
Some guys are really weird or really mean

230
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,923
and I like that you don't
have any of those things.

231
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,733
And you'd never hurt me.
- I find that really odd.

232
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,523
You're not making this easy.

233
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,820
I thought this would make my life easier

234
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,820
but you're just, you're making
this really difficult, um.

235
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,300
- And I feel badly.

236
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,010
A lot of these men, you know
they don't just call me for sex

237
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,660
or for the physical side of things

238
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,950
but they want someone to talk to,

239
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,970
someone to be there with them,

240
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,630
just someone to fall asleep next to,

241
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,383
um, so it's not, it's not
always a sexual thing.

242
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:40,867
Sometimes it's really
beautiful and sad, too.

243
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,377
(intense music)

244
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,220
- Maybe I just thought that I could find

245
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,543
who I really am with somebody else.

246
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,780
I still don't know.

247
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,120
It's not you.
- The hair's not me,

248
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,400
but it's me, you know?

249
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,233
It's fun.

250
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:18,517
- It may be fun but I
wanna see the real you.

251
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,983
- No, the wig, the wig's better, yeah.

252
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:29,766
- [Customer] What are you afraid of?

253
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:33,099
- (sighs) I don't know.

254
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:35,823
Why you gettin' on serious on me?

255
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,540
It doesn't have to be that way.

256
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,110
- 'Cause in some fucked-up way

257
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,170
I feel like have to help you

258
00:23:51,103 --> 00:23:53,940
- No.
- Because there's nothing

259
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,600
in my life, there's
nothing, of all the shit,

260
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,753
there's nothing that I'm proud of.

261
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,160
- No, see you call it "shit"

262
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,333
but I don't, I don't think it's shit.

263
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,163
I think you have a family,
you have a good job,

264
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,870
it's somethin', you can make
something with that, you know?

265
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,560
- To you, you see all the
material things that I have

266
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,270
and you think oh, that's success

267
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:28,249
but it's all bullshit.

268
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:29,082
- Hm.

269
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,747
I think a family is success, you know?

270
00:24:31,747 --> 00:24:33,463
You made something, someone.

271
00:24:35,248 --> 00:24:36,081
And that means something,

272
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:38,303
even if the person
doesn't see you anymore.

273
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,470
- [Customer] I made something
with the wrong someone.

274
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,820
You have no idea what
that feels like, do you?

275
00:24:50,093 --> 00:24:51,783
- (sighs) Not really.

276
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:54,834
- Why?

277
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,670
Why do you trust me?

278
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:02,450
- (moans softly) Just have a good feeling.

279
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,730
You're not mean or weird, really.

280
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,939
- Says you.
- (giggles) Yeah, says me.

281
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:13,283
- Yeah, you have no fucking idea who I am.

282
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,624
You know that, yeah?
- Yeah.

283
00:25:16,624 --> 00:25:19,791
- And I'm not gonna just throttle you?

284
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,310
- I have a good feeling.

285
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,263
- Could break your neck if I wanted to.

286
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:31,009
Look, I could snap your arm.

287
00:25:35,342 --> 00:25:40,342
(sighs) (tuts) You don't
know what I'm capable of.

288
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:45,644
- [Escort] Show me.

289
00:25:48,394 --> 00:25:50,431
(moaning)

290
00:25:50,431 --> 00:25:55,311
- Show you. (sighs)

291
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:56,144
Fuck.

292
00:26:01,197 --> 00:26:05,854
Why don't you just show me
who you really are, huh?

293
00:26:05,854 --> 00:26:08,299
Well, why don't you just?
- No, no, no, no, no.

294
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:09,216
- Why?
- No.

295
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,306
- Why, why, why the, why this?

296
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:16,926
Why, why, why the stockings,
why the wig, why everything?

297
00:26:16,926 --> 00:26:18,754
Why can you just be you?
- I like it.

298
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:22,750
I'm not being me right
now, I'm being Clarissa.

299
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,850
- But I wanna see you.

300
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,983
- Sorry.

301
00:26:29,106 --> 00:26:31,053
This is what you get.

302
00:26:31,053 --> 00:26:32,423
I think it's pretty good.

303
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:36,133
- (sighs) I want what's real.

304
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,453
I know this started as,
as a fantasy and all the,

305
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,690
all the smoke and mirror and the bullshit

306
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,560
but if you trust me,
if I'm, I'm this person

307
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,740
that you can be yourself
with, you feel safe with,

308
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,340
why can't you be honest with me?

309
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,600
- It's just more fun to lie.

310
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,966
It's more fun to make up stories.

311
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,566
I like it, it feels like acting.

312
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,283
- Yet, you're not an actress.

313
00:27:11,225 --> 00:27:12,725
You're you, right?

314
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:16,389
Look, I'm trying to help you here, okay?

315
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,263
You don't need this, you
don't need this fucking life.

316
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,510
- Then why do people
like you keep calling me?

317
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,700
Keep wanting to see me, hm?

318
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,310
- Because I'm fucked-up, okay?

319
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,120
- So you're the only one
that's allowed to be fucked-up?

320
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,070
Other people can't?

321
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:36,174
(customer groans)

322
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:40,083
- Look, I got a lot more
years than you, okay?

323
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,243
And I don't want you
to go down a bad path.

324
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,563
I see something in you, you're not,

325
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,724
(sighs) you're not common.

326
00:27:52,724 --> 00:27:53,557
- Mm.

327
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,950
Um, and I like making
these different characters

328
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,170
and these different people to
go with these different men.

329
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,290
It feels like acting, it feels like lying.

330
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,470
Um, so I do wanna go to
school, maybe get a BFA

331
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,940
or do theater somehow, yeah.

332
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,993
Makes me happy.

333
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:16,322
(tense music)

334
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:27,930
- Sometimes, we do terrible
things in our lives

335
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,963
but they lead us to do
really great things.

336
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,643
You just, we didn't see it from the start.

337
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:57,528
(gentle, optimistic music)

338
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,275
This is nice.
- Mm.

339
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,253
Feel kinda sad in here, to be honest.

340
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,123
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

341
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,780
- What would make you less sad?

342
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,612
- Mm.

343
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,313
Going out in the sun.

344
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,157
Maybe with you.

345
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:47,851
- Really?

346
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,753
- Mm-hm.

347
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,456
- That could be fun.
- Mm.

348
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,679
- Yeah.

349
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,513
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

350
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:57,588
- Is it a date?

351
00:34:57,588 --> 00:34:58,566
- It's a date.
- It's a date, really?

352
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:01,153
- Let's do it.
- Okay. (giggles)

353
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:07,800
I do feel guilty sometimes

354
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,470
because I get a lot of
money from these men

355
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,053
and I feel like sometimes
I'm manipulating them

356
00:35:15,053 --> 00:35:17,840
because I am lying, I am
putting on a character,

357
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,373
a wig, a different person.

358
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:25,310
And that's money that
could've gone to their kids,

359
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,623
to their kid's education, to their wife.

360
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,220
You know, who am I to come into their life

361
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,030
and take that from them?

362
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,983
So I, I do feel guilty sometimes.

363
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:38,130
- I mean, even before we were married

364
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,093
I knew it was destined to be hell.

365
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,340
Just, yeah, Stacy seemed great on paper

366
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,010
but she was who everyone
wanted me to be with and,

367
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:52,330
and as soon as we were married,
just (snaps fingers) phew!

368
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,330
Flipped the switch.

369
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,740
She just became this raving bitch.

370
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,550
Just, everything I did was
wrong, or it wasn't enough

371
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,877
or "Why can't me have more vacations?

372
00:35:59,877 --> 00:36:01,940
"Why can't we go to the Hamptons?"

373
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,630
Just, all she wanted to do was
just take and take and take

374
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,180
and, and, and when we had
kids we thought that would,

375
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,130
that would help but that made it worse.

376
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,540
Just (sighs) to have so
many people on your back

377
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,260
that want something from you, your wife,

378
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,863
your kids, your boss, your, your job,

379
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,285
it's, I mean, are you
surprised that this happened?

380
00:36:25,285 --> 00:36:27,885
Are you surprised that I
ended up in this situation?

381
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,693
Doesn't just happen. (scoffs)

382
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:36,110
I mean, yeah, I'm no saint but (sighs)

383
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,963
sometimes enough is enough.

384
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,840
I mean, every man has his breaking point.

385
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,480
And I just (sighs)

386
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,173
I felt lost for so long.

387
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:02,483
And I just didn't know what to do.

388
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:07,737
So I start seeing this, this girl

389
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:14,010
and I didn't think that I'd
have this connection to her.

390
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,320
I didn't think it would go this deep.

391
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,593
I didn't think that I
would get this involved.

392
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,540
Maybe I just thought that I could find

393
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,883
who I really am with somebody else.

394
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,393
But then, when I think
about all of the good,

395
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,650
all the peace that it's brought me,

396
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,323
I'm not just some dirty old fuck.

397
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,173
I think that, through this experience,

398
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,680
maybe I can have a better
relationship with my wife

399
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,360
and with my family, and, and I can,

400
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:10,344
I can put it in the past,
I can, I can stop, I can.

401
00:38:10,344 --> 00:38:14,750
(sighs) It's just been a,
it's been a really hard test

402
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,750
for me because I do have
the physical attraction,

403
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,100
I have the lust but I
think what's more important

404
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,743
is helping another human
being find themselves.

405
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,763
And I think that I can bring
that back to my family.

406
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,573
Maybe be a better man.

407
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:42,797
Maybe.

408
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:51,532
♪ One, two, three, four ♪

409
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:54,199
