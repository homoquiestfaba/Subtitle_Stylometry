1
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,867
(clock ticking)

2
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:15,600
(pen scratching)

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,667
(maudlin music)

4
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,667
(distant traffic)

5
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:53,433
(distant footsteps)

6
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:12,700
(water splashing)

7
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:21,467
(faint pop music)

8
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,267
(crowd applauds)

9
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:34,733
- [Alonso] Please,

10
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:37,500
don't forget to
 turn in your papers.

11
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,167
(crowd murmurs)

12
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,200
- Excuse me Doctor Alonso.

13
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,133
I was about to print my
paper when my computer-

14
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,933
- I'm awfully sorry about
 your computer Mr Torres.

15
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:02,700
As you know every deadline
 is absolutely final.

16
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,200
- Okay, thank you.

17
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:19,233
(faint music "Numb"
 by Linkin Park)

18
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,167
- This thin layer of
 only two millimeters

19
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,333
covers the entire brain.

20
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,733
Now this amazing structure
 is where most functions

21
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:33,900
are generated.

22
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,067
It is likely that this shape
 arose during evolution.

23
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:43,467
To accommodate...

24
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,200
Excuse me,

25
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,867
an increase in the
 number of neurons.

26
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:53,533
(maudlin music)

27
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,967
(pen scratching)

28
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,833
(faint footsteps)

29
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,400
(footsteps)

30
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,833
(faint pop music)

31
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,567
(clock ticking)

32
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,867
(knocking)

33
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:12,700
- Come in.

34
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,267
- Hi.

35
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,333
- Good evening.

36
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,500
- Can I?

37
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
- Certainly.

38
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,700
(bag rustling)

39
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:46,867
- Thank you.

40
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,067
- Excuse me.

41
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:51,867
- Yeah.

42
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:58,300
- Have a good evening.

43
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,367
- I'll see you tomorrow.

44
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,400
- See you tomorrow.

45
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,833
(door closing)

46
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,500
(maudlin music)
