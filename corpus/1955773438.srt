1
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:05,147
VISERYS: This world wasn't always
so small and petty.

2
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:10,277
Thousands of years ago,
while the rest of men prayed to gods,

3
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,404
the Valyrians became them.

4
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,616
Through magic or sheer will,

5
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,369
they mastered
the greatest creatures in history.

6
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,833
A horse grants man dominion over the land,
a ship, over the sea.

7
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:31,507
But dragons gave us the sky,
and everything, and everyone beneath it.

8
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:37,054
At its height,
my ancestors ruled the known world.

9
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,182
Whatever parts we didn't
weren't worth knowing.

10
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:45,437
Our capital of Valyria
shamed the magnificent cities of the east,

11
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:50,359
for hammers and chisels were no match
for dragonfire and sorcery.

12
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:56,490
It was a city and an empire
built to last until the end of time.

13
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,326
It didn't.

14
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,747
Four hundred years ago,
the Doom fell on Valyria.

15
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,749
Mountains cracked open like eggs.

16
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,626
Lakes and rivers boiled.

17
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,547
Fountains of fire, ash and smoke
spewed from the ground,

18
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:16,844
so high and so hot
that even dragons burned in flight.

19
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:22,015
The land splintered,
and the angry sea rushed in.

20
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,479
In hours, the greatest city in history
became history.

21
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:33,235
But my ancestors didn't burn or drown
with the rest of their race.

22
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,157
Twelve years before the Doom,
despite the sneers of his rivals,

23
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:42,286
Aenar Targaryen
abandoned the capital with his family.

24
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:48,041
Legends claim that his daughter foresaw
the destruction of the city in a dream.

25
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,378
More likely, Aenar met with
some mishap at court

26
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,131
and chose exile over execution.

27
00:02:54,716 --> 00:03:00,721
He and House Targaryen slinked away
to a dreary, remote, godforsaken island.

28
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,599
Forsaken no longer.

29
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,519
With arts now lost to the world,

30
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,440
we transformed a tiny outpost
into Dragonstone,

31
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,526
a fortress fit for the last dragonlords.

32
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:20,407
Then Aenar's descendants settled into it
like a tomb for their lost homeland.

33
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,327
Until Aegon.

34
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,704
When he looked east,

35
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:29,791
he saw the past, old, tired, dead.

36
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,544
But when he looked west,

37
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,088
he saw the future,

38
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,926
gold in the ground, gold in the fields,

39
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,012
and no dragons in the sky but his.

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,309
He and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya
flew over the great continent,

41
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,395
ostensibly visitors to a strange land.

42
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,898
But when Aegon returned,

43
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:58,028
he ordered construction of a massive table
carved in the shape of Westeros,

44
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,281
with all the notable rivers and mountains
that they had seen.

45
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,244
A personal map of the Seven Kingdoms,

46
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,498
then ruled by seven squabbling families.

47
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:14,670
House Durrandon held the Stormlands
from their seat at Storm's End,

48
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,089
due south of Dragonstone.

49
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:22,094
House Hoare of the Iron Islands had
also conquered and enslaved the Riverlands,

50
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,096
and ruled them from Harrenhal,

51
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,975
a monstrous castle
rising on the shore of the Gods Eye.

52
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,937
House Stark held the frozen
wasteland of the North,

53
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,107
the oldest, largest
and emptiest of the kingdoms.

54
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,693
House Lannister held the Westerlands,

55
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,154
the wealthiest kingdom,
thanks to their gold mines.

56
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,699
House Gardener held the Reach,

57
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,827
the second wealthiest kingdom,
thanks to their crops.

58
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:51,290
House Arryn held the Vale,
or rather the Vale held them.

59
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,334
The mountains were impassable
except through the Bloody Gate,

60
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,253
which had never been taken.

61
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,923
House Martell held the deserts of Dorne,

62
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,676
probably because no one else wanted them.

63
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,887
Together, the Seven Kingdoms
made Westeros,

64
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,973
a realm that wasn't yet a realm,

65
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:12,561
ruled by great families
who didn't know what greatness was.

66
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,229
Aegon would teach them.

67
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,201
VARYS: Though House Durrandon
titled themselves "Storm Kings,"

68
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,454
they were little more than gusts.

69
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,582
Their kingdom in the Stormlands
had been doddering to its end

70
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,167
for the past few centuries,

71
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,336
helped along by other houses,

72
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,338
most of all by House Hoare,

73
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,424
who were nearly finished
with the monstrous castle of Harrenhal,

74
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,012
too large and too costly a seat to rule
only the Riverlands.

75
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:51,391
King Argilac knew
where the ironborn would soon turn.

76
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,352
You'd think a king who
wanted to keep his crown

77
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,438
would be wary of a man
with fire-breathing monsters,

78
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,400
but King Argilac Durrandon
wasn't called "the Arrogant" for nothing.

79
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,195
Determined to arrest his family's decline,

80
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,030
he sent an envoy to Dragonstone

81
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:09,117
to enlist Aegon Targaryen
and his dragons against his enemies.

82
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,080
In exchange,
Argilac offered lands he didn't have

83
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,123
and a wife Aegon didn't need,

84
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:20,629
for, as the Valyrians did,
Aegon had wed his elder sister, Visenya.

85
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,133
Then, as the Valyrians didn't,
he took the younger Rhaenys as well.

86
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,886
Two sisters, two wives.

87
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,139
Perhaps that's why he was so keen
to get off Dragonstone.

88
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,893
Aegon countered Argilac with courtesy.

89
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,728
He sent his own envoy requesting

90
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:41,483
that Princess Durrandon's hand be given
instead to Aegon's closest friend,

91
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,903
and rumored half-brother, Orys Baratheon.

92
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,823
Argilac answered with a box and a note,

93
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,326
"These are the only hands
your bastard shall have of me."

94
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,831
Inside the box
were the hands of Aegon's envoy.

95
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,959
How long had Aegon been waiting
for such a pretext?

96
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,545
As his army prepared to sail,

97
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,340
ravens flew to every great lord
of the Seven Kingdoms.

98
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,259
All bore the same message.

99
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,304
From this day forth,
there would be but one king in Westeros.

100
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,433
Those who bent the knee
to Aegon of House Targaryen

101
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,351
would keep their lands and titles.

102
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,979
Those who took up arms against him

103
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:22,399
would be thrown down,
humbled and destroyed.

104
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,693
Poor old Argilac.

105
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,529
He couldn't even match Aegon in arrogance.

106
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,157
Aegon landed at the mouth
of the Blackwater River

107
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,492
and raised a primitive "Aegonfort"

108
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,204
in the disputed land between
Harren's and Argilac's kingdoms,

109
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,999
so that neither could decide
whose problem he was.

110
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,210
Adopting the customs
of the Seven Kingdoms,

111
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,087
Aegon unfurled his own banner

112
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,175
with a red three-headed dragon
breathing fire upon a black field.

113
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:53,138
Visenya crowned him
with a ruby-studded circlet of Valyrian steel,

114
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,681
while Rhaenys hailed him as

115
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,768
the first high king the continent had seen
since the Dawn Age.

116
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,646
As his lords
and the gathered locals cheered him,

117
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,108
Aegon named his loyal friends
to a "Small Council"

118
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:10,071
led by Orys Baratheon,
whom he called, "My strong right hand."

119
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,823
The title stuck,

120
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,868
and a bastard became
the first Hand of the King.

121
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:21,541
But for now, Aegon's kingdom contained
only a rocky island and a handful of fields.

122
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:26,713
The other kings had larger armies, ships,
castles and thousands of years of rule.

123
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,840
But Aegon had dragons.

124
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:33,261
He had chosen for the words of his house,
"Fire and blood."

125
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:38,725
Before he was done,
the rivers, fields and skies would turn red.

126
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,197
EURON: Harren of House Hoare
inherited a kingdom

127
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,534
that stretched from
the Iron Islands to the Trident,

128
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,580
too great a kingdom to rule
from a castle as shitty as Pyke.

129
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,707
For 40 years, his ironborn

130
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,102
- plundered the Riverlands
- (METAL CLANKING)

131
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:09,130
for stone, timber
and slaves to build a seat worthy of him.

132
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,386
Legend has it that masons laid
the final stone in Harrenhal

133
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,223
on the very day
that Aegon landed in Westeros.

134
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,726
Could've been a divine omen.

135
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,982
Could've been the masons wanted to fuck off
before the dragons got there.

136
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,693
They weren't the only ones.

137
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,695
At Aegon's approach,

138
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:36,074
Harren's riverlords revolted,
led by House Tully.

139
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,784
I doubt Harren noticed.

140
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:42,163
Harrenhal could repel
an army of a million men.

141
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,791
No ladder could summit its walls,

142
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,085
and no ram could shatter them.

143
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,256
The castle was as impregnable
as an old maid's cunt.

144
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:56,177
Harren shut his gates around himself,
his sons, and his ironborn,

145
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,599
and waited for Aegon's army
to drain back into the muck.

146
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,979
When Aegon finally saw the monstrous castle,
he asked for parley.

147
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,148
Harren granted it.

148
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,611
Valyria had been the greatest empire
the world had ever seen.

149
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,989
Harren wanted to piss on its ashes.

150
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,745
AEGON: "Yield now, and you may remain
as Lord of the Iron Islands.

151
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,791
"Yield now, and your sons will live
to rule after you.

152
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,629
"You see my army outside your walls.

153
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,214
"You see my dragons."

154
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,260
HARREN: "What is outside my walls
is of no concern.

155
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,387
"Those walls are strong and thick."

156
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,973
AEGON: "Dragons fly."

157
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,892
(HARREN LAUGHS DERISIVELY)

158
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,311
HARREN: "But stone doesn't burn."

159
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,774
AEGON: "When the sun sets,
your line shall end."

160
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,986
EURON: Harren spat
and returned to his castle.

161
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,948
Once inside, he promised lands,
riches and Tully's daughters

162
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,619
to whoever could bring down
Aegon or his dragon.

163
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,288
As the sun sank below the horizon,

164
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,708
all of Harren's men patrolled the battlements,

165
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,961
hearing wings in every gust of wind.

166
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,507
But the moon rose, and sank,

167
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,634
and no dragon appeared.

168
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,970
VISERYS: While the ironborn
were ringing the battlements,

169
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,183
Aegon drove his dragon Balerion
higher and higher in the night sky

170
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:29,312
so that even the great castle of Harrenhal
looked like an anthill below them.

171
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:34,401
Then they plunged straight into the castle,
well inside the guarded walls.

172
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,738
The five towers of Harrenhal
reached towards Aegon like a hand.

173
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:43,284
Balerion opened his mouth
and bathed all the fingers in flame.

174
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:48,415
EURON: Harren was right, stone doesn't burn,
but men do,

175
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,334
even when they're ironborn. (SNIGGERS)

176
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,755
The dragon blasted my ancestors into ash

177
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,842
that choked the survivors
when they screamed.

178
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,804
Harren's soldiers leapt from the battlements
and died.

179
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,724
They huddled against the walls and died.

180
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,811
They fled across the yard and died.

181
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,982
Harren and his sons took shelter
inside the castle.

182
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,192
The stone didn't burn,

183
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:21,656
but as Balerion blasted it with fire,
it glowed white-hot.

184
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,991
(LAUGHS DERISIVELY)

185
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:28,413
The world's greatest castle
became the world's greatest oven,

186
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,666
baking the last of House Hoare within it.

187
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,419
VISERYS: Outside the castle walls,

188
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,756
the towers of Harrenhal
glowed red against the night

189
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,676
and began to twist and melt
like five huge candles

190
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,847
with liquid stone
trickling down their sides like wax.

191
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,350
The next morning,
Aegon forged a new Riverlands.

192
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,439
He named the rebel Edmyn Tully
as his Lord Paramount of the Trident,

193
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:58,443
and had the other riverlords swear him fealty
as their new liege.

194
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:02,363
For centuries, House Hoare
had terrorized the Riverlands.

195
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,032
Under House Tully,

196
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,786
the Riverlands would at last
return to peace and prosperity.

197
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,581
After the castle cooled enough
to allow men inside,

198
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:15,293
Aegon ventured into the ruin
he'd made of Harrenhal.

199
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,963
He saw the ashen bodies, the scorched stone

200
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,383
and the mangled and melted swords
of his former enemies.

201
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,302
To his men's confusion,

202
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:28,723
he ordered these useless swords collected
and sent to his Aegonfort.

203
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,988
VARYS: While Aegon marched on Harrenhal
after his coronation,

204
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:49,118
Orys Baratheon had taken most of his forces,
and his Queen Rhaenys with her dragon,

205
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,955
south to deal with the excuse for the invasion,

206
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,542
Argilac the Arrogant, King of the Stormlands.

207
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,919
Argilac had his seat at Storm's End,

208
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:02,173
a castle considered the most impregnable
in Westeros after Harrenhal.

209
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:06,636
Argilac may have been arrogant,
but he wasn't stupid or a coward.

210
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,932
His lords advised him to shut his gates
and wait out the siege,

211
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,351
but he'd heard
what had happened at Harrenhal

212
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,605
and refused to die a suckling pig
cooked in his own castle.

213
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:22,193
He would meet victory or defeat the same way,
with sword in hand.

214
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,156
He called his banners and marched
to meet Orys Baratheon in the field.

215
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,577
Thanks to Rhaenys' dragon, Meraxes,

216
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,205
Orys knew Argilac was coming,
how many men he had,

217
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,999
and how fast he marched.

218
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:41,296
So Orys simply seized the high ground
and dug in on the hills to wait for Argilac.

219
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,464
As the two armies approached,

220
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,010
the wind rose to meet them,
and the rain poured from the sky,

221
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,556
a gale which would give the battle
its name, "the Last Storm."

222
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:56,728
King Argilac's lords urged him to wait
for the weather to die down,

223
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,897
but the Storm King saw that the rain

224
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,984
was blowing into the faces
of the Baratheon men on their hills,

225
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,280
and Argilac outnumbered
the Baratheon host two-to-one,

226
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,700
with four times as many knights
and heavy horse.

227
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,369
Argilac attacked.

228
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,749
Three times Argilac led his knights
against the Baratheon line,

229
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,836
but the hills were steep
and the rain had beat the earth to mud.

230
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,785
- The warhorses foundered and slipped,
- (SWORDS CLANKING)

231
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,674
and the charges collapsed.

232
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,718
The battle seemed lost

233
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,512
until Argilac ordered
his spearmen up the hill.

234
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,059
Blinded by the rain, the Baratheons
didn't see them until it was too late.

235
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:40,229
- One hill fell, then another, and another,
- (MEN YELLING AND GRUNTING)

236
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,650
until only one remained
in the Baratheon center.

237
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,486
If Argilac could break through there,

238
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,281
he could split the invading army
and flank both halves.

239
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,701
Argilac and his men charged,
and the Baratheon line broke...

240
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,206
Revealing Queen Rhaenys and Meraxes.

241
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,919
Argilac's vanguard burst into flame,
and his men panicked.

242
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,338
- The victory charge fell into chaos,
- (HORSES WHINNYING)

243
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,174
and Argilac himself
was thrown from his horse.

244
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,301
But he didn't yield.

245
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,470
When Orys Baratheon arrived,

246
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,473
he found the old king holding off
half a dozen men,

247
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,976
another half-dozen dead at his feet.

248
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,437
Orys dismounted
to meet the king on equal footing

249
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,066
and offered Argilac one final chance to yield.

250
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,652
Argilac cursed him instead.

251
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,113
As the storm raged around them,

252
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,032
the grizzled old warrior
and the bearded upstart

253
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,284
fought for life and kingdom.

254
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,330
- In the end, Argilac got his wish.
- (SWORDS CLANKING)

255
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,791
He died, sword in hand.

256
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,420
As word of Argilac's death spread,

257
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,881
his lords and knights
threw down their swords and fled.

258
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:54,220
Orys and his vanguard rode to Storm's End
to claim Argilac's castle for Aegon

259
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,140
only to find the gates barred
and the walls manned.

260
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,560
Argilac's daughter had assumed his crown,

261
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,689
and the new Storm Queen
was as fond of yielding as her father.

262
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:10,069
She declared that Orys would win
only bones, blood and ashes here.

263
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,697
But her men were weaker than her,

264
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,659
and that night Orys found
Argilac's daughter delivered,

265
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,579
gagged, chained and naked to his camp.

266
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,458
Argilac had refused to give Orys her hand.

267
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,210
Now, Orys could have
any part of her he wished.

268
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,504
But Orys unchained the girl,

269
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,258
wrapped his cloak around her
and poured her a glass of wine.

270
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:36,846
He told her he would take the arms,
banner and words of House Durrandon,

271
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,058
to honor her father's courage
in the Last Storm.

272
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,644
Conveniently, Orys had none of his own
to discard first.

273
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,732
The crowned stag
became the sigil of House Baratheon,

274
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,151
and Storm's End their seat.

275
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,029
Argilac's daughter
would even remain in her home,

276
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,990
though as a lady instead of a princess.

277
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,410
The Stormlands were now Aegon's,

278
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,498
and as tribute, Aegon demanded
the swords of the men Orys had defeated.

279
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,418
For what purpose, Orys didn't know.

280
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,226
JAIME: Aegon now ruled
two of the Seven Kingdoms,

281
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,646
but he would no longer
be able to take the rest piecemeal.

282
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,273
For the first time in thousands of years,

283
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:33,361
the kings put aside their squabbles
and joined forces against a common enemy.

284
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,239
My ancestor, King Loren of House Lannister,

285
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,325
was head of the wealthiest family
in the Seven Kingdoms.

286
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,955
When King Loren joined his forces to
Mern of House Gardener, King of the Reach,

287
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,874
they had the mightiest army in history,

288
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:51,295
a so-called "iron fist"
to break the would-be conqueror.

289
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,966
But while an iron fist
can smash a man's face in battle,

290
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,052
you'd look silly hunting birds
or beasts with it,

291
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,222
and Aegon had a creature that was both.

292
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,226
The kings had never even seen a dragon,
let alone fought one.

293
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,478
They had fought each other
for thousands of years,

294
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,565
and victory always went to the larger army.

295
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:15,236
Surely a force five times that of Aegon's
could manage one dragon...

296
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,489
But Aegon arrived with three.

297
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,702
Still, the Lannisters and Gardeners
hoped for victory.

298
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,456
The battlefield they chose was a wide plain
with firm ground and clear skies.

299
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,209
Perfect for archers and mounted cavalry.

300
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:34,714
But neither of the kings spared a thought
for why the ground was firm.

301
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,382
There had been no rain for a fortnight,

302
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,302
which meant all the wheat and grass on it
were bone-dry.

303
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,762
- Perfect for dragons.
- (HOOVES THUDDING)

304
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,890
At first, the kings looked like

305
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,774
- they would emerge victorious.
- (HORN BLOWS)

306
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,312
When the horn blew for battle,
their armies swept around Aegon's flanks

307
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,523
and their iron fist of mounted knights
smashed through his center

308
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,609
before the dragons could even enter the fray.

309
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,739
But then Aegon and his sisters took flight
and unleashed their dragons

310
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:03,534
not on the soldiers,
but on the dry fields all around them.

311
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,704
- The iron fist unclenched

313
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,919
As Aegon promised, he had none.

314
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:18,299
More than 4,000 men died in the fires,
another 1,000 escaping them.

315
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,760
Tens of thousands
returned home as monsters,

316
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,387
burned and scarred beyond recognition.

317
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,973
House Gardener never returned at all.

318
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,770
The "Field of Fire," as the singers call it,
claimed the last of the Gardener line,

319
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,855
and House Tyrell rose in their stead

320
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,274
as Lords of the Reach
and Wardens of the South.

321
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,152
As for my illustrious ancestor,

322
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,404
when King Loren saw the battle was lost,

323
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,407
he rode through a wall of flame
and smoke to safety...

324
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,786
Or at least to a heroic capture a day later,

325
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,705
where he laid his sword
before Aegon and knelt.

326
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:54,252
Aegon, true to his word, spared him
and confirmed House Lannister

327
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,505
as Lords of Casterly Rock
and Wardens of the West.

328
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,257
Why wouldn't he?

329
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:04,345
A Lannister always pays his debts,
and now we owed our lives to the crown.

330
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,932
That was worth centuries of subservience,
at least.

331
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,020
Besides, Aegon had a fetish
for collecting swords, not heads.

332
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,108
He added Loren's to the pile
his men had retrieved from the Field of Fire

333
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,402
and sent them back to the Aegonfort.

334
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,750
SANSA: With most of the South
in Aegon's hands,

335
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,546
the best chance to throw back
the Conqueror now lay with the North,

336
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,215
if we cared enough to try.

337
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,967
Unlike our southern rivals,

338
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,387
the Stark Kings of Winter
didn't forge the North into one kingdom

339
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,431
for glory or gold,

340
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,517
there is little of either here, but to survive.

341
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,185
Alone in Westeros,

342
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,648
the North remembered when
worse than dragons laid waste to armies.

343
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,525
Thousands of years ago,

344
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,612
the sun set on the realms of men
and the Long Night began.

345
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,950
A new race emerged
from the ice and snow, the White Walkers.

346
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:12,496
They demanded no crown,
offered no terms, spared no life,

347
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,081
and the dead marched with them.

348
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:19,420
With humanity facing extinction,
a Stark sought out the Children of the Forest,

349
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,672
the most ancient beings in Westeros,

350
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,800
and convinced them to ally
with the men they'd once fought.

351
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:30,056
Together the two races pushed the Walkers
back into the Land of Always Winter

352
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,434
and sealed it off from
the Seven Kingdoms with the Wall,

353
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:39,315
300 miles of ice, stone and earth
rising nearly 700 feet tall.

354
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,693
To guard it,
they established the Night's Watch,

355
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,988
a brotherhood sworn to defend
the living from the dead,

356
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,033
whose vows erase both titles and crimes.

357
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:54,205
VISERYS: After the Long Night, the North
tried to forget it belonged to the continent,

358
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,833
perhaps through pride,
perhaps through sheer ignorance.

359
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,835
You never can tell with the North.

360
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,381
But as news of Aegon's dragons spread,

361
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:08,552
Torrhen Stark, the King of Winter,
knew he couldn't forget Westeros any longer

362
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,555
and summoned his lords to Winterfell.

363
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,558
Many fools shrugged off the threat

364
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:18,854
while the rest placed wagers on
how long the South would take to burn.

365
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,775
Torrhen silenced them
with a command to assemble their armies

366
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,070
and descend from the North in force.

367
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:30,074
SANSA: As the kings of the Rock
and the Reach burned on the Field of Fire,

368
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,785
the greatest Northern force
since the Long Night

369
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,912
crossed the Neck into the Riverlands.

370
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,832
But when King Torrhen arrived at the Trident,

371
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,418
he saw on the opposing riverbank

372
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,879
the combined strength of
all Aegon's conquered kingdoms.

373
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:50,177
A force larger than Torrhen's own by half,
and with three dragons.

374
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,264
VISERYS: That night, King Torrhen
called a conference

375
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,683
of all his lords and advisers.

376
00:23:55,767 --> 00:24:00,354
Some wanted to fight,
and trust Northern valor to carry the day,

377
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,481
and burn on the Trident.

378
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,152
The wisest of them
wanted to withdraw to Moat Cailin,

379
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:11,449
the fortress which had thrown back
every southern invasion, and burn there.

380
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,745
One suicidal lord even wanted to
ambush Aegon's camp in the dark

381
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,834
and kill the dragons as they slept,
or at the very least their riders.

382
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,212
Hard to tell what would've been his fate.

383
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,841
Burning, beheading, dismemberment?

384
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,093
Perhaps all three.

385
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,762
SANSA: My ancestor listened to their counsel,

386
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,575
- and in the morning crossed the Trident
- (HOOVES THUDDING)

387
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,391
under a flag of parley.

388
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:42,021
Then King Torrhen of House Stark
laid his ancient crown at Aegon's feet,

389
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,608
and was named Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North...

390
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,569
VISERYS: And the King Who Knelt.

391
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,404
SANSA: He had no choice,

392
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:55,326
and thanks to him our soldiers returned
to their homes whole and unharmed.

393
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:00,164
The swords that Aegon took from them
were not twisted, burnt or mangled.

394
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:01,999
VISERYS: Yet.

395
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:17,014
LITTLEFINGER: The Vale of Arryn
was the last of the great kingdoms left.

396
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,682
Old and proud,

397
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,353
House Arryn did
what they always did in times of strife.

398
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,940
They shut the Bloody Gate,
sealing off the Vale.

399
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:30,486
Then the Queen-Regent Sharra
of House Arryn retreated with her son,

400
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,908
the boy king Ronnel, into the Eyrie,
their family's impregnable fortress.

401
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:40,913
From the top of their mountain,
they could look down on Westeros far below,

402
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:44,041
its problems hidden beneath the clouds.

403
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,294
But one day Queen Sharra
entered the outer courtyard

404
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,548
to find her young son sitting on the knee
of Visenya Targaryen,

405
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,676
- and ogling her dragon, Vhagar, beside her.
- (VHAGAR GROWLING SOFTLY)

406
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,845
Just as he'd ask for another cake at dinner,

407
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,642
little King Ronnel asked his mother if
he could go flying on the nice lady's dragon.

408
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,144
Visenya smiled at Sharra.

409
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,648
So, Sharra imagined, did Vhagar.

410
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,359
Remembering her manners,

411
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,363
Sharra asked if she could have Visenya
brought some wine or food,

412
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,824
she must be tired after such a long flight.

413
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,159
But Visenya demurred.

414
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,414
Bored with his mother's pleasantries,
Ronnel demanded an answer.

415
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,499
Poor boy.

416
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,252
He didn't even understand the question.

417
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:33,591
Sharra hesitated for a moment,
then asked Visenya, as a mother,

418
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,342
if it were safe for the boy.

419
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,970
Visenya assured her it was.

420
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,348
What choice did Sharra have?

421
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,018
Whilst her son circled the castle,

422
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,938
she collected his little ringlet,
her own regent's coronet,

423
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,899
and the ancient Falcon Crown
of Mountain and Vale,

424
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,694
which the Arryns had worn
for thousands of years.

425
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:59,241
Ronnel had taken to the sky as a king,
but he landed as a lordling.

426
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,285
Perhaps he considered his ancient rights

427
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,706
a fair trade for a few minutes of flight,
as a little boy would.

428
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:11,211
More likely he didn't even notice
the three crowns at Visenya's feet,

429
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,840
or recognize the swords
of his garrison beside them.

430
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,023
VISERYS: The heads of Westeros
had bowed to Aegon,

431
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,859
but its heart still beat free.

432
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:37,446
Oldtown, the center of the Faith of the Seven.

433
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:42,117
There dwelt the High Septon,
the Father of the Faithful,

434
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,953
who commanded the obedience
of all Westeros,

435
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,540
save the savages of the North
and their Old Gods.

436
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,377
When Aegon had landed in Westeros,

437
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,463
the High Septon had locked himself
in the Starry Sept

438
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,591
and fasted for seven days and seven nights,

439
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,843
one for each of his gods.

440
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,806
All he received for his trouble
was the divine wisdom

441
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,852
that if Oldtown took up arms
against the Dragon, the city would burn,

442
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,188
faithful and faithless alike.

443
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,358
After the submission of House Stark,

444
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:18,779
Aegon marched towards Oldtown,
steeling himself for another battle.

445
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:23,450
But he found the gates open,
with the High Septon welcoming him.

446
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:29,248
The pious fool even had the arrogance
to grant what Aegon had already won,

447
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:34,211
and anointed the last Valyrian
as "Aegon of House Targaryen,

448
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:38,173
"First of His Name,
King of the Andals and the First Men,

449
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:42,428
"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm."

450
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:47,391
As if titles meant anything to a man
before whom time itself now bowed.

451
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:53,147
The maesters would hence divide all history
into "Before" and "After Conquest."

452
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:59,570
Most expected Aegon to stay
and make Oldtown his seat,

453
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:04,950
but soon after his coronation, Aegon
returned to the mouth of the Blackwater River

454
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,369
where he had first set foot on Westeros.

455
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,166
A small town had since sprouted
around his primitive fort.

456
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:17,337
To honor their new master,
the locals dubbed it King's Landing,

457
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,631
though it looked more fit for a hedge knight,

458
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,760
with wooden palisades, muddy streets

459
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:27,681
and piles of mangled swords
carted in from every corner of the conquest.

460
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,770
But when Aegon made it his court,
wood became stone.

461
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,689
Black mud was buried beneath a Red Keep.

462
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:40,611
And the collected swords of Aegon's foes
were blasted by dragonfire,

463
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,655
and became a seat fit for the Conqueror

464
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,784
and the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

465
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,369
House Targaryen.

466
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,954
My family.

467
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,373
My throne.

468
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,126
Or so it should've been.

469
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:13,227
VARYS: But while Aegon titled himself
"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,"

470
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,021
in reality he held only six.

471
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:19,525
The seventh, Dorne, had never knelt.

472
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,779
Visenya had flown into the Vale
and returned with its crown.

473
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,364
Mimicking her sister,

474
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:29,535
Rhaenys had flown over the enemy force
holding the passes into Dorne,

475
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:34,832
and landed in the castle of its ruling lady,
Princess Meria of House Martell.

476
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,294
Meria was 80 years old, fat, bald and blind.

477
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:44,258
Behind her back, many sniggered at her
as the "Yellow Toad of Dorne."

478
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,052
The beautiful Rhaenys probably
thought as much when they met.

479
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,514
She demanded Princess Meria
kneel to her brother Aegon,

480
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,809
though she allowed that on account of
Meria's age and health,

481
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,103
a simple vow of submission would do.

482
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,983
But the Princess told the Queen
that the Targaryens weren't wanted in Dorne,

483
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:05,779
and no Martell would ever bow, bend or break
no matter how badly they burned.

484
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,657
Rhaenys could have mounted her dragon
right then

485
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:13,203
and roasted Meria in the castle
as her brother had done at Harrenhal.

486
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,873
But whatever she saw in Meria's eyes

487
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,375
scared her right back to King's Landing,

488
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,836
with her dragon's tail between its legs.

489
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,839
After Aegon's coronation,

490
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:27,134
Rhaenys returned to Dorne
with Aegon and Visenya

491
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,261
and their dragons.

492
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,266
But no armies met them in the field,
and no lords defied them in their castles.

493
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,186
As the dragons approached,
Dorne simply emptied.

494
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:42,900
House Martell had learned
from Harrenhal and the Field of Fire.

495
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,235
The dragons were unbeatable in battle,

496
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,029
but wars were more than battles.

497
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,782
Unopposed, Aegon claimed Dorne
for his own.

498
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,243
But as soon as he returned to King's Landing,

499
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:58,332
his castellans were hurled off towers,
and his royal garrison vanished in the desert,

500
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,292
never to be seen again.

501
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:05,547
Except, perhaps, when the winds change
and the sands cough up old bones and armor.

502
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,550
Rhaenys returned on Meraxes,

503
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,429
intent on revenging herself
against Meria Martell.

504
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,681
But Dorne was no longer empty.

505
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,643
The Dornish kept Meria's promise,

506
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,021
and fought even while
burning under dragonflame.

507
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,856
And they won.

508
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:28,111
One day a bolt pierced the eye of Meraxes
and knocked the dragon out of the sky.

509
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:33,659
House Martell remained unbroken,
unlike the unfortunate Rhaenys.

510
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:39,957
In their wrath, Aegon and Visenya set flame
to every castle and city but Sunspear,

511
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,376
trying to turn the people
against House Martell.

512
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,962
But the Dornish stayed loyal,

513
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,673
and when Aegon returned to King's Landing,

514
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:51,510
he found assassins waiting for him
in the streets of his own capital.

515
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:56,640
If not for Visenya, the Conqueror would
not have enjoyed his Conquest for very long.

516
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,601
From then on,
the king and his family would be guarded

517
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:04,314
by the seven greatest knights in the realm,
the Kingsguard.

518
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:09,653
When Meria died in her sleep,
her weak and tired son sued for peace.

519
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:15,742
But old Meria had exhausted Aegon as well,
and he granted the request.

520
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,454
The Targaryens still wanted Dorne,
and eventually they would have it,

521
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,373
but not at the point of a sword.

522
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:25,335
They would buy it the same way
great lords buy anything...

523
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
With a daughter.

524
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,685
VISERYS: After the Conquest,
when men looked up, they saw dragons.

525
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,521
Nobles learned to keep their eyes down,

526
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,816
but the gods weren't used to
sharing the heavens.

527
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,821
When Aegon died, the High Septon
led the Faith and its army in revolt,

528
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,116
claiming that the Valyrian tradition
of wedding brother to sister

529
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,660
was an abomination in the eyes of the Seven.

530
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:03,081
Though no one could explain where
the divine Mother and Father had come from.

531
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:09,004
My ancestor Maegor the Wise,
or Maegor the Cruel, as men slander him,

532
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,924
put a bounty on the head
of every militant priest,

533
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,887
and miraculously the Faith
soon returned to the septs.

534
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:21,016
With Dorne in the fold,
and the Faith put in its place,

535
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,269
none in Westeros were left
to oppose my family,

536
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,230
so we started opposing each other.

537
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,482
In the Dance of Dragons,

538
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:32,110
a Targaryen Princess
tried to steal her brother's throne.

539
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,239
Thanks to her stupidity,
most of our dragons died,

540
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,367
though one thankfully ate her before it did.

541
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:44,331
But even without our dragons,
we were still the blood of Old Valyria,

542
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,292
which proved just as dangerous.

543
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,669
One of my foolish ancestors didn't see

544
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,298
what separated his bastards
from our family proper,

545
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,592
and legitimized them all on his deathbed.

546
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,428
Adopting the name Blackfyre,

547
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:03,183
the bastards proved their nature
and tried to seize their father's kingdom.

548
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,353
When they failed, their sons tried.

549
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,147
When the sons failed, their grandsons tried.

550
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,776
Until finally Ser Barristan the Bold,
knight of the Kingsguard,

551
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,780
slew Maelys the Monstrous
in the War of the Ninepenny Kings,

552
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,241
ending the last of the Blackfyre line.

553
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:24,621
Ultimately, without our dragons
and with our blood diluted by commoners,

554
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:28,375
we failed to see the greatest threat
growing under our noses.

555
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,044
JAIME: As the saying goes,

556
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,631
"Every time a Targaryen is born,
the gods flip a coin."

557
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,218
They must've dropped the one for King Aerys,

558
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,805
for at first he seemed to have
dodged the family madness.

559
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,975
But as he grew older,
he began to see conspirators everywhere,

560
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,769
and where there were none,
he worked to create them.

561
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,939
As one of his Kingsguard, I saw firsthand

562
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:54,901
that a king who couldn't rule his own mind
couldn't rule seven kingdoms.

563
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,403
We endured his reign

564
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,989
because we hoped his son Rhaegar
would right the realm

565
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,407
when he ascended to the throne.

566
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,910
But then Rhaegar proved as mad as his father

567
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,746
and snatched Lyanna Stark,
daughter of the Warden of the North,

568
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,833
and betrothed to Robert Baratheon,
Lord of the Stormlands.

569
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:14,171
When Lyanna's father and eldest brother
demanded justice,

570
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,375
- the Mad King obliged,
- (AERYS LAUGHING INSIDIOUSLY)

571
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,592
laughing as he dispensed it.

572
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,887
VARYS: Unsatisfied with only two murders,

573
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,348
the Mad King then ordered
Jon Arryn, Lord of the Vale,

574
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:29,936
to execute his two wards,
Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark.

575
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,899
Instead, Jon Arryn raised the Vale in revolt.

576
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:38,028
Ned Stark slipped past royalist sentries
and raised the North,

577
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:43,867
and Robert won three battles in a single day
to unite the Stormlands behind him,

578
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,454
only to be defeated by a royalist army
and forced to flee,

579
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,790
leaving his home of Storm's End besieged.

580
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,252
SANSA: The Hand of the King
finally cornered Robert

581
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,962
in the town of the Stoney Sept

582
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,881
and sent his soldiers door-to-door

583
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,765
- searching for the rebel leader.
- (KNOCKING)

584
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,261
But the villagers hated the Mad King
and loved Robert,

585
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,722
and kept him one step ahead of the soldiers.

586
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,266
Until only one refuge remained.

587
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,604
As the soldiers closed in,
all the town bells rang out.

588
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,833
- (BELLS TOLLING)
- Hearing of Robert's plight,

589
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,317
our father and Jon Arryn
had rushed to the Riverlands

590
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:21,279
and enlisted our grandfather, Hoster Tully,
to help them.

591
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,658
Together they routed the Hand's army
and rescued Robert.

592
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,827
To celebrate and cement the Tully alliance,

593
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:32,123
our father wed our mother, Catelyn,
and Jon Arryn took our Aunt Lysa.

594
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:37,003
Only a fortnight later,
both men rushed back into the field,

595
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,339
for the dragon had finally woken.

596
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,969
VISERYS: While my father's servants
were losing my father's kingdoms,

597
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,097
my brother Rhaegar
had been cooped up with his...

598
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,057
Mistress? Whore?

599
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,310
Whatever else, I'd call her a distraction.

600
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,564
But now Rhaegar came to his senses
and returned to King's Landing.

601
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,235
He persuaded our father
to summon his estranged friend,

602
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:04,698
Lord Tywin Lannister, the richest
and most powerful lord in the realm.

603
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,951
- Rhaegar himself would lead the royal army
- (HOOVES THUDDING)

604
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,869
against the usurper, Robert.

605
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,372
- (SWORD SWISHES)
- On the banks of the Trident,

606
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,875
my brother fought the man
whose wife he'd stolen,

607
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,962
and who fought to steal
his birthright in return.

608
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,633
In the end, Robert wanted it more.

609
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,970
His hammer shattered my brother's armor

610
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,724
and its rubies fell into the river like raindrops,

611
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,142
vanishing in the current.

612
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:38,398
VARYS: With Rhaegar's defeat, nothing stood
between Robert and King's Landing.

613
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,735
Imagine the King's surprise a fortnight later

614
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,822
when he saw not stags,
but lions outside his gates.

615
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,075
His former Hand, Tywin Lannister,

616
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,787
had come to the capital with a force
even Robert couldn't match,

617
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,581
claiming to be loyal to the king.

618
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:59,627
Trusting what he wanted to believe,
Aerys ordered the gates opened,

619
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,963
and the Lannister forces dutifully began

620
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:06,885
to rape, pillage and murder
the king's actual loyal subjects.

621
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,306
When Eddard Stark finally arrived
at the capital with Robert's army,

622
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,684
he found Lannister banners
hanging over the sacked city,

623
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,812
Targaryen corpses littering its streets,

624
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,107
and Ser Jaime Lannister
sitting on the Iron Throne.

625
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,402
Below him, the Mad King Aerys,

626
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,990
whom Ser Jaime had sworn to guard,
lay in a pool of his own blood

627
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,743
from a sword thrust through his back.

628
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,663
Lord Eddard might've thanked Ser Jaime
for doing the realm a favor,

629
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,291
but honorable as he was,

630
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,544
Lord Eddard condemned Ser Jaime
as a Kingslayer,

631
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,005
a name he would never escape.

632
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,634
JAIME: Unlike Lord Eddard,

633
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,679
Robert appreciated my contribution
to his glorious victory.

634
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,141
He pardoned me for my crime,
and even kept me on his Kingsguard

635
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,935
beside Ser Barristan Selmy,

636
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,729
who'd been wounded at the Trident
fighting for Rhaegar.

637
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:04,067
True, both of us had failed to protect
our Targaryen charges,

638
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:07,153
but perhaps that's what
Robert liked most about us.

639
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,364
When my father presented Robert

640
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,075
with the bodies of Rhaegar's wife
and two children,

641
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,911
Ned Stark hiked up his skirts and demanded

642
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,330
Robert send their killer to Dorne,
and me to the Wall.

643
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,291
But I saw what Ned couldn't.

644
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,503
Robert was ashamed of the bodies,

645
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,881
and more ashamed of his relief.

646
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:32,720
He knew that Rhaegar's heirs had to die
or his throne would never be safe,

647
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,849
but glorious heroes didn't kill children.

648
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,727
They simply didn't punish their murderers.

649
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,690
VISERYS: No doubt I would've
suffered a similar fate,

650
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,777
but my father had wisely sent me
and my pregnant mother to Dragonstone.

651
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:53,074
When the usurper heroically sent men
to kill me and my newborn sister

652
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,160
to protect his stolen throne,

653
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,788
a loyal knight smuggled us
across the Narrow Sea to Essos.

654
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,875
And so the last dragons of Valyria,

655
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,960
heirs to the greatest dynasty

656
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:08,173
from the greatest civilization
this world has ever known,

657
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:12,427
slept in sewers
and foraged for scraps in alleyways,

658
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,263
one step ahead of the usurper's knives

659
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:19,517
and one step behind the whispers
of his spymaster Varys.

660
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,145
But we won't run forever.

661
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,690
One day I'll return to my kingdoms
with an army,

662
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,650
take back my throne,

663
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:31,905
and repay all traitors
with the only coin my family knows.

664
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,658
Fire and blood.
