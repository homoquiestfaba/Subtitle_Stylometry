six by six, eight by eight.

735
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:54,344
Brick by brick, I put myself up.

736
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:57,715
Brick by brick, I
tore myself down.

737
00:56:57,815 --> 00:57:01,318
Brick by brick,
won't do it again.

738
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:05,122
Brick by brick, won't
let myself down.

739
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:11,529
Won't let myself fall
away like I did last time.

740
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:25,643
[Bricks screaming]

741
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:26,477
Fuck!

742
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,083
(SINGING) You breath
the air I breathe,

743
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:38,288
Victim inside me, accident
casualty of his greed,

744
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:39,657
Of his greed.

745
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:42,259
Your daddy's a killer.

746
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,061
Your mommy's a killer.

747
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:49,266
Hand in hand beneath the skull
'til you bleed, 'til you bleed.

748
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:50,668
Heartbeat.

749
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:55,239
My life is a crime scene,
nothing but body bags.

750
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:57,241
Nothing but open wounds.

751
00:57:57,341 --> 00:58:01,646
Two twisted hearts
bleed inside me.

752
00:58:01,746 --> 00:58:06,651
My life is crime scene, inside
my guts, inside my blood.

753
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:08,619
Bullet hole inside my heart.

754
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:13,223
One twisted heart will
bleed to death tonight.

755
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,825
Heartbeats,
heartbeats, heartbeats.

756
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:41,185
Start the fire.

757
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:43,588
We burn the fear.

758
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:47,592
Fear the fire and
burn the bridge.

759
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:51,596
Shed my skin, let me
burn just a little bit.

760
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:56,200
Shed my skin, let me
burn, let me burn.

761
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,602
Heartbeats.

762
00:58:57,702 --> 00:59:01,572
My life is a crime
scene, nothing but body

763
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:03,974
Bags, nothing but open wounds.

764
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:08,579
Two twisted hearts
beat inside me.

765
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:11,982
My life is a crime scene,
inside my thoughts,

766
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:15,552
Inside my blood, a bullet
hole inside my heart.

767
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:19,924
One twisted heart will
bleed to death tonight.

768
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:20,758
Heartbeats.

769
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:36,140
MAN (VOICEOVER): (SINGING) All
of the pain has come at once.

770
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:52,122
All that I used to
be has changed in me.

771
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:19,684
DUKES: Hey, shithead!

772
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:28,058
Lose the hood.

773
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:29,059
Lose it!

774
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:34,892
So you're the
coward with the gun.

775
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:39,296
We can do this the easy
way or the hard way.

776
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:40,297
Fuck you!

777
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:56,213
[Grunting]

778
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:38,022
[Bricks growling]

779
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:48,866
I live by a code.

780
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:50,400
BRICKS: Kill or
be killed, right?

781
01:02:55,873 --> 01:02:57,274
What did you do to her?

782
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:59,676
Did you touch her?

783
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:00,811
Did you rape her?

784
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,356
Fuck.

785
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:14,859
You ever been in love?

786
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:18,262
Fucking psycho.

787
01:03:18,362 --> 01:03:25,936
She left me, my
wife, kicked me out.

788
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:27,838
She tore my heart in
two and pissed on it.

789
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:33,177
You should fight for her.

790
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:36,813
Without her, you're
breathing stale air.

791
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:38,715
Your dick should be
getting hard every time

792
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,051
You think about how she smells.

793
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,520
You should be so
hungry that nothing can

794
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,022
Fill the holes in your guts.

795
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:49,493
She's not the one
I'm fighting for.

796
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,178
[Church bells]

797
01:05:20,985 --> 01:05:27,257
VOICE: (SINGING) When
you're left with me

798
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:35,232
Every moment, every day,
through the good times

799
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:44,008
And the bad, my only love.

800
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:50,380
SCARLET (VOICEOVER): Bricksy.

801
01:06:14,204 --> 01:06:17,507
(SINGING) Back to one.

802
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:24,681
As the sun sets, my
soul grows cold again.

803
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:29,053
Back to where it all began.

804
01:06:29,153 --> 01:06:36,826
It's like a death in the
family, I'm home again.

805
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:43,633
Write a eulogy, give it all
I've got, walk through the blood

806
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,402
And take that shot.

807
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:51,608
Write a eulogy, spare the
daughter and bleed the son.

808
01:07:04,054 --> 01:07:05,555
BRICKS: Yo.

809
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:06,556
Who's there?

810
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:23,140
I think I'm hurt, baby.

811
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:23,973
Looks like it.

812
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:26,910
Yeah.

813
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,878
Oh, baby.

814
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:33,417
Oh, baby.

815
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:37,187
Oh, baby, oh.

816
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:40,023
Ha, one tough chick.

817
01:07:40,124 --> 01:07:41,525
Don't you forget it.

818
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:48,498
This is a gift from my father.

819
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:52,202
He wanted me to be able
to take care of myself.

820
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:55,639
Mano y mano, is
that what you want?

821
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:57,207
SCARLET: (SINGING)
What you have to see...

822
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:58,342
BRICKS: (SINGING)
Such a pretty face...

823
01:07:58,442 --> 01:07:59,576
SCARLET: (SINGING)
Such an animal...

824
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:00,977
BRICKS: (SINGING)
You know I love you.

825
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,212
SCARLET: (SINGING)
If you had control

826
01:08:02,312 --> 01:08:03,513
BRICKS: (SINGING)
There's no control.

827
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:04,581
SCARLET: (SINGING) You
could save yourself

828
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:05,849
ALL: (SINGING) Now.

829
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:12,122
Only one will leave alive
tonight, bathed in blood.

830
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:13,157
BRICKS: (SINGING) Wanna be hard?

831
01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:14,558
Wanna be tough?

832
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:16,760
Willing to fight when you
know you've had enough?

833
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:22,031
SCARLET: (SINGING)
Do you know how

834
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:24,734
Long it takes to earn
respect and prove

835
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:29,139
You're not a weak bitch?

836
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:30,374
BRICKS: (SINGING)
Respect is blood.

837
01:08:30,474 --> 01:08:31,708
SCARLET: (SINGING)
Respect is love.

838
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:34,311
ALL: (SINGING) Respect
is love and domination.

839
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:42,186
All it took was two
hits and I was fucked.

840
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:43,553
You fucked me.

841
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:45,322
I coulda broke
your jaw you know,

842
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:47,891
But I didn't want to ruin
such a beautiful face.

843
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:54,264
SCARLET: (SINGING) This
is the last goodbye.

844
01:08:54,364 --> 01:09:00,237
I fought too hard to
watch my dreams die.

845
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:02,206
BRICKS: (SINGING) No
bloody, white picket

846
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:04,208
Fences, no second chances.

847
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:08,578
This is the last goodbye.

848
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:12,349
ALL: (SINGING) Blood in,
blood out, perverted fantasy,

849
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:13,149
Ecstasy.

850
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:16,886
This is the last goodbye.

851
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:17,721
Goodbye.

852
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:24,461
SCARLET: (SINGING) I'm not so
sorry that it ends like this.

853
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:28,832
BRICKS: (SINGING) I'm not
so sorry for what I did.

854
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:31,701
SCARLET: (SINGING) Words
are useless, only the gun.

855
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:34,804
BRICKS: (SINGING) Our
sins bathed in blood.

856
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,388
Son of a bitch.

857
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:52,522
Yes.

858
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:56,125
Your heart beats for me
only because I let it.

859
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:58,094
Now, tell me you love me.

860
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,095
I hate you.

861
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,364
Say it!

862
01:10:00,464 --> 01:10:01,731
No!

863
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:02,899
Tell me you love me.

864
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:03,767
No!

865
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:06,069
Tell me.

866
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:07,237
Say it!

867
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:08,605
I love you.

868
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:26,590
Only you, baby.

869
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:29,593
Only you.

870
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:31,995
Do it.

871
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:32,829
Do it.

872
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,414
That's my girl.
