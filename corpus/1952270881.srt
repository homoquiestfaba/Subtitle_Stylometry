1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,966
(thunder rumbling )

2
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,355
Man: Horns...

3
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,624
cars...

4
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:40,900
people--

5
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,036
all the malignant noise
of a city gone.

6
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:48,536
I used to hate the noise.

7
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,641
But now I don't know.

8
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,444
There's nothing left.

9
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,487
Well, almost nothing.

10
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,762
What happened?

11
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,326
Where did it
all go wrong?

12
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,305
For that
I have no answers.

13
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,137
But I do have a story.

14
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,859
- ( snarls )
- ( screaming )

15
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,266
( gasps )

16
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,698
( gunshots )

17
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,965
( gunshot )

18
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,871
Come on.

19
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,443
Come on.

20
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,620
- ( snarling )
- ( loud chewing )

21
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,407
Man: The gates of Cameo Place
keep the undead at bay.

22
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,534
Mostly.

23
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,943
"A few slip through
from time to time,

24
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,971
but our landlord is always
taking care of them."

25
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,115
- ( loud bang )
- ( snarling )

26
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,983
It looks like
his gun is jammed.

27
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,688
Maybe not.

28
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,629
Get away from the window.
( typing )

29
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,690
Dean, he needs our help.

30
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,566
What are we--
Dean, we've got to help him.

31
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,969
What can he do?

32
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,905
He's beyond any help.

33
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,432
Only a bullet
can save him.

34
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:34,139
Woman: 68 years old,
and this is how he goes?

35
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,205
- Nasty little things.
- ( continues typing )

36
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,412
Pure evil on earth.

37
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,580
That's exactly why we need
to stay put till help arrives.

38
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,352
Who's gonna run
the generator, Dean?

39
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,624
Who knows? I'm not volunteering.
Get away from the window.

40
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,722
I bet as soon as
the stupid thing loses power,

41
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,926
you'll be out there trying
to get more gas again.

42
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,460
Yeah, but only to have these on
to drown out all the noise.

43
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,597
Why are you so cold sometimes?

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,473
Years of rejection.

45
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,908
I am dying of boredom!

46
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,509
God!

47
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,221
Go ahead, ignore me.

48
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,782
Ignore me, Dean,
like you always do.

49
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,158
I'll just sit here.

50
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:26,188
Fine.
One of these days...

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,134
You know,

52
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,692
never mind.

53
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,297
Bye.

54
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,432
"With Mr. Charles dead
and gone,

55
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,377
unable to thin the number of ghouls
that slip through our gates,

56
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,381
who knows how long it will take before
they're clawing down our front door?"

57
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,476
Woman:
Oh, God, what was that?

58
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,317
Woman #2:
Looks like my landlord's arm.

59
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,424
Thank you.

60
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,486
It's my only good deed
for the day, bucko.

61
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,964
My only one.

62
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,517
- Why the fuck isn't this locked?
- I was waiting for you.

63
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,426
I heard gunshots.

64
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,557
- Gunshots?
- Yeah, a few minutes ago.

65
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,896
I told you about keeping
this door locked.

66
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,698
Look, I'm sorry.

67
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,471
Well?

68
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,566
There's motherfucking arm bones
in the yard.

69
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,769
Arm bones?!

70
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,574
I'm so sick of these
motherfucking zombies!

71
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,910
Got motherfucking arm bones
in the yard.

72
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,508
( sighs ) It's a motherfucking
plague, that's what it is.

73
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,078
Fucking biblical shit.
I do not need this.

74
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,419
Please, did you get it?

75
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,118
What?

76
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,525
Fuck, woman, are you crazy? Would you
close those motherfucking curtains?

77
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,492
- Damn!
- All right.

78
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,966
They're closed.
Now tell me--

79
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,696
God damn!

80
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,968
Zombie apocalypse, woman's got
the fucking curtains open.

81
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,498
Shit! Didn't I tell you
to board that shit up?

82
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,610
Damn.

83
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,547
What if those things
tried to get in?

84
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,574
Look, we're on the second floor.

85
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,247
Unless they learn to sprout wings
and fly, I think we're safe.

86
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,716
What were you doing
out there anyway, champ?

87
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,992
- My dad, he--
- Yeah, the guy in the street,

88
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,691
worthless.

89
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,701
Maybe you shouldn't talk shit
about things you don't fucking know.

90
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,968
Come on, Marcus.

91
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,440
Let's get out of here.
We're going to get your father.

92
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,761
Go ahead, go.

93
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,274
Go!

94
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,208
Mom.

95
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,767
We need him.

96
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,339
( loud chewing )

97
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,215
He's dead.

98
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,879
What you need is to live.

99
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,752
What you need is
to take care of this little man

100
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,451
and you ain't
gonna do it out there.

101
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,411
( sighs )

102
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,440
It's okay.

103
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,722
- ( sighs )
- Baby,

104
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,815
baby,

105
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,850
please talk to me.

106
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,787
I got it.

107
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,236
It's in the trunk
of the car.

108
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,762
Better not be fucking
with me, okay? I'm real hungry.

109
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,365
Yeah, and I'm starving
like a motherfucker,

110
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,968
but those things out there are
crawling over the motherfucking car.

111
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,947
You want that shit? You stick your head
out there in broad daylight and get it.

112
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,280
I'll get it
when the sun goes back down.

113
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,915
- ( squealing )
- Hey hey hey hey hey!

114
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,791
You know how I feel
about that noise. Shit.

115
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,697
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

116
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,138
It's bad out there, ain't it?

117
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,309
Hey, we been through worse.

118
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,544
I'm scared.

119
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,483
But we'll get through it, okay?
We always do.

120
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,218
Come here, mama.
Let me love you up.

121
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,485
That's some corny--

122
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,591
( generator whirring )

123
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,778
I'm trapped in here
with this self-engrossed boy-child.

124
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,621
I can't live like this.

125
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,889
Not anymore.

126
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:02,264
There's gotta be some
survivors out there.

127
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,565
Yeah.

128
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,301
If he goes out tomorrow
to get gas,

129
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,275
I'll leave.

130
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,470
And then he'll come back

131
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,446
and he'll realize
what a jerk he's been.

132
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,811
Or he won't, and probably
in his dumpy little brain,

133
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,013
he'll think that I'm the jerk.

134
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:28,159
Then he'll villanize me
in one of his unreadable stories.

135
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,004
( snoring )

136
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,729
( happy tune playing )

137
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,765
Woman:
Help, help me!

138
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,637
Oh, no.

139
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:52,166
You got-- you got the--
oh, Lord, Jesus Christ!

140
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,346
( screams )

141
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,282
Woman: Help me!

142
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,779
Fuck!

143
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,894
Look, there's no way
you could have known.

144
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,098
Yeah yeah.

145
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,908
Guess we really are
the last ones, huh?

146
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,487
You want some?

147
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,590
No.

148
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,261
Sorry, we're out
of fried chicken.

149
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,502
Woman:
Tough kid.

150
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,473
Mother:
You have no idea.

151
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:09,017
- Has he cried yet?
- No.

152
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,148
Woman: I had one.

153
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,097
I miscarried before Marcus.

154
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,228
What?
Are we girlfriends now?

155
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,264
No, I just thought--
I was just trying--

156
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,771
Besides, I didn't miscarry.

157
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,838
I killed her.

158
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,288
First, give me
the Albatron mixture.

159
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,622
Yes, good.

160
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,121
Soon, my dear,

161
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,896
I shall have super strength,
astounding wit

162
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,097
and a full head
of glorious hair,

163
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,538
the whole world will see
at the lnternational Expo

164
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,405
for Revolutionary Science.

165
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:07,310
- I shall be Scientist of the Century.
- ( giggles )

166
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,813
I will go with you.

167
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,440
When is the Expo?

168
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,450
Sometime in March.

169
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,952
Woman on TV:
That's pretty soon, my dear.

170
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,286
Man: Soon enough for you, Heidi.
Record the process.

171
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,959
( gagging )

172
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,897
Woman:
Oh, gross! Disgusting.

173
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,408
Oh, gross!
That's gross.

174
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,816
( clears throat )

175
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,314
It's done.

176
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,917
It is done.
Nothing's beyond my mental grasp.

177
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,927
Heidi:
Just one thing.

178
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,088
What is it?

179
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,223
You're bald!
( laughing )

180
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:04,168
- What?
- You're bald! You're bald.

181
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,000
You're bald!
You're bald!

182
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,671
- ( laughing )
- Dana.

183
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,737
This movie's awesome.

184
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,376
( electricity powers down )

185
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,280
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on, please!

186
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,264
Dana: We've got plenty of kerosene
here for everything.

187
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,177
It'll be kind of romantic,
don't you think?

188
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,202
Romantic?

189
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,075
If you could block out
the moans of the living dead

190
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,608
just outside,

191
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,087
bumping into the walls
at all hours

192
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,056
knowing that at any second

193
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,458
that rotten death can come
crashing through the door,

194
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,122
the moonlight on their
decrepit bodies,

195
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,758
blood the color of molasses
in the blue light,

196
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,997
their foul stench that creeps

197
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,698
into your nose
and onto your taste buds,

198
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,537
hideous claws ripping
the flesh from your ribs,

199
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,736
and you can't wake up
from the nightmare--

200
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:22,406
Thanks, Dean. I wasn't planning on
going to sleep again tonight anyway.

201
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,508
- God, jerk.
- The mail--

202
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,951
Iet's see what's in there.

203
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,648
Let's see.

204
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,713
Junk junk.

205
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,624
Ooh, coupons,

206
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,254
I guess and bills, a bill.

207
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,695
Small package from

208
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,723
"Takoru Technologies
Worldwide."

209
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,497
- Bill, check--
- Takoru Tech?

210
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,902
That's my new processor.

211
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,531
It is.

212
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,838
What the hell?
You've had it this whole time?

213
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,401
Well, what do you think, Dean?

214
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,710
Bills and junk mail aren't the most
important thing on my mind these days.

215
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,047
Yeah, but you knew I was waiting
for this, Dana.

216
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,576
Not really. Anyway,
it was sitting right here, Dean.

217
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:06,182
Maybe if you didn't spend so much
time on that stupid computer of yours,

218
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,193
you'd be a little more aware
of your surroundings.

219
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,559
- It's a hobby, that's all.
- No, it's not. It's more than that.

220
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,757
I can't compete.
Sometimes I wanna take that thing

221
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,358
and throw it out
into the pouring rain.

222
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,130
- Throw yourself in the rain.
- Dean.

223
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,898
Okay, I was kidding.

224
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,373
I only meant that you should
cool off. Don't get all huffy.

225
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,672
Well, it's too late for that.

226
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,201
All right, I'm sorry.

227
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,511
It's just that I've really
been waiting for this.

228
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,017
I'm sorry, really.

229
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,816
Yeah, you're sorry.

230
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,354
Take a look outside, Dean.

231
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,189
There are walking
dead people everywhere,

232
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,354
slowly closing in.

233
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,193
Oh, hey, wait.

234
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,495
Let me go outside
and check the mail for Dean.

235
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,935
In case you didn't know,
the mailman's dead.

236
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,437
Yeah, everyone's dead.

237
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,032
Bring your lamp.
I gotta get this thing in there.

238
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,272
- Why?
- Come on, you can help.

239
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,745
No power and it still has him.

240
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,759
- ( knock on door )
- Man: Open the fucking door.

241
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,818
Hurry up now.

242
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,864
Stanley.

243
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,700
- ( woman grunting )
- Lie down.

244
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,672
Who's your man?

245
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,973
- Where'd you find it?
- Frankie's.

246
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,241
Get your ass down!

247
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,214
Frankie's.

248
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,683
Looked like he was squirreling away
for a long winter.

249
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,414
- Where's Frankie?
- Fucking zombies must have got him.

250
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,922
I don't know.
I couldn't find him.

251
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,822
Can I unwrap it now?

252
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,590
Whoa, I don't think--
I mean, look, we still gotta clean it.

253
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,221
Smells like it shit itself.

254
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,323
Baby, can I have a taste?

255
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,995
Please, baby.
Please, just a little taste, please?

256
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,105
All right,
but just a taste.

257
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,767
Hey, remember what
I told you about noise?

258
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,808
( grunting )

259
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,348
Okay.
Hey, that's enough.

260
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,554
Hey hey!

261
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,585
- That's enough!
- I'm sorry.

262
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,622
- I'm just hungry.
- I know. Me too.

263
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,328
But if we gonna make this last,
we gotta be smart.

264
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,963
Get up here.

265
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,539
Please let me go.

266
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,074
Bitch, you must be crazy.

267
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,142
Get your ass up here.

268
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,329
Here, open this.

269
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,897
What, what is it?

270
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,376
- Just open it.
- Okay.

271
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,811
It's a hardware upgrade.

272
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:18,805
Latest in processor technology.

273
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,375
I was selected months ago
to try it out for free.

274
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,514
You mean like a sweepstakes prize
or something?

275
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,148
One out of a million.

276
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,625
Congratulations.

277
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,457
- Ow!
- ( sizzles )

278
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,053
Okay, I'm ready.
Give it here.

279
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,794
Hold on. It says to use protection
when handling. Hold on.

280
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,365
Where are you going?

281
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,273
Just to let you know,

282
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,510
very soon you shall be quicker
and more powerful,

283
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,610
enabling you to function
like never before.

284
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,846
As soon as my slowpoke
wife returns.

285
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,551
Dana!

286
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,253
Put those on.

287
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,285
You're pathetic.

288
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,755
( sighs )

289
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,078
We gotta get that
generator going.

290
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,591
We gotta see what it does.

291
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,718
Okay, I'm gonna go pee.

292
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,299
- ( muffled screaming )
- I told you about the noise.

293
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,737
Now this is your last
friendly reminder, you understand?

294
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,972
Please please please,
don't hurt me.

295
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,841
If you gonna be a guest
in our house, you gonna be clean.

296
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,249
Please! ( crying )

297
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,791
( shower running )

298
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,599
Hey.

299
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,628
Don't.

300
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,076
We can't stay here.

301
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,739
- Yeah, no one's keeping you.
- That's not what I mean.

302
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,873
He's sick.

303
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,409
He needs medication daily.

304
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,853
You're in luck, girlfriend.
There's a drugstore a few blocks over.

305
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,221
It's not that hard
to get to.

306
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,419
It's rare.

307
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,054
The chances of them
having it are slim.

308
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,564
You obviously
have a suggestion.

309
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,295
Yeah, we have a stockpile.

310
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,200
Where?

311
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,436
It's in an apartment
across town.

312
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,602
Good luck with that.

313
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:36,546
Come on,
you know I'd never make it.

314
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,811
Maybe not.

315
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:52,319
- Dana.
- Yes, what is it?

316
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,525
I made up my mind

317
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,933
to go to find fuel
for the generator.

318
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,460
I'll check Mr. Charles' place too.

319
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,632
He probably has a ton
of supplies.

320
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,507
Canned food, water,
maybe even more gas.

321
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,569
His loss...

322
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,775
- our gain.
- Well, you know my answer to that.

323
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,977
Well, I'm going.

324
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,919
Well, I'm not.

325
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm not going out there at night.

326
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,017
No, not at night.

327
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,789
Well, I'm not going
tomorrow either.

328
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,027
Fine, whatever.

329
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,034
It'll be a one-man mission.

330
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,831
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

331
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,895
( scoffs )

332
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,258
( woman whimpering )

333
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,566
Put something on!

334
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,527
You find something that fits?

335
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,502
Stanley:
Find her something?

336
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,932
Found it.

337
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,834
No!

338
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,511
Bitch, you know I'm gonna suck
your motherfucking blood,

339
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:32,546
and trust me, there's more
painful ways to extract it.

340
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,496
( screams )

341
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,750
Eat.

342
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:57,038
No no no no.
We're civilized in this house.

343
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,641
Why?

344
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,272
Look, what we have here

345
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:07,182
is what an intelligent man
would call a symbiotic relation.

346
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,743
We need you to survive.

347
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,224
And without us,
you're fish food.

348
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,590
You're not gonna kill me?

349
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,791
That is not any kind
of question.

350
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,697
The question is

351
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,895
is how comfortable
are you gonna live?

352
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,467
You got me?

353
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,738
Mm-hmm.

354
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,617
She's eating.

355
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,755
- You smelled it?
- Sweetest blood I ever smelled.

356
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,788
Oh, God, I wanna suck her dry.

357
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,529
Yeah, me too.

358
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,936
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah, back at you, babe.

359
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,939
- ( gulps )
- What's the matter?

360
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,878
I don't know.
It tastes funny.

361
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,643
Let me see that.
You always got something to say.

362
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:15,779
- ( winces )
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,720
Yeah, it's not that bad.

364
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,088
It don't taste like any human blood
I've ever tasted.

365
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,559
Do you even remember the last time
you had human blood?

366
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,119
I think so.
And it didn't taste like that.

367
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,028
I don't think we should
drink it.

368
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,932
It's fine.
Hey, maybe it's her diet.

369
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,868
You remember Bulgaria?

370
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,064
God, I can still taste the garlic.

371
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,938
Yeah, with all this going on,
Lord knows what she's been eating.

372
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,739
Still, it don't taste
as good as I thought it would.

373
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,769
It never does.

374
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,410
Woman:
Damon, don't go.

375
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,665
- Damon.
- ( loud chewing )

376
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,642
- Damon.
- ( low growling )

377
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,076
( slurping )

378
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,629
( gunshot )

379
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,165
( baby crying )

380
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,830
- ( baby growls )
- ( gunshot )

381
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:50,272
( keyboard clacking )

382
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,891
There's a map book
in the kitchen.

383
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,728
Mark the address.

384
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,633
Tomorrow you'll have
what you need.

385
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:33,308
You're welcome, Marcus.

386
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,195
( slithering )

387
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:41,341
( mechanical voice )
Pervert pervert

388
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,547
pervert!

389
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,579
( gasps )

390
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,957
She left?

391
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,260
Yeah.

392
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,372
You sent her home.

393
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,434
Mommy.

394
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,350
( humming )

395
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,992
You look rested.

396
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,290
Good. This is--

397
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,695
( sniffs )

398
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,826
- It's my...
- Shit, girl, don't say it.

399
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,769
I don't wanna know.

400
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,295
I'll get the wife, okay?
Just--

401
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,001
Just-- just chill, okay?

402
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,010
Stellie, Stellie!

403
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,043
Stellie, get your ass
over here.

404
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,681
Look, I need you
to draw the blood, okay?

405
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,783
- Think you can do that?
- Yeah. Yeah, I can handle that.

406
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,794
Look, I was tripping before,
okay?

407
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,763
But I'm cool now.
I promise.

408
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,732
What's the problem?

409
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,634
She's having girl trouble,
you know?

410
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,605
- She's having her period?
- Now why you have to go and say that?

411
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,504
You know how I feel
about that talk.

412
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,635
You are such a child. Get your ass
in there. I'll get something for that.

413
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,110
Calm down, girl.

414
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,310
I ain't gonna gut you.

415
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,751
I just need to pull
a little something-something.

416
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,153
So what's your name?

417
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,089
Why do you wanna know?

418
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,251
Seeing as how we're gonna
be spending some time together,

419
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,318
I thought that
we should introduce.

420
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,456
Suit yourself.

421
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,695
Natalie. My name is Natalie.

422
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,101
Well, hi, Natalie.
I'm Stellie.

423
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,376
You know,

424
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,072
you look as sweet
as you smell.

425
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:32,344
Thank you, I think.

426
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,215
Guess that sounded better
in my head.

427
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,847
Stellie.

428
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,988
What is it, Natalie?

429
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:46,428
Can I come out
of the room?

430
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,696
We'll see.

431
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,012
( gasping )

432
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,245
( zombie growling )

433
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,781
That's a nice machete.

434
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:33,403
How could something
that looks and smells so sweet

435
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,504
end up tasting so sour?

436
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,947
There's something wrong
with that girl.

437
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,644
This ain't right.

438
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:44,121
You going somewhere?

439
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,146
We need another.

440
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,489
Well, what about jungle fever
in apartment 16?

441
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,787
Look, I'm just saying.
I mean, you think we should replace her?

442
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,357
I really think we should
give it some time.

443
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,562
Look, this is not gonna work.

444
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,468
Not in the long run.

445
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,201
I need to go out there
and find another.

446
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,539
Hopefully a male.

447
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:10,172
We can feed off of him,
use her to supplement.

448
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,738
Maybe breed 'em.

449
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,512
Breeding.
That's pretty smart.

450
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,577
Yeah, I thought it up.

451
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,021
Hopefully, he'll taste
a little better.

452
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,321
Well, what about us?

453
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,687
I trust you.

454
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,961
You sure about that?

455
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:35,269
- Yes, I'm sure.
- Oh, yeah?

456
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,898
Stanley: Tonight.

457
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,722
( door creaks )

458
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,706
Who the fuck are you
supposed to be?

459
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,872
- Shh!
- ( screams )

460
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,014
- You dead son of a--
- ( shushing )

461
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,789
Good.

462
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,061
I'm going to snap
your neck like a twig.

463
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:14,416
My cactus.

464
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,048
( gasps )

465
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,782
Whatever that was

466
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,817
cannot exist.

467
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,824
But those things outside do.

468
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,168
Everything's too real
to be a dream.

469
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,000
I could be dreaming.

470
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,713
Maybe this is all
one great nightmare...

471
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:18,519
that seems to be half a year,

472
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:21,217
but it's actually

473
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:24,193
one night of sleep.

474
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,558
No no, it's all too vivid,

475
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,627
too complex.

476
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,505
( heart beating )

477
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,222
( squelching )

478
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,299
( door closes )

479
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:08,489
We have power?

480
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:11,831
How do we have power?

481
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,900
We have no power, Dean.

482
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,736
It's the backup power.
I have a little left from earlier.

483
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,538
Oh.

484
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,207
I can't sleep.

485
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:28,207
I was thinking
about Mr. Charles.

486
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:31,915
What do you think he was thinking
when those things ripped his arms off

487
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,014
and nobody went
to help him?

488
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:37,424
He was probably thinking, "Oh, shit,
they fucking ripped my arms off."

489
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:51,397
Do you remember
when we were married

490
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:54,535
and we said we'd love
each other

491
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,808
until the end of time?

492
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,344
Do you still love me?

493
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,062
Dean.

494
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:19,535
Dana, I told you that I get
caught up in my writing.

495
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,876
I'm tired.

496
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,810
I'm tired.
Aren't you tired?

497
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,742
I'm not. I'm bipolar.

498
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,776
- Go back to sleep.
- Okay.

499
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,584
Ouch!

500
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:31,797
( rat squeaks )

501
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,227
You are a vicious
little fucker.

502
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,876
Lord,

503
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,815
grant me the strength
to do what must be

504
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,581
and the knowledge to guide me
through these difficult waters.

505
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,350
There was someone
in the apartment.

506
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,653
The boy?

507
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,058
A warrior.

508
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:30,297
Did she possess the mark?
The tattoo on her wrist?

509
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,762
I don't know.

510
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,501
Robert is with her
in the apartment now.

511
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,668
Go back and find the boy.

512
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,645
Do what you have to do.

513
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,191
It should be me.

514
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,217
( speaks in tongues )

515
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:34,496
She's not the one.

516
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,238
Get her up.

517
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,374
( grunting )

518
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,253
Where are they?

519
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,288
What the hell is going on?

520
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,599
Where?

521
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,940
Who?

522
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,536
( winces )

523
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,942
( grunting )

524
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:30,043
( panting )

525
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:37,184
Priest:
You don't know.

526
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:45,232
She doesn't know.

527
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,407
Kill her.

528
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:07,421
- What do you want?
- Please, I'm a priest.

529
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,897
- What do you want?
- The boy.

530
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,559
Como say what?

531
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:20,661
The Antichrist.

532
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,331
( grunts )

533
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:07,776
( growls )

534
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,539
- ( snarls )
- ( bones crack )

535
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,715
This was supposed
to be our world.

536
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:45,741
( happy tune playing )

537
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:48,613
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- ( music stops )

538
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,449
- Don't say that.
- No, it's okay.

539
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:54,253
No, I mean don't take
the Lord's name in vain.

540
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,692
Sorry.

541
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,890
I just meant I'm sorry
for what--

542
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,228
you know...

543
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,700
Well, you know
what they say.

544
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:09,136
You know about things
that don't kill you

545
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,800
and whatnot.

546
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:14,241
No.

547
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:17,440
Well, they say something.

548
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,785
I tried to talk
to him about it once,

549
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,313
but he wasn't having it.

550
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:31,191
I don't know how you cope.

551
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:33,218
I don't.

552
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,289
At least you had a family.

553
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,961
You don't have a family?

554
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:47,465
I've always been a loner.

555
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,479
A friend used to say that
was my lot in life,

556
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,504
whatever that means.

557
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,224
No, wait.

558
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,228
I won't bite.

559
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:16,102
Is that supposed
to be funny?

560
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,368
Please.

561
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,954
Just a little, okay?

562
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:27,009
He's completely absorbed
with his computer again.

563
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,714
It's like he's a slave
and that machine

564
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,739
is his master.

565
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,497
Who does he think's actually
gonna get a chance

566
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,433
to read anything
he writes anyway?

567
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,130
- Really?
- Awww.

568
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,468
He's completely forgotten
about us,

569
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,407
the way we used to be.

570
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:01,672
Morris,

571
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,578
you're probably
my best friend.

572
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,741
( moans )

573
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,307
That's disgusting.

574
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,445
God, Morris!
Jeez, ew ew!

575
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,581
Sorry. Morris, God!

576
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,190
I think I shall try to sleep.

577
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,722
Good night, Morris.

578
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,901
( coughs )

579
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,370
( spits )

580
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,572
( classical music playing )

581
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:57,286
Hey.

582
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,483
I wanna talk to you.

583
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,923
Where's everybody going?

584
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,120
Aren't we having fun?

585
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,186
Morris:
You were having fun.

586
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:10,893
We do not feel anymore.

587
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,731
This is death.

588
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,330
We just want to rest

589
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,363
and you want us to dance.

590
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:21,639
Do you not see
how selfish that is of you?

591
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,640
Your happiness is not ours.

592
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:32,179
So we must go.

593
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:36,020
I wanna go with you.

594
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:43,123
You should not be
with the undead.

595
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,295
What do you
wanna do today?

596
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:21,267
I want to go out.

597
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:26,638
- ( moaning )
- Maybe not.

598
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:31,672
Guess we'll have to think
of something else to do.

599
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,945
I'm beat.

600
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,884
Come on.

601
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,251
It's nothing a little fix
can't help.

602
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,391
Okay.

603
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,335
Okay, that's it.

604
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:39,871
Morning comes
and I'm almost finished.

605
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,710
Not bad for a night's work.

606
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,443
- ( knocking on door )
- Stanley: Stellie!

607
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,468
Stellie, come on.
Open the damn door.

608
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,175
Stellie.

609
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,880
Stellie! Stellie.

610
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:20,013
Stellie, come on,
open the damn door.

611
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,524
Stellie, Stellie,
open the door, come on!

612
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,048
Stellie!

613
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:31,229
Stanley: What the hell
are you doing out of your room?

614
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,566
Stellie, Stellie.

615
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:38,039
Stellie, baby.

616
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,372
Did you drink from her?

617
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,802
I'm glad you're back.

618
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:46,679
You see,

619
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,184
I don't think she's strong
enough to continue on.

620
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,686
Is she gonna die?

621
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,713
Of course she's gonna die.

622
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,092
But I don't think

623
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:00,618
that's the question
you should be asking.

624
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:02,358
What you should be asking is:

625
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,992
how are you gonna spend
the rest of the time you have left?

626
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:10,670
I'm gonna kick
your motherfucking--

627
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,135
You bloodsuckers
are all the same.

628
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,951
What happened?

629
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,393
She escaped.

630
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,528
Michael's dead.

631
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,370
She protects the boy.

632
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,470
Where?

633
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,811
A gated community
in Culver City.

634
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:54,748
We need to go now.

635
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,685
The boy must die.

636
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,525
( speaks in tongues )

637
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,260
I will not fail you.

638
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,767
I love what you've done
with the place.

639
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:51,364
She tried to lead you
to your death.

640
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:53,841
Yeah?

641
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:58,680
I'm not your enemy.

642
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,885
Yeah, but you messed
with my feng shui.

643
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:12,552
( bones crack )

644
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,030
Nigga, please.

645
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,308
Don't run.

646
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:28,970
I don't run.

647
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,571
Good.

648
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:34,515
- Are you gonna kill me now?
- No.

649
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,542
Kill you? No no. I like you.

650
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,611
And I need you.

651
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,122
You need me?

652
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:44,991
I need an unclean vessel
to bring my father to this mortal coil.

653
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:46,790
To bring your Armageddon
to completion.

654
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,558
Our what?

655
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,929
- I'll never be a part of--
- Wait, a part of what?

656
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:52,490
What the hell
are you talking about?

657
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,003
Armageddon, the zombies,
your plan to end the world.

658
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:57,301
End the world?

659
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:59,432
Why would I wanna do that?

660
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:02,603
I'm here to save it.

661
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:06,604
Have you ever looked around
at this world? Before, I mean.

662
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:10,312
Lying, cheating, murder,
terrorism, fast food--

663
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:12,980
we don't want it to end.

664
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:15,047
Then who?

665
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:21,862
No, he wouldn't do that.

666
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:23,888
Wouldn't he?

667
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,094
Ever hear
of the Great Flood?

668
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,194
A dude named Noah?

669
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:31,229
I hate to break it to you,
princess, he has.

670
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:35,373
Why don't you ask
your robed friends outside?

671
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,677
( snarling )

672
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:50,915
They're here to make sure
their Lord's plan comes to fruition.

673
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:56,893
To make real.

674
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,428
- They're coming.
- ( snarling )

675
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,938
Jesus, they're swarming.
Can't you do something?

676
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,271
Twitch your nose,
snap your fingers?

677
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:09,004
It doesn't work that way.
I'm a physical being.

678
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:10,671
Yeah, well,
let's get physical.

679
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,914
We're doing the right thing.

680
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,183
I'm just protecting
what's mine.

681
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:21,883
- When they get in--
- Don't worry about it.

682
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:24,984
- ( glass shatters )
- Fine.

683
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:30,863
( gunshots )

684
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:38,798
You are quite a warrior.

685
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,504
Has someone been in here?

686
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,445
Besides the zombies?

687
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:47,147
Your girl was
in my stuff.

688
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,277
That's my stuff, my stuff.
I didn't go through her personals.

689
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,947
Marcus: True enough.

690
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:08,034
Heather:
How are you doing, bucko?

691
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,470
Marcus:
I've had better days.

692
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,974
All right.

693
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:16,978
Come on.

694
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:28,318
- ( gun clicking )
- A little help here.

695
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:31,383
- ( Marcus grunts )
- ( zombies thudding )

696
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,421
That's awesome.

697
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,524
Do you cook?

698
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,076
Not so fast.

699
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,345
( snarling )

700
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,620
Natalie:
You're weaker.

701
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,685
Another day,
you won't be able to move.

702
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,856
Another day after that,

703
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,956
you'll be dead.

704
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,968
Somebody's angry.

705
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,773
Now this is what a smart girl
would call a symbiotic relationship.

706
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:36,423
Feed feed!

707
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,392
Feed!

708
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,258
That's it.

709
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:44,156
That's it.
( laughing )

710
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:46,963
That's it. Good boy.

711
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,937
Good boy.

712
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,963
That's it.

713
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,305
That's it. Good boy.

714
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,593
That's interesting.

715
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:53,926
( ragged breathing )

716
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,299
I'm so sorry, baby.

717
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:41,713
She's not looking too good.

718
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,742
Looks like you're gonna
have to pull double duty today.

719
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:49,147
Fuck you.

720
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,921
What did I tell you
about the language?

721
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:57,955
Hmm?

722
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:02,370
What are you?

723
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,770
Does it matter?

724
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:07,139
Would knowing matter?

725
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:08,734
Hmm?

726
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,982
Drink.
Drink or she will.

727
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,796
( coughing )

728
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:41,838
You can bleed yourself.

729
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:45,070
Why keep us alive?

730
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:49,817
A girl gets lonely
in an apocalypse.

731
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,611
Till tomorrow.

732
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:17,935
Father, bless this blade

733
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,074
and guide its path so that
the cleansing can continue.

734
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,351
( Heather grunts )

735
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:27,487
You can't stop it.

736
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:30,720
- ( grunting )
- ( squelching )

737
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:51,806
You did the right thing.

738
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,714
I guess we'll see.

739
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:30,215
Oh, come on!

740
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,021
You ain't got no life left.

741
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:16,589
Take mine.

742
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,127
You guys are awfully quiet
in there.

743
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:47,082
Oh, man!

744
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:00,327
( screaming )

745
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:04,533
( grunting )

746
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,977
No!

747
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,987
( feet squelching )

748
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:37,716
We're leaving.

749
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:40,057
Where?

750
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:43,189
I know a place--

751
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:46,462
sort of provincial-slash-Tudor.

752
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:51,533
Are you ready?

753
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:30,439
( gasps )

754
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,883
Dana, Dana, get up!

755
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,947
No!

756
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:52,023
Fuck you!

757
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,501
Machete.

758
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,304
( gasps )

759
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:36,810
( screams )

760
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:39,643
Little help!
Little help!

761
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,775
No! Help!

762
01:23:54,996 --> 01:23:56,930
Stellie:
After everything

763
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:59,729
I still don't have no answers.

764
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:02,828
What happened?

765
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,499
Well, I guess in the end

766
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,008
it doesn't matter
how we get here.

767
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:11,877
What matters is
what we do while we're here.

768
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:14,040
And what I'm gonna do,

769
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,642
I'm gonna kill me some
motherfucking zombies.

770
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:46,639
( zombie snarling )
