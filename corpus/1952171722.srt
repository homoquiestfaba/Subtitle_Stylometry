1
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,318
Who's there?

2
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,592
Look, I'm warning you.
This is a restricted area.

3
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,511
If I catch you, there goes your ride pass.

4
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:40,349
Stupid kids.

5
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,480
Look, I'm warning you.

6
00:03:58,236 --> 00:03:59,696
Car problems?

7
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,282
Nothing seems to be going right today.

8
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:04,659
Today would be a good day
to stay home and knit.

9
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:08,037
Well, it all depends on
what kind of pattern you've bought.

10
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:12,167
You got help coming?

11
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,378
No. Not that I know of.

12
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:18,590
Just checking, Miss Prince.

13
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:22,343
It wouldn't do for you to have been
followed by one of your co-workers.

14
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:23,553
Believe me...

15
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:27,849
no one would suspect that it was me
who leaked that confidential file.

16
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:33,354
It's going to be a pleasure dealing
with a double agent who's above reproach.

17
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:39,027
Listen, it's taken me
four very long years...

18
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:42,113
to build up a sterling reputation
with the IADC...

19
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:44,907
and I think it's about time it paid off.

20
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:51,038
I take it, then, you are interested
in my latest offer?

21
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:54,625
I couldn't care less about unscrambling
White House phone conversations.

22
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:55,960
What?

23
00:04:56,377 --> 00:04:58,379
Somebody else is interested...

24
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:00,756
to the tune of $100,000.

25
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,883
Who?

26
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:05,052
That isn't for you to know or find out.

27
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:08,347
We're going to do everything
like we did it before.

28
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:11,267
Only, instead of having one week
to get me the information...

29
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,019
you have two days.

30
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:14,478
Two days?

31
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:16,313
Or no deal.

32
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:23,237
There's only one person I know of
that likes to work that fast.

33
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:25,448
Harrison Fynch.

34
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,910
Come on, the IADC is very much aware...

35
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,580
of Mr. Fynch's domestic spying operations.

36
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:36,000
They just don't know what,
when, where, or how.

37
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,554
That should do it, lady.

38
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,764
Do everything I told you,
and you'll be all set.

39
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:53,434
I think I deserve to know
who I'm selling to.

40
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:56,854
You just be real careful,
and that baby will take you 100,000 miles.

41
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:57,980
Yes, sir.

42
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:21,807
- How did you do that?
- That?

43
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:24,935
You haven't seen anything yet.

44
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:29,523
Is it Harrison Fynch that wants to buy
the information from Diana Prince?

45
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:31,316
- Yes.
- Where is he?

46
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,528
All I know is that he is setting up
a surveillance operation here.

47
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:37,781
- Here? In Washington?
- Yes.

48
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:42,411
Who's your contact
in Fynch's organization?

49
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:43,870
I'm meeting with a man.

50
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:47,791
Well, somebody's going to meet him,
I'm afraid it won't be you.

51
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,000
Now, who is he?

52
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:51,586
And where is this little rendezvous
to take place?

53
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:55,423
A man with a crutch.
A cafeteria at Eighth and Curtis.

54
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:56,800
Password?

55
00:09:56,883 --> 00:10:00,345
"The pound cake's stale,
so why don't you try the apple pie?"

56
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:44,138
Harris...

57
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:46,766
Fynch. Harrison Fynch.

58
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:49,686
Thank you.

59
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:53,981
Right. Harrison Fynch.
Sorry, I got a mind like a sieve.

60
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:56,401
My secretary says
I drink so much of this stuff...

61
00:10:56,484 --> 00:10:59,654
it just flushes everything
right out of my brain.

62
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,241
Let's see now, you're here to discuss...
What is it...

63
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,117
insurance?

64
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:08,663
I'm here to discuss
buying your amusement park, Mr. Gurney.

65
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:12,708
Well, that's easy. It's not for sale.

66
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,378
Everything is for sale, Mr. Gurney.

67
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:18,381
Everything and everyone has a price.

68
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:20,049
I don't want to sell.

69
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:23,594
- Perhaps not at this moment.
- No. Not at any moment.

70
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:25,054
Look...

71
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:29,058
my brother and I dreamed
about owning a place like this...

72
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:31,560
ever since we were little kids
in kindergarten.

73
00:11:31,644 --> 00:11:35,481
Davey, that's my brother, he thought up
practically half the rides in this place.

74
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,441
You seen that Super Loop back there?

75
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:38,776
Davey designed that.

76
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:41,654
American history class,
our junior year in high school.

77
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:44,406
When that Super Loop was installed here
three years ago...

78
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,575
it put this place right on the map.

79
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:50,037
So, it was your brother David
who designed that Super Loop?

80
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:51,830
Right.

81
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:55,125
Might almost say
that, in order to make history...

82
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:56,877
old Davey had to flunk it.

83
00:11:56,961 --> 00:12:00,130
Well, then, perhaps it's David
I should be speaking to.

84
00:12:00,673 --> 00:12:03,550
No, David's dead.
Missing in action in Vietnam.

85
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,804
Look, what I'm trying to say, Mr. Fynch...

86
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,932
is that I have no reason or desire to sell.

87
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:14,770
Listen... As long as I'm up, please.

88
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:19,858
Mr. Gurney, please
don't misunderstand me. I...

89
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:23,946
The reason for my visit here today
is simply to let you know...

90
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:28,325
that should a reason develop
for you to want to sell...

91
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,452
sometime in the future...

92
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:32,746
you have...

93
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:35,916
a very eager...

94
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,461
and a very qualified buyer
at your beck and call.

95
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:42,798
I'll tell you again,
there's no way I'm ever going to sell.

96
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:45,675
In spite of the migraines and the ulcers...

97
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,678
I've got way too much
invested in this place.

98
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:52,933
Well, thank you for your time, Mr. Gurney.

99
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:11,242
Fynch plans to set up operations
in Washington?

100
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:12,494
Sounds that way.

101
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,704
The information that I was using
to bait him...

102
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:16,873
is the kind he usually
likes to buy and sell.

103
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:20,168
It's top-secret, exotic,
extremely valuable on the black market.

104
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:23,546
But apparently, this time he was planning
on keeping what he bought...

105
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,006
for himself.

106
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:27,550
He intends to set up
some kind of system...

107
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:29,594
to monitor
shortwave phone conversations.

108
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:31,387
That's probably only part of his plan.

109
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:34,599
With his expertise, he'll find a way
to monitor all communications.

110
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:36,434
Having him headquartered
in Washington...

111
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,728
is like having a shark
in a public swimming pool.

112
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:40,021
You're not kidding.

113
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:41,522
Before long, foreign countries...

114
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:43,483
are gonna know more
about our government than we do.

115
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:44,609
What you got, Beverly?

116
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:47,403
You know, Steve, we've been trying
to bust this guy for three years.

117
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:49,155
It's now or never.

118
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:50,573
I'm going to check with Ira...

119
00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:53,451
see if he can come up with a lead
as to Fynch's next move...

120
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:56,579
- now that we know his intentions.
- I think that's a good idea.

121
00:13:57,163 --> 00:13:58,873
Meanwhile, I've got-

122
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:03,878
- How does he do that?
- What? Make those noises?

123
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:07,089
No, get into rooms
when all the doors are closed.

124
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:10,384
I don't know about you,
but I've been afraid to ask.

125
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,220
Good. Come here.

126
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:22,104
- Here it is.
- A 50-cent piece?

127
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:25,149
It's a bug.
Something our lab boys dreamed up.

128
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,151
Thanks to our friend Wonder Woman...

129
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:31,030
I have a little rendezvous with one
of Fynch's operatives this afternoon.

130
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:35,368
And this will give us a chance
to beat Harrison Fynch at his own game.

131
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,664
And I'm going to cash in on my newly
established career as a double agent.

132
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:05,189
You should learn to play chess, Mr. Pierce.
Wonderful for the mind.

133
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,609
Are you kidding?
I have enough trouble with checkers.

134
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:11,904
Hold all calls.

135
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:15,115
- I'm only telling you What I saw.
- What you think you saw.

136
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,451
What I saw!
And I'm not the only one, Mr. Gurney!

137
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:20,454
Half the kids who work here
have seen it around the Super Loop.

138
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:21,747
What did it do, maul you...

139
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,334
carry off screaming patrons,
leave gigantic footprints in the concrete?

140
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,460
No.

141
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:29,713
But there's something
in this park that shouldn't be here.

142
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,924
I saw it. It's real, and it's horrible.

143
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,675
And it's wrong to keep it a secret.

144
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,594
The only thing that I'm covering up...

145
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:37,721
is the fact that I exercise poor judgment...

146
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,723
when I hire guys like you to work.

147
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,016
Now, you can this nonsense...

148
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:45,020
or I'm going to give your job to somebody
with a little more respect for the truth.

149
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:47,522
I resent being called a liar, Mr. Gurney.

150
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,442
And I resent you spreading
the irresponsible rumor...

151
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:53,820
that my Fun Universe is haunted
by some kind of depraved monster.

152
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:56,198
The public and the press
are squirrelly enough...

153
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:58,617
When it comes to amusement parks,
you understand?

154
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:02,662
Someday you're going to be real sorry
you kept this thing a secret.

155
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:05,916
And I intend to be around to say,
"I told you so. "

156
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:19,763
Something strike you funny, Mr. Fynch?

157
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:22,182
Yes, Mr. Pierce.

158
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,059
I just discovered a way...

159
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:27,937
to force Mr. Gurney to sell me
that amusement park of his.

160
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,200
- Ms. Patrick?
- Yeah?

161
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:44,495
I heard you're taking a bunch of kids
to Fun Universe.

162
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:45,747
That's right.

163
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:48,124
Can I go? Please?

164
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,876
Oh, Randy...

165
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:54,047
I could only wrangle
a limited number of free passes.

166
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:56,841
I was going to take the younger children.

167
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:59,594
You're going to need somebody
to help watch them.

168
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:01,471
Well, Jeff is coming along.

169
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:03,181
Let me do it.

170
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,976
Jeff is older than you, Randy,
he's more responsible.

171
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,561
I'm responsible!

172
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,564
Please, Ms. Patrick.
He's been there before and I haven't.

173
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,192
They've got roller coasters there,
three of them.

174
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,737
You and your roller coasters.

175
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:20,698
Look, I can watch the kids
just as good as he can.

176
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,996
All right. We'll be leaving at 2:00 sharp.

177
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,081
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:38,674
- Sure I didn't give them to you?
- You said you'd take care of it yourself.

179
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,926
I distinctly remember putting them
in a manila envelope.

180
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,096
I'll write up some new passes,
the kids will just have to wait.

181
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:47,308
All right, we got "O" for orphanage...

182
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:49,560
Never mind, Mr. Gurney.
I'll take care of it.

183
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:52,313
Nothing. "P."

184
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:54,815
Patrick Home for Boys.

185
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,110
Twelve ride passes. What did I tell you?

186
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:06,452
- I'm telling you.
- Yeah, I know.

187
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,996
Flushes everything right out ofmy brain.

188
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,083
It appears our friend Mr. Gurney
is a bit of a philanthropist.

189
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,714
I'll have to remember that
when I take over his amusement park.

190
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:20,924
Good for my image.

191
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,224
Your move, Mr. Pierce.

192
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,604
Like I said, Mr. F...

193
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,649
checkers is hard enough.
I don't get this game.

194
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:38,859
Play.

195
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:43,030
When is your appointment, by the way?

196
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:46,074
Told Thorpe I'd meet him
in about half an hour.

197
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:13,018
Randy, come on.

198
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:10,867
The pound cake is stale,
why don't you try the apple pie?

199
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,250
I had the apple pie yesterday.

200
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:21,794
It's not that good.

201
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:26,257
I know you expected the password
to be given by a man, Mr. Pierce.

202
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:30,595
But When I have information to sell...

203
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,848
I don't use a go-between.

204
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:51,115
I don't know what you're talking about...

205
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,825
Diana.

206
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,870
Why don't you have a seat?

207
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:58,455
Okay, so you know who I am,
and I know who you are.

208
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:02,251
You must also know...

209
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:05,129
what kind of information I have to sell you.

210
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:07,131
Not interested.

211
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:10,634
Well, Mr. Fynch might think differently.

212
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,306
After all, Thorpe did trust me enough...

213
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:18,892
to allow me to take his place
at this little rendezvous.

214
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:24,481
My boss likes things done his way.

215
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:27,568
Your being here in person
isn't part ofhis plan.

216
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,987
So...

217
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:36,743
Pleasure.

218
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,001
Excuse me, sir.

219
00:21:44,793 --> 00:21:46,837
You have left your change.

220
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,143
Got him.

221
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:05,355
Let's arrange a meeting so that you can
at least talk to Fynch. Okay?

222
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:08,358
Let's just say the deal's off.

223
00:22:09,943 --> 00:22:11,319
Thanks, lady.

224
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,586
Ms. Patrick?

225
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:32,090
Tommy says he lost his ride pass.

226
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:34,342
He said the string broke and it blew away.

227
00:22:34,426 --> 00:22:35,885
He must have been playing with it.

228
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:38,388
Where were you
when this happened, Randy?

229
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:41,391
You're supposed to be watching them,
that's why you're along.

230
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,769
Look, just tell me where to go
and I'll get him another one.

231
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:46,563
Those passes were donated to us.

232
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:49,357
I'm not going to have the park owner
think we're taking advantage...

233
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,067
by asking for another one.

234
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:54,946
Tommy is just going to have to suffer
the consequences of your unreliability.

235
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:56,865
My...

236
00:22:59,242 --> 00:23:02,704
Here, take mine.

237
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:05,957
But you so much as touch it,
I'll break your arms.

238
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:09,836
- Now, tell me. Which way did yours blow?
- That way.

239
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:13,006
I'll be right back.

240
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:16,134
You better go on
and catch up with the others...

241
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:18,803
so you don't get lost
and I get blamed for that, too.

242
00:24:38,006 --> 00:24:39,508
Hey...

243
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:42,636
is anybody there?

244
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,191
Is anybody down here?

245
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:05,784
I'll never get out of here.

246
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:21,007
Is somebody there?

247
00:25:57,335 --> 00:25:59,128
Is anybody down here?

248
00:26:29,992 --> 00:26:31,202
Hello?

249
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:33,120
Yeah.

250
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:36,457
Diana, lunch is ready. Come on in.

251
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,504
- Listen to this.
- We got a feed?

252
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:44,715
I take back all the rotten things
I ever said about the lab boys.

253
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,592
That 50-cent piece works like a charm.

254
00:26:46,676 --> 00:26:49,470
- Great, is the tape rolling?
- Sure is. Let's eat.

255
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:56,268
But it wasn't Thorpe who showed up.
It was that Prince woman herself.

256
00:26:56,977 --> 00:26:58,396
Good pickles.

257
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:01,023
Said she didn't need any middleman.

258
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:03,901
I told her to forget it...

259
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:06,612
you don't do business that way.

260
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:09,323
He must be talking to Fynch.

261
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:13,369
Then I got out of there.

262
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:15,746
I'll tell you something, though.

263
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:19,083
That Diana Prince is a heck of a lot
better-looking in real life...

264
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,126
than she is in pictures.

265
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:25,839
Well, I'm sure there are many people
outside the IADC...

266
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:29,885
who can supply me with the technical
information I'll require, Mr. Pierce.

267
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:31,762
Right now, however...

268
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,431
you will find a bomb...

269
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:39,186
Yeah, I can pick it up.

270
00:27:39,728 --> 00:27:41,688
I'm only about two miles from there.

271
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:46,443
What kind of bomb is it,
and where do I plant it?

272
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:51,281
Fine.

273
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:53,659
But tell me...

274
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:55,619
what is a Crazy Wheel?

275
00:27:57,704 --> 00:28:00,582
Mr. Pierce, it's a sort of a Ferris wheel.

276
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:04,503
You'll find the name to be quite
appropriate once you've seen it.

277
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:06,338
Poor Mr. Gurney.

278
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:09,174
He's just discovered...

279
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:12,052
a youngster has disappeared
from his amusement park.

280
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,765
Last night, a monster,
today, a missing orphan...

281
00:28:17,224 --> 00:28:19,893
tomorrow, a terrible accident.

282
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:25,565
It appears that bad luck
does run in threes, Mr. Pierce.

283
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:29,152
Pretty soon he'll beg you to buy his place.

284
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:31,655
Talk to you tomorrow, Mr. Fynch.

285
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:33,657
After the noon news.

286
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:36,534
This is the biggest break
we've ever had, Diana.

287
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:38,161
We nail him planting that bomb...

288
00:28:38,244 --> 00:28:41,164
and it's the beginning of the end
for Mr. Fynch.

289
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:43,500
What, you know where they intend
to plant it?

290
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:44,918
Take a look at this.

291
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,588
Ira's been theorizing
just how Fynch might go about...

292
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:51,549
setting up a major surveillance operation
here in Washington.

293
00:28:51,674 --> 00:28:55,261
According to what we just heard,
this is the most likely possibility.

294
00:28:55,345 --> 00:28:57,430
Isn't that Fun Universe Amusement Park?

295
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:59,265
It's the perfect cover for him.

296
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:03,102
It's a legitimate enterprise,
constant crowds, lots of diversions.

297
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:06,189
Perfect place for agents to rendezvous
and pass information.

298
00:29:06,272 --> 00:29:09,150
And since we already know that Fynch
is particularly fond...

299
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:11,194
- of microwave phone conversations-
- Yes.

300
00:29:11,277 --> 00:29:14,447
That tower would be a perfect place
to set up monitoring equipment.

301
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:17,033
- And that's the Crazy Wheel.
- Yeah.

302
00:29:17,116 --> 00:29:18,952
Which they apparently intend
to sabotage...

303
00:29:19,077 --> 00:29:21,829
in order to encourage the park owners
to sell out.

304
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:53,361
You've checked all the rest rooms,
all the concession booths?

305
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:55,154
Okay, here's what I want.

306
00:29:55,237 --> 00:29:58,407
I want you to post three guards
at every exit until closing time.

307
00:29:58,491 --> 00:30:01,369
If he isn't found then,
I want you to organize a dragnet.

308
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:03,788
Are you certain that
that boy didn't leave the park...

309
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:04,997
and hitchhike home?

310
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:09,001
No. Randy would never have left
until the absolutely last minute.

311
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:11,253
He was fascinated by the rides here.

312
00:30:11,337 --> 00:30:15,049
The roller coasters in particular,
and especially that one.

313
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:20,804
All right. I'll double-check security
around the roller coaster grounds.

314
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,226
No offense, Mr. Gurney, but I think
it's time the police were notified.

315
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:27,561
There's no need for that.
My people will find him.

316
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:30,189
Your people were trained
to run an amusement park...

317
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:31,649
not to find lost children.

318
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:32,858
May I?

319
00:31:11,396 --> 00:31:12,773
Who's there?

320
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,195
Who is it?

321
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:00,111
...in a tool case.

322
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:02,989
He's going in as a member
of the cleanup crew. I'm following.

323
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,617
Wait a minute.
You sure you don't need some help?

324
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:08,036
If you lose him,
we'll have to tell the park not to open.

325
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,662
Then Fynch'll know we're on to him.

326
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:12,665
I have no intention of losing him, Steve.

327
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:20,018
Wait!

328
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:50,375
Please, don't be frightened.

329
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:53,211
It's all right.

330
00:37:58,216 --> 00:38:00,802
You're gonna help me get out of here?

331
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:03,805
I can't let you leave.

332
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,933
What are you going to do with me?

333
00:38:08,643 --> 00:38:10,103
I don't know.

334
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,291
We had a team out looking for him
all last night.

335
00:38:31,624 --> 00:38:34,919
And no, the boy is definitely
not in the park.

336
00:38:36,504 --> 00:38:39,382
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

337
00:38:39,966 --> 00:38:42,593
Look, didn't I already answer
that question?

338
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:43,928
What do you want?

339
00:38:44,011 --> 00:38:46,264
There's a Diana Prince out here to see you.

340
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:49,684
I never heard ofher. Give her
an appointment two years from today.

341
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:51,102
Mr. Gurney.

342
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:52,854
Kidnapping? Listen...

343
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:56,524
you use that word on your newscast,
you got yourself a libel suit, buddy!

344
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:39,668
Did you ever ride the Super Loop?

345
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:43,713
If so, in a way...

346
00:40:44,172 --> 00:40:45,590
I was there.

347
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:50,387
See, I designed this ride.

348
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:54,683
I know it better than anybody up top.

349
00:40:56,268 --> 00:40:58,895
I know where it's likely to weaken...

350
00:40:59,187 --> 00:41:00,397
they don't.

351
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,402
So I keep tabs on it from down here.

352
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:10,448
I try to let them know
where they should make repairs.

353
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,210
My name's Dave.

354
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:27,131
It's not contagious.

355
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,808
What happened to you?

356
00:41:37,725 --> 00:41:38,977
Vietnam.

357
00:41:43,189 --> 00:41:46,150
I was flying in a chopper
filled with napalm.

358
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:56,828
I let everyone think
the explosion had killed me.

359
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:19,183
You see, my brother...

360
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:21,686
owns the amusement park upstairs.

361
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:25,481
Having a face like mine around
isn't too good for business.

362
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:29,193
Unless you want to charge a buck a stare.

363
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,370
Besides...

364
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,501
he's got enough problems as it is.

365
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,638
What's that?

366
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:02,393
That's some kind of bomb.

367
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:07,564
Trevor.

368
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:08,899
Hi.

369
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:10,734
Diana! How'd it go?

370
00:43:11,443 --> 00:43:14,404
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

371
00:43:14,488 --> 00:43:15,656
Preference as to order?

372
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:17,324
Yeah, give me the good news first.

373
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:21,203
Okay, Fynch's man was not able
to plant that bomb in the park.

374
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,871
You recovered it?

375
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:25,874
You sitting down yet?

376
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:28,585
Where is it? Still in the park?

377
00:43:30,003 --> 00:43:31,213
I think so.

378
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,006
What do you mean, you think so?

379
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,841
It's a long story, Steve.

380
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:37,678
Listen, I'm going to grab
a late breakfast and head on in.

381
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:38,929
Any developments?

382
00:43:39,012 --> 00:43:42,224
You didn't happen to see a missing
teenager in the park, did you?

383
00:43:42,307 --> 00:43:44,142
No, I sure didn't.

384
00:43:45,644 --> 00:43:46,770
Okay.

385
00:43:46,853 --> 00:43:48,522
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

386
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:51,942
Yeah, that's real good.
Run off about 200 of these.

387
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:53,902
- Post them around the park.
- Will do.

388
00:43:53,985 --> 00:43:56,279
By the way, you got a call earlier
from Mr. Fynch.

389
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:57,405
Who's that?

390
00:43:57,489 --> 00:44:00,283
He said he was here yesterday.
He gave me his phone number...

391
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:03,119
- wanted to make sure you had it.
- Probably about insurance.

392
00:44:03,203 --> 00:44:07,415
Please, make this phone stop ringing.
I got nothing to say to anybody.

393
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:12,796
I'm afraid that's not quite true,
Mr. Gurney.

394
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,131
How could it not be true, Sergeant?

395
00:44:15,215 --> 00:44:17,801
We spent three hours
talking with each other last night.

396
00:44:17,884 --> 00:44:21,262
That was before I did some talking
to some of your employees.

397
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:26,101
Now, what is this they tell me
about a monster in the park?

398
00:44:26,476 --> 00:44:27,811
Money is no object...

399
00:44:27,894 --> 00:44:31,689
as long as you can assure me
the job will be done immediately.

400
00:44:33,149 --> 00:44:35,401
I realize she's an IADC agent.

401
00:44:37,362 --> 00:44:39,197
I realize that, too.

402
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,662
Why do you suppose
no one has ever succeeded?

403
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:48,206
No.

404
00:44:49,415 --> 00:44:53,836
It's because no one has ever said,
"Get Diana Prince, whatever the cost. "

405
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,174
I'm saying it to you, am I not?

406
00:45:00,051 --> 00:45:02,970
She's been interfering with my affairs,
and I want her dead...

407
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:04,889
by the end of the day.

408
00:45:06,557 --> 00:45:08,226
Whatever it takes.

409
00:45:09,727 --> 00:45:10,978
Fine.

410
00:45:11,896 --> 00:45:13,481
I'll be waiting.

411
00:48:14,118 --> 00:48:15,620
