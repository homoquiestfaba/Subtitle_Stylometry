1
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,510
<i>Dave, I have Mike Stevens</i>

2
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,212
<i>calling again.</i>
<i>Connecting you now.</i>

3
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,380
-Sorry,
I got your message.

4
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,282
We're just a little bit busy
around here right now.

5
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,150
What can I do for you?

6
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,657
-Yeah, Dave. Listen,
I need your help.

7
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,631
I need you to help me to
get a group of missionaries

8
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,065
<i>out of Pakistan.</i>

9
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,501
-Missionaries? Come on, Mike.

10
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,736
<i>I've got thousands of people</i>
<i>trying to escape the country.</i>

11
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,438
<i>Three administrations</i>
<i>we kept this thing together,</i>

12
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,106
<i>and this one</i>
<i>just wants to walk away</i>

13
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,142
<i>and let the enemy</i>
<i>take over the country.</i>

14
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,711
So now they're hitting
us with everything they've got,

15
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:19,514
just as we're trying to pull out
and claim some kind of victory.

16
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:21,583
-I... I know.

17
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,752
I know.

18
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:34,194
-You can't tell me that these
people didn't know the risks

19
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,697
<i>when they went in there.</i>

20
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:36,965
Look, you're just
going to have to tell them

21
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:38,432
to bag it up and get out.

22
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:41,869
-They're Americans.

23
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,108
-Americans? Americans.

24
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,317
-This ministry brought
this guy and his family over

25
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,452
<i>here to start a church</i>

26
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:00,253
<i>in this little village</i>
<i>called Sarad.</i>

27
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,723
We've been using them

28
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:05,860
to coordinate the evacuation
of these ANSF interpreters.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,894
But they just...

30
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,965
they stayed too long.

31
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:17,672
-Mike...

32
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,408
look, you didn't
hear this from me,

33
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,442
but they're pushing hundreds

34
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,579
<i>of insurgents into that area.</i>

35
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:25,947
<i>They've already</i>
<i>hit the embassy</i>

36
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,849
in Cabel,
government buildings,

37
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,416
<i>police stations.</i>

38
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,052
<i>They're even trying to dig</i>
<i>into the surrounding villages.</i>

39
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,186
<i>It's like the</i>
<i>TET offensive out there.</i>

40
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,123
<i>The media is saying</i>
<i>it's the Taliban,</i>

41
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,323
<i>but these guys</i>
<i>are getting trucked in</i>

42
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,358
<i>from Pakistan, Syria...</i>

43
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,695
<i>They're cleansing</i>
<i>everything, Mike.</i>

44
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:49,737
<i>This guy is risking</i>
<i>his family's life for us.</i>

45
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,640
<i>It may not mean anything to you,</i>
<i>but it does to me.</i>

46
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,909
I need help.

47
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:04,251
-Let me see what I can do.

48
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:10,058
Just showed up.

49
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,228
-We made it very clear.

50
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,665
We told them to evac
the area immediately.

51
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:21,368
He says he's leaving
tomorrow morning.

52
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,304
-Tell them to get
on the road right now.

53
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,544
-He says he's not leaving
until he evacuates everyone

54
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:32,180
<i>from the village.</i>
-Hold up, hold up.

55
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,413
All right, there is

56
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:38,019
<i>a SOCOM operation</i>
<i>in a village in Kunar.</i>

57
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,620
Let me see
if I can move them.

58
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:41,956
Get you an escort
and extraction.

59
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,891
- Thank you.

60
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,731
Thank you.

61
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,934
<i>This is filing with me.</i>

62
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,102
<i>Soldiers...</i>

63
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,470
-All right,
I need that intel, Mike.

64
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,872
What do you got for me?

65
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:00,608
-Roger that.

66
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,643
All told, I've got
six of them traveling...

67
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,212
-Yeah. Hit me.

68
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,581
-Logan. Make sure
you get all the drives.

69
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,953
-The Reverend
Mathew William Walters,

70
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,856

74
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:25,900
And their kids.

75
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,071
-All right.

76
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:33,373
-William Arthur Walters,

and Zoe Elizabeth Walters,

78

80
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,525
'K.

Come on, guys. We gotta go.

82
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,604
-We got all six
traveling right now

83
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,541
in a dark green '93 Trooper.

84
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:09,544
-Hey.

85
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:12,947
You watch yourself over there.

86
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:18,385
Sir, we're out of clock.

87
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,353

six American missionaries

<i>traveling through</i>
<i>the Kunar Province.</i>

91

<i>They're in a green</i>

Trooper.

93
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,070
<i>They were making a run</i>
<i>for the Pakistani border.</i>

94
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,138
<i>We just heard from them.</i>

95
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:40,074
They got turned around
and they're lost.

96
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,010
<i>We need to send a unit</i>
<i>to link up with them ASAP.</i>

97
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,957

<i>RPG! RPG!</i>

<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if things happen for a reason.</i>

00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:23,951
<i>If it's fate, destiny,</i>
<i>or the hand of God.</i>

103
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:00,708
Team Warhorse,
this is Warhorse One.

104
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:02,076
Give me a sit rep. Over.

105
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:27,601
Team Warhorse, I say again,
this is Warhorse One.

106
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,003
What's your status? Over.

107
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,321

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,677
Anyone Team Warhorse, respond.

111
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:30,931
Castle, this is Warhorse One.

112
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:36,538
This is Chief Mirko.
We have a helo down.

113
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,806
I say again,
we have a helo down.

114
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,175
Do you have eyes
on our position, how copy?

115
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:44,778
<i>We have a helo down.</i>

116
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:47,715
Guys.

117
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:48,649
<i>I say again,</i>
<i>we have a helo down.</i>

118
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,718
<i>Do you have eyes</i>
<i>on our position, how copy?</i>

119
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,587
-Roger, Warhorse,
this is Castle.

120
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,123
We are tracking your position
via UAV. Over.

121
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:04,698
-I was separated from the helo

122
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,101
when we were hit,
but I am on my feet.

123
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,202
I am good to go.

124
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,372
I have contacted my team.

125
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:13,707
I get no comeback on comms.

126
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,876
Are there any guns
up at the crash site?

127
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:26,287
I say again, is anyone moving,
how copy?

128
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:27,721
-Solid copy, Warhorse.

129
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,356
We have eyes
on the crash site

130
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,091
due east
of your current position.

131
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:34,128
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>the helo broke up on impact.</i>

132
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:37,798
We have no observable movement
on FLIR or comms

133
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,967
coming from the crash site.
Over.

134
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,639
<i>I say again, the crash site</i>
<i>is due east of your POS.</i>

135
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,575
<i>Over.</i>

136
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,307
<i>How copy? Over.</i>

137
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:24,845
-Solid copy, Castle.

138
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,285
I am moving to the crash site
to verify.

139
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,589
I've got tangos at 500 meters
to the north.

140
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:39,093
They are pushing the crash site.
I am moving to intercept.

141
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,794
Over.

142
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:41,795
<i>Negative, Warhorse.</i>

143
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,365
I say again, the helo
broke up on impact.

144
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:45,533
Disengage.

145
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,003
-Negative, Castle.

146
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,939
Those are my men in that helo,
and if there are any survivors,

147
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,742
I'm not leaving them
up here to die.

148
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,843
-You have a significant
aggressor force

149
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,979
advancing from your northeast.
Disengage!

150
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,716
<i>We have no movement,</i>
<i>no signatures,</i>

151
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,985
<i>no guns up, you have</i>
<i>no close air support.</i>

152
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,757
<i>Disengage,</i>
<i>fall back, find cover.</i>

153
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:13,861
Oh, they hit them again.

154
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:17,865
-I'm moving to intercept.

155
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:18,733
I'm going to pull them
off the crash site.

156
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,134
Mirko out!

157
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,471
-Negative, Warhorse.
Disengage.

158
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:27,975
Somebody get me Johns!

159
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:36,884
Go get 'em, Master Chief.

160
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:41,523
Let's go.

161
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:03,036
-Gotcha.

162
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:16,483
<i>Castle to Warhorse.</i>

163
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:17,585
<i>Warhorse, do you copy?</i>

164
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,370
<i>Warhorse, this is Castle.</i>

165
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,105
<i>Come in, Warhorse.</i>

166
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,809
-Go for Warhorse. Over.

167
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,610
<i>Be advised,</i>
<i>you have tangos advancing</i>

168
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,814
<i>on your position.</i>
<i>Over.</i>

169
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:47,615
-Roger that. I'm good.

170
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:48,883
-Negative.

171
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,919
That force has a lead element
of 30 to 40 men.

172
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,887
And they are moving quickly
on your position.

173
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,087
Over.

174
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,422
-Roger that. I have time.

175
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,497
-Master Chief, this is Johns.

176
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:04,732
Do you copy?

177
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:11,238
Mirko, do you copy?

178
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,543
-Commander.

179
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:16,977
<i>Master Chief,</i>

180
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,046
you have seconds here and
they're evaporating fast.

181
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,218
We're looking at
the crash site right now.

182
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,522
Your team is gone.

183
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,659
<i>I don't see anybody</i>
<i>moving down there.</i>

184
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,128
You're on your own, son.

185
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,001
Either you break contact
and get moving...

186
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,640
or you're going to die
on that mountain.

187
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,842
-I can live with that.

188
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:49,276
<i>I can live with that.</i>

189
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,481
-Yeah, but I don't want to, son.

190
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,518
<i>I don't need to lose</i>
<i>all my guys today.</i>

191
00:16:56,618 --> 00:17:00,922
Fall back,
come back here, re-group,

192
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,090
and we'll go back in
and bring our boys home.

193
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:06,628
<i>You owe them that.</i>

194
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:09,229
<i>How copy?</i>

195
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,505
<i>Understand, Master Chief?</i>

196
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,643
Mirko, do you copy?

197
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:28,348
-Copy, Commander.

198
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,388
Falling back. Mirko out.

199
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:40,494
-Lieutenant. Reece!

200
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:43,363
Get Vanzant on the horn.
Find out about assets for a QRF.

201
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,900
I want my frogman
off that mountain.

202
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,401
And talk to those
Air Force guys.

203
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:49,037
Tell 'em to sort their shit out.

204
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,506
We need eyes
on this doggone mess.

205
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:52,707
-Yes, sir.

206
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:51,826
-Come on, fuckers.

207
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,223
<i>Warhorse, this is Castle.</i>

208
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,859
<i>Do you copy, Warhorse? Over.</i>

209
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:34,736
-Castle, this is Warhorse.
Not a good time...

210
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,505
-No, fuck that.

211
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:16,951
-I'm a frogman.
You can't drown me.

212
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,021
You can't drown me.

213
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:23,978
Walters.

214
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:26,380
- Help...

215
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:30,552
help me... help me...

216
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:33,120
-Walters.

217
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,922
Relax now.

218
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,358
<c.#ff0000>-Help me. Help me. Help me.</c>
<c.#ff0000>-Walters.</c>

219
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:41,630
All right, relax.

220
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:42,663
-Please.

221
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:46,333
Not me! Not me.

222
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:47,768
Her.

223
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:50,171
Her. Help her.

224
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:53,807
Her.

225
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:07,021
-Shit.

226
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:12,193
Shit.

227
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:51,365
Zoe?

228
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,868
-Ssssh, Mama's sleeping.

229
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:01,208
-Are you Zoe?

230
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:03,477
-Mama says
we're going to be okay.

231
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:05,279
We're going here.

232
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:22,463
-No, we're
not going there yet.

233
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:29,370
You see that?

234
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:35,209
That's where it's safe.

235
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:37,211
-Up there?

236
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:41,982
-Yeah, and my friends
are coming to meet us.

237
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,421
-We have to wait
until she wakes up.

238
00:29:54,028 --> 00:29:55,429
-We should let her sleep.

239
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:01,235
It's okay.
She'll meet us up there.

240
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:09,678
We gotta go now.

241
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:12,079
It's okay. Come on.

242
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:47,174
Kid, let's go.

243
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:50,244
-You're not my papa.

244
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:00,555
-Listen, kid.

245
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,526
When all this is over,
we can be friends.

246
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:07,461
Until then, I'm in charge.

247
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:10,330
Got it?

248
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:15,469
Move out.

249
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:21,455
Hey, that's mine.

250
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,460
-Yeah,
and if somebody spots it,

251
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:27,795
it will give away our position.

252
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,483
You can take this one.

253
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:10,404
-Papa says
guns don't solve problems.

254
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:12,439
-Yeah.

255
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,544
That's why
you always carry a knife.

256
00:36:20,982 --> 00:36:24,719
-He told me you can't fight
evil stuff with evil stuff.

257
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,690
-Kid,
I'm one of the good guys.

258
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:32,026
Those guys back there
that hurt your papa,

259
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:33,961
those are the bad guys.

260
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:36,296
-Why,
because they're Muslims?

261
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:44,471
-I don't care
what they believe in.

262
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:50,210
If you're intentionally
killing innocent people,

263
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,913
then you're the bad guys.

264
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,287
Come on. We gotta go.

265
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,181
Kid, don't move...

266
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:21,155
You see this?

267
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,996
This is why you don't
run around like a wild girl.

268
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:33,100
There's tons of bad stuff
like this out here.

269
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,837
-Okay. What is it?

270
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:38,572
-It's a bad thing.

271
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:41,776
When that pin comes out,

272
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:45,746
it sets this fuse off
that detonates this bomb.

273
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:46,881
-Oh.

274
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:55,356
Listen, no matter what you see,

275
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:59,360
or what you hear,
if I put you somewhere,

276
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,630
you stay there
and you stay quiet.

277
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:07,401
'Cause of the bad guys?

278
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,771
- Yeah.
Yeah, because of the bad guys.

279
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,547
All right, we should
get out of here.

280
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:12,026
-Psst! Now go.

281
00:44:57,164 --> 00:44:58,232
-You're bleeding.

282
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:04,104
- It's not mine.

283
00:45:05,507 --> 00:45:06,740
Come on, we gotta go.

284
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,978
Come on!

285
00:45:57,925 --> 00:45:59,126
-You left me.

286
00:46:12,574 --> 00:46:13,474
You left me.

287
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:26,387
-I'm sorry, kid.

288
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:29,156
It won't happen again.

289
00:46:31,225 --> 00:46:32,159
-Promise?

290
00:46:33,762 --> 00:46:35,229
-Promise.

291
00:47:02,323 --> 00:47:04,024
Let's go.

292
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:08,563
Come on, kid.

293
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,290
-It's okay, they're gone.

294
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,661
What?

295
00:48:49,496 --> 00:48:52,667
-They killed Billy.
The one with the hat.

296
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:56,937
The one with the scar.

297
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:02,710
-I'll remember 'em.

298
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,519
All right, come on.
We should go.

299
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,795
Hey. I'll be right back.

300
00:49:53,895 --> 00:49:55,062
-No, wait!

301
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:58,265
-It's okay.

302
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:01,669
I'm just going to go take
a peek at the next ridge.

303
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:05,573
We made a promise.

304
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:12,012
Sit here, don't move,
and don't make a sound.

305
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,977
Castle, this is Warhorse One,
do you copy?

306
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:44,746
Over.

307
00:50:48,883 --> 00:50:52,754
Castle, this is Warhorse One.
Do you read me? Over.

308
00:50:52,854 --> 00:50:53,621
-Warhorse, this is Castle.

309
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:57,025
We have you Lima Charlie,
how copy. Over.

310
00:50:57,157 --> 00:50:59,694
-Good copy,
good fucking copy. Over.

311
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:08,803
-Bad comms. Over.

312
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:10,672
-Roger. Command needs a sit rep.

313
00:51:10,772 --> 00:51:12,105
What's your status?

314
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:17,645
-I have a heavy aggressor
force hunting me and my AO.

315
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:20,515
I need immediate evac. Over.

316
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:22,684
-Roger that. What is your
current pos?

317
00:51:26,588 --> 00:51:30,424
-I am one kilometer past Giants
pushing to Raiders.

318
00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:33,595
I have one mission objective.

319
00:51:33,695 --> 00:51:34,696
I say again, I have one

320
00:51:34,796 --> 00:51:39,834
<i>small objective,</i>
<i>need immediate extraction.</i>

321
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:41,501
How copy?

322
00:51:41,603 --> 00:51:43,838
<i>Good copy on</i>
<i>the objective, updating now.</i>

323
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:47,642
<i>We have no air assets</i>
<i>available in theater.</i>

324
00:51:47,742 --> 00:51:50,011
<i>Looking for birds</i>
<i>to allocate your direction</i>

325
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,445
but you will have to stand by.

326
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:54,381
We are dealing with
heavy TIC at this time.

327
00:51:55,683 --> 00:51:56,751
-Roger that.

328
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,355
I'll wait for further. Over.

329
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:02,289
<i>We understand the urgency</i>

331
00:52:03,858 --> 00:52:06,259
You will have to stand by.

332
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,096
<i>Hold what you got,</i>
<i>and we will contact you</i>

333

334
00:52:12,399 --> 00:52:14,636
-Oh six hundred, Castle?

335
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:16,203
-Affirmative, Warhorse.

336
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:18,472
That's the best
we can do at this time.

337
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:27,048
<i>Roger that, Castle.</i>

338
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:29,617
Advise if you can
implement sooner.

339
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:30,618
Warhorse One out.

340
00:52:33,353 --> 00:52:36,057
-Roger. Castle out.

341
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,692
-Reece,
what's the word on Vanzant?

342
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:40,128
-No word yet, sir.

343
00:52:40,227 --> 00:52:42,195
-Give me a phone.
I'll call him myself.

344
00:53:37,785 --> 00:53:38,686
-Whatcha doing?

345
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:43,658
-A little surprise
for the bad guys.

346
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:45,292
Come on, it's time to rack out.

347
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:13,755
-Are we going to die?

348
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:18,291
-No, we're going to
be just fine.

349
00:54:22,597 --> 00:54:24,599
We just have to make it
to the top of that mountain.

350
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:29,402
-How did you know
I was here?

351
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:33,608
-We were in the area
looking for someone.

352
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:37,178
-Looking for a bad guy?

353
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:40,280
-Yeah, looking for
a bad guy.

354
00:54:41,616 --> 00:54:44,085
Then we got the redirect
that your family

355
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:48,656
was trying to escape the area,
so we came looking for you.

356
00:54:50,191 --> 00:54:51,324
-We?

357
00:54:53,628 --> 00:54:55,362
-Yeah, my friends and I.

358
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:00,768
-Where are your friends now?

359
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:06,741
-Our helicopter
was shot down.

360
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,811
-What about you?

361
00:55:13,848 --> 00:55:15,917
-I fell out
before it crashed.

362
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:21,354
-You fell from the sky?
Like an angel?

363
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:29,429
I'm no angel.

364
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:34,702
-You're my angel.

365
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:51,418
I hope the bad guys
don't get us.

366
00:55:54,055 --> 00:55:54,989
-They won't.

367
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:05,032
Time for bed, kid.

368
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:15,543
-Can you tell me a story?

369
00:56:17,912 --> 00:56:21,616
-A story, huh?
What kinda story?

370
00:56:23,117 --> 00:56:25,519
-I like superheroes.

371
00:56:26,654 --> 00:56:28,055
-Superheroes, huh?

372
00:56:33,094 --> 00:56:34,862
I got a hero story for ya.

373
00:56:36,998 --> 00:56:39,800
It's about the bravest man
I've ever met.

374
00:56:41,168 --> 00:56:42,904
Aziz Latiri.

375
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:46,674
He was a Muslim.

376
00:56:49,911 --> 00:56:50,645
One day...

377
00:56:50,745 --> 00:56:52,747
-No, once upon a time.

378
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:58,719
-Okay.
Once upon a time,

379
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:03,224
in a faraway place
called Kirkuk,

380
00:57:03,324 --> 00:57:07,427
me and my friends
were pinned down

381
00:57:07,528 --> 00:57:09,864
and surrounded by enemies.

382
00:57:11,565 --> 00:57:13,734
And it didn't look good for us.

383
00:57:19,774 --> 00:57:21,742
I didn't think we were
gonna make it out.

384
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:33,955
And all of a sudden,
a truck pulled up,

385
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:39,627
and a guy jumped out,
a peshmerga fighter,

386
00:57:42,563 --> 00:57:45,566
and he gave us cover
and allowed me and my friends

387
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:47,034
to get outta there.

388
00:57:51,505 --> 00:57:53,574
At first I thought
he was just crazy.

389
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:01,682
And then I realized
he was just really brave.

390
00:58:08,556 --> 00:58:10,524
He saved our lives that day.

391
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,274
Rest your soul, Aziz.

392
00:58:32,413 --> 00:58:33,581
Rest your soul.

393
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:08,049
<i>Team Warhorse.</i>

394
00:59:08,149 --> 00:59:11,552
<i>Change of plans, boys.</i>
<i>Robin Hood is a push.</i>

395
00:59:11,652 --> 00:59:12,853
<i>We have a new objective.</i>

396
00:59:12,953 --> 00:59:15,589
<i>We need an immediate</i>
<i>extraction of U.S. citizens.</i>

397
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:17,526
<i>They are traveling</i>
<i>in a green Trooper</i>

398
00:59:17,658 --> 00:59:20,861
<i>heading east on Nangala Road.</i>
<i>Six friendlies.</i>

399
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:23,697
<i>William Walters, male, 45.</i>

400
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:26,600
<i>Rasheeda Walters, female, 41.</i>

401
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,904
<i>Child, William, male, 13.</i>

402
00:59:30,004 --> 00:59:34,041
<i>Child, Zoe, female, five.</i>

403
00:59:34,141 --> 00:59:36,343
<i>Hostiles have been</i>
<i>spotted in the area.</i>

404
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:39,013
<i>Good luck, Mirko.</i>

405
00:59:45,453 --> 00:59:46,353
-Junior, you good?

406
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:50,958
Relax, kid.

407
00:59:55,496 --> 00:59:57,064
One minute, boys.

408
00:59:58,365 --> 00:59:59,266
-RPG! RPG!

409
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:14,215
-Wake up. Wake up, kid.

410
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:34,869
Let's go.

411
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:42,143
-Who's that?

412
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:19,440
-Snap out of it, kid.
We gotta go.

413
01:02:22,009 --> 01:02:24,713
Kid! Snap out of it, let's go!

414
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:37,351
We gotta go.

415
01:04:40,381 --> 01:04:41,248
-Go ahead.

416
01:04:41,348 --> 01:04:42,282
-Ha!

417
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:47,254
-Come here.

418
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:52,426
Grip it tight.

419
01:04:53,394 --> 01:04:54,562
That way,
in case you gotta swing,

420
01:04:54,662 --> 01:04:56,564
it won't fall outta your hand.

421
01:04:57,632 --> 01:05:01,902
When you're ready to throw it,
loosen your grip,

422
01:05:02,002 --> 01:05:06,940
imagine you're
cutting through your target,

423
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,411
and drive the tip of that blade

424
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:12,647
right into the center
of that target.

425
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:15,617
Got it?

426
01:05:18,887 --> 01:05:20,320
Ha!

427
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:23,424
-Better.

428
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:32,634
Now try it with this.

429
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:37,271
It's okay.

430
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:47,080
-Ha!

431
01:05:53,721 --> 01:05:54,955
-Not bad, kid.

432
01:05:59,928 --> 01:06:01,061
Get your bag.

433
01:07:31,251 --> 01:07:32,419
-It's nothing.

434
01:07:37,025 --> 01:07:38,425
It's nothing.

435
01:08:10,457 --> 01:08:11,626
-No.

436
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:33,848
What's that?

437
01:08:39,186 --> 01:08:40,454
-It's gum.

438
01:08:44,926 --> 01:08:46,561
Chew it. Don't swallow it.

439
01:08:57,639 --> 01:08:58,873
Good, huh?

440
01:08:58,973 --> 01:08:59,907
-Mm-hm.

441
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:51,224
-What's her name?

442
01:09:53,828 --> 01:09:54,796
-It's a boy.

443
01:09:58,132 --> 01:09:59,534
-What's his name?

444
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:01,969
-Louie.

445
01:10:04,706 --> 01:10:05,640
-Louie.

446
01:10:07,141 --> 01:10:08,442
That's a good name.

447
01:10:10,111 --> 01:10:11,913
-Billy says
it's a dumb name.

448
01:10:12,013 --> 01:10:14,247
A noonkie name.

449
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:15,750
-Noonkie name, huh?

450
01:10:18,052 --> 01:10:19,486
I like it.

451
01:10:21,288 --> 01:10:24,826
-Mama told me
when we got back to America,

452
01:10:24,926 --> 01:10:27,528
she would get me a real Louie.

453
01:10:34,301 --> 01:10:36,303
I miss Mama.

454
01:10:41,274 --> 01:10:42,409
-I know.

455
01:10:44,078 --> 01:10:46,581
-I know she's not sleeping.

456
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:12,339
She's gone,
like Papa and Billy.

457
01:11:17,178 --> 01:11:18,813
-It's just
a part of life, kid.

458
01:11:20,347 --> 01:11:21,983
Everybody dies.

459
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:26,754
-Even us?

460
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:35,362
-Yeah.

461
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:39,567
But not here.

462
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:43,671
Not yet.

463
01:11:56,017 --> 01:11:57,585
I'm gonna get us outta here.

464
01:14:03,811 --> 01:14:04,745
-Pst.

465
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:39,413
-It's very dangerous here.

466
01:14:39,513 --> 01:14:43,918
Where is your Papa and Mama?

467
01:14:44,018 --> 01:14:46,988
You shouldn't be here
by yourself.

468
01:14:47,088 --> 01:14:48,889
-I'm not. I'm with him.

469
01:15:04,438 --> 01:15:06,707
-Please, don't shoot.

470
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:10,911
I--I'm a simple goat herder,
searching my goat.

471
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:19,353
-This is a dangerous place.

472
01:15:19,453 --> 01:15:20,454
You shouldn't be here.

473
01:15:20,554 --> 01:15:22,723
-Drop that Burner, fucker.

474
01:15:23,724 --> 01:15:27,595
-Here. Take it, take it.

475
01:15:28,763 --> 01:15:32,166
I use it for protection
against the Daesh bastards.

476
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:36,337
I can help you get out of here.

477
01:15:36,437 --> 01:15:38,606
My village is not
too far from here.

478
01:15:38,706 --> 01:15:40,641
Right in the next valley, huh?

479
01:15:53,754 --> 01:15:55,890
Yes, I will help.

480
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,024
Come, I help.

481
01:16:03,264 --> 01:16:04,165
-Turn around.

482
01:16:17,478 --> 01:16:18,379
You look
in the wrong direction,

483
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:20,581
I will fucking kill you,
you understand?

484
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:26,387
-I help you.
I help you. I help you.

485
01:16:26,487 --> 01:16:27,621
-Go.

486
01:17:20,174 --> 01:17:23,578
-The village
is not far from here.

487
01:17:23,677 --> 01:17:25,379
My village.

488
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:30,519
Daesh came in a few days ago,
like a brush fire.

489
01:17:30,619 --> 01:17:32,820
They left and now
they back again.

490
01:17:39,894 --> 01:17:40,961
-You from here?

491
01:17:42,129 --> 01:17:45,666
-No, from Pakistan,
but my papa move us here

492
01:17:45,766 --> 01:17:50,704
when I was a boy.
So no, I was not born here.

493
01:17:50,804 --> 01:17:53,174
But I will die here, inshallah.

494
01:17:53,274 --> 01:17:58,613
What about you, my friend?
Why are you here?

495
01:17:58,712 --> 01:17:59,880
-Just visiting.

496
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,884
-Very dangerous place
to visit by yourself.

497
01:18:03,984 --> 01:18:05,452
-Yeah, the world's
a dangerous place.

498
01:18:05,554 --> 01:18:07,021
<i>Warhorse, this is Castle.</i>

499
01:18:08,756 --> 01:18:10,659
<i>How copy, over.</i>

500
01:18:10,758 --> 01:18:13,861
-Even for Special Forces.
-Shut the fuck up.

501
01:18:13,961 --> 01:18:15,196
Go for Warhorse. Over.

502
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:22,736
<i>Roger,</i>
<i>Warhorse. Good copy. Over.</i>

503
01:18:22,836 --> 01:18:24,171
-Yeah, you're late. Over.

504
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:25,507
-Roger that, Warhorse.

505
01:18:25,607 --> 01:18:27,474
Sketchy comms on our end
at this time.

506
01:18:27,576 --> 01:18:31,812
We do have a 160th air asset
available out of Jalalabad.

507
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:36,350
-Outstanding, Castle.

508
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:37,519
I have the package in tow,

509
01:18:37,619 --> 01:18:39,253
and we are heading
to the exfil. Over.

510
01:18:42,723 --> 01:18:43,625
-Roger, Warhorse.

511
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:45,092
What is your current pos?

512
01:18:45,192 --> 01:18:47,194
-We are four kilometers past
Raiders, ready to go home.

513
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:48,229
Over.

514
01:18:54,636 --> 01:18:57,606
-Do you have exfil grid?
Over.

515
01:18:57,706 --> 01:19:00,975
-Three-five-five, how copy.
Over.

516
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:03,612
<i>Got it, confirmed.</i>

517
01:19:03,712 --> 01:19:05,879
Confirmed extract

519
01:19:07,047 --> 01:19:08,749
-Roger that. Warhorse out.

520
01:19:08,849 --> 01:19:11,185
-Roger, Warhorse. Castle out.

521
01:19:14,288 --> 01:19:15,889
-Good news?

522
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:16,924
-Yeah, you could say that.

523
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:21,228
-Oh, good, good.
I am happy for you.

524
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:26,300
-Hey, kid.
You ready to go home?

525
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:37,144
Stay down, kid.

526
01:21:51,278 --> 01:21:52,913
-Aaah!

527
01:21:54,281 --> 01:21:55,683
Aaah!

528
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:20,073
-Kid.

529
01:22:26,413 --> 01:22:27,414
Kid!

530
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:39,661
All right, kid.

531
01:22:41,896 --> 01:22:42,996
All right, kid.

532
01:26:06,134 --> 01:26:08,536
-Don't be afraid,
little child.

533
01:26:10,237 --> 01:26:11,539
I won't hurt you.

534
01:26:13,273 --> 01:26:14,776
What is your name?

535
01:26:21,883 --> 01:26:23,383
What is this?

536
01:26:26,621 --> 01:26:28,221
-It's Papa's.

537
01:26:29,724 --> 01:26:32,827
-Oh, it's nice.

538
01:29:22,429 --> 01:29:23,764
-Zoe?

539
01:29:48,923 --> 01:29:52,994
<i>No! No! No! No!</i>

540
01:30:26,394 --> 01:30:29,330
Oh! Oh, the girl.

541
01:30:29,429 --> 01:30:31,899
She is close.
I will take you.

542
01:30:33,367 --> 01:30:34,535
-Up.

543
01:30:47,447 --> 01:30:48,683
Hold.

544
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:58,592
-What the fuck
are you guys doing?

545
01:31:07,201 --> 01:31:08,501
Showtime, big boy.

546
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:23,517
Allah Akbar.

547
01:34:47,721 --> 01:34:50,324
There is a storm coming.

548
01:35:25,694 --> 01:35:26,860
-Junior?

549
01:35:31,666 --> 01:35:32,933
Kobe?

550
01:37:23,745 --> 01:37:25,012
-Where is she?

551
01:37:26,681 --> 01:37:28,282
-Never you worry about her.

552
01:37:30,785 --> 01:37:33,387
You know, I admire
your strength.

553
01:37:35,155 --> 01:37:38,660
It must be very painful
to be here all alone,

554
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,061
with none of your soldiers
to help you.

555
01:37:44,766 --> 01:37:45,933
Jarrah.

556
01:38:08,455 --> 01:38:10,257
Tell me when and where
your helicopter

557
01:38:10,357 --> 01:38:13,595
is coming for you.
And I'll let you live.

558
01:38:15,563 --> 01:38:17,064
-What helicopter?

559
01:38:22,436 --> 01:38:24,905
-Do you think
you are playing with me?

560
01:38:37,251 --> 01:38:40,555
-So I tell you
where my helicopter is coming,

561
01:38:40,655 --> 01:38:41,989
so you can kill more of my men.

562
01:38:42,089 --> 01:38:44,692
-You have killed
thousands of my brothers.

563
01:38:44,793 --> 01:38:47,695
Civilians.
Innocent women, children.

564
01:38:47,796 --> 01:38:48,897
For what?

565
01:38:51,064 --> 01:38:55,302
For the poppies, the pipelines?

566
01:38:55,402 --> 01:38:58,640
Or just another financed
puppet government?

567
01:39:00,307 --> 01:39:02,510
-I think it's just
to kill shitheads like you.

568
01:39:06,146 --> 01:39:10,050
-Afghanistan
is the graveyard of empires.

569
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:12,921
Slaughtered invaders
throughout history.

570
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:17,625
Alexander, the Khans,
the Persians, British,

571
01:39:17,725 --> 01:39:22,963
Soviets, and the West
will suffer the same fate.

572
01:39:30,872 --> 01:39:33,407
You American scum.

573
01:39:34,576 --> 01:39:38,913
Sending assassins to kill us
in our peaceful villages.

574
01:39:39,012 --> 01:39:41,215
-This ain't your village,
asshole.

575
01:39:43,116 --> 01:39:46,588
- It is now.

576
01:39:49,356 --> 01:39:51,358
-And you ain't
from Afghanistan...

577
01:39:54,228 --> 01:39:55,763
but you're gonna die here.

578
01:40:01,268 --> 01:40:03,538
-And so will you, American.

579
01:40:05,707 --> 01:40:07,241
And so will you.

580
01:40:50,417 --> 01:40:51,819
-You like, little girl?

581
01:41:07,569 --> 01:41:08,770
You like?

582
01:41:12,172 --> 01:41:13,575
You like, little girl?

583
01:41:20,014 --> 01:41:22,584
Come. Come.

584
01:41:27,689 --> 01:41:29,389
Come.

585
01:41:29,489 --> 01:41:30,390
Come!

586
01:41:42,637 --> 01:41:43,538
-Peeky boo!

587
01:41:45,907 --> 01:41:47,174
-Peeky boo!

588
01:42:22,076 --> 01:42:25,479
-You are both going to die
for your transgressions today.

589
01:43:16,597 --> 01:43:17,632
-Zoe?

590
01:46:42,803 --> 01:46:43,971
This is mine, fucker.

591
01:46:45,539 --> 01:46:48,309
-Warhorse One, this is Castle.
Over.

592
01:46:48,408 --> 01:46:50,443
Listen, Master Chief, I'm not
sure if you're reading this,

593
01:46:50,544 --> 01:46:51,979
but there's a large group
of reinforcements

594
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:54,215
inbound on the village.

595
01:46:54,315 --> 01:46:55,283
-Any luck, Reece?

596
01:46:55,383 --> 01:46:57,652
-Negative contact, sir.

597
01:46:57,752 --> 01:46:59,320
-How close
are those reinforcements?

598
01:46:59,419 --> 01:47:01,956
-If he's in the village, sir,
they're almost on top of him.

599
01:47:10,998 --> 01:47:12,867
Aaah!

600
01:47:26,814 --> 01:47:28,015
-Papa!

601
01:47:29,482 --> 01:47:30,952
-Hey, kid.

602
01:48:23,771 --> 01:48:25,505
-I told you
I'd never leave you.

603
01:48:34,849 --> 01:48:37,651
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

604
01:48:53,467 --> 01:48:54,602
All right, come on.

605
01:49:07,681 --> 01:49:09,250
Stay down, kid.

606
01:49:29,637 --> 01:49:31,238
Stay! Ears!

607
01:51:07,801 --> 01:51:10,137
-Come on.
Come on, get up.

608
01:51:12,173 --> 01:51:15,476
- Go!

609
01:51:23,184 --> 01:51:24,151
-Come on.

610
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:33,187
-Get behind the plates.

611
01:52:33,287 --> 01:52:36,323
Get behind the vest.
Get behind the plates.

612
01:52:38,292 --> 01:52:39,628
Okay.

613
01:53:28,409 --> 01:53:29,343
-Come on.

614
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:34,582
It's okay, we'll be okay.

615
01:54:07,749 --> 01:54:09,850
-No, it's okay.

616
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:13,655
It's okay.

617
01:54:13,755 --> 01:54:15,222
You're my angel.

618
01:54:17,958 --> 01:54:19,460
You're my angel.

619
01:54:21,929 --> 01:54:22,797
You're my angel.

620
01:54:40,013 --> 01:54:41,382
-We're going to be okay.

621
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,221
You're my angel.

622
01:54:53,762 --> 01:54:56,430
On line! On line!

623
01:55:27,928 --> 01:55:30,364
On line!
On line! On line!

624
01:56:20,481 --> 01:56:23,283
-Mirko...
look at me, brother.

625
01:56:23,383 --> 01:56:24,552
Eyes on me.

626
01:56:28,021 --> 01:56:28,923
Are you hit?

627
01:56:29,022 --> 01:56:30,324
-Yeah, my back.

628
01:56:35,897 --> 01:56:38,131
Woodsy!
We're going critical.

629
01:56:38,232 --> 01:56:39,767
We need to get
the fuck off the x.

630
01:56:44,071 --> 01:56:47,775
-No, the girl.
Get the girl outta here.

631
01:56:54,883 --> 01:56:55,817
The package.

632
01:56:55,917 --> 01:56:56,885
I got the package.

633
01:56:56,985 --> 01:56:57,986
Roach!

634
01:57:09,564 --> 01:57:10,598
Little help!

635
01:57:12,199 --> 01:57:14,501
Clean, 150 meters,
two o'clock.

636
01:57:14,602 --> 01:57:15,737
I don't have a shot.

637
01:57:26,748 --> 01:57:27,682
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>these guys are buggin' out</i>

638
01:57:27,782 --> 01:57:28,683
<i>and going home, chief.</i>

639
01:57:28,783 --> 01:57:30,050
You're clear to move.

640
01:57:31,151 --> 01:57:32,620
Roger that! Clean!

641
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:33,721
Take us out.

642
01:57:46,099 --> 01:57:48,068
Move! Let's go, let's go!!!

643
01:58:23,738 --> 01:58:26,273
<i>Reaper, this is Bladerunner.</i>

644
01:58:26,373 --> 01:58:29,577
<i>We have a full head count.</i>
<i>We're headed to your pos now.</i>

645
01:58:29,677 --> 01:58:30,678
<i>Over.</i>

646
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:05,546
<i>I still don't know</i>
<i>if things happen for a reason.</i>

647
01:59:05,647 --> 01:59:12,185
<i>Whether it's fate,</i>
<i>destiny, or the hand of God.</i>

648
01:59:14,856 --> 01:59:18,191
<i>But what happened</i>
<i>that day changed me.</i>

649
01:59:20,028 --> 01:59:22,630
<i>I lost a piece of myself</i>
<i>that day.</i>

650
01:59:26,199 --> 01:59:30,404
<i>But I also gained something.</i>
<i>Someone.</i>

651
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:37,812
<i>Someone who reminded me</i>
<i>that the things in life</i>

652
01:59:37,912 --> 01:59:39,479
<i>worth living for...</i>

653
01:59:42,182 --> 01:59:43,651
<i>are worth dying for.</i>

654
01:59:54,896 --> 01:59:57,565
<i>I could never replace</i>
<i>the family she lost,</i>

655
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:03,270
<i>but Louie and I</i>
<i>will do our best.</i>

656
02:00:05,873 --> 02:00:07,709
<i>She's my everything now.</i>

657
02:00:08,976 --> 02:00:10,745
<i>She's my family.</i>

658
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:19,219
<i>And for the brothers</i>
<i>I lost that day...</i>

659
02:00:20,521 --> 02:00:24,491
<i>for them,</i>
<i>there will be a reckoning.</i>
