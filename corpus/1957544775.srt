you do at film school.

This is your graduation film.

a great deal of
powerful images

427
00:28:56,316 --> 00:28:58,416
and images of Sunderland,

428
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,950
that idea for a story
in Sunderland.

429
00:29:00,984 --> 00:29:02,817
And there was
an engagement with...

430
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,017
With life, with...

431
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:06,216
With people's lives.

432
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,850

a title,

462
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,216

archly have a subtitle,

464
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,083
But there are no
scene headings.

465
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:28,083
So... So are we now
discussing the layout

466
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:30,116
of the script
as a reason?

467
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:32,283
HEAD OF DIRECTING: The layout
captures the precision

468
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:35,216
with which you're thinking
about your project.

469
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,216
It's very unclear how you're
helping your collaborators

470
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,883
find their way through
your proposed set of images.

471
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:44,149
What it is you're trying to...
To photograph.

472
00:30:44,183 --> 00:30:46,883
And then behind that,
I think our deeper concern

473
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,949
is that there's also a lack of
precision about your thinking.

474
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:51,049
What your intentions are.

475
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,350
What you're hoping to express
and to explore here.

I'm sorry, Julie, but...

477
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:02,350
If you pursue this film
as you present it to us now,

478
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:06,049

the school cannot support you

479
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,283
and will not support you.

480
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:10,016
Is it... Presumably, there's
a technician who takes the...

481
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:11,983
Who actually takes
the film things, is it?

482
00:31:12,016 --> 00:31:13,850
Well, no, not really.
I mean, yeah,

and people that look after...

484
00:31:16,116 --> 00:31:17,783
No, no. But I mean the person
behind the camera is a...

485
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:19,116
Is an expert, are they?

486
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:20,883

they're students.

For the set.

690
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:23,317
- Oh, for your film?
- Yeah, that's what I said.

691
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,850
Oh! Right.

692
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,317
So is it going
to your school?

693
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,984
- Yeah.
- Wow.

694
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:32,251
- Yeah.
- When is that?

695
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:34,184
Like, next week we start.

696
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:35,416
- Next week?
- Yeah.

697
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:38,150
- Yeah.
- Oh.

698
00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:43,084
Okay. I didn't realize
it was that soon.

699
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,150
Next week.

700
00:40:47,383 --> 00:40:49,383
So everything's set with it?

701
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,950
Yeah, more or less.

702
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:55,749
Like, casting's set?

703
00:40:56,917 --> 00:40:59,850
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah...

704
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:01,416
I was...
I wanted to talk to you

705
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,984
about it actually,
'cause I... (SIGHS)

706
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:06,316
'Cause you know
I've been going for castings

707
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,883
- and it's not been going well.
- Yeah.

708
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,284
Well, not like, badly,
but not...

709
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:14,416
I'm not getting parts
for things.

710
00:41:18,117 --> 00:41:20,284
So you're...
You're saying you've cast it?

711
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:25,017
Yeah, I have two people
that are...

712
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,050
They're really, you know...
They're quite right for it.

713
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,550
But I...
It's got nothing to do with you.

714
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,184
That's the thing...
It's got nothing to do...

715
00:41:31,217 --> 00:41:32,817
So you've not...
So I'm not in it at all?

716
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:34,383
Not this one.

717
00:41:35,283 --> 00:41:37,984
- And it was such a...
- Okay.

718
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:39,416
I just, I honestly...

719
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,483
It... It's got literally...
It's got nothing to do with...

720
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:45,184
You're such
a fantastic actress.

721
00:41:45,217 --> 00:41:46,350
It's nothing to do

722
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:47,984
- with your abilities, or...
- Mm-hmm.

723
00:41:49,283 --> 00:41:50,450
It's just...

724
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,350
You know, the girl
who I have in mind,

725
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:56,483
she...
She's not an actress.

726
00:41:56,516 --> 00:41:57,550
You know,
she's a filmmaker and...

727
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,783
- She's not an actress?
- No.

728
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:00,950
But she's a filmmaker
and that...

729
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:02,883
I kind of wanted that,

730
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:06,450
so she can bring a little bit
of her own experience to it.

731
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:08,416
ELISA: Mm-hmm.

732
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,450
- Okay. Well...
- But it's got...

733
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:12,050
It's got nothing to do
with you. And I didn't...

734
00:42:12,084 --> 00:42:13,117
Well, it does.

735
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,984
If you're not casting me
in something, then it's me.

736
00:42:15,017 --> 00:42:17,416
You don't... I'm not...
I'm not gonna take it personally,

737
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,217
but don't say it's got
nothing to do with you,

738
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,483
'cause obviously,
casting's completely

739
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:21,883
- to do with the person.
- Okay. Okay, well...

- Looks great.
- I feel comfortable.

- Yeah?
- SUSAN: Mmm.

755
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,883
Can we introduce you
to the DP, Ben?

- Ben, this is Pete.

- Hey, man.
- Pleasure to meet you, mate.

- How's it going?
- Lovely to meet you.

00:44:04,084 --> 00:44:05,250
- There.
- BEN: There?

760
00:44:05,283 --> 00:44:06,850
- A little bit up, please.
- Up?

Perfect, no,

about being too steady,

but also, you know,
not too documentary. So...

BEN: But don't worry about...
Okay.

is so awkward to me for...

If we hear a little...

- Yeah.

anyway.

are we gonna...</i>

776
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,083
I feel like my energy
was too high,

777
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:51,883
or too lively.
I don't know how to say that.

778
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:52,950
Do you know what I mean?

779
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:54,483
I... I thought
it was quite lively.

780
00:44:56,383 --> 00:44:58,250
I was really happy.
So it's...

781
00:44:58,283 --> 00:45:00,116
It is quite accurate.
It's really good.

782
00:45:00,149 --> 00:45:02,783
But you're much more...

00:45:02,817 --> 00:45:04,050
No, you're perfect.
You're perfect.

00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:05,017
You have nothing
to worry about.

Are we all set up now?
Are we ready for a shot?

786
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,850
Yes, we're ready.
Ready when you are.

787
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:11,783
Because I... I'm just looking
at this and I actually think

788
00:45:11,817 --> 00:45:15,250
it's the wrong angle for what we're...
For what I want.

789
00:45:15,283 --> 00:45:18,416
That I...
I actually, um...

790
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:21,383
I... I think we should have it
on the other side of the door,

791
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:22,883
because it feels
wrong to me

792
00:45:22,917 --> 00:45:25,483
that we should have
this camera

793
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:27,850
seeing more
than she does.

794
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:30,183
Because I don't want to see
exactly what's going on

795
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:31,850
inside this bathroom
because she doesn't.

796
00:45:31,883 --> 00:45:32,950

797
00:45:32,984 --> 00:45:34,116
I know that's
a last minute thing.

Do we see in the bathroom?

Maybe here.

805
00:45:48,283 --> 00:45:49,316
Here, because
she has to come...

- She has to come past.
- BEN: Okay.

inside the bathroom.

- For a year.

But also you...
Yeah, for a year.

813

For a year,
but also you have suspicion.

You also don't really
want to believe this.

This is an easier thing,
you know...

816
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,817
It's not an easy thing
to believe

about someone you love.

- No, I don't.

- Well, it's, you know...
- Well, it's...

821
00:46:20,984 --> 00:46:24,917
You're saying you don't want
to believe it, I guess, but...

822
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,551
- Yeah. I can understand that.
- But this is the furthest...

This is just one of the
times we are seeing...

824
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:34,016
You have a feeling as though
when you were dancing together

825
00:46:34,049 --> 00:46:35,517
and during that whole time,
during that whole day,

826
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:37,216
during dinner,
doing whatever you were doing

827
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,484
before you started dancing,
before we saw you,

00:46:39,517 --> 00:46:41,250
that is going on
in the back of his head,

829
00:46:41,283 --> 00:46:43,350
he is wondering
when is the next time

830
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,817
he's going to go off
by himself

831
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:47,016
and do whatever he does,

832
00:46:47,049 --> 00:46:49,383
that you don't really
properly know what goes on.

833
00:46:50,983 --> 00:46:53,416
Because I give him space
and I respect him.

834
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,416
So I...
There's this sense of...

835
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,416
You do, but also,
he doesn't...

836
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,250
He doesn't really allow
anything else.

837
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,484
- Fine.
- So that's...

838

You are doing
as much as you can.

839
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:03,183
You can say that
in this relationship,

he has...
He has the power.

some knocking.

I'll find that out.

844
00:47:09,283 --> 00:47:11,850

some knocking. Um...

by the way, Ben.

There's a lot of wall.

what I can put up there, man.

something in the bedroom.

this scene go?

with that like,

00:47:35,116 --> 00:47:37,149
Then we have to
maybe sit in...

857
00:47:37,183 --> 00:47:38,916
In the bathroom
and start talking and maybe...

858
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:40,850
No. You wouldn't
talk about it.

859
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:43,049
Honestly, I don't think you'd
talk about it straight away.

860
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,350
- You don't want any dialogue?

00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,417
No. Honestly,
it's not about that.

can we get cast in there

You didn't say anything.

You're...
You're irritated by him.

883
00:48:54,451 --> 00:48:57,551
He was like a child
rushing off.

884
00:48:57,584 --> 00:48:59,351
You know, you're
in an adult relationship

885

sadness in there?

"Quite a bit."
So that was...

889
00:49:07,183 --> 00:49:09,283
Maybe that's why he,

Maybe that's why

I don't know anything.

I don't understand
the, the...

909
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:07,782
The relationship.

910
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:09,949
Yeah, the origin
of the relationship.

911
00:51:10,517 --> 00:51:11,618
You know what I mean?

912
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,251

She was... She was not...

914

She was not here
very often.

00:51:18,584 --> 00:51:20,183
- PETE: What, at school?
- Yeah.

916
00:51:21,882 --> 00:51:24,149
I like her
because she is, uh,

917
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:27,782
very sensitive
and I think she...

918
00:51:28,517 --> 00:51:31,183
She has a voice,
but she's...

919
00:51:32,451 --> 00:51:35,451
I don't know, too naive,
too fragile or...

920
00:51:35,484 --> 00:51:37,816
And she's not...
I think she's lazy, too.

921
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:39,183
She's not working enough.

922
00:51:39,217 --> 00:51:41,351
She should, you know...
She should be at school.

923
00:51:41,384 --> 00:51:44,049
She should...
She should be more understanding

924
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:45,782
that she has to learn
a lot from others.

925
00:51:45,816 --> 00:51:48,116
And again, this is, um...

926
00:51:48,149 --> 00:51:51,517
This is in...
In the real life.

927
00:51:51,551 --> 00:51:54,083
This is three days
before your character died.

928
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:56,484
Okay.

929
00:51:56,517 --> 00:52:01,016
So this is possibly your last
moment, um, of intimacy...

930
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:03,016
Well, not int...
Well, yes, intimacy,

931
00:52:03,049 --> 00:52:05,184
but before
it could be intimate.

932
00:52:05,217 --> 00:52:08,016
So you're...
You're feeling...

933
00:52:08,049 --> 00:52:10,484
You're feeling resentment
a little bit,

934
00:52:10,517 --> 00:52:14,251
because you don't know
whether he scored or not.

935
00:52:14,284 --> 00:52:17,049
He's possibly coming down
from something.

936
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:19,782
And then, I mean,
I look back and I kind of, um...

937
00:52:21,284 --> 00:52:22,351
He's all over the place.

938
00:52:22,384 --> 00:52:25,317

that possibly he was always

939
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:27,184
either on something,
coming down from something.

940
00:52:27,217 --> 00:52:28,949
Just about to score.
So he just...

941
00:52:28,983 --> 00:52:30,949
GARANCE: So that's also the
reason why I'm objecting here.

942
00:52:30,983 --> 00:52:32,417
Absolutely.
You're not in that mood.

943
00:52:32,451 --> 00:52:33,284
You're not in that space.

944
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,517
And you're both
almost not very present.

945
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:38,351
PETE: How did he feel about
her paying for everything?

946
00:52:38,384 --> 00:52:39,882
What was
that dynamic like?

947
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:41,782
Because was there not...

948
00:52:41,816 --> 00:52:44,916
Was there not an element
of shame there?

949
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:46,983
I'm not trying...
I don't want you to think I'm trying to

950
00:52:47,016 --> 00:52:48,049
- justify his actions.
- No.

951
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:51,816
I'm just trying to justify
his problems, really.

952
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:53,417
And at the moment,
I don't feel like I know

953
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:56,417
(HESITATES) what they
are, but, um...

954
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:03,782
So now he's stolen
everything and sold it.

955
00:53:03,816 --> 00:53:05,217
I just feel like
that's a...

956
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,016

you know...

960
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:23,016
A friend of mine stole money
from his mum last year,

961
00:53:23,049 --> 00:53:25,083
and everyone around him
thought he was

962
00:53:25,117 --> 00:53:27,417
the worst human being
in the world at the time,

963
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:30,184
but I knew
that he wasn't well.

964
00:53:30,217 --> 00:53:32,749
I knew that he wasn't
in a place of

965
00:53:34,384 --> 00:53:36,251
normal head space,
I knew that.

966
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:40,484
Is this quite difficult
for you?

967
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,251
Am I making it
more painful for you?

00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:44,084
JULIE: No. No, no, no.
You're... No, it's not you.

969

That's the thing,
it's really not.

This is good.

971
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,084
I think it's difficult

972
00:53:48,117 --> 00:53:51,816
because I'm coming up
against your idea of him

973
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:54,916
rather than a reality of him,
which is understandable.

974
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:56,317
But...

975
00:53:57,849 --> 00:53:59,849
It makes it
quite difficult for me to

976

about what's going on.

1028

- No, no, no, no.

Marland,
I'm getting grief from you

1030
00:55:49,483 --> 00:55:51,017

but we cannot continue like this.

but we're like...

1038
00:56:02,084 --> 00:56:03,351
JULIE: Okay, there were
a lot of conversations

1039
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:04,450
that happened
during prep that...

1040
00:56:04,483 --> 00:56:06,217
Yeah, I know.
I know we're students,

BEN: And, like, we should be,
like, professional now like...

1045
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,749
Okay. So should we start
making a move to

1046
00:56:13,782 --> 00:56:15,384
make the changes that we need
to make? Necessary changes.

1047
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:16,984
Well, like, what's...
What's the point?

1048
00:56:17,017 --> 00:56:18,351
Because we don't know
what's going on.

1049
00:56:18,384 --> 00:56:20,217
Am I antagonizing,
or am I defending?

SUSAN: No, you... No.
And I'm not... But...

1051
00:56:22,317 --> 00:56:24,849
Am I antagonizing?
'Cause I don't think I am.

1052
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,984
Look, we're dealing
with a serious ego back there

1053

and I don't know
what his problem is.

We just don't know
what's going on.

1058
00:56:36,917 --> 00:56:38,550
It's that...
It's that more than anything.

1059
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:41,416
Okay, can you be specific

1060
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:44,117
about what it is that you need from us?
Specifically.

1061
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,317
Because you're talking about

1062
00:56:45,351 --> 00:56:46,450
you needing everything
to be clear.

1063
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:47,550
Specifically, well, having
a shot list would be nice.

1064
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:49,816
Like, having like, following
the script would be nice.

of sense every single day.

like, halfway through

and then it was night

together before

and, like, that's why
we wanna work with Julie,

1087

that she works.

what you've been through,

1336

but I think... I'm sure from
the parents' point of view,

1337
01:10:06,551 --> 01:10:08,016
they're obviously dealing,
you know,

1338
01:10:08,049 --> 01:10:10,351
