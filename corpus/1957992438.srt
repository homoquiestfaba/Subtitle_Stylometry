1
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,409
<i>My grandfather believed</i>

2
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:20,395
<i>all chocolate
was a form of magic...</i>

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,479
<i>an alchemy,</i>

4
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,565
<i>where the beans of a cocoa tree</i>

5
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,317
<i>are transformed into the elixir
that is chocolate.</i>

6
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,156
<i>My Opa and Bommi
came to America from Belgium,</i>

7
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,532
<i>settling in Watson Corners.</i>

8
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,494
<i>Opa felt every town needed
a good chocolatier,</i>

9
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,704
<i>so he passed down</i>

10
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,456
<i>his magical chocolate recipes</i>

11
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,666
<i>to me, Lucy Sweet.</i>

12
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,671
<i>Yes, that's my real name...</i>

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,050
<i>Well, after my grandmother
changed it from "Van Suyt".</i>

14
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,718
<i>Bommi wasn't
much of a confectioner,</i>

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,346
<i>but she knew how to give
the customer a good story.</i>

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,015
<i>We call these the "Cupids".</i>

17
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,725
<i>They're very special,</i>

18
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,202
<i>and they're going to be
part of our story...</i>

19
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,686
<i>Mine and my mother's...</i>

20
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,856
<i>which has been,
for many years now,</i>

21
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,317
<i>entirely predictable...</i>

22
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,904
<i>Both our lives wrapped up
like pieces of chocolate.</i>

23
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,783
<i>Mom out on the sales floor
with customers,</i>

24
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,577
<i>and me, able to hide out
in my happy place...</i>

25
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>day after day,
making these chocolate elixirs,</i>

26
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,251
<i>exactly as Opa taught me...</i>

27
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,255
<i>until today...</i>

28
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,632
<i>when everything changed.</i>

29
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,593
62% rent increase.

30
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,596
Each and every month.

31
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,931
That should be illegal!

32
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,432
I know.

33
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,725
I knew this was gonna happen

34
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,227
when Ben retired
and Bruno took over.

35
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,561
You know, I even gave that boy

36
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,814
a box of your best
dark-chocolate toffees.

37
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,899
Well, maybe he prefers
milk chocolate.

38
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,693
No one over 30
prefers milk chocolate.

39
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,989
I don't want to lose this place.

40
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,369
Hey.

41
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,162
Then we will find a way.

42
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,717
Serena?

43
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,386
Ha-ha! Engaged!

44
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,571
Oh, my gosh!

45
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,680
Congratulations!

46
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,348
Oh!

47
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,808
Thanks to you two!

48
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,935
Oh, I think
Tyler would say differently.

49
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,229
No! He agrees.
It's the Cupids.

50
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,898
They worked their magic,
thanks to you two Sweets.

51
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,816
Aww.

52
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,568
Cupids?

53
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,610
You don't know?

54
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,779
Uh, it's Georgie's second day.

55
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,173
It's the first thing
she should've learned!

56
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,616
Anyone who eats
one of the famous...

57
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,035
- Not famous!
- Sweet family

58
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,119
chocolate Cupids

59
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,328
is guaranteed...

60
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,580
Not guaranteed!

61
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,956
To find their true love.

62
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,350
As long as
their heart is open to it.

63
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,292
Mom!

64
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,710
What?

65
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:49,961
It's part of the legend!

66
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,838
We even have a "Wall of Love".

67
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,341
Oh, I wondered about that!

68
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,925
A tribute

69
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,278
to the many successful
love stories over the years.

70
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,054
And now mine, too!

71
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,431
Tyler and I met
right after we ate the Cupids,

72
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,558
and rest is history.

73
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,478
I'll take a dozen.

74
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,230
Ah! Well, right this way.

75
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,274
You need to advertise
the Cupids.

76
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,817
It just doesn't feel right.

77
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,862
You know, Opa always said
not to get greedy.

78
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,114
They're supposed to find
the people they're meant for.

79
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,741
Well, you're gonna
have to do something,

80
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,993
because we have
the same landlord,

81
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,787
and I'm pretty sure
you're getting

82
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,163
the same rent increase
that I am.

83
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,332
I know. And you can
sell flowers year-round.

84
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,000
Our biggest season
is Valentine's Day,

85
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,710
four weeks away,
and after that...

86
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,879
Maybe you'll sell so much,
you won't need it.

87
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,298
I love your optimism,
but I'll need a miracle.

88
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,550
Or... a very good friend

89
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,053
who actually works
her social-media presence,

90
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,429
unlike some.

91
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,515
You're blowing up
on social media!

92
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,849
"Magic Chocolate Cupids"?

93
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,559
Serena, what did you do?

94
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,691
Magic chocolates?

95
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,154
<i>Harold Welby!</i>

96
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,406
<i>Your card says</i>

97
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,591
<i>you're a licensed and bonded
plumber,</i>

98
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,884
<i>but there's no record of you
at...</i>

99
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,785
They always run.

100
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,055
I'm surprised he didn't bolt
as soon as he saw you coming.

101
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,264
I know, right?
And you with the camera!

102
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,873
I mean...

103
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,209
hey, good job keeping it steady
through the alleyway.

104
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,794
<i>Harold Welby is still at large,</i>

105
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,088
<i>but he has scammed
more than 20 people</i>

106
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,715
<i>with his "fake plumber" scheme</i>

107
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,801
<i>to the tune of $56,000.</i>

108
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,554
<i>This is Dean Chase,
Channel 55 News,</i>

109
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,931
<i>and I fight for you.</i>

110
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,059
Do you think I should I keep
the pointing?

111
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,101
It's kind of your thing.

112
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,771
Yeah.

113
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,859
Hey, Nora.

114
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,277
Sure thing.
I'll be right there.

115
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,611
What's up?

116
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,031
Fingers crossed
it's about the Chicago gig.

117
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,365
I put her down as my reference.

118
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,908
Oh! Bold...

119
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,219
Asking your current boss
to help you get another job?

120
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,327
I'm her favorite.

121
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,330
So, you'd better be
ready to saddle up

122
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,623
as soon as I get back.

123
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,345
I bet you she's got
something juicy for us.

124
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,419
"Magic chocolates"?

125
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,920
Apparently, there's
a chocolate shop

126
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,682
in Watson Corners
where people fall in love,

127
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,899
if they eat
a particular chocolate

128
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,133
on Valentine's Day.

129
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,802
Okay... so, do you want me

130
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,471
to do a quick hit
or a longer expose?

131
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,598
"People Cheating the Lovelorn."

132
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,684
Throw in some shady matchmakers,
catfishing...

133
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,852
Love potions?

134
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,187
None of that.

135
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,147
I want a very nice story
for Valentine's Day.

136
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,857
But I do exposes.

137
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,734
I understand,
but that's not what that is.

138
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,736
Valentine's stories are popular.

139
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,738
This is a gift.
Trust me.

140
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,948
Okay, what about the House vote
on misuse of funds?

141
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,492
The faster you get the story,

142
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,470
the faster you can
get back to watching politicians

143
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,888
talk out of
both sides of their mouth.

144
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,247
How is this a gift?

145
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,708
I'll tell you when
you come back with the story.

146
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,713
And Dean?
Make it sweet.

147
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,590
Pun intended.

148
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,384
Uh-huh.

149
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,494
We're almost out of Cupids!

150
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,311
Okay.

151
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,814
Hey, we're out of cocoa beans.
I'm gonna run to the market.

152
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,982
- Okay.
- Demand's a good thing, right?

153
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,384
Right.
I'm still gonna kill Serena.

154
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,652
Get the cocoa beans first!

155
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,195
Yeah.

156
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,488
And Lucy?

157
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,240
Breathe!

158
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,660
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

159
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,703
There you go.
Next?

160
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,556
Thank you.

161
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,639
Have a good day.
Thanks.

162
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,299
Ah. Whew.

163
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,185
Excuse me.

164
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,644
I'm a reporter.

165
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,979
Excuse me.

166
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,314
Dean Chase!

167
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,482
That's me.

168
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,612
Was that one of those
"magic love" chocolates?

169
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,946
Mm-hmm!

170
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,632
Did you come here
specifically to buy one?

171
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,617
Mm-hmm.

172
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,328
I hate to break it to you,
but you've been had.

173
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,667
That was Dean Chase.

174
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,252
Dean Chase! Ooh!

175
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,932
- Oh!
- Oh!

176
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,393
You really need to pay attention
to where you're going.

177
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,437
Sorry... again.

178
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,730
Uh...

179
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,273
I, uh... I was just...

180
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,820
distracted by the mass delusion.

181
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,530
"Delusion"?

182
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,532
Yeah. Basically, a...

183
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,826
a testimonial about how
this place's chocolate Cupids

184
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,203
help you find true love...
Or whatever that is...

185
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,496
It went viral,

186
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,890
and now
there's a run on the place.

187
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,790
You don't agree?

188
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,333
I don't agree with deception.

189
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,210
This is deception
of the worst kind...

190
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,087
Manipulating people's hopes
about love.

191
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,715
Now, magic chocolates? Come on!
It's a total scam.

192
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,261
And I do happen to be a bit of
an expert on the subject.

193
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,096
On chocolates?

194
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,598
Scams. Dean Chase.
Channel 55 News.

195
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,475
- Great.
- Yeah, my boss wants me

196
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,561
to do a "nice" story
on this place,

197
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,564
but what I wouldn't give
to do a takedown, you know?

198
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,108
Uh, anyway...

199
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,484
what's your name?

200
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,028
Lucy!

201
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,588
There you are.
Been a madhouse since you left.

202
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,822
Sorry, Mom.

203
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,174
It was so busy,
I couldn't find parking.

204
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,408
Oh, sorry.

205
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,286
Lucy Sweet.

206
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,787
Chocolatier...

207
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,289
and nefarious love-scammer.

208
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,876
Thanks for stopping by,
Mr. Chase.

209
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,677
I, uh... I don't think
we'll be going forward

210
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,896
with any kind of story, though.

211
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,796
Uh, you know...

212
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,381
Bye, now.

213
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,008
I can help whoever's next.

214
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,886
Oh, my gosh, my favorite. Yum.

215
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,305
Yeah. Ooh, yum. Delicious.

216
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,432
Do you need a ribbon?

217
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,020
You went to a small,
family-owned

218
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,396
artesian chocolate shop

219
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,482
to do a simple feel-good
Valentine's Day story

220
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,691
and got kicked out?

221
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,752
I mean, I wouldn't say
"kicked out".

222
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,361
Asked to leave!

223
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,029
Mm, more <i>implied.</i>

224
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,405
What is wrong with you?

225
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,324
This was a warm hug
of an assignment.

226
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,493
It's a con, Nora!

227
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,286
And lying to people about love?

228
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,928
That's like waving
a big red flag for me.

229
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,725
Dean, you're one of
the hardest-working reporters

230
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,126
I've been around...
Here or elsewhere.

231
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,337
And I know you have
your sights on being an anchor

232
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,047
in a bigger market...

233
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,882
but you're not
getting the Chicago job.

234
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,636
Can I ask why?

235
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:59,015
They're not considering anyone
without some anchor experience.

236
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,201
But that's what
I'm trying to get here!

237
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,434
And that is where

238
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,395
the chocolate-Cupid
story comes in.

239
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,938
And...
that's where you lose me.

240
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,817
<i>Alex in the Morning</i>
is about to be down an Alex.

241
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,568
He's moving to Dallas.

242
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,404
We need a new anchor.

243
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,798
Uh, are you...
Does that mean that I'm...

244
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,198
You're in the mix.

245
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,409
Along with Patrick and Adam.

246
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,761
Adam is in the lead,
but mainly because

247
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,703
his first name
starts with an "A"...

248
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,287
Less signage changeover.

249
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,057
Well, tell me...
Just tell me what I need to do.

250
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,976
You've got the investigative
journalist part down,

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,459
but morning shows

252
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,295
are about easing the viewers
into their day,

253
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,381
with lovely stories about...?

254
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,174
Magic chocolates.

255
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,010
Oh.

256
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,387
Think of this as
my Valentine's Day gift to you.

257
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,180
I can do this!

258
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,658
Nora, I can do this, I just...
I just need another chance.

259
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,808
Bring me something good

260
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,910
so I can convince
the rest of them

261
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,602
that you're the guy.

262
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,644
Okay!

263
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,942
Nora...

264
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,069
I will make this happen.

265
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,988
Don't ever do that to me again.

266
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,032
Yep.

267
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,366
Yeah.

268
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,583
<i>And while Mr. Fernsby</i>

269
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,961
<i>claims his zucchini

270
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,798
<i>some in the farming community

271
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,800
<i>This is Dean Chase,

272
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,969
<i>and I fight for you.</i>

273
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,888
Why do you look like that?

274
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,979
We had the best day
of business in months.

275
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,814
Outside Christmas.

276
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,941
Usually,
the Valentine's Day rush

277
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,526
doesn't start till February.

278
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,278
Well, the momentum
from Serena's post

279
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,280
is only gonna last so long.

280
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,157
Then let's call that news guy

281
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,159
who wanted to do
a story about us.

282
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,119
He thinks we're scam artists.

283
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,539
Then we'll call
a different newsperson.

284
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,751
Do a good story,
and feature the Cupids.

285
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,003
Mom... you know
how I feel about that.

286
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,675
Honey,
it's a silly superstition.

287
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,051
We've been selling them
for years!

288
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,844
Yeah, by word by mouth.

289
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,013
Why tempt fate?

290
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,432
Because we're running
out of time.

291
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:08,728
If you want to keep the shop,
we have to make a change.

292
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,147
We both know,
once Valentine's Day is done,

293
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,399
profits plunge.

294
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,442
We either earn enough now

295
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,571
to overcome the rent increase
for the rest of the year, or...

296
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,782
you know.

297
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,397
All right.

298
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,857
Thank you very much.

299
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,483
All right,
see you in a few days.

300
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,903
Hi.

301
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,739
What are you doing here?

302
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,741
Um...
how creeped out would you be

303
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,993
if I told you
I saw you leave your shop

304
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,411
and I followed you here?

305
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,621
On a scale of one to ten?

306
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,206
About a...

307
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,499
17.

308
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,667
Okay, that's fair.

309
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,169
I come in peace.

310
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,921
Better yet, I come in business.

311
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,983
Yeah, I'm not interested
in doing business with someone

312
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,152
who thinks I'm running
some kind of chocolate love con.

313
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,469
Also fair.

314
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,554
We obviously got off
on the wrong foot.

315
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,014
"We" didn't.
You did.

316
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,185
"Dean Chase of Channel 55."

317
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,103
Huh! You're familiar
with my work?

318
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,646
Yeah. I wasn't.

319
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,082
Until last night,
when I watched some videos.

320
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,649
Impressive. Really.

321
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,277
Especially that fake
giant-zucchini scandal.

322
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,446
You really stuck it
to that farmer.

323
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,656
Okay, that was very early
in my career,

324
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,842
and the station was supposed

325
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,926
to have taken that clip down
by now.

326
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,160
Yeah...
it's still there.

327
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,119
Great. Awesome.

328
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,205
Uh...

329
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,040
is this where
you buy your magic beans?

330
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,458
Sorry.

331
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,377
Just hear me out.

332
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,753
I've already heard enough.

333
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,088
You're not gonna persuade me

334
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,173
to place the reputation
of my family's legacy

335
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,551
into the hands
of a clearly cynical man.

336
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,430
And if you keep following me,
I'm gonna upgrade that 17.

337
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,807
Which you don't want.

338
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,183
I am not following you.

339
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,310
I just... I really need
this story to happen.

340
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,687
You should have
thought about that

341
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,355
before you led with insults.

342
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,982
You're absolutely right.
100%. I messed up.

343
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,402
Now, all I am asking
is for five minutes...

344
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,489
three minutes of your time,

345
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,533
so I can give you my proposal.

346
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,076
I know you don't owe me that.

347
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,994
And I will take your "no".

348
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,347
I will walk away
and leave you alone,

349
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,539
if that's what you want.

350
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,040
I just think that this could be

351
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,917
really good for your shop.

352
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,379
Three minutes?

353
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,131
- Three.
- Start talking.

354
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,716
Okay. Great.

355
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,509
- Starting right now.
- Sure.

356
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,177
So, your Wall of Love.

357
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,405
A lot of people
have fallen in love

358
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,698
after eating
your chocolates, right?

359
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,182
Why don't we interview

360
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,493
and hear
their wonderful Cupid stories?

361
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,019
A morning anchor, huh?

362
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,770
For now.

363
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,873
Hopefully, it'll lead
to a bigger market, bigger job.

364
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,734
And a story about
"How Sweet It Is" helps you...

365
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,818
how?

366
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,112
By softening my image.

367
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,491
My producer thinks
that if I do this story

368
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,826
and it goes well,

369
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,037
the board might take that
into consideration

370
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,706
over my lack
of anchor experience.

371
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,416
And what's in it for me?

372
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,375
Exposure.

373
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,295
Of the most positive kind.

374
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,671
Glowing, even!

375
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,465
You gotta know

376
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,008
that the momentum
from a viral post

377
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,509
can only last so long.

378
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,428
But a news story like this...

379
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,739
This could take you
to the next level.

380
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,014
You could ride this wave

381
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,266
till Valentine's Day and beyond.

382
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,144
I don't trust you.

383
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,063
I don't blame you.

384
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,523
And I want final approval
on the story before it airs.

385
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,275
I don't even get final...

386
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,599
I'll... I'll see what I can do!

387
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,989
It will be
a glowing review, right?

388
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,240
"Glowing"?

389
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,493
Oh... glowiest.

390
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,911
Not a real word.

391
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,871
It... It's a real promise, okay?

392
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,247
From me to you.

393
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,708
Just... Just give me a chance.

394
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,169
That's all I'm asking.

395
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,511
Okay.

396
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,724
Here you go. Don't break it.

397
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,976
I will treat it
with love and compassion.

398
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,664
I really wish you were
coming with me on this one.

399
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:20,730
Adam already called dibs.

400
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:21,898
DeMatto trial.

401
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,858
Oh, Gary, you're killing me!

402
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,902
I would love
to cover that story.

403
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,880
Hey, buddy! You're spending
the day in a chocolate shop.

404
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,197
That wins.

405
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,615
Hmm.

406
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,542
So you sure it's okay to close
the shop for the afternoon?

407
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,460
Wouldn't want to deny
anyone their true love.

408
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,670
Right!

409
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,505
Okay...

410
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,774
Oh, no! No, no!
I didn't mean it like that.

411
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,049
I was just being, you know...

412
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,053
Look!
I am excited about this.

413
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,309
Okay. Heh. So.

414
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,895
The idea is, um,
we'll do a couple questions.

415
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,105
Easy ones.

416
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,290
"How'd you become
a chocolatier?"

417
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,108
"Why the Cupids?"

418
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,252
"What's the deal with
the legend," or whatever.

419
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,652
Okay.

420
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,362
Don't take it off again, please.

421
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,656
Look, don't disparage
the legend, okay?

422
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,949
I won't.

423
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,452
The "glowiest".
Remember?

424
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,871
The glowiest.
I promise.

425
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,417
Ahem.

426
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,169
I'm just gonna hit record,

427
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,521
then we're just gonna have
a conversation.

428
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,255
Just look at me. Okay?

429
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,551
Okay.

430
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,130
And so, chocolate is...

431
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,355
Well, I mean...

432
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,609
So, who doesn't love chocolate?

433
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,111
Right?

434
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,780
Right.

435
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,865
Um...

436
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,076
you make it here
in the store, right?

437
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,370
Yes.

438
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,625
From scratch.

439
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,505
How'd you get the idea
of selling the Cupids?

440
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,422
I didn't.

441
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,216
Oh.

442
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,510
My mom... My mom did.
Helen Sweet.

443
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,470
Did she keep her name
when she got married?

444
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,138
No, "Sweet" was my dad's name,

445
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,640
which is why my mom

446
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,850
is more comfortable
in front of the cash register

447
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,228
than making the chocolates
herself, but...

448
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,604
Can we not...

449
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,939
Um, can we not...

450
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,273
Can we not include that part?

451
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,526
Yeah. That's okay, yeah.

452
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,795
Let's see...

453
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,195
Hey, that's super-annoying.

454
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,698
Okay. I think
we're gonna take a break.

455
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,866
Why?

456
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,077
Because you are about
as relaxed as someone

457
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,721
waiting in a dentist's office
for a root canal.

458
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:41,972
Well, there is nothing relaxing

459
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,557
about having a light
shining in your face

460
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,642
and talking about yourself
on camera.

461
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,584
Yeah. You know what?

462
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,646
Let's forget about this.
Forget about the questions.

463
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,670
Forget about the camera.

464
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,843
Is that the, uh, "Wall of Love"
I've heard so much about?

465
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,927
Yeah.

466
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,990
Some of our success stories
from the Cupids.

467
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,598
That's great.

468
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,142
Did your grandparents
put that up?

469
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,560
No, actually, I did.

470
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,062
It's one of the things
I'm most proud of.

471
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,148
Really? And, uh...

472
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,858
Why's that?

473
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,777
Well, my grandfather didn't
make the Cupids very often.

474
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,321
He only gave them
to friends and family,

475
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,158
'cause he didn't like
to draw attention to them.

476
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,784
What changed?

477
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,203
After both my grandparents
passed,

478
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,597
I had just gotten out
of culinary school,

479
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,582
and I took over the shop,

480
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:29,586
and I started to make
all of my Opa's recipes...

481
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,504
except for one,

482
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:32,756
because...

483
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,716
well, I couldn't find it.

484
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,802
But then, one day,
I was in the back office,

485
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,804
and I was going through
some books,

486
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,266
and the recipe just, sort of...

487
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,352
fell out.

488
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,978
Do you think
he'd been hiding it?

489
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,564
Maybe.

490
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,484
It certainly felt like...

491
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,278
I found it
at just the right time.

492
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,155
Like...

493
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,450
Like I had to prove myself
worthy of it.

494
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,706
Anyway, I, um...

495
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,583
I made a batch

496
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,460
and my mom suggested

497
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,729
that we sell it
for Valentine's Day.

498
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:15,215
And... we did.

499
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,051
And, after a while,
we heard back from, you know,

500
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,720
people who had bought them...
Customers who had tried them...

501
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,597
And just had the most...

502
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,433
well, the most amazing
experience!

503
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,143
Magical?

504
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,940
Call it whatever you want.
We're not making any guarantees.

505
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,278
They were open to love
and they found it.

506
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,282
Seems pretty magical to me.

507
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,037
Ahem.

508
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,793
So... that wasn't so bad.

509
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,879
Well, you used a lot of tricks
to get me to be more authentic.

510
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,256
It's all part of my job.

511
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,382
You did great.

512
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,303
I will let you know
when we're gonna air it.

513
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,347
Great.

514
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,727
And, um...

515
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,395
good luck
with the anchor position.

516
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,189
Thank you.

517
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:19,029
I'm gonna... bye.

518
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,267
<i>And we started</i>

519
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,751
<i>to hear back
from all these customers</i>

520
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,002
<i>who had bought them</i>

521
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,838
<i>and then had
these amazing experiences</i>

522
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,298
<i>right after trying them.</i>

523
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,009
That...

524
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,970
is exactly what I wanted!

525
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,597
And now I want more.

526
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,639
More?

527
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:47,682
More chocolates.

528
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:48,600
More... the shop.

529
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,185
More Lucy Sweet!

530
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,603
She's pretty aptly named.

531
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,104
I kind of think
I covered everything.

532
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,231
And you're missing
the best part!

533
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,691
It's right in front of you.

534
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,110
Uh...

535
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,322
well, yeah... I mean, sure,
she's charming,

536
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,656
but whatever.

537
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,283
Bit of a tough nut to crack.

538
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,745
You mean the Wall of Love?

539
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:09,788
You mean the Wall of Love.

540
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,539
Exactly.

541
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:15,043
The stories of those couples
could be gold.

542
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:19,297
Make it a multi-part series
all the way to February 14th.

543
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,423
Multi-part.

544
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,259
That's, uh...

545
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,678
That's a lot of Valentine's Day.

546
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,721
Should I assign it
to someone else?

547
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,597
No, no, I'll do it!
It's my story.

548
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,765
Mm-hmm.

549
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:29,974
Yep!

550
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,650
Thanks for coming.

551
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,240
Do you have any questions?

552
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,908
So many.

553
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,327
But, um...
not about the condo.

554
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,705
Thank you.

555
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,331
It's not for you, is it?

556
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,125
To be honest,

557
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,669
it's been so long since

558
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,672
I've even thought
of living somewhere new, I'm...

559
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,799
I'm still trying
to figure out what is me.

560
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,884
Mm. Well, here.

561
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,219
Feel free to reach out

562
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,013
if you want to see
some properties,

563
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,141
and maybe find the answer.

564
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,018
Thanks.

565
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:47,844
Hi.

566
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,805
Didn't we, um, say goodbye
two days ago?

567
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,016
We did.
Very final. Very sad.

568
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,851
Yet here you are.

569
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,481
My news director, Nora,
loved the piece on your shop.

570
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,649
Good.

571
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,569
I mean, she's right...
It turned out great.

572
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,945
As promised.

573
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,365
You did indeed deliver, yes.

574
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,787
So...

575
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,580
what are you doing here?

576
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,957
Did you, uh, want to buy
a chocolate Cupid?

577
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,250
No.

578
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,838
I mean, no offense.

579
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,425
And this is me being so glad
that our story together is over.

580
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,593
Ooh, awkward.

581
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:30,595
Why?

582
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,139
Because I have another
business proposal for you.

583
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,600
And this one'll last
a lot longer than the first one.

584
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,850
If you were serious last night

585
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,074
about talking to these people,

586
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:02,335
you're not doing it alone.

587
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,253
You don't have to come with me

588
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,421
to every testimonial.

589
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,922
Yes, I do.

590
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,382
You're interviewing

591
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,092
the Sweet family's
Cupid success stories.

592
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,052
I... gotta protect them.

593
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,554
Protect them from what?

594
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,347
From you.

595
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,182
And your jaded views on love.

596
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,726
I did all right...

597
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,228
I did better than all right
with your segment.

598
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,397
One night versus
four-plus weeks on this project?

599
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,732
I don't trust you that long.

600
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,066
You know, leopard's spots,

601
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,943
scorpion on a turtle's back...
All that.

602
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,862
I'm not gonna poke holes
in the legend, okay?

603
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:29,654
You just air-quoted
"the legend".

604
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:30,989
All right. So...

605
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,299
which couple should
we interview first?

606
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,323
Claire and Malcolm.

607
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,452
They have a great story.

608
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,370
Mom says that

609
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,390
because she's the one that
introduced Claire to the Cupids.

610
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:40,749
Well, what can I say?

611
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:43,626
I'm proud of my handiwork.

612
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,045
Helen Sweet.

613
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,846
- Dean Chase.
- Dean Chase. Nice to meet you.

614
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,048
Nice to meet you.

615
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,174
Is...

616
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,717
Is that you?

617
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,510
It is!

618
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,054
So, you've eaten
a chocolate Cupid?

619
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:57,390
I did.
A long time ago.

620
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,141
Would you like
to do a testimonial?

621
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,183
No.

622
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,854
Well, we should keep the stories
outside the family,

623
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,165
so that they're more believable.

624
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,649
You know, for the cynical types.

625
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,447
Ahem.

626
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,668
Claire and Malcolm
are really nice.

627
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,628
Why does that sound
like a warning?

628
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,673
Because I'm just reminding you
to be nice, too.

629
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,007
I am nice.

630
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,635
I am.

631
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:36,680
As long as you're not
a con artist or a scammer.

632
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,349
Malcolm!

633
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,433
Hi, Malcolm.

634
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,601
Lucy!

635
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,061
- Oh!
- Oh, so good to see you.

636
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,020
Good to see you, too.

637
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:45,980
Dean Chase, right?

638
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:47,315
That's right.
Good to meet you.

639
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:50,276
Listen, Claire
is really excited to do this,

640
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,903
and her classroom's
right over here.

641
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,030
But, just one thing...

642
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,616
her teaching assistant
is gone for the afternoon,

643
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:59,202
so she was wondering
if you two wouldn't mind

644
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,912
helping her
with a project first?

645
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,580
I love projects.

646
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:03,957
Sounds great.

647
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,792
Perfect!

648
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,094
I really appreciate this!

649
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:18,013
Oh, of course!
It's so fun.

650
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,347
Isn't it?

651
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,229
It is! It's fun.

652
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,023
Uh, I am kind of worried

653
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:30,191
that my hand is gonna be
stuck like this forever.

654
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:31,026
Rah! Rah!

655
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,153
Rahhhh!

656
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,239
Are you both teachers?

657
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,866
No. Jalen,

658
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:41,286
Miss Lucy and Mr. Dean
are here to interview

659
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,705
me and Mr. Malcolm
about how we met each other.

660
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,082
You mean about
the magic Cupid chocolate?

661
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,542
You know about that?

662
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,210
Well, it's one of
my favorite stories.

663
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:54,674
And Miss Lucy here is the one
who makes those very chocolates.

664
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:56,009
Can I have one?

665
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,680
You're gonna have to wait
until you're a little bit older.

666
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,349
How old were you
when you had one?

667
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,267
I, um...

668
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,643
tch...

669
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,854
I've actually, uh,
never had one.

670
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:08,938
What?

671
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,274
You heard me.

672
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,776
Never?

673
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,944
Don't you believe in the magic?

674
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,280
Ooh! Looks like Jalen here's
coming for my job.

675
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:18,865
Excellent question.

676
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,700
Don't you believe in the magic?

677
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,913
I do. Very much.

678
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:26,956
Because I've seen
what it can do firsthand.

679
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,044
It was...

680
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,629
love at first sight.

681
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:33,713
Both times.

682
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,715
Both times?

683
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:36,901
We were high-school sweethearts.

684
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,718
Uh...

685
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,613
I thought you said you only
started selling the Cupids

686
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:41,388
to the public
a couple of years ago?

687
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:42,764
I did.

688
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,433
Can we just...
let them tell their story?

689
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:50,397
Like Claire said,
we were high-school sweethearts.

690
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:51,624
<i>My family moved into town</i>

691
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,650
<i>my junior year.</i>

692
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:54,877
<i>I remember seeing her</i>

693
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,027
<i>the first day of classes,</i>

694
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,904
<i>by the lockers, and thinking...</i>

695
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:00,990
"There's
the girl I want to marry."

696
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:02,492
<i>And we did!</i>

697
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:05,661
40 years later.

698
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,915
We went to different colleges

699
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:11,042
and lost touch.

700
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,419
I wound up marrying Reggie.

701
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:13,878
And I married Marie.

702
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,089
And we went about our lives.

703
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:19,217
I lived in Washington
until Marie passed.

704
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,137
And then, I moved back here
to be closer to my kids.

705
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:25,932
My Reggie was ten years gone
by then...

706
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,809
and that Valentine's Day,

707
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,061
I had a feeling

708
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,355
I was ready to try my hand
at love again.

709
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,025
Which is when
Helen Sweet told me

710
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,610
about the chocolate Cupids
at Lucy's shop.

711
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:41,072
My son had just called me
in a panic,

712
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,532
because he forgot to get

713
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,076
a Valentine's Day gift
for his wife.

714
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,995
When I passed the Sweets' store,

715
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:49,247
I remembered hearing
from a friend of a friend

716
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,999
about the chocolate Cupids,

717
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,877
so I stopped in...
on a whim.

718
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,714
And there she was.

719
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:00,342
It was fate.

720
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:03,970
So you didn't actually eat
a chocolate Cupid?

721
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,412
I did,
after I saw Claire was there.

722
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,269
And you've been
happily together ever since?

723
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:14,064
Some things are meant to be.

724
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,340
I just don't think you should
claim them for the Cupids.

725
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,032
Why not?

726
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,409
Because they were already
in love back in high school.

727
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:27,928
Just because they already
had a history

728
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,245
doesn't mean they would've

729
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,789
automatically fallen
back in love

730
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,165
when they met again.

731
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,541
Tons of people see their exes.

732
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,001
Nothing ever comes of it.

733
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:36,378
They could've
run into each other

734
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,980
at a dentist's office
and fallen back in love.

735
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,204
What is with you and dentists?

736
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,966
My point being...

737
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,760
I think their love story

738
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,221
is a bit more coincidence
than chocolate.

739
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,139
That's 'cause you're a cynic.

740
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,450
Says the woman
who won't even eat

741
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,059
her own "magic love" chocolates.

742
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:52,602
It doesn't make me cynical.

743
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:55,939
What does it make you?

744
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,529
I'm gonna walk home.

745
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,406
Come on.
It's five miles!

746
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,366
In those shoes?

747
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:08,201
Right.
I'm not gonna walk home,

748
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,577
but we're done talking about it.

749
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,622
That's fine with me.

750
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,512
- These are all orders?
- Mm-hmm.

751
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:29,222
Both from in the store
and online.

752
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,516
Georgie updated the site
to allow for shipping.

753
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,018
And she included a page

754
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,394
about the history of the Cupids.

755
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:38,106
Oh. Um, is that necessary?

756
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:40,358
I can take it out.

757
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:42,670
I... I thought you were on board
with promoting them now?

758
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,571
Isn't that w-what
you're doing with Dean?

759
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:45,822
No.

760
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:48,199
I mean, yes, but...

761
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:50,660
Of course,
you can leave them in.

762
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,078
It's just habit.

763
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:54,998
I'll go.

764
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
Hello?

765
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,752
So...

766
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,545
how are things going with Dean?

767
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,381
Well, he basically
doesn't believe

768
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,382
that Claire and Malcolm
should qualify

769
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,717
as one of the "Cupid Couples,"

770
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,302
because they already
knew each other.

771
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,553
I was there!

772
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,513
I... I can confirm it,
if he'd like.

773
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:11,598
That won't be necessary.

774
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:12,849
I just...

775
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,060
I just wish...

776
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,645
What?

777
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:18,980
I don't know.

778
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,775
I just wish that he'd...
would believe.

779
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:25,111
Which is silly,
because why do I even care?

780
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:27,739
We always want to win over
the non-believers.

781
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:29,824
It's human nature.

782
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,329
Have you given him one?

783
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,998
A Cupid?

784
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,042
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

785
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:40,168
Or any chocolate?

786
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:45,799
Honey, you're very talented.

787
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:47,634
He should know that about you.

788
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:51,012
Well, I learned from the best.

789
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,536
<i>Some things are meant to be.</i>

790
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,747
This came together nicely.

791
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,600
- Yeah, they're a fun couple.
- Good work. What's next?

792
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,459
Lucy and I will do
some more interviews.

793
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:23,312
I'm heading over there later
to choose our next subjects.

794
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:24,379
- Excellent!
- Great.

795
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:26,423
You should know,

796
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:29,509
I got a call today from NYNS
in New York about you.

797
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:30,802
Really?

798
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:32,429
I sent them my resume
a year ago.

799
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,639
Well, it made its way
into the right hands eventually.

800
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,058
Naturally,
I gave you a rave review.

801
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,019
Thank you, Nora.

802
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,854
Though I would prefer
you stayed here.

803
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,856
But I was in your shoes once,
so I understand.

804
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:44,566
Did they mention
what the position is?

805
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,960
Correspondent...
A mixture of stories,

806
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,253
not unlike
what you're doing now.

807
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:48,653
But on the national scale.

808
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,113
Keep me apprised.

809
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:51,781
Yeah, will do.

810
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,158
One other thing.

811
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,493
Are you coming
to the Valentine's Day event

812
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,120
the station is hosting
on Saturday?

813
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:58,580
Uh, I wasn't planning on it.

814
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,206
Reconsider that.

815
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:01,750
Some of the top brass
will be there.

816
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,752
Think of it
as part of your audition.

817
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:07,213
Unless you're too distracted
by the glamour of the Big Apple.

818
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:08,631
I'll definitely be there.

819
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:09,799
Good. And Dean?

820
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:12,260
Hmm?

821
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:13,595
Bring a date.

822
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:29,944
Hi.

823
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,529
Hey.

824
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:34,616
So, how's business?

825
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,703
Starting to settle back down.

826
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:40,330
Well, I'm sure
it'll pick up again

827
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:41,807
after we air
the Claire and Malcolm piece

828
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:42,832
on Monday.

829
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,042
Nora loved it.

830
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:46,961
Well...
that's what matters.

831
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,799
Um...

832
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:52,676
I'm sorry...

833
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,719
about the other day.

834
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:57,847
I don't mean to be so cynical.

835
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:59,974
I'm sorry, too.

836
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,644
- Truce?
- Truce.

837
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:07,190
Uh, so...

838
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,566
who's up next?

839
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:09,877
First things first,
do you have any...

840
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:12,112
dietary restrictions?

841
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,363
Um, nope.

842
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,615
I mean...
other than zucchini.

843
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:24,124
Do you prefer...

844
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:26,001
dark, white, or milk chocolate?

845
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,836
Oh, dark. For sure.

846
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:30,588
I mean, no one over 20
should prefer milk, right?

847
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:33,591
No wonder my mom loves you.

848
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:39,681
"Ambrosia creme."

849
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,559
This feels like a test.

850
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,102
It's not a test.

851
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,354
It just suddenly occurred to me

852
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,773
that you've never tried any of
the Sweet shop chocolates.

853
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,026
Hmm. Well...
a terrible oversight.

854
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,865
Oh...

855
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:58,783
this is...

856
00:35:58,825 --> 00:35:59,825
this is insanely good.

857
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,328
Oh, my gosh!

858
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,665
No wonder people think
that chocolates are magic.

859
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,043
Mm!

860
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,463
Great.

861
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:12,797
Let's go meet Pablo and Mark.

862
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:16,235
I think I need to do
some more research here

863
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:17,552
before we move on.

864
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,181
One day into February,

865
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,850
and they're already busting out
the Valentine's decorations.

866
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,393
It'll look good on camera.

867
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:28,146
Look at you... gettin'
all expert with camera staging.

868
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:31,483
They're over there.

869
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,110
Hey, guys!

870
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,987
- Hey, Lucy!
- Hey!

871
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,381
Hi. Pablo and Mark
Martinez-Spencer,

872
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:38,239
this is Dean Chase.

873
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:39,532
Hi.

874
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,034
- Hi!
- Nice to meet you.

875
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,535
Hi.

876
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:43,637
Thanks so much for doing this.

877
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:44,941
You're welcome.
Nice meeting you.

878
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,248
Okay.

879
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,209
Oh, wow.

880
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,961
Um, hope this place
isn't too over the top.

881
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:53,296
It's where I proposed,

882
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,607
so we thought it would
be nice for our story.

883
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,424
It's perfect.

884
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:58,426
We took the liberty
of ordering some drinks.

885
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:01,638
We have "Chocolate Kiss",
"Love Potion No. 9..."

886
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,348
- Mm.
- And "Soulmate Sangria".

887
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,100
"Soulmate Sangria"
for me, please.

888
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,893
I will do the same.

889
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:09,062
Lucy's chocolate has ruined me
for anyone else.

890
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,146
Oh, same!

891
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,314
Oh, go on.

892
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,108
No, seriously, go on.

893
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:17,487
To telling our love story.

894
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,197
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

895
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:23,993
When I heard from a cousin
about the super-cute Cupids

896
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:25,537
that helped people
find their love,

897
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:26,871
I went right over there.

898
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,039
Bought a dozen!

899
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,750
My idea had been
to eat one later,

900
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,144
before I went on
this date I had planned.

901
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,795
Felix, not me.

902
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:37,007
And I was so curious,
and they smelled so good,

903
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,609
that I had a bite
right there in the store.

904
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:39,884
Which is where I came in.

905
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,449
<i>And the next thing I know,</i>

906
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:47,434
<i>we were the ones
at the Valentine's Dinner.</i>

907
00:37:47,517 --> 00:37:49,978
<i>And it was officially
the worst date of our lives.</i>

908
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,080
<i>I mean,
Pablo would not stop talking.</i>

909
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,689
<i>I was nervous!</i>

910
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:55,025
<i>And I was sure
that I'd made a huge mistake.</i>

911
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:56,568
<i>We were so different.</i>

912
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,611
<i>But... then I realized,</i>

913
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,655
<i>I was the one
who'd eaten the chocolate.</i>

914
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:02,240
<i>So he tells me the legend,</i>

915
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,826
<i>and I thought,
"Why not?" Right?</i>

916
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,595
I mean, the date could not
have gotten any worse.

917
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,930
We already
emphasized that, honey.

918
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,456
- Right. So I eat...
- Honey.

919
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:10,874
The chocolate Cupid, and...

920
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:12,709
<i>it was the funniest thing.</i>

921
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:15,462
<i>I mean, part of me thought,
"This is silly."</i>

922
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,380
<i>But another part wondered,
"What if?"</i>

923
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:19,090
<i>Like, what if the person
that you think</i>

924
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,027
<i>is totally wrong for you
because you're so different</i>

925
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,011
<i>is actually the one?</i>

926
00:38:23,094 --> 00:38:25,430
<i>Because</i> they're so different.

927
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,016
All that from a chocolate Cupid?

928
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:29,559
I'll tell you this...

929
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:30,894
after I ate it,

930
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:33,188
I couldn't get this one
out of my mind.

931
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:35,357
That's when I knew.

932
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:36,524
We both knew it.

933
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,534
Okay, tell me
that story doesn't qualify.

934
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:47,744
It qualifies.

935
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:50,330
Yes! Victory is mine!

936
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,544
So...

937
00:38:56,586 --> 00:38:57,586
Lucy?

938
00:38:58,505 --> 00:38:59,839
Wyatt?

939
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,466
I thought that was you! Hi.

940
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,218
Wow, hi.

941
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,279
What are you doing here?
I thought you were in Miami.

942
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:07,430
Ah, well, one of my clients
is in town on tour,

943
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,325
so I thought I'd tag along,
see the family, too.

944
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,184
How fun for you.

945
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:13,728
Wyatt Greggs.

946
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,313
Dean Chase.

947
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:16,815
Dean is a reporter
for Channel 55.

948
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,400
Ah...

949
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:19,710
We're doing a story
on Lucy's chocolate Cupids.

950
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,319
Oh!

951
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,321
Are you still
making those things?

952
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,782
They're actually
incredibly popular.

953
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:29,411
So, then I guess
you're still working 24/7?

954
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:32,080
And it's pointless to see
if you'd want to grab dinner...

955
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:32,997
Before I head back
to South Beach?

956
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,958
Yeah, sorry.
I'm super-busy.

957
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,960
Always were. Ah, well.

958
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,170
Good luck.

959
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:41,172
- Hmm?
- With the story.

960
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:51,599
See?

961
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:54,185
Not everyone falls back in love
with their ex.

962
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:56,563
You two were in love?

963
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:59,524
Maybe the feeling was closer
to "strong like".

964
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,443
But not strong enough
to try a chocolate?

965
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:07,490
There's a coffee cart
down by the riverwalk,

966
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:10,910
has a hot chocolate
that is almost as good as mine.

967
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:13,329
Let's go.

968
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:15,451
I'll tell you why I've never
tried a chocolate Cupid.

969
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:20,503
Uh...

970
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:21,755
yeah, okay.

971
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,855
Well?

972
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:40,648
It's really good.

973
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,526
But I will have to try yours
the next time I come over,

974
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:44,486
just to compare.

975
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,112
It's similar,

976
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,198
'cause we get our beans
from the same vendor.

977
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:50,867
Although, they use single-source
and I blend two...

978
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,702
Ecuador and Argentina.

979
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:56,498
The farms that I like
have strong fair-wage practices.

980
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,583
It's a big thing
in the world of chocolates.

981
00:40:58,667 --> 00:40:59,918
Yeah, I read up on that

982
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:01,878
before I visited your shop
the first time.

983
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,630
Of course, you did.

984
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,841
Mm!

985
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,677
It's one of my favorite places
around town.

986
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:09,886
Yeah, me too.

987
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:11,262
I live pretty close to here.

988
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:12,681
How long have you lived here?

989
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:14,808
Mm.

990
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:17,769
It was, um, three years
this past November.

991
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,854
Might be why
I'm getting itchy feet.

992
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:23,483
But, uh, I seem to recall

993
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:25,860
we didn't come here
to talk about me.

994
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:29,280
There's the small matter
of some uneaten Cupids?

995
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:36,621
I believe
in the magic of the Cupids.

996
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:38,540
I think
it can bring you true love.

997
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,460
And...

998
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:44,838
that is what scares me.

999
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,632
Why?

1000
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,218
Because of what happens
when that love is taken away.

1001
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:56,683
And the... destruction
that it can leave behind.

1002
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,852
Does that have anything to do
with why you didn't want

1003
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:00,979
your mother giving a testimonial
about the Cupids?

1004
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:02,814
Yeah.

1005
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,236
My dad got sick
eight years ago...

1006
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:12,699
and he was gone really fast.

1007
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:15,410
My mom had a really hard time
accepting it.

1008
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,747
They were so in love.

1009
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:24,294
And she was so lost

1010
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,671
for such a long time after.

1011
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,340
What do you mean, "lost"?

1012
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:30,925
She was just a, um...

1013
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:33,970
a shell.

1014
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:37,015
For years.

1015
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:40,643
It felt like
I had lost both parents,

1016
00:42:40,685 --> 00:42:43,563
even though one was still there.

1017
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:46,566
I even moved back home
into my childhood house

1018
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:48,318
to help her.

1019
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,945
It's taken her all this time
to get back to herself.

1020
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:58,286
A love like that, I...

1021
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:01,539
It scares me.

1022
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:03,083
So...

1023
00:43:03,124 --> 00:43:06,795
does that mean you plan
on never falling in love?

1024
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,384
I don't have it all thought out.

1025
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:15,720
But...

1026
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:19,057
you asked me why I've never
eaten a chocolate Cupid, and...

1027
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,643
that's why.

1028
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,656
- I am so excited!
- She really is.

1029
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:35,949
I really believe you.

1030
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:37,992
Can you just hold still
for a second?

1031
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:39,428
I feel like this is all
happening because of us!

1032
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:41,329
I mean, of course, we happened

1033
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,498
because of
the Sweet shop's magic!

1034
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,875
Yeah, we're not on camera yet,
so just save it for that.

1035
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:48,211
Here, come here.

1036
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:50,547
I'd always wanted
to get married.

1037
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,174
My friends
used to tease me all the time,

1038
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:55,427
'cause I had a subscription
to bridal magazines

1039
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:57,554
before I had a boyfriend.

1040
00:43:57,595 --> 00:43:59,139
It's true.

1041
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,016
My problem was always
finding the right guy,

1042
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:03,852
and believe me, I worked at it.

1043
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:05,645
But I always fell short.

1044
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:08,231
And of course,
I knew about the Cupids.

1045
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,150
Lucy Sweet is my best friend.

1046
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:14,946
I resisted going that route
for a long time.

1047
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:18,241
Maybe I wasn't sure
if it was real, or...

1048
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:20,869
maybe I wanted to find love
my own way.

1049
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:24,456
But, after a while...

1050
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:28,293
I had to accept
that "my way" wasn't working.

1051
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:30,086
Then she tried the Cupids.

1052
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,005
Right there, in How Sweet It Is.

1053
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:33,757
<i>And right as I turn around,</i>

1054
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:36,718
this gorgeous guy
walks through the door...

1055
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:47,937
Hang on... you fell in love
with another guy before Tyler?

1056
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:51,483
No, I <i>saw</i> another guy
before Tyler...

1057
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:55,653
and I was hoping I'd feel
a rush of love, or something.

1058
00:44:55,695 --> 00:44:56,905
Their date was terrible.

1059
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:58,156
No chemistry!

1060
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:00,992
You gotta have chemistry.

1061
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,081
So, how did you meet, then?

1062
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:22,347
Hey!

1063
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,598
You dropped your...

1064
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,601
earring.

1065
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:44,160
I'd never believed
in love at first sight

1066
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:45,282
until I looked at my Tyler.

1067
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:48,247
What about you, Tyler?

1068
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:49,289
What's your story?

1069
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,335
I had eaten a Cupid
earlier that day

1070
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:53,586
with the girl I was dating.

1071
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:54,921
- It was her idea.
- Mm.

1072
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:57,465
But it didn't work out
between you two?

1073
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:58,842
Total bust.

1074
00:45:58,883 --> 00:46:00,635
She was nice, but...

1075
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:02,387
she wasn't Serena.

1076
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,098
What about
your respective dates?

1077
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,860
Did either of them have
a fairy-tale ending?

1078
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:08,184
I have no idea,

1079
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,561
I never
talked to that guy again.

1080
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:10,602
Jessica's seeing someone.

1081
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:12,688
- Jessica?
- My date.

1082
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,108
How do you know this?

1083
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:16,150
She told me.

1084
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:18,486
You still see her?

1085
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:19,362
Yeah, we're still friends,

1086
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:20,739
but I mean, it...

1087
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,531
I mean,
we're just texting, mostly...

1088
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:22,614
It's that sort of thing.

1089
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:23,867
You... You're texting her?

1090
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,243
Sometimes.

1091
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,291
Tyler, when did you know
that Serena was "the one"?

1092
00:46:33,543 --> 00:46:35,128
When she kissed me.

1093
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:40,050
That's so cute.

1094
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:41,009
- It's sweet.
- It's sweet.

1095
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,594
It's really sweet.

1096
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:43,635
You...

1097
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:50,727
Here, I'll take your coat.

1098
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:51,810
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1099
00:46:54,564 --> 00:46:56,232
Oh, Serena's the best.

1100
00:46:56,274 --> 00:46:57,942
Yeah, that was
a great interview.

1101
00:46:58,026 --> 00:46:59,319
But, is it just me,

1102
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:01,071
or did it get weird there
at the end?

1103
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:02,655
Oh, no, it got weird.

1104
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,449
But they're so in love,
it's crazy.

1105
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:07,410
So what are you doing now?

1106
00:47:07,452 --> 00:47:09,012
Gonna make a couple hundred
more Cupids.

1107
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:12,123
You were right.

1108
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:13,875
Business went up, and then some,

1109
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:15,335
after your station

1110
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:16,771
aired that story
on Claire and Malcolm.

1111
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:18,004
Glad to help.

1112
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:23,051
Thought you were headed home.

1113
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:25,804
Uh, I was.

1114
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:28,431
But could I film you
making the Cupids?

1115
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:29,974
No.

1116
00:47:30,016 --> 00:47:31,702
Can't have the secret ingredient
getting out.

1117
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:33,621
Oh, you never said anything
about a secret ingredient.

1118
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:34,562
What is it?

1119
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:38,024
It's, um...

1120
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:39,109
a secret.

1121
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,985
It's love, isn't it?

1122
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:43,405
Come on, say it's love.

1123
00:47:43,446 --> 00:47:44,489
It's not love.

1124
00:47:44,572 --> 00:47:46,157
What?
That's disappointing.

1125
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,575
Aw, is the cynic disappointed

1126
00:47:47,617 --> 00:47:48,868
in the lack of love

1127
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:50,137
in my family's
magic chocolate recipe?

1128
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:51,079
I'm not a cynic.

1129
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:52,122
Oh, right.

1130
00:47:52,163 --> 00:47:53,164
Right, right.

1131
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:54,749
You're a... a realist.

1132
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:57,166
Something like that, yeah.

1133
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:02,590
So, what...
What are you doing now?

1134
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:04,342
I am about
to temper the chocolate.

1135
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:06,511
And what does that do?

1136
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:10,015
I'm not gonna let you film me
making the Cupids, but...

1137
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:11,409
you can help me
make the chocolate,

1138
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:12,517
if you want.

1139
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,935
I thought you'd never ask.

1140
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:20,733
Whoa.

1141
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,527
Ooh.

1142
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:27,156
Go get an apron.

1143
00:48:28,366 --> 00:48:29,701
Yeah. Okay.

1144
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:46,593
So, this is tempering?

1145
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:47,719
It is.

1146
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,095
It's a later step

1147
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:50,197
in the process
of turning cocoa beans,

1148
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:51,181
or seeds...

1149
00:48:51,222 --> 00:48:52,557
Either word works...

1150
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:54,309
Into a little bit of heaven.

1151
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:00,315
Here, you try it.

1152
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:01,691
Oh, okay.

1153
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,193
Uh...

1154
00:49:03,234 --> 00:49:04,194
Okay, yep, spread it.

1155
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:05,362
A little more of an angle.

1156
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:07,989
Can you spread it right...

1157
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:09,091
Here, scrape it like that.

1158
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:10,492
- Bring it all back.
- Yeah.

1159
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:11,693
- To the middle again?
- Yeah.

1160
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:13,787
Yeah. Perfect.

1161
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:16,414
Uh, and wh...

1162
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:17,558
What does
spreading it around do?

1163
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:18,958
Cooling it down.

1164
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,227
Then we're gonna
heat it back up again.

1165
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:22,087
And why do we need to do that?

1166
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:24,631
Do you want the romantic version

1167
00:49:24,714 --> 00:49:25,757
or the science?

1168
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:26,799
Uh, science, please.

1169
00:49:28,426 --> 00:49:30,029
Tempering transforms
the molecules of cocoa butter

1170
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,554
into beta crystals,

1171
00:49:31,596 --> 00:49:34,307
which, in turn,
makes shiny, snappy chocolate.

1172
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:35,475
And the romantic version?

1173
00:49:38,853 --> 00:49:39,896
Magic.

1174
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:50,073
- Don't be stingy.
- You're so bossy.

1175
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,115
I am the boss.

1176
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,745
- I don't know why...
- Here, you need to hold...

1177
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:56,787
Turn your thumb.

1178
00:49:58,957 --> 00:49:59,957
Around them.

1179
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:02,603
You know what?
Here, I'll do it.

1180
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:04,087
Okay.

1181
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:08,466
Okay, watch.

1182
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,759
I'm watching.

1183
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:14,657
Did you always want to be a...

1184
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:16,391
Um, journalist?

1185
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:19,352
I always wanted
to be a TV anchor.

1186
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:23,189
Like Peter Jennings
or Bernard Shaw.

1187
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:24,858
They were always so calm
in a crisis.

1188
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:28,111
Did Young Dean pretend

1189
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:29,753
to read the news out loud
to his parents?

1190
00:50:31,531 --> 00:50:33,158
No.

1191
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:34,993
They split when I was nine.

1192
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,411
My sister was still a baby,

1193
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:37,912
so I kinda took on
the parental role.

1194
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:41,124
Mom and Dad were too busy

1195
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,435
marrying and divorcing
their way through our childhood

1196
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:43,459
to do it themselves.

1197
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:47,589
Now you're probably thinking,

1198
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,132
"Oh, that's why
he's the love cynic."

1199
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,759
No.

1200
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,971
I'm actually thinking,

1201
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:56,973
"That's why he's the protector
of the little guy."

1202
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:18,453
That was fun.

1203
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:19,662
It was.

1204
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:28,073
So, I guess this is
goodbye again?

1205
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:32,175
You know, actually, um...

1206
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:33,635
I've been thinking about

1207
00:51:33,677 --> 00:51:35,845
another angle on the whole
Valentine's and love.

1208
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:37,972
Something I'll put up
on the station's website.

1209
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:41,685
Maybe you could help me with it?

1210
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:44,020
Depends.

1211
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:45,146
What's the idea?

1212
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:47,315
Well...

1213
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:49,317
Why are we still in love?

1214
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:51,277
Uh, because we work at it.

1215
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:52,319
We do.

1216
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:54,897
- Love is work.
- Love is work.

1217
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:58,284
But it's also fun.

1218
00:51:58,326 --> 00:52:00,203
- After the work.
- After the work.

1219
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:05,165
I'm gonna remember that.

1220
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:07,544
It's just...

1221
00:52:07,585 --> 00:52:09,337
I don't know.

1222
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:13,633
I just saw him at the park,
with Jojo here...

1223
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:15,969
and I just thought,
"That's my guy."

1224
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:17,470
Yeah?

1225
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:18,805
Totally.

1226
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:22,600
Love takes off the mask.

1227
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:25,645
And lets us see the real you.

1228
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:26,980
And the real other person.

1229
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:28,148
Yeah?

1230
00:52:28,189 --> 00:52:29,315
Totally.

1231
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:35,196
I didn't want to live
without love,

1232
00:52:35,238 --> 00:52:37,741
and when I first took her hand,
all those years ago,

1233
00:52:37,782 --> 00:52:39,826
I knew I wouldn't ever have to.

1234
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:42,620
But you're leaving out
one important thing.

1235
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:43,955
What's that?

1236
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:47,000
You're also a great dancer.

1237
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,585
That's what decided it for me.

1238
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:50,670
I remember.

1239
00:52:50,754 --> 00:52:52,922
And, in those days,

1240
00:52:52,964 --> 00:52:56,176
two ladies dancing together
caused quite a stir.

1241
00:52:56,259 --> 00:52:57,802
Not that we cared.

1242
00:52:57,844 --> 00:52:59,804
No, we didn't.

1243
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:00,972
And that's love.

1244
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:03,183
We fell in love fast.

1245
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:04,368
And we broke up just as fast.

1246
00:53:04,392 --> 00:53:05,769
We were young.

1247
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,270
Yeah. We stayed friends.

1248
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:09,147
Believe it or not.

1249
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:11,941
Then we started dating
a bunch of other people for...

1250
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:13,985
The next decade.

1251
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:15,820
Until, one night,

1252
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:17,030
the both of us were talking

1253
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:18,823
about our latest
dating disasters.

1254
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,950
And I started crying.

1255
00:53:20,992 --> 00:53:22,911
So I hugged her.

1256
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:25,455
And the longer
I stayed with him holding me,

1257
00:53:25,497 --> 00:53:27,707
the more I realized, I...

1258
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:29,069
I didn't want to be
anywhere else.

1259
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:31,461
Now we have four kids.

1260
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,660
- What do you think?
- I love it.

1261
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:37,634
It's hard to believe

1262
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:39,678
that Mr. Cynical came up
with this idea, though.

1263
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:42,472
Well, if you marinate
in all things Valentine's

1264
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:43,723
for three weeks,

1265
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:44,965
some of it's bound to rub off.

1266
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:48,311
Well, if you like it,

1267
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,830
I will kick it upstairs
and see what Nora thinks.

1268
00:53:49,854 --> 00:53:51,481
All right.

1269
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:53,274
Hey, um...

1270
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,068
how's it going with the, um...

1271
00:53:55,151 --> 00:53:57,070
the morning anchor job?

1272
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:58,112
I'm still in the running.

1273
00:54:01,157 --> 00:54:03,660
Yeah, there's actually
this thing on Saturday night.

1274
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:06,413
Thing?

1275
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:07,706
Um, the station's holding

1276
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:09,016
a promotional event
for Valentine's Day.

1277
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,333
A lot of the folks

1278
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:11,519
who are gonna decide
who the next anchor is

1279
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:12,544
will be there.

1280
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:14,462
Oh. So, no pressure.

1281
00:54:14,504 --> 00:54:16,214
No, none.

1282
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:18,717
Just the fate of my career
and thus my entire future life.

1283
00:54:18,758 --> 00:54:19,759
Sounds super fun.

1284
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,469
Yeah.

1285
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:22,303
Do you wanna come with me?

1286
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:24,055
Me?

1287
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:25,974
Yeah, you.

1288
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:28,018
Um, Nora said
I should bring somebody,

1289
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:30,020
and I bet she'd get a kick
out of you being there.

1290
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:31,122
She loves the stuff
we're working on.

1291
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:32,439
Um...

1292
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,189
But, if...
If you don't want to, it's...

1293
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:34,315
I would love to.

1294
00:54:34,357 --> 00:54:35,357
You would?

1295
00:54:36,317 --> 00:54:37,277
Yeah.

1296
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:38,318
Okay.

1297
00:54:39,487 --> 00:54:40,613
Great.

1298
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:44,159
- Cool. Um...
- Okay.

1299
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,078
I'll, uh, text you the details?

1300
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,204
Uh, yeah. Of course.

1301
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:51,583
- Okay.
- Okay.

1302
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:52,824
- Good work.
- Thanks, you too.

1303
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:04,971
It's not listed yet.

1304
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:08,058
The owners are making repairs.

1305
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:10,380
But I thought I would show you,
just in case you liked it.

1306
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,437
It's beautiful.

1307
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:14,856
- And these views.
- Mm-hmm.

1308
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:16,775
I've always wanted a room
with a view of water.

1309
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,987
Are you interested enough
to put in an offer?

1310
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,367
I'm not sure.

1311
00:55:25,408 --> 00:55:27,952
I haven't even told my daughter
I'm thinking about this,

1312
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:29,329
let alone looking.

1313
00:55:30,997 --> 00:55:33,124
She has so much
on her plate already, I just...

1314
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,710
You still have a couple weeks
before it hits the market,

1315
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:37,504
and maybe by then,
you'll have told her.

1316
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,358
Oh, you look beautiful.

1317
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:00,902
Why am I so nervous?

1318
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:04,082
You haven't gone anywhere
dressy in a while.

1319
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:05,240
It's natural.

1320
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:10,203
You should wear these.

1321
00:56:13,873 --> 00:56:14,874
Dad gave those to you.

1322
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:16,209
Mm-hmm.

1323
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:18,169
And someone should wear them.

1324
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:19,921
They're too beautiful
to stay hidden away.

1325
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:22,674
Are you sure?

1326
00:56:22,757 --> 00:56:23,757
I'm absolutely sure.

1327
00:56:27,512 --> 00:56:28,972
- Oh...
- Oh...

1328
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:30,014
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

1329
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:42,985
Okay.

1330
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:46,531
Hi, Helen.

1331
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:47,800
- Hello, Dean.
- Nice to see you.

1332
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:49,617
Uh, is Lucy he...

1333
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,122
Hi.

1334
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:56,291
Hey, Dean.

1335
00:56:56,332 --> 00:56:57,667
Nice suit.

1336
00:56:57,709 --> 00:56:58,501
You... You look...

1337
00:56:58,543 --> 00:56:59,543
Wow.

1338
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:04,771
- Thank you, Mom.
- You're welcome, honey.

1339
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:07,635
Okay. Oh.

1340
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,474
Knock 'em dead tonight.

1341
00:57:12,557 --> 00:57:13,808
Thanks, Mom.

1342
00:57:15,894 --> 00:57:17,771
- Here, let me.
- Oh.

1343
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:18,897
Thank you.

1344
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:38,541
Hey.

1345
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:39,793
You all right?

1346
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:41,127
Oh, yeah.

1347
00:57:41,169 --> 00:57:42,229
There's just not
a lot of fancy events

1348
00:57:42,253 --> 00:57:43,421
for independent chocolatiers.

1349
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:46,716
Thank you for doing this.

1350
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,926
Of course.

1351
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:51,846
You and the station

1352
00:57:51,888 --> 00:57:54,265
are a big reason that
our sales are up, you know.

1353
00:57:54,307 --> 00:57:55,809
I don't know if I told you this,

1354
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:59,020
but we had a huge rent increase
a couple weeks ago.

1355
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:00,730
No.

1356
00:58:00,772 --> 00:58:02,857
No, you just implied
you needed sales to get better.

1357
00:58:02,899 --> 00:58:04,609
That's why.

1358
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:05,920
Just trying
to get enough momentum

1359
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:07,237
to get us through the year.

1360
00:58:07,278 --> 00:58:09,447
And? How's it going?

1361
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:11,866
We're much closer to our goal
than I thought we'd be.

1362
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:12,951
That's great, Lucy.

1363
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:17,247
And here is the woman
who made it all possible.

1364
00:58:17,288 --> 00:58:19,290
Oh, I love an intro like that.

1365
00:58:19,332 --> 00:58:21,126
Lucy, this is
my news director, Nora.

1366
00:58:21,209 --> 00:58:22,711
Nora, Lucy Sweet.

1367
00:58:22,752 --> 00:58:24,587
Ah, we meet at last.

1368
00:58:24,629 --> 00:58:25,630
Nice to meet you.

1369
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:26,756
I was just telling Dean

1370
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:28,067
that our business
is doing so well,

1371
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:29,884
I can barely keep up.

1372
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:31,386
All thanks
to your news coverage.

1373
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:35,515
And that's my segue
to run something by you two.

1374
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:36,993
I looked at some of
your unused footage,

1375
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:38,018
and it gave me an idea.

1376
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:39,519
For?

1377
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,188
The perfect conclusion
to the series.

1378
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,066
Dean does a live feed
on the 5 o'clock news

1379
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:47,110
from How Sweet It Is
on Valentine's Day.

1380
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:48,528
I love that!

1381
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,988
That would be
so good for the shop.

1382
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,072
And good exposure for you.

1383
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:52,532
Exactly.

1384
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:53,884
We're already getting
feedback from viewers

1385
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:55,493
on this more personable side
to you.

1386
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:57,037
What better way to wrap it up

1387
00:58:57,078 --> 00:59:00,415
than you eating
a chocolate Cupid live on TV?

1388
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:01,916
Sorry, what?

1389
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:03,209
Well, don't worry,

1390
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:04,169
you don't have to pretend
to fall in love.

1391
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,087
Uh, I...

1392
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,548
I mean, I think
that would be Lucy's call.

1393
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:11,446
Eating a chocolate
is Dean's decision.

1394
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:14,429
But, um, otherwise,

1395
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:16,282
I would be thrilled to have
the live feed from the store.

1396
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:17,599
Perfect!

1397
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,392
We'll work out
all the details on Monday.

1398
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:22,812
And now, I have to go
play nice to the CEO.

1399
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:24,894
- It's lovely to meet you, Lucy.
- Nice to meet you.

1400
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,988
I can make
a secretly fake chocolate.

1401
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,156
No one will know.

1402
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,158
I'm not afraid of chocolate.

1403
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,285
Right. Of course.

1404
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:38,203
Because you'd have
to believe in it

1405
00:59:38,244 --> 00:59:39,371
for it to actually work.

1406
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:41,122
Oh, is that
the secret ingredient?

1407
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:42,332
Is it belief?

1408
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:44,125
No. It's...

1409
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,919
paprika.

1410
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,420
Really?

1411
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:51,841
I'm gonna figure it out.

1412
00:59:51,883 --> 00:59:53,593
I am
an investigative journalist.

1413
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:54,636
Mm-hmm.

1414
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:57,263
Hey, hey, hey!

1415
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:58,890
- Oh-ho-ho, hey.
- Hey.

1416
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:00,308
I hardly recognize you.

1417
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,702
Ah, I try to break out
this jacket once a year

1418
01:00:01,726 --> 01:00:02,953
to remind me that I'm civilized.

1419
01:00:02,977 --> 01:00:04,312
Lucy, this is Gary Shane,

1420
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:05,748
my colleague,
my favorite cameraman.

1421
01:00:05,772 --> 01:00:07,107
The famous Lucy Sweet.

1422
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,983
I've been helping Dean
edit the stories.

1423
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:11,152
And I plan to stop by your store
for some chocolates.

1424
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:12,737
Oh, a Cupid?

1425
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:14,030
Ha-ha, too old for that.

1426
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:18,618
I love this song.

1427
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,329
And Dean would love
to ask you to dance.

1428
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:25,166
Do you want to?

1429
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,918
Only if you want to.

1430
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,546
I do. Want to. Dance.

1431
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,260
♪ ...In my arms
Let me hold me... ♪

1432
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:36,886
♪ Gary, would you?

1433
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,138
Of course.

01:00:39,931 --> 01:00:43,518

1435
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,397

1436
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,441

1437
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:50,942
Yeah.

1438
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:51,901
I don't get
a lot of opportunities

1439
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:52,902
to dance in the shop.

1440
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:54,362
Oh, I don't know.

1441
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:55,321
Pretty sweet sound system
back there.

1442
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:57,323
I bet you dance in the kitchen.

1443
01:00:57,365 --> 01:00:58,408
Busted.

1444
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,035
♪ ...I never fall ♪

1445
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:03,204
♪ Unless it's you
I'm falling to ♪

1446
01:01:03,246 --> 01:01:06,624
♪ I was lost
in the dark... ♪

1447
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:13,923
Did you talk to enough execs
to help you get the job?

1448
01:01:13,965 --> 01:01:15,884
I don't know.

1449
01:01:15,925 --> 01:01:17,344
I'm glad I came.

1450
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:20,555
We should go home.

1451
01:01:20,597 --> 01:01:22,265
Uh...

1452
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:23,475
Yeah, I guess we should, huh?

1453
01:02:06,851 --> 01:02:07,936
Hi, Mom.

1454
01:02:07,977 --> 01:02:08,977
Morning, honey.

1455
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,358
What's that?

1456
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:16,045
Why are you looking at houses?

1457
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:17,570
Oh, um...

1458
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:24,387
Honey, I...
I think it might be time.

1459
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:25,495
For what?

1460
01:02:25,578 --> 01:02:26,579
To sell the house.

1461
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:30,583
Oh.

1462
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:33,086
Believe me, this...

1463
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:34,838
This old place
holds so many memories.

1464
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:37,966
Most happy.
Very happy. But...

1465
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:40,208
It's because of all the talk
about the Cupids, isn't it?

1466
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:42,238
It's got you thinking about Dad.

1467
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:43,680
Oh, no, no, no.

1468
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:45,522
I... I've been considering it
for a while now.

1469
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,102
And you were so generous
to move in here with me,

1470
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:51,521
but I just...

1471
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:52,604
I'm better now.

1472
01:02:54,274 --> 01:02:55,442
I know you are.

1473
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,150
I know you don't like change.

1474
01:03:04,576 --> 01:03:06,494
Which is why
I didn't want to bring this up

1475
01:03:06,536 --> 01:03:08,204
until after Valentine's Day.

1476
01:03:08,246 --> 01:03:11,374
So, let's just set this aside,

1477
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,251
and we can talk about it later.

1478
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:14,544
You know, there...

1479
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:15,920
We're a day from Valentine's,

1480
01:03:15,962 --> 01:03:17,356
and there's much work ahead,
so let's just...

1481
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:18,423
- Mom.
- What?

1482
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:20,881
You know I'll support you.

1483
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:25,263
That's good.

1484
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:26,305
'Cause you might have to.

1485
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:31,603
I need some coffee.

1486
01:03:31,644 --> 01:03:33,271
Yeah. Yeah.

1487
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:35,106
A little too much, too soon.

1488
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:47,160
Dean Chase.

1489
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:03,176
Hey. Where's Serena?

1490
01:04:04,844 --> 01:04:06,012
Thanks.

1491
01:04:10,392 --> 01:04:12,185
Oh, there you are.
Where have you been?

1492
01:04:17,899 --> 01:04:19,192
What happened?

1493
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:20,360
Jessica.

1494
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:21,236
Who's Jessica?

1495
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:22,570
Tyler's date.

1496
01:04:22,612 --> 01:04:25,365
I'm sorry, since when?

1497
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:26,741
Two years ago.

1498
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:28,118
Tyler's been dating someone

1499
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,345
the whole time
you've been dating?

1500
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:30,328
How should I know?

1501
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,746
Is that what he told you?

1502
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,224
No! We found out
because of the interview we did

1503
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:34,582
with you and Dean.

1504
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:35,875
Are you talking about

1505
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,436
the woman that Tyler
ate the Cupid with?

1506
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,170
They'll always have that bond!

1507
01:04:39,212 --> 01:04:40,797
You ate a Cupid
with what's-his-name

1508
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,173
and you don't have a bond.

1509
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:43,651
Yeah, but Tyler's still
in contact with her.

1510
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:45,010
That crosses the line!

1511
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:46,970
Serena, he's crazy about you.

1512
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:48,430
Is he?

1513
01:04:48,471 --> 01:04:50,265
Or have I been
completely blinded

1514
01:04:50,348 --> 01:04:52,934
by this whole Cupid-chocolate-
love-destiny idea

1515
01:04:52,976 --> 01:04:54,078
and completely missed the truth?

1516
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:55,311
Serena...

1517
01:04:55,353 --> 01:04:56,553
I can't talk about it anymore.

1518
01:04:57,731 --> 01:04:59,691
That's why
I've been avoiding your calls.

1519
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,493
I've been hiding back here
for the past week.

1520
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,106
Like you do in your kitchen.

1521
01:05:16,624 --> 01:05:17,917
Oh!

1522
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:19,562
You have no idea
how happy I am to see you.

1523
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:20,920
I desperately need a...

1524
01:05:22,964 --> 01:05:24,007
a friendly face.

1525
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,093
What's wrong?

1526
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:30,805
New York?

1527
01:05:30,847 --> 01:05:32,974
That's always been
my number-one destination.

1528
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:34,785
I think it makes sense
for what you want.

1529
01:05:34,809 --> 01:05:35,870
It's not an anchor position.

1530
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:37,062
But it could lead to one.

1531
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,610
What about the anchor position
at Channel 55?

1532
01:05:43,693 --> 01:05:45,779
Nora says
it's between me and Adam.

1533
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,322
Thanks to you.

1534
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:49,491
She specifically referenced
the clips that I sent

1535
01:05:49,532 --> 01:05:50,652
of our first story together.

1536
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:55,372
Well, look at us.

1537
01:05:55,413 --> 01:05:56,623
It's all working out.

1538
01:05:56,664 --> 01:05:58,224
You're getting a shot
at your dream job,

1539
01:05:58,249 --> 01:06:01,169
and it looks like I'm gonna
be good for the year...

1540
01:06:01,252 --> 01:06:02,252
Maybe beyond.

1541
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:04,881
Win-win.

1542
01:06:08,426 --> 01:06:10,053
There's one other bump.

1543
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:13,139
The interview is in person,
tomorrow.

1544
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:16,267
That's Valentine's Day.

1545
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:18,895
Yeah, I guess
they just consider it Monday.

1546
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:20,980
What about the live feed?

1547
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,191
Well, the interview's
at 1:00 P.M.

1548
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:24,859
I'm pretty sure
that I can still do it,

1549
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:25,777
get back to the airport,

1550
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:27,195
fly home,

1551
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:28,673
and make it in time
for the feed at 5...

1552
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:30,281
With the time-zone difference.

1553
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:31,645
That's cutting it awfully close.

1554
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,829
I know. I know.

1555
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:38,516
I really don't
want to miss out...

1556
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,708
No.

1557
01:06:39,749 --> 01:06:40,851
On our final story together.

1558
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,168
You're doing the right thing.

1559
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:47,275
Then why do I feel like
I'm messing up?

1560
01:06:49,217 --> 01:06:52,262
Because you're Dean Chase,

1561
01:06:52,303 --> 01:06:53,948
and despite all appearances
to the contrary,

1562
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:54,972
you have a good heart.

1563
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:59,227
Am I...

1564
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:03,440
Am I wrong to think that...

1565
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:05,358
we might be
starting something here?

1566
01:07:06,985 --> 01:07:08,945
We can't go there now.

1567
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:10,321
But if there is...

1568
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:11,507
If there's something there...

1569
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:14,576
Dean, you're going after
what you want.

1570
01:07:14,617 --> 01:07:15,952
Like you should.

1571
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:20,165
I don't know what I want.

1572
01:07:20,206 --> 01:07:22,208
Yeah, but that's why
you're going...

1573
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:23,543
to find out.

1574
01:07:26,379 --> 01:07:28,024
And if you don't make it
back in time for the live feed...

1575
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:29,674
I will.

1576
01:07:29,758 --> 01:07:33,345
Right, but if you don't...

1577
01:07:33,386 --> 01:07:34,971
it's okay.

1578
01:07:37,557 --> 01:07:39,851
Hey, at least this way,

1579
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,693
you won't have to eat
a chocolate live on air.

1580
01:07:49,027 --> 01:07:50,070
Yeah.

1581
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,001
Excuse me. Sorry.

1582
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:06,628
Sorry.
I just need to get through.

1583
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:08,270
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
Just coming through.

1584
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:10,507
Just one?

1585
01:08:10,548 --> 01:08:11,716
Sorry.

1586
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:14,594
Sorry.

1587
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:15,720
Excuse me.

1588
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:18,014
Mom, what's going on?

1589
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:19,641
Channel 55's ads
for the live feed

1590
01:08:19,724 --> 01:08:20,767
started running.

1591
01:08:20,809 --> 01:08:21,893
Well, where's Georgie?

1592
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:23,770
Her grandfather's car
wouldn't start.

1593
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:25,331
She had to go take him
to his doctor's appointment.

1594
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:26,606
When is she coming back?

1595
01:08:26,648 --> 01:08:28,441
Hopefully tomorrow.

1596
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:29,401
Do the Cupids
come in milk chocolate?

1597
01:08:29,442 --> 01:08:30,735
Ah, no.

1598
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:32,278
- Are these gluten-free?
- Yes.

1599
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,673
- Can we order them in bulk?
- I... I don't... Lucy?

1600
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:35,115
Okay, stop!

1601
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:38,535
We're closing the shop
immediately.

1602
01:08:38,576 --> 01:08:39,744
Thank you, please leave.

1603
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:41,121
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.

1604
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:45,726
Thank you very much.
Thanks for coming.

1605
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:46,960
Thank you.

1606
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:47,794
Come back some other time.

1607
01:08:47,836 --> 01:08:48,878
Thank you.

1608
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:50,880
I'm sorry, I know.

1609
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:03,143
Honey...

1610
01:09:17,949 --> 01:09:18,950
It has to be a curse.

1611
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:20,785
Lucy...

1612
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:23,204
Mom, you remember
what Opa always used to say?

1613
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:25,248
Your grandfather
was superstitious.

1614
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,668
Serena's heartbroken.

1615
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:29,895
She and Tyler were perfect
for each other.

1616
01:09:29,919 --> 01:09:31,129
Look at them now.

1617
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:33,089
Serena and Tyler
are their own people.

1618
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:34,424
Georgie's gone.

1619
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:36,259
She'll be back tomorrow.

1620
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:37,677
Maybe.

1621
01:09:39,095 --> 01:09:40,722
Look at us.

1622
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:42,766
We literally have
too much success.

1623
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:44,201
This has a "careful
what you wish for" curse

1624
01:09:44,225 --> 01:09:45,435
written all over it.

1625
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:47,812
So you're a curse expert now?

1626
01:09:47,854 --> 01:09:51,149
Mom, I can't possibly
make enough chocolates

1627
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:52,984
to fulfill all these orders
and get them out.

1628
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:54,819
We have a note on the order form

1629
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:56,112
that says they could be late.

1630
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:57,822
And if they want
to buy them here?

1631
01:09:57,864 --> 01:10:00,283
I can't make enough chocolates.

1632
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:02,660
We're going live tomorrow.

1633
01:10:02,702 --> 01:10:04,662
We're not gonna have
enough product.

1634
01:10:04,704 --> 01:10:06,414
People are gonna write
nasty reviews.

1635
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:08,696
They are gonna complain,
and then we are gonna be ruined.

1636
01:10:11,127 --> 01:10:13,546
So, do you want to call Dean
and cancel the live feed?

1637
01:10:13,588 --> 01:10:14,631
I don't know.

1638
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:18,516
He's probably not even
gonna be here tomorrow.

1639
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:21,554
Where will he be?

1640
01:10:22,722 --> 01:10:24,140
New York.

1641
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:25,642
For an interview.

1642
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:28,853
Oh...

1643
01:10:30,855 --> 01:10:32,190
I see.

1644
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:39,197
Maybe it's the Cupids
that are cursed.

1645
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:41,366
Why would you say that?

1646
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:49,426
Because look what happened
with you and Dad.

1647
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:57,382
Your father got sick.

1648
01:10:57,424 --> 01:11:00,885
It happens to people every day.

1649
01:11:00,927 --> 01:11:02,679
Chocolates had nothing
to do with it.

1650
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:04,222
It scared me, Mom.

1651
01:11:06,766 --> 01:11:07,766
What happened after.

1652
01:11:14,357 --> 01:11:15,459
I wish
I'd gotten stronger faster.

1653
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:16,693
No...

1654
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,945
He was the love of your life.

1655
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:21,757
Of course, you were devastated.

1656
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:22,782
I don't blame you.

1657
01:11:25,243 --> 01:11:28,413
But I also...

1658
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:29,706
I don't ever want that.

1659
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:30,957
Oh...

1660
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:34,753
Lucy...

1661
01:11:34,794 --> 01:11:36,588
you can't go through life

1662
01:11:36,629 --> 01:11:38,923
avoiding things
that might bring you pain...

1663
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,301
You'll miss out
on what it has to offer.

1664
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,137
But then I won't be sad.

1665
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:45,638
Oh, honey.

1666
01:11:47,557 --> 01:11:48,808
You're sad right now.

1667
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:50,560
No.

1668
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:55,982
You can't avoid the hard parts.

1669
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,820
You have to face them,
no matter what happens.

1670
01:12:02,864 --> 01:12:03,864
Trust me on this one.

1671
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:07,118
Aww, honey.

1672
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:42,778
Come in.

1673
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:46,199
Good morning.

1674
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:47,241
How are you feeling?

1675
01:12:49,661 --> 01:12:52,122
I found Opa's recipe
for the Cupids.

1676
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,120
Such a little thing,
but it's caused so much trouble.

1677
01:12:57,711 --> 01:12:58,711
Come on.

1678
01:13:01,506 --> 01:13:02,841
Just come with me.

1679
01:13:08,763 --> 01:13:10,640
Mom, what are we doing here?

1680
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:11,683
I already told you I can't...

1681
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:13,101
I know. Just go.

1682
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:15,854
Thank you.

1683
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:16,937
Keep going.

1684
01:13:19,774 --> 01:13:21,359
Just a little further.

1685
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:26,698
Serena?

1686
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:30,063
When Helen called,
I had to come.

1687
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:33,663
Well, you've helped
so many people.

1688
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:35,290
They all wanted
to return the favor.

1689
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:40,879
Oh.

1690
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:43,172
You know I'm dramatic.

1691
01:13:43,214 --> 01:13:45,216
We had a fight.

1692
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,011
Which turned out
to be a good thing.

1693
01:13:48,053 --> 01:13:50,138
We cleared the air
on a lot of issues.

1694
01:13:53,475 --> 01:13:54,555
Now we're better than ever.

1695
01:13:56,353 --> 01:13:57,413
But now, I gotta go
back to work...

1696
01:13:57,437 --> 01:13:58,437
For you.

1697
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:53,576
Mr. Chase, they're ready.

1698
01:14:53,618 --> 01:14:54,619
Thank you.

1699
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:27,027
Even Claire and Malcolm's story?

1700
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:28,068
Everybody, yeah.

1701
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:31,740
Hi. Hi there.

1702
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:33,283
I was just telling your mom here

1703
01:15:33,324 --> 01:15:35,243
that I just got word
from the station.

1704
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:37,037
They had a technical malfunction

1705
01:15:37,078 --> 01:15:38,347
and now the piece
they had prepared

1706
01:15:38,371 --> 01:15:39,390
featuring the testimonials

1707
01:15:39,414 --> 01:15:41,124
is unusable.

1708
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:43,668
Is there anyone here now
from your Wall of Love

1709
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:44,710
to do a quick recording?

1710
01:15:46,629 --> 01:15:47,630
I can.

1711
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:50,925
Great!

1712
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:56,139
I met my late husband
in college.

1713
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:58,433
We were both dating
other people at the time,

1714
01:15:58,516 --> 01:16:00,352
so we were only friends, but...

1715
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:03,188
He always made me laugh.

1716
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:06,733
And I... I loved the fact

1717
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:08,401
that his parents
were chocolatiers,

1718
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:09,861
but Scott couldn't boil water.

1719
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,615
I guess that gene
skipped a generation.

1720
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:20,580
Things finally changed
between us

1721
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:23,625
about ten years
after graduation.

1722
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,420
I... I was shopping
for a Valentine's Day gift

1723
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:28,630
for some friends,

1724
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:30,382
and I wound up
in How Sweet It Is.

1725
01:16:30,423 --> 01:16:31,758
Helen?

1726
01:16:31,841 --> 01:16:33,468
Scott! Hi.

1727
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:35,988
Don't tell me you're baking now?

1728
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:38,098
I was just telling
my friend over there

1729
01:16:38,139 --> 01:16:40,100
about my dad's chocolate Cupids.

1730
01:16:40,141 --> 01:16:42,519
<i>They weren't for sale
to the public then,</i>

1731
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,187
<i>but friends and family
would drop by</i>

1732
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:45,331
<i>and the Sweets
would give them away.</i>

1733
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:46,856
Right.

1734
01:16:46,898 --> 01:16:48,817
I remember
you telling me that story.

1735
01:16:48,858 --> 01:16:50,360
About how each
of your parents ate one

1736
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:51,629
and then fell in love
in an instant.

1737
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:52,987
It's not a story,
it's the truth.

1738
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:55,407
You don't believe me?

1739
01:16:56,616 --> 01:16:57,701
I dare you to try.

1740
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,712
I couldn't resist.

1741
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:15,844
<i>Now, I don't know
if I fell in love with him</i>

1742
01:17:15,927 --> 01:17:18,054
<i>at that moment,</i>

1743
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:20,098
<i>or if I'd been in love with him
all along...</i>

1744
01:17:21,516 --> 01:17:22,726
I only know

1745
01:17:22,767 --> 01:17:24,769
that was the luckiest day
of my life.

1746
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:30,130
Just like losing him
was the hardest.

1747
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:34,112
But if you were to give me

1748
01:17:34,195 --> 01:17:37,157
a chance to go back
to that moment,

1749
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:39,117
when he gave me
that chocolate...

1750
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:40,952
knowing what I know now...

1751
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:43,079
I wouldn't hesitate
for a moment.

1752
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,126
Love is worth the grief.

1753
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:55,800
Oh, honey.

1754
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:07,478
Hey.

1755
01:18:09,022 --> 01:18:10,022
Thank you.

1756
01:18:17,489 --> 01:18:18,656
Hi.

1757
01:18:20,283 --> 01:18:21,385
Come on, I only have
a little bit of time.

1758
01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:22,494
Serena, I'm swamped.

1759
01:18:22,535 --> 01:18:23,495
You'll thank me later.

1760
01:18:23,536 --> 01:18:24,829
I really do thank you,

1761
01:18:24,871 --> 01:18:26,122
because you're the one

1762
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:27,350
who got all of this started
with your post.

1763
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:29,334
You helped me find
the love of my life...

1764
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:30,460
We're nowhere near even.

1765
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:33,337
But this dress will help.

1766
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:35,798
Come on.

1767
01:18:38,176 --> 01:18:39,176
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry.

1768
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:48,083
Excuse me.
Coming through. Emergency.

1769
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,105
Make way.

1770
01:18:50,188 --> 01:18:51,228
I gotta move.
Sorry. Sorry.

1771
01:18:52,732 --> 01:18:53,983
Excuse me.

1772
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,134
Wow.

1773
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:22,721
You made it.

1774
01:19:24,597 --> 01:19:25,724
I told you I would.

1775
01:19:25,765 --> 01:19:26,765
One minute.

1776
01:19:30,353 --> 01:19:32,063
Um...

1777
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:33,425
there's something
you should know.

1778
01:19:34,607 --> 01:19:35,775
You got the job.

1779
01:19:35,817 --> 01:19:37,527
Yes.

1780
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:38,820
And no.

1781
01:19:41,906 --> 01:19:43,384
Right before
I went into the interview,

1782
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:46,036
Nora called to offer me
the morning anchor position.

1783
01:19:47,537 --> 01:19:49,289
And I...

1784
01:19:49,372 --> 01:19:50,874
I felt so happy,

1785
01:19:50,915 --> 01:19:52,667
I just knew
it was the right choice for me.

1786
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:54,919
What about New York?

1787
01:19:54,961 --> 01:19:56,212
Oh, it turns out

1788
01:19:56,296 --> 01:19:57,898
it's too far away
from what I really want.

1789
01:19:57,922 --> 01:19:59,007
Get in position.

1790
01:20:05,513 --> 01:20:06,765
Come here.
Come on.

1791
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:11,561
Ten seconds.

1792
01:20:19,277 --> 01:20:21,321
Thank you, Kim.

1793
01:20:21,363 --> 01:20:22,781
Four weeks ago,

1794
01:20:22,822 --> 01:20:25,492
I heard about the legend
of the chocolate Cupids

1795
01:20:25,533 --> 01:20:27,369
from the chocolate shop
How Sweet It Is

1796
01:20:27,452 --> 01:20:29,162
in Watson Corners,

1797
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:31,081
run by Lucy and Helen Sweet.

1798
01:20:32,582 --> 01:20:34,125
After a post went viral,

1799
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:35,418
many people flocked here

1800
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,212
after hearing
that these chocolates

1801
01:20:37,253 --> 01:20:38,963
could lead you to true love...

1802
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,133
if your heart is open...

1803
01:20:42,175 --> 01:20:44,094
Which...

1804
01:20:44,135 --> 01:20:45,470
mine wasn't.

1805
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:51,810
But Lucy Sweet introduced me...

1806
01:20:51,851 --> 01:20:54,270
and many viewers...

1807
01:20:54,312 --> 01:20:57,065
to some of the couples
from the Wall of Love,

1808
01:20:57,107 --> 01:20:59,526
who met after
eating a chocolate.

1809
01:20:59,567 --> 01:21:00,902
And I have to admit,

1810
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:03,238
by the time we were done,

1811
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:05,323
even I was ready to believe
in the magic.

1812
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:12,733
But not because
of the chocolates.

1813
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,031
Because of the woman herself...

1814
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:20,797
and her own special magic...

1815
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:24,926
that has me completely
under her spell.

1816
01:21:30,181 --> 01:21:31,808
And because of that,

1817
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:34,352
I am excited to try
a chocolate Cupid myself today.

1818
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:39,357
Lucy... do you have one?

1819
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:50,284
There are two of them.

1820
01:21:52,537 --> 01:21:53,537
I thought maybe...

1821
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:58,393
I might try one, too,
if that's okay.

1822
01:22:01,546 --> 01:22:02,505
Only if they're both
the real thing.

1823
01:22:02,547 --> 01:22:03,965
No fakes.

1824
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:06,051
There's no fake Cupids.

1825
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:08,219
What about
the secret ingredient?

1826
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:12,182
If it's not love, or belief,
or paprika,

1827
01:22:12,223 --> 01:22:13,223
what is it?

1828
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:16,519
Bravery.

1829
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:20,732
What's more scary than
opening your heart to love?

1830
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:23,860
Putting it all on the line?

1831
01:22:26,696 --> 01:22:28,966
Everyone who tries one of these
is willing to do just that...

1832
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:30,158
To risk it all.

1833
01:22:32,827 --> 01:22:34,037
That's bravery.

1834
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:36,914
And I want to be brave.

1835
01:22:42,253 --> 01:22:44,547
Shall we?

1836
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:45,671
I thought you'd never ask.

1837
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:34,431
<i>My grandfather believed</i>

1838
01:23:34,514 --> 01:23:36,474
<i>all chocolate
was a form of magic.</i>

1839
01:23:38,226 --> 01:23:41,104
<i>But for magic to be its best,
it must have purpose.</i>

1840
01:23:42,897 --> 01:23:44,166
<i>And what greater purpose
is there</i>

1841
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:46,651
<i>than to love</i>

1842
01:23:46,735 --> 01:23:49,320
<i>and to be open to love
in return?</i>
