1
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,280
"Dearest Meg,
I'm having a glorious time.

2
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,720
I like them all.

3
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,760
They are the happiest,
jolliest family you can imagine.

4
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,640
The fun of it is,
they think me a noodle.

5
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,200
And say so.
At least Mr. Wilcox does.

6
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,240
Oh, Meg, shall we ever learn
to talk less.

7
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,440
But dearest Meg...

8
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,880
I don't know what to say
or what you will say.

9
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Paul Wilcox and I are in love.

10
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,800
We are engaged."

11
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,200
- Well, you Schlegel girls!
- Tibby, look.

12
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,920
Margaret, if I may interfere.

13
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,800
What is going on?

14
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,960
I can tell you nothing, aunt Juley.
I know no more than you do.

15
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,240
We only met the Wilcoxes last spring
while we were hiking in Germany.

16
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,120
Oh, dear.

17
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Someone must go down to Howards House
to make inquiries.

18
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,240
- Howards End.
- Inquiries are necessary.

19
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,920
What do we know about these Wilcoxes?
Are they our sort? Likely people?

20
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,960
But aunt Juley, what does it matter?

21
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,480
Helen's in love.
That's all I need to know.

22
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
Please get me a train timetable, dear.

23
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,680
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

24
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,240
Paul?

25
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,360
I'm afraid Crane
has reported sick again.

26
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,040
He was to take me to the Worrington's
today for tennis. I told them.

27
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,960
He's standing, of course.

28
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,640
Get rid of him, father,
hire a new chauffeur.

29
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,080
Mother, we're off. Good-bye.

30
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,520
Charlie, wait.

31
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,480
- What?
- Is papa there?

32
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,320
Wait a minute.
I've got some cherries.

33
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,680
- About last night.
- Nothing happened.

34
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,600
- I'm afraid I lost my head.
- Yes, we both did.

35
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,440
Must've been the moonlight,
except there was no moon.

36
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,040
Well, that's quite all right.

37
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,360
- Do you mind?
- No.

38
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,680
I have no money of my own...

39
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,640
and I have to make my way
in Nigeria.

40
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,280
It's beastly there for a white woman,
with the climate, natives and all that.

41
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,920
- I think you're a ripping girl.
- It's quite all right.

42
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,040
No one knows about it.

43
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,000
- Meg! I wrote to my sister.
- You didn't!

44
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,360
Yes, I'm sorry.
She's sure to come down. We must stop her.

45
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,320
We'll send a telegram.
Crane's off sick.

46
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,680
- Isn't there a bicycle?
- Yes, there is somewhere.

47
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,840
That'll be one and threepence 70,
sir.

48
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,320
M.J. Schlegel.
6 Wickham Place.

49
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,760
London, West.

50
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,760
"Dear Meg. All over.

51
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,640
Wish I'd never written.
Tell no one. Helen."

52
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,360
Excuse me. I'm looking for somewhere
called Howards House.

53
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,640
Mr. Wilcox, this lady
wants Howards End.

54
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,640
Forgive my asking. Are you
the younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder?

55
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,080
The younger.

56
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,520
The station's unorganized. If I had
my way, the whole lot would be sacked.

57
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,040
- Thank you, Bernard.
- Thank you, sir.

58
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,720
I should introduce myself.
I am miss Schlegel's aunt.

59
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,120
Rather. Yes, miss Schlegel's
stopping with us.

60
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,400
- Do you want to see her?
- That would be very nice.

61
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,600
I could run you up in the motor.

62
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,160
All the Schlegels are exceptional.

63
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,320
They are British to the backbone...

64
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,680
but their father was German...

65
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,600
and that is why they care for
literature and art.

66
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,520
Just one minute.

67
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,920
Wilcox, Howards End!

68
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,280
Know that I come
in no spirit of interference.

69
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,880
I'm here to represent the family...

70
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,240
and to talk to you about Helen, mr Wilcox,

71
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,360
my niece, and you.

72
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,480
Miss Schlegel and myself?

73
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,640
I trust there's no misunderstanding.

74
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,680
It's true I'm engaged to be married...

75
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
but to another young lady,
not to miss Schlegel.

76
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,720
Helen wrote to us.
She has told us everything.

77
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,960
Good god!
It's some foolery of Paul's!

78
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,720
- But you are Paul.
- No, I'm not.

79
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,200
- Why did you say so?
- I said nothing of the sort.

80
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,840
- You did.
- I did not. My name is Charles.

81
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,880
You mean to tell me that Paul
and your niece have... the idiot!

82
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,760
Damn fool!

83
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,240
Look, I warn you.

84
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,840
It's useless.
Paul hasn't a penny.

85
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,200
No need to warn us.
The warning is all the other way.

86
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,200
He hasn't told us, but your niece
lost no time in publishing the news.

87
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,720
If I were a man, for that last remark
I'd box your ears.

88
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,880
You're not fit to sit in the same room
as my niece.

89
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,360
- She spread the news, he hasn't.
- Or to clean her boots.

90
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,800
- Might I finish my sentence?
- No! I won't argue with such a person.

91
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,040
Let me out of this car this instant.

92
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,800
Don't stand up.
Sit down! Sit down!

93
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,520
Just sit down!
Goodness sakes!

94
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,560
It will, I think,
be generally admitted...

95
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,920
that Beethoven's fifth symphony...

96
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,680
is the most sublime noise...

97
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,240
ever to have penetrated
the ear of man.

98
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,640
But what does it mean?

99
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,560
You can hardly fail to recognize
in this music...

100
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,960
a mighty drama.

101
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,520
The struggle of a hero
beset by perils...

102
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,720
riding to magnificent victory
and ultimate triumph...

103
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,240
as described in the development section
of the first movement.

104
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,040
I want to draw your attention now
to the third movement.

105
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,480
We no longer hear the hero,
but a goblin.

106
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,440
Thank you, mother.

107
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,480
Single, solitary goblin...

108
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,680
walking across the universe...

109
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,640
from beginning to end.

110
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,040
Why a goblin?

111
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,440
- I beg your pardon?
- Why a goblin?

112
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,200
It's obvious.

113
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,000
The goblin signifies
the spirit of negation.

114
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,560
But why specifically a goblin?

115
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,080
Panic and emptiness.
That is what...

116
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
a goblin signifies.

117
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,080
Miss!

118
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Excuse me, miss,
but my umbrella.

119
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,360
Miss!

120
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,240
Miss?

121
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,800
Mrs. Wilcox never got
her wedding dress wet.

122
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,560
Hurry up, Charles.

123
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,320
In you go.

124
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,600
Good-bye. See you there.

125
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,560
Astonishing bad luck...

126
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,960
that in the whole of London
they could find no flat to rent...

127
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,520
except the one bottled right up
against our library window.

128
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Who could find no flat?

129
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,880
Tibby, the Wilcoxes.

130
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,400
Surely you remember that business
last summer...

131
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,600
with Helen and Paul Wilcox.

132
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,200
Paul Wilcox?

133
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,160
The one I was expected to thrash
within an inch of his life?

134
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,400
Oh, miss!

135
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,640
What is it?
Is Tibby ill?

136
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,480
Tibby's making tea.

137
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,760
Well, there's nothing worse than that.

138
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,480
Now, Helen...

139
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,960
something odd has happened.

140
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,920
Promise me you won't mind.

141
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,640
It's the Wilcoxes.

142
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,680
They've taken the flat opposite
for the wedding of their son.

143
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,640
The other son.

144
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,200
You do mind.

145
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Will Paul Wilcox point and say "There
lives the girl who tried to catch me"?

146
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,280
Ridiculous.

147
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,280
They've only taken the flat
for a few weeks, the porter said.

148
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,160
Do we bow or cut them dead?

149
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,520
Darling, why don't you take up
cousin Frieda's invitation...

150
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,560
and go to Hamburg
for those few weeks?

151
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,480
Yes, I think I shall.

152
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,880
Not that it matters, but...

153
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,520
one wouldn't want
to keep bumping into Wilcoxes.

154
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,960
Don't hog all those scones, Tibby.

155
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,560
Is that young man for us,
do you suppose?

156
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,680
He is for us.

157
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,880
If you'll pardon me, miss.
You took my umbrella.

158
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,360
Inadvertently, I'm sure.

159
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,920
At the ethical hall.
"Music and meaning."

160
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,720
I'm so sorry.

161
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,160
I do nothing but steal umbrellas.
Come in and choose one.

162
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,880
Let's see.
Is yours a hooky or a knobbly?

163
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,800
I think mine's a knobbly.

164
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,680
That's Tibby's. How about this one?
You shouldn't open these indoors.

165
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,400
It's gone along the seams.

166
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,640
This is an appalling umbrella.
It must be mine.

167
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,560
I'm sorry.

168
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,680
Has my sister stolen your umbrella?

169
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,320
Not again, Helen. She is
an incorrigible thief. I am so sorry.

170
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,880
Do stay for tea, Mr...

171
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
- Bast.
- Won't you stay for tea?

172
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
Do stay for tea.

173
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,920
It's the least we can do,
having made you all wet.

174
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,880
Our brother's upstairs
to chaperone.

175
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,440
- He's soaked, Meg. Please come up.
- Bring him upstairs.

176
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,280
What did you think of the lecture?
I don't agree about goblins.

177
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,280
But I do about the heroes
and shipwreck.

178
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,840
I'd always imagined a trail of elephants
dancing at that point.

179
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,960
He obviously didn't.
"Music and meaning", Margaret.

180
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,760
Does music have meaning,
of the literary kind, I mean?

181
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
- That's pure slush.
- We've a guest.

182
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,000
- Mr. Bast, take off your coat.
- Trust us with your umbrella.

183
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,440
- Sit down.
- Have some tea.

184
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,680
How boring it would be
if it were only the score.

185
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,640
China tea? Only the score?
What an insidious omen.

186
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,960
We have other tea if you prefer.

187
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,480
Thank you.

188
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,840
Here's some scones
that Tibby hasn't yet consumed.

189
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,840
We're sorry to have inconvenienced you.
I hope you will come another day.

190
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,280
Would you?

191
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,680
We should be so glad.
Do take our card.

192
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,280
Thank you.

193
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,560
If you'll excuse me,
i must be going.

194
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,320
I'll see you out. Are you sure
you don't want a spot for the journey?

195
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,400
No, thank you.
I must be going. Good-bye.

196
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,880
Why didn't you make
that young man welcome, Tibby?

197
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,920
You must do the host a little,
you know.

198
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,920
You could've coaxed him into stopping...

199
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,040
instead of letting him be swamped
by screaming women.

200
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,840
Get your hot soup here!

201
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,280
Hot soup! Lovely and warm.

202
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,760
That you, Len?

203
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,080
Where have you been?

204
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,480
- I'm off my head with worrying.
- About what?

205
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,040
- About you.
- Let go, Jacky.

206
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,000
Every time I'm five minutes late,
you see me lying dead in the road...

207
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,000
crushed and killed
in a gruesome accident.

208
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,160
People do get killed in accidents
and don't come home no more.

209
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,640
Anymore, Jacky.

210
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,080
I told you I was going to a lecture
on "Music and meaning".

211
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,680
I lost my umbrella.

212
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,080
It's all right.
I got it back.

213
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,040
Have you had your tea?

214
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
I've cut you a bit
of tongue and jelly.

215
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,440
Sure?

216
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,120
I'll have it, then.

217
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,800
Funny, isn't it?

218
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,320
Every time I worry,
i get starving hungry.

219
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,280
Thoughts that go through my head!

220
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,880
You'd laugh.

221
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,800
You listening, Len?

222
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,560
Not only accidents...

223
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,640
but you'll get wet in the rain.

224
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,720
- Did you?
- No.

225
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,640
You said you lost your umbrella.

226
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,880
I thought, "Lord, he'll catch cold.
It'll go to his chest.

227
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,120
Where's the money to come from
for the doctor?

228
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,520
And what if he is in an accident...

229
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,040
and they take him to the hospital
in the ambulance?

230
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,720
- And him with holes in his socks."
- Hey, Jacky!

231
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,400
- I want to see.
- What?

232
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,280
- If there's holes in your socks.
- Stop it, Jacky!

233
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,360
Len...

234
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,480
come to bed.

235
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,480
I'll finish this chapter.

236
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,600
- You love your Jacky?
- Let me read.

237
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,720
Len, are you going to make it all right?

238
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,600
You're not starting on that again.

239
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,080
I've told you a hundred times,
we'll get married the day I'm 21.

240
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,080
I'd do it before if my brother
wouldn't come and put a stop to it.

241
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,440
What's it to him?
What's he ever done for me?

242
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,440
That's right.
What's anyone ever done?

243
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,240
It's just you and me.

244
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,840
If you was to leave me,
I don't know what i'd do.

245
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,800
I truly don't.

246
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,200
Now go to bed.

247
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,400
You come, too.

248
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,920
Come on.

249
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,520
Bookmarker.

250
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,640
"Margaret Schlegel."

251
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,240
And who is Margaret Schlegel?

252
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,320
A lady I met.

253
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,560
A lady. La-di-da.

254
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Come off it.
She's 100 years old.

255
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,240
Says you.
So that's where you had your tea.

256
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Nice cucumber sandwiches
cut ever so thin.

257
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,400
"Ankle deep, he waded
through the bluebells.

258
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
His spirit rose and exalted...

259
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,720
as he breathed in
the sun-drenched air.

260
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,600
The glorious day
was in its last decline.

261
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,240
Long shadows lay on the sward...

262
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,800
and from above the leaves dripped their
shimmering drops of gold-green light.

263
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Moths and butterflies
swarmed in merry hosts...

264
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,960
flittering here,
glimmering there.

265
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,000
But, hush!
Could that be a deer?"

266
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,560
Oh, please, show her in.

267
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
So sorry.

268
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,240
Why, miss Schlegel.

269
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,200
How kind of you to call.

270
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,520
I wanted to for ever so long.

271
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,040
But we haven't been here
for ever so long.

272
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,600
Mrs. Wilcox...

273
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,400
May I?

274
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,160
All that business last summer
at Howards End...

275
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,160
No, it goes further than that.

276
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,960
Since we met at Speyer.
Do you remember?

277
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,440
That restored cathedral
that we all hated so.

278
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,320
What I remember principally
about Speyer...

279
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,560
was the great pleasure
of meeting you, miss Schlegel.

280
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,000
Helen's gone to Germany.

281
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,320
And Paul's gone to Nigeria.

282
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,120
Now we can meet
because they can't.

283
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,080
It's no use beating about the bush.
What happened in the summer...

284
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,680
was unfortunate for both of them,
don't you feel?

285
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,640
I'm sure you think the same way.
Because they should not meet.

286
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,080
Yes, I feel that.

287
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,680
They belong to types that can fall
in love but can't live together.

288
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,840
I'm afraid that in 9 cases out of 10...

289
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,160
nature pulls one way
and human nature the other.

290
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,880
I do rattle on.
I shall tire you out in no time.

291
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,000
It is true, I am not
particularly well just today.

292
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,640
But I'm so grateful for your visit, miss Schlegel.

293
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,560
You see, I'm quite alone.

294
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,640
My husband and daughter have gone off
on a motoring tour in Yorkshire.

295
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,720
And the young couple are on
their honeymoon. Charles and Dolly.

296
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,760
May I see? How lovely.

297
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,640
They've gone to Naples.

298
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,680
- I can hardly imagine Charles in Naples.
- Doesn't he like traveling?

299
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,440
Yes, he likes travel.

300
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,960
But he does see through foreigners.

301
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,280
What he would enjoy most
is a motor tour through England.

302
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,800
Charles takes after me, miss Schlegel.

303
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,240
He truly loves England.

304
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Not, of course, London.
None of us love London.

305
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,880
It's so...

306
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,360
it makes one feel so unstable,
impermanent...

307
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,640
with the houses being torn down
on all sides.

308
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,560
Including,
in the foreseeable future, ours.

309
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,880
- Are you having to leave Wickham Place?
- Yes.

310
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,360
In 18 months when the lease expires.

311
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,120
- Have you been there long?
- All our lives. We were born there.

312
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,080
That is monstrous!

313
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,160
I do pity you from
the bottom of my heart.

314
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,200
I had no idea this thing
was hanging over you.

315
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,160
How dreadful!

316
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,520
You poor, poor girls.

317
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,720
Of course, we are fond of the house...

318
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,440
but it is an ordinary London house.

319
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,680
We shall easily find another.

320
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,160
No, not in this world.

321
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,120
Not the house that you were born in.

322
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
You'll never find that again.
Poor, poor girls.

323
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,560
Howards End was almost pulled down once.

324
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,720
It would've killed me.

325
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,840
It's my house, you know. It was left to me
by my brother who died out in India.

326
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,040
I love it so.

327
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,000
I even resisted when Henry,
my husband...

328
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,680
wanted to make changes
to improve the property.

329
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,480
He knew best of course.

330
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,480
We even have a garage...

331
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,800
to the west of the house...

332
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,360
just beyond the chestnut tree...

333
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,320
in the paddock...

334
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,320
where the pony used to be.

335
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,240
Where's the pony gone?

336
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,680
The pony? Dead, ever so long ago.

337
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,320
The vice of the pan-german mind is that
it only cares for what it can use.

338
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,840
- That is the vice of the imperial mind.
- The vice of the vulgar mind.

339
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,880
But... and this is a tremendous "but"...
they take poetry seriously.

340
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,680
- They take poetry seriously.
- Is anything gained by that?

341
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,960
Yes! The Germans
are always striving for beauty.

342
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,080
Mrs. Wilcox, my father
was a German of the old school.

343
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,000
A philosopher, an idealist.

344
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,920
The countryman of Hegel and Kant.

345
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,600
Isn't that your father's sword
upstairs in the drawing room?

346
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,000
Yes. He was a soldier, too,
when he had to be.

347
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,640
He was so uncomfortable
about being on the winning side...

348
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,320
he just hung up his sword
and never used it again.

349
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,280
My idea has always been...

350
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,360
if we could bring the mothers...

351
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,400
of the various nations together...

352
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,160
then there would be no more war.

353
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,680
- Indeed, yes.
- Absolutely.

354
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,480
If the mothers went to war,
there'd be no one left to defend.

355
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,800
- Have another cutlet.
- Thank you.

356
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,080
You are fortunate
in your cook.

357
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,480
We have found it difficult to get
reliable servants in london.

358
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,880
Servants have become
as unreliable as we are.

359
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,800
And we can hardly expect them to listen
to radical discussions at the table.

360
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,560
Annie does very well, don't you Annie?
You're very patient with us.

361
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,080
We never discuss at Howards End...

362
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,000
except, perhaps, sport.

363
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,280
But you should.
Discussion keeps a house alive.

364
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,040
You will laugh
at my old-fashioned ideas.

365
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,240
I will not.

366
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,640
I sometimes think...

367
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,160
it would be wiser to leave action
and discussion to men.

368
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,240
Then where would we be
with the suffrage?

369
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,960
I am only too thankful
not to have the vote myself.

370
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,640
Shall we go up for coffee?

371
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,360
Will you lead the way?
Thank you.

372
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,080
What interesting lives you all lead.

373
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,000
No, we don't.

374
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,360
It's no use you pretending
you enjoyed lunch. You loathed it.

375
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,720
But I hope you will forgive me...

376
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,600
by coming again alone,
or by asking me to you.

377
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,960
I enjoyed my lunch very much.

378
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,080
Truly I did. I only wish
I could've joined in more.

379
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,640
You're so clever, and yet so good.

380
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,320
It's kind of you,
but I'm neither, I'm afraid.

381
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,360
You've been very good to me.
You've kept me from brooding.

382
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,920
I'm too apt to brood.

383
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,400
About what?

384
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,560
I really don't know.

385
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,760
I think about my house a great deal.

386
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,800
You've never seen Howards End.
I want to show it to you.

387
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,600
Now, this is the scientific approach
to christmas shopping: A list.

388
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,920
A list? What a good idea.

389
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,840
Why don't you put your own name
at the top of the list?

390
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,560
Hooray!

391
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,040
How very kind of you
to start with me. Schlegel.

392
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,440
Now next. Shall I put Mr. Wilcox?

393
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,640
I know, these.

394
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,600
What do you think of that?

395
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,280
Oh, yes. Thank you very much.

396
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,960
- Good, I'm glad.
- You are wonderfully efficient.

397
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,120
- Wrap that with a nice paper.
- Certainly.

398
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,120
But your name still remains
at the top of the list.

399
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,000
Yes. So, Dolly.

400
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,320
I would like to give you something
worth your friendship.

401
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,200
Couldn't you get it renewed?

402
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,480
- I beg your pardon?
- The lease on your house.

403
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,000
Have you been thinking of that?
How kind of you.

404
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,400
- Surely something could be done.
- No, values have risen enormously.

405
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,080
They mean to pull down Wickham Place
and build flats like yours.

406
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,840
- But they're horrible.
- Landlords are horrible.

407
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,280
And so are the flats they build.

408
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,720
I fail to understand how people...

409
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,440
can actually choose to live in them.

410
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,760
There we are.

411
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,120
There we are. Thank you.

412
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,760
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

413
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,360
Thank you.

414
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,320
I sorry. We shouldn't
have done this today.

415
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,760
No, no.
We had to do it before.

416
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,920
Before?

417
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,200
Before my operation.

418
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,200
I still haven't told my family yet.
Everyone hates illnesses.

419
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,120
That's as it should be.

420
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,440
There's a chestnut tree
at Howards End...

421
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,360
that has pig's teeth
stuck into the trunk...

422
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,440
about four feet from the ground.

423
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,400
Yes, the teeth of a pig.

424
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,400
The country people put them there
long ago...

425
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,680
and they think that if they chew
a piece of the bark...

426
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,320
it will cure the toothache.

427
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,720
I love folklore...

428
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,360
and the old superstitions.

429
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,680
Isn't it curious, though,
that unlike Greece...

430
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,640
England has no true mythology?

431
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,000
All we have
are witches and fairies.

432
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,200
Will you come with me to Howards End?

433
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,400
- I would so much like to.
- Come with me now.

434
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,520
- Now? It's too late...
- there's a train at 5:00 if we hurry.

435
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,120
- I want you to see it.
- And I want to see it.

436
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,000
It sounds such a glorious place,
so redolent.

437
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,680
Yes. I lived there long before
i was married.

438
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,040
I was born there.

439
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,400
Might I come some other day?

440
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,680
Yes.

441
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,920
Some other day.

442
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,720
Well, a thousand thanks, miss Schlegel,
for your help.

443
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,000
It is a comfort to have the presents
off my mind.

444
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,320
The christmas cards especially.

445
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,520
I do admire your choice.

446
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,000
Mrs. Wilcox.

447
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,120
- I will come, if I still may.
- Return to Hilton, please.

448
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,360
You must stop the night, my dear.

449
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,000
It's in the morning
my house looks most beautiful.

450
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,560
Two returns, please.

451
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,000
Thank you.

452
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,200
This is yours?

453
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,280
I can't show you my meadow properly
except in sunlight.

454
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,560
It was so romantic.
It was in Italy.

455
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,280
Yes, and the two trains stopped
on either side.

456
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,040
I opened the window and this man
handed a rose across.

457
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,280
I don't know where he got it.

458
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,560
- Was he Italian?
- Yes, I think so. Italian.

459
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,520
He'd have to be Italian,
wouldn't he?

460
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,640
- Mother!
- Evie!

461
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,080
- You never wrote. Look who I found.
- What are you doing here?

462
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,880
We crashed the car. Are you going
to Howards End? Why? How are you?

463
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,640
It's such a lovely surprise
I'm fit as a fiddle.

464
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,320
- Do you remember miss Schlegel?
- Yes. How are you?

465
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,520
We crashed the car in Yorkshire.

466
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,400
We must go home. You can't go
to Howards End. It's 10 to 5:00.

467
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Miss Schlegel, I'm afraid our outing
will have to be another day.

468
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,320
- Before I forget.
- There's a German expression with that.

469
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,800
Yes. Not canceled but postponed.
Come home with us.

470
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,040
No, no. Please. Good-bye.

471
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,080
Till later.

472
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,320
How lovely to see you.

473
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,400
I've been thinking of you.

474
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,920
And of our meadow.

475
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,800
Here.

476
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,120
The day you are strong enough...

477
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,520
i shall hold you to your promise.

478
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,120
Oh, miss Schlegel.

479
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,840
So, to repeat.
We have here...

480
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,120
forwarded by the matron
of that nursing home...

481
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,240
sealed and addressed to me...

482
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,440
a note purporting
to be in your mother's handwriting.

483
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,360
And it says...

484
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,240
"I would like miss Schlegel,
Margaret...

485
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,720
to have Howards End."

486
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,040
Mother never wrote that.

487
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,280
No date.

488
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,960
No signature.

489
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,440
Of course.
It's a forgery.

490
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,040
Not now, please, later. Thank you.

491
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,080
The house was of course your mother's
to leave to whom she wished.

492
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,200
Let me see it.

493
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,280
Why, it's only in pencil.
Pencil never counts.

494
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,120
Yes, we know it is not legally binding,
Dolly. We are aware of that.

495
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,120
Of course, my dear, we consider you
as one of the family.

496
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,360
But it is better if you don't interfere
with what you don't understand.

497
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,200
The question is...

498
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,320
whether, during the time miss Schlegel
managed to befriend my mother...

499
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,640
I don't think this is a case
of undue influence.

500
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,440
To my mind the question is...

501
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,840
the invalid's condition
when the note was written.

502
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,640
My dear father,
consult an expert if you wish...

503
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,200
but I don't admit
it is my mother's handwriting.

504
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,200
You just said it was.

505
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,600
Never mind if I did.

506
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,040
So we're all agreed then that I would be
legally justified in tearing this up.

507
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,440
And all else aside...

508
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,720
how is this gift to be conveyed
to miss Schlegel?

509
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,440
Is she to have a life interest in it
or is she to own it absolutely?

510
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,800
She may be on her way down
this very minute to turn us all out.

511
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,520
I don't believe miss Schlegel
knows anything about this...

512
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,280
this whim of your mother's.

513
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,560
Mother believed so in ancestors.

514
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,360
She would never have left anything
to an outsider.

515
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,200
If miss Schlegel had been poor,
if she'd wanted a house...

516
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,760
but she has a house.
Why should she want another?

517
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,840
She wouldn't have wanted us
to even see this thing.

518
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,280
Your poor mother
would not have wanted it.

519
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,960
Len, you coming in?

520
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,720
In a minute.

521
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,120
Right.

522
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,160
What are you looking at?

523
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,960
See that big one up there?
That's Ursa Major.

524
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,960
Great bear.

525
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,800
You follow those two down
about four times...

526
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,600
and that one there is the Pole star,
I'm fairly certain.

527
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,200
They're just stars.

528
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,120
Jacky, stop it.
It's important.

529
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,400
You'll catch your death.

530
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,160
Excuse me, sir.
The policy.

531
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,960
Yes, yes.
That's all signed.

532
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,080
Would you read that?

533
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,000
Yes, of course.

534
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,080
"The trees reared
in mighty columns...

535
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,440
their tops still radiant
in sunlight...

536
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,720
which, spilling down,
went through the wealth of leaves...

537
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,880
dissolved at last
in the darkness of the mossy earth.

538
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,800
Their color slowly faded
from out of the flowers.

539
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,560
But their scent lingered
to honey the air he breathed."

540
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,840
There's a woman to see you, ma'am.

541
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,120
A woman and not a lady, Annie?

542
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,120
- She won't give her name.
- Ask her to come up.

543
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,000
She says she won't come up.

544
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,800
Then we shall have to go down.

545
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,960
Good afternoon.

546
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,080
- I'm looking for my husband.
- Here?

547
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,680
Thank you, Annie.

548
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,160
I have my reasons
to believe that he is here.

549
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,160
- You're welcome to search for him.
- I'm so sorry.

550
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,080
- Your husband's name.
- Leonard Bast, as I'm sure you're aware of.

551
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,520
Margaret, are we concealing
a Mr. Leonard Bast?

552
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,200
There appears to have been some mistake, mrs Bast.

553
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,760
I do not think we are acquainted
with your husband.

554
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,760
No, there's no mistake.

555
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,160
I know for a fact he has visited
in this house.

556
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,400
- He had his tea here.
- That is a grave allegation.

557
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,320
Yes, to have corrupted a married man
with giving him tea.

558
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,920
I wish we could help you, mrs Bast.

559
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,040
It seems you can't...

560
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,560
or won't...

561
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,960
except to have a laugh
at my expense.

562
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,240
So I'm very sorry to have troubled you,
and wish you a good afternoon.

563
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,160
Do what you can for the house.
The drawing room reeks of smoke.

564
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,400
With Rita smoking, too,
the house might be more mousier.

565
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,080
I doubt it.

566
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,000
This is lovely.

567
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,160
There's a Mr. Leonard Bast.

568
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,000
- It must be him.
- The one you corrupted with tea.

569
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,520
- I'll do the host.
- Thank you.

570
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,000
Mr. Bast, come this way.

571
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,400
Do come in, Mr. Bast. Good evening.

572
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,840
- Do come in and have pudding with us.
- Or would you prefer some dinner?

573
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,040
- I've had my tea, thank you.
- Have a chair.

574
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,000
Glass of wine? Port?

575
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,440
No, thank you.

576
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,120
Do take a seat, and let us know
how we can help you.

577
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,960
You wouldn't remember giving me this?

578
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,080
- Not at the time.
- That was how it happened, you see.

579
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,760
- How what happened?
- Where did we meet, Mr. Bast?

580
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,320
I don't remember.

581
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,240
It was more than a year ago
at The ethical society.

582
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,200
The lecture was on "Music and meaning".

583
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,840
I see. The mistake arose
out of my card, did it?

584
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,680
The lady who called here yesterday thought
you were calling as well and would find you here.

585
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,960
In the afternoon, I said to my wife...

586
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,080
I said to mrs. Bast,
"I have to pay a call on some friends."

587
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,040
Mrs. Bast said to me, "Do go".

588
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,160
But while I was gone,
she wanted me on important business...

589
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,840
and thought I had come here,
owing to the card.

590
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,960
I tender my apologies, and hers...

591
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,240
for any inconvenience
we may have caused you.

592
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,040
- None at all.
- I still don't understand.

593
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,080
When did you say you paid
this afternoon call?

594
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,360
In the afternoon, of course.

595
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,280
Saturday afternoon or Sunday?

596
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,800
- Saturday.
- Really?

597
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,000
And you were still calling on Sunday
when your wife came here?

598
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,600
A long visit.

599
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,800
It was good of you to come and explain, mr Bast.

600
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,040
The rest is no concern of ours.

601
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,480
We are going upstairs for coffee.
I do hope you will join us.

602
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,520
- Annie, pour the coffee.
- It's not what you think.

603
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,880
I was...

604
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,280
i left my office and walked.

605
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,920
Right out of London.

606
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,240
I was walking all Saturday night.

607
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,000
All night? In the dark?

608
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,960
So dark I couldn't see my own hand.

609
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,840
Mr. Bast, you must be
a born explorer.

610
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,920
I tried to steer by Pole star, but
everything gets mixed and I lost it.

611
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,840
Don't tell me about Pole star.

612
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,720
It goes round and round,
and you go round with it.

613
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,840
Yes, but why?
Why did you do it?

614
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,560
I wanted to just walk.

615
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,880
Just get out.

616
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,800
I've been reading The Ordeal
of Richard Feverel.

617
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,280
I remember. There's that chapter
where Richard walks all night.

618
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,400
- In a forest by moonlight.
- What was that wonderful...

619
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,040
i know exactly what you mean.

620
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,760
"The forest drooped glimmeringly."

621
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,560
Wait, I'll get it.

622
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,760
The chapter's called "Nature speaks".

623
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,360
- Where do your people come from?
- London.

624
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,440
Yes, I know. I mean before that.

625
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,400
They didn't always live in a town.

626
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,760
No. They came
from around Shropshire.

627
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,680
They worked on the land.

628
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,720
They were agricultural laborers.

629
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,960
There. You see?
It was ancestral voices calling you.

630
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,040
Here it is.

631
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,480
"Richard was walking hurriedly.

632
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,160
A pale gray light on the skirts of
the flying tempest displayed the dawn."

633
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,560
- Did you see the dawn?
- Yes, suddenly it got light.

634
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,360
- Was it wonderful?
- No.

635
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,280
It was only gray. Anyway, by that time
i was so tired and hungry...

636
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,680
i didn't know when you're walking,
you want breakfast, lunch and tea.

637
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,320
All I had was a packet of Woodbines.

638
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,160
Give Mr. Bast money!

639
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,000
We really must go.

640
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,480
Meg, come on.

641
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,600
Mr. Bast wouldn't know what to do
if you gave him money.

642
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,520
Nonsense. Money is educational,
more than the things it buys.

643
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,760
Such crass materialism
out of your mouth.

644
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,120
Give him money.
Let us give Mr. Bast money.

645
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,880
What would it profit him if he gained
the whole world and lost his own soul?

646
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,880
He won't gain his soul until he has
enough money. Give Mr. Bast money.

647
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,320
Good-bye.

648
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,480
Thank you.

649
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,760
What do you think is
the most important thing in the world?

650
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,480
I suppose it is whatever matters
to you most.

651
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,240
- Like love, for instance?
- Like love or Oxford, if you're Tibby.

652
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,480
- Henry Wilcox.
- Oh, hello!

653
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,680
- Good evening.
- How nice to see you.

654
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,520
Wonderful surprise.
I heard two ladies talking of love.

655
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,400
We were continuing
a serious discussion.

656
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,400
Yes. We belong to a club which meets
once a week to discuss subjects.

657
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,080
How are you? I would have thought
you'd be down at Howards End.

658
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,680
Howards End is let.
We've bought a house in Mayfair.

659
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,040
Supposing you were a millionaire.

660
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,480
But I expect you are one.

661
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,680
We have met a young man who is poor,
sensitive and intelligent.

662
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,880
We wondered, if one was a millionaire,
how one could help him.

663
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,600
- What's his profession?
- He's a clerk in...

664
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,400
The Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company.

665
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,800
- Porphyrion?
- Yes.

666
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,400
Then, miss Schlegel,
if I were to help your young clerk...

667
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,600
i'd advise him to clear out of
The Porphyrion with all possible speed.

668
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,080
- Why?
- This is between friends, understand.

669
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,200
The Porphyrion will be in
the receivers' hands before christmas.

670
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,160
In other words, it'll smash.

671
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,880
Do you hear?
Helen, The Porphyrion will smash!

672
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,000
We must warn Mr. Bast
to get another place.

673
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,640
I hope quickly.

674
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,640
- But rather than wait to make sure?
- Decidedly.

675
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,040
The man already in a situation
when he applies for work...

676
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,160
stands a much better chance.

677
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,760
This is letting you
into state secrets...

678
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,280
but it does affect an employer greatly.

679
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,200
Human nature, I'm afraid.

680
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,640
Our human nature
appears to be the other way.

681
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,280
We employ people because
they're unemployed. The boot man.

682
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,000
- How does he clean the boots?
- Not well.

683
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,720
There you are.

684
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,840
Is it difficult for a clerk
to get a situation?

685
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,840
- Yes, extremely.
- I'm so sorry about Howards End.

686
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,440
That you're not living there.

687
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,040
I have some idea how much
her house meant to mrs. Wilcox.

688
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,840
Yes, but to us, the family,
it has certain drawbacks.

689
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,200
Would you be able to help our friend
to a new situation?

690
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,200
Well, unfortunately we have
very few positions and vacancies.

691
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,880
When there is one,
there's always hundreds of applicants.

692
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,320
Of course.

693
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,200
- It has been a pleasure.
- Yes, indeed.

694
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,400
I hope your young clerk
finds success.

695
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,360
Thank you. Good night.

696
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,360
He was in a hurry to get away.

697
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,720
Mr. Bast, I fear you may have thought
our letter a little odd.

698
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,480
We're not odd,
just over expressive.

699
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,080
The more a lady has to say, the better.
Ladies brighten every conversation.

700
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,600
I know, the darlings
are regular sunbeams.

701
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,120
Your company is The Porphyrion,
isn't it?

702
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,040
Would you call it a solid concern?

703
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,520
Cake? This big one
or one of these little deadlies?

704
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,200
It depends what you mean by solid.

705
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,520
We were told
The Porphyrion's a no-go.

706
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:39,160
A friend of ours did think
that it's insufficiently reinsured.

707
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,920
- And advised you to clear out.
- You can tell your friend he's wrong.

708
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,480
Oh, good!

709
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,040
Wrong, so to speak.

710
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,440
How, so to speak?

711
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,600
I wouldn't say he was right altogether.

712
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,680
Then he is right partly?

713
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,800
Tell your friend
to mind his own business.

714
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,800
Mr. Wilcox, miss Wilcox.

715
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,760
What a surprise!

716
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,800
- Pardon the intrusion.
- Mr. Wilcox, do come in.

717
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,640
Please forgive us
for this unexpected visit.

718
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,800
Mr. Bast, come play
with the puppies.

719
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,080
This is Mr. Bast.

720
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,000
I must be going.

721
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,960
- Must you really?
- Oh, come again.

722
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,120
No, I shan't come again.

723
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,720
I call that a very rude remark.
What do you want to turn on me for?

724
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,960
I thought you invited me here
for a friendly chat.

725
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,600
Instead you want to pick my brains
about my place of business.

726
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,080
Oh, yes, cross-question him,
pick his brains?

727
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,040
Are we intruding?
Shall we go?

728
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,720
Helen, go after him. Explain.

729
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,960
What was all that about?

730
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,800
I shouldn't have come. Before was all
right, but things like that get spoiled.

731
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,240
Things do, but people don't!

732
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,960
Don't you understand? We really did
want to warn you about The Porphyrion.

733
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,040
We were worried about you.

734
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,000
Why should you worry about me?

735
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,680
Because we like you!
That's why!

736
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,560
- You noodle.
- No cause to call a person names.

737
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,160
There is when a person
is being tremendously stupid.

738
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,680
Listen, this is serious.

739
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,960
Our friend said you should look for
another post before anything happens.

740
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,400
- Will you?
- I'll think about it.

741
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,800
You must do more. You must search for
another place while you still have one.

742
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,240
Promise you'll do that at least?
Please!

743
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,920
Ali right.

744
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,880
Thank you, miss Schlegel.

745
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,040
Come and tell us when you've found
another place. Or just come anyway.

746
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,160
Don't say no.
Don't dare to say no!

747
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,120
And don't forget your umbrella
or you'll say we pinched it.

748
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,320
You ought to be more careful. Your
servants should not let such people in.

749
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,440
But we invited him in.

750
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,040
We wanted to see him again,
talk to him and maybe help him.

751
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,200
Not only in a practical way.

752
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,880
You're too kind. You behave too well
to people, and then they impose on you.

753
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,240
I know the world and that type of man.

754
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,040
But he is not a type.

755
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:31,960
No. He is a quite unusual young man.
And he has something in him.

756
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,040
I don't know what it is except he wants
something better than he's got.

757
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,400
- Oh.
- Yes.

758
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,440
He has romantic ambition.

759
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,080
It is your view of him
that is romantic.

760
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,160
We wish you to have something
to remember mrs. Wilcox by...

761
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,320
in return for your kindness.

762
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,320
Oh, thank you so much.

763
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,280
What a lovely thought.
Thank you.

764
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,800
She would want you to have it.
She spoke very fondly of you.

765
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,040
It's beautifull
are you sure?

766
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,760
Is it 18th century?
Must be crystal.

767
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,760
Thank you.
Thank you, Evie.

768
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,240
What's she look like?

769
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,400
An old maid type. Goodness knows
why father wanted me to ask her.

770
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,320
She talks and talks...
here she is.

771
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,160
- Miss Schlegel.
- Miss Wilcox.

772
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,800
How do you do?
This is my fiance Percy Cahill.

773
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,240
How do you do?

774
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:33,080
- Ah, good afternoon!
- Hello. I didn't expect to see you.

775
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,480
Evie told me of her little plot,
so I secured a table. Evie, sit there.

776
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,920
Miss Schlegel, if you please here.

777
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,880
Mr. Cahill, there.

778
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,800
Are you still worrying around
after your young clerks?

779
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,400
- I hope you're hungry.
- Famished. I want to eat heaps.

780
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,360
Good. What will you have?

781
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,200
Fish pie.

782
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,600
Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson's.
It's not a fit thing to go for here.

783
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,240
- Go for something for me then.
- Right.

784
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,840
Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding
and cider to drink.

785
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,080
That's the type of thing to go for.

786
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,320
I like this place. It's so thoroughly
old english. Don't you agree?

787
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,080
I began an inventory of our possessions.

788
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,680
There are over 300 things
in the drawing room alone. Thank you.

789
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,080
And that's not counting the books!
Whatever shall I do?

790
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:29,040
The modern ownership of movables
is reducing us again to a nomadic horde.

791
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,120
We are averting
to a civilization of luggage, mr Wilcox.

792
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

793
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,200
Always tip the carver.
"Tip everybody" is my motto.

794
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,560
- Perhaps it does make life more human.
- And these fellows remember one again.

795
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,080
Especially in the east. If you tip,
they'll remember you from year to year.

796
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,840
- Have you been in the east?
- Yes. Greece, Livanatai.

797
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,680
I used to go for sport
and business to Cyprus.

798
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,160
A few piastres help
to keep one's memory green.

799
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,840
How shockingly cynical.

800
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,280
Not a bit.
Simply realistic.

801
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,680
- How would you like your meat?
- Well-done.

802
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,760
You don't like cheese.
You never take cheese.

803
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,720
- I adore cheese.
- You said you didn't.

804
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,240
That's the most despicable lie.
You've grown quite pink.

805
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,200
- I haven't.
- Your ears are pink about the tips.

806
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,640
I like that.

807
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,280
Miss Schlegel expects me to act
as house agent for her.

808
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,120
I want a new home in September,
and someone must find it. I can't.

809
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,040
Do you know of anything, Percy?

810
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,720
Can't say I do.

811
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,040
I wish you would give us
Howards End.

812
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,200
I'm afraid it's let.

813
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,640
Can't you turn out your tenant,
let it to us?

814
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,640
We're nearly demented.

815
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,240
Mr. Wilcox, I am demented.

816
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,120
One bit of advice.

817
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,200
Fix your district, fix your price,
then don't budge.

818
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,120
That's how I got Ducie Street
and Oniton.

819
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,680
I shall...

820
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,160
I shall look around for you.

821
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,680
- Would you?
- Yes.

822
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,560
Would you really?
How kind!

823
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,120
I warn you, the house has not been built
that would suit the Schlegel family.

824
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,040
It's no fun trying to help us.

825
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,760
Fun? No, but a pleasure
and a privilege...

826
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,240
to do whatever I can
for miss Margaret Schlegel.

827
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,680
Thank you very much.

828
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,920
"Dear miss Schlegel...

829
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,120
dare I intrude on your holiday in Devon
and request you to come up to London?

830
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,520
Where, I may add,
you are greatly missed.

831
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,480
Matter is of some urgency."

832
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,440
But to interrupt your holiday!

833
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,120
And before we have undertaken
any of our excursions.

834
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,640
You haven't even been
to Nine Barrows Down.

835
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,320
I know, but I shall be back
before long.

836
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,600
Let me go up to town today,
and take the house if it's possible.

837
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,520
Whose house is this?

838
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,480
Mr. Wilcox's.
Are you being obtuse on purpose?

839
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,760
Look. "Owing to changed circumstances..."

840
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,160
he means that Evie's getting married.
That's his daughter.

841
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,880
"I no longer have need
for a London house of this size...

842
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,440
and am willing to let it
on a yearly tenancy."

843
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,920
It's perfect.

844
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,800
Out of all our acquaintances,
Mr. Wilcox is the only one who stuck...

845
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,200
and yet we've met
far more interesting people.

846
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,800
Interesting people
don't get one houses.

847
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,080
I shall never forget that dreadful
motor drive with that dreadful Charles.

848
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,080
My one consolation is that I was able
to be useful to you girls.

849
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,960
Thank you, aunt Juley.

850
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,280
And now it is my turn to be useful.

851
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,400
This is the ballroom.

852
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,880
Goodness!

853
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,360
- Like it?
- Rather!

854
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,520
Even I know a good thing
when I see it.

855
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,600
Yes, but nowadays with
Evie always out with her fiance...

856
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,640
when I get home in the evenings,
I can't stand the place.

857
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,400
- It would be very lonely for you.
- Yes.

858
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,160
Do you ever get lonely?

859
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,120
I soon shall horribly.

860
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,360
It's heartbreaking to leave
one's old home.

861
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,280
Goodness! How high
this ceiling must be.

862
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:42,120
Yes, it must be over 30 feet.
No, maybe 40, I should think.

863
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,040
Perhaps even more.

864
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,800
I've had you up here
on false pretenses.

865
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,680
I want to speak on a much more
serious matter than the house.

866
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,760
Do you think you could
be induced to share...

867
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,120
I mean, is it at all probable...

868
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,520
Oh, yes, I see.

869
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,240
Miss Schlegel...

870
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,520
Margaret, I don't think
you quite understand.

871
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,440
Oh, yes, indeed yes.

872
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,840
- I'm asking you to be my wife.
- Yes, I know. I know.

873
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,720
- Are you offended?
- How could I be?

874
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,720
Perhaps I should have written first.

875
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,200
No! Rather you will receive
a letter from me.

876
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:42,040
- Thank you.
- Not at all. And it's you I thank.

877
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,840
Should I order the motor around now?

878
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,000
That would be most kind.

879
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,920
I am warning you, Evie,
she will never set foot in this house.

880
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,280
- It's not my fault!
- Of course it's your fault.

881
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,680
Going around hobnobbing
with those Schlegel girls.

882
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,600
They're hardly girls.

883
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,800
I never dreamt of such a thing.

884
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:37,680
Dad took me to call,
and made me ask her to Simpson's.

885
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,480
I'm altogether off dad.

886
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,560
You've woken diddums.
I knew you would.

887
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,920
Well, miss Schlegel's fairly
got us on toast.

888
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,200
She always meant to get hold
of Howards End.

889
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,080
Now, thanks to you,
she's got it.

890
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,400
I call that most unfair.

891
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,600
Evie, why don't you pretend
to break off your engagement?

892
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,560
Then perhaps your father
will also quarrel with miss Schlegel.

893
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,160
Stop talking nonsense.

894
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,640
I'll get married as soon as possible,
and dad can do what he likes.

895
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:11,760
Taking mother's place.
The idea!

896
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,320
I could scratch
that woman's eyes out.

897
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,040
Tootle, tootle.

898
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:21,160
Come on, Dolly, I'll have a try.

899
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,560
It's no use talking.

900
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,480
We're in a bad hole,
and must make the best of it.

901
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:30,200
But I'll keep my eye
on those Schlegels.

902
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,440
And if I find them putting on airs
with their artistic beastliness...

903
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,680
i intend to put my foot down.

904
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,200
Yes. Firmly.

905
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,040
I've had a letter, too. Not a nice one.
I want to talk it over with you.

906
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,760
My letter's about Howards End.
The tenants have decamped.

907
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:09,760
What is worse,
he's trying to sublet the house.

908
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,240
What are you laughing at?

909
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,240
You haven't had a chance to talk
with Helen yet, have you?

910
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,880
- A talk with her?
- Well, do before you go.

911
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,160
- What's the matter?
- I'm anxious you two should be friends.

912
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,360
We've always hit it off together.
We do.

913
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,960
There's no clause in the agreement
to allow subletting. Read it yourself.

914
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,920
- That's awfully jolly.
- Thank you.

915
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,760
Yes, especially that.

916
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,200
- Foxgloves.
- Yes, dear old digitalis.

917
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,800
Digitalis.
Sounds like a sneeze.

918
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,040
- Margaret, such nice news from Mr. Bast!
- Really?

919
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,200
Good. Here we all are, then.

920
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,640
Mr. Bast is now with Dempster's bank.
That's his news.

921
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,840
Thanks to your hint,
he cleared out of The Porphyrion.

922
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,280
Not a bad business, the porphyrion.

923
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,480
I shall have to go to Howards End
and take charge. I'd like you to come.

924
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,760
- Not a bad business?
- I would like that very much.

925
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,560
- Good. What about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow? I couldn't well do that.

926
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,840
You told us The Porphyrion
would smash before christmas.

927
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,800
Did i? Yes, it was outside
the tariff ring at the time.

928
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,720
Took some rather bad policies.

929
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,400
Lately it came in. Safe as houses now.
What's wrong with tomorrow?

930
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,640
Aunt Juley would be so disappointed
if I left now.

931
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:25,040
- Didn't Mr. Wilcox clearly tell us...
- Yes. Let's talk about it later.

932
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,000
Aunt Juley regards this...

933
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,040
now it turns out it's safe as houses,
and Mr. Bast should never have left...

934
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,960
at a greatly reduced salary.

935
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,520
My dear Helen, I grieve
for your clerk. I really do.

936
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,640
But it is part of the battle of life.

937
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,200
Battle of life? A man who had
little money has less, owing to us.

938
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,040
Come, come. You're not to blame.
No one is to blame.

939
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,320
- Is no one to blame for anything?
- I didn't say that.

940
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,480
You take things far too seriously.

941
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,400
There's your aunt.
I'll have a word with her.

942
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:59,160
- Helen, word of advice...
- I require no more advice!

943
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,120
Don't take up a sentimental attitude
over the poor.

944
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,040
See that she doesn't, Margaret.

945
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:08,360
The poor are poor.
One is sorry for them, but there it is.

946
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,920
I'll talk to aunt Juley about tomorrow.
Don't you bother.

947
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,400
Girls, aren't you cold?

948
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:19,200
I am very sorry about Mr. Bast,
but you must be civil to Henry.

949
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,320
- You, yourself, are a witness.
- There may be another side to this question.

950
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,520
Henry is my future husband...

951
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,840
and I must be on his side.

952
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,920
Why are you so bitter?

953
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,040
Because I'm an old maid.

954
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,960
Oh, Helen!

955
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,640
Oh, darling!

956
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,200
Margaret will explain.

957
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:55,800
It isn't true what Mr. Wilcox says,
that you want to go away tomorrow?

958
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,720
We must leave tomorrow.

959
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,800
I have business at Howards End...

960
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,000
and my business is now, fortunately,
my Margaret's.

961
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,880
- That's it.
- So this is the famous office.

962
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,920
I had expected something
more African.

963
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,440
Heavens no!

964
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,760
Spears, animal skins,
and that sort of thing.

965
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,320
I expect this is the imperial part of
the Imperial and West African Company.

966
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,000
We haven't settled the question
of the London house.

967
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,080
- That all depends.
- On what?

968
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,920
- When do you want to marry me?
- My head's in a whirl!

969
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,360
I hope that my wife...
Oh. How do you do?

970
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,760
Will give you a decent lunch
after you've looked at Howards End.

971
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,680
I can hardly wait to see it,
although I almost feel I have.

972
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,880
I don't know in what state
you'll find it.

973
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,640
The tenant decamped without arranging
for a charwoman to clear up after him.

974
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:12,240
Yes. I've more than a little bone
to pick with the tenant.

975
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,760
Margaret, here's an idea.

976
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,240
Why don't we use Howards End to store
your furniture from Wickham Place...

977
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,240
until you decide
what to do with it?

978
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,600
- Would you really?
- Good idea?

979
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,520
How kind.

980
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,000
Only until Helen and Tibby
are settled, of course, Charles.

981
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,960
I hope you won't be disappointed.

982
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,480
It's quite a measly little place.
It never really suited us.

983
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,080
Heavens no.

984
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,720
Good. It's lovely!

985
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,520
- Oh dear.
- What?

986
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,400
I seem to have forgotten the keys.
I've lost the keys.

987
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,960
- We'll have to go back.
- Won't you leave me here?

988
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,920
- Sure?
- I'll wait for you.

989
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,760
Have a glass of milk at the farmer's.
Henry, see she gets some milk.

990
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,000
Good-bye.

991
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,280
- Why did you forget the key?
- Sorry.

992
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,760
- Where did you leave it?
- It could be with diddums.

993
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,400
Hello.

994
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,040
I took you for Ruth Wilcox!

995
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,600
I, like mrs. Wilcox?

996
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,480
You have her way of walking...

997
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,480
'round the house.

998
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,560
Henry, I found the teeth!
The pig's teeth.

999
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,920
- Where?
- The pig's teeth in the bark.

1000
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,360
Look. Here. You see?

1001
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,840
- Four feet up.
- How extraordinary.

1002
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,840
Yes, and you chew the bark
to kill the toothache.

1003
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,320
- What a rum notion.
- Surely you knew that.

1004
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,440
Did silly miss Avery
give you a fright?

1005
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,920
None of you girls
has any nerve.

1006
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,080
Did you take her for a spook?
She's very odd.

1007
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,520
She carries on as if she owned
Howards End.

1008
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,440
Miss Avery has always lived there?

1009
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,400
Yes, she grew up on the farm
like mrs. Wilcox.

1010
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,920
Weren't she and mrs. Wilcox friends
when Howards End, too, was a farm?

1011
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,560
They say that mrs. Wilcox had a brother.
Or was it an uncle?

1012
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,200
Anyhow, he popped the question,
and miss Avery said "no."

1013
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:52,080
If she'd said "Yes",
she'd have been Charles' aunt.

1014
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:55,000
That's rather good!
Charlie's aunt!

1015
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,000
I must chaff him about that.

1016
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,880
She's mad about Howards End.

1017
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,440
Goodness knows what she'll do
when your furniture arrives.

1018
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,680
She might fling it all out!

1019
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,400
Or she might simply adopt it
for Howards End.

1020
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,240
Excuse me, sir. Where would I go
to inquire about a position?

1021
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,320
What position would that be, sir?

1022
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,080
- I heard there was one.
- Not at this time.

1023
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,400
I thought it was you.
How do you do?

1024
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,640
Why did you never come
to see us again? You promised.

1025
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,200
This isn't your bank.
You took a situation with Dempster's.

1026
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,640
- Lost it.
- Sorry?

1027
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:40,280
I lost the situation.
They cut back on their staff.

1028
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,720
The last to join, like me,
were the first to be let go.

1029
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,680
I've been inquiring
for another place here.

1030
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,920
The way they look at you
when you come to ask.

1031
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,680
They're sure you've stolen something.
A decent person wouldn't be out of work.

1032
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,480
It's our fault.

1033
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,600
We made you leave The Porphyrion.
I and my sister and Mr. Wilcox.

1034
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,600
Who is at this very moment celebrating
his daughter's wedding at his castle in Shropshire.

1035
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:05,080
With the maximum of expense
and ostentation. I could murder him!

1036
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,600
"Murder without is most foul."

1037
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,080
How have you been?
Any interesting lectures?

1038
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,840
He jolly well owes you a situation.

1039
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,040
What nice houses you have all over the place.

1040
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,720
- I like this one, too.
- Oniton Grange.

1041
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,560
- I'm waiting to get it off my hands.
- Why?

1042
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,800
What is one to do? The shooting is bad,
and the fishing is even worse.

1043
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,240
Anyway, it's in the wrong part
of Shropshire.

1044
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,680
Are these all Wilcoxes?

1045
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:38,360
Heavens no! I bought the place
lock, stock and barrel.

1046
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,680
The fellow just took the money,
and cleared off. To Italy, I think.

1047
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,040
Some of these are rather good.
What do you think?

1048
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,000
- They're lovely.
- Rather good, isn't it?

1049
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,640
- Which?
- Top one.

1050
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:50,680
Yes, it's very grand.
Rather like you.

1051
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,360
So, I'll show you the cellar.

1052
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,560
It's very damp.

1053
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,240
- Do you have enough ice?
- Yes, sir.

1054
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,560
Second orders? Good.

1055
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,600
All right, this way.

1056
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,680
It is difficult to decide
what to do about the children.

1057
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,960
Charles, as the eldest,
will have Howards End.

1058
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,240
I'm anxious not to be unjust
to the others.

1059
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,600
- Of course not. You mean money?
- Yes money, since you put it so frankly.

1060
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,840
Goodness! We'll never get through
all this wine.

1061
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,240
- How much have you got?
- What?

1062
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,400
How much have you got per year?
I have 600.

1063
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,240
My income?

1064
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,560
- Don't you know your income?
- Of course I do.

1065
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,680
Or don't you want to tell me?

1066
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,600
Do it this way. If you were to divide
your income into ten parts...

1067
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:49,080
how many parts would you give
to Charles, to Evie and to Paul?

1068
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,000
Go ahead, give away all you can.
Be generous.

1069
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,760
Divide yours, too.

1070
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,760
She'll get her hands on this place
as well as Howards End.

1071
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,680
It's only her furniture
that's gone there.

1072
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,040
That's the thin edge of the wedge.

1073
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,760
What's to happen to us?
Two children to bring up.

1074
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,360
Charles, you're pleased
about the baby, aren't you?

1075
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:31,480
What? Oh!
Pleased as punch!

1076
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:40,160
But it's not going to be easy.

1077
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:44,960
The pater wants to be fair,
but money isn't elastic.

1078
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,440
What if Evie has a family?

1079
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,560
Or the pater himself?

1080
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,000
What?

1081
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,560
Who's there?

1082
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,800
Saxon or celt?

1083
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,120
It went like clockwork.

1084
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,120
"Quite like a durbar",
lady Edser said.

1085
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,280
You did awfully well.

1086
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,320
I'm very proud of you.
Thank you.

1087
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,600
It was very successful.

1088
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,280
Who are those people?

1089
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,200
Perhaps townspeople
come to see the wedding presents.

1090
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,400
If you'll gracefully vanish,
I'll deal with them.

1091
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,560
What is it? What's wrong?
Is Tibby ill?

1092
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,400
I found them starving!

1093
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,440
- Who?
- The Basts!

1094
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,560
He lost his place.

1095
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,640
They reduced their staff,
and he was the first to go!

1096
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:10,360
- Yes, thanks to us. We've ruined him!
- Are you mad?

1097
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,800
If you like,
but I'll stand for this no longer.

1098
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,960
Two people starving,
and all this vulgar show!

1099
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,680
Have you actually brought two starving
people from London to Shropshire?

1100
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,240
There was a restaurant car
on the train.

1101
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:30,320
Don't be absurd! I won't have
such theatrical nonsense!

1102
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,040
Yes, how dare you?
Bursting into Evie's wedding.

1103
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,240
My goodness! You've a perverted notion
of philanthropy. Look at them.

1104
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,160
They think it's some vulgar scandal...

1105
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:42,440
and I must explain,
"No, it's only my sister screaming...

1106
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,680
and only two hangers-on of ours
she has brought here for no reason."

1107
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,600
We want to see Mr. Wilcox.

1108
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:54,160
Mr. Bast, this is an odd business.
What view do you take of it?

1109
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,640
- There is mrs. Bast, too.
- Yes. How do you do?

1110
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:02,200
- She's unwell. She fainted on the train.
- I'm so sorry. Won't you sit down?

1111
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:06,080
We don't wish to intrude, but you and
your sister have been kind in the past.

1112
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:09,360
My sister has put you
in a false position.

1113
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,560
Helen, offer them something. Mrs. Bast,
won't you have something to eat?

1114
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,160
Please.

1115
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,600
I would like to do something
for them.

1116
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,520
- We are, in some way, responsible.
- Via Mr. Wilcox.

1117
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:31,520
If you take up that attitude,
I'll do nothing. So choose.

1118
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,360
If you promise to take them
to the hotel, quietly, as my guests...

1119
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,200
then I will speak to Henry
about finding work for Mr. Bast.

1120
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:45,920
There is to be no more
of this absurd screaming.

1121
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,360
Well?

1122
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,720
All right. I promise.

1123
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,960
Very well. Take them to The George,
and I'll try.

1124
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,760
But, Helen...

1125
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,400
you have been most self-indulgent.

1126
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,960
You have less restraint rather than more
as you get older.

1127
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,040
Think it over...

1128
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,000
and alter yourself.

1129
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,160
Or we shant have happy lives.

1130
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,920
Let's eat some cake, shall we?

1131
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,760
You want some strawberries?

1132
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,520
Sorry. Excuse me.

1133
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,840
I must see to getting some rooms.

1134
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,640
We don't want to be any trouble.
We shall come with you.

1135
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,520
- Perhaps you'd like to stay?
- There's all this pudding.

1136
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,000
- Mrs. Bast is extremely tired.
- I'm hungry!

1137
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,080
Perhaps you should come back for her?

1138
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:56,040
- Will you be all right?
- I'll be all right!

1139
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,960
Charles, look.

1140
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,680
Whoever's that? Pink scarf.

1141
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,000
Charles Wilcox.
How do you do?

1142
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,400
Bride or groom?

1143
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,160
Pleased to have made your acquaintance.

1144
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,080
Champagne, madam?

1145
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:07,720
Helen? Here?

1146
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:12,080
But she refused the invitation.
I thought she despised weddings.

1147
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:16,280
- Where is she now?
- Gone. I've bundled her to The George.

1148
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,840
George hotel?
You shouldn't have done that.

1149
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:24,440
She has two of her proteges with her.

1150
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,480
Yes, her protege.
Well, let them all come.

1151
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,080
No, but...

1152
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,440
Later on I would like
to talk to you about them.

1153
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,760
Why not now?
No time like the present.

1154
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,200
Shall I?

1155
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,440
Yes, if it isn't too long a story.

1156
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,120
It's not five minutes.

1157
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,600
But there's a sting at the end of it.

1158
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:56,240
For I want you to find the man
some work in your office.

1159
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,520
What are his qualifications?

1160
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,920
He's a clerk, I think.

1161
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,920
- Where was he before?
- Dempster's bank.

1162
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,520
Dempster's.
Why did he leave?

1163
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,440
They reduced their staff.

1164
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,560
Yes.

1165
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,880
I'll see what I can do.

1166
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,240
Margaret, this cannot be taken
as a precedent.

1167
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:30,160
I can't fit in your proteges
or Helen's every day. You do understand?

1168
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,000
Of course. Of course not.

1169
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:37,000
But he's rather a special case.

1170
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:40,000
Proteges always are, aren't they?

1171
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,400
Why, if it isn't Henry!

1172
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,440
Hello, Henry.

1173
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,400
Fancy seeing you here.

1174
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:16,680
This is mrs. Bast.
I'm sorry, she's a little overtired.

1175
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:20,000
- She's drunk.
- Don't you remember Jacky?

1176
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,720
Henry, aren't you going
to say "Hello"?

1177
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,040
- Do you know mrs. Bast?
- No, I don't!

1178
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:29,160
Know Henry?

1179
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:32,520
Who doesn't know Henry?
We've had some gay old times...

1180
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,520
You're drunk!

1181
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,360
Are you satisfied? I can now understand
your keen interest in the Basts.

1182
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,200
I congratulate you
on your little plan to trap me.

1183
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,240
I release you from your engagement.
Thank you.

1184
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,000
- Here we are.
- Please don't bother, my dear.

1185
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,280
I'm sure I can manage.

1186
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:05,720
That's all right. I'll do that.
I'll do it.

1187
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,640
- So that's it.
- That is what?

1188
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:12,280
Thank you, dear chap.
You were saying?

1189
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:16,680
Henry and I were having the fiercest
argument, but I think he's forgiven me.

1190
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:19,880
I don't expect there's much
to forgive.

1191
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,240
I really must be going,
or we should be late.

1192
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,440
Thank you so much
for the loveliest time.

1193
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,160
And hasn't the weather
been kind to us?

1194
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,120
A lovely day.
Thank you very much.

1195
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,040
Have a safe journey.

1196
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,680
Bye-bye, Dolly.
You take care of yourself.

1197
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,040
I shall.

1198
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,360
- Oh, I've forgotten my hat.
- It's here, father.

1199
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,720
Thank you.

1200
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,040
Are the women folk all right?

1201
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,040
Shut the doors and we're ready.

1202
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,760
Well, thank you...

1203
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,080
Oh, oh. Drive on.

1204
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,760
What's the matter, Jacky?

1205
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,360
It was a jolt seeing him.

1206
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,160
Him? Seeing who?

1207
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,680
I don't want to talk about it.

1208
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,840
What do you think you're looking at?

1209
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,560
Henry, look at me.

1210
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:14,000
So, you were that woman's lover?

1211
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,280
Put with your usual delicacy.
Yes, I was.

1212
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,520
When? When, please?

1213
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,440
Ten years ago!

1214
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,440
I'm sorry. Ten years ago.

1215
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,000
Henry dear,
it's not going to trouble us.

1216
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:46,400
Yes, we fellows all fall from grace
once in our time.

1217
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,120
- You believe that, Margaret?
- Yes, I do believe it.

1218
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:52,000
You with your refined pursuits
and your books...

1219
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:57,280
what can you guess of any man's life,
his temptations?

1220
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,760
Temptations.

1221
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:03,160
Well, that's enough.
I've spoken too much already.

1222
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,160
Yes, that's enough, dear.

1223
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:09,720
It was in Cyprus.
I was very lonely.

1224
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,840
- You can never forgive me, can you?
- I have forgiven you.

1225
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:21,760
I could find an excuse,
but I won't.

1226
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,240
Let us speak no more about it, dear.
It is all behind us.

1227
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,680
Really?

1228
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,120
You can really bring yourself
to forgive me?

1229
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,080
You've learned
that I'm far from a saint.

1230
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:46,520
In fact, the reverse.
No, no, no. The reverse.

1231
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,400
- Where are those people now?
- Helen took them to The George.

1232
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,440
Oh. Then let them leave
first thing in the morning.

1233
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,280
There must be no gossip
at The George.

1234
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,320
And anyway,
Helen should be here with us...

1235
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,800
not stopping at a hotel
with some ragtags.

1236
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,640
Why don't you kindly write a note
to that effect?

1237
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:13,760
I'll have Burton send it over
to Helen straightaway.

1238
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,760
Yes, sir?

1239
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:25,960
I want you to take a note
to The George hotel straightaway.

1240
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,880
There's far too much noise
out there.

1241
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,760
"I'm sorry to tell you that Henry
can do nothing for Mr. Bast.

1242
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:42,840
He feels the Basts are not at all
the type we should trouble about.

1243
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,520
We found the woman drunk
on the lawn.

1244
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,240
Please see that they leave
first thing in the morning...

1245
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,440
and come here yourself."

1246
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,000
He made her write it.
This isn't Margaret.

1247
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,360
Would you put it in the fire?

1248
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,440
You better let us be.
You don't want to get mixed up in this.

1249
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,760
In what?

1250
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,400
What is it?

1251
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,960
You must trust me that far
at least!

1252
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,080
Mr. Wilcox met Jacky before.

1253
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:29,560
Out in Cyprus when she was 16.

1254
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,400
I told you you didn't want
to hear about it.

1255
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,800
Go on.
Why was she in Cyprus?

1256
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,720
Her father was a clerk
in an export business.

1257
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,360
After her mother died,
she'd gone out to be with him.

1258
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,600
Then he died.

1259
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,480
Accidentally drowned
because he couldn't swim.

1260
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,000
Jacky was left having to fend
for herself...

1261
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,480
till she managed to get back home.

1262
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:30,280
I didn't have to marry her,
but I did.

1263
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,320
My family tried to stop me.

1264
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:36,640
But I married her all the same,
because I promised.

1265
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:41,480
If I hadn't, where would she be after
the Mr. Wilcoxes had finished with her?

1266
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:44,280
It would never,
not in a thousand years...

1267
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:47,520
enter that man's mind
he'd done anything wrong.

1268
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,040
Because there's nothing here,
and nothing here!

1269
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:55,280
And you're the opposite. You believe
in personal responsibility...

1270
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,200
and personal everything.

1271
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:01,200
Very nice. What good am I
to myself or to Jacky?

1272
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,280
Marrying her, only to pull her down
with me so we can starve together.

1273
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,720
Surely you'll find
another position somewhere.

1274
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,760
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1275
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:12,480
If rich people fail at one position,
they can try another.

1276
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,200
But with us...

1277
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:18,160
once a man over 20 loses
his own particular job, he's done for.

1278
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,520
I'd do anything in the world
to help you.

1279
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,000
Help me row, then.
I'm tired.

1280
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,760
You're the one person
who ever has helped me.

1281
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:56,240
You mean by passing on false information
to make you give up your job?

1282
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,040
I mean by being
the sort of person you are.

1283
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,000
I didn't think people like you existed
except in books.

1284
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:07,080
- And books aren't real.
- They're more real than anything!

1285
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:11,200
When people fail you,
there's still "Music and meaning".

1286
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:16,200
That's for rich people to make them
feel good after their dinner.

1287
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,560
Everything's got spoiled for you,
hasn't it?

1288
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,640
L don't know what's to be done, Tibby,
or what to say to Meg.

1289
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,120
I don't want to face her
or even go back to Wickham Place.

1290
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,480
You mean, because of Mr. Wilcox...

1291
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:13,600
and the woman you say
he seduced in Cyprus?

1292
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,320
I want you to give Meg my love,
and tell her...

1293
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:23,000
tell her I'm going away to Germany,
to Munich.

1294
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,920
- Or else Bonn.
- Such a message is easily given.

1295
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,440
God, I wish I could escape
from Meg's wedding, too.

1296
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:34,760
Is she really going through with it?
How can our Meg be a Wilcox?

1297
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,920
And now, after all this?

1298
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,880
You better go to Germany.

1299
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:43,040
It's Martlett with the apple charlotte.
Mind if I take it? It spoils.

1300
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:51,280
- Shall I clear now, sir?
- Not now. Later.

1301
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,880
Very good.

1302
01:39:56,160 --> 01:40:00,000
I feel... no, I know,
we owe the Basts some compensation.

1303
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,880
- Those people again?
- Yes, those people again.

1304
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,880
I don't see who is to pay
if I don't.

1305
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,160
I'm placing what I consider
is a minimum amount to your account.

1306
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:12,200
When I'm in Germany,
you'll pay it to the Basts for me.

1307
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:14,680
I shall never forget your kindness
if you do this.

1308
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,320
What's the sum?

1309
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,640
- Five thousand.
- Good god!

1310
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:23,160
It's useless giving out driblets
of charity, just shillings and blankets.

1311
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:25,480
No doubt people will think me mad.

1312
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,920
I don't give a damn what people think!

1313
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,320
But I do mind if you ruin yourself
for some quixotic reason of your own.

1314
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,600
I didn't expect you to understand me.

1315
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:38,040
- I understand nobody.
- But you'll do it?

1316
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,480
Apparently.

1317
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:55,080
Are you writing to your brother?
He could send us another ten.

1318
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:57,040
Yes, and a long lecture with it.

1319
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:00,400
- Your sister could afford a fiver.
- Leave me alone!

1320
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,920
Why are you taking it out on me?

1321
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,960
You can see I'm busy, can't you?

1322
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,720
"Dear Mr. Schlegel...

1323
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:32,720
I acknowledge receipt of your letter
enclosing a check for 5,000 pounds.

1324
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,080
I am very grateful for your concern,
but having no immediate necessity...

1325
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,880
i have the honor to return
your check herewith.

1326
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:42,680
Yours sincerely, Leonard Bast."

1327
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,400
Excuse me, sir.

1328
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:52,240
Sorry to bother you.
I worked in this office for four years.

1329
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,480
I was wondering
if there were any vacancies.

1330
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,040
No, I'm sorry.
I've nothing.

1331
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,120
- Nothing at all?
- Nothing at this time.

1332
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:52,000
The servants will have benefit of the
central heating if we keep them here...

1333
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:55,440
instead of at the back of the house,
which the architect prefers.

1334
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,880
If only it would hurry up
and get itself built.

1335
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,880
All in good time.

1336
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:04,360
I'm getting tired of living in London.
I can't be as young as I was.

1337
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:09,040
I'm perfectly happy to do without
the new plays and discussion societies.

1338
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:12,200
Mr. Shaw, Mr. Wells
and all the other utopias.

1339
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:16,800
What I miss are trees
and mountains and meadows.

1340
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,680
I also miss my own things.

1341
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,600
They're safe now at Howards End.

1342
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,960
I'm grateful to have them there.

1343
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,960
But I would like to see them
in our own home.

1344
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,760
My share at least. Goodness only knows
what Tibby intends to do with his.

1345
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,920
Or Helen.

1346
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:39,040
There's been another postcard
from her.

1347
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:42,160
Still the same poste restante address
in Bavaria...

1348
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:44,160
but now she speaks
of going to Italy.

1349
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:46,440
She's never coming back to England.

1350
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,480
She's been away now...

1351
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:52,960
- how long has it been?
- Four months, three weeks on Tuesday.

1352
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:59,160
Your sister is odd. She always has been.
No getting away from it.

1353
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:03,800
What's this?

1354
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,760
What've you been reading now?

1355
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,800
Theo...

1356
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,640
- Theosophy.
- Yes.

1357
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,840
Madam Blavatsky.

1358
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:16,000
What a clever little woman it is.

1359
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:18,120
That's what I mean about Helen.

1360
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,760
She reads these things,
and her mind gets addled.

1361
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:24,480
My Margaret keeps her facts straight.

1362
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:28,320
- What facts are those, dear?
- About men and women.

1363
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:32,200
All that sort of thing.
Who is who and what is what.

1364
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,120
Yes. What is that?

1365
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:37,240
Mr. Schlegel, sir,
you've forgotten this.

1366
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:39,240
Thank you.

1367
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:55,360
Oh, dear, Annie.
Look, it's another one.

1368
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,800
But no letter.

1369
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,240
I just can't feel
that Helen's really alive.

1370
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,280
These postcards and telegrams
don't seem to have come from her.

1371
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,000
That's not her!

1372
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:22,520
I know what you mean. You'll break that
if you keep fiddling with it.

1373
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,520
Put it on.

1374
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:31,360
"M.J. Schlegel, The Rise,
Straight Fleming, Devon.

1375
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:34,360
Dearest Meg,
arriving London thursday.

1376
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,280
Please telegraph care my bank...

1377
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:39,880
whether aunt Juley is better
or likely to become worse.

1378
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:44,280
Give my love to the invalid,
and keep some for yourselves. Helen."

1379
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:47,800
If only you had a companion
to take your walks with.

1380
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,800
I have Tibby, dear aunt Juley.

1381
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:56,880
And it won't be long... thank you.
Before you'll be up and about.

1382
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:59,840
When is Helen coming?

1383
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:03,320
Very soon. She will already
have reached London.

1384
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,000
She's got to London.

1385
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,400
But?

1386
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:18,000
She says to telegraph
if aunt Juley is better.

1387
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:21,600
Obviously if we want to see her,
we must telegraph that she is not.

1388
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:24,840
We can't start lying to each other.
Helen wouldn't...

1389
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,480
she couldn't stay away
at such a time.

1390
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,920
"Dearest Helen...

1391
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,640
aunt Juley better and eagerly
expecting you as am I.

1392
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,440
Your Meg."

1393
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,480
"Must return Germany at once.

1394
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:45,240
Telegraph to bank whereabouts
are books and furniture. Helen."

1395
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,000
Why did she have to go back
to Germany?

1396
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:50,520
I'll explain it all after your nap.

1397
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:53,560
She might have come to see her aunt.
I haven't been well.

1398
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,920
Is cook doing the mackerel
the way Tibby likes them?

1399
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:00,640
I know his whole day is spoiled
if his breakfast isn't right.

1400
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:04,760
The mackerel were perfect.
Tibby mentioned them this morning.

1401
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,200
Don't tell me
it is still that business...

1402
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,720
over Henry and that woman mrs. Bast.

1403
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,880
Goodness me! How morbid!

1404
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,880
His wife forgives him, and his
sister-in-law can't bear to look at him.

1405
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:21,640
I don't believe it,
not even of Helen.

1406
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:26,040
We all know to what extremes Helen goes.
We've suffered under her temperament.

1407
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:29,080
This is different,
this is not temperament...

1408
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:31,520
but a kind of madness...

1409
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:34,000
as if she were mad.

1410
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,840
Margaret, you've got black marks again
under your eyes.

1411
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:57,160
You know that's strictly forbidden.

1412
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,480
Can't have my girl looking
as old as her husband.

1413
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,400
You haven't quite seen our point.

1414
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:04,480
- I don't suppose I ever shall.
- Our point is this.

1415
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,440
Our sister may be mad.

1416
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,560
Charles, do come in.

1417
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,760
We are again in trouble.
Can you help us at all?

1418
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:17,080
No, I'm afraid I cannot.
What were the facts?

1419
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:19,480
We're all mad,
more or less, these days.

1420
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:23,520
The facts are that our sister
has been in England and won't see us.

1421
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:26,200
She's forbidden the bankers
to give us her address.

1422
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:30,360
She refuses to answer any questions.
Ail we have are these telegrams.

1423
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,240
And you want to get hold of her?

1424
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,680
Well... yes.

1425
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,240
Perfectly easy, Margaret.

1426
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:41,720
She wants her books, yes?
Send her after them to Howards End.

1427
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,160
When she's there,
you just stroll in.

1428
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:46,160
If there's nothing wrong with her,
so much the better.

1429
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:48,840
But remember the motor
will be around the corner.

1430
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:51,800
We can run her to a specialist
in no time.

1431
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:55,560
- But that's impossible!
- Why is it impossible?

1432
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:59,240
Because Helen and I, we...

1433
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:02,280
don't speak
that particular language...

1434
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,600
if you see my meaning.

1435
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:08,600
Yes, because you have scruples.
It's all very well and I understand.

1436
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,360
I am as scrupulous as any man alive,
I hope.

1437
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:14,880
But when it is a case like this,
when it is a question of madness...

1438
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:16,800
I deny it's madness!

1439
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:19,960
- You said so yourself.
- It's madness when I say it, not you.

1440
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,880
Pater, we may as well
keep Howards End out of it.

1441
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,200
Why?

1442
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,200
The whole house is at sixes and sevens.
We don't want any more mess.

1443
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,160
And who is we?

1444
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:39,160
Pray, Charles, who is we?

1445
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,240
I beg your pardon I'm sure.

1446
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,480
I seem always to be intruding.

1447
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,120
Let's send the telegram.

1448
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,440
Come along. Let's do it.

1449
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,000
I really can't have this sort of behavior.

1450
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,400
- What?
- Margaret.

1451
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,800
She's far too sweet natured to mind.
But I mind for her.

1452
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,400
"All your books now at Howards End.

1453
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:23,200
Miss Avery will let you in
3:00 p.m. Monday. Meg."

1454
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:28,760
Our main object is not to frighten
miss Schlegel. You understand?

1455
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:32,280
The trouble seems to be nervous.
Wouldn't you say so, Margaret?

1456
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,680
Would you say she was normal?

1457
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:36,960
She's always been highly strung.

1458
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,240
Musical, literary, artistic.

1459
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:42,080
But quite normal.
Quite a charming girl really.

1460
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:46,240
Would you say
there was anything congenital?

1461
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,600
Anything hereditary?

1462
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,880
- Margaret?
- Henry, just wait here for a second.

1463
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:15,560
Oh, darling! Quickly!
Just get inside, please!

1464
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:19,040
Miss Schlegel is managing.

1465
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:21,840
You can go back to the motor.
Margaret?

1466
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:26,080
I shall surely need your advice later,
but now I must be alone with Helen.

1467
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:29,600
- You're certain?
- Yes. Please, my dear, kind Henry.

1468
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,400
Thank you.

1469
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:52,880
- Why all our furniture?
- There's been a mistake.

1470
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:56,960
How well the carpet fits.

1471
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:00,440
I'll be sending some milk 'round,
and we should be ordering coals.

1472
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,640
There's been a mistake.
You've been very kind.

1473
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:05,520
But we are not going to live
at Howards End. This is not our house.

1474
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:14,040
I think she may be a little touched.

1475
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,920
I'm sorry, Helen.
I ought not to have...

1476
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,600
no, you ought not
to have tricked me this way.

1477
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,360
We thought you were ill!

1478
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:26,000
As you see, I'm not ill,
but I'm expecting a child in June.

1479
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,720
Is the coast clear?
I must leave.

1480
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:31,920
I'm going back to Germany
in the morning.

1481
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,880
My love to aunt Juley and Tibby.

1482
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:36,160
Let me carry that.

1483
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:38,960
It's curious, isn't it,
that our carpet fits?

1484
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,320
Yes, the sword looks right, too.

1485
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,560
Yes, doesn't it?

1486
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:52,000
Someone's polished it.

1487
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,440
Yes.

1488
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:57,400
I'll carry this.

1489
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:04,000
If you didn't want to tell me
because of Henry, I'd understand that.

1490
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:07,960
I thought I had to be by myself.
That's why I hid away in Germany.

1491
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,920
What about Tibby?

1492
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:14,400
Really, I alone must be responsible
for myself and this child.

1493
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,680
And I want to be.

1494
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:18,720
Of course Leonard doesn't know.

1495
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,160
Leonard?

1496
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,360
Leonard Bast?

1497
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:25,040
Yes.

1498
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,720
Did you ever hear from him again?

1499
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,440
I have no idea
what he's doing now...

1500
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:39,280
or what's happened
to either of them.

1501
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,240
My dear, I must ask you.

1502
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:54,520
Was your sister wearing
a wedding ring?

1503
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,720
- No.
- What?

1504
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:01,880
I really came just to ask a favor
about Howards End.

1505
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:04,680
Yes. One point at a time.
Please, sit down.

1506
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:13,600
I must now ask you
the name of her seducer.

1507
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:16,480
You may have some inkling,
and the slightest hint would help us.

1508
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,080
Who is us?

1509
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:22,200
I thought it best to ring Charles.

1510
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:24,240
That was unnecessary.

1511
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,560
My dear...

1512
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:30,000
Charles and I wish to act
in your sister's best interests.

1513
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,760
It is still not too late
to clear her name.

1514
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,320
Are we to make her seducer
marry her?

1515
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:41,040
Suppose he turned out to be married?
One has heard of such cases.

1516
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:49,240
Then he must pay heavily
for his misconduct, mustn't he?

1517
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:52,320
Stay calm.

1518
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,000
I want to talk to you.

1519
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:59,640
Listen to me.

1520
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,960
Come here.

1521
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,640
Look at me.

1522
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,600
What's the matter?

1523
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,880
- May I ask you my question now?
- Certainly.

1524
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,040
Tomorrow Helen goes to Germany.
I'm fine.

1525
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:22,200
Tonight, with your permission,
she would like to sleep at Howards End.

1526
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,800
Why at Howards End?

1527
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:30,200
It is an odd request, but you know
what women in her state are.

1528
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:33,080
I could understand
if it were her own home.

1529
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:36,880
Associations and so on, but Helen has
no associations with Howards End.

1530
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:39,640
I don't see why she wants to stay there.
She'll only catch cold.

1531
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:43,360
- Call it fancy, but she wants to.
- I don't understand.

1532
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:47,280
She'll then want to sleep two nights,
and never get out of the house.

1533
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:50,160
- Would that matter?
- Of course.

1534
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:53,920
We will only trouble Howards End
for this one night. I'll stay with her.

1535
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:56,640
That's quite impossible.
I want you here to meet Charles.

1536
01:55:56,720 --> 01:56:00,000
- What has Charles to do with this?
- He's the future owner of Howards End.

1537
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,400
- It has everything to do with Charles.
- In what way?

1538
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:04,080
Please answer me.

1539
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:06,160
You're forgetting yourself.
There's Dolly and the servants.

1540
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:09,160
Would Helen's condition
depreciate the property?

1541
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:25,040
I shall do what I can, but I can't treat
your sister as if nothing has happened.

1542
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:27,400
I shall be false to my position
in society if I did.

1543
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:31,600
Tomorrow she will go to Germany,
and trouble society no longer.

1544
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:37,120
Tonight she asks to sleep
in your empty house.

1545
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:40,360
May she?
Will you give my sister leave?

1546
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:42,920
Will you forgive her...

1547
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:47,960
as you, yourself,
have been forgiven?

1548
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,720
- As I have been...
- please answer my question!

1549
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:54,560
Your sister can sleep at the hotel.

1550
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:58,600
I have my children and the memory
of my dear wife to consider.

1551
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:00,520
You have mentioned mrs. Wilcox.

1552
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:05,560
In reply, may I mention mrs. Bast?

1553
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:11,400
- You have not been yourself all day.
- You had a mistress, I forgave you.

1554
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:15,040
My sister has a lover,
you drive her from the house!

1555
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:17,640
Why can you not be honest for once
and say to yourself...

1556
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:20,160
"What Helen has done, I have done"?

1557
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:27,720
I repeat what I said before.

1558
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:30,800
I do not give your sister leave
to sleep at Howards End.

1559
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,240
Do you understand?

1560
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:47,840
If a man played about with my sister,
I'd send a bullet through him.

1561
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:51,160
But I suppose
you're sunk too deep in books...

1562
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:54,520
and rubbish
to mind what happens to your sister.

1563
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:57,840
I mind very much
what happens to my sister.

1564
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:01,760
But I have a different way
of expressing it from yours...

1565
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,680
not to speak of different manners.

1566
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:05,920
By jove, I'm glad of my way!

1567
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:10,760
I'm glad my father never sent me to
university if this is what they teach.

1568
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:16,640
Look, you must know something
of your sister's life.

1569
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,400
- Do you know of anyone?
- No.

1570
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,360
Whom do you suspect?

1571
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,840
Did she mention anyone by name?

1572
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,520
Come on, yes or no?
You're hiding something. Speak up.

1573
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:33,000
She did mention some friend
called Leonard Bast.

1574
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,440
Leonard Bast?

1575
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:40,600
Do you know him?

1576
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:43,200
Have you had any dealings with him?

1577
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:48,640
What a family. What a family!
God help the poor pater.

1578
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:50,960
God help my poor sisters.

1579
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:01,280
- They were ordered on approval!
- Excuse me. Excuse me!

1580
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,720
Wait.

1581
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:08,000
Excuse me.
I was looking for miss Schlegel.

1582
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:10,600
Leonard Bast. I used to call
at Wickham Place. Is miss Schlegel in?

1583
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:13,600
- Or mrs. Wilcox?
- They're down at Howards End.

1584
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:16,280
Where would that be, Howards End?

1585
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:19,000
It's at Hilton.
Near Hilton Junction.

1586
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:22,600
Are you all right?

1587
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:26,000
- Let me get you a drink of water.
- No, thank you.

1588
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:32,400
- Please take them, ma'am.
- Come on, off you go!

1589
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:39,440
I don't want you to conclude...

1590
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:43,400
that my wife and I have had
anything like a quarrel.

1591
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,880
She is overwrought, naturally.

1592
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:47,360
Naturally.

1593
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:51,040
The question to my mind is connected
to something far greater:

1594
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:52,960
The rights of property itself.

1595
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,240
Absolutely.

1596
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:57,520
The house is mine,
and will one day be yours, Charles.

1597
01:59:57,600 --> 02:00:00,760
When I say I don't want anyone
living at Howards End...

1598
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:03,520
I mean that no one
is to live at Howards End.

1599
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:06,200
Then tomorrow morning
I may go up in the motor?

1600
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:11,400
Yes. Say that you're acting
as my representative...

1601
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:14,280
and that they must clear out at once.

1602
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:16,760
Go to bed now.
I've kept you up far too late.

1603
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:21,720
Can I do anything for you, sir?

1604
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,640
No, nothing.

1605
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:27,920
Thank you, my boy.
Good night.

1606
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,880
Good night, sir.

1607
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:45,320
It's only the train.

1608
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:34,280
Len, have you got
that pain again?

1609
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:40,000
- You're all dressed.
- I'm going out for a bit.

1610
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:45,200
What ho, Len.

1611
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:48,160
What ho, Jacky.
See you again later.

1612
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:55,680
Excuse me. Howards End.

1613
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,440
Did you see the dawn?

1614
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:31,760
- And was it wonderful?
- No.

1615
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,120
It was only gray.

1616
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:54,160
Excuse me.
Could you direct me to Howards End?

1617
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:56,080
This is Howards End.

1618
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,960
Thank you very much, Charles.

1619
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:11,320
There are two boxes of books in...

1620
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:21,920
miss Schlegel... mrs. Wilcox,
you will have forgotten me.

1621
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:24,160
No, Mr. Bast,
I have not forgotten you.

1622
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,320
I want to know
where your sister is.

1623
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,320
- Where Helen is.
- Who is it?

1624
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,840
So this is Leonard Bast.

1625
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:41,440
This is for insulting a woman.

1626
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,560
- Get me a stick!
- We are capable of dealing with this.

1627
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:48,920
- What are you doing?
- Stand back!

1628
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,480
Stand up!

1629
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:18,400
It is your opinion that he was in
the last stages of heart disease.

1630
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:22,400
It would not be professional
to say so before an autopsy but...

1631
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:24,200
in private...

1632
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:26,720
that could well be my diagnosis.

1633
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:29,640
Obviously he was in
the last stage because...

1634
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:32,600
the moment I touched him with the sword
he crumpled up.

1635
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:35,520
Excuse me.
What sword would that have been?

1636
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:39,680
It's inside.
You better follow me.

1637
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:50,320
It's their father's old German sword.

1638
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:55,200
Of course, I only touched him
with the flat of it.

1639
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:56,400
Once?

1640
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:59,600
Yes, once.
Perhaps twice.

1641
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:05,360
I presume you will be staying
in Hilton, Mr. Wilcox.

1642
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:09,680
Yes. I'll be available
as long as it's necessary.

1643
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,640
And Mr. Charles Wilcox...

1644
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:14,880
we shall be requesting your presence
at the inquest, sir.

1645
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:19,640
Yes, I did expect that. I shall
naturally be the most important witness.

1646
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:00,360
Margaret?

1647
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:08,520
Good, Henry. I was going to come out
to Hilton to give you these.

1648
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:10,560
I have something to tell you.

1649
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:13,560
Never mind. I don't need to hear it.
I'm leaving you.

1650
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:16,720
- My life is with Helen now.
- Yes.

1651
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,640
I'm extremely tired.

1652
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,880
Come and sit down for a moment.

1653
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:25,640
Yes, for a moment.
We'll have to sit here on the grass.

1654
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:27,080
Yes.

1655
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,400
Here are your keys.

1656
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:37,000
We shall be staying with miss Avery
at the farm till we can leave.

1657
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:40,120
Yes.
Where are you going?

1658
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:44,480
To Germany. We'll start as soon
as possible after the inquest.

1659
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:47,760
- After the inquest?
- If Helen is well enough.

1660
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:50,200
You realize what the verdict
of the inquest will be?

1661
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:52,640
Yes.

1662
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:54,080
Heart disease.

1663
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:55,880
No, manslaughter...

1664
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:58,040
if not worse.

1665
02:07:58,080 --> 02:08:00,160
Charles may go to prison.

1666
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:02,080
I dare not tell him.

1667
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,840
I don't know what to do.

1668
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:08,600
I don't know what to do.

1669
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:15,880
I'm sorry.

1670
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:49,640
Is this going to suit everyone?

1671
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:54,040
I don't want you all coming here later
complaining that I've been unfair. Paul?

1672
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:55,960
Apparently it's got to suit us.

1673
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:00,920
You've only to speak, my boy, and
I'll leave the house to you entirely.

1674
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:05,320
Since I have to be at the business all
week, I'll find something more suitable.

1675
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:07,600
This place is not really the country...

1676
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:10,880
and it's certainly not the town.

1677
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:14,480
Does my arrangement suit you, Evie?

1678
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:16,920
- Of course, father.
- You, Dolly?

1679
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:20,640
I thought Charles wanted it
for the boys.

1680
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:23,520
But last time I saw him, he said no...

1681
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:26,080
because we can't possibly live
in this part of England again.

1682
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:29,200
Charles says we ought
to change our name.

1683
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:31,240
But I can't think what to.

1684
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:33,960
Wilcox just suits Charles and me.

1685
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,560
I can't think of any other name.

1686
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:39,360
Yes.

1687
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:43,520
Then I leave Howards End
to my wife absolutely.

1688
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:45,440
Let everyone understand that.

1689
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:47,440
And after I'm dead,
there's to be no jealousy...

1690
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,680
and no surprise.

1691
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:53,720
In consequence, I leave my wife
no money. That is her own wish.

1692
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:57,320
All my other assets
are to be divided among you.

1693
02:10:57,400 --> 02:11:02,080
This house, Howards End, she intends
at her death to leave to her nephew.

1694
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:16,200
It does seem curious. Mrs. Wilcox
wanted Margaret to have Howards...

1695
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:18,560
now she gets it after all.

1696
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:21,560
Have I put my foot in it?

1697
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:44,480
Tom, take baby's hand.

1698
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,800
Look. What's over there?

1699
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,480
I wonder what it is.

1700
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:59,560
Oh, it's a sweet child.
Rather like diddums was at that age.

1701
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:01,480
Come along, Dolly.

1702
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,120
Look who's there! Look!

1703
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:21,240
What did Dolly mean about Howards End?

1704
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:26,320
My poor Ruth,
during her last days...

1705
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,880
scribbled your name
on a piece of paper.

1706
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:31,960
Knowing her not to be herself,
I set it aside.

1707
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:35,480
I didn't do wrong, did i?

1708
02:12:35,560 --> 02:12:38,320
They're off.
There they go.
