1
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,139
Coffee.

2
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:19,734
Lights out.

3
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,076
Sorry. Did I startle you?

4
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:15,915
No, it's all right.

5
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,930
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

6
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,974
No-one can make it work.

7
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:24,102
A friend said that you were a miracle man.

8
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:28,064
- Do you know how much this is worth?
- I'd never sell it.

9
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:30,150
It belonged to my late father.

10
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:34,893
I thought you'd be much older.
You don't look like a watchmaker.

11
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:38,325
- What do watchmakers look like?
- I don't know.

12
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:42,620
Old... Beard...
From Belgium or France, you know.

13
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:45,749
The guy that owns the
store looks like that.

14
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,793
He's the miracle-worker.
I'm just a good impostor.

15
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,164
Call me when it's ready.

16
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:55,258
Dr Anna Nolmar?

17
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:57,344
You're a doctor?

18
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:00,513
I'm a cognitive therapist.

19
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:01,973
A psychoanalyst.

20
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:04,059
You don't look like an analyst.

21
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,102
What do analysts look like?

22
00:04:06,103 --> 00:04:09,967
Old... Beard... From Belgium.

23
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:13,443
I've got to go. I'm late for a session.

24
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:16,312
Please make it work again.

25
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:24,861
- Hi, Eddy.
- Hi, Bernie. How you doing?

26
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:33,171
OK, Stud Muffin, let's have it.

27
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,715
- Cheeseburger, please.
- OK.

28
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:39,052
- A dinner salad with thousand island dressing.
- Good choice.

29
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:42,550
- And a glass of milk.
- OK. Buns?

30
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:47,714
- Excuse me?
- Buns or toast, with the salad?

31
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,243
There's a baby!

32
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:07,737
- Help me! Help!
- Will somebody help her?

33
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,923
Eddy!

34
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:20,918
Don't go over there! Eddy, get back!

35
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:37,264
Jesus!

36
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,065
Let me out of here!

37
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:05,430
Lady!

38
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,717
Where are you?

39
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:18,226
Lady, where are you?

40
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:41,883
Dean Jordan, about to be sworn in
as the new US Attorney General

41
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:44,010
is in Los Angeles this weekend.

42
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:47,013
The former special prosecutor
achieved national prominence

43
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:50,767
while exposing vast corruption
in the defence procurement process.

44
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:55,021
On Sunday, Jordan will address
the National Bar Association's conference.

45
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:58,066
Known as a critic to coven operations...

46
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:03,113
- ...Jordan will outline his plan to investigate...
- Fantasy Girl. Credit card, please.

47
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:07,909
Credit card number 4833482373.

48
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:13,164
Your name is Barbara, you're a five
foot nine brunette bank teller.

49
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,000
- Your dream girl?
- Yeah.

50
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,287
From Portland.

51
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,630
With large breasts and...

52
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:22,731
...long legs.

53
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,127
And I'm Bobby.

54
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:30,709
Well, Bobby, is there something special
you'd like to talk about?

55
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,395
Tell me about the one night
we spent together last year.

56
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:38,606
When you locked me
in the bank vault?

57
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:41,276
- Are you wet?
- Just thinking about it.

58
00:07:41,277 --> 00:07:42,819
Good.

59
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,448
It was closing time
when you came to my window.

60
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:49,868
I hadn't seen a strong, sexy man all day...

61
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,995
..before rescue teams arrived.

62
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:54,414
He braved intense flames and toxic smoke

63
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:58,710
to rescue a woman and her infant
trapped in a raging inferno.

64
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:02,130
He ran into this building
with flames coming out

65
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:07,093
and people ran over and this guy,
he's just a regular guy, a watchmaker.

66
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:08,428
I couldn't believe it.

67
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:13,385
At a time when our heroes seem
confined to the sports arena...

68
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:38,667
- Yes, what is it?
- Hello, sir. Sorry to disturb you.

69
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:42,170
We have... a situation here.

70
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,130
A very weird situation.

71
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:47,050
- Do you remember Eddy Kay?
- Bluebird Eddy Kay?

72
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:50,387
- The same.
- What about Eddy Kay?

73
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:53,473
Well, I think I just saw him on TV.

74
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:55,141
When? Where?

75
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:58,061
Here in LA.

76
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:00,647
- Eddy is...
- He's supposed to be dead.

77
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:03,483
He's alive? What are you gonna do?

78
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:06,486
I think we must find out

79
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:09,936
and, if he is...

80
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,401
...we must deal with him quietly.

81
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:39,052
Hi, guys. How ya doing?

82
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:51,448
Don't be such a stuffy old father.

83
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:55,327
- You make it sound like...
- A dirty word.

84
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,663
..some sense into our kids.

85
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,199
...with their hips instead of their heads.

86
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,212
- Morning, Mrs MacDonald.
- Hi, Eddy.

87
00:10:06,213 --> 00:10:09,413
- You look nice today.
- Thank you very much.

88
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:13,379
- Good morning, Al.
- Morning.

89
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,686
Colonel, that is Eddy Kay.

90
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,388
I'll be damned.

91
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,598
Follow him.

92
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:36,409
Bring everybody in.
I don't want to take any chances with this.

93
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,455
Take a crack at him tonight.
Make it look like a robbery.

94
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,778
Somethings going on.

95
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,812
Help! Help!

96
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,290
Aah! Aah! Aah!

97
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,747
Somebody call the police!

98
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:48,356
- Lose the sandwich.
- Hey, lose the attitude, OK?

99
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:52,485
It's not some big-time homicide case. It's
a nothing piece-of-shit burglary detail.

100
00:11:52,486 --> 00:11:55,989
- Social security number.
- 527195251.

101
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,825
- Your telephone number?
- I don't have a telephone.

102
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:02,787
Mr Kay?
I'm Detective Sanchez. Are you all right?

103
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,622
Yeah, I'm fine, but...

104
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,360
Well, what seems to be the problem?

105
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:12,589
I'm not trying to tell anybody
how to do their job.

106
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,384
But these guys are insisting
on writing this up as a robbery.

107
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:19,346
And this guy was trying to kill me.

108
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:23,433
There's been several burglaries in the
neighbourhood in the last three months.

109
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:27,437
- They probably think it's the same man.
- This wasn't a burglary.

110
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:30,607
This guy was not a burglar, you know?

111
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:34,944
He didn't take anything. There's nothing
missing. I have nothing to take.

112
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:39,741
I opened my eyes
and his guy was coming at me with a knife.

113
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:43,370
Mr Kay, who has a good reason
to see you dead?

114
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:47,666
Someone you got mad recently,
someone who had a grudge against you.

115
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,293
Someone you owed money to.

116
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:54,130
I don't owe anybody money.
I'm... I'm a nice guy.

117
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:57,212
Mr Kay, what did the man look like?

118
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:02,041
I don't know, man. He was...

119
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:08,853
He looked like a psycho. He looked like
a killer. He was trying to kill me.

120
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,425
Then how come he didn't?

121
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:15,084
I don't know.

122
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:22,409
Good morning, Eddy.
Honey, could you help me with this pot?

123
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,203
I've got the earth all ready for it.

124
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,941
Just set it right in here, OK?

125
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,710
- Thank you. That's just great.
- There you go.

126
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:35,208
Thank you, that's great.
How are you feeling?

127
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,551
Eddy, what's the matter?

128
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,652
Are you all right?

129
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:43,596
- Eddy?
- Yes.

130
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:46,808
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

131
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,269
Is there anything I can do?

132
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,730
No, I'm all right. Sorry.

133
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,831
Sure, Eddy.

134
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,051
Eddy!

135
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,597
Move, asshole!

136
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,387
No.

137
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:08,256
This has to look like an accident.

138
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,020
I'll be damned.

139
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:16,356
The living dead.

140
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:20,980
- The package is ready. Let's go.
- I'll send the messenger.

141
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:34,193
The delivery will be on time.

142
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:42,048
Block four. Repeat, block four.

143
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,149
Alpha.

144
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:48,634
Alpha. Repeat, alpha.

145
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:53,674
Lock three, repeat lock three.

146
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,557
Block two. Repeat, block two.

147
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:07,069
- Block one.
- Bravo.

148
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,235
Bravo. Repeat, bravo.

149
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,760
Somebody call an ambulance.

150
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:28,678
- Did we kill him?
- I don't know.

151
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,973
- I think he's dead!
- Get the license number.

152
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:35,101
That guy hit him!
I didn't see anything.

153
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:37,228
He's moving.

154
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,482
- Call an ambulance, hurry!
- Get help!

155
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:43,433
No go. Repeat, no go.

156
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,259
Good evening, Eddy.

157
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:51,443
Do it!

158
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:00,636
This has gotta stop.

159
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,881
Yes?

160
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:31,468
Dr Nolmar? Hi, this is Eddy Kay.

161
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:33,762
Mr Kay. Is my watch ready?

162
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:37,182
The watch isn't fixed yet.
That's why I was calling.

163
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,478
I was hoping I could drop by the office,
your office...

164
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:45,899
...and, give you a replacement watch
that you could use.

165
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,779
- I wouldn't want to put you to any trouble.
- It'd be no trouble at all.

166
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,697
I'd like to do it.

167
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:57,202
If you really want to, you could come
by tonight after my last session.

168
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,371
- Do you have the address?
- Yes.

169
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:02,869
- A bit after eight.
- All right, see you then.

170
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:36,533
- Hello.
- Hi.

171
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:39,285
You really didn't have to, you know.

172
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:43,999
That's OK. I didn't want you walking around
with some electronic junk.

173
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,211
Thank you for bringing this over.
I appreciate good service.

174
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,664
Can I ask you a question?

175
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,876
I've been having these...

176
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:58,430
I don't even know what to call them.
Like...

177
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,974
nightmares, during the day.

178
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:03,760
They're real.

179
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:10,891
Like memories, but not memories
of anything that really happened to me.

180
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,901
Do you know anything about that?
Is that something that...?

181
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:23,538
Well, I have to leave soon.
Maybe you'd like to schedule a session.

182
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:25,707
No, I don't think so.

183
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,876
I'm... not...

184
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:30,662
It was... It was just a question.

185
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,120
Come in. Come in.

186
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:43,300
I see... images.

187
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:48,807
And some of them... are really violent.

188
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,060
And bloody.

189
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:56,029
It's really disgusting.

190
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,406
And...

191
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:01,986
Others of... women.

192
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:06,823
It's like pornography.

193
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:11,992
And I'm not... a violent person.

194
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:16,035
I don't know where I...

195
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:20,172
Maybe your repressed memory
is trying to come out.

196
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,724
No. I've got a really good memory.

197
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:27,426
I've always prided myself on that.

198
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:32,065
I can remember
the smallest details of my childhood,

199
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:34,442
my friends, their names.

200
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:39,489
I used to have a friend
named Kevin... Richards.

201
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,910
We used to call him Kevie.
We used to get into trouble together.

202
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:45,912
We'd play sports.

203
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:49,944
I had a really normal childhood.

204
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:54,671
Do you have any history
of alcohol or drug abuse?

205
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:56,131
Yeah.

206
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:59,342
I...

207
00:21:59,343 --> 00:22:04,055
I started drinking and I got into drugs.
I took a lot of drugs.

208
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,974
How did you stop?

209
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:10,270
I woke up in a garbage dump one morning.

210
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:12,313
And I was sick.

211
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:19,279
And my clothes had been really badly burned
and my body had been burned

212
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,865
and I don't know howl got there.

213
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:25,243
I knew then that I had to make a change.

214
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:29,664
I kind of drifted and ended up
on the West Coast.

215
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:35,712
And I felt... I was feeling good. I'd just
started feeling really good about myself.

216
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:38,506
When did you last get a check-up?

217
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:41,176
- A what?
- A medical examination.

218
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:43,261
I've never been sick.

219
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:48,308
Well, I think you should get
a thorough check-up and a brain scan.

220
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:51,144
A PET.

221
00:22:51,145 --> 00:22:54,314
You think there might be
something physically wrong?

222
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:59,986
No, but sometimes memory neurons
are destroyed by alcohol or drug abuse

223
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:02,739
or even cerebral tumours.

224
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,861
My uncle is a neuropsychiatrist
so I can easily make you an appointment.

225
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:16,920
- Thank you very much for your time.
- That's OK.

226
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:19,422
Gee, I forgot to pay you.

227
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:22,467
Well, let's barter.

228
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,387
You get this session for
fixing my watch. Deal?

229
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:27,591
Deal.

230
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:31,101
- Is that your father?
- Yes, we shared the office.

231
00:23:31,102 --> 00:23:33,019
- But...
- He died a year ago.

232
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,268
I can't bring myself to remove his name.

233
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:41,945
Good night, Mr Kay.

234
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:44,481
Thank you. I feel better.

235
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,985
Dr Nolmar?

236
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,148
Hi, Eddy.

237
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,302
I don't know you.

238
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:50,467
Come on, Eddy.
You know me well.

239
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:55,435
- Why don't we go somewhere and talk?
- About what?

240
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:58,021
Whatever. The past.

241
00:24:58,022 --> 00:25:00,308
Or the Duke.

242
00:25:01,484 --> 00:25:03,687
I don't know any duke.

243
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:09,194
We are in
an inescapable network of mutuality.

244
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,821
Get back!

245
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,996
Cut him off!

246
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:18,648
Cover me!

247
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:26,852
Stop. Help!

248
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:29,923
Let me in, please!

249
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:32,133
- Please!
- What is going on?

250
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:34,177
Go! Drive! Go, go!

251
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:38,014
God, they were trying to kill me!

252
00:27:38,015 --> 00:27:39,849
- Didn't you see them?
- Who?

253
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:45,055
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- N-No! Don't stop! Didn't you see them?

254
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:50,568
Eddy, please calm down.
There's nobody following us.

255
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,404
Didn't you see 'em?

256
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:55,688
- No.
- In the parking structure, you didn't see 'em?

257
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:59,786
Why don't you let me
take you to the police?

258
00:27:59,787 --> 00:28:02,706
I've been to the police.
They don't believe me.

259
00:28:02,707 --> 00:28:05,195
What do you want to do?

260
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,877
I don't know.

261
00:28:07,878 --> 00:28:11,965
Listen, Eddy, you're so confused and upset
at the moment. I...

262
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:16,261
I think we should go to hospital
and run those tests. Now.

263
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:19,248
The hospital. Why?

264
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:24,436
Anna, you are such a good doctor
but you have no private life.

265
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:26,938
- You drag me here in the middle of the night...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

266
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,039
...and for nothing!

267
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:33,945
- Am I all right?
- You're fine.

268
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:38,283
Though there are some irregularities
on your hippocampus.

269
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,577
- My what?
- Your hippocampus.

270
00:28:40,578 --> 00:28:43,872
The bundle of neurons
straddling the lower brain lobes.

271
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:47,417
What's the matter with
my hipp... hipp... whatever?

272
00:28:47,418 --> 00:28:49,961
It's difficult to explain, but...

273
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:52,672
...what the tests seem to show...
- Anna.

274
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:54,049
Yes?

275
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,553
You should be out with a sane young man
on a romantic evening.

276
00:28:58,554 --> 00:29:01,306
Uncle, you talk like my father...

277
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:04,590
Excuse me... but this hurts.

278
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:09,230
- Where are you from?
- I didn't know you spoke Hungarian.

279
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:12,275
Hungarian? I don't.

280
00:29:12,276 --> 00:29:13,693
But you just did.

281
00:29:13,694 --> 00:29:15,814
Yes, you did speak Hungarian.

282
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:22,994
- Hi.
- Hi. Do you have eggs for sale?

283
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:27,536
I don't have eggs, only sausages.
Do you want some?

284
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,230
Eddy.

285
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:39,052
- Eddy, what happened?
- God!

286
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:41,513
What?

287
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:44,516
- Yes?
- Bad news, sir.

288
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:47,977
- He's in the hospital.
- Hospital? Which one's got him?

289
00:29:47,978 --> 00:29:52,315
- Ha. Psychiatric ward.
- Psychiatric? Is he talking?

290
00:29:52,316 --> 00:29:54,651
I don't know how much he remembers.

291
00:29:54,652 --> 00:29:57,320
Certainly he doesn't remember anything
before the de-programming.

292
00:29:57,321 --> 00:30:02,534
And, if he'd wanted to,
he could have caused us trouble years ago.

293
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:05,412
- So he's not posing an immediate threat?
- Yes.

294
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:09,749
But to be on the safe side,
perhaps we should call Sunday off.

295
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,836
We can't do that.
There's too much at stake.

296
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:15,463
Forget about doing this quietly.
There isn't time.

297
00:30:15,464 --> 00:30:18,633
Go in big, take Kay out and finish the job.

298
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:22,332
Sir, I don't think that'd be prudent...

299
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:28,018
If physically nothing's wrong with me,
then why do I feel so different?

300
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:31,604
My body just feels so different.

301
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:33,705
It's like...

302
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:39,272
...I know how to do things
that I don't know how to do.

303
00:30:39,947 --> 00:30:43,450
Somebody else is living in my body.

304
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:46,661
Have you ever undergone treatment
in a mental institution?

305
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:50,206
No. I've never been in a hospital,
never even been sick.

306
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:52,208
That's why this thing is...

307
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:54,586
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

308
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:58,748
Come... Come...

309
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:05,708
Come to me, Eddy. Come to me.

310
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,201
Eddy.

311
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:13,813
What do you see? Tell me.

312
00:31:13,814 --> 00:31:15,914
Building.

313
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:20,225
La... Lang Mental Institute.

314
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:24,773
Lang... Lang.

315
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:29,913
I've never heard of it. I'll check
tomorrow. They should have your records.

316
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:31,706
I've never been there.

317
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:33,583
I've never been there.

318
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:36,795
- Listen, you should try and sleep.
- No, no.

319
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:38,713
Can't you stay?

320
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:41,091
- A little while?
- You really should sleep.

321
00:31:41,092 --> 00:31:43,218
Please, please.

322
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:47,180
- Let me give you a sedative.
- I don't want a sedative.

323
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:49,966
Please, I don't want to be alone.

324
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:52,662
- Lieutenant Curtis in?
- I don't think so.

325
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:56,124
The only police personnel
is Officer Gilbert on night duty.

326
00:32:56,125 --> 00:33:01,875
- I could call and check.
- It's OK. He's supposed to meet us. We'll wait.

327
00:33:03,507 --> 00:33:05,607
How you doing, sir?

328
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:10,875
D5. Psychiatric.

329
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:36,658
It's OK.

330
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:51,737
What was that?

331
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:57,159
Hey, what the]?

332
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:03,582
Don't shoot!

333
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,652
- What is it?
- Men with guns.

334
00:34:30,094 --> 00:34:32,637
Come on! Come on!

335
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:36,051
Damn, we outta time. Come on, let's go.

336
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,451
Come on!

337
00:34:54,452 --> 00:34:56,453
Come on!

338
00:34:56,454 --> 00:34:59,164
Stop. I want to get out. Please.

339
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:03,543
How'd they know where I was?
Only you knew I was at the hospital.

340
00:35:03,544 --> 00:35:06,379
And in the garage.
You're one of them.

341
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,716
Why accuse me?
I've only tried to help you.

342
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:13,887
By giving me a sedative?
If I'd taken that, I'd be dead.

343
00:35:13,888 --> 00:35:16,056
You're mad.

344
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:20,060
Whatever your game is,
I don't want to be involved.

345
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:22,479
You are involved!

346
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,305
Just do what I say. Exactly what I say.
Do you understand me?

347
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,280
Stay here.

348
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:34,381
Sta)'-

349
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,504
- Aubrey, Homicide.
- Forensics?

350
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:50,298
Yeah, hang on a minute. Hey, Sanchez.

351
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:53,914
- Line one, it's for you.
- I'll take it over here.

352
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,091
- Sanchez.
- Eddy Kay. Remember me?

353
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,769
Do you know what happened?
Did you hear what happened?

354
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,604
They're trying to kill me.

355
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:07,065
- Is Dr Nolmar with you?
- Yes.

356
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:09,609
If anything happens to me, she gets hurt.

357
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,988
Eddy, or whatever your name is,
you are in trouble.

358
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:15,907
- Get here as soon as you can.
- What?

359
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:18,894
You're not Eddy Kay. Cut the bullshit.

360
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:21,705
- What?
- Listen to me.

361
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:28,086
Now, Eddy Kay,
social security number 527195251

362
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:29,921
born Canton, Ohio,

363
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:33,916
died - do you hear me?
- died in Vietnam in 1972.

364
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:37,841
- I'm not Eddy Kay.
- What did he say?

365
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:44,216
Get off me! Eddy, get off me!

366
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:47,965
Let me go. Let me go!

367
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:51,333
Get in!

368
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:56,982
If you try anything in the hotel, anything,
I'll kill you, understand?

369
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:21,806
Eddy, please.

370
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:24,559
You need medicine.

371
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,062
Let me fetch you some medicine, Eddy.

372
00:37:27,063 --> 00:37:29,634
You could have a stroke.

373
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:34,933
Just a few grains of Phenelzine
or nialamide will calm you down.

374
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:40,241
- You don't know who you are, Eddy.
- I know who I am!

375
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:43,286
Somebody is trying to
make me think I don't!

376
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:45,163
- Hello?
- Hello.

377
00:37:45,164 --> 00:37:48,958
Mrs Richards? Mrs Richards
of 852 Elm Street?

378
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,503
- Yes.
- It's good to hear your voice.

379
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:54,089
And yours. Who is this?

380
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,258
- Mrs Richards, this is Eddy Kay.
- Who?

381
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:59,552
Your neighbour, Kevin's friend, Eddy Kay.

382
00:37:59,553 --> 00:38:03,973
Is this some kind of a prank?
Eddy's dead. He was killed in Vietnam.

383
00:38:03,974 --> 00:38:07,352
If this is a prank, it's not funny.

384
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:10,397
- It's not a prank.
- Then who is this?

385
00:38:10,398 --> 00:38:14,359
I... I didn't die. I...

386
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,444
I...

387
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:18,154
I didn't die, I...

388
00:38:18,155 --> 00:38:20,255
Mrs Richards, please.

389
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,864
Mrs Richards, please.

390
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:28,039
Please, Mrs Richards.

391
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,140
What have you done?

392
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:34,546
It's a sacrilege.
Let him rest in peace.

393
00:38:34,547 --> 00:38:38,541
Are you listening to me?
Go to hell.

394
00:38:44,932 --> 00:38:48,309
I'm sorry. I'm in big trouble.

395
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,813
I don't even know what I've done.

396
00:38:51,814 --> 00:38:53,914
Help me.

397
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:01,865
- May I help you, sir?
- Phillips.

398
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:05,030
They still have money in their houses.

399
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:15,754
- Phillips?
- Yes.

400
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:17,672
- Taylor.
- Hi.

401
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:21,301
- I didn't expect to see you.
- You've received your instructions?

402
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:23,970
My instructions, yes.

403
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:27,932
Verbally. Nobody wanted to
put anything down on paper.

404
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:31,353
I'm supposed to give you
full computer trace access

405
00:39:31,354 --> 00:39:35,398
and taps on police lines
on the basis of a verbal.

406
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:37,887
Colonel, let me tell you something.

407
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:43,442
I don't want to have
anything to do with it.

408
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:49,204
It's guys like me that get shafted,
not you. Not the guys giving orders.

409
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:53,864
I'd just as soon be fired now
as wind up in Lewiston on contempt.

410
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:58,088
Mr Phillips, I appreciate your predicament.

411
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:01,132
But at the risk of sounding cliched

412
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:04,333
let me tell you, this isn't
about getting fired.

413
00:40:05,554 --> 00:40:08,374
This is about life expectancy.

414
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:11,714
Are you threatening me, Colonel?

415
00:40:12,436 --> 00:40:15,397
I see you have an isolator. Shall we?

416
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:17,803
And I'll need some coffee.

417
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:36,528
Have you ever heard about
the original Bluebird program?

418
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:43,508
I've seen the name in the files. It's
restricted access. We're talking 1970s, right?

419
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:45,609
Yeah. Well.

420
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:50,557
You see, the agency was having
problems with in-house operations.

421
00:40:50,558 --> 00:40:53,393
Morale, discipline were extremely low.

422
00:40:53,394 --> 00:40:55,687
We needed a new kind of operative.

423
00:40:55,688 --> 00:41:01,109
More reliable, more immediate,
less... questioning.

424
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,820
Less... moral.

425
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:08,658
We needed fucking Samurai warriors.
People to get the job done.

426
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:13,872
So we started doing
behaviour modification experiments

427
00:41:13,873 --> 00:41:17,322
using young subjects, 18, 19.

428
00:41:20,504 --> 00:41:26,077
13 of the original
subjects died in training.

429
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:31,040
Seven became exceptional operatives.

430
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,637
Six are still active.

431
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:38,772
And the seventh?

432
00:41:38,773 --> 00:41:41,308
Eddy Kay-

433
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,272
Probably the best subject, I'm certain.

434
00:41:47,406 --> 00:41:49,562
Highest scores ever.

435
00:41:50,493 --> 00:41:53,479
Technology, languages,
hand-to-hand, everything.

436
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:55,872
So?

437
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:59,084
He quit on you? He's writing a book? What?

438
00:41:59,085 --> 00:42:00,669
Phillips.

439
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,797
Eddy Kay was involved in an elimination.

440
00:42:03,798 --> 00:42:06,966
We thought he'd been killed
during the elimination.

441
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:10,553
Not so. And now he is threatening
a major operation

442
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:13,802
and I got 48 hours to bring him in.

443
00:42:14,975 --> 00:42:19,979
We are not talking about
a little scandal here.

444
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,966
We are talking about political systems.

445
00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:27,767
Which is why it has to be verbal.

446
00:42:28,531 --> 00:42:31,992
And why you have to cooperate.

447
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:34,979
Come in, six. Your position?

448
00:42:46,173 --> 00:42:49,634
- Hi, honey!
- Come in, three.

449
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:51,755
This is three. Negative.

450
00:42:57,768 --> 00:42:59,868
Eddy?

451
00:43:00,104 --> 00:43:02,647
What are you going to do?

452
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:06,318
What do you do
when you don't know what to do?

453
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,938
You have to talk to yourself.

454
00:43:10,072 --> 00:43:14,814
You have to act against your inclination
to act instinctively...

455
00:43:15,745 --> 00:43:17,901
...irrationally...

456
00:43:18,456 --> 00:43:20,874
...violently...

457
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:23,293
...and hang onto a belief system.

458
00:43:23,294 --> 00:43:28,451
You went to school for six or seven years
and dish out that crap?

459
00:43:34,055 --> 00:43:36,211
Aren't you hungry?

460
00:43:37,475 --> 00:43:40,977
You know, you can think better
on a full stomach.

461
00:43:40,978 --> 00:43:43,715
Maybe we could find a coffee shop.

462
00:43:49,028 --> 00:43:52,276
All right. I'll get us something to eat.

463
00:43:53,574 --> 00:43:56,822
Here's some money, and
take the credit card.

464
00:43:58,287 --> 00:44:01,617
- Take off your sweater and stockings.
- What?

465
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:05,325
- Take off your sweater and stockings.
- Why?

466
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:14,052
Don't move.

467
00:44:14,053 --> 00:44:17,055
No matter what you do, don't move.

468
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:20,968
Slip up just a little bit,
it'll cut you to ribbons.

469
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:25,970
Where did you learn this little trick?
In watchmaker's school?

470
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:32,889
And I was feeling sorry for you!

471
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,389
One, your position.

472
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,490
No contact.

473
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:06,048
I don't hold nothing back.

474
00:45:11,444 --> 00:45:13,544
Are you coming up?

475
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:21,301
Thank you.

476
00:45:23,164 --> 00:45:27,625
- We've got her cards. It's a matter of time.
- Great. What about LAPD photo system?

477
00:45:27,626 --> 00:45:29,377
- We're in. You want coffee?
- Yeah.

478
00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:31,963
- Coffee, please. Two.
- Field communications?

479
00:45:31,964 --> 00:45:35,467
Yeah, we're established.
Honey, slide over a second.

480
00:45:35,468 --> 00:45:40,127
Dr Anna Nolmar.
Psychologist, born Budapest, Hungary.

481
00:45:44,477 --> 00:45:46,436
Food's here, come and get it.

482
00:45:46,437 --> 00:45:50,265
Very funny. Do you mind
disarming this thing, please?

483
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:02,327
You...!

484
00:46:02,328 --> 00:46:04,871
- You!
- Come here. Calm down.

485
00:46:04,872 --> 00:46:08,166
I had to make sure
that you wouldn't leave.

486
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:13,491
Stick with me through the night.
I'll let you go in the morning, I promise.

487
00:46:15,675 --> 00:46:18,460
Is that the best you could do?

488
00:46:18,928 --> 00:46:20,303
Yeah.

489
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:24,547
Hope you're not on a diet.

490
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:36,903
Robbery, Homicide. Sanchez.

491
00:46:36,904 --> 00:46:41,366
Sanchez, I've got Dr Nolmar.

492
00:46:41,367 --> 00:46:45,787
But I'm ready to release her to
you, personally. Only to you.

493
00:46:45,788 --> 00:46:48,748
I don't want any other cop
or detective involved.

494
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:52,752
- If I see another cop it's a no-show.
- Understood.

495
00:46:52,753 --> 00:46:55,547
Maya Theater on Sixth and Hill Street.

496
00:46:55,548 --> 00:46:57,257
Got it. Maya Theater.

497
00:46:57,258 --> 00:47:00,176
- Can you be there in 2O minutes?
- Got it.

498
00:47:00,177 --> 00:47:03,377
- Alone.
- Now, listen, Eddy. Hold on...

499
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:07,219
- It's done.
- Thank you.

500
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:22,824
Sorry I had to take your car.

501
00:47:22,825 --> 00:47:26,440
- I'll send you a check or something.
- OK.

502
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,826
- Eddy.
- Yeah?

503
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:36,228
Nothing.

504
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,011
Regola?

505
00:47:52,438 --> 00:47:54,538
Thank you.

506
00:48:30,685 --> 00:48:32,977
Our top story of the hour.

507
00:48:32,978 --> 00:48:37,524
A powerful explosion rocked the centre
block of Olympic Boulevard this morning.

508
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:41,903
Police suspect the bomb was planted
in the offices of Dr Anna Nolmar,

509
00:48:41,904 --> 00:48:45,699
a psychiatrist believed abducted
by one of her patients.

510
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,070
Authorities would not comment...

511
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:56,239
It's her.

512
00:48:59,255 --> 00:49:01,256
Dr Nolmar.

513
00:49:01,257 --> 00:49:04,300
- Detective Sanchez.
- Do you need medical attention?

514
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:08,462
I'm so relieved to see you.
It's been such an ordeal.

515
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:42,521
Eddy!

516
00:49:42,631 --> 00:49:44,870
Grab me, tight!

517
00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:02,852
Upstairs, go!

518
00:50:31,472 --> 00:50:34,391
Get down!

519
00:50:34,392 --> 00:50:37,046
What are you doing?

520
00:50:43,442 --> 00:50:45,542
They're shooting up there!

521
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,630
Quiet.

522
00:51:08,551 --> 00:51:11,537
Love this.

523
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:19,421
When I fire, cross!

524
00:51:20,146 --> 00:51:22,432
Go!

525
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:41,320
No!

526
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:48,631
God!

527
00:51:48,632 --> 00:51:50,732
Shit.

528
00:51:55,806 --> 00:51:58,128
- What?
- Go over.

529
00:52:00,686 --> 00:52:02,520
Let go!

530
00:52:02,521 --> 00:52:05,258
Let go! Let go!

531
00:52:10,446 --> 00:52:13,017
Baby! God!

532
00:52:16,661 --> 00:52:18,817
Out! Go, go!

533
00:52:42,812 --> 00:52:46,231
Eddy, I'm so scared.

534
00:52:46,232 --> 00:52:48,803
I know, I know.

535
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,848
We gotta disappear.

536
00:52:52,113 --> 00:52:54,213
Where?

537
00:52:54,532 --> 00:52:57,151
I don't know. I don't know.

538
00:52:57,702 --> 00:53:00,453
I could pay somebody
to take us to Mexico.

539
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:05,458
- I thought you were in the hospital.
- Good to see you back, Sanchez.

540
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:07,919
- You look like shit.
- Thanks so much.

541
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,255
What's the story on those stiffs?

542
00:53:10,256 --> 00:53:13,466
Same as Kay. Names and social
securities - help yourself-

543
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:16,011
are individuals who died in Vietnam.

544
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:19,055
Who the hell are they? Some crazy vet gang?

545
00:53:19,056 --> 00:53:23,852
It gets better. See, these guys
never got near Vietnam.

546
00:53:23,853 --> 00:53:28,565
Each of these stiffs has two separate
identities, both fully documented.

547
00:53:28,566 --> 00:53:33,320
All three are convicted murderers.
We're talking some vicious motherfuckers.

548
00:53:33,321 --> 00:53:38,241
I don't get it. Are you telling me
that all these motherfuckers got sprung?

549
00:53:38,242 --> 00:53:42,787
No, all these motherfuckers got sent
to the same cuckoo nest,

550
00:53:42,788 --> 00:53:46,949
Lang Institute.
Go figure.

551
00:54:15,154 --> 00:54:18,354
All right, it's her bank card.

552
00:54:20,242 --> 00:54:21,743
Where?

553
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:24,162
At the Olivera and Alameda branch.

554
00:54:24,163 --> 00:54:26,373
Call the guards. We're in business.

555
00:54:26,374 --> 00:54:28,474
Get the chopper ready.

556
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:38,913
She's at an ATM at Olivera and
Alameda. Estimate you have 35 seconds.

557
00:54:47,603 --> 00:54:50,340
She made a selection.
25 seconds.

558
00:55:04,495 --> 00:55:06,865
Estimate ten seconds.

559
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:17,481
Transaction processed.

560
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,150
Go there.

561
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:25,306
- Hurry up!
- I'm waiting for the receipt.

562
00:55:25,307 --> 00:55:27,926
Fuck the receipt! Come on!

563
00:55:29,562 --> 00:55:32,014
Get in.

564
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:36,058
- Straight to Mexico, OK?
- OK.

565
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:10,185
Sorry about your father's watch.
I know it meant a lot to you.

566
00:56:10,186 --> 00:56:12,342
That's OK.

567
00:56:13,647 --> 00:56:16,017
I'll live.

568
00:56:17,318 --> 00:56:19,474
Maybe.

569
00:56:27,411 --> 00:56:29,511
I'm sorry.

570
00:56:30,414 --> 00:56:32,819
I haven't cried in years.

571
00:56:34,377 --> 00:56:37,197
I didn't even cry at my father's funeral.

572
00:56:42,677 --> 00:56:45,595
He trained me to hold back my emotions.

573
00:56:45,596 --> 00:56:48,630
He didn't want me to be vulnerable.

574
00:57:17,211 --> 00:57:20,459
Buenos dies, amigo.

575
00:57:43,863 --> 00:57:48,225
I suppose I'd better go
and get some local currency.

576
00:58:08,596 --> 00:58:11,796
As long as there is poverty...

577
00:58:22,985 --> 00:58:25,085
My God!

578
00:58:26,572 --> 00:58:30,270
Too much to drink?

579
00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:44,714
It's OK.

580
00:58:44,715 --> 00:58:47,050
I'm a doctor.

581
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:49,788
We're fine, thank you. We're fine.

582
00:58:53,808 --> 00:58:56,309
I don't really know what I did.

583
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:59,011
I think I have killed.

584
00:59:01,315 --> 00:59:03,601
I can't do this.

585
00:59:04,527 --> 00:59:07,237
Sorry, I can't do this.

586
00:59:07,238 --> 00:59:09,364
Can't do what?

587
00:59:09,365 --> 00:59:11,817
I can't live like this.

588
00:59:12,201 --> 00:59:15,484
I have to know what I did.

589
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:22,581
- I have to go back.
- Where?

590
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:25,797
The Lang Institute.

591
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:29,467
There's nothing there.
I called to check your records.

592
00:59:29,468 --> 00:59:33,013
- It's been shut for 13 years.
- Where is it?

593
00:59:33,014 --> 00:59:35,932
- Arizona.
- Where in Arizona?

594
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:38,033
Oracle, Arizona.

595
00:59:40,396 --> 00:59:42,635
Here we go again!

596
00:59:45,568 --> 00:59:47,569
Are you married, Colonel?

597
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:50,280
- No. You?
- Yes.

598
00:59:50,281 --> 00:59:53,778
Three kids. I've got a son at Harvard.

599
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:57,912
- Car rental, San Diego. Silver Taurus.
- They're on plastic.

600
00:59:57,913 --> 01:00:01,499
They'll have to come up for air again.
Send a team.

601
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,320
Do 'em before tomorrow night,
we're operational.

602
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:15,430
Do you want some?

603
01:00:15,431 --> 01:00:18,512
Studies prove it will help you live longer.

604
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:27,291
Thanks, doc.

605
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,654
It's Anna.

606
01:00:30,655 --> 01:00:33,907
I think by now you can call me Anna.

607
01:00:33,908 --> 01:00:35,825
Anna.

608
01:00:35,826 --> 01:00:38,314
It's a nice name.

609
01:01:09,735 --> 01:01:11,835
Take a right here.

610
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:09,987
What kind of people would do this?

611
01:02:23,768 --> 01:02:26,936
Eddy. Eddy, look at this.

612
01:02:26,937 --> 01:02:28,688
This doesn't make any sense.

613
01:02:28,689 --> 01:02:32,108
"Military personnel only.
No admittance beyond this point."

614
01:02:32,109 --> 01:02:37,065
Why would they have something like this
in a mental institution?

615
01:03:39,552 --> 01:03:42,337
It's just a bat.

616
01:04:30,811 --> 01:04:33,980
No, it's hydraulic.

617
01:04:33,981 --> 01:04:36,483
The power's been off for years.

618
01:04:36,484 --> 01:04:40,063
Most medical facilities have
a back-up generator.

619
01:04:49,664 --> 01:04:52,069
How...

620
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,968
Is this the place?

621
01:07:01,212 --> 01:07:04,198
This is where I started.

622
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,043
It feels right.

623
01:07:07,593 --> 01:07:10,136
Familiar.

624
01:07:10,137 --> 01:07:12,514
I just want to lie down.

625
01:07:12,515 --> 01:07:14,885
Not go anywhere.

626
01:07:15,976 --> 01:07:18,186
This is home.

627
01:07:18,187 --> 01:07:20,841
Just right.

628
01:07:21,941 --> 01:07:24,097
Shut my eyes.

629
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:27,002
Home.

630
01:07:51,303 --> 01:07:53,506
Eddy, can you hear me?

631
01:07:53,931 --> 01:07:56,766
Eddy! Eddy, can you hear me?

632
01:07:56,767 --> 01:07:58,518
Eddy!

633
01:07:58,519 --> 01:08:00,722
Shit!

634
01:08:54,325 --> 01:08:57,026
My God!

635
01:08:57,328 --> 01:08:59,531
This is me!

636
01:09:08,005 --> 01:09:10,457
This is incredible.

637
01:09:11,258 --> 01:09:13,912
Totally ingenious.

638
01:09:15,721 --> 01:09:17,222
Eddy, are you OK?

639
01:09:17,223 --> 01:09:20,553
They made me Eddy Kay.

640
01:09:22,061 --> 01:09:25,142
They did it to me.

641
01:09:27,191 --> 01:09:30,011
They made me Eddy Kay.

642
01:09:37,868 --> 01:09:39,953
I remember...

643
01:09:39,954 --> 01:09:42,872
I remember...

644
01:09:42,873 --> 01:09:45,741
Yes, I remember.

645
01:09:58,973 --> 01:10:01,016
Hello, Eddy.

646
01:10:01,017 --> 01:10:03,469
You're looking good today.

647
01:10:19,243 --> 01:10:23,788
What is your name?

648
01:10:23,789 --> 01:10:27,459
Your name... is Eddy Kay.

649
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:32,369
My name is Oliver Dykstra.

650
01:10:54,445 --> 01:10:57,947
Your name... is Eddy Kay.

651
01:10:57,948 --> 01:11:01,785
What is your name, Eddy? Tell me.

652
01:11:01,786 --> 01:11:04,357
My name is Eddy Kay.

653
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:08,283
My name is Eddy Kay.

654
01:11:20,429 --> 01:11:22,668
I'm your girl.

655
01:11:24,892 --> 01:11:26,393
Yes.

656
01:11:26,394 --> 01:11:31,184
This is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

657
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:35,902
That's the man I killed.

658
01:11:35,903 --> 01:11:38,059
That's the man I killed.

659
01:11:43,661 --> 01:11:46,162
You didn't kill anybody, Eddy.

660
01:11:46,163 --> 01:11:49,541
It's not a real memory.
It's an induced memory.

661
01:11:49,542 --> 01:11:51,793
You were brainwashed,

662
01:11:51,794 --> 01:11:55,213
practically recreated
through a rebirth process.

663
01:11:55,214 --> 01:12:00,301
These images represent artificial
experiences imprinted on your mind,

664
01:12:00,302 --> 01:12:02,887
reinforced by pain and pleasure.

665
01:12:02,888 --> 01:12:04,889
It's all fake.

666
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:09,217
None of this is real, Eddy.
You're not a murderer.

667
01:12:09,895 --> 01:12:14,566
- You're not a murderer.
- My God. I'm not a murderer!

668
01:12:14,567 --> 01:12:17,850
I'm not a murderer. I'm a...

669
01:12:19,905 --> 01:12:22,191
This is real.

670
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:25,360
This is real. This is real.

671
01:13:03,532 --> 01:13:06,862
Talk to me. Let it out. Talk to me.

672
01:13:15,378 --> 01:13:17,478
Are you OK?

673
01:13:19,173 --> 01:13:21,543
Hurry, Eddy.

674
01:13:23,094 --> 01:13:25,582
Hold on to me. Come on.

675
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:44,656
I'm back.

676
01:13:44,657 --> 01:13:46,783
I got that stuff you wanted.

677
01:13:46,784 --> 01:13:49,828
I also bought us some new clothes.

678
01:13:49,829 --> 01:13:54,290
I think these have had it.
Eddy?

679
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:59,587
I'm sorry I keep calling you Eddy.
I don't know what else to call you.

680
01:13:59,588 --> 01:14:03,425
It's so difficult to accept
what these people did to you.

681
01:14:03,426 --> 01:14:06,469
Is it OK if I call my uncle?

682
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:09,504
He's probably worried to death about me.

683
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:18,217
I'd like to place a call.
My calling card number is 213658214153.

684
01:14:18,482 --> 01:14:20,859
We are ready, sir.

685
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:23,265
But it's your decision.

686
01:14:23,821 --> 01:14:25,921
He's surfaced again.

687
01:14:37,543 --> 01:14:39,995
Look at you.

688
01:14:41,672 --> 01:14:44,457
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

689
01:14:45,259 --> 01:14:47,052
Just...

690
01:14:47,053 --> 01:14:49,423
...angry-

691
01:14:50,306 --> 01:14:53,043
God, these look terrible.

692
01:14:56,228 --> 01:14:58,328
You know...

693
01:14:58,647 --> 01:15:03,768
When I was small, my mother used to
kiss the pain away. Didn't yours?

694
01:15:06,989 --> 01:15:09,089
Sorry.

695
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:11,759
I'm sorry.

696
01:15:26,759 --> 01:15:29,378
Look 2A you.

697
01:16:37,788 --> 01:16:39,888
Eddy?

698
01:16:45,963 --> 01:16:48,063
Eddy, is that you?

699
01:16:58,309 --> 01:17:00,643
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

700
01:17:00,644 --> 01:17:03,063
- Don't shoot me.
- Where is he?

701
01:17:03,064 --> 01:17:06,976
I don't know.
Please believe me, I don't know.

702
01:17:08,444 --> 01:17:11,727
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is!

703
01:17:13,574 --> 01:17:16,987
Get off me! God!

704
01:17:17,536 --> 01:17:19,412
- Say A.
- Don't shoot me.

705
01:17:19,413 --> 01:17:21,513
- Wait.
- Don't shoot me.

706
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:26,451
This will only take a minute.

707
01:17:28,214 --> 01:17:31,912
Please don't hurt me.

708
01:17:33,761 --> 01:17:38,014
Get off! Get off me!

709
01:17:38,015 --> 01:17:40,254
Get off me!

710
01:18:21,225 --> 01:18:23,713
Don't move!

711
01:18:27,314 --> 01:18:30,431
- Make the call.
- You don't stand a chance.

712
01:18:31,027 --> 01:18:33,598
It'll only buy you 24 hours.

713
01:18:37,408 --> 01:18:41,244
You won't shoot me in cold blood.

714
01:18:41,245 --> 01:18:45,415
You didn't have it in you then,
and you don't now.

715
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:49,826
- I know you well, remember?
- Give me that water bottle.

716
01:19:01,474 --> 01:19:03,574
Make the call.

717
01:19:15,821 --> 01:19:17,989
- Hello?
- It's me.

718
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:20,727
- Where are you calling from?
- From Oracle.

719
01:19:22,495 --> 01:19:24,245
- It's done.
- Good work.

720
01:19:24,246 --> 01:19:26,532
See you at the Duke.

721
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,168
What duke were you talking about?

722
01:19:30,169 --> 01:19:33,755
- I didn't say anything about a duke.
- Yes, you did.

723
01:19:33,756 --> 01:19:38,297
In the parking structure,
you said you wanted to talk about the duke.

724
01:19:46,394 --> 01:19:49,229
The Duke Hotel.
The new Attorney General.

725
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:52,315
Dean... Jordan.

726
01:19:52,316 --> 01:19:54,150
They're gonna kill him.

727
01:19:54,151 --> 01:19:57,570
- When?
- Tonight.

728
01:19:57,571 --> 01:20:00,391
Nine o'clock.

729
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:05,896
You really didn't know, did you?

730
01:20:14,547 --> 01:20:17,332
Can't complain, Colonel.

731
01:20:20,386 --> 01:20:24,547
- Hey, Ron.
- Taylor, you look busy.

732
01:20:26,017 --> 01:20:28,117
Thank you, sir.

733
01:20:33,524 --> 01:20:35,400
Step through, sir.

734
01:20:35,401 --> 01:20:37,687
Excuse me.

735
01:20:39,864 --> 01:20:41,964
Yes.

736
01:20:50,207 --> 01:20:52,659
I am so excited.

737
01:20:54,045 --> 01:20:56,145
He's our man.

738
01:21:00,634 --> 01:21:04,747
- Where's the rest room?
- Straight down the hall, sir.

739
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:41,044
- Could I get a shine?
- Have a seat.

740
01:21:46,847 --> 01:21:48,967
What time is it?

741
01:21:49,809 --> 01:21:52,012
It's almost eight.

742
01:21:52,853 --> 01:21:54,953
We won't make it.

743
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:03,104
How about a kiss for good luck?

744
01:22:34,979 --> 01:22:39,274
The man of the hour,
a man not afraid to expose the truth,

745
01:22:39,275 --> 01:22:43,611
and a man who feels
that America should lead by example

746
01:22:43,612 --> 01:22:49,326
as we pave the way for
a global democracy in the 21 st century.

747
01:22:49,327 --> 01:22:53,330
I give you the next Attorney General
of the United States,

748
01:22:53,331 --> 01:22:56,032
Dean Jordan!

749
01:23:02,298 --> 01:23:05,118
I hope we're not too late.

750
01:23:14,477 --> 01:23:16,577
My God!

751
01:23:21,817 --> 01:23:25,930
We have witnessed extraordinary events
this past year.

752
01:23:26,781 --> 01:23:28,881
Dictatorships toppled...

753
01:23:31,869 --> 01:23:34,239
Eddy, it's the police.

754
01:23:38,751 --> 01:23:41,832
The right to pursue
individual happiness.

755
01:23:51,972 --> 01:23:55,302
If Eastern Europe can clean up its act...

756
01:24:23,963 --> 01:24:25,463
Get out the car!

757
01:24:25,464 --> 01:24:28,675
- Get out! Where's the driver?
- Don't shoot me!

758
01:24:28,676 --> 01:24:32,429
- Get out the car!
- I want Detective Sanchez.

759
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:35,416
Detective Sanchez knows all about this.

760
01:24:51,032 --> 01:24:53,132
Excuse me, sir.

761
01:25:00,207 --> 01:25:03,626
I admit it again...

762
01:25:03,627 --> 01:25:06,504
I have to get inside. It's an emergency.

763
01:25:06,505 --> 01:25:09,049
Sir, do you have a ticket?

764
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:13,219
- No. I lost my ticket.
- Can't help you without a ticket.

765
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:17,214
- Who's in charge?
- Sorry, sir. Can't help you without a ticket.

766
01:25:19,769 --> 01:25:26,358
In order to maximise the potential
of our great democratic institution...

767
01:25:26,359 --> 01:25:29,486
Come on.

768
01:25:29,487 --> 01:25:31,821
Excuse me, sir. I've got a problem.

769
01:25:31,822 --> 01:25:34,574
I lost my ticket. No, no, no...

770
01:25:34,575 --> 01:25:40,497
Look at this watch. It's a $1,200 watch. Give
me your ticket, I'll give you the watch.

771
01:25:40,498 --> 01:25:45,288
- Please. It's really important to me.
- I don't like these things. Have fun.

772
01:25:45,336 --> 01:25:48,296
It was in my jacket the whole time.

773
01:25:48,297 --> 01:25:50,382
Believe me, it's mine.

774
01:25:50,383 --> 01:25:52,539
Thank you.

775
01:25:52,802 --> 01:25:55,456
To expose...

776
01:25:56,472 --> 01:26:02,268
We will take the reins away
from these usurpers of power.

777
01:26:02,269 --> 01:26:09,016
Never again will common criminals be
licensed to act in the name of this country.

778
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:16,693
Do you mind?

779
01:26:18,035 --> 01:26:23,441
I must prepare for some of the
most difficult years of my career.

780
01:26:30,631 --> 01:26:33,091
Hey, what's happening?

781
01:26:33,092 --> 01:26:36,790
- She's in the back.
- Detective Sanchez, here I am. Hurry.

782
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:41,182
Eddy's at the Duke Hotel.
They're after Jordan.

783
01:26:41,183 --> 01:26:43,588
Release her at once, please.

784
01:26:46,689 --> 01:26:52,724
The bureaucrats and the politicians
have asked me not to rock the boat...

785
01:26:53,821 --> 01:26:56,906
...not to roll stones
that have gathered moss,

786
01:26:56,907 --> 01:27:00,493
not to re-open old wounds.

787
01:27:00,494 --> 01:27:02,495
Let it be said

788
01:27:02,496 --> 01:27:07,292
that there are some dark corners
of this great democracy of ours...

789
01:27:07,293 --> 01:27:11,620
...that are afraid of close scrutiny.

790
01:27:12,548 --> 01:27:16,551
There must not be a government agency

791
01:27:16,552 --> 01:27:20,638
that is so mighty as to be allowed to exist

792
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,922
outside the walls of this country...

793
01:27:24,852 --> 01:27:28,480
The man in the brown jacket.
Get a man on him.

794
01:27:28,481 --> 01:27:31,385
I played basketball
for Ohio State University.

795
01:27:31,942 --> 01:27:37,977
I was not the most talented player
but I played with enthusiasm.

796
01:27:42,787 --> 01:27:47,244
...the old cliche, no pain and no gain.

797
01:27:51,671 --> 01:27:54,206
There he is! There!

798
01:28:03,599 --> 01:28:05,699
Get down, sir!

799
01:29:43,699 --> 01:29:45,985
Shit.

800
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:55,495
It's over!

801
01:29:59,632 --> 01:30:01,383
You hear me?

802
01:30:01,384 --> 01:30:04,085
It's over!

803
01:30:19,276 --> 01:30:22,946
They used you, like they used me,
don't you understand?

804
01:30:22,947 --> 01:30:25,933
- We're not enemies.
- Fuck you!

805
01:31:19,462 --> 01:31:22,366
Hello, Eddy.

806
01:31:23,758 --> 01:31:27,207
What a waste. You were the best.

807
01:31:30,056 --> 01:31:32,156
See you in hell.

808
01:31:47,782 --> 01:31:49,985
Thank God.

809
01:31:55,456 --> 01:31:59,154
The nightmare's over, Eddy. It's finished.

810
01:31:59,835 --> 01:32:02,295
It's finished.

811
01:32:02,296 --> 01:32:05,911
It's finished... it's finished.
