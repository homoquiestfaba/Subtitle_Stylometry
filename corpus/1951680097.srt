1
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:40,440
Well?

2
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:42,785
<i> I am sending you the code. </i>

3
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:45,051
Yes I see that, thank you.

4
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:53,106
- What about my account?
- Delivering.

5
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:15,785
<i> I have just sent it,
you should have it. </i>

6
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:17,351
Yes, thank you.

7
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,071
<i> Are you sure that this is legal? </i>

8
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:21,459
<i> we are just running a test on our
security systems, Sir, </i>

9
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:22,649
<i> it is fine. </i>

10
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,976
<i> you have a sexy voice. Err, is
there anything else we can do for you? </i>

11
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,524
- To you?
- We have a winner.

12
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:40,403
Ready.

13
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:52,098
Yo, guess who just made 50,000 today.

14
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:00,615
- What did you do to my drive, man?
- Man, shut up I didn't touch it.

15
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:04,201
Man, don't ever touch my computer.

16
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,702
The diagnostics show no damage but we are
certain that it was an intentional breech.

17
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:13,887
Are you saying we were hacked?

18
00:03:13,898 --> 00:03:15,601
It wasn't a denial of service level.

19
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:18,693
They definitely cracked our door.

20
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,811
OK. Open the "Black Eye" files.

21
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:22,353
I want every hacker in the country,

22
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:24,621
who could have done this,
interviewed, now.

23
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,387
Sir, that is close to a thousand names.

24
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:28,208
With the holiday weekend, we are
short staffed as it is.

25
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,216
Listen...

26
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:32,287
We are meant to stop this happening
and it just did.

27
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:33,243
Just get it done.

28
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,199
Sir, it is the middle of the night and
they are scattered over the whole country.

29
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:38,113
Fine, get local enforcement help.

30
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:41,768
Somebody thinks they can screw with us.
I want to find out who.

31
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,911
Dennis, I said no.

32
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:09,893
Lucy, you're killing me, alright?

33
00:04:11,078 --> 00:04:12,548
- Get out of the car.
- What?

34
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,388
- Out of the car, now!
- Don't touch me.

35
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,336
- No means no jerk-off.
- What are you doing?

36
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:18,420
- John, stop it!
- Don't call me that.

37
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,154
I hate it when you call me that.

38
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:22,651
- Do you know this guy?
- Shut up, shut your mouth.

39
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:23,711
Dad!

40
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,289
Stop it I mean it!

41
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,184
Dad? You said your dad was dead.

42
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:28,149
What?

43
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:30,720
You told this jerk-off I was dead?

44
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:34,483
- You actually said that?
- I may have exaggerated a little.

45
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:38,028
And is this guy your boyfriend?

46
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:39,115
- No!
- Yes!

47
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,551
I don't know.

48
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:43,624
We will see.

49
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:46,522
What are you doing here?

50
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,941
You don't answer your phone,
you don't return my calls.

51
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:50,734
That is because I am not
talking to you.

52
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:52,541
Why aren't you talking to me
this time, Lucy?

53
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:53,834
why not?

54
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,114
You want a list?

55
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,385
How about stuff like this:
you spy on me!

56
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:58,669
Do I spy on you?

57
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,439
You come over here and
drag my boyfriend of the car...

58
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,272
- You said that he is not your boyfriend.
- He is not!

59
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:05,285
- But you said that I was...
- God! Just...

60
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,524
You are such an asshole.

61
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:11,163
OK

62
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:14,402
I am sorry for pulling your
not boyfriend out of the car.

63
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:15,586
OK?

64
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:19,699
Let's just get in the car.

65
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,122
No!

66
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,740
- Wont both of you just go away?
- Talk to me, Lucy.

67
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,823
I am tired and I am going for bed.
Alone.

68
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:28,853
You are damn right alone.

69
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:32,456
Lucy, wait one minute.

70
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:34,319
I want to talk to you.
Wait.

71
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,229
Dad.

72
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:37,578
When I want to talk to you.

73
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,519
If I want to talk to you.

74
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:42,274
I'll call you.

75
00:05:42,823 --> 00:05:43,758
Lucy!

76
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:45,449
Wait, Lucy! Lucy!

77
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,995
- Lucy McClane!
- It is not McClane, it is Gennero.

78
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:53,504
Chicks, right?

79
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:58,643
I'm gonna go.

80
00:05:58,653 --> 00:05:59,879
I'll go.

81
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:28,134
<i> John! </i>

82
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:29,696
<i> John! </i>

83
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:31,099
<i> it is Sclavino. </i>

84
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:34,697
This is McClane.

85
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:37,844
- What are you doing at Rutgers?
- How does you know where I am?

86
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:40,338
We had all the cars tracked
4 years ago, you remember.

87
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,539
I am looking exactly
at where you are.

88
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,584
So that's not something that I
would turn on.

89
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:46,358
Yes, we did that, John.

90
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:47,837
We turned them on.

91
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:48,792
Listen...

92
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,486
The feds have called in a favour.

93
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:51,848
<i> they are doing a sweep. </i>

94
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:54,561
They want us to pick up a
a computer hacker in Camden.

95
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:56,420
The last name is Farrell.

96
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:58,276
<i> THE first name is Mathew. </i>

97
00:06:58,494 --> 00:06:59,410
Camden?

98
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,520
<i> What are you telling me for? </i>

99
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:03,634
<i> It's 3 in the morning.
I’m on my way home. </i>

100
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:06,751
Send a jug-head from the Academy.
They will be happy to go pick this kid up.

101
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,678
I can't just send
any one in uniform.

102
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:11,091
<i> The feds demanded
a senior detective. </i>

103
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,137
<i> The kid is a high value subject. </i>

104
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:14,952
<i> I don't know.
Just pick him up. </i>

105
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:17,257
Escort him to the
Hoover building in Washington.

106
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:20,993
They had some kind of
computer breech there this morning.

107
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:22,084
Right.

108
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:24,859
Give me the information.

109
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,709
Give me that name again
What is it?

110
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,531
You owe me one, Jack.

111
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:42,811
God damn it.

112
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:58,672
Plan B,
We do it ourselves

113
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,776
- Who is it?
- NYPD.

114
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:09,594
Open the door, please.

115
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:18,102
- Hi.
- NYPD?

116
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:19,910
Yeah.
I get it.

117
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,840
Don't worry, everyone gets lost
round here, happy to help

118
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,335
Son, I am not lost.

119
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:27,306
Are you Matt Farrell?
Mathew Farrell?

120
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,181
No...

121
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,210
Actually, he doesn't live here.

122
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,124
Of course not.
Who are you?

123
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:33,876
My name is Daisy Duke.

124
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:35,851
I got a lot of shit for
it when I was a kid.

125
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:37,907
Please, don't add to it.

126
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:41,330
Can I see some identification, please?

127
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:42,603
Yeah, sure.

128
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:48,480
Detective!
Yeah that looks real.

129
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,525
Where did you get that?
Toys R Us?

130
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,491
It looks great.

131
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:53,764
That...

132
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,709
That actually looks pretty good.

133
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:57,322
Farrell!

134
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,971
Soldier just pdld a new copy of the killzone.
Do you want to come to take a look?

135
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:02,541
No, thanks though man!

136
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:05,199
And good luck at the bad timing awards.

137
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:06,936
Open the door.

138
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,328
Shit!

139
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:16,940
- What's this about?
- I don't know.

140
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,570
Some kind of computer thing.

141
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,498
The DC Feds
wanna talk to you.

142
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,661
So, let's go.

143
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,774
- Feds, huh?
- Yeah, the Feds.

144
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:34,211
I've been watched for four years.

145
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:37,996
Once you are on that
god damn list. Pain in the ass.

146
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:39,704
Do you play with dolls?

147
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,629
Err, could you please
not touch that.

148
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,449
- Is it like a G.I.Joe?
- No, it is not!

149
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,346
It is a limited edition of...

150
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,090
- Is that meant to come off?
- No, it is not.

151
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,663
But it is much more valuable broken.
So thanks for that.

152
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,546
Crazy glue, I'm sure it's
very important.

153
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:57,048
I have other cool shit in
here if you want to break that.

154
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,590
Let's go, OK? Come on!

155
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:01,001
I need to power down
my gear, ok?

156
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:04,229
More dolls.

157
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,955
You don't spend a whole load of
time with the girls, huh?

158
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:11,084
Hey! Are you really trying to escape?

159
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:12,858
Please! Don't shoot.

160
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:15,148
- Don't shoot.
- Get down!

161
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:23,766
Keep your head down.

162
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,812
Let's go, come on.
Stay down.

163
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,241
Come on.

164
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,356
- Is everything OK?
- No.

165
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,593
Stay down.

166
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,909
- You stay with me.
- OK.

167
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,678
- Follow me.
- OK.

168
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:04,997
Right.

169
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,319
That's gonna wake the neighbours.

170
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:25,789
Get down, get inside.
Get down!

171
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:30,960
They are back in the room!

172
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,570
<i> They are back in the room! </i>

173
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:37,126
Are you nuts?

174
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:39,455
- Get out of there right now!
- I am trying...

175
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:40,485
Now!

176
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,369
Go to the right.

177
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:16,548
Let's go!

178
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:20,207
Get back in there!

179
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,870
Get ready to run.

180
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,235
Ready?

181
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,554
What the hell was that?

182
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:45,089
What?

183
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:46,589
Did you do that?

184
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:48,225
No.

185
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,235
Shit.

186
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:50,432
I didn't do that.

187
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,114
- Let's go.
- Shit.

188
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:54,062
Stay close to me.

189
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,359
OK.

190
00:14:57,254 --> 00:14:58,151
Let's go.

191
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,099
Come on, let's go damn it!

192
00:15:00,754 --> 00:15:01,805
Let's go.

193
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:02,939
Let's go!

194
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,809
Watch it.
Just tone it down.

195
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:07,166
OK.

196
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,190
- Let's go!

197
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:15,588
Stay close.

198
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:27,894
Stay with me.

199
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:29,981
- Stay with me.
- Right!

200
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:33,610
Let's go.
Stay close.

201
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,691
Get in the car.

202
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:38,991
- Go, go.
- Yes.

203
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,386
- Kid, can you reload a gun?
- What? Me?

204
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:50,162
- Can you reload a gun?
- Oh, yeah...

205
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:54,907
Look in the glove box and get a
magazine out right now!

206
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,122
Get your head down.

207
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:37,107
Is the circus in town?

208
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:49,118
- Did you see that?
- I saw it. I did it.

209
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:53,260
Camden Base 10077,
come back.

210
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,438
Camden Base 10077.

211
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:56,994
<i> Camden Base go ahead. </i>

212
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:59,851
I need to speak with your chief,
this is a police emergency.

213
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,027
ASAP.

214
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:02,095
<i> Standby. </i>

215
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:03,948
<i> This is chief detective Wiesman. </i>

216
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,656
Detective this is Detective John McClane
of the NYPD.

217
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,122
Police Emergency.

218
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:11,144
I want to report a police
shooting in your jurisdiction.

219
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,715
<i> Tell him yourself. </i>

220
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:31,396
Yes.

221
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:32,711
What's the status?

222
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:34,073
<i> We lost him. </i>

223
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,765
<i> Three of our men are dead. </i>

224
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:39,571
Hold the line.

225
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:00,897
Thomas.

226
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:05,273
We have a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell is still alive.

227
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:08,152
- So he got away?
- Yes.

228
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:12,488
- I did send 5 of you, right?
- Yes, but he was not alone.

229
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:15,223
I am sending the chopper, get airborne.
We will track him down.

230
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:17,456
<i> Think you can handle that? </i>

231
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,049
Oh my God!

232
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:26,583
- Just breathe.
- I am breathing, but...

233
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,529
- I can't stop shaking.
- It is the adrenaline.

234
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:31,139
You are just scared.
It will pass.

235
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,950
Of course I'm scared.

236
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:35,028
Weren’t you scared, back there?

237
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:36,126
Yes.

238
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,228
I was scared.

239
00:18:38,398 --> 00:18:40,388
Really?
This is you being scared?

240
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,602
I dunno, you seem really calm.

241
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:45,324
Have you done stuff like that before?

242
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:46,960
Stuff like what?

243
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:49,016
Like killing people.

244
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:51,359
Yes.

245
00:18:52,301 --> 00:18:54,033
Not for a long time.

246
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,601
Who were those guys?

247
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:01,017
Why did they try to kill you?
Why did they blow up my apartment?

248
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:03,190
They were there to kill you.

249
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,072
Why would they want to kill me?

250
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,505
You tell me, kid.

251
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:09,216
You're the criminal.

252
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:27,816
We got 7 dead hackers so far,
none high on our list

253
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,576
Collect the hard drives
and start sweeping them..

254
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:30,551
Yes, Sir.

255
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,513
Trey...

256
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:38,833
Matthew Farrell,
Find him for me.

257
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:39,943
On it.

258
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,353
What's with all the guns?

259
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:47,125
Operational prudence.

260
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:51,087
Think of them as
hardware to your software.

261
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:03,688
<i> good morning D.C. </i>

262
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:06,944
<i> Well it' shaping up to be
another beautiful 4th of July weekend. </i>

263
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:09,363
<i> If you've got any big plans,
you better get started early. </i>

264
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:11,775
<i> Because it looks like the
traffic is hotting up. </i>

265
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:15,924
<i> So another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there. </i>

266
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:18,168
What?

267
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,189
What?

268
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,073
What?

269
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:22,305
What are you doing?
What is that?

270
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:23,613
It is Credence.

271
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,256
- Credence?
- Credence.

272
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,302
Credence Clearwater Revival.

273
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,382
- Classic rock.
- I know who it is.

274
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:31,817
It is  old rock,
that does not make it classic.

275
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,843
What sucked back then
still sucks now.

276
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:35,220
You don't like Credence?

277
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:38,174
It is like having a pine cone
shoved up my ass.

278
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:39,522
OK, really...

279
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,097
Wow how mature!

280
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,195
Come on man.

281
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,149
<i> We are at a heading of 060.
Making another pass. </i>

282
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:53,652
Listen up everyone.

283
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,333
Are we ready?

284
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:58,539
The transportation hubs
are prepped and set.

285
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,012
Begin stage 1.

286
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,521
When was the last time you tuned
in your radio to pop music?

287
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:37,053
Give me any decade.

288
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:39,101
Was it the seventies?

289
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:41,339
Did Michael Jackson still play?

290
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:43,983
Pearl Jam.
I'm going back about 10 years.

291
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:45,261
Ten years.

292
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:46,755
Twenty years. The Cure? Nothing?

293
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:48,707
It's called News Radio.

294
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:52,079
I'm trying to see if any of your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

295
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:53,008
Hold on.

296
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:57,212
- You listen to the news?
- Yeah, you have a problem with the news now?

297
00:21:57,322 --> 00:22:00,211
Yes, I have a big God damned
problem with the news.

298
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,444
Are you ready for this?

299
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,903
The news is completely manipulated.

300
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:06,902
Everything that you hear
every single day...

301
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:10,386
is designed by corporate media
to do one thing only.

302
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:11,456
Jesus!

303
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:12,985
To keep you living in fear.

304
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:14,196
- Oh fear?
- Total fear.

305
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,166
Fear so you will go out and
spend money on things.

306
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:18,482
Things you probably don't even need.
Things you should already be sick of.

307
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:20,782
So that their advertisers keep
buying adds on their stations.

308
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:22,344
And I tell one more thing.
Are you ready for this?

309
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:25,337
I can do this all day man.
I've got days of data at home.

310
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:27,042
I'll drop a bomb on you bigger......

311
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:28,810
- HEY!
- SHUT UP!

312
00:22:28,821 --> 00:22:30,000
That's good, that's good,
be dismissive

313
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:31,009
You...

314
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:23,895
- Are you OK?
- No, I am not OK.

315
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:26,757
Stay in the car.
You will be OK.

316
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,668
Hey man! Hey.

317
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:34,300
How are you doing,
you alright?

318
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:36,019
Just call 911, alright?

319
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,341
Jesus Christ.

320
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,325
All of the lights are green.

321
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:04,713
All of the lights are green.

322
00:24:04,724 --> 00:24:05,874
Let's go, right now.

323
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,147
- We gotta go?
- Let's go.

324
00:24:07,158 --> 00:24:09,157
Get your bag hack boy.
Let's go.

325
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,079
- Jesus.
- Let's go.

326
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,730
I've never been in a crash.
Are you alright?

327
00:24:13,741 --> 00:24:15,694
Well it is very exciting.
This way, here we go.

328
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,880
- Have you ever been in a car accident?
- Yes, I have been in a car accident.

329
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:18,986
What are we doing?

330
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:23,116
A little thing they invented back
in the 60s, it's called jogging.

331
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:36,677
Sir, Chicago is reporting a system crash
in their train network

332
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:43,098
Amtrak is flashing a level 1
crash of their system

333
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:47,011
F.A.A. just issued a critical alert.
Their ATC Net just went down.

334
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:48,623
We are under attack.

335
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,485
OK.

336
00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:55,584
Let's get them outside
for a little bit of fresh air.

337
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:05,832
That is the Anthrax Alarm.

338
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:09,607
Alright, everyone out,
Now!

339
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:10,658
Now!

340
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,806
Taylor, move, go.

341
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:16,020
Move!

342
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:35,521
<i> All personnel must evacuate
and proceed to the shelters immediately. </i>

343
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:37,608
<i> This is not a drill. </i>

344
00:25:37,718 --> 00:25:42,445
<i> All personnel must evacuate
and proceed to the shelters immediately. </i>

345
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:11,746
Take the team and go for
the fourth floor. Got it?

346
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:13,110
Masks on.

347
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:17,323
Make it happen, OK?

348
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:19,100
Research the data
from these crashes,

349
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,291
see if you can ID the
point of origin.

350
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:25,239
Begin Stage 2.

351
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,285
<i> Hey what is going on? </i>

352
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:34,896
<i> What is happening? </i>

353
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,648
They are already starting
to panic.

354
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:47,614
Of course they are.

355
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,489
They think that someone
is taking their money.

356
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,294
All of those nickel
and dimes they saved.

357
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:56,507
Useful idiots,
as Lyman would say.

358
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,819
Prep the video package.

359
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:14,300
DC transportation system is crashing

360
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:16,850
And they just hit the financial
sector. Everything.

361
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:21,563
Call the Secretary of Trans, the
Treasury And the Director of F.C.C.

362
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,738
Let's go people!

363
00:27:22,783 --> 00:27:25,248
Somebody, somewhere,
has left a digital fingerprint.

364
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:26,373
Find it!

365
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,392
Is Deputy Director Bowman
in here?

366
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:30,928
- Not now it will have to wait.
- Not today waxworks.

367
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:32,454
This is Matthew Farrell.

368
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:34,317
I brought him here on direct
orders from Bowman.

369
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:36,843
So if you don't know what's going on,
find me somebody who does.

370
00:27:36,952 --> 00:27:38,092
I am Bowman.

371
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:47,112
The video package is
ready for upload.

372
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,225
Thanks.

373
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,011
Listen, John.

374
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:53,360
I thank for bringing Farrell,
but everything’s changed this morning

375
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:55,230
We are neck deep in
damage control right now.

376
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,559
'Scuse me, I'm sorry, Sir.

377
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,180
Do you have something to eat?
Any snacks around here?

378
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:01,446
I would love... I am
really low on blood sugar.

379
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:02,511
Sir?

380
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:04,089
No?

381
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:12,051
<i> As if the crash of the traffic
system wasn't bad enough. </i>

382
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:14,991
<i> the Stock exchange was
in a selling frenzy this afternoon. </i>

383
00:28:15,101 --> 00:28:20,240
<i> the Commission believes this panic
may have been caused by computer malfunction. </i>

384
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,699
<i> it is Believed to be related... </i>

385
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,868
It's not as bad as it looks.

386
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:28,891
We run drills to prepare
for things like this.

387
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,302
- Are these your suspects?
- They were.

388
00:28:31,313 --> 00:28:34,374
All seven were killed
in the last 24 hours.

389
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:37,449
Do you recognize any of them?

390
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:40,350
No.

391
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:41,833
Not one??

392
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,431
Sir.

393
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:45,628
You need to see something here.

394
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,950
<i> My fellow Americans... </i>

395
00:28:57,961 --> 00:28:59,487

00:29:46,914 --> 00:29:48,258
<i> And we won't fail. </i>

429
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:50,534
I don't know how they
are getting in.

430
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:51,946
<i> Thank you. </i>

431
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,102
<I> And a...
Happy... 

432
00:29:53,113 --> 00:29:55,434
Independence Day...
for everyone!

433
00:29:58,302 --> 00:29:59,674
That was creepy.

434
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,541
I tried to find more Nixon.

435
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,964
Do you think they bought it?

436
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:06,736
Absolutely.

437
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:10,792
OK.

438
00:30:10,803 --> 00:30:13,005
I want telecommunications, transports and...

439
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:15,255
Jesus Christ! It's a Fire Sale.

440
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:16,173
What?

441
00:30:16,907 --> 00:30:18,895
It's a Fire Sale.

442
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:21,040
Hey, we don't know that yet.

443
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:22,553
It is a myth anyway.
It cannot be done.

444
00:30:22,564 --> 00:30:23,871
Oh it's a myth?
Really?

445
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:26,726
Please tell me she's only here for show
and she's not actually in charge of anything.

446
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:29,393
- What is a Fire Sale?
- It is a three step....

447
00:30:29,503 --> 00:30:32,948
It is a three step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

448
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:35,220
ok Step 1 : Take out all
the transportation

449
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:37,306
Step 2 : The financial base and telecoms

450
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:40,948
Step 3 : Get rid of all the utilities.
Gas, Water, Electricity, Nuclear....

451
00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:42,680
Basically everything that is
controlled by a computer.

452
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:44,941
Which nowadays is almost everything.

453
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,157
So that's why they call it a Fire Sale
because everything must go.

454
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:50,190
Hey, listen,
what's your name?

455
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,585
Farrell?
Keep your voice down OK?

456
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:54,913
Nobody here is talking about a Fire Sale.

457
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:57,701
Not unless you are telling me
you helped plan one.

458
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:00,561
No man, I'm just saying...

459
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:04,316
We appreciate the concern, we
know what we are doing, thank you.

460
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:05,576
What?

461
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:08,648
- What?
- Nothing, I said I understand.

462
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:12,149
Hey, they didn't send the
girl scouts to get this kid.

463
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:14,931
They sent professional guys,
full tactical gear,

464
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:16,408
they blew the whole joint up.

465
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:18,433
Now look, I don't know this kid...

466
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,600
and, frankly, I don't give a shit.
No offence.

467
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,866
But somebody wants this kid dead.

468
00:31:22,975 --> 00:31:27,272
And obviously, it's got something
to do with what's going on here.

469
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:29,716
Humler is taking over
the interrogations,

470
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:31,124
of the hackers that we are bringing in.

471
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:33,458
I will get you an escort over there.

472
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:36,629
Right? Molina, get this kid
to the front of the line.

473
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:39,336
- I want to know what he knows.
- Right.

474
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:42,965
If he knew about half of what I know,
his fuzzy little head would explode.

475
00:31:43,173 --> 00:31:45,098
Special agent Johnson.
I will take you there.

476
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:47,922
- Agent Johnson?
- That's right.

477
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:49,661
Right this way.

478
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,658
- So is any of what you were saying possible?
- Possible?

479
00:31:54,944 --> 00:31:57,923
OK look, I will tell you again.
If you take away any one thing, no problem,

480
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:00,971
but if you take it down all at once,
the system crashes, and...

481
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:03,031
look around, man!

482
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:07,643
Come on, the government has got to have
dozens of departments dedicated to that shit.

483
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:11,742
It took FEMA 5 days to get
water to the superdome.

484
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:36,514
How long until we get to
the Dept. of Homeland Security?

485
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:40,428
Lauflin, get on the police band and get
them to clear a route to the D.H.S.

486
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:45,363
DC Metro, this is the
F.B.I., requesting you to...

487
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:50,317
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

488
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,658
The feds are taking him to Homeland.

489
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:54,537
Good, close that loop now.

490
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:55,664
Isolate the frequency.

491
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:59,624
Locate the vehicles and get
me John McClane's file.

492
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:04,475
<i > Brad, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for location.

493
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:08,342
I don't mean to harp guys but

494
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,769
but have just passed another
snack bar and I am starving.

495
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:13,722
- Shut up.
- I need to eat.

496
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:15,334
- Shut up.

497
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:18,580
Shut up. You have 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me back there.

498
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:21,069
Did I lie to you?
What are you talking about?

499
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:23,919
The pictures on the wall.
You knew those guys, right?

500
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:26,472
- I, wha..., I ...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

501
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:30,048
I am a cop, I can tell you are
lying. Who are they?

502
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:34,476
OK, OK OK...

503
00:33:37,497 --> 00:33:39,571
They were my competition.

504
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,842
Make the next right onto Concord.

505
00:33:44,952 --> 00:33:46,070
They said they were a software firm
that had developed some kind of

506
00:33:46,081 --> 00:33:47,508
a new algorithm

507
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,462
and they just wanted to see
if it could be cracked.

508
00:33:50,718 --> 00:33:53,325
That's what I do,
I do math based security.

509
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,513
Here's the thing,

510
00:33:58,527 --> 00:34:02,783
the thing that I've been thinking is
that if you can do something this massive

511
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:04,495
you need tons of start-up guys
to write the software

512
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,158
but only a few black hats

513
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:08,177
to actually implement that stuff

514
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:11,202
so then the start-up guys
who haven't really done anything

515
00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:13,352
like me...
-End up as pictures on a wall

516
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:18,740
I swear to God McClane
I had no idea I was gonna be

517
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:21,746
an accessory to Armageddon

518
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:24,258
<i> Take the next left at Lexington. </i>

519
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,839
and that's a sexy voice.

520
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:28,784
What is she taking us this way for?

521
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:30,328
- Oh, my God!

522
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:32,698
<i> Unit this is dispatch 
 clear a route for two F.B.I. vehicles... </i>

523
00:34:32,808 --> 00:34:34,472
<i> F.B.I. we have cleared a path. </i>

524
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:36,597
- That's her!
- Her who?

525
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:39,067
What are you talking about?

526
00:34:39,763 --> 00:34:40,797
It is them.

527
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:43,657
- Are you saying it's "them" them?
- I swear to you, I know her.

528
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:46,609
I would know her voice anywhere.

529
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,819
- Don't say anything.
- Keep you mouth shut for a second.

530
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:53,929
Hey Metro,
how's your day going over there?

531
00:34:54,145 --> 00:34:57,602
Gotta be crazy over there
with all these 5-87s, huh?

532
00:34:57,693 --> 00:35:00,410
Yes, Sir, we had to
dispatch all units.

533
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:03,400
Yeah you had to dispatch all units,

534
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:06,126
for all the naked people walking around?

535
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:10,122
Cut the bullshit honey
and just put your boss on.

536
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:15,352
<i> Lauflin, we are getting off this route
make a left here on 14th street.. </i>

537
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,150
- Officer McClane.
- That is Detective McClane, asshole.

538
00:35:27,465 --> 00:35:30,022
Don't worry though, we will have
plenty of time to get to know each other...

539
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:32,023
when I come visit you in prison.

540
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:35,835
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

541
00:35:35,945 --> 00:35:37,750
Your address in Brooklyn...

542
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:42,307
the payments on your mortgage,
how long you have been in the NYPD

543
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:46,157
and how is Holly?
That's sad, you are divorced.

544
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:48,933
Was that tough on little
Jack and Lucy?

545
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:55,361
After thirty years, I would have thought
you had a better pension plan.

546
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,520
Oh and it gets worse...

547
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:02,611
Your 401k no longer exists

548
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:05,572
Tell you what, let me
make it up to you.

549
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:07,652
-Box them in at that intersection.

550
00:36:07,663 --> 00:36:09,778
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head,
and drive away

551
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:13,382
by the time you get to the end
of the next block,

552
00:36:13,491 --> 00:36:15,502
all your debts will
be wiped clean...

553
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:18,791
and your children
will be set for life.

554
00:36:18,947 --> 00:36:22,297
That really is tempting,
especially that last part.

555
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:24,399
But I think I'll pass, Jerk off.

556
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:30,199
John, you are a Timex
watch in a digital age.

557
00:36:30,344 --> 00:36:31,581
You are gonna lose.

558
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:35,799
Yes, well the other thing that can
happen, it is that I can come and find you...

559
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:38,051
kick your ass and throw you
out of your own party.

560
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:41,755
- What do you think about that dickhead?
- Hold your position.

561
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:45,124
He is not responding.

562
00:36:49,014 --> 00:36:50,683
Down, get down!

563
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:02,906
Officers down at the corner
of Main with Constitution.

564
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:04,985
I repeat, officers down.

565
00:37:22,168 --> 00:37:24,086
Come on, come on,
get out let's go!

566
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:27,801
God Damn It!

567
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:29,407
Stay down!

568
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:37,110
Get down, just hold on!

569
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:48,995
We have a squad car under fire
we need backup.

570
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:50,363
<i> I Repeat, we need backup! </i>

571
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:53,209
This is base, we are
sending backup.

572
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,369
Hang on, hang on.

573
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:15,453
Hang on.

574
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:32,045
Hold on.

575
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:50,516
- We lost ....
- Stay with them.

576
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:07,414
OK take the tunnel, left left left!

577
00:39:23,174 --> 00:39:25,092
Give me the schematics
of that tunnel.

578
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,622
The tunnel!

579
00:39:35,448 --> 00:39:37,700
Open the gates on the North side entrance.

580
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,339
Redirect traffic,
occupy all lanes.

581
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,323
- Open the other side.
- What?

582
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:06,805
Move!

583
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,323
Hang on to something!

584
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:50,258
Hey, don't get out of the car!
Hey!

585
00:40:57,441 --> 00:40:58,839
Stop!

586
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,756
Run!

587
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,310
Oh God!

588
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,624
Don't ever hesitate
like that again.

589
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:29,521
Are you alright?

590
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:37,786
- Stay here, don't move.
- What?

591
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:39,611
You've been here before John.

592
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:42,323
Get over to the wall, Sir.

593
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,376
The feds called in a favour.

594
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:50,141
All you gotta do is pick
up a kid in Jersey...

595
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:51,978
drive him down to DC.

596
00:41:52,103 --> 00:41:55,511
How hard can that be, huh?
It can't be that hard can it?

597
00:41:56,278 --> 00:41:59,063
No, gotta be a senior detective

598
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:05,173
think that a traffic jam

599
00:42:05,184 --> 00:42:08,428
or throwing a car at me
Will stop me, huh?

600
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:13,278
- Red, get in there and get it done.
- It won't be necessary, he is leaving.

601
00:42:23,817 --> 00:42:25,496
This is not a good idea!

602
00:43:02,615 --> 00:43:05,471
- Don't touch me!
- OK OK alright...

603
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,572
Are you OK? Oh my God!

604
00:43:10,028 --> 00:43:12,473
- Pretty lucky shot, huh?
- Oh yeah lucky!

605
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:16,061
Jesus, you just killed a
helicopter with a car.

606
00:43:16,171 --> 00:43:17,770
I was out of bullets.

607
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:22,014
How you doin'?

608
00:43:22,025 --> 00:43:25,314
I skinned my knee and my
asthma is acting up....

609
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:28,083
Whatever, yeah I'm fine.

610
00:43:40,238 --> 00:43:41,562
<i> Red, check in. </i>

611
00:43:43,596 --> 00:43:45,520
<i> The helicopter is destroyed. </i>

612
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:47,487
What about Farrell and McClane?

613
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:50,725
- They are both dead.
- Come back in.

614
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:53,181
OK we are moving on,
begin Stage 3.

615
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:55,116
I have just spoken to Emmerson.

616
00:43:55,127 --> 00:43:56,663
The teams are arriving
at Woodlawn now.

617
00:43:56,674 --> 00:43:58,388
Very good.

618
00:43:58,505 --> 00:44:00,756
Mai, get ready for the downloads.

619
00:44:07,154 --> 00:44:08,842
Identification, Sir.

620
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:11,921
Park behind the transpo
and we will guide you in.

621
00:44:11,932 --> 00:44:14,212
Man the gate, you come with me.

622
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:23,354
The anthrax alarms only went off
across five floors.

623
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:26,298
Below that you will
need clearance.

624
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:28,724
I don't know why you would
need to go down there

625
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:31,609
there is nothing down there
but servers.

626
00:44:35,997 --> 00:44:37,813
<i> All clear. Rodriguez! </i>

627
00:44:39,237 --> 00:44:40,089
<i> Incoming. </i>

628
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:56,569
- The gate is secured.
- Copy.

629
00:45:05,227 --> 00:45:07,152
OK, we are in.

630
00:45:42,212 --> 00:45:47,347
Hey, this is absurd
there is tough and there is stupid.

631
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,460
You need a hospital,
look at you.

632
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,074
I am not a doctor, but
you look like you are hurt.

633
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:53,692
- Yes, sexy, right?
- No.

634
00:45:53,703 --> 00:45:54,871
Come on.

635
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:58,504
We don't need a doctor,
we need the cops.

636
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:25,860
He's in.

637
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:30,858
Get out of the way,
look out, please.

638
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:38,806
NYPD, alright, I got this kid.
Come on let's go.

639
00:46:44,332 --> 00:46:45,932
NYPD

640
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,102
Sergeant?

641
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,148
Sergeant!

642
00:46:51,364 --> 00:46:53,289
I need to speak with you.

643
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,000
The doctor is in the back.

644
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:57,823
I am NYPD,
I need to talk to you.

645
00:46:58,078 --> 00:46:59,468
Just give me a minute.

646
00:47:05,738 --> 00:47:08,158
Oh my God!

647
00:47:13,106 --> 00:47:14,677
Let's get of here.

648
00:47:18,424 --> 00:47:21,245
<i> Perfect! Now the second sequence. </i>

649
00:47:26,908 --> 00:47:28,529
<i> The server is ready. </i>

650
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:30,522
We are go.

651
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:33,116
Launch the downloads.

652
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,153
Nothing is happening.

653
00:47:44,164 --> 00:47:45,556
Be patient.

654
00:47:47,048 --> 00:47:50,761
- I don't know, it's not responding.
- Wait for it.

655
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:56,132
See.

656
00:47:56,644 --> 00:47:58,166
There you go.

657
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,584
Let me know when the
download reaches 20%.

658
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:01,760
OK.

659
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:13,174
- Excuse me!
- Thank you!

660
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,526
Holy Shit!

661
00:48:15,878 --> 00:48:17,961
Kid? Kid? Hey!

662
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:20,546
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yes.

663
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:22,047
Come on let's go.

664
00:48:25,474 --> 00:48:28,791
and here you go, agent...
Tavarek. I guess that's you.

665
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,359
The download is at 20%.

666
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:56,873
Time to move. Let's keep them
chasing their tails.

667
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:12,518
Due to the recent activity...

668
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:15,382
law enforcement agencies are
being extremely cautious.

669
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:20,014
They are telling people to abandon
vehicles, until they are searched.

670
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:21,246
And as you can see...

671
00:49:21,257 --> 00:49:23,932
K-9 units are
checking each vehicle.

672
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:26,856
Now whether this is connected
to the anthrax reports earlier...

673
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:29,895
or if it is a new  terrorist threat
we don't know that this stage.

674
00:49:30,005 --> 00:49:31,527
FAA just grounded all flights.

675
00:49:31,538 --> 00:49:32,969
- Good.
- Sir...

676
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,971
We have complete access
over system networks.

677
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:38,347
Phones, power grids,
water, nuclear....

678
00:49:38,456 --> 00:49:40,381
- Hey, excuse me...
- Dan Parry, The NSA

679
00:49:40,392 --> 00:49:43,166
Chuck Summer DHS Liaison.
The White House made the call.

680
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:45,161
Anything you need,
We are here to help.

681
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:47,091
Help? Wow. that's, that's great.

682
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:49,879
We are gonna need some work space
for our people.

683
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:51,872
What can you do for us?

684
00:49:51,883 --> 00:49:53,900
Well as you can see, we are
using the space...

685
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:56,099
you guys can stand in the corner,

686
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:57,111
and liaise.

687
00:49:57,156 --> 00:49:59,080
and if I need something...

688
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:00,582
I'll just wake you.

689
00:50:21,661 --> 00:50:23,982
- Wait, no no. Don't call.
- What?

690
00:50:24,092 --> 00:50:25,975
- What are you talking about?
- They probably cracked that hours ago

691
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:27,605
if you use it they might
be able to trace us here.

692
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:28,745
- Just put in your pocket.
- Sure?

693
00:50:28,855 --> 00:50:30,523
Yes.

694
00:50:30,765 --> 00:50:32,690
Or smash it, you didn't have to smash it...

695
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:35,927
Excuse, me.
police Emergency.

696
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:37,971
He'll call you right back.

697
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:40,194
Here, wait in here.

698
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,234
- Do you have a signal?
- Yes.

699
00:50:44,487 --> 00:50:45,654
Yes.

700
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:47,993
This is John McClane
for agent Bowman.

701
00:50:48,102 --> 00:50:50,413
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

702
00:50:51,438 --> 00:50:52,618
McClane, go.

703
00:50:52,629 --> 00:50:53,865
We never made it to DHS

704
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:58,004
They came for the kid again.
All your men are down.

705
00:50:58,902 --> 00:51:01,914
- And what about Farrell?
- Yeah he's here with me.

706
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:03,907
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

707
00:51:03,918 --> 00:51:05,705
Yeah I'll hold on.

708
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:12,556
Another day in paradise.

709
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:13,957
They just swamped everything,

710
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:17,819
the whole telecom system.
Phones, cellular, satellite...

711
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:31,199
They are blanketing every station.

712
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:59,493
- Can you put the news back on?
- This is the news.

713
00:51:59,603 --> 00:52:02,532
It on every channel,
It's been like this for a few minutes now.

714
00:52:19,388 --> 00:52:21,216
Oh my God!

715
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:23,559
Shit!

716
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,511
McClane!

717
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:33,695
Look out!

718
00:52:35,142 --> 00:52:35,935
Look out!

719
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,956
Bowman? Do you see that?

720
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,848
- McClane?
- Bowman?

721
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:43,250
It's a fake.

722
00:52:46,678 --> 00:52:49,057
I see it.

723
00:52:49,075 --> 00:52:50,500
Thank God!

724
00:52:53,785 --> 00:52:56,106
- McClane?
- Bowman.

725
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:04,835
The satellite's down.
Get me a landline.

726
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:21,639
One little piece of code
and the world falls apart.

727
00:53:22,222 --> 00:53:24,710
- This is virtual terrorism.
- What?

728
00:53:25,064 --> 00:53:28,332
It's crazy, the first time that I
heard of a Fire Sale

729
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:31,621
I actually thought it would be cool,
if somebody did it.

730
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:35,087
Hit the "reset" button...

731
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,001
melt the system, just for fun.

732
00:53:38,573 --> 00:53:40,456
Hey, it is not a system.

733
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,846
It is a country. We are
talking about people.

734
00:53:42,955 --> 00:53:44,880
A whole country, full of people.

735
00:53:44,891 --> 00:53:46,281
Sitting at home, alone...

736
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:48,116
scared to death in
their houses, alright.

737
00:53:48,127 --> 00:53:50,053
So if you are done with
your little nostalgic moment...

738
00:53:50,163 --> 00:53:54,001
maybe you can think a little
and help me catch these guys.

739
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:55,614
Just help me.

740
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:57,813
Just put yourself in their shoes.

741
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:00,136
Come on.

742
00:54:00,212 --> 00:54:03,501
if this were your Fire Sale,
what would be your next move?

743
00:54:05,426 --> 00:54:09,807
OK, the point of a Fire Sale is that it
is mostly done by remote, right...

744
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:12,485
But not everything is run
completely on-line.

745
00:54:12,594 --> 00:54:15,408
Major utilities aren't,
they are run in closed circuits...

746
00:54:15,517 --> 00:54:17,442
you can breech the security
up to a certain point, but...

747
00:54:17,453 --> 00:54:22,025
to shut it down you would have
to physically go there...

748
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:24,873
You know what, give me that guys PDA.

749
00:54:24,884 --> 00:54:26,445
The phones don't work,
they are all dead.

750
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,479
No the phones are fine
it is the network that is dead.

751
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,374
I only need to reprogram it...

752
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:33,504
and link it into the old sat-coms,
hackers surf them the whole time.

753
00:54:33,614 --> 00:54:36,041
It is probably what these guys are
using to talk to each other.

754
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:38,530
How do you know all this stuff?

755
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,260
Dude, I don't know.

756
00:54:40,535 --> 00:54:42,557
I couldn't explain it to you.

757
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:43,637
OK.

758
00:54:43,853 --> 00:54:45,450
The national power grid,
gas and the electricity...

759
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,685
they are divided in to
three zones, right?

760
00:54:46,696 --> 00:54:50,212
Eastern, Central and Western.
Each one with a primary hub.

761
00:54:50,566 --> 00:54:51,958
Here it is.

762
00:54:54,437 --> 00:54:57,211
- What is that, what am I looking at?
- That is the eastern hub.

763
00:54:57,321 --> 00:54:59,204
Now, they take this out...

764
00:54:59,215 --> 00:55:01,495
It wipes out all the power
for the entire eastern corridor.

765
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,024
But again they will have to
do it manually.

766
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:06,413
OK.

767
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:09,650
- Come on, let's go.
- What, to West Virgínia?

768
00:55:09,759 --> 00:55:12,137
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me.

769
00:55:12,247 --> 00:55:14,468
- McClane, McClane?
- Oh you get used to it.

770
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:15,969
McClane. Oh, shit!

771
00:55:16,594 --> 00:55:20,235
Sir, wireless networks are down
they are hitting the landlines too.

772
00:55:20,344 --> 00:55:23,287
I don't care how,
you find me a line.

773
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:25,024
Come on, what you got?

774
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,047
We swept the whole building,
It seems clean. We can...

775
00:55:27,058 --> 00:55:28,941
- sweep it again, but...
- Don't bother.

776
00:55:28,952 --> 00:55:30,493
Don't bother.

777
00:55:30,946 --> 00:55:34,115
It is fake. These guys planned this...

778
00:55:34,718 --> 00:55:37,533
Alright get everybody back
inside the crisis centre, now.

779
00:55:37,642 --> 00:55:39,923
Let's open it up!

780
00:55:40,978 --> 00:55:42,304
Come on, get in.

781
00:55:42,601 --> 00:55:47,477
The door is locked. Unless
you have an extra gun to unlock it.

782
00:55:49,627 --> 00:55:50,919
Hey, don't do that.

783
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,856
You're gonna disable it... Shit.

784
00:55:56,237 --> 00:55:57,404
Wow, crazy, did you see that?

785
00:55:58,236 --> 00:56:02,334
Sorry about that man.
I didn't know it would come out so fast.

786
00:56:05,937 --> 00:56:07,329
How did you do yours?

787
00:56:09,768 --> 00:56:12,760
Are you alright? What,
did it hit you a little bit.

788
00:56:12,948 --> 00:56:13,925
Sorry.

789
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,211
Please, don't touch those, OK?
I know what am doing.

790
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,875
I have done this before.

791
00:56:21,992 --> 00:56:24,303
I mean, I have read about it.

792
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,945
<i> Road Assist we have detected
an airbag deployment. </i>

793
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,938
Yes erm! Please, we hit a tree...

794
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:31,874
and my Dad is having
a heart attack...

795
00:56:31,885 --> 00:56:34,658
I think he is gonna die.
You need to help us!

796
00:56:34,768 --> 00:56:37,501
Hold while we contact
the Emergency Services.

797
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,140
No no no! He is dying!

798
00:56:39,151 --> 00:56:41,273
Please, listen to me. I can take him
to the hospital, I can drive.

799
00:56:41,284 --> 00:56:44,688
I am fine! But the key doesn't turn.

800
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:47,492
So you have to start the
car for us OK? Please, Dad...

801
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:49,626
Your name, please?

802
00:56:50,485 --> 00:56:52,864
My name is...

803
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:56,241
Frank and my Dad's name is...

804
00:56:59,607 --> 00:57:03,302
Dvorak Tsargentzki!

805
00:57:05,098 --> 00:57:07,813
Please,  just help us! We need
your help, please!

806
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:09,996
The Emergency Services are on their way.

807
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:12,235
No no no! Listen, mam.

808
00:57:12,246 --> 00:57:13,768
- What is your name?
- Dolores.

809
00:57:13,772 --> 00:57:15,572
Dolores? OK, Dolores...

810
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,014
I don't know if you have a Dad...

811
00:57:17,025 --> 00:57:18,210
but I do...

812
00:57:18,328 --> 00:57:20,450
And I want to be able
to say that a year from now, OK?

813
00:57:20,461 --> 00:57:22,245
Because my Dad is my
hero and right now he is...

814
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,675
in my arms, dying and...

815
00:57:24,685 --> 00:57:26,152
and his only hope is...

816
00:57:26,156 --> 00:57:28,122
to get to a hospital right now!
We can't wait!

817
00:57:28,131 --> 00:57:31,837
So, please!
Start the God damn car!

818
00:57:35,269 --> 00:57:36,474
Thank you, Dolores.

819
00:57:36,513 --> 00:57:38,991
Pass the P.D.A.
I gotta call the Warlock.

820
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:42,410
- The what?
- Warlock, he is a digital jedi.

821
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,239
Mam you are not authorised
to be here.

822
00:58:01,254 --> 00:58:03,852
F.B.I. We suspect there has
been a security breech.

823
00:58:03,861 --> 00:58:06,677
You have landed without authorisation.

824
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:29,816
- That was pretty good back there, kid.
- Thanks.

825
00:58:29,976 --> 00:58:34,346
- What’s the matter, nothing to complain about?
- No, just.......

826
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:38,974
- What? What's the problem?
- I'm not like you,
